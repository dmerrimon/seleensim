Title  Targeting Cellular Senescence with Senolytics to Improve Skeletal 
Health in Older Humans: A Phase 2, Single -Center, [ADDRESS_357387] whether intermittent senolytic therapy reduces markers of 
biological age and improves bone turnover markers and skeletal 
parameters in older postmenopausal women  
Number of Subjects  240 screened, 74 accrued  
Diagnosis and Main 
Inclusion Criteria  Elderly postmenopausal women, aged ≥60years, with increased 
senescent cell abundance in blood  
Study Product, Dose, 
Route, Regimen  This study will involve a n oral treatment regimen with Dasatinib ( D; 
100 mg for two days) plus Quercetin ( Q; 1000 mg total daily  for three 
consecutive  days) taken orally on an intermittent schedule (starting 
every 28 days) with no -therapy periods in between dosing regimens, 
repeated every 28 days over 20 weeks, resulting in five total dosing 
periods  throughout the entire intervention . Note that we are modifying 
the protocol to complete 30 subjects in the control group, 30 in the 
D+Q group, and [ADDRESS_357388] completed the F -group but no additional 
subjects will be added to that group.  
Duration of 
Administration  Five total intermittent dosing periods  throughout the 20 -week 
intervention  
Reference therapy  Untreated control group  
Statistical 
Methodology  Using previously published data, power calculations were conducted, 
while allowing for an estimated withdrawal rate of 10%. This 
calculation demonstrated that 30 subjects per group will provide the 
study with 90% power to detect a 19.8% difference in the bone 
resorption marker, CTX ( 17.1% with 80% power), which is our 
primary endpoint .

  CONFIDENTIAL  1 Introduction  
 
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study will be carried out in 
accordance with the applicable  [LOCATION_002]  government regulations and Mayo Clinic research 
policies and procedures.  
1.1 Background  
 
The Mayo Clinic Aging Group is at the forefront of discovering, developi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and optimizing 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_293109] – “senolytics”. With aging, DNA damage and/or other 
cellular stressors(1-4) cause proliferating(5,6) and terminally differentiated, non -dividing cells(7-10) 
to undergo senescence. Senescent cell characteristics include profound chromatin and secretome 
changes, increased expression of senescence biomarkers ( e.g., p16Ink4a and p21Cip1) and 
resistance to apoptosis(1,11). Senescent cells also develop the senescence -associated secretory 
phenotype ( SASP ), consisting of pro -inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and matrix -degrading 
proteins that have deleterious paracrine and systemic effects(12-16). Further, because senescent 
cells accumulate in multiple tissues in temporal and spatial synchrony with age -associated 
functional decline in animals and humans(5-7,17-24), they have been hypothesized to drive the 
deterioration underlying numerous chronic diseases(1). Indeed, even a relatively low abundance 
of senescent cells ( e.g., ~10-15% in old primates(23)) is sufficient to cause tissue dysfunction. 
Therefore, senescent cells represent promising therapeutic targets to delay or alleviate functional 
deficits and chronic disorders of aging, including age -related bone loss.  
Consistent with this, eliminating even a relatively small proportion (~30%) of senescent cells 
using a “suicide” transgene, INK-ATTAC (p16Ink4a-linked apoptosis through targeted activation 
of caspase(25)), that permits inducible elimination of p16Ink4a-expressing senescent cells upon 
administration of a drug (AP20187), extends healthspan and prevents the development of 
multiple age -related morbidities in both progeroid and naturally aged mice(12,25 -27). As an 
alternative to this genetic approach and one applicable to humans, the Kirkland group at Mayo 
Clinic exploited the dependence of senescent cells on specific pro -survival pathways and 
identified that the combination of Dasatinib (D; an FDA -approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
[TKI] in clinical use for treating hematologic disorders(28,29)) plus Quercetin (Q; a natural 
flavanol present in many fruits and vegetables(30) that targets BCL -2, insulin/IGF -1, and HIF -1α 
networks(31-33)) [D+Q], has in vitro  senolytic activity by [CONTACT_293138], differentiated cells(31). 
To test this approach  in vivo , work by [CONTACT_293139] D+Q therapy delays the 
onset of several age -related disorders(7,26,27,31,34 -41). For example, intermittent D+Q therapy 
extends healthspan in mice by [CONTACT_293140] -related bone loss(27) and improving several aspects 
of physical dysfunction/frailty(39) as well as atherosclerosis(26), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
(IPF)(36), and tau -mediated neurodegenerative disease(38). Intermittent D+Q therapy also extended 
maximal lifespan in old mice as post -treatment survival was significantly increased by 36%(39). 
More recent findings(34,40) as well as our unpublished data have established that Fisetin (F; a 
flavonol with similar chemical structure to Q(42,43)) also has potent senolytic activity both in 
vitro(34,40) and in vivo(40), with beneficial effects on multiple tissues in both progeroid and young 
wild-type (WT) mice “aged” by [CONTACT_293141]. Thus, intermittently treating aged

(RCT). 
This study will include normal, elderly postmenopausal women, aged ≥60years, with increased 
senescent cell abundance in peripheral blood T -lymphocytes (PBTL) at screening by T -cell 
assay.  
1.[ADDRESS_357389] is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active substance being 
tested or used as a reference in a clinical study, including products already with a marketing 
authorization but used or assembled (formulated or packaged) differently than the authorized 
form, or used for a n unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further information about the 
authorized form. The investigational products will be stored in a secure area according to local 
regulations. Investigators will have responsibility for ensuring that investigati onal product is only 
dispensed to study subjects. The investigational products ( Dasatinib plus Quercetin ) will be 
dispensed only by [CONTACT_293142], [COMPANY_002]ster. 
In this protocol, investigational products are Dasatinib  plus Quercetin . 
 
 
1.2.1 Sprycel® (Dasatinib)  
 
Sprycel® (D asatinib) is an FDA approved product (NDA #021986). SPRYCEL is a kinase 
inhibitor indicated for the treatment of:  
• Newly diagnosed adults with Philadelphia chromosome -positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid 
leukemia (CML) in chronic phase. The trial is ongoing and further data will be required 
to determine long -term outcome.  
• Adults with chronic, accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase Ph+ CML with 
resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib.  
• Adults with Philadelphia chromosome -positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) 
with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy.  
 
Commercially available D asatinib will be purchased for the purposes of this trial. Dasatinib will 
be supplied as 100 mg tablet white to off -white, biconvex, oval, film - coated with “BMS 100” 
debossed on one side and “852” on the other side.  This will be an open label study.  
 
 
1.2.2 Quercetin  
 
Quercetin is a flavonoid present in many fruits, vegetables, and grains and is also used as an 
ingredient in supplements, beverages, or various types of foods. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_293110] 5 mg and 40 mg per day, but intakes of 200 -500 mg/day are possible with high 
consumption of fruits and vegeta bles, especially when the peel is consumed. Quercetin has been 
safely used in amounts up to [ADDRESS_357390] as a food additive. Our anticipation of any risks of toxicity in

  CONFIDENTIAL  elderly postmenopausal women  who will receive this drug intermittently for only three 
consecutive days at a time (five total three -day dosing regimens)  is <1%. Quercetin phytosome 
dehydrate capsules equating to 1 ,000 mg total daily d osage will be administered for three 
consecutive days orally to  the elderly postmenopausal women  randomized to the D+Q  group. 
They will receive two capsules in the morning, two capsules in the evening.  This will be 
obtained commercially fr om the Thorne research company.   
 
Quercetin will be supplied as quercetin phytosome (sophora japonica concentrate (leaf) / 
phosphatidylcholine complex from Sunflower) 250 mg by [CONTACT_293143]. Quercetin 
Phytosome is a “00” hypromellose (vegetarian cellulose) capsule filled with a pale , yellow 
powder containing 250 mg quercetin phytosome. Microcrystalline cellulose, leucine, and silicon 
dioxide are added as manufacturing aids.  This will be an open label study.  
1.3 Preclinical Data  
Discovery of senolytics by [CONTACT_293144]’ heel of senescent cells: from transcriptome to 
drug identification . The class of small molecule drugs that can selectively induce death (or 
eliminate ) senescent cells are known as “senolytic(s)” – i.e., from the word “senescence” and 
“lytic” – destroying . Our colleagues in  the Kirkland laboratory and  Mayo Clinic Kogod Center 
on Aging discovered senolytic s including the combination of Dasatinib plus Q uercetin (D+Q) 
and F isetin (F)(31,34). Dasatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that is currently used for 
certain cancer treatments and has been approved for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia 
(CML). Dasatinib initially induces senescence followed by [CONTACT_293145]. Recent  work 
evaluating the effects of D asatinib against thyroid cancer cell lines in vitro  and in a xenograft 
model in vivo, demonstrated that Dasatinib -treated cells (BHP2 -7 and Cal62) exhibited a 
characteristic clumped appearance upon biopsy and most of these cells were classified as 
senescent using a common technique for assessing cellular senescence – i.e., the senescence -
associated β -Galactosidase (SA -β-Gal) assay. This work further showed that the average number 
of senescent cells per high powered field were: BHP2 -7, control 0/hpf; BHP2 -7, Dasatinib 
20/hp f; Cal62, control 0/hpf; Cal62 D asatinib 25/hpf. In addition, when these senescent cells 
were followed, they displayed necr otic features after 10 days of D asatinib treatment.

  CONFIDENTIAL  Senescent cell eradication (or reduction) 
by [CONTACT_17906] a drug -inducible “suicide” 
gene ( i.e., via p16INK4a-linked apoptosis 
through targeted activation of caspase 
[INK-ATTAC ]) can delay multiple age -
related phenotypes in both genetically 
modified  progeroid mice and natural, 
chronologically aged  mice(25,57). In 
subsequent studies, the Kirkland 
laboratory at Mayo Clinic screened 46 
agents/drugs that could theoretically 
induce apoptosis preferentially of 
senescent cells in vitro . They then 
evaluated these agents and different 
combinations to determine the specific 
subset of agents that were most effective 
at eliminating senescent cells(31). Dasatinib 
preferentially reduced viability and caused cell death in senescent human preadipocytes (also 
known  as mesenchymal stem cells [MSCs]), was much less effective on senescent human 
umbilical vein cells (HUVECs) ( Fig. 1A ). After three days of exposure, proliferating 
preadipocytes increased by 2 -5fold in number compar ed to day 0 in the presence of D asatinib. 
The viability of non -dividing senescent preadipocytes from the same human subjects decrease d 
by 30 -40% in the presence of D asatinib, thus demons trating a selective reduction.  
 
Another senolytic agent our colleagues in the Kirk land laboratory discovered was Q uercetin (Q), 
a naturally occurring flavonoid known to inhibit PI3Kinase, 
other kinases, and  mTOR pathways. In contrast to D asatinib, at 
low concentrations Q uercetin reduced the viability and caused 
cell death of senescent HUVECs to a greater extent than 
proliferating cells,  but was less effective on preadipocytes  (Fig. 
1B). The combination of D+Q displayed  selective killing of both 
senescent preadipocytes and endothelial cells  (Fig. 2 ). By [CONTACT_4475] 3, 
the viability of non -dividing senescent preadipocytes exposed to 
D+Q was reduced by ~70% compared to day 0, while non -
senescent, proliferating cells had increased by 2 -4 fold, 
establishing that the combination of D+Q selectively targets a 
broader range of senescent cell types then either agent alone, 
hence forming the basis of our hypothesis in our study in mice 
(see below). In a previous study published in collaboration with 
the Kirkland laboratory(31), it was shown that the combination of 
D+Q not only decreased the senescent cell burden in mice in 
vivo, but also improved functional improvements in running 
endurance in younger mice that were “aged” by [CONTACT_293146], a 
chemotherapeutic drug known to cause DNA damage and induce cellular senescence. In 
addition, it was demonstrated that intermittent D+Q administration alleviated age -related card iac 
and vascular dysfunction, improved gait in mice disabled exposing a limb to ionizing radiation ,

aging syndrome(31). These findings were later further supported by [CONTACT_293147] -related bone loss  (detailed 
below) . 
  
Identifying senescent cells in bone and the causal role of cellular senescence in age -related 
bone loss.  Our group recently found(7) in mice that with aging, a subset of cells of various 
lineages within the bone microenvironment become senescent and that some of these senescent 
cell populations develop a SASP. Importantly, we found similar results in bone biopsies from 
older vs younger  women(7), establishing that senescent cells are present at the time and location 
of age -related bone loss in 
humans, as they are in mice. 
To establish causality(27), we 
next used genetic ( INK-
ATTAC(25)) and 
pharmacological (D+Q(31)) 
approaches to target senescent 
cells and assessed their impact 
on age -related bone loss in old 
mice. As detailed in our 
publication(27) and as 
summarized in our recent 
reviews(58,59), the skeletal 
effects of intermittent D+Q 
therapy in old WT mice ( Fig. 
3 A-F) were virtually identical to those observed in the old INK-ATTAC mice treated with 
AP20187 (a synthetic drug that induces suicide transgene activation(25)), demonstrating that 
senescent cell clearance via either genetic or senolytic approaches prevents age -related bone loss. 
By [CONTACT_35707], we found that targeting senescent cells using genetic or senolytic 
approaches reduced bone resorption ( Fig. 3 D). Importantly, despi[INVESTIGATOR_293111], bone 
formation was either maintained (trabecular sites) or was higher (cortical sites; Fig. 3  E, F) 
following senescent cell clearance(27). Thus, from a therapeutic perspective, targeting senescent 
cells offers substantial advantages over conventional anti -resorptive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014](58) as the latter 
inhibit/eliminate osteoclasts to reduce bone resorption, with a concomitant reduction in bone 
formation due to coupling. By [CONTACT_22242], senolytic therapy reduces the senescent cell burden, 
which in turn suppresses bone resorption with either i ncreased (cortical bone) or maintained 
(trabecular bone) bone formation, leading to positive “bone balance”(27). The studies proposed in 
this application are aimed at translating these novel findings in mice to humans.  
Fisetin  is a senolytic that extends health - and lifespan and rescues senescent cell -induced bone 
loss. As noted earlier, F isetin ( F – 3,3’,4’,7 -tetrahydroxyflavone) is a member of the flavonoid 
family of naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds present in many fruits and vegetables with 
high concentrations in strawberries (160 µg/g)(42,43). To date, no adverse effects of F have been 
reported, even when taken at high doses(60). The hydrophobic nature of F allows it to penetrate cell 
membranes and accumulate in cells to exert its effects(49,52). In vitro studies in either senescent 
primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells or senescent primary murine embryonic fibroblasts 
demonstrate that F significantly reduced viability (causing apoptosis of 30 -70% of senescent cells)

  CONFIDENTIAL  and senescence biomarkers relative to vehicle(34,40). Notably, eliminating ~30% of senescent cells 
in INK-ATTAC  mice was sufficient to  alleviate multiple age -related conditions(25). In vivo  studies 
in both naturally aged WT mice and Ercc1-/∆ mice, which model human XFE progeria and display 
several features resembling accelerated aging within a lifespan of 6 months(61), demonstrated that 
F significantly reduced senescence biomarkers, while late -life intervention with F in old WT mice 
significantly extended lifespan(40). Similar findings were observed in human adipose tissue 
explants treated with F vs vehicle(40). F also extended healthspan  measured by a composite frailty 
score in the Ercc1-/∆ mouse model of accelerated aging(40), thus establishing beneficial effects of F 
on physical function and aspects of frailty. Finally, our more recent unpublished data in young 
adult (4 -month) WT mice transplanted with either relatively small numbers ( i.e., 106) of quiescent, 
non-senescent control cells or senescent cells ( Fig. 4), demonstrate that senescent cell 
transplantation causes significant bone loss that is rescued by [CONTACT_116604] F therapy ( Fig. 4 A-B).  
Collectively, these data in 
mice establish that reducing 
the senescent cell burden with 
senolytics has broad potential 
implications for osteoporosis 
and other chronic diseases of 
aging.  
Clinical Data to Date  
The senolytic drugs used in 
this study include  Dasatinib 
and Q uercetin. Dasatinib has 
previously been approved for 
the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) by [CONTACT_1622]. This proposal outlines a new 
indication for use and will be taken orally on an intermittent schedule (starting every 28 days) with 
no-therapy periods in between dosing regimens, repeat ed every 28 days over 20 weeks. More 
specifically, the oral treatment administration for each dosing regimen will be Dasatinib (D; 100 
mg daily for two consecutive days) plus Quercetin (Q; 1000 mg total daily for three consecutive 
days) taken orally on an intermittent schedule (starting every 28 days) with no-therapy periods in 
between dosing regimens, repeated every 28 days over 20 weeks, resulting in five total dosing 
regimens throughout the entire intervention.  
 
To our knowledge, there are no published studies utilizing D asatinib or Q uercetin or the 
combination of both drugs in the population of normal elderly postmenopausal women , 
independent of a diagnosis of CML. Dasatini b is a TKI  used as an oral daily treatment for CML 
with fewer side effects and improved survival compared to older treatment agents for this 
disease(62). Dasatinib is generally well -tolerated with the more common adverse effects consisting 
of rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, myelosuppression, fluid retention, and headache.

  CONFIDENTIAL  mg twice daily for more than 3 months and were followed for a median of 39 months. Amo ng the 
Dasatinib treated patients, only one of 99 patients developed acute kidney injury defined as a rise 
in serum creatin ine of 0.3 mg/dL. Among the 93 D asatinib -treated patients with normal baseline 
kidney function, the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) initially declined and then 
stabi lized after four  years. Among the six  Dasatinib -treate d patients with CKD (eGFR <60 
mL/min) at baseline, there were no si gnificant changes in eGFR over time within this relatively 
small group. The overall fi ndings were that long -term D asatinib -treated patients with normal 
baseline kidney function did experience a decline in eGFR but no association was found with 
development of acute kidney injury. Additionally, those with CKD at baseline did not experience 
any further decline in eGFR (f or either of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors studied).  
 
Dasatinib  (D) has rarely been associated with acute kidney injury among patients treated for 
leukemia. The injury may occur in the context of tumor lysis syndrome which is of minimal to 
no risk for CKD patients who lack the underlying hematological disease process. Amo ng patients 
treated for leukemia, available case reports also describe a variety of kidney lesions including: 
acute tubular necrosis from adverse effects such as gastroenteritis and nephrotic syndrome from 
thrombotic microangiopathy o ccurring in patients r eceiving D asatinib therapy(64-66). These events 
generally resolve with interruption of drug therapy and conservative management. Based on a 
case report and review by [CONTACT_293149] .(66), a possible mechanism for D asatinib -induced kidney 
injury is through inhibition of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway, 
a specific tyr osine kinase signaling pathway. However, there are no package insert recommended 
dosing adjustments for either kidney disease or reductions in kidney function for patients 
receiving D asatinib therapy.  
 
Quercetin (Q) is a natural -occurring flavonoid known to inhibit PI3Kinase, other kinases, and 
mTOR pathways. Quercetin is present in many fruits, vegetables, and grains and is also used as 
an ingredient in supplements, beverages, or various types of foods. Quercetin is a supplement 
and not FDA approved for any indication. The primary contraindication/warning for this drug is 
a hypersensitivity to Quercetin. Adverse effects associated with quercetin include emesis, 
dyspnea, and nephrotoxicity or kidney injur y. Kidney injury from this drug has not been 
substantiated in recent reports and overall appears safe in clinical application(67), and several 
studies involve use o f Quercetin for its anti -oxidative and anti -apoptotic effects in animal models 
of kidney disease, including diabetic nephropathy (DN). In fact, there are numerous preclinical 
studies in acute kidne y injury or DN suggesting that Q uercetin may reduce oxidative stress and 
improve kidney function(68-71). 
 
1.4 Dose Rationale  
Reducing the senescent cell burden with senolytics extends health - and lifespan in old 
mice(7,26,27,31,34 -41), and prevents age -related bone loss(7,27). The senolytics proposed in this 
application were discovered using a hypothesis -driven approach whereby [CONTACT_293150] -apoptotic 
pathways (SCAPs)(32,77) that defend senescent cells against their own pro -apoptotic 
environment(31). However, not all senescent cells are the same: they can originate from different 
cell types, express unique SASPs(78-80), and use different mechanisms to resist apoptosis(32,77). 
Intermittent D+Q or F therapy in old mice or young mice “aged” by [CONTACT_293151] 15.0 
 Revised 12/8/2023  
Page 13 of 46 
  CONFIDENTIAL  transplantation alleviates a range of age -related chronic conditions, including osteoporosis(27). 
Because senescent cells do not divide(1) and take at least weeks to re -accumulate(81) and because 
senolytics do not need to be continuously present to occupy a receptor or affect an enzyme(32,77), 
senolytic combinations, such as D+Q(31), and newer senolytics such as F(40), can be repurposed 
for immediate translation to humans. This premise is supported by a first -in-human pi[INVESTIGATOR_293114] D+Q therapy(82), showing that senolytics alleviated aspects of physical dysfunction 
in patients with IPF, a progressive, fatal cellular senescence -associated disease(36,83,84). This study 
provides “proof -of-concept” feasibility for targeting senescent cells in humans with senolytics to 
alleviate aspects of age -related diseases, and  supports additional studies evaluating senolytics for 
other chronic diseases of aging, such as osteoporosis.  
Dasatinib plus Quercetin (D+Q):  D is an FDA -approved TKI used clinically to treat 
hematologic disorders with a long -standing, acceptable safety profile(28,29). The oral dose of D 
(100 mg/d) selected is based on the FDA -approved dose for chronic therapy as effective for 
inducing apoptosis in human cancer cells. Follow -up analysis (5 -years ) from the phase III 
Dasatinib versus Imatinib Study in Treatment -Naïve Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) Patients 
trial(85), demonstrated long -term efficacy and safety of oral D (100 mg/d). In addition, in the TKI 
era (e.g., with daily D therapy) patients with CML have lifespans nearly as long as the general 
population(86). In contrast to the daily D regimen these patients receive, D therapy in our study 
will be administered intermittently (see below). The oral dose of Q (a natural product present in 
many fruits and vegetables(30)) selected is 1 000 mg/d (250 mg capsules x 4/d). Importantly, in the 
first-in-human pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] D+Q in patients with IPF(82), these doses of D+Q for 3 consecutive 
days over 3 consecutive weeks (9 total participant administered dosing days) at two separate U.S. 
clinical sites were well tolerated without notable changes in clinical chemistries or renal/hepatic 
function. Also, in a more recent study, we found that these doses of D+Q for 3 consecutive days 
demonstrated clearance of senescent cells in the skin and adipose tissue (87). Based on pre -clinical 
models, we believe that 2 doses of D along with 3 doses of Q will be equally e ffective, but a 
single dose of D may not be;  as such, we propose to use daily doses of D x2d and daily  doses of 
Q x3d in our study.  In our study, the D and Q doses will be the same, but the interval between 
dosing regimens will be longer (2 6 [Dasatinib] or 25 [Quercetin]  days off senolytic therapy 
between dosing regimens) vs the first -in-human study in IPF patients (4 days off senolytic 
therapy between dosing regimens)(82). Further, the study duration we propose is 20 total weeks to 
include a total of 5 participant dosing days administered intermittently (every 4 weeks , see 
Section 3, Study Design ). More specifically, the  two-consecutive day dosing days  for Dasatinib 
will be at Baseline (Day 1 , 2), start of Week 5 (D ay 29 , 30), start of Week 9 (D ay 57 , 58), start of 
Week 13 (Day 85 , 86), and start of Week 17 (D ay 113 , 114 ) for a total of ten days of Dasatinib  
over the course of the 20 -week study.  More specifically, the three -consecutive day dosing days 
for Quercetin will be at Baseline (Days 1 -3), start of Week 5 (Days 29 -31), start of Week 9 
(Days 57 -59), start of Week 13 (Days 85 -87), and start of Week 17 (Days 113 -115) for a total of 
15 days of  Quercetin  over the course of the 20 -week study.  
1.5 Risks and Benefits  
Based on the above (see Section 1.4 , Dose Rationale ), our anticipation of any toxicity risk in 
subjects receiving these compounds (D+Q) for only  two or three consecutive days followed by  [CONTACT_12697] 25 days of no therapy, every four  weeks over the course of 20 weeks, is <1%. Therefore, 
the potential benefits of intermittent senolytic administration to target senescent cells and thereby 
[CONTACT_293152] -related diseases in humans, as in

  CONFIDENTIAL  mice(7,26,27,31,34 -41), is considerable. Further, although not yet established, the senolytic proposed 
here and next  generation senolytics may have a better safety profile than existing pharmacologic 
options for osteoporosis prevention and treatment(88). The studies proposed herein will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_293115].  In addition, the risks of drawing blood include pain, bruising, lightheadedness, and/or 
fainting, or rarely, infection at the site of the needle stick.  Study subjects will be exposed  to low 
doses X -ray radiation during the dual -energy X -ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) and high-resolution 
peripheral quantitative computed tomography ( HR-pQCT ) scans. The amount of radiation has a 
low risk of harmful effects.  Based upon the review of the published literature and our pre -clinical 
as well as clinical data, we do not anticipate the occurrence of serious adverse events with any of 
the procedures or prescribed drug dosing regimen in this study. We have identified a variety of 
drug-drug interactions for which we est ablished exclusion criteria or modification plans to 
minimize associated risks. Therefore, the overall procedure risks and any risks of using either 
drug regimen are likely minimal compared to the anticipated benefits and the knowledge that 
may be gained f rom this clinical investigation.  
2 Study Objectives  
 
Primary Objective  
 
In a cohort of 60 older postmenopausal women, aged ≥60years , with a high senescent cell burden 
(as these individuals are most likely to benefit from pharmacological interventions that eliminate 
senescent cells – i.e., senolytics), we will test the efficacy of intermittent senolytic therapy 
(D+Q) as compared to non-interventional  therapy on improving serum bone resorption  markers 
over the course of 20 weeks.  
 
 
Secondary Objective  
 
In the same cohort of 60 older postmenopausal women, aged ≥60years , with a high senescent 
cell burden, we will further assess the impact of senolytics (D+Q) as compared to non- 
interventional therapy  on reducing systemic surrogate markers of senescent cell abundance and 
circulating senescence -associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors.

between doses, repeated every 28 days over 20 weeks, resulting in 15 total dosing days 
throughout the entire intervention . Our proposed intermittent dosing regimen is based on the 
following: i) effects of D+Q on various senescent cell types in culture(31,34,40); ii) our preclinical 
studies in which senolytics were administered monthly to naturally aged old WT mice ( Fig. 3); 
iii) senescent cell clearance from freshly isolated human tissue explants treated with D+Q(39) or 
F(40); iv) peak concentrations and the short elimination half -lives (<12 hrs .) of these senolytics in 
humans(89,90); and v) dose escalation studies using these senolytics in old mice and old Rhesus 
monkeys. Block randomization will be performed by [CONTACT_91724], [CONTACT_293177], 
M.S., to ensure balanced group assignment as the study proceeds. The first dose of each dosing 
regimen will be administered onsite by [CONTACT_293153], 
randomized subjects with a screw cap bottle(s) from the Mayo Clinic Research Pharmacy 
containing their group allocated the rapy (D+Q).  Throughout the study, all  subjects will be 
instructed to take 1000 IU of V itamin D (supplied to them)  and will be counseled to obtain total 
calcium intake of ~1200 mg/d.  At each visit, a fasting morning blood draw will be obtained. 
Subjects will be given a blank notebook for recording AEs that the study team will review and 
document at each visit. The pri mary study endpoints will be percent changes in serum bone 
turnover markers (amino -terminal propeptide of type I collagen [P1NP]  and C -terminal 
telopeptide of type I collagen [CTX]) from baseline over 20 weeks; changes in these markers 
over intermediate time points (weeks 4, 8, 12, 16) and changes in the P1NP/CTX ratio will be 
considered secondary endpoints. Additional secondary en dpoints will be patient reported quality 
of life, safety and tolerability and changes in the following from baseline to study endpoint: i) 
bone mineral density (BMD) by [CONTACT_751] -energy X -ray absorptiometry (DXA) at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050],

assay (in PBTL) for p16INK4a mRNA expression and at Baseline (Visit 2) they will undergo a test 
using an AGES reader. These tests will be analyzed in our  laboratory as we have  established 
criteria for determining the presence of significant cellular senescence. If there is absence of 
cellular senescence in the T cell assay, the subject will not undergo randomization. However, if 
the T cell assay does reveal cel lular senescence  (as depi[INVESTIGATOR_144625]. 6 ), then they will proceed to

  CONFIDENTIAL  randomization. The rationale for this selection is that senolytic drugs are unlikely to be effective 
in the absence of underlying cellular senescence.  
 
4.4 Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
4.4.1 When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
All subjects will be assessed during the three days of medication administration, and subsequent 
days of medication administration and all study visits. If a severe adverse event (SAE) occurs at 
any time during administration of the three -day drug regimen,  a formal review will occur and 
subsequent patients will be enrolled one at a time using the same regimen. If three or more 
events accrue, the study will be held and either a potential dosing regimen revisited or 
discontinuation of the study protocol will occur. Other interventions will be as per the direction 
of the Food and Drug Administration and Mayo Institutional Review Board.  
Study Completion:  
For each subject in the study, the end of study will be reached when treatment and post -treatment 
safety follow -up periods have been completed.  
Subject withdrawal:  
A subject may be withdrawn from the study prior to that subject completing all study - related 
procedures. Some reasons may include:  
• Subject safety issues  
• Failure of subject to adhere to protocol requirements  
• Subject decision to withdraw from the study (withdrawal of consent)  
Withdrawn subjects may not re -enter the study.  
 
Premature withdrawal from study:  
Subjects may voluntarily withdraw from the study for any reason at any time. Subjects are 
considered withdrawn if they state an intention to withdraw further participation in all 
components of the study, die, or are lost to follow -up for any other reason. The investigator may 
withdraw a subject from the study (without regard to the subject’s consent) if they believe that 
continued participation in the study would be contrary to the best interests of the patient.  
Subjects are considered as lost to follow -up if all reasonable attempts by [CONTACT_293156]. The investigator will take preventive measures to avoid a 
subject being lost to follow -up (e.g., document different ways of contact [CONTACT_293157], home address, e -mail address, person to be contact[CONTACT_293158]). If the subject cannot be reached, the investigator will make a reasonable effort to 
contact [CONTACT_74058], document all attempts a nd enter the loss of follow -up information into the 
Case Report Form (CRF). The following methods will be used: at least two telephone calls will 
be placed to the last available telephone number (each call on different days) and one registered 
letter will be sent by [CONTACT_215253]. If the subject is still unreachable 
after all contact [CONTACT_42927], he/she will be considered lost to follow -up. 
If premature withdrawal occurs for any reason, the reason for premature withdrawal from the 
study, along with who made the decision (subject, investigator) will be recorded in the CRF.

  CONFIDENTIAL  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Unanticipated Problems:  
When an adverse event has been identified, the study team will take appropriate action necessary 
to protect the study subject and then complete the Study Adverse Event Worksheet and log. The 
investigator will evaluate the event and determine the necessary follow -up and reporting 
required.  
Subject replacement:  
Subjects withdrawn from the study will be replaced by [CONTACT_293159] (age, sex, race, and T cell assay 
senescent cell positivity).  
4.4.2 Data Collection and Follow -up for Withdrawn Subjects  
 
• For withdrawn subjects not undergoing any study intervention, no additional follow -up 
will be done.  
• For withdrawn subjects receiving intervention (Dasatinib plus Quercetin) , for safety 
monitoring telephone contact [CONTACT_293160] 20 (Day 140) visit . No follow up 
phone call needed beyond four months , except to screen for malignancies at year [ADDRESS_357400]-study completion . It will be highly recommended that withdrawn subjects return for 
clinical blood (CBC, creatinine , etc. ) studies as part of safety monitoring. Research data 
will not be colle cted on subjects after they are withdrawn from the study . Any additional 
evaluation will be for subject safety only.  
• For those subjects in the intervention groups who are not tolerating the medication and 
considering withdraw, they will be given the option to continue in the study with intent to 
treat.  
5 Study Drug

  CONFIDENTIAL  5.2 Treatment Regimen  
 
1) Dasatinib is a Tyrosine Kinase I nhibitor  (TKI)  used to treat cancer, particularly 
Philadelphia chromosome -positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or Ph+ acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).  Dasatinib is currently FDA approved. Precautions 
include: cardiac adverse events, avoidance of use of H2 blockers and p roton pump 
inhibitors (affects D asatinib absorption), fluid retention, hemorrhage, myelosuppression, 
dermatologic reactions, and avoidance in pregnancy/breast feeding. The drug interferes 
with cytoc hrome P450 and may require drug adjustments to agents such as calcineurin 
inhibitors. Unlike standard treatment regimens for CML (lasting several months), this 
medication  will only be administered intermittently . Elimination half -life is < [ADDRESS_357402] ~2 -4 weeks.  
a. Dosing: Dasatinib in the form of Sprycel ® ([COMPANY_016]) 100 mg orally 
daily for two days, for ea ch of the five dosing courses; 10 total dosing days . One 
(100 mg) tabl et will be taken in the morning , for each dosing period . Thus, 
Dasatinib will be taken orally on an intermittent, one-day schedule (starting every 
27 days) with  26-day no-therapy periods in between dosing regimens, repeated 
every 28 days over 20 weeks, resulting in ten total dos ing day s throughout the 
entire intervention.  
2) Quercetin is a natural -occurring flavonoid known to inhibit PI3Kinase, other kinases, and 
mTOR pathways. Quercetin is present in many fruits, vegetables, and grains and is also 
used as an ingredient in supplements, beverages, or various types of foods. Quercetin is a 
supplement and not FDA approved for any indication. The recommended dose ranges 
from a total of 750 -1500 mg per day. The primary contraindication/warning is 
hypersensitivity to Quercetin. Listed drug interactions include: cyclosporine, digox in, and 
fluoroquinolones.  
a. Dosing: Quercetin de hydrate capsules (250 mg each) equating to 1000 mg total 
daily dosage will be administered orally for three consecutive days  for each of the 
five dosing periods ; 15 total dosing days . Two (250 mg) capsules will be taken 
each morning and two (250 mg) capsules will be taken in the evening for each of 
the three days, within each dosing period . Thus, Q uercetin will be taken orally on 
an intermittent, three consecutive day schedule (starting every 28 days) with  25-
day no-therapy periods in between dosing regimens, repeated every 28 days over 
20 weeks, resulting in five total three -day dosing regimens (15 total dosing days) 
throughout the entire intervention.  
5.3 Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Subjects who meet eligibility criteria and agree to take the assigned therapy for the entire study 
duration, will be randomized (using block randomization, as detailed below ) to one of t wo 
groups: i) Untreated control group ; ii) Dasatinib (D; 100 mg/d,  for two days,  Sprycel, Bristol 
Myers Squibb) plus Quercetin (Q; 1000 mg/d; 250 mg capsules x 4/d Quercetin Phytosome, 
Thorne Research) . As detailed above, therapy (D+Q) will be taken orally on an intermittent 
schedule (every 28 days) with no -therapy periods in between doses, repeated every 28 days over 
20 weeks.  Block randomization  (using blocks of four)  will be performed by [CONTACT_91724],   
M.S., to ensure balanced group assignment as the study proceeds. Subjects

above, the bottles will be prepared and d ispensed by [CONTACT_293163] a statement that these products are for investigational use only.  
5.8 Masking/ Blinding of Study  
In order to minimize the study bias, this study will use a process for randomized group 
assignment to either  the u ntreated control group  or to D+Q. Furthermore, the laboratories 
analyzing the collected samples and initial data will not have access as to which group  (Control, 
D+Q)  the samples came from . Since this is an open label study , the subject and study staff will 
be aware of which group they are in.

6.1 Visit 1 – Screening Visit  
A tabulated summary of all visits and assessments described in the following sections is provided 
in Table 1 . To the extent possible, subjects will be expected to adhere to the established visit 
schedule.  After discussing the study with the investigator/appropriate study staff and after 
agreeing to study participation by [CONTACT_44210], subjects will be assigned a subject 
number. For any subject, it is the responsibility of the investigator or study te am member to 
obtain written informed consent (subject’s signature) prior to performing any protocol -mandated 
assessment. However, assessments performed as part of the routine care of the subject may be 
used to assess eligibility. The subject numb er will identify the subject throughout the study. In

be lysed and RNA will be isolated. P16INK4a expression will be measured by [CONTACT_270674] -qPCR using Taq -
man primer -probe s, as done in Fig. 6 . 
 
Future Research Studies – Plasma & Cells:  
• Collection of plasma, serum, and cells from subjects will enable us to evaluate and answer 
pertinent questions related to the biology of aging and senescence. Studies utilizing these 
samples will allow us to gain a greater understanding of the pathophysiol ogy of accelerated 
aging and the potential for us to develop new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_293127]. An 
aliquot of 100 mL plasma/serum will be obtained from each subject at Baseline and End 
of Week 20 (Day 140). The specimens will be kept on ice and imm ediately transported to 
[CONTACT_293179]’s laboratory for processing and storage.  
6.9.3 Questionnaires : 
The Short Form (36) Health Survey will be administered to subjects  at each visit . This survey 
consists of 36 questions and eight scaled scores (vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general 
health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, 
and mental health).  The Geriatric Depression S cale is a 15 -item screening tool which can be used 
to identify depression in older adults.  This will be given at baseline and study end visits . If the 
GDS questionnaire  is indicative of depression (score ≥ 10), the study team will make the subject 
aware of this and contact [CONTACT_423]’s primary care provider.   If the subject does not have a 
primary care provider, then consultation with psychiatry will be offered. If there are concerns 
regarding acute suicidal risk, the study team will contact [CONTACT_293168].) , diarrhea and sleep disorders.   
The health interview includes questions about general health,  gynecological history,  social habits, 
and fall or fracture history and will be given at the baseline visit.   The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_293128] a 10 -item questionnaire that assesses self -report whole -body physical and mental tiredness

6.9.4 Skin AGEs Assessment : 
Skin AGEs will be assessed using the AGE Reader®.  This non -invasive method has a light source 
which illuminates a skin surface of approximately 4 cm2 on the volar side of the forearm. The 
device uses an excitation light source with peak intensity of approximately 370 nm to excite 
fluorescent moieties in the tissue (skin auto -fluorescence), which then will emit light of a different 
wavelength. In the used wavelength band, the major contribution in fluorescence comes from 
fluorescent AGEs linked mostly to collagen. Emission light and reflected excitation light from the 
skin are measured with a spectrometer in the 300 –[ADDRESS_357415] in postmenopausal women treated with β -blockers(93), we

groups. This calculation demonstrated that 30 subjects per group will provide the study with 90% 
power to detect a 19.8% difference in the bone resorption marker, CTX ( 17.1% with 80% 
power), based on a two -sample t-test. 
7.[ADDRESS_357416] deviations. Univariate descriptive statistics and 
frequency distributions will be calculated, as appropriate for all variables. Baseline values for 
demographic, clinical, and outcome variables (primary and secondary ) will be tabulated for the 
different  groups. Adherence to medication regimes will be described in terms of percent of 
medication taken (actual or reported ) for each group.  
 
Handling of Missing Data  
All participants who are randomized will be included in the primary efficacy analysis dataset. The 
analysis will follow the intent -to-treat (ITT) principle ( i.e., according to the treatment arm they are 
assigned to). For patients whose 20 -week CTX and P1NP measurements are missing, data will be 
imputed. For subjects missing the 2 0-week measur ement s, individual regression model s will be fit 
regressing each specific bone turnover marker (CTX or P1NP)  on time ( weeks ); 20-week  values 
will then be extrapolated b ased on these regression lines . 
 
 
Primary Hypothesis: In a cohort of 60 older postmenopausal women, aged ≥60years, with a 
high senescent cell burden (as these individuals are most likely to benefit from pharmacological 
interventions that eliminate senescent cells – i.e., senolytics), we hypothesize that intermittent 
senolytic therapy (D+Q) as compared to non-therapy will improve bone resorption  markers over 
the course of [ADDRESS_357417] for baseline factors, given t wo groups and 30 subjects per group, there is the possibility 
that randomization may not perfectly balance the subjects regarding  potential covariates, such as 
the baseline values of the respective response variables. A detailed analysis of ANOVA versus 
ANCOVA by [CONTACT_293169](95), concluded that for RCTs with pre - and post -intervention 
measurements, both methods are appropriate and unbiased, but the ANCOVA has more power 
and is therefore recommended. All randomized subjects will be included in the primary efficacy 
analysis, which will follow the intention -to-treat (ITT) principle; i.e., according to the treatment 
arm to which they were randomized. To optimize the sensitivity of the ITT analysis, every effort 
will be made to obtain follow -up data at [ADDRESS_357418] who disco ntinues the study at 
an earlier time point.

Page 33 of 46 
  CONFIDENTIAL  Secondary Hypothesis 1:  In the same cohort of 60 older postmenopausal women, aged 
>60years, with a high senescent cell burden, we hypothesize that intermittent senolytic therapy 
(D+Q) as compared to non-therapy  will reduce systemic surrogate markers of senescent cell 
abundance ( p16INK4a in PBTLs) and circulating senescence -associated secretory phenotype 
(SASP) factors.  
 
The Secondary Hypotheses will be tested using an ANCOVA model with treatment as a fixed 
effect and the baseline measurement as a covariate. For secondary exploratory analyses, a mixed -
effects model will be used to allow the treatment effect to vary across time and to include all 
subjects ( i.e., even those who did not contribute data at all time points). All subjects who receive 
any drug (D+Q) will be included in the safety and tolerability evaluations. Frequency tables will 
summarize AE occurrences by [CONTACT_273916] , though group differences are likely since the 
treatment arm is known to the subjects .  
 
7.[ADDRESS_357419] Population(s) for Analysis  
Analysis of the primary hypothesis will include subjects who have completed the final visit (at 
Week 20; Day 140), regardless of study drug adherence. Analysis of the secondary hypotheses 
will follow an intent -to-treat (ITT) model and will include all subj ects who have completed at 
least one follow -up visit following initial randomization, again regardless of drug adherence. 
Secondary analysis will include only those subjects who completed the entire study drug course 
and were seen at all visits.  
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
Safety evaluations will include adverse event (AE) and serious AE (SAE) reporting.  Adverse 
event reporting will be conducted throughout the study for all subjects.  The reporting period 
begins at the time of informed consent and continues through study completion.  Adverse events 
will be assessed at every visit  (except the screen visit)  by a “blinded” staff member .   
 
Definitions, documentation and reporting of AE’s are described in Section 8.1 -8.4. 
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845])  
Any unanticipated problem or adverse event that meets the following three criteria:  
• Serious : Serious problems or events that results in significant harm, (which may be 
physical, psychological, financial, social, economic, or legal) or increased risk for the 
subject or others (including individuals who are not research subjects). These include: ( 1) 
death; (2) life threatening adverse experience; (3) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] - inpatient, new, or 
prolonged; (4) disability/incapacity - persistent or significant; (5) birth defect/anomaly; (6) 
breach of confidentiality and (7) other problems, events, or new inf ormation (i.e. 
publications, DSMB reports, interim findings, product labeling change) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_293129], safety, or welfare of the subjects 
or others, or substantially compromise the research data , AND  
• Unanticipated : (i.e. unexpected) problems or events are those that are not already 
described as potential risks in the protocol, consent document, not listed in the 
Effects of Senolytics on Markers of Aging and Bone Metabolism

Page 34 of 46 
  CONFIDENTIAL  Investigator’s Brochure, or not part of an underlying disease. A problem or event is 
"unanticipated" when it was unforeseeable at the time of its occurrence. A problem or 
event is "unanticipated" when it occurs at an increased frequency or at an increased 
severity than expected, AND  
• Related : A problem or event is "related" if it is possibly related to the research procedures.  
 
 
Adverse Event  
An untoward or undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product (i.e. drug, 
device, biologic) in a patient or research subject.  
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  Serious problems/events can be well 
defined and include : 
• death  
• life threatening adverse experience  
• hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• inpatient, new, or prolonged; disability/incapacity  
• persistent or significant  disability or incapacity  
• birth defect/anomaly  
and/or per protocol may be problems/events that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_37021] -investigator  
may have adversely affected the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or 
substantially compromised the research data.  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious , should be regarded as non-
serious adverse events . 
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
For this study, the study treatment follow -up period is defined as [ADDRESS_357420] 
administration of study treatment.   
 
Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is pres ent at the start of the study. A preexisting condition 
should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the 
condition worsens during the study period.  
 
General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting 
condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that 
meet the definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and docum ented as an adverse 
event.   
 
Post-study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_456] -investigator until the events are 
resolved, the subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse  event is otherwise explained. At the last 
scheduled visit, the sponsor -investigator should instruct each subject to report , to the sponsor -

  CONFIDENTIAL  investigator, any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, 
believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if the abnormality 
changes from a value within the normal range before treatment to one outside or worse than the 
normal range after treatments.  A clinical laboratory abnormality will also be documented as an 
adverse event if the abnormality meets the definition of an SAE or requires the subject to have the 
investigational product discontinued or interrupted or requires the subject to receive specific 
corrective therapy. Such changes will prompt a repeat test, telephone call to check on the subject’s 
status, a repeat visit and/or referral to the subject’s primary care physician. For example, t he subject 
will receive specific corrective therapy if th eir Vitamin D level is <20ng/mL, as described in  
Section 4.2, Exclusion Criteria .   In the event that a subject experiences an elevated liver function 
test (AST, ALT, ALP, and/or bilirubin) greater than 2 -fold over their screening/baseline 
measurement, dosing with Dasatinib should be halted and the subject will continue in the trial and 
complete the study assessments including laboratory assessments. Additional treatment and 
continued participation will be at the discretion of study investigators.

this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event 
if the condition meets the criteria for an adverse event.   
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an 
adverse event in the following circumstances:  
 
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_293130]:  
• A visit to the emergency department or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] <24 hours, that does 
not result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event).  
• Elective surgery planned prior to signing consent.  
• Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure.  
• Routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status ( e.g., 
routine mammogram).  
• Medical or surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry 
into the study. Appropriate documentation will be obtained in these cases.

This will be reported to the FDA on FDA Form 3500A no later than 15 calendar days after the 
sponsor -investigator’s initial receipt of the information about the event.  
 
The sponsor -investigator must also notify the FDA (and sponsors must notify all participating 
investigators) in an IND safety report of potential serious risks, from clinical trials or any other 
source, as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 cal endar days after the sponsor determines 
that the information qualifies for reporting under § 312.32(c)(1)(i) -(iv). 
 
Findings from other studies in human or animals that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed 
to the drug will be reported.  This will be reported to the FDA on FDA Form 3500A, no later than 
15 calendar days after the sponsor -investigators initial rece ipt of the information about the event.  
8.4 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]  
• All patients will be assessed during the 20 weeks of study drug administration (D+Q) and 
during each study visit following administration of each cycle of drugs. If a severe 
adverse event occurs at any time during administration of the drug regimen, a form al 
review will occur and subsequent patients will be enrolled one at a time using the same 
regimen. If three or more severe adverse events accrue, the study will be held and either a 
potential dosing regimen revisited , or discontinuation of the study proto col will occur. 
Other interventions will be as per the direction of the Mayo IRB .  If any elevations were 
to be noted (>2x the normal level), the study participant would stop treatment and have 
levels re -drawn in a month, per the clinical judgement of the investigator.

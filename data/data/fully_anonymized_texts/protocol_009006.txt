Version 9/22/2017  2 Title: Comparison of Programmed Intermittent Epi[INVESTIGATOR_305883]:  
Labor pain during childbirth is regarded as one of the most painful experiences in a woman’s life 
with the poten tial to cause lasting emotional and psychological effects. Childbirth has also been 
associated with the development of chronic pain with the prevalence of between 4 -10% after 
cesarean section and 6 -18% after vaginal delivery (1). Hence, effective management of labor 
pain is instrumental in preventing the development of life altering chronic pain i n women of 
childbearing age. Maintaining epi[INVESTIGATOR_305884] -term 
outcomes (2). Historically, maintenance  of epi[INVESTIGATOR_305885] -
administered bolus injections, patient controlled epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187] (PCEA) and continuous 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_76250] (CEI) with or without PCEA for breakthrough pain or discomfort (3). CEI has 
been shown to provide consistent analgesia in addition to improved patient satisfaction and 
reduced workload for the anesthesia providers. However, CEI is associated with greater local 
anesthetic consumption and increased maternal motor blockade (3). Increased motor block is 
associated with reduced mobility, decreased pelvic muscle tone and impaired ability for the 
parturient to adequately Valsalva during the second stage of labor (4). Motor blockade is also 
associated with increased incidence of shoulder dystocia and instrumen tal deliveries, which 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_305886]. Achieving adequate analgesia during labor, 
without compromising motor function is critical for optimizing both short -term and long -term 
outcomes for the mother and the neonate.  
 
A more novel approach to labor analgesia involves the administration of small, programmed 
intermittent epi[INVESTIGATOR_44198] (PI[INVESTIGATOR_305887]) with PCEA dosing for breakthrough pain. Preliminary 
studies have indicated that PI[INVESTIGATOR_305888] a superior method of labor analgesia  compared to 
current standard of care, CEI. A randomized double -blind study by [CONTACT_9376]. compared CEI 
and PI[INVESTIGATOR_305889]. Results suggested that the cohort receiv ing PI[INVESTIGATOR_305890], had similar analgesia and improved patient satisfaction when compared with CEI 
(3). Additionally, a subsequent study by [CONTACT_305929], term, nulliparou s 
women in spontaneous labor, extending the PI[INVESTIGATOR_305891], PCEA requests or rescue analgesia requirements without increasing 
patient discomfort or compromising satisfaction (5). Two subsequent studies allocating women 
to receive e ither PI[INVESTIGATOR_305892] (6,7) . 
 
Version 9/22/2017  3 Our group has recently performed a systematic review and meta -analysis of studies comparing 
the effects of labor analgesia with either PI[INVESTIGATOR_305893] . 
The meta -analysis included 9 studies and evaluated various primary outcomes including: patient 
satisfact ion, required manual anesthesia interventions, labor progression and mode of delivery 
(vaginal, instrumental or cesarean delivery). Secondary outcomes included:  degree of motor 
blockade, degree of sensory blockade, time to first anesthetic intervention, l ocal anesthetic dose 
delivered per hour, pruritus, shivering, maternal fever, nausea and vomiting, neona tal Apgar 
scores at 1 minute and 5 minutes, and umbilical artery and vein pH (8). PI[INVESTIGATOR_305894], decreased required 
anesthetic interventions, and an improvement in maternal satisfaction in comparison to laboring 
women receiving CEI. Pooled results indicated that PI[INVESTIGATOR_305895], but there was a statistically significant [ADDRESS_374383] statistically 
significant differences in cesarean delivery rate or required anesthetic intervention between CEI 
and PI[INVESTIGATOR_305887] (8). There were several limitations to these preliminarily studies. While, each of the [ADDRESS_374384] studies only involved nulliparous women, 
which may limit the ability to apply results to multiparous women. Furthermore, many of these 
studies involved the use of two pump s, one to deliver CEI or PEIB and another to deliver PCEA 
in a research setting, or involved the use of non -commercially available research pumps (3).  
 
Currently the CADD solis v 3.[ADDRESS_374385] of care since 
March 2015 (9). This new pump differs from those used i n the preliminary studies, which 
utilized a two -pump approach to administer PI[INVESTIGATOR_305896]. 
Preliminary studies have not identified optimal PI[INVESTIGATOR_305897], bolus volumes, lock out intervals, 
or drug concentrations, which represen ts a gap in literature at the present time. Our group 
performed a retrospective study to explore whether PI[INVESTIGATOR_305898], 
PCEA use and rescue analgesia in comparison to CEI in laboring women. Our group also 
assessed whether PI[INVESTIGATOR_305899], which serves as an impediment to the progression of labor (9). The study divided 
patients into three groups. The first received CEI 5mL/hour, the second received PI[INVESTIGATOR_305887] 5mL 
every [ADDRESS_374386] u sed PI[INVESTIGATOR_305900] 3mL every 30 min. Each group had access to PCEA set to 5 
mL boluses with an 8 -minute lockout period and maximum of 35mL per hour (9). The results of 
the study did not suggest what we expected as the study revealed no statistically significant 
difference bet ween the LA consumption, amount of motor blockade or mode of delivery for 
patients receiving CEI or PEIB when using the single pump system instead of two -pump system 
employed by [CONTACT_48347]. However, this study did suggest patients who received PI[INVESTIGATOR_305901] 3mL every 30 minutes used a lower PCEA volume than patients receiving CEI. Patients 
Version 9/22/2017  4 receiving PEIB regimens had more attempts/PCEA given than the CEI patients and the PI[INVESTIGATOR_305887] 
3ml/30 minute group had more unsuccessful PCEA attempts/hour than CEI recipie nts.  
 
Our study, unlike prior studies comparing PI[INVESTIGATOR_305902]. CEI with PCEA, used more concentrated 
solutions consisting of double the concentration and half the volume of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. One of our 
speculations is that larger boluses of a more dilute LA may have  improved dissemination in the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_305903] (9).  Our study interpreted PCEA attempts/given and 
the number of unsuccessful PCEA attempts/hour as reflections of patient pain or discomfort, as 
an attempt is interpreted as an effort to achiev e better pain relief (9). Another way to interpret the 
aforementioned PCEA attempts is as representation of the amount of time a patient “locked out” 
or prevented from receiving additional boluses of PCEA. Hence, a limitation of this study is the 
fact that patient sati sfaction scores were not collected as they could help distinguish whether 
attempts reflect the lockout period or inadequate analgesia (9). Other limitations of our 
retrospective study include the fact that explicit instructions about how to properly use the PCEA 
was no t standardized, and the fact that patient satisfaction or pain scores were not garnered due 
to the study’s retrospective nature (9). Probably one of the most significant limitations of our 
study was the fact that patients were not randomized to treatment groups. Hence,  the providers 
chose the analgesia received (9).  On the other hand, another retrospective study utilizing a more 
dilute concentration of local anesthetic reported reduced need for physician interventions with 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_305904]. We have recently switched the local a nesthetic in our practice from 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.125 % to a more dilute concentration of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.1% mixed with fentanyl 2 
mcg/ml (10).  We therefore aim to prospectively study if the use of PI[INVESTIGATOR_305905] a regimen using CEI.  
 
Purpose of the study:  
The aim of this study is to compare two modes of epi[INVESTIGATOR_305906], PI[INVESTIGATOR_305907], in the treatment of labor pain. Our  primary outcome will be the volume of 
local anesthetic received through PCEA  per hour . Secondary outcomes will measure the total 
required local anesthetic required per hour, time to first PCEA bolus, labor pain scores, degree of 
motor blockade, mode of de livery, PCEA attempts and ratio of successful to unsuccessful 
attempts, frequency of hypotension, duration of first and second stages of labor and level of 
patient satisfaction.  
 
Study design and recruitment:  
The study will be a blinded randomized, contr olled trial comparing the two regimens for labor 
analgesia that are currently used as standard of care at our institution: a patient will be assigned 
to receive either delivery of epi[INVESTIGATOR_305908] 0.1 % with fentanyl 2mcg/mL with 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_305887] + PCEA dosing method or CEI + PCEA dosing method. Potential participants will be 
recruited from the Duke University Birthing Center as they are admitted for labor with intention 
for vaginal delivery.

Study Method:  
After obtaining Duke University Institutional Review Board approval and informed consent, 
nulliparous  or multiparous women in labor and cervical dilation between 2 -7 cm desiring 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_305911]. Subjects will be a llocated 
to a study arm (CEI or PI[INVESTIGATOR_305887]) by [CONTACT_22123] -generated, random assignment placed in sealed 
opaque envelopes.  
 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_305912] L3/4 or L4/[ADDRESS_374387] expe riences an inadvertent dural puncture during epi[INVESTIGATOR_305913], she will be removed from the study. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_305914] a solution of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.1% with fentanyl 2 mcg/ml. After the initial epi[INVESTIGATOR_305915] 20 mL is administered in incremental fashion, patients will receive either 6 mL 
every 45 minutes in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_305916] (first bolus 30 minutes after epi[INVESTIGATOR_211747]) or 8mL/hr of 
continuous infusion beginning immediately after the loading dose for the mainte nance of 
analgesia in the CEI arm, both of which are standard of care at our institution.  All study 
participants will be provided with PCEA set to 8mL boluses with a10 -minute lockout period. 
The maximum amount of PCEA analgesia will be set to a [ADDRESS_374388] of care.  If the parturient does not achieve adequate 
Version 9/22/2017  6 analgesia with a pain score  ≤ [ADDRESS_374389] 20 minut es, physician boluses 
will be administered using 5 ml of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0. 2  % every [ADDRESS_374390] adequate analgesia after  10 ml ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.2%, the catheter will be considered 
unsatisfactory if there is no bilateral sensory leve l at this stage and the patient will be removed 
from the study.  If there is bilateral sensory level to at least T10 after the ropi[INVESTIGATOR_305917], 
and the patient complains of pre ssure, fentanyl  100 mcg will be given epi[INVESTIGATOR_232917]. If the patient 
does not ac hieve a pain score ≤ [ADDRESS_374391] -partum to assess for any adverse effects .  
 
The primary endpoint will be the total volume of local anesthetic received through PCEA per 
hour. Secondary outcomes will include need for physician interventions  per hour, volume of 
clinician boluses required per hour, PCEA attempts per hour, PCEA boluses gi ven per hour, 
unsuccessful PCEA attempts per hour, ratio of attempts/giver per hour and motor blockade 
measured by [CONTACT_305930], frequency of hypotensive events, 
mode of delivery, labor pain scores and patient satisfaction.  
 
Statistical Analysis:  
Data from a pi[INVESTIGATOR_305918] (SD) PCEA volume used per hour was 6 (3) ml 
with CEI and 4 (3) ml with PI[INVESTIGATOR_305887]. A sample size of [ADDRESS_374392] an 80 % 
power at alpha=0.[ADDRESS_374393] 60 completed patients per group.  Randomization will 
be stratified according to parity ( nullipara or multipara ).  Continuous data will  be analyzed using 
kruskal wallis t est or t test as appropriate. Categori cal data will be analyzed using Chi -square test 
or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate .

Data Storage & Confidentiality:  
Study records will remain con fidential as required by [CONTACT_2371]. Federal Privacy regulations ensure 
privacy, security and authorized access. Patient identifiers including but not limited to name, 
social security number, address, and telephone number will not be disclosed outside of the Duke  
University Health System (DUHS).  For records shared with parties outside of DUHS, patients 
will receive a unique code number. The key to the code will be kept in a locked file in [CONTACT_305931]’s office.  
 
Data Integrity:  
The data will be housed on the Depart ment of Anesthesia’s Parnassus server and the PI, and 
study team members will have access to the study data.  
 
Data monitoring:  
Data will be monitored closely for the occurrence of adverse events (AE) and reported to the IRB 
as needed. If unanticipated AEs  or if expected events appear to be occurring more frequently 
than expected, those AEs will be explored per treatment arm.  
 
In accordance with federal regulations, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_147427], review, and promptly report to 
the IRB, appropriate institutional o fficials, sponsor, coordinating center and the appropriate 
regulatory agency head all unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others that occur 
in the course of a subject’s participation in a research study (45 CFR 46.103(b)(5)(i) and 21 CFR 
56.108(b)(1)), all AE reports will be reported per the DUHS IRB policies.  
 
Benefit / Harm Assessment:  
 
The will be no benefit to subjects from participating in the study, since standard of care regimens 
will be used in this study. The information gained f rom the study will help elucidate if PI[INVESTIGATOR_305919]. Risks of epi[INVESTIGATOR_305920].  Preliminary s tudies to date have 
not show n any diffe rence in  risks  with PI[INVESTIGATOR_305921].

Aim 3 : Determine the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of the adapted Function -Focused Care 
intervention in subsidized housing residents at high risk for nursing home admission.  We will conduct a 
2-month pi[INVESTIGATOR_699055] -Focused Care intervention in [ADDRESS_949115] study design to examine the change in outcome measures from 
baseline to 2 months. Implementation outcomes will include feasibility  and acceptability . Preliminary 
effectiveness outcomes will include resident function (primary outcome), with secondary outcomes of quality of 
life and health care utilization. Because function declines over time, our design will inc orporate a waitlist 
control, in which half of the sites  are cluster  randomized to receive the intervention in months [ADDRESS_949116] period will provide a baseline rate of functional decline that will serve as a comparison for 
functional outcomes (see Figure 3 for study flow).  
Study setting and population : We will pi[INVESTIGATOR_699056]  15 subsidized apartment buildings for older 
adults . 
Eligibility : Residents living at any of the sites will be invited to participate . If a resident wishes to participate but 
does not pass consent verification,67 they will be asked to sign an assent to participate, and a proxy will be 
contact[CONTACT_699059]. Residents will 
receive sequential $50 incentives for participation at baseline, 3, 
and 6 months (i.e., up to $150 total).  
Intervention:  The intervention will be based on the  extensively -
tested Function -Focused Care  intervention. Function -Focused 
Care is an approach to care that educates home care workers in 
how to help older adults to participate in functional and physical 
activity throughout the day .42 It includ es the following 4 steps:  (1) 
environmental and policy assessments; (2) education; (3) 
establishing resident service plans; and (4) ongoing mentoring 
and motivating for home  care workers and residents  (Table 2) . 
While Function -Focused Care for assisted living educat es home 
care workers ,[ADDRESS_949117] 3 months of the intervention and 8 hours per week for the next 3 months. To 
ensure that the intervention can be sustained over  time, we will work with each site to identify a staff 
“champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]” who will work with the nurse to learn how to maintain this approach. Working with the champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], 
the nurse will implement the 4 steps of the intervention (Table 2). As noted above, the approach for each step 
may be adapted based on stakeholder feedback, e.g., to incorporate family caregivers. Steps will be 
implemented sequentially and continue throughout the intervention, including ongoing mentorship and 
motivation for residents and caregivers. This will include observing caregiver performance, giving positive 
encouragement for providing Functi on-Focused Care, and reinforcing benefits of the intervention. Mentorship 
will occur in -person.  
Table 2. Component  Description of the intervention  
I: Environmental 
and policy 
assessments  Site champi[INVESTIGATOR_699057]. 
Findings are used to identify and recommend feasible interventions to alter the environment, policy , and 
procedures to optimize resident function and physical activity (e.g., make pleasant walking areas ) 
II: Education  Research nurse educates housing staff (e.g., service coordinators), residents, and families in principles of 
Function -Focused Care  (FFC) , using established  materials and adult  learning techniques.  
III: Establishing 
goals  Research nurse works with residents  to complete Capability Assessments /Goal Attainment Forms with 
eligible resident s. Goals established based on assessments and resident input.  
IV: Mentoring and 
motivating  Research nurse works to motivate residents  to participate in  FFC throughout study  period by [CONTACT_699060] -based approaches (e.g., observing performance of caregivers and providing one -on-one 
mentoring to incorporate FFC into routine care; providing positive reinforcement for incorporating FFC)  
Waitlist control : At the waitlist control site, residents will be screened for risk of nursing home admission and 

enrolled as described in Aim 2 . Residents  will be referred for whatever services are customary per usual facility 
protocols  based on results of these screenings, but f or the next 2 months, will not be enrolled in the Function -
Focused Care intervention . 
Outcome measures:  Outcomes are shown in Table 3. Measures will be collected at baseline and [ADDRESS_949118] control site  (i.e., 2 months after intervention initiation  at the control 
site). Measures correspond to the  outcome domains assessed in the original Function -Focused Care trial35 and 
were selected because they have well -established validit y and reliability. Measures of feasibility  will includ e 
standard measures of  recruitment, retention, and refusal . We will assess intervention fidelity  once per resident 
by [CONTACT_699061] a fidelity c hecklist .[ADDRESS_949119], including a primary 
outcome of functional status and secondary 
outcomes of quality of life, depression, and health 
care utilization. We will measure function using 2 
measures. The Short Physical Performance Battery 
(SPPB) is an objective measure of lower extremity 
functioning in older adults which has excellent 
reliability, validity , and responsiveness (range, 0 -12 
points ).80,92 We will also measure self-reported ability 
to perform  8 ADLs  using the Yale ADL scale  (range, 
0-16).68-71 We will assess quality of life using the 
Quality of Life in Alzheimer’s  Disease (QOL -AD) 
scale81 and depression using the Patient Health 
Questionnaire (PHQ -9).82 Health care utilization will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_6270] -report. Other outcomes will 
include adverse events and attitudes about function 
and physical activity (see Table 3).83-87 Home  care 
worker outcomes  will include knowledge88 and attitudes about Function -Focused Care87 and job satisfaction.89 
For family c aregivers, outcomes will include quality of life,90 depression,82 and caregiver burden.91 
Analysis plan and power calculation:  We will analyze measures of feasibility using similar  methods to Aim 2. 
We will define the intervention as feasible if residents complete ≥75% of checklist items . For other outcome s, 
we will assess change from baseline to [ADDRESS_949120] 
groups. For continuous outcomes, the change will also be continuous; for dichotomous outcomes, the change 
can be defined as a four -category variable ([ADDRESS_949121] outcomes ). We will then 
compare the change between intervention and waitlist groups  using the t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank sum test 
for continuous variables and Chi-square or Fischer’s exact  test for dichotomous variables.  
 Because this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_8688], the sample size need only be large enough to determine key 
parameters such as recruitment, retention, and refusal rates. Given the pool of potential participants, we are 
confident that we can recruit enough partic ipants to not only determine feasibility but also determine point 
estimates and standard deviations for projected sample size for a follow -up randomized controlled trial. We 
plan to recruit a total of [ADDRESS_949122] 80% power (2 -sided alpha of 0.05) to detect a 0.66 SD change in 
the mean of continuous measures from baseline to 2 months , assuming a 20% dropout . Thus, for our primary 
outcomes, we should have sufficient power to detect a mean 1.78-point  increase in SPPB  score 
(SD~2.7)91 and a mean 1.45-point  increase in ADL/IADL score (SD~2.2).76 
 
Potential problems and alternative approaches: Potential problems  include staff turnover, resident loss to 
follow -up, and a relatively limited sample size and follow -up period . We will train new staff and champi[INVESTIGATOR_699058] s to minimize loss to follow -up, including obtaining multiple types of contact [CONTACT_699062]. Also, our implementation protocol will incorporate 
stakeholder input on barriers and facilitators to implementation identified in Aim 1 . Although this pi[INVESTIGATOR_297536] 
a limited sample size, it will provide preliminary data to support a definitive R01 -level study.

OVERALL RATIONALE FOR REVISED PROTOCOL 12:
The primary purpose of this revised protocol is to cl ose the future enrollment in Part 3 and Part 5 
and removal of Part 4 and Part 6 from the protocol study desi gn. At the time of Amendment 13, 
preliminary data from an init ial cohort of subjects in this study suggested a signal of potential 
efficacy (ORR of 24% [7/ 29]) in recurrent or metastatic SCCHN subjects with disease progression 
on or after platinum-based therapy. Subsequent  efficacy analysis of a dditional SCCHN subjects 
treated with the combination of lirilumab and nivo lumab did not demonstrate a differential efficacy 
signal as compared to nivolumab monotherapy treatment in a s imilar population of SCCHN 
subjects. Therefore, with Revised Protocol 12, e nrollment in Parts [ADDRESS_399015] been updated to align with the protocol section changes listed 
below.

SYNOPSIS
Clinical Protocol CA223001
Title of Study: Protocol CA223001: A Phase 1/2 Study of the Combination of Lirilumab (Anti-KIR) Plus Nivolumab
(Anti-PD-1) or Lirilumab Plus Nivolumab and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_323304](s), Dose and Mode of Administration, and Duration of Treatment with Investigational
Product(s): Subjects will receive intravenous (IV) doses of lirilumab (BMS-986015) ev ery 4 weeks (Q4W),
nivolumab (BMS-936558) every 2 weeks ( Q2W), ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (BMS-734016) every 6 weeks (Q6W), and/or placebo
for lirilumab Q4W until the end of the defined treatment period for the applicable study part.
Study Phase: 1/2
Research Hypothesis:
Please note that the Dose Escalation and Cohort Expansion (P art 1) and the Squamous C ell Carcinoma of the Head 
and Neck (SCCHN) Cohort Expansion (Part 2) have both completed enrollment and not applicable starting with 
Amendment 13 and all subsequent amendments or revised protocols. For preliminary safety and efficacy results, see Section 1  “Clinical Experience with Lirilumab and Nivolu mab Combination Treatment” of the protocol  body. With 
Revised Protocol 12, Parts 3 and 5 are closed to enrollment and Parts 4 and 6 are removed.
•The Dose Escalation and Cohort Expansion (Part 1; Completed) and the SCCHN Cohort Expansion 
(Part 2; Completed) : It is anticipated that the combination of ant i-killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors
(KIR) antibody (lirilumab) and anti-programmed cell death 1 (anti-PD-1) antibody (nivolumab) will demonstrate
adequate safety and tolerability at pharmacologically r elevant doses and suggest preliminary signs of clinical 
activity so as to permit further clinical testing.
•The SCCHN Randomized Cohorts (Part 3 - closed to enrollment) : It is anticipated that treatment with 
nivolumab alone or in combination with lirilumab will lead to clinically  meaningful tumor reductions, as 
measured by [CONTACT_20363] (ORR), in subjects with platinum-refractory recurrent or metastatic SCCHN
who are programmed cell death ligand 1-positive (PD-L1 +) (PD-L1+ is defined as  PD-L1 expressed in ≥1% of 
tumor cells).
•The Signal Detection Cohort Expansion (Part 4) : Removed with Revised Protocol 12.
•The Signal Detection in SCCHN with Lirilumab, Nivolumab, and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_90843] (Part 5 - closed 
to enrollment): It is anticipated that the triplet regimen of anti -KIR antibody (lir ilumab), anti-PD-1 antibody 
(nivolumab), and anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) antibody (ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]) to treat subjects with 
platinum-refractory recurrent or metastatic SCCHN will demonstrate ade quate safety and tolerability at 
pharmacologically relevant doses for further clinical testing.
•The Signal Detection in Previously Untreated Metas tatic Melanoma (MEL) with Lirilumab, Nivolumab, 
and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_90843] (Part 6) : Removed with Revised Protocol 12.
Primary Objective:
•The Dose Escalation and Cohort Expansion (P art 1; Completed) and the SCCHN Cohort Expansion 
(Part 2; Completed): To assess the safety and tolerability of lirilumab given in combination with nivolumab and 
to identify dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination in subjects 
with advanced (metastatic and/or unresectable) solid tum ors. To assess the safety and preliminary anti-tumor 
activity of the combination of lirilumab and nivolumab in subjects with advanced solid tumors.
•The SCCHN Randomized Cohorts (Part 3 - closed to enrollment): To estimate the ORR of lirilumab given in 
combination with nivolumab  in subjects with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN that has r elapsed or progressed 
within [ADDRESS_399021] dose of a platinum-containing therapy and whose tumors express PD-L1.
•The Signal Detection Cohort Expansion (Part 4): Removed with Revised Protocol 12. 
•The Signal Detection in SCCHN with Lirilumab, Nivolumab, and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_90843] (Part 5 - closed 
to enrollment): To assess the safety and preliminary anti-tum or activity of the combination of lirilumab with 
nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_323305]-refractory recurrent or metastatic SCCHN.
•The Signal Detection in Previously Untreated MEL with Lirilumab, Nivolumab, and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251564] (Part 6): Removed with revised Protocol 12.

Safety lead-in : Initially approximately 10 subjects will be enrolled in the Signal Detection in SCCHN with Lirilumab, 
Nivolumab, and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_90843] (Part 5). Any findings will be discussed between the BMS Medical Monitor 
and investigators and an agreement will be r eached as to whether a lower dos e or an alternate dose schedule should 
be examined or whether any additional treatment guidelin es should be implemented prior to enrollment of additional 
subjects on study.
Following each treatment cycle (for all assigned treatments), the d ecision to treat a subject with additional cycles of 
study therapy will be based on tumor assessment (evaluation performed between Days [ADDRESS_399027] udy parts except the Signal D etection in SCCHN with Lirilumab, 
Nivolumab, and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_90843] [Part 5], which is performed Q8W and completed before study therapy is 
continued. Treatment decisions related to subject management will be based exclusively on irRECIST for the Dose 
Escalation and Cohort Expansion (Part 1; completed) and the SCCHN Cohort Expansion (Part 2; completed) (see 
protocol body Section 1.4.14 for the rationale and Appendix 2 for definitions); with Amendment 13, all other st udy 
parts will use only RECIST v1.1 (see protocol body  Sections 3.1.3 , 3.1.4 , 3.1.5 , and 3.1.6 for details). 
Subjects will generally be allowed to continue study therapy until the first occurrence of any of the following: 
a) Achievement of irCR-confirmed (the Dose Escalation and Cohort Expansion [Part 1; completed] and the SCCHN 
Cohort Expansion [Part 2; completed]) or CR-confirmed  the Signal Detection in SCCHN with Lirilumab, 
Nivolumab, and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_90843] [Part 5]).
b) Completion of a maximum of up to 2 years of the study treatment; 12 cycles in Parts 1, 2 and 3, and 8 cycles in 
Part 5. 
c) irPD (the Dose Escalation and Cohort Expansion [Part 1; completed] and the SCCHN Cohort Expansion [Part 2; 
completed]) or PD confirmed or unconfirmed (t he SCCHN Randomized Cohorts [Part 3], and the Signal 
Detection in SCCHN with Lirilumab, Nivolumab, and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_90843] [Part 5],).
d) Clinical deterioration suggesting that no further benefit from treatment is likely.
e) Intolerability to therapy.f) Meeting criteria for discontinuation of study therapy as outlined  in protocol body Sections 3.5  and 4.9.5 . 
For all study parts, the subjects listed above will enter the clinical follow-up period, with visits scheduled on Days 30,
60, 100, and 150 to monitor for adverse events (AE)s.
Survival follow-up is no longer required with Revised Protocol 12 and no further visits should be conducted.
The Dose Escalation (Part 1; Completed) : A 3 + 3 + [ADDRESS_399028] exceeded the MTD. If no MTD is reached throughCohort 4, then additional cohorts at 6 mg/kg lirilumab and 10 mg/kg lirilumab, given in combination with 3 mg/kgnivolumab, may be considered based on the aggregate sa fety experience during dose escalation and in consultation
and agreement between investigators and Sponsor via a protocol amendment.
After determining the MTD, MAD, or completion of dose e scalation without identifying the MTD and to further
explore pharmacodynamic/biomarker objec tives, 3 to 12 additional subjects may be enrolled in each Dose Level for
a total of up to 15 subjects at any Dose Level (original [ADDRESS_399029] a total cohort size of 15).No intra-subject dose es calation or reduction is allowed. Subjects who withdraw from the study during the DLT period
for reasons other than a DLT may be replaced within the same Dose Level. For the purpose of making decisions on
dose escalation from a saf ety perspective, subjects will be considered evaluable if they have r eceived 3 out of the 4
scheduled nivolumab doses through the 8-week observation period only if the 1 missed dose was secondary to non-

a3 to 12 subjects will be e nrolled during dose escalation. Additional s ubjects may be added to each Dose Level after
completion of the dose escalation period of the study for a total of up to 15 subjects per Dose Level.
All available clinical and laboratory data and the nature, time of onset, and time to resolution of DLTs observed during
dose escalation will be reviewed to dete rmine whether an alternative dose schedule should be examined after
consultation between the investigators and the Sponsor, if needed. If agreed upon, the alternative schedule will be
identified by a protocol amendment.
The Cohort Expansion (Part 1; Completed) : The purpose of the cohort expansions is to gather additional safety,
tolerability, preliminary efficacy, and pharmacodynamic infor mation regarding the combi nation of lirilumab and
nivolumab. Once the safety profile of all doses tested has been characterized and the MTD of combined administration
of lirilumab and nivolumab has been defined, the cohort expansions will be initiated at the MTD, the MAD, or an
alternate dose, if recommended by [CONTACT_323411]. Treatment doses in the cohort expansion groups
will not exceed the MAD. Five c ohort expansions will be restricted to the tumor types listed in Table 2 . The non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and MEL cohorts, which have dem onstrated activity with nivolumab monotherapy, will be
used to assess increased activity of th e combination therapy. The color ectal cancer (CRC), SCCHN, and hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) cohorts will explore activity of the c ombination therapy in tumors with unknown or historically low
responses to nivolumab monotherapy. Continuous evaluation of toxicity events in the cohort expansions will beperformed throughout enrollment in the cohort expansions. If the rate of DLTs exceeds 33%, then the findings will bediscussed and further enrollment may be interrupted. If a c ohort expansion is discontinued due to toxicity, a new
cohort may be initiated at a previous ly tested lower Dose Level.
In each of the NSCLC and MEL cohorts, a pproximately 35 sub jects will be enrolled to allow for a more precise
estimate of the ORR in these tumors following combination treatment. The sample size for the other 3 cohorts will beguided by [CONTACT_323412]. In order to determine if a target response rate (eg, 25% to 30%) is likely, an initial numberof subjects (eg, 9) will be treated at first (Stage I) in a c ohort, as outlined in Table 2. In the tumor cohort in which no
responses are observed, it will be concluded that the true response rate is unlikely to be greater than or equal to thetarget rate and no more subjects will be e nrolled in that cohort. Otherwise, in the cohorts in which at least 1 response
among the Stage I subjects is observed, up to 9 additional sub jects will be tr eated for a total of 18 s ubjects per tumor
type, as guided by [CONTACT_50489] 3 . In Stage I, approximately 9 sub jects will be enrolled per tumor type. The number of
subjects enrolled in Stage II per tumor c ohort will be guided by [CONTACT_323413] I and the
required precision of the ORR estimate. This is summarized in Table 3 below, using a precision of 12% around theORR point estimate.

applicable starting with Amendment 13 and all subseque nt amendments or revised p rotocols. For the purpose of 
guiding dose escalation, hepatic, non-hematologic, and hematologic DLTs will be defined separately (protocol body 
Section 4.8 ) and will be determined based on the incidence, in tensity, and duration of AE s that are r elated to  study 
drug and that occ ur within 56 days (8 weeks, through th e completion of Cycle 1) of initiation of st udy drug in the 
Dose Escalation and Cohort Expansion (Part 1; completed). The severity of AEs will be graded according to the

laboratory abnormalities as well as results of vital sign measurements, electrocardiograms (ECGs), physicalexaminations, and imaging studies. Both AEs and laboratory tests will be graded using NCI CTCAE v4.0.
•Efficacy Measures : Disease assessment with computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging, as 
appropriate, will be performed at baseline and Q8W until disease progression, at the completion of clinical follow-
up, or until subjects withdraw from the study. Disease a ssessments at other timepoints may be performed if the 
investigator is concerned about tumor progression. Tumor responses will be derived for appropriate populations of subjects as defined by [CONTACT_393] v1.1 (see protocol body Appendix 3) from tumor measurements. For the Dose 
Escalation and Cohort Expansion (Part 1; completed) and the SCCHN Cohort Expansion (Part 2; completed), 
investigator-assessed responses and treatment decisions related to subject management  will be based on irRECIST 
(see protocol body Appendix 2 ); all other study parts will use only RECIST v1.1. Radiographic assessments may 
be submitted to the third-party radiology vendor for any pa rt of the study. Tumor asse ssments should be submitted 
to the third-party radiology vendor as they are performed on an ongoing basis. Submission of radiographic scans 
to the third-party vendor is no longer required with Revised Protocol 12.
−In Parts [ADDRESS_399035] criteria. Investigators will also report the number and size of new lesions that appear while on-study. The timepoint tumor assessments will be repor ted on the CRF based on investigators’ assessment 
using irRECIST criteria. The SCCHN Randomized Cohorts (Part 3), and the Signal Detection in SCCHN with Lirilumab, Nivolumab, and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_90843] (Part 5), however, will use only RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_399036] criteria to be utilized in this study.
•The SCCHN Randomized Cohorts (Part 3 - closed to enrollment):
−The primary endpoint is ORR based on assessment in all subjects randomized to lirilumab plus nivolumab.
Tumor progression or response endpoints will be assessed using RECIST v1.1 criteria. All randomized subjects will be monitored by [CONTACT_323415] 8 weeks (± 7 days) beginning from the first
dose date until Week 48 and Q12W ( ±7 days) thereafter until PD or treatment discontinuation (whichever 
occurs later), to determine changes in tumor size.
−Secondary efficacy endpoints of the SCCHN Randomized Cohorts (Part 3) are DCR, DOR, time to response, 
depth of response, OS, PFS, ORR according to investigator-assessed response, and safety measures.

Statistical M
ethods:
•Sample Size Determination:
−The Dose Escalation and Cohort Expansion (Part 1; Completed):
♦See Section 1  “Clinical Experience with Lirilumab a nd Nivolumab Combination Treatment” of the
protocol body for a summary of preliminary safety and efficacy results. 
♦Dose Escalation: Because this is a Phase 1/2 dose escalation study, the sample size at each dose cannot
be determined exactly, as it depends on the numbe r of observed toxicities. A pproximately between 3 and
12 subjects are expected to be tr eated during dose escalation in each Dose Level, and up to 15 subjects
may be dosed at selected Dose Levels.
♦The Cohort Expansion: During cohort expansion, approximately 18 subjects are expected to be enrolled
in each of the 3 unknown or low historic res ponse cohort expansions and 35 subjects in each of the 2
cohorts with higher historic ORR and treated at the previously determined MTD, MAD, or at analternative dose that i s not to exceed the MAD.
♦CRC, SCCHN, and HCC Cohorts: The sample size for each c ohort will be guided by a 2-stage Gehan
design. In order to determine whether a target ORR is likely in a tumor cohort, approximately 9 subjects will be treated at Stage 1 in each tumor type, as outlined in Table 2 . For a tumor type in which no
responses are observed, it will be concluded that the true ORR is unlikely to be greater than or equal tothe target ORR and no more subjects will be enrolled in these tumors. For tumor cohort(s) in which at
least [ADDRESS_399037] approximately 9 subjects is observed, up to an additional 9 subjects will
be enrolled as guided by [CONTACT_50489] 3 . With approximately 9 subjects in Stage 1, there is no more than a 10%
chance of declaring that there is no therapeutic effect when actually there is an effect. A total of up toapproximately 18 subjects across the 2 s tages per tumor will guarantee an estimate of the true ORR with
12% precision.
♦NSCLC and MEL Cohorts: A total of approximately 35 subjects will be enrolled per tumor cohort basedon achieving a higher precision with a reasonable control on the type I error. In a cohort of approximately35 subjects, if 12, 14, or 16 responses are observed, then the lower limit of the 1-sided 90% confidence
interval (CI) for the ORR is 24%, 29%, or 34%, res pectively. In add ition, 19 responses would need to
be observed in approximately 35 subjects so that the lower limit of the 1-sided 90% CI for the ORR is
42%. These calculations are based on the Clopper-Pearson method for exact CIs. If the true ORR in a
tumor type is 45%, then with approximately 35 subjects in a cohort there is 96% chance of observing atleast 10 responses, and 93% chance of observing at least 11 responses, and there is 7% chance ofobserving 10 or fewer responses (false negative rate). If the true ORR for a tumor is only 30% ratherthan 45%, then there is a 35% and 14% chance, respectively, that there will be at least 12 or at least14 responses in approximately 35 subjects (false positive rate).
−The SCCHN Cohort Expansion (Part 2; Completed): See Section 1 “Clinical Experience with Lirilumab 
and Nivolumab Combination Treatment” of the protoc ol body for a summary of preliminary safety and 
efficacy results. A total of approximately 35 subjects will be enrolled in the SCCHN Expansion Cohort (Part 2; completed). The null hypothesis that the true O RR is 25% will be tested against a 1-sided alternative: 
ORR = 40%. The null hypothesis will be rejected if 12 or more responses are observed in 35 subjects. This design gives a 1-sided type 1 error rate of 0.15 and a power of 0.81. 
−The SCCHN Randomized Cohorts (Part 3 - closed to enrollment): The SCCHN Randomized Cohorts
(Part 3) has a primary endpoint of ORR. Overall 2-sided alpha is set at 0.10. The final analysis of ORR will take place [ADDRESS_399038] treatme nt. A total of a pproximately 225 subjects will be enrolled 
if PD-L1 is expressed in ≥1% of tumor cells, and will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to the 2 treatment arms, 
nivolumab combined with lirilumab (Arm A) and nivolumab monotherapy (Arm B), stratified by [CONTACT_4002]-L1+ ≥
50% expression (yes/no) and prior treatment with cetux imab (yes/no). The sample size considers the

precision of the estimated ORR in Arm A. With 150 participants in Arm A, if 50 responses are observed, the 
estimated ORR will be 33% and the 90% CI will be [26%, 41%]. (Study CA209-041, 90% CI for nivolumab arm in PD-L1+ [9%, 25%].)
−The Signal Detection Cohort Expansion (Part 4): Removed with Revised Protocol 12.
−The Signal Detection in SCCHN with Lirilumab, Nivolumab, and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_90843] (Part 5 -
closed to enrollment): A total of 40 subjects will be enrolled in the Signal Detection in SCCHN with Lirilumab, Nivolumab, and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_90843] (Part 5). With this sample size, the average width of 
the 2-sided 80% Clopper-Pearson CI for the ORR will be approximately 16% to 21% (assuming that the 
expected ORR in subjects with platinum-refract ory recurrent or metastatic SCC HN is between 13% and 
33%).
−The Signal Detection in Previously Untreated MEL with Lirilumab, Nivolumab, and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_90843] (Part 6): Removed with Revised Protocol 12.
•Statistical Analysis:
−Safety: All recorded AEs will be listed and tabulated by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, and dose and
coded according to the most current version of MedDRA. Vital signs and clinical laboratory test results will
be listed and summarized by [CONTACT_3148]. Any significant physical examination findings and results of clinical
laboratory tests will be listed. ECG results will be ev aluated by [CONTACT_79362], if present,
will be listed. Summary tables will be presented on safety parameters for each tr eatment arm and/or tumor 
types, if applicable.
−PK: Summary statistics will be tabulated for the PK parameters of lirilumab, nivolumab, and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_323313]/week. For the Signal Detection in SCCHN 
with Lirilumab, Nivolumab, and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_90843] (Part 5), summary tables will also be presented by 
[CONTACT_323416]. To describe the dependency on dose of anti-KIR, scatter plots of Cmax and AUC(TAU) vs dose will be provided for each day measured. Dose proportionality of lirilumab when co-administered with nivolumab will be assessed based on a power model. Dose proportionality of lirilumab when co-administered with nivolumab, and of lirilumab when co-administered with nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_323314] a power model.
−Immunogenicity Analyses : A listing will be provided of all available immunogenicity data. Additionally, a 
listing of immunogenicity data from those subjects with at least 1 positive ADA at any timepoi nt will be 
provided by [CONTACT_323417]. The number (%) of subjects with the following anti-drug responses 
will be reported for each analyte if applicable, by [CONTACT_2715], and overall: Baseline ADA Positive, ADA Positive 
(Persistent Positive, Only the Last Sample Pos itive), ADA Positive with Neutralizing Positive, and ADA 
Negative. To examine the potential relationship between immunogenicity and safety, the frequency and type of AEs of special interest may be examined by [CONTACT_323418]. Associations between trough 
concentrations of lirilumab (or nivolumab or ip ilimumab) and corresponding ADA assessments may be 
explored.
−Efficacy Analyses :
♦The SCCHN Randomized Cohorts (Part 3) Primary Endpoints Analysis : The primary endpoint of
ORR will be analyzed for the SCCHN Randomized Cohorts (Part 3). Subjects will be enrolled if PD-L1 
is expressed in ≥ 1% of tumor cells. CIs will be provided sepa rately for each treatment arm using the 
Clopper-Pearson method.
−Secondary Endpoints Analysis: Individual BOR, DOR, OS, and PFS will be listed using RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_399039] after subjects 
discontinue the study drug.

applicable. Finally, a waterfall plot showing the bigge st reduction in the sum of target lesions will be 
produced for response-evaluable subjects.
−Biomarker Analyses: The pharmacodynamic effect on TILs and expre ssion of tumor markers including PD-
L1  will be assessed by [CONTACT_148216], and investigated graphically to explore patterns 
of change. In addition, th e correlation of TIL changes and tumor marker expression with measures of
peripheral blood markers will be explored graphically and by [CONTACT_323419].
−Outcomes Research Analyses - Removed with Revised Protocol 12.
−Interim Analysis:
♦Data emerging from the unblinded parts of this st udy may be need ed for timely decisions about 
adjustments to procedures in subsequent parts of the study. Therefore, data may be reviewed prior to the 
final lock of the study database. While the study is still ongoing, additional interim analyses may also be 
performed for administrative purposes or publications. In that  case, analyses will only consist of listings, 
summaries, and graphs of the available data, and no for mal inferences requiri ng any adjustment to 
statistical significance level will be performed. Eff icacy analyses based on interim data may use 
response-evaluable or all-treated populations depending on the purpose of the analysis. 
♦The Dose Escalation and C ohort Expansion (Part 1; completed) of the study is the dose-escalation study 
and includes expansion cohorts in specific tumor ty pes. In the dose expansion portion of the Dose 
Escalation and Cohort Expansion (Part 1; completed), in order to assess if the target response rate is 
likely for tumor cohort s with unknown or low historic ORR, the tumor response will be initially based 
on the tumor measurements from the first approximately [ADDRESS_399040] 
approximately 9 subjects with tumor measurements, enrollment in that tumor cohort will not continue. However, accrual to these tumor types may conti nue, while the Stage I response assessments are 
performed.

1 INTRODUCTION AND STUDY RATIONALE
Lirilumab (BMS-986015) is a fully human monoclonal antibody th at is designed to act as a 
checkpoint inhibitor by [CONTACT_323420]-like receptor 
(KIR)2DL-1,-2,-3 inhibitory receptors and their ligands facilitating activation of natural killer 
(NK) cells and, potentially some subsets of T cells, ultimately leading to anti-tumor activity.
The Dose Escalation and Cohort Expansion (Part 1) and the squamous cell carcinoma of the head 
and neck (SCCHN) Cohort Expansion (Part 2) have both completed enrollment and are not 
applicable starting with Amendment 13 and all subsequent amendments. For preliminary safety 
and efficacy results, see Section 1 “Clin ical Expe rience with Lirilumab and Nivolumab 
Combination Treatment” of the protocol body.
At the time of Amendment 13, pre liminary data from an initial c ohort of subjects in 
Study CA223001 suggested a signal of potential efficacy in recurrent  or metas tatic SCCHN 
subjects with disease progression on or after pla tinum-based therapy. Specifically, preliminary 
data in 29 evaluable subjects treated with the comb ination of lirilumab plus nivolumab showed an 
objective response rate (ORR) of 24% (7/29) in the all-comer population and an ORR of 41% 
(7/17) in the programmed cell death lig and 1 positive (P D-L1+) population.1Whereas, nivolumab 
monotherapy, in a similar population of patients with previously treated SCCHN, showed an ORR 
of 13.1% (32/240) in  all SCCHN s ubjects and an ORR of 17.0% (15/88) in subjects with ≥1% 
programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression.2Preliminary data also indicated the 
combination of lirilumab plus nivolumab is safe, with the addition of lirilumab to nivolumab adding little additional toxicity to that typi[INVESTIGATOR_323317]. Based on these results, the protocol was revised to add additional cohorts (Parts 3-6; see description in Section  
3.1).
Subsequent efficacy analysis of additional rec urrent or metastatic SCCHN subjects with disease 
progression on or after platinum-based therapy treated with the combination of lirilumab and
nivolumab did not demonstrate a differential efficacy signal as compared to nivolumab 
monotherapy treatment in a similar  population of SCCHN subjects. Based on the review of these 
data, Revised Protocol 12 will implement the following:
•Enrollment permanently closed in Part 3, a single-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized 
cohort expansion of lirilumab in combination with nivolumab vs nivolumab monotherapy 
in subjects with platinum-refractory recurrent or metastatic SCCHN who are PD-L1+.
•Removal of Part 4, a signal detection cohort expansion of nivolumab and lirilumab at a flat dose in subjects with sqNSCLC, ESCC, BC, and other squamous histologies and in 
subjects with SCCHN who have received prior PD-1/PD-L1 directed therapy. No subjects 
were enrolled.
•Enrollment permanently closed in Part 5, a safety and signal detection with a triplet 
regimen of lirilumab in combination with nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_323305]-refractory recurrent or metastatic SCCHN.

•Removal of overall survival visits for all subjects, select sample collection and study visits,

disease progression.
•All subjects will be permitted a maximum of up to  2 years of treatment as specified in the 
individual study parts. 
Background of NK Cells and KIR in Inflamed Tumors
An analysis of the immune infiltration in a large  cohort of head and neck tumors, integrating 
genetic data with RNA-seq–based deconvolution of  immune cell p opulations and 
effector/regulatory molecules was done3and found that SCCHN is one of the most highly immune-
infiltrated cancer types, and in fact, the most highly NK cell– and Treg-infiltrated cancer type. 
These tumors are poised to benefit from immunotherapy that includes Treg and NK checkpoint-
targeted approaches that may have unique applicability in head and neck cancer.
Analysis of the levels of NK-cell infiltration in SCCHN showed that the CD56brightsubpopulation 
is predominantly found in lymph nodes and peripheral blood and believed to be the likely precursor 
to CD56dimcells, which are far more cytotoxic and play a critical role in antitumor immunity.[ADDRESS_399050] Treg/CD8+ T- cell ratio across all 
cancers, suggesting that these tumors are poised to respond to immunotherapeutic mod alities that 
relieve inhibitory pathways. Treg function and pro liferation rely on a number of targetable 
pathways. CTLA-[ADDRESS_399051] clearly been shown to promote antitumor immunity in MEL. Blockade of the CTLA-4 receptor on activated Tregs may therefore dampen the immunosuppressive function of these cells in  head and neck tumors. A growing body of 
evidence suggests that CTLA-4 blockade does, in some contexts, repress Treg function and 
accumulation in the tumor microenvironment.
Analysis of immune-cell infilt ration and levels of immune activation in other highly inflamed 
cancer types, namely MEL, prostate, kidney clea r cell, cervi cal/endometrial, sqNSCLC, adeno 
NSCLC, breast, bladder, and thyroid
5showed that the levels of CD56brightNK-cell infiltration was

BMS-[ADDRESS_399052] these tumors possess an  immune landscape that is poised to respond to 
immunotherapeutic approaches that block inhibitory signals to T cells and NK cells. 
Background of Anti-KIR Antibody Lirilumab (BMS-986015)
Lirilumab binds specifically and with high affinity to subsets of KIRs (ie, KIR2DL1, -2, and -3 
and KIR2DS1 and -2), thus preventing the interaction between KIR and HLA-C. Therefore 
NK-cell activation is determined by [CONTACT_323421] (positive)  and inhibitory (negative) 
receptor stimulation. Tumor cells are able to evade innate immunity through the interaction of KIR 
with HLA-C. By [CONTACT_323422], lirilumab facilitates th e activation of NK cells and 
subsequent killing of the tumor cell. Blockade of inhibitory KIR by [CONTACT_323423], thus, a promising 
mechanism to promote killing of tumor cells by [CONTACT_310147].
Lirilumab is being studied as a potential imm unotherapy alone and in combination with other
agents in subjects with various hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. A to tal of [ADDRESS_399053] been treated with lirilumab across 5 studies as of 13-Jul-2017 assessing safety, 
pharmacokinetics (PK), biomarker modulation, and clinical activity. The first (Study CA223003, 
IPH2102-101) is a monotherapy, dose-escalatio n, Phase 1 trial to determine the safety and 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BMS-986015 (IPH2102) and is completed. The second (Study CA223004, IPH2102-201) is a double- blind, placebo-controlled, Phase [ADDRESS_399054] (Study CA223001), fourth (Study CA223002), and fifth (Study CA223028) are Phase 1 (or 
Phase 1/2) trials of lirilumab in combination with the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab (Study CA223001), the anti-CTLA-4 antibody ip ilimumab (Study CA223002), and the Signaling 
Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family M ember 7 antibody elotuzumab (Study CA223028) 
were initiated to determine if coordinate modulation of the innate and adaptive immune systems results in greater clinical benefit. Study CA223002 was terminated early, Study CA223028 is completed and study CA223001 is ongoing.
The majority of adverse events (AEs) in these 5 trials were mild or moderate (Grade 1 or 2), 
self-limiti ng, and manageable. The most common related AEs in the monotherapy trials were 
asthenia, bronchitis, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, pruritus, and thrombocytopenia. The most 
common related AEs in the combination trials were fatigue, i nfusion-related reacti on, pruritus, 
rash, nausea, chills, diarrhea, rash maculo-papular, and pyrexia. The data to date support a positive 
safety profile of lirilumab.
Background of Nivolumab: Mechanism of Action
Current immunotherapy efforts attempt to br eak the apparent tolerance of the immune system to 
tumor cells and antigens by [CONTACT_323424]. T-cell stimulation is a complex process 
involving the integration of numerous positive as well as negative co-stimulatory signals in

addition to antigen recogni tion by [CONTACT_941] T-cell r eceptor.6Collectively, these signals govern the 
balance between T- cell activation and tolerance. 
PD-1 is a member of the cluster of differentiation (CD) 28 family of T- cell co-s timulatory 
receptors, which also include CD28, CTLA-4, inducible T- cell co-s timulator (ICOS), and B- and 
T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA).7PD-1 signaling has been shown to inhibit CD28-mediated 
upregulation of interleukin (IL)-2, IL- 10, IL-13, interferon-gamma (IFN- γ), and B-cell lymphoma-
extra large. PD-[ADDRESS_399055] genetic factors. Thus, PD-1 deficiency or inhibition is 
not accompanied by a universal loss of tolerance to self-antigens.
In vitro, nivolumab (BMS-936558) binds to PD-1 with high affinity (concentration required for 
50% efficacy [EC50]: 0.39 to 2.62 nM) and inhibits th e binding of PD-1 to its ligands PD-L1 and 
programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2) (concentration required for 50% inhibition 
[IC50] ±1 nM). Nivolumab binds specifically to PD-[ADDRESS_399056] by [CONTACT_323425] a reproducible enhancement of both proliferation and IFN- γ release in the mixed 
lymphocyte reaction. Using a cytomegalovirus (CMV) re-stimulation assay with human peripheral 
blood mononuclear cell (PBM C), the effect of nivolumab on antigen-specific recall response 
indicates that nivolumab augmented IFN- γ secretion from CMV-specific memory T cells in a 
dose-dependent manner vs isotype-matched control. In vivo blockade of PD-1 by a murine analog of nivolumab enhances the anti-tumor immune res ponse and results in tumo r rejection in several 
immunocompetent mouse tumor models (MC38, SA1/N, and PAN02).

Pre-clinical Results Utilizing Murine Anti-PD-1 and Anti-KIR Antibodies
Pre-clinical studies tested the hypothesis that the combination of anti-KIR and anti-PD-1 would
potentiate anti-tumor efficacy in a murine solid tumor model. Both nivolumab (human anti-PD-1 
antibody) and lirilumab recognize only human sequences. Thus, a murine-specific PD-1 antibodyand anti-Ly49 antibody, an F(ab)2 that recognizes Ly49C/I, which is the KIR homologue in mice,were used to test this hypothesis. Mice were injected with the syngeneic MC38 murine colon
carcinoma cell line and, following the formation of p alpable tumors, they were randomized to 1 of
4 cohorts to r eceive control IgG, anti-Ly49 anti body, anti-PD-1 anti body, or both antibodies. Mice
treated with a control IgG antibody had rapid growth of tumors (upper left panel of Figure 1-1 ).
Mice treated with anti-Ly49 antibody (lower left panel of Figure 1-1) did not differ significantlyfrom control animals. Those treated with a murine anti-PD-1 antibody (upper right panel of
Figure 1-1) showed latency in tumor progression, and 30% of mice continued to be free of tumor.

At the time of Amendment 13, pre liminary data from an initial c ohort of subjects in 
Study CA223001 suggested a signal of potential efficacy in recurrent or metas tatic SCCHN 
subjects with disease progression on or after pla tinum-based therapy. Specifically, preliminary 
data in 29 evaluable subjects treated  with the combination of lirilumab plus nivolumab showed an 
ORR of 24% (7/29) in the all-comer population and an ORR of 41% (7/17) in the PD-L1+ 
population.1No responses (0/12) were observed in the PD-L1 negative population. To put into 
context nivolumab monotherapy in a similar population of patients with previously treated 
SCCHN (recently approved by [CONTACT_323426]-based therapy) showed an ORR 
of 13.1% (32/240) in all SCCHN s ubjects and an ORR of 1 7.0% (15/88) in subjects with ≥1% 
PD-L1 expression.
2Also of note, in 5 out of the 7 lirilumab plus nivolumab responders, the 
reduction in tumor burden was subs tantial, exceeding greater than 80%.1Responses appeared
durable, with the median DOR not reached. 
Subsequent efficacy analysis of additional S CCHN subjects treated with the combination of

Background: Anti-KIR Antibody in Combination with Anti-CTLA-4 Antibodies
Pre-clinical studies tested the hypothesis that the combination of anti-KIR and anti-CTLA-4 
antibodies would po tentiate anti-tumor e fficacy in a murine AML model. Both lirilumab and 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (human anti-CTLA-4 antibody) recognize only human receptors. Thus, a 
murine-specific anti-CTLA-4 antibody  and anti-Ly49C/I (5E6 F(ab’) 2) were used to test this 
hypothesis. Mice were infused with the murine leukemia C1498 cell line and randomized to 
1 of 4 cohorts to receive control immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibody, anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody, anti-Ly49C/I (5E6 F(ab’)
2), or both anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody and 
anti-Ly49C/I (5E6 F(ab’) 2). Mice tr eated with control antibody had a median survival of 25.5 days. 
Mice treated with anti-CTLA-4 did not differ significantly from control animals (median 26.0 days, P = 0.37). Those treated with anti-Ly49C/I (5E6 F(ab’)
2) had prol onged survival 
(median 27.0 days, P = 0.016). Those treated with both antibodies had further prolonged survival 
(median 29.5 days, P < 0.001). It is possible that the combination of the 2 antibodies has a more

F(ab’) 2) alone and both antibodies (27.0 days vs 29.5 days, respectively) did not reach statist ical 
significance (P = 0.17). It is possible that a prolonged dosing schedule will yield more robust 
results, and that this combination of antibodies will be efficacious in other cancer models. These 
results provide pre- clinical evidence of the benefit of an anti-KIR antibody to potentiate the 
efficacy of an anti-CTLA-[ADDRESS_399059] advanced tu mors. The study was to be conducted in 2 parts, 
with a dose-escalation phase followed by a dose-expansion phase. During the dose-escalation phase, subjects received BM S-986015 (0.1, 0.3, 1, or 3 mg/kg) and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (3 mg/kg) as 
Induction therapy (every 3 weeks [Q3W] for 4 doses) and then Maintenance therapy (every 12 weeks [Q12W] for 4 doses) for a total of up to 1.[ADDRESS_399060] udy were per mitted to complete treatment and clinical follow-up as 
per protocol. This re port pre sents results of the evaluation of safety and tolerability (the primary 
objective), as well as preliminary anti-tumor activity (a secondary objective). 
AEs were reported for all 22 (100%) of the subjects treated in this study. The most frequently 
reported AEs (> 25% of all tr eated subjects) were fatigue (45.5%), nausea (40.9%), malignant 
neoplasm progression (36.4%), back pain (27.3%), diarrhea (27.3%), pneumonia (27.3%), pyrexia 
(27.3%), and vomiting (27.3%). There were no apparent dose-related trends in the occurrence of 
any AEs. Of the [ADDRESS_399061] overall response (BOR) was evaluable, 3 subjects had a partial response, 5 subjects had stable disease (SD), and 8 subjects had progressive disease (PD). 
In conclusion, lirilumab was gen erally well tolerated wh en administered at doses of 0.1 to 1 mg/kg 
in combination with an approved dose of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (3 mg/kg) in subjects with advanced or 
metastatic solid tumors.

To date, the cumulative safety data support a manageable safety profile for lirilumab that is

NK-cell activation, and diminution of KIR fun ction is likely to potentiate the innate immune
response. Lirilumab is a fully human anti-KIR monoclonal antibody that has shown minimal side
effects in a Phase 1 study. The aim of this study is to coordinately potentiate adaptive and innate
immunity to enhance the anti-tumor activity of ant i-PD-1 antibody by [CONTACT_323427]-KIR
antibody in subjects with advanced solid tu mors who currently ha ve poor prognosis and limited
treatment options. The Dose Escalation and Cohort Expansion (Part 1) and the SCCHN Cohort 
Expansion (Part 2) of this study will address t he feasibility and safety and preliminary efficacy of
the combined administration of lirilumab and nivolumab. The Dose Escalation and Cohort 
Expansion (Part 1) has completed enrollmen t, and the SCCHN Cohort Expansion (Part 2)

With Revised Protocol 12, enrollment in Part [ADDRESS_399062] commo n cancers worldwide, accounting for more than 
550,000 cases and around 300,000 d eaths each year
13and these trends are increasing. In the US, 
~48,330 new cases of oral cavity and pharynx cancer were reported; and ~9,570 people were 
predicted to die of this disease in 2016.14About ~90% of all head and neck cancers are squamous 
cell. Most SCCHNs arise from the epi[INVESTIGATOR_323320], orophar ynx, larynx, and 
hypopharynx. The most important risk factors identified in SCCHNs include tobacco and alcohol 
use, and in a subgroup of SCCHNs (partic ularly oropharynx tumors), human papi[INVESTIGATOR_27509] 
(HPV) is a strong independent prognostic factor.15Metastatic and recurrent SCCHN that is no 
longer amenable to lo cal surgi cal/radiation therapy causes substan tial morbidity and high 
mortality, with a med ian progression-free survival (PFS) of < 6 months and median overall 
survival (OS) of less than [ADDRESS_399063] shown promising preliminary 
results. A 17.7% ORR has been observed in the ongoing KEYNOTE 012 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) clinical 
trial of 192 subjects with the recurrent/metastatic SCCHN treated with the anti-PD-1 agent 
pembrolizumab.16Recently, nivolumab was approved by [CONTACT_323428]-based therapy. 
The approval was based on results from the Phase 3, CheckMate-141 trial in which nivolumab demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful superior OS vs the comparator arm 
(the investigator’s choice of methotrexate, docetaxel, or cetuximab), with a 30% reduction in the 
risk of death (HR = 0.70 [95% CI: 0.53 to 0.92; P = 0.0101]).
17The median OS was 7.5 months 
(95% CI: 5.5 to 9.1) for nivolumab compared to 5.1 months (95% CI: 4.0 to 6.0) for the 
investigator’s choice.2,17Despi[INVESTIGATOR_323321], patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN are 
a population with unmet medical need and combination immunotherapy agents remains an area of 
active clinical evaluation.

At the time of Amendment 13, pre liminary data from an initial c ohort of subjects in 
Study CA223001 suggested a signal of potential efficacy in recurrent  or metas tatic SCCHN 
subjects with disease progression on or after pla tinum-based therapy. Specifically, preliminary 
data in 29 evaluable subjects treated  with the combination of lirilumab plus nivolumab showed an 
ORR of 24% (7/29) in the all-comer population and an ORR of 41% (7/17) in the PD-L1+ 
population.1No responses (0/12) were observed in the PD-L1 negative population. To put into 
context nivolumab monotherapy in a similar population of patients with previously treated 
SCCHN (recently approved by [CONTACT_323429]-based therapy) showed an ORR 
of 13.1% (32/240) in all SCCHN s ubjects and an ORR of 1 7.0% (15/88) in subjects with ≥1% 
PD-L1 expression.
2Also of note, in 5 out of the 7 lirilumab plus nivolumab responders, the 
reduction in tumor burden was substantial, exceeding greater than 80%. Res ponses appeared
durable, with the median DOR not reached. These results indicate lirilumab plus nivolumab may have clinically meaningful greater clinical activity than nivolumab alone, particularly in inflamed 
(PD-L1+) tumors and with little added toxicity.
Furthermore, lirilumab in combination with nivolumab has an acceptable safety profile in subjects 
with advanced refractory solid tumors. The safety profile associated with lirilumab in combination with nivolumab was generally consistent with that observed with nivolumab monotherapy. Overall 
treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) was reported in 114 (72%) subjects, and Grade 3 to 4 
TRAEs were reported in 24 (15%) subjects. Discontinuations due to TRAEs occurred in 12 (8%)
subjects.

Evaluating lirilumab in combination with nivolumab in subjects with tumor PD-L1+, 
platinum-refractory SCCHN will potentially provide  further treatment options for patients with a 
high unmet medical need.

types of immune-mediated AEs include endocrinopathies, diarrhea/colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, 
nephritis, and rash. In the combinat ion regimen, the frequency and in tensity of these events may 
vary and will depend on the specific dose and schedule used. Study CA209012 evaluating multiple 
dose regimens of nivolumab in combination with  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_323324] 3 mg/kg and the safety of combination 
improved with the lower dose of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], 1 mg/kg was given less frequently (Q6W or Q12W) (See Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). Therefore the combination dosing schedule selected for this study 
(nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks [Q2W] plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks [Q6W]) utilizes the approved nivolumab dose and provides the highest dose and frequency of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_323325] a combination regimen where the imm une-mediated AEs were mostly low grade and 
manageable with prompt use of corticosteroids (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
Safety Profile of Lirilumab in Combination with Nivolumab and with Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_323326] 1 “Clinical Experience with Lirilumab and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_323315]” and “Clinical Experience with Lirilumab and Nivolumab Combination Treatment.” To 
date, the cumulative safety data support a manag eable safety profile for lirilumab in combination 
with nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_323327]. 
Therefore, it is not expected that the addition of lirilumab will add additional tox icities to the 
known safety profile of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].
As an additional safety measur e, initially approximately [ADDRESS_399064] 4 weeks of safety assessment from the start of study d rug administration before 
additional subjects are enro lled in the study to ensure there is no major safety signal with the 
combination. Any findings will be discussed betw een the BMS Medical Monitor and investigators 
and an agreement will be reached as to whether a lower dose or an alternate dose schedule should 
be examined or whether any a dditional treatment guidelines should be implemented prior to 
enrollment of additional subjects on study.
Biological Rationale for the Combination of Lirilumab with Nivolumab and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_323328] 1 “Background of NK  cells and KIR in Inflamed Tumors,” immune 
infiltrate analysis in the inflamed tumors such as  SCCHN and MEL, show infiltration with Tregs 
and KIR-overexpressing CD56
dimNK cells, to a higher degree than other cancer types. These 
findings suggest that head and neck tumors possess an immune landscape that is poised to respond 
to immunotherapeutic approaches that block inhibitory signals to T cells and NK cells, such as 
immune checkpoint inhibitors (nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]), including antibodies blocking KIR 
signaling (lirilumab).
Therefore, the Signal Detection in SCCHN with Lirilu mab, Nivolumab, and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251564] (Part 5) will evalu ate if the addition of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], a Treg-targeted agent will 
enhance the efficacy seen with the combination of lirilumab and nivolumab in SCCHN.

[IP_ADDRESS] Experience with Nivolumab and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_323329]-clinical data indicate that the combination of PD-1 and CTLA-4 receptor blockade may
improve anti-tumor activity. In vitro combinations of nivolumab plus ip ilimumab increase IFN- γ 
production 2- to 7-fold over either agent alone in a mixed lymphocyte reaction. Increased 
anti-tumor activity of the combination was also  observed in 3 of 5 syngeneic murine cancer 
models. In a murine MEL vaccine model, blockade with either CTLA-4 or PD-1 antibodies 
increased the proportion of CTLA-4 and PD-1-expressing CD4/CD8 tumor infiltrating T effector 
cells, and dual blockade increased tumor infiltration of T effector cells and decreased intratumoral 
Tregs, as compared to either agent alone.18
Clinical activity of nivolumab and ip ilimumab combination was evaluated in subjects with 
stage IV non-squamous cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as first line tr eatment in CA209012 st udy.19
This was a large phase 1, multi-arm safety study of nivolumab monotherapy and nivolumab in 
combination with various systemic anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_323330], platinum based 
chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_323331].
The regimens for these cohorts were:
•Arm N (n=31): nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg Q3W for 4 cycles, followed by 
[CONTACT_20382] 3 mg/kg Q2W

•Arm Q (n=39): nivolumab 3 mg/ kg Q2W + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg Q6W
The most frequently reported drug-related AEs in  the newer nivolumab plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_323332] (29.0%), dia rrhea (25.0%), pruritus (23.7%), and fatigue (23.1%) in arms N, O, P,

newer nivolumab plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_323333], hypophysitis, pneumonitis, 
autoimmune hepatitis, diarrhea, colitis, and acute  kidney injury. Drug-related Grade 3 to 4 AEs 
were reported in 9 (29.0%) subjects in Arm N, 16 (40.0%) subjects in Arm O , 14 (36.8%) subjects 
in Arm P, and 13 (33.3%) subjects in Arm Q. Drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation

Clinical activity was observed in all combinatio n cohorts but numer ically higher response rates 
were observed in cohorts evaluating the approved dose of nivolumab 3 mg/kg, with confirmed 
response rates ≥ 39% (cohorts P and Q).19With comparable efficacy and safety data from cohorts 
P and Q, the nivolumab plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_43852] 6 week (Q6W) dosing schedule (cohort Q) was the 
selected regimen moving forward.20Aside from utilizing the approved nivolumab dose in NSCLC, 
it would also provide the highest dose and frequency of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_323325] a combination 
regimen.
To date, there are no data on the combination of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_323337]. CA209714 
and CA209651 are studies evaluating this combination of nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W and 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg Q6W in SCCHN and are ongoing.

and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg Q6W have shown adequate sa fety and increased efficacy compared to 
single agent nivolumab in CA 209012, our hypothesis is that we w ill see a s imilar effect in SCCHN.

of infusion reactions, which were only Grade 1 and 2, easily manageable, and did not lead to

(Q4W) to the combination of nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg Q6W will increase the toxicity of the regimen.

Lirilumab is a fully human IgG4 monoclonal anti body that binds specifically and with high affinity 
to a subset of KIRs, namely KIR2DL-1, -[ADDRESS_399069] asmon resonance analysi s demonstrated that the 
mean monovalent affinity of lirilumab for recombinant soluble KIR2DL-1 was 2.04 × 10-8M

with lirilumab or placebo in 2 completed, 2 ongoing, and 1 terminated trials: 1 monotherapy Phase 
1 trial, 1 monotherapy placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial, 1 combination therapy Phase 1/2 trial, and 2 combination therapy Phase 1 trials. Of those subjects, 37 subjects received lirilumab 
monotherapy (Study CA223003, Study IPH2102-101), 152 subjects received either lirilumab 
monotherapy or placebo in a 2:1 ratio (Study CA223004, Study IPH2102-201), 322 subjects 
received lirilumab in combination with nivolumab (Study CA223001), 22 subjects received lirilumab in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (Study CA223002), and 17 subjects received elotuzumab in combination with lir ilumab (Study CA22302 8). In total, approximately 
499 subjects received lirilumab. The majority of AEs in these 5 trials were mild or moderate 
(Grade 1 or 2), self -limiting, a nd manageable. The most common related AEs in the monotherapy 
trials were asthenia, bronchitis, dia rrhea, headache, fatigue, pruritus, and thrombocytopenia. The 
most common related AEs in the comb ination trials were fatigue, i nfusion-r elated reaction, 
pruritus, rash, nausea, chills, diarrhea, rash maculo -papular, and pyrexia. The data to date support 
a positive safety profile of lirilumab. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetics of Lirilumab
Final PK data from 1 Phase 1 and preliminary PK data from 2 Phase 1 studies that investigated 
escalating doses of lirilumab monotherapy (Study CA223003, Study IPH2102-101) or combination therapy with nivolumab (Study CA223001) or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (Study CA223002) are presented below. Validated ligand binding assa y methods were used to detect lirilumab, 
nivolumab, and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_323342].
A PK model suggests that the PK profile of lirilumab is likely to be comparable to IPH-2101. In 
previous IPH-[ADDRESS_399071] order elimination was found to adequately describe the data with dose-dependent clearance (CL), such that CL decreased with increasing doses. The terminal 
half-life (T-HALF) at the highest dose (3 mg/kg) was determined to be within 15 to 21 days, which 
is consistent with reported values in the literature.
In Study CA223001, PK of lirilumab at a Dose Level of 0.1 to 3 mg/kg in combination with 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg was characterized after the first and fourth doses of lirilumab, based on the 
availability of the preliminary d ata. The accumulati on ratio based on the area under the plasma 
concentration-time curve (AUC) following the fourth dose compared to the first dose ranged from 
1.4 to 1.5, resulting in a mean eff ective T-HALF of BMS-986015 of 16 to 17 days. For the 
nivolumab 3-mg/kg Dose Level, across different Dose Levels of lirilumab, the geometric mean of 
maximum observed concentration (Cmax) and trough observed concentration (Cmin) after the first

and 61.7 μg/mL, respectively, which are consistent with PK parameters obtained after 
administration of nivolumab monotherapy.
In Study CA223002, PK of lirilumab at Dose Levels of 0.1 to 1 mg/kg in combination with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (BMS-734016) 3 mg/kg was characterized after the first and fourth doses of lirilumab, based on the availability of the preliminary data. The geometric mean accumulation index was 1.4. For the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3-mg/kg Dose Level, across different Dose Levels of lirilumab, the geometric

geometric mean of Cmax and C min after the fourth dose was 74.9 μg/mL and 13.0 μg/mL, 
respectively. These values are consistent with  PK parameters obtained after administration of 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79285].
1.4.5 Nivolumab: Pharmacology
Nivolumab is a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-1 with nanomolar affinity
(K
D= 3.06 nM) and a high degree of specificity, thus precluding binding to its ligands PD-L1 and
PD-L2. Nivolumab does not bind to other related family members, such as BTLA, CTLA-4, ICOS,or CD28. Pre-clinical testing of nivolumab demonstr ated that binding to PD-1 results in enhanced
T-cell pro liferation and release of IFN- γin vitro.
1.4.6 Nivolumab: Toxicity
Toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys revealed that nivolumab was well tolerated at doses
up to 50 mg/kg given twice weekly for 27 doses. Serum chemistry changes were limited to areversible 28% decrease in triiodothyronine in females without concomitant abnormalities in other
markers of thyroid function.
Preliminary new non-clinical safety findings of adverse pregnancy outcomes and infant losses in
the absence of overt maternal toxicity have been reported.
23The findings of increased late-stage
pregnancy loss and early infant deaths/euthanasia in nivolumab-exposed pregnant monkeys
suggest a potential risk to human pregnancy if there is continued treatment with nivolumab during
pregnancy.

[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetics of Nivolumab
The PK of nivolumab were studied in subjects over a dose range of 0.1 to 20 mg/kg administered 
as a single dose or as multiple doses of nivolumab Q2W or Q3W. Based on a population 
pharmacokinetics (PPK) analysis using data from patients with various tumor types, including MEL, NSCLC, and RCC and a time varying CL model, nivolumab CL was shown to decrease 
over time, with a median maximal reduction from baseline values of approximately 25% resulting 
in a geometric mean steady state clearance (CLss) (percent coefficient of variation [% CV]) of 8.2
mL/h (53.9 %). The decrease in CLss is not considered to be clinically relevant. The geometric 
mean [% CV] apparent volume of distribution at st eady state (Vss) is 6.8 L (27.3%), and geometric 
mean elimination T-HALF is 25 days (77.5%). Steady-st ate concentrations of nivolumab were 
reached by 12 weeks when administered at 3 mg /kg Q2W, and systemic accumulation was 
approximately 3.7-fold. The exposure to nivolumab  increased dose proportionally over the dose 
range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg administered Q2W. The CL  of nivolumab increased with increasing body 
weight. The PPK analysis suggested that the following factors had no clinically important effect on the CL of nivolumab: age (29 to 87 years), gender, race, bas eline lactate dehydrogenase, PD-
L1, solid tumor type, baseline tumor size, and hepatic impairment. 
Although Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status, baseline glomerular filtration rate, 
albumin, body weight, had an effect on nivolumab CL, the effect was not clinically meaningful. 
PPK analysis suggested that nivolumab CL in subjects with cHL was approximately 32% lower 
relative to subjects with NSCLC; however, the lower CL in cHL subjects was not considered to be 
clinically relevant as nivolumab exposure was not a significant predictor for safety risks for these 
patients.
Full details on the clinical pharmacology aspects of nivolumab can be found in the IB.

1.4.13 Rationale for Selection of Schedule, Dose, and Tumor Types
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Schedule, Dose, and Tumor Types for the Dose Escalation
and Cohort Expansion (Part 1; Completed) and the SCCHN Cohort 
Expansion (Part 2; Completed): Lirilumab and Nivolumab Weight-based
Dosing
The nivolumab dose of 3 mg/kg is an active dose that is well tolerated. Doses of lirilumab given
as a single agent have ranged from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, resulted in pharmacodynamic modulation of
the target, and been well tolerated. This is the first study evaluating the combination of these2 antibodies. Therefore, the nivolumab dose will remain constant at 3 mg/kg and the lirilumabantibody will be tested in dose escalation at 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg. Based on further data that
may emerge, evaluating higher Dose Levels will be considered as appropriate. This is a Phase 1/2
study to determine the safety of the antibodies gi ven in combination, so all subjects with solid
tumors (with the exception of primary central nervous system [CNS] tumors) are eligible toparticipate during dose escalation. Nivolumab has shown clinical benefit in subjects with various
solid tumors. Thus, following dose escalation, subjects with select tumor types will be eligible toparticipate in the cohort expansion part of the study in order to gather additional safety, tolerability,preliminary efficacy, and pharmacodynamic information regarding the combination of lirilumaband nivolumab.

[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Schedule, Dose, and Tumor Types for the SCCHN 
Randomized Cohorts (Part 3 - closed to enrollment) and the Signal 
Detection Cohort Expansion (Part 4 - removed): Flat Doses
A flat dose of nivolumab 240 mg Q2W (Study Days 1, 15, 29, and 43 in an 8-week cycle) will be
used in combination with a flat dose of lirilumab 240 mg Q4W (Study Days 1 and 29) in the
SCCHN Randomized Cohorts (Part 3) either in combination with lirilumab or as monotherapy in combination with placebo for lirilumab.
Nivolumab monotherapy has been extensively studied in the NSCLC patient population in Studies 
CA209003, CA209063, CA209017, and CA209057 with  body-weight-normalized dosing 
(milligram per kilogram). Ni volumab PK and exposures of subjects in these studies have been 
characterized by [CONTACT_323431], together with PK data from 
several Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical studies of nivolumab monotherapy in solid tumors. Nivolumab PK was determined to be linear, with dose-proportional exposures over a dose range of 0.1 to 
10 mg/kg. Nivolumab CL and volume of distribut ion were found to increase with increasing body 
weight, but the increase was less than proportional, indicating that a milligram per kilogram dose 
represents an over-adjustment for the effect of body weight on nivolumab PK. Conversely, given 
the relationship between nivolumab PK and body we ight, a flat dose is expected to lead to lower 
exposures in heavier subjects, r elative to the e xposures in lighter subjects.
Table [IP_ADDRESS]-1 presents su mmary statistics of the es timated nivolumab  steady-state trough, peak,
and time-averaged concentration (steady-state t rough concentration [Cminss],  steady-state peak 
concentration [Cmaxss], and time-averaged c oncentration at dosing interval [Cavgss], 
respectively) in NSCLC subjects receiving 3 mg/ kg, together with c orresponding statistics of 
exposures predicted for a flat dose of nivolumab 240 mg. It should be noted that a dose of 
nivolumab 240 mg is identical to a dos e of 3 mg/kg for subjects weighing 80 kg, which is the 
approximate median body weight of NSCLC subjects in the 3 Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies of 
nivolumab monotherapy in NSCLC subjects (CA209017, CA209057, and CA209063). As evident from the data presented in Table [IP_ADDRESS]-1, the geometric mean values of Cminss, Cmaxss, and 
Cavgss with flat dosing are slightly (< 15%) higher than that produced by a 3-mg/kg dose, and the 
%CV in these measures of exposure is only sli ghtly (< 10%) greater than that of the 3-mg/kg

relatively flat. Taken together, the PK, safety, and efficacy data indicate that the safety and efficacy 
profile of nivolumab 240 mg will be similar to th at of nivolumab 3 mg/kg and will be used in 
Part 3. 
The PK and safety of nivolumab have been evaluated in the Asian population. The comparison of 
PK parameters in global and Japanese subjects suggests that the PK of nivolumab is similar in these populations. Nivolumab is shown to be safe and w ell tolerated in Japa nese subjects. The 
similar PK and safety profile of nivolumab between  global and Japanese subjects supports the use 
of similar dosing in the Asian population as is being used in global clinical studies.
Based on these data, a flat dose of nivolumab 240 mg Q2W is appropriate for further investigation.
Lirilumab is being studied as a potential imm unotherapy alone and in combination with other 
agents in subjects with various hematologic ma lignancies and solid tumors with body weight 
norm alized dosing (milligram per kilogram). A preliminary PPK analysis of data collected from 3 
studies (CA223001, CA223002, and CA223003) suggests that lirilumab PK is linear, with dose 
proportional exposures over a dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg. Lirilumab CL and volume of 
distribution was found to increase with increasing body weight, but the increase was less than 
proportional, indicating that a milligram per kilogram dose represents an over-adjustment for the 
effect of body weight on lirilumab PK. Conversely,  given the relationship between lirilumab PK 
and body weight, a flat dose is expected to lead to lower exposures in heavier subjects, relative to 
the exposures in lighter subjects.

As of 30-Aug-2016, 159 subjects were treated with the lirilumab plus nivolumab combination in 
Study CA223001. Nivolumab was administered at 3 mg/kg Q2W and lirilumab was administered 
Q4W at doses ranging from 0.1 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg. Most of the 159 treated subjects were treated 
at the nivolumab 3 mg/kg + lirilumab 3 mg/kg Dose Level. TRAEs and Grade 3 to 4 TRAEs were 
reported in 72% (114/159) and 15% (24/159) of sub jects, respectively. Discontinuations due to 
TRAEs occurred in 8% (12/159) of subjects. The rates of AEs of the combination of lirilumab and nivolumab are consistent to what has been reported with nivolumab monotherapy with the 
exception of infusion related reactions which were higher in the combination. These infusion 
reactions were Grade [ADDRESS_399079] i nfusion and did 
not lead to discontinuation.
As of 15-Jul-2016, 22 subjects were treated with the lirilumab plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_323358]223002. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_323359] 3 mg/kg and lirilumab was administered at 
doses ranging from 0.1 to 3 mg/ kg. Subjects received lirilumab in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 
Q3W for a total of 4 doses (induction), and then  Q12W for an additional 4 doses starting at Week 
24 (maintenance). Three subjects were adminis tered lirilumab 0.1 mg/ kg + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg, 
8 with lirilumab 0.3 mg/kg + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg, 6 with lirilumab 1 mg/kg + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg, and 5 with lirilumab 3 mg/kg + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg. At the second dose level (lirilumab 0.3 mg/kg + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg), [ADDRESS_399080] reported iridocyclitis during the DLT period. This was a Grade 2 event that did not improve to Grade 1 within 2 weeks despi[INVESTIGATOR_323360], resulting in a DLT. The second cohort (lirilumab 0.3 mg/kg 
+ ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg) was thus expanded to [ADDRESS_399081] cohort (lirilumab 1 mg/kg + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg), [ADDRESS_399082] reported a D LT of Grade 3 rash. This cohort was thus 
expanded to 6 evaluable subjects, and no further D LT occurred in these subjects. In the fourth 
cohort (lirilumab 3 mg/kg + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg), 5 subjects were enrolled; [ADDRESS_399083] visit was occurred on 
21-Apr-2015. This termination was due to strategic reasons and not due to any safety concerns.

1.4.14 Rationale for Use of Immune-Related Response Criteria
NOTE: This sec tion will only be applicable for the Dose Escalation and Cohort Expansion (Part 1; 
completed) and the S CCHN Cohort Expansion (Part 2; completed) of this study.
Clinical evidence suggests that some subjects tr eated with immune-modulating agents may have
PD before demonstrating clinical response.32The mechanism behind this finding is unknown but
may include an early inflammatory and immune cell trafficking phase that can be misinterpreted
as tumor growth or as the kinetics of fast tumor growth vs initial slow anti -tumor activity. What is
clear is that the use of standard response criteria has the potential of removing subjects from studytoo early. In the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_323362], approximately 10% of subjects who were deriving clinical
benefit had evidence of disease progression as deter mined by [CONTACT_323432].
22Therefore, exploratory response criteria modified from Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors (RECIST) have been developed t o take into account an immune-mediated pattern
of objective response (irRECIST).[ADDRESS_399086] version 1.1 (v1.1) criteria

with Lirilumab, Nivolumab, and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_323364] (Part 5), biopsies will be mandatory at 
baseline if a subject has accessible lesions and if the risks associated with obtaining biopsies are 
deemed clinically acceptable as judged by [CONTACT_093]. In addition  
the Signal Detection in SCCHN with Lirilumab, Nivolumab, and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251564] (Part 5), all subjects will have a fresh biopsy collected on treatment if biopsy risk is 
acceptable. All subjects will be offered the opportunity to undergo biopsies at any time during the
study. In addition, any tumor that remains following clinically indicated procedures s hould be
saved as fresh frozen tumor or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor or both and
submitted for biomarker testing. Tumor biopsies are required in these cohorts in order to characterize status 
and expression of tumor specific proteins such as PD-L1
 
 
A previous amendment has changed the timing
of the on-treatment biopsy to approximately 4 weeks ± 3 days on therapy to increase the likelihoodof obtaining tumor tissue in subjects. In  the Signal 
Detection in SCCHN with Lirilumab, Nivoluma b, and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_90843] (Part 5) the on-
treatment biopsy will be collected at Day 15 ± 3 to ensure that tumor tissue is available from all subjects.

[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Shorter Infusion Times for Nivolumab Monotherapy
The impact of infusion t ime on nivolumab safety has been assessed in an ongoing 
community-based trial (CA209153) in subjects with previously treated advanced or metastatic 
NSCLC.33As of an interim data lock on 26-Oct-2015, 322 subjects received nivolumab 3 mg/kg 
Q2W via a 30-minute infusion and [ADDRESS_399089] to 
the incidence of any-grade treatment-related AEs (53% and 51%, respectively). The incidence of 
Grade [ADDRESS_399090] AEs occurring in ≥2% of subjects was comparable in the pulmonary (3% and 
2%), hepatic (2% and 3%), a nd gastrointestinal (2% and 2%) categories between the 30- and 
60-minute infusion groups. Any-grade infusion reacti ons occurred in 3% and 2% of sub jects given 
30- or 60-minute infusions, respectively. The incid ence of Grade 3 to 4 infusion reactions was 
< 1% for both infusion groups. Table [IP_ADDRESS]-1 shows the individual AEs reported within the 
hypersensitivity/infusion reaction category.

Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions were ge nerally manageable usi ng dosing interruptions 
(8 subjects in the 30-minute infusion and 3 subjects in the 60-minute infusion), with only a limited 
impact on the dose received. Systemic corticosteroids were admin istered in a limited number of 
cases ([ADDRESS_399091] in the 60-minute infusion), and treatment was discontinued as a result of hypersensitivity/infusio n reactions in even fewer cases ([ADDRESS_399092]
in the 30-minute infusion and 2 subjects in the 60-minute infusion).
In addition, the PPK modeling demonstrated similar exposures in both i nfusion groups 
(Figure [IP_ADDRESS]-1), s uggesting that the 30-minute i nfusion does not pose an increased risk to 
subjects.
Figure [IP_ADDRESS]-1: Model-predicted  Cmax After the First Dose and at Steady State by 
[CONTACT_323434], nivolumab can be safely infused over 30 minutes, and the safety profile is 
comparable to the 60-minute infusion, with a low incidence of i nfusion-related reactions. As a 
result, the 30-minute infusion time has been implemented across the entire nivolumab program.
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Shorter Infusion Times for Nivolumab in Combination with 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_323365], especially when multiple agents are administered sequentially to an

duration:
•Nivolumab has been administered safely over 60 minutes at doses ranging up to 10 mg/kg over 
long treatment duration. In Study CA209010 (a Phase 2, randomized, double-blinded, dose-
ranging study of nivolumab in subjects with advanced/metastatic clear cell RCC), a dose 
association was observed for in fusion site reactions a nd hypersensitivity reactions (1.7% at 0.3 
mg/kg, 3.7% at 2 mg/kg, and 18.5% at 10 mg/kg). All the events were Grade 1 to 2 and were 
manageable. An infusion duration of 30 minutes for 3 mg/kg, or 240 mg, or 360 mg is not expected to present any safety concerns comp ared to the prior experience with the nivolumab 
10-mg/kg dose infused over a 60-minute duration.
•Similarly, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 10 mg/kg has been sa fely administered over 90 minutes. In 
Study CA184022, where ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251395] a dose of 10 mg/kg, on-study drug-related hypersensitivity events (Grade 1 to 2) were reported in [ADDRESS_399093] (1.4%) in the 
0.3 mg/kg group and in 2 subjects (2.8%) in the 10 mg/kg group. There were no drug-related 
hypersensitivity events reported in the 3 mg/kg group. Across the 3 treatment groups, no Grade 
3 to 4 drug-related hypersensitivity events were  reported, and there were no reports of infusion 
reactions. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 10 mg /kg monotherapy has also been saf ely administered as a 90-minute 
infusion in large Phase 3 studies in prostate can cer (Study CA184043) and as adjuvant therapy 
for stage 3 MEL (Study CA184029), with i nfusion reactions occurring in sub jects. 
Administering ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg represents one-tenth of the 10-mg/kg dose.
Of note, Study CA209153, a Phase 3b/[ADDRESS_399094] 1 prior systemic regimen, has used 
a 30-minute infusion in a cohort of 332 subjects with no safety issues.

Lirilumab infusion for all parts of the study will remain at 60 minutes. In this study, the r ate of 
infusion r eactions seen with nivolumab  and lirilumab combination is 18%. These reactions were 
Grades [ADDRESS_399095] been uncommon
across nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_323368]. Furthermore, a 30-minute break after the infusion 
of each drug of the combination w ill ensure the appropriate safety monitoring before the start of 
the subsequent infusion. Overall, a change in safety profile is not anticipated with a 30-minute 
infusion of nivolumab, ip ilimumab, with 60-minute infusion of lirilumab.

retreatment upon progression. Among 163 patients still on tr eatment at 1 year and without 
progression, those who were randomized to continue nivolumab had significant improvement in 
progression-free survival (PFS) compared to thos e who were randomized to  stop treatment, with 
median PFS (post-ra ndomization) not reached  vs 10.3 months, resp ectively; HR=0.42 (95% CI, 
0.25 to 0.71). With a median follow-up of 14.[ADDRESS_399096]-randomization, there also was a trend for patients on continued treatment to live longer (OS HR = 0.63 [95% CI: 0.33, 1.20]). Of note, the PFS curves in both groups plateau approximately 1 year after randomization (ie., 2 years after 
treatment initiation), suggesting that there may be minimal benefit in extending treatment beyond 
a total of [ADDRESS_399097] that 2 years of PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor treatment may be 
sufficient for long term benefit. In study CA209003, a dose-escalation cohort expansion trial 
evaluating the safety and clinical activity of nivo lumab in patients with previously treated 
advanced solid tumors (including 129 subjects with NSCLC), specified a maximum tr eatment 
duration of 2 years. Among 16 subjects with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who discontinued nivolumab after completing 2 years of treatment, 12 subjects were alive >5 years and remained progression-free without any subsequent therapy. In the CA209003 NSCLC cohort, the overall survival (OS) curve begins to plateau after  2 years, with an OS rate of 25% at 2 years and 
18% at 3 years.
35These survival outcomes are similar to phase 3 studies in previously treated 
NSCLC, in which nivolumab treatment was continued until progression or un acceptable toxicity 
(2 year OS rates of 23% and 29%, and 3 year OS rates of 16% - 18% for squamous and non-
squamous NSCLC respectively).[ADDRESS_399098] that there is minimal if any benefit derived from continuing I-O 
treatment beyond two years in advanced tumors. However, even though immunotherapy is well tolerated, patients will be at risk for additional toxicity with l onger term tr eatment. There fore, in

1.5 Overall Risk/Benefit Assessment
Subjects with recurrent, unresectable or metastatic tumors represent an important unmet need. 
Lirilumab is an NK cell-directed anti-KIR antibody and has the potential to im prove clinical
outcomes in tumors where NK cell biology plays an important role. There is clinical data available 
to suggest the potential to improve clinical outcomes in tumors included in this study.
•Clinical activity of nivolumab monotherapy in subjects with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN 
who progressed from a platinum-containing therapy evaluated in CA209141 randomized Phase 3 study, demonstrated  prolonged survival benefit with nivolumab as compared to investigator’s

choice (IC) of chemotherapy. In these populations, the safety profile of nivolumab was shown 
to be favorable as compared to standard of care chemotherapy. 
•At the time of Amendment 13, preliminary data in 29 evaluable recurrent and metastatic 
SCCHN subjects whose disease progressed on or after platinum-based therapy treated with the 
combination of lirilumab plus nivolumab showed an ORR of 24% (7/29) in the all-comer 
population and an ORR of 41% (7/17) in the PD-L1+ population.1No responses (0/12) were 
observed in the PD-L1 negative population. Also of note, in 5 out of 7 lirilumab plus 
nivolumab responders, the reduction in tumor burden was substantial, exceeding greater than 
80%. Responses appeared durable, with the median DOR not reached. Subsequent efficacy 
analysis of additional SCCHN subjects treated with the combination of lirilumab and nivolumab did not demonstrate a differential efficacy signal as compared to nivolumab 
monotherapy treatment in a s imilar population of SCCHN subjects. Therefore, with Revised 
Protocol 12, enrollment in Parts [ADDRESS_399099] clinical benefit with the combination of 
lirilumab and nivolumab without an increase in adverse events will be permitted to remain on 
study treatment un til protocol-specified discontinuation criteria are met. 
•Transcriptome data from [ADDRESS_399100] high infiltration of NK cells and KIR gene expression suggesting that KIR 
blockade with lirilumab may enhance antitumor activity of nivolumab in p atients with 
SCCHN. In addition analysis of tumor tissues from patients with NSCLC showed that the expression of NK cells in squamous cell carcinoma was significantly higher than in 
adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma and the survival time of lung cancer patients was 
positively related to NK- cell infiltr ation degree in lung cancer
37supporting the evaluation of 
lirilumab in combination with nivolumab in tumors with squamous histology
•Clinical activity of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_323370]. Analysis of the immune infiltration in a large cohort of head and neck tumors, integrating genetic data with RNA-seq–
based deconvolution of immune cell populations and effector/regulatory molecules was done
[ADDRESS_399101] that head and neck 
tumors possess an immune landscape that is poised to respond to immunotherapeutic 
approaches that block inhibitory signals to T cells and NK cells, such as immune checkpoint 
inhibitors (nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]), in cluding antibodies blocking KIR signaling 
(lirilumab). In addition, clinical activity of nivolumab plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_323371]-IV NSCLC as first-line treatm ent in CA 209012 st udy, a large Phase 1, multi-
arm safety study of nivolumab monotherapy and nivolumab in combination with various systemic anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_323372]. Clinical activity was observed in all 
combination cohorts with numerically higher response rates observed in cohorts evaluating 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg, with confirmed response rates ≥30% and 
median PFS ~8 months. Given the similarity in  patient profiles of NSCLC and SCCHN, 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg Q6W will be the tr eatment reg imen used 
in the reference arm and the backbone regimen for the experimental arm to which lirilumab

Furthermore, lirilumab in combination with nivolumab or with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_323373]. The safety profile associated with 
lirilumab in combination with nivolumab was generally consistent with that observed with 
nivolumab monotherapy. TRAEs were reported in 217 of 322 (67.4%) patients and Grade 3 to 4

back pain (27.3%), dia rrhea (27.3%), pneum onia (27.3%), pyrexia (27.3%), and vo miting (27.3%). 
Lastly, the safety profile of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_323323] a large safety

observed in clinical trials are those associated with activation of the immune system. The most common types of immune-mediated AEs include endocrinopathies, diarrhea/colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis and rash. In the combination regimen, the frequency and intensity of these events may vary and depend on the specific dose and schedule used. In the combination dosing 
schedule selected for this study (nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg Q6W), 
immune-mediated AEs were mostly low grade and manageable with prompt use of corticosteroids.

To assure an ongoing favorable risk/benefit assessment for subjects enrolled onto CA223001, the 
following safety measures will be employed throughout the conduct of the study:
•Rigorous safety monitoring by [CONTACT_323435]’ safety including regular and systematic 
review of safety data, close follow-up of reported safety events, intensive site and study 
investigator training/education on the implementation of the immune-related toxicity 
management algorithms as well as regular safety conference calls with study investigators.
•Safety lead-in: Initially approximately 10 subjects w ill be enrolled each in the Signal 
Detection in SCCHN with Lirilumab, Nivolumab, and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_90843] (Part 5) and 
followed for at least [ADDRESS_399102] clinical benefit with the combin ation of lirilumab and nivolumab without an 
increase in adverse ev ents will be permitted to remain on study tr eatment un til protocol-

[IP_ADDRESS] Cohort Expansion (Completed)
The purpose of the cohort expa nsions is to gather additional safety, tolerability, preliminary
efficacy, and pharmacodynamic information regarding the combination of lirilumab and
nivolumab. Once the safety profile of all doses tested has been characterized and the MTD ofcombined administration of lirilumab and nivolumab has been defined, the cohort expansion will
be initiated at the MTD, the MAD, or an alternate dose, if recommended by [CONTACT_323438]. Treatment doses in the cohort expansion groups will not exceed the MAD. Five c ohort
expansions will be restricted to the tumor types listed in Table [IP_ADDRESS]-[ADDRESS_399116] demonstrated activity with nivolumab monotherapy, will be used to assess
increased activity of the combination therapy. The colorectal cancer ( CRC), SCCHN, and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cohorts will explore activity of the combination therapy in tumors
with unknown or historically low responses to nivolumab monotherapy. Continuous evaluation of
toxicity events in the cohort expansions will be performed throughout enrollment in the cohort

expansions. If the rate of DLTs exceeds 33%, then the findings will be discussed and further
enrollment may be inte rrupted. If a cohort expansion is discontinued due to toxicity, a new cohort
may be initiated at a previously tested lower Dose Level.
In each of the NSCLC and MEL cohorts, approximately 35 subjects will be enrolled to allow for
a more precise estimate of the ORR in these tumors following combination tr eatment. The sample
size for the other 3 cohorts will be guided by [CONTACT_323439]38design. In order to determine if a target
response rate (eg, 25 to 30%) is likely, an initial number of subjects (eg, 9) will be treated at first
(Stage I) in a cohort, as outlined in Table [IP_ADDRESS]-1. In the tumo r cohort in which no responses are
observed, it will be concluded that the true response rate is unlikely to be greater than or equal to
the target rate and no more subjects will be enrolled in that cohort. Otherwise, in the cohorts in
which at least 1 respons e among the Stage I subjects is observed, up to 9 additional subjects will
be treated for a total of 18 subjects per tumor type, as gui ded by [CONTACT_50489] [IP_ADDRESS]-2. In Stage I,
approximately 9 subjects will be enro lled per tumor type. The number of sub jects enrolled in Stage
II per tumor cohort will be guided by [CONTACT_256193] r esponders observed in Stage I and the required
precision of the ORR es timate. This is su mmarized in Table [IP_ADDRESS]-2 below, usin g a precision of
12% around the ORR point estimate.

The actual sample size per cohort in Stage II to achiev e desired precision (standard error) of 12%

3.1.2 The SCCHN Cohort Expansion (Part 2; Completed)
To further explore emerging efficacy and safety data in subjects with SCCHN; an additional cohort
of approximately 35 subjects will be treated at Dose Level 4 (see Table 4.1-1 ). The null hypothesis 
that the true ORR is 25% w ill be tested against a one-sided alternative: ORR = 40%. The null 
hypothesis will be rejected if 12 or more responses are observed in 35 subjects. This design gives
a 1-sided type I error rate of 0.15 and a power of 0.81.
Subjects will complete up to 4 study periods: screening, treatment, clinical follow-up, and survival 
follow-up. Screening (up to 28 days). Treatment (up to maximum of 2 years). Clinical follow-
up(150 days). Survival follow-up (up to [ADDRESS_399117] dose of study drug). Survival

Females treated with HRT are likely to have artif icially suppressed FSH levels and may require a
washout period in order to ob tain a physiologic FSH level. The duration of the washout period is
a function of the type of HRT used. The durations of the washout periods below are suggested
guidelines and the investigators should use their judgement in checking serum FSH levels. If the
serum FSH level is > 40 mIU/mL at any time during the washout period, the woman can beconsidered postmenopausal.

•Immunosuppressive agents (except as stated in  Section 3.4.3).
•Immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (except as stated in Sections 3.4.2 and 
3.4.3)
•Any concurrent anti-neoplastic therapy (ie, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, 
extensive, non-palliative radiation therapy, or standard or investigational agents).
3.4.2 Other Restrictions and Precautions
Subjects with a condition requiring systemic tr eatment with either corticosteroids (prednisone > 10 
mg daily or equivalent) or other immunosuppressi ve medications within 14 days of study drug
assignment or randomization are excluded. Inhaled or topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826], a nd adrenal replacement 
steroid doses prednisone > 10 mg daily or equivalent, are permitted in the absence of active 
autoimmune disease.
3.4.3 Permitted Therapy
Subjects are permitted the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], ocular, intra-articular, intra-nasal, and inhalational 
corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption). Adrenal replacement steroid doses prednisone 
> 10 mg daily are permitted. A brief (< 3 weeks) course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (eg, 
contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of no n-autoimmune conditions (eg, delayed-type 
hypersensitivity reaction caused by a contact [CONTACT_20435]) is permitted.

complications of disease progression (eg, CNS metastases)
•Subjects have provided written i nformed consent prior to receiving additional tr eatment with

In the combination setting, subjects who meet criteria may continue on lirilumab and nivolumab 
in combination but may not continue on 1 treatment or the other alone.
For the SCCHN Randomized Cohorts ( Part 3), and the Signal D etection in SCCHN with 
Lirilumab, Nivolumab, and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_90843] (Part 5), d ecisions related to tr eatment 
beyond progression will be made with RECIST v1.1. Subjects should discontinue study therapy upon further evidence of further progression, defined 
as an additional 10% or greater increase in tumor burden volume from time of init ial progression 
(including all target lesions and new measurable lesions).
New lesions are considered  measureable at th e time of init ial progression if th e longest diameter 
is at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes which must have a short axis of at 
least15 mm). Any new lesion considered nonmeasureable at the time of init ial progression may 
become measureable and therefore included in the tumor burden if the longest diameter increases 
to at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph node s, which must have a short axis of at least 
15 mm).
3.6 Treatment of Infusion Reactions
All Grade 3 or 4 infusion r eactions should be reported within 24 hours to the BMS Medical 
Monitor and reported as an SAE if criteria are met. Infusion reactions should be graded according 
to NCI CTCAE (v4.03) guidelines.
Of note, since nivolumab contains only human immunoglobulin protein sequences, it is unlikely 
to be immunogenic and induce infusion or hypersensi tivity reactions. However, if such a reaction 
were to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, rigors, headache, ra sh, pruritus, arthralgia, hypo-
or hypertension, bronchospasm, or other symptoms. Treatment recommendations applicable for all study d rugs are provided below and may be 
modified based on local treatment standards and guidelines as appropriate:
For Grade 1 symptoms : (Mild reaction; infusion inte rruption not i ndicated; intervention not 
indicated)
Remain at bedside and monitor subject until rec overy from symptoms. The following prophylactic 
premedications are recommended for fu ture infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equiv alent) 
and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen) at least 30 minutes before additional 
nivolumab administrations.

For Grade 2 symptoms : (Moderate reaction requires therapy or i nfusion inte rruption but responds 
promptly to symptomatic treatment [eg, antihis tamines, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 
narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; prophylactic medications indicated for ≤ 24 
hours).
Stop the nivolumab infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and tr eat the subject with
diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen);
remain at bedside and monitor subject until resolution of symptoms. Corticosteroid or
bronchodilator therapy may also be administered as appropriate. If the infusion is interrupted, then 
restart the infusion at 50% of th e original infusion rate when symptoms resolve; if no further
complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be  increased to 100% of the original infusion
rate. Monitor subject closely. If symptoms recur then no further nivolumab will be administered
at that visit. Administer diphenhydramine [ADDRESS_399180] be recorded on the electronic 
case report form (eCRF). The following prophylactic premedications are recommended for future 
infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equiv alent) and/or par acetamol 325 to  1000 mg 
(acetaminophen) should be adminis tered at least 30 minutes before additional nivolumab 
administrations. If necessary, corticosteroids (recommended dose: up to 25 mg of IVhydrocortisone or equivalent) may be used.
For Grade 3 or Grade 4 symptoms: (Severe reaction, Grade 3: prolonged [ie, not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_323387]/or bri ef interruption of infusion]; recurrence of
symptoms following initial improvement; hospi [INVESTIGATOR_193175] [eg, 
renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates]). Grade 4: (life threatening; presser or vent ilatory support 
indicated).
Immediately discontinue infusion of nivolumab. Begi n an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat
the subject as follows. Recommend bronchodilators, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 0.2 to 1 mg of a 1:1,000 solution 
for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 solution injected slowly for IV 
administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or 
equivalent), as needed. Subject should be monitored until the investigator is comfortable that the 
symptoms will not recur. Nivolumab will be permanently discontinued. Investigators should
follow their institutional guidelines for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside andmonitor subject until recovery from symptoms . In the case of late-occurring hypersensitivity
symptoms (eg, appearance of a localized or generalized pruritus within 1 week after treatment),
symptomatic treatment may be given (eg, oral antihistamine, or corticosteroids).
If any vital sign is abnormal at the final check, th e subject must be observed further for a period 
of time, as clinically indicated.
The start and stop time of the study drug i nfusion s hould be documented. If there are any new or 
worsening clinically significant changes since th e last examination, report changes on the

Applicable for the single-blinded SCCHN Randomized Cohorts (Part 3).
Blinding of treatment assignment is critical to the integrity of this clinical study. However, in the 
event of a medical emergency or pregnancy in an individual subject in which knowledge of the 
investigational product is critical to the sub ject's management, the blind for that subject may be 
broken by [CONTACT_093]. The subject’s safety takes priority over any other considerations in 
determining if a treatment assignment should be unblinded.
Before breaking the blind of an individual subject’s treatment, the investigator s hould d etermine 
that the unblinded information is necessary, ie, that it w ill alter the subject's immediate 
management. In many cases, particularly when the emergency is clearly not related to the 
investigation al product, the problem may be properly managed by [CONTACT_82745]. It is highly desirable that the decision to unblind tr eatment assignment 
be discussed with the Medical M onitor, but the investig ator always has ulti mate authority for the 
decision to unblind. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_323389].
For this study, the method of unblinding fo r emergency purposes is the Interactive Response 
Technology (IRT).
In cases of accidental unblinding, contact [CONTACT_323457].
Any request to unblind a subject for non-emergency purposes should be discussed with the 
Medical Monitor.
In case of an emergency, the investigator(s) has unrestricted access to randomization i nformation 
via the IRT and is capable of breaking the blind through the IRT system without prior approval

4.5 Treatment Compliance
Study drug will be administered in the clinical f acility. The investigator or their designated study
personnel will maintain a log (Drug Accountability Log) of all study drugs received, dispensed
and destroyed. The investigator and the study personnel will ensure that each subject receives the
calculated dose of the study drug based on body weight.
Drug supplies will be inventoried and accounted for throughout the study. The Drug
Accountability Log will be reviewed by [CONTACT_323458]. Any discrepancy s hould be brought to the attention of the Sponsor. For 
the SCCHN Randomized Cohorts (Part 3), tr eatment compliance will be monitored by [CONTACT_323459]’s medical record and CRF.
4.6 Destruction and Return of Study Drug
4.6.1 Destruction of Study Drug
If study drugs (those supplied by [CONTACT_52240]) are to be destroyed on site,
it is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that arrangements have been made for the disposal,
procedures for proper disposal have been established according to applicable regulations,
guidelines and institutional procedures, and appropriate records of the disposal have beendocumented. The unused study drugs can only be destroyed after being inspected and reconciledby [CONTACT_323460].
4.6.2 Return of Study Drug
If study drug will not be destroyed upon completion or termination of the study, all unused and/or
partially used study drug that was s upplied by [CONTACT_20458]. The return of study

4.8.1 Definition
DLT will be determined based on the incidence, intensity, and duration of AEs as defined below 
that are related to study drug and that occur within 56 days (8 weeks, through the completion of
Cycle 1) of initiation of study drug in the Dose Escalation and Cohort Expansion (Part 1; completed). The severity of AEs will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03. Hepa tic, non-
hematologic, and hematologic DLT will be defined separately as outlined below.
4.8.2 Definition of Hepatic DLT
Any of the following events will be considered a hepatic DLT except for subjects with HCC:
•ALT or AST > 8 × ULN, regardless of duration
•A L To rA S T>5×a n d ≤8 × ULN, that fails to return to Grade 1 or less within 5 days despi[INVESTIGATOR_323390]
•Grade 3 total bilirubin
•ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and concurrent total bilirubin > 2 × ULN
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of Hepatic DLT for Subjects with HCC
In August 2011, an advisory board panel was convened to discuss tr eatment of subjects with
hepatitis B infection with or without HCC. The potential for hepatic flare with anti-viral therapy
such as entecavir, lamuvidine, o r tenofovir was discussed. It was the consensus of the panel
members that the risk for this toxicity was low in subjects with low viral DNA loads who were onanti-viral therapy for several months. In subjects with hepatitis C infection, transient Grade [ADDRESS_399197] or ALT > 10 × ULN for
> [ADDRESS_399198] or ALT > 15 × ULN irrespective of duration, total bilirubin > 8 × ULN
irrespective of duration for subjects with elevated bilirubin at study entry or > 5 × ULN for thosewith normal total bilirubin at study entry, concurrent AST or ALT > 3 × ULN and total bilirubin> 5 × ULN for subjects entering tr eatment with a normal b ilirubin and up to 8 × ULN for subjects
with elevated bilirubin, or clinical d eterioration manifested by [CONTACT_9934]-related hepatic
decompensation not identified above.
Therefore, for subjects with HCC, hepatic DLT criteria will differ due to intrinsic involvement of
the liver. In addition, for subjects with hepatitis B or hepatitis C, it is possible that virological
breakthrough may occ ur, leading to tem porary hepatic damage that i s greater than the parameters
detailed above. In these cases, subjects who regain virologic control may be allowed to resume
study therapy after agreement between the PI [INVESTIGATOR_117404].
Any of the following events will be considered a hepatic DLT for subjects with HCC:
•ALT or AST > 15 × ULN, regardless of duration
•ALT or AST > 10 × ULN for greater than 2 weeks

4.8.3 Definition of Non-hematologic DLT
Any of the following events will be considered a non-hematologic DLT:
•Grade 2 eye pain or reduction in visual acuity that requires systemic tr eatment
•Grade 2 eye pain or reduction in visual acuity that does not respond to topi[INVESTIGATOR_323391] 1 within 2 weeks of initiation of topi[INVESTIGATOR_8588]

The consideration to re-initiate study therapy under these exceptions will be made on a case by
[CONTACT_323461]/risk profile and in consultation between theinvestigator and the study Sponsor.
In cases where the AE meets the criteria for permanent discontinuation from study therapy, but the
investigator and the Sponsor believe that re-initiation of study therapy may be potenti ally
beneficial and justified, details will be submi tted in advance to the FDA or other r elevant health 
authorities for review, prior to re-initiation of study therapy.
The assessment for discontinuation of nivolumab should be made separately from the assessment 
made for discontinuation of lirilumab and/or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Although there is overlap among the discontinuation criteria, if discontinuation criteria are met for lirilumab and/or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45773], treatment with nivolumab may continue if lirilumab and/or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_186712].
If a subject in any of the study drug combinat ion cohorts meets criteria fo r discontinuation and 
investigator is unable to determine whether the event is related to a single study drug, the sub ject
should discontinue all study drugs and be taken off the treatment phase of the study.

•Lirilumab, nivolumab, and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_323396];
•Pharmacy binder;
•Laboratory manuals for collection and handling of blood (including PKs, biomarker, and
immunogenicity) and tissue specimens;
•Enrollment/ra ndomization w orksheets;
•SAE forms;
•Pregnancy surveillance forms.
•Subject questionnaires: EORTC-QLQ-C30, EORTC-QLQ-H&N35, EQ-5D-3L (for the Signal 
Detection Randomized Cohorts [Part 3] only).
•Dosing Procedure Manual.

significance and importance. AEs will be evaluated according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03. Subjects
should be followed until all treatment-r elated AEs have recovered to baseline or are deemed
irreversible by [CONTACT_093].
Some of the assessments referred to in this section may not be captured as data in the CRF. They 
are intended to be used for safety monitoring by [CONTACT_1963]. Additional testing or 
assessments may be performed as clinically necessary or where required by [CONTACT_53933].
At baseline, a medical history will be obtained to capture relevant underlyi ng conditions. Baseline
signs and symptoms are those that are assessed within [ADDRESS_399265] registration. The
baseline physical examination should include weight, height, heart rate, blood pressure,temperature and ECOG status and should be performed within 28 days of treatment assignmentfor the Dose Escalation and Cohort Expansion (P art 1) and the SCCHN Cohort Expansion (Part 2) 
and within 35 days of treatment assignment or randomization for all other study parts. Conco mitant
medications will be collected from within 2 weeks prior to treatment assign ment or randomization
through the study treatment period (see Section 5.1 ).
Subjects will be considered evaluable for safety if they have received any dose of either study
drug. Toxicity assessments will be continuous during the tr eatment period and the clinical follow-
up periods.
Body weight and performance status s hould be assessed at each on-study visit. Vital signs will be
obtained at timepoints according to Sectio n 5.1. For further details related to i nfusion reactions, 
see Section 3.6.

Additional measures including non-study required laboratory tests should be performed as
clinically indicated or to comply with local regulat ions. Laboratory toxicities (eg, suspected drug-
induced liver enzyme evaluations) will be monitored during the clinical follow-up period via on-
site/local laboratories until all study- drug-related toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are 
deemed irreversible.
Clinical laboratory measures will be assessed (see Section 5.1 ). Sites should co llect these samples
between -28 to -1 days from registration to insure that results required for eligibility purposes are
verified prior to registration (or between -35 to -1 days for sub jects in the Si gnal Detection in 
SCCHN with Lirilumab, Nivolumab, and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_90843] [Part 5]). Pregnancy testing
must be performed within [ADDRESS_399266] atbaseline and then prior to administration of either study drug during study therapy and at the
3 clinical follow-up visits. Complete blood count  plus differential and serum chemistry panel
should be drawn within 72 hours prior to each subsequent scheduled cycle. On-study laboratory
tests will be performed on si te/locally. Laboratory tests may be ob tained more frequently if
indicated. Additional laboratory tests should be pe rformed as per standard of care.
If a subject shows pulmonary-related signs (eg, hypoxia or fever) or symptoms (eg, dyspnea, 
cough, or fever) consistent with possible pulmonary AEs, the subject should be immediately evaluated to rule out pulmonary tox icity according to the suspected pulmonary toxicity 
management algorithm in the nivolumab IB.

5.3.1 Microsatellite Instability Testing
MSI-high in tumors refers to changes in 2 or more of the 5 NCI-recommended panels of
microsatellite markers in tumor tissue. The original (1997) Bethesda guidelines proposed a panelof 5 microsatellite markers for the uniform analysi s of MSI in hereditary non-polypos is CRC. This
panel, which is referred to as the Bethesda panel, included 2 mononucleotide (BAT-25 and BAT-
26) and 3 dinucleotide (D5S346, D2S123, and D17S250) repeats.
40Individual testing sites may
utilize a slightly different panel of markers incorporating alternativ e mononucleotide or
dinucleotide markers. Regardless of the panel of markers, samples with instability in zero or
[ADDRESS_399267] and/or MRI, as appropriate, will be performed at baseline and every

Cohort Expansion (Part 2; completed), investigator-assessed responses and treatment decisions 
related to subject management will be based on irRECIST9(seeAppendix 2 ); all other study parts

The SCCHN Randomized Cohorts (Part 3 - closed to enrollment)
The primary endpoint is ORR based on assessment in all subjects randomized to lirilumab plus 
nivolumab.
The secondary efficacy endpoints of the SCCHN Randomized Cohorts (Part 3) are DCR, DOR, 
time to response, depth of response, OS, PFS, , and ORR according to investigator-assessed 
response. All randomized subjects will be monitored by [CONTACT_200950] Q8W (± 7 days)
beginning from the first dose date until Week 48 and Q12W ( ±7 days) thereafter until PD or
treatment discontinuation (whichever o ccurs earlier), to determine changes in tumor s ize.

6 ADVERSE EVENTS
AnAdverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a
pre-existing medical condition in a clinical investigation subject administered an investigational
(medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this tr eatment.
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratoryfinding), symptom, or disease temporally asso ciated with the use of investigational product,
whether or not considered related to the investigational product.
The causal relationship to study drug is deter mined by a physician and should be used to assess all
AEs. The casual relationship can be one of the following:
Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between study drug administration and
the AE.
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study drug
administration and the AE.
The term “reasonable causal relationship” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship.
AEs can be spontaneously repor ted or elicited during open-ended questioning, examination, or
evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent re porting bias, subjects should not be questioned
regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
Immune-mediated AEs are AEs consistent wi th an immune-mediated  mechanism or immune-
mediated component for which non-inflammatory etiologies (eg, infection or tumor progression) 
have been ruled out. IMAEs can include events with an alternate etiology, which were exacerbated 
by [CONTACT_53995] y. Information supporting the assessment will be collected on the 
subject’s CRF.
6.1 Serious Adverse Events
ASerious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
•results in death
•is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of
the event; it does not refer to an event whic h hypothetically might have caused death if it were
more severe)
•requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312] (see NOTE
below)
•results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
•is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
•is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life-
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical andscientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical,
surgical] to prevent 1 of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above). Examples
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive t reatment in an emergency room or at
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscr asias or convulsions that do not result in

hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]). Po tential drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important
medical event. (See Section 6.6 for the definition of potential DILI).
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or non-pathogenic) via the study
drug is an SAE.
Although pregnancy, overdose, cancer, and potential DILI are not always serious by [CONTACT_323478], these events must be ha ndled as SAEs. (See Section 6.1.1 for re porting pregnancies).
Any component of a study endpoint that is considered rel ated to study therapy (eg, death is an
endpoint, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis , anaphylaxis must be reported) should be reported
as SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).
NOTE :
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_102412]:
−a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours, that does not result
in admission (unless considered an important medical or life-threatening event)
−elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
−admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure
−routine h ealth assess ment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health s tatus (eg,
routine colonoscopy)
−medical/surgical admission other than remedying ill h ealth s tate and planned prior to entry
into the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases
−admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health s tatus
and requires no medical/surgical intervention ( eg, lack of housing, economic inadequacy,
care-giver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative).
−admission for administration of anti-cancer therapy in the absence of any other SAEs
6.1.[ADDRESS_399274]’s wri tten consent to par ticipate in the study, all SAEs, whether related or not
related to study drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with protocol-
specified procedures. All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period and within
[ADDRESS_399275] be collected that relate to any laterprotocol-specified procedure (eg, a follow-up skin biopsy).
The investigator should re port any SAE occurring after these time periods that is believed to be
related to study drug or protocol-specified procedure.An SAE report should be comp leted for any event where doubt exists regarding its status of
seriousness.
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potenti ally related to the
conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy, or a complication of a study
procedure), the relationship should be specified in the narr ative section of the SAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS (ordesignee) within [ADDRESS_399276] be recorded on the SAE Report Form; pregnancies on a

to be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) transmission to:
SAE Email Address: See Contact [CONTACT_20491].
SAE Facsimile Number: See Contact [CONTACT_20491].
For studies capturing SAEs/pregnan cies through electronic data capture (EDC), electronic
submission is the required method for reporting. The paper forms should be used and submitted
immediately, only in the event the electronic system is unavailable for transmission. When paper
forms are used, the original paper forms are to remain on site.
SAE Telephone Contact (required for SAE and pregnancy reporting): See Contact [CONTACT_323479].If only limited information is initially available, fo llow-up reports are required. (Note: Follow-up
SAE reports should include the same inve stigator term(s) initially re ported.)
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new information
becomes available, a follow-up SA E report should be sent within 24 hours to BMS (or designee)
using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.
All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stab ilization.
6.2 Non-serious Adverse Events
ANon-serious Adverse Event is an AE not classified as serious.
6.2.1 Non-serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
The collection of non-serious AE information should begin at initiation of study drug. Non-serious
AE information s hould also be collected from t he start of a placebo lead-in period or other
observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects.
Non-serious AEs should be followed to resolution or stab ilization, or reported as SAEs if they
become serious (see Section 6.1.1 ). Follow-up is also required for non-serious AEs that cause
interruption or discontinuation of study drug and for those that are present at the end of study
treatment as a ppropriate. All identified non-serious AEs must be recorded and described on the
non-serious AE page of the CRF (paper or electronic).
Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities that
are reported/identified during the course of the study.
Every AE must be assessed by [CONTACT_323480]. For events that are potentially immune mediated, additional information w ill be 
collected on the subject’s CRF.
6.[ADDRESS_399277] result abnormalities should be captured on the non-serious AE CRF
page or SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate:
•Any laboratory test result that is clinically si gnificant or meets the definition of an SAE

•Any laboratory test result abnormality that requi red the subject to receive specific corrective
therapy.
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical, rather than laboratory term would be used by [CONTACT_228442] (eg, anemia vs low hemoglobin value).

8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
8.1 Sample Size Determination8.1.1 Dose Escalation (Part 1; Completed)
As this is a Phase 1/2 dose escalation cohort, the sample size at each dose cannot be determined
exactly, as it depends on the number of observed toxicities. Between 3 and 12 subjectsapproximately are expected to be treated during dose escalation in each Dose Level, and up to
15 subjects may be dosed at selected Dose Levels.
8.1.2 Cohort Expansion (Part 1; Completed)
During cohort expansion, approximately 18 subjects are expected to be e nrolled in each of the
3 unknown or low historic response cohort expansions and approximately 35 subjects in the
2 cohorts with higher historic ORR and treated at the previously determined MTD, MAD, or at an
alternative dose that is not to exceed the MAD.
CRC, SCCHN, and HCC c ohorts: The sample size for each tumor cohort will be guided by a
2-stage Gehan design.
38In order to determine whether a target ORR is likely in a tumor cohort,
9 subjects will be treated at Stage 1 in each tumor type, as outlined in Table [IP_ADDRESS]-1 . For a tumor

greater than or equal to the target ORR and no more subjects will be enrolled in these tumor cohorts. Otherwise, for the tumor cohort(s) in which at least [ADDRESS_399282] 9 subjects
is observed, up to an additional 9 subjects will be enro lled as guided by [CONTACT_50489] [IP_ADDRESS]-2 . With
9 subjects in Stage 1, per tumor there is no more than a 10% chance of declaring that there is notherapeutic effect when actually there is an effect. A total of up to 18 subjects across the 2 stagesper tumor will guaran tee an estimate of the true ORR with 12% precision.
NSCLC and MEL cohorts: A total of approximately 35 subjects will be enrolled in each of thesetumor cohorts based on achieving a higher precision with a reasonable control on the type I error.In a cohort of approximately 35 subjects, if 12, 14, or 16 responses are observed, then the lowerlimit of the 1-sided 90% CI for the ORR is 24%, 29%, or 34%, respectively. In addition,
19 responses would need to be observed in approximately 35 subjects so that the 90% 1-sided CIfor the ORR is entirely above 20%. These calculations are based on the lower limit of the Cl opper-
Pearson method for exact CIs. If the true ORR in a tumor type is 45%, then with approximately35 subjects in a cohort there is 96% chance of observing at least 10 responses, and 93% chance of
observing at least 11 responses, and there is 7% chance of observing 10 or fewer responses (false
negative rate). If the true ORR for a tumor is only 30% rather than 45%, then there is a 35% and14% chance, respectively, that there will be at least [ADDRESS_399283] 14 responses in approximately35 subjects (false positive rate).
The above numbers are approximate, as subjects treated during dose es calation with a tumor under
the same setting (eg, dose and population) as in cohort expansion may be included in the total n
per tumor.
8.1.3 The SCCHN Cohort Expansion (Part 2; Completed)
A total of approximately 35 subjects will be enro lled in the SCCHN Cohort Expansion (Part 2).
The null hypothesis that the true ORR is 25% will be tested against a 1-sided alternative: ORR =
40%. The null hypothesis will be rejected if 12 or more re sponses are observed in 35 subjects. This 
design gives a 1-sided type 1 error rate of 0.15 and a power of 0.81.
8.1.4 The SCCHN Randomized Cohorts (Part 3 - closed to enrollment)
The SCCHN Randomized  Cohorts (Par t 3) has a primary endpoint of ORR. A total of  225 subjects 
will be randomized in a 2:1 rati o to the 2 treatment arms, nivolu mab combined with lirilumab 
(Arm A) and nivolumab monotherapy (Arm B), stratified by [CONTACT_4002]-L1 ≥50% e xpression (yes/no) 
and prior treatment with cetuximab (yes/no).
Objective Response Rate:
The sample size is calculated to assess the ORR of lirilumab in combination with nivolumab. The 
type 1 error is set to 0.10 (2-sided) with no planned interim analysis. The final analysis for ORR will take p lace approximately [ADDRESS_399284] is randomized and treated. With 
150 subjects in Arm A, if 50 responses are observed, the estimated ORR will be 33% and the 90% 
CI will be [26%, 41%]. In Study CA209041, the 90% CI for the nivolumab arm in PD-L1+ (> 1%) 
subjects was [9%, 25%].

discontinuation of dosing or until they di scontinue the study as per Section 3.5.
•Incidence of clinical laboratory test abnormalities including hematology and serum chemistry, 
and thyroid panel abnormalities, assessed at speci fied timepoints as designated in the Time and 
Events Section ( 5.1).
Efficacy Endpoint Definitions
Study level endpoints used to assess the anti -tumor activity objective are defined as follows: 
ORR is defined as the total number of subjects whose BOR is either CR or PR divided by [CONTACT_323483].PFS rate is defined as the probability of a subject remaining progression-free and surviving to [ADDRESS_399295] be confirmed by a consecutive second (confirmatory) evaluation meeting the criteria for res ponse that is performed at least [ADDRESS_399296] met. The above will be determined based on tumor measurements occurring Q8W (± 7days) during the treatment period (or Q6W (± 7days) for 1 year [48 weeks] and Q12W (± 7days) afterwards for the Signal Detection in SCCHN with Lirilumab, Nivolumab, and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_90843] [Part 5] and once during the clinical follow-up period.

tumor assessment. Subjects who started any subs equent anti-cancer therapy without a prior 
reported progression will be censored at the last evaluable tumor assessment prior to or on 
initiation of the subsequent anti-cancer therapy. DOR will be evaluated for responders (confirmed 
CR or PR) only.
Time to response is defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first confirmed CR 
or PR. DOR will be evaluated for responders (confirmed CR or PR) only.DCR is defined as th e proportion of subjects w ith BOR equal to CR, unconfirmed CR, PR,

These general guidelines constitute guidance to the investigator and may be supplemented by 
[CONTACT_323495]. The guidance applies to all 
immuno-oncology (I-O) agents and regimens.
A general principle is that differential diagnoses should be diligently evaluated according to 
standard medical practice. No n-inflammatory etiologies s hould be consider ed and appropriately 
treated.
Corticosteroids are a primary therapy for I-O  drug-related adverse events (AE). The oral 
equivalent of the recommended intravenous doses  may be considered for ambulatory patients 
with low-grade toxicity. The lower bioavailability of oral corticosteroids should be taken into 
account when switching to the equivalent dose of oral corticosteroids.
Consultation with a medical or surgical specialist, especially prior to an invasive diagnostic or 
therapeutic procedure, is recommended.The frequency and severity of the related AEs covered by [CONTACT_323496] 
I-O agent or regimen being used.

slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum s ize for a measurable lesion should be twice the 
slice thickness.
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized measurable or non-measurable as 
follows:
1.[ADDRESS_399324] one dimension (longest diameter in 
the plane of the measurement to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
•[ADDRESS_399325]/MRI scan - (CT/MRI scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)
•10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be accurately measured 
with calipers should be recorded as non-measurable)
•[ADDRESS_399326] x-ray
•Malignant lymph nodes : To be considered pathologically enlarged andmeasurable, a lymph 
node must be ≥[ADDRESS_399327] scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis 
will be measured and followed.
1.2 Non-measurable lesions
•All other lesions, including small lesio ns (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathologi cal lymph 
nodes with ≥10 to < 15 mm short axis), as well as truly non-measurable lesions.  
•Lesions considered truly non-measurable include:  leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or 
pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast diseas e, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, 
abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_323497].
1.3 Special considerations regarding lesion measurability
1.3.1 Bone lesions
•Bone scan, PET scan or plain films are notconsidered adequate imaging techniques to 
measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or
disappearance of bone lesions.

•Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components , that 
can be evaluated by [CONTACT_102471].
•Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable.
1.3.2 Cystic lesions
•Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts s hould not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts.
•‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurab ility described above. However, if non-cystic 
lesions are present in the same subject, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.
1.3.3 Lesions with prior local treatment
Tumor lesions situated in a previously irrad iated area, or in an area subjected to other loco-
regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated 
progression in the lesion.  Measurable lesions may be  in an irradiated field as long as there is 
documented progression and the lesion(s) can be reproducibly measured.
1.4 Specifications by [CONTACT_12009]
1.4.1 Measurement of lesions
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation (mm). All bas eline evaluations s hould 
be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 30 days before the 
beginning of the treatment.
1.4.2 Method of assessment
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow- up. Imaging based evaluation should 
always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].
[IP_ADDRESS] CT/MRI scan
CT/MRI is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure  lesions selected for 
response assessment. Measurability of lesions on CT/MRI scan is based on the assumption that 
CT/MRI slice thickness is [ADDRESS_399328] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, 
the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.
[IP_ADDRESS] Chest X-ray
Chest CT is preferred over chest X-ray, particularly when progression is an important e ndpoint, 
since CT is more sensitive than X-ray, particularly in identifying new lesions. However, lesions 
on chest X-ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly defined and surrounded by

[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical lesions 
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and ≥10 mm 
diameter as assessed using calipers. For the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_30575] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is suggested. As previously noted, when lesions can be evaluated by [CONTACT_51752], imaging evaluation s hould be 
undertaken since it is more objective and may also be reviewed at the end of the study.
[IP_ADDRESS] Ultrasound 
Ultrasound is notuseful in assessment of lesion size and s hould not be used as a method of 
measurement. If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_251634], confirmation

2 BASELINE DOCUMENTATION OF ‘TARGET’ AND ‘NON-TARGET’ 
LESIONS
2.1 Target lesions
When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline all lesions up to a maximum of 
five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesio ns per organ) representative of all involved 
organs should be identified as target lesion sand will be recorded and measured at baseline.
Target lesions should be s elected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, and should lend themselves to reproducible repeated
measurements .
A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters .If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted below, only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as reference to f urther characterize any objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease.

2.2 Non-target lesions
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathologi cal lymph nodes s hould be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorde d at baseline. Measurements are not required and 
these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal 
progression’. In addition, it is possible to record multiple non-target lesions involving the same 
organ as a single item on the case record form  (e.g. ‘multiple enlar ged pelvic lymph nodes’ or 
‘multiple liver metastases’).
3 TUMOR RESPONSE EVALUATION 
3.1 Evaluation of target lesions
Immune-related Complete Response (irCR):  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any 
pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-targe t) must have reduction in short axis to <
10 mm.
Immune-related Partial Response (irPR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of 
target lesions and all new measurable lesions (ie Percentage Change in Tumor Burden) ,taking 
as reference the baseline sum diameters.
Note: the appearance of new measurable lesions is factored into the overall Tumor Burden , but 
does not automatically qualify as progressive disease until the sum of the diameters increases by 
≥20% when compared to nadir.
Immune-related Progressive Disease (irPD):  At least a 20% increase in Tumor Burden  (ie the 
sum of diameters of target lesions, and any new measurable lesions) taking as reference the
smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition 
to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 
5m m . Tumor assessments using immune-related criteria for progressive disease incorporates the 
contribution of new measurable lesions. Each net percentage change in tumor burden per assessment accounts for the size and growth kinetics of both old and new lesions as they appear.
Immune-related Stable Disease (irSD):  Neit her sufficient shrinkage to qualify for irPR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for irPD, taking as reference the s mallest sum d iameters while on 
study.

[IP_ADDRESS] Lymph nodesLymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal an atomical structures which may be

[IP_ADDRESS] Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’  
All lesions (nodal and non-nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements 
recorded at each subsequent ev aluation, even when ve ry small (e .g. 2 mm). If the radiologist is 
able to provide an actual measurement, that should be recorded, even if it is below [ADDRESS_399332] measure to then:
•if it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26191], the measur ement 
should be recorded as 0 mm. 
•if the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default 
value of 5 mm should be  assigned (note: in case of a lymph node b elieved to be present and 
faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm s hould be assigned in this 
circumstance as well). This default value is derived from the [ADDRESS_399333] slice thickness (but 
should not be changed with varying CT slice thickness).
[IP_ADDRESS] Target lesions that split or coalesce on treatment
•When non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the fragmented portions should 
be added together to calculate the target lesion sum. 
•As lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining 
maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced 
such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance 
should be the maximal longest di ameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’.
3.2 Evaluation of non-target lesions
While some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and 
instead should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points  specified in the protocol.
Immune-related Complete Response (irCR):  Disappearance of all non-target lesions. All lymph 
nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).
Immune-related Progressive Disease (irPD):  Incr eases in number or size of non-target lesion(s) 
does not constitute progressive disease unless/until Tumor Burden increases by 20% (ie the 
sum of the diameters at nadir of target lesions and any new measurable lesions increases by [CONTACT_323498]) 
Note: Non-target lesions are not considered in the definition of Stable Disease and Partial 
Response.

4 RESPONSE CRITERIA
4.1 Time point response
A response assessment should occur at each time point specified in the protocol.
•Immune-related Complete Response (irCR) : Complete disappearance of all tumor lesions 
(target and non-target), together with no new measurable or unmeasurable lesions, for at least 
[ADDRESS_399335] be 
< 10 mm.
•Immune-related Partial Response (irPR) : The sum of the diameters of all target lesions is 
measured and captured as the sum of diameters at baseline. At each subsequent tumor assessment, the sum of the diameters of all target lesions and of new measurable lesions are 
added together to provide the Immune Res ponse Sum of the Diameters (irSD). A decrease, 
relative to baseline of the irSD of 30% or greater is considered an irPR, in the absence of 
irCR. Must be confirmed no less than [ADDRESS_399336] irPR.
•Immune-related Stable Disease (irSD) : irSD is defined as the failure to meet criteria for 
immune complete response or immune partial response, in the absence of progressive 
disease.
•Immune-related Progressive Disease (irPD) : It is recommended in difficult cases 
(eg, increase in the sum of the diameters acco mpanied with significant individual lesion 
regression, “mixed response”, or in presence of stable or improving performance 
status/clinical condition) to confirm PD at the following tumor assessment. Any of the 
following will constitute progressive disease:
−At least 20% increase in the Sum of the Diameters of all target lesions over the nadir Sum 
of the Diameters calculated for these lesions.
−At least a 20% increase in the Sum of the Diameters of all target lesions and new 
measurable lesions over the nadir Sum of the Diameters calculated for the target lesions.

node must be ≥ [ADDRESS_399343] scan (CT scan slice thickness

will be measured and followed.

nodes with ≥10 to < 15 mm short axis), as well as truly non-measurable lesions.  
•Lesions considered truly non-measurable include:  leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or 
pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung,

bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance 
of bone lesions.

•Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components , that

•Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable.
1.3.2 Cystic lesions
•Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts s hould not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts. 
•‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cy stic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, 
if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-cystic lesions 
are present in the same subject, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.
1.3.3 Lesions with prior local treatment
Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other loco-regional 
therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion.  Measurable lesions may be in an irradiated field as long as there is documented 
progression and the lesion(s) can be reproducibly measured.
1.4 Specifications by [CONTACT_12009]
1.4.1 Measurement of lesions
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation (mm). All baseline evaluations should be 
performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 30 days before the beginning of the treatment.
1.4.2 Method of assessment
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow- up. Imaging based evaluation should 
always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].
[IP_ADDRESS] CT/MRI scan
CT/MRI is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure  lesions selected for 
response assessment. Measurability of lesions on CT/MRI scan is based on the assumption that 
CT/MRI slice thickness is [ADDRESS_399344] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, 
the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.
[IP_ADDRESS] Chest X-ray
Chest CT is preferred over chest X-ray, particularly when progression is an important endpoint, 
since CT is more sensitive than X-ray, particularly in identifying new lesions. However, lesions on chest X-ray may be considered measurable if  they are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_323500].

undertaken since it is more objective and may also be reviewed at the end of the study.

3.1 Evaluation of target lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.
Partial Response (P R):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking

taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest 
on study). In addition to the relative incr ease of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm . (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progression).Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor suff icient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.

faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm s hould be assigned in this

should not be changed with varying CT slice thickness).
[IP_ADDRESS] Target lesions that split or coalesce on treatment
•When non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the fragmented portions should

•As lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining 
maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced 
such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should 
be the maximal longest diameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’
3.2 Evaluation of non-target lesions
While some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and instead 
should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points specified in the protocol. 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions. All lymph nodes must be non-
pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).
Non-CR/Non-PD:  Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s).
Progressive Disease (PD):  Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. ( Note: the 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).
3.2.1 Special notes on assessment of non-target lesions
The concept of progression of non-target disease requires additional explanation as follows:
[IP_ADDRESS] When the subject also has measurable disease
•To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of the non-target disease, there must be an 
overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of SD 
or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy.
•A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more  non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to 
quality for unequivo cal progression status.
[IP_ADDRESS] When the subject has only non-measurable disease
•To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of the non-target disease, there must be an 
overall level of substantial worsening such that the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.
•A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more  non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to 
qualify for unequivocal progression status.
•Because worsening in non-target disease ca nnot be easily quantified (by [CONTACT_108]: if all 
lesions are non-measurable) a useful test that can be applied when assessing subjects for unequivocal progression is to consider if  the increase in overall disease burden based on the 
change in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would berequired to declare PD for measurable disease: i.e. an increase in tumor burden representing 
an additional 73% increase in ‘volume’ (which  is equivalent to a 20% increase di ameter in a

measurable lesion). Examples include an increase in  a pleural effusion from ‘trace’ to ‘large’, 
an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, or may be described in 
protocols as ‘sufficient to require a change in therapy’.
•If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, th e subject should be consider ed to have had overall PD 
at that point. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor markers
Tumor markers will not be used to assess objective tumor responses.
3.3 New lesions
The appearance of new malignant lesions deno tes disease progression. The finding of a new lesion 
should be unequivocal: i.e. not attr ibutable to differences in s canning technique, change in imaging 
modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ 
bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre-existing lesions). This is particularly important 
when the subject’s baseline lesions show partial or complete response. For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report  as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is not.
A lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical location that was notscanned at baseline 
is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. An example of this is the subjectwho has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain scan ordered which 
reveals metastases. The subject’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and follow-
up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there is 
definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.

4.1.1 Missing assessments and not evaluable designation
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular time point, the subject is not evaluable 
(NE) at that time point. If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an assessment, the 
case is also considered NE at that time point, unle ss a convincing argument can be made that the 
contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not have changed the assigned time point 
response.
4.1.2 Confirmation Scans
•Verification of Response: Confirmation of PR and CR is required within [ADDRESS_399351] Overall Response: all time points
The best overall response is determined once all the data for th e subject is known. It is the best 
response recorded from the start of the study treatment until the end of treatment taking into 
account any requirement for confirmation. The s ubject’s best overall re sponse assignment will 
depend on the findings of both target and non-targ et disease and will also take into consideration 
the appearance of new lesions.
Best response is defined as the best response across all time points with subsequent confirmation. 
Complete or partial responses may be claimed only if the criteria for each are met at a subsequent 
time point as specified in the protocol (generally 4 weeks later).
In this circumstance, the best overall response can be interpreted as specified in Table [ADDRESS_399352] meet the protocol specified minimum t ime from baseline.

a If a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen  at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR

response would depend on whether minimum duration for SD was met. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed 
when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the subject had PR, not CR at the first time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR.

BMS-[ADDRESS_399356] a failure rate of < 1% when used consistently 
and correctly. WOCBP and female partners of male subjects, who are WOCBP, are expected to 
use one of the highly effective methods of contraception listed below. Male subjects must inform their female partners who are WOCBP of the contraceptive requirements of the protocol and are
expected to adhere to using contraception with their partner.
At a minimum, subjects must agree to use one highly effective method of contraception as listed 
below:
For WOCBP
Highly effective methods of birth control include the following:
•Progestogen only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation
•Hormonal methods of contraception including oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]
•(combination of estrogen and progesterone), vaginal ring, injectables, or implants
•Intrauterine devices (IUDs) (hormonal or non- hormonal)
•Intrauterine Hormone-releasing System (IUS)
•Bilateral tubal ligation
•Vasectomy
•Complete abstinence (complete avoidance of heterosexual intercourse
For male subjects with partners that are WOCBP•Condom
All male subjects who have partners who are WOCBP must use condoms as their second method 
of contraception.
In countries where spermicide is not available or its use is not considered compatible with m ale 
condoms, use of a male condom without spermicide in conjunction with a hormonal method, 
IUD, or tubal ligation will be acceptable to fu lfill this reco mmendation.  Any barrier method 
when used alone (without spermicide) or th e concomitant use of a female and male condom, is 
not considered a sufficient method of contraception, as each carries a failure rate of >1%.
Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) receiving BMS-936558 (nivolumab) will be 
instructed to adhere to contraception for the duration of study tr eatment with nivolumab and 
[ADDRESS_399357] dose of study drug (ie, 30 days [duration of ovulatory cycle] plus the time 
required for the study drug to u ndergo approximately 5 half-lives). Men receiving nivolumab and 
who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for the duration of study treatment with nivolumab and [ADDRESS_399358] dose of study d rug 
(ie, 90 days [duration of sperm turnover] plus the time required for the study drug to undergo 
approximately 5 half-lives.)

Imaging Requirements  
 
• MRI scans abdomen/pelvis; To assess disease extension and to  
determine liver volume measurement and identify hepatic vascular anatomy.  
• Spi[INVESTIGATOR_281376] –performed with cuts of [ADDRESS_388106]. To assess extra ‐hepatic lesions according to the  
RECIST v 1.1.  
• Hepatic angiography and 99mTC ‐MAA – selective celiac and superior mesenteric  
arteriograms are needed to evaluate the hepatic arterial anatomy for the whole  
liver, as well as evaluation of potential sources of extra ‐hepatic blood supply to  
tumors. Repeat 99mTC ‐MAA may be needed to estimate cumulative lung shunt or  
re‐asses GI flow.  
• SPECT imaging m ay be performed according to standard of care practices for  
clinical management but is not a study requirement.  
• PET/CT for quantification  of dose to target lesion, as well as dose to non -target liver.  
 
Sample Size Calculation and Statistical Plan  
 
 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_315330], not amenable to thermal ablation.  
 
Current reported complete  response rates  of approximately 50% for BCLC A patients 
utilizing selective chemoembolization  have been promising. (31,32,33) Radiofrequency 
ablation has been reported to have >80% complete response for lesions < 3 cm. (30)  
 
Based on the assumption that a recent study r eporting radiation segmentectomy  rates 
similar to ablation, the goal is 80% complete response, compared to 50% complete 
response rate of TACE.

All patients will undergo  safety analysis  at the inter val study visits outlined below in the 
study visits section . All adverse events will be reported according to  the National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Cr iteria for Adverse Events v 4.03  (CTCAE). The 
incidence of adverse events will be summarized ac cording to the primary  system‐organ 
class and within the category defined in the CTCAE v 4.0 3. The summaries  will be 
overall (severity grades 1 ‐4) and for grade ≥3 events and will also report the  actions taken 
in terms of treatment discontinuation. Serious  adverse events (SAE) will  be tabulated by 
[CONTACT_3148]. Laboratory values will be summarized by [CONTACT_315345].

Treatment:  
 
Radiation segmentectomy protocol:  
 
a. MAA mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] :   
 Patients will undergo pretreatment angiography under transfemoral or 
transradial access with conebeam CT to:   
 
(1) determine  vascular  anatomy of the region  
(2) determine vascular supply of tumor  
(3) prophylactically embolize vessels that may lead to aberrant deposition of 
radioembolic microspheres  
The Impact of  90Yttrium (Y90) Radiation Segmentectomy  on Unresectable Hepatocellular 
Carcinoma  
 
-  - 6 (4) perform technetium -99 m macroaggregated albumin (99mTc -MAA) scans 
to determine lung sh unt fraction (LSF) and splanchnic shunting.  
(5) Patients will not be eligible for TheraSphere infusion if the potential 
radiation dose to  the lungs exceeds 30 Gy for a single treatment or cumulative 
50 Gy or embolization  cannot be performed to effectively  block GI blood flow 
from the hepatic arterial  system.  
 
 In all patients, the vessel feeding the segment(s) being targeted for treatment  
will be identified and catheterized using standard angiographic techniques and 
conebeam CT.  
 
b. Dosimetry:  
 Based on the pr etreatment angiography and conebeam CT, the volume of the 
perfused liver will be calculated on either the pretreatment CT or MRI, which 
will not be > 6 weeks from time of MAA mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007].   
 Assuming uniform distribution and complete 90Y decay in situ, radioact ivity 
required for desired dose delivery to the injected tissue can be calculated using 
the pretreatment dose -planning formula A = (D x M)/50, where A is the 
administered activity (activity of the vial that is to be infused) in 
gigabecquerels, D is the des ired treatment dose in grays, and M is the mass of 
the tissue perfused by [CONTACT_315346]. M is determined after 
converting the volume of that tissue to kilograms using the conversion factor 
of 1.03 x10-3kg/cm-3. 
 Target dose will be >205 Gy, assuming that is the threshold for tumor 
destruction (29).  
 After treatment, actual dose delivered to the tissue is determined after 
correcting for fraction of activity remaining in the vial (R) and LSF, using the 
formula for the posttreatment dose delivere d: D = 50 (A) (1 - LSF) (1 - R)/M.  
c.  Delivery of Y90 :  
 Radiation segmentectomy will be performed with Yttrium -90, whereby a high 
radiation dose is delivered to the tumor via radioactive microspheres infused 
through the hepatic artery. The radioactive mic rosphere delivery device used 
will be glass -based (TheraSphere; BTG, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada), in which 
90Y is an integral constituent of the biocompatible glass matrix.  
 Patients will be subsequently imaged the same day with PET-CT to calculate 
dose to ta rget tissue, as well as dose to the non -target liver.  This will be 
performed on a PET -CT system (Siemens).   
  
Patients who consent to the procedure, but cannot proceed with treatment due to dose 
resulting in >30 Gy to the lungs or inability to target fee ding vessels ≤ 2 Couinaud 
segments  will be regarded as treatment failures.

largely due to the hepatitis C epi[INVESTIGATOR_315332](1,2).  
 
For patients with single HCC and compensated liver disease (normal liver function and 
without  portal hypertension), partial liver rese ction (LR) is the preferred treatment. 
Unfortunately, only 5 -10% of these patients are resectable due to a variety of factors, 
which may include portal hypertension, total bilirubin > 1.0 mg/dL and platelets less than 
100,000/mm3.  For patients with HCC wh o are Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) 
Guidelines C lass A (1 lesion < 5cm, or 2-3 lesions all < 3cm) who are not candidates for 
LR, liver transplantation (LT) is the treatment of choice. The current median waiting time 
in [LOCATION_001], however, is greater than 12 months, creating the risk of dropout due to 
tumor progression (currently estimated to be around 20 -25%).  In order to mitigate this 
risk, patients listed for LT typi[INVESTIGATOR_315333]/or 
thermal ablation (TA) as a brid ge or downstage to LT (3,4).   
 
Patients with BCLC A HCC who due to age, medical, or psychosocial issues are not 
candidates for LR are typi[INVESTIGATOR_315334]. Thermal ablation is effective in lesions 
that can have precise placement of ablation probes and are accessible from a 
percutaneous approach. Local Time to Progression in patients, who have received TA has 
been demonstrated to be 10% at 3 years by [CONTACT_315347] f rom Lee at el. (36)  
However, some of these lesions have demonstrated incomplete ablation cavities on 
follow -up due to adjacent heat sinks .  Serious adverse events from thermal ablation, 
although small, have been well documented and associated with unfavora ble locations, 
such as adjacent to heart, bowel, gallbladder and diaphragm. As a result, some thermal 
ablations have resulted in abscesses, bowel perforation, hemothorax, cardiac tamponade, 
hematoma from superficial lesions near the liver capsule, gallblad der perforation, as well 
as seeding from the ablation tract. (37 -41) 
 
Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has demonstrated a survival benefit in BCLC 
B, or intermediate stage, patients.  Recent studies have also demonstrated an 
approximately 50% complet e response rate for single lesions, when sub -selective 
catheterization is utilized.  (31, 32, 33) However, tumors  treated with TACE have 
demonstrated viable components on explanted livers by [CONTACT_56618].   
 
Studies with transarterial radioembolization with Y ttrium 90 (Y90) have offered a 
potential benefit compared to TACE in BCLC B patients with a longer time to 
progression (TTP).  This may provide a benefit for patients awaiting transplantation.  
 
TheraSphere consists of insoluble glass microspheres in which yttrium‐[ADDRESS_388112] of  90Yttrium (Y90) Radiation Segmentectomy  on Unresectable Hepatocellular

-  - 9 73,000 microspheres per milligram.   TheraSphere is available in dose sizes ranging from 
3 GBq to 20 GBq, each supplied in 0.6 mL of sterile,  pyroge n‐free water contained in a 
1.0 mL vial secured within a clear acrylic vial shield. A pre ‐assembled  single‐use 
TheraSphere Administration Set is provided for each dose. Each user site is provided 
with a reuseable TheraSphere Administration Accessory Kit th at provides both radiation 
protection for the user and physical support of the dose vial and Administration Set 
during administration of the product.   Yttrium‐90 is a pure beta emitter which decays to 
stable zirconium ‐90 with a physical half ‐life of 64.1 h ours.  The average energy of the 
beta emissions from yttrium ‐90 is 0.9367 MeV with mean tissue penetration of 
approximately 2.5 mm.  
 
TheraSphere is administered through the hepatic artery which supplies blood to tumor 
tissue (the portal  vein supplies blood  to the normal hepatic tissue). The microspheres are 
trapped in the vasculature of the  tumor due to arteriolar capi[INVESTIGATOR_315335] a local radiotherapeutic effect. In clinical use,  the glass microspheres remain 
permanently trapped in the vasculature where the isotope decays to infinity leaving 
background radiation with no therapeutic value.  
 
Salem et al demonstrated the tolerability of TheraSphere in treatment of patients with 
HCC and branch  PVT and patients with unresectable HCC. Salem et  al recently 
published their long ‐term experience  of TheraSphere in the treatment of patients with 
HCC. In this report, patients with HCC (n=291) were  treated with TheraSphere as part of 
a single‐center, prospective, longitudinal cohort study. Toxicities w ere recorded using the 
Common Terminology Criteria version 3.0. Response rate and time to progression (TTP) 
were determined using World Health Organization (WHO) and European Association for 
the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines. Survival by [CONTACT_315348] a ssessed.  
 
Univariate/multivariate analyses were performed. A total of 526 treatments were 
administered (mean, 1.8; range, 1 ‐5). Toxicities included fatigue (57%), pain (23%), and 
nausea/vomiting (20%); 19% exhibited grade 3/4 bilirubin toxicity. The 30 ‐day mortality 
rate was 3%. Response rates were 42% and 57% based on WHO and EASL criteria, 
respectively. The overall TTP was 7.9 months (95% confidence interval, 6 ‐10.3). 
Survival times differed between patients with Child ‐Pugh A and B disease (A, 17.2 
month s; B, 7.7 months; P = .002). Patients with Child ‐Pugh B disease who had portal 
vein thrombosis (PVT) survived 5.6 months (95% confidence interval, 4.5 ‐6.7). Baseline 
age; gender; performance status; presence of portal hypertension; tumor distribution; 
levels of bilirubin, albumin, and alpha ‐fetoprotein; and WHO/EASL response rate 
predicted survival. These investigators concluded that patients with Child ‐Pugh A 
disease, with or without PVT, benefited most from treatment. Patients with Child ‐Pugh B 
disease wh o had PVT had poor outcomes. TTP and overall survival varied by [CONTACT_315349].

documents in Appendix 1, included death, hepatorenal failure, liver abscess, h epatic 
encephalopathy, hepatic decompensation, radiation hepatitis, radiation pneumonitis, 
duodenal ulcer, gastrointestinal bleeding and cholecystitis. These more severe events are 
now uncommon as patients with the high risk factors associated with the occ urrence of 
these events are typi[INVESTIGATOR_315336]. Patients in whom 
TheraSphere should be used with caution include those with infiltrative tumor type, bulk 
disease (tumor volume >70% or nodules too numerous to count), AST or A LT > five 
times the upper limit of normal, bilirubin > 2 mg/dL, tumor volume >50% in the presence 
of an albumin < 3 g/dL, and those in whom extra ‐hepatic shunting to the lungs or 
gastrointestinal tract cannot be managed through standard angiographic techni ques.  
 
More recently, the technique of radiation segmentectomy utilizing TheraSphere has been 
described by [CONTACT_315350]. with t reatment along an arterial anatomic plane confined to  2 
Couinaud  segments (>190Gy), resulting in complete pathological necrosis of targeted 
segments while limiting radiation exposure of non -targeted tissue.  
 
In a prospective study, eighty -four patients with hepatocellular carcinoma confirmed by 
[CONTACT_315351] e vidence as defined by [CONTACT_315352] (EASL) and American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) 
criteria were treated with TheraSphere utilizing a segmental approach (Riaz A, et al).   
The objective of the s tudy was to define radiation segmentectomy by [CONTACT_315353].   
 
The patient cohort was vastly male (58) with a median age of 68 years (range 43 -90 
years) and in good performance s tatus 0 (61) and 1 (25).  Hepatitis C virus (HCV) was 
the etiology of  their liver disease (34) and the majority of tumors were staged as T2 (32) 
and T3 (25) according to UNOS stage.  There was similarity among Barcelona Clinic 
Liver Cancer stage (A = 27; B = 25 and C = 31) and all patients were Child -Pugh A (41) 
and B (42) with the exception of one Child -Pugh class C patient.  All tumors were 
angiographically isolatable, specifically located in two or fewer Couinaud  segments that 
have the capability to be perfused at the intended catheter position.   
 
Each patient underwent pretreatment angiography and 99Tc-MAA injection for shunt 
detection.  Standard dosimetry was calculated based on catheterizing the lobar branch and 
exposing the lobe with a target of 120Gy.  Following treatment, the actual dose delivered 
was calculated by [CONTACT_315354] -unifor m microsphere distribution within the 
treatment volume.  All 84 patients received infusion at the level of the segmental artery.   
 
Response rate was determined utilizing the World Health Organization (WHO) and 
necrosis (EASL) guidelines and the time to pr ogression (TTP) and survival analyses are 
captured in Table 3.

It was demonstrated that a median segmental dose of 521 Gy assuming uniform 
microsphere distribution translated to a traditional lobar dose of 97 Gy which was further 
comparable to a whole liver dose of 35.5 Gy.  Furthermore, given the hypervascular 
nature  of HCC and assuming that hepatic arterial blood flow is preferentially directed to 
the tumor, the median dose estimated to be delivered to the tumor was even greater (1657 
Gy).   Thus, the high response rates presented in this study may be due to the high er 
radiation doses selectively delivered to the tumor.    
 
The most common clinical toxicities reported were fatigue (44), abdominal pain (15), and 
nausea/vomiting (11) and grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities reported were bilirubin (5) 
and albumin/alkaline  phosphatase (2).  Twenty -nine patients experienced no adverse 
reactions.  Both clinical toxicities and laboratory abnormalities following a segmental

A retrospective,  multi -center study was also conducted in which 102 treatment -naïve 
patients with unresectable HCC ≤5cm according to AASLD  (American Association for 
the Study of Liver Diseases)  guidelines and the absence of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) 
were treated with TheraSphere in a segmental fashion (Vouche M, et al).  The objective 
of the study was to assess the efficacy including response rates, overall survival, and 
pathologic analysis.   
 
Radiation segmentectomy is achieved by [CONTACT_315355] 120 -150Gy.  The activity vial(s) is then injected 
within the segmental feeding vessel which will minimize radiation to the normal 
parenchyma and increase safety to the patient.  As a result, segmental doses are higher 
than the prescribed dose by [CONTACT_315356].   
 
The amount of radioactivity required to deliver the desired dose to the liver may be 
calculated us ing the following formula:  
 
Activity Required (GBq) = [Desired Dose (Gy)] [Liver Mass (kg)]  
[ADDRESS_388115] has resulted in a radiation segmentectomy typi[INVESTIGATOR_315338] a 3,5,7, or 10 GBq vial, depending on the vascular capacitanc e of the 
segmental vessel (s).   
 
Demographic and baseline characteristics revealed 59 males and 43 females with a 
median age of 64 years (range 58 -75 years).   Although lesions were classified as small, 
forty percent of the patients were greater than an E COG performance status 0 (41/102) 
and 61 BCLC A and 41 BCLC C.  Additionally, two patients had a Child -Pugh C score 
>9.   The majority of lesions were not amendable to radiofrequency ablation due to 
location in the dome of the liver specific to segments 4,  7, and 8 and T2 (82 tumors) 
according to the UNOS stage.   The median size of the tumor was 2.6cm (range 2.1 -
3.6cm).   
 
Slightly greater than half of the patients experienced adverse reactions and none required 
admission.  The most common clinical toxicit ies according to the Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events v4 were fatigue (46), abdominal pain (10), nausea (8), fever 
(3), appetite loss (2), dyspnea (1), vomiting (1), and weight loss (1).   The first four

Median overall survival was 53.4 months with a median follow -up of 27.1 months .   
Upon exclusion of those patients transplanted, survival was 34.5 months.  For the  thirty -
three transplanted, the mean survival was 56.5 months.   
 
Of importance, 33/102 patients were transplanted in a mean time frame of 6.3 months and 
pathologic analysis revealed 17/33 patients had a complete pathologic necrosis and 16/33 
patients had a partial pathologic necrosis.   Complete necrosis was evident whe n the 
radiation dose exceeded 190Gy to the treatment area which was statistically significant 
(p=0.03).   Refer to Table 7 for pathologic and dose delivered correlation.

weighted imaging (DWI) and uptake by [CONTACT_315357] -specific contrast (Gd-EOB -
DTPA) are potentially complementary methods to assess hepatocyte damage.  The use of 
DWI  has been reported in the diagnosis of liver tumors and for the evaluation of 
treatment response in liver metastases (treated with systemic chemotherapy) and HC C 
(treated with TACE) (19 -25).  Diffusion  MRI  (or dMRI ) is a  magnetic resonance 
imaging  (MRI) method which came into existence in the mid -1980s.  It allows the 
mappi[INVESTIGATOR_315339], mainly water, in  biological tissues,  in 
vivo and non-invasively. Molecular diffusion in tissues is not free, but reflects 
interactions with many obstacles, such as  macromolecules, fibers,membranes, etc. Water 
molecule diffusion patterns can therefore reveal microscopic details about tissue 
architecture, either normal or in a diseased state.  In diffusion weighted imaging  (DWI), 
the intensity of each image element (voxel) reflects the best estimate of the rate of water 
diffusion at that location. Because the mobility of water is driven by [CONTACT_315358], the hypothesis behind DWI is that 
findings may indicate (early) pathologic change.   The apparent diffusion coefficient  
(ADC)  measures the magnitude of diffusion (of water molecules) within tissue.  Most 
studies have observed an early rise in ADC values concomitant with devascularization, 
with subsequent decrease in ADC values in HCC (19).   The extent of tissue cellularity 
and the presence of intact cell membrane help determine the impedance of water 
molecule  diffusion.  This impedance of water molecules diffusion can be quantitatively 
assessed using the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value.  This assessment can be 
done using different  b values  via changing gradient amplitude.   
            
We propose to te st the following hypothesis : 
 
Radiation segmentectomy wi ll provide a high response rate  in patients that qualify for 
radiofrequency ablation as per the BCLC guidelines, but are deemed ineligible.  
  
STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 
The goal of this proposal is to assess the efficacy of radiation segmentectomy in patients 
with very early and early HCC as per BCLC, who cannot undergo thermal ablation.   
Towards this goal, we will also explore 1) Time to Progression  2) Quantifying dose to 
target lesion  3) Safety and 4) Toxi city.

Radiation segmentectomy protocol:  
 
c. MAA mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] :   
 Patients will undergo pretreatment angiography under transfemoral or 
transradial access with conebeam CT to:   
 
(1) determine  vascular anatomy of the region  (≤ 2 Couinaud Segments)  
(2) determine vascular supply of tumor  
(3) prophylactically embolize vessels that may lead to aberrant deposition of 
radioembolic microspheres  
(4) perform technetium -99 m macroaggregated albumin (99mTc -MAA) scans 
to determine lung shunt fraction (LSF) and splanchnic shunting.  
 
 In all pat ients, the vessel feeding the segment(s) being targeted for treatment  
will be identified and catheterized using standard angiographic techniques and 
conebeam CT.  
 
d. Dosimetry:  
 Based on the pretreatment angiography and conebeam CT, the volume of the 
perfused liver will be calculated on either the pretreatment CT or MRI, which 
will not be > 6 weeks from time of MAA mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007].   
 Assuming uniform distribution and complete 90Y decay in  situ, radioactivity 
required for desired dose delivery to the injected tissue can be calculated using 
the pretreatment dose -planning formula : 
 A = (D x M)/50,  
where A is the administered activity (activity of the vial that is to be infused) 
in gigabecque rels,  
D is the desired treatment dose in grays,

Carcinoma  
 
-  - 20 and M is the mass of the tissue perfused by [CONTACT_315346]. M 
is determined after converting the volume of that tissue to kilograms using the 
conversion factor of 1.03 x10-3kg/cm-3. 
 Target do se will be >205 Gy, assuming that is the threshold for tumor 
destruction  based on the referenced paper from Garin et al, which 
demonstrated response to Y90 at target doses > 205 Gy  (29).  
 After treatment, actual dose delivered to the tissue is determined after 
correcting for fraction of activity remaining in the vial (R) and LSF, using the 
formula for the posttreatment dose delivered: D = 50 (A) (1 - LSF) (1 - R)/M.  
c.  Delivery of Y90 :  
 Radiation segmentectomy will be performed with Yttrium -90, whereby a high 
radiation dose is delivered to the tumor via radioactive microspheres infused 
through the hepatic artery. The radioactive microsphere delivery device used 
will be glass -based (TheraSphere; BTG, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada), in which 
90Y is an integral con stituent of the biocompatible glass matrix.  
 Patients will be subsequently imaged the same day with PET-CT to quantify  
dose to target tissue, as well as dose to the non -target liver.  This will be 
performed on a PET-CT system (Siemens ).

Data from this trial will be captured on case reporting forms (CRFs). An audit trail will 
be maintained to document all data changes in the database.  
Procedures will be followed to ensure the validity and accuracy of the clinical database.  
The investigato r will sign and date all indicated places on the CRFs. This signature [CONTACT_315363].  
 
DATA MANAGEMENT  
 
The investigator will ensure that trial data quality is maintained to current standards of 
Good Clinical  Practice and that data are submitted in a timely manner as outlined in the 
protocol and supporting  documentation. The investigator must sign an affirma tion 
statement verifying the content of all subjects' CRFs. Errors must be corrected in 
accordance with EDC data entry guidelines.

DEFINITIONS OF AE/SAE FOR DRUGS  
Adverse Device Effect (ADE)  
An adverse device effect is an adverse event (AE – previously defined) related to a 
medical device and  includes any event resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in 
the instructions for use or the  deploym ent, implantation, installation or malfunction of the 
The Impact of  90Yttrium (Y90) Radiation Segmentectomy  on Unresectable Hepatocellular

-  - 22 device; any event that is the result of user  error; or any potential adverse device effect 
which might have occurred if suitable action had not been  taken or intervention had not 
been made or if circums tances had been less fortunate.  
Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE)  
A Serious Adverse Device Effect is an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of 
the consequences  characteristic of a serious adverse event (SAE – previously defined) or 
might have  led to any of these  consequences if suitable action had not been taken; 
intervention had not been made or circumstances had been less fortunate.   This is 
classified as Grade [ADDRESS_388129] udy will be discontinued.  
 
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Event (UADE)  
An unanticipated adverse device effect is any serious adverse effect which by [CONTACT_5942], 
incidence, severity and outcome has not been identified in the risk assessment, the 
informed con sent form as well as the protocol.  
 
RECORDING ADVERSE EVENTS  
In this study, patients should be encouraged to report adverse events spontaneously or in 
response to  general, non ‐directed questions. At any time during the study, the patient may 
volunteer info rmation that  resembles an adverse event. Once it is determined that an 
adverse event has occurred, the Investigator  should obtain all the information required to 
complete the adverse event form. Any medical management  of an event and the date of 
resolution  of the event must be recorded in the source docum ent and on the  
appropriate case reports form(s).  
 
For each AE, the following information will be recorded:  
• Adverse event  
• Serious/non ‐Serious  
• Severity (Toxicity Grade)  
• Action taken  
• Relationship to study treatment  
• Expected/Unexpected  
• Date and time of onset  
• Date and time of resolution  
 
An expected adverse event is any AE, the nature or severity of which is identified in the 
relevant Package  Insert.  Any AE experienced by a subject will be follow ed until the AE 
has resolved to the investigator's or physician sub ‐investigator's satisfaction. If a problem 
still exists, then the investigator or physician sub ‐investigator at his/her discretion will 
ask the subject to come back to the clinic for furthe r evaluation. Any serious adverse 
events should be managed as discussed.  
Once the subject has been discharged from the study, the investigator has no obligation to 
seek further  follow‐up with the subject in order to identify new AEs. AEs ongoing at 
study e xit will be followed to  resolution. However, if the investigator becomes aware of 
an SAE that has occurred following the subject's discharge from the study and the 
The Impact of  90Yttrium (Y90) Radiation Segmentectomy  on Unresectable Hepatocellular 
Carcinoma  
 
-  - 23 investigator considers the SAE possibly, probably, or definitely related to a study drug or 
device, then the investigator should report the SAE as described in the protocol.  
 
CA[LOCATION_003]LITY (RELATIONSHIP TO MEDICAL DEVICE) ASSESSMENT  
The investigator or physician sub ‐investigator must indicate whether he/she believes the 
AE is not related,  unlikely related, possibly related (reasonable possibility that the 
medical device caused the AE), probably  related, or definitely related to the medical 
device.  An adverse event becomes an adverse device effect when the adverse event is 
considered associated with  the use of the test device if the attribution is Possibly, 
Probably or Definitely Related.  
 
PERIODIC SAFETY REPORTING  
Adverse events will be recorded on the AE form and coded using NCI CTCAE v 4.0 3. 
The investigator or  physician sub ‐investigator will judg e the severity of each AE and 
whether or not it is treatment ‐related. All  AEs that occur after the initiation of trial 
treatment, including events likely to be related to the underlying  disease or likely to 
represent concurrent illness, will be reported, i ncluding events present at Baseline which 
worsened during the trial.

STUDY MONITORING  
The study will be monitored by [CONTACT_5944], [CONTACT_315364], MD .  
During the course of the trial, a study monitor or other authorized representatives of the 
sponsor will  conduct remote monitoring and visit the investigator at suitable intervals. 
The purpose of these visits will  be to verify adherence to the protocol, ensure  correct 
completion of the CRFs.  In order to perform his  role effectively, the st udy monitor must 
be given access to source  documentation (eg, clinic charts, original laboratory recor ds), 
which support data on the CRF, and  informed consent forms. The monitor must be able 
to verify data appearing in the CRFs against data in  the subject' s clinic chart (eg, chart 
notes) or in printout forms (eg, laboratory results).  
 
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 
Sample size / Power Calculations  
 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_315341], not amenable to thermal ablation.  
 
Current reported complete  response rates  of approximately 50% for BCLC A patients 
utilizing selective chemoembolization  have  been promising . (31,32 ,33) Radiofrequency 
ablation has been reported to have >80% complete response for lesions < 3 cm.  (30) 
 
Based on the assumption that a recent study reporting radiation segmentectomy  rates 
similar to ablation , the goal is 80% complete  response , compared to 50% complete  
response rate of TACE .

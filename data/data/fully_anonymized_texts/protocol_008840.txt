113. SYNOPSIS
This is a brief summary .  For details, refer to the body  of the protocol.
Protocol Number: 109MS414
Protocol Title: A Multicenter, Double -Blind, Placebo
-Controlled Study  of 
Montelukast on Gastrointe stinal Tolerability  in Patients With 
Relapsing Forms of Multiple Sclerosis Receiving 
TECFIDERA®(Dimeth yl Fumarate) Delay ed-Release 
Capsules
Version Number: 3
Name [CONTACT_204922] y Treatment: TECFIDERA®(dimethy l fumarate )
Study  Indication: Relapsing forms of m ultiple sclerosis (MS)
Phase of Development: 4
Rationale for the Study : Two large Phase 3 studies (Study  109MS301 [DEFINE] and
Study  109MS302 [CONFIRM] )and1 Phase 2 study  
(Study C
-1900) of dimethy l fumarate (DMF) in patients with 
relapsing -remitting MSdemonstrated substantial benefits 
over placebo across a range of clinical and radiologic 
measures of disease activity .  While the overall safety  profile 
was favorable in these studies, the incidence of adverse 
events ( AEs)associated with gastrointestinal (GI)
tolerability , including diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, 
vomiting, and d yspepsia, was increased in DMF -treated 
patients compared with those who received placebo.
This study  will investigate the impact of [ADDRESS_864649] 
once dail yon GI tolerabili ty in patients with relapsing forms 
of MS receiving DMF delay ed-released capsules in order to 
potentially  increase patient compliance and adherence to 
treatment and ultimatel y maximize the therapeutic potential 
of DMF.
Study  Objectives and 
Endpoints:Obje ctives
Primary :
The primary  objective of this study  is to evaluate whether 
montelukast can reduce the severit y of GI events, measured 
by [CONTACT_645836] ( GSRS) , after

14Subjects will be requir ed to be ≥75% compliant in the 
14days prior to randomization to remain eligible to 
participate in the stud y.  Subjects will also use the eDiary  to 
record DMF dosing, randomized study medication dosing , 
and an y symptomatic concomitant medications/procedure s.  
Subsequently , eligible subjects will initia teDMF therap y and 
record GI -related events in the eDiary for up to 28days
(DMF -GI Monitoring Period) .  During this period, subjects 
will take DMF ,andGSRS scores will be monitored .  
Subjects who reach a spe cific threshold (GSRS score of ≥3 
in 1 question for 1 day  or a GSRS score of ≥2in 1 question 
for 2 consecutive day s) will receive an alert through the ir
eDiary  to start taking randomized study  treatment the same 
day, in accordance with the prescribing and labeling 
inform ation.  Subjects who do not meet the threshold by [CONTACT_189539] 28 dayswill be discontinued from the study .  
Eligible subjects , who reach the GSRS score threshold and 
initiate randomized study  treatment (m ontelukast or 
placebo), will return to the study  site at Weeks  0, 2, 4, 8 ,
and at Week 10for evaluation by  [CONTACT_289154] (visits at 
Weeks 2and 8 can alternatively  be performed remotely  by a 
contracted home health nurse ). Weeks  2, 4, and [ADDRESS_864650] a

window of ± 3 days. The Safety  Follow -Up Telephon e 
Interview will be conducted 2 weeks (±5 days) after the 
Week 10 study  visit or date of the E arly Termination Visit.
Subjects who withdraw from the study  after initiating 
randomized study  treatment will not be replaced.
The dose of DMF used will be as described in the United 
States Prescribing Information (USPI ).  Subjects will take 
DMF for up to 14 weeks and the randomized study treatment
(montelukast or placebo) , concomitantly ,for [ADDRESS_864652] pertinent information regarding GI -related events in 
an eDiary .
Information on AEs and serious adverse events ( SAEs )will 
be collected for possible correlation with GI -related events.  
For the purposes of this study , relapses of MS will not be 
consider ed AEs, and data related to relapses will only  be 
captured if they  are deemed an SAE or result in a subject’s 
discontinuation.   Relapses of MS resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_645827] 109MS414                                                                                                                                           Version 3

265. INTRODUCTION
5.1. Profile of Previous Experience
5.1.1. Nonclinical Experience With Dimethyl Fumarate
In nonclinical studies, DMF and its primary  metabolite, monomethy l fumarate (MM F), were 
found to promote stabilization, nuclear translocation, and transcriptional activity  of nuclear 
factor (ery throid -derived 2) -
related factor 2 (Nrf2) as well as expression of Nrf2 target genes in 
cultured human cells and in vivo [ Linker 2011] .  Previous ex vivo and in vivo studies have 
demonstrated a central role of the Nrf2 pathway  in protection of cells and tissues against 
oxidative, metabolic, and inflammatory  stress.  Loss of Nrf2 function via genetic silencing has 
been shown to cause exaggerated inflammatory response and lead to development of sy stemic 
autoimmunity  and central nervous sy stem (CNS) alt erations, including widespread gliosis and 
white matter lesions. Conversel y, pharmacological agents known to activate Nrf2 have been 
shown in nonclinical studies to exert anti- inflammatory  effects, protect neurons from oxidative 
and excitotoxic stress- induced death, and improve the blood -brain barrier integrit y of the CNS.  
Activation of the Nrf2 pathway  by [CONTACT_254126]®(DMF ) gastro -resistant hard capsules (hereinafter 
referred to as DMF) in multiple sclerosis (MS) may contribute to inhibition of inflammatio n and 
help support CNS integrity  by [CONTACT_645837].
5.1.2. Clinical Experience With Dimethyl Fumarate
Clinical Pharmacokinetic Studies
In single -dose and short -term multiple -dose studies in healthy volunteers and subjects with M S, 
DMF was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_2478] y converted to its major metabolite (MMF) upon oral administration.  Exposure 
(maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve) was generally dose proportional 
across the dose range (120 to 360 mg) and dosing frequencies ( twice dailyand 3 times daily ) 
studied.  No accumulation of exposure was detected with repeated dosing due to rapid 
elimination of the drug.  In these studies, DMF was most frequentl y associated with flushing; no 
serious adverse events (SAEs) or deaths in healthy vol unteers who received DMF were reported.
Clinical Efficacy and Safety in Multiple Sclerosis
The DMF clinical development program at the time the DMF marketing authorization 
applications were filed included 6 clinical studies in subjects with MS.  I n 4 of th e studies 
(Phase 2 and 3 placebo -controlled efficacy  and safety  studies and their uncontrolled extensions), 
2513 subjects with relapsing -remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS )received DMF and were 
followed for periods up to 6years, with an overall exposure of 6133 patient -years. 
Approximately  1056 subjects received >2years of treatment with DMF.
Study  C-1900 was a Phase 2, randomized, multicenter, placebo -controlled, double -blind, 
parallel -group, dose -ranging study  composed of 2 parts: a 24-week double -blind, 
placebo- controlled safet y and efficacy phase (Part 1) followed b y a 24 -week dose -blinded, safety  
extension phase (Part 2).  The primary  efficacy  endpoint was the total number of new gadolinium

27(Gd) -enhancing lesions at Weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24 (calcul ated as the sum of the 4 magnetic 
resonance imaging [MRI] scans).  A total of 257 subjects were randoml y assigned to receive 
120mg DMF once daily , 120 mg DMF 3 times daily , or 240 mg DMF 3 times daily .  Subjects 
treated with 240 mg DMF 3 times daily had a 69% reduction in the mean number of new 
Gd-enhancing lesions versus placebo as measured on monthly  MRI from Weeks 12 to 24 of the 
study , and a 48% and 53% reduction in new or enlarging T2 h yperintense lesions and new 
nonenhancing T1 h ypointense lesions at Week [ADDRESS_864663] of DMF versus 
placebo on measures of relapse and disabilit y progression, as well as MRI disease activity.  Each 
study  was a randomized, double -blind, and placebo- controlled study  in which subjects were 
treated for 2 years.
In Stud y 109MS301 (DEFINE), 1237 subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 
240mg DMF twice daily , 240 mg 
DMF 3 times daily , or matching placebo.  The primary  
endpoint was the proportion of subjects relapsed at 2 y ears.  Dimethy l fumarate twice daily and 
3
times daily  reduced the risk of relapse at 2 years by 49% (p <0.0001) and 50% (p <0.0001), 
respectivel y.  A significant reduction in the risk of 12-week confirmed progression was 
observed.  In this stud y, the estimated proportion of placebo -treated subjects with 12 -week 
confirmed progression at 2 y ears was 0.271 compared with 0.164 for twice daily and 0.177 for 
3times daily (38% reduction for twice daily and 34% reduction for 3 times daily relative to 
placebo; p =0.0050 and p =0.0128, respectivel y).  Dimethy l fumarate twice daily  and 3 times 
daily  reduced the number of new or newl y enlarging T2 h yperintense lesions that developed over 
2 years by  85% and 74%, respectivel y, compared with placebo (p <0.0001 for both 
comparisons).  Dimeth yl fumarate twice dail y and 3 times daily  reduced the odds of having 
greater Gd
-enhancing lesion activity  at 2 yearsby 90% and 73%, respectively , compared with 
placeb o (p< 0.0001 for both comparisons).  The most common adverse events ([ AEs];incidence 
≥5%) that occurred at an incidence ≥3% higher in the total DMF group than the placebo group 
included flushing and hot flush, GI-related events (diarrhea, nausea, abdomin al pain upper, 
abdominal pain, and d yspepsia), skin events (pruritus, rash, and ery thema), proteinuria, alanine 
aminotransferase/serum glutamate -pyruvate transaminase increased ,and albumin urine present.
In Stud y 109MS302 (CONFIRM), 1430 subjects were ran domized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 240 mg 
DMF twice daily , 240 mg DMF 3 times daily , DMF -matching placebo, or 20 mg glatiramer 
acetate subcutaneous injection once dail y.  The primary  endpoint was the annualized relapse rate 
at 2years.  Treatment with DMF 240 m g administered twice dail yand 3 times daily reduced the 
annualized relapse rate at 2 years b y 44% and 50.5%, respectively, compared with placebo 
(p< 0.0001 for both comparisons).  Compared with placebo, treatment with 240 mg DMF twice 
daily and 3 times d ailysignificantly  reduced the number of new or enlarging T2 h yperintense 
lesions that developed over 2 years b y 71% and 73%, respectively (p <0.0001 for both 
comparisons).  Treatment with DMF twice dail yand 3 times daily  significantly  reduced the 
number of new T1 hy pointense nonenhancing lesions that developed over 2 y ears by  57% and 
65%, respectively , compared with placebo (p <
0.0001 for both comparisons).  Treatment with 
DMF twice daily and [ADDRESS_864664] s who relapsed 
at 2years b y 34% (p =0.0020) and 45% (p <0.0001), respectively , compared with placebo.

28of subjects with 12 -week confirmed progression at 2 y ears was 16.9% for placebo, 12.8% for 
twice dail y, and 13% for 3 times daily  (21% reduction for twice dail y and 24% reduction for 
3times daily  relative to placebo; p =0.2536 and p =0.2041, respectivel y).  The most common 
AEs (incidence ≥5% in the total DMF group) that occurred at an incidence ≥3% higher in the 
total DMF group than in the placebo group included flushing and hot flush, GI-related events 
(diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain upper, abdominal pain, and vomiting), upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_37193], and skin events (pruritus, rash, and ery thema).  Additional information on DMF is 
provided in the Full Prescribing Information.
5.2. Study Rationale
Two large Phase [ADDRESS_864665] s with RRMS demonstrated 
substantial benefits ov er placebo across a range of clinical and radiologic measures of disease 
activity  (Phase 3 Study  109MS301 [DEFI NE], Phase 3 Study  109MS302 [CONFIRM], and 
Phase 2 Study  C-1900).  While the overall safet y profile was favorable in these studies, the 
incidence of AEs associated with GI tolerability , including diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, 
vomiting, and d yspepsia, was increased in DMF -treated subject s compared with those who 
received placebo.  Between 27% and 38% of all DMF-treated subject s in the [ADDRESS_864666] 3 months of treatment, and whereas 11% to 16% of 
subject s used GI-related sy mptomatic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], it was unclear whether these were taken in 
response to a GI -related AE that occurred in conjunction with dosing or if th e therap y was 
effective.  The incidence of these events was higher during the first month of treatment and 
decreased in the second and subsequent months of treatment.  The majorit y of subject s reported 
these AEs to be of mild to moderate severit y.  Neverth eless, stud y discontinuations due to GI 
events were increased in DMF -treated subject s (≤5%) compared with placebo -treated subject s 
(≤2%, pooled Phase 2 and Phase 3 subjects ).  In addition, a recentl y completed single -arm, 
open -label , Phase 4 Study (109MS403 [MANAGE]) as well as a placebo -controlled study  of 
Pepto -Bismol®(bismuth subsalicy late) on GI tolerability  (Study  109HV110 [PREVENT]) 
showed similar results in terms of time course, severity ,and incidence of GI events.  
Histopathology  from biopsies taken from a subset of subjects in PREVENT suggested some 
evidence of GI mucosal eosinophi l infiltration . Inan independent ,open -label, 30 -daystudy
(21subject s)investigating the effect of montelukast in DMF -related GI s ymptoms , GI symptoms
were significantly  attenuated in the majority  of subject s; GSRS scores decreased on average b y 
81% wi thin 72 hours [Tornatore and Amjad 2014 ] . The effect of montelukast may  suggest that 
the pathogenesis of the GI s ymptoms with DMF could be due to a local immunomodulatory
effect of DMF. Montelukast is an approved product for asthma with a well -established safet y 
profile [[SINGULAIR® USPI  2014 ]].If a larger randomized ,controlled study  could 
demonstrate a benefit on decreasing the known GI tolerability  events during initiation of therap y, 
it would be a clear benefit for subjects choosing DMF to treat MS who experience GI side 
effects.
This study  will investigate the impact of [ADDRESS_864667] once dail y on GItolerability in 
patients with relapsing forms of MS receiving DMF delay ed-released capsules in order to 
potentially  increase patient comp liance and adherence to treatment and ultimately  maximize the 
therapeutic potential of DMF.

295.3. Rationale for Dose and Schedule Selection
Dimethy l fumarate will be taken in accordance with the [LOCATION_002] (US) Prescribing 
Information ( USPI ). The starting do se for DMF is [ADDRESS_864668] label : one 10- mg tablet once dail yin the evening.  
Protocol 109MS414                                                                                                                                         Version [ADDRESS_864669] on GI tolerability  with relapsing 
forms of MS treated with DMF at approximately  50study  sites in the US.  It is expected that
approximately  295 subjects will be initial ly randomized to obtain approximately  118 subjects 
dosed with randomized study  treatment ( 59 subjects dosed with randomized study  treatment per 
treatment arm).  Not all randomized subjects will be eligible to be dosed with randomized study  
treatment .  Rand
omized subjects will be required to reach a predefined threshold of GI sy mptom 
severit y before dosing with randomized study  treatment will be initiated.   Subjects who withdraw 
from the study  after initiating randomized study  treatment will not be replaced.
Subjects will enter a 2 -week (+ 14days) Screening Period and record per tinent information 
regarding GI -related events to allow characterization of background GI-related events using the 
eDiary .
Subjects will be required to be ≥75% compliant in the 14 days prior to randomization to 
remain eligible to participate in the study .  Subsequently , eligible s ubjects will initially  take 
DMF ([ADDRESS_864670] week, 240 mg twice daily orally  thereafter) for up 
to 28days
(DMF -GI Monitoring Period) and record GI -related events in the eDiary . During this 
period, subjects will take DMF, GSRS scores will be monitored, and subjects who reach a 
specific threshold will receive an alert throug h the eDiary  to start taking randomized study  
treatment (10mg once daily montelukast or placebo) the same day in accordance with the 
prescribing and labeling information .  Subjects who do not meet the threshold or do not 
demonstrate ≥75% compliance with the eDiary in the [ADDRESS_864671] DMF dosing, randomized study
medication dosing , and any  symptomatic concomitant medications
/procedures.  Elig ible subjects 
willreturn to the study  site at Weeks 0, 2, 4, [ADDRESS_864672] a visit window of ±[ADDRESS_864673] a visit window of 
± [ADDRESS_864674]
, visits at Weeks 2, and 8 may  be performed remotely  
by a contracted home health nurse .  The Safet y Follow -Up Telephone Inter view will be 
conducted 2 weeks (±5 days) after the 
Week 10 study  visit or date of the Early Termination (ET)
Visit.
The dose of DMF used will be as described in the USPI .  Subj ects will take DMF for up to 
14weeks , including 8 weeks with the concomitant randomized study  treatment (montelukast or 
placebo) ,and will record pertinent information regarding GI -related events in an eDiary .
Information on AEs and SAEs will be collected for possible correlation with GI -related events.  
For the purposes of this study , relapses of MS will not be considered AEs, and data related to 
relapses will be captured only ifthe event is deemed an SAE (seeSection 15.1.2 )or result sin a 
subject’s discontinuation.
  Relapses of MS resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_645830]. H owever, they  will not be reported as SAEs in the study  unless the 
relapse is complicated b y othe r SAEs or is fatal.

337.2. Overall Study Duration and Follow -Up
The study  period consists of a 2-week (+ 14days) Screening Period, up to a total of 14 weeks of 
DMF therap y(including DMF -GI Monitoring Period and r andomized treatment administration
period), including 8 weeks of concomitant randomized study  treatment (DMF +montelukast or 
DMF + placebo) , and theSafety  Follow -Up Telephone I nterview .  The duration of a subject’s
participation will be up to [ADDRESS_864675] eligibility  for the study  will be determin ed at the Screening Visit after receipt of the 
signed and dated informed consent form (ICF).  Eligible s
ubjects will be given an eDiary  after 
training on how to use the device.
7.2.2. Screening Period
During this 2-week (+14 days) period, subjects will record pertinent information regarding 
GI-related events every  day in the eDiary .  Individuals with a GSRS score of ≥5in 1question for 
1 day , a GSRS score of ≥4 in 1question for 2 consecutive day s, or a GSRS score of ≥3 in 
1question for 3 consecutive day s during the S
creening Period will be discontinued and counted 
as screen failures.  
7.2.3. Randomization Visit
Subjects will return to the study  site for a recheck of eligibility  criteria (only GSRS scores and 
concomitant medications /procedures will be checked) .  Individuals with GSRS score of ≥5in 
1question for 1 day , a GSRS score of ≥4in 1 question for 2 consecutive da ys, or a GSRS score 
of ≥3in 1question for 3 consecutive day s during the Screening P eriod will be discontinued and 
counted as screen fail ures.  Su bjects will be required to be ≥75% compliant in the 14 day s prior 
to randomization to remain eligible to part icipate in the study , and sites should continue to 
monitor eDiary  compliance throughout the study .  Concomitant medications/procedures will be 
checked to ensure compliance with stud y restrictions.  Once eligibility has been rechecked and it 
is confirmed th at a subject is eligible to continue on the study , blood samples will be collected 
for the assessment of clinical laboratory  parameters and serum biomarkers (optional) .  Eligible 
subjects will be randomized and provided with blinded randomized study  treatm ent (montelukast 
or placebo) at this time.
Eligible subjects will receive commercial DMF through their specialt y pharmacy or, in the case 
of insufficient insurance coverage, through the Biogen Patient Services Free Drug Program, for 
up to [ADDRESS_864676] meets the threshold of a GSRS score of ≥3 in 1 question for 1 day ora GSRS score of ≥[ADDRESS_864677] will receive an alert through his/her eDiary  to 
begin taking the randomized study treatment the same day .  An y subject who do esnot reach the 
GSRS threshold during the DMF -GI Monitoring Period will be discontinued.
7.2.5. Treatment
Eligible subjects will take DMF for up to 14 weeks (from the 
start of the DMF -GI Monitoring 
Period to Week 10) andblinded randomized study  treatment (either montelukast or placebo )for
8weeks (from Week s0 to 8) .
Subjects will be asked to return to the study  site at Weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, and 10 /ETfor blood 
sampling for assessment of clinical laboratory  parameters and AEs (optional serum biomarker
samples will be drawn at Weeks 4
or10/ET) .  Visits at Weeks 0, 4, and 10/ET must be 
performed at the stud y site.  If more convenient for the subject ,visits at Weeks 2 and 8 may  be 
performed remotel y by a contracted home health nurse; in this situation, an appropriatel y 
qualified person from the stu dy site must call the subject on each occasion to document any  
concomitant medication/procedures and AEs. Study  windows are ±2 day s for the Weeks  2, 4, 
and 8 
Visits and ±3 day s for the Week 10/ET Visit . S tudy site should arrange the Week [ADDRESS_864678]-Treatment
Two weeks (±5 days) after the Week 10 Visit or date of the ET Visit, subjects will be 
interviewed b y telephone as a safety follow -up (collection of information on an y AEs, SAEs ,or 
changes in concomitant medications /procedures) .

10.1.1. Dimethyl Fumarate
Subject s will receive a supply  of commercial DMF through their specialty  pharmacy  or, in the 
case of insufficient insurance coverage, through the Biogen Patient Services Free Drug Program.
Dimethy l fumarate should be administered according to the prevailing product label (i.e., USPI).  
Dimethy l fumarate will be administered orally  as [ADDRESS_864686] 
label (i.e., USPI) should be used as a guideline.  Dose modifications should be captured in the 
case report form ( CRF ).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Treatment Precautions
Refer to the Package Insert for the treatment precautions.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Treatment Adherence
Compliance with dosi ng will be monitored and recorded b y stud y site staff.  Subjects are to 
return all unused DMF and used and unused packaging at each visit.  Study  site staff will be 
responsible for recording study  treatment accountability  and treatment compliance informati on 
based on the unused study  treatment returned by  [CONTACT_645839].
10.1.2. Montelukast and Placebo
[IP_ADDRESS]. Administration
Montelukast (10mg once daily in the evening) should be administered according to the 
prevailing product label (Singulair®).  Randomized treatments (montelukast or placebo) will be 
administered only until Week [ADDRESS_864687] does not remember to take a dose within 8 hours of the scheduled time (i.e., at least 
4 hours before the next scheduled dose), the dose should be skipped, a nd the next dose should be 
taken as scheduled.  Doses should not be doubled- up, or a missed dose taken the next day ,to 
make up for missed doses.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Treatment Precautions
Refer to the Package Insert for treatment precautions [SINGULAIR® USPI 2014].
[IP_ADDRESS]. Treatment Adherence
Compliance with dosing will be monitored and recorded b y stud y site staff.  Subjects are to

will be responsible for recording stud y treatment accountability  and treatment compliance 
information based on the unused study  treatment returned by  [CONTACT_645839].
10.2. Continuation of Treatment
Dimethy l fumarate and montelukast are
approved treatments in the US , and continuing treatment 
following completion of the study requirements will be left to the discretion of the subject and 
Investigator .
10.3. Concomitant Therapy and Procedures
A concomitant therap y is any drug or substance administered between the time the subject is 
enrolled in the study  and the Safet y Follow -Up Telephone Interview/ ET Visit.
Apart from the treatments listed below a nd those listed in the exclusion criteria ( see Section 1), 
the use of concomitant medications is left to the discretion of t he Investigator.  The prevailing 
product label should be used as a guideline.
A concomitant procedure is any  therapeutic intervention (e.g., surgery /biopsy  and ph ysical 
therap y) or diagnostic assessment (e.g., blood gas measurement and bacterial cultures) performed 
between the time the subject is enrolled in the study  and the Safet y Follow -Up Telephone 
Interview/ET Visit.

4514. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS
14.1. Clinical Safety Assessments
The following clinical assessments will be performed at multiple timepoints between the 
Screening Visit and Week 12/ET Visit :
AEs
SAEs
Refer to Section 4.[ADDRESS_864691] a causal relationship 
with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporall y associated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product.
15.1.2. Serious Adverse Event
AnSAE is any  untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose:
results in death
in the view of the Investigator, places the subject at immediate risk of death (a 
life-threatening event); however, this does not include an event that, had it occurred 
in a more severe form, might have caused death
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity , or
results in a congenital anomaly /birth defect.
An SAE may  also be any other medicall y important event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], 
may jeopardize the subject or m ay require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes 
listed in the definition above.  (Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency  room or convulsions occurring at home that do not 
require an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].)
15.2. Monitoring and Recording Events
15.2.1. Adverse Events
Any non-S AE(including flushing) experienced b y the subject between the time of first dose of 
study  treatment and the Safet y Follow -
up Telephone Interview is to be recorded on the CRF, 
regardless of the severity of the event or its relationship to study  treatment.
There are 2 exceptions to this:
Protocol 109MS414                                                                                                                                         Version 3

47Any GI-related AE experienced by  [CONTACT_645840] y completion is to be recorde d by [CONTACT_645841]/her eDiary .  Any GI 
AEs that lead to permanent study  discontinuation or withdrawal or are serious must 
be recorded.
Non-SAEs of MS relapse will not be collected unless leading to permanent treatment 
discontinuation or study  withdrawal.
Nons erious GI AEs should be recorded in the eDiary  and not in the eCRF.
For subjects who permanently  discontinue DMF during the study , AEs should be recorded 
through the Safet y Follow -Up Telephone Interview conducted 2 weeks (±5 day s) after the 
subjects’ F inalClinic Visit.
15.2.2. Serious Adverse Events
Any SAE experienced by [CONTACT_645842] -Up Interview is to be recorded on an SAE Form, regardless of the severit y of the 
event or its relationship to study  treatment.  For subjects who permanently  discontinue DMF 
during the stud y, SAEs should be report ed through the Safet y Follow -Up Telephone Interview
after the 
subjects’ F inal Clinic Visit.  All SAEs must be reported to .
Any SAE on going when the subject completes the study  or withdraws from the study  will be 
followed b y the Investigator until the event has resolved, stabilized, or returned to baseline 
status.
15.2.3. All Events
All events must be assessed to determine the following:
If the event meets the criteria for an SAE as defined in Section 15.1.2.
The relationship of the event to study  treatment as defined in Section 15.3.1 .
The severit y of the event as defined in Section 15.3.[ADDRESS_864692] 
formally  notify   within 24 hours of the study  site staff becoming aware 
of the SAE.  It is the Investigator’s responsibility  to ensure that the SAE reporting information 
and procedures are used and followed appropriately .

reason for the intervention or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].
15.5. Procedures for Handling Special Situations
15.5.1. Overdose
An overdose is an y dose of study treatment given to a subject or taken by  a subject that exceeds 
the dose described in the protocol.  Overdoses are not considered AEs ; however, all overdoses 
should be recorded on an Overdose Form and faxed to within 
24hours.  An overdose should be reported even if it does not result in an AE.  Overdoses do not 
need to be recorded in the CRF ; dosing information is recorded on a CRF.
15.5.2. Medical Emergency
In a medical emergency  requiring immediate attention, study  site staff will apply  appropriate 
medical intervention, according to current standards of care.  The Investigator or designee should 
contact [CONTACT_645843] (found in the Study 
Reference Manual) or the  [ADDRESS_864694] Center at  or

requirements when initially  determining suitability and desire to prescribe.
15.5.4. Pregnancy
The Investigator should refer to the approved local label for guidance if female subjects become 
pregnant during the study.
At the Screening Visit and the Randomization Visit , female subjects of childbearing potential 
should be asked about their pregnancy  status and possible pregnancies/spontaneous abortions 
since the last visit or contact.  Spontaneous abortions are considere d to be SAEs and must be 
reported as such.  
The Investigator should report the pregnancy  to  
(using the Pregnancy Form provided) within [ADDRESS_864696] as an SAE to .
15.5.5. Regulatory Reporting
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are SAEs that are unexpected and 
judged b y the Investigator or the Sponsor to be rel ated to the study  treatment administered.
Appropriate personnel in Biogen Safety  and Benefit -Risk Management (or designee) will 
unblind S[LOCATION_003]Rs for the purpose of regulatory  reporting.  Biogen will submit S[LOCATION_003]Rs (in 
blinded or unblinded fashion) to Regulato ry Agencies according to local law.  Biogen will 
submit S[LOCATION_003]Rs to I nvestigators in a blinded fashion.
15.5.6. Unblinding for Medical Emergencies
In this stud y, emergency decoding will be made available to the Investigator and desig nated 
personnel at Biogen and the contract research organization through an IXRS
.
In a medical emergency  when knowledge of the subject’s treatment assignment may  possibl y 
influence the subject’s clinical care, the Investigator may  access the subject’s tre atment 
assignment b y IXRS.  Howeve r, prior to unblinding, the Investigator should attempt to contact 
[CONTACT_645843] (found in the Study Reference 
Manual) to discuss the emergency .  It is of note that the  Mediacal Advisor cannot 
provide approval for unblinding.
The Investigator must document the reasons for unblinding in the subject’s source documents.  
The Investigator is strongl y advised not to divulge the subject’s treatment assignment to an y 
individual not directly  involved in managing the medical emergency , nor to personnel involved 
with the anal ysis and conduct of the study .
15.6. Investigator Responsibilities
The Investigator’s responsibilities include the following:
Monitor and record all AEs, including SAEs, regardless of the sev erity or relationship 
to study  treatment.
Determine the seriousness, relationship, and severity  of each event.
Determine the onset and resolution dates of each event.
Monitor and record all pregnancies and follow
-up on the outcome of the pregnancy .
Complet e an SAE F orm for each serious event and fax it to 
within 24 hours of the study  site staff becoming aware of the event.

6  1 INTRODUCTION  
This statistical analysis plan (SAP) reflects detailed statistical me thods to be used for 
studying Montelukast on Gastrointestinal Tolerability in patients with Relapsing Forms of 
Multiple Sclerosis receiving  Tecfidera® (Dimethyl Fumarate) Delayed -Release Capsules. 
The SAP is based on the final version of protocol 109MS414 (Version 3) dated [ADDRESS_864706] can reduce the 
severity of gastrointestinal (GI) events, measured by [CONTACT_645849] (GSRS), after oral administration of Dimethyl Fumarate  (DMF) in subjects with 
relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis ( MS). 
The primary endpoint of this study is the proportion of subjects with a worsening in the 
severity of GI adverse events ( AEs), measured by [CONTACT_645850] [ADDRESS_864707] dose when the GI threshold was reached . Day 10 is 
defined as 10 days after Day 0.   
 
2.2 Secondary Objectives and Endpoints  
The s econdary objectives in this study population are: 
• To evaluate whether Montelukast after oral administration of DMF in subjects 
with relapsing forms of MS: 
− decreases discontinuations due to GI events  
− reduces the number of subjects taking symptomatic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_645834] 
• To investigate the effect of Montelukast on the incidence of flushing events 
after oral administration of 240  mg DMF in subjects with relapsing forms of 
MS 
The secondary endpoints are: 
• Average change of G I severity scores from Day  [ADDRESS_864708] 10 days (Day 1 to Day 
10), divided by [CONTACT_645851]  
• Average change of GI severity scores from Day  [ADDRESS_864709] 10 weeks (Day 1 to Week 10), divided by [CONTACT_645851]

3.1 Definition of the GSRS  threshold  
Two definitions of the GSRS  threshold were used in this study.  
Definition in the version 1 of the protocol: GSRS score of ≥5 in one question for 1 day or 
a GSRS score of ≥4  in one question for 2 consecutive days or GSRS score of ≥3 in one 
question for 3 consecutive days.  
Definition in the 2nd and higher Protocol versions :  GSRS score of ≥3 in one question for 
1 day or a GSRS score of ≥2 in one question for 2 consecutive days.  
 
3.2 Overall Study Duration and Follow- Up 
The study period consists of a 2- week (+14  days) Screening Period, up to a total of 14 
weeks of DMF therapy (including DMF-GI Monitoring Period and randomized treatment 
administration period), including 8 weeks of concomitant randomized study treatment (DM F + M ontelukast or DMF  + placebo), and the Safety Follow-Up Telephone 
Interview.  The duration of a subject’s participation will be up to 18  weeks.  Subjects who 
discontinue the study early will complete the same assessments specified for the Week 10 Visit.

6 SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION  
Assuming that 40% of the placebo subjects will be improving (by [CONTACT_3364]) without any 
intervention, a total sample size of 118 (dosed with randomized study treatment), 59 per treatment arm (after randomization), would provide approxim ately 80% power to detect a 
30% difference between the treatment arm and placebo arm in proportion of subjects with any improvement in GI severity, as measured by [CONTACT_645850] 0 in GSRS score to Day 10. Power was estimated assuming a 15% ear ly discontinuation rate.

deviation (SD) , median, 25
th and 75th percentile (Q1, Q3), minimum and maximum.  For 
categorical endpoints, the summary statistics will generally include:  number of patients 
randomized and dosed, th e number of patients with data, and the number and percent of 
subjects with data in each category.  
All statistical tests will be 2 -sided with a type I error rate of 5%, unless otherwise 
specified.

The t otal number of days on study treatment  (Montelukast or p lacebo) will be 
summarized  for the modified ITT population. The number of days on study treatment is 
calculated as the number of days from the date of the first dose of the study treatment 
(Montelukast or Placebo) to the date of the last dose of study treatment, plus 1. 
In addition, the number of doses of study treatment taken between Day 0 and Day 10 will 
be summarized  for the modified ITT population. 
Study treatment compliance rate will also be summarized in the modified ITT population.  
Study treatment compliance rate will be defined as the total number of study treatment doses taken divided by [CONTACT_645852]. Study treatment compliance will be summarized in each of the following periods: 
• From D ay 0 to Day 10 
• From Day [ADDRESS_864719] dose of DMF, plus 1.   In addition, the number of doses of DMF taken between Day 0 and Day 10 will be summarized  for the modified ITT population. 
 The DMF compliance rate will also be summarized.  The DMF compliance rate will be 
defined as the total number of DMF doses taken divided by [CONTACT_645853]. DMF compliance will be summarized in the modified ITT population in each of the following periods:

Data on concomitant medications treating for non-GI symptom s are collected in the CRF.  
Number and percentage of patients taking concomitant medication will be summarized.  
 
7.3 Efficacy Analysis  
7.3.1 Analysis Population 
The primary analysis population will be the modified intent- to-treat (modified ITT) 
population defined in 7.1.1. 
 
7.3.2 GSRS score 
GSRS  is an interview -based rating scale consisting of 15 items for assessment of GI 
symptoms. Items are scored for intensity o n a 7- grade  Likert scale, defined by [CONTACT_645855] 0 = none, 1 = minor, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = moderately severe, 5 = 
severe, and 6 = very severe discomfort. The overall GSRS score is the mean of these 15 
items, varying from 0 to 6; a score of [ADDRESS_864722] possible degree of all symptoms.  In addition, these 15 
items can be grouped into 5 dimensions: abdominal pain syndrome (3 items, abdominal 
pain, hunger pain and nausea), reflux syndrome (2 items, heartburn and acid regurgitation),  indigestion syndrome (4 items, abdominal distension, increased flatulence, 
borborygmus and eructation), diarrhea syndrome (3 items, loose stools, diarrhea and urgency of defecation) and constipation syndrome ([ADDRESS_864723] stools and 
 
18  feeling of incomplete evacuation). A dimension score is calculated as the mean of the 
items belonging to the specific syndrome. The primary  analysis will be based on the 
overall GSRS score and sensitivity analysis will be based on the 5 dimension score as appropriate.  
7.3.3 Analysis Methods -Primary endpoints  
 
Proportion of subjects with a worsening  in the severity of GI AEs, measured by [CONTACT_645856] 0 to Day 10 in GSRS score  
 
The a verage change of the GSRS score from Day 0  (baseline ) to Day [ADDRESS_864724] 10 days  
divided by [CONTACT_645851]. A positive average change of 
GSRS score from Day 0 to Day 10 means a patient has an overall worsened GI severity. A negative average change of GSRS score from Day 0 to Day 10 means an overall 
improved GI severity.   The proportion of subjects with worsening will be summarized by [CONTACT_645857] a weighted logistic regression model adjusted  for age, weight and baseline 
GSRS score  as cont inuous variables. Each patient included in this model will be assigned 
a weight defined as the proportion of days with GSRS score recorded. The weight is used 
to account for the missing data when patients do not report the GSRS score. The odds 
ratio (OR) for the Montelukast treatment group compared to placebo will be reported.  
The corresponding P-value from the likelihood ratio test of the null hypothesis that the OR = 1 will be given. Profile likelihood 95% profile likelihood confidence interval (CI s) 
will be given for the odds ratio.                                                                       
 SAS procedure “genmod” or SAS procedure “logistic” will be used to perform the 
primary analysis. Below is the example of SAS procedure genmod: 
 
proc genmod data=ds1 descending;*assuming ds1 is the name [CONTACT_645880]; 
  model worsec = trtpn weight age gsrsb/dist=bin link=logit lrci; 
  weight pdays; 
  lsmeans trtpn / pdiff cl; 
  contrast "difference between treatments" trtpn -1 1; 
run;  
 
Depending on the GSRS , study treatment and/or the DMF compliance, sensitivity 
analysis may be performed among patients with a compliance rate from Day [ADDRESS_864725] 10 days (Day 1 to Day 10), divided 
by [CONTACT_645858] 
 
 
19  Average change of GI severity scores from Day 0 (baseline) to Day [ADDRESS_864726] 10 days divided by [CONTACT_645859].  The a verage change will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_645860] (ANCOVA) model adjusted for 
age, weight and baseline GSRS score. To adjust for missing data, a weight defined as the proportion of days with GSRS score recorded will be assigned to each subject. The 
difference of  the average GSRS score between the two treatment arms will be tested . 
 Normality assumption of the ANCOVA will be tested. If violated, a rank based 
ANCOVA will  be used .  
 
A sensitivity  analys is using a mixed -effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) for 
the change of the GSRS score from baseline will be conducted. The model will be  
adjust ed for age, weight and baseline GSRS score as continuous variables, and will have 
unstructured variance- covariance structure. The primary test based on  the model will be 
the test of the null hypothesis of no difference between the two treatment groups in the 
average change from Day 0 ( baseline ) between  Day [ADDRESS_864727] ory plot of the 
change in GSRS score  with 95% CIs, by [CONTACT_645861], estimated from the 
model , will be presented. Trajectory plot of the mean  change in GSRS score by [CONTACT_645862].   
 Depending on the GSRS, study treatment and/or DMF compliance, sensitivity analysis may be performed using MMRM in  patients with a compliance rate from Day [ADDRESS_864728] 10  weeks (Day 1 to Week 10) 
divided by [CONTACT_645863] 0 (baseline) to Week  [ADDRESS_864729] 10 weeks divided by [CONTACT_645851]. Th is endpoint will be analyzed 
by [CONTACT_645864]. Sensitivity analyses using 
ANCOVA model for the average change may be performed. Trajectory plots of mean  
change and the model based estimated mean change from baseline in GSRS score  (with 
95% CIs),  by [CONTACT_645861], will be presented.  
 
 
Time to first worsening of GSRS in GI severity  
 
The GI severity is worsen ed if the GSRS score increases from baseline ( Day 0 ). Time to 
first worsening of GSRS in GI severity is defined as the number of days from Day [ADDRESS_864730] date with a worsened GSRS score . If a patient  does not experience any worsening 
from Day 0 to Day 10, his/her time to first worsening will b e censored at Day 10 or the 
day of study treatment (Montelukast/PBO)  discontinuation, whichever comes first.  
 Time to the first worsening of GSRS by [CONTACT_3148] a rm will be  analyzed using the Kaplan -
Meier  method  and the Cox’s  proportional hazards model adjusted for age, weight and 
 
[ADDRESS_864731] score is Day 0 and time t o recovery is 1. If a patient  experiences a 
worsening of GSRS score but does n ot experience a recovery before Week  8, his/her time 
to recovery  will b e censored at Week  8 or the day  of study treatment  (Montelukast/PBO) 
discontinuation or the day of switchin g to other GI medication s listed in I/E criterion [ADDRESS_864732] score will be  
analyzed using the Kaplan- Meier method  and the Cox’s proportional hazards model. 
  
Average chang e of GSRS score from Day 0 to Week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 
 Average change of GSRS score from baseline ( Day 0 ) to Week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 will 
be summarized; a repeated measures model for the change of the GSRS score from baseline, adjusted  for age, weight and baseline GSRS score, will be used to estimate 
effect at each time point . Sensitivity analyses using ANCOVA model for the average 
change may be performed. 
Average change of GSRS score from Day 0 to 72 hours from the initiation of 
random ized study treatment  
 Average change of GSRS score from baseline (Day 0)  to 72 hours (Day 3) from the 
initiation of randomized study treatment will be summarized and  analyzed by [CONTACT_645865] . No sensitivity analysis will be performed.

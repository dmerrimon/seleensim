2.2  SPECIFIC  AIMS:  Sleep -Disordered Breathing and CPAP after Adenotonsillectomy in Children     
 Obstructive sleep -disordered breathing (SDB)  affects at least  2-3% of children and may have substantial 
adverse impact on behavior and cognition.  Adenotonsillectomy  (AT), the second most common surgical 
procedure  in children , is now performed more often  for suspected SDB than for any other indication.  However, 
recent studies among an increasingly obese population now show something alarming: many if not most 
childre n still have SDB after AT, and many still suffer from residual neurobehavioral morbidity.   Furthermore, 
the investigators’ ongoing, [ADDRESS_52477] pressure (CPAP)  could still provide 
definitive relief from SDB.  Preliminary data from our group suggest that CPAP after AT is well -tolerated by 
[CONTACT_50176].  However, virtually no published evidence exists  to address 
critical  clinical questions:  which children benefit most from CPAP after AT; what role can clinical symptoms or 
polysomnography play in that determination; and what neurobehavioral gains are achieved by [CONTACT_50177]?  
  
The investigators  there fore propose a highly practical, clinical study with two main goals: (1) to assess the 
extent that behavior, cognition, and sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_50115], and (2) to 
identify which patients stand to gain most from post -operative assessment and treatment.   This 
research will use reversible  SDB- related neurobehavioral morbidity as the criteria by [CONTACT_50178].  Neurobehavioral 
outcomes will be assessed with instruments shown to be sensitive to SDB in the past.  Clinical sleep 
symptoms will be assessed by [CONTACT_2363] a pediatric SDB questionnaire developed and validated by [CONTACT_50179].  Standard polysomn ography will be supplemented by [CONTACT_50180].  Subjects will be 5-[ADDRESS_52478] had AT in recent months for suspected SDB.  To enroll a reasonable distribution of children wi th and 
without obvious SDB symptoms after AT, the sample will be enriched selectively if necessary.  All analyses will 
be adjusted for body mass index z- scores.  These novel investigations will come at a critical juncture and could 
well transform clinical care for an exceedingly common and consequential childhood condition.  
 Aim 1:  Complete parental sleep questionnaires, sleep laboratory -based nocturnal polysomnograms, Multiple 
Sleep Latency Tests of daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], parental behavioral ratings, and neuropsychological tests for 
n=120 children 4 months after AT for clinically suspected or laboratory -confirmed SDB.  
H1a:  After AT, an SDB symptom scale will help id entify children who have residual SDB on polysomnography.  
H1b:  After AT, residual problems with behavior, cognition, and sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_50116] . 
Impact :   Results will show t hat after AT, a symptom -based questionnaire can help identify children likely to 
have residual SDB, which in turn  is a risk factor for persistent neurobehavioral morbidity.   Clinicians and 
families will have, for the first time, data that can guide evaluat ion after an exceedingly common surgery.  
  
Aim 2:  Randomize Aim [ADDRESS_52479] clinical care (control group, n=40) vs.  
CPAP titration (CPAP group, n=80),  home use of CPAP, and monitored adherence; and then re-assess all 
subject s with all baseline sleep and neurobehavioral tests . 
H2a:  Among CPAP subjects who have adhered to the therapy , residual questionnaire or polysomnographic 
evidence of SDB from [ADDRESS_52480] -AT in hyperactive behavior , attenti on deficit, and sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] . 
H2b:  Among all CPAP subjects (n=80), n eurobehavioral outcomes will improve more, from baseline to follow -
up, among subjects who adhere successfully to CPAP than among those w ho do not. 
H2c:  Among all subjects (n=1 20), neurobehavioral outcomes will improve more among CPAP subjects than 
control subjects in an intent -to-treat analysis.  
 
Impact :  Results will demonstrate the clinical utility of an SDB questionnaire and polysomnogr aphy after AT; 
implicate post- AT residual SDB as a potential cause of persistent neurobehavioral problems; and suggest that 
successful treatment of post -AT SDB provide s tangible clinical benefits.  
 
 
2.3  RESEARCH STRATEGY  
 A.  SIGNIFICANCE 
 
A1.  Pediatric sleep -disordered breathing (SDB)  is common and consequential, especially for behavior and 
cognition .  A growing volume of literature suggests that obstructive sleep apnea  affects 2 -3% of children.[ADDRESS_52481] many more of the estimated  10% of children who have habitual snoring.  Sleep -
disordered breathing represents a serious public health challenge  as most affected children probably remain 
undiagnosed .[ADDRESS_52482] reports on children with SDB 
noted that many presented with inattention, hyperactivity, a ggressive behavior , or a history of diagnosed and 
treated Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder  (ADHD) .7,8  Subsequent sizable surveys, by [CONTACT_50181], generally showed consistent associations between symptoms of childhood 
SDB and the same constellation of neurobehavioral pro blems.9-13  Brai n, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampal 
mechanisms implicated as possible causes of neurobehavioral morbidity in SDB involve vulnerability to  sleep 
fragmentation,14,15 intermittent hypox ia,16 oxidative stress,17 inflammation,18 neuronal injury,19 and apoptosis .20 
 A2.  Adenotonsillectomy (AT)  improves, but may not eliminate SDB and its neurobehavioral morbidity .  Once 
identified, pediatric SDB is most often treated by [CONTACT_50182].  This is one of the two  most common surgeries performed 
in children.[ADDRESS_52483] common indication for ATs performed during a one -
year period in approximately 24,000 children .22  Moreover, e arly data suggested that AT was curative in 
approximately 80% of cases.23  Other studies also suggested that substantial neurobehavioral improvements 
could be achieved in operated children.2,7,24,25  However, recent data are more concerning.  Sizeable  series 
now show that 50% or more of children who undergo AT have some degree of  residual SDB after the 
procedure.26-[ADDRESS_52484] that the  reason may well be the obesity epi[INVESTIGATOR_901].  Among 
69 children,  the odds ratio  for persistent SDB in obese vs. non-obese subjects was about 4, even after 
adjustment for initial apnea severity .29  Moreover, data from the investigators now confirm  that not all 
neurobehavioral  morbidity resolves after surgery.  In a study of 78 children aged 5 – [ADDRESS_52485] years has centered on 
sleep specialists’ contention that polysomnography should be routine prior to AT, vs. the opi[INVESTIGATOR_50117], who rarely ob tain a polysomnogram prior to AT for suspected SDB.22  Instead, common 
practice among otolaryngologists, as supported by [CONTACT_50183], is to base a decision to operate 
on information that can be gleaned from a history and physical.  Some support for this approach was provided 
when a  commonly used pediatric symptom -based SDB scale ( developed and validated by [CONTACT_473],43 
see appendix ) was tested against polysomnography as a predictor for neurobehavioral outcomes among 
children undergoing AT.[ADDRESS_52486] 
polysomnographic measures, appear to benefit from AT.24,45  However, AT (like uvulopalatopharyngoplasty in 
adults) may in some cases reduce or hide symptoms without eliminating SDB, and p ediatric sleep specialists 
have now begun to won der whether polysomnography may be even more important after AT than before the 
procedure.   Testing in a sleep laboratory i s routinely recommended after surgery  for SDB in adults.[ADDRESS_52487] operative polysomnographic SDB findings merit further treatment has complicated 
not only clinical decisions, but research as well.  For example, in a recent study of children  after AT , residual 
SDB was defined – in the absence of data linking postoperative polysomnographic results to clinical outcomes  
– as an apnea / hypopnea index ( AHI) > 3, even though the same study used the more generally 
recommended4 AHI > [ADDRESS_52488] pressure (CPAP) is the mainstay of treatment and in the investigators ’ experience works well for 
approximately 80% of patients.  Although some studies of adherence report success rates a t this level, others  
that have used electronic monitoring have shown that as few as half of adult patients treated with CPAP use the machine for at least [ADDRESS_52489] 5 nights per week.
48  Although far from ideal, a 50%  adherence rate 
is no worse than that observed among adults with  chronic conditions such as hypertension, and no worse than 
the average medication adherence found among children.49 
 
Two 1995 reports of sizeable samples found  that CPAP is highly effective  in controlling childhood SDB,  and is 
well tolerated  in more than 80% of  patients .50,[ADDRESS_52490] pressure (BPAP) found that one third of 29 participants  aged 2 – 16 years  dropped out by 6 
months ; CPAP and BPAP showed no difference in adherence or  effectiveness ; and mean nightly use recorded 
electronically was adequate on average (5.3 ± 2.5 hours per night) in subjects who finished the protocol.[ADDRESS_52491] as subjective CPAP use 
among adults exceeds electronically monitored use.48  In a retrospective study of 46 children aged 7 – 19 
years, all treated with PAP after AT, the intervention again controlled SDB well (in all subjects); 70% of 
subjects used PAP for more than 4 hours on 5 or more nights per week; parents overall estimated adherence 
well, though they overestimated machine use for those children documented to us e it 4 hours or less per night; 
and adherence did not vary significantly by [CONTACT_654], gender, BMI, or race.53  In another retrospective study, 65 of 
79 children aged 6 months to 18 years successfully used PAP, with a mean daily use of 4.7 hour s.54  The 
commitment and investment of the parents is particularly important.  Initial trials of low pressure settings or 
behavioral intervention  may be necessary in some cases.55,56  Behavioral therapy can include positive 
reinforcement, differential positive reinforcement, counterconditioning, and graduated exposure .55  These 
improve d adherence in 75% of 20 non-compliant children  in one study ; parents usually consider ed the 
treatment successful and most report ed improvements in children’s mood, alertness, and learning.55 
 
These trials of PAP in children also show  that the therapy is safe.  Mid -face hypoplasia, a reported but 
 
probably uncommon complication of long -term PAP in young children,57 did not occur in a trial of PAP for 6 
months in 2 – 16 year -old children.52  Other s ide effects are minor, and can include initial difficulty with masks, 
nasal congestion or drying, or skin irritation, one or more of which were reported in 11 of 46 subjects in one 
study.53  In another  study, side effects were minor, affe cted “a small percentage of children,” were “easily 
addressed,” and did not diminish adherence.[ADDRESS_52492] reported whether the CPAP improves SDB- related morbidity .  In 
particular, virtually no data are available to examine whether CPAP further improves neurobehavioral outcomes after AT.  Among 29 subjects  aged 2 - 16 years  in one  prospective  PAP trial, intervention was not 
associated with improve d daytime behavior  (according to parents) , school performance, growth, or blood 
pressure, but was associated with improved  parental assessments of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008].
52  In a retrospective study of 
46 children aged 7 – 19 years, parent -reported sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_50118], and 
hyperactive behavior nearl y showed significant improvement (p=0. 053).[ADDRESS_52493] did document 
improvement in several different cognitive and behavioral spheres when CPAP was administered to 21 
children  aged 6 – [ADDRESS_52494] neurobehavioral 
response to CPAP.  In an era when obesity r ates continue to rise unchecked;  AT is increasingly performed for 
suspected SDB rather than pharyngitis;  residual SDB may affect more  than half of operated children;  and 
unexplained hyperactivity  is a hugely common and vexing problem for many families, data on the potential for 
neurobehavioral improvement when any SDB persists after AT would seem particularly critical.  
 A6.  How candidates for CPAP after AT should be identified remains unexplored.   While  optimal strategies to 
identify childhood SDB that requires AT are still studied and debated, indications for  additional  treatment afte r 
AT have received virtually no attention.  Among unoperated children, SDB is often defined in the setting of 
appropriate symptoms by [CONTACT_50184] [ADDRESS_52495] unique data from which they can begin to make judgments about the meaning  of residual 
clinical symptoms after AT; the potential role for a validated SDB symptom questionnaire; the indications for 
post-operative polysomnography; how to select good candidates for CPAP after AT; and what neurobehavioral 
benefits to expect from CPAP .  The most widely used pediatric SDB questionnaire and standard pediatric 
polysomnographic measures  will provide the main explanatory variables for the study, but new and highly 
sensitive laboratory methods developed by [CONTACT_50185] a paradigm that could 
motivate refinement in current approaches to evalu ation of children in sleep laboratories.  Beyond clinical 
practice questions, results will also advance our understanding that post -AT, residual SDB may still be 
responsible for persistent neurobehavioral problems, and that definitive treatment of residual  SDB could 
ameliorate behavior, cognitive impairment, and sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_50119].   
These data could identify key variables, determine effect sizes, and provide invaluable  ground work to justify a 
multicenter randomize d clinical trial to prove that neurobehavioral morbidity results from post -AT residual SDB, 
and to establish clear evidence -based recommendations for evaluation and treatment of SDB in this setting.  
 
B.  INNOVATION  
 
The morbidity  of postoperative , residual  SDB, and outcomes of its treatment  in children have scarcely been  
studied .  The post-AT predictive value of clinical, questionnaire, and obje ctive polysomnographic measures 
have not  been assessed .  The proposed research will  therefore address several critical clinical questions for 
the first time .  It will  be performed by [CONTACT_50186], in a setting proven to be most  
productive, using state -of-the-art polysomnography  and widely accepted, standard measures  that the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_50120] .62,63  However , the proposed research  also will capi[INVESTIGATOR_50121] ’ leading efforts, during the past decade, to improve  the clinical utility of pediatric 
polysomnography through innovative electronic analyses of polysomnographic data normally scored only by [CONTACT_50187].   As described below, the investigators will apply 1) computer algorithms that link increased 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_21266], outside apneas and hypopneas, to subtle EEG changes that may represent inspi[INVESTIGATOR_50122]; 2) automated quantification of esophageal pressure monitoring results; and 3) analysis of sleep 
dynamics that focus on durations  of specific sleep stage bo uts rather than more crude but traditional totals of 
minutes  spent in each sleep stage.   Each of these approaches holds promise , as explained below,  for 
increasing the sensitivity and value of polysomnography in discrimination of clinically meaningful chil dhood 
SDB from normal and less consequential results.   In short, therefore, the innovation of the proposed research 
rests on two sources:  the protocol will begin to ask common, clinically relevant questions that have not been 
addressed before, and will complement standard assessment approaches with highly sensitive, new 
techniques that the investigators have invent ed, developed, validated, or  investigated for several years.  
 
C.  APPROACH  
 
C1.  Overview .  We propose a single -center, randomized  and controlled but not blinded  clinical  trial to assess 
what variables  predict further response to CPAP  after AT  (Figure 1) .  Potential i nclusion of any child, 
regardless of post- operative polysomnographic  results at [ADDRESS_52496] been proposed by [CONTACT_50188] .  The  protocol will 
allow for examp le assessment of the possibility that clinical symptoms as detected on a questionnaire, but too 
insensitive to register on  polysomnography, still deserve treatment.44,45  Every  child who participates in this 
protocol will stand a chance to benefit.  Two -thirds will receive CPAP; no standard care will be denied; and at 
the end of the study, summaries of sleep and neurobehavioral findings will be made available to all families, 
along with guidance on how to obtain follow -up clinical care for any remaining concerns.  
 
C2.  Subjects .  Recruitment will be directed by [CONTACT_3252]- investigator Susan Garetz, MD, a University of Michigan 
pediatric otolaryngologist, with the assistance of [ADDRESS_52497] energetically 
supported recruitment for the PI’s sleep research on children undergoing AT for the past [ADDRESS_52498] referral to the  study during phone contacts 
with the surgeon’s office which will then fax the referral form to the study team .  Children may also be referred 
into the program by [CONTACT_50189], other providers, or their staff  at UMHS and SJMHS  sleep disorders 
centers  and surgeons or their staff at Allegiance Health System .   In some cases, interested parents may 
contact [CONTACT_50190].  To increase awareness of the study 
opportunity and encourage study participation, a copy of the IRB -approved study brochure and a reference to 
the study will be included with the UM Pediatric Otolaryngology follow -up letter which is sent to patients after 
adenotonsillectomy. Brochures are also available in all of the pediatric otolaryngology and sleep disorders 
clinics.  Brochures may be mailed to families interested in research whose children are being referred into 
pediatric otolaryngology for possible adenotonsillectomy.  At UMHS identification  and recruitment  of potentially 
eligible children will be assisted by [CONTACT_50191].  
 If the parent and eligible child are still interested, the parent will sign a full, written informed consent, the child will assent verbally, and any child over the age of 8 or able to comprehend the basic nature of the study will 
sign written assent.  Families will also provide basic medical history and background information through a 
systematic interview and by [CONTACT_50192] . Eligibility will be determined as soon as 
possible  during the above process .  Inclusion criteria , to be  specified more completely in an operations manual , 
will include : 
 
1) Age !5.00 and "12.99 years  at study visit 2 , consistent with the investigators’ past work .  Children younger 
than [ADDRESS_52499] puberty, may in their teenage years develop symptoms, signs, and neurobehavioral outcomes of SDB that 
resemble those of adults more  than younger children.
64  Existing comparisons of age vs. more complicated 
Tanner staging, as peri- pubertal covariates of sleep outcomes, generally do not justify use of Tanner stages.65 
2) Parental ability to speak and read English, for example  on behavioral rating scales.  
3) Absence of known or anticipated neurological, psychiatric, medical, or social fact ors likely to  invalidate 
assessments , make adherence with CPAP highly unlikely, confound ability to demonstrate improvement with 
CPAP, or make local follow -up after AT or CPAP use  unfeasible.  Psychiatric conditions may be provoked or 
exacerbated by [CONTACT_50193], and those most commonly implicated – Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Conduct 
Disorder, and Oppositional Defiant Disorder – will not be exclusions.   However, more pervasive conditions 
such as severe autism will be excluded.  
4) Absence of chronic st imulant,  hypnotic, or strongly sedating  medication, unless families and their 
pediatricians are comfortable with [ADDRESS_52500] enrolls  prior to 
adenotonsillectomy for sleep -
disordered breathing.  Family

and main  behavior rating scales.

comorbidity will be required  initially  to participate in this research.  This will (1) allow participation by [CONTACT_50195] a wide range of SDB symptoms and neurobehavior al comorbidities; (2) facilitate  detection of associations 
between these measures; and (3) avoid dependence  on unsubstantiated assumptions as to what  particular 
symptom , laboratory finding , or neurobehavioral deficit  is necessary for improvement to occur on CPAP .  The 
investigators realize that in practice, self-selection may enrich the sample with children whose  families do have 
post-AT concerns  about  SDB symptoms.  To avoid the possibility tha t such participants may be too infrequent, 
the investigators will assess the proportion  of children with positive SDB questionnaire scores  (> 0.33 43) after 
each group of 10 subjects has had AT .  If this proportion falls below 50%, the investigators will enrich the 
sample , for example  by [CONTACT_50196] (i.e., every 2nd) participant  to have a high SDB score , at both the 
initial pre -AT screen and re -assessment 4 months later, before randomization .  For this purpose, the SDB 
score will be as useful, if not more useful, than polysomnography would be.15,44  The proposed research is not 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_50123], and validity will not suffer from selection bias or artificial enrichment of the sample . 
 
Note that Addendum #[ADDRESS_52501] 3 months (unpublishe d data 
from the investigators) .  After baseline  assessments , all subjects will be randomized to CPAP or non -CPAP 
(standard care) groups.  Group assignments will be made using a randomization algorithm, possibly with 
automatic adjustment that prospectively ensures balance between groups for SDB status, residual post-
operative SDB symptoms, gender,  age and/or  BMI.  Non -CPAP families will be contact[CONTACT_50197] 6 months at intervals designed to replicate the frequency and nature of investigator contacts in the 
CPAP group.  Discussion will focus on recuperation after AT, general healt h, and any suggestion of serious 
adverse effects that would warrant discontinuation of study participation and referral for clinical evaluation.  
These end- points would include recommendations by a child’s pediatrician or otolaryngologist to pursue this 
option; development of a new, serious cardiopulmonary condition that makes prompt assessment and treatment for any residual SDB imperative; or emergence of serious academic or developmental concerns in the setting of obvious, persistent symptoms of SDB.  Eac h questionable case will be brought by [CONTACT_50198] (section 6.5 ) for a decision  and possible notification of the DSMB per the Data and Safety 
Management Plan guidelines . 
 Subjects randomized to the CPAP group will have prompt PAP titration  in the sleep laboratory, and then use 
PAP ( CPAP  or BPAP)  at home at the prescribed setting.  Subjects will be fitted for masks in the sleep 
laboratory, with additional adjustments later, as necessary , by a respi[INVESTIGATOR_50124], the D ME 
provider.  Whenever possible, p rior to their CPAP titration  study or DME setup appointment, subjects will be 
issued a PAP mask for use at home while awake.  This mask may not be identical to the mask that the child is fitted with at the setup appointmen t, but it will be sufficiently similar to allow the child to become familiar with 
the look and feel of a PAP mask. The parent or guardian will be instructed to have the child wear the mask for increasing intervals while awake  to allow the child to acclimate to wearing a mask. The goal is to prepare the 
child for their upcoming CPAP titration study and PAP treatment.  The child will be asked to practice wearing the mask several times daily until the setup appointment at which t ime the child will be fitted with a mask and 
issued their PAP machine and supplies.   
 
Documentation of patient education on the use and potential safety concerns regarding PAP mask use without PAP for the acclimation process will be completed by [CONTACT_50199].  A copy 
of the patient education form and a summary of the acclimation protocol is provided in the Manual of Operations.   
 
Adherence will be followed and fostered by [CONTACT_50200], RN, who has  extensive experienc e in CPAP 
desensitization for children in the Pediatric Sleep Clinic.  Children and families with difficult adherence issues 
will be able to consult with Dawn Dore -Stites, PhD, a psychologist and faculty member of the multidisciplinary 
Pediatric Sleep and Behavior Clinic who is experienced with behavioral therapy to  promote adherence.   These 
 
efforts to promote adherence will match or exceed those that have, in clinical practice  here, produced  a CPAP 
adherence rate of 67% (see section C9.7 ).  Thresholds for referral are not well established in the literature, but 
possible examples might include:  
 
 a) Inability to tolerate CPAP during the CPAP titration trial ; 
 b) Success during the CPAP titration trial but inability to use the mask /machine at home for more th an 4 
     hours on the majority of nights over a 3 week period ; 
 c) Failure to sustain use of CPAP after a period of success ; or, 
 d) Failure to reinitiate  CPAP  therapy  after a perio d off-treatment due to an upp er respi[INVESTIGATOR_50125]. 
 
The number and frequency of visits will depend on: (1) the child’s current threshold; and (2) how the child and 
family advance through each step of the desensitization protocol.  The decision to hold on a particular step of 
the desensit ization program will be based on whether the homework was completed and/or whether the child’s 
current level of anxiety or opposition is elevated.  A recommendation to discontinue CPAP treatment may be made if the child or family has not progressed to anot her step in 2 -4 weeks (depending on the number of visits 
during that time).  Discontinuation of PAP treatment may occur after case consultation with other members of 
the study team to insure that all strategies have been considered.  Additional effort to i mprove adherence is not 
desirable because this would not resemble practice available at most other clinical centers.  In addition,  varying 
levels of adherence will be necessary to test hypothesis 2b.  
 Approximately t en months after AT (s ix months after randomization) , sleep studies (on steady PAP  for the 
CPAP subjects , without PAP for controls ) and neurobehavioral assessments  will all be repeated .  The sleep 
study is required to precede a valid Multiple Sleep Latency Test ;
66 will allow confirmation in CPAP subjects that 
any SDB is well controlled ; and will allow reassessment for residual SDB in the control group.  The [ADDRESS_52502] been used by [CONTACT_50201] -funded R 01s (HD038461 and HL080941) over the past [ADDRESS_52503] analyses.  These include respi[INVESTIGATOR_50126]- related EEG changes (RCREC) thought to reflect subtle but numerous and consequential inspi[INVESTIGATOR_50122];
71-75 an analysis of sleep dynamics, which focus on continuity of sleep and specific sleep stage 
bouts  rather than traditional totals of  time spent in each stage ;76-79 and quantitative analysis of esophageal 
pressure swings during each respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] c ycle through the night.75,80  Based on the investigators ’ preliminar y 
data ( see below and section C9.5 ), these automated measures may well improve the ability of pediatric 
polysomnography to distinguish children with and without clinically significant SDB and potential to benefit from CPAP.  
 One week prior to each sleep study, an investigator will call the family to confirm the appointment, verify 
absence of  unexpected illness , and encourage c ompletion of a one -week sleep log.   Nocturnal s leep stud ies 
will be performed  by [CONTACT_50202], child -experienced sleep technologist s in the [ADDRESS_52504] will be administered.  Between naps, a trained 
technician will administer neuropsychological tests .  All children will be tested  after a ni ght in the same 
environment, equivalent opportunit ies for good sleep, and measured total sleep times .  During  each child ’s 
testing, a parent will complete  behavioral rating scales, the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire  (described 
above) ,
43,[ADDRESS_52505] -AT, 
submission of electronic adherence data  (CPAP group) or other follow -up information (control group) at 7 
months , and final assessments  at 10  months , each child will receive a $[ADDRESS_52506] -AT, each parent will receive $ 250 for their time spent on this research . Parents 
will also be compensated for timely , monthly  follow -up contacts ($[ADDRESS_52507] completed within 5 
 
business days of the target follow -up call date) , which are important in assessing possible safety concerns on 
study.   
 
C4.  Polysomnography .  Sleep studies  will include six EEG channels (F3 -A2, F4 -A1, C 3-A2, C4 -A1, O1 -A2, 
O2-A1 of the 10 -20 international electrode placement system), 2 electro- oculogram channels  (right and left 
outer canthi), chin and bilateral anterior tibialis surface EMG, 2 EKG  leads , nasal and oral airflow 
(thermoco uples), nasal pressure through  pediatric sensor cannula e, esophageal pressure (using a pediatric

digital equipment ( Compumedics, Inc. ) with which the investigators have extensive laboratory -wide clinical and 
research experience since 2003 .  End-tidal or transcutaneous CO 2 will be monitored per the new (2012) AASM 
(American Academy of Sleep Medicine) guidelines for pediatric polysomnograp hy.  Both a research program 
manager  and a physician will be on call by [CONTACT_50203].  
  
Multiple Sleep Latency Tests will follow standard procedures .[ADDRESS_52510] of 20 minutes to 30 minutes .34,85  
Five nap attempts will be scheduled 2 hours apart, usually at about 8:00, 10:00, 12:00, 2:00, and 4:[ADDRESS_52511]  (J. 
Fetterolf , RPSGT, REEGT ) masked to subject identity.   This technologist  has meticulously  scored about 1,[ADDRESS_52512] 10 years.  Borderline polysomnographic  features will be arbitrated 
between the technician and the PI.  Scoring will be performed in batches: pre - and post -PAP studies of [ADDRESS_52513] criteria 
for children.
63  Double -scoring of arousals and respi[INVESTIGATOR_50127] , in 20 % of the  records , will be performed to 
generate a Kappa statistic for intra -rater reliability.  Inter-rater reliability will also be determined by [CONTACT_50204]. 
 
For Multiple Sleep Latency Tests, the sleep latency of each nap will be scored as the time between lights out 
and the first epoch of stage [ADDRESS_52514] well-validated and 
commonly used objective measure of daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_50128].86,87  Childhood sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_50129] a continuous variable for research purposes can be detected in SDB patients as young as 3 years old by 
[CONTACT_50205]43 and by [CONTACT_50206].85 
 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_50126] -relate d EEG changes (RCREC) will be computed as previously described.
71,74  Briefly, a 
central EEG lead and airflow from a thermocouple signal are analyzed.  Signals from computer -detected 
regions of apnea or hypopnea (generally a sm all minority of the total recording time) are excluded.  Remaining 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_50130] (early expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], late expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], early 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], and late inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]); EEG spectral power within pre -determined frequency ranges of interest are 
computed by [CONTACT_50207]; and the mean power for each quarter -cycle, relative to power over the entire 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_50126], is computed.  Results for each quarter -cycle segment are averaged over thousands of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_50131] (generally several hours of recording) and the maximal difference between mean relative 
segment powers is defined, for any given subject and within the  targeted  EEG frequenc y band, as the RCREC 
value.   The investigators have shown that RCREC are greater in children with SDB than those without SDB;72 
 
RCREC improve after adenotonsillectomy;72 they correlate with subjective and objective measures of 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_50132];72-74 this association persists after accounting for objective measures of SDB 
severity;73,74 RCREC correlates with esophageal pressur e swings but is far from completely explained by 
[CONTACT_476];[ADDRESS_52515] subtle but numerous cortical microarousals in response to labored non -
apneic breathing that pervades much o f the night for patients with SDB.73  In the research now proposed, 
sigma range (12 -15 Hz) RCREC will be the main focus, as RCREC within this range h ave proved most 
sensitive to sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_50128].73,[ADDRESS_52516], continu ous measures provided postoperatively by 
[CONTACT_50208], cognitive assessments, and Multiple Sleep Latency Tests do not reach levels identical to those of controls  and should  be more sensitive to benefits from CPAP after AT.  
 
Behavioral Assessmen ts:  Standardized rating scales  to be  completed by a child’s parent or guardian will 
include  the Conners’ Parent Rating Scales  (CPRS -R:L)
[ADDRESS_52517] ( CBCL) ,97 with the 
primary study outcome measure, Behavioral Index, b eing constructed from the sum of the T -scores from the 
Conner s’ ADHD Index and CBCL Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Problems.  Parents also will complete the 
CPRS -R:L and CBCL at the pre -operative meeting after signing the consent materials with their child.  
Although not representing a primary outcome point for this study, this assessment will serve to familiarize parents with the process of observat ional reporting on  their child; provide important information or groupi[INVESTIGATOR_50133]; and help to confirm that CPAP and control groups have equivalent behavior 
at baseline.   Because of the importance consistently reported for the measurement of executi ve functioning in 
children with SDB,
15  the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning (BRIEF)98 also will be completed.  
Finally, quality of life will be measured from both the Peds -QL parent and child forms.99  The CPRS -R:L, CBCL, 
and BRIEF are available in teacher forms that will  allow secondary, corroborative assessment in both a home 
and school environment , and help address  any evident42 parental bias.  Through experi ence in our laboratory 
and work with the multicenter Childhood Adenotonsillectomy  (CHAT)  trial, for which our center directs quality 
assurance and monitoring of behavioral and cognitive assessments, we have developed techniques to sustain 
strong return rat es for teacher ratings.  
 
Any or all survey instruments used in this study may be administered as paper forms  or electronic versions , 
which may be delivered by [CONTACT_50209] a web -based software system such as Qualtrics,  or as a  combination of 
paper and pencil and electronic formats, depending on the form type and the reporter (child, parent or teacher).   
Any instrument for survey over the internet will be or is being developed through the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_50134] d MCIT to be sure it is HIPPA compliant, as are current measures employed in 
Psychiatry for their patient metrics.    
 
 
Cognitive Assessment s.  Tests will be administered by [CONTACT_50210] , neuropsychologist -supervised  
psychometrist  who is well trained to maintain  children’s motivation and monitor  the need for rest breaks or 
changes in conditions.  Each child also will receive a brief introduction to face -to-face testing using CogState 
(described below) during the time just following consent signing.  As many children will not have had the 
experience of being tested before, this introduction will reduce apprehension and familiarize each child with the 
types of materials to be tested.  The total testing time for post -AT sessions will be approximately  2 hours , 
spread between nap studies.  This is less time than  routine clinical evaluations  (usually 4 -8 hours).  All specific 
test sessions will occur  at the same time  of day, without variance between subjects or test and retest visits.

team staff  will review compliance data that is remotely downloaded via modems on the PAP machines.  
Alternatively, data downloads may also be done onsite from the SD memory cards in the PAP machines.  
Adherence and therapeutic data will be stored in a secure office of Encore Anywhere, a HIPAA compliant, web-based patient compliance management system provided by [CONTACT_50212][INVESTIGATOR_5770], the manufacturer of the 
PAP machines used on this protocol.  Restricted a ccess to Encore Anywhere “offices” is provided by [CONTACT_50213][INVESTIGATOR_5770], and the offices  are password protected.  The study data files will be ma intained in a separate 
office from the UMHS clinical patient compliance database in Encore Anywhere.  This will restrict casual 
access to the research data by [CONTACT_50214] .  Linkable identifiers will be used in the place of 
subject names to help maintain privacy for research participants.      
 Detailed plans to promote adherence, to be elaborated in the operations manual, will include phone calls 
approximately weekly for t he first [ADDRESS_52520] any problems early; a meeting with the study nurse or 
 
other investigators at 3 months ; additional meetings or phone interviews every 4-6 weeks; further intervention 
of Susan Armstrong, RN (research assistant and experienced pedia tric sleep clinic nurse) as needed; and 
referral to Dawn Dore -Stites, PhD ( co-investigator  and psychologist in Pediatric Sleep and Behavior Clinic) 
when adherence is problematic.   All no -CPAP group participants will receive a series of contacts from an 
investigator, to control for this potential confound (see Introduction), including an interval visit with the study 
nurse or other investigators  between study visits 2 and 4, whenever possible; assistance with referral at the 
end of the study for any desired or indicated clinical follow -up; and research- funded PAP equipment if a child 
without insurance coverage requires treatment.   A brief 7 -items survey will be administered to children and 
parents  (both arms of the study) at the interval (~3month followup) clinic visit  with study staff and again at the

(c) Exploratory Outcome Measures;  
Measures  of academic achievement, fluid cognition, and REREC are all considered exploratory.  
 
C8.  Analyses .  For Hypothesis [ADDRESS_52522] -AT SDB as an outcome variable will be defined as a respi[INVESTIGATOR_50139] (RDI) ≥ 1 obstructive or mixed apnea, hypopnea, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_21266]- related arousal per 
hour of sleep.63  The  22-item SDB scale score (on a continuous scale from 0.0 to 1.0 43) will provide the main 
explanat ory variable.  Logistic regression models will be assessed for  sensitivity to potential covariates or 
confounds , including age, gender, race, body mass index z -score, and socioeconomic status.  Secondary  
analyses will focus on RDI as a continuous outcome ; validated snoring, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], and behavior subscales 
within  the SDB scale;  habitual snoring as a single, previously informative9,104 question- item; and most 
importantly SDB data generated by [CONTACT_50217], as described above, exploratory analyses for 
RCREC, esophageal pressures, and sleep dynamics .  For Hypothesis 1b , multiple linear regression models 
will be constructed to assess cross- sectional associations between each neurobehavioral morbidity  (the 
Behavioral Index  being the primary outcome)  and the SDB questionnaire score or RDI as the main  explanatory 
variable .  Models of the SDB questionnaire will use a slightly shortened, 16 -item version (as previously 9,105) to 
exclude behavioral questions that would  correlate with outcome measures  for artificial reasons .  Covariates  as 
above will be taken into account.   Secondary  analyses will 1) assess the impact of SDB scores or RDI on other 
behavioral and cognitive measures ; 2) take IQ and achievement into account within the main model s; and 3) 
test the [ADDRESS_52523]-
PAP improvem ent in neurobehavioral variables  as outcomes .  The pre-CPAP SDB questionnaire scores or 
RDI will serve as the main explanatory variables.  Secondary  analyses will use the 3 SDB measures generated 
by [CONTACT_50218].  To ass ess Hypothesis 2b , the same outcomes will be 
regressed on CPAP adherent vs. non -adherent categorization, as well as ( secondarily ) a continuous measure 
of adherence as defined by [CONTACT_50219] 3 months of the  trial.  As with Hypotheses 
1a and 1b, models for 2a and 2b also will be assessed after adjustment  for similar potential covariates or 
confounds .  To assess Hypothesis 2c , intent -to-treat analyses will use models that regress each primary 
neurobehavioral o utcome on initial CPAP vs. control group assignment, after adjustment for BMI z -scores, age, 
 
gender, race, and socioeconomic status.  Exploratory models will in addition consider  RDI (or computer 
algorithm proxy measures) and PSQ scores at [ADDRESS_52524]-AT, to assess whether residual SDB on  
these measures may explain differences in neurobehavioral outcomes.  Exploratory analyses will also compare 
outcomes between CPAP -adherent subjects and controls, to assess (by [CONTACT_50220] -to-treat 
analysis) what benefit may be lost by [CONTACT_50221], cross -overs, or drop outs.    
 
In addition to standard SAS and Excel databases, REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture)  may be used 
for database development and data capture and management  on this s tudy as well as in tracking study activity .  
REDCap is  a web- based electronic data capture system available under contract to the University of 
Michigan.   Developed by [CONTACT_50222], with collaboration from a consortium of institutional partners, 
REDCap provides a secure, web -based application designed to support data capture for research 
studies.   REDCap is endorsed by [CONTACT_50223] (MICHR) and is part 
of larger data collection initiatives under the CTSA g rant.  REDCap was developed specifically around HIPAA -
Security guidelines and has been disseminated for use locally at other institutions.   By [CONTACT_20169] -2011, REDCap was 
being used by [CONTACT_726] 200 academic/nonprofit consortium partners on six continents support ing more than 
20,000 research end- users ( www.project -redcap.org ). 
 
At the University of Michigan, the application is restricted to users on the UMHS Internal Network requiring a secure connection to communicate with U -M services i.e. VPN.   The database is stored on a server separate 
from the application.   Servers are maintained and supported by [CONTACT_50224] 
(MSIS). REDCap Application support and services are provided by [CONTACT_50225] (MICHR).  
    
C9.  Sample Size .  Plans are  based on extensive preliminary data from the investigators on effects of AT for 
childhood SDB, and on the only quantitative preliminary data published, in 2009, for the neurobehavioral 
effects of CPAP in children with obstructive sleep apnea.60  Data from our group  (section C9.3) show that the 
proportion of children, among those who  undergo AT here for SDB,  who have residual SDB 6 months later  is 
about 50% or more, depending on criteria used to define  SDB.  C hildren with mildest SDB can have robust 
improvement in behavior , as measured with particular relevance for the current application on the Conner s’ 
ADHD Index .  This improvement, by 0.[ADDRESS_52525] deviations still separate Connors’  scores in post -AT SDB 
patients from those in controls.[ADDRESS_52526] improvement in inattention and hyperactivity on the Conner s’ scale (p<.001 despi[INVESTIGATOR_50140]) and in subjective sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] (Epworth, p<.001).60  Adherence with PAP correlated with 
improvement in t he Conner s’ measure (r=.48, p=.03) and the Epworth (r=.58, p=.006).  These results emerged 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_50141] 56% of all nights on average.  Our preliminary data ( C9.7 ) suggest 
that we can expect about 67%  our subjects  to show adequ ate adherence.  
 
Given these observations, we anticipate  conservatively that a sample of 80 CPAP subjects who complete the 
protocol will contain about 40 with SDB (RDI>1); that 53 will be adherent with PAP; and that most subjects with 
RDI>[ADDRESS_52527]  RDI<1 (but perhaps SDB symptoms) will  benefit from PAP.  For 
hypothesis 1a, to test for a correlation between SDB questionnaire scores and polysomnographically -defined 
SDB, we will have  80% power to detect a clinically meaningful  Spearman correlation rho ≥ 0.25 with α=.05.  
Similarly, f or hypothesis 1b,  which focus es on an association between residual neurobehavioral problems and 
either SDB questionnaire scores or RDI, we will be able to detect a rho ≥ 0.[ADDRESS_52528]  RDI>[ADDRESS_52529]  RDI<1, we will have 82% power to 
reject the null hypothesis (that the mean 6 -month change scores in the Behavioral Index for the two groups are 
equal) if the effect size is ≥ 0.8.  The  likelihood of this result is b ased on observations in our previous studies 
with the Conners’ ADHD Index, which is a main component of the Behavioral Index now proposed.  Based on improvement we have measured in the past after AT for children with mildest levels of SDB, f or the current  
hypothesis 2b, in which we will compare  about 53  treated  (adherent)  to 27 non-treated  (non-adherent)  residual 
apneics , we should  have power  of 0.[ADDRESS_52530] size ≥ 0.65.  This effect size  is substantially smaller 
than that implied by [CONTACT_50226] 21 children60 and by [CONTACT_50227].  For 
 
hypothesis 2c , comparison of 80 CPAP -treated subjects to 40 controls should provide 80% power to detect a 
Behavioral Index differen ce between groups (effect size)  ≥ 0.55.  The [ADDRESS_52531] AT at the two otolaryngology practices  during 3 years and 4 
month s of study enrollment .  In each of two previous R01 studies  here that followed children for 12 or 6 months 
after AT, attrition was only 5% with careful attention to each family from  an experienced project manager.  The 
study now proposed will conservatively anticipate 10% attrition, and target enrollment of [ADDRESS_52532] shown  that the procedure  
does not substantially disrupt children's sleep.67,[ADDRESS_52533] to characterize resp iratory cycle -
related EEG changes (RCREC),71,72 as well as sleep stage dynamics in children .76 
 
C10.2.  The pediatric SDB questionnaire to be used in this study was developed and validated by [CONTACT_4520] , and shown to be useful in many research studies.   The 22-item SDB component of the Pediatric 
Sleep Questionnaire  asks about chronic snoring, snorting, observed apneas,  other breathing difficulties, 
ancillary symptoms, and behavioral signs (see appendix) , each of which individually predict s childhood SDB  as 
confirmed by [CONTACT_25899].[ADDRESS_52534] polysomnographically -defined pediatric SDB, t he SDB  scale 
showed a  sensitivity of 0.81, specificity of 0.87, and overall classification accuracy of 85%, with good internal 
consistency and test -retest reliability .43  In a subsequent study of 78 children who underwent AT for clinical 
purposes, and 27 controls, the SDB scale identified subjects with polysomnographically -confirmed SDB both 
before and one year after AT.44  The SDB scale predicted current hyperactive behavior , sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]  (mean 
sleep latency) , and their response s to AT at least as well as sleep studies did .  However, these i mportant 
findings require confirmation , as the original aims of the research  did not include these analyses.  Fu rthermore, 
no data were collected on response to PAP.  Nonetheless, t he SDB scale is now used in many studies  at the 
University of Michigan , elsewhere in the U.S. ,107-109 and around the world,110-112 where it has been translated (at 
minimum) into Spanish, German, Chinese, and Turkish, with Korean and Portuguese versions in progress . 
 
C10.3.  Pediatric SDB often fails to resolve completely after AT.  Obstructive sleep apnea in children is defined 
in part by a n RDI  > 1.4,63  In the investigators’  recently completed , longitudinal cohort  of 135 children who had 
AT for clinical indications, 89 (66%) had an RDI > 1 six  months  after AT.  Using a slightly more conservative 
cut-off to define abnormality,113 based on statistical analyses of sizeable samples, 63 (47%) of the 1 35 subjects 
still had an RDI ≥ 1.[ADDRESS_52535]  SDB measures , as w ell as more subtle, experimental ones .  The PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_50142]'s 2007 Scoring Manual.62,63  The investigators are funded by [CONTACT_18121]  (HL080941 ) 
to further develop esophageal pressure and RCREC methods that improve identification of outcome -relevant 
pediatric SDB.  They have already published preli minary data to suggest  that esophageal pressures , in 
contrast to standard sleep study measures,  can distinguish post-AT children with and without residual ADHD .[ADDRESS_52536] apnea / hypopnea index is taken 
into account.72,73  The RCREC are derived from a  patented computer algorithm  (see appendix) , invented  by [CONTACT_1600] [INVESTIGATOR_6254]- investigator  Joseph Burns, PhD, at Michigan Technological University.  Quantified RCREC reflect 
the degree to which EEG spectral power in specified frequencies varies in synchrony with non-apneic  
respi[INVESTIGATOR_50126] s during sleep.  Published data from the investigators suggest that RCREC reflect subtle but 
numerous micro arousals that are invisible to the human eye,[ADDRESS_52537], a b ehavioral  / 
developmental pediatrician, and a dedicated registered nurse , the program evaluates about [ADDRESS_52538] one clinic follow -up within the U -M Pediatric Sleep Program.  
Among these subjects, 24 (56%) of the boys and 15 (71%) of the girls were obese (with BMI z -scores of at 
least 1.84 or 1.76, respectively).  Among the 43 children  (67%) who had been adherent with CPAP for at least 
3 months, with adherence defined as ≥ 4 hours of use per night on  average, 35 (81%) experienced some 
significant neuro behavioral improvement as reported by [CONTACT_50228]’s clinicians.  Among  the 8 
children  with less, but some regular CPAP use, 4 (50%)  were reported to have such benefit.  In contrast, 
among t he 13 children who were non- adherent, only 10 (23%) had such benefit  (p<0.0001 for the difference 
between children with and without good adherence).   Where improvement or lack thereof in specific 
neurobehavioral benefits had been documented, benefits likely to have arisen because of CPAP included 
 
improvement in sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] ( 86% of adherent  subjects, vs. 25% of the non -adherent ) and school performance 
(43% vs. 14%) .  Adherent children experienced improved mood (78%), attention (58%), and daytime behavior  
overall (50%), with reduced aggressive behavior (40%), hyperactive behavior (20%), and snoring (92%).   
These preliminary data are important because they show  that CPAP  as administered by [CONTACT_20685],  
after AT, is 1) well tolerated by [CONTACT_50229] (43 of 64) ; 2) associated with significant clinical 
improvement beyond that provided by [CONTACT_44850]; and 3) likely to cause the improvement , as non-adherent 
children, a natural if imperfect control group, did not as often  experience the same ben efits.  Furthermore, this 
clinical sample in the State of Michigan shows high rates of obesity, an important risk factor that makes

6.  Protection of Human Subjects  
 6.1  Risks to Human Subjects  
 6.1.a  Human  Subjects Involvement , Characteristics , and Design :  Enrolled h uman subjects will number 
[ADDRESS_52540] press ure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) for 6 months.  
The protocol  will require several visits to the medical center, and either a) 3 nights and 2 days (total) spent in 
the sleep laboratory as an outpatient over a 6 -month period  for the CPAP  group, or b) [ADDRESS_52541] Michigan population, as reflected by [CONTACT_50230] -
funded pediatric sleep research here and from state -wide figures  (see Targeted/Planned Enrollment table ).  
The age range for this study is chosen because 1) the focus is on childhood sleep -disordered breathing (SDB), 
which is likely to have different etiologies, symptoms, and consequences in adults, 2) children younger than 5 years -old would require different cognitive assessments that would be  difficult to synthesize with those of older 
subjects, 3) children younger than [ADDRESS_52542] less clear validity, 4) teenagers gradually develop adult rather than childhood features of sleep -
disordered breathing (SDB), and 5) the frequency of adenotonsillectomy (AT) is greatly reduced in children 
older than the group to be studied.  The health status of the subjects involved in this research will generally be 
good.  At the time of enrollment,  subjects will be scheduled to undergo AT on an elective basis within several 
weeks, based on their otolaryngologists’ clinical determination (with or without objective confirmation) that 
significant SDB is present .  Some subjects may also have a history o f recurrent or chronic infections as 
another reason to have AT.  Most will be otherwise healthy, as medical and psychiatric conditions that would 
significantly limit the ability to test the proposed hypotheses will be exclusion criteria.  
 
Specific inclusio n criteria will include:  
 1) Age ≥5.00 and ≤12.99 years  at study visit  2, for reasons explained above.  
2) Parental ability to speak and read English, for example on behavioral rating scales, which are important measures for this study.  
3) Absence of known or anticipated neurological, psychiatric, medical, or social factors likely to invalidate 
assessments, make adherence with PAP highly unlikely, confound ability to demonstrate improvement with PAP, or make local follow- up at [ADDRESS_52543] commonly implicated – Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Conduct 
Disorder, and Oppositional Defiant Disorder – will not be exclusions.  However, more pervasive conditions 
such as severe autism will be excluded.  
4) Absence of chronic stimulant, hypnotic, or strongly sedating medication, unless families and their 
pediatricians are comfortable with 2 -week drug holidays before the evaluations at 4 and 10 months after AT.  
Other chro nic medications, in children without anticipated dose changes, will not be exclusions.  
 
After careful consideration, neither specific SDB symptoms, laboratory evidence, nor neurobehavioral 
comorbidity will be required initially to participate in this research.  This will (1) allow participation by [CONTACT_50195] a wide range of SDB symptoms and neurobehavioral comorbidities; (2) facilitate detection of associations between these measures; and (3) avoid dependence on unsubstantiated assumptions as to what particular 
symptom, laboratory finding, or neurobehavioral deficit is necessary for improvement to occur on PAP.  The 
investigators realize that in practice, some self -selection may enrich the sample wit h children whose families 
do have post -AT concerns about SDB symptoms.  To avoid the possibility that such participants may be too 
infrequent, the investigators will assess the proportion of children with positive SDB questionnaire scores (> 
0.33 
43) after each group of 10 subjects has had AT.  If this proportion falls below 50%, the investigators will  
enrich the sample, for example, by [CONTACT_50196] (i.e., every 2nd) participant to have a high SDB score, 
at both the initial pre -AT screen and re -assessment [ADDRESS_52544] effective tests of the 
proposed hypotheses.  
 
Recruitment will occur at practices of 9 otolaryngologists who together are estimated to pe rform 90% of all 
childhood ATs in Washtenaw County.  The investigators have worked with these surgeon groups and their staff 
for [ADDRESS_52545] shown that the se 9 otolaryngology 
practices rarely obtain polysomnography prior to scheduling AT for a clinical diagnosis of SDB.  This practice 
closely resembles those of North American otolaryngologists more broadly, who obtain polysomnography in 
less than 10% of case s prior to AT for SDB.
[ADDRESS_52546] will be made with subjects before AT (as opposed to 4 months later) for two reasons.  First, the 
investigators would like to minimize decisions not to participate simply because good improvement in 
symptoms are seen after AT.  Although every family will ha ve the right to withdraw at any time  from the 
research, the investigators believe that even children who improve after AT may well improve further with 
definitive treatment for any residual SDB.  Second, the visit just before AT will allow the investigators to 
administer simple but important questionnaires that will assess SDB symptoms and neurobehavioral morbidity 
at baseline, before any major intervention in most cases.  This could provide important oppo rtunities to explore 
selection bias at study entry; adjust statistical models for SDB or neurobehavioral problem severity at entry; 
compare gains from AT to those from subsequent PAP; and perhaps gain insight into what symptoms prior to AT may predict ulti mate need for post -surgical PAP that provides additional benefit.  Further, this visit will 
include a very brief cognitive assessment that will give young children experience with a one -on-one testing 
experience to reduce subsequent novelty and improve rel iability.  However, an addendum to this protocol also 
allows enrollment after the child’s adenotonsillectomy (at or before study visit 2) for families who are not able to  
to schedule  a preoperative study visit  due to time const raints at the time of the ini tial referral , or because they 
were referred only after the surgery .  This will allow more opportunities for participation of eligible children who 
would otherwise have enrolled preoperatively.   
 
. 
 
Adherence to CPAP or BPAP is also central to the proposed  research.  The investigators do not wish to set up 
an adherence -promoting system that would be completely unrealistic in clinical practice, for fear that research 
results would not be generalizable.  Furthermore, hypothesis 2b seeks to compare adherent an d non- adherent 
subjects.  However, the protocol does have several features that will facilitate adherence and help to ensure 
that about 2/[ADDRESS_52547] adherent to PAP.  These features include involvement of an equipment 
provider ( respi[INVESTIGATOR_50143]) who is particularly experienced with PAP for children; regular 
follow -up by [CONTACT_50231], RN (Pediatric Sleep Clinic Nurse) and the study 
coordinator ; and intervention whenever necessary by [CONTACT_50232] -Stites, PhD, a child psychologist and faculty 
member of the Pediatric Sleep and Behavior Clinic who specializes in desensitization and other behavioral approaches needed to help children and parents adapt to successful use of PAP at home.   Approaches that 
are similar if not quite so thorough (e.g., with weekly contact [CONTACT_50233]) are routine in our pediatric sleep clinic, as 
at other leading academic programs, and have  result ed in a 67%  adherence rate in our preliminary  data.   
 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_50144], children are involved in this protocol for compelling 
reasons.  Childhood SDB is a distinct entity from the adult form in many respects, and only study of the 
appropriate age group will improve understanding and treatment of childhood SDB.  Large tonsils most often 
play an important role in children whereas they rarely do in adults.  Adenotonsillectomy for SDB is performed much more commonly in children than adults.  Vulnerability to effects of SDB d uring childhood, in comparison 
to adulthood, is complicated by [CONTACT_50234], emotional, and physical spheres that could have lifelong impact.  Neurobehavioral consequences of SDB arise in both children and adults, but whereas inattention and hyperactivity are often main complaints for families of affected children, adults much more often 
 
focus on daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008].  Extensive data from adults are already being generated with regard to CPAP, 
optimal candidates for CPAP, and benefits of CPAP, including neurobehavioral benefits (e.g., see 5 U01 
HL068060 ), whereas neurobehavioral effects of CPAP in children remain largely unexplored.  
 
The proposed protocol adheres to the ethical principles outlined by [CONTACT_50235].[ADDRESS_52548] s or treatments that stand no chance to 
benefit him or her personally.  This follows from decisions made about the randomized control arm (see 
Introduction), which will involve only standard care and periodic contacts from investigators .  No child will be 
deprived of needed medical care.  Agreement to participate in this research will not prevent any family from 
withdrawing at any time.  Although control subjects will receive no intervention  beyond frequent contacts with 
investigators or the program manager , the investigators anticipate based on their previous research that few 
will leave the protocol to seek clinical care.  Those contacts also will be used to ensure that any highly unlikely 
but conceivable situations in which absence of CPAP could pose an u rgent medical threat will be detected 
early so that the subject can be removed from the study .  Lastly, the principle of justice is respected because 
the population  to be  studied will be  exactly that which stands to gain most from the results of the study.  
 For the CPAP group, t he dose, frequency, and administration of PAP after AT will follow standard clinical care 
approaches.  Use of the PAP machine will be encouraged for every night and whenever sleep occurs during 
the day.  The pressure setting will be determined in a sleep laboratory during a standard CPAP (or BPAP, 
when necessary) titration study.  Titrations will start at [ADDRESS_52549].  Sleep technologists experienced with children, in a control room adjacent to the sleep laboratory 
bedroom, will increase pressure settings in small increments until they see no residual evidence of SDB.  If  
CPAP settings become too high, CPAP is not tolerated even at lower settings, CPAP is not effective, or 
hypoventilation persists, BPAP may be tried and titrated in a similar manner.  After scoring by [CONTACT_50236], 
Timothy Hoban, MD (director of the Pediat ric Sleep Medicine Program and board certified in sleep medicine) 
will review the entire recording and determine an optimal pressure setting.  Requests for this setting, and 
equipment that proved effective in the sleep laboratory, will then be sent to MedE quip, where an experienced 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_50145].  
 The proposed clinical research will occur at one site (University of Michigan Health System).  Another site, 
Michigan Tech Resear ch Institute (an Ann Arbor unit of Michigan Technological University) will perform signal 
analysis on de- identified recordings.  Otolaryngologists at the University of Michigan and St. Joseph Mercy 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], also in Ann Arbor, will assist with identificati on of subjects and families willing to hear more about the 
protocol, and will forward contact [CONTACT_50237] a FAX form.  This form, in use for the past 
[ADDRESS_52550]’s otolaryngologist, with 
permission of the parents.  This IRB -approved system has worked well in practice for many years.  
 6.1.b  Sources of Materials :  Research material will be obtained from questionnaires, interviews, parental 
behavior rating scales, neuropsychological tests, nocturnal polysomnography, and daytime Multiple Sleep 
Latency Tests .  All of these  data will be obtained speci fically for research purposes.  Access  to medical records 
will be requested from the University of Michigan Medical IRB, mainly for any demographic data, medication 
lists, or other information that might be missing from study- specific forms, and not for collection of any of the 
main variables under study.  Each of the investigators will have access to individually identifiable private 
information about human subjects.  Individuals not on the investigative team will not have access to this 
information.  Written data will be stored in locked cabi nets, in locked offices, separate from keys that identify 
subject names.  Electronic data will be stored on password- protected, regularly -backed -up server files and on 
DVDs or external hard drives kept securely.  
 
 
6.1.c  Potential Risks:  Only minimal risks  are associated with the  interviews, behavioral rating s, and 
neuropsychological tests to be administered to children or their parents.  Neuropsyc hological testing will be 
brief, about [ADDRESS_52551] time, placement of the esophageal catheter down the nose and throat can create 
transient discomfort or anxiety for some children.  Vomiting, persistent coughing, or nose bleeding occur rarely .  
Other  risks  of the sleep studies include the stress of an unfamiliar environment, stranger anxieties, separation 
anxieties (e.g., during daytime nap studies), a night of sleep that may not be as restful as that obtained at home, and cutaneous allergic reaction or irritation that can occur a t the site of electrode or tape placement .  
Finally, as in any research, risks exist for bre ach of confidentiality and loss of data.  Overall, the benefit to the 
child of sleep study results, neuro behavioral assessment, and what is almost always a fun, pos itive, and 
memorable experience is likely to outweigh potential harm.  Almost all children and families (95%) who have 
completed similar testing protocols at baseline in the past have been glad to repeat them again one year later.  
 
The protocol also calls for 2/[ADDRESS_52552] masks, and equipment are not yet FDA -approved for use in 
children.   In adults with sleep apnea, use of CPAP improves quality of life to an extent that substantially 
outweighs any detriment  arising from having to use the equipment.116  Randomized controlled CPAP trials now 
commo nly use sham CPAP or no CPAP as a control, even in vulnerable or gravely ill populations such as 
patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, heart failure, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], or stroke.117,118  The research now proposed 
will include a “No  CPAP ” comparison group.  However, children who are identified as having excessively 
severe OSA at study visit [ADDRESS_52553]. Joseph/Mercy Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_50146] -specific testing or treatment 
after their surgical procedure, so the control subjects will not lac k intervention they would otherwise receive.  
Like all subjects outside this research protocol, they will have the option to pursue any evaluation or 
intervention they would like outside the research protocol.  
 
Specific risks from using PAP include mask di scomfort or irritation of the face.  Nasal congestion or mouth 
dryness can arise from mouth leaks when a nasal mask is used.  Embarrassment at having to use PAP, 
especially if observed by [CONTACT_8699], could be another risk, especially for older children.  These risks are not 
generally considered serious, though they need to be addressed to optimize PAP adherence.  Rare but more 
serious consequences can conceivably include infection or changes in pi[INVESTIGATOR_50147] a persistently irritated 
site on the face (e.g., the  bridge of the nose) or limitation of mid -facial growth during the period when the mask 
is used . Mid -facial growth retardation57 in particular is highly unlikely in the proposed protocol, which requires 
use of the mask for only [ADDRESS_52554] Risks  
 
6.2.a   Recruitment and Informed Consent:  Potential subjects and their parents or guardian s will first hear 
about  the study from their pediatric otolaryngologists and associated office staff,  at the time that the surgery is 
scheduled.  A parent or guardian will ing to hear more about the study wi ll sign a brief consent, and on the 
same one -page form provide ( in conjunction with the otolaryngologist) simple information about contact 
[CONTACT_15750], date of surgery, reason for surgery, symptoms of SDB , and likelihood of S DB.  The form will be faxed 
to the investigators. Alternatively, parents of potentially eligible subjects may learn about the study from the 
study brochure provided to patients or the C linicalT rials.gov posting .  They may then  request contact [CONTACT_3265] a 
member of the study team.   An investigator will c all the parents to explain that:  
 
 
• We are conducting a study on sleep disorders, behavior, and thinking in children  who have AT for SDB;  
• We believe a good number of children with SDB ma y be affected in these areas;  
• Participation in the research will require either 2 or 3  separate overnight stays in the Sleep Laboratory; 
• Some compensation to both parent and child will be provided for their time and effort ; 
• Some  child ren (2/3) will be randomly assigned to use PAP at home nightly for 6 months, starting 4 
months after AT;  other children (1/3) will use no PAP during the same period;   
• All data collected will be kept confidential;  
• All participants are free to withdraw from the study at any time;  
• Summary test results will be provided upon request within several months after final testing, when scored 
neuropsychology and sleep results from initial and follow -up sessions are ready;  
• If preliminary review of test results suggest s that something may n eed urgent medical attention, these 
findings will be communicated promptly  to the  family and  treating surgeon.   
 
During this initial phone call, data also will be gathered to ensure that the subject meets inclusion and 
exclusion criteria.  Potential participants and their families  will be invited to the Sleep Disorders Center  to 
further review the above points , hear about  the research protocol in more depth, tour the sleep rooms , see the 
equipment used during sleep studies , and see sample PAP equipment .  At this time, a study team member   will 
obtain signed permission / consent from a parent or guardian and assent from the child .  Children older than 8 
years or able to understand the nature of the research will be asked to sign assent; other children wi ll be asked 
for verbal assent.  One copy of the documents  will be placed in the subject’s medical record, one given to the 
parent, and one kept on file by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ruzicka . 
 
6.2.b   Protection Against Risk:  Fatigue and anxiety during cognitive testing will be m inimized by a 
neuropsychology technician  who has extensive experience with child ren and  will give breaks from testing as 
needed.  If results of  behavioral  or cognitive assessments engender parental concern , the child and parents 
will be invited back to a m eeting with a child psychologist  co-investigator, who will discuss the findings in an 
appropriate manner and review options for further evaluation or treatment outside the research protocol.  Prior 
to study enrollment, tours of the sleep laboratory will gi ve subjects and families a preview of that environment 
and equipment used there, reduce any possible fears or anxieties, and give them a good understanding of 
study requirements in relation to family, school, and job commitments.  Technicians experienced w ith children 
and anxieties of this age group will conduct sleep studies.  Children will be offered a topi[INVESTIGATOR_50148].  However, children who do not tolerate placement of the esophageal catheter (ant icipated based on this group’s past work to constitute a minority of these volunteer 
subjects
68) or other equipment will not be required to use them.  Parents will stay with children during overnight 
testing to reduce separation anxiety.  Spacious pediatric sleep rooms are designed to include a sepa rate bed 
for the parent.  We will instruct subjects who obtain poor sleep in the laboratory to avoid operating dangerous 
toys, bicycles, and machinery until adequate sleep is recovered.  We will also ask parents to supervise such children at home until res torative sleep is obtained.  During sleep studies, a physician investigator will always 
be on call for any unexpected emergencies.  Studies will be p erformed at the Sleep Disorders Center in the [ADDRESS_52555] pods  is well prepared to meet the needs of children and families who participate in 
research.  If a cutaneous reaction to electrode placement occurs, technicians will remove the electrode and 
reapply it at another site with a different type of adhesive.  M ild skin irritation will be treate d with topi[INVESTIGATOR_50149].  Moderate reactions at multiple sites, or any severe reaction, will warrant study termination.  
Finally, every effort will be made to ensure, as in the investigators’ past NIH -funded pediatric sleep protocols , 
that this res earch experience is fun, positive, and rewarding for each subject and family. 
 
Problems with PAP use will be preempted in part by [CONTACT_50238], and children, about the purpose, potential benefits, and importance of nightly adherence.  Part icipating families will be well educated 
about potential problems, and what to do about them, even before starting PAP.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_50150],
[ADDRESS_52556] prior to the CPAP titration study, and again at the visit to the durable medical equipment company, to make 
sure each child is optimally fitted for a CPAP interface (generally a nasal mask, though sometimes a face mask 
or nasal pi[INVESTIGATOR_50151]).  This will minimize risk for discomf ort or irritation.  
 
 
After PAP is initiated, contact [CONTACT_50239] (at least by [CONTACT_648]) and will provide 
multiple opportunities to detect poor fit before this could lead to serious irritation, wound, or infection.  Mask 
disco mfort will be addressed as soon as it is apparent by [INVESTIGATOR_1312] -adjustment of headgear straps, or trials of different 
mask models.  Nasal congestion or mouth dryness, depending on the apparent cause, will be ameliorated by [CONTACT_50240] (e.g., by [CONTACT_2329] a  chinstrap); use of a full face mask; nasal saline irrigation; or 
improved use of heated humidification.  Use of PAP on every night will be encouraged: parents and children will be educated about its importance, what can happen if PAP is not used, and also  the fact that an occasional 
night off PAP could have some consequence – but not enough to make an occasional exception (e.g., for a 
“sleep over” at a friend’s house) impossible.  The concern that long -term use of a PAP mask could diminish 
growth of the mi d-face will be broached, but presented as most unlikely to occur within a 6 -month protocol.  
 
Some children in this protocol will use PAP without having enough underlying, residual SDB to benefit from the 
intervention.  During the treatment trial, neither i nvestigators nor families will know who these children are.  
Although symptoms may be readily apparent, sleep study results will not be available until after study participation is complete, for several reasons.  One is that sleep studies are to be scored in batches -- with 
several subjects’ pre -PAP and post -PAP studies all in the same de -identified batch -- to avoid any influence of 
scoring drift over time.  A second reason is that at present, knowledge about how post -AT care should be 
guided by [CONTACT_50241] y results remains quite limited.  The research now proposed, in fact, aims in large part to 
address this void.   
 
Fortunately, subjects without residual SDB after AT, as compared to subjects with SDB, have no known  
additional risks to use of PAP.  When the  PAP titration studies are performed, children without SDB will have 
normal breathing, technologists will have no reason to test more than the lowest CPAP settings, and the 
reviewing physician (co -investigator Timothy Hoban, MD) can be expected to assign t he lowest settings for use 
at home.  In other studies of adults, even CPAP at fixed pressure settings for all research subjects, whether 
healthy or ill, has been safe whether SDB is present or absent.
121-[ADDRESS_52557] been randomized to the control group will be contact[CONTACT_50242] 6 -month t rial at intervals designed to replicate the frequency of investigator contacts in the CPAP 
group.  Discussion will focus on recuperation after AT, general health, and also any suggestion of serious 
adverse effects that would warrant discontinuation of stud y participation and referral for clinical evaluation.  
These end- points would include recommendation by a child’s pediatrician or otolaryngologist to pursue this 
option; development of a new, serious cardiopulmonary condition that makes prompt assessment a nd 
treatment for any residual SDB imperative; or emergence of serious academic or developmental concerns in the setting of obvious, persistent symptoms of SDB.  Each questionable case will be brought by [CONTACT_50198] [INVESTIGATOR_1238], depending on the n ature of the event as outlined in the Data and Safety Management 
Plan, the DSMB (section 6.5 below) for a decision.  
 All information collected in the course of this protocol will be treated confidentially.  Written authorization will be 
obtained from a pare nt or guardian prior to release of any study results, except in the rare case of emergent 
findings that require immediate attention of a child’s clinician.  Applicable IRB, privacy office, and contract 
office approvals will be obtained prior to transfer of  data outside the research team.  Printed data will be stored 
in locked cabinets within a locked private office of the program manager .  Data will be linkable to subject 
names only by a key kept separately from the data files.  Computer data will be passwo rd-protected, 
accessible only by [CONTACT_3462], and backed- up to prevent accidental loss.   Published reports will not 
include names or make individual participants readily identifiable in other ways.  These precautions are highly likely to maintain confi dentiality effectively.  
 
Any unforeseen urgent medical problems that arise during testing will be handled or triaged by [CONTACT_50243].  This fully accredited facility studies about [ADDRESS_52558] has a significant chance of substantive benefit, at comparatively low risk and expense.  Each 
child will ben efit by 1) free te sting for residual, post -AT SDB; 2 ) family knowledge , if desired,  of any residual 
SDB after the clinical  trial is completed, to facilitate decisions about ongoing care thereafter;  3) identification of 
potentially treatable behavioral or cognitive problems that may not have been suspected or diagnosed in the past; 4) participation in research that past subjects and families have often found to be an enjoyable, 
educational, and rewarding experience; 5) development of positive attitudes towar d clinical research and ability 
to serve as community liaisons who can raise awareness of SDB among other families and children at risk.  In 
addition, families whose child has been randomized to the CPAP group may benefit from the free, gold -
standard treat ment for any possible residual SDB, with careful expert attention to PAP adherence for the 
duration of the trial.  After families have completed the protocol, those from CPAP and control groups will be 
assisted with referrals for any sleep, behavioral, or mental health care that they would like to pursue.  C hildren 
whose families and pediatricians would like them to remain on PAP will be able to keep the PAP equipment at 
no cost, which could be an important opportunity in some instances.   The CPAP machines that will not 
continue to be used by [CONTACT_50244].  These units will be made available to any control families who , with assistance from their child’s physician, wish to use CPAP for clinical 
purposes after comp letion of the research protocol .   
 
Potential benefits to other children of the data to be obtained in this study are significant.  The long-term risks 
to sleep, health, cognition, and behavior  of unrecognized and incompletely treated SDB  after AT could be 
substantial.  Diagnosis and treatment of residual SDB after AT – now believed to occur in half or more of 
operated children – could have significant  impact on social, intellectual, monetary, and health -related spheres  
not only during chi ldhood but  into adulthood  as well .  Risks to the subject from this protocol are not more than 
“minor over minimal, ” as described  above.  Therefore, the risk:benefit ratio for children who participate in this 
study and parents who assist them  is excellent. 
 
6.4  Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained  
 
For society, the potential benefits are sizable.  Sleep -disordered breathing has high prevalence among children  
(at least 2 -3%) and is most commonly treated by [CONTACT_50182].   However, current data , perhaps in part beca use of 
increased childhood obesity, suggest that many children still have some residual SDB after the procedure is 
performed.  This research will begin  to clarify which methods best identify appropriate candidates for additional 
SDB treatment after AT, and  what benefits can be expected from PAP in this setting .  This research will 
provide some of the first data directly relevant to common clinical decisions – who to evaluate and who to treat 
further after AT – that at present must be made based largely on p ublished pre -operative data that may not 
pertain.  The potential impact of knowledge from this study will therefore be substantial, both in terms of 
improved health outcomes and reduced societal and healthcare costs for children with incompletely treated 
SDB.  Risks o f this research arise from testing procedures (neurobehavioral and sleep) that are commonly 
performed in children and generally rated as “minor over minimal risk” at most.  Risks also arise from treatment 
with PAP, but this is not a systemic me dication, remains non- invasive, and has overall an extremely favorable 
side-effect profile and safety record in children as in adults .  Finally, risks may arise from randomization of 
some children to receive no PAP.  However, in standard care the vast majo rity of children who have AT are 
offered no follow -up testing or treatment.  In this protocol, all children will receive follow -up testing, and 
treatment will still be available outside the research protocol to any subject whose family decides to seek 
treatment as part of their standard clinical care.   Therefore, risks for this study seem highly reasonable in 
relation to knowledge to be gained.  No test article is to be used in this research.  
  
6.5  Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
 
The goal of the data and safety monitoring plan (DSMP) will be to protect patient safety and ensure the 
integrity and validity of the data.  We will achieve this with a protocol designed to monitor and report adverse 
events specifically related to the protocol evaluations and PAP treatment, monitor study progress, assess 
appropriateness of continuing or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356], ensure protocol compliance and data accuracy, and prevent 
biased interpretation of data or conflict of interest.  We will register this trial in a clinical trial  registry that meets 
 
NIH approval.  We will elaborate and modify this DSMP as necessary in working with the NIH to formulate 
acceptable approaches.  
 The original protocol was submitted to NIH and approved for funding with a medical monitor to oversee 
participant safety and data integrity.  But, more recent discussions with the NIH program officer have led to the 
suggestion that this project may be better served by a data and safety monitoring board.  Plans for a DSMB 
have not been elaborated in detail:  
 
Data and safety monitoring for this randomized, controlled, single- site clinical trial comparing CPAP treatment 
to no CPAP treatment after adenotonsillectomy will be accomplished in part by a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).  The board will be comp osed of individuals with expertise relevant to this study, its participants, 
or the evaluations and interventions that are planned.  The DSMB board members will be external to the 
investigators, external to the University of Michigan, and otherwise uninvol ved in this research.  The DSMB will 
be assembled and guided with assistance from the relevant Program Officer at the NIH.  The DSMB will 
convene, at least annually, and generally by [CONTACT_648], to review and make recommendations regarding 
recruitment and reten tion, adverse events, any treatment safety concerns, and data quality or integrity.  The 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_5972], grade, and report any adverse events, ORIOs, or unanticipated problems, 
with the assistance of the Program Manager, to the IRBMED, the DSMB, and the NIH program officer  as 
required by [CONTACT_50245] -specific DSMP .  
 
Adverse Events  
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_50152], seriousness, severity, frequency, 
expectedness, and relatedness to the stu dy interventions.  Information on adverse events or other significant 
reportable occurrences on this protocol will be reported to the Data Safety Monitoring Board.  The DSMB will 
be responsible for  (1) periodic  review and evaluation of participant safety, recruitment and retention, and study 
conduct , and  for (2) recommendations for  continuation, mod ification, or termination of th is clinical trial.  The 
DSMB will be notified of project -related, medical or psychological conditions, or adverse events that may 
require intervention.  Protections against risks in the proposed research will include those detailed above 
(section 6.2.b) .  No new  intervention, device, or drug is to be studied in this protocol, and risks are  likely to be 
considered by [CONTACT_3016]  “minor over minimal,” as in the past for other pediatric sleep research studies at the 
University of Michigan.  The PAP equipment used in the treatment arm of this clinical trial is commercially 
available (by [CONTACT_50246]) and commonly used for adults and children with SDB, though PAP is not specifically 
FDA-approved for use in children.   
 
Adverse consequences related to sleep studies, cognitive testing,  PAP treatment, or lack of PAP will  be 
communicated  by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_50153], either individually or in aggregate 
reports, depending on the nature, frequency, severity, and seriousness of the event.   The investigators will 
follow an approved study- specific IRB reporting plan for expected and unexpected adverse events, serious 
adverse events, and unanticipated problems.  The PI, IRB,  and the DSMB will be responsible for monitoring 
the safety of the study.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_50154] .  Non -serious 
expected adverse events that may be reasonably anticipated to arise as a result of study procedures will be described in the consent form, recorded in practice, and reported to the IRB annually as p art of the progress 
report.  SAEs and UaPs related to the study will be reported within 7 days to the IRB, DSMB, and NHLBI 
program officer per the study -specific reporting plan (see the Data and Safety Management Plan) .  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_50155] a SAE related to the 
study or any death regardless of attribution within 24 -48 hours of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_50156].   Non -
serious, expected adverse events that occur with greater th an anticipated frequency or severity will be reported 
to the IRB; consent forms will be modified as necessary; and subjects already enrolled will be advised 
accordingly.  Unexpected, nonserious adverse events that are moderate to severe and related to the protocol 
will be reported to the IRB and DSMB within 14 days and to the NHLBI program officer within 30 day if the 
events are unanticipated problems.  An expected but serious adverse event that is related to study 
interventions will trigger notification of  the IRB, DSMB, and NIH program officer  within 7 days of the event, or  
within 7 days of the date that the study team is notified of the event .  Nonserious  unanticipated problems or 
device effects will be reported to the IRB, DSMB and program officer within 14 days of study team awareness 
of the safety issue.  Intercurrent events and adverse events that are nonserious and expected or not related to 
 
the study  interventions (for example, common childhood illnesses, peri - or post -operative events or sequelae) 
will not be reported with the exception of a subject death which will be reported in expedited manner regardless 
of attribution.   Participating  families wi ll receive written directions and encouragement to contact [CONTACT_50247], [ADDRESS_52559] time.  Completion of the trial wi ll 
provide key initial insight into a range of variables that warrant assessment even if other variables prove 
informative with fewer than 120 subjects.  Risks of PAP are small, potential benefits are large, and harm to 
participants from completion of the trial with the full sample size is not anticipated.  
 DSMB Report s 
 The DSMB will complete annual reports indicating: a) approval that the study retains acceptable safety and data validity; b) approval contingent on specified modification to existing protoc ols; or c) disapproval for 
continuation based on safety concerns that cannot adequately be addressed, or threats to validity of the data sufficient to warrant closure of the study.  
 If the PI [INVESTIGATOR_50157],  the DSMB Chair, IRB, and NIH will 
be notified in writing about the disagreement and the reasons for it.  The PI, DSMB Chair, and designated NIH official will be responsible for reaching a mutually acceptable decision regarding the recommendations.  
 
6.6  C linicalTrials.gov  
 
This application includes an applicable clinical trial that requires registration in ClinicalTrials.gov.  The PI, 
unless informed otherwise by [CONTACT_18121], will be responsible for registering the trial before it begins.  
 
7.  Inclusion of Wom en and Minorities 
 
The proposed study population – children with SDB – is composed of approximately equal numbers of boys 
and girls , perhaps with a slight preponderance of boys.1  The sex/gender distribution within the proposed 
research sample should reflect this  broader population distributi on.  Boys and girls will be recruited for this 
study irrespective of gender.  Some  evidence suggests that the association between SDB and daytime 
behavioral problems may be more prominent in boys than in girls ,[ADDRESS_52560].  A nother NIH -funded  protocol  by [CONTACT_473],  focused on sleep apnea in chil dren undergoing AT 
between 2005 and 2009, enrolled only slightly more boys than girls within a sample of n = 140.  Therefore,  no 
outreach plans are anticipated to be necessary to recruit either gender in the research now proposed.  The 
sample composition s hould resemble that shown in the Targeted /Planned  Enrollment table, extrapolated from 
data on (1) children undergoing AT at this institution from 2006 -2009, (2) children  (n > 1000) referred to the 
PI’s previous NIH -funded research protocols  by [CONTACT_50248] , and (3) State of Michigan [ADDRESS_52561] or exclude 
any given race or ethnicity.  
 In the Targeted/Planned Enrollment table, some races or ethnicities are not highly repr esented because the 
overall sample size for subjects who complete the protocol is only n = 120; the geographical location of the study encompasses only limited numbers for some of these minority groups; and otolaryngology practices 
where subjects will be i dentified already account for an estimated 90% of all adenotonsillectomies (defining 
eligibility for the study) in a large geographic area (Washtenaw County, population 347,000).  
 
9.  Inclusion of Children  
 
The proposed study will enroll only children, w ho must be between 5.00 and 12.9 9 years old  at study entry .  
These ages represent a period at which several of the outcomes central  to this study, such as inattention, 
hyperactivity, and disruptive behavior , are particularly prominent problems.  Optimal co gnitive functioning , 
behavior, and alertness  are critical to rapid learning and normal development.  In children less than 5 years 
old, assessment of cognitive function would require different instruments (and generate different data) than 
those that can b e used starting at age 5.  H yperactivity could  be more difficult to distinguish from normal 
behavior .  In addition, performance of the Multiple Sleep Latency Test to assess daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_50158]  [ADDRESS_52562] particularly experienced in pe diatric research ; [CONTACT_50254], a faculty member of 
the Division of Pediatric Otolaryngology ; [CONTACT_50253], who directs the Pediatric Sleep Program; [CONTACT_50255], a 
program manager who has coordinated or managed NIH -funded pediatric SDB research for 11 years; Mr . 
Guire, a statistician who has assisted with pediatric sleep research for more than 10 years; and [CONTACT_50256], 
an experienced polysomnographic technologist .  The sleep studies will be performed in the Michael S. Aldrich 
Sleep Disorders Laboratory, a [ADDRESS_52563] subjects and families who participate in the proposed 
research .  This facility is ideal for children’s sleep research protoc ols.  Rooms are large enough to 
accommodate comfortably a parent who spends the night with the child .  Sufficient numbers of children are 
included in this study to provide a meaningful analysis, as explained in section C8 of the Research Strategy .

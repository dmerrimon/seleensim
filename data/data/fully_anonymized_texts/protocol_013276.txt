Protocol I NN-005 
 
A Randomized Study Comparing t he Safety and Efficacy of the 
InnFocus MicroShunt® Glaucoma Drainage System  
to Standard Trabeculectomy In Subjects  
with Primary Open Angle Glaucoma 
 
 
Study Synopsis 
 
Study Objective:   The study objective is to assess the safety and e ffectiveness  of the InnFocus 
MicroShunt when used to lower intra ocular pressure (IOP) in sub jects with primary open angle 
glaucoma where the IOP is not c ontrolled when using maximum tol erated glaucoma 
medications.  Study Design:   This is a prospective, randomi zed, controlled, single-masked,  multicenter trial.  
Two study groups will be included in the study.  The treatment group consists of subjects who 
receive the InnFocus MicroS hunt with Mitomycin C (MMC).   The c ontrol group consists of 
subjects who receive trabeculectomy with MMC.     The study will consist of two phases.  In the initial phase (Ph ase I), 102 subjects (68 treatments 
and 34 controls, 2:1 randomization ratio) were randomized.  Aft er 75 initial-phase subjects 
(about 50 treatments and 25 controls ) completed the 3-month fol low-up examination, all data 
was submitted to the FDA to reque st approval for expansion (Pha se II) to the full study 
population of an additional 412 randomized subjects (appr oximately 309 treatments and 103 
controls, 3:1 randomization ratio ).  Subsequently an expansion of Phase II was granted for 
another 102 patients with the sam e randomization schedule (3:1)  for a total of 514 Phase II 
patients. Phase I patients will be  analyzed as a feasibility co hort separately from Phase II. 
   A total of 514 subjects will be randomized in Phase II at 3:1 ratio. with a d rop-out rate of 6% per 
year, approximately 480 randomized subjects in Phase  II (360 treatments and 120 contro ls) are 
expected to have the 12-month examination and 448 randomized subjects (336 treatments and 
112 controls) are exp ected to have the 24-month follow-up examination. 
 The randomization will be stratif ied by [CONTACT_350481] d within-site by [CONTACT_350482] s status with a 
target of at least 60 randomized ph akic eyes in the treatment g roup and 20 randomized phakic 
eyes in the control group at 24 months.   
 Study Parameters:   The study population will consist of subjects diagnosed with open angle 
glaucoma with IOPs that are not  controlled on maximum tolerated  glaucoma medications.    All 
subjects will have medicate d IOPs of ≥ 15 mmHg and ≤ [ADDRESS_435580] Population:  For Phase II, each investigati onal site will be asked to enrol l at least 23 
subjects in the study.  Additionally, no study investigator wil l exceed 25% of the total number of 
randomized investigational device or control subjects. For stud y sites with more than one 
investigator, the total rando mization will not exceed 33% of th e total number of randomized 
investigational device or contro l subjects.  Each investigator should enroll at least 10 
investigational devi ce subjects and each site will be asked to enroll approximately 23 subjects.   
 
Effectiveness Outcomes:   
The primary effectiveness outco me is the proportion of eyes wit h ≥ 20% decrease in mean 
diurnal intraocular pressure from screening t o [ADDRESS_435581]-o perative examination.  
 The proportion of eyes with ≥ 20% decrease in mean diurnal intr aocular pressure from screening 
to [ADDRESS_435582]-op erative examination will also 
be compared between the treat ment group and control group. 
  
Analyses of outcomes will consid er subjects that fall into a fa ilure category.  Failure is defined as 
a patient with one or mor e of the following: 
1. No light perception vision conf irmed on two consecutive visits 
2. IOP persistently belo w 6mmHg (defined as an intraocular pressur e below 6mm that is 
present on two consecutive follow- up visits after the three mon th visit)  
3. Requiring a reoperation in the  study eye in an operating room c onsisting of: 
a. Trabeculectomy 
b. Placement of a drainage device 
c. Bleb revision (other than needling) 
d. Explantation or re positioning of the InnFocus MicroShunt 
e. Iridectomy 
f. Resuturing of the  scleral flap  
4. Glaucoma laser procedure (e.g., t rabeculoplasty, iridotomy) 
5. Other glaucoma sur gery to reduce IOP 
6.   Missing 24-month diurnal IOP  due to discontinuation from t he study prior to the 24-month 
visit 
7.   Post-operative introduction o f an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor 
 
The procedures shown below will  be reported as complications bu t are not failures: 
1. Needling of the bleb with or w ithout the use of an injected antifibrotic 
2. Laser removal of blockage at t he tip of the InnFocus MicroSh unt or at the AC entry 
point for a trabeculectomy 
3. Use of a viscoelastic to limit aqueous flow

1.0 Study Objective  
The study objective is to assess the safety and effectiveness o f the InnFocus MicroShunt 
when used to lower intraocular p ressure (IOP) in subjects with primary open angle 
glaucoma where the IOP is not c ontrolled when using maximum tol erated glaucoma 
medications.  
2.0 Study Design 
This is a prospective, randomize d, controlled, sin gle-masked, m ulticenter trial.  Two study 
groups will be included in the study.  The treatment group cons ists of subjects who receive 
the InnFocus MicroShunt with M itomycin C (MMC).   The control g roup consists of 
subjects who receive trabeculectomy with MMC.     The study will consist of two phases.  In the initial phase (Ph ase I), 102 subjects (68 
treatments and 34 controls, 2:1 ra ndomization ratio) were rando mized.  After 75 initial-
phase subjects (about 50 treatme nts and 25 controls ) completed the 3-month follow-up 
examination, all data was submi tted to FDA to request approval for expansion (Phase II) to 
the full study populatio n of an additional 412 randomized subjects (about 309 treatments 
and 103 controls, 3:1 randomizati on ratio).  Subsequently an ex pansion of Phase II was 
granted for another 102 patients with the same randomization sc hedule (3:1) for a total of 
514 Phase II patients. Phase I patients will be analyzed as a f easibility cohort separately 
from Phase II.   A total of 514 subjects will be randomized in Phase II at 3:[ADDRESS_435587] op-out rate of 
6% per year, about 480 randomized subjects (360 tre atments and 120 controls) are 
expected to have the 12-month examination and 448 randomized subjects (336 treatments 
and 112 controls) are expected to have the 24-month follow-up examination.. 
 If a 40% screening failure is c onsidered, at least [ADDRESS_435588] poll of U.S. glaucoma sp ecialists done in 2008 9 
indicates that 84% of primary tra beculectomies use MMC and 90% of combined 
phacoemulsification/tr abeculectomy procedures use MMC.  The eff ectiveness and safety 
have been documented in numerous s tudies.  Data from a recent p ilot studies are indicative 
that safety and effectiveness comp arable to or better than trab eculectomy with MMC can 
be obtained with the use of  the InnFocus MicroShunt.   
 This prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label, multi-cen ter trial directly comparing 
trabeculectomy with MMC to the I nnFocus MicroShunt has been des igned to establish the 
comparable safety and effectiven ess of the InnFocus MicroShunt and trabeculectomy with 
MMC.  Trabeculectomy with and wit hout MMC has been used previou sly as the literature 
control to prove comparability t o another glaucoma drainage dev ice that was granted FDA 
premarket approval (P MA), i.e., the Aquaflow
TM Collagen Glaucoma Drainage Device by 
[CONTACT_350487].  By [CONTACT_2329] a randomiz ed active control in the In nFocus MicroShunt study, a 
better comparison tha n literature controls can be made because there will be clearly defined 
and comparable subject populations  in the two arm s of the study . 
 The MMC concentration of 0.2mg /mL and 2 minutes of exposure wer e selected based on 
the recent NDA approval of the  Mobius Therapeutics Mitosol
TM Mitomycin C kit for use as 
an adjuvant to glaucoma filteri ng surgery.  This is the only ap proved source of MMC for 
this purpose.  Prior pi[INVESTIGATOR_350451] 0.4mg/mL 
and 3 minutes of application and th ere were no safety issues re lated to the concentration or 
application time of the MMC.  Review of the  literature shows th e MMC has been used over 
a wide range of MMC concentratio ns and application times from 0 .1-0.5mg/mL and 1-[ADDRESS_435589]  shown no clear advantage of 
0.4mg/mL versus 0.2mg/mL; therefor e, it is appropriate for this  study to utilize the only 
approved source of MMC for the s pecific purpose of providing an  adjuvant to glaucoma 
filtering surgery.  The allowance of at least [ADDRESS_435590] on enrollment of women in the 
study because of the one exclusion “subject is pregnant or nurs ing or unable to use 
appropriate birth control”.  
                                                          Page  [ADDRESS_435591] been identified: 
a. The cornea or iris could be dama ged during the implantation pro cedure or post 
implantation.  Based on prior c linical data, no cornea or iris damage has been observed 
although occasionally the device ha s made direct contact [CONTACT_4490] t he iris.  Additionally, 
surgeons are instructed on the  proper inserti on method.  This p otential contact [CONTACT_350488] (Ahmed, 
Baerveldt, Molteno) as they requi re placement of the proximal e nd of the tube in the 
same location as the InnFocus MicroShunt. 
b. The device may not be inserted comp letely into the anterior cha mber.  If this occurs, 
the device may be relocated to a different access tract or anot her device may be 
implanted.  In either case, this would result in an overall lon ger procedure.  There has 
only been one case with the presen t device in which a second in sertion location 
adjacent to the original location was required with the same de vice with a 
corresponding longer procedure tim e.  No other complications we re observed. 
c. Tube obstruction is a risk with t he InnFocus MicroShunt surgery . The device could 
clog if it remains in c ontact with the iris with resultant low flow and increased IOP.  
Although contact [CONTACT_350489] s been observed with the prese nt device, flow has 
been maintained.  If the tip does become clogged, the physician  can use a standard 
laser to remove the i ris material from th e tip of the device.  Also, fibrin that develops 
during surgery can occlude the  device.  There has been one tran sient tube obstruction 
from fibrin in a combined InnFocus  MicroShunt implantation and cataract surgery in 
an ongoing study that was resolve d with a flush of the AC end o f the tube during the 
initial surgery.  This risk of cl ogging is also present with th e proximal end of 
commercial aqueous shunts, whic h can contact [CONTACT_350490], or corne a and lasers are 
routinely used to clear deb ris from the proximal end. 
d. The bleb that is typi[INVESTIGATOR_350452]/subconjunctival 
pocket may develop excessive s carring (bleb encapsulation or al so called “Tenon’s 
cyst”) which can res ult in lower aqueous  flow through the bleb and increased IOP.  
The implantation procedure has be en refined to pr ovide for a la
rge pocket that is 
resistant to fibrosis and scar ring.  One bleb encapsulation was  observed in prior 
InnFocus MicroShunt studies and w as successfully needled.  A si milar risk of scarring 
is observed with trabeculectomy. 
e. Choroidal effusion may occur a nd lead to an observable choroida l detachment.  This 
has been observed in [ADDRESS_435592] been observed in existi ng studies of this device. 
h. No blebitis has been observed in clinical studies to date but i s a risk whenever a bleb is 
developed as a result of the surgery. 
i. No endophthalmitis has been observed but it is a ris k of this type of surgery, esp ecially 
in the event that blebitis develops.  
j. Hyphema  has been observed in several cas es but not at a level of 10% or  more of the 
anterior chamber and typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] r esolves within one week of surg ery. 
k. Aqueous misdirection is a potenti al risk of filtering surgery b ut has not been observed 
in existing studies  of the device.  
l. Decompression retinopathy has  not been observed but remains a r isk with this type of 
surgery. 
m. Persistent hypotony is defined as a n intraocular pressure below  6mmHg that is present 
on two consecutive follow-ups aft er three months.  This can lea d to hypotony 
maculopathy. No persistent hypot ony or hypotony maculopathy hav e been observed in 
studies to date. 
n. Corneal decompensation from MMC exposure could occur if MMC rea ched the 
corneal endothelium as has been r eported in an an imal model in the literature and is 
another risk. Avoiding contact [CONTACT_350491].  Co rneal 
decompensation has not been obser ved in InnFocus MicroShunt cli nical studies to 
date. 
o. A thin-walled avascular bleb ma y be associated with low IOP.  T his has not been 
observed in the prior InnFocus MicroShunt studies. 
p. Tube erosion over time resulti ng in a break in the conjunctival  barrier and potential 
infection is a risk in the InnF ocus MicroShunt arm of the study .  There have been no 
tube erosions in the ongoing studi es of the InnFocus MicroShunt . 
q. Chronic or recurrent iritis is a risk associated with filtering  surgery.  No chronic or 
recurrent iritis has been obser ved in the ongoing InnFocus Micr oShunt clinical studies. 
r. Migration of device ou t of anterior chamber.  There have been n o clinical cases of 
InnFocus MicroShunt migration out o f the anterior chamber, but there has been one 
case where the surgeon inadvertently moved the InnFocus MicroSh unt out of the 
anterior chamber during conjuncti val closure at time of the ori ginal procedure. 
 
The following potential benefits  have been ident ified (please n ote we do not necessarily 
intend to seek specific claims f or all these potential benefits ): 
a. The surgical procedure does not r equire extensive cutting into the sclera, as does the 
trabeculectomy in the creati on of a sclera flap and in punching  an internal ostium, and 
where if the cut is too deep, the re is a risk of hemorrhage and  loss of the eye.  In this 
regard, the InnFocus Mic roShunt is less invasive. 
b. The aqueous outflow through the Inn Focus MicroShunt is controll ed by [CONTACT_350492]. 
                                                          Page  [ADDRESS_435593] ored at room temperature.  
Brief descriptions of each are presented below: 
 
5.1 InnFocus MicroShunt device 
The lumen of the device as shown below is approximately 70 micr ons in diameter with an 
outer diameter of 350 microns and a length of approximately 8.5 mm.  It is designed to 
allow aqueous flow from the ante rior chamber to a bleb (blister -like formation below the 
conjunctiva/Tenons).    
InnFocus MicroShunt 
(All dimensions in mm) 
                                              
 
It is packaged in a thermoform tray that is enclosed in a seale d Tyvek pouch. 
 5.2   Double Step Incision Knife 
This disposable stainless steel knife has a 1.0mm wide cutting edge and a separate 0.5mm 
wide cutting edge at the distal  end of the knife.  This double cutting edge allows a track to 

                                                          Page  17 of 84                         INN-005 Rev.  072117 
 be completed through the sclera in to the anterior chamber while  simultaneously creating a 
1mm wide scleral pocket for the fin to be located.  5.3   3mm Scleral Marker 
This disposable component is mad e from stainless steel.  The ge ntian violet from the 
marker pen is transferred to the  tips of the marker during surg ery.  The marker is lined up 
with the limbus and a point on the sclera 3mm from the limbus i s marked with the marker.  
The marker is packaged in the I nnFocus MicroShunt thermoform tr ay and enclosed in a 
sealed Tyvek pouch. 
 
5.4   Marker Pen 
The disposable marker pen contai ns gentian violet to be used wi th the 3mm marker to 
identify the point of entry for  the knife.  It is provided in a  separate sealed and sterilized 
package in the InnFocus MicroShunt System Box.  5.5 23 Gauge Thin Wall Cannula 
This stainless steel cannula can be attached to a syringe fille d with balanced sterile saline 
(BSS) and placed over the distal end of the InnFocus MicroShunt  to flush saline through 
the lumen of the device and aid i n initiating flow of aqueous.  The cannula is supplied in a 
separate sterile package in t he InnFocus MicroShunt kit.   
 5.6  Outer Packaging   
The ethylene oxide sterilized I nnFocus MicroShunt and 3mm marke r are packaged in a unit 
box with the other purchased and s eparately packag ed sterilized  components for shipment 
to the clinical site. 
 
6.0  Primary Effectiveness Outcome 
 
The primary effectiveness outco me is the proportion of eyes wit h ≥ 20% decrease in mean 
diurnal intraocular pressure from screening to 12 months follow -up.  
 The proportion of eyes with ≥ 20% decrease in mean diurnal intr aocular pressure from screening 
to 24 months follow-up will also be  compared between treatment group and control group. 
 Analyses of outcomes will consid er subjects that fall into a fa ilure category.  Failure is defined as 
a patient with one or mor e of the following: 
1.  No light perception vision con firmed on two consecutive vis its 
2.  IOP persistently below 6mmHg ( defined as an intraocular pre ssure below 6mm that is 
present on two consecutive follow- up visits after the three mon th visit)  
3.  Requiring a reoperation in t he study eye in an operating ro om consisting of: 
a. Trabeculectomy 
b. Placement of a drainage device 
c. Bleb revision (other than needling) 
d. Explantation or re positioning of the InnFocus MicroShunt 
e. Iridectomy 
f. Resuturing of the  scleral flap  
                                                          Page  18 of 84                         INN-005 Rev.  072117 
 4.  Glaucoma laser procedure (e .g., trabeculoplas ty, iridotomy)  
5.  Other glaucoma surgery to reduce IOP 6.  Missing 24-month diurnal IOP  due to discontinuation from th e study prior to the 24-month 
visit 
7.  Post-operative introduction of an oral carbonic anhydrase i nhibitor. 
 
The procedures shown below will  be reported as complications bu t are not failures: 
1. Needling of the bleb with or w ithout the use of an injected antifibrotic 
2. Laser removal of blockage at t he tip of the InnFocus MicroSh unt or at the AC entry 
point for a trabeculectomy 
3. Use of a viscoelastic to limit aqueous flow  
 
The following procedures will not be considered as failures or complications but will be 
documented: 
1. Eye massage 2. Laser suture lysis in a trabeculectomy

                                                          Page  19 of 84                         INN-005 Rev.  072117 
 tolerated glaucoma medications.  The term “maximum tolerate d glaucoma medications” is 
defined for this study as three or more classes of topi[INVESTIGATOR_350453] 
(prostaglandin analog, beta bloc ker, carbonic anhydrase inhibit or, alpha agonist, miotic).   
If a subject is intolerant to specific glaucoma medications or the medications are 
ineffective, “maximum tolerate d glaucoma medications” may be fe wer than three classes 
presently in use. In cases where  one or more of the classes of glaucoma medications have 
been used unsuccessfully because of ineffectiveness or allergic  reaction or intolerable side 
effects, this will  be noted on the Screening form.  Combination  glaucoma medications that 
consist of two or more glaucoma drugs will have each glaucoma d rug component counted 
as a separate drug. 
 
The rationale for adopting these c riteria is derived from the o bserved outcomes in the 
Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study (AGIS)1-3, the Early Manifest Glaucoma 
Treatment study (EMGT) 4-5 and the Collaborative Initia l Glaucoma Treatment Study 
(CIGTS)6-8.   These studies taken together have shown that most eyes with  primary open-
angle glaucoma will progress to  a clinically significant degree  without treatment, that 
visual field progression in glauco matous eyes is intraocular pr essure dependent, and that 
visual field loss can be stabili zed in a large majority of eyes  with optimal pressure 
reduction, which is best obtaine d with pressures in the low-nor mal range (11-13 mm Hg) 
for eyes with advanced damage , and no higher tha n the mid-norma l (14-17 mm Hg) range 
for eyes with mild-moderate dama ge. All subjects will have medi cated IOPs of > 15mmHg 
and < 40mmHg at time of screeni ng.  In addition, all subjects w ill be in compliance with

9.3  Study Entry Procedures 
 
9.3.1  Informed Consent The InnFocus and IRB approved informed consent form (ICF) will be presented and 
explained to each prospective s ubject by [CONTACT_1720] a trained clinical 
professional before study-speci fic tests have been performed.  The investigator or a 
trained clinical professional wil l explain the elements of the informed consent form, 
including the risks or discomfort s, the fact that he or she wil l be randomized and 
therefore may or ma y or may not receive a  device and he or she will not know their 
randomization treatment until the [ADDRESS_435596]’s willingness and ability to meet follow-up 
requirements will be determine d. The subject will be given a ch oice to voluntarily 
confirm his or her pa rticipation in the study as documented by [CONTACT_350496].  After signi ng and dating the Informed Consen t, the HIPAA 
(Health Insurance Portability a nd Accountability Act) authoriza tion, and other 
applicable local documentation (e.g., [LOCATION_004] Bill of Rights ), the subject can then 
proceed with the screening evalu ation.  The subject has the rig ht to withdraw from the 
study at any time without conseque nces, as indicated in the Inf ormed Consent 
document.  Subjects are enrolled upon signi ng the informed consent documen t even if they 
subsequently fail to meet the eligibility criteria. Subjects wi ll be added to the 
enrollment log, and assigned a subject number.   The principal investigator(s) mu st retain the original, signed and dated Informed 
Consent Form.  A copy of the si gned and dated Informed Consent Form must be 
given to the subject. Note: Subjects will remained masked throughout the two year 
                                                          Page  [ADDRESS_435597] clinical tests to deter mine their eligibility for the study.  
 Subjects who do not meet the screen ing exam eligibility criteri a will be exited from 
the study.  An ocular and non-ocular  medication or supplements (including vitamins) 
assessment will be perfo rmed at screening vi sit and collected o n CRF for the duration 
of the study. Subjects who are int olerant to maximum tolerated medications should 
have history glaucoma medications recorded on CRF.  The screening examination will cons ist of the activities includ ed in Table 1. The 
study eye and fellow eye of eac h subject will undergo the tests  as indicated in Table

each other, then the eye with the w orse BCVA (or PAM result in phakic eyes in which 
the visual acuity is not 20/25 or better) will be selected. 
 
The other eye will be exclude d based on the first eye already b eing included in the 
study.   Note: If a subject does not m eet the eligibility c riteria, he/she may  be re-screened 
after [ADDRESS_435599] identif ication number  will be assigned.  
 During the screening process, the surgeon will prospectively de cide at what 
postoperative interventional IOP he/she will want to reinitiate  glaucoma medication 
or physically intervene.  In thi s manner, the decision will be set before randomization, 
such that there will be no bias  on the group to which the subje ct is randomized. 
 
 Default interventional IOP: IOP  ˃ 21 mm Hg (or ˃ the preoperati ve medicated 
IOP if that was lower than 21mm Hg) is the default IOP for rein itiating 
glaucoma medication or physically intervening.  
 
 Alternate interventional IOP:  IOP chosen by [CONTACT_350497] w hich he/she 
will reinitiate glaucoma medication or physically intervene.  
 (If the alternate interventional IOP was chosen and the post-pr ocedure IOP exceeds 
the surgeon’s choice, the subjec t will be asked to come back fo r a second visit within 
[ADDRESS_435600] ion.)

Control groups using a pseudo-ra ndom number generator with subj ects enrolled 
according to a predetermined lis t.  Each investigational site w ill be provided 
envelopes with randomization assi gnments.  The Treatment group will receive the 
InnFocus MicroShunt with MMC.  The Control group will receive t rabeculectomy 
with MMC.  Note: The subject will not be informed of what procedure he/she will 
receive. Neither the investigat or nor the investigational staff  will reveal the treatment 
assignment to the study subject f or the duration of their parti cipation in the clinical 
study  9.3.[ADDRESS_435602] with  appropriate 
screening and follow-up for al l subjects in this study:

 a.  Measurement of intraocular pressure 
Each time IOP is measured, the  physician or technician is to ut ilize a Goldmann 
tonometer; however, the indivi dual operating the tonometer shou ld not view the dial 
during the measurement and anothe r individual who is masked to the treatment 
should read the measurement and th en record the measurement to minimize observer 
bias.  At each visit, IOP will be measured prior to gonioscopy or dilation of the pupil.  
 
Each time IOP is measured, two m easurements should be taken and  the mean 
recorded on the case report form  unless they differ by [CONTACT_350498] n 2mmHg in which 
case a third measurem ent is taken and the  median value is recor ded.  All 
measurements must be recorde d within the source documents. 
 In order to determine the mean di urnal intraocular pressure (IO P) measurements at 
screening, 12 months and 24 months , values should be taken at 9 :00AM + 1.5 hours, 
12:00PM + 1 hour, and 4:00PM + [ADDRESS_435603] postoperative IOP measur ements (i.e., taken at Day 1, Week 1, Week 4, 
Months 3, 6 and 18), only [ADDRESS_435604] be reliabl e at screening for eligibility, de fined as ≤ 33% false 
positives, false negatives, and fixation losses.  (These are th e acceptance criteria used 
in the previous OHTS study.)  A vi sual field done within [ADDRESS_435605] should be repeated within two w eeks. 
 Visual fields are to be perfo rmed with a non-dilated pupil unle ss, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], the pupil is so miotic that dilation is required (e.g., < 3mm).  If dilation 
was performed at screening, it s hould be performe d at all subse quent visual field 
examinations.  However, dilati on should not be performed before  the IOP 
measurement on the a ppropriate visits. 
 
 Visual field interpretation w ill be documented on the Screenin g form and one of the 
choices in the following categories will be marked (Mills GSS c riteria were referenced 
to obtain these choices): 
  
 
                                                          Page  [ADDRESS_435606] outside of inclu sion range = MD of  > -2.[ADDRESS_435607] within inclusion r ange = MD of -3.[ADDRESS_435608] = MD of -6.[ADDRESS_435609] = MD of -12.[ADDRESS_435610] = MD of ≤ -20.01 dB  
Central Defects <[ADDRESS_435611] Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)  should be 
measured (BCVA must be 25 or mor e letters equivalent to 20/80 o r better in the 
fellow eye) using Early Treatme nt of Diabetic Retinopathy Study  (ETDRS) charts at 
4 meters (13 feet and 1.5 inche s, or 157.5 inches) in both eyes  and reported in 
LogMAR units.  At all subsequent  follow-up visits from 1 month and longer where 
BCVA measurements are required, LogMAR measurement (utilizing E TDRS) should 
be documented.  MR must be performe d prior to BCVA using the ET DRS charts and 
will be performed at all visits  except Operative, Day 1, and We ek [ADDRESS_435612] be retro-illum inated (“back-lit”).   The standard chart 
requires a distance from subjec t to chart of [ADDRESS_435613] should attempt to r ead each letter, line by [CONTACT_4548], l eft to right, beginning 
with line 1 at the top of the c hart (20/200 line).  The subject s should be told that the 
chart has letters only, no numbe rs.  If the subject reads a num ber, he or she should be 
reminded that the chart contains  no numbers, and the examiner s hould then request a 
letter in lieu of the number.  T he subjects should be asked to read slowly, about one 
letter per second, so as to achie ve the best identification of each letter.  He/she is not 
to proceed to the next letter unt il he/she has given a definite  response. 
 In order to provide standardize d and well-controlled assessment  of visual acuity 
during the study, all visual acuit y assessments for a subject m ust be performed 
consistently (e.g., the same li ghting conditions, viewing dista nce, etc.) during the 
entire study.  The following steps will be used for LogMAR scoring: 1.  The examiner records each let ter identified correctly by [CONTACT_350499] A cuity Worksheet to be provided t o the 
investigational sites.   
2.  Letters read incorrectly or not  read at all are not marked on the form.   
3.  Each letter read correc tly is scored as one point.   
4.  The total score for each eye  is recorded on the worksheet a fter testing is 
completed. 
          
e.  Dilated fundus examination A mydriatic should be used to dila te the pupil so that an exami nation of the fundus can 
be conducted with an indirect opht halmoscope and slit lamp biom icroscopy (with 
contact [CONTACT_13293], Hruby [CONTACT_350500]  60-, 66-, 78-, or 90 diopter lens).   The appearance of the 
optic disc, macula, vessels and pe riphery should be evaluated i n support of a glaucoma 
indication as defined in the i nclusion criteria and reported on  the Screening form.  A 
measurement of the vertical cup -to-disc ratio should be made an d reported.  All 
methods used to assess nerve abno rmalities at screening must al so be used at all 
required postoperative exams.    The optic disc photos should be pe rformed using HRT, OCT, GDx o r other method 
(such as stereo disc photography w ith either true stereo or sid eways displacement of the 
camera). Note: Assessment of nerv e abnormalities conducted < [ADDRESS_435614]’s evaluation for inclu sion in (or exclusion from) 
the study.  The examination will be conducted a t the prescribed intervals i n the activit y list and 
may be used for further investig ation at other follow-up period s in cases of hypotony to 
assure there are no choroidal effu sions, choroidal detachments or related concerns.

 A Konan specular microscope is t o be used for measurement of en dothelial cell density 
at screening and at the defined f ollow-up periods.  All reading s will be conducted by 
[CONTACT_350501] (CIARC) located at th e Department of 
Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences , Case Western Reserve Univers ity School of 
Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio. 
 
Cornea Image Analysis Reading Cen ter (CIARC) will certify techn icians and approve 
specular microscopes for study pa rticipation.   Only instrument s confirmed as 
calibrated by [CONTACT_350502].  Only technicians certified by  [CONTACT_350503].  Calibration of the s pecular microscope at each investigational site must 
be confirmed by [CONTACT_350504] s.  CIARC will provide 
sites a detailed site manual.  All technicians at CIARC conducti ng endothelial cell reading wi ll be masked to 
the treatment group.  Investigational site technicians will be masked to the treatmen t 
group for imaging as well.  
For each subject, central images of the study eye will be colle cted at screening, 3 
months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 m onths follow-ups.  Fellow e ye central images 
will be collected at screening, 3, 12 and 24 months. 
 
General instructions are as follows: 
1.  Place chin forward on chin rest unt il it touches the chin stop .  Ask the subject to 
close teeth together and relax their head, which depresses the chin rest. 
2. Forehead should touch forehea d bar.  Lower table enough for pat ient to lean in 
comfortably. 
3. The axis of head should be perpen dicular to the forehead bar. 
4. Ask the patient to focus on t he green indicator light. 
5. Ensure the patient’s pupil is w ithin the target circle on the m onitor in upper right of 
screen. 
6. Once adjusted, tell the patient you are going to record and let  them know they can 
blink until told to hold the eye open. 
7. Press the record button. 
8. Allow patient to blink until ju st before the “rec” sign in uppe r left of monitor starts 
flashing.  This can be predicted because the beam begins to mov e toward dead 
center. 
9.
 Tell patient to open wide and hold a s soon as “rec” starts flas hing.

 Notes:   
a. Use saline drops to moisten the  eye if it is dry, photograph is  black or photograph 
resembles the moon’s surface. 
b. If a shadow prevents analysis, s traighten the head left or righ t to center in 
camera.  Auto may need to be turne d off and camera adjusted man ually + 5 
increments to start to phot ograph in Manual Mode. 
c. If patient’s eyelid interferes with photograph, hold the lid fo r patient while 
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_350458], or lightly tape the eyelid up still 
allowing the patient to be able to blink. 
d. IOLs can reflect multiple beams  of light into the camera interf ering with the 
photograph.  If so, have patient l ook slightly off (right/left/ up/down) from 
indicator light until w hite reflections coa lesce into one or tw o reflection spots 
and then take pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103]. 
 
g.   Slit Lamp Examination The study eye should include a mea surement of aqueous cell and flare using the 
following grading system and then reported. 
 
For anterior chamber cells, in a  field size of 1x1-mm slit beam , the following grades are 
standardized as follows: 0 (<  1 cell), 0.5+ (1-5 cells), 1+ (6- 15 cells), 2+ (16-25 cells), 
3+ (26-50 cells), and 4+ (>50 c ells). The presence of hypopyon is recorded separately.  
The grading for anterior chamber  flare is standardized as follo ws: 0 (none), 1+ (faint), 
2+ (moderate, iris and lens deta ils clear), 3+ (marked, iris an d lens details hazy), and 4+ 
(intense, fibrin or plastic aqueous).  
The presence of corneal edema, pup illary irregularities, iris a trophy and pi[INVESTIGATOR_350459]. 
For patients with a phakic study e ye, the lens should be evalua ted for presence of 
cataract.  A LOCS III classification system is used and the out come reported on the 
form.  For anterior subcapsula r cataracts, the LOCS III posteri or subcapsular grading 
system is used to approximate the  characteristics of the catara ct and the number value 
reported.  If no cataract is pres ent, grade as a 0.0 in the res pective categories.  Use the 
visual LOCS III scale for gradi ng each of the categories, i.e.,  nuclear (color and 
opalescence), cortical, posterior  subcapsular and anterior subc apsular. 
h.  Gonioscopy 
Gonioscopy will be conducted as part of the screening process t o verify that the subject  
has an open angle and to identif y any anterior synechiae as wel l as determine if there is 
any pi[INVESTIGATOR_350447].  A Zeiss , Sussman or similar lens shoul d be used and 
gonioscopy conducted in a dark roo m with a narrow, short slit b eam that does not pass 
through the pupil and without a f ixation light being used.  The  Shaffer method will be 
used as follows: grade 4, wide  open (35º-45º): grade 3, moderat ely open (25º-34º); 
grade 2, moderately narrow (20º);  grade 1, very narrow (10º); g rade 0, closed (0º).  The 
grade number will be reported for  each quadrant of the eye in t he appropriate location 
on the form.

subjects are taking combination m edications such as Cosopt® thi s is to be counted as 
two medications even th ough this is only in [ADDRESS_435617] at screening, or  intend to become 
pregnant during the study period ; are breast-feeding; or are no t in agreement to use 
adequate birth control methods  to prevent pregnancy throughout the study ((hormonal – 
oral, implanted, transdermal, or injected contraceptives)(mecha nical – spermicide in 
conjunction with a barrier suc h as a condom or diaphragm or IUD )).  All women are 
considered to be of childbeari ng potential unles s one or more o f the following criteria 
are met: • Postmenopausal for at least 1 year • Surgically sterile  For non-sexually active females , abstinence may be regarded as an adequate method of 
birth control; however if the pati ent becomes sexually active d uring the study, she must 
agree to use adequate birth cont rol methods as define above pri or to sexual activity and 
for the remainder of the study. 
 
Females of childbearing potenti al will be instructed to immedia tely inform the 
investigator if they become  pregnant during the study.  Should this occur, the 
investigator must immedi ately contact [CONTACT_456]. 
 k.  Ocular Quality of Life (QOL) Questionnaire  A patient questionnaire is bei ng used in this st udy to evaluate  visual function and local 
eye effects related to the surge ries.  The questionnaire has be en derived from the 
Collaborative Initial Glauco ma Treatment Study {CIGTS} ( Ophthalmology 
1999;106:653–662) and identified in a draft manu script (yet to be published) as 
potentially useful for QOL eva luation based on the CIGTS histor y. The questionnaire 
was provided to InnFocus by [CONTACT_127958] t he authors of the manuscrip t. 
 The questionnaire contains 2 s ubgroups, consisting of 18 separa te items: [ADDRESS_435618] been extracted from the 43 question QOL 
questionnaire used in CIGTS. T he visual function subscale (11 i tems) includes 
symptoms and health problems de emed by [CONTACT_350505] a disease process independent from any t reatments or side 
effects: difficulties going fro m light to dark, blurred vision,  difficulty seeing in dark 
places, difficulty with near vision, trouble seeing when steppi [INVESTIGATOR_148520], problems with 
distance vision, dimming of visi on, problems with depth percept ion, visual distortion, 
                                                          Page  31 of 84                         INN-005 Rev.  072117 
 difficulty with bright lights  or sunlight, and trouble with col or vision. The local eye 
subscale (7 items) includes suc h problems as eye irritation and  burning, excessive 
tearing, and red eyes.  
 
After enrollment during screeni ng, the patient will be initiall y interviewed using the 
questionnaire.  The statements t o be used are at the beginning of the questionnaire and 
should be followed closely to assu re consistency of response.  Document the patient 
responses directly on the questionnaire.  The interviewing process will be c onducted again at several int ervals in accordance 
with the testing schedule.  l. General Health Quest ionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) 
A second questionnaire will also be used to document the genera l health of the subject 
before and after surgery.  Thi s questionnaire, in association w ith the questionnaire in 
item k above will be used to compa re the overall health status of the subject as a result 
of the surgery.  Both questionnaires will also be used as part of a health economics 
comparison of the InnFocus Micro Shunt surgery and trabeculectom y.  This 
questionnaire was selected base d on the well-doc umented history  of its use and the 
relative ease of questionnaire c ompletion.  The subject complet es this questionnaire 
without the assistance of an interviewer ini tially after enroll ment and during the 
screening process.  The subject a gain completes the questionnai re at the defined follow-
up points in the test schedule.  
The EQ-5D-5L consists of a cover page and 2 pages to complete –  the EQ-5D-5L 
descriptive system (page 2) and t he EQ Visual Analogue scale (E Q VAS) (page 3).  
The descriptive system compris es 5 dimensions (m obility, self c are, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort, anx iety/depression). Eac h dimension has 5 leve ls: no problems, slight 
problems, moderate problems, sev ere problems, and extreme probl ems. The patient is 
asked to indicate his/her hea lth state by [CONTACT_13158] (or placing a  cross) in the box against 
the most appropriate stateme nt in each of the 5 dimensions.  
 
9.4    Study Procedures 
 
9.4.1  Training Before any site may begin actual  device implantation, all inves tigators will participate 
in an InnFocus investigator tra ining session.  Investigators wi ll gain familiarity with the 
InnFocus MicroShunt through the us e of animal or human cadaver eyes.  Further 
training will be provided to the s tudy coordinators at each sit e by [CONTACT_350506].   9.4.2  Material and Equipment A listing of general equipment a nd materials required at the in vestigational site for the

The Goldmann tonometer should be calibrated at each investigati onal site in accordance 
with the manufacturer ’s instructions.  Each site is also to fol low their own standard 
procedures for equipment main tenance and calibration by [CONTACT_350507].  Calibration 
values should be recorded and the documents maintained accordin gly. 
 
9.4.3  InnFocus MicroShunt Surgical Procedure Mark the location of the implan t on the study eye sketch in the  source documents.  The 
following provides an overview of t he surgical procedure for im plantation of the 
InnFocus MicroShunt.  If possibl e, each surgical procedure shou ld be videotaped. 
 
A.  Anesthesia 
The type of anesthesia will be at the surgeon’s discretion exce pt general anesthesia 
is excluded and the type will be documented on the Operative fo rm. 
 
B.  Preparation of InnFocus MicroShunt 
Carefully examine the package c ontaining the InnFocus MicroShun t for signs of 
damage that could compromise sterility.  If da maged, discard th e device.   
Remove InnFocus MicroShunt fro m sterile packaging onto sterile field.  No more 
than 2 devices should be opened for each case.  Wet the InnFocu s MicroShunt using 
a solution of Balanced Salt Solution (BSS).   Note:  No cutting or modificatio n of the InnFocus MicroShunt is  allowed. 
 
C.  Preparation of Mitomycin C 
 Follow the instructions for use  of the Mobius Therapeutics Mit osol Kit.   
Prepare a syringe or line that can flush copi[INVESTIGATOR_350460]  (>20ml). (Training 
on the Mitosol kit will be provide d prior to study initiation).  
 
D.  Corneal Traction a nd Conjunctival Flap 
Perform corneal traction with 7- 0 Vicryl suture at surgeon’s di scretion. 
                                                          Page  [ADDRESS_435620] a fornix-based subconjunc tival//subTenon 
pouch over a circumference of 90o-120o at least 8mm deep. 
 
E.  Application of MMC 
Apply the MMC in accordance with the Mobius Therapeutics Mitoso l Kit 
instructions for use.  Use  only [ADDRESS_435621] under the subconjunctival/subTenon’s flap.  Rinse wit h generous amounts 
of BSS (>20mL).  Note:  Assure that the conjunctival wound edge does not come 
into contact [CONTACT_350508]. 
 
F.  Preparation of Anterior Chamber Entrance Site 
Mark a point 3mm from the limbus, utilizing 3mm scleral marker and marker pen. 
At the marked point, use a 1mm  double step knife in one motion to create both a 
scleral track into the anterior chamber (AC)  so as to enter the angle just above the iris 
plane and a shallow scleral pocket at the  mark just big enough to tuck the fin portion 
of the InnFocus MicroShunt.  
G.  Insertion of InnFocus Micro Shunt into Anterior Chamber 
Gently insert the InnFocus Mic roShunt tube with the bevel facin g toward the cornea 
through sclera track using forcep s and holding close to the tra ck entrance while 
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_350461] t o the scleral surface and tuck t he fin into the scleral 
pocket.  If there is resistance to the placement of the InnFocu s MicroShunt after 
multiple attempts to position i t, use a 25G blunt tip cannula t o re-enter the sclera 
track and assure it is open. Then attempt placement of the InnF ocus MicroShunt 
again. 
 
  
If the InnFocus MicroShunt is da maged during the procedure, use  a new InnFocus 
MicroShunt and repeat the inserti on step using the same tract.   If not accessible, 
another track can be made. After  successful insertion of the In nFocus MicroShunt, 
check that the InnFocus Micro Shunt tube position in the AC is n ot in contact [CONTACT_350509].  If flow is not visible, place the 
23G cannula over the distal end of InnFocus MicroShunt up to th e fin while 
applying slight pressure and injec t BSS to prime the tube.  Con firm flow, tuck the 
distal end of the InnFocus Micro Shunt tube under the subconjunc tival/Tenon’s flap 
on scleral surface making sur e it is not caught in Tenons.  
 
H.  Conjunctival Closure 
Reposition the Tenon’s and conjunc tiva to the limbus and suture  using  sutures with 
a long history of successful use by [CONTACT_350510] (i.e.,  nylon, vicryl).   A 
moistened fluorescein strip is  used to check for a conjunctival  leak, which may be 
closed with additional sutures. 
 Verify the presence of the proxi mal end of the InnFocus MicroSh unt in the anterior 
chamber.   
                                                          Page  [ADDRESS_435622] a nd packaging in accordance with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
administrative, and/or l ocal government policy. 
 
Follow the Mobius Therapeutics Mi tosol Kit instructions for use  for proper disposal 
of the MMC and kit components. 
 
Warnings and Precautions: 
- For one-time use only.  Do not  reuse or re-sterilize. 
- Long term effects of MMC with the  use of this device have not b een 
evaluated.  Necessary precautions on the use of MMC are highly recommended. 
- All types of Viscoelastics have  not been tested with this devic e.  However, in 
an emergency when all other ther api[INVESTIGATOR_161733], the use of h ydroxyl 
methyl-cellulose (HPMC) may be  an option. Use of HPMC should be  a last 
resort to correct a flat chambe r with the InnFocus MicroShunt a nd may risk 
loss of flow through the device fo r one or more weeks after use  necessitating 
close or more frequent observation of IOP. 
- Should the InnFocus MicroShunt a ppear deformed, folded and/or d istorted, do 
not use.  Avoid use of toothed for ceps to handle device. McPher son type 
forceps are recommended.  
- Do not use knife if it has been h it against or in contact [CONTACT_350511]. Such knife may be  damaged and lose sharpness. 
- Do not resterili ze the device. 
 
9.4.4  Trabeculectomy with MMC Surgical Procedure 
 
1. Investigators should use the fo llowing procedure for conducting  the trabeculectomy 
procedure with the use of MMC: An esthesia type is at the surgeo n’s discretion 
except general anesthesia is excluded. 
 
2. Conjunctival flap – the trabecul ectomy is performed in a superi or quadrant.  A 
fornix-based conjunctival flap i s used.  A corneal traction sut ure or superior rectus 
traction suture may be used to r otate the globe inferiorly and improve exposure. 
 
3. Mitomycin C applica tion –The MMC is prepared and used in accord ance with the 
Mobius Therapeutics Mitosol Kit instructions for use, again usi ng 4 half-moon 
sponges for delivery of the MMC under the subconjunctival flap.   The mitomycin 
may be applied before or after t he scleral fla p creation depend ent on the 
investigator’s standard practi ce (Training on the Mitosol Kit w ill be conducted prior 
to study initiation). 
 
4. Scleral flap – A corneal-based s cleral flap is dissected approx imately one-half 
scleral thickness.  The shape a nd size of the scleral flap is d etermined by [CONTACT_350512]  [ADDRESS_435623] – A peripheral clear cornea paracentesis tra ct is made. 
 
6. Excision of Limbal tis sue – A block of limba l tissue is excised  from underneath the 
trabeculectomy flap using a shar p blade and Vannas scissors or a Kelly punch.  The 
amount of limbal tissue excised is at the surgeon’s discretion.  
 
7. Peripheral iridectomy – A periphe ral iridectomy is performed un less a specific 
rationale is provided as to why it is not required.  The sclero stomy opening is 
inspected for entrapped iris ti ssue, and a cellulose sponge is used to test for the 
presence of vitreous.  Vitreous p resenting to the surgical woun d is excised.  The 
method used to remove the  vitreous present at the surgical site  is at the surgeon’s 
discretion.  Document any presen ce of vitreous observed. 
 
8. Scleral flap closure – The scler al flap is reapproximated to th e scleral bed with 
interrupted or releasable 10-[ADDRESS_435624], the anterior 
chamber should remain formed w ith a visible leak present around  the scleral flap at 
equilibrium. 
 
9. Conjunctival flap closure – The t ype of suture material and nee dle used for the 
conjunctival flap closure is of  the surgeon’s choice.  Either a  double layered closure 
(conjunctiva and Tenon’s closed sep arately) or single layered c losure (conjunctiva 
and Tenon’s together) may be performed. 
 
10. Reformation of the Anterior Ch amber and Bleb Elevation – Balanc ed salt solution 
is injected through the paracentesi s tract to deepen the anteri or chamber and elevate 
the bleb.  A moistened fluoresce in strip is used to check for a  conjunctival leak or 
leakage from the paracentesis tract, which may be closed with a dditional sutures. 
 
11. Intraoperative medications – The  use of intraoperative medicati ons is at the 
surgeon’s discretion.  
 
9.4.[ADDRESS_435625]-operative Instructions 
A.  Following surgery, the subjects will be instructed to adher e to the following 
antibiotic/anti-inflammatory r egiment and the frequency will be  documented on the 
Concomitant Medication form: 
 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_350462] B sulfate and trime thoprim ophthalmic solution 
combination (e.g., Polytrim) antibiotic or fourth genera tion fluoroquinolone 
(e.g., gatifloxacin [Zymar], or moxa floxacin [Vigamox], for one  week 
postoperatively by [CONTACT_350513] (4) times per 
day distributed during the waking hours. All subjects at a given investigational 
site must use the same antibio tic regimen unless contraindicate d by [CONTACT_190032].  
 Anti-inflammatory med ication (prednisolone  acetate 1% ophthalmi c 
suspension): 
                                                          Page  36 of 84                         INN-005 Rev.  072117 
 o Weeks 1-4: at least four ( 4) times per day for  the first 4 weeks. .   
o Weeks 5-8: two (2) times per day for the next 4 weeks  
o Weeks 9-12: one time per day for the next 4 weeks.   
NOTE:  
1. Anti-inflammatory med ications may be increased to ≥ [ADDRESS_435626]-ope rative medicati on regimen, 
consideration should be given to the appropriate tapering sched ule.  
At the 3 months follow-up, the inve stigator will determine if f urther treatment is 
needed.  Alternate antibiotic and anti-inflammatory medication regimens are 
allowed when the patient does not  respond well to the initial r egimen.   Cycloplegics 
may also be used for patients as  needed during th e initial heal ing phase or in phakic 
eyes. 
 
B.  At follow-up visits, there ar e some fairly routine practice s that are done by [CONTACT_350514] a diffu se bleb and lower IOP.   These ar e not considered as 
adverse events in the study.   They are as follows: 
1.  Eye massage done by [CONTACT_350515]-up 
form.  Eye massage should only be done by [CONTACT_350516]. 
 
2.  Laser suture lysis is commonly u sed to lyse one or more sutures  in the first 
week or later after sur gery to bring the IOP down.  Tensioning of the sutures 
used to close the scleral flap may set the pressure higher than  desired, but tight 
suturing is done purposely in many cases to limit acute hypoton y.   The suture 
lysis is also documente d on the follow-up form. 
 
3. Depending on the surgeon’s meth od of tightening the scleral flap during 
trabeculectomy procedures, the s urgeon may choose to temporaril y use 
glaucoma medications rather tha n lyse a suture too early and ca use hypotony.  
Therefore, the use of temporary g laucoma medications for post t rabeculectomy 
subjects will be allowed and w ill be documented on the appropri ate case report 
form as needed.  The use of a top ical CAI or alpha-[ADDRESS_435627] is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_350463] ([ADDRESS_435628]), and if any oth er glaucoma 
medication is used, a rationale  should be provide d on the follo w-up form.  
   C.  Interventional techniques ar e employed if the IOP increases  to the default 
interventional IOP value of gr eater than 21mmHg or greater than  the pre-surgery 
medicated IOP if lower t han 21mmHg for any subject.    
 
As described in the Screening sec tion earlier in the protocol, the investigator may 
have established an alternate int erventional IOP for the subjec t on the screening 
                                                          Page  [ADDRESS_435629] in the treatment and control groups and 
only when necessary to control IOP.  (If the alternate interven tional IOP was 
chosen and the post-procedure IOP exceeds the surgeon’s choice,  the subject will 
be asked to come back for a sec ond visit within 1 week to confi rm the IOP before 
reinitiating glaucoma medica tion or physically intervening. If the IOP also 
exceeds the default interventional IOP, such that safety is a c oncern, a second 
visit is not required befor e taking any action.)  
 
 
There may be cases where the inv estigator needs to bring the IO P down when the 
subject has not exceeded the int erventional IOP.  In these case s, the Medical 
Monitor will consult with t he physician to understand the ratio nale for the 
intervention and it will be doc umented by [CONTACT_350517] t he source 
document.  For the interventi on, the reason for the decision wi ll be noted on the 
case report form as one or more of the following:  IOP> default  interventional 
IOP or alternate interventiona l IOP, visual field change, optic  nerve change or 
temporary glaucoma med use pendin g suture lysis.   A field for “Other” will be 
used to document any other rea son for the intervention. 
 
 
      Physical intervention should be  considered prior to emplo ying glaucoma 
medications to bring the IOP down.  The reasons for the IOP increase are multiple 
but there are two commonly obser ved methods for reducing the IO P:  
1)     “Needling the bleb” to overcome part ial or complete closure of the 
subconjunctival pocket.  In these  cases, The InnFocus MicroShun t or 
trabeculectomy path to the anter ior chamber is open and can all ow flow, but 
the lack of an adequate subconj unctival drainage field is  preventing this.  To 
improve the flow, a needle is in serted into the sub-Tenons/conj unctival area, 
any fibrous attachment separate d, and the pocket re-established  (this is not a 
failure criterion but is docume nted as a complication on the Ad verse Event 
form).    
a. Needling with an injected antifib rotic may be preferred.  Both MMC 
and 5FU are used to accomplish th is.  If either antifibrotic is  injected 
subconjunctivally, the type of a ntifibrotic, dos age, and method  of 
introduction by [CONTACT_093] s hould remain consistent with both 
arms of the study.  Dosages of MMC and 5FU vary by [CONTACT_350518] 10-100 microgram range  for MMC and 5-10 milligram ra nge 
for 5FU.  The dosage may be deliv ered as a mixture with an 
anesthetic, e.g., Lidocaine.  The  total dosage volume is in the  0.1-
0.3ml range.  The name [CONTACT_350556], injection volume, d osage 
and mixed anesthetic or other agents are documented in the 
concomitant medications log and ne edling with an antifibrotic i s 
indicated on the adve rse event form. 
 
                                                          Page  38 of 84                         INN-005 Rev.  072117 
 2)  Laser removal of blockage at the tip of the InnFocus MicroS hunt or at the AC 
entry point for a trabeculectom y is another possibility and is documented as a 
complication on the Adverse Event form. 
                       
D. Glaucoma medications are add ed if common physical interventi onal techniques 
have been employed, but do not decreas e the IOP below the targe t IOP for any 
subject, or if physical intervent ion is not attempted at all to  reduce the IOP.    
  
E.  If glaucoma medications nee d to be re-introduced, glaucoma medications to 
which the subject is naïve s hould be deferred until after previ ously used 
medications have been introdu ced.   Barring interfering factors  regarding the 
method of re-introduction of glau coma medications post-surgery,  the 
recommended sequence is to first  add a beta blocker, then a pro staglandin, and 
either an alpha adrenergic a gonist or a carbonic anhydrase inhi bitor as a third 
medication.  As routine practi ce, medications should be added o ne at a time and 
the IOP lowering effect determined  before introducing the next medication.  
Based on the IOP level, the phys ician should decide on which me dications, 
dosage and order of re-introduc tion to choose.   The rationale for the re-
introduction or disc ontinuation should be doc umented in the fol low-up form field 
identified as “Investigator rati onale for medicat ion re-introdu ction or 
discontinuation” and the Medical  Monitor will discuss the ratio nale with the 
investigator as needed t o assure consistency.  
 
 Based on the sequence of drug re-introduction, there should not  be a case 
where an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor will be required, bu t if it is, it 
will be counted as a failure.    It is unlikely that any subject will be on oral 
carbonic anhydrase inhibitors at th e effectivenes s determinatio n, since they would 
be the last drug added.  
 
Medications which have been re- started by [CONTACT_350519]’s j udgment is that the target intraocular p ressure has been 
reached and the continued use of some or all of the therapy may  not be required.  
Discontinuation of medications a fter re-introduc tion is recomme nded to be in the 
reverse order of re-introducti on.  The rationale for discontinu ation will also be 
documented on the follow-up form by [CONTACT_350520].  For medication di scontinuation, the reason f or the decision will 
be noted on the case report form as IOP controlled or allergy t o medication.  A 
field for “Other” will be use d to document any other reason for  glaucoma 
medication discontinuation.  
F. Another potential r eason for intervention is an IOP below 6m mHg (hypotony).  
Interventions such as those indicated below should only be cons idered if the 
hypotony has caused or is likely to cause sequelae such as a fl at chamber. No 
intervention is indicated when t he vision is unchanged from scr eening, there is no 
persistent choroidal detachment, the anterior chamber is not fl at with lens corneal 
                                                          Page  39 of 84                         INN-005 Rev.  072117 
 touch, or the patient is asymptom atic.  No inter vention should be undertaken for 
hypotony which is not causing, or t hreatening to cause, a reduc tion in vision, as 
the intervention might cause pro cedure failure.  These interven tions should be 
documented as adverse events .  Otherwise, the hypotony should b e monitored 
with additional follow-ups as necessary.   
 
1) Too loose or not enough sutures ca n result in hypotony that may  be treated by 
[CONTACT_350521] a separat e surgical intervention (this a ction will be 
considered a failure).  
 
2)   Introduction of visco elastic into the anterior chamber for  the purpose of 
slowing aqueous flow and eli minating hypotony that is causing a  reduction of 
best corrected visual acuity (tw o or more lines) or causing the  presence of 
persistent choroidal detachment  (3 or more months  if peripheral , up to one 
month if kissing), or causing hypot ony maculopathy (also docume nted as a 
complication on the Adve rse Event form.) 
 G.
  A secondary procedure that is pe rformed including a trabeculect omy, 
repositioning of a InnFocus Mic roShunt, Tenon’s resection, glau coma laser, 
glaucoma drainage device or other incisional treatment to estab lish a new aqueous 
flow path from the anterior cha mber in order to maintain accept able IOPs will be 
considered a failure of the original procedure. 
 H.  If the InnFocus MicroShunt is repositioned, removed and/or replaced with 
another type of device based on t he device performance, the con junctiva should 
be cut at the limbus in a similar manner to the original proced ure.  The device 
should be exposed and the repos itioning or removal conducted.  If the device is 
removed, verify that there is  no aqueous leakage from the track .  If there is, use a 
Vicryl suture to seal the tr ack.  The limbus should then be res utured in a similar 
manner as the original surger y.  The removed InnFocus MicroShun t should be 
returned to InnFocus, Inc. for a nalysis in accordance with the explanted device 
procedure. 
  If the InnFocus MicroShunt is removed, another InnFocus MicroS hunt should not 
be implanted in the same subjec t.  Use an alternate procedure. 
 
If repositioning, removal, repla cement or removal with another glaucoma 
procedure occurs, the event wil l result in the subject being fo llowed according to 
standard of care until the adverse event resolves and the follo w-up visits over the 
two years period under the protocol  schedule will be part of th e safety analyses.  
Any extra visits to evaluate the  patient due to the secondary p rocedure will be 
considered “Unscheduled Visits” if  performed outside of the sta ndard visit 
windows in the protocol and the Uns cheduled Visit form will be used to 
document the visit.  
I.  For any surgery or interventi ons not directly related to th e subject’s glaucoma that 
occur during the study, e.g., catar act surgery, the standard of  care for the 
particular type of interventi on will be followed until the subj ect has recovered.  
                                                          Page  [ADDRESS_435630] protoco l follow-up visit, 
the visits will be handled as “Uns cheduled Visits” and the Unsc heduled Visit 
form will be used to doc ument the visit.

the Adverse Event Form.  Conditi ons which exist at the time the  subject is enrolled do not 
need to be recorded on the Adverse Event Form as adverse events  unless they increase in 
severity during the study.  Anticipated Adverse Events 
Anticipated adverse events incl ude those that might reasonably be expected to occur in this 
study because they are associate d with glaucoma, glaucoma surge ry, and/or prior cataract 
surgical procedures.    Specific examples of anticipate d adverse events include hypoton y, increased intraocular 
pressure requiring medical or  surgical intervention and decreas e of BCVA. Increased 
intraocular pressure will be considered an adverse event if a s ubject has an IOP higher than 
the preoperative medicated scree ning pressure or 21mmHg, whiche ver is lower.  At this 
IOP level, the investigator will intervene either physically or  with the addition of glaucoma 
medication.  There may also be cas es where intervention for inc reased IOP is done at a 
lower IOP level than stated a bove because of oth er patient-rela ted factors; these will also 
be adverse events. BCVA decreas es of [ADDRESS_435641] visits after the 3-month follow-up visits unless 
surgical or medical interventi on is required.  (Note:  a loss o f BCVA in conjunction with 
posterior capsular opacificati on, followed by [CONTACT_350529]:YAG capsulotom y and improvement of 
BCVA, is not considered an adverse event.)

 APPENDIX 1 
1.0 Background on POAG, Management, and Rationale for the 
Study  
 
1.1 Background on Primary Open Angle Glaucoma 
 The following summary in this section has been excerpted from t he American Academy of 
Ophthalmology Preferred Practice Patterns for Primary Open Angl e Glaucoma, October, 
2010.  Additional information and specific literature reference s can be obtained by [CONTACT_350537]: http://one.aao.org/ce/practice guidelines/ppp_content.aspx?cid=[ADDRESS_435648]  open-angle glaucoma (OAG).  Gl aucoma (both open-
angle and angle-closure) is the  second leading cause of blindne ss worldwide, with 
approximately 8.4 million people b lind from glaucoma.  Overall in 2004, the prevalence of 
POAG for adults 40 and older in the  [LOCATION_002] was estimated  to be about 2%.  Open-
angle glaucoma affects an estim ated 2.[ADDRESS_435649] in the preva lence of glaucoma among different  ethnic groups. Overall, 
there appears to be a threefol d higher prevalence of OAG in Afr ican Americans relative to 
non-Hispanic Whites in the Unite d States.  It is also the leadi ng cause of blindness in 
African Americans. Further, the  prevalence of OAG is even highe r in Afro-Caribbeans 
relative to African Americans. R ecent evidence on Hispanics/Lat inos suggests that they 
have high prevalence rates of OAG that are comparable to Africa n Americans.  There are 
no data on the prevalence of OAG in A sians in the [LOCATION_002] . 
RISK FACTORS 
The findings of epi[INVESTIGATOR_350470] a framework for 
assessing the risk factors asso ciated with POAG. The important risk factors associated with 
POAG are as follows: 
 Intraocular pressure level 
 Older age 
 Family histor y of glaucoma 
 African ancestry or Lati no/Hispanic ethnicity 
 Thinner central cornea 
 Low ocular perfusion pressures 
 Type 2 diabetes mellitus 
 Myopia 
 Genetic mutations  
                                                          Page  [ADDRESS_435650] a  greater IOP fluctuation may be at increased risk of 
progression, although this has not  been shown consistently.  
In spi[INVESTIGATOR_350471],  there is great inter-
individual variation in the sus ceptibility of the optic nerve t o IOP-related damage. 
Population-based studies indica te that a variable proportion of  patients with IOP greater 
than 21 mmHg (Northern Italy [13%] , Los Angeles [18%], Arizona [20%], Blue Mountains 
[25%], Melbourne [39%], Baltimo re [45%], Rotterd am [61%], Barba dos [71%]) have 
glaucomatous optic nerve damage .  This suggests that an IOP lev el of greater than 21 
mmHg is an arbitrarily defined  level and highlights the poor va lue of utilizing a specific 
IOP cutoff as a measure for screening and diagnosing POAG. 
Age 
Older age is another important r isk factor for the presence of POAG.   A number of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_350472] , particularly among i ndividuals of Latino /Hispanic and African 
descent (see Table 1, Figures  1 and 4). African Americans 73 to  74 years old and 75 and 
older had a prevalence of 5.7%  and 23.2%, respectively. Similar ly, the prevalence of OAG 
was 3.4% for white individua ls 73 and 74 years old and 9.4% for  those [ADDRESS_435651]-degree relative (siblin g or parent) with medically 
confirmed POAG.  Other studies i n which family members were not  physically examined 
depend on patient reports of the sta tus of family members, and these are known to be 
subject to several biases. None theless, they support the concep t that first degree relatives of 
those with OAG are at greater ris k. For example, in the Baltimo re Eye Survey and the Los 
Angeles Latino Eye Study (LALES) , for individuals with POAG the  odds were twice as 
high (1.92 and 2.85, respectively) of reporting a first-degree relative (parent, child, or 
sibling) with glaucoma compa red with individuals who did not ha ve glaucoma. However, 
the odds increased to over three times as high if they reported  that they had a sibling with 
glaucoma (LALES 3.47, Baltimore 3. 7). Interestingly, the odds r ose to fivefold higher if 
there were two or more siblin gs who were reported to have a his tory of glaucoma. 
Race or Ethnicity 
For POAG, ethnicity is an impor tant risk factor. The prevalence  of POAG is higher in 
individuals of West African, Afro-Caribbea n, or Latino/Hispanic  origin than of other 
groups. The prevalence is three times higher in African America ns and Hispanics of 
Mexican ancestry compared with no n-Hispanic Whites. Blindness f rom glaucoma is at 
least six times more prevalent i n African Americans than in Cau casian Americans.

 Central Corneal Thickness  
Because applanation tonometry measurements are derived from res istance to corneal 
indentation and corneal stiffness , differences in central corne al thickness (CCT) may 
introduce artifacts in IOP measur ement. The mean CCT in healthy  human eyes varies by 
[CONTACT_545]/ethnicity. The average CCT  measured ultrasonically in Cauc asian Americans is [ADDRESS_435652] has yet been fully 
validated.  
A thinner central cornea has b een reported as an independent ri sk factor (independent of 
IOP) associated with POAG, though not  in all studies. In LALES,  the risk of having OAG 
was higher in persons with thinn er CCT compared with those with  normal or thicker CCT 
even after adjusting the IOP.  S tudies show that differences in  corneal biomechanics across 
individuals may have a greater i mpact on IOP measurement errors  than CCT.  
Low Ocular Perfusion Pressure  
Ocular perfusion pressure is th e difference between blood press ure (at systole or diastole) 
and the IOP. It has been hypothesi zed that low oc ular perfusion  pressures lead to alterations 
in blood flow at the optic nerve  head and contribute to progres sive glaucomatous optic 
nerve damage. Population-based stu dies in African Americans, Hi spanics, and non-
Hispanic Whites have provided evi dence that low diastolic perfu sion pressure (<50 mmHg) 
is associated with a higher prev alence of POAG.  In addition, i n the Early Manifest 
Glaucoma Treatment Study, low s ystolic perfusion pressure (≤125  mmHg) was associated 
with a higher risk of glaucoma  progression (relative risk of 1. 42) over an 8-year period.  
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 
While there are some conflic ting data on the association betwee n type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(type 2 DM) and POAG, there is in creasing evidence from populat ion-based studies 
suggesting that type 2 DM is an i mportant risk factor for POAG.   Population-based 
assessments of Hispanics (in L os Angeles, [LOCATION_004]), non-Hisp anic Whites (in Beaver 
Dam, Wisconsin and Blue Mountai ns, Australia), and a large coho rt enrolled in the Nurses 
Health Study have shown that pers ons with type 2 DM are more li kely (40% higher odds in 
Hispanics, twofold higher odds in n on-Hispanic Whites) to have POAG. Further, in the 
LALES, longer duration of type [ADDRESS_435653] provided evidence of a n independent relationship bet ween longer axial length 
(axial myopia) and a higher pr evalence of OAG.  The underlying hypothesis is that 
individuals with axial myopia ha ve weaker scleral support at th e optic nerve, and this 
contributes to a greater suscep tibility of the optic nerve to g laucomatous damage. 
Genetic Factors  
The first gene to be linked t o POAG was the myocilin gene ( MYOC)  on chromosome 1 .  In 
one study, 3% to 4% of cases w ith POAG were found to have mutat ions in the myocilin 
gene.  Several chromosomal regi ons have now been linked to POAG  and additional genes 
identified.  However, a major ity of the cases with POAG do not have an identified genetic 
abnormality, suggesting that glau comatous optic nerve damage ma y be multifactorial in its 
development, with different genes modifying the impact of vario us factors such as age, 
IOP, and blood flow. 
Other Factors 
In addition, migraine headache a nd peripheral vasospasm have be en identified as risk 
factors for glaucomatous optic  nerve damage.  The association b etween POAG and factors 
such as concurrent cardiovascul ar disease and systemic hyperten sion has not been 
demonstrated consistently.  
1.2. Management of Primary Open Angle Glaucoma 
 
Goals  
The goals of managing patients w ith POAG are to achieve the fol lowing: 
 Controlled IOP in the target range 
 Stable optic nerve/retinal ne rve fiber layer status 
 Stable visual fields 
 
Because elevated IOP is a treata ble cause of POAG damage, one c an expect to reduce the 
risk of disease progression in ma ny patients by [CONTACT_350538] P by [CONTACT_350539], 
laser therapy, or incisional glau coma surgery. Results from ran domized controlled trials 
and other studies reinforce this  expectation and provide eviden ce that the more the IOP is 
lowered, the more likely is it t o slow the rate of progression of POAG. 
  Management is a challenge for  the patient and the doctor, beca use POAG is a chronic, 
often asymptomatic, condition that  may require frequent use of multiple and expensive 
medications
181 that may cause side effects or m ay require laser or incisional  surgery. The 
effects of treatment, the patient's quality of life, and the pa tient's life expectancy are 
important to consider when choos ing therapy. The diagnosis, sev erity of the disease, 
prognosis and management plan, a nd likelihood of long-term ther apy should be discussed 
with the patient.  Subs tantial field loss i n glaucoma is associ ated with a decrease in quality 
of life measures.  Target Intraocular Pressure for Patients with POAG  
The goal of glaucoma treatment is to maintain the IOP in a rang e at which a patient is 
likely to remain stable or at which worsening of glaucoma will be slow enough that the risk 
                                                          Page  59 of 84                         INN-005 Rev.  072117 
 of additional intervention is  not justified.  The estimated upp er limit of this range is 
considered the "target pressure."  The initial target pressure i s an estimate and a means 
toward the ultimate goal of prot ecting the patient's vision. Th e target pressure should be 
individualized and may need adjus tment during the course of the  disease. 
  When initiating therapy, the ophtha lmologist assumes that the m easured pretreatment 
pressure range contributed to opt ic nerve damage and is likely to cause additional damage 
in the future. Lowering the pr etreatment IOP by 25% or more has  been shown to inhibit 
progression of POAG.  It is reasona ble to select an initial tar get pressure at least 25% lower 
than pretreatment levels. Choosi ng an even lower target IOP can  be justified i f there is 
more severe optic nerv e damage, if the dama ge is progressing ra pi[INVESTIGATOR_375], or if other risk 
factors such as family histor y, age, or disc hemorrhages are pr esent  
 Choosing a less aggressive targe t IOP may be reasonable if the risks of aggressive 
treatment outweigh the benefits (e.g., if a patient does not to lerate medical therapy well and 
surgical intervention would be di fficult or if the patient's li fe expectancy is short). In a 
study of newly diagnosed patients w ith moderate to advanced gla ucoma, a subset of 
patients randomized to initial  lowering of IOP by [CONTACT_350540] b etter than those assigned to 
medical treatment over an 8-y ear period, and this could be due to the lower mean post-
treatment IOP in the surgery group.   The adequacy and validity of the  target pressure are periodica lly reassessed by [CONTACT_350541] (by [CONTACT_350542], quan titative asse ssments of the disc and nerve 
fiber layer, and visual field tes ts) with previous examinations . If progressi on occurs at the 
target pressure, undetected IOP f luctuations and adherence to t herapy can be re-evaluated 
before adjusting the target IOP . However, target pressure is an  estimate, and all treatment 
decisions must be individualize d according to the needs of the patient. 
 Therapeutic Choices  
The IOP can be lowered by [CONTACT_350543], laser therapy, or incisional glaucoma 
surgery (alone or in combination) . The choice of initial therap y depends on numerous 
considerations, and discussion of t reatment with the patient sh ould include the relative risks 
and benefits of the three options.  Medical treatment  
Unless contraindicated, medical therapy is presently the most c ommon initial intervention 
to lower IOP. There are many drugs  available for initial therap y, and medication choice 
may be influenced by [CONTACT_350544], side effects, and dosing s chedules Patient adherence to 
therapy is enhanced by [CONTACT_350545]. If target IOP is not achie ved by [CONTACT_350546], then 
additional separate medications , combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or swit ching of treatments may be 
considered to reach the target IOP.   Prostaglandin analogs and beta-b lockers are the most frequently  used initial eye drops for 
lowering IOP in patients with glau coma. Prostaglandin analogs a re the most effective drugs 
at lowering IOP and can be consider ed as initial medical therap y unless other 
                                                          Page  [ADDRESS_435654] should consid er the balance between side ef fects and effectiveness in 
choosing a regimen of maximal effe ctiveness and to lerance to ac hieve the desired IOP 
reduction for each patient. Frequent dosing and side effects (s uch as depression, exercise 
intolerance, and impotence with t opi[INVESTIGATOR_350473]-blockers) may affe ct adherence to therapy. 
 Adequate treatment of glaucoma re quires a high level of adheren ce to therapy. Frequently 
this is not achieved; studies i ndicate relatively poor adherenc e to therapy.  Even with 
instruction, free medication, on ce-daily administration, use of  a dosing aid, and electronic 
monitoring of adherence, nearl y 45% of patients in one study to ok fewer than 75% of their 
prescribed doses.  Instilling eyedr ops correctly is difficult f or patients, and their ability to 
do so may worsen as glaucoma prog resses. Repeated instruction a nd counseling in proper 
techniques for using medication a s well as a clearly written me dication regimen and 
follow-up telephone calls may imp rove adherence to therapy.  
 Laser trabeculoplasty  
Laser trabeculoplasty can be cons idered as initial therapy in s elected patients or an 
alternative for patients who cannot or will not use medications  reliably due to cost, memory 
problems, difficulty with instil lation, or intol erance to the m edication. Laser 
trabeculoplasty lowers IOP by [CONTACT_350547], diode, and frequency-doubled YAG lasers.  
Argon and diode laser trabeculoplasty  
Studies using continuous-wave arg on laser with a wavelength spe ctrum that peaks at 488 
nm (argon laser trabeculoplasty  [ALT]) found that treatment inc reases aqueous outflow and 
provides a clinically signifi cant reduction of IOP in more than  75% of initial treatments of 
previously unoperated eyes.  Since these initial s tudies, more compact solid-state diode 
lasers have mostly replaced the o riginal argon laser with equal  IOP lowering efficacy. 
For patients initially treated w ith ALT, the amount of medical treatment required for 
glaucoma control is reduced.  Res ults from long-term studies of  patients receiving 
maximum medical therapy who subse quently had laser and incision al surgery indicate that 
30% to more than 50% of eyes requi re additional surgical treatm ent within [ADDRESS_435655] failed t o maintain a previously adequa te response, repeat ALT has 
a low long-term rate of succe ss, with failure occurring in near ly 90% of these eyes by [ADDRESS_435656] y, there is an increased risk of problems a nd complications such as IOP 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_350474].  Selective laser trabeculoplasty  
The introduction of se lective laser trabecu loplasty (SLT) is mo st likely responsible for the 
increase in use of laser trab eculoplasty in 2001 after a previo us decline. Selective laser 
                                                          Page  61 of 84                         INN-005 Rev.  072117 
 trabeculoplasty uses a Q-sw itched, frequency doubled, 532 nm Nd :YAG laser that delivers 
less energy and is purported t o be selectively absorbed by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_350475]. These attributes appe ar purportedly to produce less t hermal damage to the 
trabecular meshwork compared wit h ALT.  However, several prospe ctive and retrospective 
studies indicate that SLT app ears comparable  to but not better than ALT in lowering IOP. 
Selective laser trabeculoplasty  also appears to be comparable i n efficacy to medical therapy 
with prostaglandin analogs, a lthough in one prospective study, SLT was only comparable 
to latanoprost when [ADDRESS_435657] been noted after SLT in 4.5% to 27% 
of eyes in various studies.  Incisional glaucoma surgery Trabeculectomy  
Filtering surgery is effective i n lowering IOP; it is generally  indicated when medicine or 
laser therapy is insu fficient to control disease and can be con sidered in selected cases as 
initial therapy.   Filtering surgery provides an alternative path for the escape o f aqueous humor, and it often 
reduces IOP and the need for medic al treatment. Estimates of su ccess rates over time range 
from 31% to 56% in diff erent populations. The  failure rate of f iltering surgery, without the 
use of adjunctive antifibrotic m edications, alone  or combined w ith medical therapy in a 
previously unoperated eye in the A dvanced Glaucoma Intervention  Study reached 
approximately 30% in African Ame rican patients and 20% in Cauca sian American patients 
over a 10-year period. While long-te rm control is often achieve d, many patients may 
require further therapy or a reope ration, which carries a highe r failure rate. Furthermore, 
filtering surgery increases the  likelihood that phakic eyes may  undergo cataract surgery. In 
eyes that have undergone previous  cataract surge ry involving th e conjunctiva, the success 
rate of initial glaucoma  surgery is reduced.  
 
Antifibrotic agents may be use d intraoperatively and postoperat ively to reduce the 
subconjunctival scarring after f iltration surgery that can resu lt in failure of the operation. 
The use of intraoperative mitomyc in-C reduces the risk of surgi cal failure both in eyes at 
high risk of surgical failure a nd in eyes that have not undergo ne previous surgery. Some 
studies have demonstrated a bene fit of intraoperative 5-fluorou racil and others have not. 
                                                          Page  [ADDRESS_435658] the benefits when deciding whether or not to 
use these agents. These compli cations may be e ven more common i n primary filtering 
surgery of phakic patients.   Aqueous shunts  
All commercialized aqueous s hunts (also known as tube shunts, g laucoma drainage 
devices, and setons) consist of  a tube that diverts aqueous hum or to an end plate located in 
the equatorial region of the eye . The primary resistance to flo w through these devices 
occurs across the fibrous capsu le that develops around the end plate. Aqueous shunts differ 
in their design with respect to th e size, shape, and material f rom which the end plate is 
made. They may be further subdi vided into valved and non-valved  shunts, depending on 
whether or not a valve mechanism is present to limit flow throu gh the shunt if the IOP 
becomes too low. Examples of non -valved implants are the Baerve ldt glaucoma implant 
(Abbott Medical Optics, Santa A na, CA) and the Molteno implant (Molteno Ophthalmic 
Ltd., Dunedin, New Zealand). Example s of the valved implants ar e the Ahmed glaucoma 
valve (New World Medical, Inc ., Rancho Cucamonga, CA) and the K rupin implant (Eagle 
Vision, Inc., Memphis, TN).  Aqueous shunts have traditionally been used to manage medically  uncontrolled glaucoma 
when trabeculectomy has failed to control IOP or is deemed unli kely to succeed. This 
includes eyes with neovascular g laucoma, uveitic glaucoma, exte nsive conjunctival 
scarring from previous ocular surgery or cicatrizing diseases o f the conjunctiva, and 
congenital glaucoma in which angl e surgery has failed. However,  the indications for using 
aqueous shunts have been broadeni ng, and these devices are bein g increasingly utilized in 
the surgical management of glaucoma. Medicare data show a stead y rise in the number of 
shunts placed from [ADDRESS_435659] udy observed a higher 5-year succe ss rate after trabeculectomy 
with mitomycin-C than with Ahm ed glaucoma valve implantation. A  randomized clinical

 trial in Sri Lanka comparing the  Ahmed implant and trabeculecto my in patients with 
primary open-angle and angle-closure glaucoma found comparable IOP reduction and 
success rates with a mean follo w-up of 31 months. The Tube Vers us Trabeculectomy 
(TVT) Study is a multic enter, prospective, r andomized clinical trial that compared the 
safety and efficacy of tube-shunt  surgery using the 350-mm2 Bae rveldt glaucoma implant 
and trabeculectomy with mitomycin-C in patients with previous c ataract extraction and/or 
failed trabeculectomy. Tube-shunt  surgery had a higher success rate than trabeculectomy 
(85% vs. 69%) after 3 years of f ollow-up as defined by [CONTACT_350548], and/or IOP less than 
or equal to 5 mmHg or g reater than or equa l to 21 mmHg. Both su rgical procedures were 
associated with similar IOP r eduction and use of supplemental m edical therapy at 3 years.  
Postoperative complications occurr ed more frequently after trab eculectomy compared with 
tube-shunt surgery, but the rate of  serious complications assoc iated with vision loss and/or 
reoperation to manage the compli cation was similar with both pr ocedures. 
 Aqueous shunts are associated w ith intraoperative and postopera tive complications that are 
similar to those that occur with trabeculectomy. In addition, t hey have unique 
complications related to impla ntation of a foreign body. Erosio n of the tube may occur 
through the conjunctiva, and this typi[INVESTIGATOR_350476] a few mill imeters behind the limbus 
following anterior chamber ins ertion. Diplopia may result from extraocular muscle fibrosis 
or a mass effect of the bleb ove rlying the end plate. Tube-corn ea touch can lead to 
progressive endothelial cell loss and persistent corneal edema.  The risk of postoperative 
infection appears to be less wit h aqueous shunts than after tra beculectomy with an 
antifibrotic agent.  Other glaucoma surgeries  
Nonpenetrating glaucoma surgery i s an alternative to trabeculec tomy. The precise role of 
nonpenetrating surgery in the sur gical management of glaucoma r emains to be determined. 
The two main types of nonpenetra ting glaucoma surgery are visco canalostomy and 
nonpenetrating deep sclerectomy. T he rationale for nonpenetrati ng glaucoma surgery is that 
by [CONTACT_3726] a continuous passagewa y from the anterior chamber t o the subconjunctival 
space, the incidence of complicat ions such as bleb-related prob lems and hypotony can be 
reduced. The nonpenetrating procedur es have a higher degree of surgical difficulty 
compared with trabeculectomy and require special instrumentatio n. Randomized clinical 
trials comparing viscocanalostomy  with trabeculectomy generally  suggest greater IOP 
reduction with trabeculectomy, but more complications with visc ocanalostomy.  
One randomized clinical trial f ound that trabeculectomy was mor e effective than 
nonpenetrating deep sclerectomy a t lowering IOP, and several ot hers found that the two 
surgeries were e qually effective. 
  Other glaucoma surgica l procedures currently in use are canalop lasty with a tensioning 
suture (Prolene [Ethicon Inc., S omerville, NJ]), ab interno tra beculotomy using the 
Trabectome (NeoMedix, Tustin, CA) , trabecular meshwork by[CONTACT_6476] s tent (i-Stent, Glaukos 
Corp., Laguna Hills, CA) and the Ex-PRESS mini glaucoma shunt ( Alcon Laboratories, 
Inc., Ft. Worth, TX).

Nd:YAG laser, and transscleral and noncontact [CONTACT_350549] c yclophotocoagulation. 
 Cyclodestructive procedures have traditionally been used for re fractory glaucomas, and 
success rates have been reporte d in the range of 34% to 94%. Th ey have been associated 
with a subsequent decrease of vi sual acuity and, rarely, cases of sympathetic ophthalmia.  
Disadvantages of cyclodestructiv e procedures include postoperat ive inflammation, IOP 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531], and the frequen t need for repeat tr eatment weeks or mont hs later.  Compared with 
cyclocryotherapy, laser cyclophot ocoagulation causes less posto perative pain and 
inflammation. Therefore, cyclocr yotherapy is now rarely used. L aser cyclodestructive 
procedures have advantages over filtration surgery that include  technical ease and reduced 
postoperative care.  In 2005, 47% of all Medicare cyclo photocoagulation procedures w ere performed

consists of a solid-state 810-nm  laser, a video camera, aiming beam, and a xenon light 
source housed together in a fiber optic cable that can be introd uced inside the eye for direct 
visualization and treatment of t he ciliary processes. Theoretic ally, this allows better 
titration of laser treatment. The  efficacy of ECP appears to be  good, with IOP reduction 
reported in the range of 34% to 57% .  It appears that treating [ADDRESS_435661] was conducted for a 5 year  equivalent timeframe at two  temperatures, 
85±2°C and 100±2°C, for 20 and 57 days, respectively.  No signi ficant weight 
loss was observed.  The bond stren gth of the tube to the fins o f the device did not 
change from the hydrolysis.   Aft er incubation, each recovered sample group was 
evaluated for changes in appear ance relative to un-aged samples . SEM at 500x 
magnification and optical microsc opy at magnifications of 20x a nd 30x were 
both applied and no significant chan ges were detected with eith er imaging 
method.  No significant analytes w ere detected in the hydrolysa tes from either 
incubation. These methods consiste ntly demonstrated the chemica l hydrolytic 
stability of the poly(styrene-b-is obutylene-b-styrene) thermopl astic hydrophobic 
elastomer (SIBS) from which the device is made.  
2.1.2 Pressure/Flow Characteristics 
Studies were conducted to verif y that the [ADDRESS_435662] 2 microliters/minute of flow at 6mmHg pressure.  
2.1.[ADDRESS_435663] sterilization to verify th e fusion was 
adequate. All bonds met the speci fication of >50gra ms or >0.5Ne wtons.  An 
overall average increase i n bond strength of 11.2% was observed  after 
sterilization. 
 2.1.[ADDRESS_435664] facsimiles, over three lots tested, displayed an avera ge weight loss of 
approximately 0.2%.  The overall sensitivity level of the chrom atographic and 
spectroscopic methods applied in this study was approximately [ADDRESS_435665] ed.  There were 
no significant differences in the  extractable fractions of the three different lots 
tested.  Leachable Testing 
This study quantified and ident ified the aqueous and lipophilic  leachable 
fractions for the InnFocus Micro Shunt.  Samples were incubated at a temperature 
of 35+2oC for 72+2h in both aqueous and li pophilic solvents. Extraction s in 
these two solvents cover the po ssible polarity ran ge that the i mplant could be 
exposed to in the intraocular e nvironment. HPLC-grade isopropyl  alcohol (IPA) 
was used as the lipophilic solvent  and HPLC-grade water was use d as the 
aqueous solvent.  The leachates  from test and c ontrol extractio ns were analyzed 
spectroscopi[INVESTIGATOR_350477]/VIS sp ectrophotometry and chromatogr aphically 
using HPLC/PDA (photodiode array UV detection), GC/FID (flame i onization 
detection), and GC/MS techniques.  
 
Low molecular weight siloxanes , ethylene glycol, benzophenone, 2-
phenylphenol, and a low molecular weight alkyl polyol were dete cted in the 
lipophilic leachates at very low c oncentrations. These are rela ted to the 
packaging materials and the ste rilization process.  Glycerin, w hich is applied to 
the device to improve handling, was in the leachate at a concen tration of 0.5-0.6 
weight%.  Only the water-solub le compounds, glycerin, ethylene glycol, and the 
alkyl polyol, were detected in t he aqueous leachates.  None of these was 
considered to be significant a nd do not impact the biocompatibi lity of the device. 
 Insoluble Inorganics Analysis of InnFocus MicroShunt product 
Because the processes used to manufacture the InnFocus MicroShu nt involve 
contact [CONTACT_350550] t, three lots of the sterilized I nnFocus MicroShunt 
were sent for inductive couple d plasma/mass spectrophotometry a nalysis for 
metallic content.  The  data indicated that there is a low level  of metallic 
contaminants from the manufactu ring processes.  None of the lev els of the 
contaminants is near or above a ny known toxic levels for the pa rticular 
inorganics observed.  Additionally, the biocompatibility tests separately 
conducted by [CONTACT_350551].  Those samples passe d all of the biocompatibility te sts as will be

Biocompatibility tests were conduc ted on SIBS polymer samples t hat had been 
processed through simulated InnF ocus MicroShunt manufacturing s teps.  The 
SIBS used for the testing included an additive to aid in manufa cturing processing. 
After EtO sterilizati on, the samples were s ent to an outside la boratory for a series

2.1.11 Animal and clinical studies  on prior InnFocus MicroShunt  prototypes 
 A series of chronic ocular impla ntation rabbit studies were con ducted to evaluate 
the safety of InnFocus glaucoma d rainage device prototypes.  Th ese studies were 
conducted on various internal diam eter and external diameter tu bes.  In some 
prototypes, a tab lo cated on one side of the tube was present.  In one study, a 
small SIBS plate was attached t o the distal end of the device.  
 The chronic ocular implantation studies c onsisted of device imp lantation and 
follow-ups at 1 and 7 days, 4 weeks, and 3 and 6 months during which the 
rabbits were examined by [CONTACT_350552] p for healing characteristics and IOP was 
measured.  At the end of each s tudy, histology was conducted on  explanted 
devices and surrounding tissue to e valuate the healing response .   In all of these 
studies, the prototypes  demonstrated excelle nt biocompatibility .   
 Clinical feasibility studies w ere conducted in [LOCATION_009] and Domin ican Republic.  
Each of these studies had one y ear follow-up.  Based on the out come of these 
studies on prior prototypes which i dentified speci fic safety an d functional 
improvements as well as provi ding confirmation of many design c omponents, 
the final InnFocus MicroShunt G laucoma Drainage System design w as 
established and additional clini cal studies initiated that are described below.   
 
2.1.12  Ongoing InnFocus MicroSh unt Clinical Studies 
    Dominican Republic S tudy (Protocol INN-003) 
The first study which utilizes t he present design of the InnFoc us MicroShunt 
(formerly called the MIDI Arro w) study was initiated in Santo D omingo, 
Dominican Republic in 2010.  Twenty- three (23) subjects were en rolled.  The 
patients averaged 59.8+15.3 year s of age, IOP of 24.0+5.4 mmHg and 2.2+0.[ADDRESS_435667] 
to follow-up after 12 months follow-up.  The definition of succ ess in the study 
was based on >20% drop in IOP a nd IOP < 21mmHg with or without glaucoma 
medication usage.  At 12 months follow-up, the success rate was  100% with an 
average IOP decrease of 55.4%.  T he mean IOP for the InnFocus M icroShunt 
only cases at 12 months was 11.3 ± 2.9 mmHg, and 9.7 ± 2.[ADDRESS_435668] cases.  Glaucoma meds  usage for 
the total group at 12 months was an average of 0.3 meds/patient  with only 3 
patients requiring any glaucoma m edications. At two years, the success rate was 
87% with an average IOP drop of 49 .1%.  The mean IOP at 2 years  was 12.2 ± 
3.9 mmHg for the InnFocus Micro Shunt only cases (9) and 12.1 ± 4.4 mmHg for 
the combined group (6).  Glaucoma meds usage for the total grou p at 24 months 
was an average of 0.5 meds/pa tient with only 3 patients on any glaucoma 
medications.  Of the three fail ures at 24 months, 2 failures we re due the subjects 
only having an IOP decrease of 19 % and 1%.  The third failure w as due to 
increased IOP, which resulted i n the need for another glaucoma surgery. 
 
Complications of specific intere st in the study are summarized below and a table 
presenting all complications  is on the following page. 
 Intra-operative adverse events :  There was one intra-operative adverse event that 
occurred when the tip of the InnF ocus MicroShunt tube in the an terior chamber was 
observed to have blood and fibrin on it.  A paracentesis was ma de and the tip was flushed 
with balanced sterile saline to s uccessfully clear the tip of b lood.  A bleb was not present 
at [ADDRESS_435669]-operative Adverse Events:  There were a total of [ADDRESS_435670] common ev ent was transient acute 
hypotony where all cases cleared up spontaneously without inter vention.  Hypotony was 
defined as <6mmHg in the study.  T he historical data from the l iterature has used either 
<6mmHg or <5mmHg as a li mit. Also the historical data is variab le on when to start 
reporting hypotony, i.e., at Da y 1, Day [ADDRESS_435671] from <6 mmHg, special mention is given t o the data as to the 
extent of lower pressure.

 In the combined surgery group, the re were [ADDRESS_435674] surgery.  A ll of these resolved spontane ously or were treated 
successfully.   There were two cases of eleva ted IOP that required physical int ervention.  In one 
combined surgery case with eleva ted IOP, the anterior chamber w as “burped” with the 
use of a 27G needle on Day [ADDRESS_435675]  blocked the InnFocus MicroSh unt tube temporarily 
until the fibrin resorbed.  The second elevated IOP case result ed in needling of a cystic 
bleb at the slit lamp on Day 90, whe rein the pressure returned to the prior reduced level. 
Both of these adverse events are  considered seve re and are deno ted with an “S” in Table 
6.  There were 3 cases of increased I OP that were treated with glau coma medication. 
  
One exposed Tenon’s capsule was observed at Day [ADDRESS_435676] surgery in a patient with thin 
conjunctiva and was resolved by D ay 21 without intervention.  A  second potential 
exposed Tenon’s capsule was re ported in a subject approximately  [ADDRESS_435677]

 conjunctiva was clearly observe d over the Tenon’s capsule withi n the next 3 months with 
no other issues or a ction taken. 
 There was one bleb leak not rel ated to the device that resolved  within 2 weeks.   
 Additional visual field loss  of >2.5dB in mean deviation (MD) w as classified as an 
adverse event and was based on t he latest follow-up of subjects  with measurable visual 
fields.  At 12 months for 6 patie nts, 0 of the 6 had additional  VF loss of >2.5dB.  At the 
latest follow-up of 24 months f or 10 patients, 2 of 10 had addi tional VF loss of >2.5dB. 
 One patient with a baseline MD of -19.2dB had additional loss o f 12.2dB at 2 years 
follow-up with no bleb and an IOP of 19mmHg.  Based on the exca vation of the optic 
nerve (C:D=0.9) and the continui ng excellent visual acuity of 2 0/20, the subject was 
scheduled for surgery to minimize further optic nerve damage an d was put on [ADDRESS_435678] had a n IOP of 11.5mmHg with a bleb pres ent and visual acuity of

 (REP-INF-0152-00 is in Volume 8; Briefcase summaries are in REP -INF-0153-00)  
 
An additional clinical trial of t he InnFocus MicroShunt implant  is being conducted in 
Bordeaux, [LOCATION_009] under the directio n of [CONTACT_350557] .  The subjects for the 
study are inadequately controlle d on maximum tole rated medical therapy with intraocular 
pressures >18mmHg to < 40mmHg.  The subjects had no prior incis ional ophthalmic 
surgery other than uncomplicated  cataract surgery.  There are 3 7 eyes in the study of a

 Adverse events related to the t reated eye in the study as well as those outside the study 
are summarized below for the 41 eyes: 
 
There was one case of correctiv e surgery due to the InnFocus Mi croShunt being 
dislodged during closure of the  conjunctiva without being notic ed by [CONTACT_11065].  Upon 
observing an IOP of 26mmHg, the n ext day the surgeon observed t hat the tip of the 
device was not in the anterior ch amber.  Review of the video sh owed that the device was 
dislodged by [CONTACT_350553] c onjunctiva was pulled forward to suture.  Because of the 
presence of blood, the surgeon di d not observe this.  One week after the original 
procedure, a new procedure was successfully performed to place the same device back 
into the anterior chamber w ith flow observed through the device  prior to conjunctival 
closure.  The patient responded w ell initially and at 12 months  follow-up, the IOP was 
19mmHg with one glauco ma medication. 
 Hypotony was observed infrequently with a total of 3 eyes with transient hypotony for an 
overall rate of 7.3%, and all we re resolved by [CONTACT_941] 3 week follo w-up. 
 Increased IOP was observed in a total of 17 eyes with 12 of the se having one or more 
needling procedures with glaucoma  medication and the remaining 5 eyes having 
glaucoma medications only.  N eedling was conducted in all cases  except one with the use 
of MMC; the one exception was with  the use of Healaflow (viscoe lastic).  Three eyes had 
over 3 needlings performed (7, 4, 4);  the IOP in two of these e yes was brought back into 
control with IOPs at one year  of 7mmHg and 13mmHg and the third  remained high at 
one year with an IOP of 27mmHg.  Keratitis was observed in [ADDRESS_435686] w eek after surgery.  In

treated eyes with 0% of eyes at  one year follo w-up versus trabe culectomy with MMC meta 
analysis means of 15.6% and 20.1% and aqueous shunt means rangi ng from 2.5-11.9%. 
 Visual acuity decreases were le ss in the InnFocus MicroShunt gr oups with 2.4% and 4.3% versus 
a mean of 14.6% in the one trab eculectomy with MMC meta analysi s that reported the decreases.  
The InnFocus MicroShunt groups wer e also less than the reported  aqueous shunt visual acuity 
decreases ranging from 10.8-21.8%.  Acute hypotony and related adverse ev ents were simi lar for the trabeculectomy and InnFocus 
MicroShunt groups, with no chroni c hypotony in the InnFocus Mic roShunt groups. 
 Corneal edema was greater in both I nnFocus MicroShunt studies w ith 17.4% and 14.6% as 
compared to the glaucoma draina ge device studies mean values of  7.3% and 3.6%.  There was no 
meta analysis data available f or trabeculectomy with or without  MMC.  The corneal edema value 
of 17.4% was in the Dominican R epublic study and was observed o nly in combined InnFocus 
MicroShunt and cataract cases where  corneal edema is expected.  One of the six cases observed 
in the Bordeaux study was also a  combined surgery case.  Four o f these cases resolved within the 
first 3 months with the final  one by [CONTACT_350555]-up. 
   There were no other notable diffe rences in the co mparisons betw een the two procedures. 
 Based on this analysis of the relat ive safety of the InnFocus M icroShunt as compared to 
commercialized glaucoma drainage  devices and trabeculectomy wit h MMC, the InnFocus 
MicroShunt has comparable or bette r safety characteristics.

Glaucoma Drainage System in th e ongoing studies summarized abov e.  The summary of the 
preliminary findings is as follows:  
 No biocompatibility issues have  been observed with the device. 
 
 In all cases, the InnFocus Mic roShunt was successfully placed t hrough the needle tract without 
damage to the device.

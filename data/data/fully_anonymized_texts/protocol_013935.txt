V7 Revi sed 10/23/2018  Page 4 of 28 1.0. Background  
Recent changes in the DSM -5 (APA, 2013 ) have removed Autism Spectru m Disorders (ASD) as 
an exclusionary criteria for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). This major 
revision has been strongly supported by [CONTACT_340900], clinical, and neuroimaging data 
that suggests ADHD co -occurs in individuals with  ASD (Sprenger et al., 2013 ). It is estimated 
between 16 to 54% of individuals with ASD have symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and 
impulsivity and meet criteria for ADHD (Sinzig, Walter, & Doepfner, 2009 ; Sprenger et al., 
2013 ). Individuals with a co -diagnosis of ADHD and ASD (ASD+ADHD) generally have a 
higher severity of pathophysiology which his reflected in higher rates o f hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
medication treatment, and behavioral therapy than ASD alone (J. A. Frazier et al., 2001 ). In 
addition, children with a diagnosis of ASD+ADHD have therapeutic implicatio ns including 
distinct behavioral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], pharmacotherapy, and neural correlates (Antshel et al., 2011 ; 
Geurts, Verte, Oosterlaan, Roeyers, & Sergeant, 2004 ; RUPP, 2005 ).  
 
Recent estimates suggest one -third of children diagnosed with ASD+ADHD are treated with 
psychostimulants (T. W. Frazier et al., 2011 ). In the past, the routine use of psychostimulants 
were discouraged in ASD over co ncern that they might precipi[INVESTIGATOR_340866], 
repetitive behaviors, or irritability (Campbell, 1975 ). More recently, in the largest randomized 
control trial (RCT) of methylphenidate (MPH) in children with  ASD and symptoms of ADHD, 
approximately 49% of the 72 enrolled subjects had a favorable response (RUPP, 2005 ). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_340867], 18% of participants discontinued MPH primarily due to 
irritability or other adverse effects. The results of this trial are in contrast to the NIMH 
Multimodal Treatment Study of ADHD of otherwise typi[INVESTIGATOR_340868], in which nearly 
three -quarter s of the subjects were successfully maintained on MPH monotherapy with only a 4% 
dropout rate (MTA, 1999 ).  
 
Recently, Tye and colleagues (2014 ) attempted to further clarify electroencephalography (EEG) 
differences between children with ASD, ASD+ADHD, and ADHD using event related potentials 
(ERPs). They used ERPs to measure temporal characteristics of different stages of emotional 
processing (emot ional face task) to identify early encoding deficits (N170) in ASD and later 
contextual processing deficits (N400) in ADHD. Of interest, the ASD+ADHD group 
demonstrated ERP features consistent with both ASD and ADHD. Furthermore, the magnitude of 
these cha nges correlated with clinical measures of symptom severity including Social 
Communication Questionnaire and the Connors’ questionnaire. The implications of this 
innovative study demonstrate a unique electrophysiology signature [CONTACT_340934], including 
shared features in the ASD+ADHD group. As a stated limitation, the selection of subjects 
including mostly higher functioning ASD (average full -scale IQ = 115.7) and may not be easily 
generalizable to children with ASD+ADHD and more severe cognitive limitatio ns.  
 
Eye Tracking Rational:  Eye tracking is a non -invasive neurophysiological measure that can 
clarify a wide range of cognitive processes and well suited to investigate the primary goal of this 
proposal in children with more impaired ASD. Eye tracking of fers a window into a “hardwired” 
circuit into the brain in a patient population that may not easily tolerate more invasive diagnostic 
procedures. Hands -free eye tracking can be readily used with children with ASD who have a 
more severe behavioral phenotype  including limited receptive language, hypersensitivity, and 
hyperactive/impulsive behaviors. The basic parameters measured by [CONTACT_340901][INVESTIGATOR_340869] (Karatekin, 2007 ). These parameters 
can be obtained in real -time and can be readily transformed into a spatial and te mporal time -
series which can model and make inferences about cognitive processes including memory, 
attention, socio -emotional processes, and motivation. Children with ADHD consistently have 
V7 Revi sed 10/23/2018  Page 5 of 28 been reported to make more premature saccades and more errors on a nti-saccade tasks than TDC 
suggesting difficulties in cognitive inhibition (Klein, Raschke, & Brandenbusch, 2003 ; Munoz, 
Armstrong, Hampton, & Moore, 2 003). Recently, Fried and collea gues studied a cohort of [ADDRESS_421922] of Variables of Attention (TOVA) (Fried et al., 2014 ). Off medication, the ADHD group 
displayed a  higher number of microsaccades (3 -fold), eye blinks (8 -fold), and a decrease in pupil 
size over time compared to controls. Of interest, after treatment with psychostimulants, the 
ADHD group largely normalized all three parameters and was similar to TDC. E ye tracking has 
been extensively studied in ASD, primarily to assess social cognition and previously reviewed 
(Boraston & Blakemore, 2007 ). Of importance, despi[INVESTIGATOR_340870], no 
published study has applied current ADHD eye tracking paradigms and analysis such as 
described in Fried (2014 ) to investigate attentional features of ASD.   
 
Secondary Measure: SICI is a TMS 
measure of the efficiency of inhibitory 
interneurons in the primary motor cortex 
(M1) (Kujirai et al., 1993 ). Over the last 
decade supported by [CONTACT_340902] (R01/MH095014) we identified 
SICI as a TMS biomarker of ADHD with 
the following properties: (1) M1 SICI is 
reduced  in 8-12 year old children with 
ADHD compared to TDC (F igure 1), (2) 
reduced SICI correlates with symptom 
severity, (3) reduced SICI is a robust 
predictor of ADHD diagnosis (even adjusted for SES, IQ, reading scores, and gender) (Gilbert, 
Isaacs, Augusta, MacNeil, & Mostofsky, 2011 ). SICI is routinely and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_340871] l tolerated by [CONTACT_7683]. Of interest, one previous study has shown no 
difference between SICI between adults with ASD and matched TDC (Enticott et al., 2013 ). In 
sub-analysis, a difference in SICI emerged betwee n ASD subjects with early language delay 
compared to TDC, further supporting the use of SICI as a symptom specific biomarker, rather 
than a global deficit in ASD. As a quantitative physiological marker of motor function that can be 
obtained quickly, SICI i s an ideal candidate which to clarify fundamental mechanisms of cerebral 
function that underlie impaired behavioral control.  
 
Presently, it remains unresolved  in the current literature if (1) co -occurrence of ASD+ADHD 
represents an additive co -morbidity o r an endophenotype of ASD with a distinct etiology, 
symptoms, and prognosis and (2) a lack of a reliable clinical methodology for the diagnosis and 
management of ASD+ADHD (Matsuura et al., 2014 ), especially in regards to pharmacotherapy 
response. Children with ADHD either alone or in co -occurrence with ASD have difficulty with 
response selection and control, which is reflected in more variable and disinhibited behavior. 
Diagnosis and treatment of  ADHD symptoms in the ASD could be greatly enhanced if the 
physiological substrates of treatment response variability were known.  
 
 
1.1. Summary  
 
The proposed project “Eye Tracking as a Predictor of Methylphenidate (MPH) Response in 
Autism Spectrum Disord ers (ASD) with comorbid ADHD” will investigate the role of a non -
invasive neurobehavioral biomarker in an underserved clinical population to clarify diagnosis and 

V7 Revi sed 10/23/2018  Page 6 of 28 guide treatment decisions. Specifically, we will modify an existing eye tracking paradigm tha t 
discriminates between ADHD and typi[INVESTIGATOR_340872] 
(ASD+ADHD) and without ADHD comorbidity. A case -control design (Aim 1) comparing 
neurobehavioral measures will lead into a randomized placebo controlled trial of MPH in 
ASD+AD HD (Aim 2). We hypothesize that children with ASD+ADHD will demonstrate specific 
abnormalities in microsaccades, eye blink frequency, and pupil dilation on continuous 
performance testing that will predict MPH treatment response on standardized clinical out comes 
for ADHD. As a secondary measure, we perform a brief electrophysiological measure, short 
interval cortical inhibition (SICI), as measured by [CONTACT_196959] (TMS). We 
have extensively investigated this measure as a robust predictor of ADHD diagnosis and 
symptom severity in otherwise typi[INVESTIGATOR_340868]. We anticipate this personalized 
medicine -based approach to identify ADHD co -morbidity in ASD will produce a 
neurophysiological biomarker to enhance diagnostic reliability and matc h appropriate 
pharmacotherapy in a complex neurodevelopmental disease.  
 
2.0. Rationale and Specific Aims  
2.1. Rationale  
The overall goal  of this proposal to use neurophysiological measures to profile attentional and 
response control deficits for ADHD co -morbidity in ASD to clarify diagnosis and to predict 
treatment response. The central hypothesis  posits that neurophysiological differences  between 
ASD and ADHD can be reliably differentiated by [CONTACT_340903]. For Aim 1 , our primary outcome  is to validate critical eye tracking parameters to 
classify ASD and ASD+ADHD. As a secondary outcome , we will measure SI CI, a well -
established electrophysiological TMS parameter in ADHD, to identify differences in motor cortex 
inhibition. For Aim 2 , we propose a single dose methylphenidate (methylphenidate) RCT 
exclusively in ASD+ADHD participants to identify neurophysiolog ical correlates of treatment 
response and provide critical preliminary data for additional imaging or EEG studies to 
investigate mechanisms of action.  To approach these goals we specifically propose:  
 
2.2. Specific Aims and Hypotheses  
Aim 1: To identify n europhysiological measures that discriminate between children with ASD 
and ASD+ADHD, which specifically correlate with symptom severity as measured by 
[CONTACT_340904].  
 
1.1 To use eye -tracking to identify critical parameters that highly correlate with ADHD 
comorbidity in ASD during continuous performance testing (CPT). Hypothesis: 
Children diagnosed with ASD+ADHD will have (1) an increased number of 
microsaccades and eye blinks and a decreased pupil size over time compared to 
children with ASD duri ng a CPT and (2) severity of these markers will correlate with 
symptom burden.  
1.2 To measure resting paired pulse TMS evoked cortical inhibition (SICI) and 
determine the relationship between SICI and ADHD symptoms in youth with ASD. 
Hypothesis: Baseline SICI will be (1) predictive of baseline symptom severity and 
(2) SICI will be decreased in ASD+ADHD compared to ASD.  
 
Aim 2: To perform a pi[INVESTIGATOR_209911] (RCT) of a single dose of MPH or placebo in 
children with ASD+ADHD to determine the neurophy siological correlates of treatment response 
as measured by [CONTACT_340905].  
V7 Revi sed 10/23/2018  Page 7 of 28 1.1 To specific eye tracking parameters (microsaccades, eye blinks, and pupil size) to 
predict response of MPH on improved CPT scores on the Test of Attentional 
Performance f or Children (KiTAP). Hypothesis: Discriminatory eye tracking 
parameters for ASD+ADHD will be highly correlated with response to MPH on the 
KiTAP and unrelated to placebo.  
1.[ADDRESS_421923] -dosing to evaluate change 
associated with MPH and correlation with treatment. Hypothesis: MPH treatment 
will improve performance on CPT and increase SICI (decrease SICI ratio) compared 
to placebo.  
 
2.3. Innovation  
Our long-term goal  is to elucidate the contribution of neurophysiologi cal mechanisms in the 
neural pathology of ASD, specifically for rigorous classification and to predict treatment response 
to behavioral and pharmacological interventions.  We believe the published work demonstrate 
innovation  as it capi[INVESTIGATOR_340873] a novel ap proach to quantify deficits in neural circuits hypothesized 
to be involved in ADHD comorbidity in ASD and leverages the unique strength of our Autism 
research group and pediatric electrophysiology/TMS program at CCHMC. No published study 
has examined these  particular eye tracking or TMS measures within a subgroup of ASD as well 
as including a clinical trial to assess treatment response. Successfully completing the aims of this 
project will establish a key quantitative measure to characterize a highly preval ent and distressing 
comorbidity in ASD. Though this proposal highlights the clinical consequences of this work, i.e. 
diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers, a critical application of this technique would be to assist 
with specific enrichment of research coh orts of individuals with ASD. Such work is essential for 
the development of future targeted treatments developed to focus on subgroups defined by 
[CONTACT_340906], neuroimaging, and phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_340874].   
 
3.0.   Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
 
3.1. Inclusion Criteria  
 
1. DSM -V-TR diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder not otherwise specified (NOS) 
based on a semi -structured review of DSM -V criteria and mental status examination 
as well as a a complete systematic patient interview utilizing the Autism Diagnostic 
Observation Schedule (ADOS)  
2. Males and females ages 8-[ADDRESS_421924] not be taking any psychotropic drugs affecting glutama te 
neurotransmission (riluzole, memantine, acamprosate, topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], amanta dine, 
among others)  which may interfere with TMS recording .  If patient is on a home 
psychostimulants medication this will be held on the day of testing.   Subjects may not 
be taking more than two psychotropic drugs.  Dosing of all concomitant psychotropic 
drugs  targeting core social and/or communication impairment  must be stable for four 
weeks prior to randomization.  Dosing of all concomitant psychotropic drugs targeting 
other feature s associated with ASD  (insomnia, inattention, hyperactivity, anxiety, 
irritability among others) must be stable for two weeks (with the exception of four 
weeks for fluoxetine) prior to randomization.  
4. Stable seizure disorder (no seizures in 6 months prior t o enrollment; on same 
anticonvulsant dose > 60 days  or ) 
V7 Revi sed 10/23/[ADDRESS_421925] has provided 
written informed assent.  Expectation that a majority of subjects will be able to assent 
but the potential for the younger children and/or those that are cognitively impaired 
will not be able to assent.  
 
3.2. Exclusion  Criteria  
1. Subjects exhibiting significant disruptive, aggressive, self -injurious, or sexually 
inappropriate behavior will not be eligible for enrollment  
2. Presence of current DSM -V psychiatric disorders that may require alternative 
pharmac otherapy or different treatment unrelated to Autism Spectrum Disorder or 
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.  
3. Presence of any medical condition that would make treatment with MPH less safe.  
Subjects with significant cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease will be excluded due to 
concerns about pharmacokinetic alterations or adverse effects.  Because of the 
unknown effects of MPH on the developi[INVESTIGATOR_18081], females of childbearing 
potential will be given a urine pregnancy test and required to use a suitable form of 
birth control during the study.   A positive pregnancy test  result  excludes the subject.  
4. Presence of any other condition that would make the participants unable to comply 
with the requirements of the study for any reason.  
5. Prohibited Concomitant Medicatio ns: Methylphenidate is primarily excreted by [CONTACT_340907].  The following 
medications are not allowed due to the potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction: 
monoamine oxidase inhibitors  or atomoxetine.  
 
4.0. Enrollment  and Randomization  
4.1. Enrollment  
We plan on enrolling 25 children with ASD and 40 children with ASD+ADHD for Aim 1. For 
Aim 2, we will target a total of 40 children with ASD+ADHD (20 for MPH and 20 for placebo) 
which may include subjects who elect to remain in the study after completing A im 1 tasks.  
V7 Revi sed 10/23/2018  Page 9 of 28 Figure  1 gives the experimental d esign and study flow. This is a single visit study.  Total 
enrollment of participants will be 60 ages 8 to 21 year s. 
 
4.2. Randomization  
Subjects with ASD complete the study following a single neurophysiological session. Subjects  
with ASD and ADHD  will be randomized to either single dose MPH  or placebo in 1:[ADDRESS_421926] been determined to meet all eligibili ty criteria through screening.  We will use block 
randomization (4 subjects a group) to assure age and gender matching based on recruitment. This 
computer -generated randomization list will be generated by [CONTACT_340908] (e.g. , Splus6) and passed to the investigational pharmacy for treatment assignment.  The 
pharmacist keeps a log of what regimen is dispensed at each visit that can then be subsequently 
verified. Only the investigational pharmacist will have access to the random ization list.

5.0. Study methods  
5.1. Baseline characterization  
We plan to recruit from an ASD clinical treatment population of several thousand patients. On 
average the Kelly O’Leary Center Autism Research Group enrolls four new subjects of all ages 
with ASD into research protocols per week. The majority of persons di agnosed at the center 
participate in research and all subjects receive a rigorous clinical diagnostic protocol following 
the specifications of the Autism Treatment Network (ATN). This comprises a large existing 
cohort of subjects available to immediately p articipate in studies, including the ASD and 
ASD+ADHD sample we propose in this study. Autism Diagnosis:  If a subject has not received 
gold-standard diagnostic testing and is considered highly qualified candidate by [CONTACT_7357], we will arrange for  a research reliable psychologist to administer the Autism 
Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS -2)(Lord et al., 2012 ) to confi rm autism 
diagnosis and the ADOS Calibrated Severity Score (Gotham, Risi, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1321], & Lord, 2007 )will be 
used to assess deficits in communication and reciprocal social interaction that occur in a clinical 
context.  ADHD diagnosis:  To critically group ASD subjects with and without ADHD co -
morbidity, we will rely on a clinician’s diagnosis based and described methods (Matsuura et al., 
2014 ) with confirmation by [CONTACT_31656] -2 report and ADHD Rating Scale IV  (DuPaul, Ervin, Hook, & 
McGoey, 1998 ). Severity Scales:  In addition, a parent/guardian will be asked to complete the 
Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) (Constantino & Gruber, 2005 ), the Vineland Adaptive 
Behavior Scales -2nd E dition (VABS -II)(Sparrow, Balla, & Cicchetti, 200 5), Conners' Parent 
Rating Scale –Revised (CPRS; ADHD severity T score accounts for age and gender) (Conners, 
Sitarenios, Parker, & Epstein, 1998 ),  and Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) (Rutter, 

V7 Revi sed 10/23/2018  Page 11 of 28 Bailey, & Lord, 2003 ) to assess adaptiv e behavior, problem behaviors and competencies, 
attention, health, and social behavior. Developmental or Cognitive Assessments including but not 
limited to the Leiter R, Differential Ability Scales, Stanford Binet 5th Edition, Bayley 
Developmental Scales, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Wechsler Adult Intelligence 
Scale, Kaufmann Brief Intelligence Test -2 may also be performed . Finally, the Physical and 
Neurological Exam for Soft Signs (PANESS ) will be used t o assess subtle soft neurological signs 
and motor skills in children that have been demonstrated to be aberrant in ASD and ADHD 
(Dziuk et al., 2007 ). Additional assessments include complete medical and psychiatric history, 
mental status examination, height, weight,  head measurements , vitals, and TMS tolerance rating .  
If study requires access to participant’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_340875]’s data from a prior research study in which they have participated , a Data Use 
Agreement will be appropriately filled out and submitted.  
 
5.2. Neurobehavioral measures  
5.2.1. Computerized Attention Testing  
KiTAP:  Attentional functions will be assessed using the KiTAP (Fimm & Zimmermann, 2003 ). 
KiTAP is an easy to follow computer -assisted test battery for non -verbal attentional functioning 
across several key domains and ha s been validated in a DD population (Knox et al., 2012 ). 
Subtests will be performed in the following order: Alertness, Distractibility, Flexibility, 
Go/NoGo, Visual Scanning, Vigilance, Sustained Attention, and Divided attention. Following 
previous methods in a lower -functioning population (Knox et al., 2012 ), the shortest subtests will 
be administered fir st to give the widest number of children the greatest chance to complete an 
entire subtest.  
 
5.2.2. Eye Tracking  
A Tobii (Stockholm, Sweden) T300 Infrared Eye Tracker controlled with Tobii Studio software 
(Version 3.0) and integrated with a 17 -inch thin f ilm transistor monitor will be used to measure 
gaze fixation in response to presented visual stimuli. Eye Movements Participants will be 
monitored or asked to make specific eye/eyelid movements. A false belief behavioral task may be 
used in conjunction to monitor eye movements (Senju, Southgate, White, & Frith, 2009 ). This 
task involves the subject to look at a sequence of an actor and a puppet moving a ball between 
two boxes. The resulting ocular movements will be recorded using a Tobii Eye Tracker (Tobii 
Technology AB, Danderyd Sweden).  
 
5.2.3. Single  and paired -pulse TMS procedure   
TMS will be performed using a Magstim 200® stimulator (Magstim Co., [LOCATION_001], NY, [LOCATION_003]) 
connected through a Bistim® module to either a 90 mm circular coil or a double 70 mm figure 8 
coil as described in CHMC 06 -10-11; 05 -05-19; 03 -05-52; [ADDRESS_421927] 
supervision of laboratory personnel dur ing business hours and is locked with restricted key access 
during all other hours.  
 
Single and Paired Pulse TMS:  TMS will be performed as described in our prior CCHMC IRB 
approved protocol CHMC IRB 2008 -0061. TMS involves non -invasive administration of 
magnetic pulses of a strength comparable to, at maximum, the magnetic field intensity of clinical 
MRI scanners. Motor cortex stimulation for upper limb: The round coil is placed with its center 
near the vertex in the optimal position and orientation for prod ucing a motor evoked potential 
(MEP) in the bicep, tricep, abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscle, first digital inter -osseous (FDI) 
V7 Revi sed 10/23/2018  Page 12 of 28 muscle, or abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscle, as the clinical context requires. The figure [ADDRESS_421928] MEPs using a Micro 
1401 processor (CED, Cambridge, [LOCATION_006]) and process the EMG data using Signal® software 
(CED). The EMG is  recorded with surface electrodes taped to the skin. This is comfortable for 
the patient as no needle is required to be inserted in the muscle. The signal is amplified, and 
filtered (100/1000 Hz) (Coulbourn Instruments, Allentown, PA) before being digitize d at 2 kHz 
and stored for analysis using Signal® software and a Micro1401 interface (Cambridge Electronic 
Design, Cambridge, [LOCATION_006]). Resting SICI: Once the MEP “hotspot” is identified and depolarization 
thresholds measured, resting SICI measures require 6 min utes. Briefly, resting SICI is a measure 
of the baseline efficiency of inhibitory interneurons in motor cortex (M1). Ten single, 
suprathreshold pulse TMS trials, muscle evoked response amplitudes are a measure of motor 
cortex responsiveness or excitability . In paired pulse TMS trials, the first conditioning 
subthreshold pulse briefly activates inhibitory interneurons, so that the subsequent suprathreshold 
pulse, on average, evokes a smaller response in muscle (a smaller motor evoked potential, or 
MEP). (Chen et al., 1998 ) SICI may be ex pressed as either a ratio of Paired (smaller) to Single 
(larger) pulses (so a small ratio means more inhibition), or as a percent (100*(1 minus the ratio)). 
So if the average paired pulse MEP amplitude is 0.4 mV and the single pulse is 1.0 mV, SICI may 
be equivalently expressed as a ratio of 0.4 or inhibition of 60%.  Initially, single pulse stimulation 
will be performed over the left primary motor cortex to elicit MEP in the right FDI and to 
determine active and resting motor thresholds (AMT, RMT) using sta ndard methods (Mills & 
Nithi, 1997) . Then 40 trials of brief single or paired pulse stimulation at an interval of 6 seconds 
with one of 2 conditions in randomized order: 1) single (test) pulses and 2) SICI : paired pulses 
(condition/test) at an inhibitor [ADDRESS_421929] pulse will be set above RMT intensity and 
the condition pulse set at approximately 60% RMT.   
 
Additional information and neurophysiological TMS measures:  Thresholds defined using 
conventional criteria as the lowest stimulator intensity that produces measurable responses in 3 of 
6 trials. Intracortical inhibition (SICI) and facilitation (ICF) are measured with a paired -pulse 
paradigm using three conditions: single pulse, paired pulse a t 3 msec interstimulus intervals, 
paired pulse at 10 msec interstimulus intervals. Subthreshold pulse precedes suprathreshold pulse 
for paired pulses. Peripheral conditioning pulses are administered 20 -30 msec prior to motor 
cortex. Short ICF will be also performed with a paired -pulse paradigm (Chen & Garg, 2000 ; 
Hanajima et al., 2002 ; Ziemann et al., 1998 ). Cerebellar conditioning pulses are administered [ADDRESS_421930] stimulus 
alone. The order of the intervals is varied randomly, and the interval between trials varies 
randomly by <10% around a mean of 6 seconds. Transcortical inhibition to the left dominant 
hemisphere/ ri ght dominant hand is measured by [CONTACT_340909], while the 
child simultaneously contracts muscles in both hands. This produces an evoked potential in this 
ipsilateral and contralateral hand, followed by [CONTACT_340910] (the “sil ent period”). 
Latency and duration of this silent period are affected both by [CONTACT_340911] 
(Garvey et al., 2005 ).  Latencies are measured by [CONTACT_340912]. Amplitudes are measured as peak to peak and area under the curve.  
 
Bimanual Tasks  In each experiment, the child has both hands relaxed on his lap, on a pi[INVESTIGATOR_340876].  For the single finger tappi[INVESTIGATOR_340877] , the child is instructed to 
repeatedly tap the task hand index finger while keepi[INVESTIGATOR_176114] -task hand in the same position, 
but relaxed.  To ensure consistency in performance speed and coordination, the a computer 
instructions will be shown to indicate resting, tappi[INVESTIGATOR_340878], tappi[INVESTIGATOR_340879], 
and sustaining a squeezing of the in dex finger to the thumb. TMS will be administered as above 
but during the task.  
V7 Revi sed 10/23/2018  Page 13 of 28  
Response Inhibition Tasks  In each experiment, the child keeps both hands relaxed, but on a cue 
from the computer has to push an X button with the right hand or O button with t he left hand, on 
a game controller. On some trials, a “stop” auditory tone will occur.  At time = 0ms, an image of 
either an X or O will be displayed on the screen. TMS will be administered as above but during 
the task. Slater -Hammel procedure, another res ponse -inhibition task, may also be used to assess 
motor response time (Slater -Hammel, 1960 ). This task requires the subject to hold a button and 
release before a moving marker reaches a predefined time point (800 milliseconds after  the start 
signal). If the marker stops in its trajectory, the participant is instructed to not let go of the button.  
 
Reward Paradigm In each experiment, the participant watches while smiling or frowning faces 
appear on the computer screen. Three smiles w ill result in the participant receiving a monetary 
award ($0.25). TMS will be administered as above, but during the task.  
 
Money Bags Paradigm  In each experiment, the participant clicks the mouse control each time a 
quarter appears above the money bag on a computer screen. If they click accurately, the quarter 
drops into the money bag and ($0.25) is registered as gained by [CONTACT_2299]. The difficulty and 
perceived degree of difficulty varies. TMS will be administered during the task.  
 
Behavioral Tasks Various behavioral task(s) may be performed to assess the effects on motor 
control.  
 
5.2.4. Electroencephalography (EEG)  
EEG will be used to assess the electrophysiologic correlates of behavioral computerized testing, 
behavior, or motor function with TMS.  EEG will be recorded with a whole dense array (dEEG) 
with 256 channel electrode cap (HydroCel Geodesic Sensor Net) continuous recording EEG 
system (Electrical Geodesics, Inc. (EGI), Eugene, OR, [LOCATION_003]). The sensor net uses a mild, 
fragrance -free, saline -based solution to contact [CONTACT_340913], requires approximately 10 minutes to 
position the net and does not require abrasion of the skin as the EGI amplifiers are design to 
tolerate normal skin impedances.  This system of electrodes and amplifiers can be left in p lace 
during TMS stimulation.  Emotiv® wireless EEG (Emotiv, San Francisco, CA [LOCATION_003]) headset or 
Wearable Sensing (San Diego, CA) dry electrode system will also be used to capture scalp EEG 
data.  
 
5.3. Drug dosing: MPH and placebo  
MPH or placebo will be administered 60-[ADDRESS_421931] 
session.  The timing of this dose is  consistent based on the  well-described response of 
psychostimulants. It will also allow us to monitor compliance since dosin g will occur during the 
study visit .  The dose of MPH  will be 0.3 mg/kg, up to 20 mg ; rounding to the nearest 2.5mg 
increment This dose of 0.3 mg/kg i s also comparable to studies of stimulant use in children with 
autism  that have explored doses ranging from 0.3 mg/kg to 0.6 mg/kg (Handen, Johnson, & 
Lubetsky, 2000 ).  Placebo capsules will be identical in appearance to MPH  capsules.  All 
participants and study investigators will remain blind to drug assignment during th e trial.  In case 
of emergency, the investigational pharmacy will be able to break the blind.  
 
5.4. Primary  Outcome Measure  
 
Eye tracking is a non -invasive neurophysiological measure that can clarify a wide range of 
cognitive processes and well suited to investigate the primary goal of this proposal in children 
V7 Revi sed 10/23/[ADDRESS_421932] been well 
characterized in typi[INVESTIGATOR_340869] (Karatekin, 2007 ). In this study, we will be 
replicating findings from Fried colleagues who studied a cohort of [ADDRESS_421933] of Variables of 
Attention (TOVA) (Fried et al., 2014 ). Off medication, the ADHD group displayed a higher 
number of microsaccades (3 -fold), eye blinks (8 -fold), and a decrease in pupil size over time 
compared to controls.  
 
5.5. Secondary  Outcome Measures  
A number of additional second ary outcome measures will be administered.  SICI is a TMS 
measure of the efficiency of inhibitory interneurons in the primary motor cortex (M1) (Kujirai et 
al., 1993 ). Over the last decade supported by [CONTACT_340914] (R01/MH095014) we 
identified SICI as a TMS biomarker of ADHD with the following properties: (1) M1 SICI is 
reduced  in 8-12 year old children wit h ADHD compared to TDC (Figure 1), (2) reduced SICI 
correlates with symptom severity, (3) reduced SICI is a robust predictor of ADHD diagnosis 
(even adjusted for SES, IQ, reading scores, and gender) (Gilbert et al., 2011 ). SICI is routinely 
and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_340880]. Of interest, one p revious 
study has shown no difference between SICI between adults with ASD and matched TDC 
(Enticott et al., 2013 ). In sub -analysis, a difference in SICI emerged between ASD subjects with 
early language delay compared to TDC, further supporting the use of SICI as a symptom specific 
biomarker, rather than a global deficit in ASD. As a quantitative physiological marker of motor 
function that can be obtained quickly, SICI is an ideal candidate w hich to clarify fundamental 
mechanisms of cerebral function that underlie impaired behavioral control.  
 
5.6. Assessment of a dverse events  (AEs)   
Assessment of AEs will be collected at each visit by [CONTACT_340915], visits to the doctor, or taken any new medication. In 
addition, a TMS  16-point review of systems may  be used pre and post TMS to assess any adverse 
effects due to TMS. This scale was recently published and used frequently in our lab (Hong et al., 
2015 ). The physic ian will keep a running log of AEs that will record the date of onset, date of 
resolution, severity, and relationship to study intervention (e.g., definite, probable, possible, 
remote, or none).  A schedule of measures is shown in Table 1.

6.0. Data Analysis and Management  
6.1. Sample Size  
Fried et al. (2014 ) reported a large effect size (d=1.0) between youth with ADHD and TDC in 
comparisons of microsaccades difference between groups, a primary outcome in our study. Based 
on this effect size, our propos ed sample size of 20 -25 per a group will provide 87% power to 
detect a significant difference in means of our primary outcome.  The proposed project will 
provide crucial pi[INVESTIGATOR_340881]. The 
propose d sample size will also be sufficient to identify barriers to enrollment and completion of 
the study.   
 
6.2 Statistical Analysis  
Eye tracking  data: Raw eye tracking data will be acquired by [CONTACT_340916] (Version 3.0; 
Switzerland, Sweden). Analysis will be  performed based on previous methods (Fried et al., 2014 ). 
Briefly, eye blinks will be detected as periods of no tracking data. Microsaccade rate will be 
detected with a post -processing algorithm of raw eye tracking data ada pted from previously 
described methods (Bonneh et al., 2010 ) and using a velocity -threshold filter (V -T): Eye tracking 
data will first be processed using a [ADDRESS_421935] 6 ms in a the same 
direction (with a 30 degree window) with a minimum velocity of 10 degrees/s, peek velocity 
greater than 18 degrees/s, and a saccade amplitude greater than 0.[ADDRESS_421936] 
measure during each experimental setup. Intervention analysis: For statistical analysis in the  
RCT, [ADDRESS_421937] intervention [GROUP*TIME].  TMS data:  Motor physiology 
measures (SICI, thresholds) will be compared between ASD and ASD+ADHD groups usin g t 
tests. In the intervention group, motor physiology measures will be compared pre - and post - using 
2 way repeated measures ANOVA. Computerized Neurocognitive Testing:  KiTAP results of the 
five summary domain scores will be compared between groups using a multivariate analysis of 
variance (MANOVA) in SPSS and followed up with independent sample t tests. In addition, we 
will examine the effect sizes for the individual primary scores. Neurophysiological Data and 
Clinical Measures:  A Pearson product moment c orrelation of age, eye tracking measures (eye 
blinks, microsaccade rate, pupil diameter), neurobehavioral measures (KiTAP), clinical measures 
(VABS, Connor’s), and motor physiology will be explored within the entire sample and stratified 
by [CONTACT_637].  
 
6.3. Data Management  
When a participant is enrolled in the study, the participant  will be assigned a unique identification 
number that is used to identify all data associated with that person, including hard copy  and 
computerized data .  Data will be collecte d on hard -copy forms and then verified by [CONTACT_340917].  All of the hard copy research data is kept in locked file cabinets at th e Kelly O’Leary 
Center for Autism .  Only the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_340882], 
ensuring security of the hard copy records.  
 
6.4 Reporting Results to Participants

7.0 Feasibility  
 
The Autism Research Group and Kelly O’Leary Center at CCHMC has a large existing cohort of 
subjects available to immediately participate in studies, including the ASD a nd ASD+ADHD 
sample we propose in this study. We have a strong research team with a diverse set of expertise in 
clinical trial research, and clinical assessment and treatment. Drawing from an ASD clinical 
treatment population of several thousand patients, o n average the Autism Research Group and 
Kelly O’Leary Center enrolls four new subjects of all ages with ASD into research protocols per 
week. The proposed project builds on that work and because it employs similar tasks, measures, 
and participants, it has a high potential for success.  
 
8.0. Project timeline  
We are anticipating requiring two years to complete this project and the associated RCT. We will 
enroll [ADDRESS_421939] with ASD+ADHD per a week over an [ADDRESS_421940](s) for presentatio n at the 
AACAP Annual Meeting, and initiate primary manuscript preparation.

on A7 , MOB343 0 or the Schubert Research Clinic .  
 
11.0. Human  Subjects  
V7 Revi sed 10/23/2018  Page 18 of 28 11.1.  Human Subjects Involvement and Characteristics  
A total of 60 children between the ages of 8 years and 21 years meeting DSM -V and ADOS 
criteria for ASD  (n=20) or ASD+ADHD  (n=40) will participate in the study of eye tracking as a 
predictor of methylphenidate response .  There are no restrictions on gender, ethnic or social 
background.  We plan to include females, children, cognitively impaired, and members of 
minority groups and th eir subpopulations in this research.  By [CONTACT_547], the projected composition 
is female (20%) and male (80%).  The rationale for the anticipated inequality by [CONTACT_340918] a higher frequency of ASD in males as detailed below.  
 
11.2. Sources of Material  
The neuropsychiatric history, medical history, and overall clinical assessment will be utilized in 
the research period .  Specific research material includes the behavioral rating data , which will be 
obtained for research purposes only .  There are no plans to make use of  records or other data.   
 
12.0.  Risks and Benefits  
12.1. Risks to the subject  
The primary risks of this study include those associated with MPH drug administration and TMS . 
Minor risks are associated with EEG.  Other  risks are those associate d with the potential for loss 
of confidentiality.  Finally, there are minimal risks commonly associated with a medical office 
visit and collection of data.    
 
12.1.1. MPH  
MPH 0.3 mg/kg  will be dosed 60-[ADDRESS_421942] -drug neurophysiological session.  
The dose of 0.3 mg/kg (maximum dose 20 mg) was chosen to approximate the range of most 
participants in similar studies (Handen et al., 2000 ; Harfterkamp et al., 2013 ) and is within range 
of doses found to effectively treat ADHD in human  studies (MTA, 1999 ).  In addition, MPH is 
only being given as a single dose .  Because of this, we do not expect to have any serious adverse 
effects.  Higher doses are routinely used clinically with all dosin g occurring at home. At higher 
doses , MPH can cause tachycardia, hypertension, headache, tremor, confusion, nervousness, 
irritability, psychosis, twitching, and visual disturbances .  There is a remote risk of sudden death 
in patients with specific preexisting heart defects. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_340883], 
18% of participants discontinued MPH primarily due to irritability or other adverse effects. The 
results of this trial are in c ontrast to the NIMH Multimodal Treatment Study of ADHD of 
otherwise typi[INVESTIGATOR_340868], in which nearly three -quarters of the subjects were 
successfully maintained on MPH monotherapy with only a 4% dropout rate (MTA, 1999 ). In 
order to ensure safety of subjects , additional criter ia must be met for a subject to be randomized 
to drug treatment phase of the study. Subjects must have 1) no significant heart disease, 2) no 
history of a first degree relative with early, sudden cardiac death, 3) no hypertension, 4) no 
history of severe a dverse response to MPH,  
 
12.1.2. Single and Paired -pulse TMS  
Single and paired pulse TMS has been used at CCHMC under [CONTACT_140534]’s direction since 2001 
for research only. Potential discomforts are mild and transient. In a prior study of 40 healthy and 
ADHD children, Garvey et al asked children to rank TMS compared to other childhood activities. 
TMS was ranked preferable to 1) a “shot”; 2) going to the dentist; and 3) a long car ride (Garvey, 
Kaczynski, Becker, & Bartko, 2001 ). The following mild, transient effects were reported in our 
prior study of 35 children and adults: scalp discomfort (12%), hand weakness (9%), headache, 
neck pain, arm pain, and arm tingling (6%), hand pain, decreased hand dexterity, hearing 
V7 Revi sed 10/23/2018  Page 19 of 28 changes, and tiredness (3%). All of these had resolved by [CONTACT_53016].  There were no 
physical findings after TMS supporting the subjective descriptions of loss of strength or dexterity. 
We have also recently published a series of > [ADDRESS_421943] underwent TM S in our 
laboratory without any serious adverse effects (Hong et al., 2015 ). A prior common concern 
about use of TMS was the risk of seizures (Wassermann, 1998 ). We follow recommended 
guidelines (Wassermann, 1998 ) and have seen no seizures in children or adults studied at our 
center. In addition, more recent studies even in children with epi[INVESTIGATOR_340884],  especially single or paired pulse TMS, inducing seizures is quite low.  
 
 
12.1.3.  Loss of Confidentiality   
Loss of confidentiality is a potential risk in most clinical research.  During the conduct of clinical 
research, personal information about the participant or family could become known to others 
against the participant’s wishes.  These epi[INVESTIGATOR_340885], but occasionally occur due to 
the large number of different people that may interact or “run in to” the participants or family 
members during a course of a clinical trial with frequent visits.  Acquiring the behavioral and 
treatment records and video,  of the participants creates the potential risk of breech in 
confidentiality.  In unusual cases, the mandatory reporting of certain events (e.g., child abuse or 
neglect) would be required by [CONTACT_2371].  
 
12.1.4.  Minimal  Risks  
Beyond those risks noted above, there are minimal risks associated with office visits and the 
collection of behavioral data.  This would includ e the inconvenience of the  frequency of study 
visits, potential embarrassment over discussing psychiatric symptoms, and feeling uncomforta ble 
during procedures (e.g., physical exam, vital signs) .  There are no substantial risks involved with 
participating in social skills training.  However, should a child become a danger to the child’s 
self, others or objects, physical intervention may be d eemed necessary.  The risk of this latter 
event will be minimal since subjects must be free of disruptive, aggressive, self -injurious, or 
sexually inappropriate behavior in order to be eligible for enrollment.   
 
12.[ADDRESS_421944] risks  
12.2.1. Recruitment and informed consent  
Recruitment of subjects will be conducted by [CONTACT_340919] , their families, 
treating clinicians and a gencies throughout Ohio , and those within our existing clinical services, 
residential facilities, schools and group homes for the developmentally disabled of the availability 
of this pro gram of research . Approved recruitment materials will be shared when notifying 
individuals with ASD, their families, treating clinicians and agencies throughout Ohio and within 
our existing clinical services.  The study may also  be advertised in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/c linic and general 
public areas via print, email, electronic and social media using the recruitment materials.  The 
available historical and clinical data will be reviewed with the referring clinician, and if it appears 
that the subject would  satisfy entry criteria for the study, the study will be described to the subject 
and his/her legal guardian.  Subjects and their legal guardians interested in participating in the 
study will have a face -to-face interview with the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or the Resear ch 
Coordinator where the nature of the project, the risks, the benefits, and the alternatives to 
V7 Revi sed 10/23/[ADDRESS_421945] (when possible) and the subject’s 
family.  If following these discussions the subject and family co ntinue to be interested in the 
project, and assent is obtained from the subject  (when  possible depending on cognitive ability)  
and formal written consent is obtained from the parent(s) /legal guardian(s) , clinical responsibility 
for the care of the subject is then assumed by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_340886].  All potential subjects and their legal guardians will be encouraged to ask 
questions about any aspect of the study that is unclear.  All questions will be answe red a nd 
uncertainties clarified before the consent is signed.  All potential subjects and their legal guardians 
will be consented in their native language or a language that they find understandable.  Written  
assent will only be obtained from those subjects deeme d to have the cognitive ability to fully 
comprehend the document.  This will be determined by a qualified member of the research team 
based on direct observation, clinical judgment and parent/guardian report.   All subjects and their 
legal guardians will be provided with copi[INVESTIGATOR_340887].  
Appropriate clinical evaluation and treatment of the referring problem will be offered regardless 
of the subject’s/legal guardian’s decisions regarding participation in the s tudy.   All of the research 
recruitment data is kept in locked files at the TKOC, which ensures that no one other than the 
study investigators have access to health information .  The other  procedures to ensure 
confidentiality follow the regulations and poli cies of the Cincinnati Children’s Medical Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_74506] . 
 
If the legal guardian withdraws consent prior to completion of the study, the reason for 
withdrawal will be documented.  This will not affect the subject’s ability to get clinical treatment 
for th eir condition either at our Center or elsewhere.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_340888] (e.g., development 
of new medical or psychiatric illness that would make partic ipation less safe) or jeopardizes 
integrity of data (e.g., subject refusing to follow protocol).   
 
12.2.2.  Protection against risk for MPH adverse effects  
Effective screening (using medical history and physical exam) will be used to eliminate subjects 
with ASD+ADHD who will be randomized to the controlled trial and who are at greatest risk for 
adverse effect from MPH  because of concurrent medical conditions.  Subjects will only be 
accepted into the study if they are free of any significant medical illness as determined by a 
comprehensive history taking, medical review of sys tems and physical examination.  
 
Methylphenidate  is an U.S. FDA Pregnancy Category C drug.  Because of the unknown effects of 
methylphenidate  on the developi[INVESTIGATOR_18081], females of ch ildbearing potential will be given a 
urine pregnancy test and will be excluded from the study if this is positive.   Since our sample will 
include some  pre-pubertal children ages [ADDRESS_421946] is obtained, we will confirm with a serum HCG, inform the paren ts and 
transfer the care to the child’s primary care physician.  Since the some of the children in this 
study are under the age of [ADDRESS_421947] whose symptoms become 
V7 Revi sed 10/23/[ADDRESS_421948] and alter or terminate the study if it is 
warranted.  Any serious adverse event will be repo rted to our local IRB, the drug manufacturer, 
Human Research Pr otection Office (HRPO), and the FDA.   
 
We have several mechanisms to reduce the risk of loss of confidentiality.  All of the research data 
is kept in locked files at the TKOC, which ensures tha t no one other than the study investigators 
have access to health information.  The database is locked and only accessible by [CONTACT_340920].  Each participant will be given a 
unique alphanumeric code and this will serve as the only connection between the locked files, the 
hard-copy forms, and the electronic database.  The key to the code is only available to the study 
investigators.  All forms used in the study contain only this alphanumeric code so no personal 
information is exposed to potential hazards.  All visits are conducted in private offices, exam 
rooms and classrooms.  Additionally, other procedures to ensure confidentiality will follow the 
regulations and policies set by [CONTACT_340921]’s Medical Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54246],  including those of 
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.  
 
Finally, the minimal risks associated with office visits will be reduced even further.  The guiding 
principle in all interactions is respect for the dignity of each participant and their family.  The 
scheduling of study visits take s into account sc hool and work schedules  to minimize the 
disruption for the participant and family.  All procedures (e.g., physical exam) will be explained 
verbally or by [CONTACT_340922].  Frequent bre aks are allowed during visits as needed in order to reduce 
fatigue.  The use of praise, rewards, visually stimulating objects and gadgets (e.g., bubble 
machine, Koosh ball) are also encouraged while interacting with younger participants.  In order to 
minim ize any financial hardship, free parking will be provided.   
 
Since  persons with significant disruptive behavior will be excluded from participation, we do not 
expect subjects to exhibit any severe maladaptive behaviors.  Disruptive behavior will initi ally be 
handled by [CONTACT_340923] .  Behavior that is attention seeking  may be managed but the use of brief 
time-outs.  Should behaviors occur that threaten to jeopardize the safety of subjects or staff, crisis 
intervention -trained staff may utilize de -escalation and self -protection as prescribed by [CONTACT_340924] e.  
 
All written information will be kept confidential and separate from the clinical chart.  All data 
and information accumulated in person, through observation, video, photograph, survey, or via 
checklist, pertaining to the participant will only be discu ssed and shared with the participant and 
necessary personnel and agencies .  Participant identity will be held in confidence in reports in 
which the project may be published.  
 
13.0. Potential benefits of the proposed research  
The potential benefits that a subject could have from entering this project include the following: 
subjects will receive an extensive psychia tric and medical evaluation that is provided free -of-
charge.  Forty  children with ASD+ADHD  will be assigned to either MPH  or placebo and will 
receive a very carefully controlled drug treatment trial  which may treat psychiatric symptoms. 
There will be no direct benefit from single/paired pulse TMS as used in this study as a diagnostic 
measure. A study completion letter will be provided to the patien t’s par ent at the end of the study.  
The letter  will include information from the psychiatric evaluation including a clinical diagnosis 
and any recommendations for follow -up.  
V7 Revi sed 10/23/[ADDRESS_421949] party payers related to participation in this study. 
All subjects will be provided free parking for visits.  Subjects with ASD who complete clinical 
measures and a single session of the neurophysiological assessment will be paid $35. Subjects 
with ASD+A DHD who continue to complete the controlled trial and repeat the 
neurophysiological assessments will be paid $70. Payment will be in the form of a reloadable 
debit card (ClinCard). We will provide the card and load money onto the card after each 
completed visit based on the schedule listed above. We will also administer a handout that will 
explain how to use it.   
 
Because this research study involves payment for participation, we are required by [CONTACT_340925] (IRS) rules to collect and use participants’ social security or tax ID 
number (SSN) in order to track the amount of money that we pay.  Unless  we have been given 
specific permission for another use of participants’ SSN related to this research, we will only use 
the participants’ SSN to keep track of how much money we pay to them and their SSN will not be 
used as part of this research.

This project is directly supported by [CONTACT_340926] (AACAP) Junior Investigator Award funded by [CONTACT_340927]. 
Additional funding will be provided by [CONTACT_941] P.I. Business Plan funded by [CONTACT_340928]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_340889]. All of the listed investigators will be contributing time and 
support and a variety of projects will generate data to secure more extramural funding.   
 
15.0. Data Plan  
A rigorous and systematic approach to d ata management is critical for the quality of any study.  
The substantial effort and resources that will be devoted to collecting data in this project will be 
matched by [CONTACT_340929], verify, correct, 
update, and assemble the resulting data files.  Our data management system incorporates quality 
control at every juncture from data collection through analysis.  We have found that this bottom -
up approach to data quality is essential, since there is no singl e procedure that will verify and 
correct erroneous data. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_340890], therefore maintaining a high level of quality for 
this project.  
 
When a participant is enrolled in the study, they will be assigned a unique identification number 
that is used to identify all data associated with that person, including hard c opy, biological 
specimens, and computerized data .  Unique identifiers will be linked to personal data such as 
names and addresses only by [CONTACT_2363] a restricted password, thus assuring confidentiality.  Data will 
be collected on hard -copy forms and then verif ied by [CONTACT_328388].  All of the hard copy 
research data is kept in locked file cabinets at TKOC.  Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_340891], ensuring security of the hard copy records.  
 
V7 Revi sed 10/23/[ADDRESS_421950] been designed that correspond to the measures used in this study.   These forms are 
configured so that out -of-range values cannot be entered; data en try prompts appear in the correct 
order, including skippi[INVESTIGATOR_328374]; and entered values cannot be inadvertently 
overwritten .  Immediately after data entry, a series of logic check programs are run automatically, 
indicating any entered va lues that appear incorrect and the reason why.   Logic check reports will 
be reconciled with the hardcopy and, if necessary, the clinician.   Changes will then be entered, 
and the logic check programs executed again in order to detect any new errors resultin g from the 
changed values .  The process will continue until the logic check programs detect no further 
errors .  
 
The electronic database used to house these data until analyses are needed will be a web -based 
electronic data capture program created uniquely  for this project.  The database will be password 
protected and only certain users will be given access to the web -based program.  This will protect 
the electronic data against any unauthorized persons from entering the dataset and jeopardizing 
the integri ty of the data or engaging in some sort of malicious pi[INVESTIGATOR_340892].  As this grant matures into 
the data analysis stage, data will be queried and exported to statistical software, in most cases 
SAS, for data analysis.  
 
16.0. Protocol Deviations  
All protocol devi ations will be reported to the IRB and the HRPO.  Unanticipated deviations 
deemed to involve subject safety, subject/study data reliability or validity, or any other deviation 
in the view of the investigator that cannot wait until time of continuing review  for reporting will 
be reported to the IRB and the HRPO within (5) working days of the date the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_340893].  All other deviations 
will be reported at the time of continuing review.   Examples of these protocol deviations include 
those that 1) have no substantive effect on the risks to research subjects and 2) do not affect the 
value of the data collected ( e.g., the deviation does not confound the scientific analysis).  
 
17.0. SAFETY  Monitoring:  
A physician will monitor adverse effects at eac h visit.  In addition, the physician  will review vital 
signs and laboratory data, as they become available.  All of these values are recorded and then 
reviewed by [CONTACT_978].  All adverse event s that arise are recorded by a physician.  This includes 
documenting the date of onset, duration, severity, seriousness, and relationship to study 
medication.  Any severe or serious AEs will be reported as soon as possible to the PI.  All 
significant adver se events as well as the progress of the study will be reviewed and discussed in 
detail at a biannual meeting of the Section of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Data and Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB).  
 
17.1. Data  and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  
Data sa fety and monitoring will occur at several levels.  First, we will systematically elicit and 
document adverse events on a monthly basis.  This review includes the possibility of systematic 
worsening or medication side effec ts.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_340894] s at 
regular research meeting. The results will be recorded under de -identified subject ID numbers.  
This information will be forwarded to [CONTACT_297080] .  [CONTACT_333164]  will serve as an 
independent external observer for adverse events.  [CONTACT_333164]  is a pediatric psychiatrist at 
V7 Revi sed 10/23/2018  Page 24 of 28 Cinc innati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_340895]. Delgado  for review every six months.  [CONTACT_333164]  will then report back to the investigator 
and forward the report to the IRB.  Initially [CONTACT_333164]  will eva luate safety data after the first [ADDRESS_421951] been enrolled (5 diagnosed with ASD  and 5 ASD+ADHD ) or three months after study 
initiation, whichever comes first. This medical monitor will have the authority to stop the 
research project or take other steps  in order to protect the safety and well -being of research 
volunteers until the IRB and HRPO can assess the written report.   
 
17.2.  Reporting  Adverse Events  
All serious or unexpected AEs that are possibly related to drug treatment will be reported to the 
Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_340896] 3 working 
days.  Examples of serious AEs include death , life-threatening event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly /birth defect, and events that 
require medical or surgical intervention t o prevent death, disability, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  An 
unexpected AE is one that is not described in the protocol.  In addition, the HRPO, FDA, and 
drug manufacturer will be notified of  any serious or unexpected AE that is possibly related to 
MPH .  Any action resulting in temporary or permanent suspension of the study will be reported to 
our IRB, the HRPO, and the drug manufacturer.  
 
17.3.  Assuring Protocol  Compliance and Data Accuracy  
All research staff participating  in this study have thoroughly reviewed the protocol prior to the 
initiation of the study.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_340897].  They r eview the study weekly in rounds to 
monitor recruitment, data collection, and protocol compliance.  IRB approval notification, 
approved continuing review reports, and the final study report will be submitted to HRPO as soon 
as these documents become availa ble.  
 
18.0.  Inclusion  of Special Populations  
18.1. Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
Multiple studies have confirmed that autism is four to five times more common in males than 
females.  Therefore, our projected study composition will reflect this epi[INVESTIGATOR_340898] 80% of our participants will be male and 20% will be female.  Enrollment at the 
Cincinnati recruitment site will reflect the 4:1 male:female ratio in autism. Recruitment estimates 
in Cincinnati are based upon the composition of the Greater Cincinnati metropolitan area 
including areas of Southwest Ohio, Northern Kentucky, and Southeast Indiana. The Greater 
Cincinnati area b reakdown is as follows: White 54 .3%, Black or African America n 39.8%, 
Hispanic 2.8%, American Indian  or Al aska Native 0.3%, Asian 1.8%, Native Hawaiian and Other 
Pacific Islander 0.1% .  
 
18.2.  Inclusion  of Children  
ASD is a  disorder of childhood onset that are usually diagnosed by [CONTACT_340930].  It has a 
severe impact on the individual’s development from the time of onset onwards.  Early 
intervention is critical to outcome.  Most treatment studies include minors with hopes t hat early 
treatment of symptoms will result in better long -term outcome.  Informed Consent and Assent:  
Informed Consent of at least one parent or legal guardian of each subject will be obtained 
voluntarily after study procedures, risks, and benefits to pa rticipation have been explained  and all 
questions are answered .  Oftentimes, only one parent is reasonably available for study visits due 
to work responsibilities, caring for other childre n, or living arrangements (i.e., one parent lives in 
V7 Revi sed 10/23/2018  Page 25 of 28 another city or  state).  When reasonably possible, informed consent will be obtained from both 
parents.  This is consistent with 21 CFR 50.  The parent or guardian will be encouraged to ask 
questions at any time and will be given adequate time to review the consent form.   Based on 
parent report, and/or clinical judgment, if the subject is able to comprehend the assent document 
and the risks and benefits involved  in the study, written, assent will be obtained after the child is 
given adequate time to review the document.  Cognitive and communication deficits  are common  
in this population; therefore, obtaining written assent will not always be possible.   
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_340899].  The PI [CONTACT_832] a 
Triple Board trained, board-certified pediatrician and a child and adolescent psychiatrist and has 
spent the entirety of his career focused on studying drug treatments for children with autism  and 
other pervasive developmental disorders .   
 
18.3.  Inclusion  of Cognitively Impaired  
Written informed assent will be obtained from those subjects who have the cognitive ability to 
fully comprehend the document.  This will be primarily determined by [CONTACT_7078]/guardian report, as 
well as a qualified member of the research team, based on direct o bservation and clinical 
judgment.  Given that some of the children with autism and pervasive developmental disorders  
may have additional cognitive or communication deficits, it is possible that a few younger 
children will not be able to give assent.   Effor ts will be made to obtain informed assent from each 
child who is at least 11 years old.   
 
These efforts include the following steps:  
The subject’s parent or legal guardian will be asked whether  the child can read, sign their name, 
or reliably provide a y es/no answer to a question.   
Children who are able to read will be given the assent form to read and will likely be able to 
provide signed or verbal assent.    
If the child is unable to read, but the parent thinks the child is able to understand the assent form 
if read to him/her and then reliably provide a yes/no answer as to their assent, the assent will be 
read to them.    
If the parent is unsure as to the chil d’s ability to understand the assent form, we will attempt to 
read the assent to the child/adolescent unless it becomes clear to the investigator and parent that 
the subject is not listening or understanding.   5. Verbal assent or nonverbal gestures (noddin g 
head “yes” or shaking head “no”) will be acceptable if the parent agrees that this was a reliable 
response to the question.    
Assent will not be obtained in children where it would be unreasonable to do so because of the 
severity of their cognitive limit ations.    
Although verbal assent may be obtained with some children, it may not be possible to obtain 
written assent with those children,  as they may not be able to write their name [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or initials.  The 
process will be clearly documented by [CONTACT_340931].  
 
Only the parent or legal guardian will be asked to give consent on the behalf of the child.  The 
informed consent clearly states that if they agree to participate, they will allow their child to be a 
part of the research study.  Parents/legal guardians are told this verbally as well.  It is also 
explained verbally and in the consent that the study is completely voluntary and they can 
withdraw at any time  and for any reason.  
 
The parent/legal guardian will be asked to inform the child’s primary care physician.  In addition, 
the parent/legal guardian will be asked to provide authorization for release of information for 
V7 Revi sed 10/23/2018  Page 26 of 28 their child’s physician, so that addit ional information can be conveyed, as necessary, throughout 
the duration of the study.  
 
The research is not likely to interfere with ongoing therapy or regimens.  The study physician 
routinely obtains information regarding concomitant medications, therapie s, or regimens.  Parents 
are encouraged to maintain their child’s current, non -medical psychosocial tr eatments throughout 
the study.   In addition, all medications are carefully reviewed for any potential interactions with 
the study drug.  The study medicat ion has associated possible adverse effects.  However, there is 
a greater probability of direct benefit to the subject.

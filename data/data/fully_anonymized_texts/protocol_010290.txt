Official Title:  The effect of topi[INVESTIGATOR_24148]: [REMOVED]  
Document date:  12/19/2017  
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_24149], MD and Jeanelle Sheeder, PhD  
  
Proposal Narrative  
Objective:  To evaluate the pharmacokinetic effect of concomitant topi[INVESTIGATOR_24150] 
(ENG) contraceptive implant use.  
Specific Aims:  
1. To evaluate the drug -drug interaction between doses of topi[INVESTIGATOR_24151]  (100 -200mg  per day)  and the ENG contraceptive implant.  
2. To evaluate the drug -drug interaction between doses of topi[INVESTIGATOR_24152]  (400mg per day)  and the ENG contraceptive implant.  
3. To characterize whether any pharmacokinetic reductions in serum  ENG concentrations reach 
below the level needed to maintain ovulation suppression (<90pg/mL).  
Rationale:  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_24153] -epi[INVESTIGATOR_24154] -onset seizures and 
primary generalized tonic -clonic seizures.  However, i ts main use currently is for migraine prevention: 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_24155] a first -line treatment for migraine prophylaxis, along with B -blockers and 
valproate.[ADDRESS_23179] found no evidence supporting or contraindic ating the etonogestrel (ENG) 
contraceptive implant for birth control, and only scant evidence regarding drug -drug interactions 
between topi[INVESTIGATOR_24156] -containing combined oral contraceptives.  As topi[INVESTIGATOR_24157] a 
Pregnancy Class D drug, definit ive evidence of any potential decreased efficacy of the implant is 
imperative.  Conversely, reassuring evidence of stable ENG levels will broaden the contraceptive options 
for women using topi[INVESTIGATOR_052].  
Our recent study on the effect of carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_24158] a median 
decrease of 61% (range 25.4 -87.2) and 8/10 participants with concentrations <90pg/mL after the 
intervention.3 These findi ngs added to the limited data on the pharmacokinetic interactions between 
cytochrome P -450 3A4 enzyme inducers (CYP -3A4) and the ENG contraceptive implant, and will likely 
lead to a change in the US Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) for Contraceptive Use.  In the MEC, 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_24159] a broad category of “Anticonvulsant therapy” that have known CYP -3A4 
induction properties.[ADDRESS_23180] clinical 
implications . There are only two small published studies that investigated topi[INVESTIGATOR_052]'s pharmacokinetic 
effect on a combined oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]. Both studies found decreases in serum estrogen 
concentrations with concomitant topi[INVESTIGATOR_24160], but no significant phar macokinetic effect of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_24161].6,[ADDRESS_23181] that topi[INVESTIGATOR_052]’s pharmacokinetic effect on 
hormonal contraceptives differs significantly from carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], yet the MEC provides identica l 
recommendations for these medications.  Because women with chronic migraines already have limited 
contraceptive options, differentiating the actual interactions is crucial.  
 
Research design and methods  
Outcome Measure:  Serum etonogestrel concentrations m easured at baseline and then repeated after 
participants reach three titrated doses of topi[INVESTIGATOR_052]:  
• Visit 2 = 100mg per day  
• Visit 3 = 200mg per day  
• Visit 4 = 400mg per day  
Description of Population to be Enrolled:  
We aim to enroll subjects between 18-45 years old based on the following criteria:  
Inclusion Criteria:   Healthy women, who have had an ENG implant for 12 -36 months at the time of 
enrollment and will maintain their implant during the study without modifications.  
Exclusion Criteria:   We will exclude women who are taking any known cytochrome P -450 3A4 enzyme 
inducers or inhibitors. We will also exclude women with a body mass index (BMI) <18.5, as underweight 
women may have altered metabolism. We will not have an upper BMI cut -off as s tudies have shown 
that overweight and obese women have equivalent metabolism and efficacy with the ENG contraceptive 
implant.8,9 
We will also exclude women with any hepatic or renal dysfunction as determined by a comprehensive 
metabolic panel. For purposes  of this study, liver function tests will be evaluated and evidence of 
hepatic dysfunction will be defined as an ALT >[ADDRESS_23182] >39, which are beyond the reference range of 
normal values used by [CONTACT_24181]. Renal functio n will be assessed by a 
serum creatinine and a value >1.2 will be evidence of renal dysfunction as this is greater than the 
reference range used by [CONTACT_24181].  
We will also assess for any history of hepatic or renal dise ase to screen for diseases such as hepatitis, 
cirrhosis, kidney transplant, etc.  
We will also exclude women with a low serum bicarbonate on screening serum electrolytes due to 
potential increased risk for side -effects from topi[INVESTIGATOR_052]. We will use a cut -off of bicarbonate <[ADDRESS_23183] medical history and 
current medications to ensure study eligibility. If interested participants meet our non -laboratory 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, then they will undergo informed c onsent in a private clinic room.  
After the participant has been consented, we will perform a blood draw to obtain whole blood 
and serum. Appropriate blood samples will be sent to the University of Colorado Clinical Laboratory for a 
comprehensive metabolic panel. A blood sample for serum will be centrifuged on location and the 
serum collected for storage in our -80°F freezer. For participants that meet our laboratory exclusion 
criteria, we will ultimately measure a serum baseline ENG concentration from the s erum collected at the 
enrollment visit. The research team will then follow -up the comprehensive metabolic panel to 
determine final eligibility based on the criteria discussed above. Eligible participants will then be given 
the options of either returning t o our clinic to pi[INVESTIGATOR_24162].  
Participants will then begin a 6 week titration schedule of topi[INVESTIGATOR_24163] a max dose of 200mg 
bid by [CONTACT_24182]. Women with chronic mig raines are typi[INVESTIGATOR_24164] a dose of 100 or 
200mg/day, which will be achieved in the third and fourth week of titration, respectively. The maximum 
recommended dose of topi[INVESTIGATOR_24165] 400mg/day, which will be achieved in the 
sixth and final week of titration. All participants will return at the end of the third week of the 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_24166]. We will then draw blood from participants at this third week visit. An 
appropriate blood sample will be sent to the University  of Colorado Clinical Laboratory for topi[INVESTIGATOR_24167] a measurement of compliance. Serum obtained from this blood draw will be again 
stored in our -80°F freezer for eventual serum ENG concentration measurement. Participants will also 
undergo scree ning for adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) at this follow -up. Any 
participant experiencing an SAE will be removed from the study. Participants will then be given the next 
course of the study medication to continue the titration schedul e. 
All participants will return at the end of the fourth and sixth weeks to undergo identical study 
procedures as described for the third week visit. The final course of the study medication will be 
provided at the fourth week visit to continue the titrati on schedule through to the conclusion of the 
study. A topi[INVESTIGATOR_24168] a measure of study compliance and serum stored for 
eventual serum ENG concentration measurement. At the conclusion of enrollment, all stored serum 
samples will  be de -identified and assigned a random identification number (three letters) so that the 
laboratory is blinded to the timing of samples. We will then ship all samples to a [COMPANY_006]® laboratory for 
serum ENG concentration measurement. Batch analysis will be p erformed using a liquid 
chromatography mass -spectrometry method that has been previously validated. Participants will serve 
as their own controls for this study.  
Abrupt cessation of topi[INVESTIGATOR_24169]. It is unclear if this risk is present in healthy individuals taking 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], but we will have participants undergo a gradual withdrawal of topi[INVESTIGATOR_24170] 1 week after 
the final blood draw (end of 6 weeks). Partici pants will be given this withdrawal regimen at the final 
blood draw visit and undergo down -titration of their topi[INVESTIGATOR_24171] [ADDRESS_23184] of the implant has reinitiated before recommending resuming unprotected intercourse.  
All study visits will occur at the Comprehensive Women's Health Clinic in Lowry. This is our 
Family Planning site for both clinical and research visits. All consen t and enrollment processes will be 
conducted in a private clinic room and interested participants will be allowed as much time as needed to 
review the consent and ask any questions regarding the consent and study procedure.  
Treatment:  
Etonogestrel contrace ptive implant - All participants will have had an ENG implant for 12 -36 months at 
the time of enrollment and will maintain their implant during the study without modifications.  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] – Participants will undergo a 6 week titrated regimen of oral topi[INVESTIGATOR_24172] a 
maximum dose of 400mg per day, followed by a 7 -day withdrawal titration schedule, and 4 week 
abstinence/back -up period:  
Week 1: topi[INVESTIGATOR_24173] 25mg daily  
Week 2: topi[INVESTIGATOR_24173] 25mg twice daily  
Week 3: topi[INVESTIGATOR_24173] 50mg twice daily  
Week 4: t opi[INVESTIGATOR_24173] 100mg twice daily  
Week 5: topi[INVESTIGATOR_24173] 150mg twice daily  
Week 6: topi[INVESTIGATOR_24173] 200mg twice daily  
Week 7: withdrawal titration schedule – topi[INVESTIGATOR_24173] 100mg twice daily for 2 days, 100mg daily for 2 
days, 50mg daily for 2 days, 25mg daily for  1 day  
Week 8 – 11: abstinence/backup period  
 
Data Analysis Plan  
For this study, non -inferiority was defined as a change in serum ENG concentration that would 
not result in concentrations below the threshold for ovulatory suppression. We chose a non-inferiority 
limit of 30% because this level of decrease from the median published levels (157 -207pg/mL) does not 
cross the probably threshold for ovulatory suppression (90pg/mL). Based on the variance findings from 
our carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_24174] (SD = 67.7), we performed a sample size calculation with an alpha level of 0.05 
and a beta of 0.9 for our non -inferiority limit of 30%. We used a higher beta cut -off to account for the 
use of a statistical sample size calculation based on a normal distribution when ser um ENG 
concentrations has a known non -normal distribution. This calculation resulted in a sample size of 27 
women. We will enroll up to 53 women to account for a potential 49% drop -out/non -compliance rate, 
which accounts for an expected 30% intolerance rat e for topi[INVESTIGATOR_24175] >200mg/day.  Given that this 
will be a repeated measures study of non -parametric data, we will use a Friedman test for our analysis. 
We will use a p -value of <0.05 as a cut -off for statistical significance.

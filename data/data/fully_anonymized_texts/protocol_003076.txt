Study objectives 5The study objective is to demonstrate that as adjunctive therapy to 
(intravenous) IV antibiotics, BAY 41 -6551 400 mg (amikac in as 
free base) administered as an aerosol by [CONTACT_477720] 
12 hours is safe and more effective than placebo (aerosolized 
norm al saline) administered as an aerosol by [CONTACT_477721] 12 hours, in intubated and mechanically -ventilated pat ients 
with Gram -negative pneumonia. The primary efficacy variable is 
Survival as defined in Section 8.2.  The secondary objectives are to 
evaluate the superiority of aerosolized BAY 41 -6551 versus 
aerosolized placebo in pneumonia -related mortality, the Early 
Clinical Response at Day 10, the day s on ventilation, and the days 
in the ICU.
Safety endpoints 6The safety endpoints are to compare (BAY 41 -6551 vs aerosolized 
placebo, as adjunctive therapy to IV antibiotics in both arms) as 
measured by:
The frequency of adverse events (AEs)
The progression and incidence rates of organ failure
The all -cause mortality rate during therapy, at Day 15 and at 
Day 28(also the primary efficacy endpoint)
Patient population  7Randomized, adult patients (age 18 years) with a 
microbiologically -confirmed pneumonia caused by [CONTACT_6907] -negative 
organisms who received at least one dose of study drug and have an 
APACHE II score ≥ 10 at the time of diagnosis of pneumonia 
(modified Intent -to-Treat [mITT] population) will be analyzed in 
the primary efficacy analysis. 
Study design 8This is a prospective, randomized, double -blind, placebo -
controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
10 calendar day (20 doses) course of aerosolized BAY 41 -6551 400 
mg (amikacin as free base) every 12 hours versus aerosolized 
placebo (normal saline), as adjunctive therapy to IV antibiotics in 
both arms, in intubated and mechanically -ventilated patients w ith 
known or suspected Gram -negative pneumonia.  All patients will 
receive parenteral antibiotics with cons ideration to include 2 
antibiotics as per the 2005 ATS/IDSA guidelines for 10 days. 
Patients who are extubated before completing the full course 
(10calendar days if the first dose is administered in the AM or 
11calendar days if the first dose is administ ered in the PM 
[20doses]) of aerosol therapy will be continued on aerosolized 
therapy with the handheld adaptor. (Section 8.2)

Methodology 10Eighteen to 22 days after completing 10 days of aerosolized 
treatment, patients will be evaluated for Survival. Patients who 
survive through the late follow up visit are considered a success, 
patients who suffer mortality for any reason on or before the Late 
Follow -up (LFU )visit are considered a failure .
Efficacy variables 11The primary efficacy variable will be Survival in the mITT 
population (ie, the ITT population who prove to be culture positive 
for a Gram -negative pathogen and have an APACHE II score ≥ 
10).  Survival is achieved when the patient is documented as alive 
through the LFU visit.
The secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of BAY 
41-6551 (versus aerosolized placebo), as adjunctive therapy to IV 
antibiotics in both arms, as measured by:
Pneumonia -related mortality to the LFU visit
Early Clinical Response based on CPIS scores, the presence 
of empyema or lung abscess, and all -cause mortality through 
Day 10
The number of days on mechanical ventilation through the 
LFU visit (Day 28 -32)
The number of ICU days assessed at the LFU visit (Day 28 -
32)
Thre e additional analysis of clinical success will be conducted.
Clinical success using the 
Foundation for the National 
Institute of Health (FNIH) recommendation sisdefined as 
mITT patients who survived through the LFU visit and did 
not have septic shock .
Investigator Assessment of Patient Outcome will be
determined at the TOC visit (Day 17-19).The investigator 
will assess patient signs and symptoms at the TOC visit .
Clinical Success 
will be evaluated using 5 component 
criteria, w hich were the former primary end point for this 
study . 
Microbiology variables 12Secondary microbiological objectives will include comparisons 
(aerosolized BAY 41 -6551 versus aerosolized placebo), as 
adjunctive therapy to IV antibiotics in both arms, of the:
per pathogen microbiological response rates at the TOC visit
per patient microbiological response rate at the TOC visit
microbiological recurrence rates at the TOC and LFU visits
emergence of new respi[INVESTIGATOR_477590], Days 1 -10
emergence of resistance among baseline pathogens in those 
patients with persistent infection or colonization

29 Aug 2017 Version 9.0 Page: 9of [ADDRESS_612698] one dose of the study 
drug(s) will be evaluated for safety in a descriptive manner.  The 
safety analysis will include tabulation of the type (using Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA] glossary) and 
frequency of all AEs.  Drug -related AEs, serious AEs (SAEs), and 
premature discontinuations due to AEs will also be summarized, as 
well as AEs by [CONTACT_926], outcome, and action taken.
Incidence tables will be presented for all AEs up to seven days after 
the end of treatment and for SAEs up to Day 28 visit.
All laboratory data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics 
including identification of laboratory data outside normal ranges.
Rates of organ failure w ill also be summarized by [CONTACT_477722] w ell as 
by [CONTACT_477723]. 
Mortality during the treatment period, and on Day 15 and Day 28 
visit will be summarized. 
Number of study centers 13Approximately 130 study centers in North America, South 
America, Asia Pacific, and Europe.
Total number of patients 14Approximately a combined total of 724 ITT patients will be 
recruited to this study and to study [ZIP_CODE] (being conducted in 
different countries; the protocols are identical with the exception 
that study [ZIP_CODE] has a pharmacokinetic substudy).  The 724 total 
patients will be recruited competitively between studies [ZIP_CODE] and 
[ZIP_CODE]; there are no minimum requirements for recruitment t otals in 
either study.   The patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either 
400 mg BAY 41 -6551 (amikacin as free base) every 12 hours or 
aerosolized placebo every 12 hours in addition to ATS/IDSA 
guided IV antibiotic therapy to allow  for completion of a t least 
472evaluable mITT patients in the primary efficacy analysis.

5. Introduction
5.1 Background and Rationale -amended
Amikacin is a well -known aminogl ycoside antibiotic used intravenousl y (IV) or 
intramuscularl y (IM) for the treatment of infections caused b y Gram -negative bacteria.  Its 
spectrum of activity  makes it suitable for use in nosocomial pneumonia patients where 
Gram -negative organisms are major pathogens.  It has been administered and studied at 
several clinical centers as an aerosol treatm ent in patients with chronic, suppurative lung 
disease such as cy stic fibrosis and bronchiectasis.1, 2  Several reports describe the use of 
aerosolized antibiotics, such as amikacin, as adjuncts to the therap y of ventilated patients with 
deep lung infections, specificall y ventilator -associated pneumonia (VAP)3and 
tracheobronchitis.[ADDRESS_612704] 
been hampered b y the low efficiency  of pulmonary  drug delivery  when using conventional 
nebulizers connected to ventilator circuits.
16Inhalation delivery  of BAY 41
-6551 (amikacin solution for inhalation) offers an attractive 
addition to I Vor IM delivery .  Inhalation administration minimizes sy stemic exposure while 
delivering drug directly  to the site of infection.  Bay er is investigating the use of aerosolized 
BAY 41 -6551 for the treatment of serious bacterial respi[INVESTIGATOR_477599] -ventilated patients using a proprietary  high efficiency  Pulmonary  Drug 
Delivery  System (PDDS Clinical).
The 2005 American Thoracic Societ y (ATS) / Infectious Diseases Socie ty of America (IDSA) 
guidelines combine hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-acquired pneumonia (HAP), VAP, and healthcare- associated 
pneumonia (HCAP) in the same spectrum of disease, and recommend therapy  for patients 
with these diseases who have risk factors for multidrug- resistant (MDR) pathogens.[ADDRESS_612705] common nosocomial infections 
and represent the lea ding cause of death from infections that are acquired in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  The 
incidence of nosocomial pneumonia (NP) ranges from five to ten cases per 1,000 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_477600], but increases six -to twenty -fold in 
intensive care unit (I CU) patients who are receiving mechanical ventilation.6  The duration of 
stay in the ICU and the duration of mechanical ventilati on are the major predisposing factors 
for acquiring NP.  Ventilator
-associated pneumonia is a severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_477601] y in the range of 25% to 50% 7, 8despi[INVESTIGATOR_126340]-spectrum antibiotic therap y.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -acquired pneumonia, VAP, and HCAP are major causes of morb idity and mortalit y 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_477602] y, supportive care, and preventative measures.  
Ventilator -associated pneumonia complicates the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_477603] 8% to 28% of patients 
who require mechanical ventilation and the risk increases w ith increasing time on the

ventilator.7  Gram -negative pathogens are causative organisms in approximately  60% of 
cases.7  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -acquired pneumonia accounts for up to 25% of all ICU infections (90% of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_477604]), with an a ssociated mortality  estimated 
to be between 33% and 50%.9Additionally , the rates of HAP due to MDR organisms have 
increased significantl y in the I CU.[ADDRESS_612706] 6 d ays of treatment.11
,45Prolonged therapy  (14 
to 21 day s) leads to colonization of antibiotic -resistant bacteria, which may precede a 
recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_477605].  Others have shown that treatment courses as short as 3 day s 
(versus 10 to 21 day s) resulted in better clinical outcomes; however , many of these patients 
may not have had pneumonia.12  Finally , a multicenter randomized controlled trial 
demonstrated that initial empi[INVESTIGATOR_477606] 8 day s had similar outcomes versus 
treatment for 14 day s; however, a trend to greater rates of relapse for short
-duration therap y 
was seen if the causative organism was P.aeruginosa or an Acinetobacter species.13  In 
summary , if patients receive an initially  appropriate antibiotic regimen, efforts should be 
made to shorten the duration of therap y from the traditional 14 to 21 day s to perio
ds as short 
as 7days, provided that the etiologic pathogen is not P.aeruginosa, and that the patient has a 
good clinical response with resolution of clinical features of infection.
While Gram -negative organisms can be treated with I V aminogl ycoside antibi otics, 
parenteral delivery  can cause significant adverse sy stemic side effects (eg, neurotoxicity , 
nephrotoxicity , and ototoxicity ) and results in poor penetration of drug into respi[INVESTIGATOR_477607]. [ADDRESS_612707] pneumatic (jet) nebulizers 
deliver less than 10% of the nominal dose to the patient’s lungs due to high residual drug 
volumes, los s of drug in the ventilator circuit and endotracheal tube, and loss to the 
atmosphere via the expi[INVESTIGATOR_477608].17,[ADDRESS_612708], the PDDS Clinical is designed to deliver 
approximately  50% of the nominal dose to the lungs, based on in vitro data for both the on-
ventilator and handheld (off -ventilator) configurations (data on file, [COMPANY_001] Report No. 
IDD061A_TESTR_699- ProdSpecStudy _01, May 2012).
17This clinical study  will evaluate the Survival rate of patients treated with aerosolized 
amikacin, administered via PDDS Clinical, to that of aerosolized placebo (normal saline 
solution), as adjunctive therap y to IV antibiotics in both arms, in patients with 
microbiologicall y
-confirmed Gram -negative pneumonia.  The PDDS Clinical is expected to

system.  The study  will also provide information on the safet y and tolerability of aerosolized 
amikacin.
5.2 Risk Factors
The incidence of NP is associated with many  factors, with mechanical ventilation and the 
duration of ventilation being primary  causes of HAP, VAP, or HCAP occurrence.  NPwas 
associated with mechanical ventilation in 86% of cases in one study , and the risk for 
acquiring VAP increased from 5% in patients who received mechanical ventilation for 5 days 
to over 69% for patients who received mechanical ventilation for 30 days.10, 20  Other risk 
factors included witnessed aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], use of paraly tic agents, and a primary  admitting 
diagnosis of burns, trauma, or disease of the central nervous, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] , or cardiac s ystems.21
5.3 Bacteriology
The identification of microorganisms reported to be responsible for HAP, VAP, and HCAP 
varied substantially  across different institutions, and was affected b y factors such as 
underly ing disease, pre vious antibiotic use, diagnostic methods, and local patterns of 
antibiotic -resistant organisms.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -associated pneumonia, VAP, and HCAP may  be 
attributed to multiple organisms.  Gram
-positive microorganisms isolated in patients with 
VAP included:  Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococci .  Gram -
negative microorganisms isolated in VAP patients included:  Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 
Haemophilus influenzae ,Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Proteus 
species, Serratia species, Citrobacter species, Hafnia alvei ,Acinetobacter baumannii, 
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia , and Burkholderia cepacia.7, 22-24
Current therapeutic management strategies for adults with HAP, VAP and HCAP are based 
on the 2005 ATS/I DSA guidelines.5
5.4 Aerosolized Antibiotic Therapy
5.4.1 Animal Studies
Accumulation of amikaci n was observed in the rat lung after 14 consecutive day s of nose -
only inhalation exposure ranging from 20 to 109 mg/kg/day  total inhaled nebulized amikacin 
(data on file, Bay er Report PH [ZIP_CODE], AT06142).  Amikacin (548 μg/g1.13) was detected 
in lung tissue, but not plasma after a [ADDRESS_612710] level 
(NOAEL) was not established in regard to local effects to the respi[INVESTIGATOR_477609] e rat.
Recently , Goldstein 25studied the administration of 45 mg/kg nebulized amikacin in pi[INVESTIGATOR_477610] 
E. coli pneumonia.  Amikacin concentrations in lung tissue 
homogenates were influenced b y the severit y of the lung lesions.  Amikacin concentration in 
“mild” areas of pneumonia averaged 188 175 µg/g, while in “severe” areas it averaged 40 
65µg/g.  In all cases, lung tissue levels were lower than those previousl y seen by [CONTACT_477725][INVESTIGATOR_1515].  Nonetheless, nebulized amikacin resulted in lung tissue

concentrations much higher (up to 30 times) than those resulting fro m the IV infusion of 
15mg/kg amikacin.  In addition, lung tissue concentrations exceeded the minimum inhibitory  
concentrations (MI Cs) of common respi[INVESTIGATOR_477611] 71% of the lung specimens 
cultured were negative for bacteria versus 16% in the IV gr oup.  These investigators had also 
demonstrated a lack of lung tissue or s ystemic accumulation with four day s of repeat aerosol 
dosing of amikacin in the same pi[INVESTIGATOR_477612] E. coli
pneumonia.26  Noting that only  half of the dose nominally  administered to the lung was 
eliminated in the urine, the lack of lung tissue accumulation was attributed to removal by 
[CONTACT_477726]/or phy siologic mucociliary  clearance. 
5.4.[ADDRESS_612711] been investigated in clinical studies for t he 
prevention and treatment of pneumonia in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643].3,24  The advantages of 
inhalation therap y include delivery of high doses directly to the site of infection and low 
systemic exposure with the potential for reducing sy stemic adverse events (AEs) such as 
neurotoxicity , nephrotoxicity , and ototoxicity .27
-30  To date, only  tobram ycin for inhalation 
(TOBI®) is approved in the [LOCATION_002] for inhalational administration and labeled 
specificall y for the management of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in patients with 
cystic fibrosis.  TOBI®is not approved for the therapy  of acute pulmonary  exacerbati ons of 
cystic fibrosis.  TOBI® is also approved in Europe for the treatment of cy stic fibrosis.
Though their use in aerosolized form has not been approved b y the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA), limited clinical and scientific testing of nebulized antib iotics has been 
conducted to determine and evaluate the pharmacokinetics and potential effectiveness of 
these agents in aerosolized form.  These agents, however, have not been evaluated for safet y 
or effectiveness in randomized, controlled studies.3, 31-[ADDRESS_612712] on

The BAY 41 -6551 and PDDS Clinical safety  experience is based on the fiv e completed 
studies: AMI K-02- 01, AMI K -04-02, 06- IN-AK003, 06 -IN-AK004, and 06 -IN-AK005 (data 
on file, Bay er Report Number RD00002318.00). 
The first study  (a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] , AMIK -02-01) compared delivery  of BAY 41 -6551 via an earl y 
prototy pe of the PDDS Clini cal versus Nektar’s marketed critical care nebulizer, the Aeroneb 
Pro®(AP), and the AirLife™ Misty  Neb™ (MN), a pneumatic nebulizer, in mechanically -
ventilated patients.  Twelve patients on volume
-cycled ventilation were enrolled to receive 
125mg/mL  sulfite-free BAY 41- 6551 on separate study  days (2 day s washout) in 
randomized order: [ADDRESS_612713] delivery  efficiency  (approximately  60%) to the lungs and was, therefore, selected for 
future clinical studies.
All treatments were considered b y the investigator to be well tolerated.  Three patients 
experienced wheezing.  None of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_477613] -to-plateau difference in airway  pressure, a 
measure of airway s resistance, and none required treatment interruption.  There were no 
serious drug -or device -related AEs.
A Phase II stud y (AMIK-04-02) of aerosolized BAY 41- 6551 in intubated and mechanically -
ventilated patients with VAP, HAP, or HCAP has also been completed.  Eligible patients 
were randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion to receive either aerosolized BAY 41
-6551 (400 mg or 
800mg) or pl acebo q [ADDRESS_612714] one dose of study  
medication.  Pharmacokinetic sampling for BAY 41-6551 levels in tracheal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026] , serum, 
and urine were obtained on Day  1 and Day 3 during the treatment period.  Efficacy  and safet y 
variables were also measured.  A total of 25 serious AEs (SAEs) were reported.  One SAE 
was classified b y the Principal Investigator (PI) as possibly  related to study  medication.  
Upon unblinding, this patient had been assigned to the placebo group.  No SAEs were 
reported as probabl y related to study  medication or to the PDDS Clinical regardless of 
treatment group.  Based on the results of this trial the do se of 400 mg (amikacin as a free 
base) every  12 hours was chosen for further development in Phase III.

adjunctive therap y to IV antibiotics, in intubated and mechanically -ventilated patients with 
Gram -negative pneumonia.  The safety  and tolerability  of aerosolized BAY 41 -6551 and the 
microbiological endpoints will also be evaluated. Patients who are extubated before 
completing the full course ([ADDRESS_612716] dose is administered in the PM [20 doses, Section 8.2]) of aerosol

doses to be used in patients with normal renal and hepati c function.  Intravenous antibiotic 
treatment will be administered during the entire period of aerosol treatment.[ADDRESS_612718] met all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be 
stratified by  [CONTACT_1617] (or country ) and disease severit y using the Acute Physiology 
and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score (Stratum I: APACHE II score < 20; 
Stratum II: APACHE II score ≥ 20) and  randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment 
groups:  standard of care IV antibiotics with aerosolized BAY 41 -6551 400 mg (amikacin as 
a free base) every  [ADDRESS_612719] of care IV antibiot ics without aerosolized BAY 41 -
6551 (aerosolized placebo every 12 hours).  The APACHE II score (Section 15.5) that will be 
used to stratify  the patient is the score calculated at the time the patient is evaluated for entry  
into the study  and a diagnosis of Gram -negative pneumonia is considered.  Values used to 
calculate the APACHE II score (e.g. temperature, WBC counts, etc.) may  be obtained at an y 
time during the 48- hour screening period 25.  Regardless of the treatment group, the duration 
of all therap y will be 10 -12 full day s, as described.  
Patients will receive 20 doses of aerosol treatment at 12- hour intervals.  Twenty  doses of 
aerosol treatment correspond to 10 calendar day s.  When aerosol treatment begins with a 
“morning dose (AM)” the last dose (“evening dose” [PM]) will be given on the tenth day .  
Alternativel y, if the first dose of aerosol treatment is an “evening dose” (and thus only one 
dose can be given o n the first calendar day ) the last aerosol treatment will be given as a 
“morning dose” on the eleventh calendar day . 
Aerosolized study  drug treatment and IV antibiotic treatment will both be administered for [ADDRESS_612720] ered in parallel.  However, the protocol allows 
beginning empi[INVESTIGATOR_477618]- negative pneumonia 0 -48 hours before 
start of aerosolized study drug (Section 8.3.2).  As a result, IV antibiotic therapy  may  extend

[IP_ADDRESS] Reasons for Premature Discontinuation of Study Drug -amended
Since study  drug is provided only as an adjunctive therapy  and not the primary  treatment for 
the patient’s Gram -negative pneumonia, every  effort should be made to allow patients to 
complete a full course of inhaled study  drug to determine the impact of adjunctive therap y on 
the course of Gram -negative pneumonia.  However, several reasons may  exist to discontinue 
study  drug.
AE(s)
Absence of a Gram -negative organism in a pre -therapy  respi[INVESTIGATOR_477627] 44
Clinical failure (ie, lack of therapeutic effect)
Non-adherence to study  regimen
Death
Lost to follow -up
Withdrawal of consent

negative pneumonia with consideration to include 2 antibiotics as per the 2005 ATS/ I DSA 
Guidelines, plus aerosolized BAY 41 -6551 or aerosolized placebo (Section 8.2).  If the 
patient develops a new infection, other than pneumonia, while on the aerosol treatment the 
patient will continue in the study .
Each inhal ation or aerosol dose will be administered via the PDDS Clinical (instruction 
manual provided).  If a patient is subsequently
 extubated, the aerosol treatment will be 
continued via the handheld adaptor for the remainder of the [ADDRESS_612726] clinical signs and sy mptoms of 
pneumonia.  The clinical signs and s ymptoms of pneumonia will be documented on the CRF 
as will the reason(s) for continuation of I V treatment past the treatment period.  Aerosol 
treatment will not extend bey ond 10 full day s corresponding to 20 doses (Section 8.2).
The administration of aerosolized antibiotics other than the aerosol stud y medication is 
prohibited.
The use of an IV aminogly coside during the treatment period will be permitted; however, the 
only amino glycoside allowed will be amikacin.  This will simplify aminoglycoside trough 
serum level monitoring, if an IV aminogl ycoside is used with the aerosol study drug.  The 
monitoring of a single aminogly coside (amikacin) will allow for safer use of IV therapy ,if IV 
aminogl ycoside therap y is required.  
Tobram ycin, gentamicin, and netelmicin will not be permitted as part of IV antibiotic therap y.  
This is a slight deviation from the 2005 ATS/IDSA guidelines and has been instituted in this 
protocol as a safeguar d for patients.

(2) antibiotics, as per the 2005 ATS/I DSA Guidelines, for treating patients at risk for MDR 
Gram -negative pathogens ( Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3below for further guidance).  
Bearing in mind these Guidelines, empi[INVESTIGATOR_477631] y should be chosen to have 
activity  against common circulating pathogens in the setting where the patient is being treated 
based on local resistance patterns.  If the susceptibilities of the infecting Gram- negative 
pathogens are known at the time that the patient is randomized, then IV antibiotics may  be 
targeted accordingl y.

Patients at risk for infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, Klebsiella 
pneumoniae, Enterobacter species, and methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 
should initially  receive combination therapy  that can provide a broad spectrum of coverage to 
minimize the potential for initial inadequate antibiotic treatment.  In the therap y of suspected 
pseudomonal infection, therap y should include a selected -lactam plus either an 
antipseudomonal quinolone or an aminogl ycoside. (Note: The onl y IV aminogl ycoside 
permitted in this protocol is amikacin.)  The choice of agents should be based on factors 
mentioned above in Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 and not repeat the same antimicrobial class, if possible.

(125 mg/mL) in BAY 41 -6551 Solution (Amikacin I nhalation Solution).  Aerosolized therap y 
will begin within 48 hours53of the initiation of I V antibiotics for Gram -negative pneumonia.  
For the purposes of thi s study , a day  is defined as a single 24 -hour period, during which two 
consecutive stud y medication treatments are scheduled.  All study medication will be 
delivered to the ICU or the unit where the patient may be located in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_477638] /study  staff and provided to the investigational staff in blinded vials containing an 
excess of liquid to ensure an extractable volume of 3.2 mL (400 mg, amikacin as free base).  
The staff will be instructed to remove the metal top from the vial and pour th e contents of the

Dosing will be administered only  after the investigator or a designated Sub- investigator has 
reviewed the patient’s serum creatinine levels (serum creatinine levels should be obtained 
once dail y and the results available and reviewed prior to the next dose).
8.4.6 Dose Modification
[IP_ADDRESS] Renal Impairment - amended
Dosing for both IV and aerosol treatments may  require modification based on the patient’s 
renal function as measured by  [CONTACT_477736].  I t may  also be necessary  to 
modify  the dosage regimen of aerosol therap y if there is evidence of bronchospasm during 
administration of the aerosol drug.  Dosage modifications described are not considered 
protocol deviations and IV therap y should follow the recommendations set forth in the 
approved package labeling.
Serum creatinine levels should be obtained once daily  and the results available and reviewed 
prior to the next dose. Patients with a serum creatinine 2 mg/dL ( 177 µmol/L), will not 
receive the aerosol study  drug treatment.  Patients with a serum creatinine  2 mg/dL 
(177µmol/L) and receiving continuous renal replacement therap y (CVVH and C VVH- D) 
or daily  hemodialy sis will receive aerosol study  drug treatment.  Intravenous therapy  should 
be modified according to the instructions in the manufacturer’s approved product label.  If the 
patient is receiving IV amikacin therap y, serum amikacin lev els should be monitored with the 
objective of achieving trough serum concentrations no greater than 4 -5µg/mL .
Dosing of the aerosol therap y will be interrupted for patients with a urine output of 
< 0.5 mL/kg/h for two consecutive hours.  If urine output f alls below this level, the serum 
creatinine should be (re)checked immediatel y.  Dosing of the aerosol therapy may be resumed 
after urine output is  0.5mL/kg/h and the serum creatinine is 2mg/dL(177µmol/L ).

8.5 Pulmonary Drug Delivery System (PDDS Clinical)
8.5.1 Identity of Device -amended
The PDDS Clinical is a single patient, single
-dose drug delivery  system, designed to deliv er 
aerosolized medication for patients during mechanical ventilation and after extubation in the 
course of clinical investigation.  The PDDS Clinical will be used with the inline T -pi[INVESTIGATOR_477641] (Section 15.2, Figure 1 and Figure 2) 
and in a handheld adaptor for use post -extubation (Section 15.2, Figure 3).  The PDDS 
Clinical nebulizer/reservoi r contains Nektar’s Proprietary  Aerosol Generator, which delivers 
a fine -particle aerosol. 
The PDDS Clinical control module is microprocessor
-driven and utilizes a pressure 
transducer to monitor changes in airway  pressure thus to identify  inspi[INVESTIGATOR_477642] .  The 
microprocessor delivers aerosol during the first 75% of the inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  L imiting aerosol 
formation to the first 75% of the inspi[INVESTIGATOR_477643].  By  [CONTACT_22242], the PDDS Clinical is designed to deliver 
approximately  50% of the nominal dose to the lungs, based on in vitro data for both the on-
ventilator and handheld (off -ventilator) configurations (data on file, [COMPANY_001] Report No. 
IDD061A_TESTR_699- ProdSpecStudy _01, May 2012).  The dosing is approximately  20 to 
55 minutes for intubated and mechanically- ventilated patients, and approximately  10 to 25 
minutes in non -intubated patients.  Nebulization time can vary  depending on the patient’s

minute ventilation and the nebulizer flow rate output.  Nebulization times not within this 
approximate window are not considered a protocol deviation. 56
The PDDS Clinical handheld configuration consists of a PDDS Clinical nebulizer reservoir, 
aerosol chamber, mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_259209]  (including an expi[INVESTIGATOR_477644] a flow restrictor), 
system cable, and a control module to provide electrical signals to the nebulizer.  
The handheld configuration functions in the following way s:
The nebulizer is alway s on, pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_477645].
The patient can use the handheld with a mouth pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959], self- sealing anesthesia mask, 
or adapted for a patient that is trached and is spontaneously  breathing57
The base of the aerosol chamber serves as a collection chamber for ox ygen (if 
necessary ). 
The accumulated aerosol bolus is delivered to the patient upon inhalation.
Oxygen, if needed, enters the bottom of the aerosol chamber through the one -way 
inhalation valve followed by  [CONTACT_477737].
During exhalation, the one- way inhalation valve at the bottom of the aerosol 
chamber is forced closed and gas expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697] b y the patient is routed through the flow 
restrictor and filtered prior to introduction into the environme nt.
Nebulized aerosol continues to collect in the aerosol chamber during exhalation.
If an inspi[INVESTIGATOR_477646] [ADDRESS_612733] demonstrated less than 3% of the nominal dose 
has been detected in the expi[INVESTIGATOR_477647] -Vent configuration

Potential study  patients will be recruited b y the study  staff among hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9645] a 
clinical diagnosis of pneumonia who have been intubated and mechanically -ventilated 
(patients who have had a tracheotom y ma y be considered as possible stud y participants). 
Written informed consent will be obtained from the patient or an authorized representative 
prior to performing screening assessments.  However, standard of care procedures may  be 
used to pre -screen the patient for study  eligibility  provided that the appropriate evaluations 
are done within two day s of beginning treatment with stud y medication.  
During the Screening Period the following assessments and procedures will be performed: 
Evaluate compliance with all inclusion and exclusion criteria 
Complete medical/surgical and medication history 
Complete phy sical examination, including vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842], temperature), height and weight.  The daily maximum temperature 
will be recorded. 
Chest X -ray (CXR) 
NOTE :  the reading and interpretation of the CXR by  [CONTACT_1755]/or sub-
investigator(s) at the Screening Visit can be used to determine the patient's 
eligibility  for inclusion; however, the radiology  report (ie, the reading and 
interpretation of the CXR by  [CONTACT_477741]) will be the "official" read ing 
recorded on the CRF and used for the determination of evaluability .  The 
radiologist will remain blinded to the treatment assignment of the patient. 
Urine or serum -hCG pregnancy  test for all women of child -bearing potential.  A 
negative test result must be received before stud y medication may  be given.  Any  
patient with a positive pregnancy
 test result at screening will be excluded from the 
study .

aerosolized placebo61) is given.  Day  1 may  be the same day  as when the informed consent 
form (ICF) is signed, screening assessments are performed, and the patient is enrolled.
Prior to the first dose, each patient will receive a PDDS Clinical device consisting 
of a control module, T -pi[INVESTIGATOR_477652], alternating current/direct current ( AC/DC )
adaptor, air pressure feedback device, and cable (Section 8.5).
Patients will be started on aerosolized study  medication within 48 hours62of IV 
antibiotic therap y being initiated for Gram -negative pneumonia.  Patients will 
receive 3.2 mL of either BAY 41
-6551 (400 mg [amikacin as free base]) or 
placebo solution every  12 hours (a window of ± 4 hours is acceptable) via the 
PDDS Clinical for 10 full calendar day s (20 doses) (Section 8.2).  If a patient is 
extubated during the course of treatment or has a tracheostom y and is 
spontaneously  brea thing, aerosol administration will continue via the handheld 
adaptor for the remainder of the treatment period.

9.6 Study Measurements
The objective of this study  is to evaluate the efficacy  and safet y of adjunctive aerosolized 
BAY 41 -6551 in the treatment of intubated and mechanically- ventilated adult patients with 
Gram -negative pneumonia.  
9.6.1 Efficacy Variables –amended
[IP_ADDRESS] Prim ary Efficacy Variable:  Survival -amended
74The primary  efficacy  variable is Survival , which is determined b ytabulating the cumulative 
mortality  and survival through the LFU visit for each mITT patient. Survival (and mortality ) 
is the only  criteria evaluated for the primary  endpoint, no other factors are considered other 
than survival status through the LFU visit.
[IP_ADDRESS] Additional 
Analysis of Clinical Success -amended
75There are three additional anal yses of clinical success. These three analy sesare separate 
from the primary  endpoint. The three analysesare (1) the FNIH recommendations f or an 
endpoint based on mortality  plus septic shock, (2) the I nvestigator’s assessment of Patient 
Outcome, and (3) the Composite Endpoint Evaluation (the previous Primary  Endpoint) .

77The investigators will also assess patient outcome based on a composite endpoint. The 
Investigator Assessment of Patient Outcome is separate and different from the primary  
endpoint of Survival , which is done b y using a computer algorithm based on collected data 
and specific criteria.  The I nvestigator Assessment of Patient Outcome is based on the 
following criteria:
CPIS assessed at baseline, Day s 3, 5, 10, and the TOC visit
All-cause mortalit y assessed through the TOC visit
Systemic antibacterial use for the current epi[INVESTIGATOR_477657]  10 (the 
EOT for aerosol administration)
Antibi otic adjustments made during therap y
[IP_ADDRESS].2.1 End of Therapy (Day 10)
78The Investigator Assessment of Patient Outcome will be evaluated at the EOT visit using 
the following terms and definition.  
Investigator Assessment of Patient Outcome -Cure :
Improvement or lack of progression of all abnormalities associated with 
pneumonia on chest radiograph;
Resolution towards normal of the following components of the CPI S -tracheal 
secretions (volume and purulence), temperature, blood leukocy tes, oxy genation 
(PaO 2/FiO 2);
NOTE: “resolution towards normal”, as used in this definition, is intended to 
mean that the components of the CPI S may  not be within normal limits (e.g., 
continuing low -grade fever or leukocy tosis in an ICU patient); however, in the

significant in the context of resolving pneumonia.
The patient never reached any of the earl y failure criteria AND
The patient survived through the EOT visit
NOTE: All four conditions listed above must b e met in order for the Investigator Assessment 
of Patient Outcome to be a cure.
Investigator Assessment of Patient Outcome -Failure :
Rise in the CPI S by [CONTACT_2669] 2 points on Day  3;
Failure of the CPIS to drop at least 1 point on Day  5;

the following terms and definitions:
Investigator Assessment of Patient Outcome -Cure: 
Improvement or lack of progression of all abnormalities associated with  
pneumonia on chest radiograph ;
Resolution towards normal of the following components of the CPI S -tracheal

NOTE :  If any one of the above conditions is met, the I nvestigator Assessment of Patient 
Outcome is a failure.
At Day  10 (End of Therapy ), the criteria to determine whether IV antibiotics need to be 
continued will be an assessment of clinical signs and sy mptoms of pneumonia.  Specificall y, 
this evaluation will consider temperature (oCor oF), blood leukocy te (WBC) count 
(cells/mm3) with differential (including % neutrophils), oxy genation (PaO 2/FiO 2) (mm Hg), 
volume and appearance of tracheal secretions (few, moderate, large, pu rulent) and chest 
radiograph y (no infiltrate, patchy or diffuse infiltrate, localized infiltrate).  
At Day  10, corresponding to the completion of 20 doses (EOT), patient outcome of failure 
will be defined as a failure to decrease the CPI S by 2 points.  Th ere may  be instances at Day  
10 where, if the CPI S falls by  [CONTACT_726] 2 points, there could still be reasons to continue IV 
antibiotic therap y and also instances where the score could fail to fall by [CONTACT_726] 2 points 
and antibiotic therap y might be discontinued.  In both instances of such patient outcome 
failure, the reasons for co ntinuing or discontinuing antibiotic therap y will be specified in the 
CRF.
A patient outcome of failure will be carried through the LFU visit evaluation.

[IP_ADDRESS].2.3Late Follow-up Visit (Days 28 – 32) – amended
84The Investigator Assessment of Patient Outcome will be evaluated at the LFU visit.  As 
mentioned previously , a patient evaluated at the TOC visit as a patient outcome failure will 
have that response carried forward to the LFU visit. 
For patients who were evaluated at the TOC visit as a patient outcome cure, t heir clinical 
response will be graded as:
Continued Investigator Assessment of Patient Outcome Cure: continued resolution of 
clinical signs and s ymptoms of pneumonia and continued improvement or lack of progression 
of all abnormalities on chest radiograph such that additional antibiotic therapy to treat 
pneumonia is not required. 
Relapse: reappearance of the signs and sy mptoms of pneumonia and worsening or 
progression of abnormalities on chest radiograph such that alternative antibiotic therap y is 
required .
[IP_ADDRESS].2.4 Premature Discontinuation Visit -amended
85A patient may  not complete a full 10 -day (20doses) course of study  drug treatment or may  
not reach the TOC visit (Day s 17- 19).  These patients may  prematurely  discontinue therapy  
because they  are failing study  treatment and alternative antibiotic therap y is required, while 
others may  discontinue study  medication because of an AE, protocol violation or other 
reasons as noted in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  Alternative antibiotic therapy  may  or may  not be 
required.
For a patient outcome failure (ie, stud y drug therapy is discontinued because of a lack of 
therapeutic effect), the evaluation of the patient’s clinical con dition should be based on the 
clinical signs and s ymptoms of pneumonia as well as objective evidence of failure (eg, 
persistent fever, rising WBC count, increasing tracheal secretions, poor ox ygenation, 
progression of infiltrate on CXR) and a measure of th eir CPI S.  This information should be 
recorded on the CRF, as well as an evaluation of the patient’s clinical response to study  drug.  
In most cases, the decision to evaluate the patient as a Clinical Failure will be made after at 
least 72 hours of stud y medication, but in rare instances, the clinical course of the illness may  
require that stud y medication be discontinued prior to three days treatment and alternative 
antibiotic therap y started.  Regardless of when the patient is prematurel
y discontinued, th e 
clinical condition of the patient should be determined at the time of study  drug 
discontinuation, recorded on the CRF, and a clinical response evaluation completed.
At the premature discontinuation visit, the patient’s outcome will be assessed according to the 
following terms and definitions.

NOTE: At least one of the above conditions is necessary to consider a patient a patient
outcome failure.
In the case of the patient who has discontinued study  drug for another reason (eg, AE,

to treatment at the point they  are discontinued.  This assessment would be recorded on the 
CRF and include a determination of their clinical signs and s ymptoms of pneumonia and a 
measure of their CPI S.
Clinical Improvement: reduction in the severity  and/or number of clinical signs and 
symptoms of pneumonia and alternative antibiotic therap y is considered and may or may not 
be initiated.
Indeterminate:   not possible to determine clinical response to treatment (eg, withdrawal after 
less than three day s of study  drug therap y due to an AE).  The reason(s) for an i
ndeterminate

11. Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample S ize
11.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
11.1.1 Analysis Populations -amended
The two populations used for anal ysis will be the mI TTpopulation and the I TT population.  
These populations will be comprised of patients recruited to this study  and to study  [ZIP_CODE] 
(being conducted in different countries; the protocols are identical with the exception that 
study  [ZIP_CODE] has a pharmacokinetic s ubstudy ).  The patients will be recruited competitively  
between studies [ZIP_CODE] and [ZIP_CODE]; there are no minimum requirements for recruitment totals 
in either study .[ADDRESS_612754] an APACHE II score 
[ADDRESS_612755] one dose of stud y drug.
11.1.2 Analytical Plan - amended
The primary  efficacy  analy sis will be conducted in the mI TT population.  The primary  
analysis is on the combined database, no single study  anal yses will be performed as part of 
the primary  analy sis.90   Unless otherwise specified, all significance t ests will be conducted 
using a two -sided alpha level of 0.05.
All variables collected in this study  will be summarized with descriptive statistics at each 
assessment time.  Patient disposition and demographic and baseline characteristics will be 
summarized descriptively for each treatment group.  Demographic variables will be 
summarized for both the mI TT and ITT populations.
Duration of treatment (the total number of doses) will be summarized descriptively  by 
[CONTACT_477748] (eg, on vent a nd handheld).  Overall duration and duration 
by [INVESTIGATOR_16897] t ype will be provided for both the mITT and ITT populations.
All safet y anal yses will be provided onl y for the ITT population.
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics will include means, stand ard deviations, 
medians, minimums and maximums.  For categorical variables, frequency  counts and 
percentages will be provided.

Assuming approximately 30% of patients will not be eligible for the primary  efficacy  anal ysis 
(ie, will not have a pre -therapy  Gram -
negative organism) a total of 362 ITT patients per 
group (724 ITT overall) will be needed for the study , based on current surveillance.  Note that 
with this sample size, an obser ved treatment group difference of as low as 7.74% could 
provide a statistically  significant result.
11.3 Methods for the Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Parameter (Survival) -
amended
92The primary  efficacy  variable is Survival through the LFU visit .  Survival is achieved when 
the patient is alive through the LFU visit. No other factors are considered in the evaluation of 
survival .
The primary  anal ysis will compare the survival rates through LFU visit of patients in the 
BAY 41-6551 group versus patient s in the p lacebo group, using the combined data from 
studies [ZIP_CODE] and [ZIP_CODE].
The null (H 0) and the alternative (H 1) hypothesis for this primary anal ysis is the following:
H0: p[BAY 41-6551] = p[placebo]
H1: p[BAY 41- 6551] ≠ p[placebo]
where p is the true Survival rate.  
A Cochran -Mantel -Haenzel test of general association, adjusting for stratum and geographic 
region, will be performed as the primary  efficacy  analy sis.  If the p- value from this test is less 
than 0.05, and the proportion of patients who survive is higher in the BAY [ADDRESS_612757] achieved its primary  objective. 
In addition, as a supportive anal ysis, a 95% confidence interval will be calculated for the odds 
ratio.  This confidence interval will be ge nerated from a logistic regression model with 
Survival as the primary  variable, and treatment, stratum, and geographic region as the 
independent variables.  If the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio 
(BAY 41 -6551/placebo) is great er than 1, BAY 41 -6551 will be demonstrated to be 
statistically  superior to placebo. 
Tests will be performed using the SAS procedure FREQ, and the 95% confidence intervals 
for the odds ratios will be generated using PROC LOGI STIC. 
An unadjusted chi -squared test will also be performed as a supportive efficacy  analy sis.  In 
addition, a logistic regression model with only  treatment as an independent variable will be 
performed, and the resulting 95% confidence interval for the odds rati o will be provided.  
These analy ses will serve as sensitivity  anal yses to demonstrate consistency with the primary  
analysis. 
The Breslow -Day test will be used as a further supportive anal ysis to test for treatment b y 
geographic region and treatment b y stratum interaction.  If this test of the homogeneity  of the

Appendix 9.1:
To be declared a MDR, a bacterial isolate at the same visit must be resistant using 
the central laboratory interpretation to at least 3 of the 7 drug classes on the 
susceptibility  panel: aminogl ycoside, β -lactam/β- lactamase inhibitor, cephams, 
carbapenam, tetracy cline, folate pathway  inhibitor, and quinolone. Once a patient 
has an y MDR pathogen, he/she should be designated as a MDR patient no matter 
what the subsequent susceptibility  tests show.
For the 3 cephams (ceftazidime, cefazolin, and cefpodoxime), resistance to any  
one of the 3 drugs in the panel counts as cepham resistance for the category.
An interpretation b y central laboratory of “Not applicable” result will be 
considered as “susceptible” for purposes of MDR tabulation. This means that at 
least 3 results of “intermediate” or “resistant” are necessary  for an MDR 
designation, and a “Not appl icable” will not be included in the total. 
11.4 Methods for the Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Parameters -amended
93If the null hypothesis for the primary  efficacy  variable is rejected, a formal hy pothesis 
testing scenario will be applied for the secondary  efficacy  variables: 
Pneumonia -related mortality  through the LFU visit (determined b y blinded 
adjudication committee)
Early Clinical Response (based on CPI S, mortality , and certain AEs) assessed 
through Day  10 
The number of day s on mechanical ventilation through the LFU visit
The number of day s in the I CU through the LFU visit
The secondary  efficacy  variables will be formally  tested for statistical significance of a 
difference between the BAY 41 -6551 group versus the placebo group, onl y if the primary  
efficacy comparison is statistically  significant at the two- sided 5% level.  A sequential testing 
procedure will be performed at the two -sided alpha level of 0.05 for these four secondary  
efficacy  variables, strictly  in the order listed above.
The null hy pothe sis of no difference between BAY 41 -6551 and placebo in pneumonia –
related mortalit y and early clinical response will be tested using an unadjusted Chi -square 
test. Analy sis of variance will be used to test the null hy pothesis of no difference between

11.5.2 Investigator Assessment of Patient Outcome -amended
Investigator Assessment of Patient Outcome is determined at the TOC visit. The outcomes of 
“success” or “failure” are based on the following criteria:
Improvement or lack of progression of all abnormalities on chest radiograph 
Resolution towards normal of the following CPI S components: tracheal secretions 
(volume and purulence), temperature, blood leukocy tes, oxy genation (P/F ratio) 
Any further change to the Gram- negative portion of the antimicrobial regimen being used 
to treat pneumonia during the first [ADDRESS_612767] 96 hours after the initiation of empi[INVESTIGATOR_477635] y or as soon as initial culture 
and susceptibility  results are available and excepting the discontinuation of

12.[ADDRESS_612776] a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory  finding), sy mptom, or disease temporally  associated 
with the use of an investigational product, w hether or not considered related to the medicinal 
product.
Adverse events associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug 
related, include the following: 
An AE occurring in the course of the use of a drug product in professiona l 
practice.
An AE occurring from an overdose whether accidental or intentional.
An AE occurring from drug abuse.
An AE occurring from drug withdrawal. 
An AE where there is a reasonable possibility  that the event occurred purely  as a 
result of the patient’s participation in the study  (eg, AE or SAE due to 
discontinuation of anti- hypertensive drugs during wash -out phase) must also be 
reported as an AE even if it is not related to the investigational product.
The clinical manifestation of an y failure of expected pharmacological action is not recorded 
as an AE if it is already reflected as a data point captured in the CRF.  If, however, the event 
fulfills any  of the criteria for an SAE, it must be recorded and reported as such.
12.1.[ADDRESS_612777] medical occurrence that at any  dose: 
Results in death.
Is life -threatening.
Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].
Results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacit y.
Is a congenital anomal y or birth defect.
Is a medicall y important event as judged b y the investigator.
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
BAY 41- 6551/No. [ZIP_CODE] 
29 Aug 2017 Version 9.0 Page: 70of 157
Life-threatening: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an AE in 
which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an AE 
which hy potheticall y might have caused death if it were more severe.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: Any  AE leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_477671], UNL ESS at least one of the following exceptions is met:
The admission results in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8954] 12 hours and is not otherwise 
associated with a medically  important AE. 
OR
The admission is pre- planned (ie, elective or scheduled surgery  arranged prior to 
the start of the stud y). 
OR
The admission is not associated with an AE (eg, social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_477672]).
However it should be noted that invasive treatment during any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_477673] ‘medicall y important’ and as such may be reportable as a serious AE dependent on 
clinical judgment.  In addition where local regulatory  authorities specifically  require a more 
stringent definition, the local regulation takes precedent.
Disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to conduct no rmal life’s 
functions.
Important medical event : Any  AE may  be considered serious because it may jeopardize the 
patient and may  require intervention to prevent another serious condition.  As guidance for 
determination of important medical events refer to th e Eudravigilance Important Medical 
Event (IME) Terms List.  These terms either refer to or might be indicative of a serious 
disease state. 
Such reported events warrant special attention because of their possible association with a 
serious disease state an d may  lead to more decisive action than reports on other terms. 
12.1.3 Unexpected Adverse Event
An unexpected AE is an y adverse drug event, the specificit y or severit y of which is not 
consistent with the current I nvestigator Brochure (or Package Insert for marketed products). 
Also, reports which add significant information on specificit y or severity of a known, alread y 
documented AE constitute unexpected AEs.  For example, an event more specific or more 
severe than described in the Investigator Brochure woul d be considered “unexpected”.  
Specific examples would be; (a) acute renal failure as a labeled AE with a subsequent new 
report of interstitial nephritis and (b) hepatitis with a first report of fulminant hepatitis.
The expectedness of AEs, including the e xpectedness of AEs related to the medical device, 
will be determined b y the sponsor according to the applicable reference document and 
according to all local regulations.

Identified risks of parenteral (IV and IM) formulations of amikacin (eg, neurotoxicity , 
ototoxicity , and nephrotoxicity ) should be monitored to assess the potential risk for 
aerosolized amikacin.  Adverse effects due to local exposure in the bronchopulmonary 
system, such as bronchospasm (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), coughing during or shortly  after 
inhalation of aerosol, and hemopty sis should also be monitored.
12.1.[ADDRESS_612779]
The assessment of the relationship of an AE to the administration of study  drug is a clinical 
decision based on all available information at the time of the completion of the CRF.
An assessment of ‘No’ would include:
1. The existence of a clear alternative explanation eg, mechanical bleeding at surgical site.
OR
2. Non
-Plausibility  eg, the patient is struck by  [CONTACT_477750]; cancer developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a few day s 
after the first drug administration. 
An assessment of ‘Yes’ indicates that there is a reasonable suspi[INVESTIGATOR_477674].
Factors to be considered in assessing the relationship of the AE to stu dy drug include: 
The temporal sequence from drug administration: The event should occur after the 
drug is given.  The length of time from drug exposure to event should be evaluated 
in the clinical context of the event.
Recovery  on discontinuation (de -challenge), recurrence on reintroduction (re-
challenge): Patient’s response after drug discontinuation (de- challenge) or 
patient’s response after drug re -introduction (re -challenge) should be considered in 
the view of the usual clinical course of the event in question.
Underl ying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases: Each report should be evaluated in 
the context of the natural history  and course of the disease being treated and any  
other disease the patient may have.
Concomitant medication or treatment: The oth er drugs the patient is taking or the 
treatment the patient receives should be examined to determine whether an y of 
them may  be suspected to cause the event in question.
The pharmacology  and pharmacokinetics of the test drug: The pharmacokinetic 
properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) of the test drug(s), 
coupled with the individual patient’s pharmacod ynamics should be considered.
12.1.6 Severity of the Adverse Event
The following classification should be used:
The severit y of AEs should be graded as follows:
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
BAY 41- 6551/No. [ZIP_CODE] 
29 Aug 2017 Version 9.0 Page: 72of 157
Mild –usually  transient in nature and generally  not interfering with normal activities 
Moderate –sufficientl y discomforting to interfere with normal activities 
Severe –prevents normal activities
12.1.[ADDRESS_612780] be fully recorded in the patient’s CRF and transcribed to the 
electronic CRF (eCRF).
Documentation must be supported b y an entr y in the patient’ s file.  A laboratory  test 
abnormality  considered clinically  relevant, eg, causing the patient to withdraw from the 
study , requiring treatment or causing apparent clinical manifestations, or judged relevant by  
[CONTACT_093], should be reported as an AE.   Each event should be described in detail along 
with start and stop dates, severit y, relationship to investigational product, action taken and 
outcome.
12.2 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events/Pregnancy
All investigators will be trained on all relevant aspects of the investigator’s reporting 
obligations for SAEs.  This information, including all relevant contact [CONTACT_8972], is summarized 
in the investigator site file.  This information will be updated as needed.
Serious AEs, including laboratory
 test abnormalities fulfilling the definition of serious, after 
signing the informed consent and during follow- up period must immediately  (within 24 hours 
of the investigator’s awareness) be reported to the person detailed in the study  file.  An SAE 
form must also be completed within [ADDRESS_612781] to the partner’s consent.
12.2.1 Notification of the IECs/IRBs
Notification of the IECs/IRBs about all relevant events (eg, SAEs, S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be 
performed b y the sponsor or delegated to a CRO and/or by  [CONTACT_8975].

29 Aug 2017 Version 9.0 Page: 73of 157
12.2.2 Notif ication of the Authorities
The processing and reporting of all relevant events (eg, SAEs, S[LOCATION_003]Rs) to the authorities 
will be done by  [CONTACT_23625].
12.2.3 Sponsor’s Notification of the Investigational Site
The sponsor or sponsor’s designee will inform all investigational sites about reported relevant 
events (eg, S[LOCATION_003]Rs) according to all applicable regulations.
12.3 Definition of an Incident
An incident is any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of
the device, as well as an y inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use, which directly 
or indirectl y, might lead to or might have led to the death or to a serious deterioration in the 
state of health of a patient or user or of other persons. 
The following criteria apply  in determining whether an incident has occurred:
A.An event has occurred or may  occur if the same failure is repeated. 
An event could be among others:
Malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics or performance or
Unantici pated adverse reaction or unanticipated side effect or 
Interactions with other substances or products or 
Degradation / destruction of the device (e.g., fire) or 
Inappropriate therap y, or
Inaccuracy  in the labeling, instructions for use including omissions or deficiencies.
B.The device is suspected to be a contributory  cause of the event
C.The event led, or might have led, to one of the following outcomes:
Death of a patient or user or other person or
Serious deterioration in the state of health of a p atient, user or other person
To determine whether an incident has occurred, criteria A, B, and C must be fulfilled.  All 
incidents will be reported to the respective national competent authorities, authorized 
representative, and as applicable, notified bod ies according to local regulations and medical 
device regulations 93/42/EEC, MEDDEV 12.2, GHTF/SG2/N21R8:1999, and 21 Code of 
Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 803.
Incidents should be reported using a separate clinical investigations device complaint form.
12.3.1 Device Malfunction or Failure and Medical Device Reporting
Any device complaint, malfunction, or failure including use errors will be recorded by  [CONTACT_105819]/investigational site, including all relevant device information using the clinical 
investigations device complaint form, and forwarded within 24 hours to the sponsor or 
sponsor’s designee for evaluation and investigation, regardless of whether or not a medical 
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
BAY 41- 6551/No. [ZIP_CODE] 
29 Aug 2017 Version 9.0 Page: 74of 157
event was associated with the device malfunction or failure.  There are three different 
situa tions, in which a medical device complaint form might need to be filled out by  [CONTACT_1275]:
a)When an AE is recorded, the investigator needs to check if a device malfunction or 
failure might be associated with the recorded AE.
b)When a device malfunction or device failure occurs, the investigator needs to assess 
whether an AE might have occurred in relation to the device.
c)When a device malfunction, device failure, or use error occurs, without any associated 
AE, this also needs to be captured in the form an d immediately  forwarded to the 
sponsor for investigation.
The details of the malfunction and medical circumstances will be captured on a Device 
Complaint Form filled out by  [CONTACT_105820]’s 
designee.  The final determination of reportability  is made by  [CONTACT_105821]/investigational site based on the medical circumstances surrounding the event.  
[COMPANY_001], the device manufacturer, may  recommend reporting an incident based on 
investigations, but the final determination of reportability  is made by  [CONTACT_456].
Investigator’s notification of the sponsor
All investigators will be instructed and trained on all relevant aspects of the investigator’s 
reporting obligations for device incidents and serious public health threats.  This information, 
including all relevant contact [CONTACT_8972], is summarized in the investigator site file. This 
information will be updated as needed.
The sponsor will inform the device manufacturer ([COMPANY_001]) about an y incident and N ovartis 
will then perform an evaluation and investigation of the device, as necessary, and exchange 
any significant information with the sponsor.  [COMPANY_001] will inform the sponsor about 
necessary  trend reports and will provide the required documentation af ter completing the 
respective investigation and statistical analysis. The sponsor will then notify the authorities of 
any trend reports according to all applicable regulations.
All devices that have malfunctioned or failed will be inventoried and returned to the device 
manufacturer.  The devices should be stored in a hermeticall y sealed bag and labeled with the 
respective case reference.  I n cases where an incident is recorded in connection with the 
device malfunction or failure, the device should be sent i mmediately  per courier to the device 
manufacturer.  If an y of the devices need to be replaced, the reason(s) will be documented.  
Additional PDDS Clinical devices are provided for this purpose. 
13. Use of Data and Publication
All data and results and all inte llectual propert y rights in the data and results derived from the 
study  will be the property  of the sponsor, who may  utilize the data in various way s, such as 
for submission to government regulatory  authorities or disclosure to other investigators.  The 
investigator, while free to utilize data derived from the study for scientific purposes, must 
discuss any  publication with the sponsor prior to release and obtain written consent of the 
sponsor on the intended publication.  The sponsor recognizes the right of the investigator to 
publish the results upon completion of the study .  However, the investigator must send a draft

15.5 APACHE II Score / Glasgow Score -amended
The Acute Ph ysiology  and Chronic Health E valuation II is a severity  of disease classification 
system (Knaus et al, 1985)46, one of several ICU scoring s ystems .  After admission of a 
patient to an ICU, an integer score from 0 to 71 is computed based on several measurements; 
higher scores impl y a more severe disease and a higher risk of death.
APACHE II was designed to measure the severity of disease for adult patients admitted to 
ICUs.  The lower age is not specified in the original article, but a good limit is to use 
APACHE II only  for patients age [ADDRESS_612790] s:
Some procedures and some medicine is only  given to patients with certain 
APACHE II score
APACHE II score can be used to describe the morbidity  of a patient when 
comparing the outcome with other patients
Predicted mortalities are averaged for groups of patients in order to specify the 
group's morbidit y.
Even though newer scoring s ystems, like Simplified Acute Ph ysiology  Score (SAPS )II have 
replaced APACHE II in many  institutions, APACHE II continues to be used extensively  
because so much documentation is based on it.
The point score is calculated from 12 routine ph ysiological measurements (such as blood 
pressure, bod y temperature, heart rate etc.). 109The calculation method is optimized for paper 
schemas.  The resulting point score should alway s be interpreted in relation to the illness of 
the patient.
After the initial APACHE II score has been de termined, no new score can be entered for this 
study  during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] .110  If a patient is discharged from the ICU and readmitted, a 
new APACHE II score can be calculated.
The appendix of the document that originall y described the APACHE II score describes how 
to calculate a predicted death rate for a patient.  In order to make this calculation of predicted 
mortality  precise, the principal diagnosis leading to I CU admission was added as a category  
weight: the predicted mortality  is computed based on the patient's APACHE II score and their 
principal diagnosis at admission.

16.5 Amendment 5
Amendment 5 can be found in integrated protocol version 6.0, dated 17 SEP 2014.
16.6 Amendment 6
16.6.1 Overview of Changes
To shorten the time required to develop data from the two Phase III clinical studies of the 
Amikacin Inhale program (BAY 41 -6551/No. [ZIP_CODE] [I nhale 1] and BAY 41-6551/No. [ZIP_CODE] 
[Inhale 2]) to sustain regulatory  submission, Bay er decided that the results of both studies 
should be consolidated into a single report. This allowed the number of patients required to be 
reduced from approximately  [ADDRESS_612795] clinical benefit. This will require modifications a priori ty
of the statistical anal ysis plan, but will not require any  alterations to patient management, 
modifications to data collection tools, or changes to the evaluations being performed at the 
clinic to assess Clinical Failure or Success. The aim is that the patient population recruited to 
the study  and the management of the patients will be the same after the implementation of 
this amendment as it was before.
The changes to the protocol ar e summarized below:
Recruitment will continue in the two Phase III Amikacin I nhale studies until a total of 
approximately  [ADDRESS_612796] been enrolled. Enrollment will be competitive and 
both studies will be stopped when that number is reached.  The S ynopsis and Section 
8.3 were revised.
Text was updated with the latest revision date of the Investigator’s Brochure.  
Sections 5.4.2 and 14 were revised.
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
BAY 41- 6551/No. [ZIP_CODE] 
29 Aug 2017 Version 9.0 Page: 98of 157
Clarification was made with regards to the presence of Gram- negative organism as an 
inclusion criterion versus the mI TT population evaluation criterion.  Section 8.3 was 
revised.
The primary  efficacy  endpoint has been modified so that the antibiotic rules better 
reflect clinical success or failure and the other variables are more clearl y aligned with 
clinica l response. The specific endpoints are as follows:
All-cause mortalit y to Day 28 (previousl y was to Day 17- 19).  Pneumonia -related 
mortality  will become an important secondary  endpoint. 
Systemic antibiotic duration to the TOC visit (Day  17-19); all antibi otic 
adjustments to the TOC visit are allowed, extension or restarting of antibiotics for 
pneumonia bey ond the TOC visit is not allowed.   
No AE of lung abscess or empy ema reported through the LFU visit
Stable respi[INVESTIGATOR_477692] (new).  The asses sment will be based on the 
Berlin Criteria for ARDS, which categorizes severity  based on P/F ratios
.  (49)
The Sy nopsis, and Sections 5.1, 6, 8.2, 9.6.1 , and 14 were revised.
Sections were moved for better comprehension.  The assessments previously  refer red 
to as Clinical Response Assessments (renamed as I nvestigator Assessment of Patient 
Outcome) were moved from Section [IP_ADDRESS] to Section [IP_ADDRESS].
Changes were made to the statistical sections due to the combining of data from study  
[ADDRESS_612797] the changes to data management and anal yses.  
The secondary  variables have been revised.  Day s in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_477693], and pneumonia
-related mortality  added and speed of response based 
on CPI S success or failure has been added.  The secondary  endpoints were changed 
due to the change in primary  endpoints. CPI S, which mainly  measures the speed of 
response, is now removed from consideration in the primary  endpoin t and has instead 
been added as an Earl y Clinical Response component to the secondary  endpoints. I n 
addition, pneumonia -related mortality  was discussed and suggested as a possible 
secondary  endpoint.  These two additions required the removal of the least r elevant 
secondary  endpoint.  Both relapse rate (success at TOC, but failure by  [CONTACT_477754]  28-
32) and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19156] s were deemed as less likel y to differentiate based on superior 
versus standard therap y.  The Synopsis and Sections 6 and 11.4 were revised.
An Ad judication Committee will be appointed: there will be 3 members one of whom 
will be appointed chairman. 
An Adjudication Committee Charter will be drawn up 
and guidelines produced that will determine the scope and methods to be applied by  
[CONTACT_942].  A paragraph was added to Section 7 describing the role of the 
Adjudication Committee.   The Adjudication Committee was added to facilitate the 
evaluation of of mortality  data from the different sites.  The Adjudication Committee 
will ensure a standardization of evaluation criteria.
The instructions for used and unused devices were revised in Sections 8.4.5 and 8.5.3.
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
BAY 41- 6551/No. [ZIP_CODE] 
29 Aug 2017 Version 9.0 Page: 99of 157
The option of using pulse oximetry  at the TOC and premature discontinuation visits 
was deleted.  An arterial blood gas is needed at these visits in order to calculate a 
PaO 2/FiO 2ratio required by [CONTACT_477755].  Sections [IP_ADDRESS] , 9.5, and 15.1 were 
updated.
Missing text was added to the APACHE II Scoring Tool and clarification was added 
regarding scoring.  Section 15.5 was updated.
Minor edito rial changes were made to improve clarity , corrections were made due to 
inconsistencies, text was revised to correct/clarify the timing of assessments, and 
terminology  was revised for clarit y and consistency.  The S ynopsis, and Sections 4, 
5.1, 6, 7, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3.1, [IP_ADDRESS], 8.4.1, 8.4.5, 9.1.2, [IP_ADDRESS], [IP_ADDRESS], 15.1, and 15.3 
were revised. 
Lastl y, the use of word “subject(s)” was replaced with “patient(s)” in this Phase III 
protocol.

Efficacy variables The primary efficacy variable will be Clinical Success in the mITT 
population (ie, theITT population who prove to be culture positive 
for a Gram -negative pathogen and have an APACHE II score ≥ 10).    
Clinical Success is achieved when all of the following criteria are 
met:
1)  Systemic antibiotics (IV or by [CONTACT_1966] [PO] for pneumonia must 
be stopped on or before the Test -of-Cure (TOC) visit (Day 17 -19)
2)  Systemic antibiotics (IV or PO) for pneumonia must not be 
restarted after the TOC visit
3)  The patient must survive through the late follow -up (LFU) visit
3)  The patient must not have a reported AE of lung abscess or 
empyema through the LFU visit and 
4)  The patient must have stable respi[INVESTIGATOR_477696] 
41-6551 (versus aerosolized placebo) , as adjunctive therapy to IV 
antibiotics in both arms, as measured by:
Pneumonia -related mortality to the LFU visit
Early Clinical Response based on CPIS scores, the presence of 
empyema or lung abscess, and all -cause mortality through Day 
10
The number of days on mechanical ventilation through the LFU 
visit (Day 28 -32)
The number of ICU days assessed at the LFU visit ( Day 28-32)
The investigator will assess patient signs and symptoms at the TOC 
visit (Day 17 -19) for the Investigator Assessment of Patient 
Outcome, which is separate from the primary efficacy variable, 
Clinical Success.

In brief, the adjudication committee will review all deaths to determine the subset of dea ths 
that are pneumonia -related. These pneumonia -related deaths should more likely  be influenced 
by [CONTACT_477727] -unrelated deaths. The pneumonia -related 
death evaluation will be based on the death being plausibly  related to:
(1) pulmonary  infection (example pneumonia)
(2) spread (metastasis) of infection (example septicemia, septic shock)
(3) complications related to respi[INVESTIGATOR_60324]. (example respi[INVESTIGATOR_36645])
The AC will have a single binary  decision: pneumonia -related death: y es/no

8.2   Study Plan
Old text:
The TOC visit will be conducted on Day  17-19 of the stud yor at the time the patient is 
considered a treatment failure and/or study  drug is prematurel y discontinued . The late follow -
up visit will be conducted on Day  28-32 of the study .  Clinical response will be evaluated at 
the TOC and late follow -up visits (S ections [IP_ADDRESS].2 and [IP_ADDRESS].3 ).  If available, respi[INVESTIGATOR_477700], cultured, and evaluated for the emergence of resistance to study  
drug therap y among baseline organisms.  
The definition of Clinical Failure at the TOC visit will be
A rise in the CPI S by [CONTACT_2669] 2 points on Day  3
Failure of the CPIS to drop at least 1 point on Day  5 
Failure of the CPI S to drop by  [CONTACT_2669] 2 points on Day  10 
Continuation of sy stemic antibiotics (I V or by  [CONTACT_1966] [PO]) for pneumonia after 
ten full day sof aerosolized dosing
Restarting s ystemic antibiotics (I V or PO) for pneumonia before the TOC (with a 
positive respi[INVESTIGATOR_477661]) visit; 
One adjustment to the antimicrobial regimen is allowed when the initial culture 
result susceptibility  results are a vailable (t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y 48-72 hours).  An y additional 
change to the antimicrobial regimen being used to treat pneumonia during the first 
10 day s, after the initial antimicrobial adjustment of empi[INVESTIGATOR_477701] s are available, would be considered a 
Clinical Failure.  There are two exceptions where additional changes to the 
antimicrobial regimen are not considered Clinical Failures:  
o1) discontinuation of IV administered aminogly cosides after 5- 7 day s or 
o2) suitable de -escalation of therapy  in patients who are doing well 
clinically .  Suitable de -escalation is either discontinuation or reduction in 
dose of an anti -infective drug.  The initial IV administered gram negative 
anti-infective therap y should be maintain ed for 10 to 12 day s.
Patients who discontinue IV administered aminogly cosides after 5 -7 day s 
or who are suitably  de-escalated are not considered Clinical Failures.  An y

ATS/I DSA Guidelines, plus aerosolized BAY 41 -6551 or aerosolized placebo (Section 8.2).  
If the patient develops a new infection, other than pneumonia, while on the aerosol treatment 
the patient will continue in the stud y as long as the study  treatment for the new infection 
would not require an antibiotic course longer than the 10 -12 full day s of IV treatment 
required b y the protocol.  Patients should continue aerosol stud y treatment .
Each inhalation or aerosol dose will be administered via the PDDS Clinical (instruction 
manual provided).  If a patient is subsequently extubated, the aerosol treatment will be 
continued via the handheld adaptor for the remainder of the [ADDRESS_612808] clinical signs and sy mptoms of 
pneumonia (ie, the patient is evaluated as a Clinical Failure) .  The clinical signs and 
symptoms of pneumonia will be documented on the CRF as will the reason(s) for 
continuation of IV treatment past the treatment period allowed in the protocol .  Aerosol 
treatment will not extend bey ond 10 full day s corresponding to 20 doses (Section 8.2).

The primary  efficacy  evaluation is the Clinical Success, which is determined by  [CONTACT_2329] a 
computer algorithm based on collected data and specific criteria.  For a patient to be 
evaluated as a Clinical Success, all the following criteria must be met: 
Systemic antibiotics (IV or PO) for pn eumonia must be stopped on or before the 
TOC visit
Systemic antibiotics (IV or PO) for pneumonia must not be restarted after the 
TOC visit 
The patient must survive through the LFU visit 
The patient must not have a reported AE of lung abscess or emp yema through the 
LFU visit 
The patient must have stable respi[INVESTIGATOR_477707] P/F ratio (See Section 8.2)

The investigators will also assess patient outcome based on a composite endpoint. The 
Investigator Assessment of Patient Outcome is separate and different from the primary  
endpoint of Clinical Success, which is done b y using a computer algorithm based on collected 
data and specific criteria.  The Investigator Assessm ent of Patient Outcome is based on the 
following criteria:
CPIS assessed at baseline, Day s 3, 5, 10, and the TOC visit
All-cause mortalit y assessed through the TOC visit
Systemic antibacterial use for the current epi[INVESTIGATOR_477657]  10 (the

In the case of a patient who is evaluated as a Clinical Failure (ie, stud y drug therap y is 
discontinued because of a lack of therapeutic effect), the evaluation of the irclinical condition 
should be based on the clinical signs and s ymptoms of pneumonia as well as objective 
evidence of failure (eg, persistent fever, rising WBC count, increasing tracheal secretions, 
poor ox ygenation, progression of infiltrate on CXR) and a measure of their CPI S.  This 
information should be recorded on the CRF, as well as an evaluation of the patient’s clinical 
response to study  drug.  In most cases, the decision to evaluate the patient as a Clinical 
Failure will be made after at least 72 hours of study  medication, but in rare instances, the 
clinical course of the illness may  require that study  medication be discontinued prior to three 
days treatment and alternative antibiotic therapy  started.  Regardless of when the patient is

These populations will be comprised of patients recruited to this study  and to study  [ZIP_CODE] 
(being conducted in different countries; the protocols are identical with the exception that 
study  [ZIP_CODE] has a pharmacokinetic substudy ).  The patients will be recru ited competitively

patients will not be eligible for the primary  efficacy  analy sis (ie, will not have a pre- therapy  
Gram -negative organism) a total of 331 patients per group (662 overall) will be needed for 
the study , based on current surveillance.  If the actual rate of ineligible patients is different 
than 35%, the overall enrollment will be adjusted to ensure that 430patients with Gram -
negative organisms are enrolled.  Note that with this sample size, an observed treatment 
group difference of as low as 9.3% could provide a statistically  significant result.

enrolled.  Note that with this sample size, an observed treatment group difference of as low as 
8.9% could provide a statistically significant result.
11.3   Methods for the Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Parameter
Old text:
The primary  efficacy  variable is clinical response at the TOC visit .  The primary anal ysis will 
compare the proportion of patients with cures in the BAY 41-6551 group versus the 
proportion in the placebo group.  All assessments other than cure -failures, improvements, 
indeterminates, and missings (those patients who do not have a test of cure assessment) will 
be grouped together in a non -cure category  for the purposes of this anal ysis.
The null (H 0) and the alternative (H 1) hypothesis for this primary anal ysis is the following:
H0: p[BAY 41-6551] = p[placebo]
H1: p[BAY 41- 6551] ≠ p[placebo]
where p is the true cure rate.  
A Cochran -Mantel -Haenzel test of general association, adjusting for stratum and geographic 
region, will be performed as the primary  efficacy  analy sis.  If the p- value from this test is less 
than 0.05, and the proportion of patients with cures is higher in the BAY [ADDRESS_612817] achieved its primary objective. 
In addition, as a supportive anal ysis, a 95% confidence interval will be calculated for the odds 
ratio.  This confidence interval will be generated from a logistic regression mod el with 
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
BAY 41- 6551/No. [ZIP_CODE] 
29 Aug 2017 Version 9.0 Page: 124of 157
clinical response as the primary  variable, and treatment, stratum, and geographic region as the 
independent variables.  If the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio 
(BAY 41 -6551/placebo) is greater than 1, BAY 41 -6551 will b e demonstrated to be 
statistically  superior to placebo. 
….
The Breslow -Day test will be used as a further supportive anal ysis to test for treatment b y 
geographic region and treatment b y stratum interaction.  If this test of the homogeneity of the 
odds rat io indicates a significant interaction, exploratory  analy ses will attempt to define its 
source.
….
In addition, an anal ysis of clinical response will be conducted that excludes patients who 
received anti -microbial therap y considered to be effective against Gram -negative organisms, 
for infections other than the underl ying pneumonia.  Patients will only  be excluded from this 
analysis if the additional anti -microbial therap y was administered before the TOC visit and 
the patient was not a Clinical Failure.

Discharged/lost to follow -up Failure
Any other reason/unknown reason Failure
The primary  anal ysis will compare the proportion of patients with Clinical Success in the 
BAY 41-6551 group versus the proportion in the placebo group, using the combined data 
from studies [ZIP_CODE] and [ZIP_CODE] .  All assessments o ther than Clinical Success -failures, 
improvements, and missings (those patients who do not have a TOC assessment) will be 
grouped together in the Clinical Failure category  for the purposes of this analy sis.
The null (H 0) and the alternative (H 1) hypothes is for this primary  anal ysis is the following:
H0: p[BAY 41-6551] = p[placebo]
H1: p[BAY 41- 6551] ≠ p[placebo]
where p is the true Clinical Success rate.

In addition, as a supportive anal ysis, a 95% confidence interval will be calculated for the odds 
ratio.  This confidence interval will be generated from a logistic regression model with 
Clinical Success as the primary  variable, and treatment, stratum, and geographic region as the 
independent variables.  If the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio 
(BAY 41 -6551/placebo) is greater than 1, BAY 41 -6551 will be demonstrated to be

The indiv idual components of the composite endpoint will be analy zed using Mantel-

moving in the same general direction and which, if any , single component is driving the 
result.

The Breslow -Day test will be used as a further supportive anal ysis to test for treatment b y 
geographic region and treatment b y stratum interaction.  If this test of the homogeneity of the 
odds ratio indicates a significant interaction, exploratory  analy seswill attempt to define its 
source.  A Cochran- Mantel - Haenzel test of general association, adjusting for stratum and 
study  protocol (ie, [ZIP_CODE] or [ZIP_CODE]), will be performed to assess the effect of study  protocol 
on the primary  outcome Clinical Success.  Geographic region will not be included in this 
model as the 2 studies were conducted in different regions.
….
In addition, an anal ysis of Clinical Success will be conducted that excludes patients who 
received anti -microbial therap y considered to be effective against Gram -negative organisms, 
for infections other than the underl ying pneumonia.  Patients will only  be excluded from this 
analysis if the additional anti -microbial therap y was administered before the TOC visit and 
the patient was not a Clinical Failur e.
11.4   Methods for the Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Parameters
Old text:
If the null hy pothesis for the primary  efficacy  variable is rejected, a formal hy pothesis testing 
scenario will be applied for 4 secondary  efficacy  variables.  These four are : 
the number of day s on mechanical ventilation
the number of day s in the I CU
the number of day s in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]
relapse rates
For the first three variables, the counting of the totals will begin on the first day  of study  drug 
therap y and continue through Day  28.  
Holm’s sequentially  rejective testing procedure will be used for these four secondary  
endpoints.  With this approach, the p -values from the tests of the four variables are ordered 
from lowest to highest.  If the lowest p -value is 0.0125 (0.05/4), n one of the null hy potheses 
of treatment equality  for these variables will be rejected, and no more comparisons will be 
performed.  If the lowest p- value is 0.0125, the null hy pothesis for that variable will be 
rejected, and the next lowest p- value will t hen be compared to 0.0167 (0.05/3).  The tests will 
continue until the first time at which the null hy pothesis is not rejected; all null hy potheses 
from that point on are also not rejected.

patient had “few” secretions but they were purulent, then the patient would 
have a score of 1 for this component of the score; or if the patient had a 
“large” amount of purulent secretions, then the score would be 3)
Chest radiograph (CXR): the CXR take n within the previous 24 h (or sooner)
Temperature, oC:the maximal temperature taken within the previous [ADDRESS_612826] temperature taken in the previous 
24hours should be used for point assignment
Blood leukocytes (WBC) (cells/mm3):the maximal WBC count reported in the 
previous [ADDRESS_612827] WBC count reported in the previous 
24 hours should be used for point a ssignment
Oxygenation PaO 2/ FiO 2, mm Hg: the most recently  calculated P/F ratio obtained 
within the last 24 hours should be used for point assignment

included as part of the integrated global protocol.
Minor changes to the protocol include editorial changes, correction of t ypographical errors,

These data necessitated a change in the primary  endpoint. I t was decided to narrow the 
primary  endpoint to all
-cause mortality  alone through the LFU visit (day s 28-32). This 
primary  endpoint is in alignment with current FDA draft guidance for ventilated pneumonia. 
All-cause mortalit y through the LFU visit will be the sole criteria for evaluation.
The changes to the protocol are summarized below:
The primary  efficacy  endpoint has been modified to all -cause mortality  through the 
LFU visit.

The primary  anal ysis will compare the proportion of patients with Clinical Success in the 
BAY 41-6551 group versus the proportion in the placebo group, using the combined data 
from studies [ZIP_CODE] and [ZIP_CODE]. All assessments other than Clinical Succ ess -failures, 
improvements, and missings (those patients who do not have a TOC assessment) will be 
grouped together in the Clinical Failure category  for the purposes of this analy sis.
The null (H 0) and the alternative (H 1) hypothesis for this primary an alysis is the following:
H0: p[BAY 41-6551] = p[placebo]
H1: p[BAY 41- 6551] ≠ p[placebo]
where p is the true Clinical Success rate.  
A Cochran -Mantel -Haenzel test of general association, adjusting for stratum and geographic 
region, will be performed as th e primary  efficacy  analy sis.  If the p- value from this test is less 
than 0.05, and the proportion of patients with Clinical Success is higher in the BAY [ADDRESS_612843] achieved its primary  objective. 
In addition, as a supportive anal ysis, a 95% confidence interval will be calculated for the odds 
ratio.  This confidence interval will be generated from a logistic regression model with 
Clinical Success as the primary  variable, and treatment, stratum, and geographic region as the 
independent variables.  If the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio 
(BAY 41 -6551/placebo) is greater than 1, BAY 41 -6551 will be demonstrated to be 
statistically  superior to placebo. 
The individual components of the composite endpoint will be analy zed using Mantel-

the ventilation status and PaO 2/FiO 2(P/F) ratio (if ventilation status or P/F ratio is not 
available at the TOC, use the respective ventilation status or P/F ratio value from the closest 
previous visit).  See Section [IP_ADDRESS], Definition of Primary Efficacy  Endpoint.
The anal ysis will compare the proportion of patients with Clinical Success in the BAY 41 -
6551 group versus the patients in the placebo group, using the combined data from studies 
[ZIP_CODE] and [ZIP_CODE]. All assessments other than Clinical Success, which are, fail ures, 
improvements, and missing (those patients who do not have a TOC assessment) will be 
grouped together in the Clinical Failure category  for the purpose of this analy sis. If a TOC 
assessment is missing for determining the antibiotic criteria for a patie nt, the TOC assessment 
will be assumed to have occurred [ADDRESS_612859] demonstrated superiority  in this 
sensitivity  anal ysis.
In addition, as a suppor tive anal ysis, a 95% confidence interval will be calculated for the odds 
ratio. This confidence interval will be generated from a logistic regression model with 
Clinical Success as the additional efficacy  variable, and treatment, stratum, and geographic 
region as the independent variables. If the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the 
odds ratio (BAY 41- 6551/placebo) is greater than 1, BAY 41- [ADDRESS_612860] adjusting for stratum and geographic region. This is to assess the 
components are moving in the same general direction and which, if an y, single component is 
driving the result. The analy sis of individual components will be performed on the actual 
counts of each criterion, not ordered b y medical relevance.
Tests will be performed using the SAS procedure FREQ, and the 95% confidence intervals 
for the odds ratios will be generated using PROC L OGISTIC.
An unadjusted chi -squared test will also be performed as a supportive efficacy  analy sis. In 
addition, a logistic regression model with only  treatment as an independent variable will be 
performed , and the resulting 95% confidence interval for the o dds ratio will be provided. 
The Breslow -Day test will be used as a further supportive anal ysis to test for treatment b y 
geographic region and treatment b y stratum interaction. If this test of the homogeneity of the 
odds ratio indicate significant interact ion (P < 0.10), exploratory  anal yses will attempt to 
define its source. 
A Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test of general association, adjusting for stratum and study  
protocol (i.e., [ZIP_CODE] or [ZIP_CODE]), will be performed to assess the effect of study  protocol on the

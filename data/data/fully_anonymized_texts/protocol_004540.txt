1.0 OBJECTIVES  
Primary: To assess overall survival from the date of diagnosis  in subjects with stage IV gastric or  
gastroesophageal cancer and positive cytology or carcinomatosis after cytoreduction, gastrectomy, 
and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy administration.  
Secondary:   
1) To assess the safety of cytoreduction, gastrectomy, and hyperthermic intraperitoneal 
chemotherapy administration for subjects with gastric or  gastroesophageal cancer and positive 
cytology or carcinomatosis.  
2.[ADDRESS_29355] reports highlighting the incidence and outcome of patients with peritoneal disease, 
we identified 381 patients with gastric or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma at M. D. Anderson 
Cancer Center without metastatic disease on radiologic imaging whom  underwent diagnostic 
laparoscopy for further staging prior to consideration for  neoadjuvant treatment.6  Eighty -three 
patients had carcinomatosis on laparoscopy while 39 had positive cytology in the absence of 
carcinomatosis.  Carcinomatosis and positive cytology are classified as metastatic or Stage IV 
disease according to the American Joint Commission on Cancer Staging Manual (7th edition).[ADDRESS_29356] from serosal invasion and peritoneal spread rather than hematologic or lymphatic spread, and 
therefore are good candidates for local chemotherapy administration.  The pop ulation of patients 
with isolated peritoneal disease are also good candidates for a clinical trial as traditional treatment regimens yield dismal survival rates.  Median OS (overall survival) for patients with positive 
peritoneal cytology and no visible metastatic disease at laparoscopy was 12.8 months while median OS was 10.2 months for patients with carcinomatosis.
6  For the patients with positive per itoneal 
cytology and no visible  metastatic disease, use of neoadjuvant therapy (most often induction 5- FU 
and oxaliplatin followed by [CONTACT_30022] 45 Gy) resulted in a 3- year OS rate of 12% 
versus 0% for patients treated as having incurable stage IV disease.  For the patients with carcinomatosis at laparoscopy, outcomes were worse with 0% 3- year OS.  For the 122 patients with

Revised  July 20, 2018      
Protocol v.03 Page 5  
 
carcinomatosis at laparoscopy or positive cytology, only 8 (6.7%) underwent resection.  The 
proposed trial will focus  on the combined population of patients with carcinomatosis or positive 
cytology at laparoscopy.  
Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC)  is a surgical technique for combining 
hyperthermia and chemotherapeutic agents to the peritoneal surface via a heated perfusion circuit.[ADDRESS_29357] been 13 randomized trials on adjuvant intraperitoneal chemotherapy for gastric 
cancer with a recent meta- analysis demonstrating improved overall survival.  Collectively, these 
studies displayed a 40% improvement in survival (hazard ratio = 0.60, 95%  CI 0.43 -0.83) for 
patients treated with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy.
4  A more recent meta- analysis on 
adjuvant hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy for patients undergoing gastrectomy with serosal invasion demonstrated an improvement in survival (risk ratio = 0.73, 95% CI 0.64- 0.83) and 
peritoneal recurrence (risk ratio = 0.45, 95% CI 0.28- 0.72).
[ADDRESS_29358], combining gastrectomy, cytoreduction, and HIPEC likely results in increased morbidity and mortality compared to 
gastrectomy alone as shown in a recent systematic review reporting 30- day mo rbidity and mortality 
rates of 22% and 5 %.
[ADDRESS_29359] that 
performing laparoscopic HIPEC without cytoreduction and gastrectomy is a low risk procedure.  A recent systematic review of laparoscopic hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy suggests this is a safe procedure with no mortalities and < 10% morbidity in 183 patients.  Of note, however, is 
that only 5 patients in this series  underwent this procedure as part of a neoadjuvant approach prior 
to cancer treatment.
11   
Our group is now finishing our initial Phase II trial of laparoscopic HIPEC for patients with gastric cancer and radiologically -occult carcinomatosis or positive cytology (2013- 0989).  This novel trial 
has demonstrated the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic preoperative HIPEC, and our early 
Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center 
2016-0269 
Revised  July 20, 2018      
Protocol v.03 Page 6  
 
results regarding survival are encouraging.  Nineteen patients were enrolled and treated with 36  
laparoscopic HIPEC procedures.  Median age was 51 (range 29- 69). Six patients had positive 
cytology only and 13 had carcinomatosis.  All patients were treated with systemic chemotherapy 
prior to enrollment with a median of 8 cycles (range 3- 12). Twelve patients were also treated with 
chemoradiation therapy.  Post -HIPEC major morbidity rate was 3% with no mortalities.   Median 
length of stay was 3 days (range 3- 6).  Five  patients have gone on  to gastrectomy.  Median follow -
up was 15.1 m onths. The OS rate at 2 years was 90.9% (95% CI: 75.4% - 100%).   
However, only [ADDRESS_29360] learned from our previous 
trial, create a trial focused on cytoreduction with HIPEC, and expand the inclusion criteria to include 
patients with radiologically -evident carcinomatosis.  Therefore, the purpose of this clinical trial is to 
determine the efficacy and safety of  cytoreduction, gastrectomy, and hyperthermic intraperitoneal 
chemotherapy with Mitomycin C and Cisplatin in patients  with stage IV gastric cancer limited to the 
peritoneum after treatment with  systemic chemotherapy.

4.0 DESIGN AND METHODS  
1) Subjects with gastric and gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma and positive peritoneal cytology 
or carcinomatosis that have completed treatment with systemic chemotherapy and 
laparoscopic HIPEC will be offered participation in the study.  Type and duration of systemic chemotherapy will be left to the discretion of the treating medical oncologist.  Patients may also receive treatment with chemoradiation therapy.  Duration and frequency of preoperative 
laparoscopic HIPEC procedures will be left to the discretion of the treating surgical 
oncologist.  Subjects may be inpatients or outpatients.  Subjects should have a contrast CT 
scan , MRI, or PET/CT scan  within 6 weeks (42 days) of enrollment. Patients will have 
completed standard systemic therapy and lapa roscopic HIEPC administration prior to 
enrollment .  Enrollment will occur within 30 days of treatment initiation.   This will occur after 
chemotherapy, and often, chemoradiation therapy
.  Lack of imaging evidence of solid organ 
metastatic disease will be defined based on radiologic (CT scan , MRI, or PET/CT ) imaging. 
Evidence of carcinomatosis or positive cytology will be based on clinical crit eria (see 
eligibility criteria). HIPEC will be administered as defined by [CONTACT_760]. Gastrectomy and cytoreduction will be performed according to standard of care.  Patients will undergo 
treatment  as displayed in Figure 1.  The  HIPEC procedure will consist of Mitomycin C 30 mg

Type of Study:  Prospective phase II, single institution clinical trial.  
 Procedures and Treatment Plan  
1. HIPEC: Mitomycin C 30 mg and Cisplatin 20 0 mg in 3 -7 liters of infusate will be 
administered using a rolling pump with hyperthermia  for 60 minutes.  
Surgery:  
1. Cytoreduction, Gastrectomy, & HIPEC: Cytoreduction will be obtained of any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_30009] .  
Subtotal or total gastrectomy will be performed according to standard surgical technique.  Extent of lymph node dissection will be left to the discretion of the operating surgeon.   Once the cytoreduction and gastrectomy portion of the procedure are 
concluded, inflow and outflow catheters will placed.  Crystalloid  perfusate will be 
circulated using an extracorporeal circulation device at a flow rate of 700-1, 500 
mL/minute.  Once the heated perfusion is established per standard of care, M itomycin 
30 mg and Cisplatin 20 0 mg will be instilled.  Although there is variability in the 
perfusate temperature during the operation, target inflow temperature will be 41- 42ºC 
with target outflow of 39 -40ºC .  Manipulation of the inflow temperature will be allowed to 
maintain an esophageal probe temperature level of < [ADDRESS_29364] of care. 
Sodium thiosulfate:  A loading dose and 12 hour continuous infusion of sodium 
thiosulfate will be administered to limit the systemic toxicity of  cisplatin. A loading dose 
of 7.5 gm/M
2 of sodium thiosulfate will be diluted in 20 ml/kg of 0.9% normal saline up to 
500 mL. The total loading dose is not to exceed 12.5 grams.  This loading dose will be 
infused over 20 minutes prior to  or during  addition  of cisplatin to the peritoneal perfusion 
circuit. Then a maintenance infusion of sodium thiosulfate 25.56 gm/M2 will be delivered 
by [CONTACT_30023] [ADDRESS_29365] of care.  Recorded on

Correlative Studies: Tissue Banking  
All tissue samples will be collected according to MD Anderson  Tissue Protocol LAB01 -[ADDRESS_29368] format is on file with the IRB (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_30010] A. Ajani, 
M.D.).  Patients are consented prior to any endoscopic procedures performed at MD Anderson.  Per the protocol and consent, i f the patient requires surgery as part of his/her treatment, a 
portion of the remaining tissue will be stored.  No additional surgical maneuvers or procedures 
are necessary for the collection of study tissues, since all tissue samples will be collected from tissue that has already been removed as part of standard care. When feasible, tissue adequate 
for preparation of 50 slides (5 mm thick) will be stored from each collection. In brief, the objectives of this protocol are to:  
1. To collect and store, both prospectively and retrospectively, tissue, blood, body fluids and information for the sole purpose of banking pre- malignant and malignant lesions of 
the gastrointestinal tract. An IRB approved Informed Consent  in standard format is on 
file with the IRB.  
Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center 
2016-[ADDRESS_29369] at the University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson 
Cancer Center (UTMDACC).  
3. To collect, store, and analyze data on patients with gastrointestinal malignancies  of the 
University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC) from patients’ primary physicians or other treatment centers prior to, during and after the patients’ visits at UTMDACC.  
4. To collect, store or discard residual tissue, blood and other body fluids obtained during the performance of research activities for which consent and authorization have been obtained from the participant.  
  5.0 STATISTICS AND JUSTIFICATION OF SAMPLE SIZE  
 This is a single- center, single arm phase II trial of cytoreduction, gastrectomy, and HIPEC in 
patients with gastric  cancer metastatic to the peritoneum.  The primary endpoint in this study is 
overall survival, as measured from the time of diagnosis  of stage IV disease.  A maximum of 
30 patients will be enrolled into this study at an expected accrual rate of 1 to 2 pati ents per 
month . 
 Sample size and power  
The primary endpoint is overall survival.  A retrospective study showed that median OS is 11 
months for patients with positive peritoneal cytology or gross metastatic disease at laparoscopy.
6  For the futility monitoring of overall survival (OS), we have therefore assumed a 
median OS of 11 months for historical treatment and a median of 15 months (i.e., 4 months improvement ) with the experimental therapy, based on reports from other centers that utilize 
cytoreduction and HIPEC in the treatment of metastatic gastric cancer.
12   
 The study  will be continuously monitored for the primary endpoint, OS, using the method of 
Thall, Wooten, and Tannir.
2  It is assumed that the OS for each patient is exponentially 
distributed with a median of λ E among patients who receive the experimental treatment  and a 
median of λH for the historical treatment.   Further, λ H was assumed to follow an inverse 
gamma distribution, i.e., λ H ~ IG(60, 649),  which has a mean of  [ADDRESS_29370] the little prior knowledge of λ E we assumed an inverse gamma prior distribution 
with the same mean of 11 months and a much larger variance of 121, i.e., λE ~ IG(3, 22).  The 
trial will be stopped early if Pr( λE  > λH +δdata) < pL, where δ = [ADDRESS_29371]=0.[ADDRESS_29372] (CTC) website 
(https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org/ClinicalTrialConduct/) maintained by [CONTACT_30027].

The operating characteristics of the design, based on an overall assumed accrual rate of 1.5  
patient s per month with 5000 simulated trials per scenario, are given in the following table:  
 
Scenario  True Median   
(months)  Pr(Stopped

5 15 0.078  28.8 78.6 
 One-Arm Time -to-Event Simulator (version 3.0.1) was used to run the simulations and 
generate the OC table.  
 Justification of Sample Size:  
If we assume an exponential distribution for the overall survival time and an uniform distribution for the censoring time, then with sample size of 30 patients, the estimated 95% confidence interval for median OS will range from 8.5 months to 25.2 months when the true median OS is 15 months.  Alternatively, if the true median OS is 11 months, then the estimated 95% 
confidence interval will be 6.4 to 18.1 months. The sample size justification was based on 1000 simulations.  
 Statistical Analysis:  
All patients who received treatment will be included in the analysis for efficacy and safety.  Demographic/clinical characteristics and safety data of the patients will be summarized using descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation, median and range. Overall survival time will be estimated using the Kaplan- Meier method. Patients who drop out of the study will 
be included in the time to event data as “censored data”.  The two- sided log- rank test will be 
used to assess the differences of time to events between groups.  As a secondary analysis, w e 
will also analyze overall survival, using surgery date as the start time.  
 6.0 Monitoring for early death  
 Death within 30 days from surgery will be monitored.   A recent series of patients undergoing 
this procedure reported a postoperative mortality rate of 5%.
12  Denote the probability of early 
death rate by T deathD30 . We assume T LE ~ beta (0.05, 0.95). We will monitor for early mortality in 
cohort size of 10, starting from the 10th patient, and we will stop the enrollment if Pr(T deathD30  > 
0.05 | data) >0.9. That is, we will stop the trial early if at any interim assessment in cohort sizes 
of 10  we determine that there is more than 90% chance that the rate of death within 30 days is 
more than 5%. The corresponding stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_30011] (number of patients died with in 30 days from surgery / number of pati ents) ≥2/10, 3/20.  The trial will be 
stopped if [ADDRESS_29373] 10 patients.  The operating characteristics are listed in table 2.

3PROTOCOL SUMMARY
Study Title:   A Phase [ADDRESS_56891] of MLN0128 on the QTc Interval in Patients 
With Advanced Solid Tumors
Number of Patients:   Approximately 30 patients will be enrolled in this study.
Study Objectives
Primary
To ch aracterize the effect of a single dose of 40 mg MLN0128 on the electrocardiographic
QT/QTc interval in patients with advanced solid tumors
Secondary
To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of MLN0128 in patients with
advanced solid tumor s
Overview of Study Design:   This is an open label, single -arm, multicenter study to evaluate the 
effect of a single dose of 40 mg MLN0128 on the QT/QTc interval in patients with advanced solid 
tumors.  The study will enable collection of time -matched pha rmacokinetic (PK) and 
electrocardiogram (ECG) data before and after MLN0128 administration at the time points specified 
in the Schedule of Events.  A central ECG reader will be used and continuous 12 -lead digita l ECGs 
will be obtained using a Holter H12+ ECG recorder.  All planned 12 -lead ECG collections will be 
obtained in triplicate.
On the morning of Screening; Day -1 baseline measurements of serial triplicate ECGs (0 -10hours) 
will be obtained.  Three Holter ECGs will be extracted at the time points that match the Cycle 1, Day 
1 PK/ECG sampling times.  The clock time of ECG assessments on Screening; Day -1 should 
coincide with the clock time of PK/ECG assessments for Cycle 1, Day 1.  After collection of the 
planned 10- hour ECG sample on Cycle 1, Day 1, the Holter recorders will not be removed and 
patients will be furloughed from the study site.  
On Screening; Day -[ADDRESS_56892] 2 hours before 
the scheduled baseline triplicate ECG on each day.  If patients report to the site fasted, they should 
do so with adequate time (approximately 3 hours before the schedu led baseline triplicate ECG) in 
order to eat a light, standard breakfast provided by [CONTACT_53315] 
2hours before the scheduled baseline triplicate ECG on each day. Patients will be instructed not to 
eat for the next 6 h ours (ie, 2 hours before the 0 -hour, predose time point and until completion of the 
collection of the 4- hour postdose PK/ECG assessments).  Light meals will be administered at the 
same time on Screening; Day -1 and Cycle 1, Day 1.  
In addition, all patien ts will be issued a glucometer and trained to use it to monitor their daily 
predose fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels at home for the days on which glucose is not measured at 
the clinic.  Patients will be instructed to notify the study staff immediately w ith any abnormal 
readings (ie, ≥ 150 mg/dL) for further instructions on the management of hyperglycemia.  In -home 
glucose monitoring is not required on days when fasting glucose is measured in the clinic.
To mitigate nausea and vomiting known to occur at a 40mg dose of MLN0128, patients will be 
administered an antiemetic agent (0.25 mg palonosetron) on Cycle 1, Day 1.  
After collection of the 10 -hour postdose PK/ECG assessment on Cycle 1, Day 1, patients will be 
furloughed from the study site.  The Holter recorders will not be removed during this furlough

4period.
On Cycle 1, Day 2 and Cycle 1, Day 3, patients may eat and drink up to approximately 2 hours 
befor e arriving at the study site for PK/ECG evaluations.
On Cycle 1, Day 2, patients will report to th e clinical facility at least 1 hour before the 24 -hour 
postdose PK/ECG (triplicate) assessments.  After the PK/ECG assessments are completed, the Holter 
recorders will be removed and patients will be furloughed from the study site.  
On Cycle 1, Day 3, pat ients will report to the clinical facility at least 1 hour before the 48 -hour 
postdose assessments, which will represent the final study endpoint -specific planned PK/ECG 
assessments.  
After completing the PK/ECG assessments on Cycle 1, Day 3, patients may continue to receive 
MLN0128 if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the patient is deriving clinical benefit, until they 
experience disease progression.  Patients continuing treatment with MLN0128 at the discretion of the 
investigator will receive a dose of MLN0128 up to 30 mg every week (QW).  Dose escalation will 
not be permitted, and a maximum of 2 dose reductions (for patients experiencing study drug -related 
toxicity) will be permitted.  Patients will return to the study site for follow -up visits at th e time points 
in the Schedule of Events .  Treatment may continue until disease progression, unacceptable 
MLN0128- related toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or for up to 12 months (whichever occurs first).  
All pat ients enrolled in the study will attend the End of Study/Early Termination visit 30 (to 40) days 
after receiving their last dose of study drug.
Toxicity will be evaluated according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (AEs), Version 4.03, effective date 14 June 2010.  AEs will be assessed, and 
laboratory values, vital signs, and ECGs will be obtained to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
MLN0128.
Radiological evaluations (computed tomography [CT] scan or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] as 
clinically indicated) will be obtained at baseline and Cycle 3, Day 28, after which point CT (with 
contrast) or MRI may be performed every 3 cycles at the investigator’s discretion as clinically 
indicated, according to standard of care.

When the timing of a blood sample for PK or safety laboratory analysis coincides with the timin g of ECG measurements, the ECG will be completed before 
the collection of the blood sample.  The triplicate ECG measurements should be completed immediately before the corresponding blood sample for PK or 
safety laboratory analysis.  
See Section 7.4.16 for information regarding fasting periods that are required in advance of PK/ECG testing.
aHolter monitors will be used to collect triplicate ECG measurements.  Holter ECG measurements will be performed over the cour se of 15 min utes (at 
least [ADDRESS_56909] ECG measurement, and then a 10 -minute period of extracting the triplicate ECG measurements at approximately 
2-to5-minute intervals).  Timing of ECG collection on Screening; Day -1 should match PK/ECG collect ion on C1D1 to enable appropriate baseline 
correction.
bMLN0128 will be administered to patients at the clinic on C1D1.  If a patient is deemed not evaluable by [CONTACT_456], the pos tdose C1D1 Holter ECG 
monitoring and PK sampling procedures need not be pe rformed.  Refer to Section
 7.6for additional information.

181.   BACKGROUND A ND STUDY RATIONALE
1.1   Scientific Background
1.1.1    Disease Under Treatment
The m ammalian (or m echanist ic) target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a central regulator of cell 
growth, m etabo lism, and angiogenesis that functions in [ADDRESS_56920] mult iprotein complexes, 
mTORcomplex 1 (TORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (TORC2).  Like rapamycin, several 
newly approved rapalogs (temsiro limus and evero limus) are specific and allo steric inhibitors 
of TORC1, but only  parti ally inhibi t TORC1 substrates.  They  do not di rectly inhibit 
TORC2, which has shown to be an emerging target in cancer research.  MLN0128 is a novel 
select ive, orally bioavailable mTOR inhibitor that targets both TORC1 and TORC2, which 
may lead to increased ant itumor activit y.
1.1.2    Study Drug
mTOR Inhibitors
The m TOR serin e/threonine kinase has a central role in regulat ing cellular growth and 
metabo lism in response to external environmental factors.(1, 2)  The m TOR kinase binds with 
other proteins to form [ADDRESS_56921] ivity of the ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) and eukary otic init iation 
factor 4 -binding protein (4E -BP1).(3)  The TORC2 comp lex is act ivated by [CONTACT_53317], proliferat ion, and act in cytoskeleton organizat ion by 
[CONTACT_53318], such as serine/threonine -specific protein kinase 
(AKT; also known as protein kinase B), which is a regulator of apoptosis.(4, 5
)  
Two m ajor classes of m TOR inhibi tors are under development:  allo steric inhib itors and 
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) -competitive inhibitors.  The first -generat ion, or allo steric, 
inhibitors include rapamycin and the related analogs or rapalogs temsiro limus, evero limus, 
and ri daforolimus.  The rapalogs effect ively inhibit  phosphoryla tion of  S6K but only  
partially inhibi t the phosphorylat ion of 4E -BP1, which regulates cap -dependent translation 
of transcri pts for cell survival, proliferat ion, and angiogenesis.(2)  Thus, rapamycin and the 
rapal ogs are only partial inhibitors of TORC1.(2
)  
The ATP -competitive inhibitors (also known as mTOR kinase inhibitors or TORKinibs), 
such as MLN0128, bind to the catalyt ic domain o f mTORand thus inhibit both TORC1 and

MLN0128
Clinical Study Protocol C31002 Protocol Amendment 2
19TORC2 com plexes, including the rapamycin -insensi tive or -resistant acti ons of TORC1, 
such as phosphorylat ion of 4E -BP1.(6, 7, 8)
The rapalogs temsiro limus and everolimus have been approved by [CONTACT_24623] (US) 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as monotherapy  for pati ents wi th advanced renal cell 
carcino ma (temsiro limus and everolimus), advanced pancreat ic neuroendocrine tumors 
(evero limus), and subependymal giant cell astrocytoma associated with tuberous sclerosis 
(evero limus).  However, resistance to single -agent rapalog therapy  occurs and may  be 
related to ei ther inco mplete inhibit ion of the targeted pathway  (such as phosphorylation of 
4E-BP1 as discussed above) or loss of S6K -mediated feedback inhibit ion of growth factor 
receptor si gnaling l eading to paradoxic hyperact ive signaling.  The normal feedback loop 
involves act ivated S6K, which phosphorylates and inact ivates insulin receptor substrate -1 
and inhibit s signaling through the phospho inosit ide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway.(5, 9
)  In the 
presence of rapalogs, the feedback loop is abrogated, leading to continued PI3K signaling, 
TORC2 activat ion, and subsequent phosphoryl ation of AKT at Threonine 308 (T308) and 
Serine 473 (S473), which markedly enhances the activit y of AKT.(2, 5,
9)   
The l oss of feedback inhibit ion by [CONTACT_53319].  In an 
analysis of eit her paired fresh tumor samples or skin biopsies obtained fro m 55 pati ents who 
received different doses of evero limus eit her daily or weekly in a phase 1 trial, everolimus 
inhibited TORC1 in a dose -and schedule -dependent m anner wi th near com plete inhibit ion 
of S6K.(10)  Half the paired tumor samples had a posttreatment increase in the 
phosphorylat ion of AKT at S473.(10
)  These results provide direct evidence that loss of S6K 
feedback and subsequent PI3K/TORC2- induced activat ion of AKT occurs commo nly in 
patients wi th solid tum ors receiving single -agent everolimus.
MLN0128 is a potent, highly select ive, ATP -competitive inhibitor of mTOR.  MLN0128 is 
mechanist ically dist inct from the allo steric inhibi tors of  mTOR (rapamycin and its 
derivat ives, referred to as rapalogs).  The rapalogs only partially inhibit TORC1, whereas 
MLN0128 inhibit s both TORC1 (more completely S6K and 4E -BP1) and TORC2.  Dual 
TORC1 /2 inhibit ion mitigates feedback activation of PI3K and AKT, known to cause 
resistance to TORC1 -only inhibi tors.(11)
1.2   Nonclinical Experience
MLN0128 inhibited the human ether -à-go- go related gene (hERG) potassium ion channel 
with a concentration producing 50% inhibit ion (IC 50) of approximately [ADDRESS_56922] on the

20hERG channel at efficacious exposures in humans.  Addit ionally , a Good Laboratory  
Practi ce (GLP)- compliant cardi ovascular safet y study  in telemeteri zed monkeys 
demonstrated no effects on the body  temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, or 
electrocardi ogram  (ECG) endpoints.  There were also no effects on cardiovascular or 
respi [INVESTIGATOR_53279]0128 in GLP -compliant toxico logy studi es.  In the 
GLP -compliant, single -agent study  of MLN0128 in Sprague -Dawl ey rats, gai t effects were 
observed on Day 28; however, no similar effects have been observed in humans. 
The toxi city profile of MLN0128 in rats and monkeys, as established in GLP -compliant 
repeat -dose studies, is consistent with pharmacologic inhibit ion of mTORC1/2 activit y.  The 
dose limit ing toxicit ies (DLTs) of MLN0128 in rats and mo nkeys were secondary to an 
exaggerated pharmaco logic response and consisted of body  weight loss and associ ated 
clinical observat ions that included gastrointestinal (GI) distress and decreased activit y, 
appeti te, and body  temperature.  Addi tional findings in rat and monkey repeat -dose 
toxicology studi es wi th MLN0128 included bone marrow and lympho id deplet ion, GI and 
skin effects, and effects on glucose and insulin levels, all o f which can be monitored in 
clinical trials.  The toxicit ies seen in the repeat -dose toxico logy studi es, such as GI effects 
and glucose and insulin increases, are consistent wit h the treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs), including mucosit is and hyperglycemia, which have been observed to date in 
patients receiving MLN0128.
MLN0128 was negat ive in the Ames assay, in vivo  com et assay , and in vivo micronucleus 
assay.  An in vitro chromosomal aberr ation assay  was posi tive.  Thus, current evidence 
supports a l ow ri sk for genotoxicit y for MLN0128.
Recent ly co mpleted in vitro metabo lism experiments in human hepatocytes using 
14C-labeled MLN0128 suggest that MLN0128 is metabolized primarily  via CYP1A2 
(approximately 31% to 40%), with a minor contribution from CYP3A4 (approximately 11% 
to 22%).  These data suggest that MLN0128 is also metabo lized by [CONTACT_53320] 
(approximately 22%) and an unident ified non -uridine diphosphate gl ucuronosyltransfer ase 
pathway  (approximately 18%).  The new data differ from the previous in vitro CYP 
phenoty pi[INVESTIGATOR_53280], which suggested the 
involvement of CYP2C9 (approximately 35%), CYP2C19 (approximately 28%), and 
CYP3A4 (approximat ely 28%) in MLN0128 metabo lism.
In addit ion, physio logically based PK modeling and simulat ion using the new metabo lism 
data for MLN0128 suggest that the risk for a metabo lism-based drug- drug i nteracti on wi th

Clinical Study Protocol C31002 Protocol Amendment 2
21MLN0128 appears to be low.  Therefore, strong CY P1A2 inhibitors and CYP inducers (see 
Secti on14.4) should only  be administered wi th cauti on and at the discretion of the 
investigator during the study . Alternat ive treatments, if available, should be considered.
MLN0128 exhibi ts an inverse pH dependent aqueous solubilit y, having l ow sol ubility at 
high pH.  pH modifying agents such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), H 2-receptor 
antagonists, or neutralizing antacids that can increase stomach pH can reduce MLN0128 
absorpti on.  In t his study PPIs are not permitted; however, restricted use of H 2-receptor 
antagonists and neutralizing antacids is permitted (refer to Section 6.5and Section 6.6).

may be found in the Investi gator’s Brochure (IB) .
1.3   Clinical Experience
Single-agent MLN0128 i s in clinical development with 2 phase 1 studies:  a study  in pati ents 
with advan ced so lid malignancies (INK128- 001) and a study  in patients with relapsed or 
refractory  multiple myel oma or Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (INK128 -002).  A thi rd 
phase 1 study  of MLN0128 is in combinat ion with paclitaxel wit h or without trastuzumab in 
patients with advanced so lid tumors (INK128- 003).  These studies have been designed to 
investigate the safet y, pharmacokinet ics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy 
of MLN0128 for the treatment of advanced so lid tumors and hematologic malignancies 
either as a single agent or in combinat ion with chemotherapy  and/or human epi [INVESTIGATOR_53281] 2 (HER2) -targeting agents.  A phase 1b/2 study  of MLN0128 in 
combinat ion with exemestane or fulvestrant therapy  in wom en wi th estrogen receptor 
positive (ER+)/HER2 negat ive (HER2 ) advanced or metastatic breast cancer (Study  
C31001) is enro lling patients.  Addit ionally, the combinat ion of MLN0128 wit h MLN1117 
(an oral  PI3Kα inhibitor) is being evaluated in a phase 1b study  in adult patients with 
advance d nonhematol ogic malignancies (Study C32001).

It is recommended that patients be treated init ially with a fast-acting insulin sensit izer, such 
as metformin at 500 mg orally QD, and titrat e up to a maximum o f 1000 m g orally twice 
daily  as needed.  Concurrent addit ion to m etformin of dipeptidyl pept idase -4 inhibitors (eg, 
sitaglipt in or vildaglipt in) and/or insulin should also be considered.  Oral sulfo nylureas (eg, 
glipi[INVESTIGATOR_53289]) s hould be used wit h caution due to the higher risk of inducing 
hypoglycemia in pat ients.  The dose of oral hypoglycemic agents should be adjusted in

[IP_ADDRESS]    Serial, Triplicate, 12- Lead Holter Monitorin g Electrocardiograms
The study  ECGs that are included in the final statistical analysis will be acquired fro m the 
12-lead continuous ECG (Holter) recorders using the H -12 Pl us ambulatory  
electrocardi ograph recorder (Mortara Instruments, Milwaukee, WI), wit h high-frequency 
flashcards at a sampling rate of 1000 samples per second.
On Screening; Day -1, Hol ter ECG m onitoring (0 -10 hours) will be performed for baseline 
measurements.  Three serial triplicate ECGs will be extracted at prespecified time po ints at 
times that match the times of Cycle 1, Day  1 postdose PK/ECG sampling.
As the Screening; Day -1 baseline evaluations are intended to serve as a time- matched 
baseline for corresponding Cycle 1, Day  1 ECG eval uations, it is critical to ensure that the 
0-hour time point on Screening; Day  
-1 is timed to coincide with the clock time of the time 
of dosing o f MLN0128 on Cycle 1, Day  1 (whi ch will  be consi dered the 0 -hour time po int 
on Cy cle 1, Day 1). 
Before each nominal ECG time po int, the patient must have been supi[INVESTIGATOR_53304] 
5minutes.  The triplicate ECGs will be extracted at approximately [ADDRESS_56982] peri od (the ECG extraction 15-minute window, 
ending at the no minal t ime point).  Blood samples for PK a nalysis will be obtained 
immediately  following the com pletion of the ECG extractions.  
Addit ionally , pati ents will undergo Holter ECG monitoring on Cycle 1, Day  [ADDRESS_56983] of steady -state 
concentrations of MLN0128 on QT/QTc intervals.  
The 12- lead ECGs are extracted in triplicate, free from artifact, wandering, and at a time that 
the heart rate has been stabilized.  All QT intervals will be measured using representative 
beats in the superimposed 12 -lead “global” display.  The measurement of QT, RR, PR, and 
QRS intervals are init iated in the semi -autom atic mode and then adjusted appropriatel y 
by 
[CONTACT_53336]; thereby, they  are visually  validated or m anually adjusted and 
diagnosti c findings are determined.  The cardiovascular physicians are assigned in a subject -

overnight (nothing except water and/or medicat ions after midnight or for a minimum of 
8hours) for each of these measurements beginning on Cycle 1, Day 4; see Sect ion 7.4.16 for 
fasting requirements.  Patients will be instructed to bring the gluco meter wi th them  to each 
study  visit so that the data collected can be reviewed and recorded into source documents.  
Based on investigator judg ment and upon the 6 consecut ive months of well -controlled blood 
glucose l evels, the frequency of in -home fasting glucose testing may be reduced to twice 
weekly.  During this period of reduced monitoring, patients will cont inue to notify the 
investigator of fasting blood glucose levels that exceed 150 mg/dL.  If blood glucose levels 
are not well controlled at any  time during the study, or if the pat ient requi res ei ther oral  
hypoglycemic agents or insulin to control blood glucose levels, in -home testing of fa sting 
blood glucose levels will be resumed daily wit h the provided gluco meter.  On study  visit 
days where fast ing glucose is assessed in the clinic, the in -home daily fast ing glucose 
monitoring does not need to be completed.

8.1.7    Electrocardiogram Analysis
Determination of QTcI
The QTcI will be based on the slope (exponent) of the QT -RR r elationship derived fro m the 
acquisit ion of QT intervals fro m a 24-hour Holter recording on Screening; Day  -1 (baseline) 
for each pat ient.  The pati ent-specific, individual correction is an improvement over the 
fixed formulas commo nly deplo yed.  The patien t-specific slope will be calculated using all 
pairs of QT and RR interval data on Screening; Day  -1 separately for each pat ient.  The 
linear regressio n:  log (QT) = l og (a) + b*l og (RR) will be used to calculate the individual 
slope (b) for each pat ient.  The QTcI will be calculated as:  QTcI = QT/RRb.
Electrocardiogram Analysis
The primary  analysis of ECG parameters from the 24 -hour Holter recordings will be based 
on a repeated measures mixed effects linear model.  Mean changes (adjusted) and 1 -sided 
95% u pper confidence bounds in QTcI, QTcF, QTcB, and heart rate will be generated for 
each of the time -matched changes fro m baseline.  Descript ive statistics for the actual values 
of ECG intervals (QTcI, QTcF, QTcB, PR interval, RR interval, QRS duration) and h eart 
rate will be tabulated by  [CONTACT_53339] t ime point.
The fo llowing categori cal analyses of QTc intervals (QTcI and QTcF), PR interval, and 
QRS duration will be performed at each scheduled time po int and on the maximum value for 
each patient:
QTc interval > 450 m sec

New ECG morpho logies, not present at Screening; Day  -1 (baseline), will be summarized.
8.1.[ADDRESS_56996] ics will be presented for plasma PK parameters including, but not limited to, C max, 
Tmax, AUC t, AUC inf, and t 1/2.  Individual and mean MLN0128 plasma concentration -time 
data will be plotted.
PK/QTc Analysis
The rel ationship between plasma MLN0128 concentration and effects on he art rate and 
QTcI/QTcF will be analyzed using nonlinear mixed effects modeling.  It is expected that the 
relationship between plasma MLN0128 concentratio ns and change fro m time- matched 
baseline values of QTc will be described using a direct linear concentrati on-effect 
relationship; however, the select ion of the final mo del and m athemat ical form of the 
concentration -effect rel ationship will be based on graphical assessment of the data (eg, 
visual examinat ion of observed concentration -effect pl ots to rul e out a hysteresis secondary  
to time -delayed effects on QTc) and exploration of alternate structural models (eg, 
maximum effect attributed to the drug [E max] models).  The final model will be used to 
predi ct the popul ation average change in QTc and its correspo nding 1 -sided 95% upper 
confidence bounds in the mean steady -state C maxof MLN0128 after a single dose of 40 mg

requi re medical or surgi cal intervent ion to prevent [ADDRESS_57001] ious agent.    
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatm ent in an emergency  room  or at hom e, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not resul t in inpat ient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_3094], or the develo pment of drug dependency or 
drug a buse; any organism, virus, or infect ious parti cle (eg, pri on protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or nonpathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.  
In thi s study , intensi ty for each AE, including any  lab abnormalit y, will be determined using 
the NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03, effect ive date 14 June 2010.(
13)  Clar ification should be 
made between a serious AE (SAE) and an AE that is considered severe in intensit y (Grade 3 
or 4), because the terms serious and severe ar e NOT synonymous.  The general term severe
is often used to describe the intensit y (severi ty) of a specific event; the event itself, however, 
may be of relat ively minor medical significance (such as a Grade 3 headache).  This is NOT 
the sam e as serious , which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria described 
above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or abilit y to

For example, a white blood cell (WBC) count of 1000/mm3to less than 2000 i s considered 
Grade 3 (severe) but may not be considered serious.  Seriousness (not intensit y) serves as a 
guide for defining regul atory  reporting obligat ions.
9.2   Procedures for Rec ording and Reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse 
Events
All AEs spontaneously reported by  [CONTACT_53341]/or in response to an open question fro m 
study  personnel or revealed by  [CONTACT_16037], physical  examinat ion, or other diagnostic 
procedures will be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF (see Sect ion 9.3for the 
period of  observat ion).  Any clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory  assessments or 
other clinical finding is considered an AE.  Wh en possible, signs and symptoms indicat ing a 
commo n underlying pathology  shoul d be noted as 1 com prehensive event.
Regardless of causalit y, SAEs and serious pretreatment events (as defined in Sect ion 9.1) 
must b e reported (see Section 9.3for the period of observat ion) by [CONTACT_53342] (contact [CONTACT_53343]).  This should be done by [CONTACT_29658] t he SAE Form within [ADDRESS_57003] Information

relationship of the event to study  procedures.
Intensit y for each AE, including any lab abnormality , will  be determined using the 
NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03, effective date 14 June 2010 .(13)  The criteria are prov ided in the 
Study  Manual.
Relationship to study  drug administration will be determined by [CONTACT_51261]:  Is there a reasonable possibilit y that the AE is associated with the 
study  drug?
9.3   Monitoring of Adverse Events and Period of Observation
AEs, both nonserious and serious, will be mo nitored throughout the study  as fo llows:
AEs will be reported from the first dose of study  drug through [ADDRESS_57005] dose of study  drug and recorded i n the eCRFs.    
Serious pretreatm ent events will be reported to the Millennium Department of 
Pharmacovigilance or designee from the time of the signing of the informed consent 
form (ICF) up to first dose of study  drug, but will not be recorded in the eCRF.
Related and unrelated SAEs will be reported to the Millennium Department of 
Pharmacovigilance or designee from the first dose of study  drug through 30days 
after administrati on of  the l ast dose of study  drug and recorded in the eCRF.  After 
this peri od, onl y related SAEs must be reported to the Millennium Department of 
Pharmacovigilance or designee.  SAEs should be mo nitored until they are resolved 
or are cl early  determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condit ion or 
intercurrent illness(es).

7614.6   Amendment 2 Detailed Summary of Changes
The primary  secti on(s) of the protocol affected by [CONTACT_51280] 2 are 
indicated.  The corresponding text has been revised throu ghout the protocol.
Change 1: Remove the exclu sion criterion rel ating to treatment with strong CYP inhibitors 
or inducers.
The primary  change occurs in Section 5.2Exclusio n Cri teria:
Deleted 
text:16. Pati ents requi ring treatment with strong CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 inducers 
and/or inhibitors and moderate inhibitors of CYP2C9.  Treatment with strong 
CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 inducers and/or inhibitors must be discont inued at least 
[ADDRESS_57031] dose of study 
drug. 
Rationale for Change:
This change, which removes enrollment restrict ions for pati ents taking CYP3A4, CYP2C9, 
or CYP2C19 inhibitors and/or inducers in this study, was made to allow more flexibilit y in 
patient enrollment based on updated data on MLN0128 metab olism by [CONTACT_53350].
Change 2: Update the list of concomitant medications prohibited during the study.
The primary  change occurs in Section 6.5Excluded Concomitant Medicat ions and 
Procedures :
Previous text: Strong CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 inducers and/or inhibitors and moderate 
inhibitors of CYP2CP. After complet ing the required PK/ECG assessment 
period (Cy cle1, Day 3), treatm ent wi th 1 or m ore of the strong CYP3A4 
or CYP2C19 inhibitors and/or inducers and moderate inhibitors of 
CYP2CP m ay be considered after consultat ion with the proj ect clinician.  
A list of strong inhibitors and strong inducers of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and 
CYP3A4 is included in Sect ion14.4.

Clinical Study Protocol C31002 Protocol Amendment 2
77Amended or 
new wording:Strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 inhibitors and CYP CYP3A4 and 
CYP2C19 inducers and/or inhibitors and moderate inhibitors of CYP2CP. 
After com pleting the required PK/ECG assessment period (Cycle 1, 
Day 3),inducers should be administered with caution and at the 
discretion of the investigator.  See treatm ent wi th 1 or m ore of the strong 
CYP3A4 or CYP2C19 inhibitors and/or inducers and modera te inhibitors 
of CYP2CP m ay be considered after consultation with the project clinician.  
A list of strong inhibitors and strong inducers of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and 
CYP3A4 is included in .  Refer to Secti on14.[ADDRESS_57032] of these agents .  
Alternative treatments, if available, should be considered.
Rationale for Change:
This change was made to update the recommendat ions on concomitant medicat ion use during 
the study  based on MLN0128 metabo lism by [CONTACT_53351] 3: Update the description of potential drug -drug interactions.
The primary  change occurs in Section 1.2Nonclinical Experience
Initial 
wording:In-vitro, MLN0128 is m etabo lized by [CONTACT_53352] P450 (CYP) enzymes, 
including 2C19 (35%), 3A4 (28%), and 2C9 (28%); MLN0128 neit her inhibited 
nor induced any of the major CYP enzymes.  Additionally , MLN0128 di d not 
inhib it P-glycoprotein (P -gp) but did inhibit breast cancer resistance.  At the 
plasma concentrations expected with the 40 mg dose of MLN0128, there exists a 
risk for a drug -drug interaction (DDI) with substrates of breast cancer -resistant 
protein (BCRP) (eg, m ethotrexate, i rinotecan, rosuvastatin, topotecan, lapat inib, 
imatinib, etc.).  Such agents should be avo ided from co-administration with 
MLN0128.   Since MLN0128 is metabolized by [CONTACT_53353], the risk 
for clinically  significant DDI (2 -fold or great er) is considered low; however, 
given that the 40 mg dose of MLN0128 is the single agent MTD in the every 
week (QW) dosing schedule, potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 
enzymes and strong inducers of CYP enzymes should not be administered 
concomitant lywith MLN0128.
Amended 
or new 
wording:Recently completed i n-vitrometabolism experiments in human hepatocytes 
using14C-labeled MLN0128 suggest that, MLN0128 is metabolized by [CONTACT_53354]1A2 (approximately 31% to 40%), with a minor 
contribut ion from CYP3A4 (approximately 11% to 22 %). These data 
suggest that MLN0128 is also metabolized by [CONTACT_53355] 
(approximately 22%) and an unidentified non -uridine diphosphate 
glucuronosyltransferase pathway (approximately 18%). The new data 
differ from the previous in vitro CYP phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_53312], which suggested the involvement of CYP2C9 
(approximately 35%), CYP2C19 (approximately 28%), and CYP3A4 
(approximately 28%) in MLN0128 metabolism . cytochrom e P450 (CY P) 
enzymes, including 2C19 (35%), 3A4 (28%), and 2C9 (28%); MLN0128 neit her

78inhibited nor induced any of the major CYP enzymes .  Addit ionally , MLN0128 
did not inhibit P- glycoprotein (P -gp) but did inhibit breast cancer resistance.  At 
the plasma concentrat ions expected with the 40 mg dose of MLN0128, there 
exists a ri sk for a drug -drug interaction (DDI) with substrates of breast cancer -
resistant protein (BCRP) (eg, methotrexate, irinotecan, rosuvastatin, topotecan, 
lapat inib, imat inib, etc.).  Such agents s hould be avoided fro m co-administration 
with MLN0128.
Since MLN0128 is metabo lized by [CONTACT_53353], the risk for clinically 
significant DDI (2 -fold or greater) is considered low; however, given that the 40 
mg dose of MLN0128 is the single agent MTD in the every week (QW) dosing 
schedule, potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 enzymes and strong 
inducers o f CYP enzymes should not be administered concomitantly wit h 
MLN0128 .In addition, physiologically based PK modeling and simulation 
using the new me tabolism data for MLN0128 suggest that the risk for a 
metabolism -based drug-drug interaction with MLN0128 appears to be low.  
Therefore, strong CYP1A2 inhibitors and CYP inducers (see Section 0) 
should only be a dministered with caution and at the discretion of the 
investigator during the study.  Alternative treatments, if available, should 
be considered.
Rationale for Change:
This paragraph was amended to describe updated data on MLN0128 metabo lism by [CONTACT_53356].
Change 4: Update the list of relevant CYP inhibit ors and inducers.
The primary  change occurs in Section 14.[ADDRESS_57033] of Relevant Cy tochrom e P450Inhibitors and 
Inducers :
Descript ion 
of the 
change:The list of relevant CYP inhibitors and induces was updated to remove 
sections listing strong CYP2C19 inhibitors and strong CYP3 A4 inhibitors; to 
add section list ing strong and moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors; and update the 
section listing clinically significant enzyme inducers.
Rationale for Change:
This change was made for consistency wit h updated data on MLN0128 metabo lism by 
[CONTACT_53357].
Change 5: Remove the dietary restrictions related to CYP inhibitors and inducers.
The primary  change occurs in Section 6.7Precautions and Restrict ions:
Deleted 
text:Dietary  restri ctions include periods of fast ing as described in Sect ion7.4.16 , 
and in -home daily fastin g glucose m onitoring (refer to Secti on 7.4.18) .not 
consuming food or beverages containing the fruit or juices listed in Section

Rationale for Change:
This change was made for consistency wit h new data that removes the necessit y for 
restri ctions concerning CYP2C9 and 2C19.
Secti on14.[ADDRESS_57035] of Relevant Cy tochrom e P450Inhibitors and Inducers also contains this 
change.
Change 6: Insert language to reduce the required frequency of radiographic disease 
assessments for patients who have received at least 1 year of cont inuous MLN0128 treatment 
per protoc ol.
The primary  change occurs in footnote “f” in the Schedule o f Events :
Added text: For long term patients, defined as study participation ( greater than or 
equal to) [ADDRESS_57036] (with contrast)/MRI of chest, abdomen, and pelvis 
will be obtained at intervals of up to every 4 cycles (plus or minus 7 days) 
as clinically indicated.
Rationale for Change:
The change was made to reduce the burden a nd to minimize radiat ion exposure for long- term 
patients.

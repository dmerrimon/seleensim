Based on the NIH Behavioral and Social Intervention Clinical Trial Protocol Template – 20190328  3 1 PROTOCOL SUMMARY 1.1 SYNOPSIS   Title: Influence of a Game Embedded in a Smartphone App for Smoking Cessation on User Engagement: A Randomized Pi[INVESTIGATOR_265755]: In this study, we test the effects of a video game embedded in a commercially available mobile app for smoking cessation. Our hypothesis is that the game increases engagement, retention, and smoking cessation rates compared with a version of the app without the game. We will test this hypothesis in a 500-person pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], with one-half of participants randomized to receive the core app plus embedded game, and one-half of participants randomized to receive the core app only. Objective:  Our objective is to test the study feasibility, engagement, retention, and early efficacy of a ‘gamified’ smoking cessation app, compared to one without the game. Endpoints: Primary Endpoints: Engagement objectively measured by 1) total number of unique app sessions and 2) time spent per session. Secondary Endpoints: Early efficacy measured by 7- and 30-day point prevalence abstinence, engagement measured by [CONTACT_265767], satisfaction measured by [CONTACT_265768]. Study Population: 500 new adult users of the Smoke Free app who smoked 1 or more cigarettes daily prior to download will be enrolled in this study. We will set a quota to include ≥100 individuals age ≥50 years old to explore differential program effects by [CONTACT_654].  Phase: 2/3  Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants: Participants will be enrolled via recruitment banners during the onboarding screens in the Smoke Free app. The study will take place in the Smoke Free app. Description of Study Intervention: The study intervention is a video game in which users i) raise a pet dragon that develops in tandem with the quit attempt and ii) earn points for using game and non-game features within the app. Study Duration: Approximately 4 months from when the study opens for enrollment until completion of data collection Participant Duration: Approximately 9 weeks for each participant to complete all tasks

Based on the NIH Behavioral and Social Intervention Clinical Trial Protocol Template – [ADDRESS_323182] high drop-out rates. “Gamification” is a motivational tool designed to increase engagement in mHealth apps. It employs non-monetary rewards to transform non-game contexts into fun or a challenge. Yet, gamification has rarely been tested for smoking cessation apps, despi[INVESTIGATOR_265756]. In this study, we will test the effects of gamification in a mobile smoking cessation setting.   To do this, we will conduct a randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_265757] a popular smoking cessation app called Smoke Free with and without a video game module. Our goal will be to determine whether the game module increases engagement, retention, and smoking abstinence compared with an app with core features only. 3.[ADDRESS_323183] smoking cessation attempts are unaided and successful less than 5% of the time.[ADDRESS_323184] effective cessation treatment—counseling plus medication—is used by [CONTACT_143407] 5% of those attempting to quit.1, 3, 4 Racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in tobacco-related cancer incidence and mortality are persistent and well documented,5, [ADDRESS_323185] and convenience of smartphone-delivered support makes them an appealing alternative to clinical treatments for many smokers. The enormous reach of cessation apps has been aided by [CONTACT_265769]. As of 2018, 77% of US adults owned a smartphone, including three-quarters of black and Hispanic adults, two-thirds of adults in low-income households (<$30,000 per year), and 73% of adults age 50-64.[ADDRESS_323186] been tested rigorously—only 3 in RCTs,

Based on the NIH Behavioral and Social Intervention Clinical Trial Protocol Template – [ADDRESS_323187] found that smartphone cessation apps generate 1- to 2-month abstinence rates ranging from 21-29%.14-[ADDRESS_323188] efficacy rates for many real-world mHealth cessation interventions is low retention. In a study of >25,000 users of NCI’s SmokefreeTXT, among the largest text messaging cessation programs nationwide, 61% dropped out before the 6-week program ended, due in large part to failed quit attempts.22 Systematic data for smartphone cessation apps is lacking, although evidence suggests a similar pattern of low retention. Three-quarters of mHealth apps are opened <10 times.23 In one evaluation of a cessation app (N = 1,669), >70% used the app <[ADDRESS_323189] found program completion rates of 24% and 40%.16, 20 It is critically important to find effective ways to engage users in smartphone interventions, to increase program retention and efficacy.   Our study aims to identify approaches to motivate, engage, and retain smokers in cessation programs, which is critically important for curbing the burden of tobacco-related disease. Behavioral researchers agree that video games and gamification may be potent tools for health behavior change.24-26 Games are designed to increase users’ motivation and engagement, which in turn increases exposure and adherence to the tobacco cessation program (Figure 1).27 In our game design, users maintain a digital pet that evolves as the user’s quit attempt progresses. This provides a visual feedback mechanism that has “endogenous” value (tied closely to users’ motivation to quit) that may sustain and enhance motivation to quit. The game also may increase motivation through the limited social support and opportunities for social comparisons afforded by [CONTACT_265770]. The game also provides tools for the user to better cope with the challenges of withdrawal: a mini-game as a distraction and a breathing exercise to provide calm. Further, the user may identify with the digital pet as an avatar, and this may cultivate a digital therapeutic alliance with the game and app, e.g., by [CONTACT_40397] a bond with the dragon and increasing the user’s confidence to succeed.28, 29 All of these pathways—engagement, retention, program adherence, motivation, copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and digital therapeutic alliance—are hypothesized to combine to increase the user’s chance of quitting successfully.    Our primary outcomes relate to the relationship between our game design and user engagement in the program. A recent systematic review of 15 trials and >10,000 participants concluded that gamification promoted engagement in online programs, though only one of those trials focused on health.30 Other studies show that gamification can promote physical activity, diabetes self-management, and mental health, supporting the scientific premise of the proposed study; however, these have typi[INVESTIGATOR_265758]-randomized designs.31-33 Early-stage work has also shown that games and gamification in cessation apps are Engagement,retention,  program adherenceSmokingcessationMotivation, copi[INVESTIGATOR_007],therapeutic allianceGamedesignBehavioraltheory

The goal of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_265759] a video game increased engagement with the app, relative to a version of the app without the game. The primary outcome is the number of app opens per participant.  Our primary hypothesis is that the app with the game will increase a user’s engagement, as objectively measured by [CONTACT_265776]. Our secondary hypotheses are that the app with the game will increase retention, early efficacy, and program adherence (use of core app features).  During the study period, participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the core version of the Smoke Free app plus the game module or to the same core version of the Smoke Free app without the game module (a two-arm trial). Assessors of the follow-up cotinine test to assess smoking status will be blinded; other research personnel will not be. Individuals will be invited to participate in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_265760], with a link to a screening questionnaire and consent form in Qualtrics. We will recruit individuals age ≥ [ADDRESS_323203] until 8 weeks (56 days) after the person’s selected quit day.   Participants will be asked to complete a baseline questionnaire in Qualtrics after consenting to participate in the study and a follow-up questionnaire in Qualtrics at the end of the 56-day period. Those reporting being smoke-free in the follow-up questionnaire will be mailed a salivary cotinine test kit to upload photos of the test results that biochemically verify smoking status.  The main engagement analyses will be conducted on an intent-to-treat basis using all randomized participants.

Influence of a Game Embedded in a Smartphone App for Smoking Cessation on User Engagement Version 1.0  Protocol 19-[ZIP_CODE]   14 November 2021  
Based on the NIH Behavioral and Social Intervention Clinical Trial Protocol Template – 20190328  15 During this study, approximately one-half of study participants will receive a gamified version of the Smoke Free app. The control in this study is the "core” version of the Smoke Free app without any game component.  The core app is the lowest-cost and most popular paid version of Smoke Free. The core app includes a customizable dashboard that displays health gains and financial savings from quitting, a cravings log, a diary, a badge system, daily missions to support the quit attempt, and a Quit Coach chatbot. The missions were found to be part of a bundle of features that improve smoking abstinence at 3 months.37 The chatbot has been found to be effective at increasing user engagement.38   The game intervention involves Smoke Free users maintaining a digital pet dragon, an in-game avatar that evolves during the quit attempt. The user earns points by [CONTACT_265778]-app activities, including those in the game (e.g., playing a mini-game or feeding the dragon) and in the core Smoke Free app (e.g., reading tips or logging a diary). This design provides immediate feedback and a visual representation of a user’s progress in quitting.    The intervention design was informed by [CONTACT_265779]. For example, the use of frequent, salient in-game rewards is designed to counter the behavioral economic constructs of present bias and inattention to app use. The design further includes evidence-based practices from contingency management therapy, such as the use of escalating in-game rewards for abstinence with a reset point for lapses (to harness regret and loss aversion). The use of surprise gifts provides a variable reward structure designed to boost engagement and novelty.   The design was further informed by [CONTACT_265780].   7.1.2 ADMINISTRATION AND/OR DOSING  In this study, participants receive access to the intervention on the first day of the study if randomized to the intervention group. Participants will have access to the intervention for the full 56-[ADDRESS_323208] TRAINING AND TRACKING  N/A 7.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING  Participants will be digitally randomized in a 1:1 ratio to a core version of the Smoke Free app plus the game module or to a core version of the Smoke Free app. Allocation, concealed from investigators, will be performed using a random number generator with a random seed in the Smoke Free app platform.

Based on the NIH Behavioral and Social Intervention Clinical Trial Protocol Template – 20190328  16 Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (<50 years old and ≥50 years old) and by [CONTACT_265781] (<5 cigarettes per day and ≥5 cigarettes per day on average), to facilitate assessment of effect modification.  The randomization will occur immediately after participants provide consent to participate in the study. Participants will not be able to navigate past an onboarding screen until they complete the screening questionnaire and are found to be eligible and provide consent to participate. Once they have provided consent, they will be able to advance past the onboarding screen and will automatically be granted access to the app version for their assigned study group.   Assessors of the follow-up cotinine test to assess smoking status will be blinded; others will not be.  7.4 STUDY INTERVENTION/EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION ADHERENCE  N/A 7.5 CONCOMITANT THERAPY  During the pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], participants may also use alternative smoking cessation methods, including over-the-counter and prescribed medications. Use of alternative smoking cessations methods will be assessed in the follow-up questionnaire. 7.5.1 RESCUE THERAPY  N/A  8 STUDY INTERVENTION/EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION DISCONTINUATION AND PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL  8.1 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION/EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  When a subject discontinues using the Smoke Free app, but does not drop out of the study, remaining study procedures will be completed as indicated by [CONTACT_4690]. The participant is able to stop using the Smoke Free app at any time without taking any further action. 8.2 PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY  Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request. If a participant chooses to withdraw from the study, the participant can send an email to the study email address ([EMAIL_5112]). Instructions on withdrawal and a link to the study email account will also be provided in the help section of the Smoke Free app. If a participant withdraws, the study team will inform the Smoke Free app to stop collecting user data for study purposes. Smoke Free may continue to collect routine user data. Former participants will then be able to continue using the same version of the Smoke Free app that they received as part of the study.

Mild: events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities. 2. Moderate: events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning. 3. Severe: events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually incapacitating  [IP_ADDRESS] RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION/EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  To assess relationship of an event to study intervention, the following guidelines are used: 1. Related (Possible, Probable, Definite) a. The event is known to occur with the study intervention. b. There is a temporal relationship between the intervention and event onset. c. The event abates when the intervention is discontinued. d. The event reappears upon a re-challenge with the intervention. 2. Not Related (Unlikely, Not Related) a. There is no temporal relationship between the intervention and event onset. b. An alternate etiology has been established.  [IP_ADDRESS] EXPECTEDNESS   The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_118631]. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the intervention.   9.3.[ADDRESS_323212] all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is obtained until seven (for non-serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation. In the 2-month follow-up questionnaire, participants will be asked to report the occurrence of AE/SAEs since study enrollment in an open-ended format.  9.3.5 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING   In the unlikely event that an AE or SAE incident occurs during this study, any AE meeting the specified SAE criteria will be submitted within 10 workdays of the PI’s awareness in the UCSF electronic IRB system to the UCSF CHR. This process applies to both initial and follow-up SAE reports. 9.3.6 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING   See Section 8.3.5 above.

Based on the NIH Behavioral and Social Intervention Clinical Trial Protocol Template – [ADDRESS_323214]. Thus, our sample size is based on budget and feasible accrual during the study timeline.  With two parallel groups, the sample size calculation was conducted for one of our primary outcomes, a continuous measure of the number of times the Smoke Free app was opened through Day 56 of the study period.   We anticipate that a sample size of 500, with an assumed 70% retention, toward the high end for app-based smoking cessation trials,19, [ADDRESS_323215] a between-group difference in app opens, one of the primary outcomes, of 13.5 at 80% power (α=0.05).   10.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES  The main analyses (i.e., for primary endpoints), unless otherwise noted, will be performed on an intent-to-treat basis that include all randomized participants.   The main analysis of smoking abstinence will be performed on a complete-case basis, using all available outcome data in the modeling with treatment condition as randomized. Sensitivity analyses will be performed 1) on an intent-to-treat basis imputing missing as smoking and 2) using multiple imputation with chained equations to handle missing data. This analytic strategy is consistent with expert recommendations and statistical practice,40 because the assumption of missing = smoking may be biased in favor of the group with lower attrition.41-[ADDRESS_323216] for a range of potential confounders, including gender, age, race/ethnicity, baseline smoking intensity, and years smoked.

Based on the NIH Behavioral and Social Intervention Clinical Trial Protocol Template – 20190328  23 Our key hypothesis is that the gamified app improves engagement measured by [CONTACT_265782] 56 following the participant’s quit date. To test this, we will compare the mean number of app opens by [INVESTIGATOR_216], using an adjusted linear model with an indicator for treatment arm.  10.4.3 ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)  To measure retention, we will compare the proportion who complete the program by [CONTACT_265783].   To measure early efficacy, we will use adjusted logistic models to compare abstinence by [CONTACT_265784] 7- and 30-day point-prevalence. Analyses for smoking abstinence will be performed on a complete-case basis, using all available data in the modeling with treatment condition as randomized. Sensitivity analyses will be performed 1) on an intent-to-treat basis imputing missing as smoking and 2) using multiple imputation with chained equations to handle missing data.

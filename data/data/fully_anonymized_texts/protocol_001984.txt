Relapsed or Refractory Follicular Lymphoma (CITADEL-203)  
Protocol Number:   INCB [ZIP_CODE]-203 Study Phase:   2 
Indication:   Relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma  
 
Objectives  Endpoints  
Primary  
To assess the efficacy of INCB050465 in terms of  
objective response rate (ORR) in subjects with 
relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL).  ORR  defined as the percentage of subjects with a 
complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as 
defined by [CONTACT_147074], 
as determined by [CONTACT_147075] 
(IRC).  
Secondary  
To assess  complete response rate (CRR).  CRR  defined as the percentage of subjects with a CR 
as defined by [CONTACT_147076], as determined by [CONTACT_26708].  
To assess  the duration of response (DOR).  DOR  defined as the time from first documented 
evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death from any cause among subjects who achieve an 
objective response, as determined by [CONTACT_147077] . 
To assess  progression -free survival (PFS).  PFS defined as the time from the date of the first dose 
of study treatment  until the earliest date of disease 
progression, as determined by [CONTACT_147078], or death from any 
cause.  
To assess  overall survival (OS).  OS defined as the time from the date of the first dose 
of study treatment  until death from any cause.  
To assess  best percent age change in target lesion size.  Best percentage change in target lesion size from 
baseline, where target lesion size is measured by [CONTACT_147079].  
To characterize the safety and tolerability of 
INCB050465.  Safety measured by [CONTACT_147080], including 
vital signs and physical examinations, 12- lead 
electrocardiograms (ECG s), chemistry and 
hematology laboratory values, and adverse events 
(AEs).  

Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_168145] 50 subjects will be 
assigned  at 1:1 ratio to 2 treatment groups:   Group A and Group B.  Subjects in  treatment  Group A will 
receive INCB050465 20 mg once daily for 8 weeks followed by 20 mg once weekly; s ubjects in 
treatment Group B will receive INCB050465 [ADDRESS_168146] 50 subjects (Group A and Group B combined)  
have been evaluated for response or have permanently discontinued study treatment because of disease progression, withdrawal of consent, or death.  The study will be terminated for futility if ≤ [ADDRESS_168147] responded (ie, CR or PR) based on assessments provided by [CONTACT_26732]; otherwise the 
study will continue.  A timely assessment of response will be performed to av oid the risk of 
overenrollment.  
Study Population:   Subjects with histologically conf irmed diagnosis of FL (Grade 1, 2, or 3 a) who 
have received at least 2 prior systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Key Inclusion Criteria:   
• Aged 18 years or older.  
• Histologically confirmed, relapsed or refractory , follicular B -cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) 
(FL) Grade 1 , 2, and 3a. 
• Ineligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE] -203 Am 9  Version 9  23 DEC 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL  Estimated Duration of P articipation:   Subject participation from screening through follow -up is 
expected to  average approximately 25  months , which includes the following:  
• A screening period lasting up to 28 days.  
• A treatment period lasting as long as the subject is receiving benefit, tolerating the regimen, and has 
not met withd rawal criteria (approximately 52  weeks).  
• A safety follow-up period lasting 30 to 35 days.  
• A disease and survival follow-up period until the end of the study.  
At the end of the study, s ubjects who have completed at least 24 months of study participation (starting 
from first dose of INCB050465) , who remain on active study treatment, and who have no evidence of 
progressive disease will have the option to continue on monotherapy with INCB050465 provided within a rollover Protocol, as local law permits.  
Estimated  Number of Subjects:   Approximately [ADDRESS_168148] 50 subjects 
will be assigned at 1:1 to Group A (INCB050465 20 mg once daily for 8 weeks followed by 20 mg 
once weekly)  and Group B (INCB050465 20 mg once daily for 8 weeks followed by [CONTACT_147081]050465 
2.5 mg once daily) .  The remaining 70 subjects will be assigned to the selected treatment g roup (ie, 
either treatment Group A or treatment Group B ).

Statistical Methods:  
Descriptive summaries for continuous variables will include, but not be limited to, the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum.  Descriptive summaries for categorical variables will include the number and percentage of subjects in each category.  
Sample Size : 
Approximately 120  subjects wi ll be enrolled and assigned to either treatment Group A or Group  B.  If 
the true ORR is 51% for subjects in Group A and Group B, then with 120 total subjects, there is 
approximately 93% probability of observing the lower bound of the 95% confidence interva l (CI) of 
ORR ≥ 35%.  
Primary Analysis: 
The ORR as determined by [CONTACT_147082] 95% exact binomial CIs will be calculated.   The primary 
efficacy analyses will be conducted when all subjects in the full analysis set  who have achieved a 
response (ie, PR or CR) according to the IRC have had approximately 12 months of follow -up from the 
onset of response.  
Secondary Analyses:   The CRR as determined by [CONTACT_147083] 95% exact binomial CIs  will be calculated .  Kaplan -Meier 
estimation of median DOR (per IRC), PFS (per IRC), and OS  will be provided  with respective 
95% CIs.  Best percent age change from baseline in target lesions size will be summarized 
descriptively.   All safety data, including AEs, laboratory data, vital signs, and ECGs, wi ll be 
summarized descr iptively.

CONFIDENTIAL  Level of Significance:  
There will not be any statistical comparison between the two groups.  Two-sided 95% CIs will be 
reported for all analyses when appropriate.  
Interim Analysis:  
An interim futility analysis is planned when the first 50  subjects (Group A and Group B combined) 
have been evaluated for response or have permanently discontinued study treatment because of disease 
progression, withdrawal of consent, or death.  The study will be terminated for futility if ≤ [ADDRESS_168149] responded (ie, CR or PR) based on assessments provided by [CONTACT_26732]; otherwise the 
study will continue.  
Independent Data Monitoring Committee:   An independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) 
will be established and will review data at predetermined intervals as specified in the IDMC charter.

CONFIDENTIAL  1.2. Treatment for Follicular Lymphoma 
Some patients with early stage FL (Ann Harbor Stage I or II) who develop symptoms may be 
treated with radiation therapy alone .  Ad vanced stage (Ann Harbor Stage III-IV), G rade 1  to 3a 
FL is often treated according to the degree of tumor burden (low versus high) and the presence or 
absence of FL symptoms (eg, fever, night sweats, unexplained weight loss, etc).  Asymptomatic patients with a low tumor burden may be candidates for watchful wait ing, whereas those with a 
high tumor burden may receive R- chemo .  Symptomatic pati ents with a low tumor burden may 
receive either single-agent rituximab or R- chemo, whereas patients with a high tumor burden 
may receive R -chemo with or without maintenance rituximab.  Although the majority of patients 
will respond to these first- line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], the natural history of FL is char acterized by [CONTACT_147084]. 
There are several  options for patients  with FL  that relapse after initial treatment ( Kahl  and 
Yang  2016).  The use of single-agent bendamustine was approved by [CONTACT_40563] 2008 for 
use in patients with indolent B -cell NHL  that progressed within 6 months of treatment with 
rituximab (Treanda
® 2013).  In 2016, the US FDA and the European Commis sion approved the 
use of obinutuzumab in combination with bendamustine followed by [CONTACT_147085] 6 months of prior rituximab-based therapy  
(Sehn  et al 2016, Gazyva® 2016).  Stem cell transplant is another option available to some 
patients after relapse.    
The first -in-class PI3Kδ inhibitor idelalisib (Zydelig 2016) was granted accelerated approval  in 
2014 by [CONTACT_147086] a single-arm study enrolling FL subjects (N = 72) who were 
refractory to at least 2 prior therapie s (Gopal et al 2014).  The approved indication was for the 
treatment of patients with relapsed follicular B -cell NHL who had received at least 2 prior 
systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   Idelalisib was also approved in Europe, based on the same study, for adult 
patients with FL that is refractory to 2 prior lines of treatment.  In September of 2017, a pan PI3K inhibitor, copanlisib ( Aliqopa 2017), was also granted accelerated approval by [CONTACT_147087] a single-arm study enrolling FL subjects (N = 104) who had received at least 2 prior systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (Patnaik et al 2016 ).  The ORR for idelalisib in a double- refractory FL 
population was 54% ( Zydelig 2016 ); the ORR for copanlisib in patients with relapsed or 
refractory FL who  had received at least 2  prior t herapi[INVESTIGATOR_26615] 59% ( Aliqopa 2017).  Other  agents 
(eg, lenalidomide, venetoclax, ibrutinib) are being evaluated in clinical studies. 
1.3. INCB050465  
Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases belong to a family of lipid signaling kinases that phosphorylate phosphoinositides of the inositol ring ( Cantley  2002).  Phosphatidylinositol 3 kinases are divided 
into 3 classes (Class I, II, and III) according to their structure, regulation, and substrate 
specificity.  Class I PI3Ks, which include PI3Kα, PI3Kβ, PI3Kγ, and PI3Kδ, are dual -specificity 
lipid and protein kinases that catalyze the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-
bisphosphate, giving rise to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate.  Phosphatidylinositol-
3,4,5- trisphosphate functions as a second messenger that controls a number of cellular processes, 
including growth, survival, adhesion, and migration.  The recognition that aberrant signal 
transduction occurs in malignant B-lymphocytes via the PI3K pathways resulting in disease 
progression has led to a focus on agents that modulate these signaling pathways.

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE] -203 Am 9  Version 9  23 DEC 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL  INCB050465 is a potent inhibitor of PI3Kδ (IC 50 value = 1.1 ± 0.5 nM), with approximately 
20,000- fold selectivity for the other PI3K family members.  INC B050465 does not significantly 
inhibit (< 30% inhibition) a broad panel of kinases when tested at a concentration of 100 nM 
(refer to the INCB050465 IB ).  INCB050465 is potent (IC 50 values of ≤ 10 nM) in cell -based 
assays relevant to the pathogenesis of B- cell malignancies, such as PI3Kδ -mediated signaling 
and growth of human B-cell lines.  This effect is not due to general cytotoxicity.  Compared with inhibition of B-cell proliferation, INCB050465 is similarly potent in blocki ng helper T -cell 
differentiation but is > [ADDRESS_168155] of INCB050465 on the human immune system will lar gely be restricted to B -cell and helper T -cell 
differentiation (INCB050465 IB ).  The IC
90 for pAKT inhibition of Pfeiffer cells in human 
whole blood is 77nM ( INCB050465 IB ).  Preclinical toxicolog y studies supported evaluation of 
INCB050465 in human clinical studies ( INCB050465 IB ). 
INCB050465 is being evaluated as a monotherapy in a Phase 1/2, dose- escalation and expansion 
study (INCB [ZIP_CODE]-101, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], Phillips  et al 2016 ).  As of 01 MAR 2017, data were 
available for 63 subjects who received INCB050465 administered orally QD or QD for 9 weeks 
followed by [CONTACT_122967].  Starting in NOV 2016, subjects were switched to QW dosing if they had been 
on study treatment for > 9 weeks ( Ramchandren  et al 2017 ).  The median d uration of treatment 
for all subjects was 114 days (range 7-520).  Nonhematological adverse events observed in 
≥ 20% of subjects were nausea (3 8%), diarrhe a/colitis  (35%), fatigue (29%), vomiting (2 7%), 
cough (24%) , rash (22%) , and dizziness (21%).  New or worsening G rade ≥ 3 anemia, 
thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia occurred in 5%, 10%, and 22% of subjects, respectively.  No 
≥ Grade 3 non hematological treatment- related AEs were reported in ≥ 10% of subjects .  Serious 
AEs that occurred in ≥  2 subjects included diarrhea/ colitis  (n = 6) and hypotension (n = 3) and 
ventricular tachycardia, pyrexia, pneumonia, exfoliative dermatitis,  syncope, and bacteremia 
(n = 2 each) .  Twelve  (19%) of the 63 subjects discontinued study treatment due to the following 
AEs:  diarrhea (n  = 2), exfoliative dermatitis (n  = 2), colitis, cytomegalovirus colitis, 
pneumonitis, rash, psoriasis, neutropenia, pneumonia, and hypercalcemia (n  = 1 each).  All but 
[ADDRESS_168156] 
abnormalities > Grade 1 were reported while subjects were receiving study treatment.  No dose- limiting toxicities were identified, and the maximum tolerated dose was not reached.  
As of 01 MAR 2017, 28 objective responses as reported by [CONTACT_147088] 
57 evaluable subjects with DLBCL, FL, HL , marginal zone lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia, and mantle cell lymphoma .  These results include 8 objective responses among the 
11 evaluable subjects with FL; all but 1 of the objective responses occurred by [CONTACT_35667] 9-week disease assessment.  Among the 8 objective response s, 6 demonstrated >  75% reduction 
in their target lesions (see Figure 1).   The longest duration of study treatment among subjects 
with FL was  approximately 14 months, with 3 of the evaluable subjects ongoing.

1.4. Study Rationale  
The PI3Kδ inhibitor idelalisib was  approved for the treatment of patients in the [LOCATION_002] 
with relapsed follicular B -cell NHL  who have received at least 2 pr ior systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] .  In 
September of 2017 the PI3K inhibitor copanlisib was also approved in the Unites States for the same patient population ( Aliqopa 2017).  Idelalisib was approved in the European Union for the 
treatment of adult patients with FL that is  refractory to [ADDRESS_168158] .  
INCB050465 is a potent and sele ctive PI3Kδ inhibitor and has demonstrated rapid and deep 
objective responses in subjects with relapsed FL (see Section 1.3).   

Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_168159] disease assessment (9 weeks).   However , among all 
evaluable subjects with an objective response (n = 20), 7 subjects (35%) discontinued study 
treatment due to an AE.  Consequently, after receiving [ADDRESS_168160] inhibition, which may reduce the frequency of AEs leading to study treatment 
withdrawal.  Pharmacodynamic data from Study INCB [ZIP_CODE]-101 showed that a single dose of 20 mg exhibited maximal inhibition of AKT in an ex vivo  pharmacodynamic assay, and PK 
modeling suggests that 20 mg once weekly will 1) achieve maximal inhibition equivalent to approximately 10 × IC
90, 2) exceed the IC 90 for approximately 36 hours, and 3) have minimal to 
no inhibition for approximately half the dosing interval.  This once- weekly regimen is similar to 
that of another PI3K inhibitor (copanlisib), which is administered intravenously on Days  1, 8, 
and 15 of a 28-day cycle ( Aliqopa 2017).    
The continuous QD regimen of INCB050465 has demonstrated prolonged responses in both 
aggressive and indolen t NHL.  On e subject with FL who received a 10 mg QD dose achieved a 
complete metabolic response and remained on study treatment for approximately 13 months 
before withdrawing due to an AE (Grade 2 psoriasis).  The 2.5 mg QD regimen is proposed to 
provide approximately 86% inhibition of the PI3K pathway on average but could reduce the 
frequency of AEs that lead to study treatment withdrawal. 
1.5. Potential Risks and Benefits of the Treatment Regimen  
A summary of AEs , SAEs , and efficacy observed in the ongoing Study INCB [ZIP_CODE]-101 is 
provided (Section 1.3 ).  Similar to other PI3K inhibitors, diarrhea/c olitis, pneumonitis, 
infections , severe cutaneous reactions, and neutropenia were observed in Study 
INCB [ZIP_CODE]-101.  In Study INCB [ZIP_CODE]-101, [ADDRESS_168161] themselves from the sun/ultraviolet light.   This includes wearing

4. INVESTIGATIONAL  PLAN 
4.1. Overall Study Design 
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label study evaluating 2 INCB050465 treatment regimens  
based on the primary endpoint of ORR.  Subjects with relapsed or refractory FL (Grades 1, 2, or 
3a) who have received at least [ADDRESS_168168] 
50 subjects enrolled will be assigned at  a 1:1 ratio to treatment Group A (INCB050465 20 mg 
QD for 8  weeks  followed by 20 mg once weekly) and treatment Group B (INCB050465 20 mg 
QD for 8 weeks followed by [CONTACT_147081]050465 2.5 mg QD; see Figure 2).  The remaining [ADDRESS_168169] permanently discontinued study treatment because of disease progression, withdrawal of consent, or death.  The study will be terminated for futility if ≤ 18 of the 
50 subjects ha ve responded (ie, CR or PR) based on assessments provided by [CONTACT_26732]; otherwise 
the study will continue.  A timely assessment of response will be performed to avoid the risk of 
overenrollment.  
Subjects will be monitored for safety and efficacy periodicall y until disease progression, death, 
unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of informed consent.  An IDMC will review safety data 
periodically as stated in the IDMC charter.

Figure  2: Study Design 
 
4.2. Measures Taken to Avoid Bias 
This is an open -label study; no comparisons will be made between subjects or against historical 
controls.  Measurements of safety and efficacy are objective measurements, and only comparisons to pretreatment conditions will be made.  Safety will be objectively assessed using 
NCI CTCAE  v4.03 ( NCI 2009) guidelines; response will be assessed by [CONTACT_147092] ( Cheson et al 2014).  
4.3. Number of Subjects  
4.3.1. Planned Number of Subjects  
The study will enrol l approximately [ADDRESS_168171] will enter the 
survival follow-up period (see Section 6.4).  Subject participation  is expe cted to average 
approximately [ADDRESS_168172] discontinued from the study (see Section  5.7) or have completed  at least  24 months 
of study participation (starting from the first dose of study treatment).  It is estimated that the 
study will take approximately 1.[ADDRESS_168173] the option to continue on monotherapy with 
INCB050465 provided within a rollover Protocol, as local law permits (see Section  5.8). 
4.6. Study Termination  
The investigator retains the right to terminate study participation at any time, according to the 
terms specified in the study contract.  The i nvestigator is to notify the institutional review board  
(IRB)/independent ethics committee (IEC) in writing of the study' s completion or early 
termination, send a copy of the notification to the sponsor or sponsor' s designee, and retain 
1 copy for the site study regulatory file. 
The sponsor may terminate the study electively or do so if required by a regulatory agency or 
upon advice from the IDMC.  If the study is terminated prematurely, then the sponsor will notify 
the investigators, the IRBs and IECs, and regulatory bodies of the decision and reason for termination of the study.  The IDMC will recommend termination of the study if warranted, as 
described in the IDMC charter  (see also Section  9.5). 
Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_168174] numbers will be 6 digits; the first [ADDRESS_168175]'s number.  This subject number will be maintained throughout the study and 
will not be reassigned.  Subjects who withdraw consent or discontinue from the study after being assigned a subject number will retain their initial number.  
Site staff will contact [CONTACT_147093].   The investigator or designee will select the assigned bottles 
of study treatment from their stock that correspo nd to the number provided by [CONTACT_147094].  All subsequent dispensing of study treatment should 
follow this process.  Refer to the IWRS manual for detailed information.  
If a subject is mistakenly given a bottle of study treatment that is not the bottle assigned by [CONTACT_129212], the IWRS help desk must be notified immediately.  The reason for the misallocation of 
the study treatment  must be documented by [CONTACT_147095]/IEC.  
For subjects who signed an ICF but are not allocated study treatment  and for subjects who are 
allocated study treatment but were not treated, refer to the eCRF Completion Guidelines for instruction on which eCRFs to complete.

5.2.4. Instruction to Subjects for Handling INCB050465  
The subject must be instructed in the handling of INCB050465 as follows:  
• To store study treatment at room temperature.  
• To remove from the study treatment bottle only the number of tablets needed at the 
time of administration.  
• Not to remove doses in advance of the next scheduled administration. 
• To make every effort to take doses on schedule.  
• To report any missed doses.  
• To keep INCB050465 in a safe place and out of reach of children. 
• To bring all used and unused study treatment kits to the site at each visit.  
5.3. Treatment Compliance 
Compliance with all study -related treatments  should be emphasized to the subject by [CONTACT_89184], and appropriate steps should be taken to optimize compliance during the study.  
Compliance with study treatments will be calculated by [CONTACT_147096]/designee (table t 
counts).  Subjects will be instructed to bring all study  treatments with th em to the study visits for 
site personnel to conduct tablet counts to assess study treatment  accountability.  The drug 
accountability documentation will be used by [CONTACT_147097].

[IP_ADDRESS]. Supportive Care Guidelines for  Diarrhea/Colitis  
Subjects should be informed to immediately report to the investigator any event of diarrhea.  
Treatment with INCB050465 may be interrupted or modified according to the guidelines in 
Table  5 to allow for resolution of diarrhea/colitis . 
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1275].  For any Grade ≥  1 diarrhea, subjects should be advised to drink liberal quantities of 
clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion.  Subjects should try to eat 5 to 6 small meals per day; low- fat, 
high-protein foods; and cooked instead of raw vegetables.  Subjects may supplement their diet 
with bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast to reduce the number of bowel movements and may 
also try crackers, gelatin, noodles, or oatmeal.  Subjects should avoid fried, fatty, greasy, or spi[INVESTIGATOR_84716]; milk, milk products, and acidic drinks; high-fiber foods and foods that cause gas; and 
alcohol, caffeine, and herbal supplements ( Coutré et al 2015 ). 
For each occurrence, attempts should be made to rule out other causes, such as metastatic disease 
or bacterial or viral infection (including CMV) , which might require additional supportive care. 
It may be necessar y to perform conditional procedures such as colonoscopy with biopsy as part 
of evaluation of the event.  Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased.  
Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as diarrhea, abdominal pain or crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).

ADVERSE EVENT  ACTION TAKEN  
• Diarrhea (Grade 1).  Step 1:   Treat with antimotility agents (eg, 4 mg loperamide followed by 2  mg 
every 4 hours or after every unformed stool) and initiate supportive care (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).  Monitor approximately every 48 hours until resolved.  If not 
improved after 48  hours, treat per guidance for Grade 2.  
• Diarrhea (Grade 2).  Step 1:   Interrupt INCB050465.  Perform work -up for infection (including CMV, 
C. difficile , etc)  immediately .  Initiate or continue supportive care (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).  Monitor approximately every 48 hours until resolution. 
Step 2:   If improved within 48 hours and/or infection * is confirmed , restart 
INCB050465 at the same schedule and dose  after resolved to ≤  Grade 1 and 
continue to monitor.  
*For infectious diarrhea/ colitis , follow institutional standard -of-care guidelines 
and restart INCB050465 according to clinical judgement after resolved to ≤ Grade  1.  Consult with medical monitor if needed.  
Step 3:   If not improved within 48 hours and infection is ruled out, start oral 
steroids, or consider IV steroids if participant  is being given IV fluids.  If no 
improvement with oral steroids, switch to IV steroids.  
Step 4:   When diarrhea resolves to ≤ Grade 1, continue supportive care and taper 
steroids according to institutional standard of care .  When taper is complete (eg, 
no steroid or ≤  10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) and diarrhea is ≤ Grade 1, 
restart INCB050465 at the next lower dose with approval of the medical monitor  
(see Table  4 for dose levels).  
Step 5:   If Grade 2 diarrhea reoccurs, treat per guidance for diarrhea 
(≥ Grade  3)/noninfectious colitis . 
Step 6:   If ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_168178] time, permanently discontinue 
INCB050465.  
• Diarrhea (≥ Grade 3). 
• Noninfectious colitis (any 
grade; confirmed or suspected) . Step 1:   Interrupt INCB050465.  Perform work -up for infection (including CMV, 
C. difficile , etc)  immediately.  Initiate or continue supportive care (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).  Consider colonoscopy with biopsy for diarrhea ≥ Grade 3 and/or 
if symptoms
a suggestive of colitis .  Monitor every 48  hours until resolution.  
Step 2:   If infection* is ruled out, start oral steroids, or consider IV steroids if 
participant  is being given IV fluids.  If no improvement with oral steroids  within 
48 hours, switch to IV steroids . 
*For infectious diarrhea/colitis, follow institutional standard of care guidelines and restar t parsaclisib according to clinical judge ment after resolved to ≤  Grade  1.  
Consult with medical monitor if needed . 
Step 3:   When diarrhea/colitis  resolves to ≤ Grade 1, continue supportive care and 
taper steroids according to institutional standard of car e.  When taper is complete 
(eg, no steroid or ≤  10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) and diarrhea/colitis  is

CONFIDENTIAL  [IP_ADDRESS]. Supportive Care Guidelines for Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia  
Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia appear to be PI3Kδ class -effect toxicities.  Investigators 
should ensure that subjects understand the need to seek medical care when they have conditions 
that could become life-threatening in the presence of cytopenias (eg,  neutropenic fever  or 
bleeding with low platelets).  Subjects should be instructed to report immediately any signs of 
infection, unexpected bleeding, or sudden, extremely painful headaches. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definition for Immune -Related Adverse Events 
Adverse events of a p otential immunologic etiology, or irAEs , may be defined as an AE 
consistent with an immune phenomenon associated with study treatment exposure after all other 
etiologies have been eliminated.  Immune-related AEs may be expected based on previous 
experience with INCB050465 and other PI3K inhibitors .  Special attention should be paid to AEs 
that may be suggestive of potential irAEs.  Based on emerging data from the ongoing Study 
INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 101, most irAEs occur after the first [ADDRESS_168179] ed supportive care measures for the management of drug -related 
AEs with potential immunologic etiology are outlined in Table  3  and Section [IP_ADDRESS].  For each 
AE, attempts should be made to rule out other causes, including but not limited to metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which m ight require specific supportive care.  
5.5. Study Treatment Discontinuation  
The decision to discontinue study treatment will not constitute study completion.  In the event that study treatment is discontinued, the treatment period will be considered complete, and the 
follow-up periods will begin.  
5.5.1. Criteria for Study Treatment Discontinuation  
Subjects must  permanently discontinue study treatment for any 1 of the following: 
• The subject has experienced an unacceptable toxicity  defined as follows:  
− Occurrence of an AE that is related to study treatment  that, in the judgment of the 
investigator or the sponsor' s medical monitor, compromises the subject 's ability to 
continue study- specific pr ocedures or is considered to not be in the subject' s best 
interest. 
− Persistent AE requiring a delay of therapy for more than 2 weeks (14 days) unless 
a greater delay has been approved by [CONTACT_456].  
• The subject is unable to tolerate study treatment. 
• The subject has an objective radiographic tumor response of PD/PMD . 
• Further participation would be injurious to the subject' s health or well -being, in the 
investigator' s medical judgment.  
• The subject becomes pregnant. 
Incyte Corporation  Page 35 of 97 
Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE] -203 Am 9  Version 9  23 DEC 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL  • Informed consent is withdrawn.  Note:  Consent withdrawn means that the subject can 
no longer be followed.  Subjects may choose to discontinue study treatment and 
remain in the study to be followed for disease progression and survival  per the 
schedule of assessments. 
• The study is terminated by [CONTACT_456]. 
• The study is terminated by [CONTACT_19407], IRB, or IEC. 
A subject  may be discontinued from study treatment in  the foll owing situations:  
• If a subject is noncompliant with study procedures or study treatment  administration 
in the investigator 's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], then the sponsor should be consulted for instruction on 
handling the subject.  
5.5.2. Procedures for Study Treatment Discontinuation 
If a subject discontinues study treatment, then the following should occur:  
• The reason(s)  for discontinuation must be documented in the subject' s medical record 
and in the eCRF.  
• The EOT visit should be performed. 
• If the EOT visit coincides with a regular study visit, then the EOT evaluations will 
supersede those of that scheduled visit, and the data will  be entered in the EOT visit 
in the e CRF . 
• The date of the EOT visit should be recorded in the IWRS.  
• Subjects must be followed for safety for no less than 30 days after the EOT visit or until study treatment–related toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed 
irreversible, whichever is longest.  
If a subject discontinues study treatment and actively withdraws consent for collection of all 
follow-up data, then no additional data will be collected.  However, subjects may withdraw 
consent for study treatment, but continue to be assessed for disease progression and  survival per 
the schedule of assessments.  
5.6. Concomitant Medications  
All concomitant medications and treatments must be recorded in the eCRF.   Any prior 
medication received up to 30 days before the date of study treatment administration  (Day 1) will 
be recorded in the eCRF.   Concomitant treatments and/or procedures that are required to manage 
a subject 's medical condition during the study will also be recorded in the eCRF. 
5.6.1. Pneumocystis Jirovecii  Prophylaxis  
All subjects are required to receive a standard PJP prophylaxis regimen determined by [CONTACT_1275].   Examples of standard PJP prophylaxis therapi[INVESTIGATOR_147062] -sulfamethoxazole, atovaquone, dapsone with or without pyrimethamine, and 
pentamidine ( NCCN 2016).   Due to reports of cross-sensitivity between sulfonamides and 
dapsone, all subjects who have a known or suspected allergy to sulfonamides must receive either 
Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_168180] access to these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  The contents of 
the label will be in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements.   Further details are 
available in the Pharmacy Manual.  
5.6.2. Restricted Medications 
• Use of systemic corticosteroid doses ≤ 10 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent) is 
permitted but discouraged from the screening visit through EOT . 
• Short courses of systemic corticosteroid doses > 10 mg/day prednisolone or 
equivalent are permitted only in the c ase of severe or life -threatening complications 
that cannot be controlled with other drugs, but are otherwise discouraged  from the 
screening visit through EOT .  
• Use of weak or moderate inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( see Appendix B  and 
consult your local pharmacist) is discouraged, and investigators should seek other 
options where possible. 
• For subjects receiving INC050465, P- glycoprotein substrates of clinical relevance 
should be used with caution ( ie, aliskiren, ambrisentan, colchicine, dabigatran 
etexilate, digoxin, everolimus, fexofenadine, imatinib, lapatinib, maraviroc, nilotinib, posaconazole, ranolazine, saxagliptin, sirolimus, sitagliptin, ta linolol, tolvaptan, 
topotecan). 
• Localized radi otherapy will be  permitted if administered as treatment for pain or 
impending compression fractures and with prior approval of the medical monitor. 
5.6.3. Prohibited Medications  and Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
• Use of potent inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A4 are prohibited ( see Appendix B  and 
consult your local pharmacist).  Based on the low overall bioavailability of topi[INVESTIGATOR_147063], there are no restrictions on topi[INVESTIGATOR_147063].  
• Apart from the study treatments, the use of any anticancer medications as described (see Section 3.2) through the 30-day follow- up is prohibited.  
• Exposure to a live vaccine within [ADDRESS_168181] will be discontinued from the study for any 1 of the following reasons: 
• The subject has died. 
• The subject is considered lost -to-follow -up when he/she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_9298] (eg, after 3 telephone 
calls and/or a certified letter or local equivalent).  
• Informed consent is withdrawn. 
• The study is terminated by [CONTACT_456]. 
• The study is terminated by [CONTACT_19407], IRB or IEC.  
5.8. Treatment After the End of the Study  
At the end of the study as defined in Section  6.5, subjects who have completed at least 24 months 
of study participation (starting from the first dose of study treatment), who remain on active 
study treatment, and who have no evidence of progressive disease will have the option to

6.1. Screening  
Screening is the interval between signing the ICF and the date of study treatment administration  
(Day 1).  Screening may not exceed [ADDRESS_168187]' s routine clinical management (eg, imaging study) 
and obtained before signing of informed consent may be used for screening or baseline purposes, provided that the procedure meets the Pr otocol- defined criteria and has been performed in the 
screening interval.  All information associated with eligibility requirements  must be entered into 
the appropriate e CRF pages.  
Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_168188] who fails screening may repeat the screening process 1 time  if the 
investigator believes there  has been a change in eligibility status (eg, after recovery from an 
infection).  Such subjects will be assigned a new subject ID number. 
6.2. Treatment  
The tr eatment period begins on the date of study treatment administration  (Day 1).  This day 
must be no more than [ADDRESS_168189] has signed the ICF.  Dates for subsequent study 
visits will be determined based on this day and should occur within the visit windows outlined in 
the schedule of assessments (see Table  6 and Table  7) unless delayed for safety reasons.  
Subjects may receive treatment until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or consent 
withdrawal.  
6.3. End of Treatment  
There is no predefined EOT .  If a subject permanently discontinues study treatment, then the 
EOT visit should be conducted.  The subject should be encouraged to return for the safety 
follow-up visit. 
6.4. Follow -Up 
6.4.1. Safety Follow- Up 
The safety follow-up period is the interval between the EOT visit and the scheduled follow-up visit, which should occur 30 to 35 days after the EOT visit (or after the last dose of study drug if the EOT visit was not performed).  Adverse events and SAEs must be reported up until at least 
[ADDRESS_168190] before  conducting any 
study-specific procedures using an ICF approved by [CONTACT_1036]/IEC that contains all elements 
required by [CONTACT_12212] E6, and describes the nature, scope, and pos sible consequences of the study  in a 
form understandable to the study subject.  Local and institutional guidelines for ICF content and administration must be followed; the original signed ICF must be retained by [CONTACT_093], 
and a copy of the signed ICF must be provided to the study subject.  The informed consent 
process for each subject must be documented in writing within the subject source documentation. 
7.2. Interactive Response Technology Procedure  
The IW RS will be contact[CONTACT_147101] a subject ID number when a subje ct enters screening.  
Upon determining that the subject is eligible for enrollment, the IWRS  will be contact[CONTACT_147102].   Additionally, the IWRS  will be contact[CONTACT_147103] (s ee Section 5.1.1 an d Table  6). 
7.3. Demography and Medical History  
7.3.1. Demographics and Medical History  
Demographic data and a complete medical and medication history, including date of diagnosis of 
FL, histology, current staging, grade, sites of disease, prior surgery, radiation, and other details 
related to the disease under study will be collected . 
7.4. Prior and Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
Prior and concomitant medications and procedures will be reviewed to determine subject eligibility.  All concomitant medications and measures must be recorded in  the e CRF , and any 
medication received  or procedure performed within [ADDRESS_168191] will be maintained  after signing 
the ICF  to document concomitant medications, including any changes to the dose or regimen.  
Concomitant medications include any prescription, over- the-counter, or natural/herbal 
preparations taken or administered during the study period.  Concomitant treatments  and/or 
procedures that are required to  manage a subject 's medical condition during the study will also be 
recorded in the e CRF.

CONFIDENTIAL  For consideration of prior lines of therapy, a treatment is considered a new line of therapy if any 
of the following 3 conditions are met: 
• Start of a new line of trea tment after discontinuation of a previous line:  If a treatment 
regimen is discontinued for any reason and a different regimen is started, it should be considered a new line of therapy.  A regimen is considered to have been discontinued 
if all the drugs in  that given regimen have been stopped.  A regimen is not considered 
to have been discontinued if some of the drugs of the regimen, but not all, have been 
discontinued. 
• The unplanned addition or substitution of 1 or more drugs in an existing regimen: Unplanned addition of a new drug or switching to a different drug (or combination of drugs) due to any reason is considered a new line of therapy. 
• Stem cell transplant :  In subjects undergoing > [ADDRESS_168192] (autologous or 
allogeneic) should be considered a n ew line of therapy regardless of whether the 
conditioning regimen used is the same or different.  
Note :  A therapy administered before  an SCT, the subsequent SCT, and planned 
maintenance therapy after the SCT is considered [ADDRESS_168193]  signs the ICF .  Subjects will be 
instructed to report all AEs during the study and will be assessed for the occurrence of AEs throughout the study (see Section  8.1.2 and Section  8.3.2).  In order to av oid bias in eliciting 
AEs, subjects will be asked general, nonleading questions such as "How are you feeling?"  All 
AEs (serious and nonserious) must be recorded on the source documents and e CRFs  regardless 
of the assumption of a causal relationship with t he study drug.  The definition, reporting, and 
recording requirements for AEs are described in  Section  8. 
7.5.2. Comprehensive Physical Examinations  
Clinically notable abnormalities that are considered clinically significant in the judgment of the investigator are to be reported as AEs.  
Physical examin ations must be performed by a medically qualified individual such as a licensed 
physician, physician' s assistant, or an advanced registered nurse practitioner, as local law 
permits.  
The comprehensive physical examination will include height (at screening o nly) and the 
following organ or body system assessments:  skin; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; thyroid; lungs; cardiovascular system; abdomen (liver, spleen); extremities; lymph nodes; a brief 
neurological examination ( eg, reflexes, strength, Romberg' s test, vibration sense, and gross 
sensory perception); and body weight (within 1 lb or 0.5 kg).

CONFIDENTIAL  [IP_ADDRESS]. Disease- Specific  Physical  Examination  
A disease- specific physical examination will be a symptom -directed evaluation and will include 
assessment(s) of the body systems or organs, as indicated by [CONTACT_147104], AEs, 
or other findings as determined by [CONTACT_1719].  A disease -specific physical 
examination must include a measurement of the subject 's body weight (within 1 lb or 0.5 kg) and 
an evaluation of any AEs or symptoms that the subject has previously reported. 
7.5.3. Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements include blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body temperature.  
Blood pressure and pulse will be taken with the subject in the re cumbent, semirecumbent , or 
sitting position after [ADDRESS_168194].  Baseline ECGs will be obtained during screening using a single 
measurement but can be performed in triplicate if the single QTc measurement is 
> 450 milliseconds (corrected by [CONTACT_6550]; see Section 3.2 ).  Electrocardiograms will also be 
obtained during the Day 1 visit (triplicate me asurements) before the subject receives the first 
dose of study drug.  Triplicate ECGs will be performed predose and 1.5 hours (± 15 minutes) 
after receiving study treatment at the  Week 4 visit.  When triplicate ECGs are being obtained, 
individual measurements should be performed 5 minutes (± 3 minutes) apart.  All 12- lead ECGs 
obtained at subsequent timepoints (single measurements) will be compared with the baseline 12-lead ECGs as follows:  
• For ECG morphology, all postdose ECG recordings will be compared with Day 1 
predose ECGs.  
• For the calculation of changes in cardiac intervals (eg, QT interval), the intervals 
from the screening and Day 1 predose (triplicate) ECGs will be computed and 
averaged and used as the baseline for comparison of all postdose interv als. 
If a single measurement demonstrates a QTc interval > [ADDRESS_168195] be followed for the recording and transmission of ECGs and the operator' s manual with 
instructions for operating the digital capture module will be shipped to the site along with the device.  The 12- lead ECGs will b e interpreted by [CONTACT_147105].  The decision to include or exclude a subject or discontinue a 
subject's participation in the study based on an ECG flagged as "Abnormal, Clinically

CONFIDENTIAL  Significan t" is the responsibility of the investigator, in consultation with the sponsor' s medical 
monitor, as appropriate.  Twelve -lead ECGs that are identified by [CONTACT_1694] "Abnormal, 
Clinically Significant " will be sent to the sponsor' s medical monitor for review.  
The overall ECG interpretation will be indicated by a flagging system that will help distinguish 
between a normal ECG, ECG abnormalities where no further investigation is required, and ECG 
abnormalities where study exclusion, further cardiovascular investigation, and/or prompt action 
may be necessary depending on the clinical context.  A suitable flag will be included in the "Overall ECG Interpretation " section of the report when an ECG is considered to be technically 
unacceptable or uninterpre table.  If several different abnormalities exist corresponding to 
different levels of flagging, then the label will reflect the most severe level.  Flagging by [CONTACT_147106] a 
suggestion.  This service is intended to assist the investigator in his/her interpretation of the ECG 
and decision- making.  It is not intended to replace the investigator's expert judgment and 
knowledge of the subject's medical condition. 
7.5.5. Eastern Cooperati ve Oncology Group  Performance Status 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ( Oken  et al 1982; see Appendix C ) will 
be assessed .  Performance status must be assessed by a medically  qualified individual and 
recorded in the eCRF . 
7.5.6. Laboratory Assessments  
Blood draws for laboratory assessments will occur at study visits indicated (see Table  7).  
Specific laboratory assessments are provided ( see Table  8). 
All laboratory assessments, including those conducted during unscheduled visits, will be 
performed at a central laboratory  unless otherwise specified .   
Note:  A local laboratory assessment  (including reference ranges) will be entered into the eCRF 
only if there is no accompanying central laboratory assessment and the local laboratory assessment caused a change in patient management (eg, a dose interruption or reduction) or was 
an AE or SAE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Chemistry  and Hematology 
All chemistry and hem atology assessments (see Table  7 and Table  8) will be performed from 
blood samples collected using institutional best practices.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Testing  
A serum pregnancy test will be required for all women  of childbearing potential (see Section 3.1 ) 
as shown ( see Table  7).  At screening, the serum pregnancy test may be performed centrally or 
locally.  Urine pr egnancy tests will be conducted  as shown ( see Table  7).  If a urine pregnancy 
test is positive, the results should be confirmed with a serum pregnancy test. 
If the serum pregnancy test is negative after a positive urine test , the investigator wi ll assess the 
potential benefit/risk to the subject and  determine whether it is in the subject 's best interest to 
resume study treatment and continue participation in the study.

CONFIDENTIAL  8. SAFETY MONITORING AN D REPORTING 
8.1. Adverse Events 
8.1.1. Definitions  
For the purposes of this Protocol, an adverse event (AE) i s defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related, 
that occurs after a subject provides informed consent.  Abnormal laboratory values or test results 
occurring after informed consent constitute AEs only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, 
are considered clinically meaningful, require therapy (eg, hematologic abnormality that requires transfusion), or require changes in the study drug s. 
8.1.2. Reporting  
Adverse events that begin or worsen after informed consent should be recorded on the Adverse Events form of the e CRF.  Conditions that were already present at the time of informed consent 
should be recorded on the Medical History form in  the e CRF.  Monitoring for the occurrence of 
new AEs should be continued for at least [ADDRESS_168196] dose of study drugs.  Adverse 
events (including laboratory  abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described using a 
diagnosis whenever possible rather than  by [CONTACT_147108].  When a 
clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a separate AE . 
The term " disease progression " should be recorded as an AE/SAE only if there are no other 
identifiable AEs /SAEs  associated with the disease progression at the time of reporting.   For 
events associated with disease progression , the relevant signs and symptoms should be reported 
using a diagnosis whenever possible rather than individual underlying signs and symptoms.  When a clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a 
separate AE.  If the events resulting from disease progression me et the criteria for an SAE 
(eg, resulted in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a life -threatening event, or death), the specific event(s) should be 
reported as an  SAE(s)  as described in Section 8.3.2.  In both cases (ie, AEs or SAEs related to 
disease progression), it should be indicated that each event  (reported as a diagnosis or as signs 
and symptoms) is  related to disease progression  on the Adverse Events form of the eCRF. 
The severity of A Es will be assessed using CTCAE v 4.03 ( NCI 2009) Grades 1 through 5.  If an 
event is not classified by [CONTACT_3989], the severity  of the AE will be graded according to the scale 
below to estimate the grade of severity: 
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate activities of daily living.  
Grade 3  Severe or medical ly significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_147064] d; disabling; limiting 
self-care activities of daily living . 
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade [ADDRESS_168197], or other assessments.  To the 
extent possible, each AE  should be evaluated to determine:  
• The s everity gr ade (CTCAE Grade 1 to  5). 
• Whether there is at least a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study treatment:  suspected (yes) or not suspected (no). 
• The s tart and end dates, unless unresolved at final follow-up. 
• The a ction taken with regard to study drug. 
• The event outcome (eg, not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved, 
recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved with sequelae, fatal, unknown). 
• The s erious ness, as per serious adverse event (SAE ) definition provided in 
Section  8.3.1. 
Unlike routine safety assessments, SAEs are monitored continuously and have special reporting 
requirements ( see Section 8.3.2). 
All AEs  should be treated appropriately.  If an AE is treated with a concomitant medication or 
nondrug therapy, this action should be recorded on A dverse Event form and the treatment should 
be specified on  the Prior/ Concomitant M edications or Procedures and Non-Drug Therapy form 
in the e CRF . 
Once an AE  is detected, it should be followed until it ha s resolved  or until it is judged to be 
permanent; assessment shoul d be made at each visit (or more frequently  if necessary) of any 
changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to 
treat the event , and the outcome. 
When the severity  of an AE  changes over time for a reporting  period (eg, between visits), each 
change in severity  will be reported as a  separate AE until the event resolves.  For example, 
[ADDRESS_168198] Abnormalities 
Laboratory abnormalities that constitute an AE in their own right (considered clinically 
meaningful, induce clinical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therapy, or require changes 
in study drug) should be recorded on the Adverse Event form in  the e CRF.  Whenever possible, a 
diagnosis rather than a symptom should be provided (eg, " anemia " instead of "low hemoglobin").  
Laboratory abnormalities that meet the criteria for AEs  should be followed until they have 
returned to normal or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found.  When an abnormal laboratory  test result corresponds to a sign or symptom of a previously reported AE , it is not 
necessary to separately record the lab oratory  test result as an additional event.  
Laboratory abnormalities  that do not meet the definition of an AE  should not be reported as AEs .  
A Grade 3 or 4 AE  does not automatically indicate an SAE unless it meets the definition of 
serious, as defined in Section 8.3.1.  A dose modification  for the laboratory  abnormality may be 
required (see Section  5.4.1) and should not contribute to the designation of a laboratory test 
abnormality as a n SAE . 
8.3. Serious Adverse Events  
8.3.1. Definitions  
An SAE is defined as an event that meets at least 1 of the following criteria : 
• Is fatal or life -threatening . 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], unless 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138] a result of: 
− A routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication not associated with 
any deterioration in condition. 
− An elective surgery or preplanned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is 
unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the ICF. 
− A treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of a SAE and not resulting in  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. 
− Any social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594], in the absence of any deterioration in the subject' s general condition. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability , incapacity , or a substantial disruption of 
a person 's ability to conduct normal life functions . 
• Constitutes a congenital anomaly  or birth defect . 
• Is considered to be an important medical event or a medically significant event that 
may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_147065], based on appropriate medical judgment, the event 
may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above . 
Incyte Corporation  Page 55 of 97 
Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE] -203 Am 9  Version 9  23 DEC 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL  8.3.2. Reportin g 
Every SAE, regardless of suspected causality (eg, relationship to study drugs or study procedure 
or disease progression), occurring after the subject has signed the ICF through the last study visit 
(or [ADDRESS_168199] dose of study drug, whichever is later) must be reported to the sponsor 
(or designee) within [ADDRESS_168200] a reasonable possibility that the SAE is related to the study treatment:  suspected 
(yes) or not suspected (no).  Refer to the Incyte Reference Guide for Completing  the Serious 
Adverse Event Report Form. 
The contact [CONTACT_89208]' s study- specific representatives is listed in the 
investigator manual provided to each site.  The original copy of the SAE Report Form and the 
confirmation sheet must be kept at the study site. Investigational site personnel must report any new information regarding the SAE within 
24 hours of becoming aware of the information in the same manner that the initial SAE Report 
Form was sent.  Follow-up information is recorded on an amended or new SAE Report Form, with an indication that it is follow -up to the previously reported SAE and the date of the original 
report.  The follow-up report should include information that was not provided on the previous SAE Report Form, such as the outcome of the event (eg, resolved or ongoing), treatment provided, action taken with study drug because of the SAE (eg, dose reduced, interrupted, or 
discontinued), or subject disposition (eg, continued or withdrew from study participation).  Each 
recurrence, complication, or progression of the original event should be reported as follow-up to that event, regardless of when it occurs.  
If the SAE is not documented in the RSI section of IB for the study drug (new occurrence) and is 
thought to be related to the sponsor' s study drug, the sponsor or its designee may urgently requir e 
further information from the i nvestigator for reporting  to health authorities.  The sponsor or its 
designee may need to issue an  Investigator Notification (IN) to inform all investigators involved 
in any study with the same drug that this SAE has been reported.  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and 
relevant ethics committees in accordance with Di rective 2001/20/EC, or as per national 
regulatory requirements in participating countries.

8.6. Pregnanc y 
Pregnancy, in and of itself, is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_147066] a contraceptive medication or method.  When a 
pregnancy has been confirmed in a subject during maternal or paternal exposure to study drug, 
the following procedures should be follow ed in order to ensure subject safety : 
• The study drug must be discontinued immediately  (female subjects only ; see 
Section  5.4.1 for the maximum permitted dura tion of study drug interruption ). 
• The i nvestigator must complete and submit the Incyte Clinical Trial P regnancy  form 
to the sponsor or its designee within 24 hours  of learning of the pregnancy. 
Data on fetal outcome and breastfeeding are collected for regulatory reporting and drug safety evaluation.  Follow-up should be conducted for each pregnancy to determine outcome, including 
spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any 
birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications, by [CONTACT_147109] -baby [CONTACT_765].  Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Trial Preg nancy f orm 
and reported by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator to the sponsor or its designee.  Pregnancy follow-up information 
should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible causal relationship to the sponsor' s study drug to  any pregnancy outcome , as well as follow -up to the 
first well-baby [CONTACT_89212] , whichever is later .  Refer to the 
Incyte Reference Guide for Completing the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form. 
Any SAE occurring  during pregnancy must be re corded  on the SAE r eport f orm and

• Geographic region:  Europe, North America, Rest of W orld 
Subgroups may be further divided or combined based on emerging data.  The ORR and its 
95% CIs  will be provided for each subgroup.  A forest plot will be created to summarize the 
variability in ORRs across subgroups. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
Complete response rate is the percentage of subjects with a CR as defined by [CONTACT_147112], as determined by [CONTACT_26708].  The CRR determined by [CONTACT_147082] 
95% exact binomial CIs will be calculated.  
Duration of response is defined as the time from first documented evidence o f CR or PR until 
disease progression or death due to any cause among subjects who achieve an overall response, as determined by [CONTACT_55543].  For subjects who have not progressed and are still alive at the time of the analysis, DOR will be censored on the day of l ast evaluable disease assessment.  For subjects 
who have discontinued study or have started other anticancer treatment, DOR will be censored on the day of last evaluable disease assessment documenting absence of PD before the discontinuation or the start of the new anticancer treatment.  Kaplan -Meier estimation of median 
DOR per IRC and its 95% CIs  will be provided.  
Progression- free survival is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study drug to the 
first documented disease progression as determined by [CONTACT_55543], or death due to any cause, 
whichever occurs first.  For subjects who have not progressed and are still alive at the time of the analysis, PFS will be censored on the day of last evaluable disease assessment.  For subjects who have discontinued study or have started other anticancer treatment, PFS will be censored on the 
day of last evaluable disease assessment documenting absence of PD before the discontinuation 
or the start of the new anticancer treatment.  For subjects who have no basel ine or no 
postbaseline disease assessment, PFS will be censored with censored duration of 1 day.  
Kaplan -Meier estimation of median PFS per IRC  and its 95% CIs will be provided. 
Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study drug to death due 
to any cause.  For subjects who are still alive at the time of the analysis, OS will be c ensored on 
the date the subject  is last known to be alive.  The Kaplan- Meier estimation of median OS and its 
95% CIs will be provided.  
For subjects with measurable lesions at baseline, target lesion sizes will be measured by [CONTACT_147113].  The best percentage change from baseline, 
defined as the largest decrease in target lesion sizes during the study, will be summarized 
descriptively .  Note that for subjects who only have increases in target lesion sizes from baseline, 
the smallest increase will be considered as the best change from baseline.  Target lesions 
considered " too small to measure" will be assigned a default value of 5 mm × 5  mm for purposes

CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 4 ([ADDRESS_168213] 2017) 
Overall Rationale for the Amendment:  
The primary purpose of this amendment is to remove the comparator arm (idelalisib) from the 
study. 
This amendment includes the changes to Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]-203 Amendment 3 
(11 SEP 2017) summarized below.  A redline version of the amendment depi[INVESTIGATOR_147073]. 
1. Title; Synopsis; Section 1, Introduction; Section 2, Study Objectives and Endpoints; 
Section 3.2, Subject Ex clusion Criteria; Section 4.1, Overall Study Design; 
Section  4.2, Measures Taken to Avoid Bias; Section 4.3.1, Planned Number of 
Subjects; Section 4.5, Overall Study Duration; Section 5.1.2, Randomization and Blinding; Section 5.2, Study Treatments; Sectio n 5.4, Treatment Interruptions and 
Adjustments; Section 5.6, Concomitant Medications; Section 6, Study Assessments (Table 6, Schedule of Assessments; Table 7, Schedule of Laboratory Assessments); Section 6.1, Screening; Section 6.2, Treatment; Section 7.2, Interactive Response 
Technology Procedure; 7.4, Prior and Concomitant Medications and Procedures; 
[IP_ADDRESS], Chemistry and Hematology; Section  7.6, Efficacy Assessments; Section 7.7.1, 
Blood Sample Collection; Section 9, Statistics; Appendix A, Information Regarding 
Effectiveness of Contraceptive Methods.  
Description of change:   The comparator arm, idelalisib, was removed from the study, 
allowing for removal of the biweekly assessments for ANC and liver enzymes required for idelalisib and reduction in the number of subjects from 180 to 100. 
Rationale for change:   A PI3K inhibitor, copanlisib, was recently grant ed accelerated 
approval by [CONTACT_147122].  Therefore, the PI3Kδ inhibitor , idelalisib , can no longer be 
considered the standard of care in the US and consequently is not a relevant comparator 
for new PI3K inhibitors.  It is also not feasible to replace idelalisib with copanlisib, which 
is currently approved only in the US.  Thi s change allows the number of subjects to be 
reduced from 180 to 100. 
2. Section 3.1, Inclusion Criteria  
Description of change:   Removed South Korea– specific age requirement.  
Rationale for change:  Study will not be conducted in South Korea  
3. Section 3.2, Subject Exclusion Criteria  
Description of change:   Exclusion criterion 17 (liver disease) was updated. 
Rationale for change:   As there have been no reported HBV or HCV reactivations in 
INCB [ZIP_CODE] -101, the exclusion criterion was amended to align with those of approved 
PI3K inhibitors.

Description of change:   The EudraCT number has been added (2017-001624-22).  
Rationale for change:   Informational.  
2. Synopsis; Section 6, Study Assessments (Table 7)  
Description of change:   The frequency of cytomegalovirus analysis was increased to 
every  4 weeks. 
Rationale for change:   Requested by [CONTACT_147125]. 
3. Section 3.2, Subject Exclusio n Criteria (criterion 16 ); Sectio n 6, Study Assessments 
(Tables 7 and 8); Section [IP_ADDRESS], HIV Screening Test  
Description of change:   Revised to r equire that subjects enrolled outside the

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE] -203 Am 9  Version 9  23 DEC 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL  7. Appendix A, Information Regarding Effectiveness of Contraceptive Methods  
Description of change:   Revised to require that women receiving  idelalisib who are 
using hormonal contraceptives add a barrier method as a second form of contraception, 
and removed the statement that the investigational medicinal products (IMP), which 
included INCB050465, may reduce the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives. 
Rationale for change:   The addition of a barrier method was r equested by [CONTACT_147127].  The stateme nt that the IMP may reduce the efficacy 
of hormonal contraceptives was removed as the IMP includes INCB050465, which unlike 
idelalisib, is not a CYP3A4 inhibitor and therefore has no effect on hormonal contraception. 
8. Synopsis; Section 2, Study Objectives and Endpoints (Table 1)  
Description of change:   The primary objective was revised to state the threshold for 
conducting a superiority analysis.  
Rationale for change:   Requested by [CONTACT_147125].

10. Synopsis; Section [IP_ADDRESS], Primary Efficacy Analyses 
Description of change:   Clarified  that the point estimates and confidence intervals (CIs) 
will be  calculated for the primary endpoint of objective response rate for INCB050465 
and idelalisib and their difference, and clarified the timing for the primary endpoint.  
Rationale for change:   Requested by [CONTACT_147125]. 
11. Section [IP_ADDRESS], Primary Efficacy Analyses  
Description of change:   Clarified that subjects without sufficient baseline or on -study 
response assessment information to be adequately assessed for response status will be 
considered as nonresponders and included in the denominators in the calculations of ORR.  
Rationale for change:   Requested by [CONTACT_147125]. 
12. Section [IP_ADDRESS], Other Efficacy Analyses 
Description of change:   Clarified that ORR, complete response rate ( CRR ), duration of 
response ( DOR), progression- free survival (PFS), and overall survival ( OS) will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_6660].  Point estimates and 95% CIs will be provided for ORR 
and CRR.  Kaplan -Meier estimation s of median DOR, PFS, and OS and their 95% CIs 
will also be calculated for each group.  
Rationale for change:  Requested by [CONTACT_147125].

Rationale for change:   Based on emerging data from INCB [ZIP_CODE]-101, INCB050465 
does not appear to cause l iver toxicity.  The HBV and HCV exclusion criteria have been 
made consistent with criteria used for other PI3K inhibitors, which generally allow s 
enrollment of subjects that have been infected with HBV or HCV , but excludes subjects 
with an active infection  based on DNA or RNA tests, respectively. 
6. Incorporation of administrative changes.   Other  minor, administrative changes have 
been incorporated  throughout the Protocol and are noted in the redline version of the

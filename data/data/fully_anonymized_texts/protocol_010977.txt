Title : Optimizing a Postoperative Telehealth Mindfulness Intervention to Improve Pain -related 
Outcomes and Reduce Opi[INVESTIGATOR_481697]:  Carrie E. Brintz, PhD  
 
Participating Center: Vanderbilt University Medical Center  
 
Sponsor s: Osher  Center for Integrative Medicine at Vanderbilt  (7/1/20 - 6/30/21); NIH - National 
Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (8/5/21 - 7/31/26)  
 
Type of study : Two-arm intervention development and feasibility  pi[INVESTIGATOR_481698]:  The overall objectives of our preliminary, mixed -methods project are to optimize a 
mindfulness -based intervention (MBI) for patients recovering from  lumbar  spi[INVESTIGATOR_481699]-related outcomes and reduce post -surgical opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], and to evaluate its feasibility and 
acceptability. We will pi[INVESTIGATOR_481700], group -based MBI  for chronic pain patients1 that we have 
formatted for both one-on-one and group  telehealth delivery  to postsurgical patients , and utilize 
participant feedback to tailor the intervention to post -surgical orthopaedic patients.  
 
 Specific Aim 1 : To evaluate  the feasibility and acceptability of the telehealth MBI . We will 
conduct a  nonrandomized , sequential  pi[INVESTIGATOR_481701]  (approximately 16 
completers ) and of the group telehealth MBI ( approximately 8 completers ) with patients  recovering 
from lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_79477].  We anticipate enrolling up to [ADDRESS_618768] 24 complete the study,  
Feasibilit y and acceptability  of the individual and group intervention  will be evaluated as recruitment 
rates, session attendance, home practice assignment, study retention, and participant satisfaction.  
 
  Hypothesis 1: a) Participants will be recruited at a rate of 50%;  b) Participants will attend 
90% of sessions on average;  c) Participants will complete 80% of home practice assigned;  d) Study 
retention will be 90% at post -intervention; e) 80 % of participants will repor t moderate to high 
satisfaction with the intervention.  
 
Specific Aim 2: To further tailor the telehealth MBI to post -surgical orthopaedic patients. Using 
structured qualitative interviews and a post -intervention satisfaction survey  during the open -label pi[INVESTIGATOR_481702], we will obtain participant feedback regarding the one -on-one telehealth format, intervention 
components, and relevance to post -surgical concerns . Qualitative interviews will be coded and analyzed 
to inform revisions to th e intervention.   
  
 Expected outcome : The intervention will be revised based on participant feedback.

Post-op Telehealth Mindfulness Protocol for Spi[INVESTIGATOR_481694] 7; November 22, 2021  2. Background and Significance  
 
Lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_481709] 40% of patients. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_481710], reduced mental and physical 
functioning, and billions of dollars in healthcare costs and lost productivity.[ADDRESS_618773] increased markedly.4,32 However, up to 40% of 
patients experience continued or worsening pain and disability following surgery . Studies find that 
patients’ expectations for improvement after surgery exceed their experienced reductions in back pain 
and leg pain, and improvements in functioning.16,33,34  A substantial number of patients who experience 
a significant reduction in pain intensity after spi[INVESTIGATOR_481711]7, suggesting that multiple factors and not merely a reduction in pain intensity, 
contribute to improved functional outcomes.  
 
Prolonged prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_481712] . Studies indicate that 59%14 to 
65%10 of patients taking opi[INVESTIGATOR_395619] -operatively continue to receive opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] 12 months following spi[INVESTIGATOR_84017].  Furthermore, as many as 26% of patients who were opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -free prio r to spi[INVESTIGATOR_481713] 12 months after surgery.14,35 These findings are concerning, given the 
numerous  risks of prolonged opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], including tolerance, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -induced hyperalgesia (paradoxically 
increased pain sensitivity), misuse, abuse, and overdose8,9,36 –38, all of which can complicate post -surgical 
recovery. Effective strategies are needed to help patients reduce unnecessary or prolonged opi[INVESTIGATOR_481714]. 
 
Psychosocial factors are key predictors of post -surgical outcomes and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]. It is widely 
recognized that pain is experienced through a complex interaction of physical/neural, cognitive, 
affective, behavioral, and social factors.[ADDRESS_618774] worse pain intensity and 
disability, physical functioning, and quality of life, as well as prolonged opi[INVESTIGATOR_173668] e at 6 to 12 months 
following lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_79477].12–14,40 –[ADDRESS_618775] 
practice, despi[INVESTIGATOR_481715].49–[ADDRESS_618776]-op Telehealth Mindfulness Protocol for Spi[INVESTIGATOR_481694] 7; November 22, 2021  proposed  research will address this gap by [CONTACT_481755] -based intervention (MBI), delivered using a telehealth approach (to maximize 
accessibility), for improving pain -related outcomes and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441].   
 
MBIs have a well -established evidence base as efficacious interventions for reducing chronic pain 
symptoms. Well -controlled studies indicate that MBIs are efficacious for improving physical 
functioning and pain interference, and reducing commonly co -occur ring symptoms such as depression 
and anxiety in chronic pain populations.19,20,53  Furthermore, in RCTs targeting individuals taking opi[INVESTIGATOR_481716], MBIs were effective at reducing opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724], craving, and/or opi[INVESTIGATOR_173942].[ADDRESS_618777] extensively studied MBIs (e.g.  mindfulness -based stress reduction and  mindfulness -
based cognitive therapy), demonstrate similar efficacy as traditional cognitive behavioral therapy for 
chronic low back pain19,22,53. However, pi[INVESTIGATOR_481717]55, lending 
support for research and dissemination of multiple  psychosocial treatment options to which patients can 
be individually matched.  
Central to MBIs is systematic and intensive training in mindfulness meditation practices.[ADDRESS_618778] -surgical patients.61,62 The proposed study will leverage existing 
telehealth technology62 to study a telehealth MBI (delivered live via online video platform) in both one -
on-one and group formats and tailored specifically to address the needs of patients following spi[INVESTIGATOR_84017]. The result will be a clinically significant advance in the care o f the large population of patients 
undergoing spi[INVESTIGATOR_481718].   
 
INNOVATION  
The proposed study is innovative in its tailoring of an existing MBI specifically for use in the 
orthopaedic surgery population . MBIs have been used for the management of c hronic pain1, but

3.1. Design Overview. The stu dy will use a two-arm, nonrandomized  mixed -methods design to: 1) 
evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a one -on-one telehealth MBI delivered via live, online video 
in approximately 24 patients following elective lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_481719], 
and 2) adapt the  telehealth MBI to the specific concerns of post -surgical patients using both qualitative 
and quantitative data from post -intervention surveys and semi -structured interviews.  Participants will be 
enrolled in either the individual intervention or the group intervention, and enrollment for each 
intervention will occur sequentially.  Patient -reported outcomes (pain -related and psychosocial variables) 
and self -reported and electronically verified opi[INVESTIGATOR_481720] -surgery, [ADDRESS_618780] -
surgery (pre-intervention), and [ADDRESS_618781] -surgery (post -intervention). Semi -structured interviews 
will be conducted at post -intervention

3.[ADDRESS_618782] session, which will be 90 minutes long. The group interventions sessions will each 
be 90 minutes long. Participants will be asked to  complete the 8 sessions within 10 weeks  to allow for 
missed weeks . All sessions will be conducted using an IRB -approved HIPAA compliant telehealth 
platform in which the intervention is delivered via secure internet video link and audio -recorded for 
fidelity monitoring. The intervention is based on an existing manualized MBI (mindfulness -based 
cognitive therapy for chronic pain).[ADDRESS_618783] their own device with microphone and 
video camera (e.g. computer, tablet, or smart phone) will be given a tablet to use during the study.  
  At the core of the telehealth MBI is systematic instruction and practice in mindfulness 
meditation, which trains the self -regulation of attention to present moment experience and fosters a 
nonjudgmental and accepting response to one’s experience, including pain sensations.[ADDRESS_618784] anding, or sitting. Education on the brain -
pain relationship (gate -control and neuromatrix theory) is also provided and mindfulness skills are 
discussed within the context of pain management. Because of the importance of cognition and emotion 
in pain proce ssing, the intervention incorporates elements of cognitive therapy including exercises in 
recognizing the connection between thoughts, emotions, behaviors, and stress as they relate to chronic 
pain. Participants learn to become aware of the mental events a nd behavioral responses that amplify pain 

Post-op Telehealth Mindfulness Protocol for Spi[INVESTIGATOR_481694] 7; November 22, 2021  interference and distress, and to process and respond to unpleasant sensations and emotions more 
skillfully. Each session focuses on didactic information (introduced interactively), practicing a new 
mindfulness ski ll with discussion, reviewing previous skills, and assigning home practices. Participants 
will be requested to keep track of their practicing by [CONTACT_12550] a Home Record Practice. The 
participants will be giving a paper copy and then asked to complete in a  Survey electronically each 
week.  
Interventionist Training and Fidelity Monitoring.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_481721]. Foote -Pearce (co -investigator). Our study interventionist will be a doctoral trained clinical 
psychologist w ho has completed prior training in mindfulness skills facilitation and cognitive therapy 
through graduate -level work and/or formal training workshop(s). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_481722] a [ADDRESS_618785] 2 patients will be monitored and reviewed and then 25% of the 
sessions will be randomly selected for review during weekly sessions. The interventionist will complete 
a checklist of all the components delivered during each sess ion and make note of any protocol 
deviations.  
Potential adverse effects:  Based on results of previous literature, we expect there to be no more than 
minimal risk in this study; however, literature on mindfulness -based interventions  have not 
systematically included adverse event reporting, although most studies have not reported any serious 
risk from participating. There have been reports of increased emotional distress and increased awareness 
of both positive and negative experiences, wh ich may initially increase distress when participants are not 
used to directing attention towards unpleasant thoughts, feelings, and sensations.[ADDRESS_618786] to the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed below.

5. Trial Protocol  
 
5.1. Overview.  The patient -related activities of the postoperative telehealth mindfulness trial  can be 
divided into the following phases . 
 
Phase 1: Consent into study and screening for eligibility  
Phase 2: Enrollment into trial prior to surgery , preoperative data collection   
Phase 3: Postoperative Baseline data collection (2 weeks after surgery)   
Phase 4: Intervention (8 weeks)  
Phase 5: Post -intervention data collection and semi -structured interview s (3 months after surgery)  
 
5.2. Phase 1: Consent into Study and Screening for Eligibility. Patients will be approached for their 
consent to participate in the study  following their preoperative clinic visit  either at the clinic as available 
or over the phone, with the permission of the treating surgeon . If over the phone, participants will sign 
an e-consent form through a REDCap survey link.  The study coordinator will perform the consent 
process using a scri pted dialogue and materials developed for the study . 
 
Patients will  then be screened for eligibility in the surgical center  or over the phone  by [CONTACT_10117]. Screening through the medical record will occur prior to surgery and a scheduled 
preoperative clinic visit. Additional screening will occur either  immediately  after the preoperative clinic 
visit at the Spi[INVESTIGATOR_481724] a list of 
screening questions. All potentially eligible patients will be entered into REDCap, a study number 
assigned, and eligibility criteria confirmed.  
 
Post-op Telehealth Mindfulness Protocol for Spi[INVESTIGATOR_481694] 7; November 22, 2021  5.3. Phase 2: Enrollment  and Preoperative Data Collection . Once c onsented into the study  and 
determined to be eligible , patients will complete a preoperative questionnaire  using a REDCap survey  
either at the clinic after the visit, online after the visit, or over the phone after the visit if preferred . This 
self-report assessment will gather data on patient demographic and injury characteristics, medical and 
social history, pain self -efficacy, negative affect , dispositional mindfulness, concerns about pain , current 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_481725] . Opi[INVESTIGATOR_481726].  
 
5.4. Phase 3: Baseline Data Collection  (2 weeks after surgery) . Study participants who complete 
surgery will be em ailed  or texted (based on participant preference)  a REDCap survey to collect baseline 
data at two -week s after surgery. They can also complete the survey at the postoperative clinic visit or 
over the phone. Similar to the pre -operative questionnaire, t his self-report assessment will gather data on 
pain self -efficacy, negative affect , dispositional mindfulness, concerns about pain , current opi[INVESTIGATOR_481727] . Opi[INVESTIGATOR_481728].  
 
At this time, participants will also meet with the research coordinator, either at their post -operative clinic 
visit or by [CONTACT_648], to become oriented to the telehealth platform that will be used during intervention 
sessions. If the partici pant does not have their own device for use during the intervention, they will be 
provided with a tablet by [CONTACT_23164].  
 
5.5 Phase 4: Treatment. Once the patient has been consented, undergone surgery for a lumbar 
degenerative condition, and completed the baseline assessment , the participant will begin the teleh ealth 
mindfulness intervention. The interventionist will call the participant to schedule the first treatment 
session.  For participants enrolled in a group, the coordinat or will gather participants’ availability and 
schedule the group sessions at a time when the interventionist and as many participants as possible are 
available.  Patients will complete 8, weekly sessions over telehealth (audio and video), and will have [ADDRESS_618787] learned and then enter that 
information weekly into the Home Practice Recor d Survey electronically.  
 
5.6. Phase 5: Post -Treatment Data Collection (3 -months after surgery). After completing the 
intervention (3 months after surgery), participants will be emailed  or texted  a REDCap survey.  They can 
also complete the survey at the po stoperative clinic visit or over the phone.  Similar to the pre -operative 
and post -operative baseline questionnaire, t his self-report assessment will gather data on pain self -
efficacy, negative affect , dispositional mindfulness, pain sensitivity, current opi[INVESTIGATOR_481729] . It will also gather data on participant satisfaction with the telehealth mindfulness 
intervention. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_481730].  
 
The research coordinator will assist patients with scheduling a post -treatment qualitative phone 
interview , which will be conducted by a study investigator with qualitative research experience. Each 
phone interview will last approximately [ADDRESS_618788]-op Telehealth Mindfulness Protocol for Spi[INVESTIGATOR_481694] 7; November 22, 2021  experiences and perceptions of the telehealth delivery format, intervention components (m indfulness 
skills, didactics, home practice), perceived benefits, relevance to post -surgical concerns, concerns not 
addressed by [CONTACT_25234], barriers to participation, and suggestions to improve the intervention.  The 
interview guide is designed to re vised as needed throughout the study (e.g. changes in wording of 
questions and probes to be more clear; addition of questions that seem pertinent based on prior 
participants’ responses to interview questions).  
 
5.7. Primary and Secondary Outcomes  
 
Primary outcomes:  
Intervention feasibility and acceptability (enrollment, session attendance, homework completion, 
intervention retention, intervention satisfaction, semi -structured interview).  
 
Secondary Outcomes:

5.8 Safety Issues.  
 
5.8.1. Safety Concerns Related to the  Therapeutic Treatment. We anticipate based on previous 
research of mindfulness training interventions that the study will pose minimal safety risk; most studies 
have not reported any serious risk from participating in structured MBIs . There have been reports of 
increased emotion al distress and increased awareness of both positive and negative experiences, which 
may initially increase distress when participants are not used to directing attention towards unpleasant 
thoughts, feelings, and sensations.[ADDRESS_618789] number. Study personnel  will maintain a 
separate confidential enrollment log which matches identifying codes with the patients’ names and 
addresses (available only to study personnel ). Enrollment logs will be kept in a secured, password -
protected file on a VUMC -approved server.  All study material will be maintained in strict confidence.  
Post-op Telehealth Mindfulness Protocol for Spi[INVESTIGATOR_481694] 7; November 22, 2021  For participants enrolled in the group intervention, there is a risk to loss of confidentiality by [CONTACT_481756] a group with other patients. All participants will be asked to agree to keep other participants’ 
information confidential within the group setting.  
 
5.9 Retention.  The study participants will rece ive an honorarium in recognition of their time and effort.  
Participants  will be compensated $20 each for completing the preop intake assessment survey, the 2 -
week postop baseline assessment survey, and the 3 -month postop assessment and intervention 
assessment survey (up to $60)  and $25 for completing the semi -structured phone  interview, for a 
possible total of $[ADDRESS_618790] Survey. We will keep participants engaged th rough reminder emails and phone 
calls for intervention sessions and ass essments.  
 
5.10. Management of Concomitant Conditions.  Concomitant conditions will be managed with the 
standards of care at the local treatment facility and should not be affected by [CONTACT_28224].  
 
5.11. Adverse Event Reporting.  We will monitor and report adverse events to ensure patient safety.  
 
5.11.1. Definitions. We will use the following definitions in identifying adverse events.   
 
• Adverse event . An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence  that may present itself during 
treatment or administration with clinical procedure and which may or may not have a causal 
relationship with the treatment. Adverse events include any unanticipated problems involving risks 
to participants, or breaches of pr otocol which might entail risk to participants. The term 
"unanticipated problem" includes both new risks and increased rates of anticipated problems.  
 
• Serious adverse event . A serious adverse event (SAE) is an adverse event occurring at any time 
during the  study that results in death, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929], or a persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Other events may also be 
considered an SAE if, based on medical judgment, the event jeopardized the p atient to the point of 
requiring medical or surgical intervention to prevent the occurrence of any of the conditions for an 
SAE listed above.  
 
• Unexpected adverse event . An unexpected adverse event is any adverse event with specificity or 
severity that is n ot consistent with the risk information in the study protocol.  
 
• Associated with the use of the treatment means that there is a reasonable possibility that the 
adverse experience may have been caused by [CONTACT_8235].  
 
5.11.2. Monitoring and Reporting Adverse Events. Adverse events will be recorded on study data 
forms whether or not they are thought to be associated with the study or with one of the study 
treatments. Adverse events may be discovered during regularly schedule d visits or through unscheduled 
patient contacts between visits. IRB requirements for reporting adverse events will be followed. Where 
applicable, signs and symptoms associated with the adverse event will be graded as to severity by [CONTACT_481757] f as mild, moderate, or severe using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events.  
Post-op Telehealth Mindfulness Protocol for Spi[INVESTIGATOR_481694] 7; November 22, 2021   
5.11.3. Reporting Serious Adverse Events. Serious adverse events (SAE) must be reported upon 
discovery. This will involve completing an SAE case report form  describin g the severity and details of 
the event. IRB requirements for reporting SAEs will be followed.  
 
6. Statistical Analyses.  
 
6.1. Statistical Analysis Plan. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize quantitative feasibility 
outcomes with numbers and rates. Benchmarks for success of the telehealth MBI will be: 1) enrollment 
rate of at least 50% of eligible patients; 2) 90% of sessions attended on average ; 3) 80% of home 
practice completed on average; 4) intervention retention of at least 90%; 5) moderate to high 
intervention satisfaction rated by [CONTACT_2669] 80% of participants.  
 
Transcription of interview data will be verified prior to analysis. The P I and  study personnel will 
conduct line by [CONTACT_481758]. Themes and textual examples will be 
independently identified and subsequently discussed for consensus. Analysis will be an ongoing, 
iterative process following each [ADDRESS_618791] errors with 95% confidence intervals.         
 
7. Human Subjects Issues  
 
7.1. Sources of Materials .  All materials will be collected and recorded for research purposes. The 
socio -demographic, clinical, and outcomes information collected during this investigation will be 
obtained from multiple sources, including subjects directly, medical records, and hosp ital databases. 
These data will be entered directly into REDCap (a secure, web -based application . All data will be 
secured by [CONTACT_101692] -only access for the purpose of confidentiality. The surgery and clinic notes will 
also be used to collect data. Outcomes data will be derived from questionnaires completed both in the 
clinic and online remotely , and through interactions between the patient and research personnel during 
semi -structured phone interviews .  
 
7.2. Potential Risks .  The risk to human subjects of participation in this study is minimal due to the  
nature of this behavioral treatment . The possibility exists that a participant  may experience a degree of 
emotional discomfort related to  intervention activities resulting in increased awareness  of unpleasant 
experiences, or emotional distress due to completing questionnaires about mood and pain -beliefs. 
Research personnel and study interventionists will have referral sources available for individuals who 
request or are in need of further counsel ing or support. Study interventionists will be post -doctoral level 
psychologists with training in responding to potential increase in distress during the study, as well as 
Post-op Telehealth Mindfulness Protocol for Spi[INVESTIGATOR_481694] 7; November 22, 2021  responding to reports of severe depression, suicidal ideation, or other medical/psyc hological problem 
requiring additional attention. If this should occur, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_481731]. There is a small risk of breach of confidentiality, but the data for this 
study will be secured in a p assword protected database. Access to this database will be limi ted to the 
investigators and study staff. Data will be deidentified for data analysis and interpretation.  
 
7.3. Recruitment and Informed Consent.  Prototype consent will be prepared for the tr ial. Before 
approaching patients for enrollment prior to surgery, discussions will be conducted with patients’ 
surgeons to obtain permission. The surgeon and clinical staff will be fully informed of the nature of the 
study and any risks and benefits. T he research coordinator will approach the patient  after the 
preoperative clinic visit or a preoperative education class. The coordinator will meet with the patient, as 
well as family members  if requested by [CONTACT_4676] , and will describe the proposed study protoco l using a 
scripted dialogue and materials developed for the  study . It will be emphasized to all study participants 
and family members that the data collected will be for research purposes and that refusal to participate in 
the investigation will have no ef fect on the patient’s routine treatment. The person obtaining consent will 
inform the patient that there is no obligation to participate in the study, and will provide his/her name 
[CONTACT_481759]/she can be reached if they have further questions or wish to withdraw from 
the study at any time. The person obtaining the consent will also provide the patient with a copy of the 
consent forms and provide ample time for the patient and family to have ques tions answered prior to 
enrollment. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_108420], and this fact will be 
documented in the patient’s record.  
 
7.4. Protections Against Risk .  Under the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_481732],  all 
participants will be protected by [CONTACT_46776]’s staff strict adherence to study protocols governing 
participant safety, data privacy, informed consent, withdrawal from the study without prejudice, and 
immediate reporting directly to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_481733]. Data 
obtained with subject identifiers will be kept in password protected electronic files on a VUMC server . 
All subjects will be assigned a unique study number for use in the REDcap database and all elect ronic 
data will be kept in password -protected files to ensure confidentiality. Participants will continue to have 
access to their usual sources of medical care throughout the study. These measures will provide a very 
high level of protection against risk t o the participants.   
 
7.5. Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to Human Subjects and Others.  All participants 
will gain additional assistance  through the one -on-one or group  telehealth mindfulness intervention  in 
managing their pain and disability and we anticipate that patients in the study will report improvements 
in pain  interference,  function , and psychological well -being . There may also be a potential benefit 
derived from being enrolled in an investigation  and having additional patient assessments. Such 
additional assessments may detect unrecognized clinical and health issues, which could be of benefit to 
patients’ outcomes. Finally, participants may derive a great deal of personal comfort in knowing that 
their psychological distress are part of the surgical recovery process. Thus, a potential benefit may be a 
reduction in stress and anxiety over recovery. The potential for direct patient benefit outweighs any 
minimal risk of harm to the participants.  
 
7.6. Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained .  The proposed study is intended to provide new 
knowledge about the feasibility, acceptability, potential effects, and optimal approach to providing a 
behavioral intervention to a post -surgical population.  Such knowledge is important because the

1 Introduction  
This document is a clinical investigation plan (CIP) for the Trifecta GT post-market clinical follow -up (PMCF ) 
clinical study . This clinical study  is intended to evaluate [ADDRESS_1191576]. Jude Medical (SJM).  
 
This clinical study  will be conducted in accordance with this CIP. All parties involved in the conduct of the 
clinical study  will b e qualified by [CONTACT_8640], training, or experience to perform their tasks and this training will be 
documented appropriately.  
2 Background  and Justification  for Clinical  Study  
SJM’s Trifecta family of aortic heart valves is used in patients with valvular hear t disease. Valvular heart 
disease is characterized by [CONTACT_855504]. This may result in symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, chest pain and/or heart 
palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814]. There are two types of heart valve disease: narrowed heart valve and leaky heart valve. A 
narrowed heart valve (also known as valvular stenosis) is characterized by a narrowed valve opening, requiring 
the heart to work hard to pump blood. A leaky heart val ve (also known as valvular regurgitation) is 
characterized by a valve that does not close tightly. If the valve cannot fully close, blood can leak backwards 
across the valve causing the heart to work harder, resulting in less blood flow to the body. Some p atients may 
have a mixture of both types of heart valve disease involving one or more of the valves.  
 
Valvular heart disease can be congenital or may be acquired as a result of various diseases or infections, 
including rheumatic fever and endocarditis. Ot her causes of valvular heart disease may include, but are not 
limited to, atherosclerosis, cardiomyopathy, hypertension, aortic aneurysms, and connective tissue diseases.  
 
Valvular heart disease is responsible for nearly 93,000 valve related operations an d 20,000 deaths each year in 
the [LOCATION_002].  It is also a contributing factor for another 42,000 deaths each year.  The majority of these 
cases involve disorders of the aortic valve (63%).1  Specific aortic valvular disorders include:  aortic stenosis,  
aortic regurgitation, or a combination of the two, with aortic stenosis being the leading indication for aortic valve 
replacement in adults.  
 
Patients with either aortic stenosis, regurgitation, or both may remain asymptomatic for many years. However, 
after the onset of symptoms (angina, syncope, or dyspnea) , the average survival is less than 2 to 3 years.2  
Aortic valve replacement (AVR) appears to be the most effective treatment for these patients.2   
 
For patients that need an aortic valve replacement, the Trifecta Glide Technology ( GT) aortic valve is one 
option.  
 
 
 
  
  
   
  
 
 
The Trifecta valve receive d approval in Europe on 4 March 2010 , in Canada on 18 October 2010  and in the 
[LOCATION_002] on 20 April 2011 . The Trifecta GT valve was approved in Europe on 1 Feb ruary  2016 , in Canada 
on 8 July 2016  and in the [LOCATION_002] on 24 April 2016 .

[ADDRESS_1191604] been estimated in accordance with ISO [ZIP_CODE]:  Risk 
Management for Medical Device, prior to conducting a clinical study.  The risk analysis includes or refers 

 SJM-CIP-[ZIP_CODE] Ver. B  
Study Name: [CONTACT_855526] 19 of 32 
to an objective review of published and available  unpublished medical and scientific data. The risk 
management review of surveillance and monitoring activities finds that the Trifecta family of valves, 
accessories, and components/materials are safe for their intended use and that all identified residual risks 
associated with their use are outweighed by [CONTACT_111333].  
 Risks Associated with the Device s Used in this Study  
7.1.[ADDRESS_1191605] of anticipated adverse device effects :  
• angina  
• cardiac arrhythmias  
• endocarditis  
• heart failure  
• hemolysis  
• hemolytic anemia  
• hemorrhage  
• leak, transvalvular or paravalvular  
• myocardial infarction  
• nonstructural dysfunction (entrapment by [CONTACT_855510], inappropriate sizing or positioning 
or other)  
• prosthesis regurgitati on  
• stroke  
• structural deterioration (calcification, leaflet tear or other)  
• thromboembolism  
• valve thrombosis  
7.1.[ADDRESS_1191606] of care for subjects undergoing aortic valve replacement, such that there is no added risk 
for participation in the study.  
 Risk Control Measures  
Every possible effort will be taken to minimize the risks, including:  
• Careful selection of experienced Investigators for the clinical study  
• Adequate monitoring for each clinical study site 
• Conducting the clinical study in accordance with the CIP, all applicable laws and regulations 
and any conditions of approval imposed by t he appropriate IRB/EC or applicable regulatory 
authorities where the clinical study is performed  
• Preparation of the Trifecta GT valve  device and performance of the implant ation  procedure in 
accordance with the device IFUs  
• Training of Investigators both on the CIP and Trifecta GT  implantation procedure . 
 Possible interactions  with concomitant treatments  
The Trifecta GT valve has magnetic resonance conditions and any use of MRI in implanted subjects 
should be done according to the current Instructions for Use (IFU).  
 Anticipated Benefits  
Potential benefits to the subjects may include, but are not limited to:  
• relief of valvular pathology (aortic stenosis, and/or aortic regurgitation)  
• improved hemodynamic performance  

 SJM-CIP-[ZIP_CODE] Ver. B  
Study Name: [CONTACT_855526] 20 of 32 
• avoidance of long term a nticoagulation therapy  
  
In addition to these benefits, additional benefits may occur to future patients through experience 
gained in this clinical study.  
 Risk -to-Benefit R ationale  
Patients who have a malfunctioning native or prosthetic aortic valve requir e intervention.  Without 
intervention, patients whom have a malfunctioning aortic valve also will have a poor long -term 
prognosis with mortality rates that can exceed 50% by [ADDRESS_1191607] an excellent safety profile.   
  As 
such, the benefits outweigh the risks associated with the use of the device and its 
components/materials.  
8 Requirements for Investigator Records and R eports  
 Deviations from CIP  
A deviation is defined as an instance(s) of failure to follow, intentionally or unintentionally, the 
requirements of the CIP. The investigator should not deviate from the CIP.  
 
In some cases, failure to comply with the CIP may be considered failure to protect the rights, safety 
and well -being of subjects; such  non-compliance exposes subjects to unreasonable risks. Examples: 
failure to adhere to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, failure to perform safety assessments intended to 
detect adverse events. Investigators should seek to minimize such risks by [CONTACT_855511] t o the CIP.  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_110567], complete, and current records, including documents showing the date 
of and reason for each deviation from the CIP. Relevant information for each deviation will be 
documented as soon as possible on the applicable CRF. The site will submit the CRF to the Sponsor.  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_110568]/EC.  
 
Under emergency circumstances, deviations from the CIP to protect the rights, safety and well -being 
of subjects may proceed without prior approval of the Sponsor and the IRB/EC. Such deviations shall 
be documented and reported to the Sponsor and the IRB/EC as soon as possible.  
 Safety Reporting  
Safety surveillance and the safety reporting by [CONTACT_855512]. Refer to Section 5.[ADDRESS_1191608]/investigator concludes his participation into the 
clinical study or the subject withdrawal from the clinical study . 
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_855495]/EC per their reporting requirements. The following are 
reportable events per this CIP (s ee Appendix B for definitions ): 
• Adverse Device Effects (regardless of seriousness)  
• Serious Adverse Events (regardless of severity) including those specified in Edmunds Criteria5 
which include:  
o Structural valve deterioration

Study Name: [CONTACT_855526] 21 of 32 
o Nonstructural dysfunction  
o Embolism (valve related)  
o Valve thrombosis  
o Major bleeding event  
o Endocarditis  
o Death  
 
The above events will be reported to the Sponsor.  The Sponsor will ensure that all events are 
reported to the relevant authorities as per regulations. The sites should notify the Sponsor of 
reportable adverse events by [CONTACT_855513] C RF within the electronic data 
capture (EDC) system.  
 
The investigator should report all SAEs to the Sponsor as soon as possible but no later than outlined 
below.  
 
Clinical Site  Reporting timelines  
All Sites  SAEs must be reported to the Sponsor no later t han 3 calendar days from the 
day the study  personnel became aware of the event or as per the investigative 
site’s local requirements, if the requirement is more stringent than those outlined.  
 
The date the study  staff became aware the event met the criteria of an SAE must be recorded in the 
source document.  The Investigator will further report the SAE to the local IRB/EC according to the 
institution’s IRB/EC reporting requirements.  
 
Adverse events will be monito red until they are adequately resolved or the subject has ended his/her 
participation in the trial, whichever comes first. The status of the subject’s condition should be 
documented at each visit.  
 
Records relating to the subject’s subsequent medical cours e must be maintained and submitted (as 
applicable) to the Sponsor until the event has subsided or, in case of permanent impairment, until the 
event stabilizes and the overall clinical outcome has been ascertained. Adverse events will be 
monitored until the y are adequately resolved.  The status of the subject’s condition should be 
documented at each visit.   
 
The following information should be collected for each event : 
• Date AE occurred  
• Date the site, PI, became aware of the event  
• Main symptoms of the event  
• Treatment  
• Seriousness  
• Relationship to device

Major Bleeding Event  
Any epi[INVESTIGATOR_170834], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], operation, 
pericardiocentesis, or permanent injury (e.g., vision loss) or requires transfusion.  A bleeding event is 
reportable whether or not the subject is taking anticoagulation or antiplatelet drugs, since bleeding events 
can occur in subjects who are not receiving anticoagulants.  

 SJM-CIP-[ZIP_CODE] Ver. B  
Study Name: [CONTACT_855526] 28 of 32 
Embolic stroke complicated by [CONTACT_170849] a neurological event under “embolism” and is not 
included as a separate bleeding event.  
Death  
Valve -related Mortality :  Death due to any of the following events involving the study valve: structural 
valvular deterioration, nonstructural dysfunction, valve thrombosis, embolism, bleeding event, 
endocarditis, or reoperation.  Sudden, unexplained deaths of subjects with an operated valve are included 
as valve related mortality.  
Sudden, unexpected, and unexplained deaths are sudden when they o ccur within one hour of an event of 
abrupt onset; unexpected if they occur in a previously well subject; and unexplained if no cause can be 
determined.  
Other cardiac Mortality :  Death resulting from cardiac causes, excluding valve -related mortality.  
Examp les include congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, and documented fatal 
arrhythmias.  
Other cause Mortality :  Death due to any cause, excluding valve -related mortality or other cardiac 
mortality.  
Embolism  
Embolism is any embolic event that o ccurs in the absence of infection after the immediate perioperative 
period (when anesthesia -induced unconsciousness is completely reversed).  Only arterial emboli will be 
captured.  Pulmonary emboli, cardiac mural thromboemboli and atherosclerotic particle  emboli are not to 
be reported.  Subsets of embolic events are:  
Neurologic Even t: 
Any new, temporary, or permanent focal or global neurological deficit.  Psychomotor deficits 
determined by [CONTACT_855521].  Types of neurologic events are:  
• Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA):  Fully reversible neurologic deficit that lasts less than or 
equal to 24 hours, and if an imaging study is performed, shows no evidence of infarction.  
• Reversible Ischemic Neurologic Deficit (RIND):  Fully reversible neurologic deficit that 
lasts more than 24 hours and less than or equal to three weeks.  
• Stroke or permanent neurologic event:  A neurologic deficit that lasts more than three 
weeks, causes death or last s less than or equal to three weeks with a brain imaging 
study showing an infarction.  
Systemic Embolic Event:  
An operative, autopsy or clinically documented embolus that produced symptoms from complete 
or partial obstruction of a peripheral (non -cerebral) artery.  Systemic events should be classified 
as: 
• Minor:  symptoms resolve completely without medical or surgical intervention  
• Major:  permanent injury or medical/surgical intervention required  
• Fatal:  death results as a consequence of the embolism or from  related adverse events (less 
than or equal to 30 days or during the same course of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059])  
Endocarditis  

 SJM-CIP-[ZIP_CODE] Ver. B  
Study Name: [CONTACT_855526] 29 of 32 
Valvular endocarditis is any infection involving an operated valve.  The diagnosis of operated valvular 
endocarditis is based on customary cli nical criteria including an appropriate combination of positive blood 
cultures, clinical signs and/or histologic confirmation of endocarditis at reoperation or autopsy.  Morbidity 
associated with active infection, such as valve thrombosis, thrombotic embol us, bleeding event, or 
paravalvular leak, is included under this category and is not included in other areas of morbidity.  
Nonstructural Dysfunction  
Nonstructural dysfunction is any abnormality resulting in stenosis or regurgitation at the operated valve 
that is not intrinsic to the valve itself.  Nonstructural dysfunction refers to nonstructural problems that 
result in dysfunction of a study valve exclusive of thrombosis or infection  diagnosed by [CONTACT_170850], 
autopsy, or clinical investigation.  
Examples of  nonstructural dysfunction include:  entrapment by [CONTACT_170851], tissue, or suture; paravalvular 
leak, inappropriate sizing or positioning, residual leak or obstruction from valve implantation or repair, and 
clinically significant hemolytic anemia.  
Sudden or pro gressive dysfunction or deterioration of the study valve may be structural, nonstructural, or 
both as determined by [CONTACT_170850], autopsy, or clinical investigation.  
Reoperation  
Reoperation is any operation that repairs, alters or replaces the study valve.  The reasons for reoperation 
are to be reported and may include reasons other than valve -related morbidity, such as recall, excessive 
noise, or incidental or prophylactic removal. A transcatheter aortic valve valve -in-valve replacement 
procedure is conside red a reoperation.  
Thrombolytic or catheter -aided therapy of valve -related morbidity is not considered reoperation; however, 
the morbid event that prompted the intervention should be reported.  
Structural Deterioration  
Structural valve deterioration is any change in function of a study valve resulting in an intrinsic 
abnormality of the valve that causes stenosis or regurgitation.  
Structural valvular deterioration includes study valve dysfunction or deterioration exclusive of infection or 
thrombosis  as determined by [CONTACT_170850], autopsy, or clinical investigation.  The term structural 
deterioration refers to changes intrinsic to the  valve, such as wear, stent fracture, calcification, leaflet tear, 
stent creep, and suture line disruption of components (e.g., leaflets) of an operated valve.  
Valve Thrombosis  
Valve thrombosis is any thrombus, in the absence of infection , attached to or n ear the study valve that 
occludes part of the blood flow path or that interferes with function of the valve.  Valve thrombosis may be 
documented by [CONTACT_407815], autopsy, or clinical investigation.  Valve thrombosis is categorized as follows:  
• Obstructive valv e thrombosis:  The accumulation of thrombus on a replacement valve with 
(potentially) catastrophic hemodynamic or embolic consequences.  
• Non-obstructive valve thrombosis:  An incidental finding without (potentially) catastrophic 
hemodynamic consequences (e. g., thrombus on the outflow aspect of the bioprosthesis, etc.)

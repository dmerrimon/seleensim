insulin to control glucose levels in subjects with Type 1 diabetes (T1D). First, GLP-1 receptor agonists 
can augment glucose stimulated insulin secretion (1, 2). This is thought to be a major mechanism of 
action in patients with Type 2 diabetes (3, 4). In T1D, there may be, in addition to the anatomic loss of 
β cells, a functional component, possibly due to β cell exhaustion from hyperglycemia. β-cells  that are 
dysfunctional may be able to improve their ability to secrete insulin with a GLP-[ADDRESS_640065]. 
Indeed, in preclinical studies of the combination of anti-CD3 mAb and exendin-4, given to mice with 
new onset T1D, we found that exendin-4 augmented recovery of glucose levels primarily by [CONTACT_497634] β cells(5). The improvement in β-cell  function may depend on the presence of residual 
insulin production capacity. While older studies have highlighted the progression of T1D to complete 
insulin deficiency, more recent studies have identified subjects with long standing T1D with residual 
insulin production. In these subjects (which, in some cohorts has been as many as 67% of subjects), a 
β-cell tropic agent may improve glucose control and reduce the needs for exogenous insulin (6). 
Likewise, in a previous clinical study, in which subjects with T1D and residual insulin production were 
enrolled in a trial of Exenatide and/or Rapamycin there was  a trend for improved insulin production 
with treatment with Exenatide but failed to reach statistical significance(7).  In patients with T2D, 
Exenatide has been shown to improve glucose stimulated insulin, and we postulate that the same may 
occur in subjects with T1D with some residual β-cell function.
Second, Exenatide  suppresses glucagon secretion which may improve glucose levels. Studies by [CONTACT_497635] T1D, possibly because of the significantly impaired insulin secretion(8). The increased 
glucagon secretion itself may contribute to impaired glucose tolerance in addition to the insufficient 
insulin secretion.
Third, there is experimental  evidence that GLP-1 receptor agonists can enhance β cell replication and 
decrease β-cell death (9, 10). Human clinical studies have yet to demonstrate this mechanism, but 
treating subjects who have received islet transplants with Exenatide has improved metabolic function 
through mechanisms that may involve improved insulin secretion and/or improved β- cell survival or 
replication.
Finally, Exenatide  may delay gastric emptying (11) and therefore the time to absorption of glucose. 
This effect may facilitate glucose disposal if patients are well insulinized resulting from the use of basal 
insulin or still make endogenous insulin. 
In addition to  these actions, other “off target” actions of GLP-[ADDRESS_640066] anti-inflammatory activity. 
Inflammatory mediators may participate in the functional impairment and even destruction of β-cells  
in T1D(12). Therefore, through this mechanism, an effect on β-cells  as well as on insulin sensitivity 
may be postulated.  
 In preliminary  studies, we have found that administering Exenatide (5g sq) prior to commencing a 
mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) improves the glucose response to the test in patients with T1D with 
and without residual insulin production. Our initial studies, in patients with T1D and residual insulin 
production suggest that the improved glucose excursion is not due to increased insulin production since 
the rates of insulin secretion were not increased ( Figure 1). The subjects took their basal insulin (either 
as Glargine insulin on the prior night or basal insulin by [CONTACT_497636]), but did not take bolus insulin

1).
Interestingly, the  insulin secretion and glucose responses were reduced when the subjects were given 
Exenatide. There were variable effects of the Exenatide on the rise in glucagon levels to the meal. These 
studies are similar to those reported by [CONTACT_497637] T1D and confirm the beneficial effect of Exenatide treatment on the meal related rise 
in glucose levels that occur in the absence of insulin treatment (13; 14). Our studies also highlight the 
responsiveness of the residual β cells to the physiologic stimulus but also show that this response is not 
acutely augmented by [CONTACT_497638]. Nonetheless, based on the glucose responses we have found with 
acute administration of Exenatide, we predict that Exenatide therapy will result in improved glucose 
control with reduced requirements for exogenous insulin in patients with T1D.  Pt  MSInsulin secretory rate

effects of acute administration of By[CONTACT_497641] a MMTT. We 
included subjects with (n=6) and without (n=7) residual insulin production. We found that overall there 
was reduced glucose and glucagon AUC (p=0.0003 and p=0.0019 respectively).
Although the  effects of By[CONTACT_497642] a mixed meal are profound, the longer term 
effect of exenatide on glucose control remain to be established.  Furthermore the effects of the treatment 
on insulin secretion are not clear since in our studies, of the 6 subjects with residual insulin production, 
an increase in insulin production was seen with 2 subjects but a decrease was also seen in 4. Figure 2: Glucose levels and C-peptide secretion during IVGTT in [ADDRESS_640068] 1 (in Figure 1) in whom residual

Exenatide alone and in combination with Daclizumab on β cell function in long standing T1D for 6 
month in an open labeled trial, insulin requirements were reduced but hemoglobin A1c levels and C-
peptide responses did not improve. Liraglutide treatment for 4 weeks improved HgbA1c levels (15;16). 
In the study done by [CONTACT_497643] 2 patients with residual Insulin secretion were able to 
completely discontinue Insulin treatment after receiving Liraglutide for 4 weeks (16). In a study of the 
acute effects of Exenatide, glucose excursions were decreased which appeared to be due to delayed 
gastric emptying (14). However, all of these studies were small and, based on our data on HgbA1c 
levels from our clinic, underpowered to detect an effect of the drug. Interestingly, two previous studies 
of Exenatide showed similar effects on C-peptide, glucagon, and glucose responses that we have 
observed above.
 
3. CLINICAL STUDIES
3.1 C LINICAL EFFICACY DATA AND SAFETY DATA FOR BY[CONTACT_28578]
A randomized, open-label non-inferiority trial (DURATION-1) in 295 patients with Type 2 diabetes 
not adequately controlled with diet and exercise or with antidiabetic drugs compared the addition of 
ER Exenatide 2 mg once weekly with immediate-release (IR) exenatide 5 mcg twice daily for 4 
weeks, followed by 10 mcg twice daily. At 30 weeks, hemoglobin A1c (A1c) reductions were 1.9% 
with ER Exenatide and 1.5% with the IR formulation. Weight loss was about 3.6 kg with either 
formulation. After the 30-week trial, patients taking IR Exenatide were switched to the ER drug and 
followed for a total of 2 years; over that period of time, the improvements in fasting glucose, A1c and 
weight persisted (17). 
In a similar open-label 24-week comparative trial in 252 patients with Type 2 diabetes (DURATION-
5), ER Exenatide lowered A1c 1.6%, while the IR formulation lowered it 0.9%. Patients taking the 
ER formulation lost about 2.[ADDRESS_640072] about 1.4 kg. Nausea was 
less common with the ER formulation (18).
In an unpublished, open-label, 26-week non-inferiority trial in patients with Type 2 diabetes

Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma 
By[CONTACT_497644] a personal or family history of medullary 
thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 
2 (MEN 2). 
Hypersensitivity  
By[CONTACT_497645] a prior serious hypersensitivity reaction to 
Exenatide or to any of the product components. 
4.2. W ARNING AND PRECAUTIONS
Risk of Thyroid  C-cell Tumors:  In both genders of rats, Exenatide extended-release caused 
a dose-related and treatment-duration dependent increase in the incidence of thyroid C-cell 
tumors (adenomas and/or carcinomas) at clinically relevant exposures compared to controls. A 
statistically significant increase in malignant thyroid C-cell carcinomas was observed in female 
rats receiving Exenatide extended-release at 25-times clinical exposure compared to controls 
and higher incidences were noted in males above controls in all treated groups at ≥2-times 
clinical exposure. The potential of Exenatide extended-release to induce C-cell tumors in mice 
has not been evaluated. Other GLP-[ADDRESS_640073] also induced thyroid C-cell 
adenomas and carcinomas in male and female mice and rats at clinically relevant exposures. It 
is unknown whether By[CONTACT_497646] C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid 
carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of Exenatide extended-release-induced 
rodent thyroid C-cell tumors could not be determined by [CONTACT_57665]. Serum 
calcitonin was not assessed in the clinical trials supporting the approval of By[CONTACT_28556]. 
Serum calcitonin  is a biological marker of MTC. Patients with MTC usually have calcitonin 
values >50 ng/L. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging 
should be referred to an endocrinologist for further evaluation. Routine monitoring of serum 
calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in 
patients treated with By[CONTACT_28556]. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary 
procedures, due to the low specificity of serum calcitonin testing for MTC and a high 
background incidence of thyroid disease.
Acute  Pancreatitis:  Based on post marketing data, Exenatide has been associated with acute 
pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis. 
Hypoglycemia:   The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when Exenatide is used in combination 
with a sulfonylurea. Therefore, patients receiving By[CONTACT_497647] a sulfonylurea may require a 
lower dose of the sulfonylurea to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia. It is also possible that the

By[CONTACT_497628] T1DM                                                              Version 12.0                                                             July 2017use of  By[CONTACT_497648]-independent insulin secretagogues (e.g. Meglitinides) 
could increase the risk of hypoglycemia.
Renal  Impairment: By[CONTACT_497649] 
(creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease and should be used with caution 
in patients with renal transplantation. In patients with end-stage renal disease receiving dialysis, 
single doses of By[CONTACT_28557] 5 mcg were not well tolerated due to gastrointestinal side effects. 
Because By[CONTACT_497650], treatment 
may worsen renal function. Use By[CONTACT_497651] (creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL/min). By[CONTACT_497652]-stage renal disease or severe renal impairment. 
There have been  post marketing reports of altered renal function with Exenatide, including 
increased serum creatinine, renal impairment, worsened chronic renal failure and acute renal 
failure, sometimes requiring hemodialysis or kidney transplantation. Some of these events 
occurred in patients receiving one or more pharmacologic agents known to affect renal 
function or hydration status such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, or diuretics. Some events occurred in patients who had been 
experiencing nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, with or without dehydration. Reversibility of 
altered renal function has been observed in many cases with supportive treatment and 
discontinuation of potentially causative agents, including Exenatide. Exenatide has not been 
found to be directly nephrotoxic in preclinical or clinical studies. 
Gastrointestinal  Disease:  Exenatide is commonly associated with gastrointestinal adverse 
reactions, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. 
Immunogenicity:   Patients may develop antibodies to Exenatide following treatment with 
By[CONTACT_28556]. Antiexenatide antibodies were measured in all By[CONTACT_28556] -treated patients in the five 
comparator-controlled 24-30 week studies of By[CONTACT_28556]. In 6% of By[CONTACT_28556] -treated patients, 
antibody formation was associated with an attenuated glycemic response. 
Hypersensitivity:   There have been post marketing reports of serious hypersensitivity 
reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis and angioedema) in patients treated with Exenatide. 
Macrovascular  Outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive 
evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with By[CONTACT_497653].  
4.3. ADVERSE EFFECTS
Nausea, vomiting,  dyspepsia, constipation, diarrhea, headache and injection-site pruritus were the most 
common adverse effects reported with ER Exenatide in clinical trials. Gastrointestinal effects occurred 
in about 35% of patients, but decreased over time. Acute renal failure and acute pancreatitis have been 
reported in patients with diabetes taking Exenatide; whether they were caused by [CONTACT_497654].
Injection-site nodules  have been reported in about 77% of patients and injection-site reactions in about 
17% of patients.
Weight loss  is reported with Exenatide. In subjects with T2D who took Exenatide for 4 weeks, the 
average wt loss was 1.3±0.3 kg. Weight loss was also seen in the DURATION-5 trial of By[CONTACT_28556]. (18; 
20
).

However, the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with T2D treated with combination of Exenatide (By[CONTACT_28557]) 
and exogenous insulin has been low (21). In the DURATION 4 study, a non-inferiority study comparing 
By[CONTACT_497655], Pi[INVESTIGATOR_051], and Sitagliptin, no major hypoglycemia was seen (22). 
Exenatide may affect  absorption of other drugs such as oral contraceptives, antibiotics, digoxin, 
lovastatin and warfarin. Participants will be informed to take their routine medications at least 1 hour 
prior to the study drug.
Thyroid C-cell  hyperplasia has been reported with use of Exenatide in rats, and the FDA has required 
a boxed warning about the risk of thyroid C-cell tumors in the package insert.
In pregnant animals,  Exenatide at 3 times the human dose had adverse effects on the fetus, including 
reduced growth, skeletal abnormalities and other teratogenic effects; it is classified as category C (risk 
cannot be ruled out) for use during pregnancy.
4.4. BENEFITS
By[CONTACT_497656] T2D. The presumed 
mechanism of action involves enhanced glucose stimulated insulin release. We propose to test the 
effects of By[CONTACT_497629] T1D of at least [ADDRESS_640075] to treatment with insulin. Our preliminary data, 
as well as a previous pi[INVESTIGATOR_497622]. In a 4 weeks study 
with Liraglutide 2 C-peptide positive patients were able to completely discontinue Insulin treatment 
without loss of glycemic control at the end of the trial (16). Our view is that if successful, the impact 
of By[CONTACT_497657]-life: dosing is 
once weekly. We anticipate that By[CONTACT_497658] T1D and would not completely replace the need for exogenous insulin. Because patients will

hypoglycemia when near normal glucose levels were achieved (23). Insulin pump therapy has reduced 
the rates of severe hypoglycemia compared to conventional insulin use but they remain high (24). 
Because of the effects of GLP-[ADDRESS_640077] of GLP-1 
receptor agonists on increasing β cell mass or decreasing β cell apoptosis, has been shown in rodents, 
the data from human trials are not supportive of lasting effects of the drug after it is discontinued, which 
would be expected if an improvement in β cell mass had been induced(25; 26). In the proposed trial, in 
the event that we find improved insulin secretion which is maintained beyond the end of drug treatment

similar to that seen in preclinical models, would be indicated.
This trial  will be the first in its category to include a larger sample of patients and also have a longer 
follow up period compared to previous studies in this field. These factors and hopefully 
accomplishment of the primary and secondary endpoints, we believe will have a great impact on the 
scientific community and hopefully transform the current treatment of DM type I. These are all points 
that would support the novelty of this trial.

6. T RIAL DESIGN
6.1. DESCRIPTION
We propose  to conduct a multi-site randomized placebo controlled trial of By[CONTACT_497629] 
T1D of at least [ADDRESS_640079] the trial in adults (18-65 yrs.). 
Patients will  receive standard management of their diabetes by [CONTACT_497660]. Samples 
will also be collected for additional mechanistic studies.
To ensure rapid enrollment, we plan to recruit subjects from 9 academic medical centers.
We plan  to enroll a total of 120 subjects. To avoid recruitment of individuals with extreme insulin 
resistance or very labile glucose control, we propose to screen clinic attendees for: i) insulin use

who meet these screening criteria will be invited to participate in the study. The study flow is illustrated 
in the following block diagram (Figure 5).
Figure 5: Trial Flow Diagram 
Both the subject and the study personnel  will be blinded to treatment assignment. The randomization 
will be done, 1; 1, by [CONTACT_165245] (at Yale) and study personnel will be told which study kit to 
use for each subject. [COMPANY_008] (AZ) will provide study drug and placebo. As a secondary analysis, 
we propose to determine whether the presence of residual insulin production modifies the drug effect. 
To do this, we plan to stratify patients for randomization on the basis of detectable C-peptide levels at 
any time point. We will therefore wait for the results of the C-peptide levels from the enrollment MMTT 
prior to randomization. The study investigators will not be told in which stratum the patient is being 
randomized and will be blinded to the C-peptide results of the MMTT until the conclusion of the study. 
In order  to enhance participation on this trial, newly enrolled subjects will now have the option of 
entering the trial with plans to complete all scheduled MMTT or entering the trial without completing 
the MMTT except at the screening visit. All study participants must complete the screening MMTT.
The subjects will  learn how the drug is administered at the study site. Participants will also be informed 
about the common adverse effects of By[CONTACT_497661].
Study subjects  will receive standard medical care from their endocrinologist, but the study team will 
contact (by [CONTACT_19381]) the patients 7 days after visit 1 and then on a monthly basis to assess 
adverse events. At these phone or email contacts and at the study visits, the frequency of symptomatic 
hypoglycemia will be documented. 
6.2. S TUDY DURATION AND PACE OF ENROLLMENT 
Total study duration will be approximately 48 months (4 years): Screening at diabetes clinics at Yale, UCSF, Univ Mich, Univ Chicago,
Barbara Davis Ctr, Univ Miami, SUNY Upstate Medical Univ, , JoslinDiabetes Ctr for

The primary  endpoint is change from baseline in the HbA1c level in the By[CONTACT_497631]. placebo 
treated groups at 6 months.
6.3.2. S ECONDARY ENDPOINTS
1. Assessment  of Safety
a. Specification  of safety parameters: 
i. Frequency  of hypoglycemia: We will compare the frequency of 
hypoglycemic events captured on the participant’s glucometer (i.e. glucose < 
70 mg/dl) and the frequency of symptomatic or otherwise identified (by 
[CONTACT_497663]) hypoglycemia between visits between the study 
groups.
ii.      Weight loss: this will be assessed at each study visit.
iii. Other adverse events: These will be captured on case report forms. Grade III 
and IV adverse events will be reported to the IRB’s of study sites, per local 
policy.  
2.The  type and duration of the follow-up of subjects after adverse events: All subjects will be 
followed to month [ADDRESS_640080] discontinued study drug. In the event that 
an adverse event is felt to be study drug related, the individual site investigators will be 
responsible for follow up of subjects as medically indicated. 
3.Effects  on insulin secretory responses: 
C-peptide responses  to a mixed meal, adjusted for baseline, will be compared between 
the two treatment groups at 6 and 12 months. For values that are below the lower limit of 
detection, a value of the lower limit of detection will be assigned for analysis. We will 
also compare the effects of drug vs. placebo treatment between groups and within subjects 
using the AUC from the MMTT at 3 and 6 months (on drug), adjusting for baseline at 
entry, and 9 and 12 months (off drug), adjusting for the level at 6 mos. 
4.Insulin  use over 3 days prior to each study visit will be compared. The average U/kg/d will 
be compared, adjusting for baseline.
5.Glycemic  excursion: We will determine the mean amplitude of glycemic excursion, as 
described previously; using data from the glucometer.
6.Additional  mechanistic/exploratory measurements : We will test the effects of By[CONTACT_497664] a MMTT for 
the patients on which this has been collected. Measurement of GLP-1 and GIP were 
conducted as part of the MMTT at week 0, 24 and 52 and AUC was calculated and 
compared for the 2 groups. Participants not taking part in the MMTT’s and newly enrolled 
participants will not have these measurements done.

injections of the study drug in their log book (which will be recovered from study subjects at 
each visit). 
9. S TUDY PROCEDURES
9.1. DIABETES MANAGEMENT
During the  study period, all participants will receive “intensive” management of their diabetes.  The 
sites that are involved all have diabetes clinics that provide intensive diabetes management. The patients 
will continue to see their primary Endocrinologist during the study period. All participants will be 
expected to take a sufficient number of daily insulin injections to meet the glycemic targets.  In general, 
the expectation is that all participants will receive at least three injections of insulin daily, including 
short- and long-acting insulin preparations, or will utilize continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion 
(CSII insulin pump). All participants will be instructed to reduce their prandial insulin dosages by 50% 
for the first bolus immediately after receiving study drug. . If the participant’s glycemic control worsens  
they can adjust accordingly. 
Glucose levels  should be checked at least 6 times daily via the study participant’s glucometer for [ADDRESS_640090] used during 
the 3-day period immediately preceding each study visit.  Log books will be provided to participants at 
the start of the study and information regarding their insulin usage and glucose levels will be collected 
at each visit and will serve as source documents. Upon review of these records, the investigator may 
make adjustments in the insulin regimen, refer a participant to a registered dietician or if necessary take 
other approaches that will help to maintain or improve a participant’s glucose control. Participants will 
also be contact[CONTACT_497675] [ADDRESS_640091] the date, time and dose of each 
By[CONTACT_28556]/Placebo injection taken in their log book. This information will be collected at each visit and 
serve as source documents.
9.2. S TUDY VISIT WINDOWS
Refer to SOE, Appendix 1. Study visits must occur as scheduled or within these time frames: 
Visits  2-4: >24hrs but <72hrs after administration of study medication/placebo.
Visits  5 and 6 ±3 days
9.3. RANDOMIZATION
Individuals complying with all inclusion and exclusion criteria and consenting to study participation 
will be randomized to one of the two groups (By[CONTACT_497631]. placebo) in a 1:1 ratio. We plan to stratify 
patients for randomization on the basis of detectable C-peptide levels at any time point. We will 
therefore wait for the results of the C-peptide levels from the enrollment MMTT prior to 
randomization. The biostatistician will produce the randomization code and scheme through a

10. ADVERSE EVENTS
10.1.  DEFINITION
An Adverse Event  (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation subject administered an investigational 
(medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE 
can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of investigational product, whether or not 
considered related to the investigational product.
The causal  relationship to study drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess all 
adverse events (AE). For grading, classification and attribution of adverse events see section 10.4.2.
Adverse events  can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open-ended questioning, examination, 
or evaluation of a subject. 
10.1.1. DISEASE -SPECIFIC ADVERSE EVENTS
For the purposes of this study, hypoglycemia events will be recorded as follows:
Minor  hypoglycemia, defined as a glucose concentration of 55–65 mg/dL. Minor 
hypoglycemic events are not required to be documented as adverse events in the case 
report forms.
Major  hypoglycemia, defined as a glucose concentration <55 mg/dL (grades 2–5, NCI-
CTCAE manual version 4.0), or clinically: involving seizure or loss of consciousness

hypoglycemic events must be reported as adverse events on the case report forms. All 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_185507]/or emergency care will be 
reported as SAEs to the DSMB as described in Section 10.6.
 Hypoglycemia grading according to CTCAE version 4.0
Adverse Event Grade 1 Grade 2 Grade 3 Grade 4 Grade 5
Hypoglycemia <LLN-55 mg/dL <55 -40 mg/dL <40-30 mg/dL <30 mg/dL; life  threatening 
consequences; seizuresDeath
All reported hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_497626] 4 weeks of 
treatment end will be defined as possibly related to study treatment (see table 1).
Hyperglycemia will not be collected as an adverse event, unless it results in an inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
10.2.  Nonserious  Adverse Events
 A nonserious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.
10.3.S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence  that at any dose: 
results  in death
is  life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the 
event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe)
requires  inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312] (see NOTE  
below)
results  in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
is  a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
is  an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life-
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical and scientific 
judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [e.g. medical, surgical] to prevent 
one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.) Examples of such events include, 
but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].) Potential drug 
induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important medical event. (See Section 10.10 for 
the definition of potential DILI.)
Suspected transmission  of an infectious agent (e.g. pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study drug is 
an SAE. 
Although pregnancy,  overdose, cancer, and potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) are not always 
serious by [CONTACT_8661], these events must be handled as SAEs. (See Section 10.6 for reporting 
pregnancies).

if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be reported) should be reported as SAE (see 
Section 10.6 for reporting details).
NOTE: 
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8609]: 
a  visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours, that does not result in 
admission (unless considered an important medical or life-threatening event)

and requires no medical/surgical intervention (e.g. lack of housing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative reason).
10.4.COLLECTING AND RECORDING ADVERSE EVENTS
10.4.1. METHODS OF COLLECTION
Adverse events  will be collected from the time of consent and will be followed to resolution or 
until [ADDRESS_640093].
Adverse events may be collected as follows:
     Observing the participant.
     Questioning the participant in an objective manner.
     Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the participant.
An abnormal value or result  from a clinical or laboratory evaluation (e.g., a radiograph, an 
ultrasound, or an electrocardiogram) can also indicate an adverse event.  If this is the case, then 
the evaluation that produced the value or result should be repeated until the value or result 
returns to normal or can be explained and the participant’s safety is not at risk.  If an abnormal 
value or result is determined by [CONTACT_11150], it must be indicated 
as such on the appropriate laboratory evaluation form(s), and must also be reported as an 
adverse event on the adverse event form. Abnormal vital sign measurements or laboratory 
finding  deemed not clinically significant by [CONTACT_497677].

for Adverse Events Version 4.0.  This document (referred to herein as the NCI-CTCAE 
manual) provides a common language to describe levels of severity, to analyze and 
interpret data, and to articulate the clinical significance of all adverse events.
Adverse events  will be graded on a scale from 1 to 5 according to the following standards 
in the NCI-CTCAE manual:
Grade  1 = mild adverse event.
Grade  2 = moderate adverse event.
Grade  3 = severe and undesirable adverse event. 
Grade  4 = life-threatening or disabling adverse event.
Grade  5 = death.

All adverse events will  be reported and graded whether they are or are not related to 
treatment.
[IP_ADDRESS]. DEFINITION OF ATTRIBUTION
The site investigator will  determine the relation, or attribution, of an AE to the 
investigational product. The site investigator will also record the determination of 
attribution on the appropriate CRF and/or SAE report form. The relationship of an adverse

The collection of non-serious AE information should begin at consent. 
Non-serious AEs  should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they become 
serious (see Section 10.6.). Follow-up is also required for non-serious AEs that cause interruption or 
discontinuation of study drug and for those present at the end of study treatment as appropriate. All 
identified non-serious AEs must be recorded and described on the non-serious AE page of the CRF 
(paper or electronic). 
Completion of  supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities that are 
reported/identified during the course of the study.
10.6. Serious  Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Following the  subject’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related or not 
related to study drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with protocol-
specified procedures. All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period and within [ADDRESS_640094] be collected that relate to any later protocol-
specified procedure (e.g. a follow-up skin biopsy). 
The investigator  should report any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed to be 
related to study drug or protocol-specified procedure. 
An SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness. 
If the  investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related to the 
conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy or a complication of a study 
procedure), the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.
The investigator  is responsible for prompt reporting of serious adverse events. Serious adverse events 
will be recorded on the adverse event CRF and on the SAE form. SAEs will be reported to the 
institutional IRB according to the IRB’s requirements. They will be reported to the lead site within 24 
hours with the following information: 
Name  [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_497680]
Subject  number
SAE  term
Date  of Event Onset
Date(s)  of administration of the investigational product
Current  status of subject
Investigator  causality assessment
Reason  why the event is serious
The following  documents should also be sent to the lead site within 24 hours of the occurrence of the 
SAE:

Supplementary  CRF pages that are current at the time of SAE reporting: medical history, 
concomitant medications, demographics, study drug administration, death. 
As additional  details become available, the SAE CRF should be updated and submitted.  Every time 
the SAE CRF is submitted, it should be signed by [CONTACT_497681]-investigator. 
SAEs, whether  or not related to study drug and pregnancies must be reported to AZ (or designee) within 
48 hours. The lead site will be responsible for reporting to AZ. 
SAEs and pregnancies should  be recorded on the SAE MedWatch form;. Reports are to be transmitted 
via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) transmission to:
SAE Email Address:  [EMAIL_9502]
SAE Facsimile Number:  ([PHONE_10349]
If only  limited information is initially available, follow-up reports are required. (Note: Follow-up SAE 
reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.) 
If an  ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new information becomes 
available, a follow-up SAE report should be sent within 48 hours to the AZ (or designee) using the 
same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.
All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.
The lead site is responsible for reporting these events to the health authorities as applicable.  
All investigators must report SAEs to their respective IRBs as mandated by [CONTACT_476].
10.7. Laboratory  Test Result Abnormalities
The following  laboratory test result abnormalities should be captured on the non-serious AE CRF page 
or SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate:
Any  laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an SAE 
Any  laboratory test result abnormality that required the subject to have study drug discontinued or 
interrupted
Any  laboratory test result abnormality that required the subject to receive specific corrective 
therapy.
It is expected  that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be used by [CONTACT_35867] (e.g. anemia versus low hemoglobin value).

An overdose  is defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of a product that is 
considered both excessive and medically important. All occurrences of overdose must be reported as 
an SAE (see Section 10.6 for reporting details.).
10.10. Potential Drug  Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
Wherever possible,  timely confirmation of initial liver-related laboratory abnormalities should occur 
prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting the defined 
criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 10.6 for reporting details).
Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as: 
1. AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)
AND 
1) Total  bilirubin > [ADDRESS_640098], without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase),
AND 
2) No  other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, including, 
but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre-existing chronic or acute liver disease, or the administration 
of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.

not related to disease progression or study participation.
11. S TATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
11.1.  STATISTICAL METHODS
This is  a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group trial to evaluate the efficacy of 
By[CONTACT_497682], other markers of glycemic control and safety.  Data analysis 
will be conducted in collaboration with the Yale Center for Analytic Sciences.  For all analyses, a type 
I error of 5% (two-sided) will be used to test for statistical significance and will be performed using 
SAS v9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) (29) and GraphPad Prism 6.
11.2. BASELINE COMPARABILITY
Because of the size  of this study, we expect that the randomization process will produce reasonably 
comparable groups.  However, the adequacy of the randomization will be assessed by [CONTACT_497683]. 
Comparability for continuous variables will be examined graphically and by [CONTACT_148216] (means, 
medians, quartiles, etc.).  Categorical variables will be examined by [CONTACT_493330].  
11.3. JUSTIFICATION OF SAMPLES SIZE
The primary  endpoint is change from baseline in the HbA1c level in the By[CONTACT_497631]. placebo treated 
groups at 6 months. The subjects will be followed for another 6 months (to 12 months from study entry) 
to determine whether the effects of By[CONTACT_497684]. No interim 
efficacy analysis is planned. The sample size calculation is based on data collected from our clinic on 
subjects with long standing T1D. In these individuals (n=10) the standard deviation (SD) of the HbA1c 
level was 1.25% and the correlation between measurements of HbA1c, performed [ADDRESS_640100] deviation 
for the change in HbA1c of 0.61%. A sample size of 54 subjects per group will provide 90% power at 
the two-sided 0.[ADDRESS_640101] a difference in the change in HbA1c of 0.40%. Even with 
a more conservative estimate of correlation of 0.75 (0.65), this sample size will provide 81% (82%) 
power to detect a difference of 0.50% (0.60%). We will enroll a total of 120 participants to 
accommodate up to a 20% dropout. Of additional note, the given sample size will have 80% power to 
detect differences 0.08 U/kg/day in insulin dose and [ADDRESS_640102]-randomization assessment of 
HbA1c is available.

11.4. Analysis  for Primary Outcome
The primary objective of the analysis is to demonstrate that HbA1c will be reduced in subjects 
receiving By[CONTACT_497685] 6 months.  A likelihood-based ignorable 
analysis using a linear mixed model will be used to compare HbA1c between groups [Lachin, 2000 
#2444; Molenberghs, 2004 #2273] (30, 31).  The primary advantage of the mixed model when 
compared to commonly used methods such as complete case analysis and single imputation (e.g. last 
observation carried forward) is its flexibility in handling missing data.  This analysis will assume that 
missing data occurs at random.  The inclusion of baseline HbA1c as a covariate as well as the 3, [ADDRESS_640103] is significant (two-sided 
p<0.05) with a lower mean HbA1c in the By[CONTACT_497686] 6 months.   The mixed model will 
include fixed effects for treatment (By[CONTACT_497631]. placebo), time (3, 6, 12 months), and the interaction 
of treatment with time. Additional fixed effects will be included for baseline covariates (baseline A1c, 
detectable/non-detectable baseline C-peptide, site, gender, race, BMI).  We will evaluate the [ADDRESS_640104] interactions of the stratification factor (baseline C-peptide) with treatment and time using a 
multiple degree of freedom likelihood ratio test and omit from further analysis if p>0.10.  Linear 
contrasts will be used to estimate intervention group differences and 95% confidence intervals at each 
time point.  Durability of the treatment effect will be determined by [CONTACT_497687] [ADDRESS_640105], insulin usage, glycemic 
excursion as captured by a glucometer, and absorption of acetaminophen (gastric emptying). Linear 
mixed effect models similar to those described above will be used to evaluate continuous outcomes. 
The frequency of hypoglycemia and other safety parameters will be assessed and compared between 
groups using a Fisher’s exact test.
In a  post-hoc subgroup analysis, we will determine whether the presence of residual insulin production 
affects the clinical response to treatment. Individuals will be classified based on the presence or absence 
of residual insulin production. Interactions of treatment, residual insulin indicator and time will be 
added to the models described above. Linear contrasts comparing the treatment difference in those with 
or without residual insulin production will be evaluated to determine whether the impact of By[CONTACT_497688]. 
The subjects will discontinue By[CONTACT_497689] 6 mos but will be followed for another 6 mos. At 12
mos, the same assessments will be performed.

missing data.  This protocol will follow the intent to treat principle, requiring follow-up of all subjects

delivered to participants prior to protocol specified collection times.  Alternative contacts will be 
identified on entry into the study to minimize loss-to follow-up.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_497627]. Our primary analysis is valid under the assumption that 
missing data is missing at random (MAR).  We will evaluate the plausibility of this assumption by

using logistic regression to identify factors associated with dropout.   While we do not expect 
differential rates of dropout between groups or high loss to follow-up, sensitivity analysis using pattern-
mixture and selection models under missing not at random (MNAR) assumptions will be performed to 
examine the robustness of conclusions of the primary analysis to missing data. 
11.8.  REPORTING DEVIATIONS FROM ORIGINAL STATISTICAL PLAN
The principal  features of both the study design and the plan for statistical data analysis are outlined in 
this protocol and in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). Any change in these features requires either a 
protocol or an SAP amendment, which is subject to review by [CONTACT_4530](s), and the health 
authorities.  These changes will be described in the final study report as appropriate.
12. ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS
The investigational  sites participating in this study will maintain the highest degree of confidentiality 
permitted for the clinical and research information obtained from participants in this clinical trial.  
Medical and research records should be maintained at each site in the strictest confidence.  However, 
as a part of the quality assurance and legal responsibilities of an investigation, the investigational sites 
must permit authorized representatives of the sponsor (s), and health authorities to examine (and to 
copy when required by [CONTACT_1289]) clinical records for the purposes of quality assurance reviews, 
audits, and evaluation of the study safety and progress.  Unless required by [CONTACT_497691], only the coded identity associated with documents or other participant data may be copi[INVESTIGATOR_530]

The study will run through the Yale Center for Clinical Investigation (YCCI). The statistical core will 
be responsible for randomization, collection of CRF’s, and statistical analysis. The YCCI will also be 
responsible for the regulatory support. All data will be collected using the OnCORE software for trial 
management.
14. E THICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND COMPLIANCE WITH GOOD CLINICAL 
PRACTICE
14.1. S TATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE
This trial  will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, current Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
guidelines—adopting the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki—and all applicable regulatory 
requirements.
Prior to  study initiation, the protocol and the informed consent documents will be reviewed and 
approved by [CONTACT_46081] (IRB).  Any 
amendments to the protocol or consent materials must also be approved by [CONTACT_497692].
14.2. I NFORMED CONSENT
The informed  consent form is a means of providing information about the trial to a prospective 
participant and allows for an informed decision about participation in the study.  All participants (or 
their legally acceptable representative) must read, sign, and date a consent form before participating in 
the study, taking the study drug, and/or undergoing any study-specific procedures.  
The informed  consent form must be updated or revised whenever important new safety information is 
available, when required by a protocol amendment, and/or whenever any new information becomes 
available that may affect participation in the trial.
A copy  of the informed consent will be given to a prospective participant for review.  The attending 
physician, in the presence of a witness, will review the consent and answer questions.  The participant 
will be informed that participation is voluntary and that he/she may withdraw from the study at any 
time, for any reason.
14.3. P RIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY
A participant’s  privacy and confidentiality will be respected throughout the study.  Each participant 
will be assigned a sequential identification number.  This number, rather than the participant’s name, 
will be used to collect, store, and report participant information.

These are minimum amounts of CHO; most diets will include greater amounts of CHO.  There is no 
need to alter the participant’s diet unless he or she has been on a CHO-restricted diet.
In preparation for the visits including the screening visit, each participant should:
    Fast for 10 hours (but not more than 16 hours) before the test. Fasting should start the  night 
before the test, and should continue up until the start of the test. Participants should not eat or 
drink anything except water. This means no coffee, tea, soda, cigarettes, alcohol, or chewing 
gum during the fasting period. However, if hypoglycemia develops, the participant may ingest 
up to 15 grams of carbohydrates up to 4 hours prior to the start of the MMTT.
     Refrain from vigorous exercise during the fasting period.
     Refrain from working the night before the morning of the test.
     Evaluate concomitant medications being taken by [CONTACT_497695].
The above information including dietary guidelines will be communicated to each study subject by

     Regular insulin may be administered up to [ADDRESS_640120].  
     Intermediate-acting insulin (such as NPHor Lente) may be administered on the evening before 
the MMTT, but not on the morning of the test. 
     Long-acting basal (such as Glargine) insulin or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion may 
be administered before, during and after the test as usual. Participants on Glargine may take 
their usual injection at the appropriate time, and those on continuous subcutaneous insulin 
infusion may continue with their usual basal settings.
Target Glucose Level at the Start of Test
The target glucose level at the start of the test is between 70 and 200 mg/dL. If the participant’s 
glucose level is not within this range the glucose reading should be evaluated by [CONTACT_497696].  Regular insulin or short acting insulin analogues may be

    The IV should be in place for the duration of the test and must be flushed after each draw with 
saline solution.
   The participant should remain sitting or resting in bed quietly throughout the test and until the 
test is completed. However, he or she may engage in quiet, non-strenuous activities, such as 
reading, playing cards, or watching TV. The participant may walk to the bathroom between 
blood draws if necessary. 
Testing Instructions
 
Time Point −10 minutes
     Draw one 3-mL sample into the purple-top tube for C-peptide and one 4-mL gary-top tube for 
glucose.  After each vacutainer is collected the tubes must be inverted gently at least 8 to 10 
times.  Chill samples in a bucket of crushed ice or in a refrigerator set at 4˚C for no more than 
20 minutes.   At the laboratory, spin the tubes in a centrifuge (1000–1300 g, ~3000RPM) for [ADDRESS_640135] be spun within 20 minutes from blood draw. Aliquot plasma into cyrovial 
(please ensure vial is properly identified with a label that indicates the time point). Freeze the 
sample at -70°C. 
     Draw one 2-mL sample into a syringe and transfer into a chilled 3-mL lavender-top tube 
containing Aprotinin (250 KIU/mL of blood) for the glucagon sample.  Invert tube gently 8 to 
10 times. Chill sample in a bucket of crushed ice or in a refrigerator set at 4˚C for 10 minutes.  
Centrifuge in a refrigerated centrifuge (1250g) for 10 minutes. Aliquot plasma into cyrovial 
(please ensure vial is properly identified with a label that indicates the time point).  Freeze the 
sample at -70°C. 
     Draw one 0.5 mL sample and transfer into a microfuge/centrifuge tube for glucose.     
Immediately centrifuge (12.5 rpm) for [ADDRESS_640136] via YSI.
Time Point 0 minutes
C-peptide,  glucose, glucagon and YSI samples should be collected just before the participant drinks 
the Boost and; these are the “0 minute” samples. Process via the instructions above.
Then  the MMTT dose should be given with 6 kcal/kg @ 1 kcal/mL to a maximum of 360 mL. The 
participant should consume the MMTT dose in no more than 5 minutes. 
Time Points 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, and 240 minutes
For each of the time points specified above: 
Collect  C-peptide, glucose, glucagon, and YSI samples per the instructions above.
At  the conclusion of the test, check blood glucose by [CONTACT_398192], and administer insulin as per 
participant’s standard insulin plan.

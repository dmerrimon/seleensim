Title: Novel Hormonal Therap y (NHT) for Treating Patients with Metastatic Castr ation-
Sensitive Prostate Cancer (mCSPC): An Analy sis of National Veterans Affairs Health Care 
Network Data
Version: 1.0
Date of Protocol: 06 November 2023
Author: 
Rationale and Background: Prostate cancer is t hemost common cancer and the second 
leading cause of cancer death among men in the [LOCATION_002]. While the long -term outlook 
is positive for earl y-stage prostate cancer, survival rates drastically  decrease once the disease 
has spread beyond the prostate gland. Metastatic castration- sensitive prostate cancer 
(mCSPC) is form of metastatic prostate cancer among men who have never received or are 
sensitive to androgen deprivation therap y (ADT). Conventional therap y for mCSPC has been 
ADT, however, mCSPC treat edwith ADT might eventuall y transition to castration -resistant 
prostate cancer (CRPC) stage with a median survival of approximately  3 years. Upfront 
intensified tre atment with NHTs, including abiraterone acetate ( ABI), apalutamide ( APA ), 
and enzalutamide (E NZ), added to a backbone of ADT, has substantially  improved survival
in clinical trials. Due to relatively  recent approval of NHTs in mCSPC there is limited 
information on real -world duration of treatment and time to next treatment wi th these 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . The current study  proposes to use the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) 
database to 
describe outcomes of patients with NHT use in mCSPC.
Objectives: The study objectives include:
Primary objective : Describe duration of therap y (DOT) among patients with 
mCSPC who initiated NHT inthefirst line ( 1L)
Secondary objective :Describe time to next therapy (TTNT) among patients with 
mCSPC who initiated NHT in 1L
Exploratory objectives :
1.Describe patient baseline characteristics overall

DOT, TTNT, time to deep PSA response , time to undetectable PSA , and 
time to progression.
Data Sources: VHA Medical Statistical An alysis Sy stem datasets.  
Study Si ze:All eligible patients available for the analysis will be included.
Data Analysis :In the primary  and secondary  analy ses, DOT and TTNT will be described in 
the overall sample of patients with mCSPC who initiated 1L  NHT using Kaplan -Meier (KM) 
analysis.The number at risk table and the median time to event and its 95% confidence

enrollment in the National VA Health Care Network 
prior to their index date, during which 
patient baseline characteristics will be assess ed. The time period (January  2020 –December 
2022) to 
identify  NHT initiation reflects the recency  of NHT approvals, and the baseline 
period allows us to capture an y potential comorbidities and characteristics tha t may be 
confounders to the outcomes. The follow -up period will be defined as the time from the 
index date to the end of continuous enrollment, the end of the data availability , or death, 
whichever comes first. During the follow -up period, the outcome meas ures (ie, DOT, TTNT, 
time to deep PSA respo
nse,time to undetectable PSA, time to progression, and the 
distribution of next treatment )will be assessed. The follow -up period is chosen to maximally  
capture an
y potential outcomes among patients with mCSPC who initiated NHT in 1L .

Time to deep PSA response Time to deep PSA response will be calculated a mong patients 
who have baseline PSA value and at least onePSA value after 
the index date. Time to deep PSA response will be defined as the 
time from the index date to the date of deep PSA response . Deep 
PSA response will be defined as ≥90% dec rease in a post -index 
PSA value from the 
baseline PSA value. Patients who do not 
experience deep PSA response will be censored at the end of last 
available PSA assess
ment .
Time to undetectable PSA Time to undetectable PSA will be calculated among patients 
who have baseline PSA value and at least one PSA value after 
the index date. Time to undetectable PSA will be defined as the 
time from the index date to the first evidence of undetectable 
PSA. Unde tectable PSA may be defined using different 
thresholds (eg, <0.2 ng/mL ). Patients who do not have 
undetectable PSA post index will be censored at the end of last 
available PSA assessment. 
Time to progression Time to progression will be defined as the tim e from the index 
date tothefirst evidence of disease progression. P rogression will 
bedefined as PSA progression, initiation of a new therap y, or 
death , whichever comes first .PSA progression will be defined as
an increase of ≥25% and an absolute increas e of ≥2ng/mL in 
PSA from the nadir value post- index.Patients who do not

359.4.Data Sources
Data from the National VA Health Care Network will be used for this study . This network is 
the U.S.’s largest integrated health care s ystem with over 1,700 sites of care, serving 
approximately  8.76 million veterans each year. The VA Health Sy stem Corporate Data 
Warehous e (CDW) includes all medical encounter information in the VA, comprised of 
medical centers, community -based outpatient clin ics, community -living centers, veteran 
centers, and domiciliaries. The VA CDW stores data in separate dat abases, onefor each t ype 
ofclinical information -inpatient medication, inpatient laboratory, inpatient admission, 
outpatient medication, outpatient laboratory , outpatient visits, etc. The databases provide 
demographic information and contain comprehensive services, including prima ry care, 
specialty  care, inpatient care, rehabilitation, long -term care, home care, and other services, to 
military  veterans. The database also includes date of death. The date of death is extracted 
from the VA electronic health record s ystems and verified by [CONTACT_667188], including VA 
facilities, death certificates, and National Cemetery Administration. Information on CDW , 
including date of death, is updated on a dail y base. Cause of death is not available on CDW.
9.5.Study Size
As no priori hy potheses are specified, sample size calculations are not applicable. The 
number of patients eligible for the stud y will be determined i n accordance with the sample 
selection conducted per the criteria described in Section 9.2.
9.6.Data Management 
A clean, patient -
level dataset will be generated for use throughout the stud y. This process 
will entail basic exploratory  checks to en sure data integrit y; cleaning and reformatting the 
raw data as needed; and creating variables for all key  study  measures, including patient 
characteristics, treatment start and end dates, and classificatio n of treatments and medication. 
All data will be st ored and maintained on National VA Health Care Network and accessed 
over Southeast Louisiana Veterans Health Care System (SL VHCS) at Tulane Universit y. The 
data will be made accessible only  to individuals working on the current study . No attempt 
will be ma de to identify  individual patients, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], or phy sicians. Anal yses will be 
conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS I nstitute, Cary  NC).

the anal ytical approach and ensur es that all programs and results are accurate.
9.9.Limitations of the R esearch M ethods
The anal yses conducted as part of this study  are subject to t he following limitations, which 
will be addressed in an y write -up of the stud y:
As this study  will be conducted among veterans, its findings may  not be generalizable 
to other populations.
Also, as we are pulling VA only  data, we are not able to capture ca
re that occurs 
outside the VA which could lead to missing data and misclassification of disease 
states and treat ment groups.
There are no specific diagnosis codes for CSPC. Assumptions will be made to selec t 
patients with CSPC based on clinical input.
Certain assumptions will be made in order to depi[INVESTIGATOR_667176]. However, the definition of treatment patterns will nevertheless be 
subject to assumptions that may  not match up to the prescribing phy sicians’ intent .
Data are subject to inaccuracies in coding of diagnoses. The presence of a diagnosis 
code in the data does not necessarily  mean the presence of disease. The disease may  
be incorrectl y coded or the code was included as a ru le-out criterion. 
The presence of a prescription does not necessarily mean the medication was used as 
prescribed. In addition, prescriptions filled over the coun ter or provided as samples by  
[CONTACT_667189] .
Regression models cannot account for unmeasured factors .

1. Introduction  
Acute kidney injury  (AKI)  occurs in up to 30% of patients undergoing coronary artery by[CONTACT_4660] (CABG) surgery1; consequently, renal replacement therapy is often required.  In patients 
needing  renal replacement therapy, mortality  is as high as  60-70%2. There  has been a trend to 
operate on higher risk patients3, likely increasing  the prevalence of AKI post CABG . With  
roughly four hundred thousand  CABG  surgeries  performed annually in the US4, this represents 
an enormous  health care problem . Currently, there is no known therapy for AKI or way to 
prevent AKI  occurrence in this patient population . Eviden ce suggests that  elevated preoperative 
circulating endogenous ouabain (EO) , a cardiac glycoside structurally similar to digoxin , lead s to 
increased risk of AKI post CABG5,6. We propose to study the impact of giving preoperative 
DigiFab , a biological preparation approved by [CONTACT_803651], as 
a means to reduce/prevent the incidence of CABG -evoked AKI.  DigiFab  is expected to have a 
beneficial and possibly unique utility in this scenario because the antibodies it contains have the 
side-property of  also bind ing EO with high affinity  (Hamlyn & Blaustein, unpublished) .  
 
 
2.  Rationale  
Postoperative  AKI is one of the most clinically significant causes of morbidity and mortality in 
patients undergoing CABG.[ADDRESS_1109439] clinical outcomes5,6.  
 
High  plasma EO may directly cause renal damage  in vivo and in vitro5,9. In cultured  rodent renal 
cells, prolonged ouabain treatment  has been shown to  decrease nephrin  expression ( a protein 
involved in formation of the glomerular filtration barrier ).[ADDRESS_1109440] with which to interfere/preempt 
AKI opens the door to other strategies, including the possibility of short -term in vivo 
immunoneutralization.  In this regard, DigiF ab is one of several biologicals approved for the 
treatment of digitalis toxicity  worldwide.  In the US, DigiFab (BTG, Intl.) , which consists 
exclusively of monovalent Fab fragments, was preceded by [CONTACT_803652], 
Digibind (Wellcome, Glaxo, Smith Kline).  Digibind is no longer commercially available.  Both 
Fab preparations bind and immunoneutralize  digoxin a s well as other digitalis -like entities, 
including ouabain, with high affinity12,13, but differ in the rates at which their Fab fragments are 
cleared from the circulation.  Like Digibind, DigiF ab has proven to be safe and has negligible 
side effects and virtually no toxicity when used at approved doses.[ADDRESS_1109441] a randomized double -blinded study investigating the role of DigiFab  in 
patients with elevated risk of acute kidney injury undergoing CABG surgery . Patients who are 
undergoing CABG , meet the inclusion criteria , and provide consent will be enrolled in this study 
and randomized to either DigiFab  arm or the placebo  (vehicle)  arm. The number of patients to be 
consented will be enough to achieve t wo hundred and fifty  evaluable  participants . The number 
consented will not be more than [ADDRESS_1109442] C ABG will be included in this study. High r isk of AKI 
will be defined as one of the following: GFR >15 but below 60 (must be  >[ADDRESS_1109443], but within two weeks of signing consent) or a history of diabetes 
mellitu s.[ADDRESS_1109444] diagnosis or a current hemoglobin a1c of  ≥6.5%.  
 
3B. Inclusion Criteria  
Each patient must meet all the following criteria to be enrolled in this study:  
• Patient provided informed consent  
• Male or female > 18 years of age  
• Undergoing CABG and one of the following:  
o GFR  (Cockcroft -Gault)  less than 60  (should be > [ADDRESS_1109445], but within two weeks of signing consent)   
o Past diagnosis of Diabetes or current Hemoglobin A1c of ≥ 6.5%  
 
3C . Exclusion criteria   
A patient who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from th is study:  
• AKI defined as:  
o  Decrease in GFR > 25% of baseline based on RIFLE criteria17 
• Received  contrast within the past 36 hours  of IP administration  
• Prior  kidney transplantation  
• Prior  adverse  reaction to DigiFab  
• Received  Digoxin  within the past 30 days  
 
DIGIFab_Protocol_Version Date 04.24.2022.docx   6 • Has allergy to papaya, papain, or sheep proteins  
• GFR < 15 (within two weeks of signing consent and > [ADDRESS_1109446])  
 
Calculation of Creatinine Clearance (C Cr; Cockcroft -Gault  Formula ) 
CCr={((l 40 –age) x weight)/(72xS Cr)}x 0.85 (if female)  
CCr (creatinine clearance) = mL/minute  
Age = years ; Weight = kg  
SCr (serum creatinine) = mg/dL  
 
3D. Enrollment  and Baseline  
Patients awaiting surgery in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_803646] -
patients will be eligible for this study.  
After a participant completes the consent  process  and is deemed eligible for this study , baseline 
parameters will be obtained.  Laboratory tests —including basic metabolic panel ( BMP, including 
serum creatinine) , NT-pro-BNP  (N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide) , and 
troponin —and hemodynamics – heart rate, blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial 
pressure) —obtained  ideally  within [ADDRESS_1109447] to time of surgery will be used.  
Blood for EO concentrations , Proenkephalin A ,18 and TIMP × IGFBP719,20 ,21 will be drawn prior 
to investigational drug administration.  Patient characteristics including age, sex, comorbidities 
(hypertension and diabetes ) will be noted . Of note, ouabain concentrations take many days to 
return and will not be known prior to CABG .,  
 
 
DIGIFab_Protocol_Version Date 04.24.2022.docx   7 3E. Randomization  
After ensuring eligibility,  patients will be randomized by [CONTACT_36971]. Stratified 
randomization will be employed using race and sex.  Patients will be randomized  approximately  
24 hours prior to surgery. In the event that surgery is postponed to a later date, patients will be 
permitted to remain in the study. Digifab will be re -administered according to the usual protocol. 
If surgery is moved a second time  and Digifab had been given , patients will be removed from the 
study.  
 
3F. Intervention  
BTG will provide DigiFab ; placebo  (saline) will be provided by [CONTACT_1714] . In-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] s tudy 
patients will be dosed  intravenously with 80 mg Digifab or  an equivalent volume of fluid the 
night prior to surgery  (approximately 12 -15 hours prior to surgery)  and again [ADDRESS_1109448]-operative data:  
We will collect  blood for  endogenous ouabain,  Proenkephalin A , and TIMP × IGFBP7  in the 
immediate post -operative period [ADDRESS_1109449] -op 
sample window provides the only opportunity to obtain critical information concerning the 
efficacy of the DigiFab immunoneutralization.   Total serum ouabain , Proenkeph alin A , TIMP × 
IGFBP7 , and creatinine concentrations will also be obtained at 72 +/ - [ADDRESS_1109450] -operatively, need for any 
type of renal replacement therapy will be recorded. Lastly, mortality within a seven -day period 
will be noted.   
 
3H. Data  collection  
Each variable will be capture d and stored in a  HIPA A compliant and secure database.  
 
3I. Primary endpoint:  Changes in GFR will be compared in patients who receive placebo and 
intervention  by [CONTACT_803653], as appropriate , parametric or non -parametric tests. The primary 
endpoint will compare only patients with the 50% highest  baseline (preoperative) concentrations  
of ouabain .   
 
3J. Secondary endpoints :  
1. Comparing GFR amongst all patients  
2. Incidence of AKI  comparing the groups  (25% decrease from baseline)  
3. Incidenc e of renal replacement therapy  by [ADDRESS_1109451] time ( top 50% ).  
6.  Comparison of change in Proenkephalin A in patients receiving Digifab and placebo.  
7. Comparison of change of TIMP × IGFBP7 in patients receiving Digifab and placebo.  
8. Comparison of GFR in patie nts receiving one dose and patients receiving two doses of 
Digifab.  
 
 
DIGIFab_Protocol_Version Date 04.24.2022.docx   [ADDRESS_1109452] a GFR of 50 which corre lates to a creatinine of 
129 µm ol/l. Previous studies have shown a post-operative  mean increase of  48 µmol/l with a 
standard deviation of 76. Therefore, on average, post-operative creatinine should be  177 µ mol/l , 
which is roughly a GFR of 35 . A trial of 62 patients  per group  (top half of elevated ouabain 
concentrations)  should have a power of >70% to detect a 36 µmol/l difference in plasma 
creatinine , i.e., a creatinine of 141 µ mol/l (177 -36).  A creatinine of 141 µ mol/l correlate s to a 
GFR of 45 —a ~25% increase  in GFR . 
 
4. Risks  
The primary risk associated with this study includes all of the potential adverse effects of 
DigiFab including: anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions, delayed allergic reactions, and a 
febrile response to immune complexes formed . However, since the Fab fragment of the antibody 
lacks the antigenic determinants of the Fc region, this should pose a reduced immunogenic 
threat.  Of note, no patients during the clinical trials experienced an anaphylactic event. Patients 
with allergies to sheep protein would be at particular risk.  In a registry of [ADDRESS_1109453] (DSMB) which will  assess the 
safety of the trial after 62 patients (first 25% of patients  are enrolled ). An unblinded coordinator 
will provide the board with all adverse events and deaths to investigate. The DSM board will 
evaluate the cause of deaths and allergic reactions. The panel will consist of [CONTACT_803656], [CONTACT_803657], [CONTACT_803658] , and a statistician .  
 
5.  Benefits  
Study participants may experience short and long -term bene fits. Potential benefits include 
prevention of AKI, reduced hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], protection from renal replacement therapy , and 
decreased mortality . In the long term, potential benefits include protection from : progression to 
chronic kidney disease, need for renal replacement therapy  and early death.[ADDRESS_1109454] a provisional patent and a patent pending for the use 
of DigiFab (and/or a ouabain antagonist ) to prevent renal dysfunction in patients undergoing 
CABG.  All investigators will be blinded to the treatment received until all data are finalized.  
 
9.  HIPAA Compliance  
All authors have completed HIPPA training in accordance with the University of Maryland.  
 
10.  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_803647] n or unknown  
side effects of DigiFab are occurring with unacceptable symptoms for the patient and/or 
mortality. The DSM B will determine the specific rules.

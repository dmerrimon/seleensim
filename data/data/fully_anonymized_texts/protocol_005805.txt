July 28, 2021 Page 7 of 65 Version 1.7 Version 1.7  4 BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE  4.1 Background Information  Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in sufficient amounts, may improve health.[1] Often, probiotics are ingested as supplements in powder, pi[INVESTIGATOR_596366], designed specifically for medicinal benefit. Such supplements have shown potential benefits in treatment and prevention of varied diseases, including diarrhea, asthma, necrotizing enterocolitis and allergies.[2-6] As an alternative to supplements, probiotics are also included as ingredients in fermented dairy products to produce functional foods; that is foods providing health benefits beyond their nutritional value.[7-10] Yogurt, for example, is a fermented milk product often considered a functional food. In fact, two-thirds of primary care physicians who counsel patients about nutrition recommend consuming yogurt containing live active cultures for the health benefits associated with this food.[11] Despi[INVESTIGATOR_596367], however, evidence for beneficial health outcomes is limited.  4.1.[ADDRESS_787458]. The intestinal microbiota includes hundreds of species of facultative and obligate anaerobes.[12] The human intestine is home to over 100 trillion microorganisms. When functioning appropriately, this high-species diversity produces homeostasis of the gut.[13] This balance is often disturbed by [CONTACT_596424], causing a disturbance of the fecal microbiota and resulting in, among other effects, decreased short chain fatty acid metabolism. This causes the accumulation of luminal carbohydrate, subsequent pH changes, and water absorption.[14] Supplemental probiotics may help regulate the microbiota when disturbed by [CONTACT_596425].[15] 4.1.2 General Bifidobacterium Information Probiotics marketed as nutritional supplements and found in functional foods, such as yogurts, are principally members of the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. Members of these genera are Gram-positive facultative anaerobes and are also classified as lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Bifidobacterium species, particularly B. lactis BB-12, the principal focus of this study, can be found in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) as both autochthonous (native to a particular place) and allochthonous (derived from outside a system) residents.[16] Newborns, especially those that are breast-fed, are colonized with bifidobacteria within days after birth. Once the child is weaned, the population of these bacteria in the colon appears to be relatively stable until advanced age when it appears to decline.[16, 17] Furthermore, B. lactis, unlike the majority of anaerobic bifidobacteria, are moderately tolerant of oxygen. It is for this reason that B. lactis is so extensively used for research and commercial application.[18] 4.1.[ADDRESS_787459] include: 1) production of antimicrobial substances; 2) binding to and penetrating gastrointestinal receptors; 3) competition for nutrients; 4) enhancement of mucosal barrier function; 5) altered immunoregulation, including both anti-

The ability of BB-12 to survive intestinal transit has been documented in several studies.[36-39] Taken together, these studies document the ability of BB-[ADDRESS_787462] factors and the ability of BB-12 to grow during colonization. Studies such as the one proposed here are needed to document the success of probiotic survival in foods supplemented with probiotics.  4.1.5 Safety of Use of BB-12 Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in foods have a long history of safe use. LAB and related organisms (with the exception of enterococci) are seldom associated with infections, except in immunodeficient individuals or individuals with severe underlying illness.[40] Although bifidobacteria are not naturally found in food, they have been used as ingredients of dietary supplements and added to foods as functional ingredients for decades.[16] The BB-[ADDRESS_787463] of a GRAS petition to the FDA March 2002 (Agency GRAS Notice GRN 000049), where the FDA did not object to use of these bacteria in infant formula.   Although transferable antibiotic resistances are not very common among LAB, they do occur. BB-12 was evaluated for such resistance genes and was found to contain the tetracycline resistance gene tet(W). Nestlé provided these data to the FDA in support of its view that the presence of tet(W) does not affect the safety of BB-12 as an ingredient in infant formula. In

July 28, 2021 Page 9 of 65 Version 1.7 Version 1.7 November 2005, the FDA responded to this additional information stating that:  “Based on the information provided by [CONTACT_596429]é, as well as other information available to FDA, the agency has no questions at this time regarding Nestlé's conclusions that the presence of the tet(W) gene in their B. lactis strain does not affect the safety of the intended use of B. lactis as an ingredient in infant formula and that the discovery of the tet(W) gene in B. lactis does not change their previous conclusion that B. lactis is GRAS for its intended use as an ingredient in infant formula.”  Summary of BB-12 Safety Articles, with the identical strain we will be using:  A) Langhendries, J.P., et al., Effect of a fermented infant formula containing viable bifidobacteria on the fecal flora composition and pH of healthy full-term infants.

In a double-blind, randomized placebo controlled study, 118 healthy infants age 3-24 months consumed formula for 210±[ADDRESS_787466] milk-based formula supplemented with a high dose of BB-12 and TH-4, 39 infants received a low supplementation of BB-12 and TH-4 and 40 infants received an unsupplemented formula. The supplemented formulas were well accepted and were associated with a significant lower frequency of reported colic or irritability (p<0.001) and a lower frequency of antibiotic use (p<0.001) than unsupplemented formula. Of the 5 infants who developed an intercurrent illness or complaint, 4 had vomiting and diarrhea (1 in the placebo group and 3 in the high dose group) and 1 (high dose group) had otitis media. Three infants ended their participation because of an effect perceived by [CONTACT_596430]. Of these three, one infant developed a rash (after consuming the formula for 30 days), but was diagnosed as being viral by [CONTACT_211634]. The second infant had loose stools and the third had loose stools and vomiting (both in the high dose group). Results showed no significant differences between groups in growth, health care attention seeking or other health variables, and therefore can be concluded that long-term consumption of BB-12 and TH-4 supplemented formulas are well tolerated and safe.

In this study, 145 neonates of less than or equal to 1500g birth weight were given a daily feeding of a BB-02, BB-12 and TH-3 supplemented probiotic mixture or were given no feed supplements. Using Bell’s criteria, development of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) was assessed. There were no differences in the incidence of any signs of feeding intolerance such as diarrhea, abdominal distension, or vomiting between the study and control groups. Three infants in study group versus eight infants in the control group died (P = .218; RR 0.38; yielding a relative risk reduction of 62%; 95% CI: 0.38-1.38). The three deaths in the control group were attributed to NEC, whereas there were no NEC-associated deaths among the treated infants. There were no other significant differences in the characteristics of those who died between the two groups. No other adverse events were reported.  E) Weizman, Z. and A.

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 55 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_596370] 5-24 months were fed either a formula supplemented with probiotics Bifidobacterium bifidum and Streptococcus thermophilus or a formula without probiotics. Subjects were evaluated for diarrhea and rotavirus shedding for 4447 patient-days during 17 months. All infants maintained or improved their nutritional status throughout the study. There were no adverse effects judged to be associated with the feeding of either formulas, and adequate growth was recorded in all subjects. The probiotic formula was well tolerated by [CONTACT_590025], many of whom were initially malnourished or immunocompromised.

Aliment Pharmacol Ther, 2002. 16(9): p. 1669-75.  One hundred and sixty Helicobacter pylori-infected patients were randomized to receive either 1 week of triple therapy without supplements or triple therapy with Bifidobacterium BB-12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 yogurt (AB-yogurt). In the triple-plus-yogurt group, AB-yogurt was continued for 4 weeks after completion of triple therapy. Common side-effects, such as vomiting, constipation, diarrhea and metallic taste, were significantly decreased in the triple-plus-yogurt group, with 15 events reported in the triple-plus-yogurt group and 53 reported in the triple-only group. In summary, supplementation with AB-Yogurt can improve drug compliance and thus enhance the intention-to-treat eradication rate of H. pylori after triple therapy. Furthermore, continued supplementation with AB-Yogurt after triple therapy can restore Bifidobacterium in stools after 4 weeks.

In the probiotic group, worsening of diarrhea (n=1), abdominal pain and constipation (n=2), stomach burn (n=1), nausea (n=1), and flatulence (n=1) were reported. In the placebo group, 4 patients complained of nausea.   W) Hol, J., et al., The acquisition of tolerance toward cow’s milk through probiotic supplementation: a randomised, controlled trial. J. Allergy Cli. Immunol., 2008, 121(6) : p. 1448-1455.   In a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial, 119 infants between the of ages 1.4 to 6 months with cow’s milk allergy were assigned to two groups to receive extensively hydrolyzed formula or formula with Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12 and L. casei CRL 431 for twelve months. The tolerance to cow’s milk was similar at 6 and 12 months. Probiotic intake was confirmed because probiotics were isolated from the feces more often in the treated infants than the control infants. Parents were asked to document whether their infants showed any symptoms as a result of the study formula. The study formula with or without the probiotic supplementation was well tolerated. They did not note any difference between the groups.

Aliment Pharmacol Ther. 2008, 27: p.48-57.  In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients were randomized to receive once daily either 1.2dL of a probiotic milk-based drink containing Bifidobactium lactis (BB-12), L. rhamnosus GG (LGG), L. rhamnosus Lc705, and P. shermanii JS or 1.2dL of a placebo drink devoid of probiotics but similar otherwise to the probiotic drink. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the probiotic drink compared to the placebo on the health-related quality of life and IBS symptoms of each patient. At 20 weeks, the IBS symptom score of subjects in the probiotic group decreased significantly, with a 37% reduction compared to baseline, while the placebo-controlled group had a 9% reduction in IBS symptoms. Significant beneficial effects were also seen on the quality of life of patients in the probiotic group.

In this study, seventy-two children between the ages of 1-[ADDRESS_787487]-spectrum oral antibiotics were studied to examine the efficacy of yogurt containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), Bifidobacterium lactis (Bb-12), and Lactobacillus acidophilus (La-5) in reducing the rate of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Seventy children, thirty-six of whom received the pasteurized placebo yogurt and thirty-four of whom received the probiotic study yogurt, completed the trial, which consisted of consuming two 100g tubs of yogurt/day for the entire duration of the their antibiotic treatment. The probiotic group had significantly fewer instances of adverse events. Children in the probiotic group had fewer instances of diarrhea and no cases of severe diarrhea, compared to the placebo group. 4.1.6 Probiotics Treating and Preventing Antibiotic-Associated Diarrhea (AAD) Acute diarrhea is commonly caused by [CONTACT_596432]. Children and adults are often placed on antibiotics and the rate of diarrhea associated with antibiotic usage is 20-35%, with 10-20% of the diarrhea due to Clostridium difficile.[41-49]  Antimicrobial resistance, stemming from antibiotic use, is a multifactorial problem. Major elements of the problem include over-prescription of antibiotics by [CONTACT_596433].[50] Although educating physicians and the lay public has led to dramatic decreases in antibiotic prescriptions, approximately 25% of all visits for children under age five still results in a prescription for antibiotics.[48, 49, 51-53] In fact, children ages three to 
Efficacy and Safety of BB-12 Yogurt July 28, 2021 
July 28, 2021 Page 18 of 65 Version 1.7 36 months average over two antibiotic prescriptions per year, with nearly 30% receiving over four prescriptions per year.[49]   Probiotics have the potential to reduce the rate of AAD. Numerous meta-analyses have examined the potential role of probiotics, with the positive studies showing an effect size of 25-35%.[54-59] In a recent study, Correa et al. enrolled 80 children between six and 36 months of age who were receiving oral or parental antibiotic therapy. In addition to the antibiotics, infants were given either a combination of 107 B.lactis and 106 S. thermophilus or a placebo. In this study, 31% of the placebo group experienced diarrhea compared to 16% of the probiotic group (p, 0.044).[60] In a similar study, Arvola et al enrolled children on antibiotics and gave them either a matching placebo or LGG at 2x1010 CFU/day. After two weeks, 5% of the LGG group had diarrhea compared to 16% of the placebo group, with a treatment effect of -11% (95% confidence intervals of -21%, 0%).[61]  4.1.7 Functional Foods and Yogurt Consuming foods to provide health benefits beyond basic nutritional needs is a well-accepted practice in the [LOCATION_002]. For example, many parents feed their children cereal fortified with minerals and nutrients. Another example is the addition of folic acid to many food products; this has greatly decreased the incidence of neural tube defects in the U.S.[62, 63] Functional foods are enriched or enhanced foods that provide health benefits beyond the inherent nutritional value of the food.[64] For example, BENECOL® is a margarine type food proven in clinical trials to reduce LDL cholesterol.[65, 66] The promise of using functional foods to mitigate disease and promote health is one of the major reasons so many resources are being devoted to this exciting new field.[9, 67-70]  Yogurt is defined as milk fermented with two specific bacterial species, L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus. To differentiate yogurt containing live and active cultures and those pasteurized after fermentation, the National Yogurt Association developed a seal, the Live Active Culture Seal. Any yogurt containing 108 CFU/g at the time of manufacture may display this seal. A dose of probiotics of 108-1010 cfu/day is the amount that has generally been studied and has resulted in health benefits. However, several surveys suggest the probiotic content of yogurt and probiotic supplements may be lower than labels would imply. Hamilton-Miller et al. examined [ADDRESS_787488] any indication of actual numbers and less than 50% accurately stated the bacterial species contained in the product.[71] This study highlights the lack of useful information available to consumers when selecting products containing probiotics.   Beniwal et al. studied the effect of yogurt containing L. acidophilus on AAD in an unblinded manner in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_596377]. The 105 patients in the yogurt group received two 8-ounce vanilla yogurt containers for eight days. Yogurt supplemented with L. acidophilus decreased AAD from 24% to 12%.[72] However, the unblinded nature of this study makes these results only suggestive.    4.1.8 Summary and Significance  Bifidobacterium lactis strain BB-12 is a commercially available probiotic strain that has been used in a number of feeding and clinical trials.[73-84] BB-12 has been found to survive transit through the stomach, small intestine and colon.[85-87] Additionally, long term consumption of probiotic-containing formula at levels as high as 1 billion cfu/g (240 g serving) was found to be safe and well tolerated by [CONTACT_7683].[88, 89] 
Efficacy and Safety of BB-12 Yogurt July 28, 2021 
July 28, 2021 Page 19 of 65 Version 1.7   Along with providing health benefits, BB-12 is a highly sought probiotic because it has a high resistance to acids in fermented dairy products and is aerotolerant.[90] Importantly for our study, it is believed that dairy products provide a protective environment allowing for probiotic bacteria to remain viable through digestion.[90] An issue concerning probiotic delivery in dairy products is a decrease in viable cells by [CONTACT_596434]’s shelf-life. McBearty et al. manufactured a probiotic cheddar cheese containing 108 cfu/ml BB-12.[91] The levels of BB-12 remained constant throughout six months of ripening at a pH of 5.3. Fukushima et al. incorporated BB-12 into an unfermented, canned infant formula.[35] The levels of viable BB-[ADDRESS_787489] in dairy products; however, the persistence of BB-12 in yogurt, where the pH is lower than 5.0, has not been as widely studied.   Nearly 190 million outpatient antibiotic prescriptions were given in the period of 1998-99. Nearly one quarter (22%) of all pediatric visits resulted in antibiotic prescriptions. A study of [ADDRESS_787490] infections, and bronchitis resulted in approximately 12 million antibiotic prescriptions, accounting for 21% of antibiotic prescriptions.[92] Another study found that antibiotics were prescribed for 78% of acute bronchitis epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], 65% of acute pharyngitis epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], 81% of acute sinusitis epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], and 33% of nonspecific URI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], many of which are of viral etiology.[93]  Noncompliance with prescriptions is often due to side effects, most commonly AAD.[94] Diarrhea is a common and costly disease of children in the U.S. Children less than five years of age experience 20-35 million epi[INVESTIGATOR_596378]. These epi[INVESTIGATOR_596379] 2-3.5 million physician visits (which account for 10% of all visits by [CONTACT_7683]), more than 200,000 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (13% of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_596380]), and 325-425 deaths annually.[95-98] There have been many promising studies demonstrating the potential benefits of probiotic supplementation in preventing diarrhea. However, currently, probiotics are generally given in powder, pi[INVESTIGATOR_596381]. Yogurt, which is more readily available and accepted, has the potential to greatly influence health if efficacious probiotic dosages and species are available in the product.   This study will evaluate whether a well-defined, probiotic-containing yogurt can be used as an effective delivery vehicle for probiotics. Our long-term goal is to create yogurt with sufficient probiotic dosages to positively impact many different aspects of childhood and adult health. There is widespread acceptance of yogurt with added cultures among the general population and this is one of the reasons we believe yogurt will be more acceptable than supplements.  4.1.9 Summary of Completed Studies I. Safety of BB-12 Supplemented Strawberry Yogurt For Healthy Adults on Antibiotics: The primary objective of this Phase 1 study was to establish safety of probiotic BB-12 supplemented yogurt consumed daily for 10 consecutive days by [CONTACT_596435][INVESTIGATOR_4416]. Forty subjects were randomized into two groups, BB-12 supplemented yogurt and control yogurt without BB-12, using the random allocation rule. Forty participants were recruited through Capi[INVESTIGATOR_596382] (CAPRICORN), a practice-based research network.

The Study to Investigate the Potential of Probiotics (SIPPY I and II): We have also conducted two previous, non-IND but structure/function studies using the same investigational 
Efficacy and Safety of BB-[ADDRESS_787492], strawberry-flavored BB-12 supplemented yogurt. Both were double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, allocation concealment clinical trials consisting of a combined 354 healthy children between the ages of 1 and 5 years who attended daycare/school at least 3 days per week. The active BB-12 and control products were the same as used in the two Phase I trials. The primary objective was to determine if daily consumption of a probiotic-containing yogurt-based drink for 90 consecutive days decreased absences from daycare for the children, a structure/function outcome. Thus, the total days of BB-12 yogurt consumption was over 30,000 days. There were no significant differences in the days of missed school per group. Importantly there were no differences in adverse events (see Table 3) among BB-12 and control groups.   Table 3. SIPPY I and II Adverse Events SIPPY I Events Control BB-12  N=95 N=[ADDRESS_787493] one adverse event 3 3 Diarrhea 3 2 Pyrexia 0 1 Dermatitis (Diaper) 3 0 Vomiting & Cough (1 participant had 2 adverse events at the same time) 3 0 Hordeolum (Stye) [ADDRESS_787494] one serious adverse event 0 0    SIPPY II Events Control BB-12  N=81 N=[ADDRESS_787495] medicinal regimens is around 50%; although certain interventions such as simplifying a regimen, collaboration with patients, different formulations, and increased convenience improve compliance.[99-102] We believe a readily available drink containing a high dose of probiotics has the potential to improve compliance through many of these mechanisms. This product also has the potential to positively impact the health of children and adults around the world, as yogurt will likely be more appealing to both children and their parents for long term consumption than pharmaceutical-like preparations. In addition to the benefits associated with the consumption of probiotics, there is an increased health benefit from consuming yogurt, a nutrient dense food.  
Efficacy and Safety of BB-12 Yogurt July 28, 2021 
July 28, 2021 Page 23 of 65 Version 1.7 More specifically, the rationale for this Phase I study is to determine safety of our drink and comply with the FDA’s recommendations pertaining to an IND application, we will conduct a phase I safety study.  4.3 Potential Risks and Benefits 4.3.1 Potential Risks Yogurt: Potential risks and side effects related to the probiotic cultured yogurt include: allergic reaction to drink ingredients, most likely strawberry, or digestive problems such as stomachaches or loose, watery bowels due to lactose intolerance.  There may also be side effects, other than those listed above that we cannot predict. Many side effects may go away shortly after the yogurt consumption is stopped, but in some cases side effects can be serious, long lasting or permanent.  Stool Collection: There is no known risk to stool collection.  However, there may be some discomfort with collecting stool samples.  4.3.2 Known Potential Benefits BB-12: Bifidobacterium lactis strain BB-[ADDRESS_787496] shown potential benefits in treatment and prevention of varied diseases including diarrhea, asthma, necrotizing enterocolitis and allergies.  It has been also found to significantly improve skin conditions in eczema patients.    Yogurt: Yogurt has its own known benefits coming from milk.  For every 6-ounce of serving, there are about [ADDRESS_787497].  Therefore, we believe that the benefits of the BB-12 supplemented yogurt far outweigh the discomfort and small risks participants might experience.

July 28, 2021 Page 24 of 65 Version 1.7 5 OBJECTIVES/STATISTICAL METHODS 5.1 Study Objectives 5.1.1 Primary Objective Objective 1: To test the efficacy of high dose BB-12 supplemented yogurt in preventing AAD, compared to yogurt without BB-12, in children receiving antibiotics.  5.1.2 Secondary Objectives Objective 2:  To assess the safety of yogurt supplemented with BB-12.  Objective 3:  To carry out longitudinal community structure and gene expression analysis of fecal microbiota to evaluate the impact of high dose BB-12 in a pediatric population receiving antibiotics.  5.2 Study Outcome Measures 5.2.1 Primary Outcome Measure The primary outcome is clinically diagnosed diarrhea anytime within 14 days of enrollment. Diarrhea is clinically defined as three or more loose stools per day for two consecutive days. This will be a dichotomous (yes or no) outcome of diarrhea during the 14-day period.  5.2.2 Secondary Outcome Measures We will be evaluating safety as per FDA regulations on adverse event collection. Parents/caregivers (older children, themselves) will keep a daily diary to track: bowel movements via Bristol scale (see Appendix),[103] drink compliance, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes include: duration of diarrhea, respi[INVESTIGATOR_596384], a validated pediatric quality of life score for all participants over age 2,[104, 105] stool frequency, stool form measured by [CONTACT_596437],[103] treatment failure (defined as a return to the doctor’s office with worsening symptoms), antibiotic compliance, missed school, and missed activities.

Three hundred participants will be randomized to two groups, BB-12 supplemented yogurt and control yogurt, using the random allocation rule.  This randomization approach will ensure equal allocation of subjects to each group.  Participants will be recruited through Capi[INVESTIGATOR_596382] (CAPRICORN), a practice-based research network (PBRN).  Children prescribed a 7-10-day penicillin or cephalosporin class antibiotic for a respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416], who meet all the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled.  There will be no exclusion based on race, gender, or insurance status. Based on our previous experience with clinical trials, we will be able to enroll [ADDRESS_787499] of directors and sent out to physicians for comment. Thus, not all physicians or offices participate in each study; but are allowed to choose studies that they have interest in and works with their office flow. Because of this grassroots approach, CAPRICORN has been very successful in fulfilling recruitment goals set forth a priori in studies. The network has helped the PI [INVESTIGATOR_596385] 1,500 participants in eight randomized controlled trials. 7.2  INCLUSION CRITERIA We will enroll 300 participants, half for the BB-12 yogurt drink and half for the control yogurt.

Extensive discussion of risks and possible benefits of this therapy will be provided to the parents. Consent forms describing in detail the study interventions/products, study procedures, and risks are given to the parents and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to starting intervention/administering study product. The research team will discuss all information outlined in the informed consent document with prospective parents to ensure that they understand the nature of the research and can voluntarily decide whether or not to participate. 
Efficacy and Safety of BB-[ADDRESS_787502] their personal information, compensation, freedom to withdraw (change their mind), participant responsibilities and permission to participate. The assent and informed consent processes will allow the child and parent to ask any questions and decide amongst themselves whether or not to participate. The language of the assent process will be adjusted to be age and maturity level appropriate. Assent must be affirmative. The parent or child may discontinue study participation at any time. The assent and documentation process will be as follows:  For children under the age of 7: Only parental permission is required (signed Informed Consent form containing the required elements of consent) before study-related procedures are conducted. In some cases (e.g. children ages 5-6), the researcher may determine the child is capable of being included in the assent process. While assent will not be required, in these cases, a simple oral explanation of the study will be offered to the child. There will be no separate form but the process will be documented in the participant’s study file.  For children ages 7-12 years old: A more complete oral description of the research is given to the child, along with a one-page written simplified summary of the study (such as the elements on the Informed Consent Form). An Assent of the Child addendum to the Informed Consent Form must be completed, along with the signed parental Informed Consent form. The child’s signature [CONTACT_596470]’s study file. The Assent of the Child addendum will specify if the child chose to sign the form or if it was determined that the child did not have the capability to give assent.  In the situation where participants and their parents/guardians elect to or must sign electronically, the following will occur:  Research personnel will review the informed consent (IC), research authorization (HIPAA), and (where applicable) assent forms with a participant and their parent(s)/guardian(s), and the research team will obtain signatures via the Georgetown-licensed version of DocuSign (HIPAA compliant).  • Potential participants and their parents/guardians would be instructed to use personal (rather than public) electronic devices (computers, tablets, phones, etc.) in signing with DocuSign.  • Parents/guardians—and participants in the case of assent—would be asked to specify an email address at which they can access and sign IC, HIPAA, and assent using DocuSign.  • Once signed by [CONTACT_7071]/guardian, electronic versions of IC and assent (where applicable) would be signed by [CONTACT_596438]/guardian.  7.6 PARTICIPANT STIPENDS Participants and parents/caregivers of participants will receive compensation for their time. Compensation will be given to the parents/caregivers five times throughout the study.  All stool tests will be paid for by [CONTACT_596439]’s insurance company will not be responsible for tests. As per Georgetown University IRB protocol and will be elucidated in the Informed Consent, the PI, Georgetown University, Penn State University and no parties involved in the study will be responsible for additional medical care that participants may need.   
Efficacy and Safety of BB-[ADDRESS_787503] DESCRIPTION 8.1.1 Acquisition The investigational agent, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (B. lactis) strain BB-12 (BB-12), will be supplied by [CONTACT_4657], Chr. Hansen, in Milwaukee, WI.      Chr. Hansen, Inc. [ADDRESS_787504] Milwaukee, WI  [ZIP_CODE]  The investigational agent will be shipped directly from the manufacturer to The Pennsylvania State University where they will be added to the yogurt beverage.  The Pennsylvania State University  Department of Food Science  428 Food Science Building University Park, PA  [ZIP_CODE] 8.1.2  Formulation, Packaging, and Labeling The probiotic-supplemented yogurt is composed of the investigational agent, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (B. lactis) strain BB-12 (BB-12), and also contains the yogurt starter culture, YF-L702 (a mixed culture of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus).  The Chr. Hansen Culture Collection (CHHC) numbers of the exact strains used in the manufacture of the yogurt blend YF-L702 are Streptococcus thermophilus ST5389, Streptococcus thermophilus ST5086, Streptococcus thermophilus ST4460, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus LB4351, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus LB2164.  Once manufactured, the probiotic-supplemented yogurt-drink will be packaged in quart-size plastic containers, which will yield 8 servings of the 4-ounce daily dosage.  Two of these containers of yogurt drink will be provided to the participants at enrollment along with the plastic cups and markings that denote levels of 2, 4, 6, and 8 ounces.  The daily dose is one serving of 4-ounces of yogurt each day.  This will deliver no less than 1010 CFU per day of BB-12.  Each plastic container will bear the label “Caution: New Drug-Limited by [CONTACT_4496] (or [LOCATION_002]) law to investigational use” in addition to its manufactured date and time. 8.1.3 Yogurt Drink Manufacture Yogurt drink manufacture is broken into two major activities, 1) preparation of the yogurt and 2) blending with other ingredients to prepare the drink.  To make the yogurt, a yogurt base is formulated to contain 9.0% milk solids non-fat (MSNF), 1.3% fat and 3.0% sugar using skim milk, cream, non-fat dry milk and sugar. The wet ingredients (skim milk and cream) are mixed together and then blended with previously weighed dry ingredients (sugar and non-fat dried milk). After blending the yogurt mix is pasteurized and homogenized ([ADDRESS_787505] stage, 500 psi second stage) at 83°C for 29 sec.  The pasteurized, homogenized mix is pumped to fermentation tank and given an additional heat treatment of 85°C for 30 min to denature whey proteins, then cooled to 42°C prior to inoculation with 0.02% of the yogurt starter culture (YFL-
Efficacy and Safety of BB-12 Yogurt July 28, 2021 
July 28, 2021 Page 30 of 65 Version 1.7 720). The inoculated mix is agitated for 15 minutes and then allowed to incubate quiescently until the pH reaches 4.6.   To prepare the yogurt drink the gel structure of the fermented yogurt is disrupted by [CONTACT_596440] a mixture of pectin, 36 DE corn syrup solids, sugar and water.  The pectin-containing mixture is prepared by [CONTACT_596441], sugar, 36DE corn syrup solids, and pectin to 80°C, holding for 1 hour.  This mixture is then cooled to 40°C and added to the fermented white mass resulting in the unflavored yogurt drink base.  To flavor the product, strawberry puree is then added to the yogurt drink. The composition of the yogurt drink is shown in Table 4 and the ingredients used in manufacture are listed in Table 5.  At this point, a portion of the yogurt drink is homogenized ([ADDRESS_787506] stage, 500 psi second stage) for a second time to create a drinkable consistency and packaged in plastic bottles. To prepare the yogurt drink containing BB12, an appropriate amount of (BB-12) is added to the yogurt drink, allowed to mix for 15 minutes and then homogenized and packaged as describe above. The packaged yogurt is stored at 4°C.  Table 4.

Efficacy and Safety of BB-[ADDRESS_787507] is measured the day of manufacture (Day 0) and weekly until Day 30 of shelf-life. The yogurt drink is diluted in sterile peptone water blanks (3M, St. Paul, MN) and then appropriate dilutions of the product are cultured by [CONTACT_596442]-based selective bifidobacteria medium. [104] Modified MRS agar is made by [CONTACT_1583] 4.5 grams Agar (Difco, BD, Sparks, MD) to 300 ml MRS broth (Difco, BD, Sparks, MD). After autoclaving, the agar is used immediately after addition of three selective components, 1.5mL of 0.01% Dicloxacillin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO); 3.0 mL of 10% Lithium Choride (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO); and 1.5 mL of 10%Cysteine Hydrochloride(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Plates are anaerobically incubated (VWR, West Chester, PA) at 37°C and counted after 72 hours. The final yogurt drink also is evaluated for the presence of coliforms using high sensitivity PetrifilmTM Coliform Count Plates (3MTM, Burlington, North Carolina) and PetrifilmTM aerobic plate counts according to the 17th edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Dairy Products, #7.072 and #6.040, respectively.  8.1.5 PCR Verification of BB-12 Level in Finished Drink To further verify the selectivity of the BB-12 agar, colonies of varying morphology are selected for identification using B. lactis specific PCR primers according to the method of Ventura et al. [105] Cells are lysed according to the microwave method of Bollet et al. as modified by [CONTACT_596443]. [106, 107] The sequence of the forward primer, Bflact2, is 5’-GTGGAGACACGGTTTCCC-3’ and the reverse primer, Bflact5, is 5’-CACACCACACAATCCAATAC-3’. Amplicons from PCR are electrophoresed through a 2% agarose gel at 110 volts for 2 hours, stained with ethidium bromide (Promega, Madison, WI), destained with distilled water and visualized using an Alpha-Imager (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). The presence of amplicons of the appropriate size is taken is taken as evidence the colonies are indeed B. lactis.   8.1.6 Acceptability Testing Pi[INVESTIGATOR_596388] 2-7. All children were able to consume the drink without any complaints and 13 out of the 15 requested more after consuming approximately 3 ounces of the drink.  We also completed two previous studies using the same BB-12 yogurt drink in a combined total of 354 children ages 1-4 years to determine the effects of BB-12 yogurt on daycare absences.  Participants consumed the same amount of yogurt we are proposing for this trial (four ounces daily) for [ADDRESS_787508] consumption; all were non-serious and self-limited.  High rates of compliance, over 92%, were reported in both trials, indicating the safety and tolerability of the BB-12 yogurt drink, at this dosage.[106, 107] 8.1.[ADDRESS_787509] ranged from 20.53 to 22.11% with a mean of 21.2%.  The fat content of the product ranged from 0.52 to 1.29% with a mean of 0.9%.  The pH of the product ranged from 4.42-4.7 with a mean of 4.42 on the day of manufacture and remained relatively constant throughout shelf life.  The population of BB-12 declined slowly throughout the self-life but remained within the target level (log 9 CFU/g).  Viable counts of BB-12 remained about the target value in subsequent weeks (data not shown)

July 28, 2021 Page 35 of 65 Version 1.7 8.4.2 Storage After Arriving in Washington, DC Area Once the yogurt drinks arrive at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, they will immediately be transferred to two refrigerators that are exclusively used for the study—one for Drink # 1-3 and one for Drink # 4-6. Each refrigerator is equipped with a lock and a thermometer.  Study personnel will take a daily temperature reading in each refrigerator to ensure that the yogurt drinks are kept between 32°F and 45°F.  Each refrigerator is equipped with a SENSAPHONE® 2.8K Weatherproof Temperature Sensor, which are connected to a SENSAPHONE® 400 Remote Monitoring and Alarm Notification System.  The sensor system will trigger an alarm when the temperature falls below or rises above customizable limits (between 32°F and 45°F) or if there is a power failure, and will contact [CONTACT_596445].  BB-12 and control yogurt products expi[INVESTIGATOR_596389]. The date of manufacture can be found printed on each bottle of the yogurt drink.  Once a month, the study personnel will make arrangements with Georgetown University Facilities Management to dispose of the products before or on the date of expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. 8.4.3 Transportation and Storage While being Dispensed to Participants The products will be transported to the participants’ homes in coolers packed with ice and equipped with a VWR® Digital Refrigerator/Freezer Thermometer with Alarm.  Prior to each delivery, the study personnel will arrange and confirm a mutually convenient time with the parents/caregivers to ensure that they will be home to receive the drink.  This ensures that the parents/caregivers can place the yogurt drinks into their home refrigerators immediately upon receipt. 8.4.4 Duration of Storage The products are stored in the study refrigerators at Georgetown University from the day they are delivered from Penn State (same day delivery) until transported via coolers to study participants.  As mentioned above, all bottles are labeled with the dates of manufacture and will thus be stored at Georgetown University until expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]—one month after the manufacture date.  Extra yogurt may be delivered upon request by [CONTACT_7903]/caregivers due to spi[INVESTIGATOR_4598], spoilage or any other reasons as needed. 8.4.[ADDRESS_787515] in their possession to continue the study.  Parents/caregivers will also be advised to dispose of any product that has been left out of the refrigerator for longer than one hour.  In such cases, they may contact [CONTACT_596446]. 
Efficacy and Safety of BB-[ADDRESS_787516] DNA extracted from stool samples collected at baseline and at day 7 will be amplified using B. lactis specific PCR primers, in order to assess compliance.   Collection: Stool samples from the child will be collected by [CONTACT_7903]/caregivers into three sterile, screw-capped tubes and frozen immediately. The participants will be instructed on how to collect the samples and be provided with written, illustrated instructions. (Refer to Section 9.5, “Stool Collection Instructions for Participants.”)  Transport: After collection, a member of the research team will be phoned and instructed to retrieve the samples and transport them to the laboratory. As part of their training, students and the entire research team will sign an informational sheet documenting their understanding of the risk of handling potentially infectious materials. The stool will be transported back to the lab and placed in -400 Celsius to freeze for batch transport to the Institute for Genomic Sciences at the University of Maryland Baltimore (Fraser Lab). (Refer to Section 9.4, “Stool Collection Instructions for Study Personnel.”)  Analysis: Stool samples are thawed on ice to remove a representative 1 gm sample for DNA extraction using the QiaAmp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen Sciences, Valencia, CA).  The Kit’s procedure is followed using the additional 5 min heating step at 95°C. The isolated DNA samples are subjected to B. lactis specific PCR analysis (See procedure in 8.1.5 PCR Verification of BB-12 Enumeration). A portion of the stool collected at each sampling point will be held at -70ºC for possible future investigation.  In addition to stool analysis, we will ask parents to record how much yogurt their child consumed on a daily basis.

The purpose of this visit is to have in-person time to collect baseline data, explain all forms, go over the schedule of visits and intervention, and give the participant the initial compensation.  The enrollment/baseline visit will be completed virtually, when public health guidelines recommend limiting in-person visits or when participants prefer a virtual visit.   Once it is confirmed that the parents/caregivers and child meets all inclusion and exclusion criteria, baseline data will be collected.  These include: Baseline Health Status and Demographic Information.  Following the baseline procedures, the parents/caregivers will receive the BB-12 yogurt or control yogurt for days 1 through 7-10 to be given to their child once a day.  In addition, they will also receive measuring cups that denote level of 4 ounces. The amount of BB-12 supplemented yogurt drink to be supplied will be 4 ounces per day, which is slightly more than 100 grams/day.   Parents/caregivers will be asked to collect a stool sample from their child prior to starting the yogurt.  Stool for children who stool in a toilet will be collected via a stool hat and transferred to proper vials. Stools for children in diapers will be collected directly from the diapers. Stools will be collected multiple times throughout the study.  Research staff will be trained on how to properly transport stool and how to instruct participants on collecting stool.  During the initial visit, parents/caregivers will also be given all materials to collect stools, the diary, and study materials as well as the initial compensation.   Following virtual enrollment/baseline visits, study supplies typi[INVESTIGATOR_596390]—prescribed investigational product (yogurt), forms for data collection, and kits for sample collection—will be delivered following the informed consent process and after all required signatures have been obtained.    9.[ADDRESS_787518] yogurt and study personnel will call the participant 30 minutes after to ensure that there are no side effects from the yogurt.   These follow-up phone visits will be completed on Days 7, 11, 14 and 180 (±2 days). It is imperative that all visits be completed on a timely and regular fashion.   Generally, the Follow-Up Form will be the only form completed during the phone calls, but at times depending on parent/caregiver’s report, there may be another form or two.   The follow up period includes all the time previous to the day of the interview.  Any incidents that happen the day of the visit would be captured in the next Follow Up Visit.  There will be a set day that each subsequent visit should be completed for each participant.  The research personnel should call all parent/caregiver’s phone numbers at least one time per day in order to collect the data.  If more than [ADDRESS_787519] passed from the set day, the RA should alert the PI [INVESTIGATOR_596391]’s Follow-Up Form has not yet been completed.  If the RA is not able to contact [CONTACT_2299], a Missed Visit Report Form should be completed instead and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_596392].  If a participant is unmasked at any point in time in during the study, PI [INVESTIGATOR_596393].  A Georgetown University employee in the Department of Family Medicine not associated with the study will follow up with this participant from this point on.  This particular research personnel is not to discuss any information regarding this occurrence with any other personnel other than the PI.  Additional stool samples will be collected on Days 7, 14, 21 and 30 (±2 days) (Table 8). 9.3.1 Telephone Follow Up Script In general, the Day 7, 11, 14, and 180 (±2 days) follow up will be administered over the phone, but may be completed in person.  These phone visits are when the primary data will be collected. It is imperative that all visits be completed on a timely and regular fashion.   1) Drink Number: Make sure the parent/caregiver has the correct drink number as you are completing the Follow-Up Form.  a) Ask the parent/caregiver the number on the drink bottles and this should be confirmed with the computer program provided by [CONTACT_58047].  b) If this number is not consistent, the parent/caregiver should be alerted not to give their child any more drinks and the project coordinator should be immediately alerted after completing this week’s Follow-Up Form  2) Daily Assessment Diary: Ask the parent/caregiver to collect the Daily Assessment Diary for the phone conversation.  A lot of the information that will be collected on the Follow-Up Form has been collected by [CONTACT_7071]/caregiver on their Daily Assessment Diary.  If they have not been using the Daily Assessment Diary, please positively stress the importance of the Daily Assessment Diary.  3) Explain to parent/caregiver that we are supposed to fill out this Follow-Up Form today and it should take about 5 minutes.

However, it is possible that a child missed only 2 hours to go to the doctor.  All numbers under 4 hours should be counted at 0.5 days, and all those above rounded up to next integer.   ● The parent/caregiver needs to decide if any activities were missed due to an illness. This is for all illnesses, even those that we are not collecting data about.   ● For some questions the RA may say, “Did your child visit a doctor?”  A doctor is defined as any medical personnel in this study.  Therefore, the parent/caregiver may say, “Never, but s/he saw a nurse practitioner.”  Please count this the same as seeing the doctor.   ● Satisfaction Questions: Please provide the parent/caregiver with the numbers s/he stated the prior time for a comparison.  ● Compliance: Please let the parent/caregiver know that we would like them to give their child the drink every day, but regardless, we appreciate their participation.   ● Adverse Events: If the parent/caregiver believes any AE occurred, it is imperative that the RA immediately fill out an AE Form, and if there are any SAE, alert the PI [INVESTIGATOR_596394].   5) Confirm the date and time for the next visit’s call. All interventions will be completed by [CONTACT_596447]. At day 180, participants will be queried for changes in baseline health, onset of new chronic medical conditions and non-routine medical visits in the past 6 months.   Table 8.

At enrollment and throughout the study, you will be provided with stool collection materials. This kit will include: disposable gloves, 3 stool containers/vials, small plastic zipper bags, 1 large plastic zipper bag, labels and a stool collection device (a “stool hat” – if your child is toilet trained). Before you begin the collection, please clear a space or shelf in your freezer to store the samples without contact [CONTACT_596448].  At the time of stool collection:  1. Wash your hands.  2. Put on disposable gloves.  3. You will be provided with labels. Please write your child’s STUDY ID number (if not already on the label) and the date and time the stool was collected. Do this on the label of the 3 stool containers (vials) and once on the label on the plastic zipper bag. Please do not write your child’s name [CONTACT_596471].  4. If your child is toilet trained: Lift the toilet seat. Align the “stool hat” with the rear of the toilet rim (see Photo A). Replace the seat. Have your child use the toilet as s/he normally would, letting the stool collect in the “hat”.  *Skip previous step if your child uses diapers: collect stool directly from diaper.  5. Unscrew the cap from one of the two smaller vials that contains liquid. Use the spoon attached at the end of the cap of vial to fill the container to the fill line indicated on the vial (but do not overfill; see Photo B).   6. Screw the cap back onto the container. Make sure the cap is tightly closed. Shake the vial gently until the stool is thoroughly mixed with the liquid. Repeat the same action for the second smaller vial with the liquid.

We will also have close follow-up and 24-hour phone line accessibility there is a question of an allergic or idiosyncratic reaction.    Details of all adverse events reported by [CONTACT_3654]/caregivers or observed by [CONTACT_596452]. All adverse events observed will be recorded separately and all will be reported to the IRB on IRB Adverse Event forms.  In order to prevent the occurrence of adverse events, we will be stringent in enforcing our exclusion criteria, paying particular attention to the potential for an allergic reaction to strawberry or yogurt on the part of the participant.  Any child who develops evidence of allergy or hypersensitivity to any component of the investigational product will be withdrawn from the clinical study and receive no further doses of either drink. We will continue to follow these participants for safety for the remainder of the study.   10.1 ADVERSE EVENTS An adverse event (AE) refers to any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered an investigational product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the investigational product, whether or not considered related to the product. This includes events not present at the start of the study or worsening during the course of the study even if present at the study start. An AE can be reported anytime after study enrollment; a participant is considered enrolled once the informed consent form is signed by [CONTACT_7071]/caregiver.    Details of all solicited and unsolicited adverse events reported by [CONTACT_3654]/caregivers or observed by [CONTACT_596453]. Parents/caregivers will be provided with cards, which will list the most likely possible adverse events (see Table 9), where they can record solicited and other unsolicited events not already listed. All adverse events observed must be recorded separately and all must be reported to the IRB on IRB AE forms. All AEs regardless of severity level will be evaluated by [CONTACT_596454]. The severity of adverse events will be recorded as follows:  ● Mild (Grade 1): no or minimal interference with the subject’s daily activity with intervention not indicated ● Moderate (Grade 2): some interference with the subject’s daily activity but with intervention indicated ● Severe (Grade 3): prevents subject’s daily activity and requires medical intervention ● Potentially Life Threatening (Grade 4): ER visit or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], with intervention indicated to prevent permanent impairment, persistent disability, or death ● Fatal (Grade 5): death  Based on the safety record of the yogurt, we anticipate that the following are the most likely AEs:   ● GI distress including: bloating, flatulence, nausea, emesis, anorexia, constipation and diarrhea

Additionally, all reports will be provided to the FDA and the NICHD Program Official.   10.1.2 Reporting Guidelines  If a parent/caregiver reports an AE/SAE that does not yet have a Date of Resolution and is continuous (no more than two days without interruption) across two follow-up periods, this AE/SAE will be considered one event. If more than two days pass between the reporting of symptoms, it will be considered as separate events. The total duration of the AE/SAE will be collected but only one AE/SAE Form will be completed for this particular event.   The following applies only for non-serious (typi[INVESTIGATOR_596403] 3) events; AEs of Grade 3 or above will follow the aforementioned policies for reporting and monitoring of serious adverse events. For non-serious events, if the AE has not resolved by [CONTACT_48657] 14 follow-up, then depending on the type of AE (expected or unexpected) the research assistant will either continue to follow-up with the parent/caregiver or consider Day 14 as the final Date of Resolution: ● If the AE reported is listed on the Adverse Event Report Form (Codes 1-14) as a possible, expected AE, the research assistant will continue to follow-up the parent/caregiver a minimum of every [ADDRESS_787527] the Date of Resolution. ● If the AE reported is listed as “Other” (Code 15), or unexpected, and the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_596404]/caregiver considers the AE is not related/or is unlikely related to the intervention, the research assistant will not continue to follow-up past the Day 14 follow-up and will consider Day 14 as the final Date of Resolution.     10.2 STOPPI[INVESTIGATOR_596405]:  ● Any study participant experiences death that the DSMB believes may be related to the drink administration. ● If statistically or clinically significant amount of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_596406]. ● New information from outside studies reveals that it would be unethical to continue enrolling participants in the study. ● The IRB decides that the study should be stopped. ● Any serious adverse event for which a relationship with the study product cannot be ruled out. ● The occurrence of statistically or clinically significant, similar Grade 2/moderate adverse events in the study population that the DSMB or PI [INVESTIGATOR_596407]. ● A statistically or clinically significant number of severe adverse events occur in the study population.

July 28, 2021 Page 47 of 65 Version 1.7 11  STATISTICAL AND LABORATORY ANALYSES  11.1 STUDY HYPOTHESES Hypothesis 1: Children receiving antibiotics who receive the yogurt with BB-12 will demonstrate less diarrhea than those receiving a control yogurt without BB-12.   Hypothesis 2: Yogurt containing BB-12 will be safe and well tolerated in this larger pediatric population. This is a Phase II trial that requires additional testing to further evaluate the safety of high dose BB-12.   11.2 SAMPLE SIZE CONSIDERATIONS Sample Size Calculation for the Primary Outcome: This study is a double blinded, randomized Phase II trial where subjects will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either a probiotic (BB-12) yogurt group or to a control yogurt group. The primary outcome is dichotomous, clinically diagnosed diarrhea or no diarrhea, with the rate of AAD in the general population estimated to be 20-35%. Preliminary results from the Cochrane review showed the incidence of AAD in a high dose probiotic group to be 8% versus 22% in a control group.[108] Using the Cochrane estimates, a total sample of [ADDRESS_787530] (150 per group) would provide a power of 0.92 for detecting a difference of 0.14 (0.22 control - 0.08 probiotic) at alpha = 0.05, 2-tailed. To allow for one interim analysis (at approximately 50% recruitment), and then adjusting the final p-value to 0.029, the power would still be 90% for detecting the difference of 0.14 in the rates of AAD. If the difference in the final rates is smaller than 0.14, such as 0.12, the resulting power would still be sufficiently large (80%) and power would be equal to 74% if the final difference in rates were equal to 0.10. While the hypothesis is one-sided (see Aim 1; we expect children receiving probiotic intervention will demonstrate less AAD than those receiving the control product), we still used a two-tailed alternative for estimating the sample size in order to be conservative. While multiple efforts are arranged to minimize loss of data, in order to obtain the primary outcome (diarrhea or no diarrhea), there still will be some participants lost to follow-up and the endpoint is unknown. Nonetheless, if the lost to follow-up rate is as high as 10% (then N=270, approximately 135 per group), power would still be 90% for detecting the difference of 0.14 and 80% for detecting a difference of 0.12.  11.3 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN FOR PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES  Initially, descriptive statistics (means, medians, frequency distributions, standard deviations, boxplots, etc.) for all characteristics will be examined for each group. Either parametric or nonparametric statistical (depending on results from the descriptive statistics) tests will be used for comparing results of the randomization.  Because recruitment will take place over a long period (projected 3.5 years), descriptive statistics will further be examined in 4-6 month intervals (depending on the frequency of enrollments). This is to check that there are no patterns or differences in the subject characteristics over the enrollment time period. As the trial progresses, these characteristics will be continuously monitored and compared, so at that moment if there are differences in the distributions over time, the study team and the Data Safety Monitoring Board can convene to discuss. Additionally potential covariates, such as, age at entry, sex, weight of subject, time of year, etc., will also be statistically examined using univariate statistical tests.    For testing the primary objective (Aim 1), i.e., comparing the rates of AAD between the BB-12 and control groups, Fisher’s Exact Probability test will be used. The relative risk of AAD for BB-

July 28, 2021 Page 48 of 65 Version 1.7 12 versus control and the 95% confidence interval will be calculated to display magnitude of the relationship. If the rates of AAD need to be adjusted for covariates, then multiple logistic regression models will be employed for predicting the adjusted rates of AAD. Covariates will be examined for multi-collinearity so as not to saturate the multiple logistic regression models constructed. With this large number of subjects enrolled, it is not expected that the number of AAD cases will be small enough to warrant further statistical methods. However, if the number of AAD cases is very small then exact statistical testing methods will be exclusively used for making the comparisons and performing any pertinent subgroup analyses. The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory™ (PedsQL™) has a validated and easy scoring system.[104, 105]  For Aim 2, numerous exploratory techniques (i.e., all descriptive statistics previously mentioned) will be performed to verify that the probiotic is safe and well tolerated. Additionally, the AEs will be collected and studied over time of enrollment. The rates of AEs will be estimated, 95% confidence interval be constructed for describing precision and statistically compared between groups. This will be accomplished using parametric or nonparametric tests. Further, in order to accurately identify patient populations or subgroups that can benefit from the BB-[ADDRESS_787531] to AEs. This is related to an area known as “unsupervised” modeling in data mining, but is appropriate in this Phase II trial for finding subgroups of subjects that have plausible similarities and also differences.  Statistical analysis will be performed using the intention to treat principle; all subjects enrolled and randomized will be accounted for in the final analysis in their randomized group. One interim analysis will be performed when approximately 50% of the subjects have been recruited. While the alpha for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_596409] 0.01, it is unlikely that we would want to stop this trial at that point even if significance is achieved, but the Data Safety Monitoring Board, PI [INVESTIGATOR_596410]. For Aim 1, the level of significance for the primary objective will be tested at alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_787532] the samples using protocols from the Fraser laboratory and be provided with written, illustrated instructions. The research staff will review these instructions with the caregivers during enrollment (Appendix, IND protocol). Immediately after collection and freezing, a member of the research team will be alerted to retrieve the samples and transport them to the laboratory. The stool will be stored at -40°C until transport to the University of Maryland. All research staff will receive certification on handling procedures.  Stool samples will be thawed on ice to remove representative 1 gram samples for DNA and RNA extraction as previously described.[109] These methods provide high quality nucleic acids for microbiome analysis on the Illumina sequencing platforms (see below).  11.4.2 Microbiome Community Profiling  16S rRNA gene amplification, sequencing and raw 16S rRNA data processing: The gut microbiota will be characterized by [CONTACT_596457] 16S rRNA gene amplicons from stool samples. A region of ~469 bp encompassing the 16S V3-V4 hypervariable regions[110-113] will 
Efficacy and Safety of BB-12 Yogurt July 28, 2021 
July 28, 2021 Page 49 of 65 Version 1.7 be targeted for sequencing using MiSeq’s 300 bp paired-end sequencing reads and the two universal PCR primers 319F and 806R,[114] according to procedures previously published at The Institute for Genome Sciences (IGS) at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.[115, 116] Barcoding[114] will be used to multiplex >400 samples per MiSeq run, which will provide a sampling depth (~20,000 read pairs) sufficient to characterize the microbiota with high resolution. Raw 16S rRNA reads will be processed using published protocols.[114, 117, 118] Within- (alpha-diversity) and between- (beta-diversity) sample comparisons will then be performed using QIIME.[119] Enterotype classification will be carried out using the methods of Arumugan[120], as modified by [CONTACT_596458].  Microbiota will be compared cross-sectionally and longitudinally, using parameters such as diversity and evenness (Shannon, Simpson index), and similarity (phylogenetic UniFrac distance, Jensen-Shannon divergence), determined using standard tools, such as Mothur,[121] QIIME,[119] and statistical R package (www.r-project.org). In addition, statistically significant correlations between specific microbiota members and post-BB-[ADDRESS_787533] clusters, and clinical outcomes will be determined using bioinformatics tools, such as eLSA,[122] Metastats,[123] and LEfSe.[124] Since there is no universal standard for such correlations, we will use all existing statistical tools developed to analyze 16S rRNA gene datasets. We will incorporate in our analysis any new statistical tool developed during the course of the study by [CONTACT_596459]. The 16S dataset will also be used to simulate microbiota functional compositions using Pi[INVESTIGATOR_226645],[125] which uses available genome sequence data to infer functional gene contents based on the 16S rRNA microbiota compositions. This method will provide an alternative access to functional microbiota characterizations.  11.4.3 Anticipated Results and Interpretation  The experiments described in this aim will provide us with sequential samples from which data on both microbial composition (based of 16S rRNA profiling) and community function (based on RNASeq data) can be generated. We anticipate that longitudinal 16S rRNA profiling will provide insight into a number of distinct shifts in the microbiota (i.e., loss of particular taxa, loss of overall community diversity) that reflect the impact of antibiotics (control group) and antibiotics plus BB-12 (active yogurt group).   The impact of antibiotic treatment on the microbiota: In this clinical trial, all participants will be treated with a 7-10-day course of antibiotics beginning on day 1, and will be followed for another 20-23 days following cessation of antibiotic therapy. We will assess changes in the microbiota at five time points over this 30-day period. This study design will provide us an opportunity to capture information on antibiotic-induced changes in the microbiota, as well as monitor the recovery of the microbiota in 300 participants. We anticipate that a subset of participants will develop diarrhea, and we will generate data on microbiota changes during the progression from the diarrheal state to the non-diarrheal state. This will allow us to ask if changes in the relative abundance of specific members of the gut microbiota (either alone or in combination) correlate with clinical outcome.  To our knowledge, there have been no studies that examine the microbiota during the progression to a diarrheal state and the resolution of the diarrheal state. There have been limited studies on the treatment with antibiotics,[47, 126] but not in the context of disease resolution, nor in a pediatric population. We anticipate these findings will be novel and provide insight into the dynamics of the human gastrointestinal tract.  We will also use the baseline16S rRNA data to identify gut enterotypes in the [ADDRESS_787534] the hypothesis that specific enterotypes are more/less resistant to development of antibiotic-induced diarrhea and more/less likely to show complete recovery of community structure following antibiotic 
Efficacy and Safety of BB-[ADDRESS_787535] of BB-12-supplemented yogurt on the microbiota: In addition to the observation of antibiotic-induced changes in the gut microbiota, we will also be able to examine the impact of concomitant administration of BB-12-supplemented yogurt over time in half of the participants. We will specifically look for differences between the control and active yogurt groups with regard to the degree of antibiotic-induced disturbance of the microbiota (i.e., loss of particular taxa, loss of overall community diversity) as well as the extent and time course of recovery of the microbiota following cessation of antibiotic therapy. It has been suggested that probiotics help to speed the recovery of the microbiota following antibiotic administration,[127] and this clinical trial will generate a significant amount of data to help to support or refute that assertion.     11.4.4 Metatranscriptomics  16S rRNA amplicon sequencing will provide an inventory of community members in the gut microbiota, whereas metatranscriptomics will provide an actual snapshot of the expressed genes -- moving the studies from descriptive to mechanistic. RNA will be isolated from the baseline and day 7 samples (funding limitations preclude metatranscriptome analysis of all samples; however, frozen samples will be available for future gene expression profiling studies if deemed to be of interest). We have budgeted for [ADDRESS_787536] and bacterial rRNA depletion, mRNA amplification, library preparation and metatranscriptomic sequencing: Total RNA will be extracted from stools using an acid-phenol protocol, as described in Eloe-Fadrosh et al.[109] rRNA removal will be accomplished using the RiboZero Bacterial and Human rRNA Removal Kits, which consistently remove ~99% of all rRNA as estimated by [CONTACT_596460] (SSU and LSU). The purified and rRNA-reduced RNA will be used to create indexed sequencing libraries to be multiplexed for sequencing. Analyses of the metatranscriptomic data will include mappi[INVESTIGATOR_596411]. We will use Bowtie to map sequence reads to our growing database of reference genome sequences that currently includes 1,482 and 1,941 non-redundant isolates.   Annotation and metabolic reconstructions: Reads that map to reference genomes will be converted into contigs on which the reference genome annotations will be transferred, and subsequently used for metabolic reconstruction using the Pathway Tools package developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Peter Karp for the semi-automated prediction of metabolic pathways and full pathways visualization via web browser. In addition, HUMAnN2 (HMP Unified Metabolic Analysis Network)[128] will be used for accurate determination of presence/absence of microbial pathways, in the form of abundance tables summarizing gene families and metabolic pathways present in a given microbial community. This facilitates the analysis of a collection of metatranscriptomes as a matrix of gene/pathway abundances, similar to a collection of microarrays. Differential gene expression analysis will be carried out, as described in Eloe-Fadrosh et al.[109]  11.4.[ADDRESS_787537] reconstruction for the community: The metatranscriptomic studies will provide information about the gene expression profiles of all members of the microbiota as well as the in vivo expression profile for the probiotic, BB-12. Together, these data 
Efficacy and Safety of BB-12 Yogurt July 28, 2021 
July 28, 2021 Page 51 of 65 Version 1.7 will provide insight into (i) which organisms are metabolically active in the presence of antibiotic with and without BB-12; and (ii), whether the gene expression profile of BB-12 is similar in all patients. We anticipate that we will identify different transcriptional profiles that are associated with (i) administration of antibiotic alone or (ii) the concomitant administration of antibiotics and yogurt in subjects that either develop AAD or do not. What is not known is whether these transcriptional programs will differ depending on clinical outcome and/or the starting composition of the microbiota and/or the ingestion of BB-12. It is possible that each gut enterotype will exhibit a differential response to BB-12, in terms of changes in community composition, and/or gene expression. Such a finding will be of value in understanding the parameters that identify those subjects most likely to respond to probiotic intervention.     Antibiotic resistance gene expression profiles: With the increase in prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens and in environmental samples, investigators at IGS have developed bioinformatics pi[INVESTIGATOR_596412]/metatranscriptomic samples. The current iteration of the analysis pi[INVESTIGATOR_596413] a total of 121 reference markers (representing 357 allelic variants) in the proposed reference database, based either on the screening of previously published literature or based on our own ongoing work in this field. Therefore, we have the ability to identify antibiotic-induced increases in resistance gene expression in the metatranscriptomics dataset and we will include this information as part of the analysis. Collectively, the work to be carried out as part of Aim [ADDRESS_787538] description of metatranscriptome changes in association with concomitant antibiotic and probiotic administration to date.    11.4.6 Integration of Data  We will use MDI – a Bayesian method for unsupervised integration of multiple datasets – to look for correlations between clinical outcomes, 16S rRNA and gene expression data.[129] Each dataset will be modeled using a Dirichelet-multinomial allocation mixture model, with dependencies between models captured via parameters that describe agreement between the datasets.

Georgetown University’s IRB operates under the appropriate Federal Regulations, and the PI, all co-investigators and research assistants have taken required classes on human subject research, ethics and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  This research will be conducted at Georgetown University and Pennsylvania State University. The initial production of the yogurt will be under the supervision of Pennsylvania State University. Pennsylvania State University has already granted permission to conduct sensory analysis tests of the yogurt.   The responsible official at the Georgetown University’s IRB will sign the IRB letter of approval of the protocol prior to the start of this trial.  Any amendments to the protocol will be submitted to the IRB and approval obtained prior to implementation.   12.3 Informed Consent Process  Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the parent/caregiver’s agreeing to have their child participate in the study and continuing throughout the study participation. Extensive discussion of risks and possible benefits of this therapy will be provided to the parents/caregivers. Consent forms describing in detail the study interventions/products, study procedures, and risks are given to the parents/caregivers and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to starting intervention/administering study product.  After screening the participants, research personnel will meet with the parent/caregiver and administer the informed consent process. Signatures on hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_596414].   When the enrollment/baseline visit is completed virtually, the informed consent process will be completed via voice call or Zoom video conference, either with e-signatures obtained through the Georgetown-licensed version of DocuSign or with hard copy signatures obtained. When hard copy signatures are obtained following a virtual enrollment/baseline visit, hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_596415] (in mailboxes and through mail slots, for example), such that participants can sign and return the documents without direct interaction with study staff.   To verify their identity and the identity of the participant before beginning the virtual consent process, parents/guardians will be asked to confirm their names, participants’ names, and where they heard about the study/who referred them. Parents/guardians of prospective participants will be asked to confirm that they are comfortable discussing protected health

Those with access to Zoom will be offered the option of completing the informed consent process via video conference, during which copi[INVESTIGATOR_596416] (ICF, HIPAA, and assent where applicable) would be shared via the screensharing feature. Those without Zoom access or who prefer voice call will be emailed copi[INVESTIGATOR_596416].  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_5972], initial and sign each consent form after it is signed by [CONTACT_7071]. If appropriate, an assent process may be done with older children (see Section 7.5 for details).    12.4 Inclusion of Females and Minorities  All children in reasonably good health except for their respi[INVESTIGATOR_596417] 3 and 12 years who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, regardless of religion, sex, or ethnic background will be enrolled if their parents/caregivers sign the informed consent. Recruitment will also be done in Spanish and all forms translated.   Based on rates of patients seen in our network, we anticipate about 50% of the potential participants will be female. Many of our practices are based in the inner-city and have an over-representation of ethnic minorities.   12.[ADDRESS_787541] by [CONTACT_093], their staff, and the sponsor(s) and their agents. This confidentiality is extended to cover testing of biological samples in addition to the clinical information relating to participating subjects.  The study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in strict confidence. No information concerning the study or the data will be released to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the sponsor.  The FDA, study monitor or other authorized representatives of the sponsor may inspect all documents and records required to be maintained by [CONTACT_093]. The clinical study site will permit access to such records.   
Efficacy and Safety of BB-[ADDRESS_787542] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_596418], completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported. All source documents are to be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of data. Changes or corrections will be made by [CONTACT_596462] a single line, and initialing and dating the change.  13.1 Data Management Responsibilities  Data Coordination will be provided by [CONTACT_596463].   The following data collection forms will be double-entered into the database: Adverse Event Report Form (AE) Baseline Health Status (BH) Daily Assessment Diary (DD) Demographic Information Form (DI) Follow-up Form (FU) Inclusion/Exclusion Form (IE) Randomization Form (RZ) Serious Adverse Event Report Form (SA)  The following data collection forms will be single-entered into the database: Day 180 Follow-up Form (OF) Diarrhea Report Form (DR) Diarrhea Follow-up Form (DF) Diet Recall Diary (DT) Informed Consent Process Documentation (IP) Missed Contact [CONTACT_596464] (MC) PedsQL (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory) (PQ) Sample Collection Form (SC) Withdrawal from Intervention Form (WI) Yogurt Consumption Follow Up (YC)  All of these forms will be used as source documents for the study. There are [ADDRESS_787543] revision number 1, i.e. the Adverse Event form is referred to as AE1.  The databases will be created using REDCap [130]. All data and forms entered will be automatically validated upon entry into REDCap (range, type, and branching logic). Using the Double Data Entry Module, the data entry system is designed for independent double data entry—where the eight specified forms would be entered twice by [CONTACT_596465].  This method of data entry helps to ensure data quality and accuracy.  The data coordinator will provide two separate entry records and therefore two separate databases per Study ID:  Database [ADDRESS_787544] of any existing differences.  The Research Personnel will then be responsible for resolving the differences (for example, by [CONTACT_596466]) and making the necessary changes in the database.  In case of an unresolved discrepancy between the two databases, Database [ADDRESS_787545] databases.  The data system is designed to allow multiple users at a time, but the RA designated as Person #1 may only use Database 1 while the RA designated as Person #2 may only use Database 2. These 2 users will not be able to view or enter the same database at the same time.   The data entry system is designed to allow all information contained on a single form to be entered in a single keying session.  It is always recommended to enter any one form in its entirety rather than breaking up a single form into multiple keying sessions.  The data collection forms were also designed for keying directly into the data entry system without the need for additional transcription.   The data entry system has some built-in checks to ensure data accuracy as the RA is keying in data.  These include range, format, arithmetic, and branching logic checks.  However, there may be instances in which the RA finds that s/he repeatedly needs to enter values that are not allowed by [CONTACT_184290]-in checks of the data system.  If this situation arises, the data coordinator should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], and the data entry system may be changed if needed.    Always enter the data recorded on the forms, even if known to be wrong.  Refer to the “special characters” section of the data entry system manual in the MOP for information on how to deal with suspect data.  In addition, changes to records in the study database should never be made unless the changes have been made on the hard copy form.  When making changes to data on the hard copy form, draw a single line through the old data, write in the new data, then initial and date the edit.  The documentation should be sufficient to allow one to reconstruct the sequence of events leading to the change, starting with the original value.  All users will be assigned User IDs and passwords in order to gain entry to the data system. Every time the RA uses the “add a form” or data entry function, the system will automatically log and timestamp the entry.  This is in order to track which forms were entered by [CONTACT_596467], and also in order to ensure that the independent double data entry is being conducted properly.  RAs must be careful to enter their own Staff ID, not the Staff ID corresponding to the RA who filled out the form being entered.  13.[ADDRESS_787546], unless the funder specifically requests otherwise.  13.4 Protocol Deviations  A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol or Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements. The noncompliance may be either on the part of the subject, the investigator, or the study personnel. As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by [CONTACT_3483]. It is the responsibility of the study personnel to use continuous vigilance to identify protocol deviations.  All deviations from the protocol must be addressed in study subject source documents.  Protocol deviations must be sent to the local IRB per their guidelines. The PI/study personnel is responsible for knowing and adhering to their IRB requirements.

Efficacy and Safety of BB-[ADDRESS_787552]: The Impact of Socioeconomic Status on Clinical Trial Protocol Adherence. A Probiotic Randomized Controlled Study in Preventing Antibiotic Associated Diarrhea.   This project uses existing participant data in the PLAY ON study that participants have already agreed to release for research purposes. This will be a substudy of the PLAY ON study to allow us to better understand compliance. The aim of the project is to look at participant compliance with different aspects of the study protocol. Specifically, participant compliance is being studied in relation to socioeconomic status.   Participant’s answers regarding how many doses of yogurt they consumed, date they completed their follow ups, date they collected samples, and presence of diet as well as daily diaries will be reviewed. In addition, the number of antibiotic doses completed will be examined. Using the data collected, a compliance scoring system will be generated. An average compliance score of participants in each category, indicating their level of compliance, will be calculated and looked at within differing socioeconomic brackets. We hope this information will allow us and other research groups suggestions on improving compliance.

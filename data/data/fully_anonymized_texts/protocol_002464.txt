[INVESTIGATOR_893074] a  research study. Research  studies are designed  to gain scientific  
knowledge that  may help other  people in the future. You  are being asked to  take part in this 
study because you weigh  more than is ideal and  you may be at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_303729]. Your 
participation is voluntary.  Please take your  time in making  your  decision  as to  whether or not 
you wish to  participate.  Ask your doctor  or the study staff to explain any words or information 
contained in this informed consent  document that you do not  understand. You  may also discuss 
the study with your friends  and family.
WHY I S THIS STUDY BEING DONE?
The Healthy Living Partnerships to Prevent Diabetes  in Veterans, or HELP PD Vets pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], 
will test two strategies to prevent the  development  of diabetes  in Veterans who  are overweight 
and at risk.  Previous studies have  shown that weight loss  has many benefits,  including  
preventing diabetes. Most of these  studies  have been  conducted in strictly research  settings using  
professional staff like dietitians and  doctors working one-on-one with  participants.   We don’t  
know if  a group-based program led by a lay (non-professional) person  and delivered in a  real 
healthcare setting like the  VA would also  help people lose weight. 
HOW M ANY  PEOPLE WILL TAKE P ART IN THE STUDY?
Fifty (50) people from  the Kernersville Health Care Center will take part in this study. In order to 
identify the 50 participants needed, we may need  to screen  as many  as 200 because some  people  
will not qualify  to be  included in the study.
WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE STUDY ?
The HELP PD Vets  pi[INVESTIGATOR_893075].  You will be randomized 
into one of  the groups described below. Randomization means that you are put  into a group by 
[CONTACT_3364]. It  is like  flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  a coin. You will have an equal chance of being placed  in either group.  
Group A will be  involved  in a weight loss program that combines  individual meetings with a  
registered dietitian with group sessions led by a trained member of the community known as  a 
community health  worker. Group B will receive two individual sessions  with a registered  
dietitian and written information  about  resources for weight loss  and healthy  living in  the local 
area.   Both groups  will receive the same medical monitoring.

If you decide to participate, you will also complete  a baseline visit and  a 6-month visit.  Both of 
these visits will be  conducted in the Kernersville Health Care Center. During these visits, we will 
measure or collect:

Risks of Increasing Physical Activity:  Increasing  your  physical activity may increase your risk 
of injuries  to the muscles, ligaments, tendons and  joints of the body.  Other risks include  
abnormal blood pressure, fainting,  dizziness, disorders of heart rhythm, and very  rare instances 
of heart attack, stroke, or even  death.   To help ensure your safety, the study will check your  
readiness to become more active.  A study  doctor  will see you if  your readiness  is in doubt.   
Risks of Hypotension (Low Blood Pressure):   If you do lose  weight  while you take  medicines to  
control your blood pressure, there is a chance  you may have epi[INVESTIGATOR_893076]-headed, 
dizzy or  nauseous from a  drop in blood pressure.   Low blood pressure is also known as 
hypotension.  To reduce the chance  of hypotension, please report any feelings  dizziness, nausea, 
or light-headedness to study staff.   If you develop  low blood  pressure, the study doctors will 
contact [CONTACT_893080]. 
Taking part  in this research study may involve  providing information that  you consider 
confidential or private.  Efforts, such  as coding research records, keepi[INVESTIGATOR_893077], will be  made to  keep 
your information safe.
REPRODUCTIVE R ISKS TO  PARTICIPATING IN  RESEARCH
Due to unknown  risks  and potential  harm to the unborn fetus, sexually active  women of 
childbearing potential must use a reliable method  of birth  control while participating in this  
study. Reliable  methods of birth control are: abstinence (not having sex), oral contraceptives, 
intrauterine device (IUD), DepoProvera, tubal ligation, or vasectomy  of the partner (with  
confirmed negative sperm counts) in a monogamous relationship (same  partner). An  acceptable, 
although less reliable,  method involves the careful use of condoms  and spermicidal  foam or gel 
and/or a cervical  cap or sponge. We  encourage  you to  discuss this issue further  with your 
physicians if  you have any questions.
Pregnant women  are excluded from participation  in this study. If you are a sexually  active 
woman of childbearing  potential and have  not been using a reliable  method of birth control, two 
negative pregnancy tests performed 15 days apart  are required to  check for possible early 
pregnancy prior  to starting treatment.
ARE THERE B ENEFITS  TO TAKING PART IN THE STUDY ?
If you agree  to take part in this study, there may or may not  be direct benefit to  you. We hope the 
information learned from this study will benefit  other people in the future. The  benefits  of 
participating in  this study may include losing  weight,  a decrease in  your risk for  developi[INVESTIGATOR_893078],  and improvements in your  quality of life.   
WHAT OTHER CHOICES  ARE THERE?
This is  not a treatment  study. Your alternative is to not participate in this  study.

shedding, peak nasal wash viral titer, and mean sum of daily 
viral titers after challenge.
2. Calculate the number of subjects with mild to moderate 
upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4347], based on study 
definition of RSV illness.
3. Determine the number of days RSV illness persists after 
challenge and degree of illness based on study definition.
4. Correlate the magnitude and duration of viral shedding 
with the severity and duration of RSV-related symptoms.
5. Determine the frequency, magnitude, and duration of 
serum and mucosal (nasal wash and/or nasosorption) RSV-
specific antibody responses after challenge.

Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4345] (RSV) is the leading cause of pediatric lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_4348]. RSV also causes lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_4349]-
threatening disease in immunocompromised hosts. An RSV monoclonal antibody 
(palivizumab) is currently available for passive immunoprophylaxis in high-risk infants. 
Vaccines and antiviral agents are under development for the treatment and prevention 
of RSV, but none are licensed. The ability to challenge healthy volunteers with RSV 
could rapi[INVESTIGATOR_4350]. In addition, 
challenge studies would provide critical information on viral pathogenesis, including 
types of cells infected, mucosal and systemic immune response, and alterations in 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_4351]. Clinical trial material for human challenge studies has been 
prepared from live recombinant (complementary DNA-derived) RSV of subgroup A 
(RSV A2).
This study will be a phase [ADDRESS_4049] within each subgroup. RSV 
subgroups can shift in predominance in 1- or 2-year cycles, which presumably is an 
advantage for heterologous strains in populations with prior immunity; however, 
reinfections by [CONTACT_4466]. RSV is spread by [CONTACT_4467]-contaminated large droplets or fomites. The 
incubation period is about 4 to 5 days (range 2 to 8 days). The virus initially replicates in 
the nasopharynx and frequently spreads to the lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352], especially in 
primary infection. Viral shedding from the respi[INVESTIGATOR_4353] [ADDRESS_4050] disease in the pediatric 
population worldwide. Approximately 50%-70% of infants are infected with RSV during 
the first year of life, and nearly all children have been infected by [CONTACT_654] 2-3 years.1 In the 
U.S., the National Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4354] (NREVSS) of the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) monitors the seasonal occurrence of 
RSV. From 2012 to 2014, RSV was associated with an estimated 57,527 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4355] 2.1 million outpatient visits among children < 5 years of age.2 
Worldwide, in children < [ADDRESS_4051] few years of life.4 
RSV is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Among adults > 65 
years of age, RSV accounts for approximately 10,000 deaths annually in the U.S.5 RSV 
also causes wintertime respi[INVESTIGATOR_4356]-term care 
or attending daycare, with infection rates of 5%-10% in nursing home residents per 
year, complicated by [CONTACT_4468] 10%-20% and 2%-5%, 
respectively.6 In temperate climates, seasonal outbreaks begin in the fall and continue 
through winter and spring (November to April). There is presently no known viral 
reservoir.

immune systems. 
An RSV monoclonal antibody (palivizumab) was licensed in June 1998 by [CONTACT_4469] (FDA) for passive immunoprophylaxis in high-risk infants. Vaccines 
and antiviral agents are under development for the treatment and prevention of RSV, 
but none are licensed. There have been a number of obstacles to developi[INVESTIGATOR_4359].[ADDRESS_4055] reinfection is believed to be due to: (a) cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which likely 
contribute a short-term protection against reinfection during the same season; (b) local 
secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies, which appear to play the most important 
role in short-term and long-term protection; and (c) serum antibodies, which confer 
durable protection that ameliorates severity but incompletely prevents reinfection. 1
Data from this and future RSV challenge studies will enhance our understanding of the 
immune response to RSV infection and facilitate efficacy trials for RSV antiviral and 
vaccine candidates, thereby [CONTACT_4470]. 
1.1.1 Description of the Study Agent/Intervention
The RSV sequence on which the study agent, RSV A2, is based was derived from RSV 
strain A2, initially isolated from a child in Melbourne, Australia, in 1961.7 RSV strain A2 
was isolated using human embryonic kidney cells (HEKs). The study agent of this IND 
is a recombinant version of RSV A2 that was derived de novo from synthetic 
complementary DNA (cDNA).[ADDRESS_4056] been present at the time of virus isolation and has a short, well-defined 
passage history. The sequence of the clinical trial material (CTM), RSV A2, corresponds 
to the sequence of the original isolate, passaged seven times in HEK cells, except for 
13 nucleotide differences.9 Eleven of these nucleotide differences are silent on the 
amino acid level and considered to be phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_4360]. Specifically, 4 of 
the changes involve nucleotide differences which are considered incidental (C6221T; 
T6386C; T10514G; T13900C). Six nucleotide differences were introduced deliberately 
to generate marker restriction sites in noncoding regions of the genome (insertion of a C 
residue [C1099.1], A1138C, G1139C, A5611G, A5615T, A7559C). Another change 
involves a C4G substitution that was introduced deliberately near the beginning of the 
genome because it improves recovery from cDNA but appears to have no effect on 
virus replication or gene expression. In addition to these 11 non-coding changes, there 
are 2 nucleotide substitutions that result in amino acid changes in the F protein (E66K 
and P101Q). These changes modestly increase replication in cell culture (and appear to 
represent an adaptation to cell culture).
RSV Challenge Study II
Protocol Version 9.[ADDRESS_4057]. RSV A2 caused 
moderate rhinorrhea and cough in chimpanzees, similar to biologically derived RSV A2 
(Table 1 10 and Table 2 9). RSV A2 induced high serum neutralizing titers to RSV ( Table 
2 9). These results showed that RSV A2 had an in vivo phenotype similar to that of 
biologically derived RSV A2.

The RSV A2 CTM and an experimental RSV A2 virus derived from the same cDNA as 
the CTM were also characterized in nonhuman primates studies of RSV vaccine 
candidates in RSV-seronegative African Green Monkeys (AGMs). AGMs (n = 4) were 
dosed by [CONTACT_4474] a dose of 2 × 106 PFU (equivalent to 
106.3 PFU). Serum was obtained on days 0, 21, and [ADDRESS_4058]-immunization to determine 
the neutralizing antibody response. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were collected daily on 
days [ADDRESS_4059] ranged from 3.9 to 5.4 log 10 PFU/ml, and 
shedding from the lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_4361] 3.0 to 5.5 log 10 PFU/ml. 
Compared to the attenuated RSV vaccine strains, RSV A2 replicated to higher titers in 
nonhuman primates. RSV A2 was immunogenic, inducing serum neutralizing antibody 
titers of 6.7-[ADDRESS_4060] been reported in the literature, dating back to 1961.12-18;20-12;23-25 Experimental 
infection of healthy adult volunteers (with low pre-challenge RSV titers) using RSV 
strains A and B in the dose range of 3.7-5.[ADDRESS_4061] resulted in 70%-92% viral 
shedding from the upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352]. When reported, nasal, sinus, and ear 
symptoms were noted in 38%-70% of people with evidence of viral shedding. The 
experimental RSV challenge model produces a phenotype of respi[INVESTIGATOR_4362]. In 
[ADDRESS_4062] frequently reported 
symptoms involved the nose, ear, throat, and sinus, and 85% of subjects also reported 
cough.[ADDRESS_4063] (PFT) abnormalities, suppression of neutrophils and platelets, 
and liver enzyme elevations. Headache was the most commonly reported systemic 
complaint. In detail, the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was abnormal in 2 of 12 
subjects receiving a 104.7-PFU dose of RSV A2.13 The ALT level normalized by [CONTACT_4475] 28. 
AEs also occurred in subjects receiving a 104-PFU dose of RSV A.20 The subjects in 
this challenge study had minor PFT abnormalities (5/53), and mild lab abnormalities 
with elevated ALT level (5/53), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level (8/53), 
reduced absolute neutrophil count (ANC) (3/53), and reduced platelets (1/53). Fever 
was not reported in any prior challenge subjects (several studies allowed for 
acetaminophen treatment). Overall, prior challenge studies with RSV have revealed that 
participants acquire an upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4363]. 
Importantly, no significant AEs related to challenge infection with RSV have been 
reported.
We previously conducted a phase 1 challenge study with RSVA2 in healthy volunteers 
18-50 years of age (NIH protocol number 15-I-0148; Clinical Trials Identifier 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Cumulatively, we challenged 25 volunteers. Three volunteers in cohort 
1 and 10 in cohort 2 were challenged with the low dose of RSV A2 (105 PFU) using 
intranasal droplets. Five volunteers in cohort 3a and 7 in cohort 3b were challenged with 
a higher dose of RSV A2 (106.3 PFU) using intranasal droplets. Seven of 13 participants 
in low dose cohorts 1 and 2 had RSV shedding detected by [CONTACT_937]-PCR or culture of nasal 
wash on any day, day 2 or beyond, after challenge infection with RSV A2, resulting in a

Page 18 of 87shedding frequency of 54%. We observed a total of [ADDRESS_4064] infection (URI) events (1 moderate illness and 2 mild illnesses), as determined by 
[CONTACT_4476]. Hence, the frequency of mild to moderate respi[INVESTIGATOR_4364] 23%. Our third cohort of healthy volunteers that 
received the high dose of RSV A2 (106.3 PFU) was admitted to the Special Clinical 
Studies Unit (SCSU) in two separate groups: cohort 3a + cohort 3b. Three of 11 
evaluable participants in the entire cohort 3 had RSV shedding detected in nasal wash 
by [CONTACT_4477]/or RT-PCR for a shedding frequency of 27%. Only 2 of the 3 participants 
had respi[INVESTIGATOR_4365], resulting in an illness frequency of 18%. The most common expected AEs 
related to RSV illness were nasal congestion/rhinorrhea (50%), headache (42%), sore 
throat (29%), cough (25%), and sinus congestion/pain (17%). The majority of symptoms 
were of mild-moderate severity (Grade 1 or 2), except for 1 epi[INVESTIGATOR_4366] 3. Unexpected AEs consisted of other symptoms that may occur with an 
URI, such as sneezing (32%), nausea (24%), itchy or irritated throat (16% each), watery 
eyes (20%), and decreased appetite (16%) that were of mild (Grade 1) severity. Five 
participants had epi[INVESTIGATOR_4367] (16%) of Grade 2 or 3 severity that were possibly, 
probably or unlikely related to the nasal wash, nasal swab, or RSV infection. No serious 
AEs (SAEs) occurred during the entire study. Per the study design, since the RSV 
illness criteria were not met for the high dose cohort (>3 subjects/10-12 volunteers), 
additional subjects were not dosed with the high dose. We concluded that challenge 
infection with 105 PFU and 106.3 PFU RSV A2 appears to be safe in healthy volunteers. 
Disease manifestations were limited in healthy adults because of pre-existing immunity. 
The participants with RSV shedding in nasal wash had a significantly lower pre-dose 
mean neutralizing antibody titer compared to participants with no shedding detected 
(mean neutralizing antibody titer, 6.7 reciprocal log 2 versus 8.3 reciprocal log 2, 
P=0.0011). The same applied to RSV illness: Participants with RSV illness had a 
significantly lower pre-dose mean neutralizing antibody titer compared to participants 
without RSV illness [6.3 reciprocal log 2 (log (2)) versus 8.0 log (2) , P=0.0041]. The pre-
dose mean serum F protein IgG was not significantly different in patients with or without 
RSV shedding or illness. 
The rationale for selecting [ADDRESS_4065] RSV challenge 
study (NIH protocol number 15-I-0148) was based on existing safety data from prior 
human and non-human primate challenge studies. Buchman and colleagues challenged 
32 healthy volunteers with a 106-PFU dose of RSV B without reporting safety issues; 
RSV Challenge Study II
Protocol Version 9.[ADDRESS_4066] RSV challenge dose is 105.4 PFU of RSV A Memphis strain. The 
35 healthy adults receiving this dose had RSV neutralization titers in the lower tertile of 
the population and the study finished without safety complications. Also in pre-clinical 
studies, no substantial AEs were seen in non-human primates challenged with RSV A2 
at doses of 104 PFU (chimpanzees) or 106.3 PFU (AGMs) (unpublished data 
Buchholz).10,11 
Two prior human adult challenge infection studies specifically using RSV A2 were 
conducted using doses of 103 PFU or 104.7 PFU.13,14 In the study by [CONTACT_4478], 3 of 9 subjects (33%) developed symptomatic upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4368] 103 PFU.14 
In the study by [CONTACT_4479] a higher dose (104.7 PFU ), 12 of 13 subjects 
(92%) with low serum neutralizing antibody activity shed RSV A2 after challenge.13 Of 
these subjects, 92% displayed upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4369]. This study provides evidence that development of RSV-induced 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_4370]-inoculation serum anti-RSV antibody titers without 
complications of lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_4371]. Please refer to Appendix D for a 
summary table of completed RSV challenge studies. 
We also selected a dose of 106.[ADDRESS_4067] RSV challenge study, which is higher 
than the previously reported 106 PFU dose used in human challenge.21 Safety was 
acceptable for the 106.3 PFU dose of RSV A2 CTM in non-human primate toxicity 
studies (unpublished data, Buchholz). Since RSV A2 CTM is a recombinant virus 
passaged through Vero cells, there is theoretical concern that human infectivity may be 
reduced.[ADDRESS_4068] low pre-challenge RSV-
specific neutralizing antibody titers with recombinant RSV A2 using a nasal atomizer 
(MAD Nasal Atomizer, Teleflex). This atomizer has been used safely and successfully

Protocol Version 9.[ADDRESS_4069] 
challenge study. No AEs related to the MAD Nasal Atomizer occurred during the 
influenza virus challenge studies performed at the NIH Clinical Center ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).
 As noted above, our first challenge study resulted in an overall shedding frequency of 
42%, and frequency was higher in the cohorts that received the lower dose, 105 PFU, of 
RSV A2 (54%) versus the cohort that received the higher dose, 106.3 PFU (27%). The 
overall frequency of RSV illness for all cohorts was only 21%-23% for the low dose 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_842] 18% for the high dose participants. Our goal is to increase the number of 
participants who shed RSV in nasal wash (RSV shedding is defined as RSV detected in 
NP wash by [CONTACT_4480]/or viral culture on [ADDRESS_4070]-challenge or 
later)  or meet the RSV illness study definition (Section 3.1.2) so that our challenge 
model can be utilized to test antivirals and possibly vaccines in future studies. Our 
hypothesis is that including an RSV neutralizing antibody titer cut-off in the eligibility 
criteria for our study participants and administering a higher dose of RSV A2 using a 
nasal atomizer to provide a larger surface for infection will result in a higher incidence of 
RSV shedding and a higher frequency of RSV illness after challenge.
RSV Challenge Study II
Protocol Version 9.0

Page 21 of 871.2 Rationale
This RSV challenge model addresses several unmet scientific and medical needs: 1) to 
provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of and immunity to RSV infection in 
humans, 2) to expedite efficacy trials of new RSV therapeutics and possibly vaccines, 
and 3) to characterize the nasal microbiota in healthy adults before and after infection 
with RSV. 
The common goals within the RSV research community are to ultimately reduce 
morbidity and mortality from RSV infection in vulnerable hosts (infants, elderly, immune 
compromised, and people with chronic cardiopulmonary diseases). In vitro models for 
RSV are well established. However, development of targeted RSV therapi[INVESTIGATOR_4372]’ potential for efficacy and toxicity are better studied in vivo in humans. 
Human, healthy volunteer challenge models offer the ability to generate high quality 
data, minimize confounding variables, and study viral kinetics and human immune 
responses to RSV. Prior RSV challenge studies have been conducted without 
significant AEs. Because healthy volunteers have naturally acquired RSV immunity that 
puts them at low risk for untoward outcomes, we aim to use data gathered in this 
population to enhance the development of RSV antivirals and possibly vaccines that will 
eventually benefit those at greatest risk for severe RSV disease. Data collected from 
this and future challenge studies will help guide development and testing of RSV 
antivirals, vaccine candidates, and potentially novel treatment strategies.
This new phase 1 RSV challenge study seeks to optimize and improve the use of RSV 
A2 as a challenge virus in healthy adult volunteers by: 1) increasing the titer of the virus 
challenge dose by [CONTACT_4481]-fold; 2) pre-screening potential participants using 
a RSV neutralization titer cut-off (a more stringent criterion for establishing 
susceptibility); and 3) intranasal delivery of virus via a nasal atomizer (instead of by 
[CONTACT_4482]). 
The neutralizing antibody titer cut-off was established based on data from our first RSV 
challenge study (15-I-0148) that showed a statistical association of low neutralizing 
antibody titer with RSV shedding and RSV illness, as described above. To determine 
the optimal cut-off for neutralizing antibody eligibility titer, the proportion of estimated 
shedders for various antibody titer cut-offs was determined along with the estimated 
proportion of people who would meet that criteria during screening ( Table 3). We initially 
chose a neutralizing titer cut-off of < 6.8 log (2)  and then, < 7.04 log (2) to balance the 
RSV Challenge Study II
Protocol Version 9.0
8 October 2020
Page 22 of 87estimated number of volunteers that will need to be screened to achieve an acceptable 
RSV shedding rate. However, our screening RSV neutralizing antibody titer data reveals 
that only approximately 16% of our screened volunteers have an eligible RSV titer.  An 
increase of the eligibility titer cut-off to < 8.00 log (2)  will increase the percentage of 
potentially eligible volunteers to approximately 40%, enabling us to enroll the study and 
answer the question of whether RSV A2 is a safe and suitable virus for challenge 
studies.

initially challenge 4 study participants with 106.3 PFU of RSV A2 (cohort 1), the highest 
RSV Challenge Study II
Protocol Version 9.[ADDRESS_4072] RSV challenge study (15-I-0148). We will assess 
the participants for AEs and symptoms of RSV illness on a daily basis post-challenge. 
Nasal swabs, nasal washes, and blood samples will be obtained post-challenge for 
assessment of RSV shedding and immune responses, as noted in the schedule of 
procedures ( Appendix B). The participants will remain as inpatients for a minimum of [ADDRESS_4073] disease. 
After cohort 1 is discharged from the inpatient isolation unit, the safety data will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_4484].  If these participants do not experience any significant AEs 
related to the study agent or its administration, then our next 3 cohorts (cohorts 2-4) will 
be sequentially enrolled into the inpatient isolation unit.  Seven or fewer volunteers per 
group will be accrued for each inpatient admission until the maximum cohort size (n=7) 
for each cohort is achieved. Each participant in cohorts 2-[ADDRESS_4074] be evidence of RSV shedding on 2 or more days as detected by

Headache
Cough
Hoarseness

Any symptom of Grade 4 severity
Any evidence for clinically significant lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_4379]
Any acute changes in health that are deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_4485]. 
Sub-clinical illness: Presence of RSV shedding (detected in NP wash by [CONTACT_937]- PCR or 
viral culture for [ADDRESS_4078]-challenge or later) and no clinical 
symptoms.
Symptom Flu-PRO questionnaire: We will use the FLU-PRO (the inFLUenza Patient-
Reported Outcome) instrument with additional questions ( Appendix F) to evaluate the 
suitability of this comprehensive patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure to assess 
RSV illness symptoms in clinical research. The questionnaire will be administered to 
RSV Challenge Study II
Protocol Version 9.[ADDRESS_4079] into their personal email accounts (the REDCaps 
project will be managed by [CONTACT_4486]).  The email will contain a link to the 
questionnaire.  If a participant is not able to access the questionnaire via their email 
then a paper questionnaire will be provided to them and the results entered by [CONTACT_4487].  A recent study revealed that the 37-item 
FLU-PRO questionnaire is a valid measure of influenza symptoms in adults with a 
confirmed diagnosis of influenza.[ADDRESS_4080] adverse events.  Adverse events will be 
assessed during the daily interim history and physical exam when the participants will 
be asked about the presence or absence of the expected adverse events and will be 
asked open-ended questions to elicit other symptoms.
3.1.2 Study Phases
Inpatient phase: 
A volunteer participant is considered enrolled if eligibility criteria continue to be met at 
Day 0.  Subjects will receive one intranasal inoculation of RSV A2 using a nasal 
atomizer on Day 0 and will be evaluated daily for microbiologic evidence of RSV 
infection and for clinical signs and symptoms. Daily safety assessments will also be 
performed. In addition, the RSV RT-PCR results (FilmArray) obtained from NP washes 
will be double-blinded from Day [ADDRESS_4081]-challenge.  
If a participant is withdrawn for any reason within the 3 business days prior to 
admission, then efforts will be made to maintain the intended cohort size by [CONTACT_4488] a reserve pool of qualified participants. An optional “stand-by” 
participant may be enrolled in the inpatient cohort. The “stand-by” participant will be an 
eligible volunteer who is able to come on Day -1 for an abbreviated, outpatient, clinical 
evaluation, during which a nasal swab and wash will be performed under the LID 
screening protocol (#12-I-0121, Screening of Volunteers for Clinical Trials of 
Investigational and Licensed Vaccines, Antiviral Products, or Live Virus Challenge 
Studies) for which the participant has already been consented. If the nasal wash is

scheduled volunteer withdraws from the cohort on Day -1 for any reason, after signing 
informed consent for the RSV study, the “stand-by” participant may be offered a position 
in the cohort on Day -1. 
Outpatient phase: 
All subjects will return for outpatient follow-up at [ADDRESS_4082] 55% of our study volunteers and have a higher 
probability of detecting SAEs in our study population (see Section 13.1). Our goal is to 
test that the higher dose administered using an atomizer is safe and to establish a 
sufficient frequency of RSV shedding in our study population to indicate that this 
approach may be useful to evaluate potential antivirals and vaccines in future studies.

6 Study Schedule and Clinical Procedures
The study schedule is provided in tabulated form in Appendix B. Total volumes of blood 
to be collected for research purposes are provided in Appendix C.
6.1 Screening 
Potential volunteers for the RSV challenge protocol will undergo screening after 
enrollment into the LID screening protocol #12-I-0121 (Screening of Volunteers for 
Clinical Trials of Investigational and Licensed Vaccines, Antiviral Products, or Live Virus 
Challenge Studies). 
To summarize, the following screening procedures will occur while the volunteer is 
enrolled in the screening protocol: 
Screen 1 Visit. (Day -180 to Day -14)
Review health history questionnaire
Vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and pulse 
oximetry), height and weight
CBC with differential, acute care panel, mineral panel, and hepatic panel
Urine drug screen
Urine pregnancy test (females)
RSV-specific neutralizing antibody titer
HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C testing
EKG
CXR
If any of the above tests were performed at NIH within 30 days of the Screen 1 Visit, 
and the investigators deem the results to be within limits of eligibility for the study, then 
duplicate screening labs do not need be repeated at the Screen 1 Visit. Volunteers 
deemed to be healthy and who meet eligibility criteria for the challenge study will 
continue to the Screen 2 Visit.
RSV Challenge Study II
Protocol Version 9.0
8 October 2020
Page 37 of 87Screen 2 Visit. This visit will occur between Days −56 to −2. The following procedures 
will be performed on this visit:
Complete medical history and physical examination 
Vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and pulse 
oximetry)
Review and signing of reproductive counseling form.
PFT using standard equipment to measure forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_3741] 1 second (FEV1)
FLU-PRO symptom questionnaire (baseline)
NP wash for baseline cytokine assessment (see Section 7)
NP swab sampling may be performed for microbiome analysis (see Section 7)
Labs from the screen [ADDRESS_4096] occur prior to Screen 2 visit for all participants.
Volunteers will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] 2 weeks prior to Day −1 via email to provide instructions for 
arrival on Day −1. In addition, baseline health will be re-assessed by [CONTACT_4501] a volunteer’s health (e.g. new 
medical diagnoses/surgeries, unexpected visits to the doctor’s office, urgent care or ER) 
and if any new medications have been started.
 A volunteer who reports symptoms of an URI during the 2 weeks prior to inpatient 
enrollment may be offered an additional screening visit for NP wash and multiplex 
FilmArray PCR evaluation. If the volunteer has a positive result for a respi[INVESTIGATOR_4392], then the volunteer may be offered a position in a future cohort, and the open 
spot in the upcoming cohort will be offered to another volunteer from a reserve pool of 
qualified participants. 
If the volunteer meets eligibility criteria for this study, then signed informed consent will 
be obtained at the screen 2 visit or afterwards, but prior to protocol-specific testing and 
procedures.
6.2 Inpatient Study Phase (Day −1 until discharge)
Subjects will be admitted to the Special Clinical Studies Unit in Clinical Center on study 
Day −1, where they will be familiarized with the study procedures and monitored for

study. Visitors are not allowed in the Special Clinical Studies Unit where the study 
participants will remain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4393].  Subjects manifesting any signs or symptoms of illness or who are 
now uncomfortable with or unwilling to adhere to study procedures will be discharged 
before administration of challenge virus. If a volunteer has a respi[INVESTIGATOR_4394] a significant deviation of baseline health at the time of admission, as assessed by [CONTACT_1600], they will be discharged prior to virus administration. 
Admission to Clinical Center (Day −1)

Page 42 of 876.2.1 Treatment Plan for Persistent Symptoms Associated with RSV Illness
Participants reporting persistent and significant symptoms associated with RSV illness 
may be offered symptomatic relief after clinical evaluation. If symptoms are refractory to 
single doses of over-the-counter acetaminophen (325-650 mg) and significantly, 
adversely impact daily activities (as assessed by [CONTACT_978]), such as the ability to sleep, 
then ibuprofen (200-600 mg), pseudoephedrine (30-60 mg), or throat lozenges may be 
provided, after clinical evaluation, for symptoms such as pain, persistent cough, nasal or 
sinus symptoms interfering with sleep, or fever when associated with significant 
discomfort.
Indications for offering symptomatic treatment to participants who have not yet met a 
study definition of RSV-associated upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4399]/or have not completed 
study evaluations (including research labs) through Day 7 will be determined by [CONTACT_978] 
[INVESTIGATOR_4400] (GCP) principles.
6.2.[ADDRESS_4101] and any contacts (e.g. hand 
hygiene, avoidance of persons at high risk for complication from RSV, return to clinic for 
nasal wash follow-up to determine if RSV shedding continues). The Clinical Safety 
Office (CSO)/Sponsor Medical Monitor will be notified immediately if this situation 
occurs.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Increased Severity of Clinical Illness
Any change in clinical status deemed important by [CONTACT_4506] [INVESTIGATOR_4401]. This will be 
considered an SAE. Indicators for increased care may include the following:
1. Severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375] (Section 11.1).
2. Fever with rigors.

obtained for respi[INVESTIGATOR_4404], RSV culture, and quantitative viral RNA 
detection. Surplus NP wash will become a stored research specimen (Section 9).
3. If a prior laboratory result was abnormal, this abnormality may be re-evaluated 
with a repeat blood draw.
4. Any other event that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_4405]-up will be evaluated during 
the interim safety visits.
RSV Challenge Study II
Protocol Version 9.[ADDRESS_4104] withdrawal. Interim safety 
visits or safety visits on Day 28 and/or Day [ADDRESS_4105] who 
has received study virus and withdraws from the inpatient phase of the study 
prematurely or who has significant AEs that require follow-up. Study discontinuation will 
be determined on a case-by-case basis.
An individual may be withdrawn for any of the following reasons:
1. An individual subject’s decision.
2. A clinical AE, lab abnormality, or medical condition for which continued 
participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the subject.

8 Potential Risks and Benefits
8.1 Potential Risks
Study agent inoculation
Complications or severe illnesses associated with RSV A2 challenge inoculation are 
rare and include:
Pneumonia
Secondary bacterial infections
Hypoxemia/respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]
Anaphylaxis
Also, as with any investigational product, there is a theoretical possibility of risks about 
which we have no present knowledge. Subjects will be informed of any such risks 
should further data become available.
We expect that subjects will develop RSV illness. These expected events are listed in 
Section 11.1.  Subjects will not be allowed to self-medicate for symptom relief; 
symptomatic treatment may be provided by [CONTACT_4518], persistent cough, nasal symptoms interfering with sleep, and/or fever 
when associated with significant discomfort. 
RSV Challenge Study II
Protocol Version 9.0
8 October 2020
Page 48 of 87Subjects may also be inconvenienced by [CONTACT_4519][INVESTIGATOR_4408].
Acetaminophen
Acetaminophen is well tolerated and safe in recommended doses. Potential 
acetaminophen toxicity may occur at high doses exceeding the therapeutic limit.
NP washes/swabs
Potential risks associated with NP washes and/or swabs include pain or discomfort, a 
gag reflex, and very rarely, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940].
Venipuncture
Risks occasionally associated with venipuncture include pain and bruising at the site of 
venipuncture, bleeding, lightheadedness, and, rarely, infection or syncope.
Pulmonary function tests
There are minimal risks associated with PFTs for healthy volunteers. It may cause mild 
shortness of breath and fatigue, but is otherwise noninvasive and safe. 
8.[ADDRESS_4107] benefit from participation in this study. 
Through a healthy volunteer’s participation in this study, the scientific and medical 
community may gain new knowledge and insights to guide development and testing of 
RSV antivirals, vaccine candidates, and potentially novel treatment strategies. This 
knowledge may advance efforts to bring benefit to populations of patients most 
vulnerable to severe RSV complications. 
9 Research Use of Stored Human Samples, Specimens or 
Data
Intended Use: Samples and data collected under this protocol may be used to 
study RSV infection and response in healthy adults. Human genetic testing will 
RSV Challenge Study II
Protocol Version 9.0
8 October 2020
Page 49 of 87include HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Also, human DNA may be isolated from stored research 
samples in the future for genetic testing. 
Storage: Access to stored samples will be limited using a locked freezer in a 
locked laboratory. Samples and data will be stored using codes assigned by [CONTACT_4520]. Data will be kept in password-protected computers. Only 
investigators will have access to the samples and data. 
Tracking: Samples will be stored at the National Laboratory for Cancer 
Research in Frederick, MD. Samples will be tracked using a database located on 
a password-protected computer, which will be maintained by [CONTACT_4521]. Only investigators and their designees will have access to 
this database.
Disposition at the Completion of the Protocol: 
In the future, other investigators (both at NIH and outside) may wish to use 
these samples and/or data for research purposes. If the planned research 
falls within the category of “human subjects research” on the part of the 
NIH researchers, NIH IRB review and approval will be obtained. This 
includes the NIH researchers sending out coded and linked samples or 
data and getting results that they can link back to their subjects.
Reporting the Loss or Destruction of Samples/Specimens/Data to the IRB:
Any loss or unanticipated destruction of samples or data (for example, due 
to freezer malfunction) that meets the definition of a reportable event will 
be reported to the NIH IRB according to NIH Human Research Protection 
Program (HRPP) Policy 801. 
Additionally, subjects may decide at any point not to have their samples 
stored. In this case, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_4409]. This decision will 
not affect the subject’s participation in this protocol or any other protocols 
at NIH.

11 Assessment of Safety
11.1 Definitions for Sponsor Reporting
The NIAID CSO is responsible for sponsor safety oversight of this study, and the 
definitions below comply with CSO requirements.
Adverse Event (AE): An AE is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a 
human subject, including any abnormal sign (e.g., abnormal physical exam or laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in 
the research, whether or not considered related to the research.
Expected Events: The following signs or symptoms are induced by [CONTACT_4522], and any combination of these (within the range from Grade 1 to Grade 3) is 
expected to occur with virus challenge. These symptoms will not be reported as 
unexpected AEs; they will be recorded as Expected Events of RSV infection in 
CRIMSON per protocol. Each individual with an expected AE consistent with RSV 
illness but of atypi[INVESTIGATOR_4410] 9.0
8 October 2020
Page 51 of 87for appropriate further management. In addition, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_4411], and any pattern of severity, or unexpectedly high frequency of a particular 
event, will be treated as a safety signal and potential safety concern and will prompt 
consultation with the sponsor.
Nasal congestion or rhinorrhea
Sore throat
Cough
Headache
Sinus congestion or pain
Fever, with temperature ranging from 38°C (100.4°F) to 39.4°C (103°F)
Ear pain
Adverse Reaction (AR): An AE that is caused by [CONTACT_4523] (drug or 
biologic).
Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR): An AE for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the investigational agent caused the AE. ‘Reasonable possibility’ means that there 
is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. A SAR 
implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than AR, which implies a high 
degree of certainty.
Serious Adverse Event (SAE): An SAE is an AE that results in one or more of the 
following outcomes:
death
a life threatening event (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the 
event as it occurred)
an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324]
a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions
a congenital anomaly/birth defect
a medically important event
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding events that may not be 
immediately life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4412].
RSV Challenge Study II
Protocol Version 9.0
8 October 2020
Page 52 of 87Unexpected Adverse Event: An AE is unexpected if it is not listed at the specificity or 
severity that has been observed. It is the responsibility of the IND Sponsor to make this 
determination.
Serious and Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R): A S[LOCATION_003]R is a 
Suspected Adverse Reaction that is both serious and unexpected.
Unanticipated Problem (UP): A UP is any event, incident, experience, or outcome that 
is
1. unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency in relation to
a. the research risks that are described in the IRB-approved research 
protocol and informed consent document or other study documents; and
b. the characteristics of the subject population being studied; and
2. possibly, probably, or definitely related to participation in the research; and
3. places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized. (Per the IND Sponsor, an AE with a serious outcome will be 
considered increased risk.)
Serious Unanticipated Problem (UP): A UP that meets the definition of a Serious 
Adverse Event or compromises the safety, welfare or rights of subjects or others. 
Unanticipated problem that is not an Adverse Event (UPnonAE): An unanticipated 
problem that does not fit the definition of an adverse event, but which may, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], involve risk to the subject, affect others in the research 
study, or significantly impact the integrity of research data.  These events may involve a 
greater risk of social or economic harm to subjects or others rather than 
physical/psychological harm. Such events would be considered a non-serious UP. 
Examples of a UPnonAE include a breach of confidentiality, accidental destruction of 
study records, or unaccounted-for study drug.
Unanticipated Problem that is not an Adverse Event (UPnonAE): An UP that does 
not fit the definition of an AE, but which may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], involve 
risk to the subject, affect others in the research study, or significantly impact the integrity 
of research data. Such events would be considered non-serious UPs. For example, we 
will report occurrences of breaches of confidentiality, accidental destruction of study 
records, or unaccounted-for study drug.
RSV Challenge Study II
Protocol Version 9.0
8 October 2020
Page 53 of 87Protocol Deviation: Any change, divergence, or departure from the IRB-approved 
research protocol. 
Major Deviations: Deviations from the IRB-approved protocol that have, or may have 
the potential to, negatively impact, the rights, welfare or safety of the subject, or to 
substantially negatively impact the scientific integrity or validity of the study.
Minor Deviations: Deviations that do not have the potential to negatively impact the 
rights, safety, or welfare of subjects or others, or the scientific integrity or validity of the 
study.
Non-compliance: Failure of investigator(s) to follow the applicable laws, regulations, or 
institutional policies governing the protection of human subjects in research, or the 
requirements or determinations of the IRB, whether intentional or not. 
Serious Non-compliance: Non-compliance, whether intentional or not, that results in 
harm or otherwise materially compromises the rights, welfare and/or safety of the 
subject. Non-compliance that materially affects the scientific integrity or validity of the 
research may be considered serious non-compliance, even if it does not result in direct 
harm to research subjects. 
Continuing Non-compliance: A pattern of recurring non-compliance that either has 
resulted, or, if continued, may result in harm to subjects or otherwise materially 
compromise the rights, welfare and/or safety of subjects, affect the scientific integrity of 
the study or validity of the results. The pattern may comprise repetition of the same non-
compliant action(s), or different noncompliant events. Such non-compliance may be 
unintentional (e.g. due to lack of understanding, knowledge, or commitment), or 
intentional (e.g. due to deliberate choice to ignore or compromise the requirements of 
any applicable regulation, organizational policy, or determination of the IRB).
11.[ADDRESS_4108], information regarding AEs will be elicited by

reported as outlined below (e.g., IND Sponsor, IRB, and FDA).
If a diagnosis is clinically evident (or subsequently determined), the diagnosis rather 
than the individual signs and symptoms or lab abnormalities will be recorded as the AE.
A laboratory abnormality will not be reported as an adverse event if ALL of the 
following criteria are met:
•It is no more than “Grade 1” or “Mild” per the protocol specified toxicity table 
(or investigator assessment if not listed on the table); AND
•It does NOT require an intervention (e.g., discontinuation of treatment, 
dose reduction/delay, additional assessments, or treatment); AND
•It is assessed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_4413](s) or study procedure(s); 
AND
•It is assessed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_4414] (e.g., the abnormal value does 
NOT suggest a disease or organ toxicity).
All abnormal laboratory findings will be reviewed on a routine bases by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_867]. An abnormal lab not included on the toxicity table should be 
assessed in a similar fashion to the criteria above.

up).
11.[ADDRESS_4109] to seriousness (criteria listed above), 
severity (intensity or grade), and causality (relationship to study agent and relationship 
to research) according to the following guidelines.
11.3.1 Severity
The Investigator will grade the severity of each AE according to toxicity table provided in 
Appendix E, and supplemented by [CONTACT_941] “Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity 
of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events” Version 2.1, July 2017, which can be found at: 
https://rsc.tech-res.com/docs/default-source/safety/division-of-aids-(daids)-table-for-
grading-the-severity-of-adult-and-pediatric-adverse-events-corrected-v-2-1.pdf 
Some Grade 1 lab parameters on the DAIDS Toxicity Table (fibrinogen, potassium 
[low], uric acid [males only, elevated]) fall within the NIH lab reference range for normal 
RSV Challenge Study II
Protocol Version 9.0

Page 55 of 87values. These normal values will not be reported as Grade 1 AEs. The Grade 1 values 
for these tests will be reported as follows:
Fibrinogen: 100-176 mg/dL
Potassium (low): 3.0-3.3 mmol/L
Uric acid (males): 8.7-10.0 mg/dL
Magnesium (low): 0.60-0.65 mmol/L
11.3.2 Causality
Causality (likelihood that the event is caused by [CONTACT_4526](s)) will be assessed 
considering the factors listed under the following categories:
Definitely Related
reasonable temporal relationship
follows a known response pattern
clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship
there is no alternative etiology
Probably Related
reasonable temporal relationship
follows a suspected response pattern (based on similar agents)
no evidence of a more likely alternative etiology
Possibly Related
reasonable temporal relationship
little evidence for a more likely alternative etiology
Unlikely Related
does not have a reasonable temporal relationship
OR
good evidence for a more likely alternative etiology
Not Related
does not have a temporal relationship
RSV Challenge Study II
Protocol Version 9.0
8 October 2020
Page 56 of 87OR
definitely due to an alternative etiology
Note: Other factors should also be considered for each causality category when 
appropriate. Causality assessment is based on available information at the time of the 
assessment of the AE. The investigator may revise the causality assessment as 
additional information becomes available.
11.4 Investigator Reporting Responsibilities to the Sponsor
11.4.1 Adverse Events
AE data will be submitted to the IND Sponsor when requested for periodic safety 
assessments, review of IND annual reports, review of IND safety reports, and 
preparation of final study reports.
11.4.2 Serious Adverse Events
All SAEs (regardless of relationship and whether or not they are also UPs) must be 
reported on the Safety Expedited Report Form (SERF) and sent to the CSO by [CONTACT_3719] e-
mail attachment. Deaths and immediately life threatening SAEs must be reported to the 
CSO within [ADDRESS_4110] INFORMATION:
Clinical Safety Office
[ADDRESS_4111]
Frederick, MD [ZIP_CODE]
Phone: [PHONE_070]
Fax: [PHONE_016]
E-mail: [EMAIL_007] 
SAEs that have not resolved by [CONTACT_4527]. If it is not possible to obtain a final outcome for an SAE (e.g., the 
subject is lost to follow-up), the reason a final outcome could not be obtained will be 
recorded by [CONTACT_4528].
RSV Challenge Study II
Protocol Version 9.[ADDRESS_4112] be reported to the CSO and sent by [CONTACT_3719] e-mail 
attachment no later than 7 calendar days of site awareness of the event. UPs that are 
not AEs are not reported to the CSO.
11.4.4 Pregnancy
All pregnancies will be reported on the Pregnancy Notification/Outcome Form to the 
CSO within 1 business day from site awareness.
Pregnancy outcome data (e.g., delivery outcome, spontaneous or elective termination of 
the pregnancy) will be reported to the CSO within 3 business days of the site’s 
awareness.
Although pregnancy itself is not an AE, events that meet SAE criteria during pregnancy, 
delivery, or in the neonate (e.g., congenital anomaly/birth defect) are reportable on the 
SERF.
In the event of pregnancy:
Keep the subject in the study and follow for safety through delivery, including 
maternal and fetal outcomes.
Report to safety oversight committee (SMC).
Advise research subject to notify the obstetrician of study participation and study 
agent exposure.
11.5 Additional Investigator Reporting Procedures
11.5.1 Reporting Procedures to the IRB
Reportable events will be tracked and submitted to the IRB as outlined in Policy 801.

Page 58 of 8711.5.2 Reporting to the NIAID Clinical Director
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_4415], major protocol deviations, and deaths to the NIAID Clinical 
Director according to institutional timelines.
11.6 Sponsor’s Reporting Responsibilities
S[LOCATION_003]Rs as defined in 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 312.32 and determined 
by [CONTACT_4529].
The IND Sponsor will also submit an IND Annual Report of the progress of the 
investigation to the FDA as defined in 21 CFR 312.33.
11.7 Halting Rules for the Protocol
Halting the study requires immediate discontinuation of study agent administration for all 
subjects and suspension of enrollment until a decision is made whether or not to 
continue enrollment and study agent administration.
The halting rules are:
One or more subjects experience the same or similar SAEs that are possibly, probably, 
or definitely related to the study agent or procedures;
OR
Any safety issue that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or the CSO determines should halt the study.
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or CSO will determine if the study should be halted. In addition, the FDA 
may halt the study at any time following review of any safety concerns.
11.7.1 Reporting a Study Halt
If a halting rule is met, a description of the AE(s) or safety issue must be reported by [CONTACT_1600], within [ADDRESS_4113] will be withdrawn for any of the following:
An individual subject’s decision. (The investigator should attempt to determine 
the reason for the subject’s decision.)
Non-compliance with study procedures to the extent that it is potentially harmful 
to the subject or to the integrity of the study data.
A confirmed diagnosis of another respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416] (other than RSV) during 
the inpatient portion of the study.
The investigator determines that continued participation in the study would not be 
in the best interest of the subject.
If a participant is withdrawn before inoculation with the challenge virus, then no further 
testing or follow-up will be performed. Also, if a participant is admitted to the study unit 
and then withdrawn on day of admission (Day -1) prior to receiving study virus (for any 
reason), they may be replaced with an eligible and available “stand-by” participant on 
Day -1 (Section 3.1). If a participant withdraws after Day -1, then they will not be 
replaced. 
Subjects will be strongly discouraged from withdrawing from the study after inoculation. 
We would encourage any participants who are shedding RSV to remain as an inpatient 
until viral shedding resolves completely. We will offer inpatient care with isolation 
conditions and use of any over-the-counter cold remedies as needed, and no further 
testing will be performed. If the participant insists on withdrawing completely and leaving 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4417], then no further research testing will be performed. 
However, the participant will be encouraged to contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_4418]. They will be offered the opportunity to present for a follow-up visit as well.

Page 60 of 8711.9  Safety Oversight
11.9.1 Safety Review and Communications Plan
A Safety Review and Communications Plan (SRCP) has been developed for the 
protocol. The SRCP is an internal communications document between the PI [INVESTIGATOR_4419], which delineates the safety oversight responsibilities of the PI, the CSO, and 
other stakeholders. The SRCP also includes the overall plan for conducting periodic 
safety surveillance assessments.
11.9.2 Sponsor Medical Monitor
A medical monitor, representing the IND Sponsor (OCRPRO), has been appointed for 
oversight of safety in this clinical study. The sponsor medical monitor will be responsible 
for performing safety assessments as outlined in an SRCP.
11.9.[ADDRESS_4114] of the study. The Committee may convene 
additional reviews as necessary. These reviews will occur after each cohort  has 
completed the inpatient phase and prior to enrolling the subsequent cohorts. All SAEs, 
all UPs, and all IND Safety Reports will be reported by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_4420]. Please see  Table 5 and Table 6 in 
Section 13.1 for criteria pertaining to continuing the study after cohort 3 and for criteria 
for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_4421] a rate of infectivity is encountered.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_4422].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_4423].
12 Clinical Monitoring Structure
12.1 Site Monitoring Plan
As per International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) GCP 5.18 and 21 CFR 312.50, 
clinical protocols are required to be adequately monitored by [CONTACT_4530]. This 
study monitoring will be conducted according to the “NIAID Intramural Clinical 
RSV Challenge Study II
Protocol Version 9.[ADDRESS_4115] to NIAID/OCRPRO will visit the clinical 
research site to monitor aspects of the study in accordance with the appropriate 
regulations and the approved protocol. The objectives of a monitoring visit will be: 1) to 
verify the existence of signed informed consent documents and documentation of the 
informed consent process for each monitored subject; 2) to verify the prompt and 
accurate recording of all monitored data points in CRIMSON, and prompt reporting of all 
SAEs; 3) to compare abstracted information entered into CRIMSON with individual 
subjects’ records and source documents (subjects’ charts, laboratory analyses and test 
results, physicians’ progress notes, nurses’ notes, and any other relevant original 
subject information); and 4) to help ensure investigators are in compliance with the 
protocol. The monitors also will inspect the clinical site regulatory files to ensure that 
regulatory requirements (Office for Human Research Protections [OHRP], FDA) and 
applicable guidelines (ICH-GCP) are being followed. During the monitoring visits, the 
investigator (and/or designee) and other study personnel will be available to discuss the 
study progress and monitoring visit.
The investigator will make study documents (e.g., consent forms) CRIMSON data 
abstracts and pertinent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_893] (including CRIMSON) readily 
available for inspection by [CONTACT_1201], the FDA, the site monitors, and the NIAID staff for 
confirmation of the study data. 
A specific protocol monitoring plan will be discussed with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_894]. The plan will outline the frequency of monitoring visits based on such factors 
as study enrollment, data collection status and regulatory obligations.
13 Statistical Considerations
This study is a phase 1 study to primarily assess the safety and infectability of a high 
dose, recombinant RSV A2 challenge virus administered by [CONTACT_4531]. We will 
assess RSV shedding and illness as primary and secondary outcomes, respectively.  
The sample size calculations are based on a specified frequency of RSV shedding.  The 
analyses performed will be descriptive. 
RSV Challenge Study II
Protocol Version 9.0
8 October 2020
Page 62 of 8713.1 Sample Size Justification
Sample size calculations are based on ensuring a high probability of correctly 
concluding the shedding rate is above 55% for the [ADDRESS_4116] a high probability of observing an SAE if the true SAE 
rate is greater than 9%. The total sample size is [ADDRESS_4117] cohort of 
size 4 (106.3 PFU dose) and 3 cohorts of size 7. After cohorts 2 and 3 are completed, the 
number of participants who had viral shedding will be evaluated and if the number is too 
low, the study will be stopped for inactivity (in Table 5 below, row 2 gives the criteria for 
continuing the study after each evaluation time and the number of participants with 
shedding at the end of the study that will be used to conclude activity is sufficiently 
high). The study will have a high probability of correctly concluding the 107 PFU RSV A2 
dose results in activity above 55% when the true rate is 77% (80% power). The 
probability of incorrectly concluding the RSV A2 dose results in activity above 55% 
when the true rate is 55% or less is smaller than 0.10. Table 6 shows the probability of 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_4424]. Row 2 shows the probability of 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_4425] 7 patients is 0.153 and the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_4425] 14 patients is 
0.512 (assuming you didn’t stop after 7 patients). Overall there is a 0.665 probability of 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_4426] 0.55.

For the safety endpoint of SAE there is a high probability (.89) of observing at least 1 
SAE out of 21 participants if the true SAE rate is 10%, and a probability of .[ADDRESS_4118] 1 event if the true SAE rate is 5%.
13.2 Analysis Plan 
At the end of the study, we will conclude whether the dose is active based on the criteria 
above. Confidence intervals (CIs) around the shedding rate will also be calculated.
Key characteristics of the study analyses are described here. A more comprehensive 
and detailed (separate) analysis plan will be developed prior to the conclusion of the 
trial. 
Description of the Statistical Methods to Be Employed: 
Where applicable, safety events based on continuous outcomes such as 
laboratory values will be reported as actual test values, which for study group 
summaries may also be depi[INVESTIGATOR_4429].
Differences in quantitative variables, such as shedding frequency in this 
challenge protocol compared to the first challenge protocol, will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_2329] a Wilcoxon test or perhaps a t or F test (if normality of the responses is a 
credible assumption).
RSV Challenge Study II
Protocol Version 9.0
8 October 2020
Page 65 of 87Correlations will be assessed by [CONTACT_4532]’s rank correlation, but Pearson’s 
correlation as well as linear regression may be employed for data that are 
sufficiently normal.
CIs will be calculated for all summary means (of raw values or of their logs, 
where appropriate) as well as proportions.
Methods to adjust p-values to account for multiple comparisons (other than 
standard repeated measures analysis of variables that change over time) are not 
planned for use. 
Level of Significance to be Used: A two-sided p-value of 0.[ADDRESS_4119]: Symptoms among those who 
become infected.
Handling of Missing and Spurious Data: Missing data will be assumed to be at 
random, unless there is evidence to the contrary (e.g., drop-outs differ by [CONTACT_4533](s)). The potential effects of missing data will be handled by [CONTACT_4534]. 
14 Ethics/Protection of Human Subjects
14.[ADDRESS_4120]'s involvement in the 
research. Discussions about the research will provide essential information about the 
study and include: purpose, duration, experimental procedures, alternatives, risks and 
benefits. Subjects will be given the opportunity to ask questions and have them 
answered. 
The subjects will sign the informed consent document prior to undergoing any research 
procedures. The subjects may withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of 
the trial. A copy of the informed consent document will be given to the subjects for their 
records. The researcher will document the signing of the consent form in the subject’s 
medical record. The rights and welfare of the subjects will be protected by [CONTACT_4535] 9.0

Page 66 of 87to them that the quality of their medical care will not be adversely affected if they decline 
to participate in this study. 
Informed consent will be obtained during the Screen 2 Visit (between days −30 and −2). 
Alternatively, informed consent may also be obtained on Day −1 prior to any 
protocol-specific procedures, if it was not obtained during screening.  
14.1.1 Non–English-Speaking Participants
If a non–English-speaking participant is unexpectedly eligible for enrollment, the 
participant will be provided with the Clinical Center Short Written Consent Form for 
Non–English-Speaking Research Participants in the participant’s native language and a 
verbal explanation of the purpose, procedures and risks of the study as described in 
Medical Administrative Series Policy M77-2, NIH HRPP Standard Operating Procedure 
12, and 45 CFR 46.117(b)(2). The IRB-approved English consent form will serve as 
basis for the verbal explanation of the study. The investigator will obtain an interpreter 
unless the investigator is fluent in the prospective participant’s language. Preferably, the 
interpreter will be someone who is independent of the participant (i.e., not a family 
member). Interpreters provided by [CONTACT_4536]. 
The interpreter will interpret all oral communications (English to target language and 
conversely) between the investigator and a limited English-proficient participant, 
facilitate discussions, and clarify information as necessary.
The IRB-approved English consent form will be signed by [CONTACT_4537] a witness to the oral presentation. The Clinical Center Short Written 
Consent Form will be signed by [CONTACT_4538] a witness who observed the 
presentation of information. The interpreter may sign the consent document as the 
witness and, in this case, will note “Interpreter” under the signature [CONTACT_4548]. A copy of both 
signed forms will be provided to the participant to take home.
The investigator obtaining consent will document the consent process in the 
participant’s medical record (CRIMSON), including the name [CONTACT_4549]. Further, 
all instances of use of the Clinical Center Short Written Consent Form will be reported to 
the IRB at the time of annual review. If the Clinical Center Short Written Consent Form 
is used three times or more for the same language, this will be reported to the IRB 
immediately.

15.1 Data Capture and Management 
Study data will be maintained in CRIMSON and collected directly from subjects during 
study visits and telephone calls, or will be abstracted from subjects’ medical records. 
Source documents include all recordings of observations or notations of clinical 
activities and all reports and records necessary to confirm the data abstracted for this 
study. Data entry into CRIMSON will be performed by [CONTACT_4539]. The 
investigator is responsible for assuring that the data collected are complete, accurate, 
and recorded in a timely manner.
15.[ADDRESS_4122]. All stored records will be kept confidential to the 
extent required by [CONTACT_1032], state, and local law.
Should the investigator wish to assign the study records to another party and/or move 
them to another location, the investigator will provide written notification of such intent to 
OCRPRO/NIAID with the name [CONTACT_4550]/or their new location. Destruction or relocation of research 
records will not proceed without written permission from NIAID/OCRPRO.

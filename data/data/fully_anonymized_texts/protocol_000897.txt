Page 3 SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
Amendment Rationale:  
This amendment was prepared to allow evaluation of less frequent dosing schedules of once 
daily for 7 out of 28 days (QD  7/28) and QD for 3 out of 14 days (QD 3/14) repeated twice in a 
28-day cycle; remove restrictions on the timing of meal rela tive to the drug administration, 
remove the restriction of concomitant use of medications that are strong inhibitors of 
cytochrome  P450 ( CYP ) 3A. 
This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of 
Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.

collected during Dose Escalation using the above schedule, 
and upon review by [CONTACT_726531]  
(eg, QD 28/28, QD 7/28, QD 3/14  × 2). 
Part 1 (Dose Escalation)  
Dose  escalation of milademetan  to determine the MTD  will be 
guided by a Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM) 
following escalation with ove rdose control (EWOC) principle  
following an initial accelerated titration design  (ATD) .  
Accelerated titration design for determining initial dose for 
escalation by [CONTACT_726532] . 
Before starting BLRM , initial dose escalation will proceed 
following an ATD  in order to minimize the numb er of subjects 
treated at sub -therapeutic doses of the drug.  The proposed 
human starting dose of milademetan  is 15 mg/day .  Single 
subject s will be enrolled into sequential dose levels with a 
dose increment of 100% from the previous dose .  
Over-enrollment  in ATD up to 3  subjects per cohort is 
permitted .  The dose for ending  ATD will be the dose level in 
which one of the following occurs:  
 One Grade 2 or highe r milademetan -related  toxicity  
according to National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 4  
(NCI -CTCAE v4) during Cycle 1 , 3 to 6 subjects will be 
enrolled at the next dose level, which will be guided by 
[CONTACT_540833]1; or 
 If a DLT is observed during Cycle 1, the co hort will first 
be expanded to [ADDRESS_992171] 1 week apart.   If no further DLT 
is reported, the cohort will be expanded to include up to 3 
additional DLT -evaluable subjects prior to initiation of 
BLRM  in the next dose level.  
The information from the accelerated titration stage will be 
included in the Bayesian model for dose escalation.

Page 23 EWOC  
The dose increment during BLRM  will be as follows:  
 The dose level increment should be no less than 30 % in 
order to have distinction among dose levels considering 
the inter -subject variability in exposure , but flexibility may 
be applied in selecting th e dose to accommodate the 
available dosage form strengths.  
 The dose level increment should be no more than 100% 
even if the model suggested a higher dose than 100% for 
the next cohort.  
 In the event of a DLT, the next [ADDRESS_992172] 
1 week apart.  
The dose escalation will be based on a BLRM  with EWOC 
principle.  The logistic regression model for the dose -toxicity 
(DLT rat e) relationships will include 2  parameters : the 
intercept and the slope.  After the first 3  subjects of each 
cohort complete  DLT evaluation  during Cycle 1, the posterior 
distributions of the DLT rate will be derived for all dose levels 
based on the BLRM using the DLT outcome data from all 
assessed exposure levels and a p re-specified prior distribution 
for the model parameters.  The posterior probability of the 
DLT rate in the following 4  intervals at each dose level: [0%, 
16%] as the DLT rate interval for under -dosing, [16%, 33%] 
as the target DLT rate interval, [33%, 60% ] as the DLT rate 
interval for excessive toxicity, and [60%, 100%] as the DLT 
rate interval for unacceptable toxicity will then be calculated, 
and used for dose recommendation for the next cohort 
according to the EWOC principle.  
The EWOC principle require s that the BLRM  recommended 
dose for the next cohort of subjects is the one with the highest 
posterior probability of the DLT rate in the target DLT rate 
interval of [16%, 33%] among all dose levels fulfilling the 
overdose control constraint: there is less  than 25% of 
probability for the DLT rate   33% (probability for excessive 
or unacceptable toxicity).  
The dose to be tested in the next cohort of subjects chosen by 
[CONTACT_1034] ’s clinical team and the investigator (s) involved in 
the clinical study will be based on the do se recommended by 
[CONTACT_111831] , clinical assessment of toxicity profiles, and 
PK/PDy information observed thus far . 
Cohorts of [ADDRESS_992173] received 75% of the doses 
(ie, 16 days) during  Cycle 1 , or experienced a DLT in Cycle  1.  
The final MTD  will be decided based on considerations of th e 
respective MTD  estimated by [CONTACT_111831] , and on an overall 
assessment of safety data from subsequent cycles and PK/PDy 
information collected at all different doses tested.  For dose 
determination, the following stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_726493]: (a) at least 
[ADDRESS_992174] 21  evaluable 
subjects in total enrolled in the Dose Escalation  part, or (b) at 
least [ADDRESS_992175] been  enrolled at a dose level 
that is the model’s recommendation for the next dose cohort 
and for which the posterior probability of targeted toxicity is at 
least 50%, or  (c) dose level -1 is too toxic.  
Cohorts may be expanded at any dose level or at the MTD  for 
further elaboration of safety, PK, or PDy parameters as 
required.  
Dose escalation using alternative drug administration schedule  
Based on safety, PK, and PDy data collected during Do se 
Escalation using the QD  × 21/28-day schedule of 
milademetan , an alternative  drug administration schedule for 
dose escalation may be considered  following review by [CONTACT_726534] .  Modeling and simulation 
will be performed to evaluate DS -3032a  exposure relationship  
to PDy and toxicity .  If the results indicate that using an 
alternative dosing schedule may provide less toxicity (eg, 
myelosuppression) while offering pharmacodynamic benefits 
based on available biomarkers or a better PK profile, dose 
escalation using this recommended alternative dosing schedule 
will be performed in lieu of, or in p arallel with the

Page 25 QD × 21/28 -day schedule.  For example:  
 Case 1: If the recommended dosing schedule is less 
frequent than QD × 21/[ADDRESS_992176] daily dose 
tested for the QD  × 21/[ADDRESS_992177] of evaluable subjects.    
 Case 2: If the recommended dosing schedule is more 
frequent than QD  × 21/28 days (eg, QD continuous 
× 28 days) , the starting daily dose will be ≤ 75% of the 
highest daily dose tested for  the QD  × 21/[ADDRESS_992178] of evaluable 
subjects .  This starting dose of the new schedule will 
provide the same 4 -week cumulative dose while reducing 
daily exposure by ≥ 25%.  
 Case 3: If additional testing is suggested to optimize the 
dosing regimen (to maintain sufficient dose density over 
time without requiring frequent dose interruptions as a 
result of delayed toxicities ) after the MTD is identified , 
then dosing may initiate at a dose l evel lower than MTD in 
that dosing regimen .  Subject enrollment may be limited to 
one or a small number of cancer types or molecular sub -
types depending on available clinical data for milademetan  
with the dosing regimen and investigator experience  with 
this class of compound .  Up to [ADDRESS_992179] cohort to be evaluated will begin treatment with 
milademetan  at 90 mg QD × 21/28 days, preferentially in 
subjects with liposarcoma considering the existing data in 
this patient population at 120 mg QD × 21/28  days and 
90 mg QD × 2 8/28 days  for comparison of safety.  
The dose of 90 mg QD × 21/28 days  is evaluated to define 
a hematologically safe and tolerable regimen based on the 
safety data at the doses previously evaluated (15 mg 
through 30, 60, 120, 160 and 240 mg QD × 21/28 days , 
with the determination of MTD at 120 mg ) in this dosing 
schedule.  Most DLTs arose from myelosuppression, 
particularly thrombocytopenia, which  also resulted in dose 
delays and dose reductions in the subjects who continued 
in Cycle 2 and subsequent cycles.  Therefore to reduce the 
risk of progressing to more severe bone marr ow toxicities 
and dose interruptions during continued treatment, the 
following dose adjustment rules will be followed  for

Page 26 Cycle  2 and subsequent cycles : 
 If platelets decrease to <  50% of baseline (the 
platelets measured at Cycle 1 Day 1) or 
Grade  ≥ 2 throm bocytopenia 
(Platelets  < 75 × 109/L) at the end of Cycle  1, 
then:  
o If platelets decrease by >  50% from 
baseline, but are ≥ 75 × 109/L, do not 
interrupt milademetan  dosing, but reduce 
the dose of milademetan  to 60  mg 
QD × 21/28 days.  
o If Grade ≥ 2 thrombocytopenia, hold 
dosing of milademetan .  When the 
platelets recover to ≥ 75 × 109/L, resume 
milademetan  at a reduced dose of 60 mg 
QD × 21/28 days.  
 Dose interruptions and further dose reductions 
due to toxicity will be allowed .  
After an initial cohort of 3 subjects has completed treatment 
in Cycle 1, the dose may be adjusted based on the safety 
results and discussion between the investigators and the 
Sponsor.  
In addition to the above dose dense schedules, the following 
less frequ ent dosing schedules will be evaluated in dose 
escalation with a starting dose of 120 mg that was the MTD 
determined in the QD  × 21/28 days schedule:  
 QD for 7 out of 28 days (QD × 7/28 days)  
  QD for 3 out of 14 days (QD × 3/14 days) repeated twice 
in a 28 -day cycle  
Both the original QD  × 21/28 days and alternative dosing 
schedules are explored in parallel.  
The final MTD for each dosing schedule will be decided based 
on considerations of the respective MTDs estimated by [CONTACT_726535] , and on an overall assessment  of safety data from 
subsequent cycles and PK/PDy information collected at all 
different doses tested.  Upon determining the final MTD of the 
original QD  × 21/28 days and/or alternative dosing schedules, 
one dosing regimen will be selected for further eval uation in 
Part 2 (Dose Expansion) , which may also be  the tentative 
RP2D .

Upon establishing  MTD /tentative RP2D  and drug 
administration schedule  in Part [ADDRESS_992184] cycle, a safety analysis 
will be conducted to allow the reevaluation of  the 
appropriateness of the dosing level.   If the incidence of 
adverse events fulfilling the criteria of a DLT has exceeded 
that predicted by [CONTACT_111886], after the ini tial 
4 DLT -evaluable subjects or after additional  enrollment, no 
further testing at the MTD/ tentative RP2D  level  established in 
Part 1 will be done , and dose de -escalation or treatment at 
alternative dose schedules may  be considered  for further 
evaluation of safety and efficacy . 
Tumor assessment (Part 1 and Part 2)  
Tumor assessment will be performed  according to the study

 During Dose Escalation  and Dose Expansion , tumor 
TP53 genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_726494] -fixed paraffin -embedded (FFPE) and, if 
available, fresh tumor biopsies in all enrolled 
subjects.  Confirmation  of TP53 wild -type status is 
NOT required prior to milademetan  dosing .  The 
investigator will be informed if the genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_726495]53 mutations 
testing result shows that a subject’s malignant cells 
contain an inactivating m utation, insertion, or 
deletion in the TP53 gene.  If study treatment has 
already begun, the subject may choose to discontinue 
study drug  or continue study drug  as long as clinical 
benefit is noted per the investigator’s judgment .  
TP53 re -testing can be c onsidered.   
Study Duration:  The study duration is expected to last approximately [ADDRESS_992188] s may be 
captured in a separate database.  
Study Sites and Location:  Approximately  5 United Sta tes sites are planned for Part 1 ( Dose 
Escalation ) and  for Part 2 ( Dose Expansion ).  The same sites are 
planned to participate  for both parts.  
Planned Sample Size:  The Dose Escalation phase of this study (Part 1) consists of an 
ATD  followed by [CONTACT_540833]  + EWOC  design with at least [ADDRESS_992189] optimal schedule .  No formal 
statistical assessment has been performed.  
For the Dose Expansion  part (Part 2),  approximately 
20 subjects (each of subjects with advanced melanoma and 
DLBCL ) will be enrolled .  If response  rate is more than  25% 
(null hypothesis: response rate  ≤ 0.25, alternative hypothesis: 
response rate  > 0.25) , then the probability  of no response out  of 
10 subjects  will be less than 10% .  The probability that 4 or 
more responders out of 10 subjects  are observed will be  less 
than 25%  under the null hypothesis but more than 80% under 
alternative hypothesis with response rate  = 0.50.  
The probability values for the sample size are derived based on 
binomial distribution using SAS Version 9.2.

Dosage Form, Dose and Route 
of Administration:  Milademetan  will be administered as an or al caps ule.  It will be 
supplied in 5, 20, 80, and 200  mg capsules individually 
packaged in desiccant -embedded aluminum blisters .  Two other 
capsule strengths of 30 and 100 mg will also be supplied in 
high-density polyethylene bottles .  
Study Endpoints:  Safety Endpoint s: 
Safety parameters  will include serious adverse events , TEAEs, 
physical examination findings (including ECOG performance 
status), vital sign measurements, standard clinical laboratory 
parameters  (serum chemistry, hematology, urinalysis) , and ECG 
parameter s.  Adverse events  will be graded according to the 
NCI-CTC AE v4.  Dose escalation will be determined by [CONTACT_726536].  
Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Endpoints : 
Plasma PK and standard non -compartmental P K parame ters will 
be assessed.   Plasma samples for PK assessments will be taken 
at multiple time point s in the study.  Additionally, PK sample s 
may also be obtained outside of the specified time point s during 
the study if deemed clinically necessary.   
Induction of serum MIC -[ADDRESS_992192] of milademetan  treatment on 
MIC -1 induction.  Other exploratory PDy biomarkers including, 
but not l imited to, expression levels of p53, p21, MDM2 , 
MDM4 , Ki67, apoptosis markers , and/or other biomarkers  will 
also be assessed , if available . 
Efficacy Endpoints : 
In solid tumor subjects with measurable disease , tumor response 
will be evaluated using RECIST v 1.1.  In subjects with  
lymphomas, treatment response will be evaluated using the 
revised IWG criteria.  
Statistical Analyses  The primary analysis will occur either after all subjects in Part [ADDRESS_992193] deviations, and ranges, while categorical data 
will be summarized using frequency counts and percentages.  
Graphical summaries of the data may be presented.  
Safety Endpoints : 
The safety profile  will be based on serious adverse events , 
TEAEs,  physical examination findings  (including ECOG 
performance status) , vital sign measurements, standard clinical  
laboratory endpoints  (serum chemistry, hematology, urinalysis) , 
and ECG endpoints .  All subjects receiving at least 1 dose of 
milademetan  will be included in the safety analyses.  
Tumor Response:  
Response assessment will be performed according to the 
Schedule of Events or if disease progression is suspected.  
Radiographic assessment should  include computed  tomography 
(CT) of all affected sites.  In addition, subjects with lymphoma 
should undergo a (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose -positron emission 
tomography  (FDG -PET) scan.  Tumor responses will be

Milademetan  is an orally available and highly selective inhibitor of the murine double minute  2 
(MDM2 )-p53 interaction.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Intended Use Under Investigation  
Milademetan  will be evaluated in subjects with advanced solid tumor s or lymphomas refractory 
to standard treatment or for which no standard treatment is available.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pharmacolo gical Target(s)  
Milademetan , a novel, specific, small -molecule inhibitor of MDM2, disrupts interactions 
between MDM2 and the tumor suppressor protein p53 in tumor cells and i s being developed as 
an oral drug for the treatment of cancer .  The tumor suppressor protein p53 plays an essential 
role in preventing neopla sia by [CONTACT_726539] .  However,  inactivation of p53 by [CONTACT_726540] a significant 
percentage of human tumors, resulting in a loss of tumor suppressor activity and thereby 
[CONTACT_2869] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_726499].  
The mechanism of action of milademetan  is summarized in  Figure  2.1.

Note: Schematic of p53/ MDM2  intera ctions and impact on cell sig naling pathways altered in certain 
malignancies.  Milademetan  exerts anti tumor activity by [CONTACT_726541]2  and p53 and 
preventing p53 degradation.  The resulting increase in wild-type p53 activity activates signal transduction pathways  
important in inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis , and/or senescence in tumor cells.  
Source: Data on File  
In human tumors that retain wild -type p53 protein, its activity is frequently inhibited by 
[CONTACT_726542] p53 and MDM2 .  MDM2 a nd p53 form a regulatory 
feedback loop in which MDM2 maintains low levels of p53 activity in normal, unstressed cells, 
by [CONTACT_726543] p53 out of the nucleus and proteasome -mediated degradation of p53 
through its E3 ubiquitinization ligase activity.1 In the presence of stress, p53 becomes activated 
and subsequently acts as a transcription factor that modulates the expression of a variety of 
genes, including MDM2.2 The MDM2 binding domain on p53 overlaps with the transcriptional 
activation domain of p53, there by [CONTACT_726544] p53 .  Thus, in human tumors , 
disruption of MDM2/p53 balance through overexpression and/or oncogenic activation of MDM2 
allows tumorigenesis and tumor growth by [CONTACT_166187] p53 function .  Pharmacologic inhibition of 
the interact ion between MDM2 and wild -type p53 in tumor cells could result in sustained 
increases in p53 activity and subsequent antitumor effects.3,[ADDRESS_992207] could be an effective strategy for cancer therapy targeting the 
wide array of human cancers that retain wild -type p53.5

Page 53 [IP_ADDRESS].1.  Human Starting Dose  
Based on the rat and dog repeat -dose toxicity studies, the dog proved to be the most sensitive 
species to milademetan -induced myelotoxicity .  The highest nonsever ely toxic dose ( HNSTD ) in 
dog was found to be 3 mg/kg /day (60 mg/m2/day; human equivalent dose 1.62 mg/kg or 
~ 100 mg in a 60 -kg patient) .  Applying a safety factor of 6, these data support ed a starting dose 
of 10  mg/m2 (~15 mg in a 60 -kg patient) .  The nonclinical pharmacology data suggest ed that 
pharmacologically  active exposures were likely to be  achieved through dose escalation .  To 
mitigate the risk of untoward toxicity , the use of a continuous reassessment method coupled with 
a dose -exposure model is proposed to guide dose escalation.   Additional details are provided in 
the current IB .6 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Clinical Experience  
This is the first -in-human study of milademetan .  No prior clinical experience of milademetan  
was available when the study was initiated .  Additional details  of ongoing clinical studies  are 
provided in the current IB .[ADDRESS_992208], apoptosis, or senescence.  The gene 
encoding p53 (TP53) suffers disabling somatic mutations or deletions in about 50% of all 
malignant tumors.  In tumo rs expressing wild-type protein, the tumor suppressor function of p53 
may be attenuated by  [CONTACT_27887], such as over -expression of MDM2 , a negative regulator 
of p53.  MDM2  binds p53 with high affinity and negatively modulates the transcriptional activ ity 
and stability of the tumor suppressor.  In tumors with functio nal p53, inhibition of the 
MDM2 -p53 interaction can restore p53 activity and is expected to offer a nove l strategy for 
cancer therapy.  
Milademetan  is an orally available and highly selective inhibitor of the MDM2 -p53 interaction .  
It shows antitumor efficacy against tumors with wild -type p53 via activation of the tumor 
suppressor in a variety of cell culture and xenograft models .  This ongoing Phase  [ADDRESS_992209]-in-human study will be conducted to assess the safety and tolerability of milademetan , as 
well as to determine the pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PDy) profile and preliminary 
efficacy of the drug.  
2.3. Risks and Benefits for Study Subjects  
2.3.1.  Poten tial Risks Associated with Milademetan  
Investigators in the milademetan  program must be aware of the potential for hematologic and 
gastrointestinal toxicit ies and properly monitor for these toxicities and promptly manage subject s 
who experience these adverse events  (AEs) .  Please refer to the current IB6 for updated safety 
and risk/benefit assessment.

Page 54 2.3.2.  Potential Risk of Drug -Drug Interaction  
Nonclinical studies indicate that DS-3032a  (the free form of milademetan)  is metabolized by  
[CONTACT_9058] P 450 (CYP ) 3A4 and CYP3A5 by [CONTACT_726545].  Drugs that are strong induce rs of CYP3A  may alter the 
pharmacokinetics of milademetan  and, therefore, should be avoided until formal drug -drug 
interaction s tudies have been conducted.  
A Phase [ADDRESS_992210] of co -administration of 
the strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (itraconazole and posaconazole) on milademetan PK 
(Study  U107).  Co-administration of milademetan 100 mg with itraconazole 200 mg at steady 
state increased milademetan geometric mean Cmax and AUCinf by 8% and 115% , respectively .  
Similarly, posaconazole 200 mg at steady state increased milademetan geometric mean Cmax by 
[CONTACT_3450] 19% and AUCinf by [CONTACT_41672] 149%.  Therefore, dose of milademetan is 
recommended to be reduced to half when it is concomitantly administered with strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors.  
Milademetan  showed direct inhibition on CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C 9, CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6, and CYP3A , but not on CYP1A2 and CYP2E1 ( half maximal inhibitory concentration  
range: 7.8  µM to 27.0  µM).  Milademetan  also showed metabolism -dependent inhibition on 
CYP3A  (both testosterone 6 β-hydroxylase and midazolam 1 ’-hydroxylase) .  The concentration 
required for  half maximal inactivation ( KI) and maximal rate of inactivation  at saturation  (kinact) 
values were calculated to be 60.5  µM and 0.0619 min-1 for CYP3A  (midazolam 1 ’-hydroxylase), 
respectively.  However, these levels of milademetan  are much higher than tho se expec ted to be 
achievable in humans .  Therefore concomitant use of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C 9, CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6, and CYP3A  substrates will be permitted .  Please refer to the current IB for additional 
details on drug -drug interactions with milademetan.[ADDRESS_992211] dose of milademetan  yielded a 93% tumor reduction  relative to 
the control group.  These data demonstrate that in tumors with wild-type p53, inhibition of 
MDM2 -p53 interaction can restore p53 activity and is expected to offer a novel strategy for 
cancer therapy.  
2.4. Population, Route, Dosage, Dosage Regimen, Treatment Period  
Milademetan  will be administered as an oral capsule.  It will be supplied in 5, 20, 80, and 
200 mg capsules individually packaged in  desiccant -embedded  aluminum blisters .  Two other 
capsule strengths of 30 and 100 mg are also supplied in high density polyethylene ( HDPE )

4.1. Overall Plan  
4.1.1.  Study Type  
This will be a Phase 1, open -label study of milademetan  to assess its safety and tolerability, 
identify an MTD/ tentative RP2D , and assess its PK/PDy properties in subjects with advanced 
solid tumors or lymphomas.  
Approximately 5 [LOCATION_002] ( US) sites are planned for Part 1 (Dose Escalation ) and Part 2 
(Dose Expansion).   The same sites are planned to participate  for both parts.  
4.1.2.  Treatment Groups  
This 2 -part study will include both a Dose Escalation portion, to identify the MTD /tentative 
RP2D , and a Dose Expansion portion, to confirm the safety and tolerability of milademetan , by 
[CONTACT_726549].  
Milademetan  will be administered once daily on Days 1  to 21 of a 28 -day cycle 
(QD × 21/28 days).  An alternative drug administration schedule for dose escalation may be 
considered to evaluate the DS-3032a  exposure relationship to PDy, toxicity , and efficacy .  If the 
results indicate that using an alternative dosing schedule may provide less toxicity 
(eg, myelosuppression) while offering PDy benefits based on available biomarkers, or better PK 
profile, dose  escalation using this recommended alternative dosing schedule will be performed in 
lieu of or in parallel with the QD  × 21/28 -day schedule .   
After discontinuation of the study drug , subjects will be contact[CONTACT_726550] -of-Study 
Follow -up V isit 30  (± 2)  days after the last dose of study drug.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Part 1 (Dose Escalation)  
Dose  escalation of milademetan  to determine the MTD will be guided by a Bayesian logistic 
regression model (BLRM) following escalation with overdose control (EWOC) principle  
following an init ial accelerated titration design (ATD) .

 If a DLT  is observed during Cycle 1, the cohort will first be expanded to 
[ADDRESS_992213] 1 week apart.  If no further DLT is reported, 
the cohort will be expanded to include up to 3 additional DLT -evaluable subjects 
prior to initiation of BLRM  in the next dose level . 
The information from the accelerated titra tion stage will be included in the Bayesian model for 
dose escalation.  
Dose level increment during dose escalation by [CONTACT_726552]:  
 The dose level increment should be no less than 30% in order to have  distinction 
among dose levels considering the inter -subject variability in exposure , but f lexibility 
may be applied in selecting the dose to accommodate the available dosage form 
strengths . 
 The dose level increment should be no more than 100% even if the model suggested a 
higher dose than 100% for the next cohort.  
 In the event of a DLT, the next [ADDRESS_992214] 1 week apart.  
The dose escalation will be based on a  BLRM  with EWOC principle.  The logistic regression 
model for the dose -toxicity (DLT rate) relationships will include 2  parameters : the intercept and  
the slope.  After the first 3 subjects of each cohort complete DLT evaluation during Cycle 1, the 
posterior dis tributions of the DLT rate will be derived for all dose levels based on the BLRM 
using the DLT outcome data from all assessed exposure levels and a pre -specified prior 
distribution for the model parameters.  The posterior probability of the DLT rate in the  following 
4 intervals at each dose level  will then be calculated and used for dose recommendation for the 
next cohort according to the EWOC principle  [0%, 16%] as the DLT rate interval for

for excessive toxicity, and [60 %, 100%] as the DLT rate int erval for unacceptable toxicity.  
The EWOC principle requires that the BLRM  recommended dose for the next cohort of subjects 
is the one with the highest posterior probabi lity of the DLT rate in the target DLT rate interval of 
[16%, 33%] among all dose levels fulfilling the overdose control constraint: there is less than 
25% of probability for the DLT rate   33% (probability for excessive or unacceptable toxicity).  
The dose  to be tested in the next cohort of subjects chosen by [CONTACT_1034]’s clinical team and the 
investigator(s) involved in the clinical study will be based on the dose recommended by [CONTACT_726535] , clinical assessment of toxicity profiles, and PK/PDy information ob served thus far.  
Cohorts of [ADDRESS_992215] ed during Dose Escalation using  the QD  × 21/28 -day 
schedule of milademetan , an alternative drug administration schedule for dose escalation may be 
considered following review by [CONTACT_726553] .  Modeling and 
simulation will be performed to evaluate DS -3032 a exposure relationship to PDy and toxicity .  If 
the results indicate that using an alternative dosing schedule may provide less toxicity 
(eg, myelosuppression) while offering pharmacodynamic benefits based on available biomarkers 
or a better PK profile, dose escalation using this recommended alternative dos ing schedule will 
be performed in lieu of or in parallel with the QD  × 21/28 -day schedule.  For example:  
 Case 1 : If the recommended dosing schedule is less frequent than QD  × 21/[ADDRESS_992216] daily dose 
tested for the QD  × 21/[ADDRESS_992217] of 
evaluable subjects.  
 Case 2: If the recommended dosing schedule is more frequent than QD  × 21/28 days 
(eg, QD continuous × 28 days), the starting daily dose w ill be ≤ 75% of the highest 
daily dose tested for the QD  × 21/[ADDRESS_992218] of evaluable subjects .  This starting dose of the new schedule will provide 
the same 4 -week cumulative dose while reducing daily exposure b y ≥ 25%.  
 Case 3: If additional testing is suggested to optimize the dosing regimen (to maintain 
sufficient dose density over time without requiring frequent dose interruptions as a 
result of delayed toxicities) after the MTD is identified, then dosing may initiate at a 
Protocol  DS3032 -A-U101  
Version 4.[ADDRESS_992219] cohort to be evaluated will begin treatment with milademetan  at 90  mg QD 
× 21/28 days, preferentially in subjects with liposarcoma considering the existing data 
in this patient population at 120 mg QD × 21/28  days and 90 mg QD × 28/28 days for 
comparison of safety.  
The dose of 90 mg QD × 21/28 days  is evaluated to define  a hematologically safe and 
tolerable regimen based on the safety data at the doses previously evaluated (15 mg 
through 30, 60, 120, 160 , and 240 mg QD  × 21/28 days, with the determination of 
MTD at 120 mg ) in this dosing schedule.  Most DLTs arose from my elosuppression, 
particularly thrombocytopenia, which  also resulted in dose delays and dose reductions 
in subjects who continued in C ycle 2 and subsequent cycles.  Therefore , to reduce the 
risk of progressing to more severe bone marrow toxicities and dose i nterruptions 
during continued treatment, the following dose adjustment rules will be followed  for 
Cycle 2 and subsequent cycles : 
 If platelets decrease to <50% of baseline (the platelets measured at Cycle 1 Day 1) 
or Grade ≥2 thrombocytopenia (Platelets < 7 5 × 109/L) at the end of Cycle 1, 
then:  
o If platelets decrease by >50% from baseline, but are ≥ 75 × 109/L, do not 
interrupt milademetan  dosing, but reduce the dose of milademetan  to 
60 mg QD × 21/28 days.  
o If Grade ≥2 thrombocytopenia, hold dosing of milademetan .  When the 
platelets recover to ≥ 75 × 109/L, resume milademetan  at a reduced dose of 
60 mg QD × 21/28 days.  
 Dose interruptions and further dose reductions due to toxicity will follow the 
same guidelines provided in Section 4.1.8 . 
After an initial cohort of 3 subjects has completed treatment in Cycle 1, the dose may be 
adjusted based on the safety results and discussion between the investig ators and the 
Sponsor.  
In addition to the above dose dense schedules, t he following less frequent dosing 
schedules will be evaluated in dose escalation with a starting dose of 120 mg that was the 
MTD determined in the QD 21/28 -day schedule:  
 QD for 7 out of  28 days (QD × 7/28 days)  
 QD for 3 out of 14 days (QD × 3/14 days) repeated twice in a 28 -day cycle

occurs during the observation period (Cycle  1) in each dose -level cohort and is Grade 3 or higher 
according to NCI -CTCAE, v 4, with the exceptions as defined below:  
For hem atologic events, a DLT is defined as follows:  
 Grade 4 neutropenia lasting  > 7 days  
 Febrile neutropenia  
 Grade 4 anemia  
 Grade  4 thrombocytopenia or Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia lasting more than 7  days 
or associated with bleeding

 AST/ALT >  5  upper limit of normal (ULN) lasting >  3 days without liver 
metastases  
 AST/ALT >  5  ULN if accompanied by ≥ Grade 2 elevation in bilirubin

highest posterior probability of the DLT rate in the target DLT rate interval of [16%, 33%] 
among all doses fulfilling the overdose control constraint: there is less than 25% probability for 
the DLT rate  > 33% (probability for excessive or unacceptable toxicity) ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).  Since 
an alternative drug administration schedule may be explored in lieu of or in parallel with the 
original QD × 21/28 days schedule, separate MTDs may be identified for each regimen .  The 
final MTD for each dosing schedule will be decided based on considerations of the respective 
MTDs estimated by [CONTACT_726557] a ssessment of safety data from subsequent 
cycles and PK/PDy information collected at all different doses tested .  Upon determining the 
final MTD of the original QD  × 21/28 days and/or alternative dosing schedules, one dosing 
regimen will be selected for fur ther evaluation in Part 2 (Dose Expansion) , which may also be 
the tentative RP2D .   
4.1.7.  Management of Subjects with Adverse Events  
Treatment -related toxicities meeting the DLT definition (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  for DLT definitions) 
occurring after Day 28 (ie, outside the DLT observation period) or o ccurring in Part 2 of the 
study  will result in interruption and/or discontinuation of therapy.  For subjects deriving clinical 
benefit from treatment, an option to resume the therapy at 1 dose level below that at which the 
toxicity occurred may be considered after the toxicity returns t o NCI -CTCAE v 4 Grade ≤ [ADDRESS_992233] experiences NCI -CTCAE v 4 Grade 3 or 4 
toxicity or an SAE that is unequivocal ly attributable to the underlying malignancy, milademetan 
treatment may be postponed until the toxicity has resolved to NCI -CTCAE v 4 Grade ≤ [ADDRESS_992234]  has 
obtained  clinical benefit from milademetan  treatment that continued during the recovery period 
of the AEs .  
4.1.8.  Guidelines for Dose Delays  
Dosing of milademetan  should be interrupted if the following adverse events develop any time 
during treatment:  
 Absolute neutrophil count <  1 × 109/L (1000/mm3). 
 Platelet count <  75 × 109/L. 
 All other NCI-CTCAE v4  Grade ≥ 2 nonhematological , non disease -related  toxicities, 
except alopecia and Grade ≥ 2 fatigue lasting <  48 hours . 
 For other NCI-CTCAE v4  Grade ≥ 2 laboratory abnormalities that are not DLT s, 
treatment continuation with milademetan  will be at the discreti on of the investigator.  
Commencing rules for milademetan  administration are:  
 Absolute neutrophil count  ≥ 1 × 109/L (1000/mm3). 
 Platelet count ≥ 75 × 109/L.

Page 68  All other NCI -CTCAE v4  Grade ≥ 2 nonhematological toxicities (excluding alopecia) 
must have resolved to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline values.  
These parameters should be seen as guidelines and are not intended to supersede the clinical 
judgment of the treating physician.  All adjustments should be made in consultation with the 
Sponsor’s Medical Monitor.  
In the event of a dose delay occurring  prior to completion of the PK/PDy sampl ing in the study, 
investigator s should contact [CONTACT_726558].  
In the event of a dose delay due to noncompliance, the study site should notify DSI at the earliest 
possible time.  Subjects missing more than 25% of the scheduled doses in Cycle 1 for 
nontoxicity -related reasons may be removed from the study.  
4.2. Selection of Doses  
4.2.1.  Experimental Treatments  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Part 1 (Dose Escalation)  
The study will enroll subjects into cohorts with dose escalation by [CONTACT_726559]  [IP_ADDRESS] .  The sta rting dose will be 15  mg/day  (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS].1  for 
justification of the human starting dose) .  In the event of a DLT, the next [ADDRESS_992235] 1  week apart . 
Upon completion of Part 1 (Dose Escalation) and determination of the MTD/ tentative RP2D , 
Part 2 (Dose Expansion) will immediately begin.  Subjects will receive milademetan  at the 
MTD/ tentative RP2D  defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  For the Study  
Please see Section  2.2 for further details.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  For Individual Subjects  
Please see Section  2.[ADDRESS_992236] treatment is available.  Specific 
inclusion and exclusion criteria are available in Section  5.1.1 and Section  5.1.2 . 
5.1. Enrollment  
Investigators will maintain a confidential screening log of all potential study candidates that 
includes limited information of the subjects (i nitials, age, sex) , date, and outcome of screening 
process (eg, enroll in the study, reason for ineligibility, refused to participate).  
Investigators will be expected to maintain an Enrollment Log of all subjects enrolled in the study 
indicating their assi gned study number.  
Investigators will maintain a confidential subject identification code list.  This confidential list of 
names of all subjects who have been allocated to a subject identification number (SID) upon 
enrolling in the study allows the investi gator to reveal the identity of any subject when necessary.  
Each subject or legally acceptable representative will be provided with information about the 
study, will have all questions answered to their satisfaction, and will sign and date an informed 
consent form ( ICF).  This will be completed  before any study -specific procedures are performed.  
Additional information about informed consent procedures is provided in Section  16.3. 
A subject is considered enrolled in the study upon the Investigator  or designee obtaining written 
informed consent from the subject or the subject’s legally acceptable representative 
(Section  16.3) and upon determination that all inclusion and exclusion criteria have been 
satisfied.  After assigning a  SID to each subject at the timing of scr eening, investigator s will 
assess the eligibility of a subject based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria after obtaining 
written informed consent from the subject.  After assessment by [CONTACT_1697] s, the inclusion 
criteria/exclusion criteria form will be completed for registration.  The Sponsor  will perform 
registration after verifying that the subject meets the inclusion/exclusion criteria provided by [CONTACT_3786] .  If the Sponsor has any questions regarding the information sent by [CONTACT_093] , 
he or she will immediately contact [CONTACT_726560].  Directly after 
registration, the Sponsor  will forward the results of registration to the investigator .  At this time, 
the subject will be assigned to study drug treatment.  
The In vestigator must not prescribe or administer the study drug until the subject has completed 
registration.  If the Sponsor disqualifies a subject from participation in the clinical study, the 
investigator will be notified.  The investigator will then explain  this outcome to the relevant 
subject.  
Data for all study visits will be recorded on the electronic case report form ( eCRF ) for subjects 
who receive study drug treatment.  Only minimal data ( ie, demography  and reason for 
withdrawal) will be recorded on the eCRF for subjects who fail the inclusion/exclusion criteria 
and/or do not receive study drug.  Further data, such as adverse event s, will not be collected from 
subjects once they are considered screen failur es or have decided to withdraw prior to receiving 
study drug.

unused milademetan  at the next visit.  Alternatively, to ensure compliance, the site 
personnel may choose to dispense only the adequat e amount of study drug required 
until the next scheduled visit.  Compliance with the study drug regimen will be 
determined by [CONTACT_726561] ≥ 75% in the DLT 
evaluation period .   
 Milademetan  administration that occurs at clinic visits will be supervised by a 
member of the site staff.   
6.1.3.  Labeling and Packaging

Drug supplies must be stored in a se cure, limited access storage area under the  recommended 
storage conditions listed below:  
 Stored at 2 °C to 8 °C (36 °F to 46 °F). 
If storage conditions are not maintained per specified requirements, Medpace  or DSI should be 
contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
6.1.6.  Drug Accountability  
When a drug shipment is received, the investigator or designee will check the amount and 
condition of the drug, check for appropriate local language in the label  and drug expi[INVESTIGATOR_320], 
and sign the Receipt of Shipment Form provided.  The Receipt of Ship ment Form should be 
faxed as instructed on the form.  The original will be retained at the site.  In addition, the 
investigator or designee shall contact [CONTACT_726562] a problem with the 
shipment.  
A Drug Accountability Record will be provided for the investigational product.  The record must 
be kept current and should contain the dates and quantiti es of drug received, subject 
(identification number and/or initials or supply number as applicable ) for whom the 
investigational product was  dispensed, the date and quantity of investigational product dispensed 
and remaining, if from individual subject drug units , as well as the initials of the dispenser.  
At the end of the study, or as directed, all milademetan  capsules  including unused, parti ally used, 
or empty containers will be returned to a designee as instru cted by [CONTACT_726563].  Investigational p roduct 
will be returned only after the study monitor has completed a final inventory to verify the 
quantity to be returned.  The return of investigational  product must be documented and the 
documentation included in the shipment.  At  the end of the study, a final investigational p roduct 
reconciliation statement must be completed by [CONTACT_726564].  Unused drug supplies may be destroyed by [CONTACT_726565]/delegate , and DSI/delegate  has received copi[INVESTIGATOR_120278]’s drug handling and disposition 
SOPs.

Page 76 6.2.1.  Prohibited Concomitant Medications /Activities  
The following medications a nd products will be prohibited:  
 Other anticancer therapy, including cytotoxic, antibody, retinoid, or hormonal 
treatment and small -molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors.   Concurrent use of hormone 
replacement therapy, the use of gonadotropin releasing hormon e modulators for 
prostate cancer, and the use of somatostatin analogs for neuroendocrine tumors are 
permitted if such therapy has not been changed within 8 weeks before study drug 
treatment.  Megestrol acetate as supportive care is also permitted.  
 Other in vestigational agents.  
 Nonclinical studies indicate that milademetan  is metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A.  Drugs that 
are strong inducers of these enzymes may alter the PK of milademetan  and should 
therefore be avoided ( Section  18.5).  If drugs that are strong inhibitors of CYP3A 
need to be taken concomitantly, then milademetan dose must be reduced to half the 
assigned dose.  
 Milademetan  is metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A .  St. John’s Wort (hypericin) therefore will 
not be permitted for 30 days before and during participation in the study.  
 Because milademetan  is a substrate for CYP3A  and grapefruit juice and Seville 
oranges contain  CYP3A inhibitor s, foods or beverages contain ing grapefruit or 
Seville oranges should be avoided within 48 hours before  initial dose of study drug  
and throughout the duration of  the study.

[IP_ADDRESS].  Part 1 (Dose Escalation) End -of-Study  Follow -up 
The End -of-Study F ollow -up should occur 30 (±  2) days after the last administration of 
milademetan .  Follow -up information will be collected via a phone call or site visit.  If the 
subject begins another form of anticancer  therapy before the end of the 30  (± 2) -day period, 
every effort wi ll be made to complete all the E nd-of-Study assessments prior to commencing the 
new therapy.  The investigator should follow subjects with adverse events  until the event has 
resolved or the condition has stabilized.  In case of unresolved adverse events , including 
significant abnormal laboratory values at the End-of-Treatment assessment, these events wi ll be 
followed up until resolution or until they become clinically irrelevant . 
The following information will be collected at this follow -up: 
 Assessment of adverse events  
 Current medications  
 Subject survival status

8.1. Efficacy Variable(s ) 
Efficacy assessments will be based on tumor assessments  to be performed at screening and every 
[ADDRESS_992255] 8 cycles and then every 3 cycles thereafter (ie, at start of 
Cycles  3, 5, 7, and 9, then Cycles 12, 15, etc.)  while the subject remains on study drug.  The 
clinical activity of milademetan  will be assessed  by [CONTACT_726567].  In subjects with 
solid tumors, tumor response will be evaluated using RECIST  v 1.1 (Section  18.3).  In subjects 
with lymphomas, tumor response will be evaluated using the revised IWG criteria 
(Section  18.4).7 
Computed tomography (CT) and/o r magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (spi[INVESTIGATOR_152760] 
≤ 5 mm cuts) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be used for tumor assessment unless 
another modality of disease assessment is necessary for the lesions.  Every effort should be made 
to use the  same assessment modality for all assessments for each subject.  
Subjects with lymphoma require an FDG -PET scan at baseline.  Subjects with lymphoma who 
are FDG -PET avid require FDG -PET scanning at each tumor assessment.  Bone marrow will be 
assessed at bas eline by [CONTACT_6149][INVESTIGATOR_6706]/or biopsy per the investigator ’s decision.  If positive, bone 
marrow assessments  may be repeated with subsequent tumor assessments.  
As a complementary approach to the exploratory objective #2 in Part 1 ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ), 
particularly in WD/DD  liposarcoma that ar e preferentially enrolled in the study due to the high 
prevalence of MDM2 amplification, the growth  rates of the target tumors before starting 
milademetan versus on -treatment with milademetan may be analyzed by [CONTACT_726568] [ADDRESS_992256]/MRI scans performed for RECIST v 1.[ADDRESS_992257](s) as a post -hoc exploration of the effect of milademetan on spe cific tumor 
histologies  (eg, WD/ DD liposarcoma) .

Blood samples for PK analyses will be collected for the measurement of plasma concentrations 
of milademetan as shown in Table  9.1.  Additionally, PK sample s may be obtained at any time 
during the study if deemed clinically necessary.  At each time point , approximately 5 mL of 
blood will be collected for DS-3032a  analysis.  Instructions for the handling of blood samples 
and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_726515] a separate document  
(eg, laboratory manual) .  The actual time of study drug administration and the exact time of 
blood samplin g for PK analysis must be recorded on the case report form ( CRF ).   
The PK samples will be shipped to a central laboratory for forwarding to a Sponsor -designated 
bioanalytical laboratory.  Plasma concentrations of DS-3032 a will be measured using a validate d 
assay at the bioanalytical laboratory.    
The PK parameters (eg , Cmax, area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time 0 to  
24 hours [AUC0 -24h], etc.) will be estimated by [CONTACT_105] -compartmental analysis as described in

wild-type status is NOT required prior to milademetan  dosing .  The investigator will 
be informed if the genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_726501]53 mutations 
(ie, if the testin g result shows that a subject’s malignant cells contain an inactivating 
mutation, insertion, or deletion in the TP53 ).  If the testing result shows that a 
subject’s tumor contains an inactivating mutation, insertion, or deletion in the 
TP53  gene after milademetan  has begun, the subject may choose to discontinue from 
the study or continue treatment as long as the subject is deriving clinical benefit ( SD 
or objective response) in the absence of unacceptable toxicities per investigator 
assessment .  TP53 re -testing can be considered.  
 During Dose Expansion, TP53 genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_726517]-treatment tumor biopsies and archived samples from sub jects with sarcoma and 
DLBCL.  In addition to TP53 genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], tumor samples may be analyzed for 
DNAseq  and RNAseq .  Confirmation of TP53 wild -type status is NOT required prior 
to milademetan  dosing, but the investigator will be informed if the genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_726495]53 mutations .  If the testing result shows that 
a subject’s tum or contains an inactivating mutation, insertion, or deletion in the

Additional biomarkers outside of the p53 pathway may  be included in order to better understand 
the responsiveness to therapy.  These may include protein, metabolite, gene expression, or 
genetic biomarkers.  
Subjects should be willing to provide archived tumor samples.  During Part 1 (Dose Escalation), 
subjects will have the option to provide pre - and post -treatment biopsies  (baseline and 6 hours 
postdose  [± 2 hours] on Cycle 1 Day 8 [±  2 days]) .  During  Part 2 (Dose Expansion), subjects  are

Page 97 required to provide a pre-treatment  biopsy  (baseline) .  Post-treatment tumor  biopsies will be 
requested to be obtained 6 hours postdose  [± 2 hours] on Cycle 1 Day 8.   Tumor biopsies may be 
obtained by [CONTACT_726569] (for melanoma), Tru -cut technique, or core needle biopsies 
under imaging guidance . 
Optional t umor re -biopsy will be performed within [ADDRESS_992260] achieved an initial CR/PR  or SD for at least 6 months  to milademetan  but 
later developed PD while on therapy.  
9.3. Pharmacogenomics  
As part of this study, a blood sample will also be banked for possible future PGx analysis in 
DNA.  All participants should be presented with the PGx ICF at screening.  Participation in t his 
portion of the study is optional for all subjects.  Thus, those who choose not to provide a sample 
for PGx analysis may still participate in the main portion of the study.  
In all parts of the study, on Day 1 of Cycle 1 prior to study drug administratio n, the blood PGx 
sample should be collected for subjects who sign the PGx ICF.  This sample may be analyzed 
only for genes suspected to contribute to the safety and efficacy of the study drug ( milademetan ).   
Results will provide information on how individ uals metabolize and /or react to the study drug or 
help to identify subjects who are more likely or less likely to benefit from the study drug.  The 
information may be useful in increasing the knowledge of differences among individuals in the 
way they metab olize the study drug, as well as helpi[INVESTIGATOR_129897].  
Because emerging information regarding the safety and efficacy of milademetan  may become 
available in the future, samples will be retained for possib le future analysis.  Samples will be 
retained until the DNA has been exhausted or until the Sponsor  instructs the genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_726518] (in accordance with laboratory procedures).  During the period 
of storage, the DNA sample will not  be immortalized or sold to anyone.  Subjects will have the 
right to withdraw consent and have their sample destroyed at any time.  
The samples will be shipped to a central laboratory for forwarding to Gentris Clinical Genetics, 
Inc., which has been contrac ted by [CONTACT_726570].  
To ensure subject confidentiality, sample tubes will be identified only by a barcode label.  This 
barcode will be linked to the subject’s SID number.  
Refer to a separate document for instructions for sample collection, preparation, handling, 
storage, and shipment.

Version 4.[ADDRESS_992261] sign s the ICF and up to 30  (±2) days after 
the last dose of stud y drug, whether observed by [CONTACT_98138] , will 
be recorded on the adverse event eCRF page .  Medical conditions (including laboratory 
values/vital signs that are out of range) that were diagnosed or known to exist prior to inf ormed 
consent will be recorded as part of medical history.  All SAEs are to be reported according to the 
procedures in Section  10.5.  Investigators s hould r eport diagnosis as the adverse event  or SAE 
term; when the diagnosis is unavailable, they should report signs and symptoms as individual 
entries of adverse event  or SAE  until the diagnosis becomes available .  For events that are 
serious due to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the reason for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_175164] 
(diagnosis or symptom requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  A procedure is not an adverse event or SAE, 
but the reason for the procedure may be an adverse  event or SAE.  Pre -planned (prior to signing 
the ICF) procedure or treatment requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5912] -existing conditions that do not 
worsen in severity should not be reported as SAEs (see Section  10.4.2  for definitions).  For 
deaths, the underlying or immediate  cause of death should always be reported as a n SAE.  
Disease progression is a study endpoint and consequently should not be reported  as an adverse 
event/SAE.  However, when a subject dies from disease progression with no other immediate 
causes, “disease progression ” should be reported as an SAE.  In addition, any serious , untoward 
event that may occur subsequent to the reporting period  that the investigator assesses as related 
to study drug should also be reported and managed as an SAE.  
At each visit, the investigator  will determine whether any adverse events have occurred by 
[CONTACT_194761].  Adverse events may be directly obser ved, reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_1560] , or by [CONTACT_550072].  Subjects should be questioned in a 
general way, without asking about the occurrence of any specific symptoms.  All laboratory 
values must be appraised by [CONTACT_100316].  All post -baseline 
abnormal laboratory values considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_726571] , if serious, report ed as an SAE following the procedures in 
Section  10.5. 
The investigator should follow subjects with adverse events until the event has resolved or the 
condition has stabilized.  In case of unresolved adverse events including significant abnormal 
laboratory values at the End-of-Treatment  assessment, these events wil l be followed up until 
resolution or until they become clinically irrelevant.  
10.2. Safety Endpoints  
Safety endpoints include SAEs , TEAEs, physical e xamination findings (including ECOG 
performance status), vital signs measurements, standard clinical laboratory p arameters  (serum 
chemistry, hematology, urinalysis) , and ECG parameters.   
10.3. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Not applicable.  
Protocol  DS3032 -A-U101  
Version 4.[ADDRESS_992262] a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory find ing, for example), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product ( International Council for Harmonisation 
[ICH] E2A Guideline.  Clinical Safety Data Management: Def initions and Standards for 
Expedited Reporting, Oct 1994).  
It is the responsibility of investigators, based on their knowledge and experience, to determine 
those circumstances or abnormal lab oratory  findings that should be considered adverse events.  
10.4.2.  Seriou s Adverse Event  
Any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death  
 Is life -threatening  
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_158979]  
 Results in persistent or signifi cant disability/incapacity  
 Is a con genital  anomaly/birth defect  
 Is an important medical event  
Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically mi ght have caused death if it were more severe (ICH E2A Guideline.  Clinical 
Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Oct 1994).  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , but may jeopardize the subject or may 
require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.  
Examples include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, and blood dyscrasias , or development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Note:  
 A procedure is not an adverse event  or SAE, but the reason for the procedure may be 
an adverse event . 
 Pre-planned (prior to signing the ICF) procedures or treatment requiring  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_648435] -existing conditions that do not worsen in severity are not 
SAEs.  
Protocol  DS3032 -A-U101  
Version 4.[ADDRESS_992263] 
severity grade attained should be reported.  
The NCI -CTCAE guidelines do not allow certain grades for certain AEs.  For example, pain can 
be Grade 1 to 3 only (ie, cannot be life -threatening or fatal), whereas sepsis can only be Grade 4 
or 5 (i e, can only be life -threatening or fatal).  In addition, alopecia can only be Grade 1 or 2.  
The NCI -CTCAE guidelines should be followed closely.  
 Grade 1 Mild adverse event  
 Grade 2 Moderate adverse event  
 Grade 3 Severe adverse event  
 Grade 4 Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
 Grade 5 Death related to adverse event  
Severity vs. Seriousness:  Severity is used to describe the intensity of a specific event while the 
event itself, however, may be of relatively minor  medical significance (such as severe headache).  
This is not the same as “seriousness, ” which is based on subject /event outcome at the time of t he 
event.  For example, the NCI -CTCAE Grade 4 (life -threatening or disabling adverse event ) is 
assessed based o n unique clinical descriptions of severity for each adverse event , and these 
criteria may be different from those used for the assessment of adverse event  seriousness.  An 
adverse event  asses sed as Grade 4 based on the NCI -CTCAE grades may or may not be as sessed 
as serious base d on the seriousness criteria.  
10.4.4.  Causality Assessment  
The investigator  should assess causal relationship between an adverse event and milademetan  on 
the basis or his/her clinical judgmen t and the following definitions.  The causality assessment 
should be made based on the available information and can be updated as new information 
becomes available.  
 1 = Related:  
 The adverse event  follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study drug 
administration and cannot be reasonably explained by  [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state 
or other factors (eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, and concomitant 
medications).  
Or 
 The adverse event  follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study drug 
administration and is a known reaction to the drug under  study or its chemical 
group or is predicted by [CONTACT_25046].  
Protocol  DS3032 -A-U101  
Version 4.0 04 FEB 2020

 The adverse event  does not follow a reasonable sequence from study product 
administration or can be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or 
other factors ( eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, and concomitant 
medications).  
10.4.5.  Action Taken Regarding the Study Product  
 1 = Dose Not Changed : No change in study drug dosage was made.  
 2 = Drug Withdrawn : The study drug was permanently stopped.  
 3 = Dose Reduced : The dosage of study drug was reduced.  
 4 = Drug Interrupted: The study drug  was temporarily stopped.  
 5 = Dose Increased: The dosage of study drug was increased.   
10.4.6.  Other Action Taken for Event  
 None  
 No treatment was required  
 Medication required  
 Prescription and/or over-the counter ( OTC ) medication was required to treat the 
adverse event.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46823]  
 Other  
10.4.7.  Adverse Event Outcome  
 1 = Recovered/Resolved  
 The subject fully recovered from the adverse event  with no residual effect 
observed.  
 2 = Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae  
 The residual effects of the adverse event are still present and observable.  
 Include  sequelae/residual effects.  
 3 = Not Recovered/Not Resolved  
 The adverse event itself is still present and observable.  
 4 = Fatal  
 Fatal should be used when death is a direct outcome of the adverse event . 
 5 = Unknown

E-mail:  
All events (serious and non -serious) must be reported with the investigator's assessment of the 
event's seriousness, severity, and causality to the study drug.  A detailed  narrative summarizing 
the course of the event, including its evaluation, treatment, and outcome , should be provided.  
Specific or estimated dates of event onset, treatment, and resolution should be included when 
available.  Medical history, concomitant me dications, and laboratory data that are relevant to the 
event should also be summarized in the narrative.  For fatal events, the narrative should state 
whether an autopsy was or will be performed and include the results if available.  Source 
documents (inc luding medical reports) will be retained at the study site and should not be 
submitted to the Sponsor for SAE reporting purposes.  
Urgent safety queries must be followed up and addressed promptly.  Follow -up information and 
response to non -urgent safety que ries should be combined for reporting to provide the most 
complete data possible within each follow -up.  
10.6. Notifying  Regulatory Authorities,  Investigators , IRB, and Competent 
Authorities  
DSI and/or Medpace  will inform investigators , IRBs, and regulatory auth orities of any suspected 
unexpected serious adverse event reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) occurring in other study sites or other DSI 
studies of the investigational product, as appropriate  per local reporting requirements . 
In the US, upon receipt of the Sponsor’s notif ication of S[LOCATION_003]Rs that occurred with the study 
drug, unless delegated to the Sponsor, it is the investigator’s responsibility to inform the IRB per 
Sponsor’s instruction.  
10.7. Exposure In Utero During Clinical Studies  
DSI must be notified of any subject who becomes pregnant while receiving  study drug  or up to 
the End -of-Study Follow -up (at least 30 [± 2]  days after the last administration of study drug) or 
withdrawal from the study, whichever occurs later .   
Although pregn ancy is not technically an adverse event, all pregnancies must be followed to 
conclusion to determine their outcome.  This information is important for both drug safety and 
public health concerns.  It is the responsibility of the investigator, or designee,  to report any 
pregnancy in a subject using the Exposure In Utero (EIU) Reporting form.  Please contact [CONTACT_152850] a pregnancy.  The 
investigator  should make every effort to follow the subject unti l completion of the pregnancy.  If 
the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as a n SAE

Page 103 (ie, post-partum complications, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital 
anomaly, including that in an aborted fetus), the investigator should follow the procedures for 
reporting SAEs  as outlined in Section  10.5. 
The potential for milademetan  to affect fertility and embryo -fetal development has not been 
tested.  Women of childbearing potential should be informed of the potential risk, have periodic 
pregnancy tests, and use highly effective methods of birth control during treatment and for an 
additional [ADDRESS_992264] on sperm is unknown.  
Male subjects  with partners of childbearing potential should inform their partners of their 
participation in the clinical study and use highly effective methods of birth control during 
treatment and for an additional 90 days  after the end of treatment.  
10.8. Clinical Laborat ory Evaluations  
The following clinical laboratory tests will be measured.  For clinical laboratory parameters, the 
reference range of the institution that performs the measurements will be used.  
Information will be entered in the eCRF  on whether or not measured, date of measurement, and 
measurement results for the following items.  
 Hematology tests 
 red blood cell count , hemoglobin , hematocrit, platelet count, and white blood cell 
count  with 5 -part differential, including absolute neutrophil count  and reticul ocyte 
count . 
 Serum  chemistry tests  
 sodium, potassium , bicarbonate, chloride, calcium, phosphorus, albumin, glucose, 
serum creatinine, uric acid, total protein, blood urea nitrogen, AST, ALT, alkaline 
phosphatase , and total and direct bilirubin . 
 Urinalysis  
 Creatinine clearance (screening only), protein, glucose, blood, microscopy 
assessments, and specific gravity . 
 Coagulation: INR and aPTT . 
 Serum or urine beta -human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test . 
 Tumor markers . 
All laboratory values must be appraised by [CONTACT_726572].  All 
abnormal laboratory values considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_726573].  Abnormal laboratory valu es (NCI -CTCAE Grade 3 or 4) 
occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repeat test results return to normal (or 
baseline), stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant.

Whether or not measured, information will be entered in the eCRF  on date of measurement and 
measurement results for the following items : systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, 
pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], body temperature, and pulse oximetry . 
10.10.  Electrocardiograms  
Twelve -lead ECG s (in triplicate)  will be measured after the subject has rested in a recumbent 
position for [ADDRESS_992266]’s medical history, physical examination, and concomitant medications.  The 
investigator or delegated physician will review, sign, and date all ECGs.   Please refer to 
Table  18.2 and Table  18.3 for timing of ECG assessment s and specific instructions for subjects 
enrolled per Case 3 (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
10.11.  Physical Examination s 
Physical examinations will evaluate the following body systems/organs: general appearance; 
dermatological; head and eyes; ears, nose, mouth, and throat; pulmonary; cardiovascular ; 
abdominal; genitourinary (optional); lymphatic; musculoskeletal/extremities;  and neurological.  
Weight and height will also be recorded in kilograms  and centimeters, respectively , and BMI 
calculated .  Clinically significant changes from baseline must be reported as AEs.   ECOG 
performance status will also be assessed as part of the  physical examinations.

12.1. General Statistical Considerations  
The primary analysis is to summarize DLT during the D ose Escalation  part; efficacy in the Dose 
Expansi on part ; and safety, PK, and PDy data  in both study parts . 
The primary analysis will occur either after all subjects in Part [ADDRESS_992267].  After the primary analysis, th e 
main study will be closed.  Subjects in Part 1 and Part 2 who are still on study drug at the time of 
the primary analysis may be eligible to continue receiving study drug in a separate extension 
phase of the protocol (see Section  18.7), and data collected from those subjects may be captured 
in a separate database.  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for selected demographic, safety, PK, and PDy data by 
[CONTACT_726574].  Descriptive statistics on continuous data will include means, 
medians, standard deviations, and ranges, while categorical data will be summarized using 
frequency counts and percentages.  Graphical summaries of the dat a may be presented.  
Assessments of change from baseline to post -treatment or the ratio of post -treatment to baseline 
will include only those subjects with both baseline and post -treatment measurements.  The last 
nonmissing value of a variable taken before the first dose of study drug will be used as the 
baseline value, unless otherwise specified.  In general, missing or dropout data will not be 
imputed for the purpose of data analysis, unless otherwise specified.   
Safety analyses will be performed based on  the safety analysis set.  Analysis of PK parameters 
will be based on the PK analysis sets , and biomarker analyses will be based on the PDy 
biomarker analysis sets.  Efficacy endpoints will be analyzed based on the full analysis set and 
the primary analysi s set.  Data from the Dose Escalation part will be summarized by [CONTACT_651725].  
A detailed SAP describing the methodology to be used in the final analysis will be prepared and 
finalized before database lock.  Statistical methods described within t his document may be 
changed based on advances in research.  
12.2. Analysis Sets  
12.2.1.  Enrolled Analysis Set  
The enrolled analysis set will include all subjects who signed an ICF and were enrolled in either 
the Dose Escalation  part or the Dose Expansion  part of the study.  
12.2.2.  Full Analysis Set  
The full analysis set will include all subjects enrolled in  the Dose Escalation part or the  Dose 
Expansion  part who received any amount of milademetan . 
Protocol  DS3032 -A-U101  
Version 4.[ADDRESS_992268] 4 weeks  (28 days)  on study , or without DLT but received at least 75% of 
scheduled Cycle 1 (28 days) milademetan  doses  and completed Cycle 1 safety assessments .  
12.2.5.  Safety Analysis Set  
The safety analysis set will include all subjects enrolled who received any amount of 
milademetan .  Subjects will be summarized according to treatment actually received.  
Three  groups of subjects will be identified within the safety  analysis  set: (1) subjects in the Dose 
Escalation  part, (2) subjects in the Dose Expansion  part, and (3) all s ubjects in the study.  
12.2.6.  Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set  
The PK analysis set will include all subjects in the enrolled analysis set who received any 
amount of milademetan  and had measurable plasma concentrations of milademetan .  
12.2.7.  Biomarker Analysis Set  
The PDy bi omarker analysis set will include all subjects in the enrolled analysis set who received 
any amount of milademetan  and who had the baseline assessment and , where applicable, at least 
[ADDRESS_992269] response to prior chemotherapy, lines of prior regimens, and 
prior treatment type will be summarized for the enrolled analysis sets, full analysis sets,  primary 
analysis sets,  and safety analysis sets.  If 2 analysis sets within a part  of the study are identical to 
each other, the table will be presented only once.  
Study drug exposure, treatment duration, and compliance with study therapy will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics for the safety analysis sets.  
12.4. Efficacy Analyses  
12.4.1.  Primary Efficacy Analyses  
Not applicable for Part 1.  
For Part 2 ( Dose Expansion), primary efficacy variables will include objective response rate (the 
sum of CR and PR rates); disease control rate ( DCR ) (the sum of CR rate, PR rate, and SD rate 
Protocol  DS3032 -A-U101  
Version 4.[ADDRESS_992270] dosing date), response duration, duration of SD, and 
time-to-response ( TTR ), using RECIST v 1.1 or the revised IWG  criteria.  
The primary efficacy variables will be listed and summarized using descriptive statistics based 
on the full analysis set and the primary analysis set for the Dose Expansion part of the study.  For 
both objective response rate and DCR, point estimates and 9 5% exact binomial confidence 
intervals will be provided.  Time to event variables including PFS, response duration, and 
duration of SD will be summar ized descriptively using the Kaplan -Meier method.   PFS is 
defined as the time from the date of the first do se to the earlier of the dates of the first objective 
documentation of radiographic disease progression , death due to any cause , or the last 
radiographic assessment if no progression assessment occurs .  Censoring rules for the PFS 
analysis will be specifie d in the SAP.  
In addition to the above analysis, descriptive statistics for the percent change in the sum of 
longest dimensions (SLD) in measurable tumors will be provided for solid tumors.  A  waterfall 
plot of the greatest percent decreases from screening  in the SLD will be presented for each 
subject with an advanced solid malignancy.  In addition, the percent change  in the SLD  at each 
of the first [ADDRESS_992271] -baseline assessments will be presented.   Change in tumor size comparing to 
pretreatment/historical dat a will be presented graphically .  Additional details will be presented in 
the SAP.  
12.4.2.  Seconda ry Efficacy Analyses  
For Part 1 (if feasible), objective response rate, DCR, response duration, duration of SD, TTR, 
PFS, and percent change in SLD of measurable tumors may also be analyzed using the same 
method as described above for the primary efficacy analyses.  
In addition,  the growth rates of the target tumors before starting milademetan based on prior 
scans from subjec ts’ medical records versus on -treatment with milademetan may be summarized.  
Additional analyses will be describ ed in the SAP.  
12.4.3.  Exploratory Efficacy Analyses  
For both Part 1 and Part 2, the growth modulation indices (the intrasubject ratio of PFS 
post-study drug  versus PFS post the most recent prior therapeutic regimen) will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_15994].  
12.5. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
12.5.1.  Pharmacokinetic A nalyses  
Plasma concentration data for milademetan will be summarized using descriptive statistics 
(number of subjects [n], mean, coefficient of variance [CV%], standard deviation, median, 
geometric mean, geometric CV%, minimum and maximum) by [CONTACT_42376] a t each time point .  
The last PK time point  for Cycle 1 Day 1 (24 hr) is the predose  sample for Cycle 1 Day 2.  
For Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion, the PK parameters listed in Table  12.1 will be

chemistry, hematology, urinalysis), and ECG parameters.  Adverse events will  be graded 
according to the NCI -CTCAE v4.  In the Dose Es calation part, the incidence of DLTs  will also 
be evaluated . 
Safety analyses in general will be descriptive and will be presented in tabular format with the 
appropriate summary statistics.  In the Dose Escalation part, the number o f DLTs identified 
among the DLT -evaluable subjects in the DLT -evaluable set will be li sted and summarized for 
each dose of milademetan .   
12.6.1.  Adverse Event Analyses  
A TEAE is defined as an adverse event  that emerges during  the treatment period (from first dose 
date until [ADDRESS_992274] dosing date), having been absent at pre-treatment ; or reemerges 
during treatment, having been present at baseline but stopped prior to treatment; or worsens in

subjects as well as hematologically safe and tolerable for prolonged treatment without dose 
delays ,  subjects in additional cohorts and multiple dosing schedules  may be added.  
For the Dose Expansion  part (Part 2),  approximately 2 0 subjects (each for advanced melanoma 
and DLBCL ) will be enrolled .  If the response rate  is more than  25% (null hypothesis: response 
rate ≤ 0.25, alternative hypothesis: response rate  > 0.25) , then the probability  of no response out  
of 10 subjects  will be less than 10% .  The probability that 4  or more responders out of 10 
subjects  are observed will be  less than 25%  under the null hypothesis but more than 80% under 
alternative hypothesis with response rate  = 0.50.

12.11.  Specification of Bayesian Logistic Regression Model  with  Escalation 
with Overdose Control  
12.11.1.  Bayesian Logistic Regression Model for Modified Continuous Reassessment 
Method  
The dose -toxicity relationship for BLRM  with EWOC principle will be describ ed by a 
2-parameter BLRM:  
logit(π(d)) = log(α) + β log(d/d*),  α>0, β>0  
where logit(π(d))= ln ( π(d)/(1 -π(d))), π(d) is the probability of a DLT or the DLT rate  at dose d.  
Doses are rescaled as d/d* with the reference dose d* = 90 mg/day .  As a consequence,  α is equal 
to the odds of toxicity at d*.  Note that for a dose equal to zero, the probability of toxicity is zero.  
12.11.2.  Prior Specification for Bayesian Logistic Regression Model Parameters  
The Bayesian approach requires the specification of a prior distribut ion for the BLRM 
parameters.  A minimally  informative bivariate normal prior11 for the model para meters (log(α),  
log(β)) is obtained as follows:  
 Based on extrapolation of nonclinical toxicology studies in dogs, the MTD is 
projected to be greater than 90 mg/day  in humans (the HNSTD of dogs is 
3 mg/kg /day [60 mg/m2/day], and assuming humans and dogs are  equally sensitive, 
the MTD is projected to be greater than 90 mg/day  in humans ).  The median prior 
probabilities of DLT are set to be approximately 8.0% and 24.5% at 15 mg/ day 
(10 mg/m2/day) (projected starting dose for dose escalation using BLRM ) and at 
90 mg/day (60 mg/m2/day), respectively . 
 For the remaining doses, the prior medians of probability of DLT are assumed linear 
in log -dose on the logit -scale.  
Protocol  DS3032 -A-U101  
Version 4.0 04 FEB 2020 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 113  Based on the above medians for the probability of DLT at each dose and wide prior 
credible intervals  (obtained from minimally informative Beta distributions11), the 
optimal parameters of the bivari ate normal distribution can be obtained as follows :  
Parameters  Means  Standard D eviations  Correlation  
log(α), log(β)  (-1.1286, -0.4947 ) (2.0244 , 1.0595 ) -0.4831  
12.11.3.  Escalation with Overdose Control Principle  
Dose recommendation for the next cohort will be based on summaries of the posterior 
probability of the DLT rate for provisional doses:  15, 30, 60, 90, 130, 200, 300, 440, 680 , and  
900 mg/day.  After each cohort of subjects completes DLT evaluation during Cycle  1, the 
posterior distributions of the DLT r ate are derived for all provisional dose levels based on the 
BLRM using the DLT outcome data from all assessed doses and a prespecified prior distribution 
for the model parameters.  The posterior probability of the DLT rate in the following 4  intervals 
at each dose level: [0 %, 16%] as the DLT rate interval for underdosing, [16%, 33%] as the target 
DLT rate interval, [33%, 60%] as the DLT rate interval for excessive toxicity, and [60 %, 100%] 
as the DLT rate interval for unacceptable toxicity will then be cal culated and used for dose 
recommendation for the next cohort according to the EWOC principle.  The above provisional 
doses are based on an initial estimate of the human MTD  of 90 mg/day  using the HNSTD of 
dogs in nonclinical toxicology studies ( 3 mg/kg/day ).  Of note, the HNSTD of rats was 
considerably higher (1000 mg/kg/d ay), and dog bone marrow cells were approximately 6-fold to 
7-fold more sensitive to milademetan -induced myelotoxicity than human in the colony -forming 
unit-granulocyte/macrophage  assay (see current IB ).  It is therefore conceivable that  the posterior 
probability of DLT rate for dose recommendation may be generated using alternative provisional 
doses as long as the predicted exposure increments are between 30% and 100% ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
The EWOC principle requires that the BLRM  recommended dose for the next cohort of subjects 
is the one with the highest posterior probabilit y of the DLT rate in the target DLT rate interval of 
[16%, 33%] among all doses fulfilling the overdose control constraint: there is less than 25 % of 
probability for the DLT rate  > 33% (probability for excessive or unacceptable toxicity).

18.3.1.  Measurability of Tumor at Baseline  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Definitions  
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized as measurable or nonmeasurable as 
follows:  
Measurable  
 Tumor lesions : Must be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (longest diameter 
in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
 10 mm by [CONTACT_20420] ( CT) scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater 
than 5 mm)  
 10-mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesi ons that cannot be accurately 
measured with cal ipers should be recorded as non measurable)  
 [ADDRESS_992293] X -ray 
 Measurable malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
meas urable, a lymph node must be ≥ [ADDRESS_992294] scan 
(CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5  mm).  At baseline 
(ie, screening for this study) and in follow -up (ie, all measurements past screening for 
this study), only the short axis will be measured and followed.  See also notes below 
on “Baseline documentation of target and nontarget lesions ” for information on 
lymph n ode measurement  
Nonmeasurable  
All other lesions, including sm all lesions (longest diameter <  10 mm or pathological lymph 
nodes with ≥ 10 to <  15 mm short axis ), as well as truly nonmeasurable lesions.  Lesions 
considered truly nonmeasurable include  leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial 
effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, and abdominal 
masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_86122].  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Special Considerations Regarding Lesion Measurability  
Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated with local thera py requi re particular 
comment.  
Bone Lesions  
 Bone scan, positron emission tomography scan , or plain films are not considered 
adequate imaging techniques to measure bone lesions.  However, these techniques 
can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone  lesions.  
 Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components, that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_12783] -sectional imaging techniques such as CT 
Protocol  DS3032 -A-U101  
Version 4.0 04 FEB 2020 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 126 or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be considered as measurable lesions if the  
soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability described above.  
 Blastic bone lesions are nonmeasurable.  
Cystic Lesions  
 Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (nei ther measurable nor nonmeasurable) since they 
are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
 “Cystic lesions ” thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions if they meet the definition of measurability described above .  
However, if non cystic lesions are present in the same subject, these are preferred for 
selection as target lesions.  
Lesions with Prior Local Treatment  
 Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other 
loco-regional therapy, are not co nsidered measurable unless there has been 
demonstrated progression in the lesion.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Specifications by [CONTACT_129918]  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Measurement of Lesions  
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation using calipers if clinically assessed.  All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and NEVER 
more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Method of Assessment  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up.  Imaging -based evaluation 
should always be performed  rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed 
cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
CT, MRI : CT is the  best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected 
for response assessment.  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_992295] slic e thickness 
greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  
An MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (eg,  for body scans).  
18.3.2.  Tumor Response Evaluation  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Assessment of Overall Tumor Burden and Measurable  Disease  
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor 
burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements.  In this study, only 
subjects with measurable disease at baseline should  be included in the study.

Page 127 [IP_ADDRESS].  Baseline Documentation of “Target ” and “Nontarget ” Lesions  
When more than 1 measurable lesion is present at baseline , all lesions up to a maximum of 
5 lesions total (representative of all involved organs ) should be identified as target lesions and 
will be recorded and measured at baseline (this means in instances where subjects have only 1 or 
2 organ sites involved a maximum of 2 and 4 lesions respectively will be recorded).  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does 
not lend itself t o reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion that 
can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures that may be 
visible by [CONTACT_726588].  As noted above, pathological nodes that are 
defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the  criterion of a short 
axis of   ≥ [ADDRESS_992296] in 
which the image is obtained (for CT scan , this is almost always the axi al plane; for MRI , the 
plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal, or coronal).  The smaller of these measures is the 
short axis.  For example, an abdominal node that is reported as being 20 mm × 30 mm has a 
short axis of 20 mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node.  In this example, 20 mm 
should be recorded as the node measurement.  All other pathological  nodes (those with short axis 
≥ 10 mm but <  15 mm) should be considered non target les ions.  Nodes that have a short axis 
< 10 mm are considered non pathological and should not be recorded or followed.  
A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported a s the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease.  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) , including pathological lymph no des, should be identified as 
nontarget lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required , and 
these lesions should b e followed as “present ,” “absent ,” or in rare cases “unequivocal 
progression .”  In addition, it is possible to record multiple nontarget lesions involving the same 
organ as a single ite m on the case record form (eg, “ multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes ” or 
“multiple liver metastases ”).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Response Criteria  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine the objective tumor 
response for target lesions.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target les ions.  Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or nontarget) must ha ve reduction in short axis to <  10 mm.  
Protocol  DS3032 -A-U101  
Version 4.0 04 FEB 2020 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 128 Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking 
as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
Progre ssive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum mu st also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note: the appearance of 1 or more new lesions is also 
considered progression).  
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, takin g as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Special Notes on the Assessment of Target Lesions  
Lymph nodes : Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short axis 
measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), 
even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study.  This means that when lymph nodes  are 
included as target lesions, the “ sum” of lesions may not be zero even if CR criteria are met, since 
a normal lymph node is defi ned as having a short axis of < 10 mm.  For PR, SD, and PD, the 
actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included  in the sum of target lesions.  
Target lesions that become “too small to measure” : While on study, all lesions (nodal and 
non-nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each 
subsequent evaluation, even when very small (eg,  2 mm).  However, sometimes lesions or lymph 
nodes that are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT scan that the 
radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report them as being 
“too small to measure .”  Whe n this occurs , it is important that a value be recorded on the eCRF.  
If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26191], the measurement 
should be recorded as 0 mm.  If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen b ut too 
small to measure, a default value of 5  mm should be assigned (Note : It is less likely that this rule 
will be used for lymph nodes since they usually have a definable size when normal and are 
frequently surrounded by [CONTACT_726589] m; however, if a lymph node is 
believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm 
should be assigned in this circumstance as well).  This default value is derived from the [ADDRESS_992297] slice thickness (but should not be  changed with varying CT slice thickness).  The 
measurement of these lesions is potentially nonreproducible ; therefore , providing this default 
value will prevent false responses or progressions based upon measurement error.  To reiterate, 
however, if the r adiologist is able to provide an actual measure, that should be recorded, even if 
it is below 5 mm.  
Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment : When non-nodal  lesions “ fragment ,” the longest 
diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to  calculate the target lesion sum.  
Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in 
obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion.  If the lesions have truly 
coalesced such that they are no longer  separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this 
instance should be the ma ximal longest diameter for the “ coalesced lesion .”

Page 129 [IP_ADDRESS].3.  Evaluation of Non target Lesions  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response fo r the 
group of nontarget lesions.  While some nontarget lesions may actually be measurable, they need 
not be measured and instead should be assessed only qualitatively at the time point s specified in 
the protocol.  
CR: Disappearance of all nontarget lesion s and normalization of tumor marker level.  All lymph 
nodes mus t be nonpathological in size (<  10 mm short axis).  
NonCR/NonPD : Persistence of 1 or more nontarget lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits.  
PD: Unequivocal progression (see comments below) of existing nontarget lesions (Note : the 
appearance of 1 or more new lesions is also considered progression).  
[IP_ADDRESS].4.  Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Nontarget Disease  
The concept of progression of nontarget disease r equires additional explanation as follows, when 
the subject also has measurable disease.  In this setting, to achieve “unequivocal progression ” on 
the basis of the nontarget disease, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in 
nontarget dise ase such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor 
burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest “increase”  in the 
size of 1 or more nontarget lesions is usually not sufficient to quality for  unequivocal progression 
status.  The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in nontarget disease 
in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.  
[IP_ADDRESS].5.  New Lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some 
comments on detection of new lesions are important.  There are no specific criteria for the 
identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be 
unequivocal , ie, not attribu table to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging 
modality , or findings thought to represent something other than tumor ( eg, some “new”  bone 
lesions may be simply healing or flare of preexisting lesions).  This is particularly important 
when th e subject’s baseline lesions show PR or CR.  For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may 
be rep orted on a CT scan report as a “new”  cystic lesion, which it is not.  
A lesion identified on a follow -up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.  An example of this is 
the subject who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain 
ordered that reveals metastases.  The subject’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of  
PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.  
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example , because of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow -up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease.  If re peat scans confirm there 
is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.

Page 130 [IP_ADDRESS].  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the study drug  until the 
end of treatment.  No confirmatory measurement for CR, PR, or SD is required in the study.  
The subject’s best overall response assignment will depend on the findings of both target and 
nontarget disease and will also take into consideration the appear ance of new lesions.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Time Point  Response  
It is assumed that at each protocol -specified time point , a response assessment occurs.

Any Any Yes PD 
CR = complete response; NE = inevaluable; PD = progressive disease; PR = partial response;  
SD = stable disease.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Missing Assessments and Inevaluable Designation  
When no imaging/measurement is performed  at all at a particular time point , the subject is not 
evaluable at that time point .  If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an assessment, 
usually the case is also considered not evaluable at that time point , unless a convincing argument 
can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the 
assigned time point  response.  This would be most likely to happen in the case of PD.  For 
example, if a subject had a baseline s um of [ADDRESS_992299] achieved PD 
status, regardless of the contribution of the missing lesion.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3.  Best Overall Response: All Time Point s 
The be st overall response is determined once all the data for the subject are known.  
Best response determination in studies where confirmation of CR or PR IS NOT required : Best 
response in these studies is defined as the best response across all time point s (eg,  a subject who 
Protocol  DS3032 -A-U101  
Version 4.[ADDRESS_992300] 
overall response of PR).  When SD is believed to be best response, it must also meet the 
protocol -specified minimum time from baseline, [ADDRESS_992301]’s best response depends on the 
subsequent assessments.  For example, a subject who has SD at first assessment, PD at second , 
and does not meet minimum duration for SD will have a best response of PD.  The same subject 
lost to follow -up after the first SD assessment would be considered inevaluable.  
[IP_ADDRESS].4.  Special Notes on Response Assessment  
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to “normal ” 
size (<  10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans.  This measurement should 
be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to overstate progression should it be 
based on increase in size of the nodes.  As noted earlier, this means that  subjects with CR may 
not have a total sum of “zero” on the eCRF.  
Subjects with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
“symptomatic  deterioration .”  Every effort should be made to document objective progression 
even after discontinuation of treatment.  Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an 
objective response: it is a reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_12003].  The objective resp onse status of 
such subjects is to be determined by [CONTACT_664247].  
For equivocal findings of progression (eg, very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic changes 
or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until t he next scheduled assessment.  If at 
the next scheduled assessment progression is confirmed, the date of progression should be the 
earlier date when progression was suspected.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Frequency of Tumor Reevaluation  
In this study, tumor measurement will be conducted every [ADDRESS_992302] 8 cycles and then every 3 cycles thereafter (start of Cycles  3, 5, 7, and 9, then 
Cycles 12, 15, etc.) until progression of disease, withdrawal of consent, death, or loss to 
follow -up.  Scan dates should not be adjusted or rescheduled due to dose interruption of any 
type.  
Baseline tumor assessments must be performed within 4 weeks (2 8 days) prior to the first dose of 
treatment.  
All efforts should be made to ensure consistency between  the baseline measurements and all 
subsequent measurements in reference to utilization of scanning method, equipment, technique 
(including slice thickness and field of view), and radiographic interpreter.  
The radiographic evaluation must include CT or MRI scanning of the chest, abdomen, and 
pelvis.  Any additional suspected sites of disease should also be imaged.  All evaluations should 
meet the standard of care for imaging of lesions in the respective organ(s) and should conform to 
the image acquisition gu idelines accordin g to institutional standards.  
All target and nontarget sites are evaluated at each time point  of tumor assessment.

Page 141 18.7. Extension Phase  
18.7.1.  Extension Phase Synopsis  
Objective of the Extension 
Phase:  The primary objective of the Extension Phase is to allow 
continuation of milademetan treatment for those subjects in the 
milademe tan Phase [ADDRESS_992317] tolerated the drug and 
whose disease has not progressed (ie, stable disease [SD] or 
better) at least 6 months after enrollment is completed in both 
parts . 
Design of the Extension Phase:  This is an open -label, nonrandomized extension phase of the 
main study phase, which is designed to allow subjects who have 
tolerated milademetan and demonstrated clinical benefit (SD or 
better) at the time of study closure during the main study phase 
to continue with milademetan monotherapy.  
Subjects will continue with the same dose of milademetan 
monotherapy treatment as in the main study phase until they 
commence new cancer therapy, experience unacceptable 
toxicity, withdraw consent, or have progressive disease.  
If study drug is withheld for  toxicity, periodic visits should 
continue to occur as clinically indicated.  These visits should 
include any procedures needed to ensure subject safety.  
Subjects enrolled in the Extension Phase will be assessed as 
outlined in Table  18.4.   
Data collected will be recorded in the individual, 
subject -specific electronic case report form (eCRF).  The extent 
or frequency of data collection into the eCRFs may be  reduced 
for the Extension Phase.  
Duration of the Extension 
Phase:  The start of the Extension Phase is at least 6  months after 
enrollment is completed in both Part 1 and Part 2.  Subjects who 
are receiving clinical benefit (SD or better) and have tolerated 
milademetan will continue to receive the drug.  It is not possible 
to predict the duration of the Extension Phase because subjects 
may continue treatment until disease progression, unacceptable 
toxicity, starting of new cancer therapy, or withdra wal of 
consent.  
Subject Eligibility:  Subjects must have tolerated milademetan and demonstrated 
clinical benefit (SD or better) at the time of closure of the main 
study phase (Part 1 and Part 2) in order to be eligible for this 
extended use phase of the st udy.

Page 142 Safety Evaluations:  Safety evaluations include adverse events, serious adverse 
events, clinical laboratory evaluations, physical examinations, 
vital signs, as needed.   ECGs may be done at investigator 
discretion, as clinically indicated.  
Dose:  Subjects who participate in the Extension Phase will continue to 
take milademetan at the same dose as was taken in the main 
study phase.  
Statistical Analyses:  Data collected during the Extension Phase will be listed and 
appended to the Clinical Study Repo rt.

CASE [ZIP_CODE]   Page 6    Version date: 6/10/[ADDRESS_1249307] two decades [1]. Selective internal radiation 
therapy (SIRT) with yttrium (Y)-90 is a well-established modality for palliative 
treatment of primary and metastatic liver malignancies and constitutes delivery of 
radioactive-emitting embolic microspheres through selection of arteries that directly 
feed the tumor. Radioembolization (RE) through this method achieves prolonged 
patient survival with limited systemic adverse effects and acceptable safety profile [2, 
3]. 
1.[ADDRESS_1249308] Y-90 Radioembolization Imaging 
Various imaging modalities including single-photon emission computed tomography 
(SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET), in combination with computed 
tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are incorporated as part of  
standard patient care after Y-90 RE to evaluate the distribution of radionuclide particles 
within the liver (and elsewhere in the body) and to calculate the radionuclide absorbed 
doses in the tumors, which in turn would permit optimal planning for continuation of 
patient’s care [4]. Accurate tumor Y-[ADDRESS_1249309]-Y-90 RE imaging with PET/CT has been proven to serve as a favorable modality 
for this purpose as it delivers better spatial resolution and higher precision in 
quantifying tumor absorbed doses. These advantages improve Y-90 RE treatment 
planning by [CONTACT_892085]-response and dose-toxicity data [5]. Hence, 
Y-90 PET/CT has become the modality of choice for post-Y-90 RE imaging in many 
centers across the US including our institute. Y-90 PET/MR is another imaging 
modality that may be performed after SIRT with Y-[ADDRESS_1249310] and determination of the liver/tumor contours, compared to Y-90 PET/CT 
imaging [6]. For this reason, post-Y-90 RE PET/MR is frequently performed at our 
institute, encompassing over 200 cases since 2016. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], Y-90 PET/CT still 
provides a better quantification of PET images, due to the better attenuation correction, 
and remains as the gold standard method [6]. This necessitates assessment of the 
validity of dosimetry results acquired by Y-90 PET/MR, in comparison to PET/CT 
imaging.  
1.[ADDRESS_1249311]-Y-90 RE dosimetry results between PET/CT and 
PET/MR imaging, the current investigators observed significant inconsistencies 
CASE [ZIP_CODE]   Page 7    Version date: 6/10/21 
 between  the two modalities; in other words, tumor absorbed doses were on average 
36% (SD = 43%) lower in PET/MR-based calculations than in PET/CT [7]. This 
resulted in PET/MR software upgrades which predominantly included a few 
improvements in the attenuation correction as well as the respi[INVESTIGATOR_892082]. I
n order to validate these PET/MR-based dosimetry upgrades, this protocol 
was 
designed including another pi[INVESTIGATOR_9416] 8 cases, to compare Y-90 dosimetry data 
between PET/CT and PET/MR. Given the promising results of the second pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] 
(IRB#17-[ADDRESS_1249312] of PET/MR Attenuation correction in Y90 dosimetry analysis 
compar
ed to PET/CT), the investigators are proposing this study (with similar design) 
to extend their research on more cases. 
 
2.[ADDRESS_1249313]-Y-90 RE absorbed doses (Gy) in the liver tumor 
tissues based on PET/CT versus PET/MR imaging. This objective would permit the 
comparison of Y-90 tumor absorbed doses, acquired from PET/MR, with the current 
standard 
of care PET/CT imaging to verify the data consistency and to validate its 
appli
cation for the prediction of tumor response to treatment. The endpoint for this 
objective would be the measurement of the reproducibility coefficient (RDC) between 
the two imaging modalities for post-Y-90 RE absorbed doses (Gy) in the liver tumor 
tissues (please see the Study Design for further details). 
2.[ADDRESS_1249314]-Y-90 RE absorbed doses (Gy) in the background 
liver tissues (surrounding tumors), based on PET/CT versus PET/MR imaging. This 
objective would permit the comparison of Y-90 background liver absorbed doses, 
acquired from PET/MR,  with the current standard of care PET/CT imaging to verify the 
data consistency and to validate its application for the prediction of dose toxicity. The 
endpoint
 for this objective would be the measurement of the RDC between the two 
imaging modalities for post-Y-90 RE absorbed doses (Gy) in the background liver 
tissues (please see the Study Design for further details).

TUDY DESIGN 
3.1 Number of Subjects 
Upon IRB approval and patient’s informed consent, 12 new consecutive cases will be 
enrolled in the study. The sample size calculation (n = 12) is based on the fact that the 
CASE [ZIP_CODE]   Page 8    Version date: 6/10/21 
 RDC should be < 5% for clinical use.  The following table summarizes the  estimated  
upper 95% confidence bound for the RDC as a function of the unknown RDC.  Based 
on this table  and our expectation that our new technique will have an excellent 
reproducib ility with PET , a sample size of 12 will provide sufficient precision  to 
determine if the RDC with our new technique is near 5%.

3.2 Study Protocol 
 
The study protocol is outlined in the diagram below. Upon the patient’s informed 
consent and eligibility approval (according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria below) 
for participation in the trial, they undergo PET/CT (standard imaging) and PET/MR 
(additional imaging), within [ADDRESS_1249315], based on the availability of the imaging device, and less than 1 hour 
apart. This limited time threshold allows to ignore the trivial amounts of β− decay in 
radionuclide emission that happens after trans-arterial delivery of Y-90 microspheres 
into the liver, with regards to its half-life of ~64 hours. Upon acquirement and 
construction of PET/CT and PET/MR images, a software (MIM SurePlan LiverY90) 
would be utilized for semi-automatic determination of the liver/tumor contours and 
calculation of the Y-90 absorbed doses (Gy) in the regions of interest (including within 
tumor and background liver outlines) using the Local Deposition Method.  
 
Dosimetry/volumetry data from the two modalities from these cases, in addition to the 
results from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_389164] (IRB#17-[ADDRESS_1249316] of PET/MR Attenuation correction in 
Y90 dosimetry analysis compared to PET/CT ; similar protocol design), w ill be 
compared using the Bland Altman method to assess the pattern of differences between 
dosimetr
y values and to measure the reproducibility of the methods [8]. The RDC is 
the minimum difference between the two measurements that can be considered a true 
difference, with 95% confidence.  It will be calculated as 2.[ADDRESS_1249317] 
SD (wS
D), where wSD is the square root of the mean variance across the N subjects, 
and the variance for each subject is calculated from the ir two dosimetry values [9,10] . 
In addition, the reproducibility coefficient will also be expressed as a percentage of a 
subje
ct’s PET/CT value of dose, using the within-subject coefficient of variation 
CASE [ZIP_CODE]   Page 9    Version date: 6/10/21 
 (wCV) instead of wSD . An upper 95% confidence bound for the RDC will be 
constructed using a chi square statistic as the pi[INVESTIGATOR_325618], as follows: 
2.77 × √𝑁 ×  %𝑤𝐶 𝑉2/𝜒𝑀,𝛼2, where 𝜒𝑀,𝛼2 is the 𝛼th percentile of the chi square 
distribution with N degrees of freedom. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.[ADDRESS_1249318] Participation 
The study involves one-time PET/MR imaging in addition to the standard PET/CT 
imaging, both performed on the same day of the treatment procedure (Y-90 RE). Upon 
completion of the imaging procedures, the patient’s involvement in the study would be 
completed. The researchers, however, will need to access the patient’s medical records 
to record basic medical information including the patient demographics, diagnosis, and 
treatment and to analyze the imaging data and dosimetry.

6.0 POTENTIAL RISKS 
6.1 Adverse effects 
 
The additional PET/MR imaging in this study does not involve any extra radiation to 
the patient, besides what one would receive as part of the standard protocol during Y-
90 RE and PET/CT imaging. There are no known biological risks associated with 
PET/MRI.  A PET/MRI procedure may cause possible anxiety in some individuals, due 
to t
he confined space of the testing area resulting in feelings of claustrophobia and the 
loud banging made by [CONTACT_101488]. The patients retain the right to withdraw from 
participating in the study in such conditions. 
Since the MRI is a powerful magnet, patients cannot be scanned if they have certain 
metal devices in their body.  There is also a risk of injury if metal is brought into the 
imaging room, which may be pulled into the magnet.  Patients will be asked to remove 
any magnetic objects from their clothes and body in order to prevent any injuries.  A 
safety zone is established around the MR scanner to prevent objects containing iron 
from coming into contact [CONTACT_521627]. 
6.2 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) 
This protocol wil
l adhere to the policies of the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center 
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan in accordance with NCI guidelines.

  1.0 OBJECTIVES 
 
1.1 Primary Objective  The primary objective of this study is  to assess the response rate (confirmed complete 
and partial response) of patients with locally advanced or metastatic papi[INVESTIGATOR_461454] 197 or ARQ 197 combined with erlotinib . 
 1.2 Secondary Objectives  
 a. To assess the progression free survival (PFS) of patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic papi[INVESTIGATOR_461455] [ADDRESS_590534] common histologic type - clear cell carcinoma (cRCC) which on the molecular level is characterized by [CONTACT_461477] -HIF-VEGF pathway.  Papi[INVESTIGATOR_10928] (pRCC) is the second most common histologic 
subset of kidney cancer and accounts for 15% of cases.  Among non- clear cell histology pRCC 
constitutes about 50% of cases.  pRCC is associated with different molecul ar characteristics than 
cRCC. C-Met proto- oncogene mutations have been identified in patients with familial and sporadic 
cases of pRCC and implicated in its pathophysiology. (
1, 2) In preclinical models c -Met inhibitors 
showed activity against several hereditary  papi[INVESTIGATOR_461456]- related mutations  and 
tumor xenografts.  (3)  While the treatment of advanced cRCC has undergone dramatic changes 
with the introduction of receptor tyrosine kinase (rTKI) and m -TOR inhibitors, management of 
pRCC and other non- clear cell histologies remains undefined.  There have been no published 
clinical trials specifically evaluating the effects of these new compounds in pRCC, but the analysis  
of clinical trials that allowed treatment of various RCC histologies provides some insight into their efficacy in pRCC. In an expanded access trial of sunitinib in RCC, 276 patients (11.8% of total) with non- clear cell histologies were identified.  A majority of them had prior cytokine therapy. 
Unfortunately this trial did not differentiate between the different non- clear cell subtypes, but 
based on prevalence it is likely that pRCC constituted a significant fraction of these patients.  A response rate of 5.4% and median PFS of 6.7 months were noted.  (
4)  A small Phase II trial of 
sunitinib in patients with non- clear cell RCC enrolled 26 patients (including 13 patients with 
pRCC).  There were no objective responses and median PFS was 48 days. (5)  Choueiri reported 
on the efficacy of sunitinib and sorafenib in metastatic non- clear cell RCC.  (6)  This retrospective 
analysis identified 53 patients who had been treated with either sunitinib or sorafenib at five 
different cancer centers in the [LOCATION_003] and [LOCATION_009].  The number of patients with pRCC was 41, of which 23 had received prior systemic therapy (non- VEGF targeted).  Of the 41 patients with 
pRCC, 13 were treated with sunitinib.  Response rate was 15% and median PFS was 7.[ADDRESS_590535] median PFS of 11.9 months (compared to 5.1 months if tr eated with sorafenib p<0.001). The m -TOR inhibitor 
temsirolimu s was evaluated in previously untreated patients with metastatic RCC who had  
 S1107

  unfavorable clinical characteristics. (7) This study  included a significant number of patients with 
non-clear cell histology. In a subset analysis that included 55 patients  withpRCC, median PFS was  
7 months.  These outcomes in patients with non- clear RCC compare with the RR of 39% and 
median PFS of 11 months reported in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_461457].  (8)  Dual c -MET/VEGFR -2 inhibitor foretinib demonstrated 13.5% response rate and 
median PFS of 9.3 months.  Responses were significantly more common in patients with germline mutations. (
9) Overall the analysis of available data suggests that clinical benefit of targeted 
agents, although present in pRCC, is inferior to the one observed in clear cell histology.  
 Preclinical data indicates that absence of VHL mutations (VHL mutations are typi[INVESTIGATOR_461458]) is associated with greater activity of epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) inhibitors in 
RCC.  (
10)  Based on that observation, the oral EGFR inhibitor erlotinib has been evaluated in a 
Phase II trial of patients with metastatic pRCC in SWOG .  (11)  Patients with histologically 
confirmed advanced or metastatic pRCC received erlotinib at 150 mg po q day until disease progression.  Thirty nine patients were evaluable for response.  With a median follow -up of 12.8 
months ; four patients had confirmed PR for RR of 10%.  Median overall survival was 26.9 months.   
Probability of freedom from treatment failure at 6 months was 29%.  There was one Grade 5 adverse event (AE) of pneumonitis and one Grade 4 thrombotic event. As expected only two patients (2/35) demonstrated mutations in vHL gene confirming that pRCC is typi[INVESTIGATOR_461459] -type vHL.  All but one specimen stained positive for EGFR (17/18) but no association 
was observed between EGFR score or staining intensity with clinical outcome. This suggests that mutational status, receptor amplification or differential intracellular signaling mechanisms may play a more significant role in predicting clinical benefit from EGFR -directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. These 
findings were consistent with those of EGFR therapy in other diseases.  Overall results of this study demonstrated activity of erlotinib in patients with pRCC and in the absence of an obvious 
superior alternative support further evaluation of erlotinib either alone or in combination with therapi[INVESTIGATOR_461460] s in patients with pRCC.   
 ARQ [ADDRESS_590536] therapy.  (
12)  Thirty eight patients were enrolled.  The most frequent treatment -related side effects were 
fatigue (24%), diarrhea (21%) and constipation (21%).  Grade 3 or greater events possibly or 
probably related to ARQ 197 included elevations of ALP (3%), ALT (3%), AST (3%).  No DLT was observed.  Two patients achieved partial response and 19 had stable disease.  Recent evidence suggests that c -Met signaling promotes resistance to EGFR  inhibition by [CONTACT_461478]3 
(HER3) -dependent PI3K activation and dual EGFR and c -Met inhibition has been proposed as a 
strategy to overcome resistance to EGFR -inhibition.   A Phase I dose escalation trial of ARQ 197 
and erlotinib in patients with advanced solid tumors has been conducted.  Erlotinib was given at 150 mg daily and ARQ 197 was escalated from 120 mg BID to 360 mg BID.  Twenty -five patients 
were treated and minor tumor regressions were seen in four out of ten evaluable patients.  Pharmacokinetic  data revealed no evidence of drug- drug interaction.  Two patients experienced 
serious adverse events including neutropenia and sinus bradycardia but no DLTs were reported.  Continuous therapy with erlotinib and ARQ 197 appeared to be well tolerated and a Phase II combination dose (RP2D) of ARQ 197 of 360 mg BID and erlotinib of 150 mg daily was recommended. (
13) 
 The combination of two tyrosine kinase inhibitors  (TKIs),  erlotinib  and ARQ -197, which respectively 
target EGFR  and MET was tested in the ACHN renal papi[INVESTIGATOR_461461].  This cell line 
harbors a base substitution in the MET gene at T1010I, which appears to confer a growth advantage compared to wild- type expression.   Dose response curves were conducted to 
determine the activity of each agent.   The ACHN cell line expresses high protein levels of both 
EGFR and MET, which are both active under normal culturing conditions.   ACHN cells were 
responsive to either agent individually, particularly to ARQ -197 with a 50%  inhibitory concentration 
(IC50) of ~0.8uM.   Median Effect analysis was conducted to determine the interaction of the 
agents.   At all dose levels tested, the combined treatment outperformed either individual agent, 
and was additive to synergistic at the effective doses tested.   Erlotinib treatment   
 S1107

  of ACHN cells at a 2uM dose (24h) resulted in reduced phosphorylation of EGFR, concomitant 
with increase a small in MET activity.   At this dose, erlotinib had negligible impact on 
phosphorylation of downstream s ignal transduction factors AKT and ERK.   ARQ -197 resulted in 
diminished activity and protein levels of MET accompanied by [CONTACT_461479].  Additionally, ARQ -197 ablated p- EGFR, although not to the extent observed by 
[CONTACT_13429] .  The combination of the two agents further reduced both pAKT and pERK compared to 
ARQ -197 alone, and synergized with erlotinib to inhibit EGFR phosphorylation. (Personal Written 
Communication, January 201, PC Mack, Ph.D., PN Lara, Jr., M.D., UC Davis Cancer Center)  
 
Based on erlotinib activity data in pRCC and preclinical studies indicating activity of c -Met 
inhibitors in pRCC and important interplay between EGFR and c -Met pathways we propose to 
conduct a randomized Phase II trial of ARQ 197 alone and in combination with erlotinib.  (

Specifically, ARQ [ADDRESS_590537] pRCC with an acceptable toxicity profile.

Reported Adverse Events and Potential Risks : 
 
Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (C AEPR)  for OSI-
774 (erlotinib, NSC 718781)  
 The Comprehensive Adverse Event and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of reported and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a uniform presentation of events by [CONTACT_297148]. In addition to the 
comprehensive list, a subset, the Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited, Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and is identified with bold and italicized text. This subset of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that are protocol specific exceptions to expedited reporting to NCI via CTEP- AERS (except as 
noted below).  Refer  to the 'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting 
Requirements' 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/aeguidelines.pdf  
for further clarification.  Frequency is provided based on 3, 622 patients.  Below is 
the CAEPR for OSI-774 (erlotinib).  
 
NOTE : Report AEs on the SPEER ONLY IF  they exceed the grade noted in 
parentheses next to the AE in the SPEER.  If this CAEPR is part  of a combination 
protocol using multiple investigational agents and has an AE listed on different SPEERs, use the lower of the grades to determine if expedited reporting is required.

Note : OSI-774
 (erlotinib)  in combination with other agents could cause an 
exacerbation of any adverse event currently known to be caused by [CONTACT_6767], or the combination may result in events never previously associated with either agent.  
 Note:  OSI-774
 (erlotinib) -induced diarrhea and/or vomiting has been associated 
with dehydration, hyperkalemia; hypocalcemia; hypokalemia; hypomagnesemia; hyponatremia; hypophosphatemia, increased creatinine, and renal failure.  
 Note:  Cases of hepatic failure and hepatorenal syndrome (including fatalities) 
have been reported during use of OSI-774
 (erlotinib)  in patients with baseline 
hepatic impairment.   
 Warning:  Treatment with erlotinib  should  be used with extra caution in 
patients with total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_590539].  Patients with hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > ULN or Child -Pugh A, B and C) should be closely 
monitored during therapy with erlotinib .  Erlotinib  dosing should be 
interrupted or  discontinued if changes in liver function are severe such as 
doubling of total bilirubin and/or tripling of transaminases in the setting of pretreatment values outside normal range.  
 Warning:  Cases of hepatic failure and hepatorenal syndrome (including fatalities) have been reported during use of erlotinib , particularly in patients 
with baseline hepatic impairment.  Therefore, periodic liver function testing (transaminases, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase) is recommended.  In the setting of worsening liver function tests, dose interruption and/or dose  
 S1107 
 Page 17 
 Version Date 5/10/[ADDRESS_590540] monitoring should be 
considered.  Erlotinib  dosing should be interrupted or discontinued if total 
bilirubin is > [ADDRESS_590541] and/or transaminases are > [ADDRESS_590542] in  the setting of 
normal pretreatment values.  
 Warning:  Cases of hepatorenal syndrome, acute renal failure (including fatalities), and renal insufficiency have been reported.  Some were secondary to baseline hepatic impairment while others were associated with severe dehydration due to diarrhea, vomiting, and/or anorexia or concurrent chemotherapy use.  In the event of dehydration, particularly in patients with contributing risk factors for renal failure (e.g., pre -existing 
renal disease, medical conditions or medications that may lead to renal 
disease, or other predisposing conditions including advanced age), erlotinib  therapy should be interrupted and appropriate measures should 
be taken to intensively rehydrate the patient.  Periodic monitoring of renal function and serum electrolytes is recommended in patients at risk of 
dehydration.  
 Gastrointestinal Perforation: Patients receiving erlotinib are at increased risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_461463], which was observed uncommonly. Some cases had a fatal outcome.  Patients receiving concomitant anti -angiogenic 
agents, corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and/or taxane based chemotherapy, or who have prior history of peptic ulceration or diverticular disease, are at increased risk. Erlotinib should be permanently  discontinued in patients who develop 
gastrointestinal perforation.  
 Bullous and Exfoliative Skin Disorders: Bullous, blistering and exfoliative skin 
conditions have been reported, including very rare cases suggestive of Stevens -
Johnson syndrome/Toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194], which in some cases were fatal. Erlotinib treatment should be interrupted or discontinued if the patient develops severe bullous, blistering, or exfoliating conditions.  
 Ocular Disorders: Very rare cases of corneal perforation or ulceration have been 
reported during use of erlotinib. Other ocular disorders including abnormal eyelash growth, keratoconjunctivitis sicca or keratitis have been observed with erlotinib treatment and are known risk factors for corneal perforation/ulceration. Erlotinib therapy should be interrupted or discontinued if patients present with 
acute/worsening ocular disorders such as eye pain.  
 
Potential Drug Interactions :  Erlotinib is both protein bound (92% to 95%) and 
metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4.  Therefore, a potential for drug- drug interactions exists 
when erlotinib is co- administered with drugs that are highly protein- bound or 
CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers.  
 There is a potential interaction between erlotinib and warfarin. Patients have experienced elevated INRs and bleeding with this combination of drugs. Patients on warfarin and erlotinib should have more frequent INR/PT determinations (e.g., weekly for the first month and weekly for a minimum of 2 weeks following discontinuation erlotinib).  
 Proton Pump Inhibitor:  Erlotinib's solubility decreases as the pH increases. Co-
administration of omeprazole with erlotinib will decrease the AUC and C
max by 46% 
and 61%, respectively.  
 
 S1107 
 Page 18 
 Version Date 5/10/[ADDRESS_590543]: Avoid concomitant use of erlotinib with gastric acid reducing agents 
if possib le.  When ranitidine 300 mg is given with erlotinib, erlotinib AUC and Cmax  
decrease by 33% and 54%, respectively.  Increasing the dose of erlotinib will not 
compensate the loss of exposure.  However, if an H2- antagonist receptor is 
needed, take erlotinib at least [ADDRESS_590544] administration.  Dosing such, erlotinib loss of exposure is minimized to AUC of 15% and Cmax of 17% . 
 
Patient Care Implications :  If the patient vomits after taking the tablets, the dose is 
replaced only if the tablets can actually be seen and counted.  
 Patients should wear sun screen protection, hat, and long sleeves to avoid sun as 
it can exacerbate skin rash.  
 Patients should be advised to stop smoking while taking erlotinib.  Smoking induc es CYP1A2 enzymes and alters erlotinib exposure by 64%  
 
Pregnancy and Lactation :  No information on pregnancy and lactation in humans 
is available yet.  
 
c. PHARMACOLOGY  
 Total clearance of erlotinib is similar to hepatic blood flow in dogs and rats.  At intravenous doses > 1 mg/kg the clearance decreases and the plasma drug 
exposure increases supra- proportionately in rats and dogs.  In vitro, the agent is 
slowly oxidized by [CONTACT_57136].  Erlotinib is extensively metabolized in rats and dogs with only a small amount excreted unchanged in urine, bile and feces.  
In a rat model designed to study pulmonary first pass extraction, erlotinib had a pulmonary extraction of approximately 48%.  In vitro studies have shown that the agent is metabolized by [CONTACT_097]1A1, which is expressed in lung tissue.  Several circulating metabolites have been identified in mouse, rat and dog and subsequently synthesized and demonstrated to be potent as EGFR inhibitors.  Only one, OSI -420, a hydroxylated metabolite, was a major metabolite in 
systemic circulation with a metabolite: parent ratio of 1:4 in plasma from rats or dogs given oral doses.  This compound is as potent as erlotinib in the in vivo tumor xenograft model.  
 
The enzymes responsible for formation of the major metabolite in humans were 
identified as cytochromes P450 3A4 and 3A5 (expressed in liver) and 1A1 (expressed in lung). Studies on the inhibition potential of erlotinib and its major metabolite, OSI -420, on the main human cytochrome P450 isoenzymes revealed 
a relatively  strong inhibition of CYP 3A4 by [CONTACT_13429] (Ki 8 µM) and a weak 
inhibition of CYPs 1A2 and 3A4 by [CONTACT_8230] -420 (Ki 20 µM). Further studies to 
evaluate the mechanism of inhibition are ongoing.  
 Oral bio -availability was found to be 77% in rats and 88% in dogs.  Plasma 
protein binding is 92 - 95% in humans, rats, monkeys and mice, and was 85% in 
dogs.  
 
How Supplied :  Erlotinib is supplied as 25 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg white film -
coated tablets.  In addition to the active ingredient, erlotinib, the tablets contain lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, sodium lauryl sulfate, 
and magnesium stearate.  Tablets are unmarked and unscored.  The 25 mg tablets [1/4 inch diameter, 3 mm deep (formerly non- film coated)], 100 mg tablets 
(11/32 inch diameter, 5 mm deep), and 150 mg tablets (13/32 inch diameter, 5.1 mm deep) are supplied 30 tablets/bottle.

 8.5 ARQ 197 Dose Modification 
 If ARQ  197 is held, erlotinib will also be held for patients on Arm 2 and resumed at the 
same time treatment with ARQ 197 is resumed.  There will be no dose reduction of erlotinib if the toxicity was thought to be related to ARQ 197.  
 a. Hematologic toxicities:  
        
* Treatment may be held up to 21 days and can be resumed at the next lower dose level once ANC is ≥ 1000x10

  8.6 Erlotinib Dose Modificationa  
 
 
                                 
(a) Doses that have been reduced should not be re- escalated.  Any patient who fails to 
tolerate treatment at 50 mg/day will discontinue erlotinib and continue on single agent 
ARQ 197.  (b) If the event does not resolve to Grade 0 or 1 within 21 days, erlotinib will be 
discontinued and patient will continue on a single agent ARQ 197 (c) Only if ≥ [ADDRESS_590566] Reduction Second Reduction  
    
 
150 mg/day  100 mg/day  50 mg/day   
 
 
NOTE: Any patient who fails to tolerate erlotinib at 50 mg/day will continue on single agent 
ARQ 197. If a treatment is delayed more than 21 days for the resolution of  erlotinib -
related toxicities to Grade 0 or 1, discontinue erlotinib and continue ARQ 197 alone.  
 Toxicity  
(NCI CTCAE v4.0)  Dose Modification  
Diarrhea  
Grade 1  None.  Initiate therapy with lop eramide.(8.7a)  
Grade 2  Hold erlotinib.  Initiate loperamide until resolution to Grade 0 -1.  
Resume therapy at the same dose.  
Grade 3b or 4b Hold erlotinib.  Initiate therapy with loperamide and appropriate 
supportive care until resolution to Grade 0 or 1 and then restart 
at 1 dose level lower  
Rash  
Grade 1  None  
Grade 2  None. Initiate treatment (8.7b).   If rash persists and is 
intolerable or worsens over 10 – 14 days, then reduce by 1 
dose level.  
Grade 3  Reduce by 1 dose level.  If rash persists or wor sens over 10 – 
14 days, then interrupt erlotinib until resolution to Grade 0, 1 or 
2 and then restart 1 dose level lower.  
Grade 4  Permanently discontinue erlotinib.  
Interstitial Lung Disease  
Any Grade  If ILD is suspected, erlotinib should be interrupted  immediately 
pending diagnostic evaluation.  If ILD is diagnosed, erlotinib 
should be discontinued permanently and appropriate treatment 
instituted as necessary.  
Other Toxicities Attributable to Erlotinib  
Grade 1 or 2  None  
Grade 3 or 4 b, c Interrupt e rlotinib until resolution to Grade 0 or 1 and then restart 
1 dose level lower.  
Other Toxicities (hematologic and non -hematologic) attributable to ARQ 197  
Grade 1 or 2  None  
Grade 3 or 4  Hold erlotinib until ARQ 197 is resumed. If toxicity was deemed 
related to ARQ 197 no dose reduction of erlotinib is indicated  
 S1107 
 Page 28 
 Version Date 5/10/[ADDRESS_590567] been rare reports of hypokalemia and/or acute renal failure (including fatalities), secondary to severe dehydration, renal function and serum electrolytes (including potassium) should be monitored in this setting.  
 b. Rash/skin toxicity . Patients should be informed that skin toxicity is to be expected 
during treatment with erlotinib.  Skin toxicity may take the form of dry skin, rash, acneiform eruption, or hair or nail changes.  Prophylactic treatment of the skin may prevent or reduce skin toxicity.  The patient should be encouraged to use an 
alcohol -free, emollient cream applied twice a day to the entire body as soon as 
the patient starts therapy with erlotinib.  Creams and ointments are recommended because they have a greater ability to retain moisture than lotions.  Examples of suitable emollient creams include:  Neutrogena
® Norwegian formula, SARNA® 
Ultra, Vanicream™, Aveeno® (fragrance- free formulation), and Eucerin® cream.  
Other over -the-counter aqueous creams or emulsifying ointments may also 
provide symptomatic benefit.  Lotions should be avoided because they often contain alcohol, which will dry the skin.  Patients should also be encouraged to use a titanium dioxide or zinc oxide- based sunscreen product applied to sun-
exposed areas twice per day.  
 
Patients who develop skin toxicity and are symptomatic should be treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_300793].  If needed, oral minocycline or oral doxycycline may be combined with the topi[INVESTIGATOR_8588].  A topi[INVESTIGATOR_461467].  For more 
severe rash, oral corticosteroids may be beneficial.  Patients who fail to respond to these measures may have the dose of erlotinib interrupted or reduced.   
 
Minocycline is known to interfere with anticoagulants and oral contraceptives.  
Patients treated with minocycline who are taking anticoagulants and/or oral contraceptives should be monitored accordingly.  
 
Bullous, blistering and exfoliative skin conditions have been reported, including cases suggestive of Stevens -Johnson syndrome/toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194], 
which in some cases were fatal.  Interrupt or discontinue erlotinib treatment if the patient develops severe bullous, blistering, or exfoliating conditions.   
 c. Ocular Disor ders.  Corneal perforation or ulceration has been reported during use 
of erlotinib.  Other ocular disorders including abnormal eyelash growth, keratoconjunctivitis sicca or keratitis have been observed with erlotinib treatment and are known risk factors for corneal ulceration/perforation.  Interrupt or discontinue erlotinib therapy if patients present with acute/worsening ocular disorders such as eye pain.

  10.0 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION AND ENDPOINT DEFINITIONS  
 
10.1 Measurability of lesions  
 
a. Measurable disease : Measurable disease is defined differently for lymph nodes 
compared with other disease and will be addressed in a separate section below.  
 
1. Lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension 
(longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ 2.[ADDRESS_590572] x -ray, by ≥ 1.[ADDRESS_590573] or MRI scans, or ≥ 1.[ADDRESS_590574] be recorded in decimal fractions of centimeters (or millimeters).  
 
The defined measurability of lesions on CT scan is based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 0.[ADDRESS_590575] slice thickness greater than 0.5 cm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.   
 
2. Malignant lymph nodes  are to be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable if it  measures ≥ 1.5 cm in SHORT AXIS (greatest diameter 
perpendicular to the long axis of the lymph node) when assessed by [CONTACT_39710] (CT scan slice recommended being no greater than 0.5 cm).  
 
b. Non-measurable disease :  All other lesions (or sites of disease), incl uding small 
lesions (longest diameter < 1.0 cm or pathologic lymph nodes with ≥ 1.0 cm to <  
1.5 cm short axis), are considered non- measurable disease.  Bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmoni tis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not 
followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered non- measurable as are previously 
radiated lesions that have not progressed.  
 
c. Notes on measurability  
 
1. For CT and MRIs, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should by [CONTACT_39711]- hold scanning 
techniques, if possible.  
 2. PET-CT:  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of 
a PET -CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with 
RECIST measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a 
diagnostic CT, then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for 
RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT.  
 3. Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a method of measurement.  
 4. Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they are, by [CONTACT_39712].  
 5. If a target lesion becomes very small some radiologists indicate that it is too small to measure.  If the lesion is actually still present, a default measurement of 0.[ADDRESS_590576] believes the lesion has gone, a default measurement of 0.0cm should be recorded.  
 S1107

 Version Date 5/10/16 
 
 
   
10.2 Objective status at each disease evaluation    
 
Objective Status is to be recorded at each evaluation. All measurable lesions up to a 
maximum of 2 lesions per organ 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, 
should be identified as target  lesions at baseline. All other lesions (or sites of  disease) 
including any measurable lesions over and above the [ADDRESS_590577] be noted for non- target measurable and non-
measurable disease.   
 For studies that use disease progression as an endpoint, whole body scanning at specific 
intervals is necessary to determine that progression is NOT present outside of the “target” areas. Therefore, in these studies it is not acceptable to image only the “target” areas of the body in follow -up scans. For study -specific imaging requirements, see the Study 
Calendar in 
Section 9.0 .   
 
a. Complete Response (CR):   Complete disappearance of all target and non- target 
lesions (with the exception of lymph nodes mentioned below).  No new lesions.  No disease related symptoms.   Any lymph nodes (whether target or non- target) 
must have reduction in short axis to < 1.[ADDRESS_590578] be assessed using the same technique as baseline.  
 
b. Partial Response (PR):  Applies only to patients with at least one measurable 
lesion. Greater than or equal to 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of appropriate diameters of all target measurable lesions.  No unequivocal progr ession of non- measurable disease.  No new lesions.  All target measurable 
lesions must be assessed using the same techniques as baseline.  
 
c. Stable:  Does not qualify for CR, PR, Progression or Symptomatic Deterioration.  
All target measurable lesions must  be assessed using the same techniques as 
baseline.  
 
d. Progression : One or more of the following must occur:  20% increase in the sum 
of appropriate diameters of target measurable lesions over smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease during therapy) using the same techniques as baseline, as well as an absolute increase of at least 0.5 cm.  Unequivocal progression of non- measurable disease in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_33398] (an explanation must be provided).   Appearance of any new lesion/s ite.  
Death due to disease without prior documentation of progression and without symptomatic deterioration (see 
Section 10.2e ). 
  Notes regarding new lesions:  FDG -PET imaging can complement regular scans 
in identifying new lesions according to the following algorithm.  
 
1. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a 
sign of progression based on a new lesion.  
 2. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up 
corresponding to a potential new site of disease must have a 
confirmation by [CONTACT_39713] (e.g. CT, MRI, x -ray) as new site 
of disease to be considered progressive disease.  In such a case, the date of progressive disease will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -
PET.   
 S1107 
 Page 34 
 Version Date 5/10/16 
 
 
   
e. Symptomatic deterioration :  Global deterioration of health status requiring 
discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of progression.  Efforts 
should be made to obtain objective evidence of progression after discontinuation.  
 
f. Assessmen t inadequate, objective status unknown .  Progression or 
symptomatic deterioration has not been documented, and one or more target measurable lesions have not been assessed or inconsistent assessment methods were used.  
 g. Objective status notes:  
 
1. Non- measurable and non- target measurable disease do not affect 
Objective Status  in determination of CR (must be absent --a patient who 
otherwise has a CR, but who has non- measurable or non- target 
measurable disease present or not assessed, will be classified as having 
a PR). However, non- measurable and non- target lesions are included in 
determination of progression (if new sites of disease develop or if unequivocal progression occurs in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_021]).  
 2. An objective status of PR or stable cannot follow one of CR.  Stable can follow PR only in the rare case that tumor increases too little to qualify as progression, but enough that a previously documented 30% decrease no longer holds.  
 3. In cases for which initial flare reaction is possi ble (hypercalcemia, 
increased bone pain, erythema of skin lesions), objective status is not progression unless either symptoms persist beyond [ADDRESS_590579] Response  This is calculated from the sequence of objective statuses.  
 a. CR:  Two or more objective statuses of CR a minimum of four weeks apart documented before progression or symptomatic deterioration.  
 S1107 
 Page 35 
 Version Date 5/10/16 
 
 
   
b. PR: Two or more objective statuses of PR or better a minimum of four weeks apart documented before progression or symptomatic deterioration, but not qualifying as CR.  
 c. Unconfirmed CR:  One objective status of CR documented before progression or 
symptomatic deterioration but not qualifying as CR or PR.  
 
d. Unconfirmed PR:  One objective status of PR documented before progression or symptomatic deterioration but not qualifying as CR, PR or unconfirmed CR.  
 e. Stable/no response:  At least one objective status of stable/no response documented at least 6 weeks after registration and before progression or symptomatic deterioration, but not qualifying as anything else above.  
 f. Increasing disease:  Objective status of progression within 12 weeks of registration, not qualifying as anything else above.   
 g. Symptomatic deterioration: Objective status of symptomatic deterioration within 12 weeks of registration, not qualifying as anything else above.   
 Inadequate assessment, response unknown:  Progression or symptomatic deterioration greater than 12 weeks after registration and no other response category applies.

  11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
11.1 Accrual Goal  
 
A parallel (randomized) two- stage design will be used for patient accrual. When 
conducting both studies in parallel, each study acts independently.  Eligible patients with 
advanced pRCC will be enrolled according to two strata: Strata 1 = 1st line therapy, Strata 
2 = 2nd Line therapy. Patients will be randomized to either Arm 1 (single agent ARQ 197) 
or Arm 2 (ARQ 197+ erlotinib), as long as both arms are open as per stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_461468]. Each arm will be conducted as an independent clinical trial. The 
primary endpoint, RECIST response (confirmed CR and PR) will be evaluated every two 
cycles.   There will be no cross over from the single agent arm to the double agent arm.  
 
11.2 Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
 
Arm 1: ARQ 197 as a single agent (35 patients) :   
 With no activity of ARQ [ADDRESS_590581] a response rate 
of 10%.  We would consider ARQ 197 promising for further investigation if the response 
rate were ≥ 30%.  Initially, [ADDRESS_590582] this to occur 1% of the time if the 
true probability of response was 30%.  If this arm shows adequate activity in the first stage, and toxicity and safety considerations permit, accrual will continue until a total of 35 eligible patients are accrued. If the total number of patients out of 35 who respond is 8+, 
we would consider this agent promising and worthy of further investigation in pRCC  if 
toxicity and PFS data are also supportive. In this arm, the design has a significance level (probability of falsely declaring that an agent with a 10% response probability  is worth y of 
further investigation) of 2%, and a power (probability of correctly declaring that an agent with a response rate of 30% is worthy of further investigation) of 87%. Thirty five eligible 
patients are suf ficient  to estimate the confirmed response to within ±17% (95% 
confidence interval).  
 
Arm 2: ARQ 197 plus erlotinib  (35 patients) : 
 
For ARQ [ADDRESS_590583] specified the study with the same two-stage design. While the criteria might be considered slightly higher considering the 
S0317
 data on erlotinib showing responses and prolonged stable disease, raising the bar 
is considered unwarranted in this case for two main  reasons: 1) this study permits pre-treated patients; 2) S0317
, with only previously untreated patients had 5/52 patients with 
responses, including unconfirmed responses, and only 29% free from treatment failure at [ADDRESS_590584] stage in this study.  As a result, the same design considerations for Arm 1 apply. The 
operating characteristics of these rules were described above.  
 
11.3 Analysis of Secondary Endpoint s 
 
Safety and Tolerability will be summarized by [CONTACT_461483] y of toxicities grade by [CONTACT_12397] v 4.0 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events), the frequency and extent of required dose modifications, and the frequency and cause of patient withdrawal for reasons other than progression.  
 
Thirty five eligible p atients are sufficient to estimate the probability of an adverse event 
within ±17% (95% confidence interval). Any adverse event occurring with at least a 5% 
probability is likely to be seen at least once (83% chance).  
 
Assuming an ineligibility rat e of approximately 10%, total accrual (eligible + ineligible) to 
this study is expected to be 78 patients.  
 S1107 
 Page 37 
 Version Date 5/10/16 
 
 
  Progression- free survival will be estimated by [INVESTIGATOR_216]. Thirty five eligible patients are 
sufficient to estimate the 4 month progression- free survival within ±17 % (95% confidence 
interval).  
 
11.4 Analysis of Translational Medicine Endpoints  
 
Correlative analysis will be exploratory in the context of this Phase II trial. There are several different statistical analyses that will be performed on the correlates:  
 The role of c -MET and EGFR, when available, will be explored through the use of Cox 
regression, categorical analysis (responders/non- responders versus high expressors, 
etc.), and graphical presentations.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_590585] be registered prior to initiation of treatment (no more than five working day s

 16.1 Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
 
a. Purpose  Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical trial, are done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enr oll in future studies using similar agents. Adverse events 
are reported in a routine manner at scheduled times during a trial. (Directions for  
 S1107 
 Page 45 
 Version Date 5/10/16 
 
 
  routine reporting are provided in Section 14.0 .) Additionally, certain adverse 
events must be reported in an expedited manner to allow for more timely 
monitoring of patient safety and care. The following guidelines prescribe 
expedited adverse event reporting for this protocol. See also Appendix  18.1 for 
general and background information about expedited reporting.  
 
b. Reporting method  This study requires that expedited adverse events be reported using the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program Adverse Event Reporting System (CTEP -AERS).  
CTEP's guidelines for CTEP- AERS can be found at http://ctep.cancer.gov. A 
CTEP- AERS report must be submitted to the SWOG Operations Office 
electronically via the CTEP -AERS w eb-based application located at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/adverse_events.htm. 
 
c. When to report an event in an expedited manner  
 Some adverse events require 24- hour notification (refer to 
Table 16.1 ) via CTEP -
AERS.   
 When the adverse event requires expedited reporting, submit the report within the number of calendar days of learning of the event, as specified in 
Table 16.[ADDRESS_590600] one dose of the 
investigational agent(s) as part of the trial.  Reporting requirements are provided in 
Table 16.[ADDRESS_590601] at the SWOG Operations Office, 210/614- 8808 or

FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312)  
NOTE:   Investigators MUST  immedi ately report to the sponsor (NCI) ANY Serious Adverse 
Events, whether or not they are considered related to the investigational 
agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
 
 An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:   
1) Death 
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1328] ≥ 24 hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. (FDA, 21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and 
ICH E6).  
ALL SERIOUS  adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST  be immediately reported to the 
NCI via CTEP -AERS within the timeframes detailed in the table below.

  f. Additional Instructions or Exceptions to CTEP- AERS Expedited Reporting 
Requirements for Late Phase 2 and Phase 3 Studies Utilizing an Agent under a 
CTEP IND:  
 
1) Group- specific instructions  
 
Submission of the on- line CTEP- AERS report plus any necessary 
amendments generally completes the reporting requirements.  In addition, you may be asked to submit supporting clinical data to the Operations Offices in order to complete the evaluation of the event.  If requested, the supporting data should be sent within 5 calendar days by 
[CONTACT_12100] 210- 614-0006.  Supporting clinical data submitted should include:  
• Printed copy of the first page of the CTEP- AERS Report.  
• Copi[INVESTIGATOR_461469].  
• If applicable, and they have not yet been submitted to the SWOG Data Operations Center copi[INVESTIGATOR_231560]/or Notice of Death.  
 
g.   Reporting Secondary Malignancy, including AML/ALL/MDS  
 
1. A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy (e.g., treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy).  A secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  
 
 CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an NCI IND to be reported via CTEP- AERS.  Three 
options are available to describe the event.  
 
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., Acute Myelocytic Leukemia [AML])  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
• Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
 
 Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
 Second Malignancy: A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy).   Second malignancies require ONLY routine reporting via 
CDUS unless otherwise specified.  
 For more information see:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/aeguidelines.pdf  
 
2. Supporting documentation should be submitted to CTEP in accordance with instructions provided by [CONTACT_16656]- AERS system.   A copy of the 
report and the following supporting documentation must also be submitted to SWOG Operations Office within 30 days by [CONTACT_12100] 210/614-0006 or mail to the address below:  
 
• a copy of the pathology report confirming the AML/ALL /MDS diagnosis  
• (if available) a copy of the cytogenetics report

study, the report must be submitted for the most recent trial.  
 
 
h.  Reporting Pregnancy, Fetal Death, and Death Neonatal  
 
1. Pregnancy Study participants who become pregnant while on study; that 
pregnancy should be reported in an expedited manner via CTEP -AERS 
as Grade 3 “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions – 
Other (pregnancy)”  under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal 
conditions  SOC.   
 
Additionally, the pregnancy outcome for patients on study should be reported via CTEP -AERS at the time the outcome becomes known, 
accompanied by [CONTACT_90324].  
 
2. Fetal Death Fetal Death defined in CTCAE as “A disorder characterized 
by [CONTACT_260765]; failure of the product of conception to show evidence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], heartbeat, or definite movement of a voluntary muscle after  
expulsion from the uterus, without possibility of resuscitation”  should be 
reported expeditiously as Grade 4 “pregnancy, puerperium and 
perinatal conditions – Other (pregnancy loss)” under the 
Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions  SOC.   
 
3. Death Neonatal  Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE as “A disorder 
characterized by [CONTACT_52372] 28 days of life” that is felt by [CONTACT_454514]/intervention should be reported expeditiously.   
 
A neonatal death should be reported expeditiously as Grade 4 “General 
disorders and administration – Other (neonatal loss)” under the 
General disorders and administration SOC.  
 
Fetal death and neonatal death should NOT  be reported as a Grade 5 event.  If 
reported as such, the CTEP- AERS interprets this as a death of the patient being 
treated.  
 NOTE:   When submitting CTEP -AERS reports for “Pregnancy, “Pregnancy loss”, 
or “Neonatal loss”, the Pregnancy Information Form should also be completed and faxed with any additional medical information to 301- 230-0159.  The potential 
risk of exposure of the fetus to the investigational agent(s) or chemotherapy agent(s) should be documented in the “Description of Event” section of the CTEP- AERS report.  
 The Pregnancy Information Form is available at:

  18.1 Determination of Expedited Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
 
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical trial, are done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future studies using similar agents. Adverse events are reported in a routine manner at scheduled times during a trial. (Directions for routine reporting are provided in 
Section 14.0 .) Additionally, certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited 
manner to al low for more timely monitoring of patient safety and care. Expedited adverse 
event reporting principles and general guidelines follow; specific guidelines for expedited adverse event reporting on this protocol are found in 
Secti on 16.[ADDRESS_590605] be reported according to local policy and procedures.  Documentation of this reporting should be maintained for possible inspection during quality assurance audits.  
 Steps to determine if an adverse event is to be reported in an expedited manner (This includes all events that occur while on treatment or within [ADDRESS_590606] dose of protocol treatment.)  
 Step 1 : Determine whether the patient has received an investigational agent, commercial 
agent, or a combination of investigational and commercial agents.  
 An investigational agent is a protocol drug administered under an Investigational New Drug Submission (IND). In some instances, the investigational agent may be available 
commercially, but is actually being tested for indications not included in the approved package label.  
 Commercial agents are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead from a commercial source. The NCI, rather than a commercial distributor, may on some occasions distribute commercial agents for a trial.  
 When a study includes both investigational and commercial agents, the following rules apply.   
 Concurrent administration: When an investigational agent(s) is used in combination with a commercial agent(s), the combination is considered to be investigational and expedited reporting of adverse events would follow the guidelines for investigational agents.  
 Sequential administration:   When a study includes an investigational agent(s) and a commercial agent(s) on the same study arm with sequential administration all expedited reporting of adverse events should follow the guidelines for the type of agent being given.  For ex ample, if the patient begins the study on the investigational agent(s), then all 
expedited reporting of adverse events should follow guidelines for the investigational agent(s).  Once the patient begins receiving the commercial agent(s) then all expedited reporting of adverse events should follow the guidelines for commercial agent(s).   
 Step 2 : Identify the type of event using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE). The CTCAE provides descriptive terminology and a grading scale for  
each adverse event listed. A copy of the CTCAE can be downloaded from the CTEP home page ( http://ctep.cancer.gov) . Additionally, if assistance is needed, the NCI has an 
Index to the CTCAE that provides help for classifying and locating terms.  
 Step 3 :  Grade the event using the NCI CTCAE version specified in the protocol for 
reporting serious adverse events.

  Step 4 : Determine if the adverse event is Expected or an Exception to Expedited 
Reporting.  Expected events are those that have been previously identified as resulting 
from administration of the agent and are listed in one of the following:   
 
• The current NCI SPEER (Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting) for treatments using agents provided under an NCI -held IND, or an equivalent 
listing for treatments using agents provided under a Non- CTEP- held IND; located 
in 
Section 3.0  of the protocol.  
• For treatments using commercial agents, the current CAEPR (Comprehensive Adverse Event and Potential Risks), ASAEL (Agent Specific Adverse Event List), 
or other list of expected toxicities located in 
Section 3.0  of the protocol, or the 
drug package insert.   
• Exception to Expedited reporting located in Section 16.1  f of the protocol.  
 
An adverse event is considered unexpected, for expedited reporting purposes only, when either the type of event or the severity of the event is not
 listed in one of the areas outlined 
above.  
 
Step 5 :  Determine whether the adverse event involved hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26109] a prolongation 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (≥ 24 hours).  
 
Step 6 :  Additionally, for commercial drugs, determine whether the adverse event is 
related to the protocol therapy.  Attribution categories are as follows: Unrelated, Unlikely, 
Possib le, Probable, and Definite.  Consult the appropriate table for expedited reporting 
criteria for commercial agent(s).  
 
NOTE :   Any event that occurs more than [ADDRESS_590607] dose of study agent and 
is attributed (possible, probable, or definite) to the study agent(s) must be reported 
according to the instructions above and as outlined in the appropriate table in Section 
16.1.

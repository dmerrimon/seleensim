I. Background and Significance  
 
Obstructive Sleep Apnea- Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS) is a condition characterized by [CONTACT_815577] (UA).  The partial collapse and closure of the airway 
leads to sleep fragmentation, oxygen desaturation,  hypercarbia, and activation of the sympathetic 
nervous system.  A result of disrupted sleep may be excessive daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008].  The syndrome is 
also associated with behavioral, functional, cardiovascular and cognitive dysfunction. (2, 3, 4)  
 
Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is the most effective treatment for the OSAHS. CPAP 
stabilizes the airway and prevents instability and collapse.  With a stable and patent airway, breathing 
continues in a normal  manner, gas exchange is improved, and there is no disruption of sleep related to 
disturbed breathing. (5)  
 
CPAP is applied to the upper airway  via a mask that covers the nose or the nose and mouth and 
reduces or eliminates sleep disordered breathing .  The period of maximum susceptibility to airway 
collapse is at the end of exhalation and during early inhalation.  During inhalation, negative pressures 
are generated in the airway by [CONTACT_815578] (increase of thoracic volume and 
reduction of intra -thoracic pressure).  The constant pressure of CPAP supports the airway throughout 
the ventilatory cycle. (3)  
 In the sleep laboratory, manual titration of positive airway pressure is perform ed to determine effective 
CPAP pressures.  During the in -lab procedure, the patient is instrumented for full polysomnography 
(PSG) .  Therapy is applied and pressure is adjusted during the course of the night to stabilize the 
upper airway and the breathing pattern.  With conventional CPAP, a single pressur e level is applied to 
the airway.   While adequate for a majority of patients with obstructive sleep apnea, this static 
prescription will present challenges in certain patients and conditions. (6 7)  
 Other forms of positive airway pressure that are approved for the treatment of OSAHS include 
automatically adjusting CPAP,  Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP), and automatically adjusting 
BiPAP.  A utomatically adjusting CPAP (Auto CPAP) evaluate s the airflow pattern and adjusts pressure 
to optimize airflo w.  Pressure is increased or decreased at specific time intervals to adjust therapy  in a 
proactive fashion.   Auto CPAP accommodates  patients presenting with highly variable pressure 
requirements (e.g., sleep stage or body position dependent sleep apnea).  The automatic adjustment 
can be used in patients for whom in- laboratory therapy titration is either delayed or impossible.  (8, 9, 
10) 
 
The REMStar Auto algorithm is a pro -active, flow -based algorithm.  The basic algorithm evaluates the 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_815557].  This multi -dimensional flow 
evaluation occurs in concert with a program of pressure adjustments designed to evaluate the critical 
pressures ( pressure at which the airway is susceptible to collapse) and mai ntains pressures slightly 
above the critical pressure.  The patient is protected from “break -through” events with a full 
complement of intelligent responses to airflow events and snoring. (1)  
 BiPAP therapy  is an alternative to CPAP therapy.  With BiPAP  therapy, the patient’s breathing pattern 
is monitored to identify the inspi[INVESTIGATOR_815558] .  Pressure is increased during inhalation 
and returned to a lower pressure during exhalation. Although titration procedures vary, the expi[INVESTIGATOR_27111] (expi[INVESTIGATOR_815559]) is adjusted to prevent airway collapse (apnea) 
and the inspi[INVESTIGATOR_27111] (inspi[INVESTIGATOR_815560]) is adjusted to prevent airflow 
limitation, hypopnea, snoring or arterial desaturation not associated with complete airway obstruction.  
BiPAP therapy differs from CPAP therapy, in that in addition to stabilizing the airway, inspi[INVESTIGATOR_815561]:   # ST-1517- ALE -MS 
     
 
 
Version: 7.0 November  22, 2016                     Confidential                                   Page 9 of 16                
is assisted by [CONTACT_815579][INVESTIGATOR_547336].  This difference between 
EPAP and IPAP pressures is often referred to as “Pressure Support”. (1, 3, 8, 10)  
 Patients with OSAHS may be prescribed BiPAP therapy if CPAP therapy is not tolerated.  BiPAP 
therapy may also be prescribed for patients with other respi[INVESTIGATOR_815562].  
 
Automatically adjusted Bi -Level Positive Airway Pressure (Auto BiPAP®) is currently marketed for the 
treatment of OSAHS.  Auto BiPAP adjusts EPAP levels based upon the detection of an apnea or 
evidence of airway instability.  IPAP is adjusted to overcome hypopnea and airflow limitation.  
 
Patients experiencing reduced ventilation from lung disease, neuromuscular disorders, or problems 
with the control of the breathing can experience nocturnal hypoventilation that is worse during sleep 
than it is during wakefulness.  These patients are typi[INVESTIGATOR_815563] -up than patients suffering only from OSAHS.  Patients may also be more 
vulnerable to loss or interruptions in treatment and often require more advanced modes  and features  
such as alarms and timed back -up breaths.         
 
OSAHS patients may respond to increases in CPAP or BiPAP therapy by [CONTACT_5024] a shift in the nature of the apnea from obstructive to central.  In these cases, patients may not receive adequate 
treatment with CPAP since lower  pressure levels do not manage the instability of the airway leaving 
residual airway obstruction, while higher pressure levels are associated with CPAP emergent events.  
This condition is referred to as CPAP Emergent Complex Apnea.  
 
Auto SV (Auto Servo Ventilation) is a mode of positive airway pressure used to treat obstructive and 
complex central sleep apnea.  The main features  of the Auto SV mode include:  
• Normalization of ventilation by [CONTACT_815580] a target ventilation. 
IPAP is increased or decreased to help stabilize the ventilation.  
• Provision of timed, back -up breaths during central apneas .  The optimal back -up rate is automati cally 
determined by [CONTACT_815581] t he patient’s breathing .  
• Automatic control of EPAP pressure to treat obstructive events.  
 
Several manufacturers produce these types of devices. The algorithms used to determine the IPAP, 
EPAP and minimum respi[INVESTIGATOR_815564]. The largest number of these devices currently in use 
are the BiPAP AutoSV Advanced System One (Philips Respi[INVESTIGATOR_5770], Murrysville PA) and the VPAP 
Adapt (ResMed Corp., San Diego CA).   
I. Purpose and Scope  
This study is to better understand  the performance and features of the BiPAP autoSV Advanced System 
One. Philips Respi[INVESTIGATOR_815565] . The aim of the study is 
to characterize the acute outcomes of treatment provided by [CONTACT_815582][INVESTIGATOR_815566]’s algorithm  
 The participants for this study will be experienced in having  used servo ventilation therapy at their home  
because it is only such patients who are already using servo ventilation as part of routine clinical care 
that are eligible for participation.

If the device is not adequately treating the participant, the device may be adjusted during the night.  If 
available, device data normally stored on internal memory or written on to a data card in the device will 
be collected and reviewed for each PSG.  
 All PSG ’s will be s cored using Somnolyzer automated scoring software to determine all sleep and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_108951] . Results of the PSG’s will not be used to make any decisions or 
recommendations on the participant’s usual treatment.  
 
VI. Statistical Analysis 
Baseline data will be presented with descriptive statistics.   Endpoints will be compared between therapy 
nights, and between device and PSG scores.  Data that are not normally distributed may undergo 
appropriate transformation to fit the assumptions of a paired t -test.  Otherwise, the nonparametric 
     Protocol Number:   # ST-1517- ALE -MS 
     
 
 
Version: 7.[ADDRESS_1129344] will be used.  All tests will be conducted at a significance level of p < 0.05, 
and confidence intervals will be presented.  
VII. Risks and Discomforts  
Risks associated with poly somnography are minor and transient. Adhesive materials used to hold the 
various sensors in place may cause skin irritation. The sensors may feel uncomfortable. Some  patient may 
find it difficult to sleep in the sleep laboratory setting.  If participants fe el tired after the research study, the 
research staff can give the participant extra sleep time, or contact a family or friend to be the designated driver.  
 The currently released AutoSV  devices  being used in this study have been cleared for marketing by [CONTACT_43657] , being used within the  intended use. The  modified A utoSV Philips 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_815571].   For each PSG, t he positive airway pressure may feel different than the participant is accustomed to and 
breathing may feel different than normal. The pressure delivered by [CONTACT_815583]. These factors may cause discomfort or anxiety or may negatively impact sleep.    
 The use of positive airway pressure through a mask may cause dryness or irritation of the upper airway, discomfort in the ears or eyes or a runny nose. The mask may create red m arks on the face.  
 None of the risks or discomforts are more than those seen in normal clinical practice. Any irritation usually self resolves in hours after the PSG is completed. Heated humidification will be available to address issues with the upper ai rway. Participants will be using the mask they use for home treatment so 
mask side effects should be minimal.  
VIII. Potential Benefits  
Although participation in this trial will not result in any direct benefit to the subject, they will be contributing to g eneralizable data that will help improve  the device design and function.  
IX. Monitoring and Quality Assurance  
The clinical trial site will be monitored in accordance with policies at Respi[INVESTIGATOR_130747]. and those federal regulations that pertain to clinical research; namely, 21 CFR Parts 50, 54, 56 and 812; and others as applicable.  Monitoring will occur on a regula r frequency, such to allow ongoing review of data collected, 
site qualifications and compliance with the protocol.  All monitors will be appropriately trained to ensure compliance with the protocol.  
 
X. PROTECTION FOR HUMAN SUBJECTS  
 
Medical information p roduced by [CONTACT_815584]’s medical record.  
Information that does not become part of the medical record will be stored in the investigator’s file and 
identified by a code only.  The code key connecting the participant’s name  [CONTACT_815585] a separate, secure location.  Information contained in the records may not be given to any person unaffiliated with this institution in a form that could identify the participant without written consent, except as described in the consent form or as required by [CONTACT_2371].  
 
     Protocol Number:   # ST-1517- ALE -MS 
     
 
 
Version: 7.0 November  22, 2016                     Confidential                                   Page 15 of 16                
It is possible that the participant’s medical and research record, including sensitive information and/or 
identifying information, may be inspected and/or copi[INVESTIGATOR_778811] (and/or its agent), the FDA, the Institutional Review Board, federal or state government agencies, or accrediting agencies, in the course of carrying out their duties.  If the participant’s record is inspected or copi[INVESTIGATOR_778811] (and/or its age nts), or by [CONTACT_630101], this institution will use reasonable efforts to protect 
participant privacy and the confidentiality of the medical information.  
 The results of this study may be published in a medical book or journal or used for teaching  purposes.  
However, participant names or other identifiers will not be used in any publication or teaching materials without specific permission.    
XI. Confidentiality 
 Confidentiality of subject identification and test -related information is very important. The privacy rules 
and requirements according to governing regulations will be implemented. Methods to protect the privacy of subjects and clinical information will be  used. A unique identification number designed to protect the 
identity of subjects will be used to identify the subject on report forms, recruitment logs, data forms or other report containing information or referring to a subject.  This unique identificat ion number will be 
generated using a password protected online data numbering system and subjects will be assigned a number based on the screening order.   
 This unique identification number, if needed, can be linked to identifiable data.  The Respi[INVESTIGATOR_815572].  All other Respi[INVESTIGATOR_815573] s’ unique identification number.  The linked data will be stored 
within the study binder in the Clinical Research department for two years or until the end of the study.  After that point, the de -identified data will be stored indefinitely within the Clinical Research department 
Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system.

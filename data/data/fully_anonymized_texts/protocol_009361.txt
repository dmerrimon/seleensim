4/19/[ADDRESS_644064] of drug 
treatment on tasks of cognitive control.  
Aim 1: We will examine the effects of milk thistle versus placebo in individuals wi th 
gambling disorder. By [CONTACT_163988], milk thistle may offer a unique 
mechanism to address addictive disorders. We hypothesize that milk thistle will be more 
effective than placebo in reducing gambling behavior during an acute t reatment period .   
Aim 2: Because lack of cognitive control may underlie a range of addictive behaviors, and 
improvement in addictive symptoms may be secondary to greater control, we will examine levels 
of cognitive control using cognitive tasks pre - and post -treatment. This study will examine 
cognitive deficits across a range of prefrontal -dependent domains which have been associated 
with gambling disorder  - inhibition, working memory, cognitive flexibility and planning ability - 
as possible predictor s of treatment and as possible biomarkers for underlying pathophysiology of 
addiction.  We hypothesize that improvement in planning ability and inhibition will be greater in 
participants who receive milk thistle compared with placebo.  
 
Background and Significance  
 Gambling disorder is a significant public health problem that often results in a distinctive 
pattern of persistent and disabling psychological symptoms. Although once thought to be 
3 
 
3 
4/19/2017  relatively uncommon, studies estimate that gambling disorder  has a lifetime prevalence among 
adults of 1.6% and past -year prevalence of 1.1% ( 1-2). Patients with gambling disorder  also 
experience significant social and occupational impairment as well as financial and legal 
difficulties ( 3).  
Individuals with gamblin g disorder report chronically high levels of stress, and 
vulnerability to gambling addiction is enhanced by [CONTACT_500073]  (4), particularly as stress may 
result  in cognitive problems leading to impulsive and unhealthy decisions (5) . A stress response 
is elicited when sensations and  observations  do not match  existing  or anticipated  expectations.  A 
primary  endocrine  response  to stress is the secretion of glucocorticoids through the  activation of 
the hypothalamic –pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] –adrenal axis  (6). Although their r elease serves to maintain 
homeostasis during acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_500067], prolonged  stress responses have been associated 
with structura l brain damage both in humans and animals  (6). In humans, stress also enhances 
addictive  craving,  and relapse  to addiction is more  likely  to occur  in individuals exposed to high 
levels of stress. Since oxidative stress may be implicated in the etiology of addictive behaviors, 
use of antioxidants to reduce relapse, improve cognitive functioning, and reduce addictive urges 
may be a sensible step.  
Silymarin, a flavonoid and a member of the Asteraceae family, is extracted from the 
seeds of milk thistle ( Silybum marianum ) and is known to own antioxidative and anti -apoptotic 
properties. Silymarin has been reported to decrease li pid peroxidation. Furthermore, it has been 
demonstrated that its anti -oxidative activity is related to the scavenging of free radicals and 
activation of anti -oxidative defenses: increases in cellular glutathione content and superoxide 
dismutase activity. M ilk thistle has been used for a range of psychiatric disorders including 
methamphetamine abuse and obsessive compulsive disorder, two psychiatric disorders with  
similarities to gambling disorder. The flavanoid complex silymarin in preclinical studies has 
been found to increase serotonin levels in the cortex (7), and ameliorate decreases in dopamine 
and serotonin in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus associated with methamphetamine abuse 
(8). In the frontal cortex one of the functions of dopamine is to i ncrease the signal to noise ratio, 
increased dopamine correlating with increased frontal performance (9). Studies have shown that 
the higher cortical dopamine levels are associated with improved frontal cortical cognitive 
performance (9).  Cortical inhibit ion is felt to be the basis for top -down control of motivated 
behaviors. A recent randomized controlled study with milk thistle was conducted in Iran . Thirty 
five participants with moderate OCD were randomly assigned to [ADDRESS_644065] or 10  mg of fluoxetine three times daily for eight weeks. Results revealed no significant 
difference in treatment effects between milk thistle and fluoxetine from baseline to endpoint as 
both interventions provided a highly significant reduction in symptom s (10).  
Silymarin or Milk Thistle may therefore offer promise for the treatment of ind ividuals 
with gambling disorder. Pharmacological management of gambling  symptoms has produced 
mixed results, with some studies showing a superiority of medication to pla cebo  (11). 
The current pi[INVESTIGATOR_500068] s the tolerability and efficacy of milk thistle  in the 
treatment of gambling disorder . We hypothesize that milk thistle will reduce the severity of 
gambling symptoms and improve patients’ overall functioning.  
 
 
Methodology  
 The proposed study will consist of a n 8-week double -blind, placebo -controlled  trial of 
milk thistle in 80 subjects with gambling disorder .  Sample size calculation, using baseline PG -

4/19/2017  YBOCS total scores reported in a previous gambling study (mean score of 14.6 (SD 7.1)), is 
based on a simple test of mean differences. For this study, we assumed 30% and 60% decreases 
for placebo and for milk t histle , respectively, by [CONTACT_5875] 8, leading to mean scores of 10.[ADDRESS_644066] a mean difference of 4.4 with 80% power and 5% 
significance level in a two -sided test, 4 0 subjects per group are needed.   
 
Subjects:

Study Design  
 The study is an eight -week,  double -blind, placebo -controlled, pi[INVESTIGATOR_500069] r individuals with gambling disorder. All eligi ble study subjects 
will begin milk thistle  at 150mg twice a day or placebo at a 1:1 ratio of milk thistle or placebo 
for subjects who are randomized into the study. After 2 weeks, the dose can be increased to 
300mg twice a day. S ubjects will be seen for scheduled study visits every two weeks during the 
8-week double -blind, placebo -controlled study. All efficacy and safety assessments w ill be  
performed at each visit .  Subjects who are not compliant with their us e of study medication (i.e. 
failing to take medication for three or more consecutive days) w ill be  discontinued from the 
study.   Patients who experience a clinically significant adverse event will also be discontinued 
from the study.

4/19/2017  Screening Assessment s   
 Subjects w ill be  evaluated at entry into the study by [CONTACT_500075] (SCI -PG), a reliable and valid diagnostic instrument using criteria for 
DSM -IV PG. Psychiatric comorbidity w ill be  assessed using the Str uctured Clin ical Interview for 
DSM -5 (SCID) and SCID -compatible modul es for impulse control disorders (13 -14). Medical 
history, physical examination, electrocardiogram and routine laboratory testing w ill be  obtained. 
Gambling  symptom  severity will be  asses sed using the PG -YBOCS  (15) and the self -rated 
Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale (G -SAS)  (16). Anxiety symptom severity w ill be assessed 
with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM -A) (17). Depressive symptoms w ill be measured 
with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM -D) (18). Psychosocial functioning w ill be  
evaluated using the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)  (19). Personality will be assessed using the 
lie acceptability Scale, The Narcissistic Personality Inventory 16, and the Social Desirability 
Scale.   
In addition, subjects will undergo cognitive assessments at baseline and study endpoint.  
Cognitive Assessments:  Assessments of cognitive control will be comprised of several valid 
paradigms (Table 1). These tasks are designed to probe  dissociable neural circuitry and cognitive 
processes likely to be implicated in the pathophysiology of addictions. Task o rder was chosen 
arbitrarily and will be applied consistently across subjects, to minimize possible confounding 
factors of differences in task order across participants.

Tower of London Task  Tests frontal lobe integrity  
 
Efficacy  Assessments  
 The primary outcome  measure  will be  the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale 
Modified for Pathological Gambling (PG -YBOCS)  (15).  The PG -YBOCS is a reliable and valid, 
10-item, clinician -administered scale that rates gambling symptoms within the last seven days, 
on a severity scale from 0 to 4 for each item (total scores range from 0 to 40 with higher scores 
reflecting greater illne ss severity). Scores ranging from [ADDRESS_644067] minimal or mild 
symptoms; scores from [ADDRESS_644068] moderate symptoms; severe symptoms are associated 
with scores from 21 to 30; and scores greater than [ADDRESS_644069] extreme gambling symptoms.  
Secondary e fficacy measures include the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI). 
Clinical Global Impression -Improvement and Severity scales (CGI)  (20). The CGI consists of 
two reliable and valid 7 -item Likert scales used to assess severity and change in clinical 
sympt oms. The improvement scale w ill be  used every visit after the screening visit. The scale 
ranges from 1 = “very much improved” to 7 = “very much worse.”  The CGI severity scale was 
used at each visit and ranges from 1 = “not ill at all” to 7 = “among the mo st extremely ill.”  The 
CGI has been used successfully for gambling trials previously.  
Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale (G -SAS)  (16).  Subjects will complete the G -SAS at 
each study visit. The G -SAS is a 12 -item, reliable and valid, self -rated scale assess ing gambling 
6 
 
6 
4/19/[ADDRESS_644070] greater severity of PG symptoms.  
Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)  (19). The S DS is a three -item, reliable and valid scale 
that assesses functioning in three areas of life: work, social or leisure activities, and home and 
family life.  
Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM -A) (17). The HAM -A is a reliable and valid, 
clinician -administered, 14 -item scale that provides an overall measure of global anxiety.  
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM -D) (18). The HAM -D is a valid and reliable, 
17-item, clinician -administered rating scale ass essing severity of depressive symptoms.   
Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)  (21).  The 14 -item PSS is a reliable and valid, self -report 
measure designed to assess the degree to which individuals find their lives to be unpredictable, 
uncontrollable, and stressfu l. Each question is answered on a 5 -point scale (ranging from “never” 
to “very often”) based on experiences of the previous month. Scores range from 0 to 40.  
Quality of Life Inventory (QOLI)  (22). T he QOLI is a [ADDRESS_644071] of living. Each item is rated according to importance in the 
respondent's life and the level of satisfaction perceived by [CONTACT_500076].  
MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview  (MINI)  (23).  The MINI is a valid and 
reliable semi -structured interview, assessing the most prevalent psychiatric disorders.  
Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS; 24). The BIS is a valid and rel iable, self -report measure 
designed to assess the degree to which individuals are highly impulsive. While it is not a 
diagnostic assessment, it is key to understand the participant’s entire psychiatric profile.  
Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT ; 25). The AUDIT is a valid and 
reliable [ADDRESS_644072] for Nicotine Dependence (FTND ; 26). The FTND is a valid and reliable 
7-item self -report questionnaire assessing  nicotine dependence.  
Eysenck Impulsive Questionnaire  (EIQ; 27). The EIQ is a valid and reliable [ADDRESS_644073] and the participant’s entire psychiatric profile.  
Minnesota Impulse Disorders Interview (MIDI ; 28). The Minnesota Impulse control 
disorders Interview (MIDI) is a diagnostic tool assessing  compulsive buying, kleptomania, 
trichotillomania, intermittent explo sive disorder, pyromania, pathological gambling (now known 
as gambling disorder), and compulsive sexual behavior . 
Canadian Adolescent Gambling Inventory (CaGI ; 29). The CaGI is a valid and reliable 
44-item self -report scale assessing the avenues through wh ich people engage in problem 
gambling over the past 3 months.  
Structured Clinical Interview for Pathological Gambling (SCI -PG; 30). The SCI -PG a 
structured clinical interview to diagnose gambling disorder.  
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS ; 31). The Columbia Suicide Severity 
Rating Scale is a valid and reliable clinical assessment designed to assess an individual’s suicide 
risk level and suicidal ideation.  
  
Safety Assessments  
Safety assessments (sitting blood pressure, heart rate, adverse effe cts, and concomitant 
medications) will be documented at each visit. In terms of vital signs, those subjects with 
abnormal blood pressures will be assessed for symptoms of hypo - or hypertension. 
7 
 
7 
4/19/2017  Asymptomatic subjects will be evaluated each visit for changes  in vital signs. In the case of 
hypertensive emergencies (BP greater than 210/120), appropriate referral to the emergency room 
will be made. In the case of hypotension (BP less than 90/60), participants will be evaluated for 
symptoms of hypotension and if symptomatic, appropriate interventions will be made.  
Suicidality will be assessed using the Columbia Suicide Severity Scale.  The Columbia 
Scale will be performed at every visit. Subjects who endorse suicidal thoughts at any time during 
the study will be removed from the study and appropriate clinical intervention (e.g. 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) will be arranged.  
The investigator will record use of concomitant medications in terms of daily dosage, 
start and stop dates, and reason for use. Adverse events will be recorded at each study visit and 
as they become known to the study staff.  Urine pregnancy tests w ill be  performed only at 
screening .  Medication compliance will be ascertained through weekly pi[INVESTIGATOR_500070].  
 
Due to the pandemic of COVID19, study participants can perform their baseline and follow -up 
visits online using encrypted Zoom instead of in person  visits. All inventories will be assessed.  
 
Data Analysis   
Demographic and baseline visit characteristics for milk thistle and placebo groups will be 
compared using chi -square and analysis of variance to determine if group differences existed at 
ranodmization. Primary and secondary measures will be examined using repeated -measures 
ANOVA modeling analyses (PROC MIXED, SAS/STAT Sofetware for Windows, Version8.2, 
SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]). The baseline value of the measure being analyzed will be 
used as a covariate. A time trend (linear) will be included in a ll models.  The difference in the 
overall level of posttreatment values, the main effect for treatment, will be the test of primary 
interest. Analyses will be performed on all available data as well as for the completers. All 
available post -randomization da ta will be first analyzed and a secondary, supportive analysis of 
completers will be performed. All comparison tests will be two -tailed and an alpha level of .05 
will be used to determine statistical significance.

 1.   STUDY OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS 
Our research group has successfully developed a system of assessment methodologies 
and statistical techniques that can accurately assess energy balance and estimate energy 
intake [ EI] using research-grade but non-gold standard techniques.16-18 The purpose of 
thi
s study is to apply these techniques using consumer devices to assess rate of energy 
stora
ge [ES] and energy expenditure [ EE ], then estimate EI using the intake-balance 
technique.  
 
We believe calibration models developed in the proposed study will be able to be 
translated to other consumer devices with only minor modifications given common 
hardware (e.g. triaxial accelerometery), resulting in overall improved ability to assess 
energy balance and EI at a population level and positive health outcomes. 
 
Aim 1. Validate and calibrate consumer devices to estimate energy balance using gold-
standard methods and a Bayesian semi-parametric approach. Hypothesis 1 : We will be 
able to jointly model measurement error for both EE and ES to create a calibration model 
that reduces bias and improves accuracy of consumer devices of EE and ES.  
 
Aim 2. Estimate energy intake using the intake-balance technique using consumer 
monitors. Hypothesis 2 : We will use calibrated EE and ES from consumer monitors to 
e
stimate EI using the intake-balance technique, with values being superior to self-
reported EI. 
  
2.  RATIONALE 
The challenges of accurate estimation of energy intake are well-documented.5-[ADDRESS_108777] law of 
thermodynamics (rate of energy storage [ES] = rate of energy intake [EI] – rate of energy 
e
xpenditure [EE]).8 that allow researchers to estimate energy balance. For example, if one 
is able to accurately measure two of the variables of the energy balance equation (e.g., 
changed ES and rate of EE), it is mathematically possible to solve for the third (e.g., EI). 
Based on a variety of existing data sets containing EE, EI, and changes in ES (e.g., body 
composition using a two-compartment model of fat mass and fat-free mass), researchers 
have developed and refined a technique termed the intake-balance method to estimate 
EI.9-[ADDRESS_108778] methods of assessment of each (doubly-labeled water [DLW] for EE, 
dual-energy absorptiometry [DXA] for ES) is too costly and resource-intensive for most 
applications. Alternatively, consumer devices designed to measure physical activity and 
body composition are generally affordable, easy to use, and popular (an estimated 45 
million will be sold in 2017),[ADDRESS_108779]:

 1. W e will validate EE and ES (hereafter, Fitbit_EE and Fitbit_ES) from a consumer 
physical activity monitor (Fitbit Alta HR™) and body composition analyzer 
(Fitbit Aria™) with gold-standard measures of DLW for EE and DXA for ES 
during an initial 14- day baseline period;  
2. W e will estimate EI using the intake-balance method during the 14-day baseline 
period;  
3. W e will calibrate daily Fitbit_EE and Fitbit_ES from consumer devices using a 
Bayesian semi-parametric measurement error modeling approach to estimate 
energy balance during a second 14-day period immediately following the baseline 
period. 
4. W e will reassess our validation and calibration models of consumer devices 
during a third 14-day assessment period to evaluate changes associated with 
g
rowth and development with gold-standard measures of DLW for EE and DXA 
for ES.  
 
4.  TARGET STUDY POPLUATION SPECIFICS 
Participants will include 24  children or adults, ages 8 -90. Participants will be recruited 
from the community. We intend to enroll participants within the same family (child, 
pa
rents, and siblings) as long as they meet the age criteria.   
 
Inclusion Criteria  
 Healthy children and adults, aged 8-90. 
 Able  to be physically active.  
 
Exclusion Criteria 
 History of restrained eating, eating disorders, bariatric surgery, or other 
significant medical diagnosis that could impact metabolism. 
 Participants taking thyroid medications, beta blockers, or other stimulants 
(medications are known to affect metabolism). 
 
5.  DATA COLLECTION 
Data Collection Procedures 
The study will include 4 visits to CMH and assessments to be conducted at home.

IRB # 17030190

 P
articipants will receive a Fitbit Alta HRTM, a  wristworn tri-
axial activity monitor with optical heart rate monitoring 
(Figure 1 , top), and a Fitbit AriaTM smart scale which 
mea
sures fat mass and fat-free mass using bioimpedance 
(Figure 1 , bottom). Participants will be instructed to wear the 
monitor at all times (except for swimming or showering) and 
measure their body composition on the scale daily for 6 
we
eks. Fitbit_EE and Fitbit_ES will be uploaded using 
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, respectively, to the Fitbit DashboardTM 
and accessed by [CONTACT_98911], a research 
platform that collects data in collaboration with Fitbit, Inc. 
Fitbit_EE and Fitbit_ES will be calibrated during two 14-day 
assessment periods (study start and study end) using DLW 
and DXA. ‘True’ EE will be measured using a standard 14-
day DLW protocol19 with samples collected on Day 0, 7, and 
14. ‘
True’ ES will be calculated using DXA measurements on 
Day
 0 and Day 14. Fitbit_EE and Fitbit_ES during the 
assessment period will then be calibrated to ‘true’ EE and ES 
using a Bayesian semi-parametric approach, using free knot 
splines and Reversible Jump MCMC algorithms previously developed through work in 
our lab.18 This calibration model will then be applied to daily Fitbit_EE and Fitbit_ES 
collected during the middle 14-day assessment period to assess daily energy balance. 
Finally, we will estimate EI from Fitbit measurements using the equation16, 17:  
 
 
 
Where Δ𝐹𝐹M and Δ𝐹M represent change in each variable; Δ 𝑡 represents days between 
star
t and end of an assessment period; 1,020 represents the energy density in kcals of 
FFM per kg; and 9,500 represents the energy density of FM per kg, both based on 
established values; 20 𝐸𝐸 represents daily energy expenditure during the assessment 
period.  
 
Doubly-labeled Water Procedures 
 Energy expenditure will be assessed using the doubly labelled water (DLW) 
technique over a two week period. The DLW technique uses enhanced levels of 
naturally occurring stable (i.e., non-radioactive) isotopes of hydrogen (deuterium; 
2H) and oxygen (18O) to accurately measure energy expenditure via indirect 
calorimetry in free-living organisms. DLW was first introduced for human use in 
1982. The
 method is safe and has been validated extensively in both humans and 
other animals (including children and infants). Participants will be administered a 
dose of DLW with 1.5 ml/kg body weight of a mixture of 10% enriched H218O, 
and 99% enriched 2H2O (Cambridge Isotopes, Cambridge, MA). Participants will 
provide a urine sample (>15 mL) on day 0, 7, and 14, which will be analyzed by 
[CONTACT_98912].

DX
A Procedures  
 Assessment of body composition, including fat mass, fat free mass, and visceral 
adipose tissue, will be completed using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). 
DXA is a non-invasive procedure which participants will lie on a table and a 
detec
tor will be passed over the body. The procedures involves approximately 1/[ADDRESS_108780] X-ray and should take approximately 10 – 20 
mi
nutes. All anthropometric measurements will be performed with the participant 
dre
ssed in surgical scrubs and in bare feet. BMI (weight [kg]/height [m]2) will be 
calculated from the average of three height and weight measurements using a 
wall-mounted stadiometer and electronic scale and recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm 
and 0.1 kg, respectively. 
 
Diet Recalls  
 Energy intake will be assessed subjectively via interviewer-administered dietary 
recalls. Three dietary recalls will occur on randomly selected non-consecutive 
days over each one-week treatment condition (including at least one weekend 
da
y) to minimize preparation that could bias recall by [CONTACT_3038]. All 
interviews will be conducted over the telephone, will ask about all foods 
c
onsumed over the previous 24 hours using a multi-pass approach, and energy 
int
ake will be calculated using the Nutrient Data System for Research software 
(NDSR Version 2014). 
 
Records to be kept 
Data collected will be deidentified with a subject ID number. A linking list will used, 
which will contain the subject ID, subject’s name, gender, and date of birth. This log will 
only be accessible be the PI [INVESTIGATOR_98909]. 
 
Secure Storage of Data 
Consent statements and participant data will be kept in separate locked file cabinets so 
that individuals are not easily connected to the study results. All digital data will be 
stored on a firewall and password-protected project server at Children’s Mercy Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
Data collected at the CMH Don Chisholm Center CMH will be analyzed and stored in 
secure shared drive at the Don Chisholm Center.  
 
Fitabase Data Security: 
Data from the Fitbits will be monitored and reported to our research team in real-time 
using the Fitabase software (Small Steps Labs, LLC, San Diego, CA). Fitabase is an 
independent software company that provides real-time data from the Fitbit to researchers 
via an application program interface. Thus, we may be provided with real-time 
information regarding wear time and also minute- by-minute information regarding 
activity intensity (e.g. sedentary, moderate, etc.). Only participant ID# will be associated 
with this data. We will create fitbit accounts for everyone using a generic email account 
with m
any associated logins. We will not use participant names or actual birthdates (only 
birth
year) so no identifying information is associated with the account.

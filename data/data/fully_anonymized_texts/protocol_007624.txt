Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  1.[ADDRESS_715357] cancer. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_546738]. In our own data sequencing 3,000 patients with pancreatic cancer (accepted in 
JAMA), approximately 3% of pancreatic cance r patients harbor germline mutations in DNA 
repair genes such as BRCA1/2 and PALB2 , and are therefore potential candidates for PARP-
inhibitor therapy. In addition, somatic mutati ons in Homologous Recomb ination Repair (HRR) 
genes can confer sensitivity as well, and have b een reported to double the number of patients 
potentially eligible for such th erapy. Recently, Waddell et al de fined 5 subtypes of pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma, with BRCA-like tumors, categorized as such by [CONTACT_546765], comprising 
15-20% of pancreatic cancer, with the latter identified as a potential target for immunotherapy strategies. (1) In breast and ovarian BRCA-mutant tumors, neoantigen load alone did not correlate with T-cell infiltration, suggesting that other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_546739]. (2) The Keynote-[ADDRESS_715358] can cer patient (of 5) had SD for 10 cycles. (3) 
Although unselected trials in pancreatic cancer  with immunotherapy alone have yet to be 
successful, we hypothesize that induced genetic va riation with PARP inhibition disrupting the 
tumor microenvironment and increasing neoepi[INVESTIGATOR_546740].  
We are currently funded by a Project in our NCI Pancreas SPORE grant to more fully define genetic identification of this subset of patient s and develop a therapeutic strategy. We have 
developed preliminary data (Figure 1) with R NAseq suggesting that potent PARP inhibition (in 
this case, talazoparib) is associated with gain of novel mutations in pancreas cell lines, even 
compared to cisplatin alone, or  irinotecan alone. In addition,  double-stranded break repair 
deficient tumors are associat ed with increased expression of genes involved in antitumor 
immunity, including CD8 positive T cell activators a nd regulatory molecules, in a similar pattern 
of that seen with MMR deficient tumors. (4)  
We propose that a combination of PARP inhibiti on and anti-PD1 therapy has valuable therapeutic 
potential in this subset of pancreatic cancer. Th e strong activity seen in the dose escalation phase 
of Keynote [ADDRESS_715359] of the combination in HRR deficient pancreatic cance r. HRR deficient pancreatic cancer has largely 
been defined to date based on mutati ons in well-established genes such as BRCA1/[ADDRESS_715360] tumor phenotype.  
Therefore, we propose this single arm-cohort study. The goal would be to evaluate the combination of niraparib and TSR-042 in patie nts with germline or somatic mutations in 
BRCA1/2 or PALB2 .  
MC1841 6 Amendment 2

Pre-clinical data: 
There are in vitro studies to suggest that th e immunotherapy in combination with PARP 
inhibition provides synergy.(Higuchi, Flies et al . 2015) In a syngeneic model of breast cancer, 
PARP inhibition was shown to increase PD-L1 expression (Figure 1 from Jiao et al). (Jiao, Xia et 
al. 2017) Additionally in the same set of experimen ts, to corroborate these findings of extent of 
PARP inhibition (through measurement of PARy lation enzyme activity, which are inhibited by 
[CONTACT_546766]), showed an inverse correlation (Figure 2 – see below). This supports that high 
level of PARP activity suppresses PD-L1 expression or stated another way, PARP inhibition was 
led to increased PD-L1 expression in these tumors.(Jiao, Xia et al. 2017)

[From Open Access Article Jiao et al: (Jiao, Xia et al. 2017)] 
 PARP inhibition combinatorial strategies: PARP inhibitors are being explored in various c linical trials in combination with various other 
classes of drugs.(Drean, Lord et al. 2016) These in clude chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], targ eted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], novel 
targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], as a radiation sensitizer, endoc rine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_546742].(S chaefer, James et al. 2011, Drean, Lord et al. 
2016, Papa, Caruso et al. 2016) This as noted above h as been of particular interest in patients with 
homologous-repair related breast and/ or ovarian cancers as well as increased interest to study this 

MC1841 9 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  now in prostate and pancreas cancers.(Javle, Go lan et al. 2016, Ang and Tan 2017, Golan and 
Javle 2017, Ramakrishnan Geethakumari, Schiewer  et al. 2017, Turk and Wisinski 2018) 
Furthermore, there is some data to suppor t use of immunotherapy for BRCA-related tumors 
whereby [CONTACT_546767].(Matsuo, Spragg et al. 2018) The 
addition of PARP inhibition to further help augment responses in an aggressive disease like 
pancreas cancer would be of further value with ra tionale to supports its use as outlined. Figure 3 
from a recent review summarizes some of the ways how some of the ‘DNA-damaging’ drugs including PARP inhibition can affect the immunogenicity of tumors.(Brown, Sundar et al. 2018)

Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  Definitions 
Adverse Event 
Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not 
considered drug related.  
Suspected Adverse Reaction 
Any adverse event for which there is a reasona ble possibility that the drug caused the adverse 
event. 
Expedited Reporting 
Events reported to sponsor within [ADDRESS_715403] 
Events that would not typi[INVESTIGATOR_15881], but that 
for a specific protocol are being reported via expedited means in order to facilitate the review of 
safety data (may be requested by [CONTACT_15927]).  
10.1 Adverse Event Characteristics 
CTCAE term (AE description) and grade: The descriptions and grading scales found 
in the revised NCI Common Terminology Crite ria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 
5.[ADDRESS_715404] access 
to a copy of the CTCAE version 5.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP web site : 
a. Identify the grade and severity of the event using the CTCAE version 5.0. 
b. Determine whether the event is expected or unexpected (see Section 10.2). 
c. Determine if the adverse event is related to  the study intervention (agent, treatment or 
procedure) (see Section 10.3). 
d. Determine whether the event must be reported as an expedited report. If yes, determine the timeframe/mechan ism (see Section 10.4).  
e. Determine if other reporting is  required (see Section 10.5). 
f. Note: All AEs reported via expedited mech anisms must also be reported via the 
routine data reporting mechanisms defined by [CONTACT_760] (see Sections 10.6 and 18.0). 
NOTE: A severe AE is NOT the same as a seri ous AE, which is defined in Section 10.4. 
10.2 Expected vs. Unexpected Events  
Expected events  - are those described within the S ection 15.0 of the protocol, the study 
specific consent form, package insert (if applicab le), and/or the investigator brochure, (if 
an investigator brochure is not require d, otherwise described in the general 
investigational plan).  
Unexpected adverse events  or suspected adverse reactions are those not listed in Section 
15.0 of the protocol, the study specific consent form, package insert (if applicable), or in 
the investigator brochure (or are not listed at  the specificity or severity that has been 
observed); if an investigator brochure is not re quired or available, is not consistent with 
the risk information described in the general investigational plan. 
Unexpected  also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are 
MC1841 33 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs but have not 
been observed with the drug under investigation. 
An investigational agent/interv ention might exacerbate the exp ected AEs associated with a 
commercial agent. Therefore, if an expected AE (for the co mmercial agent) occurs with a 
higher degree of severity or specificity, expedited reporting is required. 
NOTE: *The consent form may contain study specific information  at the discretion of the 
Principal Investigator; it is possible that th is information may NOT be included in the 
protocol or the investigator brochure. Refe r to protocol or IB for reporting needs.  
10.3 Attribution to agent(s) or procedure 
When assessing whether an adverse event (AE) is  related to a medical agent(s) medical or 
procedure, the following attribution categories are utilized: 
Definite - The AE is clearly related to the agent(s)/procedure. 
Probable - The AE is likely related to the agent(s)/procedure. 
Possible - The AE may be related to the agent(s)/procedure. 
Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related to the agent(s)/procedure. 
Unrelated - The AE is clearly NOT related to the agent(s)/procedure. 
10.31 AEs Experienced Utilizing Investigational Agents and Commercial Agent(s) 
on the SAME (Combination) Arm 
NOTE:  When a commercial agent(s) is (a re) used on the same treatment arm as 
the investigational agent/intervention (also, investigational drug, biologic, cellular product, or other investigational therapy under an IND), the entire 
combination (arm) is then considered an investigational intervention for 
reporting. 
• An AE that occurs on a combination study must be assessed in accordance with 
the guidelines for investigational  agents/interventions.  
• An AE that occurs prior to administration of the investigational agent/intervention 
must be assessed as specified in the prot ocol. In general, only Grade [ADDRESS_715405] possible attribution to the commercial agent 
require an expedited report, unless hospi[INVESTIGATOR_546749]. Refer to Section 
10.4 for specific AE reporting requirements or exceptions. 
• An investigational agent/ intervention might exacer bate the expected AEs 
associated with a commercia l agent. Therefore, if an expected AE (for the 
commercial agent) occurs with a highe r degree of severity or specificity, 
expedited reporting is required.  
• An increased incidence of an expected  adverse event (AE) is based on the 
patients treated for this study at thei r site. A list of known/expected AEs is 
reported in the package insert or the literature, including AEs resulting from a drug overdose. 
• Commercial agent expedited reports must be submitted to the FDA via 
MedWatch 3500A  for Health Professionals (complete all three pages of the 
form).   
MC1841 34 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  10.32 EXPECTED Serious Adverse Events: Protocol Specific Exceptions to 
Expedited Reporting 
For this protocol only, the following Adverse Events/Grades are expected to occur 
within this population and do not require Expedited Reporting. These events must still 
be reported via Routine Re porting (see Section 10.6).* 
*Report any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction (at your study site) over that which is listed in the protocol or investigator brochure as an expedited event.  
*Report an expected event that is greater in severity or specificity than expected 
as an expedited event.

10.5 Other Required Reporting 
10.51  Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_15885])  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_15885]) in general, include any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the 
following criteria: 
1. Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity , or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the 
IRB-approved research protocol and in formed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the subject population being studied; 
2. Related or possibly related to particip ation in the research (in this guidance 
document, possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the 
incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_182821]); and 
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, ec onomic, or social harm) than was 
previously known or recognized. 
Some unanticipated problems involve social or economic harm instead of the physical or psychological harm associated  with adverse events. In other cases, 
unanticipated problems place subjects or others at increased risk of harm, but no 
harm occurs. 
MC1841 37 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  Note: If there is no language in the prot ocol indicating that pregnancy is not 
considered an adverse experience for this trial, and if the consent form does not 
indicate that subjects should not get pr egnant/impregnate others, then any 
pregnancy in a subject/patient or a male patient’s partner (spontaneously 
reported) which occurs during the study or within 120 days of completing the study should be reported as a UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845]. 
Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) Institutions: 
If the event meets the criteria for IRB submission as a Reportable 
Event/UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845], provide the appropr iate documentation and use the Mayo 
Clinic Cancer Center Expedited Event Report Form . The Mayo Clinic 
Compliance Unit will review and process th e submission to the Mayo Clinic IRB 
and work with the IND Coordinator for submission to FDA. 
10.52 Death 
Note: A death on study requires both routine and expedited reporting 
regardless of causality, unless as noted below. Attribution to treatment or 
other cause must be provided. 
Any death occurring within [ADDRESS_715411] dose, regardless of attribution to 
an agent/intervention under an IND requires expedited reporting within 24-
hours. 
Any death occurring greater than 30 days with an attribution of possible, 
probable, or definite to an agent/inte rvention under an IND requires expedited 
reporting within 24-hours. 
Reportable categories of Death   
• Death attributable to a CTCAE term. 
• Death Neonatal: A disorder characterized by [CONTACT_128746] 28 days of life.  
• Death NOS: A cessation of life that canno t be attributed to a CTCAE term 
associated with Grade 5. 
• Sudden death NOS: A sudden (defined as instant or within one hour of the onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of  life that cannot be 
attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5. 
• Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “Disease 
progression” under the system organ class (SOC) “General disorders and 
administration site conditions.” Evidence that the death was a 
manifestation of underlying disease (e .g., radiological changes suggesting 
tumor growth or progression: clinic al deterioration associated with a 
disease process) shoul d be submitted. 
10.53 Secondary Malignancy 
• A secondary malignancy  is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous 
malignancy (e.g., treatment with inves tigational agent/intervention, radiation 
or chemotherapy). A secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of 
the initial neoplasm. 
• All secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under 
an IND will be reported per SAE timelines. Three options are available to describe the event: 
MC1841 38 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  o Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., Acute Myeloctyic 
Leukemia [AML]) 
o Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) 
o Treatment-related secondary malignancy 
• Any malignancy possibly related to can cer treatment (including AML/MDS) 
should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms ou tlined in each 
protocol.  
10.54 Second Malignancy 
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy). Second malignancies require ONLY routine reporting unless otherwise specified. 
10.[ADDRESS_715412] (or female partner of  a male subject) taking investigational 
product becomes pregnant, the subject taki ng should notify the Investigator, and 
the pregnant female should be advi sed to call her healthcare provider 
immediately. The patient should have a ppropriate follow-up as deemed necessary 
by [CONTACT_140711]. If the baby [CONTACT_50835] w ith a birth defect or anomaly, a second 
expedited report is required. 
Prior to obtaining private information a bout a pregnant woman and her infant, the 
investigator must obtain consent from the pregnant woman and the newborn 
infant’s parent or legal gua rdian before any data collection can occur. A consent 
form will need to be submitted to th e IRB for these subjects if a pregnancy 
occurs. If informed consent is not obta ined, no information may be collected. 
In cases of fetal death, miscarriage or a bortion, the mother is the patient. In cases 
where the child/fetus experiences a serious adverse event other than fetal death, 
the child/fetus is the patient. 
NOTE: When submitting Mayo Expedited Adverse Event Report reports for 
“Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy loss”, or “Neonata l loss”, the potential risk of exposure 
of the fetus to the investigational agent(s) or chemotherapy agent(s) should be 
documented in the “Description of Event” section. Include any available medical 
documentation. Include this Form . 
10.551 Pregnancy 
Pregnancy should be reported in an expedited manner as Grade 3 
“Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions - Other (pregnancy)”  under the Pregnancy, pu erperium and perinatal 
conditions SOC. Pregna ncy should be followed until the outcome is 
known. 
10.552 Fetal Death 
Fetal death is defined in CTCAE as “A disorder characterized by [CONTACT_260765]; failure of the product of conception to show evidence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], heartbeat, or definite movement of a voluntary muscle after 
expulsion from the uterus, without possibility of resuscitation.” 
Any fetal death should be reported expeditiously, as Grade 4 
“Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions - Other 
(pregnancy loss)” under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions SOC. 
MC1841 39 Amendment 2

medication.  
An elective abortion without complications should not be regarded as an AE, 
however, it should be reported as the outco me to the pregnancy on the Pregnancy 
Follow-Up Form. Therapeutic abortions  should be reported as a treatment 
procedure; the reason for the therapeutic abortion should be reported on the Pregnancy Follow-Up Form and as an AE . Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14494] 
a healthy newborn should not be considered an SAE. 
Any SAE that occurs during pregnancy must be recorded on the Pregnancy 
Follow-Up Form reported as an SAE on th e SAE Report Form (e.g., maternal 
serious complications, therapeutic a bortion, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, 
neonatal death, congenital anomaly, birt h defect) and reported to the Sponsor 
Institution and [COMPANY_004] within [ADDRESS_715414] (AESI)  
An Adverse Event of Special Interest is defined as any AE (serious or non-
serious) that is of scientific and medical concern specific to the study treatment, 
for which ongoing monitoring and ra pid communication to the Sponsor 
Institution and to [COMPANY_004] is required.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) for niraparib include the following:  
• Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) 
• Secondary cancers (new malignancies [other than MDS or AML]) 
• Pneumonitis 
MC1841 41 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  • Embryo-fetal toxicity 
AESIs should be reported on SAE Repor t Forms whether serious or not, as 
follows: 
• MDS and AML along with other secondary cancers should be reported to 
the Sponsor Institution and to [COMPANY_004] upon awareness for any patient who 
has received niraparib (regardless of the timeframe since the last dose). 
• Pneumonitis should be reported to th e Sponsor Institution and to [COMPANY_004] 
through [ADDRESS_715415] dose of niraparib. 
• Embryo-fetal toxicity should be re ported as outlined in the Pregnancy 
reporting section. 
10.83 Special Situations: Abuse, Misuse, Me dication Errors, Overdose, and Accidental 
or Occupational Exposure  
• Abuse:  is the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of the study 
treatment which is accompanied by [CONTACT_3584].  
• Misuse:  medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriately used not in 
accordance with the authorized/approved product information. 
• Medication error: is any preventable incident that may cause or lead to 
inappropriate study treatment use or pati ent harm while the study treatment is

11.0 Treatment Evaluation/Measurement of Effect  
Response and progression will be evaluated in th is study using the new international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_182655] (RECIST) guidelines 
(version 1.1)
[ADDRESS_715419] diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumors and the short axis 
measurements in the case of lymph nodes are used in the RECIST guideline. 11.1 Schedule of Evaluations 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be reevaluated every 6 weeks.  
11.2 Definitions of Measurable and Non-Measurable Disease 
11.21 Measurable Disease 
• A non-nodal lesion is considered measurable if its longest diameter can be 
accurately measured as ≥2.[ADDRESS_715420] x-ray, or as ≥1.[ADDRESS_715421] component of a PET/CT, or MRI.  
• A superficial non-nodal lesion is measurable if its longest diameter is ≥1.0 cm 
in diameter as assessed using calipers (e .g. skin nodules) or imaging. In the 
case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_92385], including a ruler to 
estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended. 
• A malignant lymph node is considered measurable if its short axis is >1.[ADDRESS_715422] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no 
greater than 5 mm).  
• Tumor lesions in a previously irradi ated area are considered measurable 
disease under the following conditions:  
MC1841 44 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  - If there is a soft tissue component that has grown since completion of 
radiation. 
- Bone metastases with a soft tissue co mponent are considered measureable.  
11.22 Non-Measurable Disease 
• All other lesions (or sites of disease) are considered non-measurable disease, 
including pathological nodes (those with a short axis ≥1.0 to <1.5 cm). Bone 
lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflam matory breast disease, and abdominal 
masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]),  are considered as non-measurable as 
well. 
• Note: ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represen t cystic metastases can be considered 
as measurable lesions, if they meet th e definition of measurability described 
above. However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are 
preferred for selection as target lesions. In addition, lymph nodes that have a short axis <1.0 cm are considered non -pathological (i.e., normal) and should 
not be recorded or followed. 
11.3 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
11.31 Measurement Methods 
• All measurements should be recorded in metric notation (i.e., decimal fractions of centimeters) using a ruler or calipers. 
• The same method of assessment and the same technique must be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-
up. For patients having only lesions measuring at least [ADDRESS_715423]-treatment tumor assessments.  
• Imaging-based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_31952] a treatment.  
11.32 Acceptable Modalities for Measurable Disease 
• Conventional CT and MRI: This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_715424], if an MRI is performed , the technical specifications of the 
scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease. The lesions should be measured on the same pulse sequence. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible. 
• PET-CT: If the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET-CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with co nventional CT in accurately measuring 
cancer lesions over time.  
MC1841 45 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  • FDG-PET: FDG-PET scanning is allowe d to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progressive disease [PD] and particularly possible 'new' disease. 
A ‘positive’ FDG-PET scanned lesion is defined as one which is FDG avid 
with an update greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the 
attenuation corrected image; otherwise, an FDG-PET scanned lesion is considered ‘negative.’ New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET imaging can be identified according to th e following algorithm: 
o Negative FDG-PET at baseline with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of PD based on a new lesion. 
o No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up:  
 If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  
 If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of 
disease on CT at the same evaluation, a dditional follow-up CT scans (i.e., 
additional follow-up scans at least 4 weeks later) are needed to determine if 
there is truly progression occurring at that site. In this situation, the date of 
PD will be the date of the initial abnormal PDG-PET scan.  
 If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of 
disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, 
it is not classified as PD. 
FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring. The use of FDG-PET in  this circumstance has been described 
in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623]-specific medical literature for the indication  
However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false 
positive CR due to limitations of FDG-PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity. 
11.33 Measurement at Follow-up Evaluation:  
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears 
or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for 
response or stable disease is mandatory  to differentiate between response or 
stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive 
disease. 
Cytologic and histologic techniques can be  used to differentiate between PR and 
CR in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types such as germ cell tumors, 
where known residual benign tumors can remain.) 
11.4 Measurement of Treatment/Intervention Effect  
11.41 Target Lesions & Target Lymph Nodes 
• The protocol defined irradiated tumor wi ll not be considered for response in the 
primary endpoint. 
• The protocol defined irradiated tumor will be considered for secondary endpoint response. 
• Measurable lesions (as defined in Section 11.21 ) up to a maximum of 5 lesions, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as “Target Lesions” 
MC1841 46 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  and recorded and measured at baseline.  These lesions can be non-nodal or 
nodal (as defined in Section 11.21 ), where no more than 2 lesions are from the 
same organ and no more than 2 malignant nodal lesions are selected.  
• Note: If fewer than 5 (for phase III trials  replace with “3”) target lesions and 
target lymph nodes are identified (as ther e often will be), there is no reason to 
perform additional studies beyond those specified in the protocol to discover 
new lesions.  
• Target lesions and target lymph nodes should be selected on the basis of their 
size, be representative of all involved sites of disease, but in addition should be 
those that lend themselves to reproducible  repeated measurements. It may be 
the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion (or malignant lymph node) does not lend itself to reproducible measurements in which circumstance the next largest lesion (or malignant lymph node ) which can be measured reproducibly 
should be selected.  
• Baseline Sum of Dimensions (BSD): A sum of the longest diameter for all target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes will 
be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of dimensions (BSD). The BSD will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor response in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
• Post-Baseline Sum of the Dimensions (PBSD): A sum of the longest diameter for all target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes 
will be calculated and reported as the pos t-baseline sum of dimensions (PBSD). 
If the radiologist is able to provide an actual measure for the target lesion (or 
target lymph node), that should be recorded, even if it is below 0.5 cm. If the 
target lesion (or target lymph node) is believed to be present and is faintly seen 
but too small to measure, a default value of 0.[ADDRESS_715425] that the target lesion or target lymph node has likely disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as 0 cm. 
• The minimum sum of the dimensions (MSD) is the minimum of the BSD and the PBSD. 
11.42 Non-Target Lesions & Non-Target Lymph Nodes 
Non-measurable sites of disease ( Section 11.22 ) are classified as non- target 
lesions or non-target lymph nodes and shoul d also be recorded at baseline. These 
lesions and lymph nodes should be followed in accord with 11.433. 
11.[ADDRESS_715426]/MRI/PET-CT/Chest X-
ray/physical examination must be measur ed on re-evaluation at evaluation times 
specified in Section 11.1 . Specifically, a change in obj ective status to either a PR 
or CR cannot be done without re-measuring target lesions and target lymph nodes.  
Note: Non-target lesions and non-target lymph nodes should be evaluated at each 
assessment, especially in the case of firs t response or confirmation of response. 
In selected circumst ances, certain non-target organs may be evaluated less 
frequently. For example, bone scans ma y need to be repeated only when 
complete response is identified in targ et disease or when progression in bone is 
suspected. 
MC1841 47 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  11.431 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
o Complete Response (CR): All of the following must be true: 
 Disappearance of all target lesions. 
 Each target lymph node must have reduction in short axis to < 
1.0 cm. 
o Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in PBSD (sum of the longest diameter for all target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes at current evaluation) taking as reference the BSD (see Section 11.41). 
o Progression (PD): At least one of the following must be true: 
 At least one new malignant lesion, which also includes any 
lymph node that was normal at baseline (<1.0 cm short axis) and increased to ≥1.0 cm short axis during follow-up.  
 At least a 20% increase in PBSD (sum of the longest diameter for all target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes at current evaluation) taking as reference the MSD ( Section 11.41 ). In addition, the PBSD must also 
demonstrate an absolute increas e of at least 0.5 cm from the 
MSD.  
 See Section 11.32 for details in regards to the requirements for 
PD via FDG-PET imaging. 
o Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as reference the MSD. 
11.432 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions & Non-target Lymph Nodes 
o Complete Response (CR): All of the following must be true: 
 Disappearance of all non-target lesions.  
 Each non-target lymph node must have a reduction in short axis 
to <1.0 cm. 
o Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesions or 
non-target lymph nodes. 
o Progression (PD): At least one of the following must be true: 
 At least one new malignant lesion, which also includes any 
lymph node that was normal at baseline (< 1.0 cm short axis) and increased to ≥ 1.0 cm short axis during follow-up.  
 Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and non-target lymph nodes. (NOTE: Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion and target lymph node status. It must be representative of overall disease status change.)  
 See Section 11.32 for details in regards to the requirements for 
PD via FDG-PET imaging. 
  
MC1841 48 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  11.44 Overall Objective Status 
The overall objective status for an evaluation is determined by [CONTACT_131690]’s status on target lesions, ta rget lymph nodes, non-target lesions, non-
target lymph nodes, and new disease as defined in the following tables:

11.45 Symptomatic Deterioration  
Patients with global deterioration of h ealth status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time, and not 
either related to study treatment or othe r medical conditions, should be reported 
as PD due to “symptomatic deterioration.” Every effort should be made to 
document the objective progression even afte r discontinuation of treatment due to 
symptomatic deterioration. 
11.5 Immune-Related Response Assessment (iRECIST) 
All study endpoints requiring measurement data will be assessed per RECIST criteria (defined above). Patients will not be requir ed to end study participation at the first 
evidence of progression since Immunotherapeuti cs may result in infiltration of immune 
cells leading to transient increase in the size of malignant lesions, or undetectable lesions 
becoming detectable. For this reason, iRECIST
[ADDRESS_715427] criteria are designated with a prefix. 
MC1841 49 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  11.[ADDRESS_715428] requires the confirmation of progression and uses 
the terms iUPD (unconfirmed progressi on) and iCPD (confirmed progression). 
Confirmatory scans should be performed at least 4 weeks, but not longer than 9 
weeks after iUPD. 
For patients that had an iUPD in the pr evious assessment, iCPD is confirmed in 
two ways: 
1) Existing iUPD gets worse in any lesion type (target, non-target, or new 
lesions) which contributed to the current iUPD status (a patient can have 
more than one of the following sources of iUPD). 
If iUPD was at least partially based on… Then iCPD is confirmed if… 
Target lesions A cumulative in crease (can occur over multiple 
assessments) of at least [ADDRESS_715429] occurrence of the current iUPD 
New lesions A cumulative increase (can occur over multiple 
assessments) of at least 5 mm in the absolute 
value of the sum of those considered to be target 
new lesions or any new lesions (from the first occurrence of the current iUPD) 
2) RECIST 1.1 criteria are met in lesion types (target, non-target, or new lesions) which did not contribute to current iUPD status, including the appearance of new lesions. 
If a patient meets either (or both) of these criteria, they are considered to have 
confirmed progression (iCPD). See Appe ndix III for examples of confirming 
progression. 
11.[ADDRESS_715430] 1.1 
criteria, and recorded as New Lesion-Target (NLT) and New Lesion-Non-Target (NLNT) to allow clear differentiation fro m baseline target and non-target lesions. 
New lesions may either meet the criteria of NLT or NLNT to drive iUPD (or iCPD). However, the measurements of NLT should NOT be included in the sum 
of measures of original target lesions identified at baseline. 
Progression is confirmed in the New Lesion category if the next imaging 
assessment, conducted at least 4 weeks (but  not more than 9 weeks) after iUPD 
confirms further progression from iUPD with either an increase of at least 5 mm in the absolute value of the sum of NLT OR and increase (but not necessarily 
unequivocal increase) in the size of NLNT lesions OR the appearance of new lesions. 
  
MC1841 50 Amendment 2

15.0 Drug Information 
15.1 TSR-042 (dostarlimab) 
15.11  Background TSR-042 is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the immunoglobulin G4 
(IgG4) isotype that binds with high affinity to PD-1, resulting in inhibition of 
binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2. TSR-042 is produced by [CONTACT_370690] a mammalian expression sy stem using a stable Chinse hamster 
ovary (CHO) cell line. 
15.12 Formulation 
TSR-042 50 mg/mL drug product is a single use sterile liquid formulation that 
can readily be diluted in an IV solution fo r intravenous administration. It is a pH 
6.0 formulation containing 50 mg/ml TS R-042, 25 mM sodium citrate, 100 mM 
arginine, 31 mM sodium chloride, and 0.02% polysorbate 80. The deliverable 
volume in each vial is [ADDRESS_715437] should be stored between 2°C and 8°C, and in accordance with the 
Pharmacy Manual or protocol as provided by [CONTACT_1034]. 
15.14 Administration 
TSR-042 is administered as an intrav enous infusion in accordance with the 
Storage and Handling Guidelines provided by [CONTACT_23983].  
15.15 Pharmacokinetic information  
Absorption: TSR-042 is administered IV, thus absorption is not 
applicable. Distribution: The Vss of TSR-042 was determined in subjects participating in 
Part 1 of Study 4010-01-001 following a 30-minute IV infusion. The mean Vss was 74.2, 71.7, and 60.7 mL/kg following the administration of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg, respectively. These results sugg est a limited distribution outside the 
vascular space, which is consistent w ith the behavior of endogenous IgG.   
Metabolism: TSR-042 is a therapeutic mAb IgG4, which is expected to be catabolized into small peptides, amino acids, and small carbohydrates by [CONTACT_546778]-phase or receptor-mediated endocytosis.  
Elimination: The clearance of TSR-042 was dete rmined in subjects participating 
in Part 1 of Study 4010-01-001 following single IV infusion. The mean clearances were 0.201, 0.117, and 
MC1841 56 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  0.152 mL/h/kg for the 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg dose groups, respectively. Body weight 
(range 45.6 to 145.6 kg) was not a significant covariant for TSR-[ADDRESS_715438]  been conducted. Monoclonal antibodies 
such as TSR-042 are not substrates for cytochrome P450 or drug transporters, 
and are unlikely to be cytokine modul ators. Additionally, pharmacokinetic drug-
drug interactions of TSR-042 with small molecule drugs are not expected. There 
is no evidence of drug-drug interactions mediated by [CONTACT_105]-specific clearance of lysosome degradation for antibodies.

15.2 Niraparib (Zejula®, formerly MK-4827) 
15.21 Background 
Niraparib is an orally available, potent, highly selective poly (adenosine 
diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP)1 and PARP2 inhibitor being developed as a monotherapy agent for tumo rs with defects in the homologous 
recombination (HR) DNA repair pathway and as a sensitizing agent in combination with cytotoxic agents and radiotherapy as well as in combination 
with immune-oncology biologics. 
15.[ADDRESS_715440] gelatin capsule.  
15.23 Preparation and storage  
Niraparib 100 mg capsules are packaged in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles fitted with child-resistant plastic  closures. Niraparib 100-mg capsules 
MC1841 57 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  have a proposed shelf-life of up to [ADDRESS_715441] the absorption of niraparib; therefore, niraparib 
may be taken without regard to meals. 
If a patient vomits or misses (greater  than 12 hours from normal dosing time) a 
dose of niraparib, an additional dose should not be taken. The next dose should 
be taken at the regularly scheduled time.  
15.25 Pharmacokinetic information  
Niraparib exhibits linear pharmac okinetics (PK), and exposure is dose 
proportional. Absorption and clearance are dose-independent (range: 30 to 400 mg). 
Absorption:  Following a single-dose administration of 300-mg niraparib under 
fasting conditions, niraparib was measurable in plasma within 30 minutes, and 
the mean Cmax for niraparib was reache d in about 3 hours. Following multiple-
oral doses of niraparib from 30 mg to 400 mg QD, accumulation of niraparib was approximately 2-fold. 
The systemic exposures (Cmax and AUC) to niraparib increased in a dose-
proportional manner when the dose of niraparib increased from 30 mg to 400 mg. The absolute bioavailability of nirapa rib is approximately 73%, indicating 
minimal first-pass effect. 
Concomitant intake of a high-fat meal di d not significantly affect the PK of 
niraparib after administration of 300 mg of niraparib. 
Distribution: Niraparib was moderately boun d to human plasma proteins 
(approximately 83.0%). The apparent Vd /F was 1220 L, indicating extensive 
tissue distribution of niraparib. In a population PK analysis, the Vd/F of niraparib 
was 1074 L in patients with cancer. 
Metabolism:  Niraparib is metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_546779] a major inactive 
metabolite, M1. In a mass balance study, M1 and M10 (the subsequently formed 
M1 glucuronides) were the major circulating metabolites. The mean t½ of M1 
was 88 hours. The exposure ratio of M1 to  niraparib was approximately 1.3- to 
2.2- fold in plasma. 
Elimination: Following a single oral 300-mg dose of niraparib, the mean t½ of 
niraparib ranged from 48 to 51 hours (approxi mately 2 days). In a population PK 
analysis, the CL/F of niraparib was 16.2 L/h in patients with cancer. Niraparib is eliminated primarily through the hepatobiliary and renal routes. Following administration of a single oral 300-mg dose of [14C]-niraparib, on average, 
86.2% (range: 71% to 91%) of the dose was recovered in urine and feces over 21 
days. Radioactive recovery in urin e accounted for 47.5% (range: 33.4% to 
60.2%) and in feces for 38.8% (range: 28.3%  to 47.0%) of the dose. In pooled 
samples collected over 6 days, 40.0% of the dose was recovered in the urine primarily as metabolites, and 31.6% of  the dose was recovered in the feces 
primarily as unchanged niraparib. 
MC1841 58 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  15.26 Potential Drug Interactions  
No formal drug interaction studies ha ve been performed with niraparib.  Neither 
niraparib nor the major metabolite M1 is an inhibitor of any drug-metabolizing 
CYP enzymes. A clinically meaningful drug interaction via inhibition of CYPs is highly unlikely. 
Niraparib weakly induces CYP1A2 in vitr o; therefore, investigators should be 
advised to use caution with drugs that ar e sensitive substrates for CYP1A2 with a 
narrow therapeutic range, i.e., theophylline and tizanidine. M1 is not a CYP1A2 
inducer.

16.0 Statistical Considerations and Methodology  
16.1 Primary Endpoint and Analysis:  
This is a single arm Phase II study designed to determine as primary endpoint the disease 
control rate at 12 weeks (DCR12), using th e standard iRECIST criteria of patients 
receiving the combination of niraparib and TSR-042. Because the study features a heterogeneous population featuring 3 differen t genetic/somatic mutations, there will be 
no interim analysis. The study will stay rema in open, unless a higher than expected 
toxicity issue is identified.  
DCR12 definition and determination: 
For this protocol, the patients must undergo response scanning according to the iRECIST 
criteria. The DCR12 is defined as the percentage  of patients who have either iCR, iPR or 
iSD at [ADDRESS_715446] achieved disease control at 12 weeks, if at 12 weeks there is no confirmation of 
disease progression (iCPD) and the patient regresses to either iCR, iPR or iSD. DCR will 
be analyzed descriptively as a point es timate with a 95% confidence interval. 
The primary endpoint will assess the disease control rate at 12 weeks (DCR12), using the standard iRECIST criteria (see Section 11.0, where 11.[ADDRESS_715447]). All eligible patients who are registered and start treatment will be evaluable for the 
DCR12. A 1-stage design will be utilized (see below). This design has 80% power to 
detect an improvement in DCR12 from 25% to 50%, with a significance level of 0.10. See 1-stage design details below: 
Final analysis: We will enroll 19 eligible patie nts total. As various different types of 
mutations are to be included, various respon se patterns are possible; therefore the result 
MC1841 60 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  (expressed as the DCR12) might indicate but will not definitively be able to conclude that 
the treatment is worthwhile. If at least [ADDRESS_715448] 19 
eligible patients (41%), the treatment will be considered worthy of further investigation. 
Otherwise, depending upon per mutations results, the study might continue or the 
treatment is considered unworthwhile and can  be permanently closed due to lack of 
efficacy.  
16.2 Secondary Endpoints and Analysis:  
The following endpoints will be assessed  as well: objective response rate (ORR), 
duration of confirmed stable disease according to iRECIST, time to next treatment (TTNT), overall survival , time to and du ration of confirmed response, progression-free 
survival, and adverse events.  
Response rate: The confirmed response ra te (by [CONTACT_19393] ) will be assessed. Any 
confirmed response that occurs during the fi rst 8 cycles of treatment will count as a 
success (24 weeks). Per iRECIST, responses need to be confirmed ([ADDRESS_715449] 4 weeks apart) to count as a response. We will also assess the duration 
of confirmed stable disease according to iRECIST. All eligible patients who are 
registered and start treatment will be evaluable for response.  
Time to next treatment (TTNT): The TTNT is  defined as the time from the end of study 
treatment to receiving the next treatment. TTNT will be estimated using the Kaplan-
Meier method.  
Overall Survival: Overall Survival (OS) is  defined as the time from study entry to death 
from any cause. OS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.  
Time to and Duration of Confirmed Respon se: The time to response and duration of 
confirmed responses will be assessed using th e Kaplan-Meier method, where the time to 
response will be the time from registration to  confirmed response and the duration of 
confirmed response will be defined as the time from the first documented date of 
confirmed response (CR or PR) to the date at which progression is first documented.  
Progression-Free Survival: Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from 
study entry to the first of either disease progression or death from any cause, where 
disease progression will be determined based on iRECIST criteria. PFS will be estimated 
using the Kaplan-Meier method.  
Adverse events: The maximum grade for each t ype of adverse event will be summarized 
using CTCAE version 5.0. The frequency and percentage of gr ade 3+ adverse events will 
be estimated. We’ll also assess AEs at least possibly related to treatment as well.  
16.3 Translational endpoints 
The goals of the translational studies are to assess germline DNA and serum markers of 
immune response, to determine changes in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) profile after 
therapy with a PARPi [INVESTIGATOR_1238] a PD-1 inhibitor, to study mechanisms of resistance in ctDNA 
profile after therapy with a PARPi [INVESTIGATOR_1238] a PD-1 inhibitor, to assess the tumor microenvironment for immune related chang es (immune infiltration, PD-L1 and PD-1 
expression, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes [TIL ]), to assess genetic profile of the tumor 
pre- and post-treatment, and to determine cha nges in the cytokine profile pre- and post-
treatment. 
Due to the limited sample size, these analyses will be hypothesis generating and 
descriptive in nature. Descriptive statistics will be summarized and the blood and tissue marker data will be correlated with clini cal endpoints (response, DCR12, duration of 
MC1841 61 Amendment 2 
Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  response, OS, PFS, advere events, etc.). For time-to-event data, the Kaplan-Meier method 
will be used. For categorical data, we’ll use th e Fisher’s exact test. For marker data used 
to predict binary outcomes (i.e. response vs . no response), we’ll use Logistic regression 
models.  
16.4 Total sample size and study duration 
To account for possible drop-outs, cancellations, etc. we plan to accrue 20 total patients. 
We plan to accrue around 2 patients per month, so the study accrual phase should be 
around 10 months total. The final analysis can be done around 24 months after the study 
begins, which includes time for data entry, clean-up, and analysis.  
16.5 Data & Safety Review 
16.51 Reviews 
The principal investigator(s) and the st udy statistician will review the study at 
least twice a year to identify accrual, adverse event, and any endpoint problems 
that might be developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. The Mayo Clin ic Cancer Center (MCCC) Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) is responsible  for reviewing accrual and safety data 
for this trial at least twice a year, based on reports provided by [CONTACT_128775].

newly acquired information regarding the adverse event profile of the 
treatment(s) under investigation. The study team may choose to suspend accrual because of unexpected adverse event profil es that have not crossed the specified 
rule below. Accrual may be temporarily su spended to this study if at any time we 
observe events considered at least possi bly related to study treatment (ie, an 
adverse event with attribute specified as  “possible”, “probable”, or “definite”) 
that satisfy the following: 
• If [ADDRESS_715450] 10 patients (or 30% or more of all patients after 10 are accrued) experience a Grade 4 AE. With exceptions: cytopenia, 
fatigue,  
• If 2 or more experience a Grade 5 AE at any time. 
After consideration by [CONTACT_3476] (study chair, statistician, etc.), a decision 
will be made as to whether accrual can be resumed.

Protocol Version Date: 18May2021  Appendix III Examples of confirmed progression  
The following examples show how a patient that is currently an iUPD can become an iCPD (confirmed 
progression). These examples all use target lesion growth as the source of the first progression (iUPD) 
and show how additional informati on in future assessments can lead to iCPD. The examples are not 
exhaustive, but are meant to be illustrative of how  iCPD can occur. Similar examples can be created 
where non-target lesions and/or new lesions led to the initial iUPD. 
1) iUPD due to target lesion growth from baseline followed by [CONTACT_546783] (by [CONTACT_2669] 5 mm).

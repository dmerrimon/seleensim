The elevated risk of lung cancer due to cigarette or cigar smoking can be largely reversed by [CONTACT_7419] -term 
smoking cessation . Pregnancy is a unique opportunity to quit  smoking . However,  most  quitters return to 
smoking ( “relapse”) after delivery. Sufficient b reastfeeding  protects  against breast cancer. But s mokers tend to 
not breastfeed. Our team has successfully developed two separate  interventions for smoking cessation during 
pregnancy and breastfeeding  maintenance , respectively . However, only 50% of quitters  in our sample remain 
smoking abstinent at 6 mont hs postpartum , and  only 21% of quitters still breastfeed at 6 months postpartum . 
Observational research s uggests smoking abstinence and breastfeeding reinforce each other . These 
reciprocal associations (a positive feedback loop) have not  yet been leveraged in the design of more effective  
interventions.    
We are proposing the first randomized controlled trial to integrate maternal smoking cessation and 
breastfeeding interventions to enhance both cancer prevention behaviors. We will recruit [ADDRESS_208675] or 2nd trimester of  pregnancy (≤2 8 weeks) from local obstetric clinics , communities, and 
social media . They will be r andomized into either the intervention (N= 20) or control group (N= 20). The two 
groups will complete the same number of sessions (6 during pregnancy and 3 postpartum), but focus on 
different topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102] . Specifically, the control group will receive instructions on general pregnancy and infant care . 
The intervention group will receive instructions on general pregnancy and infant care, plus an integrated 
multicomponent intervention that pro motes both smoking cessation and breastfeeding  (i.e., education and 
counseling, monitoring and feedback, and contingent financial incentives ). Two female Certified Lactation 
Counselors (interventionists) will be trained to run study session s during home visits . Interventionists will 
provide additional support via phone and text messaging until [ADDRESS_208676].

Project description for general s cientific audience  
We are proposing the first randomized controlled trial to integrate maternal smoking cessation and 
breastfeeding interventions to enhance both cancer prevention behaviors.  We will recruit 40 daily smoking 
pregnant women , start integrated  intervention during pregnancy  and continue until 6 months postpartum.  
 
This study involves human subjects only.  
 
This study does not involve vertebrate animals.  
 
  
SPECIFIC AIMS  
Aim 1 : to develop  a protocol for training and mentoring Certified Lactatio n Counselors  to implement  an 
integrated intervention  of maternal smoking cessation and breastfeeding . We hypothesize  Certified Lactation 
Counselors  can be trained to implement our intervention protocol with high fidelity.  
Aim 2 : to examine  the efficacy  of an integrated intervention of maternal smoking cessation and 
breastfeeding on smoking abstinence rate s. We hypothesize smoking abstinence rate s at delivery and  [ADDRESS_208677] smoking abstinence rate at 6 months postpartum will be 
higher than the rate that we previously observed  when our smoking cessation intervention was delivered alone.  
Aim 3 : to examine the  efficacy of our integrated intervention on breastfeeding rate s. We hypothesize 
breastfeeding rate at [ADDRESS_208678] common cancer (102,625 new cases in 2014) and the 
leading cause of cancer death (70,667 deaths in 2014).1 Cigarette smoking is a well -established cause for lung 
cancer, causing 87% of lung cancer deaths in the U.S.2 Fortunately, the elevated risk o f lung cancer due to 
smoking can be largely reversed by [CONTACT_7419] -term smoking cessation.3-5 Pregnancy is a unique opportunity for 
women to quit smoking. About 23% of U.S. women smoke at conception and 54% of them report  quitting 
smoking during pregnancy.[ADDRESS_208679] women who quit smoking during pregnancy return to smoking (“relapse”) 
after delivery, e.g., 45%  and 81% relapse by [ADDRESS_208680] common cancer 
(236,968 new cases in 2014) and the second most common cause of death from cancer (41,211 deaths in 
2014).[ADDRESS_208681] cancer: the longer breastfeeding lasts, t he lower the risk of 
breast cancer.10,[ADDRESS_208682] cancer decreases by 4.3% for 
every 12 months of lifetime breastfeeding.  Accordingly, National Cancer Institute  (NCI)  encourages women to 
breastfeed for [ADDRESS_208683] Cancer also 
recommends that, ‘‘ Breastfeeding reduces the mother’s can cer risk. If you can, breastfeed your baby ’’.[ADDRESS_208684] short er 
breastfeeding duration  (e.g., a mean of 11 vs 28 weeks15) than non -smoking mothers ,15-[ADDRESS_208685] milk by [CONTACT_74639],19,20 smoking -related lactation inhibition ,21-25 and the infant’s refusal of 
breast milk from smoker s due to altered flavor26 and/or nutrient composition.22,27,[ADDRESS_208686], smoking 
cessation during pregnancy is associated with increased breastfeeding intention and practices.29-32 Second ly, 
successful breastfeeding is associated with 30-60% lower  risk of postpartum smoking relapse ,7,33,[ADDRESS_208687] (e.g., depressio n38-40 and anger38) than formula -feeding mothers.  High levels of 
postpartum s tress and negative affect are common  trigger s of postpartum  smoking relapse. However, the 
recipr ocal associations (a positive feedback loop) between maternal smoking abstinence and breastfeeding 
reported in previous observational  studies have been  not considered in existing interventions  yet. An integrated 
interve ntion may achieve larger effect s than traditional interventions that targeted each separately.  
1.4 Our supportive work . Our team has developed  and tested an effective  multicomponent smoking  
cessation intervention  for pregnant smokers  (PI, Wen) .41 As high as 63% (19/30) of our participants quit 
smoking successfully during pregnancy,41 compa red to 6% among pregnant smokers  receiving  usual care in a 
reference population.42 Participants’ intention of exclusively breastfeeding has been doubled by [CONTACT_177597] (39.1% at post -test vs 19.4% at pre -test).43 Quitters are 3.5 times (75% vs 20%) more 
likely to initiate breas tfeeding than persistent  smokers.44 But only a small proportion of our participants remain 
smoking abstinent ( 50%) or  breastfeeding ( 21%) at [ADDRESS_208688] developed  an effective 
intervention to maintain  breastfeeding  among low -income mothers  (PI, Washio ): the breastfeeding rate at 6 
month s postpartum was 72% in the intervention group, compared to 0% in the usual care group.45 
1.5 Clinical -translational relevance  and impacts . This phase 2A clinical trial (proof -of-concept ) will 
test the feasibility and preliminary impact  of an integrated intervention o f maternal smoking cessation and 
breastfeeding . It potentially advances this important field from  the observational  to intervention  phase.

2.2 Recruitment and s creening . We will recruit 40 daily smoking pregnant women from Erie County 
and Niagara County, NY (36,731 births in 2014 -201646). Recruitment flyers will be distributed  in local obstetric 
clinics , communities , and Facebook . Eligible participants  must be at least 1 8 years  old, at ≤28 weeks of 
gestation to ensure adequate time for interventions , and daily smoking cigarettes and/or cigars in the past [ADDRESS_208690] breastfeeding.  
2.3 Randomization . After baseline assessments, the 40 eligible participants  will be random ized i nto 
either the intervention (N= 20) or control group (N= 20). A sequence of random numbers in blocks of 2 will be 
used to ensure equal numbers of participants for each group over time.  
2.4 Intervention 2.4.1 Intervention group: integrated intervention of smoking cessation and 
breastfeeding . The intervention group will receive an integrated intervention of smoking cessation and 
breastfeeding : education and counseling, monitoring and feedback, and contingent financial incentives.41 
Intervention s chedul e. Participants  need to complete 6 weekly prenatal visits and 3  bi-monthly 
postpartum visits  (1, 3, 6 months)  at their own home. T wo female Certified Lactation Counselors (CLCs) will be 
trained as interventionist to run these home  visits . Each home visit will last for  about 60 minutes , which will be 
divided between smoking cessation intervention  and breastfeeding promotion intervention.  Interventionists will 
provide additional support via phone and text messaging until 6 months postpartum.  
Theories -based intervention . Our integrated intervention of smoking cessation and breastfeeding is 
guided by [CONTACT_177598]: the Health Belief M odel (HBM)  47,48 and Contingency M anagement  (CM) .49 According 
to the HBM , an individual behavior (e.g., smoking cessation) depends upon  several  factors: perceived 
susceptibility (e.g., smoking -related ri sk of low birth weight), p erceived severity (e.g., cost and burden to raise a 
low-birth-weight infant), p erceived benefits  (e.g., saving money for baby [CONTACT_177599], removal of guilt of harming the 
baby),  perceived barriers  (e.g., daily stress and fear of  nicotin e withdrawal symptoms), self-efficacy  (e.g., 
smoking craving management) , and  cues to a ction  (e.g.,  fetal ultrasound scan ).50 CM uses stimulus control 
and consequences to change behavior s. Positive behavior (e.g., smoking abstinence) is encouraged by 
[CONTACT_177600]  (e.g., financial incentives), while the undesired behavior (e.g.,  continuous 
smoking or relapse ) is discouraged by [CONTACT_177601].   
Intervention component #1: Education and counseling .  Our educational materials include readings and 
video -taped lectures that address several perceptions in the Health Belief Model through information on 
negative consequences of smoking and non -breastfeeding, benefits of quitting smoking and breastfeeding, 
barriers to quit smoking or breastfeed and related strategies . At each visit, participants  will fi rst take a quiz with 
10 multiple -choice questions on  assign ed educational materials, an d receive  a $[ADDRESS_208691] for passing it (two 
attempts) . Then, the interventionist will conduct behavioral counseling  that focusing on  self-efficacy 
enhancement through 1) planning  for quitting smoking , progress review , feedback, craving analysis, and 
relapse  prevention ; and 2)  making an individualized breastfeeding plan and addressing  concerns including 
previous unsuccessful experience if applicable. After delivery, interventionists will help participants to initiate 
breastfeeding as soon as possible, and solve everyday problems during breastfeeding practices .  
 Intervention component #2: Monitoring and feedback . We will use the Internet and related technology 
(e-Health) to facilitate d aily monitoring of smoking and breastfeeding behaviors. At the first prenatal 
intervention visit , participants will receive a  free personal smartphone -based iCOTM Smokerlyzer  breath carbon 
monoxide  (CO) monitor ( Bedfont Scientific Ltd, Kent, [LOCATION_006] ) and be ins tructed to test their CO level at home 
every day . This device has high validity .51 Breath CO is a sensitive biomarker reflecting recent smoking levels 
and provides timely feedback on smoking reduction  or cessation.  Maternal breath CO levels will also be 
converted into the fetal carboxyhaemoglobin (%COHb)  OR “fetal blood CO”. A high fetal %COHb  indicat es 
fetal hypoxia (lack of oxygen), which can serve as a strong cue to action, i.e., smoking cess ation . After 
delivery, p articipants will receive  a free smartphone -based wireless baby [CONTACT_177602]  (“Hatch Baby [CONTACT_177603] ”, 
Hatch Baby, Inc , Menlo Park, CA ) to monitor their breastfeeding by [CONTACT_177604], which can provide accurate information on how much bre ast milk that the baby [CONTACT_177605]. The 
two smartphone App s will automatically transmit results  to interventionists who can remotely monitor each 
participant’s progress  and provide timely feedback  and assistance .  
 Intervention component #3: Contingent financial incentives . During pregnancy, i f a participant reports 
smoking abstinence  and all her daily breath CO levels since the  last visit are within non -smoking range (≤4 
parts per million or ppm ), she will receive a financial in centive that starts at $10 at the second prenatal 
intervention visit  and escalat es by $5/visit  in next [ADDRESS_208692] . Contingent incentives will start at $2 0/visit at the 1 -month postpartum  visit and 
increase by $10 /visit at the 3 -month and 6 -month postpartum visits .45  
2.4.2 Control group: instructions on general pregnancy and infant care . Participants in t he control group  
will receive usual prenatal care from physicians, nurses, or social workers. They  will receive best standard care 
on smoking cessation and breastfeeding, including referral to the [LOCATION_001] State Smokers' Quitline52 and t he 
Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (W IC).[ADDRESS_208693], participants in the control group will 
complete the same frequency and duration of visits as their counterparts in the intervention group. Instead of  
focusing on  smoking cessation and  breastfeeding , they will receive instructions on general pregnancy and 
infant care. Specifically, they will review  educational materials with quizzes  ($[ADDRESS_208694]/quiz),  and receive 
counseling g uided by [CONTACT_177606] e books : “Your Pregnancy and Childbirth: Month to Month ” published by  
[CONTACT_177607]54 and “ Caring for Your Baby [CONTACT_177608]: Birth to Age 5 ” published by [CONTACT_65746],55 respectively.  
These materials will be also given to the intervention group but without quizzes or counseling . Secondly, the 
control group will earn a total amount of financial compensation ($2 5/prenatal visit and $ 30/postpartum visit) 
that is similar to the intervention group, regardless of smokin g status and feeding practice.

2.4.4  Training the interventionists . The interventionists need to complete 70 -hour training  (Table 2 ). In 
Step 1, they will study educational materials  on smokin g cessation and breastfeeding , the 5As model (ask, 
advise, assess, assist, arrange)  for smoking cessation ,57 behavioral change theories  (HBM47,48 and CM49), and 
counseling skills . In Step 2, they need to complete eth ical and compliance training (CITI) for being involved in 
human research. They  will also learn to follow research protocols, use visit instructions/checklists, run breath 
CO and urine cotinine tests , use wireless devices and small -phone apps to monitor breath CO and infant 
feeding , and ensure safety during home visits . In Step 3, they will observe 5 smoki ng cessation and 
breastfeeding intervention visits in the PI’s clinic. In Step 4, they will run [ADDRESS_208696] s’ readiness will be conducted via exams and trial run s.

2.4.5 Monitoring intervention  (fidelity) . Step -by-step instructions with a 10-item checklist will be used for 
each visit. The interventionists  will take pi[INVESTIGATOR_177592]. H ome 
visits will be audio -recorded for quality assurance and 20% will be randomly sampled for review. The 
interventionists  and research staff  will attend biweekly group meetings to review participants’ process and 
share work experiences. Fidelity of interve ntion delivery will be used for quality improvement.[ADDRESS_208697] will administer a timeline  
follow -back interview59 at enrollment  to assess the participant’s use of cigarettes, cigars,  vapor and electronic 
cigarettes  since conception . Based on their recorded  daily numbers of cigarettes  and cigars  smoked after 
enrollment , we will classify smoking abstinence status in the past 7 days (7 -day point -prevalence).60,61 The self -
reported smoking abstin ence will be biochemically confirmed by [CONTACT_177609] (<50 ng/mL62) using LC -
MS/MS assay s (Kaleida Health Lab, Buffalo, NY) at the end of pregnancy  and 6  months postpartum . 
Participants will be informed that use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT, e.g., gums and patches ), 
electronic cigarettes, or other nicotine -containing products will interfere with urine cotinine tests.  
2.5.2 Breastfeeding  intention and practices .  During pregna ncy, participants will report breastfeeding 
intention using questionnaire s modified from the Infant Feeding Practi ces Study II .63 During postpartum , 
mothers will report feeding method s, frequency and duration of breastfeeding and/or formula use  every month  
until 6 months postpartum . Breastfeeding status will be visually verified  by a female research er, looking for one 
of the following indicators of successful breastfeeding in the infant : audible swallowing, a regular 
suck/swallow/breath pattern, or visible milk in the infant’s mouth after they are not latched anymore.[ADDRESS_208698], visit sequence 
number, and their interaction term (intervention*visit sequence number) being independent variable  (Aim 1 ). 
Smoking abs tinence ( Aim 2) and breastfeeding (Aim 3) rates at 6 months postpartum  will be analyzed by [CONTACT_177610] -
squared tests and multivariable logistic regression models. Independent variables in the model will include 
group (intervention vs control) , fidelity of interven tion delivery, and unbalanced covariates at enrollment. The 
timing of termination of breastfeeding (weaning) will be analyzed with Cox regression. We will use Intent -to-
Treat  analysis  by [CONTACT_177611]. Multiple imputation  with 20 replicates will 
be used to impute missing data.71 
2.8 Sample size . Based on our smoking interventions29,41,60 and reported associations (~50% 
reduction) between breastfeeding and smoking relapse,7,33,34 we estimate smoking abstinence rate at 6 months 
postpartum to be 23.1% (= 30% smoking ces sation by [CONTACT_26094] x [1 00% - 23% postpartum relapse  
rate]) in the intervention group versus  5.5% (= 10% x [1 00% - 45%]) in the control  group. Accordingly, we need 
55 participants  per group  (110 in total)  to detect difference in smoking abstinenc e with  80% power at a 
significance level of 0.05 ( Aim 2 ). Based on our breastfeeding intervention45 and reported associations (~ 50% 
reduction) between smoking and breastfeeding ,29-32,44 we estimate  breastfeeding rate at 6 months postpartum 
to be 31% (=30% quitters x 80% breastfeeding rate + 70% persistent smokers x 10% breastfeeding rate) in the 
intervention group versus  17% (=10% x 80% + 90% x 10%)  in the  control group. Accor dingly, w e will need 126 
participants per group  (252 in total)  to detect difference in breastfeeding rate  in a larger R01  (Aim 3 ). 
Therefore, in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], recruiting 20 participants per group (a total of 4 0) will be sufficient  to test 
feasibility and preliminary impact  of our integrated intervention.

Preliminary data collected from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_177594]-submission of our 
NIH R01 grant  application  (1R01CA230255 -01; 
NCI). Reviewers in the 1st submission rated our  
novel idea of integrating intervention  positively 
with 2 of 3 review ers giving a score of  1 for 
innovation criterion  (see the attached Summary 
Statement ). Primary  concerns  included  the lack 
of pi[INVESTIGATOR_177595] , unclear role of run -in period  and feasibility of biological sample

1.1 Synopsis  
Protocol Title:   Comprehensive Assessment of Erenumab Efficacy in Subjects Wit h 
High Frequency Epi[INVESTIGATOR_880737] 1  Previously Failed Preventive 
Treatment:  a Global, Double -blind, Placebo -controlled Phase  4 Study   
Short Protocol Title:   Erenumab – Comp rehensive Assessment of Effi cacy in 
(High -Frequency) Epi[INVESTIGATOR_720670] ( EMBRACE ) 
Study Phase:   4 
Indication:   Preventive treatment of migraine in adults  
Rationale  
In phase  2 and 3  clinical studies, erenumab has demonstrated a reduction in monthly 
migraine days (MMD) as the primary endpoint.  Since treatment  benefits can extend 
beyond MMD, Study  [ADDRESS_1230894] of erenumab treatment on other 
aspects of migraine, including:  duration and peak severity of pain, functional 
impairment, response to acute treatment, and non -ictal burden.  
Objecti ve(s)/Endpoint(s)  
 
Objectives  Endpoints  
Primary  
 To evaluate the treatment benefit of 
erenumab on headache duration of at 
least moderate pain intensity   Change from baseline in mean monthly 
hours of at least moderate headache pain 
intensity over months  1, 2, and 3  
Secondary  
 To evaluate the treatment benefit of 
erenumab on functional impairment   Change from baseline in mean monthly 
function domain score as measured by [CONTACT_880760] 
(MFIQ) over months  1, 2, and  3: 
 Impact on physical functioning  
 Impact on usual activities  
 Impact on emotional functioning  
 Impact on social functioning  
 To evaluate the treatment benefit of 
erenumab on duration of migraine pain 
of at least moderate intensity   Change from baseline in mean monthly 
average duration  of at least moderate pain 
intensity in migraine attack s occurring  over 
months  1, 2, and  3 (migraine attacks as 
defined in Section  11.1) 
 To evaluate the treatment benefit of 
erenumab on peak migraine pain 
intensity   Change from baseline in mean monthly 
average peak migraine pain intensity as 
assessed by [CONTACT_941] 11 -point Nu meric Rating 
Scale (NRS) over months  1, 2, and  3 
 
Overall Design  
Study  20190008 is a phase  4, interventional, prospective, double -blind, randomized, 
placebo -controlled, multicenter, global study, evaluating the effects of erenumab on 
aspects of migraine beyond MMD reduction in adult subjects with high -frequency 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730] (HFEM) who have previously failed at least [ADDRESS_1230895]:  Erenumab  
Protocol Number:  20190008   
Date:  29 June 2022  Page 9 of 90 
CONFIDENTIAL  FORM -001520, v.24, 21 May 2019   
Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be enrolled in a run -in period (2  weeks in 
duration) , during which they will record oral triptan -treated migraine attacks in an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_880738] (eDiary).  Details of what will be recorded in the eDiary are 
provided in Section  8.2.[ADDRESS_1230896] 
1 qualifying oral triptan -treated migraine attack (defined in Section  11.1) where pain 
freedom (defined as reduction of headache pain severity from moderate or severe to 
none) is not achieved within [ADDRESS_1230897] reports more than 
1 qualifying oral triptan -treated migraine attack where pain freedom is achieved in 
 [ADDRESS_1230898] will be 
eligible to enter the 4 -week baseline period as long as pain freedom in  1 hour following 
oral triptan intake occurs in <  50% of migraine attacks during the run -in period.  During 
the baseline period , subjects will keep a daily eDiary.  At the end of the baseline period, 
subjects who meet specific eligibility criteria will be able to enter the double -blind 
treatment period (DBTP).  
The 4 -month DBTP has 2  phases:  
 Main DBTP (M -DBTP, months  1 to 3) that will assess the effect of erenumab on 
metrics such as time spent in at least moderate pain, peak migraine severity, and 
functional impairment  
 Exploratory DBTP (E -DBTP, month  4) that will assess the impact of erenumab on the 
acute response to oral triptan therapy as well as non -ictal burden  
Through out both phases of the DBTP, investigational product will be administered every 
4 weeks (Q4W).  Data entry will follow a daily eDiary collection during the M -DBTP and 
transition to an epi[INVESTIGATOR_880739] E -DBTP.  
Number of Subjects  
Approximately [ADDRESS_1230899] Eligibility Criteria  
Key inclusion criteria include:  
 Age ≥  18 years upon entry into initial screening  
 Documented history of migraine wit h or without aura according to the International 
Headache Society (IHS) International Classification of Headache Disorders, Third 
Edition (ICHD -III) for  12 months  
 Have HFEM: Defined as history of ≥  7 to <  15 migraine days and <  15 headache 
days per month  on average during the 3  months prior to screening  
 History of ≥  [ADDRESS_1230900] moderate severity per month on average 
during the 3  months prior to screening  
 History of treatment failure with at least 1  preventive treatment for migraine.  Fa ilure 
of preventive treatment for migraine is defined as treatment discontinuation due to 
lack of efficacy, adverse event, or general poor tolerability.  
 Regular use of an oral triptan (using only  eletriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan, or 
zolmitriptan) for acute migraine treatment, and typi[INVESTIGATOR_880740] >  50% of attacks of at least moderate pain intensity.  Regular use 
is defined as ≥  [ADDRESS_1230901]:  Erenumab

migraine prevention that either:  
(a) in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], did not offer any evidence of a therapeutic 
response  
OR 
(b) was discontinued for less than 12  weeks from the date of initial screening  
OR 
(c) was previously discontinued due to a known a dverse drug reaction  
 Currently being treated with lasmiditan and/or a gepant in the acute setting

delivery systems) or sublingual route at the time of screening, during the run -in and 
baseline periods, and throughout the study duration  
For a full list of eligibility  criteria, please refer to Section  5.[ADDRESS_1230902] (140  mg erenumab [2  consecutive injections of 70  mg] or placebo 
[2 consecutive injections]) in prefilled syringes (PFS) will be administered by [CONTACT_464] 
Q4W during the [ADDRESS_1230903]’s epi[INVESTIGATOR_880741].  Once the subject has completed the run -in period and 
is considered eligible to enter the base line period, the subject will be instructed to 
interact with the daily eDiary.  Subjects will use the daily eDiary to report information 
about their migraine and nonmigraine headaches, other migraine -related symptoms, and 
medication taken.  At the day  [ADDRESS_1230904]:  Erenumab  
Protocol Number:  20190008   
Date:  [ADDRESS_1230905] SC Q4W.  During the M -DBTP (months  1 
to 3), subjects will continue to use the daily eDiary and will use the device to complete 
additional clinical outcome assessments.  During the E -DBTP (month  4), subjects will 
use the epi[INVESTIGATOR_880742] 
(Figure  1-1). 
For a full list of study procedures, includin g the timing of each procedure, please refer to 
Section  8.2 and the Schedule of Activities  in Table  1-1. 
Statistical Considerations  
Summary statistics will be computed by [CONTACT_6982].  For continuous 
endpoints, the following descriptive statistics will be computed:  number of observations, 
means, medians, standard deviations, standard errors, first and third quartiles, 
minimums and maximums, and 2 -sided 95%  CIs of the means (CIs will be provided for 
efficacy endpoints only).  For categorical endpoints, the summaries will contain the 
number and percentage of subjects in each category.  
The primary analysis method utilizing a  repeated measures linear mixed effects model 
will include all observed data regardless of treatment adherence.  
A sequential testing procedure will be used to maintain the family -wise type  1 error 
α = 0.05 between the primary and secondary endpoints following the prespecified order 
below.  An endpoint will only be tested for statistical significance if the endpoint tested in 
the previous step is statistically significant at 2 -sided significance level of  0.05.  
1. Primary endpoint: change from baseline in mean monthly hours of at least moderate 
headache pain intensity over months  1, 2, and  3 
2. Secondary endpoints:   change from baseline in mean monthly function domain score 
over months  1, 2, and  3, as measured by [CONTACT_880761]  
 Impact on  physical functioning  
 Impact on usual activities  
 Impact on emotional functioning  
 Impact on social functioning  
3. Secondary endpoint:  change from baseline in mean monthly average duration of at 
least moderate pain intensity in migraine attacks occurring over months  1, 2, and  3 
(migraine attacks as defined in Section 11.1)  
4. Secondary endpoint:  change from baseline in mean monthly average peak migraine 
pain intensity over months  1, 2, and  3, as assessed by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_1230906] 1  migraine preventive 
treatment.

Protocol Number:  20190008  
Date:   [ADDRESS_1230915] on monthly migraine days (MMD) has served as [ADDRESS_1230916] common 
standards in assessing efficacy of treatments for migraine prevention.  Reduction in 
MMD has often been associated with improvements of migraine -related impairments and 
disability in physical function, emotional wellness, work productivity, and general daily 
routine (Silberstein, 2015; Buse  et al, 2009).  However, therapeutic benefit can extend 
beyond the commonly evaluated MMD reduction and its subsequent effects.  Patients 
who may not have experienced a decrease in the number of days spent with migraine 
following preventive treatment have anecdotally rep orted improvement, which has been 
described as attacks of lesser severity and duration, migraine -associated symptoms of 
lesser severity, and faster and/or better response to acute medications.  
In phase  2 and  3 clinical studies, erenumab demonstrated a redu ction in MMD as the 
primary endpoint as well as improvement in function (Dodick  et al, 2018; 
Goadsby  [CONTACT_2297], 2017; Tepper  et al, 2017).  Study  [ADDRESS_1230917] of 
erenumab treatment on other aspects of migraine, including duration and peak severity 
of pain, functional impairment, response to acute treatment, and non -ictal burden.  
2.2 Background  
2.2.1  Disease  
Migraine is a debilitating disease with worldwide prevalence of approximately 11.7% in 
the [LOCATION_002] (US), 14.6% in Canada, 14.7% in Eu rope, and 8.4% in Japan 
(Stovner  and Andree, 2010; Lipton  et al, 2007; Sakai  and Igarashi, 1997).  Migraine is 
characterized by [CONTACT_880762] [ADDRESS_1230918] 2  of the following pain characteristics:  u nilateral, pulsating, moderate or 
severe intensity, or aggravated by [CONTACT_238960].  In addition, the migraine 
attacks are often accompanied by [CONTACT_33234], vomiting, and sensitivity to light 
(photophobia) and sound (phonophobia).  Migraine is divid ed into [ADDRESS_1230919] classifications 
based on the frequency of attacks:  epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730] (EM) and chronic migraine (CM).  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_169006] <  15 headache days per month, while CM is 
characterized by ≥  [ADDRESS_1230920]:  Erenumab  
Protocol Number:  20190008  
Date:   29 June 2022  Page 19 of 90 
CONFIDENTIAL  FORM -001520, v.24, 21 May 2019   
support that they are a continuum of the same disorder.  A common pathophysiology is 
supported by [CONTACT_880763] (Aurora  and Wilkinson, 2007; Afridi  et al, 2005; 
Aurora  et al, 2005; Welch  et al, 2001).   
Migraine attacks are typi[INVESTIGATOR_880745] c ontaining caffeine, non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, 
and migraine -specific abortive medications such as triptans .  Acute treatments are used 
to reduce the impact of attacks (ie,  pain severity and duration) once a migraine begins.  
Patients experienci ng frequent and/or disabling migraine attacks often require prevention 
(prophylaxis) (Silberstein  et al, 2012; Evers  et al, 2009 ) in addition to acute medications 
for breakthrough attacks.  Preventive treatments are used to reduce the frequency and 
overall  severity of attacks in such individuals.  
Approximately 25 to 30of the migraine population has 4  or more migraine days per 
month (Houle  et al, 2013; Lipton  et al, 2007), which is generally considered a threshold 
for recommending preventive therapy.  How ever, based on published epi[INVESTIGATOR_56983], only 12.4 of people with migraine received any preventive therapy due in part to 
limited efficacy and significant tolerability and safety issues associated with available 
preventive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (Lipton  et al, 2007).  Thus, m igraine prophylaxis remains an area of 
unmet medical need.  
2.2.[ADDRESS_1230921] Background:  Erenumab  
Erenumab is a human immunoglobulin G2 monoclonal antibody that is directed against 
the canonical calcitonin gene -related peptide (CGRP) receptor, blocking the action of 
CGRP.  Erenumab has an approximate molecular weight of 150  kDa and is produced in 
genetically engineered mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cells.  
As of the date of approval of this protocol, erenumab has been approved in over 
70 countries.  The recommended dosage is 70  mg once monthly (QM) and, in most 
countries, 140  mg QM is indicated for some patients who may benefit from a higher 
dose.  The erenumab dose being used in this study is 140  mg.  For additional 
information, refer to Section  4.3. 
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety  of erenumab  
is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure .

2.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment  
Erenumab [ADDRESS_1230922] of migraine on physical functioning (as measured by [CONTACT_880764]), as well as improvements in a range of other 
patient -reporte d outcomes, favorable tolerability (over oral standard of care 
prophylactics), low treatment discontinuation rates, convenience (QM self -administered 
injections), and rapid onset of effect.  
Specifically in Study  20120296, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_265005] [ADDRESS_1230923] 3  months 
(months  4, 5, and  6) of the 24 -week double -blind treatment phase for 70  mg and  140 mg 
erenumab compared with placebo (difference in least square mean [LSM] [95%  CI] 
of -1.40 [-1.88,  -0.92] for 70  mg and -1.85 [-2.33,  -1.37] for 140  mg) 
(Goadsby  [CONTACT_2297], 2017).  The benefits of the 140  mg QM dose in a difficult -to-treat EM 
patient popu lation with a history of 2  to 4 prior preventive treatment failures were further 
confirmed by a phase  3b randomized controlled trial where 30% of patients treated with 
erenumab experienced ≥  50% reductions from their baseline MMD compared with 14% 
in the p lacebo group (odds ratio 2.7  [95%  CI 1.4-5.2]; p  = 0.002) (Reuter  et al, 2018).  
Overall, the safety profile of erenumab has been favorable in clinical studies.  No 
important identified risks or important potential risks have been observed.  Furthermore, 
a limited number of adverse drug reactions (injection site reactions, constipation, and 
muscle spasms) have been identified at low frequencies (  5%) in clinical studies.  In 
postmarketing settings, immune system disorders (hypersensitivity reactions includ ing 
rash, angioedema, and anaphylactoid reactions); gastrointestinal disorders (constipation 
with serious complications and oral sores); and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
(alopecia and rash) have been observed.   
The safety and efficacy of erenuma b have not been established in migraine patients with  
major cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic  attack, 
unstable angina, coronary artery by[CONTACT_4897], or other revascularization  procedures 
within 12  months prior to s creening), in the long -term use of erenumab, or in  elderly 
patients  [ADDRESS_1230924]:  Erenumab

4. Study Design  
4.1 Overall Design  
Study  20190008 is a phase  4, interventional, prospective, double -blind, randomized, 
placebo -controlled, multicenter global study, evaluating the effects of erenumab on 
aspects of migraine beyond MMD reduction in adult subjects with high -frequency 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730] (HFEM) who have previously failed at least 1  preventive treatment.  
Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be enrolled in a run -in period (2  weeks in 
duratio n), during which they will record oral triptan -treated migraine attacks in an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_880738] (eDiary).  Details of what will be recorded in the eDiary are 
Product:  Erenumab  
Protocol Number:  20190008  
Date:   [ADDRESS_1230941] 1  or more qualifying oral 
triptan -treated migraine attacks (defined as migraine attacks of at least moderate peak 
pain intensity that are treated with an oral triptan within [ADDRESS_1230942] 
moderate severity) and if pain freedom is not achieved within 1  hour following oral triptan 
intake for >  50% of thei r qualifying migraine attacks.  During the baseline period , 
subjects will keep a daily eDiary.  At the end of the baseline period, subjects who meet 
specific eligibility criteria will be able to enter the double -blind treatment period (DBTP).   
The 4 -month  DBTP has 2  phases:  
 Main DBTP (M -DBTP, months  1-3) that will assess the effect of erenumab on metrics 
such as time spent in at least moderate pain, peak migraine severity, and functional 
impairment  
 Exploratory DBTP (E -DBTP, month  4) that will assess the im pact of erenumab on the 
acute response to treatment with oral triptan therapy as well as non -ictal burden  
Throughout both phases of the DBTP, investigational product will be administered every 
4 weeks (Q4W).  Data entry will follow a daily eDiary collection during the M -DBTP and 
transition to an epi[INVESTIGATOR_880739] E -DBTP.  
The overall study design is described by a study schema in Section  1.2.  The endpoints 
are defined in Section  3. 
4.2 Number of Subjects  
Approximately 576 subjects will be enrolled in the study, with approximately 288 subjects 
per treatment group . 
Subjects in this clinical investigation shall be referred to as “subjects”.  For the sample 
size justification, see Section  9.2.

The 140  mg dose has been selected as the treatment dose because it achieved 
incremental efficacy in a comparable patient population during phase  2 and  3 clinical 
studies.  In phase  3 Study  20120296 ( Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of 
Erenumab in Migraine Prevention [STRIVE]) in subjects with EM, the erenumab 140  mg 
treatment arm experienced a numerically greater reduction from baseline in MMD 
compared with 70  mg (Goadsby  [CONTACT_2297], 2019 ).  Furth ermore, in a post -hoc analysis of 
STRIVE, subjects with 2  or more prior treatment failures in the 140  mg erenumab arm 
had an average MMD reduction nearly 2 -fold greater than those in the 70  mg erenumab 
arm.  The safety profile of both erenumab doses was co mparable to placebo with only 
slightly greater incidence rates of constipation adverse events and influenza adverse 
events for the 140  mg dose compared with the 70  mg dose (Goadsby  [CONTACT_2297], 2019 ). 
4.4 End of Study  
4.4.1  End of Study Definition  
If the study concl udes prior to the primary completion date originally planned in the 
protocol (ie,  early termination of the study), then the primary completion will be the date 
when the last subject is assessed or receives an intervention for evaluation in the study 
(ie, last subject last visit).  
End of Study:   The end of study date is defined as the date when the last subject 
across all sites is assessed or receives an intervention for evaluation in the study (ie,  last 
subject last visit), following any additional parts in  the study (eg,  long-term follow -up, 
additional antibody testing), as applicable.  For this study, the end of study date is the 
date when the last subject has completed the assessments for week  16. 
4.4.2  Study Duration for Subjects  
The total study duration for subjects who successfully complete the study will be up to 
25 weeks.   
4.5 Patient Input on Study Design  
Patient input was not collected during study design.  
5. Study Population  
Investigators will be expected to maintain a scr eening log of all potential study 
candidates that includes limited information about the potential candidate (eg,  date of

5.[ADDRESS_1230959] Enrollment  
Before subjects begin  participation in any study -specific activities/procedures, [COMPANY_010] 
requires a copy of the site’s written institutional review board/independent ethics 
committee (IRB/IEC)  approval of the protocol, informed consent form, and all other 
subject information and /or recruitment material, if applicable (see Section  11.3). 
The subject  must personally sign and date the IRB/IEC and [COMPANY_010] approved informed 
consent before commencement of study -specific procedures.  
A subject is considered enrolled when the investi gator decides that the subject has met 
all eligibility criteria.  The investigator is to document this decision and date, in the 
subject’s medical record and in/on the enrollment case report form (CRF).  
Each subject who enters into the screening period for the study (screening period starts 
when the subject signs and dates the informed consent form ) receives a unique subject 
identification number before any study -related activities/procedures are performed.  The 
subject identification number will be assigne d via interactive response technology (IRT) .  
This number will be used to identify the subject throughout the clinical study  and must be 
used on all study documentation related to that subject.  
The subject identification number must remain constant through out the entire clinical 
study; it must not be changed after initial assignment, including if a subject is 
rescreened.  This number will not necessarily be the same as the randomization number 
assigned for the study.

[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1230987] Questionnaire (MFIQ)  
The MFIQ is a self -administered [ADDRESS_1230988] of migraine on 
broader functioning (ie,  Physical, Usual Activities, Social, and Emotional).  It has 
4 domains:  Imp act on Physical Functioning (5  items), Impact on Usual Activities 
(10 items), Impact on Social Functioning (5  items), and Impact on Emotional Functioning 
(5 items).  In addition, there is [ADDRESS_1230989] 7  days.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Migraine Symptom Severity Scale (MSSS)  
The MSSS is a 7 -item questionnaire that assesses frequency of pain and other 
symptoms associated with migraines.  Responses are as follows: “never,” “rare ly,” “less 
than half the time,” “half the time or more,” and “all or nearly all of the time”.  The 
responses are given a value from 1 to 3 as follows and summed:  Never  = 0, Rarely  = 1, 
Less Than Half the Time  = 2, Half the Time or More  = 3, and All or Nea rly All of the 
Time  = 3.  The MSSS score is the sum of the [ADDRESS_1230990].  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1230991] troublesome 
“non-headache pain” symptom (during and between migraine attacks) has changed 
since the start of the study on a scale of  1 (Very Much Improved) to  7 (Very  Much 
Worse).   
[IP_ADDRESS].4  Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI -S) 
The PGI -S is a single question that rates the severity of the patient’s condition at the 
time of assessment, relative to the patient’s experience prior to treatment.  It is a 7 -point 
scale that ranks severity of illness using 1  of the following response categories:  
1 = Normal, not at all ill, 2  = Borderline ill, 3  = Mildly ill; 4  = Moderately ill, 5  = Markedly 
ill, 6 = Severely ill, and 7  = Most extremely ill.

or commitments, and emotional/affective and cognitive distress.  Each of the 4  questions 
is responded to using  1 of 6 response categories: “Don’t know/NA” (Score  = 0), “Never” 
(Score  = 0), “Rarely” (Score  = 1), “Some of the time” (Score  = 2), “Much of the time” 
(Score  = 3) or “Most or all of the time” (Score  = 3).  Each questio n is multiplied with its 
score and summed up to produce total score ranges from  0 to 12.  The MIBS -4 total 
scores are categorized into 4  level of interictal burden: None  (0), Mild  (1 to 2), 
Moderate  (3 to 4) and Severe  (5 or higher).  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1230993] ( HIT-6) 
The HIT -[ADDRESS_1230994]'s 
clinical status over a short period of time.  Six questions cover severe pain, limitation of 
daily activity (household, work, school and social), wanting to lie down when headache is 
experienced, feeling too tired to work or do daily activities because of he adache, feeling 
"fed up" or irritated because of headache, and headache limiting ability to concentrate or 
work on daily activities.  Each of the 6  questions is responded to using 1  of 5 response 
categories: "never," "rarely," "sometimes," "very often," or  "always".  
For each HIT -[ADDRESS_1230995] (49 or less), some impact (50 to 55), substantial impact (56 to 59), and severe 
impact (60 to 78) due to headache.  No recall period is specified for the first [ADDRESS_1230996] 3  items.  
[IP_ADDRESS].7  Pain Ca tastrophizing Scale (PCS)  
The PCS is a [ADDRESS_1230997]’s characteristic 
level of pain -related, catastrophic thinking during painful experiences 
(Sullivan  et al, 1995).  The measure consists of 3  subscales, which are  Rumination 
(4 items), Magnification (3  items), and Helplessness (6  items).  Participants are asked to 
recall a painful experience and to rate the extent to which the thoughts and emotions 
listed in each item had occurred.  For each item, subjects are requ ested to provide a 
response in a 5 -point Likert scale (0  “not at all,” 1  “to a slight degree,” 2  “to a moderate 
degree,” 3  “to a great degree,” 4  “all the time”).  Higher scores in PCS indicate higher 
levels of catastrophizing and both the original PCS and  its headache version have been 
well validated across both experimental studies as well as clinical samples.  Both

8.2.4  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting and Reporting Safety 
Event Information  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Adverse Events  
The adverse event grading scale to be used for this study will be the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and is described in Section  11.4. 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events observed by [CONTACT_880776] e end of study  are reported using the Event CRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1230999] that occur after signing of the informed 
consent  through end of study  are reported using the Event CRF.  
All serious adverse events will be collected, recorded and reported to the sponsor or 
designee within 24  hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event, as indicated in 
Section  11.4.  The investigator  will submit any updated serious adverse event data to the 
sponsor within 24  hours of it bein g available.  
The criteria for grade  4 in the CTCAE grading scale differs from the regulatory criteria for 
serious adverse events.  The investigator is to determine whether these grade  4 
abnormalities are serious adverse events based on the definition of serious adverse  
events as per Appendix  4 (Section  11.4). 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1231000], then these serious adverse events will be reported to [COMPANY_010] 
within 24 hours following the investigator’s awareness of the event.  
Product:  Erenumab  
Protocol Number:  20190008  
Date:   [ADDRESS_1231001]’s records after the subject ends the study.  
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of adverse events, 
adverse device effects,  and serious adverse events and the procedures for completing 
and transmitting serious adverse event reports are provided in Section  11.4. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting adverse events and/or serious 
adverse events.  Open -ended and non -leading verbal questioning of the subject is the 
preferred method to inquire about adverse event occurrence.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow -up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
After the initial adverse event/serious adverse event report, the investigator is required to 
proactively follow each subject at subsequent visits/contacts.  All adverse events and 
serious adverse events will be followed until resolution, stabilization, until the event is 
otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up (as d efined in Section  7.3).  
Further information on follow -up procedures is  given in Section  11.4. 
All new information for previously reported se rious adverse events must be sent to 
[COMPANY_010] within [ADDRESS_1231002] be consistent with that 
recorded on the Event CRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events  
If subject is permanently withdrawn from protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21889] a 
serious adverse event, this information must be submitted to [COMPANY_010].  
Prompt notification by [CONTACT_880777] a study treatment under clinical investigation are met.

investigation.  The sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRBs/IECs, and investigators.  
Individual safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected ser ious adverse 
reactions according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded 
to investigators as necessary.  
An investigator who receives an individual safety report describing a serious adverse 
event or other specific safety informati on (eg,  summary or listing of serious adverse 
events) from the sponsor will file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify 
the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
To comply with worldwide reporting regulations for serio us adverse events, the treatment 
assignment of subjects who develop serious, unexpected, and related adverse events 
may be unblinded by [CONTACT_21960].  Aggregate 
analyses may also be unblinded by [CONTACT_880778], as appropriate.  
Investigators will receive notification of related serious adverse events reports sent to 
regulatory authorities in accordance with local requirements.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Monitoring Plan  
Subject safety will be routinely monitored as defined in Amg en’s safety surveillance and 
signal management processes.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pregnancy and Lactation  
Details of all pregnancies and/ or lactation in female subjects and female partners of 
male subjects  will be collected after the start of study treatment and until [ADDRESS_1231003] . 
If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator is to inform [COMPANY_010] within 24  hours of learning 
of the pregnancy and/or lactation and is to follow the procedures outlined in 
Section  11.5.  [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety will follow -up with the investigator regarding 
additional information that may be requested.  
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg,  spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, and ectopic pregnancy) are considered serious adverse events.  
Further details regarding pregnancy and lactation are pro vided in Section  11.5.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Device Effects  
In order to fulfill regulatory reporting obligations worldwide, the investigator is 
responsible for the detection and documentation of any adverse device effects that occur 
during the study with such devices.  
An adverse device effect is any adverse event related to the use of a combination 
product or medical device.  Adverse device effects include adverse events resulting from 
insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, adverse events resulting from any 
malfunction of the device, or adverse events res ulting from use error or from intentional 
misuse of the device.  
All adverse device effects are to be reported as adverse events following the same 
reporting periods and procedures.  
Product complaints are described in Section  6.1.[ADDRESS_1231004] of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the 
Schedule of Activities ( Table  1-1) for the timing and frequency.  
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and recording any 
clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the Event CRF.   
All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Section  11.2, must be 
conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the Schedule of Activities 
(Table  1-1).  
Pregnancy Testing  
A urine pregnancy test should be completed for females of childbearing potential as per 
the Schedule of Activities ( Table  1-1).   
Note:  Females who have undergone a bil ateral tubal ligation/occlusion should have 
pregnancy testing per protocol requirements.  (If a female subject, or the partner of a 
male subject, becomes pregnant it must be reported on the Pregnancy Notification 
Form, see Figure  11-3).  Refer to Section  11.5 for contraceptive requirements.   
Additional on -treatment pregnanc y testing may be performed at the investigator’s 
discretion or as required per local laws and regulations.

additional samples are collected for this part of the study.  For subjects who consent to 
this/these analysis/analyses, DNA may  be extracted from the cell pellet collected in the 
plasma tube used for the biomarker development sample.  
The final disposition of samples is described in Section  11.6.  
8.2.7  Biomarkers   
Biomarkers are objectively measured and evaluat ed indicators of normal biologic 
processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic 
intervention.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Biomarker Development/Future Research  
Biomarker Development refers to using samples collected for Biomarker Discovery for 
future res earch after the study ends.  
Biomarker development can be useful in developi[INVESTIGATOR_54495], guide therapy, and/or predict disease severity.   
If consent is provided by [CONTACT_1766], biomarker discovery samples collected at the time 
points specified in the Schedule of Activities will be retained for future biomarker 
development as described in Appendix  6 (Section  11.6).  
[COMPANY_010] or another third -party manufacturer may attempt to develop test(s) designed to 
identify subjects most likely to respond positively or negatively to erenumab to 
investigate and further un derstand migraines.

Missing data in safety data will not be imputed.  
9.4 Statistical Analyses  
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed and finalized before database lo ck.  
Below is a summary of the timing and methods for the planned statistical analyses.  To 
preserve study integrity, the final analysis will be conducted and reported following the 
end of study, as defined in Section  4.4.1 . 
9.4.1  Planned Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Analysis  
The primary analysis (or final analysis since there is only 1 milestone analysis for this 
study) will occur after all subjects have completed their week  16 visit (or discontinued 
from the study).  The DBTP treatment assignment will be unblinded and all efficacy and 
safety analyses will be conducted and reported by [CONTACT_880780].  
9.4.2  Methods of Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS]  General Considerations  
Summary statistics will be computed by [CONTACT_6982].  For continuous 
endpoints, the following descriptive statistics will be computed:  number of observations, 
means, medians, standard deviations, standard errors, first and third quartiles, 
minimums and maximums, and 2 -sided 95%  CIs of the means (CIs will be provided for 
efficacy endpoints only).  For categorical endpoints, the summaries will contain the 
number and perc entage of subjects in each category.  
The primary analysis method utilizing a repeated measures linear mixed effects model 
will include all observed data regardless of treatment adherence.  
A sequential testing procedure will be used to maintain the family -wise type  1 error 
α = 0.05 between the primary and secondary endpoints following the prespecified order 
below.  An endpoint will only be tested for statistical significance if the endpoint tested in 
the previous step is statistically significant at 2 -sided significance level of 0.05.

the local IRB/IEC.  
Informed Consent Process  
An initial sample informed consent form is provided for  the investigator to prepare the 
informed consent document to be used at his or her site.  Updates to the sample 
informed consent form are to be communicated formally in writing from the [COMPANY_010]  Trial 
Manager to the investigator.  The written informed consen t form is to be prepared in the 
language(s) of the potential patient population.  
The investigator or his/her delegated representative will explain to the subject the aims, 
methods, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study before any 
protoco l-specific screening procedures or any investigational product(s) is/are 
administered, and answer all questions regarding the study.   
Subjects must be informed that their participation is voluntary.  Subjects will then be 
required to sign a statement of i nformed consent that meets the requirements of 
[ADDRESS_1231027] requirements, where applicable, and the [IRB/IEC]  or study site.  
The medical record must include a statement t hat written informed consent was obtained 
before the subject was enrolled in the study and the date the written consent was 
obtained.  The authorized person obtaining the informed consent must also sign the 
informed consent form.  
The investigator is also responsible for asking the subject if the subject has a primary 
care physician and if the subject agrees to have his/her primary care physician informed 
of the subject’s participation in the clinical study unless it is a local requirement.  The 
investigato r shall then inform the primary care physician.  If the subject agrees to such 
notification, the investigator is to inform the subject’s primary care physician of the 
subject’s participation in the clinical study.  If the subject does not have a primary ca re 
physician and the investigator will be acting in that capacity, the investigator is to 
document such in the subject’s medical record.  
The acquisition of informed consent is to be documented in the subject’s medical 
records, and the informed consent form  is to be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_177157].  Subject

withdrawal of consent or discontinuation from study treatment and/or procedures must 
also be documented in the subject’s medical records; refer to Section  7. 
Subjects must be re -consented to the most current version of the informed consent 
form(s) during their participation in the study.  
The original signed informed consent form is to be retained in accordance with 
institutional policy, and a copy of the informed consent form(s) must be provided to the 
subject.  
A subject who is rescreened is not required to sign another informed consent form if the 
rescreening occurs within 30 days from the previous informed consent form signature 
[CONTACT_568]. 
The informed consent form (ICF) will contai n a separate section  that addresses the use 
optional portions of this study.  The investigator or authorized designee will explain to 
each subject the objectives of the future research.  Subjects will be told that they are free 
to refuse to participate and  may withdraw their specimens at any time and for any 
reason during the storage period.  A separate signature [CONTACT_22862] a 
subject’s agreement to allow any remaining specimens to be used for future research.  
Subjects who decline to parti cipate will not provide this separate signature.  
Data Protection/Subject Confidentiality  
The investigator must ensure that the subject’s confidentiality is maintained for 
documents submitted to [COMPANY_010].  
Subject will be assigned a unique identifier by [CONTACT_97280].  Any subject records or 
datasets that are transferred to the sponsor will contain the identifier only; subject names 
or any information which would make the subject identifiable will not be transferred.  
On the case report form (CRF) demographics pag e, in addition to the unique subject 
identification number, include the age at time of enrollment.  
For serious adverse events reported to [COMPANY_010], subjects are to be identified by [CONTACT_21969], initials (for faxed reports, in ac cordance with local 
laws and regulations), and age (in accordance with local laws and regulations).  
Documents that are not submitted to [COMPANY_010] (eg,  signed informed consent forms) are to

In compliance with governmental regulations/ICH GCP Guidelines , it is required that the 
investigator and institution permit authorized representatives of the company, of the 
regulatory agency(s), and the IRB/IEC  direct access to review the subject’s origina l 
medical records for verification of study -related procedures and data.  Direct access 
includes examining, analyzing, verifying , and reproducing any records and reports that 
are important to the evaluation of the study.   
The investigator is obligated to inform and obtain the consent of the subject to permit 
such individuals to have access to his/her study -related records, including personal 
information.  
Publication Policy  
To coordinate dissemination of data from this study, [COMPANY_010] may facilitate the format ion 
of a publication committee consisting of several investigators and appropriate [COMPANY_010] 
staff, the governance and responsibilities of which are set forth in a Publication Charter.  
The committee is expected to solicit input and assistance from other inves tigators and to 
collaborate with authors and [COMPANY_010] staff, as appropriate, as defined in the Publication 
Charter.  Membership on the committee (both for investigators and [COMPANY_010] staff) does 
not guarantee authorship.  The criteria described below are to be me t for every 
publication.  
Authorship of any publications resulting from this study will be determined on the basis 
of the Uniform Requirement for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals 
International Committee of Medical Journal Editors Recommendations  for the Conduct of 
Reporting, Editing, and Publications of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals, which states:  
Authorship credit is to be based on:  (1)  substantial contributions to conception and 
design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation  of data; (2)  drafting the article 
or revising it critically for important intellectual content; (3)  final approval of the version to 
be published; and (4)  agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in 
ensuring that questions related to the ac curacy or integrity of any part of the work are 
appropriately investigated and resolved.  Authors need to meet conditions  1, 2, 3, and  4. 
When a large, multicenter group has conducted the work, the group is to identify the 
individuals who accept direct res ponsibility for the manuscript.  These individuals must 
fully meet the criteria for authorship defined above.  Acquisition of funding, collection of 
data, or general supervision of the research group, alone, does not justify authorship.  All 
persons design ated as authors must qualify for authorship, and all those who qualify are

(including an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease (new or 
exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a treatment, combination 
product, medical device or procedure.  
 Note:  Treatment -emergent adverse events will be defined in the statistical 
analysis plan (SAP).  
 
Even ts Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
 Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) 
or other safety assessments (eg,  electrocardiogram, radiological scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, that are considered 
clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator 
(ie, not related to progression of underlying disease).  
 Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either a n 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
 New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study.  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspecte d drug -drug interaction.  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
treatment or a concomitant medication.  Overdose per se will not be reported as an 
adverse event/serious adverse event unless it is an intentional ov erdose taken with 
possible suicidal/self -harming intent.  Such overdoses are to be reported 
regardless of sequelae.  
 “Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se will not be 
reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event.   Such instances will be 
captured in the efficacy assessments.  However, the signs, symptoms, and/or 
clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as adverse event or 
serious adverse event if they fulfill the definition of an adverse e vent or serious 
adverse event.

Events NOT Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
 Medical or surgical procedure (eg,  endoscopy, appendectomy):  the condition that 
leads to the procedure is the adverse event.  
 Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
 Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) 
present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
A Serious Adverse Event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, 
meets at least 1 of the following serious criteria:  
Results in death (fatal)  
Immediately life -threatening  
The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event, 
which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_880758], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5184] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12332]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office  or 
outpatient setting.  Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_155967].  If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], 
the event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred  or was 
necessary, the adverse event is to be considered serious.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85766] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not 
considered an adverse event.  
Results in persistent or significant disability/inc apacity  
The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomi ting, 
diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg,  sprained ankle) which may interfere 
with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.

Section  6.1.[ADDRESS_1231032] of [COMPANY_010]  medical devices).  
Adverse Device Effect Definition  
An adverse device effect is any adverse event related to the use of a combination 
product or medical device.  Adverse  device effects include adverse events resulting 
from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, adverse events resulting from any 
malfunction of the device, or adverse events resulting from use error or from 
intentional misuse of the device.  A Serious Adverse Event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, 
meets at least  1 of the following serious criteria:  
Other medically important serious event  
Medical or scientific judgment is to be exercised in deciding whether serious adverse 
event reporting is appropriate in other  situations such as important medical events that 
may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_155968] [ADDRESS_1231033]:  Erenumab

Recording Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Recording  
 When an adverse event or serious adverse event occurs, it is the responsibility of 
the investigator to review all documentation (eg,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], 
laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related to the event.  
 The investigator will then record all relevant adverse event/serious adverse event 
information in the Event case report form (CRF).  
 The investigator must assign the following adverse event a ttributes:  
o Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or 
symptoms);  
o Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved);  
o Severity (or toxicity defined below);  
o Assessment of relatedness to investigational product  and 
o Action taken.  
 If the severity of an adverse event changes from the date of onset to the date of 
resolution, record as a single event with the worst severity on the Event CRF.  
 It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_9238]’s medical 
records to spon sor in lieu of completion of the Event CRF page.  
 If specifically requested, the investigator may need to provide additional follow -up 
information, such as discharge summaries, medical records, or extracts from the 
medical records.  In this case, all subjec t identifiers, with the exception of the 
subject number, will be blinded on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_238945] . 
 The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical in formation.  In such cases, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the adverse event/serious 
adverse event.  
Evaluating Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Assessment of Severity  
The investigator will make an assessment of severity for each adverse event and 
serious adverse event reported during the study.  The assessment of severity will be 
based on:  
The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events , version  4.03 which is available 
at the following location:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm .

CONFIDENTIAL  FORM -001520, v.24, 21 May 2019   
Assessment of Causality  
 The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between investigational 
product, device  and each occurrence of each adverse event/serious adverse 
event.  
 Relatedness means that there are facts or reasons to support a relationship 
between investigat ional product and the event.  
 The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
 Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other 
risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to stu dy treatment 
administration will be considered and investigated.  
 The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.  
 For each adverse event/serious adverse event, the inve stigator must document in 
the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the adverse event/serious adverse 
event and has provided an assessment of causality.  
 There may be situations in which a serious adverse event has occurred and the 
investigator has minimal  information to include in the initial report.  However, it is 
very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for 
every event before the initial transmission of the serious adverse event data.  
 The investigator may change his/he r opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up 
information and send a serious adverse event follow -up report with the updated 
causality assessment.  
 The causality assessment is 1  of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements.  
 
Follo w-up of Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event  
 The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by 
[CONTACT_54558]/or causality of the adverse event or serious 
adverse event as fully as possible.  This may include additional laboratory tests or 
investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health 
care profession als. 
 If a subject is permanently withdrawn from protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21889] 
a serious adverse event, this information must be submitted to [COMPANY_010].  
 If a subject dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up 
period, the in vestigator will provide [COMPANY_010] with a copy of any post -mortem 
findings including histopathology.  
 New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed Event 
CRF.  
 The investigator will submit any updated serious adverse event data to [COMPANY_010]  
within [ADDRESS_1231034]:  Erenumab

Date:   29 June 2022  Page 77 of 90 
CONFIDENTIAL  FORM -001520, v.24, 21 May 2019   
Reporting of Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse Device Effects:  Recording, Evaluating and Reporting  
 Any adverse event resulting from an adverse device effect that occur during the 
study will be documented in the subject’s medical records, in accordance with the 
investigator’s normal clinical practice, and on the Event CRF page.  
 It is very important that the investigator provides his/her assessment of causality 
(relationship to the medical device provided by [CONTACT_11337] ) at the time of the initial 
report and describes any corrective or remedial actions taken to prevent recurrence 
of the  incident.  
 Serious Adverse Event Reporting via Electronic Data Collection Tool  
 The primary mechanism for reporting serious adverse event will be the electronic 
data capture (EDC) system.  
 If the EDC system is unavailable for more than 24  hours, then the site will report 
the information to [COMPANY_010] using an electronic Serious Adverse Con tingency Report 
Form (see Figure  11-1) within 24  hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the 
event.  
 The site will enter the serious adverse event data into the electronic system as 
soon as it becomes available.  
 After the study i s completed at a given site, the EDC system will be taken off -line to 
prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.  
 If a site receives a report of a new serious adverse event from a study subject or 
receives updated data on a previously report ed serious adverse event after the 
EDC has been taken off -line, then the site can report this information on a paper 
Serious Adverse Event Report Form (see Figure  11-2). 
 Once the study has ended, serious adverse event(s) suspected to be related to 
investigational product will be reported to [COMPANY_010] if the investigator becomes aware  
of a serious adverse event.  The investigator should use the paper -based Serious 
Adverse Event Contingency Report Form to report the event.

subject of childbearing potential and that the vasectomized partner has received 
medical assessment of the surgical success)  
 Sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the 
entire period o f risk associated with the study treatments; the reliability of sexual 
abstinence must be evaluated in relation to the duration of the trial and the preferred 
and usual lifestyle of the subject)  
 Male or female condom with or without spermicide  
 Cap, diaphra gm or sponge with spermicide  
 Double barrier method:  the male uses a condom and the female may choose either 
a cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide (a female condom is not an option due 
to the risk of tearing when both partners use a condom)  
Unacceptable Methods of Birth Control for  Female Subjects  
Birth control methods that are considered unacceptable in clinical trials include:

 After obtaining the female subject’s signed authorization for release of pregnancy 
and infant health information, the investigator will collect pregnancy and infant 
health informati on and complete the pregnancy questionnaire for any female subject 
who becomes pregnant while taking protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44817] 16 weeks  
of the study drug.  This information will be forwarded to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient 
Safety.  Generally, infant foll ow-up will be conducted up to 12  months after the birth 
of the child (if applicable).  
 Any termination of pregnancy will be reported to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety, 
regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for 
procedure.  
 While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an adverse event or serious adverse 
event, any pregnancy complication or report of a congenital anomaly or 
developmental delay, fetal death, or suspected adverse reactions in the neonate will 
be reported as an  adverse event or serious adverse event.  Note that an elective 
termination with no information on a fetal congenital malformation or maternal 
complication is generally not considered an adverse event, but still must be reported 
to [COMPANY_010] as a pregnancy exp osure case.  
 If the outcome of the pregnancy meets a criterion for immediate classification as a 
serious adverse event (eg,  female subject experiences a spontaneous abortion, 
stillbirth, or neonatal death or there is a fetal or neonatal congenital anomaly) the 
investigator will report the event as a serious adverse event.  
 Any serious adverse event occurring as a result of a post -study pregnancy which is 
considered reasonably related to the study treatment by [CONTACT_093], will be 
reported to [COMPANY_010] Global  Patient Safety as described in Section  11.4.  While the 
investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former study 
subjects, he or she may learn of a serious adverse event through spontaneous 
reporting.  
 Any female subject who becomes pregnant while participating will discontin ue study 
treatment  (see Section  7.1 for details).  
Male Subjects With Partners Who Become Pregnant  
 In the event a male subject fathers a child during treatment, and for an additional 
16 weeks  after discontinuing protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], the information will be 
recorded on the Pregnancy Notification Form.  The form (see Figure  11-3) must be

11.6 Appendix  6.  Sample Storage and Destruction  
Any blood (biomarker or pharmacogenetic)  sample collected according to the Schedule 
of Activities ( Table  1-1) can be analyzed for any of the tests outlined in the protocol and 
for any tests necessary to minimize risks to study subjects.  This includes testing to 
ensure analytical methods produce reliable and valid data throughout the course of the 
study.  This c an also include, but is not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, 
incurred sample reanalysis, and analyses for method transfer and comparability. 
All samples and associated results will be coded prior to being shipped from the site for 
analysis  or storage.  Samples will be tracked using a unique identifier that is assigned to 
the samples for the study.  Results are stored in a secure database to ensure 
confidentiality. 
If informed consent is provided by [CONTACT_423], [COMPANY_010] can do additional test ing on 
remaining samples (ie,  residual and back -up) to investigate and better understand 
migraines , the dose response and/or prediction of response to erenumab , and 
characterize aspects of the molecule (eg,  mechanism of action/target, metabolites). 
Result s from this analysis are to be documented and maintained, but are not necessarily 
reported as part of this study.  Samples can be retained for up to [ADDRESS_1231048]’s medical record and are not to be 
made available to the subject, members of the family, the personal physician, or other 
third parti es, except as specified in the informed consent.  
The subject retains the right to request that the sample material be destroyed by 
[CONTACT_21947].  Following the request from the subject, the investigator is to 
provide the sponsor with the req uired study and subject number so that any remaining 
blood  samples and any other components from the cells can be located and destroyed. 
Samples will be destroyed once all protocol -defined procedures are completed.  
However, information collected from sam ples prior to the request for destruction, will be 
retained by [CONTACT_11337].  
The sponsor is the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or derivative materials from 
the sample materials and is responsible for the destruction of the sample(s) at the 
request of t he subject through the investigator, at the end of the storage period, or as 
appropriate (eg,  the scientific rationale for experimentation with a certain sample type no

2 This is a phase II open label study on the use of Ibrutinib on the inhibition of food -induced anaphylaxis in 
adults with food allerg y.  Ibrutinib (brand name [CONTACT_517726]) is currently FDA approved for the treatment of 
mantle cell lymphoma  (MCL) , chronic lymphocytic leukemia  (CLL) , and Waldenstrom’s macroglobulineia  
(WM) .  We propose to administer this  approved  drug to adults with food allergy to inhibit anaphylaxis.  
STUDY SCHEMA  
This is open -label study consists of [ADDRESS_671343] length of time , from two days to up to 7 days , needed for ibrutinib to fully  inhibit tests for food 
allergy, and to determine the length of persistence of efficacy  after the drug is stopped .  Part 2  is 
designed to determine the ability of ibrutinib, optimally dosed as defined in Part 1, to prevent signs and  
symptoms of anaphylaxis  during a food challenge in food -
allerg ic subjects .    
   
Part 1 : At Visit [ADDRESS_671344] s will be screened for eligibility  (history, skin prick test 
[SPT] to peanut /tree nuts  with histamine and saline SPT 
positive and negative controls, respectively , basophil 
activation test [BAT], peanut  or tree nut -specific IgE).  [ADDRESS_671345] procedures for BAT, sIgE to peanut /tree nuts  
and components, quantitative immunoglobulins ( QUIGs ), 
eosinophil and basophil enumeration , as well a s screening 
for toxicities (see below).   After this visit, subjects will be given ibrutinib (two 
doses of 420 mg of ibrutinib to start the following day and to be taken orally at 
8am exactly 24 hours apart) and return for Visit [ADDRESS_671346] and 
phlebotomy for testing preformed in an identical manner to Visit 1. If two 
consecutive doses of 420 mg of ibrutinib given 24 hours apart is insufficient 
to cause >80% inhibition of the SPT and BAT response, subjects will be 
given two additional doses of 420 mg of ibrutinib to continue to take at 8am 
exactly 24 hours apart for two more days, and return for Visit 3 for identical 
repeat testing as in Visits 1 and 2.  If four consecutive doses of 420 mg of 
ibrutinib given 24 hours apart is insufficient to cause >80% inhibition of the 
SPT and BAT response, subjects will be given three additional d oses of [ADDRESS_671347] 
SPT and BAT to be suppressed.  Once both the SPT and  BAT 
responses are inhibited, no further ibrutinib doses will be given, 
and subjects will return on a weekly basis until both the peanut /tree nut  PST and BAT return to at least 
80% of baseline values.  At this point, Part [ADDRESS_671348] been completed.  At each visit, patients will be 
monitored for toxicities, including CBC, CMP, and pregnancy testing.   Prior to drug initiation and at the 
end of the trial, an E KG will be performed.  
 
Part 2: Visit 1  will be identical to those for Part 1 except that  subjects will take a higher dose of ibrutinib 
(560mg daily) for 2 days and a single -blind, placebo -controlled ( SBPC) graded food challenge of up to 8 
mg of peanut  or tree nut  protein, administered over  escalating doses , will be performed in a monitored at 
the study site in a clinical research unit (CRU) setting.  Prior to the SBPC  food challenge, [ADDRESS_671349]’s baseline threshold dose for pea nut/tree nut  reactivity.    
 
Once a confirmed reaction occurs , the food challenge will be terminated and the reaction treated until it 
has resolved.  Within [ADDRESS_671350] will then 
begin taking ibrutinib 560 mg orally daily for 2 days, w hich is the minimum number of doses that Clinical protocol for part 1 (top) and part 2 
(bottom).  + or - = predicted response; ??? =

1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Disease Background  
Food allergy is a potentially life threatening disease, and its prevalence continues to increase 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_517706]  (1,2)  Newer studies have shown that it is less likely that a subject  will 
lose their food allergies over time and food allergies can also start in adulthood, so more adults 
now have life -threatening food allergies.  Near fatal and fatal reactions can occur of subject s with 
food allergies and can lead to devastating results  (3,4).  Furthermore, the economic burden of 
childhood food allergy is nearly $25 billi on per year, including 200,000 emergency department 
trips annually  (5).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_517707], there are currently no approved 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_517708].  Standard of care is constant vigilance in avoidance of allergen, and 
use of self -injected epi[INVESTIGATOR_517709] a reaction has occurred.  Therefore, there is a large unmet 
need for new therapeutics to prevent serious allergic disease including food allergy and 
anaphylaxis.  Newly FDA approved BTK inhibitors such as ibrutinib (as well as others under 
development  (6,7)) may be able to fill this void, and offer a therapy to these subject s.   
1.2 Study Drug Background and Associated Known Toxicitie s 
Ibrutinib is a once daily, oral, selective, irreversible small -molecule inhibitor of Bruton’s  tyrosine 
kinase (BTK),  a key component of B -cell receptor signaling  (8,9).  BTK is also essential for FcεRI 
signaling and triggering of mast cells and b asophils  (10){Iyer, 2011 #[ZIP_CODE];Kuehn, 2008 
#[ZIP_CODE];MacGlashan, 2011 #8797} .  It is currently FDA approved for the treatment of Mantle Cell 
Lymphoma  (MCL) , Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia  (CLL) and Wa ldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia  
(WM) . 
 
In subject s with recurrent B -cell lymphoma, >90% irreversible occupancy of the BTK active site in 
peripheral blood mononuclear ce lls was observed up to 24 hours after ibrutinib doses of >/= 2.5  
mg/kg/day.  Ibrutinib is absorbed with a median Tmax o f 1-2 hours.  It is metabolized by 
[CONTACT_9058] P450 and CYP3A, and has a half -life of 4 -6 hours.  The majority (80%) is fecally 
excreted.  
 
The approved CLL and WM  dose (420 mg orally once daily) has been shown to inhibit allergy test 
responses in cancer subject s receiving this drug by 1 week of treatment  (the earliest time point 
examined) in preliminary data from our group .  The 560  mg dose (used for MCL) has similar side -
effect and toxicity profiles as the lower dose.  Initial data from Part [ADDRESS_671352] partially (in some cases fully) inhibit skin test responses to peanut and tree nuts 
in allergic subjects  after just [ADDRESS_671353] s receiving ibrutinib chronically include bleeding events (5% of MCL 
subject s), infection (25% of MCL subject s), myelosuppression (41% of subject s), and renal 
toxicity has also been reported.  Ibrutinib is also pregnancy category D.  This underscores our 
goal of finding the fewest possible doses to achieve the anti -allergy effect we are seeking, which 
could be as few as just [ADDRESS_671354] cells and basophi ls via 
their surface expression of FcεRI in allergy.  Crosslinking of the receptor is known to activate a 
number of SRC -family kinases (e.g., LYN, SYK) required for receptor function. BTK is a key 
PROTOCOL                                                                                                                                                      Version: Aug 7, [ADDRESS_671355] cells a nd basophils.  Since signaling 
mediated by [CONTACT_95962]εRI aggregation is thought to require the activity of BTK  (8,9), MacGlashan et . al. 
(9) tested ibrutinib, formerly known as PCI -[ZIP_CODE], for its ability to prevent activation of human 
basophils in vitro. For stimulation with anti -IgE, ibrutinib inhibited CD63, CD203c and CD11b 
upregulation, and release of histamine, LTC4 and IL -4 as well as th e cytosolic calcium response 
(IC90 of ≈50 nM).  Ibrutinib did not inhibit basophil activation by [CONTACT_517719] C5a and did not inhibit 
IL-[ADDRESS_671356] individuals with a potentially 
severe allergy.

4.0 TREATMENT PLAN  
4.1 Treatment Dosage and Administration  
 
For Part 1 of the study, we will determine the length of treatment (i.e., the number of daily 
doses) required to inhibit both basophil and food skin test responses.  Preliminary data 
demonstrates that [ADDRESS_671366] s will take ibrutinib 420  mg, by [CONTACT_16629] 
(every 24 hours) on an out patient  basis.  After two days, the subject  will undergo blood 
testing and SPT to assess  basophil and mast cell re activity.  If both tests are negative, 
Part [ADDRESS_671367]  will take 2 more days 
of ibrutinib (same dose , for a total of 4 doses ), and identical  testing will be  repeated. If 
testing is not negative at day 4, the subject  will take 3 more days of ibrutinib (same dose ,

suppress both the BAT and SPT .  
PROTOCOL                                                                                                                                                      Version: Aug 7, [ADDRESS_671368] s will take ibrutinib  560 mg once daily by [CONTACT_1966]  (every 
24 hours) for 2 days, which is  the minimum number of days required to cause ≥80% 
inhibition of food SPT and BAT responses as determined in part 1.  Part [ADDRESS_671369] a 
minimum of 3 days. 
 
Dose -limiting tox icity (DLT) includes any grade 3 or 4  hematologic toxicity, grade 3 
hepatotoxicity or increase in creatinine x  2.5 normal limit.  DLT will be monitored at each 
visit, at any time during treatment.   
 
Maximally tolerated dose (MTD) will occur at the point DLT occurs.  Ibrutinib is approved 
as a daily medi cation for another indication, and we propose to use the drug in adults 
only at its approved oral dosing of [ADDRESS_671370] or ALT >3 times normal range, creatinine > 2.5 times normal 
range.  DLT evaluation will be completed throughout the study, anytime during treatment.   
 
In healthy volunteers, co -administration with CYP3A inhibitors increased C max, and 
therefore the drug will not be concomitantly administered with strong or moderate 
inhibitors of CYP3A ( for example, “ azole ” medications and subject s will be advised 
against drinking grapefruit juice ). 
4.[ADDRESS_671371]  will be assessed for the development of toxicity according  to the Time and Events 
table ( Section 5.4 ).  
 
At each visit, subject s will be monitored for toxicities.  If a subject  develops a grade 3 or 4 
hematologic, renal, or hepatotoxicity, the medication will be stopped.  Toxicities with 
grades are listed below.

 SBPC  oral food challenge as follows:  
 
All oral food challenges (OFC) shall be performed as single  (patient) -blind ed, placebo 
controlled food challenges according to standard published guidelines (11, 12).  
Placebo challenge and active challenge will be performed in that order on the same day 
if the subject has no symptoms during the first (placebo) challenge.  If a reaction 
requiring treatment occurs during the first challenge, the next challenge should not be 
performed until the symptoms  have subsided.  Oral food challenge to peanut or tree nut 
protein will be performed according to standard operating procedure.  At physician 
discretion, based upon history and possible subjective or very mild objective symptoms 
during a challenge, dosing intervals may be  extended . 
 
Actions to minimize risk of severe allergic reactions during oral food challenge (OFC):  
Prior to the OFC visit, subjects will be told to contact [CONTACT_517721], fever, acute infections inclu ding upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_58776], rashes or change in status of chronic medical conditions.  OFCs will be 
rescheduled in the event that any of these occur. Study staff will contact [CONTACT_1766] 1 -3 
days before the OFC to inquire about recent symptoms.  
 
All OF Cs will be conducted in the Clinical Research Unit within the main hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
Intravenous access will be obtained before the OFC begins.  Emergency medications 
(epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], diphenhydramine, cetirizine, albuterol, ranitidine) will be immediately 
accessible  in the subject’s room.  All OFCs will be conducted by [CONTACT_517722] a clinician with experience in performing OFCs and trained in the 
treatment of anaphylaxis.  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (assessment of pulmonary function) will be 
performed prior to  the onset of the OFC. Vital signs and pulse oximetry will be obtained 
at baseline and prior to each dose of the food allergen and q15 minutes thereafter with 
an observation period of at last [ADDRESS_671379] dose is consumed (longer should a 
reactio n occur).  The OFC will begin with a low dose, which will increase incrementally.  
At physician discretion, based upon history and possible subjective or very mild 
objective symptoms during a challenge, dosing intervals may be extended .  The 
procedure will be stopped when clear objective symptoms are noted.  
 
Subjects will be discharged after a period of observation appropriate to the nature of the 
symptoms.  They will receive information regarding possible delayed manifestations 
and home trea tment.  All subjects will be provided with an epi[INVESTIGATOR_107528] -injector to 
take home (if they do not have one already) and instructions on how and when to use it.

16 7.1.2 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use  
Prior studies of ibrutinib adverse events were performed on cancer patients who had 
often failed other treatments, and were treated chronically.  However, A dvani et . al. (13) 
reported side effects in a phase [ADDRESS_671393] duration of 
treatment that has been reported in the literature .  In that study, a total of 56 patients with 
a variety of relapsed B -cell malignancies were treated over seven dosage cohorts (1.25 - 
12 mg/kg/day) .  For the cohort receiving dosages closest to the one being used in our 
study (a total of 6 subjects given 5 mg/kg/da y, or 420 mg/day for an 81  kg person) the 
most common adverse events were typi[INVESTIGATOR_37333] 1 or 2 in severity.  Grade 3 or 4 
events were infrequent and independent of dose.  Data from this cohort of 6 subjects was 
extracted and reproduced from Table 3  of the Advani et. al. paper below.  For the entire 
cohort of 56 subjects, Grade 3 -4 hematologic toxicities included neutropenia (12.5%), 
thrombocytopenia (7.2%) and anemia (7.1%) .  According to the authors , no evidence of 
cumulative hemat ologic or non-hematologic toxicity was observed in patients with 
prolonged dosing , nor was any consistent relationship  seen  between dose level and 
adverse events .   
 
 
As the subjects  enrolled in this study  will be generally health y except for food allergy,  and 
on ibrutinib for a much shorter duration  (maximum of 7 days, perhaps as little as 2 days) , 
we expected adverse events to be milder and less frequent, if at all, compared  to prior 
studies of ibrutinib in cancer trials .  However, for completeness, adver se events as 
documented with chronic use are detailed below.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hemorrhage  
Five percent of patients with MCL had Grade 3 or higher bleeding events 
(subdural hematoma, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hematuria). Overall, bleeding 
events including bruis ing of any grade occurred in 48% of patients with MCL 
treated with 560 mg daily.  
The mechanism for the bleeding events is not well understood.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Infections  
Fatal and non -fatal infections have occurred with ibrutinib  therapy. At least 25% 
of patients with MCL had infections Grade 3 or greater NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events CTCAE) (14). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Myelosuppression  
Treatment -emergent Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias  were reported in 41% of patients. 
These included neutropenia (29%), thrombocytopenia (17%) and anemia (9%). 
Monitor complete blood counts monthly.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Renal Toxicity  
Fatal and serious cases of renal failure have occurred with ibrutinib  therapy. 
Treatm ent- emergent increases in creatinine levels up to 1.5 times the upper limit 
of normal occurred in 67% of patients and from 1.5 to 3 times the upper limit of 
normal in 9% of patients. Periodically monitor creatinine levels. Maintain 
hydration.

17 [IP_ADDRESS] Embr yo-Fetal Toxicity  
Based on findings in animals, ibrutinib  can cause fetal harm when administered 
to a pregnant woman. Ibrutinib caused malformations in rats at exposures [ADDRESS_671394] to a fetus.  
7.1.3  Interaction with other medications  
As stated, metabolism o f ibrutinib is inhibited by [CONTACT_097]3A  inhibitors.  Patients on 
these medications will be excluded.  
7.1.4  Adverse Reactions  
As per package insert  (15), adverse reactions are listed in Section 7.1.[ADDRESS_671395] commonly occurring adverse reactions ( approx. 20%) were 
thrombocytopenia, di arrhea, neutropenia, anemia, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, 
peripheral edema, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], nausea, bruising, dyspnea, 
constipation, rash, abdominal pain, vomiting and decreased appetite.  
The most common Grade 3 or 4 non -hematological adverse reactions ( approx. 
5%) were pneumonia, abdominal pain, atrial fibrillation, diarrhea, fatigue, and 
skin infections.  
Adverse reactions from the MCL trial (N=111) using single agent IMBRUVICA 
560 mg daily occurring at a rate of approx.  10%.  
Ten patie nts (9%) discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions in the trial 
(N=111). The most frequent adverse reaction leading to treatment 
discontinuation was subdural hematoma (1.8%). Adverse reactions leading to 
dose reduction occurred in 14% of patients.  
Patients with MCL who develop lymphocytosis greater than 400,000/mcL have 
developed intracranial hemorrhage, lethargy, gait instability, and headache. 
However, some of these cases were in the setting of disease progression.  
Forty percent of patients had elev ated uric acid levels on study including 13% 
with values above 10 mg/dL. Adverse reaction of hyperuricemia was reported for 
15% of patients.   
8.[ADDRESS_671396] s experiencing an adverse event, regardless of its relationship  to study drug /device , will

8.1 Definitions  
8.1.1  Definition of Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward m edical occurrence in a subject  receiving 
study treatment and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an experimental intervention, whether or not related to 
the intervention.  
8.1.2  Severity of Adverse Events  
The severity of an AE is graded as follows:  
 
Mild (grade 1):  the event causes discomfort without disruption of no rmal daily 
activities.  
 
Moderate (grade 2):  the event causes discomfort that affects normal daily 
activities.  
 
Severe (grade 3):  the event makes the subject  unable to perform normal daily 
activities or significantly affects his/her clinical status.  
 
Life-threatening (grade 4):  the subject  was at risk of death at the time of the 
event.  
 
Fatal (grade 5):  the event caused death.  
8.1.3  Serious Adverse Events  
A “serious” adverse event is defined in regulatory terminology as any untoward 
medical occurrence that:  
[IP_ADDRESS]       Results  in death.  
If death results from (progression of) the disease, the disease  should 
be reported as event (SAE) itself.  
[IP_ADDRESS]       Is life -threatening.  
(the subject  was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not 
refer to an event that hypotheti cally might have caused death if it were 
more severe).  
PROTOCOL                                                                                                                                                      Version: Aug 7, 2017

19 [IP_ADDRESS]        Requires in -subject  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_75095] ≥ 24 hours . 
[IP_ADDRESS]        Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
[IP_ADDRESS]        Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
[IP_ADDRESS]        Is an important medical event . 
 
Any event that does not meet the above criteria, but that in the judgment of the 
investigator jeopardizes the subject , may be considered for reporting as a serious 
adverse event . The event may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in the definition of “Serious Adverse Event“. For 
example: allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home; convulsions that may not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; development 
of drug abuse or drug d ependency.  
8.2 Steps to Determine If an Adverse Event Requires Expedited Reporting  
Step 1 : Identify t he type of adverse event . 
 
Step 2 : Grade the adverse event . 
 
Step 3 : Determine whether the adverse event is related to the protocol therapy  
Attribution categories are as follows:  
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be  related  to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
Note : This includes all events that occur within [ADDRESS_671397] dose of treatment and 
is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent(s) must also be reported 
accordingly.  
 
Step 4 :  Determine the prior experience of the adverse event .  
Expected events are those that have been previously identified as resulting from 
administration of the agent . An adverse event is considered unexpected, for expedited 
reporting purposes only, when either the type of event or the severity of the event is not 
listed in:  
 the current known adverse events listed in the Agent Information Section of this 
protocol;  
 the drug package insert;  
 the current Investigator’s Brochure  
8.3 Reporting Requirements for Adverse Events  
8.3.1  Expedited Reporting  
 The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_9960] [ADDRESS_671398] administration of the study drug .  
 The Northwestern University IRB  must be notified within 5 business days of 
any unanticipated problems involving ri sk to  subjects or others ( UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961] ). 
The following events meet the definition of UP IRSO:

which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_89644], 
involved risk to subjects or others, and was possibly related to the 
research procedures.  
2. Any serious accidental or unintentional change to the IRB -approved 
protocol that alters the level of risk.  
3. Any deviation from the protocol taken without prior IRB review to 
eliminate apparent imm ediate hazard to a research subject.  
4. Any new information (e.g., publication, safety monitoring report, updated

9.0 DRUG INFORMATION  
9.1 Ibrutinib 140  mg tablets  
 Other names for the drug(s) /device : Imbruvica®  
 Classification - type of agent /device : small molecule BTK inhibitor  
 
Mode of action:  Ibrutinib forms a covalent bond with a cysteine residue in the BTK active 
site, leading to inhibition of BTK enzymatic activity.  BTK is a signaling molecule of the B -
cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. BTK’s role in signaling 
through the B -cell surface receptors results in activation of pathways necessary for B -cell 
trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion. Nonclinical studies show that ibrutinib inhibits 
malignant B -cell proliferation and survival in vivo as well as cell migration an d substrate 
adhesion in vitro.  
 Storage and stability:   Ibrutinib is stored at room temperature and the tablets are 
stable.  
 Protocol dose: 420 or 560 mg once daily for 2 -7 days  
 Preparation:  as supplied from the manufacturer  
 Route of administration for thi s study:  By [CONTACT_1966]  
 Incompatibilities:  N/A 
PROTOCOL                                                                                                                                                      Version: Aug 7, 2017

10.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Descriptive statistics will be completed to determine an 80% reduction in skin prick wheal size 
and basophil activation test reactivity (as determined by % inhibition of anti -IgE-induced  CD63 
expression) .  As this is an open label study, each patient’s  responsiveness will be examined 
compared to themselves prior to initiation of treatment.  
10.1 Study Design/Study Endpoints  
This is an open label study of ibrutnib in  [ADDRESS_671401] of pretreatment with ibrutinib on food allergen 
reactivity in food allergic subjects give n ibrutinib 420  or 560 mg daily for 2 -7 doses .  
Given the nature  of the study, it will be stopped if >50% of patients have a DLT at target 
enrollment .  
10.2 Sample Size and Accrual  
12 subjects allows 80% power to detect a reduction in skin test positivity rate from 100% 
before treatment to 15% after treatment using a one -sided 0.05 level McNemar’s test.   
Patients will be recruited from the allergy clinics at Northwestern University Feinberg 
School of Medicine with a diagnosis of peanut (or tree  nut) allergy by a board certified 
allergist -immunologist.  
 
10.3 Data Analyses Plans  
As this is an open label trial, descriptive statistics will be used.  Each patient will be 
compared to him/h erself prior to beginning treatment and at each time point in the study 
to assess SPT size (parts 1 and 2), BAT response (parts 1 and 2), and OFC threshold 
and response (part 2).   
11.[ADDRESS_671402] with this study (patent ownership, royalties, 
or financial gain greater than the minimum allowable by [CONTACT_1385], etc.) must have 
the conflict reviewed by  [CONTACT_517724].   All investigators  will 
follow the University conflict of interest policy . 
PROTOCOL                                                                                                                                                      Version: Aug 7, [ADDRESS_671403] (IRB) Approval and Consent   
It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in accordance 
with federally mandated regulations . The IRB should approve the consent form and 
protocol.  
 
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply with the 
applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
and to ethica l principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
  
Before recruitment and enrollment onto this study, the subject  will be given a full 
explanation of the study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent form. 
Each consent fo rm must include all the relevant elements currently required by [CONTACT_10000]. Once this essential information has been 
provided to the subject  and the investigator is assured that the subject  understands the 
implicatio ns of participating in the study, the subject  will be asked to  give consent to 
participate i n the study by [CONTACT_10001] -approved consent form.  
 
Prior to a subject ’s participation in the trial, the written informed consent form should be 
signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_279218].  
11.3 Data Management and Monitoring /Auditing  
As has been done previously for the phase 1 study of ibrutinib  (13), adverse events will 
be monitored throughout treatment and toxicities will be assessed using the National 
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for AEs, with its latest version, currently 
version 4.03.   
11.[ADDRESS_671404](s) to trial subjects without prior IRB approval .  
 
For any such emergency modification implemented, a IRB modification form 
must be completed within  five (5) business days  of making the change .  
11.4.2 Other Protocol Deviations/Violations  
All other planned deviations from the protocol must have prior approval by [CONTACT_101451] [INVESTIGATOR_72616] . According to the IRB, a protocol deviation  is 
any unplanned variance from an IRB approved protocol that:  
 Is generally noted or recognized after it occurs  
 Has no substantive effect on the risks to research participants  
 Has no substantive effect on the scientific integrity of the research plan or t he 
value of the data collected  
 Did not result from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the 
investigator(s).  
 
An unplanned protocol variance is considered a violation  if the variance:  
 Has harmed or increased the risk of harm to one or more resear ch 
participants.  
PROTOCOL                                                                                                                                                      Version: Aug 7, 2017

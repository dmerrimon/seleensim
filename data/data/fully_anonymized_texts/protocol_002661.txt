variables; cardiac assessments ; measurement of protocol specified vital signs ; 
performance status and physical evaluations; concomitant medication use; and 
other protocol -specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of

indicated.  
 
Study Design  Phase 2a study - Stage 1  
 
Dose -Escalation and Maximum Tolerated Dose  
The dose -escalation portion of the study (Stage 1) will use  a standard "3 + 3" 
design  to determine the MTD for the QD dosing schedule.  
 
The initial dose level for QD dosing will be 60  mg (Dose Level  0), and the dose 
level will be increased in 15  mg increments in successive cohorts until an MTD 
is reached. It is expected that approximately  12 patients with newly -diagnosed 
GBM will be enrolled.  
 
Dose -Escalation  Rules  
Dose -escalation will occur in Stage 1:  
• The initial dose (Dose Level 0) for QD MTD determination will be 60 mg. 
Dose levels will increase in 15 mg steps;  
• The dose -escalation  portion of the study (Stage 1) will use a standard  
"3 + 3" desig n to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of GDC -0084 
administered orally in 28 -day cycles ; 
• A minimum of 3 patients will be enrolled in each cohort.  If none of these 
patients experiences a DLT within the DLT assessment period (Day 1 - 
28), escalation will proceed to the next highe r dose level by [CONTACT_785315] r dose cohort with newly recruited patients.  
• If 1 patient experiences a DLT, the cohort will be expanded until a 
second patient experiences a DLT or to a maximum of 6 patients. When 
a second patient has a DLT, the MTD is determined as 1  dose level 
below the current dose level;  i.e. the highest dose level at which less 
than 1/3 of patients (e.g. 1 of 6) experiences a DLT will be declared the 
MTD.  
If 2 or more  patients experience a DLT at Dose Level 0, the MTD will 
be declared at 45  mg, which was the MTD established in the previous 
phase I study in patients with advanced glioma  with a QD dosing 
schedule .  On the basis of the review of real -time safety data and 
available preliminary PK data from this study with GDC -0084, dose -
escalation  may be halted or modified by [CONTACT_785316].  
 
Decisions regarding dose -escalation and selection will be made by a CRC 
including the medical monitor, recruiting Investigators, sponsor representative 
and any other relevant and necessary expert on as needs basis, according to 
the CRC charter.  
 
Definition of Dose Limiting Toxicity  
All AEs, including DLTs, will be reported, with severity assessed according to 
National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events ( CTCAE), version 4.03. For dose -escalation purposes, DLT 
assessments will be performed by [CONTACT_785317].  
 
A DLT is defined as any one of the following toxicities occurring within the DLT 
assessment window (Cycle 1, Days 1−28) and assessed by [CONTACT_785318]: Kazia Therapeutics Limited

In the expansion portion (Stage 2), 20 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio 
to receive GDC -0084 either under fasted or fed conditions . 
 
Statistical 
Analysis  Analysis Populations : 
 
• The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population includes all randomized patients; 
ITT analyses will be conducted on the basis of the arm assigned at 
randomization  
• The Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) population  includes a ll eligible 
patients who received at least [ADDRESS_1080233]-baseline  tumor response data;  
• Safety population  (SAF) : All eligible patients who received at least 1 
dose of GDC -0084 will be included in the safety population. Safety 
analyses will be conducted on the basis of initial received treatment;   
• PK population: All eligible patients in the safety population who have an 
adequate concentration vs. time profile to determine PK parameters ; 
• A Per -Protocol (PP) subset will also be used to analyze endpoints of 
clinical benefit and will be based on study drug exposure (compliance 
and/or time on study drug) and major protocol deviations. The criteria 
for inclusion in the PP subset will be finalized and documented prior to 
database lock.  
 
Timing of Analyses:  
Regular cohort safety reviews will be performed as described above during 
Stage [ADDRESS_1080234] 
clinical benefit endpoints will be evaluated.  
 
A final analysis will be performed when all patients discontinue treatment and 
comple te their End of T reatment  visit. Supplement al analyses may be performed 
at the completion of the study but  will be considered exploratory . 
 
General Considerations:  
Data from Stage 1 and Stage 2 may be summarized separately. For Stage 1  
assessment, summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_317234]. For Stage 
2, summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_2939] (fed versus fasting)  and overall.  
Select ed safety parameters may be summarized using pooled data from the 
selected dose level in Stage 1 and fasted patients in Stage 2.  
 
There may be a statistical comparison of C max/AUC between fasted and fed 
patient data in stage 2.  
 
Descriptive statistics (N, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and 
maximum) will be presented for continuous variables. Geometric means and 
coefficient of variation will also be presented for PK data. Frequency distributions 
(counts and associated p ercentages) will be presented for categorical variables.

The primary analysis of time to event endpoints (OS, TTP, and PFS) from Stage 
2 will be based on the mITT and/or PP as appropriate.  
For exploratory analyses, DCR will be compared between treatment arms using 
Fisher’s exact test. The difference in the proportion of responders and 
corresponding 95% CI (based on the Hauck -Anderson approach) will also be 
displayed. The blinded central review disease response assess ments will be 
used as the primary measure for analysis, and the Investigator disease response 
assessments will be used as supportive measures for analysis.  
 
Safety Analysis:  
All safety analyses will be conducted in the safety population.  
AEs will be coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). The severity of AEs will be graded according to the [LOCATION_002] 
NCI CTCAE, version 4.03.  
TEAEs are defined as any AE occurring or worsening on/after the first study drug 
dose and within [ADDRESS_1080236] dose date. TEAEs leading to study drug 
discontinuation, TEAEs leading to dose reduction/interruption, TEAEs related to 
study drug, SAEs, TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation, and TEAEs with 
an outcome of death will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313], and preferred

CONFIDENTIAL  18 3 Introduction  
3.1 Indication  
GDC -0084 is a potent, oral, selective small molecule inhibitor of class I phosphoinositide 3 -kinase and 
mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/mTOR) and was efficacious in nonclinical models of tumors 
driven by [CONTACT_785324]3K pathway. GDC -[ADDRESS_1080255] on brain cancers such as 
gliomas, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most serious and aggressive form of primary 
brain cancer.  
GDC -0084 is being developed for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed GBM with 
unmethylated O6-methylguanine -methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter status in the adjuvant  setting 
following surgical resection  and standard concomitant chemoradiation therapy  with temozolomide 
(XRT/ TMZ).  
3.2 Background  
Gliomas comprise a heterogeneous group of neoplasms that differ in morphology, location within the 
central nervous system, extent of invasiveness , tendency to progression, and response to treatments. 
Gliomas are categorized by [CONTACT_785325], astrocytomas (GBM being the 
most common astrocytoma), oligodendrogliomas, and mixed gliomas. Gliomas are further categorized 
according to grade, w hich is determined by [CONTACT_785326]. High -grade gliomas, 
categorized as Worl d Health Organization (WHO) Grade III –IV, are highly malignant with poor 
prognosis. GBM is synonymous with WHO Grade IV astrocytoma and is the most aggressive form of 
the glial tumors, characterized by [CONTACT_785327], angioge nesis, and 
extensive infiltration. GBM is the most common primary brain tumor, accounting for 16.7% of all brain 
and central nervous system tumors and approximately 50% of all gliomas  (Ostrom, Gittleman et al. 
2014 ). Standard therapy of GBM includes surgical resection/debulking followed by [CONTACT_785328] (XRT/TMZ) or other chemotherapy. Evidence of common genetic 
abnormalities in signal transduction pathways that control angiogenesis and ce ll growth and survival 
have led to the development of new treatments that target molecules in these signaling pathways. 
However, there is no cure for GBM, the majority of patients relapse with a poor prognosis, and new 
treatment options are still needed.  
PI3K and mTOR are lipid and protein kinases, respectively, that are involved in tumor cell 
proliferation, survival, and migration upon activation by [CONTACT_235300]. PI3K 
catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol -4,5-bisph osphate (PIP2) to generate 
phosphatidylinositol -3,4,5 -trisphosphate (PIP3)  (Cantley 2002 ), a second messenger involved in the 
phosphorylation of Akt and associated proteins in the Akt/mTOR pathway  (Guertin and Sabatini 
2007 ). Activating and transforming mutations, as well as amplification, in the p110  subunit of PI3K 
are commonly found in solid and hematologic tumors. In addition, the PI3K/Akt pathway is activated in 
numerous types of cancer by [CONTACT_785329] (PTEN)  (Shayesteh, Lu et al. 1999 , Cantley 2002 , Massion, Taflan et al. 2004 , Wu, 
Mambo et al. 2005 ). 
Activation of the phosphoinositide 3 -kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) 
pathway has been implicated in several types of cancer (Ward, Sotsios et al. 2003 , Cantley 2004 , 
Guertin and Sabatini 2007 ), including primary brain cancers such as GBM (McLendon, Friedman et 
al. 2008 , Parsons, Jones et al. 2008 , Fan and Weiss 2010 ). Loss of PTEN expression or function, and 
dysregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that exert downstream effects on PI3K are common 
in GBM. Activating mutations in PIK3CA (the gene encoding the p110 catalytic subunit PI3Kα) and 
mutations in PIK3R 1 (the gene encoding the regulatory subunit p85) are also evident in GBM. With 
the current standard of care, few patients survive beyond a few years, highlighting the need for new 
therapeutic strategies. The PI3K pathway is activated in ≥  70% of GBM tumors, making it a 
compelling target for the treatment of GBM  (McLendon, Friedman et al. 2008 ). GDC -0084 is a potent, 
oral, selective small molecule inhibitor of class I PI3K and mTOR kinase that is being developed as an 
anti-cancer therapeutic agent specifically aimed at treating GBM.

progression -free survival (PFS), and shorter OS compared to those with methylated MGMT when 
treated with TMZ (Hegi, Diserens et al. 2005 , Stupp, Hegi et al. 2009 ).  
The randomized clinical trial EORTC (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer) 
[ZIP_CODE] -[ZIP_CODE]/NCIC CTG (National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group) CE.[ADDRESS_1080257] of care for GBM. It has long been  established, however, that GBM 
patients with a methylated MGMT promoter (epi[INVESTIGATOR_423406]) are most likely to benefit from 
the addition of TMZ as an adjuvant therapy following combined XRT/TMZ (Hegi, Diserens et al. 2005 , 
Stupp, Hegi et al. 2009 ). Patients with unmethylated  MGMT  promoter tumors derived only a 1 -month 
improvement in median survival, and absolute increases in 2 - and 5 -year survival of approximately 
13% and 8%, respectively (Hegi, Diserens et al. 2005 , Stupp, Hegi et al. 2009 ). The marginal benefit 
of combination therapy for the unmethylated population has brought into question the use of 
combination therapy as an absolute standard,  particularly in the clinical trial setting (Alexander and 
Cloughesy 2017 ). While the Stupp regimen  (Stupp, Mason et al. 2005 ) has been the standard of care 
in adjuvant and newly diagnosed GBM for over a decade, data have shown that OS in the two -thirds 
of patients who have unmethylated MGMT is only 12.7 months, and PFS is only 5.3 months  (Hegi, 
Diserens et al. 2005 ).  
Patients with unmethylated MGMT, therefore, represent the patient group with the highest unmet 
need requiring new treatment options; a role that GDC -0084 may fulfil given that its action is 
independent of the MGMT  promoter  status of GBM tumors.  
3.3 GDC -0084  
GDC -0084 is a potent, oral, selective, brain -penetrant small molecule inhibitor of PI3K/mTOR 
specifically designed to achieve blood brain barrier penetration with substantial free brain penetration 
for treatment of GBM. The PI3K pathway is activated in ≥  70% of GBM tumors, making it a compelling 
target for the treatment of GBM. mTOR is a key mediator of PI3K signaling.  
GDC -[ADDRESS_1080258], including 
growth inhibition of human glioma cell lines grown either in vitro  or as subcutaneous or intracranial 
grafts in nude mice. Mouse xenograft models demonstrate dose -dependent tumor -growth inhibition 
(TGI) for GD C-0084 with 60% - 90% TGI observed at exposures equivalent to those achieved in the 
clinic. Mechanism -of-action studies indicate that phosphorylation of downstream PI3K pathway 
markers such as Akt and S6 are decreased in glioma lines treated with GDC -[ADDRESS_1080259]. A correlation is seen between tissue concentrati ons of drug and status 
of pharmacodynamic markers in tumor xenografts. These in vitro  and in vivo  efficacy studies support 
the investigation of GDC -0084 as a single agent for the treatment of patients with GBM. In addition, 
GBM has been shown to be highly vascularized, and PI3K inhibitors demonstrate anti -angiogenic 
activity in nonclinical studies (Graupera, Guillermet -Guibert et al. 2008 ). 
3.4 Risk/Benefit Analysis  
GDC -0084 is a potent, oral, selective, brain -penetrant small molecule inhibitor of PI3K/mTOR being 
developed as an anti -cancer therapeutic agent. It has proven to be efficacious in nonclinical models of 
brain tumors driven by [CONTACT_785324]3K pathway. Nonclinical studies have demonstrated that 
GDC -0084 inhibits proliferation of a large numbe r of glioma cell lines in vitro  and inhibits tumor growth 
in intracranial and subcutaneous mouse xenograft models of human GBM. GDC -0084 has favorable 
pharmacokine tic (PK) properties characteristic of an orally administered compound that can achieve 
clinical exposure consistent with that obtained in nonclinical efficacy studies. The results of the 
nonclinical toxicology program for GDC -0084 supported the evaluation of GDC -0084 as a potential 
therapeutic agent for GBM.

CONFIDENTIAL  20 A phase 1 open -label, dose -escalation  study (Wen et al, J Clin Oncol 34, 2016; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), has 
been completed in [ADDRESS_1080260]-in-human , phase 1 dose -escalation  study of GDC -
0084 at doses between 2 and 65  mg once daily demonstrated a safety profile consistent with classic 
PI3K/mTOR -inhibitor related adverse events ( AEs) with the most frequent AEs attributed to GDC -
[ADDRESS_1080261] common Grade 3 AEs related to GDC -0084 being 
hyperglycemia (8.5%) and mucositis (6.4%).  Dose limiting toxicities  (DLTs) included 1 case of Grade 
2 bradycardia and Grade 3 myocardial ischemia (15 mg), Grade 3 stomatitis (45 mg), and 2 cases of 
Grade 3 mucosal inflammation (65 mg).  
 
The dose proposed for th e current study is based on the results of the previous phase 1  study ( Wen 
et al, J Clin Oncol 34, 2016; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), which defined the maximum tolerated daily dose (MTD) 
of GDC -0084 in patients with high grade gliomas (WHO Grade III –IV), who had progressed during or 
after trea tment with at least 1 prior XRT -containing regimen for gliomas and/or were not candidates 
for regimens known to provide clinical benefit. The MTD was determined to be 45 mg when GDC -
0084 was administered orally once daily ( QD) in cycles of 28 days in these patients.  
However, for newly diagnosed GBM patients a dose of 60 mg may be  more suitable. A higher clinical 
exposure is expected to be more effective, but still tolerable , in this healthier patient group ,  
Thus, the starting dose in this Phase 2a study is 60 mg given orally QD in 28 -day cycles.  
PK analysis in the phase  1 study confirmed GDC -0084 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_785301] -proportional increases in exposure, with a n elimination  half-life supportive of both once daily 
and intermittent dosing. In this population of patients, the AEs and other safety findings were 
generally consistent with the established PI3K/mTOR inhibitor class effects and/or with the disease 
under study. The MT D was determined to be [ADDRESS_1080262] are common in patients with GBM  (Parsons, Jones et al. 2008 ). GDC -0084 was 
designed to efficiently cross the blood -brain barrier with little efflux, providing greater drug exposure in 
the brain, thus maximizing its ability to target brain cancers such as GBM. A PI3K/mTOR inhibitor with 
significant brain penetration  such as GDC -0084 may provide increased clinical benefit to GBM 
patients over currently available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (which either are not brain penetrant or do not target a key 
signaling pathway). GDC -[ADDRESS_1080263] of cell division and apoptosis in vitro  and in vivo . 
Taken together with nonclinical toxicology find ings that were generally reversible and consistent with 
inhibition of the PI3K/mTOR pathway, these in vitro  and in vivo data support the daily and intermittent 
use of GDC -0084 as a single agent for the treatment of patients with GBM.  
GDC -0084 has been studied in a phase  1 clinical trial study ( Wen et al, J Clin Oncol 34, 2016; 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) an open -label, multicenter, dose -escalation  study evaluating the safety, tolerability, 
and PK of GDC -0084, administered orally, once daily, to 47 patients with progressive or recurrent 
high-grade gliomas. In this population of patients, the AEs and other safety findings were generally 
consistent with the established Class I phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI3K) and mammalian target of 
rapamycin (mTOR) kina se inhibitor class -effects and/or with the disease under study. GDC -0084 is

patients dosed at the dose of 45 mg having drug exposures consistent with anti -tumor activity in pre -
clinical models. Fluorodeoxyglucose -positron emission tomography ( FDG -PET) scans of tumor brain 
tissue and normal brain tissue suggest that GDC -0084 crosses the blood brain barrier, with a uniform 
distribution throughout the brain. The MTD was determined to be 45 mg when dosed once daily.  
The current phase 2 clinical development program will investigate  the efficacy and safety of 
GDC -0084 in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed GBM, with unmethylated MGMT

3.7 Study  Design  
This phase  2a study consists of an open -label, multicenter dose -escalation  study with expansion, 
designed to assess the safet y, tolerability, MTD , PK and clinical activity of GDC -0084  in patients with 
newly -diagnosed GBM (WHO Grade IV astrocytoma) with unmethylated MGMT promoter status .  
The MGMT promoter status must be confirmed by [CONTACT_785331] (PCR) or 
validated alternat ive genomic analysis. Eligible patients must have undergone surgical resection of 
the tumor(s) and initial treatment with XRT/TMZ (Stupp regimen ). 
The maximum overall duration of the study is estimated to  be 2 years.  This study will comprise 2 
stages, Stage 1  (dose -escalation ) and Stage 2  (dose expansion  and fed/fasted investigation )..  
Stage 1 ( dose -escalation ) will enroll approximately 12 patients (range: 6 - 24 patients; i.e. up to 6 
patients at 60 mg , at 75 mg,  at 90 mg,  at 105 mg ….) for determination of the QD MTD.  
Stage 2 (dose expansion) will enroll  20 patients , who will receive  GDC -0084 QD at the MTD 
established for QD dosing in Stage 1. Patients in Stage 2 will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either 
receive the drug under fasted conditions or under fed conditions.

CONFIDENTIAL  22 The total sample size for the study  is approximately 32 patients (range : 26 - 44 patients).  
3.7.1  Stage 1  
Dose -Escalation and Maximum Tolerated Dose  
GDC -0084 administration will occur in 28 -day cycles to investigate whether it is possible to increase 
the previously established MTD of 45 mg QD  relating to Phase 1 patients with progressive or recurrent 
high-grade gliomas.  Starting dose will be 60 mg QD, subsequently escalating in 15 mg increments until 
the MTD is reached. PK will be evaluated from the initial 60 mg dose level (Dose Level 0) onwards. If 
the QD MTD cannot be escalated above [ADDRESS_1080264] “3 + 3” design will be adopted. A minimum of 3 
patients will be enrolled, even if the MTD is confirmed as 45 mg.  During Cycle 1 ( Days 2 to Day 2 8) all 
doses are to be administered  at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after food to ensure the study medication 
is taken on an empty stomach.

Dose -Escalation  Rules  
Dose -escalation will occur in Stage 1:  
• The initial dose (Dose Level 0) for QD MTD determination in will be 60 mg. Dose levels will 
increase in 15 mg steps;  
• The dose -escalation portion of the study (Stage 1) will use a "3 + 3" design to assess the 
safety, tolerability, and PK of GDC 0084 administered orally in 28 -day cycles;  
• Each dose cohort will initially enroll 3 patients. If none of these patients experiences a DLT 
within the DLT assessment period (Day 1 - 28), escalation will proceed to the next higher 
dose level by [CONTACT_785332] r dose cohort  with newly recruited patients;  
• If 1 patient experiences a DLT, the cohort will be expanded until a second patient experiences 
a DLT or to a maximum of 6 patients. When a second patient has a DLT, the MTD is 
determined as 1 dose level below the current dose level; i.e. the highest dose l evel at which 
less than 1/3 of patients (e.g. 1 of 6) experiences a DLT will be declared the MTD.  
• If 2 or more patients experience a DLT at Dose Level 0, the MTD will be declared at 45 mg, 
which was the MTD established in the previous phase I study in patients with advanced 
glioma with a QD dosing schedule.  
On the basis of the review of real -time safety data and available preliminary PK data from this study 
with GDC -0084, dose -escalation  may be halted or modified by [CONTACT_785333].  
Decisions regarding dose -escalation and selection will be made by a CRC including the medical 
monitor, recruiting Investigators, sponsor representative and any other relevant and necessary expert 
on as needs basis, according to the CRC charter.  
Definition of Dose Limiting Toxicity  
All AEs, including DLTs, will be reported, with severity assessed according to National Cancer 
Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE), version 4.03. In case a 
patient experiences one of the below, study participation will be terminated for this patient and the 
EoT visit should be performed.  
For dose -escalation purposes, DLT assessments will be performed by [CONTACT_785334].  
A DLT is defined as any one of the following toxicities occurring within the DLT ass essment window 
(Cycle 1, Days 1  - 28) and assessed by [CONTACT_785335] -0084:  
• Grade ≥ 3 non -hematologic or non -hepatic toxicity that is not related to hyperglycemia or 
hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_785295]/stomatitis and is not due to disease progression or another clearly 
identifiable cause, excluding the following:  
o Alopecia of any grade;  
o Grade 3 fever or Grade 4 fever < 5 days duration;  
o Grade 3 infection < 5 days duration or that responds to treatment;  
o Grade 3 weight gain or loss; 
o Grade [ADDRESS_1080265] -of-care 
therapy including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  
o Grade [ADDRESS_1080266] -of-care therapy;  
o Grade 3 or asymptomatic Grade 4 electrolyte imbalance that resolves or improves 
within 7 days with or without medical intervention, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  
o Grade 3 or 4 serum amylase or lipase or creatine phosphokinase laboratory 
abnormality that is asymptomatic (without other laboratory evidence suggestive of 
pancreatitis, rhabdomyolysis, or other major organ dysfunction) and returns to 
baseline within 7 da ys of interrupting study drug;

CONFIDENTIAL  25 o Grade ≥ 3 total bilirubin or hepatic transaminase ( aspartate aminotransferase [AST] 
and alanine aminotransferase [ALT] ) elevations that return to ≤ Grade 1 (if normal at 
study entry) or ≤ baseline values within 7 days of interrupting study drug;  
o Note: Allergic reactions that necessitate discontinuation of study drug will not be 
considered a DLT; 
• Grade ≥ 3 symptomatic fasting hyperglycemia (e.g., dehydration or acidosis requiring 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) ; 
• Grade ≥ 4 fasting hypercholesterolemia or triglyceridemia for ≥ 14 days despi[INVESTIGATOR_785303] a lipid -lowering agent ; 
• Grade ≥ 4 thrombocytopenia ; 
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia that lasts ≥ 7 days or is associated with clinically significant 
bleeding;  
• Grade ≥ 4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 500/μL) lasting ≥ 7 days or accompanied 
by [CONTACT_411] (oral or tympanic temperature ≥ 38.0°C [100°F]) ; 
• Grade ≥ 3 total bilirubin or hepatic transaminase (ALT or AST) elevations that do not return to 
≤ Grade 1 (if normal at study entry) or ≤ baseline values within 7 days of interrupting study 
drug;  
• For patients with Gilbert’s disease and with Grade 2 bilirubin at baseline, total bilirubin ≥ 10 x 
upper limit of normal (ULN) will be considered a DLT;  
• Bradycardia Grade ≥ 2;  
• Myocardial ischemia Grade ≥ 2;  
• Mucositis/stomatitis Grade [ADDRESS_1080267] -of-care therapy or Grade 4 .   Sites 
should consider using an alcohol -free dexamethasone 0.5 mg per 5mL oral solution (elixir) if 
such symptoms eventuate.   Patients may be instructed to use 10ml oral solution swished for 
up to two minutes and then spit, up to four times daily (Rugo et al. 2017).  
• Decrease  in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to ≤ 45%;  
• Increase of QTc to ≥ 500 msec or by 60 msec;  
• Pneumonitis Grade ≥ 2.  
After determination of the MTD, patients continue to receive their protocol assigned dose levels of  
GDC -[ADDRESS_1080268].  
Patients who experience disease progression or an unacceptable toxicity at any time during the study, 
or, in their opi[INVESTIGATOR_785297], are not benefiting from GDC -0084, will be 
discontinued from study treatment. Under certain circum stances in which an AE (or DLT) is reversible 
and the risk/benefit assessment suggests a reasonable rationale for continued  administration of  study 
drug, patients may continue with agreement  from the Investigator and the medical monitor. This may 
include d ose reduction and change of treatment schedule. An End of Treatment visit will be performed 
approximately [ADDRESS_1080269] of food  on the PK of GDC -0084 , as well as to provide a preliminary assessment of 
single -agent activity of GDC -0084 in patients with GBM .  
The expansion will start with a screening period, followed by [CONTACT_785336] -up periods. It will be 
initiated with recruitment of new patients as soon as the MTD for QD dosing has been determined.  
Approximately 20 patients will be e nrolled in the expansion cohort  according to the defined study 
eligibility criteria, to perform the comparison of safety and clinical activity. On Day s 1 and C2D1 , 10 
patients will receive GDC -0084 in a fed state, while the remaining 10 patients will receive GDC -0084  
in a fasted state.  Patients will be allocated to either fed or fasted arms via a central randomization 
mechanism.  
Patients enrolled in Stage 2 may continue the study at the dose allocated until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity.

CONFIDENTIAL  34 condition s that might exclude the patient  from eligibility or could interfere with the patient ’s 
participation and compliance with the protocol should be performed at Screening.  
The ophthalmologic examination  should include use of a slit -lamp or similar equipment to assess 
corneal opacity.   
4.6.2  Height, Weight and Vital Signs  
Body height (at screening only), weight, and vital signs (blood pressure, pulse and temperature) will 
be measured.  
4.6.3  Radiographic Assessment s  
For all patients, an MRI of the brain  will be performed ; cranial MRI scan must have been performed 
within 14 days prior to or on the day of the Enrollment /Week 1 visit  and then every 8 weeks starting at 
Week 8. The international standardized brain tumor imaging protocol will be followed for MRI imaging. 
Minimum sequences required are: 3D pre -contrast T1, T2/FLAIR, and 3D post -contrast T1. Slice 
thickness for 3D pre - and post -contrast T1 images should be ≤ 1.5 mm with no gap and slice 
thickness for 2D T2 and FLAIR should be ≤ 4 mm with no interslice gap.   
For the expansion cohort , the a ssessment of disease progression will be done by [CONTACT_66243] I analysis 
according to RANO criteria . Evaluation  will be conducted by a cen tral radiography vendor using 
2 central readers  who are blind to treatment assignment  (fed or fasted) , with an adjudication process 
when ther e is disagreement between the [ADDRESS_1080294] 
facilities .  
FDG -PET imaging will occur at Randomization/Week 1, Days 3 and 7 of Cycle 1. Timing and days of 
FDG -PET imaging may change on the basis of PK  e.g. T max and other  data analyzed during the study.  
FDG -PET imaging may be obtained using a stand -alone PET or combined PET/ computed 
tomography (CT) scanner, or hybrid PET/MRI systems.  
The image acquisition system must remain consistent throughout all scans for the same patient. MRI 
imaging will be performed according to standardized procedures. The central review disease 
response assessments will be used as the primary measure for analysis, and the Investigator disease 
response assessments will be used as supportive measures for analysis.  
At the Randomization/Week [ADDRESS_1080295] 1 hour prior to pre-dose  PK sampling . For logistical reasons, the pre -treatment FDG -PET may 
be performed up to 1 day prior to the Randomization/Week [ADDRESS_1080296] 4  hours  (preferably 6 
hours) . The blood glucose level should be determined at the time of the FDG -PET scan. Use of 
anti-hyperglycemic medications, including insulin, immediately prior to the FDG -PET scan is not 
permitted, as these agents will impact FDG uptake and compromise the interpretability of the 
FDG -PET scan. Specifically, no short -acting insulin should be administered within [ADDRESS_1080297] enhancing, measurable target 
lesion(s), contralateral normal -appearing cortical tissue, and contralateral normal -appearing white 
matter will be quantified.  
4.6.4  Cardiac Assessment  
Cardiac assessment will be performed by [CONTACT_785340], physical examination, 12 -lead ECG results  (including QTc)  and evaluation of LVEF by 
[CONTACT_51541] ( ECHO ) or multi -gated scan ( MUGA ) as well as, as clinically indicated,

• AST/ALT ≤ 2.[ADDRESS_1080305] treatment delayed until the recovery of organ 
function. Patient s who cannot be retreated within 2 weeks of the end of the previous cycle should be 
removed from study.   
4.9.2  Dose Modification Guidelines  
In general, dose modifications are not foreseen during the study. However, under certain 
circumstances in which the risk/benefit assessment suggests a reasonable rationale for continued 
treatment with GDC -0084, e.g., after an AE (or DLT), patients may continue with a reduced dose or a 
change of treatment schedule i f the Investigator  and medical monitor agree.  
Patients in Stage 1 will be enrolled to their allocated dose at a QD dosing frequency. They will continue 
to receive study drug based on the cohort to which they are assigned, and intra -patient dose escalation 
is not permitted. Dose reduction is permitted if clinically indicated.  
 
4.10 Supportive Care Guidelines  
Participants will follow their oncology care plan. All medications required as part of a participant’s 
normal clinical care for support of their medical conditions are permitted during the study, except for  
prohibited medications listed below. All concomitant medications must be recorded in the source 
documentation and in the CRFs for the duration of patient participation.  
The following medications/treatments are prohibited during the study:  
• Another  investigational drug;  
• Strong Cytochrome P450 subtype 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) inhibitors (such as but not limited to, 
atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir,

Based on nonclinical toxicology findings for GDC -0084, known toxicities associated with PI3K and 
mTOR inhibitors (including rapamycin analogues) in the clinic, and clinical safety data from study 
G028070, the guidelines for monitoring and management of spe cific toxicities detailed below should

to hyperglycemia. Cases of hyperglycemia, including Grade [ADDRESS_1080307] been observed in the 
GDC -0084 single -agent study GO28070. Glucose levels at baseline and during study should be 
carefully monitored, and appropriate d ose delays/dose modifications for managing hyperglycemia 
should be implemented per protocol guidelines. Patients should be instructed to report symptoms 
associated with hyperglycemia such as thirst, frequent urination, and blurred vision. Use of oral 
anti-hyperglycemic agents, such as metformin, for patients experiencing Grade  [ADDRESS_1080308] been observed in the GDC -0084

guidelines. Use of lipid -lowering therapy for patients experiencing Grade  [ADDRESS_1080309] of care and protocol guidelines .  
4.10.2  Potential Lung Inflammation/Pneumonitis  
Lung inflammation was not observed in any of the rat studies and was not observed in the 29 -day dog 
study. Evidence of lung inflammation was observed in the 8 -day dog pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. However, this finding 
was observed only at doses exceeding the MTD in this s pecies. Interstitial lung inflammation/non -
infectious pneumonitis has been observed in cancer patients receiving other PI3K and mTOR 
inhibitors. Patients should be monitored carefully for changes in pulmonary status (including physical 
examinations, pulse oximetry, and periodic CT scans) during treatment with GDC -0084. Patients 
experiencing symptomatic or asymptomatic pneumonitis should be treated per standard of care and 
protocol guidelines adapted from recommendations by  (White, Camus et al. 2010 ) for the 
management of pneumonitis in cancer patients receiving everolimus. Use of corticosteroids should be 
considered for symptomatic cases of non -infectious pneumonitis. Appropriate dosing adjustment 
should be performed per protocol guidelines.  
4.10.[ADDRESS_1080310] been associated with 
GI effects including  stomatitis/oral mucositis , nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and colitis. Although rare, 
cases of fatal bowel perforation have been reported in patients who received temsirolimus. Nausea, 
vomiting, and diarrhea have been reported in patients receiving single -agent GDC -0084 in Study 
GO2807 0. Grade 3  mucosal inflammation was also reported for  a patient dosed with 45  mg 
GDC -0084 and two patients dosed with 65 mg GDC -0084 in Study GO28070. GI effects should be 
closely monitored by [CONTACT_785343]. Development of 
stomatitis/oral mucositis, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and clinica lly significant changes in stool 
(e.g., diarrhea, bloody stools) may necessitate more frequent monitoring, and study drug may be held 
if symptoms are prohibitive for normal function . 
Gastrointestinal  toxicities will be managed according to institutional standard -of-care and protocol 
guidelines. During the study, patients are to receive maximum supportive care as clinically indicated. 
Maximum supportive care for nausea and vomiting may include standard -of-care symptom 
management. Maximum supportive care for diarrhea should include stan dard-of-care treatment with 
anti-motility therapy and dietary adjustments. Additionally, supplemental intravenous fluids are

addition, sites should consider using an alcohol -free dexamethasone 0.5 mg per 5mL oral solution 
(elixir) if such symptoms eventuate.  Patients may be instructed to use 10ml oral solution swished for 
up to two minutes and then spit, up to four times daily (Rugo et a l. 2017).   
 
4.10.4  Potential Skin Disorder  
Treatment -related rash has been commonly reported in cancer patients receiving other PI3K and 
mTOR inhibitors in clinical studies. This rash is commonly manifested as maculo -papular with or 
without pruritus. Rash and other dermatologic events should be clo sely monitored,  and patients 
should apply Sun Protection Factor  50+ sunscreen if exposed to direct sunlight for longer than [ADDRESS_1080311] received prior TMZ, a 
therapy that frequently causes lymphopenia. Such  patients will be able to enroll in the trial and will be 
monitored closely  for opportunistic infections. Prophylactic antibiotics such as 
sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim are encouraged  when the absolute  lymphocyte count is   500/μL. The 
decision to initiate prophylactic antibiotics should be discu ssed with the  medical monitor.  
4.10.[ADDRESS_1080312] dosed at 30  mg GDC -0084 had a QTcF value marginally greater than 450  msec at 24  h 
after dosing, and five subjects had QTcF increases  of > [ADDRESS_1080313] one 
occasion, but no QTcF increases >  60 msec were recorded.  
Analysis of the relationship between GDC -0084 plasma concentrations and QTcF showed a slight 
positive trend for absolute QTcF and QTcF change from baseline. Based on this limited sample size, 
GDC -0084 has the potential to prolong the QTc interval. Patients  with QT c interval >  470 msec will be 
excluded from this study and a specific, detailed QT and overall cardiac risk mitigation plan will be 
observed for phase 2.  
Patients with significant cardiac history (e.g., myocardial infarction or symptomatic bradycardia, active 
congestive heart failure, and angina pectoris) should be excluded from study participation. During the 
study, patients should be instructed to contact  [CONTACT_785344], 
light-headedness, fainting, sensations of heart palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], or slow or irregular pulse. 
Electrocardiograms should be closely monitored. Cardiac enzymes may be measured if deemed 
necessary.

CONFIDENTIAL  40 drops out of the study or is withdrawn from the study, the withdrawal form in the patient’s CRF should 
be completed and all study drug supplies should be retrieved. On the withdrawal page the Investigator  
should record the date of the withdrawal, the person who initiated withdrawal and the reason for 
withdrawal.  
Reasonable effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_785345]/supplies.  
The following are reasons for patient withdrawal:  
Withdrawn by [CONTACT_785346]:  
• AE; 
• Protocol deviation (e.g. dosing regimen, failure to comply with clinic visit schedule);  
• Administration of an excluded medication;  
• Co-existing disease;  
• Worsening of condition;  
• Pregnancy;  
• Clinically significant abnormal laboratory value(s).  
The patient requested withdrawal due to:  
• An AE for which the Investigator  did not consider removal from the study necessary;  
• Perceived insufficient therapeutic effect;  
• Co-existing disease;  
• Withdrawal of consent.  
Other reasons for withdrawal may include:  
• Patient died;  
• Kazia Therapeutics  Limited/CRO request the patient to be withdrawn;  
• Lost to follow -up; 
• Administrative problems.  
Withdrawals will only be replaced in the dose finding/MTD portion  (Stage 1) of the phase  2a study to 
ensure that a full cohort is available at the time of CRC review.  
4.11.2  Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
Toxicities will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.0 3. If a patient experiences one of the 
below, study participation will be terminated for this patient and the EoT visit should be performed.  
For dose -escalation purposes, DLT assessments will be performed by [CONTACT_785347] s during CRC meetings. A DLT is defined as any one of the 
following toxicities occurring within the DLT assessment window (Cycle 1, Days 1  − 28) and assessed 
by [CONTACT_785348] -0084.  
Details on DLTs are given in Section  3.7.1 . 
4.11.3  Premature Discontinuation of Study in a Study Site  
Kazia Therapeutics  Limited reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time. The reasons will 
be discussed with the Investigator . A study site may also be discontinued by [CONTACT_785349].  
Kazia Therapeutics  Limited may terminate this study at 1 particular or several study sites for 1 of the 
following reasons:  
• Non-compliance with Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) and/or regulatory requirements;  
• Site cannot recruit an adequate number of patients;  
• False documentation in the CRF due to carelessness or deliberately;

CONFIDENTIAL  41 • Inadequate co -operation with Kazia Therapeutics  Limited or its representatives;  
• The Investigator  requests closure of his/her study site.  
If the study is prematurely terminated at [ADDRESS_1080314] will be reported as described in the following sections. All AEs will 
be collected in response to a general question about the patient ’s well -being and any possible 
changes from the baseline or previous visit, but shall not be specifically solicited with respect to 
particular AEs.  
For all AEs, the Investigator  must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine the 
outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE requiring 
immediate notification to Kazia Therapeutics  Limited  or its designated representative . For all AEs, 
sufficient information should be obtained by [CONTACT_785350] . The 
Investigator  is required to assess causality . AEs will be followed until resolved, stable, or until the 
patient ’s last study visit or is lost to follow -up. If an AE is not resolved or stabilized at the patient ’s last 
visit, it is up to the discretion of the Investigator  and Kazia Therapeutics  Limited’s  medical monitor to 
determine if further monitoring of the event is warranted.  
As part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by [CONTACT_785351] , any non -serious AE that 
is determined by [CONTACT_785352] . 
To assist in the determination of case seriousness, further information may be requested from the 
Investigator  to provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical study .  
5.2 Reporting Period  
For AEs, the active reporting period to Kazia Therapeutics  Limited  or its designated representative 
begins from the time that the patient  provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the 
patient ’s participation in the study, i.e., prior to undergoing any study -related procedure and/or

Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under study should be reported as AEs in the 
appropriate section of the CRF . Disease progression and death will be reported as part of the study

treatment, or other therapy ; and/or  
• Test result considered to be an AE by [CONTACT_395584] ; 
• Merely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE . Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require

expected pattern of progression will be based on the RANO criteria. In rare cases, the determination 
of clinical progression will be based on symptomatic deterioration. However, every effort should be 
made to document progression using objective criteria. If there is any uncertainty as to whether an 
event is due to disease progression, it should be reported as an AE.  
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important medical 
event . An important medical event may not be immediately life -threatening and/or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize the patient  or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the important medical event should be reported 
as serious.  
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse.

the criteria outlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases 
of drug -induced liver injury (potential Hy’s Law ca ses) and should always be considered important 
medical events .  
The threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential case of drug -induced liver injury depends on 
the patient ’s individual baseline values and underlying conditions. Patient s who present with the 
following laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated further to definitively determine the etiology of 
the abnormal laboratory values:  
• Patient s with AST or ALT and total bilirubin  baseline values within the normal range who 
subsequently present with AST or ALT  [ADDRESS_1080321] concurrent with a total bilirubin  [ADDRESS_1080322] 
with no evidence of hemolysis and an alkaline phosphatase  [ADDRESS_1080323] or not available;  
• For patient s with preexisting ALT OR AST OR total bilirubin values above the upper limit of 
normal, the following threshold values should be used in the definition mentioned above:  
• For patient s with pre -existing AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range:  AST or 
ALT  2 x the baseline values and  [ADDRESS_1080324], or  [ADDRESS_1080325] (whichever is smaller ); 
• For patient s with pre -existing values of total bilirubin above the normal range: Total bilirubin 
increased by [CONTACT_785353] ≥ 3 x the lower limit of normal (whichever is smaller).  
If able to do so, t he patient  should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as 
possible, preferably within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results . This evaluation should 
include laboratory tests, detailed history and physical assessment . For oncology studies, the 
possibility of hepatic neoplasia (primary or secondary) should be considered . In addition to repeating 
AST and ALT, laboratory tests should include albumin, creatine kinase, total bilirubin, direct and 
indirect bilirub in, GGT , PT/INR, and alkaline phosphatase . A detailed history, including relevant 
information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen , recreational drug and supplement 
consumption, family history, occupational exposure, sexual history, travel history, history of contact 
[CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced patient , surgery, blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and work 
exposure, should be collected . Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging 
(e.g., biliary tract) may be war ranted. All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory 
criteria defined above, with no other cause for liver function test ( LFT) abnormalities identified at the 
time should be considered potential Hy’s Law cases irrespective of availability of all the results of the 
investigations performed to determine etiology of the abnormal LFTs . Such potential Hy’s Law cases 
should be reported as SAEs.

CONFIDENTIAL  45 5.8 Causality Assessment  
The Investigator ’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and non -serious); 
the Investigator  must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, and report such an 
assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements if applicable .  
The causality assessment categorization will be :  
• Unrelated: If there is no relationship and/or other factors (medicinal products or underlying 
disease) prove an explanation. Clearly due to extraneous causes ; 
• Unlikely related: If the event occurs within an improbable temporal relationship, and/or in 
which other factors provi de a more plausible explanation;  
• Possibly related: If the event occurs within a reasonable time sequence, but can also be 
explained by [CONTACT_388669], medicinal products, or chemicals and investigational 
product causality is one of other causes f or the described clinical event;  
• Probably related: If the event occurs within a reasonable time sequence, was unlikely to be 
attributed to other factors (concurrent dis ease, medicinal products);  
• Related: If the event occurs within a reasonable time sequence and could cannot be 
attributed to other factors (e.g., concurrent disease, chemicals, confounding drug 
administration must be absent . 
An Investigator ’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable 
possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE; generally,  the facts 
(evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided . If the Investigator  does 
not know whether  the investigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as 
“related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as defined by [CONTACT_456]  (see 
Section  5.12). 
If the Investigator 's causality  assessment is "unknown but un related to investigational product", this 
should be clearly  documented on study records. In addition, if the Investigator  determines an SAE is 
associated with study procedures, the Investigator  must record this causal relationship in the source 
documents and CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE 
reporting requirements, if applicable.  
5.9 Exposure During Pregnancy  
Patient s who become pregnant during the study period (up to [ADDRESS_1080327] dose) must not receive additional doses of investigational product and should 
be withdrawn from the study.   
Patient s should be instructed to notify the Investigator  if it is determined after completion of the study 
that they became pregnant either during the study or within one month (minimum 28 days) after 
receiving the last investigational product dose.  
If a pregnancy occurs within 28 days of dosing, the pregnancy should be followed to term, any 
premature terminations reported, and the health status of the mother and child including date of 
delivery and the child’s gender and weight should be reported to Kazia Therapeutics  Limited after 
delivery. The mother may freely choose to terminate the pregnancy as her own decision. Neither the 
sponsor  nor Investigator s should influence this decision in any way. Similarly, neither the Investigator s 
nor sponsor  have t he right to intervene or influence this decision and any ensuing procedures. If this 
occurs, the termination of pregnancy should be considered an elective surgical procedure and any 
associated AEs attributed accordingly.  
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (i .e., ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous 
abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a live born, a terminated 
fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the Investigator  should follow the procedures 
for reporting SAEs.  
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows:  
• Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;

CONFIDENTIAL  46 • Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_1080328] be made immediately to Kazia 
Therapeutics  Limited , or its delegated representative, irrespective of the extent of available AE 
information . This timeframe also applies to additional new information (follow -up) on previously 
forwarded SAE reports as well as to the initial and follow -up reporting of exposure during pregnancy 
and exposure via breastfeeding cases .  
In the rare event that the Investigator  does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE 
immediately (e .g., if an outpatient study patient  initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the Investigator  is 
to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness 
of the AE.  
For all SAEs, the Investigator  is obligated to pursue and provide information to Kazia Therapeutics  
Limited  in accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above . In addition, an Investigator  
may be requested by [CONTACT_785354] -up information in 
an expedited fashion . This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured on the 
AE CRF  and must be provided on an additional CRF for collection of detailed SAE information. Where 
the same  data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. For example, the 
same AE term should be used in all occasions this AE is referenced. AEs should be reported using 
concise medical terminology. In general, information to be provided  will include a description of the 
AE in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent 
determination of possible causality . Information on other possible causes of the event, such as 
concomitant medications and illn esses must be provided . In the case of a patient’s  death, a summary 
of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Kazia Therapeutics  Limited  or 
its designated representative.  
Information should be forwarded to the CRO’s Pharmacovigilance group via the following e -mail 
address:  
[EMAIL_11830]  
The IRB must be informed if the SAE, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_785309] , 
is likely to affect the safety of the patients or the conduct of the study.

6.1 Source Data  
Source documents (including all demographic and medical information, CRFs, and a copy of the 
signed ICF indicating the study number and title) for each patient in the study will be maintained by 
[CONTACT_737]  (generally in the patient’s files), and all information in the CRFs must be traceable to 
the source documents.  
All data should be recorded directly into the patient’s medical record as source data. It will be 
confirmed at the study initiation monitoring visit which documents will be considered as source data 
for each site. These will be documented and reviewed by t he monitor at each monitoring visit.  
Source documents must be available to document the existence of the patient and substantiate the 
integrity of study data collected.  
6.2 Data Collection, Management and Reporting  
Procedures for data management (i.e., entry, storage, etc.) are outlined in the  study’s  Data 
Management Plan.  
6.2.1  Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record  
As used in this protocol, the term  CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or an 
electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study.  
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included patient . The completed original CRFs 
are the sole property of Kazia Therapeutics  Limited and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of Kazia Therapeutics  Limited or appropriate 
regulatory authorities, without written permission from Kazia Therapeutics  Limited.  
The Investigator  has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical, safety and 
laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source documents) and 
ensuring that they are accurate, authentic / original, attributable, co mplete, consistent, legible, timely 
(contemporaneous), enduring and available when required . The CRFs must be signed by [CONTACT_785355] . 
Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source documents must be dated, initialed and 
explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the original entry. Data transcribed on the CRF, 
which are derived from source documents, should be consistent with the source documents or the 
discrepancies should be explained.  
In most cases, the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]'s or the physician's patient chart . In these 
cases, data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts.  
In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may also serve as source documents . In these cases, a 
document should be available at the Investigator ’s site as well as at Kazia Therapeutics  Limited  and 
clearly identify those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the 
source document.  
6.2.[ADDRESS_1080329] Retention

6.3 Statistical Methods  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared as a separate document and will include a more 
technical and detailed description (including the handling of missing data, transformations and other 
data handling procedures as well as templates for Tables, Listings, and Figures) of the planned 
statistical summaries. The SAP is a higher level document that the relevant statistical -related text 
following.  The SAP will be finalized before initiating any statistical analysis. Tabulation of summary 
statistics and data analysis will be performed using SAS®. 
6.3.1  Analysis Populations  
The following analysis populations are defined:  
• The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population includes all randomized patients; ITT analyses will be 
conducted on the basis of the arm assigned at randomization  
• The Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) population  includes all l eligible patients who received at 
least [ADDRESS_1080331] -baseline tumor response data; mITT 
analyses will be conducted on the bas is of the treatment assigned at  randomization;  
• Safety population (SAF): All eligible patients who received at least 1 dose of GDC 0084 will be 
included in the safety population. Safety analyses will be conducted on the basis of initial 
received treatment;  
• PK population: All eligible patients in the safety population who have an adequate concentration 
vs. time profile to determine PK parameters  
• A Per -Protocol (PP) subset will also be used to analyze endpoints of clinical benefit and will be 
based on study drug exposure (compliance and/or time on study drug) and major protocol 
deviations. The criteria for inclusion in the PP subset will be finaliz ed and documented prior to 
database lock.  
 
6.3.2  Timing of Analyses  
Regular cohort safety reviews will be performed as described above  during Stage 1 to support 
dose -escalation and if necessary, de -escalation decisions.  
 
A final analysis will be performed when all patients discontinue treatment and complete their EoT visit. 
Supplemental analyses may be performed at the completion of the study  but will be considered 
exploratory . 
6.3.3  General Considerations  
Data from Stage 1 and Stage 2 may be summarized separately. For Stage 1 assessment, summaries 
will be presented by [CONTACT_120741]. For Stage 2, summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_54012] (fed versus fasting) and overall. Selected safety parameters may be summarized using pooled

CONFIDENTIAL  49 There may be a statistical comparison of C max/AUC between fasted and fed patient data in Stage 2.  
Descriptive statistics (N, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) will be 
presented for continuous variables. Geometric means and geometric coefficient of variation will also 
be presented for PK data. Frequency distributions (counts and as sociated percentages) will be 
presented for categorical variables. Median, 25th and 75th percentiles and confidence intervals (CIs) 
will be presented for time -to-event data. Unless specified otherwise, CIs will be presented as 95% 
CIs. 
The study is descriptive in nature and  is not powered for a confirmatory statistical goal or objective. 
However, comparisons of treatment arms may be performed in Stage 2. Formal hypothesis testing will 
not be done, and no adjustment for multiple comparisons will be used.  
Individual patient data listings will be provided to support summary tables.  
The effects of noncompliance, treatment discontinuations, premature study withdrawals, subsequent 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and covariates will be assessed to determine the impact on the general applicability of 
results from this study.

PFS is defined as the time in months from start date  and/or date of disease diagnosis  until disease 
progression or death due to any cause . Patients without disease progression or death will be 
censored at the last evaluable radiographic assessment. Patients with no post -dose radiographic 
assessment will be censored at their start date (Day 1). The primary analysis of PFS will be 
conducted in the SAF fo r Stage 1 and the mITT for Stage  2. Analyses of PFS may be repeated in the 
PP. 
The Kaplan -Meier method will be used to describe and present PFS. Median PFS will be presented 
with 95% CI, 25th and 75th percentiles and minimum and maximum values. Kaplan -Meier estimates of 
PFS at 6, 9, and 12 months will also be presented with 95% CIs. PFS will also be displayed 
graphically using Kaplan -Meier estimates.  
For Stage 2, differences between treatment arms will be tested using a two -sided log rank test . 
Stratified h azard ratio (HR) estimates of the treatment comparisons with associated 95% CIs will be 
estimated from a Cox regression model.    
OS is defined as the time in months from start date and/or disease diagnosis until death due to any 
cause. Patients who are alive at the time of analysis will be censored at the date last known to be 
alive. The primary analysis of PFS will be conducted in the SAF for Stage 1 and the ITT for Stage 2. 
Analyses of  OS may be repeated in the mITT and/or PP.  
TTP is defined as the time in months from start date  and/or until disease progression . Patients 
without disease progression will be censored at the last evaluable radiographic assessment. Patients 
with no post -dose radiographic assessment will be censored at the ir start date (Day 1 ). 
Analyses of OS and TTP will be performed using the same methods as described for PFS.  
Post-hoc stratification/analysis factors may include disease progression (post -surgery at time of 
baseline visit) and baseline KPS.

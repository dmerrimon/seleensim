1  FINAL PROTOCOL AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_212776] (SPI[INVESTIGATOR_212777]) – Randomized Clinical Trial   [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  10-01-2021  
2 FINAL PROTOCOL (10-01-2021) FINAL PROTOCOL 1. Synopsis Low back and neck pain are among the leading causes of medical visits, lost productivity and disability. There is an urgent need to identify effective and efficient ways of helpi[INVESTIGATOR_212778]-value care.  This trial will be a block and cluster-randomized open-label multi-centered pragmatic randomized clinical trial comparing healthcare spending and clinical outcomes for subjects with spi[INVESTIGATOR_212779]’ duration, in whom there are no red flag signs or symptoms.  Subjects will be randomized to one of three treatment strategies: (1) usual primary care provider-led care; (2) usual PCP-led care with spi[INVESTIGATOR_212780], Coordinate, and Enhance decision making (ICE) care model, and (3) usual PCP-led care with spi[INVESTIGATOR_212781] (IPT) care model.  Our outcomes of interest will be spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-related healthcare utilization at one year as well as pain and functionality of the study participants.   2. Background Direct healthcare spending on neck and back pain (spi[INVESTIGATOR_185775]) exceeds $86 billion annually in the [LOCATION_002]. While up to 80% of adults will experience clinically significant spi[INVESTIGATOR_212782], only a minority will progress to chronic pain with resultant high health care utilization (1–9).  For the vast majority of subjects, spi[INVESTIGATOR_212783]-limited (10–12).  As a result, there is little evidence that the large amounts currently spent on spi[INVESTIGATOR_212784].  
3 FINAL PROTOCOL (10-01-2021) Many clinical guidelines exist for the treatment of spi[INVESTIGATOR_185775], but much of the evidence supporting specific treatment modalities addresses subjects with chronic back pain rather than individuals presenting with more acute or subacute complaints (13).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_212785], research in this area has shown mixed results and has led to a non-uniform clinical approach to treating spi[INVESTIGATOR_212786] (14–16).  Many patients with low back pain begin to incur substantial resource use and associated expenses soon after their first epi[INVESTIGATOR_212787] (14). For example, there is mounting clinical evidence that imaging offers little help for the initial care of a subject with nonspecific spi[INVESTIGATOR_185775] (17,18), but despi[INVESTIGATOR_212788], nearly 15% of clinicians admit it would be difficult to not order advanced imaging when subjects present for care (15). Currently there is also widespread use of non-traditional modalities of care, such as comprehensive and alternative medicine (CAM).  A recent study suggested that 30% of subjects are using CAM, and 42% of those subjects did not disclose this to their primary care physician (19).  A particularly promising strategy appears to be exercise or postural therapy, which is defined as “a series of specific movements with the aim of training or developi[INVESTIGATOR_212789] a routine practice to promote good physical health (20–23).”  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], there are substantial inconsistencies in the literature and many of the existing studies have been of low-quality (20).  Given the discordance between number of subjects using these techniques and the amount of reliable data by [CONTACT_212836], it is necessary to perform a rigorous evaluation. 
4 FINAL PROTOCOL (10-01-2021) One strategy for enhancing the efficiency of spi[INVESTIGATOR_212790] a high probability of progressing from acute to chronic pain.  For example, the STarT Back tool uses a biopsychosocial framework to identify features of a subject that helps to predict the likelihood of developi[INVESTIGATOR_23181], which can then direct treatments to improve pain and functioning (24).  Applying this risk stratification method to subjects with low back pain (24,25) and guiding treatment based upon it has been shown to improve clinical outcomes and reduce health spending (26).  However, the majority of subjects included in the studies evaluating the STarT Back tool had been experiencing back pain for more than three months and thus, further research is needed to risk stratify subjects earlier in the course of their illness to prevent the transition of acute pain into chronic pain.  These strategies must also be well-received by [CONTACT_39487], as acceptance of these new treatment pathways has been limited (27). The SPI[INVESTIGATOR_212791]: Individualized Postural Therapy (IPT) and the Identify, Coordinate, and Enhance decision making (ICE) Care Model developed by [CONTACT_212837] (CERC) at Stanford University.  These two models of care represent novel approaches to the comprehensive treatment of subjects with spi[INVESTIGATOR_212792].  3. Objectives and Overall Design This block and cluster-randomized, open-label, multi-centered three-arm pragmatic randomized clinical trial seeks to compare healthcare spending, pain, physical functioning, and 
5 FINAL PROTOCOL (10-01-2021) quality of life for subjects with acute and subacute spi[INVESTIGATOR_212793]: (1) usual primary care provider (PCP)-led care; (2) usual PCP-led care with spi[INVESTIGATOR_212794], and (3) usual PCP-led care with spi[INVESTIGATOR_212795]. ICE and IPT will both be integrated with typi[INVESTIGATOR_212796], if effective, could easily be incorporated into existing models of care.  We hypothesize that the ICE and IPT models of care will decrease spi[INVESTIGATOR_212797].   4. Study Setting This trial will be conducted in primary care clinics in geographically distinct areas in the U.S. with the following characteristics: 1. Provide primary care to adult subjects with acute back and neck pain. 2. Offer same day or next day appointments. 3. Do not have an existing specialized program for back or neck pain subjects. 4. Are located within [ADDRESS_255173] overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_212798] (given that sites are cluster randomized) and to thereby [CONTACT_212838]. 
6 FINAL PROTOCOL (10-01-2021)  5. Subjects 5.1. Inclusion Criteria ● Patients with back or neck pain of ≤ 3 months’ duration. All patients must have spi[INVESTIGATOR_212799]  ● Age ≥ 18 years ● Willing and able to provide informed consent  5.2. Exclusion Criteria ● Patients with symptoms attributed to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_212800] (e.g. those with cervicogenic headache without neck pain) ● Currently pregnant ● Currently receiving disability benefits, worker’s compensation, or involved in litigation for a workplace injury ● Currently enrolled in another intervention trial for the management of acute back or neck pain ● Cancer that is metastatic or being actively treated. (i.e., chemotherapy, radiation, surgery) ● History of receiving active therapy for back or neck pain in the past 3 months (7+ consecutive days of narcotic use, 6+ sessions of PT, chiropractic care, acupuncture, postural therapy, or other spi[INVESTIGATOR_212801] a trained provider)  ● History of spi[INVESTIGATOR_212802]/ablation in the past 6 months  ● Severe, active psychosis or major depression inhibiting ability to physically participate in intervention ● Red Flag Symptoms (fever, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, bowel or bladder dysfunction, neurologic weakness, current intravenous drug use)  
7 FINAL PROTOCOL (10-01-2021) 6. Interventions Clinics will be randomized to one of the following three arms as described below.  6.1 ARM 1: Usual care Subjects seeking care at a clinic assigned to this arm will receive usual care as directed by [CONTACT_29383].  Treatment modalities may include medications, specialty referrals, imaging, procedures such as injections, physical and psychological therapy, as appropriate.   6.2 ARM 2: PCP-led care + ICE Subjects seeking care at a clinic assigned to this arm will receive the ICE care model through referral by [CONTACT_29383].  The ICE care model was developed by [CONTACT_212839] a review of the peer-reviewed literature for adult subjects with incident neck or back pain who are not using high-dose opi[INVESTIGATOR_212803]-related long-term disability payments.  The care pathway is designed to take place over the course of six weeks and is intended to avoid low-value healthcare expenditures for subjects presenting with spi[INVESTIGATOR_212804]: 1. Stratifying subjects with back or neck pain into “low” and “high” risk groups, based on the STarT Back risk assessment tool (Appendix A) (25), and directing care accordingly (Figure 1).  The STarT Back tool is a validated instrument that was created to assist with the prediction of the transition of acute to chronic pain.  This tool measures a subject’s physical functionality as well as their experience with pain by [CONTACT_212840] 
8 FINAL PROTOCOL (10-01-2021) their pain causes psychological distress that may magnify the disability caused by [CONTACT_212841].  Baseline STarT Back tool responses have been shown to be predictive of pain intensity at six months (28).  Figure 1. Care Stratification Based on STarT Back Scoring Tool (©Keele University 01/08/07 Funded by [CONTACT_212842])  
 2. Directing low-risk subjects with uncomplicated back or neck pain and few psychosocial risk factors to a limited physical therapy course without additional diagnostic evaluation or specialty referral (Table 1). If subjects do not improve, they will be referred back to their primary care providers for further evaluation and treatment.  3. Referring high- and medium-risk subjects with significant biopsychosocial risk factors (i.e., a high degree of pain catastrophizing) predictive of chronicity to a novel spi[INVESTIGATOR_212805], normalization of experience, and self-management skills.  The team will consist of a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_212806] 

9 FINAL PROTOCOL (10-01-2021) rehabilitation lead, a “Spi[INVESTIGATOR_212807]” focusing on enabling subject self-motivation and an “ICE MD” who fulfills an advanced medical consultation role for those who do not improve after initial course of therapy.  The Spi[INVESTIGATOR_212808] a psychology counselor trained in motivational interviewing and supportive care delivered by [CONTACT_756].  The specific components of the ICE model are summarized below: Table 1.  Levels of care: Proposed frequency of contact [CONTACT_212843][INVESTIGATOR_212809] 1 session* 1 session None.  Patients who do not improve in six weeks will return to usual care. High and medium risk  Up to 3 sessions Up to 3 sessions† Consult to provide an individual treatment plan for all subjects. *If subject has improved prior to visit they will be able to cancel PT session in the conservative care pathway. †Frequency will be determined by [CONTACT_212844][INVESTIGATOR_212810]: 1. Physical Therapy (PT) – The ICE PT will perform their typi[INVESTIGATOR_212811] a detailed history pertinent about the subject’s spi[INVESTIGATOR_185775], perform a thorough physical exam, and then tailor the frequency and goals of therapy based on the subject’s STarT Back risk level.  Each practitioner will be trained to communicate with subjects using enabling language that reinforces self-efficacy skills and provides tools for self-management.  These encounters will take place in a local physical therapy practice commonly used by [CONTACT_212845]. 2. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_212807] – The Spi[INVESTIGATOR_212812], improve subject self-efficacy, and provide ongoing reinforcement. These encounters will 
10 FINAL PROTOCOL (10-01-2021) occur by [CONTACT_212846].  Subjects who are at low risk for chronicity will receive one call whereas individuals who are medium or high risk will receive up to three calls over the first six weeks of the intervention.  The coach will provide recommendations on self-management, guided by [CONTACT_212847] (29) and normalize the subject’s experience.  The Back Book was developed to explain the most common causes of musculoskeletal spi[INVESTIGATOR_185775], and ways to stay active while recovering.  The first outreach will take place within [ADDRESS_255174] (Appendix K) after each visit. 3. ICE MD – All subjects who are stratified to high or medium risk by [CONTACT_212848]-risk subjects who have no improvement in their pain despi[INVESTIGATOR_212813] [ADDRESS_255175]’s electronic health record available through their primary care provider’s office in conjunction with any study communication between the physical therapy team and spi[INVESTIGATOR_212814].  Based on review of this information, individualized treatment 
11 FINAL PROTOCOL (10-01-2021) recommendations will be provided to the primary care provider in a written summary that can then be carried out at the discretion of the primary care provider (Appendix B).  6.3. ARM 3: PCP-led care + IPT The Individualized Postural Therapy (IPT) is an alternative method of care for subjects with neck and back pain. This intervention was chosen to be representative of an alternative care model that is commonly used by [CONTACT_212849], either in conjunction with, or as an alternative to, usual care.  IPT involves the evaluation of a subject’s posture to identify postural and alignment deviations and, based on this, a personalized corrective exercise program is prescribed.  This method does involve the use of prescription medications, surgery, or manipulation. The initial consultation typi[INVESTIGATOR_212815] 60-[ADDRESS_255176] has been evaluated by [CONTACT_212850].  The amount of exercise required depends on the individual’s postural and mechanical dysfunctions, and time allowance.  A treatment course typi[INVESTIGATOR_212816].  In order to allow for the consistent delivery of this arm of the study at multiple study-sites across the country, IPT will be delivered by [CONTACT_212851] (30).  Egoscue was founded in 1971 and has 25 clinics worldwide.    7. Study Procedures 7.1 Randomization 
12 FINAL PROTOCOL (10-01-2021) Randomization will occur at the clinic level (i.e. subjects will be cluster randomized) in a 1:1:1 ratio to usual care, usual primary care + ICE, and usual primary care + IPT.  To ensure adequate balance between the treatment arms with respect to sample size practices will be categorized into blocks of 3 based on the average number of patients with spi[INVESTIGATOR_212817] a typi[INVESTIGATOR_3711], their location, and/or their provision of other services such as urgent/walk-in care.  Because of differences between the delivery networks participating in the trial, the stratification factors may differ by [CONTACT_157478]. Randomization will occur within these blocks.  7.[ADDRESS_255177] Identification The study will include individuals presenting for care with a chief complaint of back pain or neck pain.  Potentially eligible subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_212852]/or through screening when they present to the clinic for “same-day” or “walk-in” care.    7.3 Eligibility Screening  Patients presenting for care with spi[INVESTIGATOR_212818] a screening form to assess them for eligibility.  Subjects who meet the initial eligibility criteria will be given either a written informed consent form (Vanderbilt and UBC, Appendix D) or a verbal informed consent form (HonorHealth, Appendix 
13 FINAL PROTOCOL (10-01-2021) D) detailing the potential benefits and risks of participating in the study, and what would be required of them.  Consenting subjects will then be asked to complete the baseline surveys while waiting to be seen by [CONTACT_29383].  Their primary care provider will confirm that their symptom criteria are completed correctly and evaluate them for additional exclusion criteria that require clinical expertise (Appendix E).  Subjects who meet all the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study.   7.4 Baseline Surveys After providing consent, subjects will be asked to complete the baseline demographic data (Appendix F) and other baseline surveys (Table-3) using the study’s electronic data capture system (see Section 9.3).   7.[ADDRESS_255178] authorization to participate in the study using written informed consent at the time of their enrollment clinic visit. 
14 FINAL PROTOCOL (10-01-2021) HonorHealth sites will be required to obtain verbal consent for the subject to participate in the study. Information about the trial and the requirements of trial participation will be summarized in an informed consent document, whether verbal or written consent is obtained (Appendix D).   9. Outcomes 9.1 Primary Outcomes  The two primary outcomes for the trial will be: (a) spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-related cost of care at one year and (b) change in pain at three months as assessed by [CONTACT_212853] (ODI, Appendix G).  Secondary outcomes will include pain at 12 months, quality of life at 12 months assessed using the EQ-5D, and self-efficacy at 12 months assessed using a scale developed by [CONTACT_212854]. (31).  Table 2: Outcomes Primary Spi[INVESTIGATOR_212819] (measured by [CONTACT_212855]) at three months Secondary Change in pain (measured by [CONTACT_212855]) at one year Quality of life (measured by [CONTACT_28973]-5D) at one year Self-efficacy (measured by [CONTACT_212856]. al) at one year  9.1.[ADDRESS_255179]-reported utilization data (Appendix H).  Subject-reported utilization will be collected using monthly checklists for the first three months, then bimonthly for the following nine months, that are 
15 FINAL PROTOCOL (10-01-2021) based upon the approach recently employed by [CONTACT_212857]. (15) and originally developed by [CONTACT_212858]. (33).  Subjects will be asked about all healthcare services used, including primary care visits, emergency room encounters, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614], imaging studies (including MR and CT), prescriptions, and physical therapy services that pertain to spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-related healthcare (14,34).  Data from the utilization checklists will be categorized using Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes. Medications will be characterized using the Unified Medical Language System® Master Drug Database, Medi-Span®. Unit cost of these different services will be estimated using publicly available data sources. In specific, for outpatient visits to PCPs, specialists, physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_212820], we will use the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Physician Fee Schedule Look-Up Tool.[ADDRESS_255180] commonly used scale for low back pain (35). It is a self-administered questionnaire that has ten topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]: intensity of pain, lifting, sexual function, social life, sleep, and ability to walk, sit, stand, care for oneself, and travel.  It has been recommended as one of the standardized metrics for research of low back pain based on its ability to quantify functional 
16 FINAL PROTOCOL (10-01-2021) status in this population (36). The ODI typi[INVESTIGATOR_212821], and one minute to score (37).  Previous studies have evaluated the ODI in pain-free subjects and found that mean score to be 10.19 (35, 38, 39) and those with disability from low back pain is 22.07 (40).  Previous studies have indicated that a change in ODI by 6 points is clinically meaningful (41).    9.2 Other outcomes 9.2.1 Quality of Life Quality of life will be assessed by [CONTACT_20367]-5D (Appendix I), which has been shown to be beneficial in describing and valuing health related quality of life (42, 43). It was developed for self-completion, and has been validated against other measures of quality of life, including SF-12 (44).  The EQ-5D has been shown to correlate well with low back pain specific measurements, and also be responsive to change (45,46).  The instrument consists of a descriptive section and a visual analogue scale. The descriptive section measures 5 dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) with each dimension having 5 levels ranging from “no problem” to “extreme problem”. The visual analogue scale is a self-rated horizontal health scale with end points labelled as “the best health you can imagine” and “the worst health you can imagine”. The raw scores are converted into index scores based on US norms5. Previous studies identify a change in EQ-5D index of 0.08 as a minimal important clinical distance (47), and in a study evaluating the sensitivity to change of EQ-5D index with back pain it was seen that after two weeks there was a decrease of 0.21 after treatment; albeit this was in an interventional study that included steroid injections (46).  The 
17 FINAL PROTOCOL (10-01-2021) EQ-5D is also helpful in converting to quality adjusted life years (QALY) to perform a cost utility analysis, and is the most common measure for conversion (37).    9.2.2 Self-Efficacy   We will evaluate self-efficacy at baseline, six months, and one year.  As the focus of this trial is to support those with acute spi[INVESTIGATOR_212822], measuring self-efficacy both as a predictor and outcome of the treatment arms will be necessary as a metric of self-management for future epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  We will use Lorig et al.’s self-efficacy scale for individuals with musculoskeletal complaints, which has three subscales that focus on pain, functioning, and other symptoms (31).  Because spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-specific pain is already captured with ODI, we will use the “functioning” and “other symptoms” subscales in this trial to measure self-efficacy (Appendix J).  The “function” subscale produces an average of 73.27 (s.d. 20.22), and the “other symptoms” subscale produces an average of 55.62 (s.d. 21.64).  9.2.[ADDRESS_255181] from work, or other usual activities, associated with spi[INVESTIGATOR_212823].  The total number of unplanned work absences will be multiplied by [CONTACT_212859]'s daily wage to obtain the cost per participant of work absenteeism. Presenteeism will be assessed using the methods of van den Heuvel, et al (49). Three assertions will be ranked on a scale of 1-5: 1) I achieve all objectives of the job, 2) Job-
18 FINAL PROTOCOL (10-01-2021) related tasks come easily to me, and 3) I perform well in my job.  The scores will be dichotomized using the median value from all respondents.  A study participant will be described as suffering from presenteeism if they are above the median value.  9.2.4 Other outcomes We will measure implementation-related outcomes to assess intervention fidelity. These will include the number of protocol-specified appointments (i.e., Spi[INVESTIGATOR_212807], physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], or the Egoscue practitioner) scheduled and attended, the timing of visits and the length of the treatment course, which we originally expected to last 6 to 8 weeks.  9.3 Data Collection  Study data will be collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools (50)  hosted at Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Data will be collected based on the schedule in Table 3.  Study subjects will be contact[CONTACT_212860] a survey being due for completion to be notified that the survey is available.  If the survey is not completed they will be notified again three and five business days after the due date.  Should the study subject still not complete the survey, they will have three phone attempts to be reached and guided through completion.

Statistical considerations 10.[ADDRESS_255183] data in healthcare is not normally distributed (32) due to significant zero data representing subjects for whom there is little to no cost, we will have to model the data accordingly.  We will evaluate the two primary outcomes, total cost of care, using generalized estimating equations with gamma distributed errors and an identity link function which can account for a positively skewed distribution. Changes in ODI from baseline to three months will be compared for the treatment arms using generalized estimating with normally distributed errors and an identity link function.  All models will adjust for age and sex, account for the cluster and block randomized study design and include fixed effects for the 3 different delivery networks that were used for recruitment. In secondary analyses, we will repeat our models adjusting for unmatched confounders that remained despi[INVESTIGATOR_39470].  Our primary analyses will compare each of the two treatment arms separately with usual care (i.e., ICE compared with usual care and IPT with usual care). Because we are evaluating two primary 
20 FINAL PROTOCOL (10-01-2021) outcomes, we will use a Bonferroni-corrected two-tailed type 1 error of 0.025. Analysis of secondary outcomes will also be performed using generalized estimating equations with error distributions and link functions appropriate to the outcomes being evaluated.   Missing data will be accounted for using multiple imputation (51), which has been determined an adequate strategy to minimize both false positive and false negatives in clinical trials.  We will perform 20 imputations using Proc MI in SAS with a fully conditional specification. The following variables will be used to perform the imputation: age, study arm, study site, clinic, sex, race/ethnicity, BMI, exercise frequency at baseline, education level, employment status, smoking status, other medical conditions at baseline, number of medications used for spi[INVESTIGATOR_212824], length of pain at baseline, number of previous pain epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], STarT back score, baseline ODI, baseline self-efficacy, baseline EQ-5D, and scores for patient-reported outcomes at every follow-up timepoints (ODI, cost, Lorig self-efficacy scale, and EQ-5D).   As resource utilization and ODI were collected at multiple time points, we will also evaluate non-missing cost and ODI data from each time point using a repeated measures design. In specific, we will use generalized estimating equations, with link functions and error distributions appropriate to the study outcomes, to assess changes in outcomes over the [ADDRESS_255184] data in healthcare is not normally distributed with zero values for participants with no resource utilization during follow-up, we will winsorize estimated costs at the 95th 
21 FINAL PROTOCOL (10-01-2021) percentile in secondary analyses. We will report relative spending differences with confidence intervals and a two-tailed p value. As a sensitivity analysis, we will conduct a complete-case analysis on all non-missing values. Exploratory analyses will be performed evaluating the effect of the interventions on cost in various strata of clinical interest, including age, sex, STarT Back risk group, location of pain, and whether or not this was the subject’s first pain epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. We will also evaluate the percentage of subjects in each arm with a decrease in ODI of six points at three, six, and twelve months of follow-up.    10.[ADDRESS_255185] of care by 25% compared to usual care (52–54). Because of the lack of peer-reviewed literature evaluating the economic impact of IPT, an effect similar to ICE was assumed for the purpose of performing power calculations.  We will need to enroll a total of 3,096 patients (1,032 per arm) to conservatively detect a change in spending of 20% between either treatment arm and usual care with 80% power and an alpha of 0.05, with 33 clusters, and 10% loss to follow-up over the 12-month study period. Our results are robust to a standard deviation of 1.25 times the mean and an ICC value of 0.01. Given the substantially larger sample size required for our economic analyses, we powered our trial on the basis of this outcome, which would also give us more than 98% power to detect a 6-point change in ODI between each intervention arm and the usual care arm.

 [ADDRESS_255190]), prescriptions, and physical therapy services that pertain to spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-related healthcare (14,34).  Data from the utilization checklists will be categorized using Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes. Medications will be characterized using the Unified Medical Language System® Master Drug Database, Medi-Span®. Unit cost of these different services will be estimated using publicly available data sources. In specific, for outpatient visits to PCPs, specialists, physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_212820], we will use the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Physician Fee Schedule Look-Up Tool.[ADDRESS_255191] commonly used scale for low back pain (35). It is a self-administered questionnaire that has ten topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]: intensity of pain, lifting, sexual function, social life, sleep, and ability to walk, sit, stand, care for oneself, and travel.  It has been recommended as one of the standardized metrics for research of low back pain based on its ability to quantify functional status in this population (36). The ODI typi[INVESTIGATOR_212821], and one minute to score (37).  Previous studies have evaluated the ODI in pain-free subjects and found that mean score to be 10.19 (35, 38, 39) and those with disability from low back pain is 
 27 22.07 (40).  Previous studies have indicated that a change in ODI by 6 points is clinically meaningful (41).    2 Other outcomes 2.1 Quality of Life Quality of life will be assessed by [CONTACT_20367]-5D (Appendix I), which has been shown to be beneficial in describing and valuing health related quality of life (42, 43). It was developed for self-completion, and has been validated against other measures of quality of life, including SF-12 (44).  The EQ-5D has been shown to correlate well with low back pain specific measurements, and also be responsive to change (45,46).  The instrument consists of a descriptive section and a visual analogue scale. The descriptive section measures 5 dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) with each dimension having 5 levels ranging from “no problem” to “extreme problem”. The visual analogue scale is a self-rated horizontal health scale with end points labelled as “the best health you can imagine” and “the worst health you can imagine”. The raw scores are converted into index scores based on US norms5. Previous studies identify a change in EQ-5D index of 0.08 as a minimal important clinical distance (47), and in a study evaluating the sensitivity to change of EQ-5D index with back pain it was seen that after two weeks there was a decrease of 0.21 after treatment; albeit this was in an interventional study that included steroid injections (46).  The EQ-5D is also helpful in converting to quality adjusted life years (QALY) to perform a cost utility analysis, and is the most common measure for conversion (37).    
 28 2.2 Self-Efficacy   We will evaluate self-efficacy at baseline, six months, and one year.  As the focus of this trial is to support those with acute spi[INVESTIGATOR_212822], measuring self-efficacy both as a predictor and outcome of the treatment arms will be necessary as a metric of self-management for future epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  We will use Lorig et al.’s self-efficacy scale for individuals with musculoskeletal complaints, which has three subscales that focus on pain, functioning, and other symptoms (31).  Because spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-specific pain is already captured with ODI, we will use the “functioning” and “other symptoms” subscales in this trial to measure self-efficacy (Appendix J).  The “function” subscale produces an average of 73.27 (s.d. 20.22), and the “other symptoms” subscale produces an average of 55.62 (s.d. 21.64).  2.[ADDRESS_255192] from work, or other usual activities, associated with spi[INVESTIGATOR_212823].  The total number of unplanned work absences will be multiplied by [CONTACT_212859]'s daily wage to obtain the cost per participant of work absenteeism. Presenteeism will be assessed using the methods of van den Heuvel, et al (49). Three assertions will be ranked on a scale of 1-5: 1) I achieve all objectives of the job, 2) Job-related tasks come easily to me, and 3) I perform well in my job.  The scores will be dichotomized using the median value from all respondents.  A study participant will be described as suffering from presenteeism if they are above the median value. 
 29  2.4 Other outcomes We will measure implementation-related outcomes to assess intervention fidelity. These will include the number of protocol-specified appointments (i.e., Spi[INVESTIGATOR_212807], physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], or the Egoscue practitioner) scheduled and attended, the timing of visits and the length of the treatment course, which we originally expected to last 6 to 8 weeks.  Data Collection  Study data will be collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools (50)  hosted at Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Data will be collected based on the schedule in Table 3.  Study subjects will be contact[CONTACT_212860] a survey being due for completion to be notified that the survey is available.  If the survey is not completed they will be notified again three and five business days after the due date.  Should the study subject still not complete the survey, they will have three phone attempts to be reached and guided through completion. Table 2: Subject Reported Outcome Administration Schedule  Months After Enrollment Metric [ADDRESS_255193] data in healthcare is not normally distributed (32) due to significant zero data representing subjects for whom there is little to no cost, we will have to model the data accordingly.  We will evaluate the two primary outcomes, total cost of care, using generalized estimating equations with Poisson distributed errors and a log link function which can account for a positively skewed distribution. Changes in ODI from baseline to three months will be compared for the treatment arms using generalized estimating with normally distributed errors and an identity link function.  All models will adjust for age and sex, account for the cluster and block randomized study design and include fixed effects for the 3 different delivery networks that were used for recruitment. In secondary analyses, we will repeat our models adjusting for unmatched confounders that remained despi[INVESTIGATOR_39470].  Our primary analyses will compare each of the two treatment arms separately with usual care (i.e., ICE compared with usual care and IPT with usual care). Because we are evaluating two primary outcomes, we will use a Bonferroni-corrected two-tailed type 1 error of 0.025. Analysis of secondary outcomes will also be performed using generalized estimating equations with error distributions and link functions appropriate to the outcomes being evaluated.  
 31  Missing data will be accounted for using multiple imputation (51), which has been determined an adequate strategy to minimize both false positive and false negatives in clinical trials.  We will perform 20 imputations using Proc MI in SAS with a fully conditional specification. The following variables will be used to perform the imputation: age, study arm, study site, clinic, sex, race/ethnicity, BMI, exercise frequency at baseline, education level, employment status, smoking status, other medical conditions at baseline, number of medications used for spi[INVESTIGATOR_212824], length of pain at baseline, number of previous pain epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], STarT back score, baseline ODI, baseline self-efficacy, baseline EQ-5D, and scores for patient-reported outcomes at every follow-up timepoints (ODI, cost, Lorig self-efficacy scale, and EQ-5D).   As resource utilization and ODI were collected at multiple time points, we will also evaluate non-missing cost and ODI data from each time point using a repeated measures design. In specific, we will use generalized estimating equations, with link functions and error distributions appropriate to the study outcomes, to assess changes in outcomes over the [ADDRESS_255194]’s first pain epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. We will also evaluate the percentage of subjects in each arm with a decrease in ODI of six points at three, six, and twelve months of follow-up.  [ADDRESS_255195] of care by 25% compared to usual care (52–54). Because of the lack of peer-reviewed literature evaluating the economic impact of IPT, an effect similar to ICE was assumed for the purpose of performing power calculations.  We will need to enroll a total of 3,096 patients (1,032 per arm) to conservatively detect a change in spending of 20% between either treatment arm and usual care with 80% power and an alpha of 0.05, with 33 clusters, and 10% loss to follow-up over the 12-month study period. Our results are robust to a standard deviation of 1.25 times the mean and an ICC value of 0.01. Given the substantially larger sample size required for our economic analyses, we powered our trial on the basis of this outcome, which would also give us more than 98% power to detect a 6-point change in ODI between each intervention arm and the usual care arm.

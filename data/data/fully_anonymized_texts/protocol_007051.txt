Protocol Title: A Phase 2 Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Cross -Over Study to Evaluate 
Pharmacodynamic Effects, Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Multiple Oral Doses of TAK -831 in Adult 
Subjects With Schizophrenia
Study Design:
This study is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 2 -period crossover phase 2 study to evaluate the 
pharmacodynamic (PD) effects, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of multiple daily oral doses of 
TAK -[ADDRESS_1233827] of 2 treatment periods, and visits to the clinic at the following times: (1) Screening Period (Days 
-30 to -3) covering full medical, neurological, and psychiatric examinations; (2) Treatment Visits and inpatient stays: 
On Day -2 of Periods 1 and 2, subjects will be admitted to the clinic for 2- night stays; on Day -2, subjects will undergo 
baseline clinical assessment procedures and cognitive battery assessment. On Day -1, subjects will receive the 
baseline EEG and EBC assessments. In Period 1, those who continue to meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized 
via an interactive response technology (IRT) system to 1 of 2 treatment sequences. On Day 1, subjects will undergo 
predose blood PK/PD samples, first dosing, and postdose blo od draws, after which they will be discharged from the 
clinic to continue dosing at their residence. Subjects will receive double -blind treatment from Days 1 through 8 
(inclusive) with completion of efficacy and PK/PD -related assessments on Days 7 and 8 of each treatment period; and 
(3), a washout period between Treatment Periods 1 and 2 lasting between 14 to 21 days.
Subjects will be adults between ages 18 and 60, with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth 
Edition (DSM -5) diagnosis of schizophrenia who are receiving stable antipsychotic therapy (no increase or decrease 
>25% in dose in the preceding 2 months), and stable negative symptoms, as measured by [CONTACT_343868] (PANSS) during Screening and Baseline ( no fluctuations in PANSS negative symptom factor score 
[NSFS] >25%). PANSS total score will not exceed [ADDRESS_1233828] 15. Subjects with 
extrapy ramidal signs o r depressive symptoms will be excluded.
Additional screening assessments include physical and neurological examinations, clinical laboratory and 
electrocardiogram (ECG) measures, a toxicological screen, Screening for suicidality and depression using the 
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) and the Calgary Depression Scale Score (CDSS), respectively, 
assessment of extrapyramidal symptoms will be performed with the Simpson Angus Scale (SAS), and the presence of 
dyskinesias will be assessed with the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS).
Clinical laboratory testing, PK and D- and L -serine sample collection will be performed as per the schedule of events. 
If caregiver accompaniment is required, an adult caregiver will be permitted to attend clinical assessment visits with 
the study  participant. After completion of the initial treatment period, subjects will participate in a washout period 
lasting between [ADDRESS_1233829] administration of study drug.
During the double -blind treatment periods, subjects will arrive at the clinic on Day 7 of each Treatment Period, as 
required (see schedule of events for details), to receive study drug and/or undergo specified study procedures. Study 
drug for Days [ADDRESS_1233830]’s place of residence, such as su pervision by [CONTACT_464], a caregiver or a mobile device application to remotely 
monitor study drug adherence will be implemented.
A previous version of this protocol was started at a different site and stopped after [ADDRESS_1233831], including safety endpoints, will be analyzed separately from those obtained in 
the subjects enrolled in this study.

CONFIDENTIALMain Criteria for Evaluation and Analyses:
All analyses are for comparison between TAK -831 and placebo.
The primary endpoints of the study are:
Average percentage of conditioned responses during the EBC test at Day 8. 
The secondary endpoints will be assessed through evaluation of the following parameters: 
MMN amplitude at Fz (midline frontal elec trode, EEG) at Day 8. 
P300 amplitude at Pz (midline parietal electrode, EEG) at Day 8. 
ASSR at Cz (midline central electrode, EEG) at Day 8. 
BACS Cognitive battery composite score at Day 7. 
Plasma D -serine and L -serine levels, and D -serine:total serine ratio.
TAK -831 plasma concentrations. 
Statistical Considerations:
The [ADDRESS_1233835] of the interim analysis on 
the ty pe 1 error. The results of the primary endpoint will be considered statistically signif icant at either of the 2 doses 
(as applicable) if the one -sided p <0.05, without adjustment for multiplicity (ie, the type 1 error rate will be separately 
controlled for each dose).
In addition, the primary endpoint will be analyzed using a Bayesian normal linear model with treatment sequence, 
period, and treatment as fixed effects and subject within sequence as a repeated factor. The dependent variable is the 
change in response from the period baseline assessment to the final treatment day for each period. The response data 
will be logit transformed before the change is calculated. The Bayesian model will be used to estimate the posterior 
distribution of the treatment effect from each dose (as applicable).
Interim Analysis:
A small group from the sponsor wi ll remain unblinded to treatment assignment during the study for the purpose of 
conducting interim analyses of PD effects. In order to minimize any potential unblinding of investigators, these staff 
will not interact with the investigators or their staff.
A planned unblinded interim analysis of the primary endpoint will be conducted when approximately [ADDRESS_1233836] 
completed the evaluation for the primary endpoint. The site will be allowed to continue enrollment to the high/placebo 
comparison, with the g oal that approximately 16 patients will be randomized by [CONTACT_882276]. (The additional approximately 2 subjects will be included in the final analysis but not the interim.) The 
purpose of the interim PD analysis will be to dete rmine w hethe r to continue enrolling subjects to the 
high-dose/placebo comparison, switch enrollment to the low -dose/placebo comparison, or discontinue enrollment. 
The decision rule will be specified in an interim analysis plan before the data are unblinded for the interim analysis. In 
addition, a decision to switch to the low dose may be made based on safety or tolerability of the high dose .

CONFIDENTIALSample Size Justification:
Up to 32 subjects will be enrolled into this 2 -period crossover study. Initially 16 subjects will be randomized to one of 
the 2 sequences comparing the high dose to placebo: high -placebo or placebo -high. Based on the results of an interim 
analy sis, an additio nal 16 subjects may be randomized to one of the 2 sequences comparing the low dos e to placebo: 
low-placebo or placebo -low. This design and choice of sample sizes has been selected to be sensitive to a plausible and 
biologically meaningful range of effect sizes.

CONFIDENTIAL4.0 INTRODUCTION
4.1 Background
Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and 
behaves. The onset of the disease is usually in late adolescence or early adulthood, it affects up to 
1% of the populat ion and increases to 10% in individuals having a first -degree relat ive suffering 
from the disorder (40% to 65% for ident ical twins) [1-3] . Symptoms of schizophrenia can be 
subdivided into [ADDRESS_1233843] classes: positive, negat ive, and cognit ive symptoms [4]. Posi tive 
symptoms include hallucinat ions, delusio ns, and disordered th ought and speech, and can be 
summarized as psychosis. Negat ive symptoms include reduced emotion, reduced abilit y to 
experience pleasure (anhedonia), lack of motivat ion and reduced social interact ion. Finally, 
cogni tive symptom s include poor information processing, impaired abilit y to focus on obj ectives, 
and abnormalit ies of working memory and learning [4]. Deficits in glutamatergic transmissio n are 
hypothesized to play  an important role in the pathophysio logy of  the disorder, parti cularl y in 
relation to the genesis of cognit ive impairment, negative symptoms, and anhedonia [5]. 
While current ly available antipsychotics are broadly effect ive for the treatm ent of posi tive 
symptoms, the treatment of negative symptoms and cognitive deficits of schizophrenia remains a 
major unmet medical need. These are the most disabling aspects of schizophrenia, for which there 
are no approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
Inhibit ion of D-amino acid oxidase (DAO) is a promising target for the treatm ent of schizophrenia. 
Hypofunction of N-methyl-D- aspartate (NMDA) receptors is considered a potential mechanism in 
the pathophy siology of schizophrenia, which could be mit igated with increased D -serine l evels in 
the brain [6]. Changes in the D -serine levels or D -serine to total serine ratios have b een reported in 
the plasma o f patients with schizophrenia both naive and under drug treatment [7-10] . In addit ion, 
serine racemase (the D -serine generating enzyme) and the NMDA NR2A subunit are among the 
risk genes ident ified from the recent l arge scale geno me-wide associat ion stud iesanalysis, 
indicat ing the bio logical  relevance to schi zophrenia of the genet ic pathway in which DAO sit s 
[11].
DAO is invo lved in D- serine m etabo lism in the brain and has been associated with the regulat ion 
of glutam atergi c neurotransmissio n [12]. Inhibit ion of DAO elevates endogenous D -serine in the 
cerebellum, increasing Purkinje cell long term depressio n via act ivation of glutam ate recep tor
(GluR)2 and/or NMDA receptors with subsequent α -amino -3-hydroxy -5-methyl-4- isoxazo le 
propi [INVESTIGATOR_496322] d (AMPA) receptor internalizat ion [13].
Adding to the above evidence of a potential ro le of DAO in the pathophysio logy of schizophrenia, 
a weak inhibitor of DAO, sodium benzoate, demonstrated efficacy in posit ive, negat ive, and 
cogni tive symptoms in a proof -of-concept study  in subjects wi thschizophrenia [14].
While current medicat ions mitigate posit ive symptoms of schizophrenia, persistent negat ive 
symptoms and cognit ive impairment represent areas of unmet med ical need. Moreover, cognit ive 
impairment and negat ive symptoms are associated with funct ional outcom es to a greater degree 
than posi tive symptom s and rem ain an area of focus for the development of novel therapeut ics.
TAK -[ADDRESS_1233844] been conducted in healt hy subjects: a first -in-human study  to 
determine the pharmacokinet ic (PK) profiles of TAK -831 oral  suspensi on after single -rising dose 
(SRD) and m ultiple-rising dose (MRD) administration, as well as the relat ive bioavailabilit y and 
effect of food on the PK of the T1 tablet formulat ion of TAK-831 (TAK -831- 1001); and a study to 
demonstrate DAO target engagement in the brain as measured by  [CONTACT_87805]  
(PET) (TAK -831-1003). Plasma D -serine levels, TAK -[ADDRESS_1233845] 
bioavailabilit y study with the T2 tablet formulat ion (TAK -831- 1004) has co mpleted active dosing, 
and a study  examining addit ional es calat ing multiple doses of TAK -831 higher than those 
achieved in the TAK -831- 1001 study  was init iated and is ongoing (TAK -831- 1005).
TAK -[ADDRESS_1233846] commo n treatment -emergent adverse

4.4 Benefit/Risk Profile
There i s no benefit to subjects in this clinical study.
The fo llowing ri sk mit igation measures will be implemented in this study  with TAK -831. These 
measur es are based on what is known about the mechanism o f action of  TAK -831, nonclinical 
data, and the 2 phase 1 studies conducted to date, and general considerat ions in the development of 
new chemical ent ities. Procedures may be added during the study if neces sary based on evaluat ion 
of any addit ional clinical or nonclinical safet y data.
The dosing and duration of TAK -[ADDRESS_1233855] not resulted in a safet y signal that would prevent addit ional studi es.
Acute hypersensit ivity/anaphylact ic reactions to new chemical entit ies are al ways a possible 
risk in any clinical study . Appropri ate procedures should be used to manage such possible 
risks. 
Subjects with a risk of suicide according to the in vestigator’s clinical judgment (or as assessed 
by [CONTACT_48649] -Suicide Severi ty Rating Scale [15]), or who have made a suicide attempt in 
the previous 12 months, will be excluded fro m this study . The Col umbia -Suicide Se verity 
Rating Scale (C -SSRS) will be administered at prescribed intervals to monitor emergent 
suicidality. Subjects shoul d be m onitored f or any  signs of suicidal  ideation or behaviors, and 
appropriate psy chiatri c intervent ions or other precautions should b e insti tuted, if warranted.
Emesis and diarrhea were reported in laboratory  animals exposed to TAK -[ADDRESS_1233856] igator for guidance in the management of these 
symptoms and possible ways to mit igate them. 
Postural hypotensio n and dizziness were observed in prior studies in healt hy subjects.

by [CONTACT_87807], inflammat ion, or impaired renal funct ion and were not considered 
adverse. Similar findings have been reported in the literatu re and are considered to be 
species -specific to the rat [16]. There have been no findings o f elevations in creat inine in 
clinical studies wit h TAK -831 summarized above; creatinine will cont inue to be measured in 
the clinical studies .
Study  procedure –specific risks include issues relat ing to blood collection for safet y 
assessment/ pharmacokinetic (PK) monitoring (venipuncture may cause bruising), and the 
placement of el ectrocardi ogram  (ECG) pads, wh ich may cause so me local redness and/or 
erythema/i tching. The PD assessments planned for the study , aside from  those requi ring a 
blood draw, are noninvasive and are associated with minimal risk.

the purposes of conducting interim analyses. Limit ed treatment duration is needed for a cross -over 
design and is consistent with PD effects observed in nonclin ical studies wi th single doses or 
multiple doses up to 14 days . 
6.2.2 Rationale for Dose 
Effects of 2 dose levels of TAK -831 or placebo will be evaluated. The proposed doses of TAK -831 
(500 and 50 mg once daily  [QD]) have been selected based on PK data from th e single -rising 
(SRD)/mult iple-rising dose (MRD) studies (TAK -831- 1001 and TAK -831- 1005), brain target 
occupancy  data f rom the posi tron emissio n tom ography (PET) study  (TAK -831- 1003), PK and 
food effect study  (TAK -831-1004), CSF D -serine data from the TAK -831- [ADDRESS_1233869] D -serine increase 
near the plateau. Preliminary  PK/PD m odeling analyses also showed that the high dose regimen 
resul ted in steady -state exposures associated with mean peak target occupancy o f ≥90%, while the 
lower dose regimen produced daily exposures associated with mean peak target occupancy  of 
≥50%. Both doses are predicted to demonstrate D -serine (PD) effects based on prec linical efficac y 
models. These 2 dose levels may allow characterization of an exposure -response relat ionship wit h 
pharmacodynamic measures. The planned dose regimens are expected to deliver mean exposures 
within the range previously studied in study  TAK -831- 1001 and TAK -831- 1005 that were found 
to be well tolerated. 
6.2.3 Rationale for Endpoints
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Endpoint
EBC Test
Disrupted cerebellar funct ion has been hypothesized to contribute to schizophrenia 
pathophysio logy by [CONTACT_882278]-cerebellar -thalamic -cortical ci rcuits. Pati ents 
with cerebellar l esions m ay display non -motor defici ts such as impaired attention, language and 
executive funct ion. In schizophrenia, cerebellar abnormalit ies have been found including reduced 
volume of vermis, lobules a nd hemispheres, and reductions in size and densit y of Purkinje cells. In 
addition, cerebellar abnormalit ies are correlated with symptoms and clinical outcomes [17]. 
EBC i s highly conserved amo ng mammalian species and is a commo nly used method to 
investigate cerebellar funct ion [18,19]. In EBC, a condit ioned st imulus (CS), a tone precedes but 
coterminates with an uncondit ioned st imulus (US), an airpuff to the eyelid. Learning is

CONFIDENTIALdemonstrated when an eyeblink (the condit ioned resp onse [CR]) occurs prior to the onset of the 
US. Mult iple studi es have evaluated EBC in schizophrenia with the majorit y indicat ing deficit s 
relative to control subjects [19]. Neural circuits in the cerebellum, including cerebellar cortex and 
interposi tus nucleus are essent ial to the devel opment and m anifestati on of the CR. NMDA 
receptors, in particular the GluN2 subunit, appear to play  a cri tical role for the development of 
EBC. In preclinical studies, TAK -831 1 m g/kg per oral  administrati on improved the rate of 
acquisit ion of the condi tioned response rel ative to untreated and vehicle treated control groups. 
Furtherm ore, i t significant ly co mpensated the deleterious effects of scopolamine (0.3 mg/kg, sc) 
administration on the generation of condit ioned eyelid responses and completely reversed 
scopol amine induced de ficits at 1 m g/kg. 
As acquisit ion of delay EBC is impaired in schizophrenia and hypothesized to be linked to 
cerebellar -cortical circui t function, it may be subject to therapeutic intervent ion with TAK -831 
[18]. Of note, the EBC test has been used previously for the evaluat ion of experimental 
therapeuti cs in schizophrenia [20]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Endpoints
ERPs
The ERPs to be measured (via scalp EEG) include the mismatch negat ivity potenti al during the 
oddball paradigm (MMN), and the ASSR task. These tests have been linked to NMDA receptor 
funct ion [21-24 ]and have demonstrated differences between subjects with schizophrenia and 
control  subjects.
MMN is an ERP evoked in response to unattended changes in background stimulat ion. MMN is 
believed to reflect an automat ic process of detecting a mismatch between a deviant stimulus and a 
sensory -memo ry trace. Sm aller amplitudes of MMN have been consistent ly identified in 
schizophrenia subjects, showing promise as a quantitative clinical bio marker of the disease [25]. 
MMN amplitude is sign ificant ly reduced by [CONTACT_113883] [21] and is associated with 
ketamine -induced psychotic experiences [22]. Hence, MMN may index NMDA funct ion in 
humans. Moreover, MMN is associated with cognitive and psychosocial functioning in 
schizophrenia [26]. MMN has demonstrated stability  in clinical populat ions wi th high test -retest 
reliabilit y over 1 year [27,28]. Hence, MMN represents a potentially informat ive probe of sensory 
processes for use in experimental medicine studies of novel therapeut ics. Its association wit h 
NMDA receptor funct ion suggests that it may be sensit ive to modulat ion with TAK -831.
The P300 wave is an ERP component that is elicited by [CONTACT_7324] a novel, behaviorally 
relevant target stimulus embedded amo ng irrelevant stim uli in a manner similar to MMN, but 
requi ring act ive listening and responding fro m participants. Auditory  stimuli are presented in an 
oddball paradigm consist ing of [ADDRESS_1233870] ive deficit s on assessment of sensory  function. These deficit s can be 
produced by  [CONTACT_882279]-stage 
disturbances in the cognit ive processing of such inputs. SSRs can be used to assess the integrit y of 
sensory  pathways including cortical processing. Steady  state response can be maximized when 
delivered as ASSR stimuli at ~[ADDRESS_1233871] EEG array  [29] or using magneto 
electroencephalography [
30]. Therefore, ASSR appears to be a promising surrogate measure to 
evaluate NMDA funct ion in humans.
Cognitive Batt
ery
Cogni tive deficit s are a core, enduring aspect of schizophrenia. Cognit ive deficit s are m ore 
strongly  associated wi th functional outcom es than psychoti c symptoms, yet there are no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_882260] a major u nmet need in the treatment of 
schizophrenia. Mult iple clinical development programs for the treatment of CIAS have not been 
able to successfully demo nstrate adequate evidence of efficacy . Recent ly sodium benzoate, a weak 
inhibitor of DAO, showed efficacy i n multiple cognit ive measures in a small phase 2 study  when 
used as add- on therapy  in schizophrenia subjects [14]. 
D
-and L -Serine
Changes in the D -serine levels or D -serine to total serine ratios have been reported in the plasma o f 
patients wi th schizophrenia, both naive to drug treatment and under drug treatment [7-10] . 
Inhibit ion of DAO elevates endogenous D -serine in the cerebellum and plasma of rats. Analysis o f 
changes in D -serine levels, and D -serine to total  serine rati os will  allow an evaluat ion of PD 
effects, and  
will allow a 
preliminary evaluat ion of the potential utilit y of these bio markers to select for patients that may  
benefit from treatment with TAK -831.

measurements for each individual subject and should be the same for all subjects.
Subjects sho uld rest in a semirecumbent position for at least 5 minutes prior to having vital sign 
measurements obtained. Vital signs will include heart rate (HR) and sy stolic and diastolic blood 
pressure. The same method (eg, same size cuff, manual or automated) must be used for all 
measurements for each individual subject and should be the same for all subjects.

Prior to each treatm ent peri od/cohort, a predose ECG will be obtained on Day  -2. Thi s 
measurement will be used as the baseline. The principal invest igator should arrange to have a 
study  cardi ologist available as needed to review ECG tracings with abnorm alities.
During each treatment period, if a subject demonstrates an increase in QTcF interval ≥40 msec 
compared wi th a predose baseline measurement, the ECG will be repeated within 5 minutes. The

9.2.8 CDSS
The CDSS was developed to assess symptoms of major depressive disorder in patients with 
schizophrenia, and specifically  designed to assess comorbid depressive symptoms. The CDSS 
consists of nine items: depressed mood, hopelessness, self -deprecat ion, guilt y ideas of reference, 
pathol ogical guilt, depressio n worse in the morning, early  wakening, sui cide and observed 
depressio n. The items on the CDSS are all t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_882268] s and do not appear to 
overl ap wi th the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The tool is administered via an interview 
with the subject.
9.2.9 PANSS
The PANSS is an interview -based measure of the severit y of psychopathol ogy in adults wit h 
psychoti c disorders. The measure is comprised of 30 items and 3 scales: the Posit ive scale assesses 
hallucinat ions, delusio ns, and related symptoms; the Negative scal e assesses em otional 
withdrawal , lack of m otivati on, and similar symptom s; and the General Psychopathology  scale 
addresses other symptoms such as anxiet y, som atic concern, and disorientation. An anchored 
Likert scale from  1 to 7, where values of 2 and abov e indicate the presence of progressively  more 
severe symptoms, is used to score each item. Individual items are then summed to determine 
scores for the 3 scales, as well as a total score. A Composite scale score (Posi tive scale score minus 
Negative scale s core) can al so be calculated to show the relat ive valence of posit ive and negative 
symptoms. Total time required for the PANSS interview and scoring is approximately 30 to 
40minutes [39-41 ]. PANSS raters will be required to meet specific training and educat ion criteria

per schedule of assessments.

TAK -[ADDRESS_1233916] who has 
signed inform ed consent to participate in a study; it does not necessarily  have to have a causal 
relationship with the treatment.
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically sig nificant abnormal 
laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a drug, whether or 
not it is considered related to the drug.
An untoward finding generally may:
Indicate a new diagnosis or unexpected worsening of a preexist ing condit ion. (Intermittent 
events for pre -exist ing condit ions underlying disease should not be considered AEs.)
Necessitate therapeutic intervent ion.
Requi re an invasive diagnostic procedure.
Requi re discontinuation or a change in dose of study medicat ionor a concomitant medicat ion.
Be considered unfavorable by [CONTACT_4168].
Diagnoses versus signs and symptoms:
Each event should be recorded to represent a single  diagnosis. Acco mpanying signs (including 
abnorm al laboratory  values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as 
additional AEs. If  a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be recorded 
appropriately  as an AE(s).
Laboratory  values and ECG findings:
Changes in laboratory  values or ECG param eters maybe consider ed to be AEs if they  are 
judged to be clinically  significant (i e, if som e act ion or intervent ion is required or if the 
investigator judges the change to be bey ond the range of normal physio logic fluctuati on). A 
laboratory  re-test and/or continued monitorin g of an abnormal value are not considered an 
intervent ion. In addit ion, repeated or addit ional noninvasive testing for verificat ion, evaluatio n 
or monitoring of an abnormalit y is not considered an intervent ion.
If abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings are the result of pathology for which there is an 
overall diagnosis (eg, increased creat inine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be 
reported appropriately  as an AE.
Pre-exist ing condit ions:
A pre -exist ing condit ion (present at the time of signin g of informed consent) is considered a 
concurrent medical history  condi tion and shoul d NOT be recorded as an AE. A baseline 
evaluat ion (eg, laboratory  test, ECG, X -ray, etc) shoul d NOT be recorded as an AE unless 
related to a study  procedure. However, if t he subject experiences a worsening or complicat ion 
TAK -831

Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 06 14 January 2020
CONFIDENTIALof such a concurrent medical history  condi tion, the worsening or complication should be 
recorded appropriately as an AE (worsening or complicat ion occurs after informed consent is 
signed). Invest igators sh ould ensure that the event term recorded captures the change in the 
condi tion (eg, “worsening of…”).
If a subject has a pre -exist ing epi[INVESTIGATOR_45283] (eg, asthma, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]), any occurrence of an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_882269], serious, or 
severe in nature, that is, invest igators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the 
change from in the condit ion (eg “worsening of…”).
If a subject has a degenerat ive concurrent condition (eg, cataracts, rheumatoid arthri tis), 
worsening of the condit ion should only be captured as an AE if occurring to a greater extent to 
that which would be expected. Again, investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded 
captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening of… ”).
Worsening of AEs:
If the subject experiences a worsening or complicatio n of an AE aft er the first administration of 
study  medicat ion or after any  change in study  medicat ion, the worsening or complicat ion 
shoul d be recorded as a new AE. Investigators sh ould ensure that the AE term recorded 
captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening of…”).
Changes in severit y of AEs:
If the subject experiences a change in the severit y of an AE that is not associated with a change 
in study  medicati on, the event shoul d be captured once with the maximum severit y recorded.
Prepl anned surgeries or procedures:
Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) that were scheduled prior to signing of 
inform ed consent are not considered AEs. However, if a preplanned procedu re is performed 
early (eg, as an emergency) due to a worsening of the pre -exist ing condit ion, the worsening o f 
the condi tion shoul d be captured appropriately  as an AE. Com plicati ons resul ting fro m any 
planned surgery  should be reported as AEs.
Elect ive sur geries or procedures:
Elect ive procedures performed where there is no change in the subject’s medical condit ion 
shoul d not be recorded as AEs but should be documented in the subject’s source documents. 
Com plicat ions result ing from an elect ive surgery shoul d be reported as AEs.
Overdose:
An overdose is defined as a known deliberate or accidental administration of investigational 
drug, to or by  a study  subject, at a dose above that which is assigned to that individual subject 
according to the study protocol. It is up to the investigator or the reporting physician to decide 
whether a dose is to be considered an overdose, in consultation wit h the Sponsor.
All cases of overdose (with or without associated AEs) will be documented on an Overdose 
page of the eCRF, i n order to capture this important safet y information consistent ly in the

categori es:
Related: An AE that fo llows a reasonable temporal sequence fro m admi nistrati on of  a 
drug (including the course after withdrawal o f the drug), or for which a causal 
relationship is at least a reasonable possibilit y, ie, the relati onship cannot be 
ruled out, al though factors other than the drug, such as underlying diseases, 
complicat ions, conco mitant drugs and concurrent treatments, may also be 
responsible.

CONFIDENTIAL11.0 STATISTICAL METHODS
11.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
A stati stical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized prior to unblinding of treatment 
assignments to the study team. This document will provide further details regarding the definit ion 
of analysis variables and analysis methodology  to address a ll study  object ives. In cases of 
inconsistencies between the protocol and the SAP in regard to data analysis, the SAP is to take 
precedence over the protocol. Due to this clear understanding of precedence, the statist ical analysis 
section will not necessar ily be updated to m atch the SAP when the protocol is amended.
A targeted data review will be conducted prior to unblinding of treatment assignments to the study 
team . This review will assess the accuracy  and completeness of the study  database, subject 
evaluabili ty, and appropri ateness of the planned statist ical methods .
11.1.1 Analysis Sets
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Set
The Safety Set will include all randomized subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_1233931] ics, and 
safet y summaries.
[IP_ADDRESS] PK Set
The PK Set will include all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of double -blind study 
medication and who have any available plasma concentration data .
[IP_ADDRESS] PD Set
The PD set will cons ist of all subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_1233932] and summarized by [CONTACT_882286] . 
Individual concentration -time data will be pooled to describe the populat ion PK of TAK -831. As 
data permit, a nonlinear mixed effects modeling approach (NONMEM software) will be used to 
TAK -[ADDRESS_1233933] asma 
concentrations and drug response will be explored. As appropriate, historical data may  be used in 
this analysis to increase the robustness o f the model and precisio n of estimated pa rameters. Details 
of the m odeling approach will be provided in a separate analysis plan, and the results of these 
analyses may be reported separately.
11.1.4 PD Analysis 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Primary PD Endpoint 
Pairwise com parisons between act ive treatments and placebo will be generated within the 
framework of analysis of variance (ANOVA), with treatment sequence, period, and treatment as 
fixed effects. Subject nested within sequence is included as a rando m effect. The dependent 
variable is the change in response fro m the peri od baseline assessment to the final treatment day  
for each period. The analysis will be performed using observed data. Poten tial carry over effects 
will be invest igated. P -values and confidence intervals will be reported.
A frequent ist analysis will b e done for the full data set, using simulat ions to adjust for the effect of 
the interim analysis on the type I error rates. The results of the primary endpo int will be considered 
statist ically significant at either of the 2 doses (as applicable) if the one -sided p<0.05, without 
adjustm ent for multiplicity (ie, the ty pe I error rate will be separately controlled for each dose). 
In addit ion, the primary  endpoint will  be analyzed using a Bayesian normal linear model with 
treatm ent sequence, period, and treatm ent as fixed effects and subject within sequence as a 
repeated factor. The dependent variable is the change in response fro m the period baseline 
assessment to the final treatment day  for each period. The response data will be logit transformed 
before the c hange is calculated. A diffuse normal distribut ion will be used as a prior for the 
regression coefficients and a diffuse inverse gamma for the residual variance. The Bayesian mode l 
will be used to estimate the posterior distribut ion of the treatment effect from each dose (as 
applicable) . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Other PD Endpoints 
The secondary  EEG endpoints will be analyzed using an ANOVA model as described in 
Secti on11.1.4.[ADDRESS_1233934] deviat ion set to 1 [44]. A composite score will be 
calculated by [CONTACT_113116] 4 measures from the BACS used in the study , and then calculat ing a
z-score of the composite. The composite z -score indi cates how m uch higher or l ower the 
participant’s cognit ion is co mpared to a healthy person. An ANOVA will be performed on the 
change from baseline for the composite BACS score, using a similar model to t hat used for 
primary  endpoint.
TAK -[ADDRESS_1233935] regimens 
(high dose, low dose and placebo) will be made and the CIs for the difference in the LS means will 
be constructed for selected time po ints. Addit ional details and further analyses will be specified in 
the stati stical analysis plan.
There will be no adjust ment for the m ultiplicity of secondary  endpoints.
Analysis of exploratory  PD endpo ints will be described in the SAP.

Helsinki, and the International Conference on Harmo nisat ion (ICH) Harm onised Tri partite 
Guideline for GCP. Each investigator will conduct the study  according to applicable local or 
regional regulatory  requi rements and align his or her conduct in accordance wit h the 
“Responsibilit ies of the Investigator” that are listed in Appendix A. The principles of Helsinki are 
addressed through the protocol and through appendices containing requirements for informed 
consent and invest igator responsibilit ies.
13.1 IRB and/or IEC Approval
IRBs and IECs must be constituted according to the applicable state and federal/local requirements 
of each participat ing region. The Sponsor or designee will require documentation noting all names 
and tit les of members who make up the respective IRB or IEC. If any member of the IRB or IEC 
has di rect parti cipat ion in this study , written notification regarding his or her abstinence fro m 
voting must also be obtained. Those Americas sites unwilling to provide names a nd titles of  all

Assurance Number or comparable number assigned by [CONTACT_9930].
The Sponsor or designee will supply  relevant docu ments for submissio n to the respective IRB or 
IEC for the protocol’s review and approval. This protocol, the Invest igator’s Brochure, a copy o f 
the informed consent form, and, if applicable, subject recruit ment materials and/or advertisements 
and other doc uments required by [CONTACT_1763], must be submitted to a 
central  or local IRB or IEC for approval. The IRB’s or IEC’s written approval of the protocol and 
subject informed consent must be obtained and submitted to the Sponsor or desig nee before 
commencement of the study  (ie, before shipment of the Sponsor -supplied drug or study  specific 
screening activit y). The IRB or IEC approval must refer to the study  by [CONTACT_45343], 
number, and versio n date; ident ify versio ns of other docume nts (eg, informed consent form) 
reviewed; and state the approval date. The Sponsor will ship drug/notify site once the Sponsor has 
confirmed the adequacy of site regulatory  docum entati on and, when applicable, the Sponsor has 
received permissio n from competent authori ty to begin the study . Until the si te receives 
drug/notificat ion no protocol activit ies, including screening, may occur.

It is the responsibilit y of the invest igator to explain the detailed elements of the informed consent 
form, subject authorizat ion form (if applicable) , and subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) to the 
subject. Information should be given in both oral and written form whenever possible and in the 
manner deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_4186]. In the event the subject is not capable of rendering 
adequat e wri tten inform ed consent, then the subject’s legally  acceptable representative may 
provi de such consent for the subject in accordance with applicable laws and regulat ions.
The subject, or the subject’s legally acceptable representative, must be given amp le opportunit y to: 
(1) inquire about details o f the study, and (2) decide whether or not to participate in the study. If the 
subject, or the subject’s legally acceptable representative, determines he or she will part icipate in 
the study , then the informed consent form  and subject authorizat ion form (if applicable) m ust be 
signed and dated by  [CONTACT_423], or the subject’s legally  acceptable representative, at the time of 
consent and prior to the subject entering into the study . The subject or the subject’s l egally

using blue or black ballpo int ink. The invest igator must also sign and date the informed consent 
form and subject authorizat ion (if applicable) at th e tim e of consent and pri or to subject entering 
into the study; however, the Sponsor may allow a designee of the invest igator to sign to the extent 
permitted by  [CONTACT_1289].
Once signed, the original informed consent form, subject authorization form (if appl icable), and 
subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) will be stored in the invest igator’s site file. The 
investigator must document the date the subject signs the informed consent in the subject’s

Definitions and Procedures for Contraception and Pregnancy Avoidance
The follow ing definitions apply for contraception and pregnancy avoidance procedures.
* A wom an is considered a woman of childbearing potential, ie, fert ile, fo llowing menarche and 
until becoming post -menopausal unless permanently  sterile. Perm anent sterilizat ion methods 
include hysterectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy . A postmenopausal state is defined as no 
menses for 12 months wit hout an alternative medical ca use. A FSH l evel in the postm enopausal 
range (FSH >40 IU/L) may be used to confirm a post- menopausal state in y ounger wom en (eg, 
those <45 year old) or women who are not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement 
therapy . However, in the absence of 12 m onths of am enorrhea, a single FSH measurement is 
insufficient.

participant and that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the 
surgi cal success.
–True sexual abst inence, only if this is in line wit h the preferred and usual lifes tyle of the 
subject. True abst inence is defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during 
the entire period of the study, fro m [ADDRESS_1233970]

No m ethod at all.
Use of fema le and male condoms together.
Cap/di aphragm/sponge wi thout spermicide and wit hout condom .
Sexual abst inence is NOT an acceptable method of contraception.
4.Subjects will be provided with informat ion on e ffective methods of contraception as part of the

1 Introduction  
1.1 Overview  
Imaging and staging of prostate cancer is critical for surgical and treatment planning.  We aim to 
image patients with suspected metastatic prostate cancer using Gallium -68 labeled HBED -CC 
PSMA (more commonly called 68Ga-PSMA-11)  in order to demonstrate its utility.   We plan to 
utilize this data to obtain further approvals of the 68Ga-PSMA -[ADDRESS_1015044] the necessary data for future FDA approval.  This protocol was developed in 
 
Protocol UMCC Number  2017.016                                                                                 Version date: Sept. 13, [ADDRESS_1015045] commonly diagnosed cancer and second leading cause of cancer 
death in American men 1. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) of prostate cancer is defined as a 
confirmed PSA value of ≥  0.2 ng/dL if the patient has had a radical prostatectomy (RP) with or 
without postoperative radiation therapy (adjuvant or salvage).  If the initial local therapy was definitive radiation therapy (RT), biochemical recurrence is defined as the nadir PSA value plus 
2 ng/mL, since some benign PSA -producing tissue may remain.  Patients with BCR after RP 
who have not received postoperative RT are fr equently treated with salvage RT to the prostate 
bed, which can be curative for some. Patients with BCR after initial definitive RT may be 
salvaged with brachytherapy or in some cases with surgery.  However, for patients with BCR 
and no further local therapy options, there is no consensus as to optimal management.   
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_742583] 
2 with eventual 
initiation of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in many patients as the PSA rises. The risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_742584] 15– 20% at 5 and 25– 30% at [ADDRESS_1015046] threshold at which to initiate systemic androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in 
patients with BCR remains controversial. In one retrospective cohort of over 5,[ADDRESS_1015047] techniques at this time- point:  
- Imaging is perfor med for the detection and characterization of disease to select 
treatment or guide change in management.  
- Anatomic imaging techniques include plain film radiographs, ultrasound, CT, and MRI.  
- Functional imaging techniques include radionuclide bone scan, PE T, and advanced MRI 
techniques such as spectroscopy and diffusion- weighted imaging (DWI). 
More specifically, Current U.S. guidelines recommend either a radionuclide bone scan, 
abdominopelvic CT, multi -parameter MRI or –  where available - choline PET/CT for  patients 
with rising PSA or clinical symptoms 
7. The probability of a positive bone scan is reported to be 
<5% with a serum PSA level of <7 ng/mL. A CT scan will only be positive in 11– 14% of patients 
 
Protocol UMCC Number  2017.016                                                                                 Version date: Sept. 13, [ADDRESS_1015048] scan was 27.4 ng/ml 8.  
Due to this limitation, of existing conventional imaging 9, numerous approaches to stage patients 
have been evaluated. Choline imaging has been frequently used, as prostate cancer exhibits 
increase choline uptake that has been associated with the presence of choline kinase 10.  
Choline uptake is increased in comparison to FDG in both androgen dependent and 
independent prostate cancer patients  11.  Choline has also been shown to be sensitive for the 
detection of recurrent tumor in patients with PSA (prostate specific antigen) values of l ess than 
1.0 ng/ml  12.  There are two forms of choline that are used in imaging prostate cancer, 11C - and 
18F-choline.  11C-choline has a short half-life of [ADDRESS_1015049] better detection rates for distant metastatic disease 13. 
11C-choline has limited sensitivity for osseous metastasis, possibly due to the decreased uptake 
time 14.  Additionally, the sensitivity of 11C -choline i s limited in patients with PSA values < 1.0 
ng/ml  15-17.  Although choline PET may be limited in sensitivity, it clearly delineates more lesions 
than cross section imaging or bone scan in patients with known disease 18. In 2012, the Mayo 
Clinic obtained ND A approval from the FDA for the use of 11C-choline. MRI and choline PET/CT 
have been reported to have similar sensitivities in detecting bone metastasis 19. However, the 
sensitivity for lymph node detection remains low. Choline PET/CT have shown variable results 
with the detection rates ranging between 11% and 75%, largely depending on serum PSA 
levels. For PSA levels <1.0 mg/ml, the detection rates range from 5% to 44%. The main limitation is the low sensitivity for micro-metastatic disease 
20. 
A different approach is to image the prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA).  PSMA is 
expressed on the majority of prostate cancer cells . The initial imaging approach to PSMA 
imaging was to target the intracellular domain of PSMA using Indium -111-capromab 
(Prostascint), a murine monoclonal antibody  21.  Although there was early promise for the 
detection of nodal metastasis  22, the agent was never able to adequately visualize osseous 
metastasis  23.  One main limitation to Indium -111-capromab is that it takes a prolonged time to 
localize to the target tissue, which likely relates to both the size of the monoclonal antibody and 
the fact that agent targets the intracellular domain of the PSMA protein. Additionally, Prostascint 
also recognizes an intracellular epi[INVESTIGATOR_742585]. This likely only occurs in per meable dead or dying tumor cells.  
Because of the limitations of Indium -[ADDRESS_1015050] in biochemical rec urrent prostate cancer. Afshar -Oromieh et al. demonstrated  
that 68Ga-PSMA-11 has a higher sensitivity for the detection of disease than 18F -choline in a 
head-to-head intra-patient comparison that included 37 patients 24. Later the same group 
demonstrated a high sensitivity of 68Ga-PSMA -11 in the detection of metastatic lesions at the 
time of recurrent prostate cancer  25. Their results demonstrated a detection rate of 50% for 
patients with a PSA less than 1 ng/ml, and detection rate above 85% for patients with a PSA greater than 2 ng/ml. These detection rates are significantly higher than that reported by [CONTACT_742591] 
12. Newer  extensive retrospective data of more than 1600 patients further support 
these earlier data suggesting that 68Ga-PSMA is an excellent radiotracer for biochemically 
recurrent prostate cancer  with particular benefits over choline PET/CT at very low PSA level s (< 
0.5 ng/mL)  26-29. 68Ga-PSMA has also been shown in head-to -head comparisons to outperform 
conventional imaging for detection of nodal metastatic disease by a large margin 30.  
Factors influencing the probability for a positive 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT study have been evaluated 
in larger retrospective patient populations  31. These factors including the absolute level of PSA

management 28. In a recently published Australian multi -center trial including 323 patients with 
biochemical evidence of recurrent disease and equivocal conventional imaging, 68Ga-PSMA 
PET/CT changed the management of prostate cancer in 62% of cases. In this study , a 
substantial impact was documented with a significant reduction in the number of men in whom 
the site of disease recurrence was unknown and significant increases in the detection of 
presumed oligometastatic and polymetastatic disease. Compared to standard o f care 
diagnostics (including imaging), additional sites of disease were detection in 32% as local 
recurrence, 43% as nodal disease and 20% as metastatic (mostly to bone) 32. 68Ga-PSMA has a 
significantly higher sensitivity and specificity than 99mTc -bone scanning in [ADDRESS_1015052] imaging modalities. The STOMP trial is an ongoing randomized phase 
study utilizing metastases -directed therapy with either surgery or sterotactic body radiotherapy, 
with less than or equal to 3 metastases defining oligometastatic disease diagnosed on choline 
PET/CT 
37. The ORIOLE trial is also an ongoing randomized phase II study assessing the 
efficacy of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy in patients who have failed primary treatment and have developed oligometastatic disease with three or fewer bone metastases 
38.

68Ga-PSMA-11  Page 13 of 37 Based on the available data, it is evident that the full extent of metastatic disease patients with 
biochemically recurrent prostate cancer is frequently  underestimated on conventional imaging 
when compared to advanced molecular imaging techniques. Importantly, the utility of 68Ga-
PSMA PET/CT to identify such metastatic lesions earlier prior their appearance on standard 
imaging has not yet been evaluated i n the randomized setting.  
In HUM00106254, a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], w e are currently evaluating 68Ga-PSMA for the detection of 
primary prostate cancer and BCR. Examples of the potential of this excellent radiotracer for the 
identification of significant primary disease (Figure 1), and low -volume metastatic  disease are 
given in f igures 2-3.

4 Study Drugs  
4.1 Description, Supply and Storage of Investigational Drugs 
4.1.1 Investigational Drug #1 
Gallium-68 labeled PSMA-11 (or PSMA-HBED- CC) is a radiopharmaceutical that will be 
produced under cGMP  at the Cyclotron Radiochemistry of the University of Michigan as 
described in IND #133858. Inventory recordkeepi[INVESTIGATOR_29356], disposition, handling, etc. of 
the radioactive product is regulated by [CONTACT_399525]. The local regulatory body is the SHUR committee as part of the IRB process. 
4.1.2 Furosemide (optional)  
Description of furosemide (Trade name: [CONTACT_742599]) Source: [COMPANY_011] -Aventis .
 
A dose of 20 mg of furosemide (Lasix) may be injected i.v. together with, shortly before or 
after administration of the radiotracer 68Ga-PSMA in order to minimize PET scatter artifacts 
from excreted radiotracer accumulation in the kidney and urinary bladder. Patients with 
known adverse effects to furosemide may participate in the study but will not receive Furosemide IV. Potential adverse effects of furosemide include urticaria, rash, and anaphylaxis (rare). 
5 Treatment Plan 
5.1 Dosage and Administration 
The imaging agent (68Ga-PSMA-11) will be administered.   It will be administered a single time 
intravenously prior to the PET imaging.  The one-time nominal injected dose will be 3 to 7 mCi 
of 68Ga-PSMA -11. 
5.1.1 Other Modality(ies) or Procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS] Change in M anagement Surveys 
Referring clinicians will be required to fill out a pre-imaging survey prior to  imaging. Additionally , 
within [ADDRESS_1015057]-imaging physician survey, and finally six months (allowed range 3 – 12 months) after 
imaging, a third physician survey will be filled out. 
[IP_ADDRESS] PET I maging 
a) 68Ga-PSMA -11 PET preparation and injection:   
The injected dose will be 111-259 MBq (3-7 mCi) of 68Ga-PSMA -11 PET.  PET imaging 
will begin 50 -100 minutes after injection (target 75 minutes).  Scan time per bed position 
will be determined based on expected count statistics related to the administered dose. 
 
Protocol UMCC Number  2017.016                                                                                 Version date: Sept. 13, 2019  
68Ga-PSMA-11  Page 19 of 37 b) Patient preparation: no fasting is required. Participants will be asked to void prior to 
radiotracer injection.  
c) Furosemide administration: A single dose of 20 mg of furosemide (Lasix) may be 
administered i.v. together with, shortly before or after administration of the radiotracer in 
order to minimize PET scatter artifacts from excreted radiotracer accumulation in the 
kidney and urinary bladder. Furosemide should not be administered in subjects with 
medical contraindications to furosemide administration including allergies and adverse 
reactions including sulfa allergies.  
d) PET protocol: Scan coverage will extend from mid-thigh to the base of the skull, starting 
from the mid -thighs to prevent urinary bladder radiotracer accumulation at the start of 
PET imaging. Additional body parts may be included as deemed necessary based on clinical information, including information from prior diagnostic scans. Scan time per bed 
position will be determined based on expected count statistics , which is determined 
mainly by [CONTACT_742593].  Scan time will therefore be between 15 and 4 0 
minutes.  
 
e) Patient monitoring: Vital signs will be assessed immediately before and after injection of 
68Ga-PSMA -11 (HR and supi[INVESTIGATOR_30991]).  Patients will be monitored for adverse events 
during injection and for two hours after radiotracer administration.   Additionally, patient’s vitals (HR and supi[INVESTIGATOR_30991]) will be checked at the completion of the imaging study prior to 
leaving the imaging center.  
f) Results dissemination. Scan results will be shared with the subject's clinician and will be 
reported and stored in the electronic medical record.

All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of 68Ga-PSMA-11 administration. 
7.2 Evaluation of Safety 
Analyses will be performed for all patients receiving 68Ga-PSMA -11.  The study will use the 
CTCAE v4.0  for reporting of adverse events.  
7.3 Definitions of Adverse Events 
7.3.1 Adverse Event  
An adverse event (also known as an adverse experience) is defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  More specifically, an adverse event (can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., 
an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality.  An adverse event can arise from any use of the 
drug (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
7.3.2 Adverse reaction 
An adverse reaction is defined as any adverse event caused by [CONTACT_2224] a drug.  Adverse 
reactions are a subset of all suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude 
that the drug caused the event.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Suspected  
A suspected adverse reaction is defined as any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” indicates that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than an adverse reaction.  
 
Protocol UMCC Number  2017.016                                                                                 Version date: Sept. 13, 2019  
68Ga-PSMA-11  Page 22 of 37 [IP_ADDRESS] Unexpected  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered unexpected if it is not listed in 
the investigator brochure or packag e insert(s), or is not listed at the specificity or severity that 
has been observed, or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent 
with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current 
application.  
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.  
Adverse events that would be anticipated to occur as part of the disease process are 
considered unexpected for the purposes of reporting because they would not be listed in the 
investigator brochure.  For example, a certain number of non-acute deaths in a cancer trial would be anticipated as an outcome of the underlying disease, but such deaths would generally 
not be listed as a suspected advers e reaction in the investigator brochure. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious  if, in the view of either 
the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death 
• Life-threatening adverse event  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life function  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, are life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Life-threatening 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered life -threatening if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
7.4 Recording of an Adverse Event  
All grade 3 and above adverse events will be recorded using the NCI CTCAE v4.0.   The 
Investigator will assign attribution of the possible association of the event with us e of the 
investigational drug.  
 
Protocol UMCC Number  2017.016                                                                                 Version date: Sept. 13, 2019

Signs or symptoms reported as adverse events will be graded and recorded by [CONTACT_40607] .  When specific adverse events are not listed in the CTCAE they will be 
graded by [CONTACT_40608], mild, moderate or severe accordi ng to the following grades 
and definitions: 
Grade 0  No AE (or within normal limits)  
Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention (e.g., packing, cautery) 
indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)

5: Death related to AE  
7.5 Data and Safety Monitoring 
All adverse events will be followed with appropriate medical management until resolved.  
Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization of the adverse event.  For selected cases in which  the injection of the 
investigational radiotracer  was stopped (for instance partial or complete paravenous injection) , a 
repeat injection of the subject with the investigational radiotracer  may be conducted if 
considered both safe and ethical by [CONTACT_737]. 
This trial will be monitored in accordance with the NCI approved University of Michigan Rogel  
Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Plan. The study team will meet every 3  months or 
more frequently depending on the activity of the protocol. The discussion will include matters 
related to the safety of study participants (SAE/UaP reporting), validity and integrity of the data, 
enrollment rate relative to expectations, characteristics of participants, retention of participants, adherence to the protocol (potential or real protocol deviations) and data completeness. At 
these regular meetings, the protocol specific Data and Safety Monitoring Report form will be 
completed and signed by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_742587]-investigators.  
Data and Safety Monitoring Reports will be submitted to the University of Michigan Rogel  
Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Committee every 3  months for independent review.

Expedited Reporting to the Food and Drug Administration 
As the study is being conducted under an IND, the Sponsor -Investigator is responsible for 
determining whether or not the suspected adverse reaction meets the criteria for expedited reporting in accordance with Federal Regulations (21 CFR §312.32).  
The Investigator must report in an IND safety report any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected.  The Sponsor -Investigator needs to ensure that the event meets all 
three definitions:  
• Suspected adverse reaction (as defined in [IP_ADDRESS] ) 
• Unexpected (as defined in [IP_ADDRESS]) 
• Serious (as defined in [IP_ADDRESS]) 
If the adverse event does not meet all three of the definitions, it should not be submitted as an expedited IND safety report. 
The timeline for submitting an IND safety report to FDA is no later than 15 calendar days after 
the Investigator determines that the suspected adverse reaction qualifies for reporting (21 CFR 
312.32(c)(1)).  
Any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction will be reported to FDA no 
later than 7 calendar days after the Investigator’s initial receipt of the information (21 CFR 
312.32(c )(2)).  
Any relevant additional information that pertains to a previously submitted IND safety report will be submitted to FDA as a Follow-up IND Safety Report without delay, as soon as the information is available (21 CFR 312.32(d)(2)).  
8 Statistical Considerations and Evaluation of Results 
8.1 Study Endpoints 
• Per patient 68Ga-PSMA -11 positivity.  
• Histological correlation with 68Ga-PSMA -11 lesion results.  
8.1.1 Randomization 
There will be no randomization performed.  T here will be no blinding performed.  
8.2 Determination of Sample Size and Accrual Rate 
8.2.1 Sample Size and Power Estimate 
The primary endpoint is to evaluate the positive predictive value (PPV) (true positives / (true 
positives + false positives)) of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET for presence or absence of prostate cancer 
 
Protocol UMCC Number  2017.016                                                                                 Version date: Sept. 13, 2019  
68Ga-PSMA-11  Page 25 of 37 confirmed by [CONTACT_742594] a per -patient basis. It is anticipated that –  on a per -patient basis 
- the PPV of conventional imaging ranges between 30-50%. An overall PPV for 68Ga-PSMA-[ADDRESS_1015065] 50% will be considered as unacceptably low . Hence, the null hypothesis that the 
PPV is at most 50% will be tested against the alternative hypothesis that the PPV is greater 
than 50%.  
Given recently published data from 68Ga-PSMA -[ADDRESS_1015066] 75 % in our patient population.  
We previously expected that approximately 25% of the accrued patients will undergo a biopsy 
and 95% of the biopsied patients will have positive 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET scan at the biopsied site 
(about 5% of patients may receive a biopsy of a 68Ga-PSMA -11 negative site, which was 
however identified on conventional imaging). However, we were able to obtain biopsies from 
68Ga-PSMA -11 positive lesions  in only 13 of 316 evaluable subjects , and no biops ies of 68Ga-
PSMA-11 negative lesions  identified by [CONTACT_742595].  
When 750 (instead of 375) patients are accrued at the University of Michigan, we  now expect 
that about 24  patients who are to receive a biopsy will receive the biopsy of a 68Ga-PSMA-11 
positive lesion. Then, the attainable power is estimated at  80% for detecting an increase in the 
PPV from 50% to 75 % at the one-sided 0.[ADDRESS_1015067] secondary objective, the region-specific PPV will be determined (confirmed by 
[CONTACT_309820], clinical follow -up, and/or  histopathology/biopsy where available). Based 
on the results of previous studies, the following distribution of biopsied disease across the four 
regions are anticipated 1,2: 
a) Prostate bed: 30%  
b) Pelvis: 15%  
c) Extrapelvic soft tissue: 20%  
d) Bone metastases: 35%  
 
In summary, a sample size of 750 UM patients would be sufficient to achieve adequate power 
for detecting an increase in the per -patient PPV  from 50% to 75 % for the primary objective. 
Regarding the first secondary objective (region-specific PPV ), the per -region tests would have 
adequate power in the 1,500 pooled sample from all participating sites.  
 
8.3 Analyses Plans 
8.3.1 Analysis Population 
Patients with histopathology  correlates will be analyzed for the p rimary aim.  All remaining 
patients will be analyzed for the secondary endpoints.   
8.3.2 Scan Interpretations 
68Ga-PSMA -11 PET/CT images will initially be interpreted by a board certified nuclear medicine 
physician or a board-certified radiologist experienced in reading PET/CT  at the time of the 
imaging study at the institution that the study is being performed. These interpretations will be 
made available to the treating physician and will become part of the patient’s electronic record. 
These interpretations will however not be used for final evaluation.

68Ga-PSMA-11  Page 26 of 37  8.3.3 Central Data Analysis  
Anonymized coded patient information (case report forms) will be captured in a central REDCap 
database hosted at the University of [LOCATION_004] at San Francisco (UCSF).  
Anonymized and de-identified imaging data will be uploaded to a central  website hosted at the 
Clinical Trials Network (CTN). PET data will be interpreted by [CONTACT_342070] a 
random order at separate reading sessions.  Cross sectional imaging (CT) obtained with the 
68Ga PSMA -11 PET will be available as  anatomic correlate.   
Central Read Interpretation: Final reads by [CONTACT_742596] 
8.2.1 (see table).  
Reader Positivity and Negativity Definition: Regions of suspected disease will be graded on a 
two-point scale by [CONTACT_30783] (0=Negative or 1=Positive). A region will be judged as positive if 
at least one lesion in this region is visually positive. Criteria for visual interpretation is described in section 8.3.3. 
Reader Training: 
68Ga PSMA-11 PET/CT reading training set and guides will be provided and 
completion of this training will be required for all central review readers.  
Case report forms will be provided to the FDA for review, when requested. 
8.3.4 Analysis of Primary  Endpoints 
Primary endpoint: PPV on a per -patient basis of 68Ga-PSMA -11 PET for detection of prostate 
cancer confirmed by [CONTACT_742597]-sided 95% confidence intervals. The confidence intervals will be constructed 
using the Wilson score method.  
a) Imaging interpretation 68Ga-PSMA -11 PET: 
PET images will initially be interpreted by a board certified nuclear medicine physician or a board certified radiologist experienced in reading PET at the time of the imaging study at the University of Michigan. These interpretations will not be used for final evaluation. Upon request, anonymized 
68Ga-PSMA PET/CT imaging data are sent to the FDA for 
further review. 
Visual interpretation:  
Regions of suspected disease will be graded on a two-point scale by [CONTACT_30783] 
(0=Negative or 1= Positive). A region will be judged as positive if at least one lesion in 
this region is visually positive.  
i) Lymph nodes will be considered positive if the 68Ga-PSMA -11 uptake is focal and 
greater than blood pool (adjacent or mediastinal blood pool). Pelvic lymph nodes will be subclassified according to their localization as follows: R/L obturator, R/L external iliac, R/L internal iliac and other (total of 7 subgroups). 
ii) Visceral lesions will be considered positive if the 
68Ga-PSMA -11 uptake is focal 
and greater than physiologic background activity of the involvement organ or anatomic site. 
 
Protocol UMCC Number  2017.016                                                                                 Version date: Sept. 13, 2019  
68Ga-PSMA-11  Page 27 of 37  iii) Bone lesions will be considered positive if the 68Ga-PSMA -11 uptake is focal and 
greater than physiologic bone marrow. 
iv) Prostate bed and prostate lesions will be considered positive if the 68Ga-PSMA -
11 uptake is focal and greater than physiologic background activity of the 
involvement organ or anatomic site.  
b) Follow -up Imaging: 
All patients are expected to be followed up as part of clinical care within 3-12 months 
with conventional imaging (dedicated CT, MRI and/or bone scan).  Interpretation of follow -up imaging will be performed by [CONTACT_451894]. The follow -up conventional imaging 
should be the same modality/modalities as the initial staging work -up to allow 
reproducible and accurate comparisons. 
68Ga-PSMA -11 PET positive findings will be validated as true or false positive as 
outlined in more detail below. False negative 68Ga-PSMA -11 PET findings may  be 
determined based on biopsies obtained from  lesion identified on conventional imaging 
that are negative on 68Ga-PSMA-11.  
Rationale for applied response criteria:  
RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1015068] 30% as response (either partial or 
complete) , while an increase of at least 20% is considered progressive disease 42,43. The 
decline of serum PSA of 50% or more is a commonly used criterion for treatment 
response following systemic treatment of metastatic prostate cancer 44-46.  
Following the 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan, focal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_742588]. Therefore, anatomic size variations can be 
suitable endpoints  in absence of histological verification. In patients with solitary lesions, 
PSA reductions following focal treatment may indicate a true positive  scan finding even 
in absence of significant size changes. 
 
68Ga-PSMA -11 PET validation based on follow -up imaging: 
i) Lymph nodes  will be assessed by [CONTACT_92145]. 68Ga-PSMA-11 positive lymph 
nodes will be considered: 
(1) True positive:  - If on follow -up imaging within 3-[ADDRESS_1015069] or MRI 
decrease by [CONTACT_726] 30% (for patients undergoing systemic treatment of 
focal therapy at this site) or increase by [CONTACT_726] 20% in short axis diameter (with a minimum of 3 mm in change in size).  
- If patients with solitary lymph node regions show a decrease of PSA by

above false positive or true positive findings.  
c) Histopathology/Biopsy:  
i) Localization of lesions for histopathology/biopsy will be a classified according to the regions in table 1.  
ii) 
68Ga-PSMA- 11 positive findings are aimed to be confirmed by [CONTACT_26745]/biopsy 
if clinically feasible.  
iii) Histopathological procedures and biopsies will be performed as clinically indicated and as per institutional protocol.   
(1) Positive HP/Biopsy: Confirmed sites of metastatic or tumor involvement by 
[CONTACT_26745]/biopsy will be discussed with the responsible physician/surgeon.   
(2) N egative Biopsy: Patients with suspected tumor recurrence on 68Ga-PSMA -11 
PET with negative histopathology/biopsy will be handled as outlined below: 
(a) Lymph nodes: 
− For patients undergoing nodal dissection: Patients will be rescanned with 
dedicated CT or MRI to determine if the suspi[INVESTIGATOR_15665] 68Ga-PSMA-11 
positive node was removed.   
1. If 68Ga-PSMA-11 positive lymph node is still present, a repeat biopsy 
can be pursued if clinically feasible and applicable, or follow -up using 
imaging as described above will be performed. 
2. If the corresponding node was removed, then this will be considered a 
False Positive. 
− For patients undergoing needle biopsy : Images of the procedure will be 
reviewed to determine if the correct node was biopsied.   
1. If the correct node was biopsied, then a negative biopsy will be considered a False Positive.  
 
Protocol UMCC Number  2017.016                                                                                 Version date: Sept. 13, [ADDRESS_1015076] node was biopsied, then follow -up imaging as 
described above will be performed. 
(b) Bone lesions:  Given the high rate of false negative biopsies for osseous 
metastases in patients with prostate cancer, patients with negative bone 
biopsies of PSMA PET positive lesions will be further evaluated: 
− If pathology demonstrates an alternative diagnos is that is known to be 
PSMA positive (eg Renal Cell Carcinoma metastases, Paget’s disease), 
then this will be considered a False Positive.  
− If pathology is indeterminate, then follow -up imaging as described above 
will be perfo rmed to determine if the lesion is a True Positive or False 
Positive.  
− Additionally , a repeat 68Ga-PSMA -11 can also be obtained, as allowable, 
in addition to repeat conventional imaging (CT and/or MRI) in cases of 
negative biopsy to determine if the biopsy was true negative or false 
negative.  
(3) Although not routinely performed during standard practice, immunohistochemical staining for PSMA of tumor specimens (primary and lymph node metastases) may be performed, although not required. 
8.3.5 Central Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
1. PPVs on a per -patient and per -region-basis of 
68Ga-PSMA -11 PET for detection of tumor 
location confirmed by [CONTACT_26745]/biopsy and conventional imaging follow -up will be 
calculated and reported along with the corresponding two-sided 95% co nfidence 
intervals. The confidence intervals will be constructed using the Wilson score method.  
2. Sensitivity  on a per -patient and per -region basis of 68Ga-PSMA -11 PET for detection of 
tumor location confirmed by [CONTACT_26745]/biopsy will be summarized in tabular format. Ninety -five percent confi dence intervals of sensitivity and PPV will be calculated using the 
Wilson score method.  
3. Detection rates on a per -patient basis of 
68Ga-PSMA-11 PET stratified by [CONTACT_342063] (0.2 
- <0.5, 0.5 - <1.0, 1.0 - <2.0, 2.0 - <5.0, 5.0) will be summarized in tabular format and 
compared between PSA strata using chi -square analysis.  
4. The impact of 68Ga-PSMA -11 PET on clinical management in BCR patients will be 
evaluated using surveys of the treating physician or practitioner before, at 1 (2-30 days) 
and 6 (range 3  - 12) months after the 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET scan  (see data collection 
sheet, section 44 eResearch). The results will be analyzed and provided in coded form for central analysis .  
5. Safety will be reported descriptively as rates of patient reported adverse events.

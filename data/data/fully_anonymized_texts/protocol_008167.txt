Alcon – Business Use Only  [ADDRESS_1096910]: WaveLight® EX500 excimer laser system using 
InnovEyes in conjunction with InnovEyes sightmap  
Purpose and 
Rationale   Current treatment planning for LASIK treatment, such as wavefront 
optimized, wavefront guided, and topography guided is based on 
simplified formulas and a standardized eye model and does not 
consider the multiple  lens structure of the eye. InnovEyes takes the 
multi -lens nature of the eye into consideration. The purpose of this 
study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the WaveLight 
EX500 excimer laser system for the correction of myopia with and 
without  astigmatism using InnovEyes in conjunction with 
InnovEyes sightmap.  
Objective(s)  To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the WaveLight EX500 
excimer laser system for the correction of myopia with and without 
astigmatism using InnovEyes in conjunctio n with InnovEyes 
sightmap.  
Details and additional information on objectives are provided in 
Section 6. 
Endpoint(s)

Alcon – Business Use Only  Study Design  This is a prospective, single -arm, multi -center, interventional study 
with planned bilateral treatment.  
Qualified subjects will receive bilateral InnovEyes treatment and be 
followed for 1 year. Subjects will be aske d to attend a total of 
9 visits (screening, surgery, day  1, 1 week, 1 month, 3 month, 
6 month, 9 month , and 1 y ear). Total expected du ration of subject 
participation is approximately [ADDRESS_1096911] enrollment 
will be monitored to ensure inclusion of re quired numbers of 
subjects in each one diopter interval based on the ranges of 
spherical and cylindrical refractive error (bin).  
Key Inclusion 
Criteria  
(See Section 8.[ADDRESS_1096912] of 
inclusion criteria)  Subjects must meet all inclusion criteria as listed in Section 8.1   
Key Inclusion Criteria include:  
• Myopia up to and including -11.00 D with or without 
astigmatism up to -4.50 D, with  spherical equivalent  no more 
than -12.00  D as shown from InnovEyes sightmap Measured 
refraction  
• Best corrected photopic distance visual acuity of 20/20 or better 
(≤ 0.04 logMAR)  
• Uncorrected photopic distance visual acuity of 20/40 or worse 
(≥ 0.34 logMAR)  
• Stable refraction (within ± 0.50 D) as det ermined by [CONTACT_700436] 
a minimum of 12 months prior to surgery  
Key Exclusion 
Criteria  
(See Section 8.[ADDRESS_1096913] of 
exclusion  criteria)  Subjects must not meet exclusion criteria as listed in Section 8.2   
Key Exclusion Criteria include:  
• History or evidence of act ive or inactive corneal disease or 
retinal vascular disease, keratoconus or glaucoma (or suspect ) 
• Previous intraocular or corneal surgery  
• Intent to have monovision treatment  
Data Analysis and 
Sample Size 
Justification  The safety analysis set (SAF) will contain all eyes that undergo 
surgery or attempted surgery  (defined as eye drops given for flap 
treatment) ; the SAF will be the primary analysis set for the safety

V-CLN -0000116  Status: Approved , Version: 3.0 
Approved Date: 09 Jun 2021  Page 15 of 79 
 
Alcon – Business Use Only  analyses . The full analysis set (FAS) will contain all ey es that 
successfully undergo surgery; the FAS will be the primary analysis 
set for the effectiveness analyses. The consistent cohort (CC) will 
contain all eyes in the FAS that have manifest refraction data at all 
post-operative visits. The CC will be the p rimary analysis set for the 
refractive stability analyses.  
Refractive stability is said to have been achieved at the latter of two 
postoperative manifest refractions performed at least 3 months apart 
(or at 3 months after surgery when compared with the 1 -month 
visit) if all the requirements for stability listed in the endpoints 
section of the synopsis have been met . Stability will be confirmed 
by [CONTACT_795179] (at least 80% of the cohort) at the next 
scheduled visit interval.  
The number and percentag e of eyes meeting each of the primary 
effectiveness endpoints will be calculated. The effectiveness criteria 
will be considered to have been met if the percentage meets or 
exceeds the target rate at the time of refractive stability for all 
primary effectiv eness endpoints.  
The number and percentage of eyes experiencing each o f the 
primary safety endpoints will also be calculated. The safety criteria 
will be considered to have been met if the percentage is less than 
the target rate at the time of refractive s tability for all of the primary 
safety endpoints.  
An analysis will be performed once refractive stability is achieved; 
a final analysis will be performed once the one -year follow -up is 
complete.

Alcon – Business Use Only  [ADDRESS_1096916] possible visual 
performance. Accurate methods of calculation are required to achieve satisfactory surgical 
outcomes. In order to improve the clinical outcome from LASIK treatment, a new treatment 
option named “InnovEyes ” has been developed. Current treatment planni ng for LASIK 
procedures, such as wavefront optimized, wavefront guided and topography guided is based 
on simplified formulas and a standardized eye model and does not consider the multiple lens 
structure of the eye. The InnovEyes software for the WaveLight  EX500 uses a new, 
computer -based method to calculate ablation profiles based on a r ay tracing algorithm and 
also takes the multi -lens nature of the eye into consideration.  For the InnovEyes procedure, 
the model data of the eye are replaced by [CONTACT_795180] ’s eye such as topography, aberrometry, wavefront , and eye length. By 
[CONTACT_795181], a patient -specific ablation profile is then generated from the calculated 
individual eye model based on an it erative “Ray Tracing” calculation. By [CONTACT_795182], such as the back and front surfaces of the cornea and the 
crystalline lens , as well as the corresponding distances in the eye model, r ay tracing offers 
currently the highest  possible accuracy to improve the refractive predictability of corneal 
laser surgery (Simon 2011).  
An initial clinical trial in which the r ay tracing algorithm was used was conducted by 
[CONTACT_795183] 2009 -2010. The purpose of the study was to assess th e efficacy, safety, 
and predictability of an individualized laser -assisted  in situ  keratomileusis (LASIK) ablation 
profile based on an optical r ay tracing algorithm to treat  moderate to high myopic 
astigmatism  (Schumacher 2012). For this initial R ay tracing (now called InnovEyes) 
treatment, calculation was performed with a Mathlab program installed on a separate 
computer and treatment was implemented by [CONTACT_795184]. In 
addition, in this initial clinical trial, the diagnost ic data were collected from three different 
WaveLight diagnostic devices. This trial provided evidence of the safety, efficacy, and 
predictability of laser -assisted  in situ keratomileusis outcomes using an optical ray tracing 
algorithm to treat moderate to  high myopic astigmatism and shows that good results are 
sustained through 1 year (Cummings 2013).

Alcon – Business Use Only  Since the past study using the InnovEyes software and r ay tracing algorithm was completed, 
a new diagnostic device named “InnovEyes ™ sightmap ” has been dev eloped. Historically 
needed data for LASIK treatment has been gathered from different diagnostic devices, but for 
improved usability and a defined common coordinate system, the InnovEyes sightmap 
combines the necessary measurements for InnovEyes treatment within one device.   
The InnovEyes sightmap is designed to perform measurements (Scheimpflug Camera 
principle, Hartmann -Shack principle, and interferometry) which includes the cornea, pupil, 
anterior chamber, lens, and length of the eye. Furthermore , it provides the axial dimensions of 
the eye. It is also indicated to analyze the optical aberrations of the eye by [CONTACT_795185].  
In detail, the InnovEyes sightmap provides data to evaluate the:  
• Corneal shape including corneal thickness, anterior , and posterior corneal surface  
• Anterior chamber angle, depth , and volume  
• White -to-white distance  
• Pupil diameter  
• Conditions of the lens (e g, opaque crystalline lens)  
• Location of cataracts (e g, nuclear, sub -capsular , and/or cortical)  
• Axial length  
• Optical aber rations of the eye  
This device has been developed for ophthalmic diagnosis and for use in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], in eye 
doctor medical practices and at optometrists/opticians. The examination data get stored 
electronically and can be exported and used in combination w ith the WaveLight GmbH laser 
systems ( ie, EX500) to perform InnovEyes treatment for qualified subjects.  
5.2 Purpose of the Study  
The purpose of this clinical study is to determine the  safety and effectiveness of the 
WaveLight EX500 excimer laser system for the correction of myopia with and without 
astigmatism using InnovEyes in conjunction with InnovEyes sightmap.  
At the end of the study, a clinical study report will be prepared in acc ordance with applicable 
regulatory requirements and standards.

marketing after approval or clearance for marketing.  
5.3 Risks and Benefits  
As with any refractive surgic al procedure or diagnostic device, there are potentials risks with 
the use of the InnovEyes sightmap and InnovEyes treatment. However, there are no 
additional warnings or precautions associated with these outside of the risks identified for the 
use of othe r similar diagnostic devices or other LASIK procedures  performed on the EX500 . 
There may also be unknown risks to use of the InnovEyes sightmap and InnovEyes treatment. 
Any risk to subjects in this clinical study will be minimized by [CONTACT_795186], clinical oversight , and monitoring.  
The medical benefit of the InnovEye s sightmap is in its collection of diagnostic data and data 
of the  optical properties of the whole eye  in order to facilitate treatment planning  for 
refractive surgery . The diagnostic data may be used to screen out patients that are not eligible 
for surgery or for planning treatment with the intent of improving outcomes with InnovEyes 
LASIK.  
The medical benefit of the InnovEyes software is in the  accuracy of determining an 
individual eye ’s ablation profile.  
More information on summary of the literature, description of the investigational device, 
guidance for the Investigator , as well as known and potential risks and benefits can be found 
in the I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB) [IB -0171] Investigator Brochure for InnovEyes and 
InnovEyes sightmap and the InnovEyes sightmap user manual.

7 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1 Study Design  
This is a prospective, single -arm, multi -center, interventional study with planned bilateral 
InnovEyes LASIK treatment for subjects requiring refractive correction of myopia with or 
without astigmatism. All treated e yes will be targeted for emmetropia. The postoperative state 
of each treated eye will be compared to the preoperative state of the same eye.  
Subjects will be evaluated initially for suitability as candidates for bilateral LASIK. Potential 
subjects willing  to participate will be consented and screened. Approximately 187 qualified 
subjects (up to 374 eyes) will receive bilateral InnovEyes LASIK  and be followed for [ADDRESS_1096920] participation is approximately 1 year and includes 9 study vi sits 
consisting of Screening, Surgery, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 month, 6 months, 9 months, and

Alcon – Business Use Only  [ADDRESS_1096921] 20 eyes in each spherical 
diopter and each cylindrical diopter range (with only [ADDRESS_1096922] cylinder bin). 
Approximately 10 US study sites will participate in this clinical study. It is estimated that 
enrollment and follow -up of all subjects will take approximately 22 months. Additional 
information on the study population can be found i n Section 8. 
Assessments will be obtained at base line an d at appropriate times after  InnovEyes LASIK  to 
evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the treatment.  
 
 
 
  
The main analyses  for effectiveness and safety will be conducted when refractive stability for 
the cohort has been determined and 80% of the eye s in the cohort have comple ted the next 
scheduled visit after refractive stability (Refractive Stability is defined in Section 6.4 and 
12.4). The Sponsor may file a Pre -Market Approval application once this analysis is 
complete.  Subjects are followed for a t least 12 months (Day 330 to Day 420 ) for safety and 
supportive effectiveness assessments. Final data analyses will be  conducted at study  
completion . 
7.2 Rationale for Study Design  
The prospective , single group study design, objectives, planned visits and assessments, and 
planned analysis at refractive stability are based on recommendations by [CONTACT_454206] Z80.11 -
2012(R2017) (American National Standard for Ophthalmics – Laser Systems for Corneal 
Reshapi[INVESTIGATOR_007], approved August 9, 2012 and Reaffirmed December 11, 2017) and IS O 
[ZIP_CODE]:2011.  
The study population includes subjects with myopia, with or without astigmatism, based on 
this being a prevalent refractive error for LASIK treatments today and the intended 
population for InnovEyes LASIK . 
Bilateral treatments of subjects will be implemented in this study based on past clinical study 
results that provide initial safety, effectiveness, and stability data (Schumacher 2012; 
Cummings 2013).

Adaptations  
Analysis  will occur for review of refractive stability as specified by [CONTACT_454206] Z80.11 -
2012(R2017), which includes [ADDRESS_1096923] 80% of 
the cohort.   
No changes to study design, after the initiation of the study, are planned.  
7.3 Rationale for Duration of Treatment/Follow -Up 
One year follow -up (Day 330 to 420) of subjects will be implemented in this study based on past 
clinical study results using the r ay tracing algorithm tha t provided initial safety, effectiveness, 
and stability data through one year follow -up. (Schumacher 2012; Cummings 2013).  
7.[ADDRESS_1096924] myopia up to -11.00 D with or without 
astigmatism up to -4.50 D. This study is aimed to enroll (consent) approximately  374 subjects 
at up to 10 sites in the [LOCATION_002] with a target of up to  374 eyes treated. Because about 
50% screening failure rate and up to 10% lost to follow -up rate is expected, these numbers 
will allow for treatment and follow -up of at least  300 eyes  and account for overlap or over -
enrollment in certain ranges to achieve the  required number of 20 eyes per diopter over the 
intended refractive range . Allocation of study bins will be closely monitored through the use 
of listings generated from the InnovEyes sightmap Measured  refraction entered in EDC.   
Investigative sites will be trained on the importance of timely entry of data in EDC to ensure 
enrollment bin allocation is up to date.  When enrollment in a refractive bin is complete, sites 
will be instructed to refrain from enrolling eyes in that bin.  Site-specific targets may vary 
based upon individual site capabilities, but each site is expected to treat a minimum of 20 
eyes and no more than 92 eyes per site.   
Enrollment will be monitored to aim for 20 or more eyes treated and followed to refractive  
stability in each diopter interval based on the ranges of spherical and cylindrical refractive 
error (bin). Therefore at least 220 eyes will be treated for the sphere range (20 eyes/diopter 
interval of 0 to -11.00) and at least 110 eyes will be treated fo r the cylinder range (20 eyes for 
0 to ≤ -0.50 and > -0.50 to ≤ -1.00 cylinder and 20 eyes/diopter fo r intervals from > -1.00 to

inclusion/exclusion criteria re -verified  to ensure the subject still qualifies to proceed with 
study surgery.  
Criteria not met:  Rescreening of subjects who did not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria is 
allowed one time per subject. R escreening is allowed only if criteria previously not met could 
reasonably have changed since the prior screening. Criteria that could change and rescreening 
would be allowed include: Inclusion 3, 6, or if changes in refractive stability or receipt of 
additional past records can show stability for criteria 7 – 10. 
NOTE:  IF a subject is rescreened, THEN use the same subject number. Update the screening 
data in EDC with date and results of the rescreening. Keep the original consent date captured 
in EDC. Docum ent the rescreening, and keep results from both screening visits in the

• “Have th ere been any changes in the medicines you take since your last study visit? ” 
In addition, changes in any protocol -specific parameters evaluated 
during the study are to be reviewed by [CONTACT_737]. Any untoward (unfavorable and 
unintended) change in a protocol -specific parameter  that is 
clinically relevant, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], is to be reporte d as an AE. These 
clinically relevant changes will be reported regardless of causality.  
11.3 Procedures for Recording and Reporting  
AEs are collected from the time of informed consent .  Any pre -existing medical conditions or 
signs/symptoms present in a subject  prior to the start of the study (ie , before informed consent 
is signed) are not considered AEs in the study and should be recorded in the Medi cal History 
section of the eCRF.  
In addition, dry eye, superficial punctate keratitis, and  optical visual disturb ances (e g, glare, 
halo, and starburst) are examples of early post -operative findings that are typi[INVESTIGATOR_700426] -refractive surgery. These are not considered AEs if they can be reasonably 
expected to resolve within [ADDRESS_1096952]. However, based on the Investigator ’s medical judgment, signs and symptoms of dry 
eye and ocular visual disturbances prior to [ADDRESS_1096953] include: date of 
occurrence, severity, treatment (if applicable), outcome, and assessments of the seriousness 
and causality. In addition, the Investigator must document all device  deficiencies reported or 
observed with test and control products on the Device Deficiency eCRF. The site must submit 
all available information on ADEs, SAEs, and device deficiencies to the Study Sponsor 
immediately as follows:  
• ADEs or SAEs  are documented on the Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device 
Effect eCRF within 24 hours of the Investigator ’s or site ’s awareness .

• Additional relevant information after initial reporting must be entered into the eCRF as 
soon as the data become avai lable.   
• Document any changes to concomitant medications on the appropriate eCRFs.  
• Document all relevant information from Discharge Summary, Autopsy Report,  
Certificate of Death, etc, if applicable, in narrative section of the Serious Adverse 
Event  and Adverse Device Effect eCRF.  
Note:  Should the EDC system become non -operational, the site must complete the 
appropriate paper Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device Effect  and/or Device 
Deficienc y Form. The completed form is emailed to the Study Sponsor at 
[EMAIL_13383]  according to the timelines outlined above; however, the 
reported information must be entered into the EDC system once it becomes 
operational.  
Any AEs and device deficiencies for non -study market ed devices/products (eg, FS200, 
Custom Paks, etc.) will be considered and processed as spontaneous (following the post -
market vigilance procedures) and should be  communicated to the device ’s/product ’s 
manufacturer  as per local requirements.  
Study Sponsor representatives may be contact[CONTACT_700443].  
Further, depending upon the nature of the AE or device deficiency being reported, the Study 
Sponsor may reques t copi[INVESTIGATOR_13271] ’s medical records. The 
Investiga tor must also report all AEs and device deficiencies that could have led to a SADE 
according to the requirements of regulatory authorities or IRB/IEC.  
Intensity and Causality As sessments  
Where appropriate, the Investigator must assess the intensity (severi ty) of the AE based on 
medical judgment with consideration of any subjective symptom(s), as defined below:

Approved Date: 09 Jun 2021  Page 67 of 79 
 
Alcon – Business Use Only  Intensity (Severity)  
Mild  An AE is mild if the subject is aware of but  can easily tolerate the sign or 
symptom.  
Moderate  An AE is moderate if the sig n or symptom results in discomfort significant 
enough to cause interference with the subject ’s usual activities.  
Severe  An AE is severe if the sign or symptom is incapacitating and results in the 
subject ’s inability to work or engage in their usual activities.  
For every AE in the study, the Investigator must assess the causality (Related or Not Related 
to the medical device or study procedure). An assessment of causality will als o be performed 
by [CONTACT_271456], as shown below:  
Causality  
Related  An AE classified as related may be either definitely related or possibly related 
where a direct cause and effect relationship with the medical device or study  
procedure has not been demonstrated, but there is a reasonable possibility that 
the AE was caused by [CONTACT_443411].  
Not Related  An AE classified as not related may either be definitely unrelated or simply 
unlikely to be related (i e, there are other more likely causes for the AE).  
The Study Sponsor will assess the AEs and may upgrade the Investigator ’s assessment of 
seriousness and/or causality. The Study Sponsor will notify the Investigator of any AEs that is 
upgraded from non -serious to serious or from unrelated to related.  
Furthermore,  the Study Sponsor shall promptly conduct an evaluation of any unanticipated 
adverse device effect, including anticipated adverse events that occur in unanticipated 
severity or frequency. The results of this evaluation will be reported to the FDA, the IRB,  and 
participating Investigators within [ADDRESS_1096954] information are provided in the MOP that

11.6 Follow -Up of Subjects with Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for adequate and safe medical care of subjects during the 
study and for ensuring that appropriate medical care an d relevant follow -up procedures are 
maintained after the study.  
The Investigator should provide the Study Sponsor with any new safety information (which 
includes new AEs and changes to previously reported AEs) that may affect the safety 
evaluation of the device. For AEs that are unresolved/ ongoing at time of subject exit from 
study, any additional information received at follow -up should be documented in the eCRFs 
up to study completion (ie, database lock).  
Any additional data received up to [ADDRESS_1096955] be 
documented and available upon the Study Sponsor ’s request. All complaints received after 
this time period will be considered and processed as spontaneous (following the post -market 
vigilance procedures) and should  be communicated to the medical device ’s manufacturer as

• Mean overall change and change per month in MRSE between consecutive scheduled 
visits as determined by a paired analysis;  
• Mean ± SD MR SE for the preoperative and each postoperative visit;  
• Assessment of cylinder stability for correction of spherocylindrical refractive errors  
Refractive stability is achieved at the latter of two postoperative manifest refractions 
performed at least 3 month s apart or at 3 months after surgery when compared with the 1 -
month interval, when all of the following recommended criteria are met:  
• At least 95% of the treated eyes have a change ≤ 1.00 D of MRSE between the 2 
refractions;  
• The mean rate of change in MRSE , as determined by a paired analysis, is ≤ 0.5 D per 
year (0.04 D/month) over the same time period;  
• The mean rate of change of MRSE decreases monotonically over time, with a 
projected asymptote of zero or a rate of change attributable to normal aging;  
• The 95% confidence interval for the mean rate of change in MRSE includes zero or a 
rate of change attributable to normal aging; and  
• Stability is confirmed at least 3 months after the stability time point by a statistically  
adequate  subgroup (at least 80% of t he cohort).  
The primary safety and effectiveness endpoints for the study can only be evaluated once 
refractive stability has been established within the CC , as well as on the eyes that had 2 
consecutive exams, but not necessarily every follow -up exam.

Alcon – Business Use Only  • Percentage of eyes with UCDV A of 20/40 (in eyes with preoperative BCDV A of 20/20 
or better) or better at refractive stability (Target: ≥ 85%)  
• Percentage of eyes with MRSE within 0.50 D at refractive  stability (Target: ≥ 50%)  
• Percentage of eyes with MRSE within 1.00 D at refractive stability (Target: ≥ 75%)  
• Percentage of eyes that achieve refractive stability (Target: ≥ 95%)  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Statistical Hypotheses  
No hypothesis testing of the primary effectiveness end points is planned.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis Methods  
The FAS  will be used for this analysis . The number and percentage of eyes meeting each of 
the primary effectiveness endpoints will be calculated. The effectiveness criteria will be 
considered to have been met if the perc entage meets or exceeds the target rate at the time of 
refractive stability for all primary effectiveness endpoints.  These analyses will be performed 
for the whole FAS . An analysis will be 
performed once  refractive stability is achieved; a final summary of these endpoints  will be 
performed once the one year follow -up is complete.

12.7.1  Analysis of Primary Safety Endpoints  
In order to establish safety of the WaveLight EX500 excimer laser system for the correction 
of myopia with and without astigmatism using InnovEyes in conjunction with InnovEyes 
sightmap, the following four co -primary endpoints are defined:   
• Percentage of eyes that lose 2 lines or more of BCDV A (Target at refractive stability  
≤ 5%) 
• Percentage of eyes with BCDVA worse than 20/40 (for eyes with BCDVA of 20/20 or 
better pre -op) (Target at refractive stability ≤ 1%) 
• Percentage of eyes that have an increase of manifest refractive astigmatism of greater 
than 2.00 D of absolute cylinder as compared to the preopera tive refraction (Target at 
refractive stability ≤ 5%) 
• Percentage of eyes with a serious, non -flap related, ocular adverse event at the 
postoperative visits (Target  per event type  at refractive stability: ≤ 1%)  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Statistical Hypotheses  
No hypothesis testing o f the primary safety endpoints is planned.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis Methods  
The SAF will be used for this analysis.  The number and percentage of eyes experiencing 
each of the primary safety endpoints will also be calculated. The safety criteria will be 
considered to have  been met if the percentage is less than the target rate at the time of 
refractive stability for all of the primary safety endpoints.

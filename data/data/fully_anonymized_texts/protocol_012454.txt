Protocol Number:  MTI-103 
Sponsor:  Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  
Development Phase:  Phase 2 
Study Objectives:  Primary objective : To assess the efficacy of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_246997] a history of atopic dermatitis.  
Secondary objectives:  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of repeated oral doses of 
serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_246998] a history of atopic dermatitis . 
• To assess the psychometric properties of Worst -Itch Numeric Rating 
Scale ( WI-NRS ). 
Study Design:  This is a double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled study to assess the 
efficacy, safety, and tolerability of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_246999] a history of atopic dermatitis. Subjects who meet the 
study entry criteria will be randomized in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_300482] of three periods, for a total study period of approximately 
12 weeks:  
• Screening period: 2 weeks  
• Treatment period: 6 weeks  
• Follow -up period: [ADDRESS_300483] be willing and 
able to complete an electronic diary (eDiary) within a consistent timeframe on a 
daily basis , to wear actigraphy devices during sleep,  and to comply with 
restrictions on allowable concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_82482].  
At the baseline visit, eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive 
serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 1 mg, serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 5 mg, or placebo. Subjects w ill take a loading dose 
(3 tablets taken orally) at bedtime on the first day of the treatment period (Study 
Day 1). Starting on Study Day 2, subjects will take one tablet per day taken 
orally at bedtime. Subjects will be instructed to take all doses at approximately 
the same time each day and no sooner than [ADDRESS_300484] an Early Treatment Discontinuation  (ETD) visit 
within [ADDRESS_300485] dose of study drug in addition to a follow -up visit .

adverse events (SAEs)  
• Change in c linical laboratory parameters follo wing study drug exposure  
• Changes in vital sign and electrocardiogram ( ECG ) parameters  
following study drug exposure  
• Plasma concentrations of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_247006]:  Exploratory endpoints include the following : 
• Change in Investigators’ Global Assessment of atopic dermatitis  
severity  (IGA -AD) 
• Change in s leep efficiency

Decision Rule and 
Sample Size  A stepdown procedure will be used to control for multiplicity of dose groups 
with testing starting with the 5  mg group and then proceeding to the 1  mg group.  
A gatekeeper procedure within dosing group will be used for the key secondary 
endpoints.  
The sample size of 150 per group has been selected to achieve 90% power for 
the pairwise tests  with a 5% one -sided alpha level  assuming a treatment effect 
(placebo  change from baseline  - serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_247007]) of -[ADDRESS_300494] deviation of 2.9. 
Statistical Methods:  Efficacy analyses will be based upon an intent -to-treat philosophy.  The primary 
efficacy population will be the Full Analysis Set (FAS) that will include all 
randomized and treated subjects.  Subjects will be analyzed within the treatment 
group to which they are randomized.  
Efficacy Analyses:  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be tested using an analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) model controlling for the stratification factors. A main effects model 
with an interaction term (treatment b y stratification factors) and a Type II 
hypothesis will be used. Missing data imputation will be used for subjects who 
fail to complete the eDiary at Week 6 or receive excluded therapy.  The primary 
endpoint will be summarized with descriptive statistics by  [CONTACT_247059] . These summary statistics will include estimates of the treatment 
differences and associated confidence interval.  
Testing , using an analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) model  or Cochran Mantel 
Haenszel (CMH)  test of the key seconda ry endpoints will also be employed.  
Safety Analyses:  
The incidence of all adverse events ( AEs) and treatment -related AEs will be 
tabulated by [CONTACT_82153]. These AEs will be classified by [CONTACT_247060] 
(MedDRA). For incidence reporting, if a subject reported more t han one AE that 
was coded to the same system organ class or preferred term, the subject will be 
counted only once for that specific system organ class or preferred term. An 
overview of AEs, which includes subject incidence of AEs, treatment -related 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -[ADDRESS_300495] -baseline assessment will be summarized. Shifts from baseline 
laboratory values will be tabulated. 
The observed vital signs and ECG data and change from baseline for each 
measurement day will be summarized with descriptive statistics.  
Study Sites:  Approximately 40 study sites 
Planned Dates of Study:  Oct 2016- Dec [ADDRESS_300496]’s Participation  Approximately 12 weeks: 2 weeks of screening, 6 weeks of treatment, and a 
follow -up period of 4 weeks.  
 
This study will be conducted in accordance with the Guidelines of Good Clinical Practices (GCPs).

Version 3.0  Page 15 1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Atopic D ermatitis  and Pruritus  
Atopic dermatitis (AD, atopic eczema, eczema) is an inflammatory, chronically relapsing and 
intensely pruritic skin disease occurring often in families with atopic diseases (AD, asthma, 
and/or allergic rhinoconjunctivitis) .3 It is frequently referred to as “the itch that rashes ,”4 
highlighting the central role that pruritus plays in AD pathology. Pruritus is the “cardinal 
symptom” in AD5 and it has been characterized as the “ most distressing ” symptom of AD.6 
Mollanazar et al7 describe a prevalence of 58%-91 % of c hronic pruritus in patients with AD. 
Overall, pruritus is responsible for much of the disease burden borne by [CONTACT_247061] .1 
1.2 Substance P and the Neurokinin- 1 Receptor  
The itch/scratch cycle is a hallmark of atopic dermatitis  and is a major factor in perpetuating 
the disease.6 The itch in atopic dermatitis  often begins without visible lesions8,9  and has been 
shown to involve altered sensory responses to exogenous and endogenous stimuli10,11 as well 
as modifications in sensory innervation of involved skin, including increased density of 
substance P -positive nerve fibers .12  
Substance P  (SP) is an undecapeptide that belongs to the tachykinin family of neuropeptides, 
a group that also includes neurokinin A and neurokinin B.[ADDRESS_300501] 
been identified: the neurokinin-1, neurokinin-2, and neurokinin-3 receptors.20 The 
neurokinin-1 receptor ( NK 1-R) in particular has been studied in great detail. NK 1-R is the 
primary receptor for SP in the human body, and is found on multiple ce ll types, include 
central and peripheral neurons, keratinocytes, and mast cells.  
NK 1-R stimulation  has been shown to be an important pathway for pruritus  perception .[ADDRESS_300502] (aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], 
Emend) has been used as a therapy to decrease pruritus in patients  with chronic pruritus due 
to etiologies such as cutaneous T- cell lymphoma23,24,25 and erlotinib-induced pruritus .26,27 
Additionally, in a study of 20 patients  with chronic pruritus of various etiologies treated with 
aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] , 16/20 patients  (80%) experienced a considerable reduction of itch intensity .[ADDRESS_300503] that is administered orally 
and metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4, with a plasma half- life of 70 -80 hours. It binds with high 
affinity to the human NK 1-R with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 46 pM; displacing SP 
binding with a half- maximal inhibition conce ntration (IC 50) of [ADDRESS_300504] been 
well tolerated in healthy young males , and a single (loading) dose of [ADDRESS_300505] been well tolerated in elderly males and females.  Forty-one 
(41) subjects received 4 mg liquid filled capsule (LFC) daily (bioequivalent to 5 mg tablets) for 
1 year. Plasma concentrations  of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_247008] r to increas e in a dose-proportional 
fashion in both young males  and elderly  subjects ( males and females ). Peak plasma 
concentrations after  a single  oral dose occurred  at ~2 to 4 hours in both young and elder ly 
subjects . 
In the Phase 1 studies, no drug- related serious adverse events  (SAE s) were observed . The 
most commonly reported adverse events (AEs) in subjects who received serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_247009] 1 studies w ere headache (15%), diarrhea (5%), dizziness (5%), drowsiness (4%), 
nausea (4%), somnolence (3%), abdominal discomfort (3%), loose stools (3%), cough (3%), 
cold (3%) sore throat (3%) and tiredness (2%). Laboratory abnormalities noted were transient 
microsc opic hematuria (4%) and mild transient elevation of liver function tests (2 to < 3 fold 
increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (2%).  
In a Phase 2 study examining treatment of overactive bladder (Study P003), the most 
common clinical AEs across all treatment groups were headache (5.7%), diarrhea (5.2%), 
urinary tract infection (4.7%), dry mouth (4.5%), nasopharyngitis (4.5%), upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_19629] (4.3%), fatigue (4.1%), dizziness (3.8%), back pain (2.9%), nausea (2.3%), 
and peripheral edema (2.2%). 
1.3.2 Serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_247010] a Phase 2 study of subjects  with chronic pruritus 
(TCP -101). A Phase 2 study in subjects  with prurigo nodularis (TCP-102) has been 
conducted i n [LOCATION_013] ; the clinical study report is under preparation. 
TCP-101 
Study design: a total of 257 adult subjects  18-65 years of age with chronic pruritus were 
randomized to receive one of 4 dose groups: placebo (64 subjects), serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 0.25 mg 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -103  
Version 3.0  Page 17 (64 subjects ), serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 1 mg (65 subjects), and serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 5 mg (64 subjects ). Subjects  
received a loading dose of 3 tablets on Day 1 and thereafter received 1 tablet per day for 
6 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was itch severity as measured on a visual anal og 
scale (VAS), summarized as a percentage change from baseline.  
Efficacy results: The mean percent decreases from baseline VAS scores were larger in the 
active-treatment groups versus placebo at every scheduled post- baseline study visit. The 
largest pairwise differences of least squares means versus placebo occurred in the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 
1 mg group (p -value < 0.05 at study Weeks 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10). Similar  results were seen in  
the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] [ADDRESS_300506] squares mean differences versus placeb o 
(p-value < 0.05 at study Weeks 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10).  
Safety results: Treatment -emergent adverse event s (TEAEs) were reported in 25.4% of 
subjects in the placebo group and in 31.3%, 36.9%, and 37.5% of subjects in the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 
0.25 mg, 1 mg, and 5 mg groups, respectively. “Infections and Infestations” was the system 
organ class ( SOC ) with the highest incidence of TEAEs.  
Overall, headache was the most commonly -reported TEAE, reported in 6.3% of subjects in 
the placebo group and in 1.6%, 4.6%, and 1.6% of subjects in the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 0.[ADDRESS_300507] 
overall incidence in the active-treatment groups. Somnolence was reported in 1.6% of 
subjects in the placebo group and in 1.6%, 4.6%, and 4.7% of s ubjects in the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 
0.25 mg, 1 mg, and 5 mg groups, respectively. Diarrhea occurred in 1.6% of subjects in the 
placebo group and in 0%, 6.2%, and 3.1% of subjects in the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 0.[ADDRESS_300508] of the TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. Two severe TEAEs were reported: 
hypothyroidism in [ADDRESS_300509] in the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 5 mg group. Both of thes e events were considered not related to 
study treatment.  
Treatment -related TEAEs were reported in 7.9% of subjects in the placebo group and in 
10.9%, 13.8%, and 12.5% of subjects in the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 0.25 mg, 1 mg, and 5 mg groups, 
respectively. “Nervous systems disorders” was the SOC with the highest incidence of 
treatment -related events.  
One SAE (spontaneous abortion) occurred in a subject in the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_247011]. This event 
was considered not related to study treatment. Six  subjects (3 in the placebo group, 1 in the 
serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 1 mg group, and 2 in the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 5 mg group) discontinued the study as a result 
of a TEAE. Two of these subjects had events considered not related to study treatment 
(pruritus in 2 subjects) and 3 subjects had events considere d to be treatment related 
(headache in [ADDRESS_300510]; diarrhea in [ADDRESS_300511]; and symptoms of a panic attack in [ADDRESS_300512]).  
There was no evidence of meaningful trends in laboratory abnormalities or changes in vital 
signs. Two subjects had a clinically signific ant change in an electrocardiogram ( ECG ). One  
subject in the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 0.[ADDRESS_300513] degree AV block at screening, Visit 4 and Visit 
6. Although the ECG interpretation was the same at each time point, the investigator 
considered the on- study findings clinically significant. No treatment was required.  
These results, together with the extensive safety experience with serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_247012], the 
scientific rationale for neurokinin-1 receptor ( NK 1-R) inhibition in the treatment of pruritus , 
and the previously published human data with aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], serve to support the evaluation of 
serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_247013].

6 STUDY SCHEDULE AND ASSESSM ENTS   
6.1 Efficacy Parameters  
6.1.1 Itch Numeric Rating Scale  
The Itch NRS  is a validated, self -reported instrument for measurement of itch intensity. It 
uses a 24-hour recall period and asks subjects  to rate the intensity of their itch on an 11-point 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -103  
Version 3.0  Page 29 scale ranging from 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst itch imaginable). Higher scores indicate greater 
itch intensity. In this study, both worst itch intensity (WI- NRS) and average itch intensity 
(AI-NRS) during a 24-hour recall period will be captured. Subjects will record their Itch 
NRS scores once daily via eDiary throughout the screening, treatment, and follow-up 
periods, as outlined in Appendix A . 
6.1.[ADDRESS_300534] is asked to rate the 
severity of his/her itchiness in the past [ADDRESS_300535] will rate the change in his/her itch severity on a 7-point 
scale from (very much better) to (very much worse). PGIC scores will be captured via eDiary 
as outlined in Appendix A . 
6.1.4 ItchyQoL  
ItchyQoL is a validated, pruritus- specific instrument that measures the degree to which 
pruritus affects quality  of life (Q oL).[ADDRESS_300536] is quantified into 3 subscores (symptom, 
function, emotion) and an overall score. A higher score corresponds to a more adverse impact 
on Qo L. Subjects will complete ItchyQoL  as outlined in Appendix A . 
6.1.[ADDRESS_300537] . 
The device weighs 16g (0.56oz) without the strap, and is made of medical device grade 
housing material. The device is water resistant up to [ADDRESS_300538]-tight, and drop- resistant 
to 0.5m. It is functional for operation be tween 41 and 104 degrees Fahrenh eit (5 and 
40 degrees Celsius ). 
The assessment requires each subject to wear the actigraphy devices, which are the size of a 
medium size wrist watch, on each wrist during sleep , with the option to wear them  during 
waking hours as well . The devices will be programmed and activated prior to being provided 
to subjects. Once received, the subjects can simply put the devices on their wrists and they 
will record  automatically . The devices are returned to the study site where the data are 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -103  
Version 3.0  Page 30 downloaded and sent for a nalysis.  Subjects will be permitted to not wear the devices  up to 
three sleep sessions over any seven -day period throughout the study, to allow for cases of 
temporary irritation or discomfort.  
The 3 -D acceleration data (m/sec2) from the actigraphy device i s analyzed with a neural 
network that was developed to discriminate scratching from other nighttime events. The 
algorithm was developed and tested in a study of 24 subjects (6 healthy, 18 with atopic 
dermatitis) who were video recorded for one night in a s leep lab while wearing actigraphy 
devices on each wrist. The video recordings were scored to quantify the time and duration of 
each scratching event. A strong correlation  was shown  (r = 0.98) between the number of 
scratching events per hour measured with t he actigraphy analysis versus the video scoring. In 
contrast, subjective questionnaires completed by [CONTACT_247064] a 
poor correlation with the true number of scratching events. For example, the best correlation 
was 0.6 with a VAS . The full description of the algorithm and the study has been submitted 
to IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics .30  
Actigraphy measurements will be assessed as outlined in Appendix A . 
6.1.7 Investigator s’ Global Assessment of Atopic D ermatitis  Severity  
The IGA -AD is an instrument used to assess the overall severity of atopic dermatitis  at a 
given time point, as determined by [CONTACT_093]. It consists of a 6-point scale ranging 
from 0 (clear) to 5 (very severe). The IGA -AD uses clinical characteristics of erythema, 
infiltration, papulation, oozing and crusting as guidelines for the overall severity 
assessment .[ADDRESS_300539] of monitoring and recording protocol-defined AEs and SAEs; 
vital signs; physical examinations; clinical laboratory assessments; ECGs ; pharmacokinetics 
(PK) measurements; and other protocol- specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety 
evaluation of the study drug. 
6.2.1 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include measurements of heart rate, sitting blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], 
and temperature. Vital signs will be assessed as outlined in Appendix A  and at unscheduled 
study visits when clinically indicated. Th e subjects’ height and weight will be measured as 
outlined in Appendix A . 
6.2.2 Physical Examination 
Physical examinations will be performed as outlined in Appendix A  and at  unscheduled 
study visits when clinically indicated. A complete physical examination will be performed at 
the initial S creening visit , while subsequent examinations may be abbreviated and targeted to 
changes in disease activity and/or subject s’ symptoms.

Version 3.0  Page 38 7.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is considered “serious” if i t results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• Life-threatening AE  (i.e. the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred. An event that might have led to death if it had occurred with greater severity is 
not “life -threatening”)  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
• Congenital anomaly/ birth defect  
• Important medical event (i.e. an event th at may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but which may be considered serious by [CONTACT_247065], as it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical/surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above). Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8609]: a visit to the emergency room or 
other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours that does not result in admission (unless considered an 
important medical or life -threatening event), an electiv e surgery planned prior to signing 
consent /assent , admission as per protocol for planned medical/surgical procedure, and/or 
routine health assessments requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status 
(e.g. routine colonoscopy). 
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous. Severity refers to the intensity of an 
AE (e.g. m ild, moderate, or severe pain); the event itself may be of minor medical 
significance (e.g. s evere back pain). “Serious” is a regulatory definition, as defined above. 
Serio usness (not severity) serves as the basis for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed when recording AEs and SAEs on 
the eCRF.  
7.1.[ADDRESS_300544] dose of study drug 
should be recorded as AEs.   
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -103  
Version 3.0  Page 39 Only a bnormal laboratory, vital sign, and ECG findings that are considered clinically 
significant by [CONTACT_093] (e.g. require active management or are associated with 
accompanying symptoms/signs ) will be recorded as medical history or AEs on the eCRF. 
Abnormal laboratory, vital sign, and ECG findings that occur prior to the first dose of study 
drug should be recorded as medical history, and abnormal findings that occur after the fir st 
dose of study drug should be recorded as AEs. 
If the clinically significant laboratory , vital sign, or ECG abnormality is a sign associated 
with a confirmed disease  or condition (e.g. el evated creatinine in a subject diagnosed with 
chronic kidney diseas e), only the diagnosis (chronic kidney disease ) needs to be recorded on 
the AE eCRF.  
Separate instances of the same clinically significant laboratory , vital sign, or ECG 
abnormality across visits should not be recorded as separate AEs or SAEs unless their 
severity, seriousness, or etiology changes. 
7.1.4 Deaths  
Any deaths that occur from the time of informed consent /assent  to the follow-up visit, 
regardless of attribution, must be reported within 24 hours of investigator’s awareness of the 
death.  See MTI -[ADDRESS_300545]- mortem findings and/or relevant medical 
reports, including histopathology. 
7.1.5 Pregnancies  and Contraception Requirements for Males and Fe males  
For the purposes of this study, a female of childbearing potential is  defined as any female 
who has experienced menarche and is pre- menopausal; a postmenopausal state is defined as 
no menses for [ADDRESS_300546] -pubertal and not castrated 
(e.g. history of bilateral orchiectomy) or sterilized (i.e. history or vasectomy).  
For the purposes of this  study, acceptable contraception is defined below based on 
Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing 
Authorization for Pharmaceuticals:  ICH M3(R2)  dated January 2010, and other available 
guidelines32,33,34:  
1. For female subjects:  All female subjects of childbearing potential must use highly 
effective contraception, which includes the use of one or more of the following 
acceptable methods:  
a. Surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral tubal occlusion or ligation , hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], bilateral oophorectomy) 
b. Total (as opposed to periodic or cyclic) abstinence 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -103  
Version 3.0  Page 40 c. Hormonal contraception associated with consistent inhibition of ovulation; these may 
include (but are not necessarily limited to) oral, intravaginal, implantable, injectable, 
or transdermal delivery methods.   
i. Progesterone only oral contraceptives are excluded as  a highly effective method, 
as they do not consistently inhibit ovulation. 
d. Intrauterine device/system   
e. Exclusive monogamous heterosexual intercourse with a sterilized (i.e., vasectomized) 
or otherwise non- fertile (e.g., castrated) male partner  
2. For male su bjects: All fertile male subjects , with sexual partners  who are females of 
childbearing potential,  must use condoms with or without spermicide.   
3. All subjects who are fertile males or females of childbearing potential must also refrain 
from sperm/egg donation starting from first dose of study drug and until [ADDRESS_300547] be reported 
within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the pregnancy. See MTI -[ADDRESS_300548] is 
not an SAE per se. Complications of such pregnancies (for example, spontaneous abortion ) 
may qualify as SAE s and should be reported as such  even if they occur after the Follow -up 
visit. Any congenital anomalies/birth defects must be recorded and reported as SAEs. See 
MTI-[ADDRESS_300549] ’s 
normal fluctuations during the study. It is important to include a description of the nature of 
the unexpected worsening when recording the AE or SAE (e.g. si gnificant atopic dermatitis  
flare in previously uninvolved skin).

Protocol MTI -[ADDRESS_300550] study drug administration  through the 
follow-up visit. After the 4- week follow-up visit, only SAEs that are believed to be drug-
related should be reported. 
After informed consent /assent , but prior to initiation of study drug, only SAEs considered by 
[CONTACT_247066] a protocol-mandated intervention will be collected (e.g. 
SAEs related to invasive procedures such as blood collection). These procedure- related SAEs 
should only be reported on the SAE form, not on the AE form of the eCRF. Subjects  who 
undergo screening procedures but are not randomized into the study will not have SAEs 
recorded in the clinical database.  
7.2.[ADDRESS_300551]’s medical record and on the AE eCRF page, 
and, if serious, on the SAE form. For each AE and SAE recorded, the investigator wil l make 
an assessment of seriousness, severity, and causality. 
7.2.3 Assessment of Severity 
All AE s entered into the eCRF will be graded for severity using the National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.[ADDRESS_300552] igator 
should use the definitions for Grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 in T able 1.

Regardless of severity, some AEs may meet the criteria for seriousness. See Section 7.1.2 for 
the definition of an SAE. 
The Sponsor or designee should be notified within 24 hours of investigator’s awareness of 
any Grade 3 or higher AE whenever possible. 
7.2.4 Assessment of Causality 
The i nvestigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AE s (serious and 
non-serious). An investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there 
exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE. 
Causality of an AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_247067]: 
• Likely Related: A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the 
suspected study drug; and for which other potential etiologies are considered less likely 
factors than the study drug. 
• Likely Unrelated: A reaction that, considering all potential etiologies, is most likely due 
to factors other than the study drug. 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -[ADDRESS_300553] be notified 
within 24 hours of an AE when the investigator determines that an AE meets the protocol 
definition of an SAE, regardless of the cause or relationship to study drug.  
An SAE related to study participation occurring before study drug administration and after 
informed consent /assent  should be promptly reported to the Sponsor. If the investigator 
learns of any SAE at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and the 
SAE is considered likely related to study drug, the SAE should be promptly reported to the 
Sponsor.

8 STATISTICAL METHO DS  
Endpoints will be summarized with  descriptive statistics  by [CONTACT_6982]. For 
continuous variables, the following information will be presented: n, mean, standard 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -[ADDRESS_300556] 
recorded value prior to the start of treatment. For Itch NRS measures, baseline will be the 
average result measured over 7 days prior to treatment. Additionally, the Itch NRS measures 
will be summarized in one week intervals by [CONTACT_247068].  
8.1 Decision Rule and Sample S ize  
This study contains two active dosing arms. A stepdown procedure will be used to control for 
multiplicity.  This procedure will start by [CONTACT_247069] 5 mg treatment 
group and then proceed to the 1 mg group should statistical significance ( one-sided p- values 
< 0.05) be reached for the 5 mg vs placebo comparison.  
Statistical significance for the key secondary endpoints will be dependent upon statistical 
significance being reached for the primary endpoint at the given dose level (i.e. a gatekeeper 
within dose arm will be used for the secondary endpoints). As there are multiple secondary 
endpoints a stepdown procedure will be used starting with the WI- NRS endpoint and then the 
ItchyQoL.  
If the one- sided p -values are additionally less than 2.5%, then the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053]- based regimen 
will have met the generally accepted level of evidence required to demonstrate efficacy.   
The target sample size of 450 randomized and dosed subjects (150 per group) has been 
determine based upon a 1:1:[ADDRESS_300557] for the 1  mg and 5 mg arms, and a 5% one-sided alpha level. One -hundred 
and fifty subjects per group results in  90% power for each test individually assuming a 
treatment effect (placebo change from baseline - serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_247007]) of -[ADDRESS_300558]. The primary 
analysis will control for the stratification factors. It is expected that this unstratified power 
estimate will under -estimate the true power as it does not take the variance reduction 
resulting from stratification into account .37 
8.2 Handling of M issing D ata and Excluded Therapy Use  
For summary statistics results will generally be reported based upon observed data. Should a 
determination of treatment period (on treatment, pre -treatment) be required for AE s or 
concomitant medication but the corresponding date is missing, or is a  partial date , the 
event/medication will be considered on treatment unless the portions of the date that are 
available indicate this is not possible . 
If a subject fail s to complete their eD iary for a week or more , the Itch NRS endpoints, 
including the primary endpoint, will be missing for that week. In this case , their Itch NRS 
change from baseline value will be imputed. This approach uses the subject’s last week with 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -[ADDRESS_300559] determines the average change for each week  for each 
treatment group . The difference in the weekly measures between weeks n -1 and n will be 
considered the change for Week n. These weekly change measure will be used to ‘fill in’ the 
missing weeks between the last completed week and Week 6.  
For subjects who receive excluded therapy  or with clinically significant changes in allowed 
adjunctive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_107058] 5.7.3, their Itch NRS results after the use of this 
therapy will be imputed using the same algorithm as indicated above . Hence, a placebo 
subject who receives excluded therapy in Week [ADDRESS_300560] their Week 6 WI -NRS change 
from baseline imputed as ∆ 4+∆P(4-6), where ∆ [ADDRESS_300561] up to Week 4 and ∆ P(4-6) is the placebo change from Week 4 to 6 (i.e. the average 
placebo decrease from Week 4 to 6). 
As a sensitivity analysis, a similar approach will be used where the imputation step uses 
multiple imputation methodology.  
8.3 Analysis Population s  
The primary efficacy population will be the Full Analysis Set (FAS) that  will include all 
randomized and treat ed subjects . Following the intent- to-treat philosophy, s ubjects  will be 
analyzed within the treatment group to which they are randomiz ed.  
The primary safety population will be all treated subjects . For safety analyses, subjects  will 
be classified based upon the treatment received.

Compliance with study drug dosing will be recorded within the  eDiary. From these entries, 
summaries of treatment compliance and exposure will be produced. 
8.8 Efficacy Analyses  
The efficacy endpoints will be summarized within the FAS using descriptive statistics by 
[CONTACT_247072].  For the WI- NRS and  AI-NRS end points (change from baseline, 
3-point and 4-point responders) results will be summarized at the primary time point, 
Week  6, as well as at Week 2 and 4. The WI -NRS and AI- NRS results will be summarized at 
baseline and Weeks 2, 4 and 6. For each of these measures the result at a time point are based 
upon the average of the results leading up to that time point. The night- time scratching 
events , ItchyQoL , 5-D Pruritus Scale  and sPGA will also be summarized at baseline and 
Weeks 2, 4 and 6 with change from baseline summarized at Weeks 2, 4 and 6.  Week 6 is the 
primary time point for the  ItchyQoL . The PGIC will be summarized at Weeks 2, 4 and 6. 
For the primary and key secondary endpoints these statistics will include 95% confidence 
intervals for the t reatment difference. Testing will also be used for the primary and key 
secondary endpoints.  
For the responder rate endpoints subjects will be considered a responder if they have at least 
a 3 or 4 point reduction in WI- NRS / AI -NRS between baseline and the corresponding week. 
The difference in the pr imary efficacy outc ome meas ure (WI-NRS  change from baseline to  
Week 6 ) between treatment groups will be tested using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
model controlling for the stratification factor s. A main effects model with an interaction term 
(treatment by [CONTACT_81473]) and a Type II hypothesis will be used. More precisely this 
ANOVA model uses the following as a stratified adjusted measure of the change from 
baseline for a given treatment group: 
∆=∑𝑛𝑛1𝑗𝑗𝑛𝑛2𝑗𝑗
𝑛𝑛1𝑗𝑗+𝑛𝑛2𝑗𝑗4
𝑗𝑗=1 ∆𝑗𝑗 , 
where j  represents the stratification cells, n is the sample size for treatment 1 and 2 and ∆ j is 
the change measures for stratum j .  
Conceptually t he hypotheses being tested are:  
H0:∆Placebo ≥  ∆Serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053]  H a: ∆Placebo < ∆Serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_247043] ∆Placebo  is the placebo change from baseline and ∆ Serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_247044]. Each serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_140556] (1 mg and 5 mg) will be compared to placebo 
separately.   
The primary endpoint will utilize the imputation methods as outlined in Section  8.2. 
Sensitivity analyses in which Last Observation Carried Forward, LOCF, and Base line 
Observation Carried Forward, BOCF, are used will be performed. The LOCF approach 
assumes subject’s final assessment is reflective of their future assessment and can be useful if 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -[ADDRESS_300564]. 
The BOCF approach for responder rate endpoints is equivalent to a missing equals failure 
imputation.  
The differences between treatment groups  for the ItchyQoL  key secondary endpoint  will be 
tested using the same analysis of variance ( ANOVA) model used for the primary endpoint.   
A Cochran Mantel Haenszel ( CMH) test controlling for the ‘as randomized’ stratification 
factor s will be used for the responder rate key secondary endpoint.

(ICC), P earson’s correlations, and change scores for test -retest reliability; Pearson Product 
Moment or Spearman Correlations for concurrent validity; t- test analyses or ANOVA for 
known groups validity; and correlations of change scores for WI-NRS and other measures for 
responsiveness. In addition, a responder definition will be explored using anchor- and 
distribution -based methods.

8.10.1 Adverse E vents   
The incidence of all AEs and treatment -related AEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_82153]. 
These AEs will be classified by [CONTACT_169056] (MedDRA). For incidence reporting, if a subject  
reported more than one AE that was coded to the same system organ class or preferred term, 
the subject  will be counted only once for that specific system organ class or preferred term.

verified by [CONTACT_247075].  
Data consistency and plausibility checks against data entered into the eCRF will be included 
in the eCRF system. Data corrections can be performed in the eCRFs by [CONTACT_779]. For each 
instance of data modification, the system requires a reason for c hange. The system keeps a

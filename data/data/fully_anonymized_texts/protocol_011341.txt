The protocol was am ended in response to recent non clinical finding s in the rabbit. The table 
below summarizes the changes and the affected sections:  
Change  Sections Changed  
In an embryofetal development toxicology study 
in rabbits, incomplete ossification of the 15th 
vertebra was observed in some fetuses resulting 
from the mating of male rabbits exposed to 
evinacumab with female rabbits not exposed to 
evinacumab. In male rabbits, there were 
measurable levels of evin acumab in seminal 
fluid and, as a safety measure, the current 
clinical study is amended to require consistent 
use of a condom for all sexually active males.  Section  3.2.1  Rationale for Study Design

The descriptions of the cohorts ha ve been 
updated to use only genotype information in the 
medical history (or lack of genotype 
information) for cohort assignment. This change 
has been made based upon recent data indicating 
that the baseline measurements of LPL activity 
may not be sufficiently robust to diffe rentiate

CONFIDENTIAL  CLINICAL STUDY PROTO COL SYNOPSIS  
Title  A Phase 2, Randomized, Placebo -Controlled Study of Safety  and Efficacy, 
Following Repeat -Dose Administration of Evinacumab (anti -ANGPTL3) in 
Patients with Severe Hypertriglyceridemia (sHTG) at Risk for Acute 
Pancreatitis  
Site Location s 
 Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_839574]  20 study sites globally . 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_839575].  
Objective(s)  Primary Objective :  
The primary objective of the study is to determine the change in triglycerides 
(TG) levels following 12  weeks of repeated intravenous ( IV) doses of 
evinacumab in the subset of patients with a documented history of sHTG 
(TG ≥1000 mg/ dL [11.3 mmol/L] ), a TG level of at least 500 mg/ dL 
(5.6 mmol/L) at screening, a history of acute pancreatitis  and without loss  
of function (LOF) mutations in genes in the lipoprotein lipase ( LPL) 
pathway ; and to ass ess whether a reduction in TG of at least 40% from the 
baseline placebo period has been achieved . 
Secondary Objectives : 
 To determine the percent change from baseline in TG levels 
following [ADDRESS_1166791]  
 To assess changes in patient reported abdominal and 
gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, dietary habits , and 
symptom/dietary impact measures  
 To assess the degree of pancreatic injury/inflammation 
through 18F-2-Fluoro -2-Deoxy -D glucose positron emission 
tomography (18F-FDG -PET) imaging at baseline (placebo 
run-in) and change from baseline following 12 weeks of 
treatment with evinacumab as assessed by 18F-FDG 
standardized uptake value s SUV max and SUV mean  
 To assess the degree of pancreatic injury/inflammation 
through  diffusion weighted -magnetic resonance imaging  
(DW-MRI ) at baseline and the change fr om baseline following

CONFIDENTIAL  Study Design  This is a phase 2, randomized , placebo -controlled study designed to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of repeated doses of evinacumab in adult patients 
with severe hypertriglyceridemia . Up to approximately 50 patients will be 
enrolled , randomized 2:1 to receive evinacumab or placebo . 
The study consists of a screening period of up to 3 7 days (which includes 
day -66 to day -59 [visit 1], day -58 to -52 [visit 1b], and day -51 to -39 
[visit 2]), a  baseline/ single -blind placebo run in period (day -28 to day -1), 
a 12-week double -blind treatment period (day 1 to day 85), a single -blind 
12-week treatment period  (day 86 to day 1 69), and a n off-treatment  
follow -up period (week 24 [day 170] to week  44 [day 309]). 
The following cohorts will be enrolled based upon information (or lack of 
information) on genotype in the patient’s medical history at screening : 
Cohort 1:  Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome (FCS) due to complete 
LPL deficiency.  Approximately 6 to 9 patients will be enrolled.  Thi s cohort 
consists of patients:  
 With known homozygous or compound heterozygous null 
LPL, GPI[INVESTIGATOR_37445]1, or APOC2 LOF mutations . 
Cohort 2:  Multifactorial chylomicronemia with partial LPL deficiency. 
Approximately 9 to 12 pati ents will be enrolled. This cohort consists of 
patients:  
 with known heterozygous null LPL, GP IHBP1, or APOC2 
LOF mutations, or  
 with uncharacterized or known non -null LOF LPL pathway 
gene mutations (LPL, APOC2, APOA5, LMF1 and 
GPI[CONTACT_177400] P1)  
Cohort 3:  M ultifact orial chylomicronemia. Approximately 15 to 27 patients 
will be enrolled. This cohort consists of patients not included in cohorts 1 or 
2 above:  
 with other monogenic or polygenic causes of sHTG 
(eg, CGKR, CREB3L3, E2/E2 dysbetalipoproteinemia) , or  
 without  genotype information  
For all patients who are enrolled, LPL pathway genotype will also be 
confirmed using exome sequencing.  
Screening (Day -66 to Day -29) 
During the screening period, all patients will undergo the informed consent 
process and standard scr eening procedures. Laboratory assessments used to 
determine eligibility may be repeated once during the screening period. 
Patients  who do not meet eligibility criteria during the initial screening may 
rescreen only once ; only the assessments that did not meet eligibility criteria 
initially are required to be repeated , if rescreening occurs within the

CONFIDENTIAL  Procedures and Assessments  Safety for all patients will be monitored via adverse events (AEs) reported 
by [CONTACT_13935] (including patient reported outcomes on the questionnaires) 
or observed by [CONTACT_093], physical examinations, vital signs (heart 
rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, weight, and body temperature), 
clinical laboratory tests (biochemistry, amylase, lipase, hematology, 
urinalysis), and standard 12 -lead electrocardiogram automatic reading (HR,

Efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_839616][INVESTIGATOR_6520] . 
Serum samples for the determination of total evinacumab and total 
ANGPTL3 concentrations, and anti -drug (anti -evinacumab ) antib odies 
(ADA) will be collected.  
Serum and plasma samples will be collected for analysis of additional 
biomarkers, including amyl ase and lipase.  
Imaging correlates of pancreatic health will be assessed by 18F-FDG PET,

Statistical Plan  Descriptive statistics are planned for the primary and secondary outcome 
measures collected in this study. Statistical analyses will explore data 
collected across all patients, a s well as those patients in the  genotype 
subgroups (as applicable for pharmacodynamic measures).  
Primary analysis:  
The pr imary analysis is based on percent change from baseline over 
12 weeks of evinacumab treatment for the assessment of probability 
(computed from  the likelihood function based on the observed data , which 
is equivalent to Bayesian posterior probability with uninformative prior ) that 
the mean TG change ≥40% (considered to be a clinically meaningful 
change) using study data, the point estimates of TG changes between the 
placebo run -in period and each observation week will be calculated using a 
Mixed effect Mode l for Repeated Measures (MMRM) method in the full 
analysis set  population. A natural log transformation will be applied to the 
TG levels prior to analysis, aiming to provide a relatively normal data 
distribution (residuals will be examined for normality pr ior to proceeding 
with the analysis). The MMRM model will assess within -patient treatment 
comparisons (using an unstructured covarianc e matrix), while accounting 
for basel ine TG, study visit,  and baseline TG by [CONTACT_435236]. Note 
that study visi ts will be adjusted to start of evinacumab in order to pool data 
from both randomized groups of patients  for this analysis. Since the 
comparison of  study visits yields the within -patient comparisons of study 
treatments ( ie, week 1 2 [after 12 weeks of treat ment with evinacumab] 
compared to baseline at week 0 [after 4 weeks of treatment with placebo ] in 
patients randomized to evinacumab and week  24 [after 12 weeks of 
treatment with evinacumab] compared to baseline at week 1 2 in patients 
randomized to placebo ), contrast and estimate statements will be used to

CONFIDENTIAL  assess treatment effects ( least squares [ LS] means with confidence intervals) 
and comparisons (LS mean ratio with confidence interval). Within -patient 
comparisons will include all patien ts, as well as anal yses for the  genotype 
subgroups  (to assess relationship with amount of TG reduction while on 
evinacumab). A graph will depi[INVESTIGATOR_839579] . Details on the subgroup analyses will be defined in the 
statistical analysis plan ( SAP). Both percent change and raw TG will be 
descriptively summarized by [CONTACT_15449]. In the event the MMRM model 
covariance matrix does not converge or normality is not achieved with the 
natural log transformation, then other transformation s will  be explored, 
including ranks.  
Using the estimate of the log TG mean ratio (week  12/baseline at week  0 for 
patients  randomized to evinacumab and week  24/baseline at week  12 for 
those randomized to placebo ) and the log of the standard deviation derive d 
from the MMRM model, the PP will be calculated using the target change 
from baseline of  40% reduction (ie, log 0.6) in  patients without LOF  
mutations in genes in the LPL pathway . For the probability calculation (ie, 
Pr [log TG mean ratio (post/pre)] < lo g 0.6 conditional on this study’s TG 
results), a non -informative normal distribution prior and a normal 
distribution of the data is assumed. The probability calculation will yield the 
probability that the actual mean percent decrease is at least the target  40% 
value, based on the OBSERVED results from the patients  without LOF  
mutations in genes in the LPL pathway . 
Nominal p -values for testing mean change from baseline >0 and ≥40% at 
each time point in each cohort may be com puted for information purposes.  
Since this is an exploratory study, control of the overall type -I error is not 
applicable for statistical testing. Any p -values provided for outcome 
measures are for descriptiv e purposes only.  
Safety data will be summarized.

CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION  
Elevated levels of serum triglycerides (TG) are associated wit h the development of cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) and acute pancreatitis  (AP) . Studies suggest that mild to moderate elevations in TG 
levels are an independent risk factor for the development of CVD (Hokanson  1996 ), and recent 
studies have demonstrated that genetic loss of function (LOF) variants which result in lower TG 
levels (eg, apolipoprotein  C3 (APOC3 ), ANGPTL3 , and ANGPTL4 LOF genetic variants) are 
associated with a decreased risk of myocardial infarction (Musunura 2010 , Stitziel 2016 , 
Dewey  2016 , Crosby 2014 , Dewey 2017 ). Patients with severe elevations i n TG  levels 
(>1000  mg/dL) are at increased risk of pancreatitis and current lipid guidelines recommend 
lifestyle interventions and medications to lower TG levels to prevent AP ( Berglund 2012 , 
Jacobson  2015 ). In most patients who develop AP secondary to sHTG , the condition is mild and 
self-limiting, but approximately 20% of patients suffer severe attacks associated with prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_556234] . 
Patients with sHTG ofte n require robust reductions in TG to lower the risk of acute pancreatitis , 
and a substantial proportion of patients have persistent hypertriglyceridemia, despi[INVESTIGATOR_839580] . Current available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_839581] (eg, statins, 
fibrates, niacin, omega -3 fatty acids) can provide 20% to 50% reductions in TG in some patients, 
and minimal effects in other patients, especially patients with mutations in g enes in the lipoprotein 
lipase ( LPL) pathway  (Brisson 2010 ). Patients with TG >1000  mg/dl typi[INVESTIGATOR_839582] (polygenic & environmental) in origin or due 
to the presence of highly penetrant gene mutations in the LPL pathway ( Brown  2012 , 
Minicocci  2012 ) as observed in Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome (also known as Fredrickson 
Type 1 Hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]). Lipoprotein lipase is an endothelial -bound enzyme involved in the 
hydrolysis of the TG content of very -low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and chylomicron 
lipoproteins. Mutations in the LPL gene or other genes that modulate the enzymatic activity of 
LPL, such as APOC2 , and APOA5 , LMF1 and GPI[INVESTIGATOR_37445]1, lead to varying levels of loss of LPL 
functional activity and elevated  levels of plasma TG and especially chylomicrons 
(Surend ran 2012 ). However, there is a high degree of genetic polymorphism and combinatorial 
effects of genes, diseases (such as type 2 diabetes), and environment. There is a clear sig nificant 
unmet medical  need for additional treatment options for patients with sHTG to further lower TG 
levels and the  risk of pancreatitis.  
Angiopoietin -like [ADDRESS_1166806] and has recently emerged as a potential  target 
for the treatment of elevated levels of TG, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL -C). Loss 
of function of ANGPTL3 in humans has been associated with reductions in TG, LDL -C and high-
density lipoprotein -cholesterol ( HDL -C) (Minicocci  2013 ). Deficiency of ANGPTL3 has also 
been reported to be associated with decreased serum free fatty acids (FFA) and increased insulin 
sensitivity in patients who are homozygous for LOF mutation s in ANGPTL3  (Robciuc 2 013). 
Humans carrying these variants have otherwise appeared healthy  and have a reduced risk of 
coronary artery disease  (Dewey 2017 ). 
Evinacumab (REGN1500) is a human IgG4 monoclonal antibody specific for ANGPTL3 and is 
being developed for treatment of dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_839583]  (HTG ) and 
hypercholesterolemia. Evinacumab has been studied in approximately 100 individuals with 
elevations in LDL -C and TG and has been generally well tolerated up to single doses of 20  mg/kg 
intravenous ( IV), and in multiple subcutaneous ( SC) doses up to [ADDRESS_1166807] 2019 GMT-5:00
Clinical Study Protocol  R1500 -HTG -1522 Amendment 5 
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc .  Page 27 of 99 
CONFIDENTIAL  20 mg/kg IV administered every 4 weeks for approximately 8 w eeks. After single doses, 
evinacumab lowered TG up to ~80% in participants with TG  <1000  mg/dL and lowered LDL -C 
up to 27% in participants with TG  <500  mg/dL. In a multiple ascending dose study, evinacumab 
robustly lowered TG (up to ~72%) and LDL -C (up to ~34%) in patients with TG (150 – 
500 mg/dL) and LDL -C >100  mg/dl and had a long durability of treatment effect. However, TG 
lowering was highly variable in a small cohort of patients with TG  >1000  mg/dl given a single 
dose of evinacumab (4 patients receive d 250  mg SC and 2 patients received 20  mg/kg IV). 
Although certain individuals exhibited the rapid  and substantial lowering of TG  (up to 90%) , some 
of the patients with underlying LPL and other mutations did not show robust lowering following 
single doses of evinacumab. The reason for the mixed response was not clear. Three out of the 
6 patients treated with evinacumab and 1  placebo -treated patient in the cohort of patients with 
baseline TG  >1000  mg/dL had an occurrence of acute pancreatitis during the stud y. These serious 
adverse events (SAEs) were not considered related to evinacumab since all of the patients had a 
history of prior pancreatitis epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] , had other underlying etiologies,  and the events occurred 
70 days or later after the single dose of anti body when antibody levels were low or undetectable . 
The current study is a phase 2 randomized placebo -controlled study of the effects of multiple doses 
of evinacumab (anti -ANGPTL3) on safety , on plasma lipi[INVESTIGATOR_839584] w ith sHTG with a history of acute pancreatitis. There are [ADDRESS_1166808] aim is to evaluate the safety and TG lowering effects of evinacumab in patients with 
various causes of sHTG including homozygous/heterozygous LPL gene LOF mu tations, mutations 
in other genes in the LPL pathway, and other polygenic/environmental causes of severely elevated 
TGs. Analyses of the treatment effects among individuals with or without mutations in LPL 
pathway related genes and across a range of baseli ne LPL functional activity measurements will 
allow for a better understanding of the population(s) who will have robust lowering of TG with 
evinacumab treatment. The second aim of the study is to determine whether patients with sHTG 
and a history of acute pancreatitis have subclinical evidence of ongoing pancreatic inflammation 
with or without symptoms. Ongoing pancreatic inflammation may increase the risk o f recurrent 
acute pancreatitis.  This novel hypothesis will be tested in a population of patients with a prior 
history of pancreatitis. Patients with a relatively recent history of pancreatitis (eg , within the past 
10 years) will be enrolled to select for a high -risk population that may be more likely to have 
ongoing pancreati c disease.  If patients in this rare patient population , with severe 
hypertriglycer idemia with a recent history of pancreatitis cannot be enrolled in a reasonable period 
of time, the study sponsor may allow  investigat ors to enroll patients with history of pancreatitis at 
any time in the past without the requirement of a time specification. A thorough evaluation of 
Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) (eg, patient symptoms, dietary habits), plasma biomarkers and 
imaging of t he pancreas at baseline and after treatment will be performed. In addition, the effects 
of treatment with evinacumab on pancreatic inflammation biomarkers and the incidence of acute 
pancreatitis will also be assessed.  
Additional background information on t he study drug and development program can be found in 
the Investigator’s Brochure.

3. HYPOTHESIS  AND RATIONALE  
3.1. Hypothesis  
In patients with a documented history of sHTG (TG  ≥1000 mg/ dL [11.3 mmol/L] ), a TG level of 
at least 500  mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) at screening, a history of acute pancr eatitis, and without LOF 
mutations in genes in the LPL pathway,  [ADDRESS_1166812] 40%.  
3.2. Rationale  
3.2.1.  Rationale for Study Design  
Principal aims:  
This is a phase 2, multicenter, partial -blind, placebo run -in, randomized, placebo -controlled fixed -
sequence study, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of  repeated doses of evinacumab administered 
IV for the treatment of patients with a his tory of sHTG (fasting TGs ≥1000  mg/dL) with a baseline 
TG >500 mg/dL at screening and a history of acute pancreatitis. The primary aim of the study is 
to evaluate the intrapatient change from baseline in triglyceride concentrations following treatment 
                                        VV-RIM-00089259-1.[ADDRESS_1166813] 2019 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_1166814] 
evidence of subclinical pancreatic disease as assessed by a panel of plasma/serum biomarkers , 
imaging biomarkers , and PROs  and whether these bio markers will be impacted  by [CONTACT_839619].  
Benefit/Risk Assessment : 
Elevated blood levels of TGs have been associated with the development of both CVD and acute 
pancreatitis. Current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_839588] ( eg, weight reduction, lifestyle c hanges, statins, 
fibrates, omega -3 fatty acids) have limited efficacy and/or tole rability issues.  Recent studies have 
demonstrated that patients with genetic LOF mutations that decrease the activity of LPL can result 
in severe elevations in TG. Because ANG PTL3 acts as a natural inhibitor of LPL, blockade of 
ANGPTL3 and preventing LPL inhibition is a potential  target for the treatment of elevated levels 
of TGs. Importantly, no identified safety risks from the absence of ANGPTL3 have been reported 
for the few  individuals who are homozygous for LOF mutations in ANGPTL3 ( Musunuru 2010 , 
Minicocci 2012 ). In fact, recent studies have demonstrated that genetic LOF variants which result 
in lower TG levels (eg, APOC3 , ANGPTL 3, and ANGPTL 4 LOF genetic variants) are associated 
with a decreased risk of myocardial infarction ( Musunuru  2010 , Stitziel 2016 , Dewey 2016 , 
Crosb y 2014 , Dewey  2017 ). A therapeutic targeted to ANGPTL3 could provide benefic ial changes 
in the lipid profile and ultimately in the cardiovascular ( CV) risk for patients. Additionally, 
significant reductions in TGs  would also benefit the patient with severe elevations in TGs at risk 
for pancreatitis. Thus, a significant unmet need exists for additional and improved methods for 
treating elevated TG  levels.  
Evinacumab has been evaluated in [ADDRESS_1166815] been 
established. The important potential risks with evinacumab (based on preclinical evaluation, 
mechanism of action, or risks associated wi th monoclonal antibody  [mAbs ] in general) include 
systemic hypersensitivity reactions, immunogenicity, and embryofetal toxicity. For the potential 
embryofetal toxicity risk, there is a strict risk mitigation plan, including requirements for consistent 
use of contraception for sexually active male study participant s and sexually active female study 
participants of child -bearing potential.  Currently, the available safety data along with the risk 
minimization and management activities  for all important potenti al risks support the continued 
development of this compound . 
Population:  
Three different cohorts  will be enrolled to evaluate the TG lowering effects of evinacumab in the 
setting of varying levels of LPL functional activity. Since the mechanism of action of evinacumab 
is to block an endogenous inhibitor of LPL activity in plasma, it is important to u nderstand whether 
evinacumab will lower TG when the LPL pathway and functional LPL activity is compromised 
due to partial or total loss of functional mutations in th e LPL and LPL pathways genes. Since 
genetic, environmental factors such as diet and alcohol  and disease modifiers (eg , diabetes) can 
have an impact on LPL functional activity variability, enrollment of patients according to genotype 
will ensure that the patient population includes patients with a wide range of baseline LPL 
functional activity. E nrollment of patients at specialized centers, where genetic testing to identify 
genetic causes of HTG  is routinely performed, will be encouraged, and enrollment into the [ADDRESS_1166816] 2019 GMT-5:00
Clinical Study Protocol  R1500 -HTG -1522 Amendment 5 
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc .  Page 31 of 99 
CONFIDENTIAL  cohorts  will be controlled via the Interactive Web Response System ( IWRS ). If geneti c 
information is not available in a patient’s medical history, the patient will be enrolled into cohort 
3.  
The study will enroll up to approximately [ADDRESS_1166817] previously undergone gene sequencing and other procedures to understand the 
etiology of the HTG . 
The following  cohorts w ill be enrolled based  upon the patient’s genotype : 
Cohort 1:  Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome (FCS) due to complete LPL deficiency.  
Approximately 6 to 9 patients will be enrolled. This cohort consists of patients:  
 with known homozygous or compound heterozygous null LPL , GPI[INVESTIGATOR_37445]1,  or APOC2 
LOF mutations   
Cohort 2:  Multifactorial chylomicronem ia with partial LPL deficiency.   Approximately 9 to 12 
patients will be enrolled. This cohort consists of patients:  
 with known heterozygous null LPL , GPI[INVESTIGATOR_37445]1, or APOC2 LOF mutations , or 
 with uncharacterized or known non -null LOF LPL pathway gene mutations (LPL, 
APOC2 , APOA5 , LMF1 and GPIH BP1)  
Cohort 3:  Multifactorial chylomicronemia.  Approximately 15 to 27 patients will be enrolled. This 
cohort consists of patients  not included in cohorts 1 or 2 above :  
 with other monogenic or polygenic causes of sHTG (eg, CGKR, CREB3L3, E2/E2 
dysbetalipoproteinemia) or  
 without genotype information  
Lipoprotein lipase activity will be measured in all patients at basel ine and at the end of treatment.  
Lipoprotein lipase enzyme activity will be measured using the assay developed by [CONTACT_839620] 
(Imamura  2008 ) in fasting plasma collected from patients during the screening period, after the 
patient has received an IV bolus of [ADDRESS_1166818] functional activity. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) will be done to ascertain 
or confirm any genetic mutations in LPL and other genes in the LPL pathway (L MF1, APOC2 , 
APOA5 , etc). 
Patients with a history of pancreatitis due to HTG will be enrolled to increase the probability of 
observing abnormalities in pancreatic biomarkers at baseline and treatment -related changes in 
patient -reported outcomes (eg, chronic  abdominal complaints, symptom/dietary impact  measures), 
circulating plasma/serum pancreatic/inflammation markers and noninvasive pancreatic imaging 
inflammation biomarkers. Questionnaires will be administered to patients to evaluate for clinical 
symptoms of pancreatic inflammation such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention, abdominal 
pain, loss of appetite, and/or self -imposed dietary restrictions. Amylase and lipase, which are 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_839589], will be measured. Levels of IL6 a nd C -reactive protein,

performed using 18F-FDG -PET and DW -MRI a nd T2 -MRI. 18F-2-Fluoro -2-Deoxy -D glucose PET 
is a molecular imaging modality that has demonstrated high sensitivity in the in vivo detection of 
glycolytic tissues, including tumors and inflammatory foci. Although 18F-FDG -PET has not been 
used in this part icular setting, it has been utilized to assess low -level pancreatic injury in other 
settings such as autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), atherosclerosis and infection ( Ozaki  2008 , 
Shreve  1998, Tahara  2007 , Vos 2006 , Lee 2009 , Shigekawa  2010 ). 18F-FDG PET will be 
performed at baseline and at week  12 (12 weeks after blinded treatment with  evinacumab or 
placebo ). A combination DW -MRI and T2 -MRI will also be used to assess pancreatic health at 
baseline and following treatment with evinacumab. Compared to healthy pancreatic tissue, 
inflammatory tissue is characterized as having restricted water diffusion (d ecreased ADCs), while 
necrotic tissue corresponds to less restricted water diffusion (increased ADCs). With respect to the 
T2-MRI signal, edematous or inflammatory tissue is hypothesized to possess higher T2 -weighted 
signal intensities in addition to longe r T2 relaxation times as a result of higher water con tent. The 
implementation of DW -MRI and T2 -MRI has been used to assess pancreatic health across 
pancreatic disease states, including acute, chronic and autoimmune pancreatitis as well as 
pancreatic cancer  (de Freitas  Tertulino  2015 , Xiao 2010 , Tang 2016 ). DW-MRI and T2 -MRI will 
be performed at the beginning of the placebo run -in period, prior to the randomization visit  at the 
end of the double -blind treatment period (week 1 2), and at the end of the single blind evinacum ab 
treatment period (week 2 4). 
Study Design:  
The current fixed sequence study has a 4 -week screening phase, a 4 -week single -blind placebo run 
in phase  to obtain additio nal baseline lipid data , a 12 -week double -blind, placebo controlled phase, 
a 12-week single blind active treatment phase, and a n off drug observation phase. Patients with 
sHTG are very rare and genetically diverse; therefore, it is important to study safet y and treatment 
response in all patients enrolled.  
The single -blind placebo run -in period allows for measurement of change from baseline in TG in 
patients randomized to placebo . The double -blind period allows  for an unbiased assessment of the 
safet y of evi nacumab compared to placebo . The single -blind period allows for analysis of a 
treatment effect in patients randomized to placebo . A single -blind period is preferred over an open -
label period to allow for unbiased collection of patient reported outcomes by [CONTACT_36801].   
Since fasting TG are highly variable in this population, the geometric mean of TG measurements 
obtained at specific time -points (day -28, day -14 and week 0) will be used for pre -treatment 
comparison for the 12 -week double blind period. For patients receiving placebo during the double -
blind  treatment period, the geometric mean  obtained at specific time points (week 6, 8, and 12) 
will be used as the baseline measurements for the single -blind evinacumab treatment p eriod. A 
placebo controlled double -blind period will allow an unbiased assessment of safety of  evinacumab 
versus placebo. Furthermore, offset kinetics will be observed in patients following withdraw al of 
active study medication.  
3.2.2.  Rationale for Dose Selectio n 
An IV dose of 15  mg/kg was selected to test the efficacy of evinacumab with once -monthly 
administration for this study. The 15 mg/kg IV dose is within the range of doses that has been 
                                        VV-RIM-00089259-1.[ADDRESS_1166821] 2019 GMT-5:00
Clinical Study Protocol  R1500 -HTG -1522 Amendment 5

CONFIDENTIAL  shown to be generally well tolerated and markedly efficacious in patie nts with TG levels of 
≥150  mg to  450 mg/dL (Group A) and ≥450 to  1000  mg/dL (Group B) in the single -dose 
first-in-human study (Study R1500 -HV-1214 ). Ninety to 1 00 mg/L of evinacumab appears to be 
the serum concentration of antibody associated with saturation of t he target -mediated p athway and 
to achieve maximal or near-maximal TG lowering. The PK of evinacumab is non -linear, consistent 
with target -mediated elimination. An evinacumab concentration of >100  mg/L is maintained for 
approximately 2  weeks for a 10  mg/kg IV dose and for 4 weeks for a 20  mg/kg IV dose with a 
non-linear PK consistent with target mediated elimination. Pharmacokinetics simulation shows  
that 15 mg/kg IV will maintain evinacumab concentration above 100  mg/L for 1 month during the 
24-week treatment period. Total ANGPTL3 (drug antibody complex) concentration data showed 
possible target saturation with a limited duration at 20  mg/kg which supports selection of the 
15 mg/kg IV monthly regimen. Fifteen  mg/kg of evinacumab administered monthly is therefore 
predicted to provide serum evinacumab concentrations that exceed that required to saturate the 
target -mediated pathway over  the dosing interval.

Patient s who permanently discontinue from study drug before entering the double -blind treatment 
period ( day 1, week 0) will be contact[CONTACT_839624] ( AEs) but will not be asked 
to return for th e remaining study visits.  
Patient s who permanently discontinue from study drug during the double -blind treatment period 
will be asked to return to the clinic within 5 days for an early termination visit consisting of week 
12 study assessments; these patients will then enter the off -drug treatment follow -up period.  
Patients who are permanently withdrawn from study drug during the single -blind treatment period 
will be asked to return to the clinic for an early termination visit consisting of week [ADDRESS_1166848] 2019 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_1166849] with assessments as specified in the end of study visit (ie, follow up visit) at 24 weeks after 
the premature discontinuation of study drug.  
Sexually active males and WOCBP who disconti nue the study prematurely should be reminded at 
the early termination visit following treatment discontinuation to maintain the contraceptive 
measures (as described in Section  6.2.2 ) for [ADDRESS_1166850] for 
pregnancy 4 weeks after this visit and every 4 weeks ( Q4W ) thereafter. The patient will also be 
notified of Q4W follow -up phone calls to confirm continued contraception use , to obtain results 
of urine pregnancy test s, and to obtain information on whether pregnancy has occurred in WOCBP 
and in female partners of m ale patients . 
The investigator should make the best effort to contact [CONTACT_429289] (eg, contact[CONTACT_12531]’s family 
or private physician, review available registries or health care database) who fails to return to the 
site, and to determine health status. A ttempts to contact [CONTACT_101825]’s records (eg, times and dates of attempted telephone contact, receipt for sending a

hypotension  
 Withdrawal of patient consent  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Reasons for Temporary Discontinuation of Study Drug  
The investigator may temporarily discontinue study drug dosing at any time, even without 
consultation with the medical monitor if the urgency of the situation requires immediate action 
and if this  is determined to be in the patient’s best interest. However, the Regeneron medical 
monitor should be contact[CONTACT_50444]. If a patient  requires a prohibited medication at any time during the study, the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_24895]. Based on the discussions, 
study drug may be continued or temporarily or permanently discontinued . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Management of Suspected Cases of Acute Pancreatitis

such as amylase and pancreatic lipase on a regular basis throughout the study.  Development of or 
worsening abdominal pain with or without elevations in amylase and/or pancreatic lipase may 
signify the development of acute pancreatitis in this susceptible population. Investigators may elect 
to perform additional diagnostic and laborat ory testing.  If a clinical diagnosis of acute pancreatitis 
is made, investigators may elect to temporarily discontinue study dru g. 
7.5. Management of Acute Reactions  
7.5.1.  Acute Infusion Reactions  
Emergency equipment and medication for the treatment of infusion rea ctions must be available for

 urticaria (hives, welts, wheals)  
 diaphoresis (sweating)  
 hypotension  
 dyspnea (shortness of breath)  
 vomiting  
 flushing  
The reaction(s) should be treated symptomatically . If investigators feel there is a medical need for 
treatment or discontinuation of the infusion other than described above, they should use clinical 
judgment to provide the appropriate response according to typi[INVESTIGATOR_24896].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Termination of the Infusion  
The infusion should be terminated and NOT  restarted if any of the following AEs occur:

8.2.4.  Imaging  
Imaging provides a non -invasive means of evaluating tissue -specific changes that may not be 
detectable by [CONTACT_839633] . 18F-FDG PET provides a sensitive way to 
evaluate tissue -specific inflammatory changes. This is achieved through signal enhancement 
driven by [CONTACT_839634]. Pancreatic 18F-FDG PET signal may be susceptible to drastic changes in blood glucose, and 
could be affected by [CONTACT_839635]. While 
the DW-MRI signal depends on the water diffusion through tissue and is not affected by [CONTACT_839636] , the T2 -MRI signal in soft tissue is dependent upon the degree of 
localized water content . Respi[INVESTIGATOR_839600]. Compared to other imaging modali ties, t here is more cross -
sectional published data  on the utilization of MRI in acute pancreatic states. However, more 
examples in the literature exist where 18F-FDG PET  was implemented to longitudinally assess 
pancreatic inflammat ion. Thus, b oth imaging modalities appear promising for the detection of 
pancreatic inflammation  or injury . Taken together, these factors point to the advantage an imaging  
strategy where  both modalities  are incorporated , as they may  each provide complementary 
information, or only one may be the primary source of pancreatic in jury data due to 
technical/operational challenges that cannot be fully predicted at this time.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  18F-FDG -PET  
18F-FDG -PET will be performed at baseline (placebo run -in period) and following 12 weeks of 
study treat ment (double -blind treatment period)  as a method to measure inflammation in the 
pancreas . 
Although 18F-FDG -PET has not been used to detect subclinical pancreatic inflammation in patients 
with HTG , it has been utilized to assess low -level pancreatic injury in other settings.  We plan to 
assess subclinical pancreatic injury through 18FDG -PET measures (maximal standard ized uptake 
value, SUV max, SUV mean, and incorporation rates, Ki or Kpatlak at baseline and following 12 weeks 
of treatment). Although 18FDG -PET has not been used in this particular setting, it has been utilized 
to assess low -level pancreatic injury in other settings. 18F-FDG PET is a molecular imaging 
modality that has demonstrated high sensitivity in the in vivo detection of glycolytic ti ssues, 
including tumors and inflammatory foci. 18F-FDG PET has been applied in a clinical setting to the 
assessment of inflammation for a variety of indications, including AIP, atherosclerosis and 
infection ( Ozaki 2008 , Shreve 199 8, Glaudemans 2013 ,Tahara  2007 , Vos 2006 ). 18F-FDG PET 
has shown the capability of measuring longitudinal patient inflammatory response in the context 
of AIP, where patients who present with pancreatitis symptoms and high baseline pancreatic PET 
signal were treated with corticosteroids. These studies  demonstrated the within -patient 
normalization of PET signal after treatment (see  Figure  2) (Lee 2009 ). While normal pancreas ha s

CONFIDENTIAL  a PET uptake signal with a n SUV mean = 2.0±0.5  (mean  ± SD), patients with AIP show enhanced 
pancreatic PET uptake with a n SUV mean = 4.0±1.2, providing a substantial signal window (SUV = 
a normalized measure of activity concentration in tissue, SUV max is the maximum SUV within a 
region of interest). Given the test/re -test variability in PET signal (CV  = 15%), a mean ~10% 
change in mean pancreatic SUV signal should be readily detectable in this study. Studies in patients 
undergoing corticosteroid treatment for AIP experienced consistent reductions of ~40% pancreatic 
signal and normalization of 18F-FDG panc reatic uptake ( Lee 2009 , Shigekawa  2010 ). A 30% 
reduction in 18F-FDG pancreas uptake should be deemed as clinically significant. In one study 
(N=12), 50% of patients with pancreatitis and positive 18F-FDG PET  scans showed normal 
amylase and lipase levels ( Shreve 199 8), suggesting that 18F-FDG PET may have better sensitivity 
for detection of pancreatic inflammation than traditional markers of pancreatitis.  
Figure  2: 18F-FDG PET showing decrease of signal in areas of AIP inflammation  
(pancreas, salivary glands and retroperitoneum) after up to 2 months of 
prednisolone treatment (0.5 mg/kg , baseline on the left, post -treatment on the 
right ) (Lee 2009 ). 
 
18F-FDG PET has been shown to be able detect inflamed/vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque in the 
carotid of patients ( Figure  3) (Tawakol  2006 ) and to detect ~15% reductions in signal following 
12 weeks of treatment with high -dose statin (versus low dose statin) in N=34 patients 
(Tawakol  2013 ). Since the acquisitions with 18F-FDG PET in the present study will include the 
neck and thoracic regions, it will be possible to assess suspect areas of atherosclerotic plaque in 
the carotid and aorta of patients. Reduction of signal (target to background ratio - TBR) in these 
areas wou ld indicate a potential beneficial effect of ANGPTL3 inhibition on atherosclerotic 
lesions. ANGPTL3 inhibition in rodents has led to reductions in atherosclerotic plaque. Since 18F-
FDG -PET can detect inflammation in atherosclerotic lesions, we plan to expl ore imaging of the 
carotids and aorta before and after treatment, without any further isotope dosing or radiation 
exposure .

low 18F-FDG uptake in the region of the carotid plaque, while Patient B had

of patient B compared to patient A as determined from excised tissue

18F-FDG PET scans (including a low -dose CT scan) result in typi[INVESTIGATOR_839601] 7 
to 10 mSv per study for an adult (19 microSv/MBq) (ICRP 80). The maximum recommended 
allowed effective dose for  a research patient  in a single year is 50 mSv ( 21CFR361.1 ). Two 
18F-FDG PET studies would result in an approximate dose of 20 mSv, or 40% of the recommended 
maximum allowed dose. R isk and management of r adiation exposure will be disclosed to patients  
in the informed consent form. 18F-FDG PET will be performed at week 2 and at week 16 (12 weeks 
after initia tion of evinacumab treatment).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Magnetic Resonance Imaging  
MRI  will be used to a ssess pancreatic injury/inflammation at baseline and after treatment with 
evinacumab. With MRI , there is no ionizing radiation dose to the patient that would limit the 
number of imaging studies that could be performed. Pancreati c MRI is planned for day -28, week  -
2, week 1 2 and week 2 4. Week 1 2 and 2 4 scans  will allow for short -term and long -term 
inflammatory response assessments ( Klauss  2015 ). During early stages of pancreatic injury or 
inflammation, acinar cell injury, activation of pancreatic stellate cells and an invasion by 
[CONTACT_482006],  neutrophils and macrophages are all known to exist ( Whitcomb 2004 ). Such intra -and 
extracellular pathological events modulate microstructural properties of affected pancreatic tissue, 
and in turn, alter the Brownian motion of water molecules in cellular compartment. In DW -MRI, 
the random diffusion of water molecules occurring within intracellular, extracellular and 
intravascular spaces is measured, enabling detection of macroscopic soft tissue pathology such as 
edema, necrosis and fibrosis. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC, units of mm2/sec) is a 
principal metric quantified in DW-MRI experiments, where ADC values can be mapped across a 
region of interest at a s patial resolution of ~3  x 3 x 5 mm3. Compared to healthy pancreatic tissue, 
inflammatory tissue is characterized as having restricted water diffusion (decreased ADCs), whi le 
necrotic tissue corresponds to less restricted water diffusion (increased ADCs). Normal pancreas 
ADCs are (1.77±0.32)  X 103 mm2/sec while acute pancreatitis ADCs are (1.32±0.32)  X [ADDRESS_1166876] 2019 GMT-5:00

CONFIDENTIAL  mm2/sec showing a significant window for measuring  the projected  inflammatory changes in the 
pancreas.  Given a test/re -test variability of 18%, a signal change of 20% should be detectable in 
the present study . 
Measurement of ADCs has been used to assess pancreatic health across pancreatic disease states, 
including acute, ch ronic and autoimmune pancreatitis as well as pancreatic cancer. Confirming 
earlier observations, de Freitas Turtulino recently reported a ~20% difference in ADC between 
healthy (N=15) and mild acute (N=13) pancreas states  (de Freitas  Tertulino  2015 ) (Figure  4). 
Lower  ADCs were also detected in indications possessing pancreatic inflammation such as in c ases 
of chronic obstruct ion of the main pancreatic duct  known to exist in pancreatic cancer 
(Hayano  2016 ). Here, a ~12% difference in ADCs between large and small main pancreatic duct  
diam eter cohorts was observed (Mann -Whitney U test [P=0.03 ]). For review of implementation of 
DW-MRI in pancreatic disease see Barral [ADDRESS_1166877]  (Figure  5). Moreover, pancreatic lesions can be asses ses in 
combination with  whole organ or regional  (head, neck, body and tail)  pancreatic volume , which 
can be modulated in a disease state . In the current study, ADCs, T2 -weighted intensities and T2 
relaxations times will be reported for the whole pancreas i n addition for each pancreatic sub -region 
(head, neck, body and tail). Outside of disease states affecting pancreatic health, a combined 
diffusion -weighted and T2-MRI approach is commonly utilized for early detection of lesions 
following stroke, monitoring  of hepatic metastases across oncology indications and detection of 
focal renal lesions known to exist in metabolic diseases such as chronic kidney disease.  Thus, the 
combined DW -MRI and T2 -MRI approach is commonly implemented and validated across 
multiple  indications  (Mashhood 2013 ). 
Magnetic resonance imaging is used in the measurement of hepatic fat f raction.  A multi -echo 
gradient -recalled echo sequence acquiring axial images to cover the entire liver is recommended. 
The echo t imes shall be such that at successive echo times ( TEs), fat and water alternate between 
out-of-phase and in -phase. To minimize motion artifacts, these should be acquired under breath 
hold (not to exceed 20 seconds), and 3 separate breath hold acquisitions covering different sections 
of the liver (superior -middle -inferior) will need to be acquired. The full acquisition should take [ADDRESS_1166878] 2019 GMT-5:00

[IP_ADDRESS].  Genomics S tudy  
To better understand  the response to inhibition of ANGPTL3 in patients with sHTG, this study 
will enroll patients with LPL defi ciency (as assessed by [CONTACT_7631] ) as well as those with relatively 
intact LPL activity.  Lipoprotein lipase deficiency can be caused by [CONTACT_839640] , such as APOC2 , and APOA5 . APOC2  serves 
as an activator protein of LPL and APOA5 is thought to stabilize the lipoprotein enzyme complex 
and enhance lipolysis.  
Loss of function mutations in L PL (eg, deletions or duplications ) lead to levels of undetectable 
LPL activity and mass in plasma ( Monsalve  1990 ) and heterozygotes who have a G215E mutation 
have mean levels of LPL at about 50% of normal though individually their l evels overlap with 
normal levels ( Wilson 1993 ). Other genetic causes of sHTG include homozygous mutations in 
LMF1 and GPI[INVESTIGATOR_37445]1 , which are genes in the LPL pathway. In a study of 86 sHTG patients (both 
Type 1 and Type 5 with TGs > 10 mmol/L), with a range of LPL enzyme activity levels, 35% had 
rare causative mutations in LPL, 11% had mutations in APO A5, APO C2, LMF1 and GPI[INVESTIGATOR_37445]1 ,

(Surendran  2012 ). Based on the data from this Dutch study, not all L OF mutations in the LPL 
pathway result ed in diminished LPL enzyme activity.  
DNA will be collected for all patients and sequencing performed to confirm mutations if 
previously genotyped and analysis will be done to identify mutations in genes in the LPL pathway 
eg, LPL, APOC2 , APOA5  as well as other genes kn own to be associated with sHTG.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9. SAFETY DEFINITIONS, REPORTING, AND MONIT ORING  
9.1. Obligations of Investigator  
The investigator must promptly report to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) /Ethics Committe e 
(EC)  all unanticipated problems involving risks to patient . This includes death from any cause and 
all SAEs related to the use of the study drug. It is recommended that all SAEs be reported to the 
IRB/EC, regardless of a ssessed  causality.  
9.2. Obligations of Sponsor  
During the course of the study, the sponsor will report in an expedited manner all SAEs that are 
both unexpected and at least reasonably related to the study drug ( suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reaction [ S[LOCATION_003]R]), to the health authorities , IRBs/ECs as appropriate, and to the 
investigators . 
Any AE not listed as an expected event in the Investigator’s Brochure or in this protocol will be 
considered as unexpected . Any worsening of or new onset of symptoms relate d to sHTG which 
occur during the screening period prior to study drug administration will be considered expected.  
In addition, the sponsor will report in an expedited manner all SAEs that are expected and at least 
reasonably related to the study drug  to the health authorities , according to local regulations.  
At the completion of the study, the sponsor will report all safety observations made during the 
conduct of the trial in the clinical study report to health authorities and IRBs/ECs as appropriate.  
                                        VV-RIM-00089259-1.[ADDRESS_1166886] 2019 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_1166887] a causal relationship with the study drug. Therefore, an AE is any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease , which is 
temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether  or not considered related to the study 
drug.  
An AE also includes any worsening (ie, any clinically significant change in frequency and/or 
intensity) of a pre -existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug.  
9.3.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death  - includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrelated 
to study drug (eg, a car accident in which a patient  is a passenger).  
 Is life-threatening  - in the v iew of the investigator, the patient  is at immediate risk of 
death at the time of the event. This does not include an AE that had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.  
 Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_839606] .  
In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24927] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73422] 24 hours. Prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31561] a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_839607], or is prolonged 
due to the development of a new AE as determined by [CONTACT_28807].  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Is an important medical event - Important medical events may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the patient  or 
may require intervention to prevent one of the other s erious outcomes listed above (eg, 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse).  
9.3.3.  Infusion Reactions  
Infusion reactions are defined as any AE that occurs during the infusion or within [ADDRESS_1166888] be reported as AEs (defined in Section  9.4.1 ) 
and graded using the grading scales as instructed in  Section  9.5.[ADDRESS_1166889] 2019 GMT-5:00

CONFIDENTIAL  9.4. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
9.4.1.  Adverse Events  
The investigator (or designee) will record all AEs that occur from the time the informed consent 
is signed until the end of study. Refer to the study reference manual for the procedures to be 
followed.  
Information on  follow -up for AEs is provided in Section  9.4.[ADDRESS_1166890] be reported to the 
sponsor (or designee) within [ADDRESS_1166891] reports may 
also be requested.  
In the event the investigator is informed of an SAE after the patient  completes the study, the 
following will apply:  
 SAE with an onset within [ADDRESS_1166892] study 
drug administration if the patient terminated from the study early - the SAE will be 
reported to the sponsor. The investigator should mak e every effort to obtain follow -up 
information on the outcome until the event is considered chronic and/or stable.  
 SAE with  an onset day greater than 30 days from the end of study  or 24 weeks from 
the early termination visit  for patients who terminate from the study early  - only fatal 
SAEs and those deemed by [CONTACT_50460] -related SAEs will be reported 
to the spo nsor. The investigator should make every effort to obtain follow -up 
information on the outcome of a drug -related SAE until the event is considered chronic 
and/or stable.  
9.4.3.  Other Events that Require Accelerated Reporting  to Sponsor  
The following events also r equire reporting to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of learning 
of the event:  
Symptomatic Overdose of Study Drug:  Accidental or intentional overdose of at least 2  times 
the intended dose of study drug within the intended therapeutic w indow, if 
associated with an AE.  
Pregnancy:  Although pregnancy is not considered an AE, it is the responsibility of the 
investigator to report to the sponsor (or designee), within [ADDRESS_1166893] dose of study drug . Any 
complication of pregnancy affecting a female study patient , or the female partner 
of a male study patient,  and/or fetus and/or newborn t hat meets the SAE  criteria 
                                        VV-RIM-00089259-1.[ADDRESS_1166894] 2019 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_1166895]:   All AESI, serious and nonserious, must be reported 
within [ADDRESS_1166896] for this study include

and/or  
 At least 2 values of HbA1c ≥6.5% during the TEAE period .  NOTE : For patie nts 
with only a single measurement available during the TEAE period, a single value 
≥6.5% will be considered and qualify the patient as new onset of diabetes  by 
[CONTACT_15094]. For patients with several HbA1c measurements but only with the last one 
≥6.5%, this si ngle value ≥6.5% will be considered and qualify the patient as new 
onset of diabetes  by [CONTACT_15094].  
and/or  
 At least 2 values of fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L ).  NOTE: For patients 
with only a single measurement available during the TEAE period, a single value 
≥126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) will NOT be considered and will NOT qualify the patient 
as new onset of diabetes . For patients with several fasting glucose measureme nts but 
only with the last one ≥126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L), this single value ≥ 126 mg/dL 
(7.0 mmol/L) will NOT be considered and will NOT qualify the patient as new onset 
of diabetes  
 Pancreatitis  
Refer to the study manual for the procedures to be followed.  
9.4.4.  Reporting Adverse Events Leading to Withdrawal from the Study  
All AEs that lead to a patient ’s withdrawal from the study must be reported to the sponsor’s 
medical monitor within [ADDRESS_1166898] 2019 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_1166899] finding should be reported as an 
AE include:  
 the test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or  
 the test result req uires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, 
and/or  
 the test result leads to a change in dosing (outside of protocol -stipulated dose 
adjustments), discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant drug 
treatment, o r other therapy  
Contact [CONTACT_109992], although it does not meet any of the above criteria.  
Repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above c onditions, does not constitute an 
AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an AE.  
Evaluation of severity of laboratory abnormalities will be assessed according to the scale outlined 
in Section  9.5.1 . 
9.4.6.  Follow -up 
Adverse  event information will be collected until the  patient ’s last study visit.  
Serious adverse event information will be collected until the event is considered chronic and/or 
stable.  
9.5. Evaluation of Severity and Causality  
9.5.1.  Evaluation of Severity  
The severity of AEs will be graded according to the following scale:  
 Mild:  Does not interfere in a significant manner with the patient  normal functioning 
level. It may be an annoyance. Prescription drugs are not ordinarily needed for relief of 
symptoms, but may be given because of personality of the patient . 
 Moderate:   Produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazardous to healt h. 
It is uncomfortable or an embarrassment. Treatment for symptom may be needed.  
 Severe:   Produces significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation and is a 
definite hazard to the patient ’s health. Treatment for symptom may be given and/or 
patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  
If a laboratory value is considered an AE, its severity should be based on the degree of 
physiological impairment the value indicates.

9.5.2.  Evaluation of Causality  
Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug:  
The relationship of AEs to study drug will be assessed by [CONTACT_093], and will be a clinical 
decision based on all available information. The following question will be addressed:  
Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_5257]?  
The possible answers are:  
Not Related:  There is no reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_101833]:  There is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_50464] 
A list of factors to consider when assessing the relationship of AEs to s tudy drug is provided in 
Appendix  2. 
The investigator should justify the causality assessment of each SAE.  
Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Conduct:  
The relationship of AEs to study conduct will be assessed by [CONTACT_093], and will be a clinical 
decision based on all available information. The following question will be addressed:  
Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have bee n caused by [CONTACT_50465]?

9.6. Safety Monitoring  
The investigator will monitor the safety of study patient  at his/her site (s) as per the requirements 
of this protocol and consistent with current Good Clinical Practice (GCP ). Any questions or 
concerns should be discussed with the sponsor in a timely fashion . The sponsor will monitor the 
safety data from across all study sites . The medical monitor will have primary responsibility for 
the emerging safety profile of the compound , but will  be supp orted by [CONTACT_25047] 
(eg, Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management; Biostatistics and Data Management ). Safety 
monitoring will be perf ormed on an ongoing basis (eg, individual review of SAEs) and on a 
periodic cumulative aggregate basis.  
9.7. Investigator Alert Notification  
Regeneron (or designee) will inform all investigators participating in this clinical trial, as well as 
in any other clin ical trial using the same investigational drug, of any SAE that meets the relevant 
requirements for expedited reporting (an AE that is serious, unexpected based on the Investigator’s 
Brochure  or this protocol , and has a reasonable suspected causal relation ship to the 
medicinal/study drug).  
10. STATISTICAL PLAN  
This section provides the b asis for the SAP for the study.  The SAP may be revised during the study 
to accommodate amendments to the clinical study protocol and to make changes to adapt to 
unexpected issue s in study execution and data that may affect the planned analyses. The final SAP 
will be issued before the database is locked.  
Analysis variables are listed in Section  4.

10.2. Justification of Sample Size  
Percent change in TG is analyzed based on log (post/pre) transformation, allowing for a normal 
distribution of the data. Standard deviations (SD) of raw percent changes up to 13% are akin to 
moderate SD on the log scale (30 -40%).  For the statistical precision calculations, a log -scale SD 
of 0.5 was used based on available evinacumab phase 1 data, and is assume d to be conservative. 
With N=10  patients, the 90% confidence interval (CI) for an estimated mean reduction in 
triglycerides  of 40 % is approximately 20% to 55%. With N=12, the CI is 22% to 54%. A sample 
size of 24 is considered adequate to analyze the percent change in T G in the 3 genetic cohorts . 
Assuming a 2 0% drop out rate, approximately  30 patients will be need ed to assess TG. Additional 
patients  (up to a maximum of approximately 50 patients ) will be enrolled with the intent to explore 
the effect of evinacumab on development of pancreatitis.  
For the FDG -PET uptake signal SUV max, prior data on steroid -treated patients yielded  a natural 
log-scale SD of change of 0.66 ( Shigekawa 2010 ). This yields 80% power to yield a statistically 
significant (alpha=0.05, 1 -sided) change from baseline within the N=16 evinacumab -treated 
patients if the TRUE underlying geo metric mean rat io (post/pre) is 0.65 (back -transformed from 
the log -scale; ~35% reduction). Fo r comparison to the N=8 placebo -treated patients, assuming log -
scale SD=0.15 for placebo based on reproducibility data, and 0.66 for evinacumab, there is 80% 
powe r if the TRUE underlying geometric mean ratio (GMR) of GMR's (evinacumab post/pre 
divided by [CONTACT_839644]/pre) is 0.64 (~36% reduction).  
For the key MRI endpoint "mean f", which is the weighting coefficient between contrasting MRI 
regions ( Klau ss 2015 ) reported summary statistics which yield an SD estimate at most 5.96 for 
change from baseline. With this assumed SD, the N=[ADDRESS_1166904] 80% power to yield a statistically significant (alpha=0.05,  1-sided) change from 
baseline if the TRUE underlying mean change is 3.12 (~30% from baseline 10.5, which was 
observed by [CONTACT_839645] [Klau ss 2015 ]). For the between -treatment comparison (N=16 evinacumab vs 
N=8 placebo), there is 80% pow er if the TRUE difference is 6.62 (~63% of the 10.5 baseline value 
observed by [CONTACT_839645] [Klau ss 2015 ]).

10.4.3.  Efficacy Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary analysis is based on percent  change from baseline in TG over 12  weeks of evinacumab 
treatment. For the assessment of probability (computed from the likelihood function based on the 
observed data , which  is equivalent to Bayesian posterior probability with uninformative prior ) that 
                                        VV-RIM-00089259-1.[ADDRESS_1166908] 2019 GMT-5:00

CONFIDENTIAL  mean TG percent change ≥40% (considered to be a clinically meaningful change) using study data,  
the point estimates of TG percent changes between the placebo run -in period and each observation 
week will be calculated  using a Mixed -effect Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM) method in 
the FAS population. A natural log transformation will be applied to the TG levels prior to analysis, 
aiming to provide a relatively normal data distribution (residuals will be examined for normality 
prior to proceeding with the analysis).  The MMRM model will assess within -patient treatment 
comparisons (using an unstructured covariance matrix), while account ing for  baseline TG, study 
visit, and baseline TG by [CONTACT_435236].  Note that study visits will be adjusted to start of 
evinacumab in order to pool data from both randomized groups of patient s for this analysis. Since 
the comparison of study visi ts yields the within -patient comparisons of study treatments ( ie, week 
12 [after 12 weeks of treatment with evinacumab ] compared to baseline at week 0 [after 4 weeks 
of treatment with placebo ] for patients randomized to evinacumab and week 2 4 [after 12  weeks of 
treatment with evinacumab] compared to baseline at week  12 for those randomized to placebo ), 
contrast and estimate statements will be used to assess treatment effects ( least squares [ LS means 
with confidence intervals) and comparisons (LS mean ratio with CI). Within -patient comparisons 
will include all patients, as well as analyses for the genotype  subgroups  (to assess relationship with 
amount of TG reduction while on evinacumab). A gr aph will depi[INVESTIGATOR_839608] . Details on the subgroup analyses will be defined in the SAP.  
Both percent change and raw TG will be descriptively summarized by [CONTACT_15449]. In the event the 
MMRM model covariance  matrix does not converge or normality is not achieved with the natural 
log transformation, then other transformations will be explored, including ranks.  
To reduce variability of TG baseline measurements, baseline at week [ADDRESS_1166909] 2 measurements during the placebo run -in (day 
-28, day -14) and week 0. Baseline at week [ADDRESS_1166910] 2 measurements during the placebo phas e (weeks 6, 8) and first 
measurement prior to active infusion (week 1 2). Additional exploratory analyses may be carried 
out using the average of all available TG observations prior to first dose of active treatment, if no 
trend over time in thos e measureme nts is discernable.  
Using the estimate of the log TG mean ratio ( week 12/baseline at week 0 for patients randomized 
to evinacumab and week  24/baseline at week  12 for those randomized to placebo ) and the log of 
the standard deviation derived  from the MMRM model, the PP will be calculated using the target 
percent change from baseline of 40% reduction  (ie, log 0. 6) in patients  without LOF mutations in 
genes in the LPL pathway . For the probability calculation (i e, Pr [log TG mean ratio (post/pre) ] < 
log 0.6 conditional on this study’s TG results), a non -informative normal distribution prior and a 
normal distribution of the data is assumed.  The probability calculation will yield the probability 
that the actual mean percent decrease is at least the target 40% value, based on the OBSERVED 
results from the patient s without LOF mutations in genes in the LPL pathway . 
This fixed sequence design assumes no carryover effect from the placebo run -in period into the 
active treatment period. This assu mption will be verified by [CONTACT_839647] -in period. A generally flat or non -decreasing trend over time in the 
placebo run -in period will be evidence of no carryover effect into the active treatment period a nd 
of a useful valid baseline benchmark against which to compare treatment effects based on within -
patient  comparisons (active treatment period to placebo run -in period). As a sensitivity analysis, 
the TG reduction and posterior probability  analyses of the  combined sequence groups will be 
repeated using the same baseline at week 0. Note that the follow -up period is expected to have 
                                        VV-RIM-00089259-1.[ADDRESS_1166911] 2019 GMT-5:00

CONFIDENTIAL  carryover effects from the active treatment period and is included to estimate the time course of 
those effects. Such carryover  effects may also be interpreted as evidence of treatment effects.  
Nominal p-values for testing mean change from baseline >0 and >40% at each time point in each 
cohort  may be computed for information purposes.  Since this is an exploratory study, control of  
the overall type -I error is not applicable for statistical testing.  Any p -values provided for outcome 
measures are for descriptive purposes only.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Secondary  and Exploratory  Efficacy Analysis  
Continuous secondary and exploratory endpoints will be analyzed s imilarly to the primary 
endpoint, except PP will not be computed. Binary endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_839648] . Triglyceride mean percent change from baseline at each observation week will be 
summarized . Triglyceride  mean percent change from baseline at each observation week will be 
analyzed and estimated for genetic mutations affecting LPL function (eg, homozygous LPL null 
[total LOF], heterozygous LPL null, with no LPL n ull gene mutations subgroups).  
For the FDG -PET endpoint, comparisons wil l be within the evinacumab -treated patients in the 
double -blind period ( week  [ADDRESS_1166912]/pre) and between the treatment groups in the 
double -blind period (week  12 vs week  -2 for evinacumab in comparison to week  12 vs week  -2 
for placebo). In ord er to yield corresponding results, the MRI readout will be analyzed similarly 
as the FDG -PET endpoint . In addition, combining all evinacumab post/pre observations from the 
double -blind period (week 1 2 vs week  -2) and the single -blind post/pre (week 2 4 vs week  12) for 
the patients who received placebo in the double -blind period , and post/pre (week 2 4 vs week -2 
and week 2 4 vs week 1 2) for patients randomized to evinacumab during the double -blind period . 
Summary statistics may be computed for time points bey ond week  [ADDRESS_1166913] measure. These measures will also be psychomet rically analyzed; this will be 
outlined in a separate psychometric analysis plan .

  Page [ADDRESS_1171541] cell disease defines two major subgroups – cutaneous 
mastocytosis (CM) and systemic mastocytosis (SM) which are further divided into different 
disease variants  (Vardiman  et al. 2002 , Valent  et al. 2005 , Valent  et al. 2007 ).  
SM is a condition, defined by [CONTACT_843038], together  with cytological and biochemical signs of systemic disease  
(Valent  et al. 2005 ).  SM can show either an indolent or an aggressive clinical course .  
Depending on the stage of the disease, infiltration of organs may occur with  or without 
impairment of organ function and patients can shift from one category of mast cell disease 
into another .  In all categories, mediator -related symptoms may occur and may represent a 
serious clinical problem .  Infiltration of organs by [CONTACT_843039], osteolysis, 
pathologic fractures, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and malabsorption  
(Vardiman  et al. 2002 , Valent  et al. 2005 , Valent  et al. 2007 ).  
ASM and MCL are very rare, comprising only a small proportion of all SM cases .  ASM is 
characterized by a pathologic infiltration of diverse organs by [CONTACT_843040], with 
resulting organ damage (bone marrow, liver, spleen, gastrointes tinal tract, skeletal system) .  
Respective clinical/laboratory findings are called 'Clinical Findings' ( C-Findings ).  In this 
context, mast cell infiltration with associated organomegaly only (B -Finding (s), as seen in 
SSM) but no sign of organ damage  should not be regarded as C -Finding (s).  In contrast to the 
indolent forms of SM in which the patients can stay for many years or even decades with 
good prognosis, patients with the aggressive form of SM or MCL have a poor prognosis and 
are candidates for  cytoreductive or targeted therapy to limit organ infiltration and further 
organ damage ( Valent  et al. 2005 , Valent  et al. 2007 , Valent  et al. 2007 , Horny  et al. 2007 ).  
In approximately 30% of SM patients, an AHNMD (myeloid malignancy) is diagnosed .  The 
subvariant categories of AHNMD include SM -AML (acute myeloid leukemia), SM-MDS 
(myelodysplastic syndrome), SM-MDS/MPN  (MDS/myelopr oliferative neoplasm, eg, chronic 
myelomonocytic leukemia), and SM -HES or SM -CEL ( hypereosinophilic syndrome or 
chronic eosinophilic leukemia) .  Generally, separate treatment plans for the SM and the 
AHNMD should be established for these patients .  However, the SM and AHNMD may share 
a common pathophysiologic link, and particular treatments may be useful for both the SM and 
myeloid malignancy .  Although the intent of SM -directed therapy is to target neoplastic mast 
cells, it may not always be possibl e to identify whether organ damage is due to the SM or 
AHNMD component or both.  Patients with CEL -associated with the FIPL1 -PDGFRα fusion 
gene may exhibit increased mast cells in the bone marrow but are not classified by [CONTACT_843041].  It is  recommended that such patients  be treated with 
imatinib ( Valent  et al. 2007 ) and would not be considered eligible for this protocol . 
The most important growth factor for mast cells seems to be stem cell factor ( SCF) also 
termed mast cell growth factor or KIT ligand .  SCF induces the development of mast cells 
from their uncommitted CD34+ progenitors .  The effects of SCF on mast cells and mast cell

hematological clonal non -mast cell lineage disease (AHNMD)

  Page 10 of 55  progenitors are mediated through KIT, a tyrosine kinase receptor (f or SCF) encoded by [CONTACT_843042] -oncogene .  SCF and SCF -dependent activation of KIT are essential to the 
development and differentiation of mast cells .  “Gain -of-function mutations” in the kinase 
domain of KIT are associated with enhanced growth of mast ce lls and their progenitors .  Such 
mutations ( eg, D816V) are frequently detected in patients with SM ( Valent  et al. 2005 ).  
Specific gene defects are well recognized as the oncogenic factors in SM .  The KIT D816V 
mutation expre ssed in neoplastic mast cells is by [CONTACT_843043] .  Highly sensitive methods have detected that >90%  of patients with SM carry 
the D816V KIT mutation .  Several other KIT gene defects have been identified in patients 
with mast cell disease, but each are likely to be present in less than 5% of diagnosed patients 
(Sotlar  et al. 2003 , Garcia -Montero  et al. 2006 , Valent  et al. 2005 ).  
Treatments for SM can be divided into two broad categories (1) those intended to control mast 
cell mediator -related symptoms ( eg, antihistamines, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], or corticosteroids) and (2) 
those intended t o limit the MC burden ( eg, cytoreductive or targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) .  Due to the 
heterogeneous nature of the disease an individualized approach to the treatment strategy is 
indicated .  To date, there is no approved standard therapy to treat SM available and th ere are 
only limited options for the treatment of ASM and MCL with the exception of imatinib being 
approved in the US in KIT D816V negative patients  or those in whom KIT mutation status is 
unknown .  
Interferon -α (IFN -α) combined with or without corticosteroids, or cladribine can elicit 
response rates in approximately 40% of patients, but almost all are partial in nature and 
short -lived  and limited tolerability led to early discontinuation of treatment in some cases 
(Kluin-Nelemans HC  et al. 1992, Worobec et al, 1996, Butterfield JH, et al 1998, Tefferi 
A, et al. 2001, Kluin -Nelemans,  et al. 2003, Casassus P,  et al. 2002, Hauswirth  et al. 2004 , 
Akin and Metcalfe, 2004 , Valent  et al. 2007 ).  In ongoing clinical trials, the KIT inhibitor 
midostaurin can inhibit the imatinib -resistant D816V KIT mutation in vitro , and has shown 
preliminary encouraging efficacy in patients with ASM/MCL with a 38% major response rate 
per Valent Criteria  (Gotlib et al, 2010 ).  
1.2 SGN -35 (brentuximab  vedotin )  
 
Brentuximab  vedotin  (SGN -35) is a CD30 -directed antibody -drug conjugate ( ADC) 
consisting of three components:  1) the antibody cAC10, specific for human CD30, 2) the 
highly potent antimicrotubule agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), and 3) a 
protease -cleavable linker that covalently attaches MMAE to cAC10.  The biological acti vity 
of brentuximab  vedotin  results from a multi -step process.  Binding of the ADC to CD30 on 
the cell surface initiates internalization of the ADC -CD30 complex, which then traffics to the 
lysosomal compartment.  Within the cell, a single defined active sp ecies, MMAE, is released 
via proteolytic cleavage.  Binding of MMAE to tubulin disrupts the microtubule network 
within the cell, induces cell cycle arrest, and results in apoptotic death of the CD30 -expressing 
tumor cell.  
  
Two phase 2 studies evaluating t he efficacy and safety of brentuximab  vedotin  as a single 
agent were performed in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and 
systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL).  In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] 2 study of relapsed or

hematological clonal non -mast cell lineage disease (AHNMD)  
______________________________________________________________________________________  
  Page 11 of 55  refractory HL, 75%  of patients had an objective response (complete or partial remission) with 
median duration of approximately [ADDRESS_1171542] of patients achieved a complete 
response (CR) .  In the phase 2 study of relapsed or refractory systemic ALCL, the objective 
response rate (ORR) was 86%.  Due to few events of progression or death, the median 
duration of objective response was not estimable; however, the lower limit of the 95% 
confidence interval (CI) was 36 weeks.  Over 50% of patients achieved a CR.  Nearly all 
patients (>90%) in both studies experienced a reduction in tumor volume.  
Treatment -emergent adverse events (AEs) occurring in ≥20% of HL and systemic ALCL 
patients in the phase 2 studies were peripheral sensory neuropathy (44%), fatigue (42%), 
nausea (41% ), diarrhea (34%), pyrexia (31%), upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (28%), 
neutropenia (21%), and vomiting (20%).  These events were primarily Grade  1 or 2, with the 
exception of neutropenia, for which Grade  3 and Grade  4 events were reported for 13% and 
7% of patients, respectively.  Similar patterns and incidences of AEs were generally observed 
for HL and ALCL patients.  
 
Following the recommended intravenous (IV) dose of 1.8  mg/kg every 3 weeks, maximum 
concentrations were typi[INVESTIGATOR_843007] o f infusion.  A multi -exponential decline in 
brentuximab  vedotin  antibody -drug conjugate (ADC) serum concentrations was observed 
with a terminal half -life of approximately 4 to 6 days.  Exposures were approximately dose 
proportional.  After multiple -dose ad ministration of brentuximab  vedotin , steady -state was 
achieved by 21 days, consistent with the terminal half -life estimate.  Minimal to no 
accumulation was observed with multiple doses at the q3wk (every 3 weeks) schedule . 
 
The primary treatment -related ef fects of repeat -dose brentuximab  vedotin  administration to 
rats and monkeys , bone marrow hypocellularity and lymphoid depletion , and the associated 
decreases in peripheral blood cells are consistent with pharmacologic disruption of 
microtubules caused by M MAE.   Repeat -dose administration of MMAE caused qualitatively 
similar effects while no adverse effects were associated with the repeat -dose administration of 
cAC10.  The no -observed -adverse -effect level (NOAEL) for repeat -dose administration of 
brentuximab  vedotin  was 0.5 and 1 mg/kg in rat and monkey, respectively.  The highest 
non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) for repeat -dose administration of brentuximab  vedotin  was 
5 and 3  mg/kg in rat and monkey, respectively.  I n up to one -month repeat -dose toxicity 
studies of brentuximab  vedotin  in rats at doses up to 15 mg/kg, the  following target organs 
were identified:  bone marrow (hypocellularity ), thymus (lymphoid depletion), spleen 
(lymphoid depletion), liver (focal coagulative necrosis), intestine (single cell necrosis), testis 
(seminiferous tubular degeneration), and lung (alveolar histiocytosis ) in rat only.  Following a 
4-week recovery perio d, all target organ toxicity was reversible except for testicular toxicity.  
Testicular toxicity in rat was partially resolved following a 16 -week off -treatment recovery 
phase (Seattle Genetics, 2010 ).  
 
1.3 The CD30 Antigen in Mastocytosis  
 
CD30, a member  of the TNF -receptor (TNF -R) superfamily, is a transmembrane glycoprotein 
receptor and is normally found on the surface of activated T cells but has also been detected

hematological clonal non -mast cell lineage disease (AHNMD)  
______________________________________________________________________________________  
  Page 12 of 55  on a variety of cell types of hematopoietic origin.  The CD30 antigen has a very low 
expression on normal cells but is found on the Hodgkin Reed -Sternberg (RS) cells of HL and 
on ALCL and other T cell lymphoproliferative disorders.  While the function of CD30 has not 
been clearly defined, CD30 has been implicated both in cell death and prolif eration (Wahl 
2002) .  The utility of CD30 as a diagnostic marker for malignancies, including HL and ALCL, 
its limited normal tissue expression profile, and its apoptosis -inducing characteristics have led 
to the investigation of this antigen as a target for immunotherapy.  
Investigators Drs. Karl Sotlar, Hans -Peter Horny, and Peter Valent and colleagues recently 
identified expression of CD30 in neoplastic mast cells in the majority of patients with 
advanced SM (11/13, 85%), whereas in most patients with indolent SM, few of the neoplastic 
mast cells expressed CD30 ( Sotlar  et al. 2011, Valent  et al. 2011 ).  The mast cell leukemia 
cell line HMC -1, derived from a patient with aggressive SM also expressed CD30.  CD30 was 
not expressed in bone marrow biopsy samples from patients with reactive mast cell 
hyperplasia or other myeloid neoplasms.   CD30 expression has been observed  in some 
myeloid neoplasms (AML).  
1.4 Study Rationale  
 
Advanced forms of  systemic mastocytosis (eg, aggressive systemic mastocytosis [ASM] and 
mast cell leukemia [MCL] with or without an AHNMD) represent a large unmet need.  In 
order to address the challenge of these mast cell disorders, SGN -[ADDRESS_1171543] cells.

  Page 13 of 55  The primary efficacy endpoint is the overall response rate per consensus international 
response criteria (rate of complete + partial remissions + clinical improvement)  (see Appendix 
G).  Response rate per Valent  response criteria may be evaluated as part of an exploratory 
analysis.  
2.3.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints

samples or by [CONTACT_843044] -35 treatment and after 4 and 8 cycles of therapy  
 Total symptom score  and QOL score using a modified Myeloproliferative Neoplasm 
Symptom Assessment Form (MPN -SAF)  
 Duration of response (DoR) is defined as the time from  first onset of confirmed 
response to the date of first documented an d confirmed progression or death due to 
ASM /MCL .  Time to response (TTR) is defined as the time from start of treatment 
until the date of onset of  a confirmed response  
 Progression -free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from start of treatment to the 
date of the first documented and confirmed progression or death or institution of new 
therapy  
2.3.3 Secondary Safety Endpoints  
 Type, incidence, severity, seriousness, and relatedness of adverse events  
 Laboratory abnormalities  
3. Investigational Plan  
3.1 Overall study design  
 
This is a phase II  study designed to evaluate whether there is a signal of efficacy of SGN -35 
in patients with CD30+ advanced SM.  Advanced SM is defined as ASM or MCL with or 
without an  AHNMD . 
3.2 Discussion of design  
 
Patients will receive open label SGN -35 at a starting dose of 1.8 mg/kg administered as a 
single IV infusion as on Day [ADDRESS_1171545] 12 weeks, any clinical 
improvement (CI), partial response (PR), or CR response that commences by [CONTACT_843045] 8, and either persists or evolves into a higher quality response  for at least 12 weeks will 
be counted as a response.  Patients who demonstrate a response and subsequently meet criteria 
for loss of response (LOR) will be permitted to undergo re -staging and re -treatment with up to 
an additional 8 cycles of SGN -35.

preparation, administration, and storage are described in the Pharmacy Manual.  
4.2 Investigational Study Drug SGN -35 
4.2.1  Description  
Brentuximab  vedotin  is an ADC composed of a CD30 -targeted chimeric m onoclonal antibody 
(cAC10) that is covalently linked, via an enzyme -cleavable linker, to the anti -tubulin agent 
MMAE .  cAC10 has a typi[INVESTIGATOR_452938]1 subclass.   Brentuximab  vedotin  is 
produced by [CONTACT_843048]10.   Each antibody molecule has, on 
average, two of its interchain disulfides reduced and the resulting cysteine residues alkylated 
with SGD -1006 Intermediate (enzyme -cleavable inker + MMAE), l eading to a molar ratio of 
4 drug molecule s per antibody.  
Brentuxim ab vedotin  is a heterogeneous mixture of a range of drug -load variants and 
isoforms.  The overall average drug -to-antibody mole ratio (MR D) is approximately 4.  The 
calculated molecular mass for the nominal form of brentuximab  vedotin is approximately 
153 kDa.  
Pharmaceutical Properties   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pharmaceutical properties.  Brentuximab  vedotin  is a sterile, preservative -free, white 
to off -white lyophilized cake or powder, supplied in single -use vials.  Brentuximab  vedotin  
drug product is reconstituted with water for injection (WFI), [LOCATION_002] Pharmacopeia 
(USP) .  The reconstituted brentuximab  vedotin  drug product is a clear to slightly opalescent, 
colorless solution with no visible particulate matter.  The reconstituted solution is 
subsequently diluted i n sterile 0.9%  Sodium Chloride for Injection, USP, 5%  Dextrose 
Injection USP, or Lactated Ringer’s Injection USP, for IV administration.  
Brentuximab  vedotin  is the [LOCATION_003]N and the INN assigned to SGN -35.  Drug product vials may 
be labeled as SGN -35 or as brentuximab  vedotin ;  the [ADDRESS_1171553] not be administered as an IV push or bolus.  Study treatment will  
be administered by [CONTACT_843049] 30  minutes on  Day 1 of  
each 21 -day cycle.  In the absence of infusion toxicities, the infusion rate for all patients 
should  be calculated in order to achieve a 30 -minute infusion period.  Study treatment will be  
administered through a dedicated IV line and ca nnot be mixed with other medications.  
 
The dose of study treatment is 1.8 mg/kg.  Chemical and physical stability of the reconstituted 
brent uximab  vedotin drug product has been demonstrated for 24 hours .  Opened and 
reconstituted vials should be used immed iately.  If not used immediately, t he in -use storage 
should not be longer than 24  hours.  In case infusion is interrupted , the interruption cannot be 
more than 24  hrs from the time of reconstitution of the drug.

  Page [ADDRESS_1171554];  however, doses will be adjusted for 
patients who experience a ≥ 10% change in weight from baseline.  Actual weight will be used 
except for patients weighing greater than 100  kg; dose will be calculated based on [ADDRESS_1171555] whole number of milligrams 
(Seattle Genetics, 2010).  
 
Patients will be observed on day  1 for close monitoring of potential side effects of drug 
therapy and/or disease -related symptoms due to mast cell mediator release ( eg, hypotension, 
anaphylactic shock) for at least 60  minutes after comple tion of the infusion.  Intensive care 
equipment ( eg, crash  cart) and/or facilities must be readily avail able for these trial patients.

with optimal patient care will be given throughout the study according to institutional 
standards .  This includes adjusting the infusion time if necessary .  Medications for  
infusion -related reactions  should be readily available.  
 
Patients who experience a Grade  1 or 2 infusion -related reaction may receive  premedica tion 
for the current or future potential infusion reactions consisting of acetaminophen(650 mg 
orally) and diphenhydramine (25  to 50 mg orally or 10  to 25 mg IV) or according to 
institutional standards, administered 30  to 60 minutes prior to each 30 -minute  infusion.   
 
4.2.5  Dose Modifications  
 
Intra -patient dose reduction to 1.2 mg/kg  will be allowed depending on the type and severity  
of toxicity .  Table 1  describes the recommended dose modifications for study  
treatment -associated toxicity (toxicity with suspected relationship to SGN -35). 
 
Peripheral Neuropathy :  Peripheral neuropathy should be managed using a combination of  
dose delay and reduction to 1.2 mg/kg .  For new or worsening Grade  2 or 3 neuropathy, 
dosing  should be held until neuropathy improves to Grade  1 or baseline and then restarted at  
1.2 mg/kg .  For Grade  4 peripheral neuropathy, SGN -35 should be discontinued.

SGN -35 should be held for Grade  3 or 4 neutropenia until resolution to baseline or Grade  2 or 
lower.  Growth factor support should be considered for subsequent cycles in patients who  
experience Grade  3 or 4 neutropenia .  In patients with recurrent Grade  4 neu tropenia despi[INVESTIGATOR_843009], discontinuation or dose reduction of SGN -35 to 1.2 mg/kg  may be 
considered.  
 
Acute Pancreatitis :  Acute pancreatitis has been identified as an important potential risk  
associated with brentuximab  vedotin  dosing .  Dosing should be held until a diagnosis of acute 
pancreatitis has been excluded  if clinically suspected . 
 
The start of the next cycle may be delayed for up to 30 days if additional time is required for  
the patient to recover from study treatment -associate d toxicity experienced during the current  
cycle ( Table 1 ).  Delays of greater than [ADDRESS_1171557]. Jason Gotlib.  
Doses reduced for treatment -related toxicity should not be re -escalated.  
 
If 4 out of the 11  patients experience emergent drug -related Grade  3 or 4 non -hematologic 
toxicity, the study will be placed on hold for safety review, and if restarted upon study 
amendment, the starting dose of therapy for subsequent patients wo uld be no more than 
1.2 mg/kg .

CYP3A4 inhibitors than with inducers.  Where possible, investigators should refrain from 
choosing to administer CYP3A4/5 inducers to patients on study prior to initiation, and during 
treatment  with SGN -35.  In  particular, investigators should NOT give the combination of two 
such agents in patients receiving SGN -35, such as antifungal azoles plus  erythromycin or 
azithromycin.  In addition, prior to initiation of SGN -35, and during treatment, concomitant 
use of t he following CYP3A4 substrates  is discouraged: alprazolam, astemazole,

In patients whose response commences in later cycles before the end of cycle 8 ( eg, during 
cycle 6, 7, or 8), the duration of response will be assessed by [CONTACT_843052], performed every 6 weeks.  Patients who exhibit a response during 
cycles 1 -8 (or during cycles 9 -16), but subsequently demonstrate loss of response before 
cycle 8 is completed (or before cycle 16 is completed for patients being re -treated), such 
individuals will not be re -treated.  Retreatment after cycles 1 -8 is only applicable to 
patients who exhibit an ongoing response at the time of completion of cycle 8.  
 
In case report forms/study e -CRFs, the confirmed response will be denoted by a subscript 
'c', whereas initial responses or unconfirmed responses ( eg, responses not yet lasting 12

and physical examination will occur every six w eeks after completion of 8 cycles of therapy 
until week 48, then every 12 weeks.  
More frequent exams may be performed as clinically indicated .  Vital signs include heart rate, 
blood pressure, and body temperature .  Height  (in cms)  and weight (in kgs)  will be captured at 
baseline and weight  (in kgs)  will be captured at the beginning of each cycle.  ECOG status 
will be recorded at these visits.  
Information about the phy sical examination must be present in the source documentation at 
the stud y site .  Significant findings pre sent prior to the start of study drug must be included in 
the Relevant Medical History/Current Medical Conditions CRF .  Significant findings made 
after the start of study drug that meets the definition of an adverse event m ust be recorded on 
the CRF.  
Performance Status  
The ECOG Performance Status Scale will be used in this study (Appendix A).  
Hematology  
Hematology will include total white blood cell count with differential (neutrophil count 
lymphocyte, monocyte, eosinophil , basophil, mast cell, blast count, and immature 
granulocytes), hemo globin, hematocrit, platelet count and reticulocyte count (% and absolute).

completion of 8 cycles of therapy until week 48, then every 12 weeks .  For cycles 9 -16, end of 
treatment cycle 16 and end of study, chemistry labs should be repeated exactly as cycle 1 -8.  
Phosphorus is not to  be repeated after cycle 1 day 8.  
Coagulation   
Coagulation includes PT/INR and PTT.  These labs are required on screening, day 1 of each 
cycle during cycles 1 to 8, and at the end of treatment (EOT) after cycle 8,  or progressive 
disease, whichever comes f irst.  PT/INR and PTT are NOT required for re -staging, at cycles 
9-16, end of treatment cycle 16 and end of study.  
Serum Try ptase Level  
Serum tryptase levels are obtained at screening, day 1 of each cycle, at the end of treatment 
(EOT),  or at time of progr essive disease (whichever comes first), and/or at time of loss of 
response (LOR).  Serum tryptase will also be drawn on day +30 after EOT  in non -responders; 
in responders, serum tryptase level will be drawn every six weeks after completi on of 8 cycles 
of therapy until week 48, then every 12 weeks.  If the serum tryptase assay sensitivity does 
not permit recording of specific values above 200 ng/ml, the sample should be diluted to 
obtain a specific serum tryptase value rather than a non -specific value of ">200 ng/ml" .  
For cycles [ADDRESS_1171575] will be obtained relevant patients during screening, day 1, and on day 1 of 
each treatment c ycle for cycles 1 - 8 (patients who need re -treatment will undergo pregnancy 
testing during re -staging and during potential re -treatment cycles ie, cycles 9 -16).  Pregnancy 
test will be done at the end of cycle 8 (end of treatment) and if re -staged, end of treatment

7.6 Secondary Objectives  
7.6.1  Safety evaluation  
The assessment of safety will be based on the frequency of adverse events and on the number 
of laboratory values that fall outside of pre -determined ranges .  Other safety data will be 
considered as appropriate.  
Adverse events will b e summarized by [CONTACT_357953], having an adverse event in each body system and having each 
individual adverse event .  Any other information collected ( eg, severity or relatedness to study 
medicati on) will be listed as appropriate.  
Laboratory data will be summarized by [CONTACT_18676] 
(baseline to most extreme post -baseline value), by [CONTACT_843057] (mean s, medians, standard deviations, ranges) and by [CONTACT_843058].  
Data from other tests will be listed, notable values will be flagged, and any other information 
collected will be listed as appropriate .  Any statistical tests  performed to explore the data will 
be used only to highlight any interesting comparisons that may warrant further consideration.

(MPNSAF)  modified for Mast Cell Symptoms  
 
 Total symptom score and QOL will be assessed by a modified version of the MPNSAF 
(modified for mast cell symptoms)  by [CONTACT_843061] - and post -treatment with  SGN -35 (Appendix F).  
7.6.4  Duration of Response  (DoR) and Time to Response (TTR)  
The duration of (confirmed) overall response  (DoR)  is defined as the time from the start of the 
first confirmed response until the date of the first documented and confirmed disease 
progression  or death due to ASM or MCL .  The Kaplan -Meier product -limit method  will be 
used to summarize  the response duration .  If a patient did not progress or die due to ASM or 
MCL at the time of the analyses, D oR will be censored at the date of the last adequate 
response assessment . 
Time to response (TTR) is defined as the time from the date of start of treatment  to the date of 
first confirmed response .  Time to response will be censored at the date of the last adequate 
response  assessment in patients  did not progress or die due to any cause and at maximum 
follow -up date ( ie, date of first patient first visit (FPFV) to date of last patient last visit 
(LPLV) used for the analysis) in patients who progressed or died due to any cause .  
Kaplan -Meier product -limit estimates will be used to summariz e the time to response.  
7.6.5  Progression -free survival (PFS)  and overall survival  
Progression -free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of start of treatment until 
the date of first documented confirmed disease progression or death or institution of new 
therapy .  If a patient did not progress or die due to any cause at the time of the analyses, PFS 
will be censored at the date of the last adequate response assessment .  Kaplan -Meier 
product -limit estimates will be used to summarize  PFS.  For overall survival, patients will be 
contact[CONTACT_457] 6 months until the study closure or death.  
7.7 Interim analyses  
An interim analysis will be provided after enrolling 11 evaluable patients, as described in 
Section 7.8.  
7.8 Sample size and power consi derations  
 
A study of brentuximab vedotin (SGN -35) in CD30 -positive systemic mastocytosis with or without an associated 
hematological clonal non -mast cell lineage disease (AHNMD)  
 
  Page 38 of 55  The primary endpoint is res ponse rate per international consensus response criteria (see 
Appendix G).  
 
The trial will be carried out as a Simon two -stage Optimum design with a total potential 
sample size of 26 patients  (Simon R, 1989).   The first stage will be this investigator -initiated 
phase II  study of 11 patients.  We assume that the probability of accepting the treatment when 
the true response rate is < 10% is less than or equal to 10%, and the probability of rejecting 
the treatmen t when the true response rate is ≥  30% is less than or equal to 15%.  
Under these assumptions, the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_235841]:  Accrue a cohort of [ADDRESS_1171589] stage phase II  study .  If 2 or more patients out of 11 respond, the study will b e 
amended to enroll an additional 15 patients in the second stage .  If less than 2 responses are 
seen, the study will be halted.  At the end of the second stage, if 5 or more patients out of 26 
respond, the regimen will be considered for further investigat ion in the treatment of advanced 
mastocytosis.  With this design, the chance of falsely claiming that regimen is efficacious 
(alpha) is 8.7%, and the power is 85% .  The probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_30492] 70% under the 
null hypothesis of a 10% response rate i s 10%; it is 11% if the true response rate is 30%.  
8 Procedures and instructions  
8.1 Special safety -related procedures  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or 
worsens in severity during the course of  the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries 
should be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are 
considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
 results in study withdrawal  
 is associated with a serious adverse event  
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
 is considered by [CONTACT_118296] -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any 
AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening  
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
 results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 an important medical event  
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are 
clearly o f major clinical significance.  They may jeopardize the subject, and may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, 
drug overdose or abus e, a seizure that did not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or

hematological clonal non -mast cell lineage disease (AHNMD)  
 
  Page [ADDRESS_1171590] administration of study treatment .  
Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting 
condition should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the 
character of the condition worsens during the study period .  
General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting 
condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities 
that meet the definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an 
adverse event .  
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_16469], the subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At 
the last scheduled visit, the inve stigator should instruct each subject to report any 
subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might 
reasonably be related to participation in this study.  The investigator should notify the 
study sponsor of any dea th or adverse event occurring at any time after a subject has 
discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this 
study.  The sponsor should also be notified if the investigator should become aware of 
the development of ca ncer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived 
offspring of a subject that has participated in this study .  
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if any one 
of the following  condi tions is met :  
 The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm 
the abnormality  
 The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
 The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; eg, change of 
dose, disc ontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further 
diagnostic investigation, etc.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_843024] a nd reported as a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed 
otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented 
as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for and adverse event .

hematological clonal non -mast cell lineage disease (AHNMD)  
 
  Page 40 of 55  Neither the condit ion, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are 
reported as an adverse event in the following circumstances:  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5110] a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an 
outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or 
diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5111].  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5112], unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_580416].  
Recording of Adverse Events  
At each contact [CONTACT_4490] t he subject, the investigator must seek information on adverse events by 
[CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events 
should be recorded immediately in the source document, and entered on the appropriate case 
report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures 
results should recorded in the source document, though should be grouped under one 
diagnosis.  
All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.   The clinical course of 
each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined 
that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still 
ongoing at the end of the study perio d must be followed up to determine the final outcome.  
Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly 
related to the study treatment or study participation should be recorded and reported 
immediately.

Criteria to Diagnose Systemic Mastocytosis (SM Criteria)  
_________________________________________________________________________________  
Major criterion     Multifocal dense infiltrates of mast cells (>[ADDRESS_1171605] cells in  
     aggregates) in bone marrow biopsies and/or in sections  
     of other extracutaneous organ(s)  
 
Minor criteria     a.  >25% of all mast cells are atypi[INVESTIGATOR_70356] (type I or type II)  
     On bone marrow smears or are spi[INVESTIGATOR_86853] -shaped in mast cell  
     Infiltrates detected on sections of visceral organs  
 
b. c-kit point mutation at codon [ADDRESS_1171606] cells in bone marrow or blood or another  
extracutaneous organ express CD2 or/and CD25  
 
d. Baseline serum tryptase concentration > 20 ng/ml  
(in the case of an unrelated myeloid neoplasm, (d) is not  
valid as an SM criterion)  
_________________________________________________________________________________  
If at least one major and one minor or three minor crite ria are fulfilled, then the diagnosis is systemic  
Mastocytosis=SM.

Aggressive Systemic Mastocytosis  
Meets criteria for SM  
One or more “C” findings  
No associated clo nal hematologic malignancy/disorder (AHNMD)*  
No evidence of mast cell leukemia  
 
*Patients with aggressive systemic mastocytosis who also are found to have an AHNMD  
are eligible for this protocol  
 
Mast Cell Leukemia  
Meets criteria for SM  
Biopsy shows a diff use infiltration, usually interstitial pattern, by [CONTACT_32593][INVESTIGATOR_2855], immature mast cells  
Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_843030] 20% or more mast cells  
Mast cells account for 10% or more of peripheral blood white cells  
 
NOTE:   Patients may also be enrolled if mast cells account for <10% of the peripheral blood white 
blood cells; such patients are considered to be in the pre -phase of mast cell leukemia and are referred 
to as “aleukemic mast cell leukemia.”

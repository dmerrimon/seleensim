Title of Study: A Multicenter, Double-blind, Randomized, Placebo-controlled Study to Evaluate the 
Efficacy and Safety of Nemolizumab in Subjects with Chronic Kidney Disease with 
Associated Moderate to Severe Pruritus
Protocol Number: RD.06.SPR.204358
Investigators/Study 
Sites:Approximately 70 study sites are planned in North America and Europe
Phase of 
Development:Phase 2/3
Objectives: Primary objective: The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of nemolizumab 
compared to placebo at reducing the intensity of pruritus after a 12-week treatment 
period in adult hemodialysis subjects with moderate to severe pruritus.
Secondary objectives: The secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety of 
nemolizumab compared to placebo, and to assess the  and 
optimal dose in adult hemodialysis subjects with moderate to severe pruritus.
Study Design: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group, 
phase 2/3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nemolizumab in adult subjects 
with CKD-aP.
Subjects will be randomized in one of the three arms/groups (two different doses of 
nemolizumab and a placebo) in a 1:1:1 ratio: 
Group 1: 30 mg nemolizumab Q4W with a 60 mg loading dose at baseline;
Group 2: 60 mg nemolizumab Q4W without loading dose at baseline;
Group 3: placebo Q4W. 
Approximately 84 subjects will be randomized in each nemolizumab group and in the 
placebo group for a total sample size of approximately 252 subjects.
In order to maintain the blind, all subjects will receive 2 injections at each 
administration (30 mg + 30 mg or 30 mg + placebo or placebo + placebo). 
The study consists of a screening period (up to 4 weeks), a 12-week treatment period, 
and an 8-week follow up period ([ADDRESS_364021] study drug injection).
The screening period will evaluate subject eligibility. The subjects’ other (non-pruritus) 
complications of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are to be managed according to 
local standard of care. The use of moisturizers is encouraged to keep the skin hydrated.
At the baseline visit, subjects will receive an initial dose of nemolizumab 60 mg or 
placebo by [CONTACT_298435] (SC) injections. Study drug treatment with either 
nemolizumab or placebo should start after completion of the hemodialysis treatment 
(within four hours). Then study drug (i.e., nemolizumab 30 mg, nemolizumab 
60 mg, or placebo) will be administered via two SC injections (30 mg + placebo or 30 
mg + 30 mg or placebo + placebo) every four weeks (Q4W) at Week 4 and 8 after 
completion of the hemodialysis treatment (within four hours).  are to be 
taken before hemodialysis. Refer to the figure below.

subcutaneous injection. 
Population: adult hemodialysis patients with chronic 
kidney disease and associated moderate to severe pruritus 
(will be estimated in the Intent-to-Treat analysis set).
Variable: a binary composite response where:
Responder is defined as an improvement ≥  4 in WI NRS 
from baseline at Week 12 without use of rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_298361]/death related to study drug.
Non-responder is defined as an improvement < 4 in WI 
NRS from baseline at Week 12 or use of rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_298362]/death related to study drug.
Strategies for Intercurrent Events: A composite strategy 
was chosen for the use of rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_298363]/death related 
to study drug; in case of use of rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_298364]/death related to study drug, subjects will be considered 
as treatment failures in the binary composite response. In 
the case of treatment discontinuation for any other reason, 
a treatment policy strategy will be used and observed after 
discontinuation data (if available) will be used.In adult hemodialysis

pruritus), rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_298367]. Subjects receiving rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_298368].
As a general guideline and per individual investigator judgment, rescue therapy should 
not be prescribed within the first four weeks after baseline to allow a minimum time for 
study drug potential effect in the presence of background therapy. 
Investigator assessments of efficacy should be performed before initiating rescue 
therapy. Subjects requiring rescue therapy between scheduled visits should return to 
the clinic (unscheduled visit) for investigator assessment of efficacy before starting 
rescue therapy. The Investigator must contact [CONTACT_298444].

randomized subjects who receive all scheduled doses of study drug and have 
Baseline and Week [ADDRESS_364034] efficacy.
Safety Population: The safety population will include all randomized 
subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug.
  
The ITT population will be the primary population for all efficacy analyses. The mITT 
and PP populations will be used for the supplementary analysis of the primary 
endpoint.  
Efficacy Analysis
A summary based on observed case (OC) will be provided for all primary, secondary, 
and exploratory efficacy endpoints. At this case, no data will be imputed. For this 
summary, if any rescue medication is received or treatment is discontinued, and data 
are collected post-rescue receipt or treatment discontinuation, then the data post-rescue 
or post-discontinuation will be summarized as observed.
Proportion of subjects with WI NRS/SD NRS ≥ 4 and WI NRS ≥ 3, changes and 
percent changes from baseline of WI NRS/SD NRS at each week (from week 1 
through week 20) will be calculated on the basis of the weekly average, obtained by 
[CONTACT_298446] 4 daily WI NRS/SD NRS scores over 7-day periods. If fewer than 4 
daily WI NRS/SD NRS scores for the 7-day period (for baseline and week 12 wider 
periods apply) are available, weekly average WI NRS/SD NRS will be considered 
missing for that period. For the aim of sensitivity analyses, weekly averages of WI 
NRS obtained by [CONTACT_298446] 3, 2 and 1 daily scores over 7-day periods will be 
calculated (no period extension at baseline and week 12 applies for these weekly 
averages). For detailed rules, refer to section 19.3.
Data of both nemolizumab groups (30 mg and 60 mg) and placebo group and 
comparisons versus placebo group of both nemolizumab groups will be presented.
Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint
The proportion of subjects with an improvement of WI NRS ≥ 4 from baseline will be 
analyzed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by [CONTACT_85229]; 
strata-adjusted difference in proportions between treatment groups and the 97.5% 
confidence interval (CI) of the difference will be based on the large sample 
approximation method for binary data.
Analysis of Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
The following key secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the Cochran-
Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by [CONTACT_85229]; strata-adjusted difference in 
proportions between treatment groups and the 97.5% confidence interval of the 
difference will be based on the large sample approximation method for binary data.

Analysis Centers
Prior to database lock, a review of the blinded data will be performed to determine the 
size of each center. If there are centers with a small number of randomized subjects 
(i.e., centers with less than 12 randomized subjects), then these centers will be pooled 
in order for analyses to be carried out. The process of combining centers will be based 
on the ITT population, and same pooling will be repeated for mITT population and PP 
population.
Handling of Missing Data
Missing data for dichotomous efficacy endpoints will be imputed using multiple 
imputations (MI) under missing at random (MAR) assumption for the primary/main 
analyses. Dichotomous endpoints will be calculated from the underlying imputed 
variable.
For the sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint, missing data will be imputed using

that the pattern of missing data will be monotonic, with slight deviations being 
corrected by [CONTACT_298447] (MCMC) method of the MI procedure. A 
predictive mean matching method will be used for the continuous data with the 
following covariates included in the imputation model: non-missing data from earlier 
time points. Separate imputations by [CONTACT_298448]. Changes and

8.1 Background on Chronic Kidney Disease with associated Pruritus
Chronic kidney disease with associated pruritus (CKD-aP) is a common, troubling and, in 
some cases, debilitating problem for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 
end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). It’s characterized by [CONTACT_298452] a daily basis including adverse medical 
outcomes and poor quality of life (QoL).
A survey conducted in Japan in 2000 revealed that 72.8% of hemodialysis patients have 
experienced pruritus and that around half of these individuals have suffered from sleep 
disturbance ( Omori 2001). Furthermore, the extent of sleeplessness among patients with 
CKD-aP reportedly increased as the itching became more severe ( Narita 2006, Kimata 2014). 
The Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study conducted in 12 countries found that 
approximately 41.7% of tracked patients had at least moderate pruritus and reduced sleep 
quality ( Pi[INVESTIGATOR_144786] 2006). Severe pruritus is also a purported risk factor for poor prognosis among 
dialysis patients ( Narita 2006).
More recently (i.e., 2012-2015), an international comparison on the prevalence of pruritis in 
hemodialysis patients found that 68% of survey respondents reported they were at least 
somewhat bothered by [CONTACT_298453] (31% somewhat; 19% moderately; 11% very much; 
7% extremely). Of the patients that were very much or extremely bothered by [CONTACT_298453], 
84% were also bothered by [CONTACT_298454], and 60% had sleep restlessness. Similar findings were 
reported in country specific regions such as the US and throughout Europe ( Rayner 2017).
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a prevalence rate and a clear association with poorer psychosocial and medical 
outcomes including higher mortality risk ( Pi[INVESTIGATOR_144786] 2006), this condition is often underreported 
by [CONTACT_298455]. In one survey, the rate of pruritis in 
hemodialysis patients was underestimated by [CONTACT_298456] 69% ( Rayner 2017). This 
is likely due, in part, to uncertainty regarding its pathogenesis and treatment. Conventional 
treatments include changing the dialysis conditions or using highly biocompatible dialysis 
membranes, regulating calcium and phosphorus concentrations, treating the secondary 
hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), topi[INVESTIGATOR_298377], drug 
therapy with antihistamines or anti-allergic agents, and ultraviolet (UV) phototherapy. 
Nevertheless, these treatments often prove ineffective ( Kfoury 2012).
The cause of CKD-aP has been attributed to various factors including accumulation of uremic 
substances, elevated serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations, SHPT, dialysis 
membrane-induced complement activation or heparin, induction of endogenous itch 
mediators (e.g., histamines, serotonin, substance P), immune system abnormalities, and 
endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_298378]. However, the precise mechanism of onset is still unclear.
In Japan, nalfurafine hydrochloride was launched in 2009 for the indication of improvement 
of pruritus in hemodialysis patients when response to conventional treatments is inadequate. 
However, the degree of improvement in pruritus after taking nalfurafine hydrochloride has 
varied among patients ( Yamada 2012), and 19.4% of clinical trial subjects experienced 
insomnia (sleep disturbance) as an adverse reaction (AR) to the drug ( Kumagai 2012). On 
23 AUG 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration granted NDA approval through priority 
review for difelikefalin for the treatment of moderate to severe pruritus in hemodialysis

Page 29 of 123patients ( Fishbane 2020), thus highlighting the need for further investigations into treatment 
options that possesses both adequate efficacy and a high level of safety for this population.
A 2014 study by [CONTACT_298457]. investigated the relationship between CKD-aP and serum 
interleukin (IL-31) concentrations in 178 patients undergoing hemodialysis ( Ko 2014). The 
study found that serum IL-31 concentrations were higher in patients with pruritus than in 
those without pruritus and that some of the patients with pruritus had serum IL-31 
concentrations that exceeded 100 pg/mL. The study also found a correlation between serum 
IL-31 concentration and the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score of pruritus intensity in patients 
whose serum IL-[ADDRESS_364063].
8.2 Background on Nemolizumab
Nemolizumab is a humanized anti-human IL-31 receptor A (RA) monoclonal antibody that 
inhibits the binding of IL-31 to IL-31RA and subsequent signal transduction. The 
T-cell-derived cytokine IL-31 has been suggested to be a key player in the development of 
pruritus, inducing severe pruritus and dermatitis in mouse models ( Dillon 2004, Arai 2013). 
IL-31 binds to a heterodimeric receptor at TRPV1 (+)/TRPA1 (+)-Cfibres, keratinocytes, 
macrophages and eosinophils, and thus may be involved in transmission of pruritus and 
promotion of inflammation. Not limited to the skin, the densest area of this receptor seems to 
be at the dorsal horn of spi[INVESTIGATOR_298379] 
(Sonkoly 2006). Therefore, IL-[ADDRESS_364064] in patients with CKD-aP, atopic dermatitis (AD), and 
prurigo nodularis (PN) not adequately controlled by [CONTACT_298458].
Nemolizumab was initially developed by [CONTACT_298459]., Ltd., a Japanese based 
pharmaceutical company; it was subsequently licensed to Galderma (sponsor) in [ADDRESS_364065] not been fully evaluated by [CONTACT_298460].
8.3 Clinical Studies with Nemolizumab
The Investigator’s Brochure (IB) contains detailed information on clinical and non-clinical 
studies. Summaries of completed and ongoing clinical studies of nemolizumab in CKD-aP, 
AD, and PN are included in the IB. The CKD-ap phase 2a study is outlined below.

Page 30 of 1238.3.1 Phase 2a Study in Subjects with CKD-aP
Study CIM106JP was a Phase 2a study conducted in adult hemodialysis subjects with uremic 
pruritus (Kinugasa 2021). The study was a randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel four arm study with three doses of blinded study drug (CIM331; 
Chugai’s internal code for nemolizumab) or placebo, and an open-label reference product 
arm (nalfurafine hydrochloride group). Study duration was [ADDRESS_364067] placebo. Secondary endpoints included Pruritus VAS score, and the Shiratori severity 
score. (The Shiratori severity score is a Japanese itch severity questionnaire, which includes 
separate set of questions for both daytime and nighttime. Each set of questions consists of 
[ADDRESS_364068] and 0 being absent. Grade 3 or higher on each 
scale was considered moderate to severe pruritus). 5-D itch scale score and mean in absolute 
change from baseline at each evaluation time point up to week 12, and  
), safety. A total of 69 subjects were enrolled:15 subjects in the nemolizumab 0.125 
mg/kg group, 14 subjects in the placebo and nemolizumab 2.0 mg/kg groups, and 13 subjects 
in the nemolizumab 0.5 mg/kg and nalfurafine hydrochloride groups). There were not 
statistically significant differences between the placebo group and each nemolizumab group 
in the absolute changes in pruritus VAS at Week 4 the primary efficacy endpoint. The LSM 
absolute changes in pruritus VAS (95% CI) at Week 4, the primary efficacy parameter, were 
−32.09 mm (−44.40 mm, −19.78 mm) in the placebo group, and −34.50 mm (−46.73 mm, 
−22.28 mm), −40.82 mm (−53.61 mm, −28.04 mm), and −31.74 mm (−43.97 mm, 
−19.51 mm) in the CIM331 0.125, 0.5, and 2.0 mg/kg groups, respectively.
In all groups including the placebo group, remarkable improvements in pruritus VAS were 
observed by [CONTACT_10585] 4. 
In all groups including the placebo group, improvements in the secondary efficacy 
parameters, pruritus VAS, Shiratori severity score, and 5-D itch score, were observed by 
[CONTACT_10585] 4, and there was no clear difference between the placebo group and each nemolizumab 
group. 
However, post hoc analyses conducted in the proportion of subjects achieving a pruritus VAS 
score of less than 30 mm (corresponding to “no or mild pruritus”) showed approximately 
two-fold higher proportion in the 0.5 mg/kg group compared to that in the placebo group at 
Week 4. 
The proportion of subjects with decrease in VAS ≥  30 or ≥ 40 mm, proportion of subjects 
with VAS ≤ 2 or with VAS 0 -1 from baseline in all dose groups of nemolizumab were higher 
than that in the placebo group at week 4. Again, the 0.5 mg/kg dose provide the best efficacy 
profile compared to the two other tested doses.
The placebo effect of this study has been higher than expected. This could be explained by 
[CONTACT_298461], compared to open-label nalfurafine, the treatment subjects has received prior 
to randomization into the study. Therefore, the placebo effect might have been biased by

Page 31 of 123subjects had experienced with nalfurafine before entering the study. Consistent with the 
explanation, open-label nalfurafine performed inferior to placebo.
 
 
 
Overall, no clinically significant (CS) safety findings were reported in the nemolizumab 
groups.
8.4 Risk/Benefit Assessment
Results of previous clinical studies in adults demonstrated that treatment with nemolizumab 
had a marked effect on AD and PN, pruritus, and pruritus-related sleep loss. Nemolizumab 
was also well tolerated overall when used as monotherapy or concomitantly with a TCS.
Based on the currently available information on nemolizumab and the risks associated with 
biologic agents in general, the potential risks of nemolizumab treatment include local or 
systemic IRRs, newly diagnosed asthma or worsening of asthma, and skin or non-skin 
infections. Refer to the IB for the most current risk/benefits.
The following specific risk-minimization and safety follow-up measures have been planned 
in this clinical study: 
a. In a phase 2b study for Atopic dermatitis indication (SPR.114322), a dose-dependent 
increase of asthma flares (1 [1.8%], 2 [3.6%], 7 [12.3%], and 10 [17.5%] in placebo, 
10 mg, 30 mg, and 90 mg treatment arms, respectively) in subjects with pre-existing 
asthma was observed. Events were mostly mild or moderate (one severe event with 
highest dose), manageable, and reversible under treatment with study drug. This 
protocol (SPR. 204358) will exclude subjects with asthma exacerbation requiring 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_298354] 12 months before screening, subjects whose asthma 
has not been well controlled (i.e., symptoms > 2 days per week, nighttime awakenings 
two or more times per week, or some interference with normal activities) during the 
last three months before the screening visit, and Asthma Control Test (ACT) score ≤ 
19. At all visits, all subjects will be asked about respi[INVESTIGATOR_298380] a respi[INVESTIGATOR_298381]. At screening and baseline conduct PEF for all 
subjects and ACT for subjects with medical history of asthma. After baseline ACT 
and PEF are only required for subjects with a medical history of asthma. Subjects 
diagnosed with de novo asthma will perform PEF and ACT assessments at all visits 
starting with the visit in which the diagnosis was confirmed. Subjects with a medical 
history of asthma will be referred to the physician managing their asthma if ACT ≤  
19,  with signs and symptoms suggestive of asthma, and/or unexpected worsening of 
asthma is observed or reported, PEF value is used as supplemental information. 
Subjects without a medical history of asthma will be referred to a respi[INVESTIGATOR_298382]. An 
independent adjudication committee (IAC) will review and adjudicate all asthma AEs 
reported during the course of the study. PEF value is used as supplemental 
information as well.

Page 32 of 123b. The exclusion criteria of this clinical study (i.e., restricting entry of subjects with 
recent/current infections or known/suspected immunosuppression or unusually 
frequent, recurrent, severe, or prolonged infections) will prevent non-eligible subjects 
at potentially higher risk of infection from receiving nemolizumab. As no data are 
available in pregnant or breastfeeding women, these subjects are not eligible for this 
study. Subjects who have recently received live vaccines may be considered for 
enrollment after an appropriate time has elapsed before baseline/Day 1. 
Administration of live attenuated vaccines and non-live vaccine is prohibited during 
the study. 
c. A slight trend of dose-dependent increase of peripheral edema was reported in the 
nemolizumab study CIM003JG. Most events were mild (11 of 21), no case was 
serious, and none resulted in premature treatment discontinuation; no case was 
associated with renal or cardiac AEs. The EASI values and thymus and activation 
regulated chemokine levels were relatively higher in subjects with peripheral edema 
indicating that peripheral edema might be related to more severe AD. There were a 
few subjects reporting peripheral edema in study SPR.114322 (2 [3.6%], 2 [3.6%], 
4 [7%], and 2 [3.5%] in placebo, 10 mg, 30 mg, and 90 mg groups, respectively). 
Peripheral edema will be followed as an AE of special interest (AESI) in this study. 
Recognizing that peripheral edema occurs commonly in dialysis patients related to 
their overall volume status, dialysis treatment, and other factors, peripheral edema is 
only to be reported as an AESI if assessed by [CONTACT_53596] a reasonable 
possibility for a relationship to study drug.
d. An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will monitor the safety data 
regularly throughout the study, including AESIs, which were defined based on the 
currently available safety information on nemolizumab and the risks associated with 
biologic agents in general. AESIs for this study are: 
oIRRs
- Anaphylactic reactions
- Acute allergic reactions requiring treatment
- Severe injection site reactions with a duration greater than 24 hours
oNewly diagnosed asthma or worsening of asthma
oInfections
- Any severe infection or any infection requiring treatment with 
parenteral antibiotics or with oral antibiotics/antivirals/antifungals for 
> 2 weeks
- Any confirmed or suspected coronavirus disease (COVID-19) 
infection

In conclusion, when taking into consideration the currently available data of nemolizumab 
and the risk-minimization approaches to be implemented, the benefit/risk ratio of 
nemolizumab is considered to be favorable in this study.
8.5 Drug Profile
Nemolizumab is a humanized monoclonal modified immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) antibody 
comprising a structure of 2 H-chains (445 amino acid residues) and 2 L-chains (214 amino 
acid residues) connected by [ADDRESS_364072] will be supplied 
as a lyophilized powder for solution for SC injection only after reconstitution in a pre-filled, 
dual-chamber, single-use syringe (DCS). The lyophilized nemolizumab powder (39 mg) and 
solution for reconstitution (0.595 mL) are stored in separate syringe chambers, with each 
DCS designed to deliver a 30 mg dose of nemolizumab. The concentration of nemolizumab 
in the DCS will be 61.5 mg/mL once reconstituted, with an injection volume of 0.49 mL (for 
the loading dose, two injections of 0.49 mL).
The placebo will be supplied as a lyophilized powder, reconstituted and administered in the 
same manner as the investigational product.
8.6 Study and Dose Selection Rationale
Based on data suggesting the role of IL-31 in the pathophysiology of CKD-aP ( Ko 2014), 
Chugai conducted a Phase 2a study (study CIM106JP) to assess the efficacy and safety of 
ascending nemolizumab single doses (0.1 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg and 2.0 mg/kg) in subjects with 
CKD-aP undergoing hemodialysis. The data from this study were reviewed during an 
advisory board meeting held in October [ADDRESS_364073] hoc analysis, the results indicated that nemolizumab was well tolerated 
and nemolizumab 0.5 mg/kg single dose was associated with the higher magnitude of effect 
on pruritus VAS. Consensual recommendation initially from the experts was to move forward 
with nemolizumab in subjects suffering from CKD-aP focusing first on subjects with severe 
pruritus as assessed by [CONTACT_298463] 7.0 and undergoing hemodialysis, therefore that 
was the approach in the original protocol.

Galderma SA/Galderma Research & Development, LLC CD14152.SPR.[ADDRESS_364075] is unlikely driven by [CONTACT_298464], based on the following findings: 
1) Treatment effect including placebo effect observed from Difelifekalin pi[INVESTIGATOR_298383]. moderate plus severe pruritus HD pts and 2) Further review of the 
Chugai HD CKD phase 2a study (CIM106JP) 0.5mg/kg group (nemolizumab n= 12; placebo 
n=12), there was no different treatment pattern that could be identified between the group 
with VAS > 70 mm and VAS <70 mm at baseline. Thus, the protocol is amended (version 4, 
08JUN22) to include Hemodialysis patients with both moderate to severe pruritus as assessed 
by [CONTACT_298463] 5.
Of note, it is acknowledged that patient population of CKD-aP is a new population and there 
is limited data available from the completed Phase 2a dose ranging trial to definitely conclude 
that there is a lack of effect of body weight on efficacy. Therefore, an additional 60 mg flat 
dose (without loading dose) will be assessed in this study and will provide data to decide on 
the need for weight-based dosing in subjects with higher body weight. 
At the end of this study, dose selection will be based on the final analysis by [CONTACT_298465]-benefit and considering the potential impact of body weight.

10.1 Description of Overall Study Design and Plan
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group, phase 2/3 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nemolizumab in adult subjects with CKD-aP.  
Subjects will be randomized in one of the following three arms/groups (two different doses of 
nemolizumab and a placebo) in a 1:1:1 ratio: 
Group 1: 30 mg nemolizumab Q4W with a 60 mg loading dose at baseline;
Group 2: 60 mg nemolizumab Q4W without loading dose at baseline;
Group 3: placebo Q4W. 
Approximately 84 subjects will be randomized in each nemolizumab group and in the 
placebo group for a total sample size of approximately 252 subjects.
In order to maintain the blind, all subjects will receive 2 injections at each administration 
(30 mg + 30 mg or 30 mg + placebo or placebo + placebo). 
The study consists of a screening period (up to 4 weeks), a 12-week treatment period, and an 
8-week follow up period ([ADDRESS_364080] study drug injection).
The screening period will evaluate subject eligibility. In exceptional circumstances, e.g. 
health reason or hemodialysis rescheduling, up to 72 hours deviation from screening window 
may be permitted after consultation with the Medical Monitor. The subjects’ other (non-
pruritus) complications of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are to be managed according to 
local standard of care. The use of moisturizers is encouraged to keep the skin hydrated.
At the baseline visit, subjects will receive an initial dose of nemolizumab 60 mg or placebo 
by [CONTACT_298443]. Study drug treatment with either nemolizumab or placebo should start 
after completion of the hemodialysis treatment (within four hours). Then study drug (i.e., 
nemolizumab 30 mg, nemolizumab 60 mg or placebo) will be administered via two SC 
injections (30 mg + placebo, 30 mg + 30 mg, or placebo + placebo) Q4W at Week 4 and 
Week 8 after completion of hemodialysis treatment (within four hours). PK samples to be 
taken before hemodialysis. Refer to Section 13.1.

10.1.1 Study Visit Schema
10.2 Discussion of Study Design
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of nemolizumab in adult subjects with 
CKD-aP undergoing hemodialysis. The rationale for the study is based on the prior Phase 2a 
study (study CIM106JP) conducted by [CONTACT_456]’s licensing partner, and the 
recommendation from experts in the field of Nephrology and Dermatology to further 
investigate nemolizumab in subjects with CKD-aP. The rationale for the nemolizumab

the start of screening. Other main inclusion criteria include hemodialysis adequacy (i.e., 
single-pool Kt/V measurements of at least 1.2), pruritis for ≥  3 months (documented pruritus 
with no etiology identified other than CKD by [CONTACT_38825], previous physician’s 
letter/statement, or  written documentation by [CONTACT_298466]), and a WI NRS score of ≥ 5.0 at the screening and baseline visit.
Following the screening period, qualified subjects will receive a loading dose of 
nemolizumab 60 mg or placebo by [CONTACT_298442] (30 mg + 30 mg, placebo + 
placebo), and a 30 mg or 60 mg dose of nemolizumab or placebo by [CONTACT_298443] 
(30 mg + placebo, 30 mg + 30 mg, placebo + placebo) at Weeks 4 and 8. All study drug 
treatments should be performed following the completion of the hemodialysis (within four 
hours). Subsequent visits will occur at Week 12 and Week 20 (end of study). A 12-week 
treatment period is considered adequate to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nemolizumab 
on pruritus based on the results of Phase 2a study and finding from other nemolizumab 
indications. The efficacy assessments are performed using validated scales that are commonly 
employed in pruritus clinical trials to capture subject-reported outcomes. 
The primary endpoint is the proportion of subject with an improvement of WI NRS ≥ 4 from 
baseline at Week 12. The selected endpoints for assessing the and safety of nemolizumab 
are in accordance with current standards, as are the safety endpoints of the study. 
Differences may be detectable during the study drug reconstitution process between active 
study drug and placebo but appear similar after reconstitution is complete (approximately 
10 minutes). Throughout the study, a pharmacist (or other qualified personnel) will prepare 
study medication for injection, including confirmation of complete reconstitution, prior to 
delivery of study medication for injection. The pharmacist (or other qualified personnel) 
preparing study medication should not be involved with any study assessments and should 
not discuss any aspects of study drug reconstitution with the subject/caregiver or study staff 
involved in subject interviews or study assessments.
If deemed to be medically necessary by [CONTACT_093] (e.g. to control intolerable pruritus) 
and after discussion with the Medical Monitor, rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_298388]. Subjects receiving 
rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_298389].
As a general guideline and per individual investigator judgment, rescue therapy should not be 
prescribed within the first four weeks after baseline to allow a minimum time for study drug 
potential effect in the presence of background therapy.
Investigator assessments of efficacy should be performed before initiating rescue therapy. 
Subjects requiring rescue therapy between scheduled visits should return to the clinic 
(unscheduled visit) for investigator assessment of efficacy before starting rescue therapy. The 
Investigator must contact [CONTACT_298467].
As judged appropriate by [CONTACT_298445], rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_298390]:

Page 42 of [ZIP_CODE] SELECTION OF STUDY POPULATION
The study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nemolizumab in adult subjects with chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) undergoing hemodialysis with moderate to severe CKD-associated 
pruritus. 
The subjects’ other (non-pruritus) complications of End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are to 
be managed according to local standard of care. The use of moisturizers is also encouraged to 
keep their skin hydrated. 
The study allows for stable background use of the most common medications prescribed for 
patients with this condition (antihistamines and gabapentin) but disallows use of other 
treatments as well as significant changes to the hemodialysis prescription within 8 weeks 
prior to screening (see exclusion criterion 19). The study population consist of patients with 
moderate to severe CKD-associated pruritus (WI NRS ≥ 5.0 ).
Section 10.[ADDRESS_364089] meet all of the following criteria to be included in the study:
1. Subjects aged ≥ 18 years at the screening visit.
2. Has end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and have been on hemodialysis three times per 
week for at least three months prior to the start of screening.
Note 1: Subjects who require an occasional additional hemodialysis treatment to manage 
fluid overload may be enrolled as long as it is anticipated that no more than one such 
treatment will be required in any given week.
Note 2: Subjects having received in-home hemodialysis may participate as long as they 
have switched to in-center hemodialysis at least two weeks prior to screening and plan to 
remain on in-center hemodialysis for the duration of the study.

CKD by [CONTACT_38825], previous physician’s letter/statement, or a written documentation 
by [CONTACT_298468]). 
5. WI NRS score ≥ 5.0 at the screening and baseline visit. Screening WI NRS score will be 
determined by a single WI NRS assessment (score ranging from 0 to 10) for the 24-hour 
period immediately preceding the screening visit. Baseline WI NRS score will be 
determined based on the weekly average of daily WI NRS scores (score ranging from 0 to 
10) during the seven days immediately preceding baseline (rounding is not permitted). A 
minimum of four daily scores out of the seven days immediately preceding baseline is 
required for this calculation.

Page 53 of 123Differences may be detectable during the study drug reconstitution, however active and 
placebo appear similar after reconstitution is complete (approximately 10 minutes). 
Throughout the study, a pharmacist (or other qualified personnel) will prepare study 
medication for injection, including confirmation of complete reconstitution, prior to delivery 
of study medication for injection. The pharmacist (or other qualified personnel) preparing 
study medication should not be involved with any study assessments and should not discuss 
any aspects of study drug reconstitution with the subject or study staff involved in subject 
interviews or study assessments to maintain the blind of the study.
The study drug does not contain preservatives. From a microbiological point of view, the 
preparation of the study drug has to be done as close to subject administration as possible, 
and the study drug should be used immediately (less than one hour) after reconstitution. If not 
used immediately, the study drug has to be used within four hours maximum after 
reconstitution stored at room temperature (below 30 °C) but only if the preparation has taken 
place applying strictly good hygiene practices and clean techniques to ensure controlled 
aseptic conditions.
12.1.[ADDRESS_364114] (or other qualified personnel) will deliver the 
DCS to the investigator or other qualified personnel, for SC injection in the subject’s 
abdomen or alternative injection site. A different injection site should be selected for each 
injection. Refer to the current versions of the Instructions for Use for further details. The site 
of injection should be recorded in the subject’s treatment record as well as the eCRF at each 
time point.
For subjects willing and able to self-inject study medication and preferring to do self-inject, 
study center staff will provide training on study medication injections. Subjects will be 
allowed to inject medication at subsequent visits under supervision by [CONTACT_298477] (with DCS preparation including reconstitution performed by [CONTACT_298478]). Study 
center/clinic staff can perform all injections if the subject is unwilling or unable to perform 
injections. The eCRF must record who performed study drug injection at each visit.
After study drug administration, subjects will be monitored closely for any signs or 
symptoms of hypersensitivity reaction before being discharged. For the first two visits where 
study drug is administered, subjects should remain at the study center for at least 30 minutes 
after study drug administration.
12.1.5 Packaging and Labeling
All IMP packaging and labeling operations will be performed according to Good 
Manufacturing Practice for Medicinal Products in the local language, national 
regulations/guidelines, and the relevant regulatory requirements, specifying that the drug is 
for use in a clinical study. Each DCS will be packaged in an individual carton, including a 
27G ½” needle and a plunger rod (not assembled). Local adaptation of the kit design may be 
required; specific details for each country are provided in the pharmacy manual.

12.2 Measures to Minimize Bias: Study Treatment Assignment
12.2.1 Allocation Concealment and Method of Study Treatment Assignment
Subjects will be centrally randomized using an Interactive Response Technology (IRT) 
system. Allocation concealment will be ensured, as the system will assign the randomization 
number only upon confirmation of eligibility for a given subject to participate in the study. 
Randomization will occur individually, the randomization number will be assigned to the 
unique Subject Identification Number (SIN) of each randomized subject, and the 
simultaneous randomization of groups of subjects will be prevented.
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to:
Group 1: 30 mg nemolizumab Q4W with 60 mg loading dose at baseline;
Group 2: 60 mg nemolizumab Q4W without loading dose at baseline; or
Group 3: placebo Q4W.

qualified personnel will prepare all nemolizumab or placebo treatments, according to the 
current versions of the pharmacy manual and the Instructions for Use, of the assigned DCS 
provided by [CONTACT_82550].
As there may be detectable differences between active and placebo during the reconstitution 
process, the DCS is delivered for injection after the reconstitution is complete. The 
pharmacist (or other qualified personnel) preparing study medication should not be involved 
with any study assessments and should not discuss any aspects of study drug reconstitution 
with the subject or study staff involved in subject interviews or study assessments.
Unblinding of a subject’s individual treatment code should occur only in case of a medical 
emergency or in the event of a serious medical condition that necessitates identification of the 
study drug for the welfare of that subject, as judged by [CONTACT_093]. The emergency 
unblinding process utilizes IRT to allow the investigator to have unrestricted, immediate, and 
direct access to the subject’s individual study treatment. When possible (i.e., when the health 
of the subject is not immediately at risk), the investigator or sub-investigator is encouraged to 
consult with the medical monitor and the sponsor before breaking the blind.
If emergency unblinding is required:
Only the investigator will make the decision to unblind the treatment assignment.
Only the affected subject will be unblinded.
The IRT system will provide the treatment assignment to the investigator.
Refer to the IRT User Guide for information on the steps for breaking the blind.
When the blinding code is broken, the reason must be fully documented. If the code is broken 
by [CONTACT_093], the subject must be withdrawn from the study drug treatment and must 
also be appropriately followed for a minimum of [ADDRESS_364118] dose of study drug.

Dosage modification of the study drug will not be permitted during the clinical study. Any 
inadvertent dose modification(s) should be reported to the sponsor/CRO.
In the event of a missed dose (i.e., temporary discontinuation of the study drug), it will be 
documented in the eCRF that the drug has not been administered at the study visit, together 
with the reason (e.g., for safety). Subjects will be asked to return to the study centers for all 
remaining visits and complete all study assessments and procedures as described in 
Section 13.1.
Dosing frequency is scheduled for Q4W, based on the baseline/Day 1 visit date. If a study 
visit occurs outside the visit window (see Table 5), study drug can be administered provided 
there is a minimum of three weeks since the last injection. Future visits should be scheduled 
within the required windows based on the baseline/Day 1 visit date, while maintaining the 
minimum 3-week interval between two injections.
The rationale for the nemolizumab dose/dose regimen is provided in Section 8.6.

unauthorized use is permitted. Used DCS units will be properly documented in drug 
accountability records. Unless a product technical complaint (PTC) is detected or an event 
occurs before, during, or just after the injection, the used DCS can be disposed in an 
appropriate sharps container and according to waste regulation(s) in the country. A DCS 
involved in a malfunction or an investigator or subject complaint must be retained on site and 
designated personnel must proceed as defined in the current version of the pharmacy manual.

rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_298396]. Subjects receiving treatments defined as rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_298368] (see exclusion criterion 20 in 
Section 11.3). 
As a general guideline and per individual investigator judgment, rescue therapy should not be 
prescribed within the first four weeks after baseline to allow a minimum time for study drug 
exposure in the presence of background therapy. 
Investigator assessments of efficacy should be performed before initiating rescue therapy. 
Subjects requiring rescue therapy between scheduled visits should return to the clinic 
(unscheduled visit) for investigator assessment of efficacy before starting rescue therapy. The 
Investigator must contact [CONTACT_298467].
As judged appropriate by [CONTACT_093], and following discussion with the Medical 
Monitor, rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_298397]: 
Antihistamines (new or increased dose): For those given as needed (“PRN”), at 
baseline, rescue of antihistamine is defined as that with an increase by ≥75% in the 
total weekly dose relative to the dose during the last week of screening administered 
for ≥ 1 week.  
Gabapentin (new or increased dose) administered for ≥ 1 week.   
Selected Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]: Nalbuphine or kappa opi[INVESTIGATOR_74453] (e.g., difelikefalin, 
nalfurafine), one or more doses
Ultraviolet radiation therapy: one or more treatments
Note: all new concomitant medication or increase of frequency or increase of dose will be 
recorded.
Whenever possible, investigators should first use topi[INVESTIGATOR_298398]. If subjects receive topi[INVESTIGATOR_298399], study drug administration should be continued unless there is a safety concern 
according to the investigator’s judgment. If subjects receive systemic rescue therapy, the 
study drug administration can be discontinued if the subject is at risk (discussed and agreed 
upon with investigator and medical monitor).
Further, the use of any rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_298400].

throughout the study and their timing.
Efficacy measurements should be conducted by [CONTACT_1766] (for subject-reported efficacy 
measurements) according to Sections 15.1 - 15.5.
Whenever possible, the same evaluator should make the investigator global assessment (IGA) 
throughout the study. Refer to Section 9.[ADDRESS_364148] pruritus 
(itch) during the last 24 hours (see Appendix 3). The WI NRS is a validated measurement tool 
and has been used to assess subject-reported severity of itch in CKD-aP clinical trials 
(Fishbane 2020). 
Subjects will be asked the following question:
For worst itch intensity: “On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being ‘no itch’ and 10 being the 
‘worst itch imaginable’, how would you rate your itch at the worst moment during the 
previous 24 hours?”
The screening WI NRS score will be determined by a single WI NRS assessment (score 
ranging from 0 to 10) for the 24-hour period immediately preceding the screening visit. The 
baseline WI NRS score will be determined based on the weekly average of daily WI NRS 
scores (score ranging from 0 to 10) during the seven days immediately preceding baseline 
(rounding is not permitted). A minimum of four daily scores out of the seven days 
immediately preceding baseline is required for this calculation.
Subjects will record their 24-hour worst itching assessment scores on all days. Subjects will 
receive instructions on how to record their WI NRS scores and will complete the assessment 
once daily in the evening throughout the clinical study (including the screening and the 
follow-up period) in an eDiary. If they cannot record it in the evening, then record it in the 
following morning is acceptable.
If a subject does not complete the WI NRS assessments in the evening, the subject will be 
allowed to complete the assessments the following morning.

A 12-lead ECG will be performed and read locally according to visits specified in 
Section 13.1. ECGs will be performed in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_298404], Table 5. Subjects should be monitored for potentially CS ECG 
results (refer to the current version of the central laboratory manual). Tests with abnormal 
results that are deemed CS should be repeated to ensure reproducibility of the abnormality.

of the laboratory manual for laboratory values outside of normal limits. For each out-of-range 
laboratory result, the investigator or designee will evaluate whether he/she considers it to be 
CS, defined as meeting at least 1 of the following conditions:
The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity, or
The abnormality is of a degree that requires additional active management (e.g., 
discontinuation of the drug, close observation, more frequent follow-up assessments, 
or further diagnostic investigation).
If the investigator observes a CS laboratory result that meets the criteria for an adverse event 
or at the investigator’s discretion, the test will be repeated as soon as possible, and the subject 
will be monitored until the value returns to normal and/or an adequate explanation for the 
abnormality is found.
Investigators will also be allowed to repeat specific laboratory test(s) or procedure(s) where 
the investigator suspects an inaccuracy or false result and that may impact the safety of the 
subject or the interpretation of the trial results; only after discussion with medical monitor.
All CS out-of-range laboratory values at the screening visit will be recorded in the medical 
history form (report a diagnosis rather than the laboratory value whenever possible). All CS 
out-of-range laboratory values after the screening visit are to be reported as an AE if this 
abnormality was not present at the screening visit or is assessed as having worsened since the 
screening visit (i.e., changed by a clinically significantly extent from the screening visit). 
Whenever possible, the investigator should provide a diagnosis of an AE when reporting the 
abnormal laboratory value.
Subjects should fast for at least [ADDRESS_364155] 
be available before the baseline visit. Laboratory testing conducted in a nonfasting state will 
not be a protocol deviation.
Total blood volumes to be drawn at each visit are provided in the clinical laboratory manual. 
Additional samples may be required if medically indicated (e.g., at unscheduled visits for 
safety reasons, when an abnormal laboratory value is observed and requires a re-test).
See Section 16.5, Section 16.6, and Section 16.7 for details regarding pregnancy testing, 
virology, and TB testing samples, respectively (See Section 17.1 for details regarding  
 and Section 18.1 for ADA sampling).
The following laboratory safety tests will be performed as specified in Section 13.1.

Active TB is a disease caused by [CONTACT_298488] a smear or culture taken from any source in the person's 
body which tests positive for TB or by [CONTACT_99423]. Individuals with active TB are 
symptomatic, depending upon the location of the disease (most commonly in the lungs but 
also possibly in the brain, kidneys, spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], or elsewhere), and can spread the infection to 
others.
Latent TB is said to exist when an individual is infected with Mycobacterium TB, as 
evidenced by a positive Interferon Gamma Release Assay, [ADDRESS_364161] received a bacillus Calmette- Guérin (BCG) 
vaccination. They should also be asked if they have been in contact [CONTACT_298489], such as travel to TB endemic regions, close contact [CONTACT_298490], or workplace risk (e.g., prison, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]).
A subject who tests positive for latent TB (with a positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold test) 
should be referred to the subject's treating physician for appropriate follow-up, unless the 
subject has a documented history of completion of an appropriate TB treatment regimen with 
no history of re-exposure to TB since her/his treatment was completed. If the result is 
indeterminate, the test may be repeated once. If confirmed indeterminate, the subject should 
then be managed as though he/she has a positive test result.

history of asthma and their respi[INVESTIGATOR_38324] (e.g., wheezing, coughing, allergies, infections). 
Subjects with a history of asthma will be questioned about the seasonality of their asthma and 
known triggers, such as allergens. Newly diagnosed asthma or worsening of asthma during 
the study will be reported as an AESI.

The ACT is designed for adults and adolescents [ADDRESS_364165] provides a numerical score ranging from five to 25 to assess asthma 
control; a higher score indicates better asthma control while a score of [ADDRESS_364166]'s asthma may not be under control. The ACT will also aid the investigator's

Subjects with a new (de novo) diagnosis of asthma will undergo PEF testing at all visits after 
the diagnosis is first made according to Section 13.1.
PEF testing during the clinical study will be performed under the supervision of qualified 
study personnel. PEF measurements should consist of three good efforts, with the best result

about AEs using an open nonpersuasive question to elicit reporting of AEs (for example, 
“Have you noticed any change in your health since the last visit?”). Directed questioning and 
examination will then be performed as appropriate.
Any AE occurring during the AE reporting period, whether it is related to the study drug(s) or 
not, will be recorded immediately in the source document and described on the Adverse 
Event Form (“AE Form”) along with the date of onset, severity, relationship to the study 
drug(s), and outcome, without omitting any requested and known information. Additional 
information will be requested under certain circumstances.
AEs assessed as related to the treatment or study procedure will be monitored until they have 
resolved or reached a stable condition. Other AEs will be monitored until the last visit if they 
have not resolved or reached a stable condition.
The investigator will obtain and maintain in the subject's files all pertinent medical records,

16.9.1 Assessment of Severity
Each AE will be assigned a category by [CONTACT_3470]:
Mild:An AE that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causes minimal discomfort, and 
does not interfere with everyday activities.
Moderate: An AE that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday 
activities; intervention may be needed.
Severe: An AE that prevents normal everyday activities; treatment or other 
intervention usually needed.
16.9.2 Assessment of Causality
The investigator is to determine whether there is a reasonable causal relationship between the 
occurrence of the AE and exposure to the study drug (i.e., nemolizumab or placebo) and/or 
study procedure (e.g., injection, topi[INVESTIGATOR_298413], blood sample collection). 
Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant 
factors including the pattern of the reaction, temporal relationships, relevant medical history, 
and confounding factors such as co-medication or concurrent diseases.
The expression “reasonable causal relationship” is meant to convey in general that there are 
facts or arguments to suggest a causal relationship (ICH E2A, Section IIIA 1).

19.3 Efficacy Analysis
A summary based on observed case (OC) will be provided for all primary, secondary, and 
exploratory efficacy endpoints. At this case, no data will be imputed. For this summary, if 
any rescue medication is received or treatment is discontinued, and data are collected 
post-rescue receipt or treatment discontinuation, then the data post-rescue or post-
discontinuation will be summarized as observed.
Proportion of subjects with WI NRS/SD NRS ≥ 4 and WI NRS ≥ 3, changes and percent 
changes from baseline of WI NRS/SD NRS at each week (from week 1 through week 20) 
will be calculated on the basis of the weekly average, obtained by [CONTACT_298446] 4 daily 
WI NRS/SD NRS scores over 7-day periods.
For baseline weekly average, if fewer than 4 daily WI NRS/SD NRS scores for the 7-day period 
are available, the interval lower bound will be extended up to 7 additional days, one day at a 
time, until 4 daily WI NRS/SD NRS scores are available. If after the interval extension fewer 
than 4 daily WI NRS/SD NRS scores are available, the baseline weekly average WI NRS/SD 
NRS will be considered missing. The interval extension for the baseline weekly average 
calculation applies to the statistical analysis only. For eligibility, 4 daily WI NRS/SD NRS 
scores for the 7-day period are required (see inclusion criterion 5).
For week 12 weekly average, if fewer than 4 daily WI NRS/SD NRS scores for the 7-day period 
are available, the interval upper bound will be extended for 5 additional days, one day at a time, 
until 4 daily WI NRS/SD NRS scores are available. If after extending the upper bound fewer 
than 4 daily WI NRS/SD NRS scores available, the interval lower bound will be extended for 
5 additional days, one day at a time, until 4 daily scores are available. If after the interval 
extension fewer than 4 daily WI NRS/SD NRS scores are available, the week 12 weekly 
average WI NRS/SD NRS will be considered missing.
For all the other weekly averages, if fewer than 4 daily WI NRS/SD NRS scores for the 7-day 
period are available, the weekly average WI NRS/SD NRS will be considered missing for that 
period.
For the aim of sensitivity analyses, weekly averages of WI NRS obtained by [CONTACT_298446] 
[ADDRESS_364197] 1 daily 
score over 7-day periods will be calculated. No period extension at baseline and week 12 
applies for these weekly averages. If fewer than 3, 2 or 1 daily WI NRS scores for the 7-day 
period are available, the corresponding weekly average of WI NRS will be considered missing 
for that period.
Data of both nemolizumab groups (30 mg and 60 mg) and placebo group and comparisons 
versus placebo group of both nemolizumab groups will be presented.

Estimand DescriptionEstimand Attributes
Treatment Conditions: initial dose of nemolizumab (60 mg) or placebo at 
baseline, then nemolizumab (30 mg or 60 mg) or placebo Q4W at Weeks 4 and 8 
via subcutaneous injection. 
Population: adult hemodialysis patients with chronic kidney disease and associated 
moderate to severe pruritus (will be estimated in the Intent-to-Treat analysis set).
Variable: a binary composite response where:
Responder is defined as an improvement ≥ 4 in WI NRS from baseline at Week 12 
without use of rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_298384]/death related to study drug.
Non-responder is defined as an improvement < 4 in WI NRS from baseline at 
Week 12 or use of rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_298372]/death related to study drug.
Strategies for Intercurrent Events: A composite strategy was chosen for the use 
of rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_298385]/death related to study drug; in case of use of rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_298386]/death related to study drug, subjects 
will be considered as treatment failures in the binary composite response. In the 
case of treatment discontinuation for any other reason, a treatment policy strategy 
will be used and observed after discontinuation data (if available) will be used.In adult hemodialysis

Page 97 of [ZIP_CODE].7 Handling of Missing Data
Missing data for dichotomous efficacy endpoints will be imputed using multiple imputations 
(MI) under missing at random (MAR) assumption for the primary/main analysis. 
Dichotomous endpoints will be calculated from the underlying imputed variable.
For the sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint, missing data will be imputed using a 
copy reference (CR) approach under missing not at random (MNAR) assumption 
(dichotomous endpoints will be calculated from the underlying imputed variable) and as 
“Non-responder”; moreover a Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_298427].
For the sensitivity analyses of the key secondary efficacy endpoints, missing data will be 
imputed using a CR approach under MNAR assumption (dichotomous endpoints will be 
calculated from the underlying imputed variable) and as “Non-responder”.
Missing data of continuous efficacy endpoints and QoL/Health Outcome endpoints will be 
imputed using MI under MAR assumption.
For the multiple imputation, the MI procedure of the SAS system will be used to generate sets 
of data with missing values imputed from observed data. It is expected that the pattern of 
missing data will be monotonic, with slight deviations being corrected by [CONTACT_298500] (MCMC) method of the MI procedure. A predictive mean matching method will 
be used for the continuous data with the following covariates included in the imputation 
model: non-missing data from earlier time points. Separate imputations by [CONTACT_298501]. Changes and percent changes from baseline and dichotomous endpoints 
will be calculated from the imputed data.
Subjects who took rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_298428] [IP_ADDRESS] or discontinued treatment 
due to lack of efficacy or AE/death related to study drug will be considered as treatment 
failures, efficacy data collected after the use of rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_298429]/death related to study drug will be set to the worst possible 
value and subject’s binary response will be imputed as ”Non-responder” prior to conducting 
the MI and Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_298373].
Further details will be provided in the SAP.

within the same geographic region. The pooled centers and the remaining original unpooled 
clinical centers will be referred to as 'analysis centers' and will be used as stratification factor 
in the statistical analyses.
If at the start of pooling any geographic region has less than [ADDRESS_364214] of small centers in another geographic region 
and then combined as above. This decision will be documented in clinical report.
19.9 Sensitivity and Supplementary Analysis for Primary and Key Secondary 
Efficacy Endpoints
For the sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint, missing data will be imputed using a 
copy reference (CR) approach under missing not at random (MNAR) assumption 
(dichotomous endpoints will be calculated from the underlying imputed variable) and as 
“Non-responder”; moreover a Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_298427]. Furthermore, the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be repeated using 
weekly averages of WI NRS with at least [ADDRESS_364215] 1 daily scores over 7-day periods (no period extension 
at baseline and week 12 applies for these averages).
A mITT analysis, a PP analysis and an observed case analysis will be performed too as 
supplementary analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint. 
Sensitivity analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_298449] a CR approach under 
MNAR assumption (dichotomous endpoints will be calculated from the underlying imputed 
variable) and as “Non-responder” for the following dichotomous secondary endpoints:
Proportion of subjects with an improvement of WI NRS ≥ 3 from baseline at Week 12.
Proportion of subjects with an improvement of WI NRS ≥ 4 from baseline at Week 4.
Proportion of subjects with an improvement of SD NRS ≥ 4 from baseline at Week 12.
Proportion of subjects with an improvement of WI NRS ≥ 3 from baseline at Week 4.
Proportion of subjects with an improvement of SD NRS ≥ 4 from baseline at Week 4.
Subjects who took rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_298428] [IP_ADDRESS] or discontinued treatment 
due to lack of efficacy or AE/death related to study drug will be considered as treatment 
failures, efficacy data collected after the use of rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_298429]/death related to study drug will be set to the worst possible 
value and subject’s binary response will be imputed as “Non-responder” prior to conducting

2.  INTRODUCTION 
 
2.[ADDRESS_98129] of care of about 3.2 billion 
dollars [2, 3]. With the increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_89249], high rates of disease recurrence are 
being seen without the availability of adequate treatment [4, 5]. Inflammatory Bowel Disease 
refractory to conventional treatment remains a major clinical prob lem [6, 7]. 
 
It is now accepted that the disruption of the normal balance of colonic microbiota secondary to 
antibiotic use  facilitates the development of CDAD and improvemen ts in the quality and quantity of 
flora is associated with recovery of infection and disease recurrence. Studies ha ve sho wn that 
patients with recurrent CDA D have dec reased a naerobic bacteroidetes and alteration of counts of 
firmicutes in their stool compared  to patients recovering from single epi[INVESTIGATOR_89250] D [8]. 
Numerous case  reports and retrospective case  series have demonstrated the benefit of fecal 
microbiota transplantation (FMT) in patients with severe or recurrent CDAD with cure rates over 
90% [9-13]. FMT involves administration of a suspension of feces obtained from a hea lthy individual 
into the colon of a patient with recurrent CDAD to promote normalization of flora and inhibition of 
the infecting C. difficile [10]. Probiotics have been  used widely for patients with CDAD in efforts to 
repair the disruption of microbiota leading to prevention and control of CDAD [14]; however, the 
available probiotics ha ve been sh own to have a limited effect failing to reach the efficacy of fecal 
transplantation from a healthy volunteer. 
 
2.2 Current Treatment of C. difficile Associated Dia rrhea  (CDAD) and Recurrent CDAD (RCDAD) 
 
The administration of vancomycin, metronidazole or fidaxomycin is the first choice for antibiotic 
therapy for CDAD especially for severe clinical illness d efined as the presence of important 
como rbidity, altered sensorium, unstable clinical co urse, confinement in an intens ive care unit, renal

failure (creatinine level ≥ 1.5  times the upper limit of normal), reduced serum albumin level (<2.5 
g/dL), hypotension, or leukocytosis with a white blood cell count gre ater than 15,000/mm3 [19]. 
 
A unique feature of CDAD is the very high recurrence rate seen in 2 5% of patients treated with 
equivalent frequency with either metronidazole or vancomycin [20, 21 ], typi[INVESTIGATOR_89251] [ADDRESS_98130] bout. Primary treatment of CDI with fidaxomic in reduces 
the rate of recurrence to 15% for infection caused by [CONTACT_105]-NAP1 strains [22]. A meta-analysis of 39 
studies, including 11 prospective, 21 retrospective and  7 randomized clinical trials showed that 
there was 22%  treatment failure for metronidazole versus  14% for vancomycin. Recurrence rates 
were 27% for metronidazole and 24%  for vancomycin [23]. In smaller case  reports, tigecycline [24], 
rifaximin [25], and nitazoxanide [26] showed response rates of 86%, 79% and 74%  respectively for 
refractory CDAD . Fidaxomixin has  been sh owed to be the same value as vancom ycin with regard to 
cure rate but was assoc iated with a significantly lower recurrence rate [22]. 
 
2.[ADDRESS_98131] toxigenic C. difficile [8, 10]. FMT recreates the normal fecal microbiota, allowing 
the inhibition of C. difficile [32]. In addition, there is a possibility that the transplantation of healthy 
flora results in an immunological response, facilitating the elimination of C. difficile. Fecal 
transplantation treatment was introduced with the first reported case  in 1958 by [CONTACT_89291]. [33]. 
Over the subsequent [ADDRESS_98132] suggested a ~90% clinical cu re rate 
for recurrent CDA D [34]. More recent studies in 2012 confirmed these numbers with cure rates of 
86% to 94% [35-38]. These results indicate that fecal transplantation for RCDA D is significantly 
superior to those with con ventional antibiotic therapy. However, using fresh don or stool has its 
practical b arriers, such as difficulty in stool preparation, and standardization of donor stool. It has 
been propos ed to use frozen fecal extracts in the transplantation [36]. FMT needs to be a 
standardized and simplified to optimize the process and make it more efficient. 
 
A description of the Fecal Microbial Transplantation (FMT) is available to physicians and patients 
(Introduction to FMT) 
 
3.  OBJECTIVE 
 
We will generate a frozen, lyophilized or fresh FMT inoculum from well-screened healthy volunteer donors of 
≥150 gr am/sample. Delivery of FMT will be performed colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897]. This study will evaluate the safety of 
a frozen or  lyophilized or  fresh inoculum administered by [CONTACT_19069].  Fecal samp les from donors and 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_89252]. 
 
4.  STUDY DESIGN 
 
This is a single center, randomized, parallel ass ignment, open label safety study conducted in patients 
with RCDAD . Approximately 100 patients will be e nrolled in the study and randomized at  1:1 ratio to 
receive fresh or frozen or  lyophilized donor stool.

therapy. Attending physician of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]/patients will order the FMT and make clinical d ecisions 
related to overall health for his/her patients. All patients undergoing therapy will be h andled as 
outpatients at either Baylor St. Luke‟s Medical Center in the [LOCATION_007] Medical Center, the Digestive 
Disease Center at  Memorial Hermann in the [LOCATION_007] Medical Center, or Kelsey-Seybold Clinic –

colonoscopy. The Center for Infectious Disease enteric pathogens laboratory at the University  of 
[LOCATION_007] Sch ool of Public Health will prepare  donor stool for administration via a colonoscopy. 
 
Evaluation of  the safety and recurrence clinical symptoms of FMT will be p erformed by  [CONTACT_89292]-UT-SPH. The primary endpoint is to evaluate 
the safety of the FMT (fresh or  frozen or  lyophilized h ealth don or feces) for the treatment of patients 
with 3 or more RCDA D. A sec ond efficacy endpoint is to evaluate the recurrence of clinical 
symptoms after initial therapy.  In order to monitor any health effects for safety, participants will be

4.2 Study Population 
 
Our recent study demonstrated that a majority of Houston gastroenterologists and infectious 
diseases spec ialists supported the creation of a fecal microbiota transplantation center in Houston 
[39]. The recipi[INVESTIGATOR_89256] D will be referred generally by [CONTACT_89294]. We will screen at least [ADDRESS_98133] not be students or lab technicians working at EPDL-UT-SPH. The 
donors will be sc reened and surveyed for health and medication us e, sexual behavior, travel, and 
other risk factors for infectious diseases during a private and confidential interview (Donor – 
Prescreen  Form).  All fecal material from dono rs will be tested/ screened for enteric p athogens 
mentioned in protocol section 4. 3.3. Donors will be notified by [CONTACT_89295].

[IP_ADDRESS] Donor Stool Preparation, Storage a nd Shelf Life 
 
 
 
1.  Obtain ≥ 150g of stool per transplant (multiple stools will be required to obtain ≥150 
grams). When the randomization calls for a fresh sample ≥ 50 g of stool will be 
accepted and used in totality not more than 4 hours before procedures 
2.  Stools of lower weight (≤ 150g but ≥ 50g) will be us ed as fresh FMT only, no frozen 
and lyophilized transplantation product will be sav ed. We will collect additional stool 
from the same donor during the month screened for frozen and lyophilized 
transplantation products. 
3.  Dono r stool is mixed with 1500mL (1:10 dilution) sterilized 0.9% NaCl without 
antibacterial preservative in a large sterilized suction canister 
4.  The solution is mixed in a homogenizer mixer with sterilized bag (Stomacher). Initially, 
use the low setting until the sample breaks up, and then advance the speed graduall y 
to the highest setting. Continue for 2 – 4 minutes until sample is smooth. 
5.  The suspension is filtered using a sterile pape r coffee filter (or gauze) that has been 
moistened with saline and funne l (both are sterilized). Allow adequate time for slow 
filtration to end. NOTE: To expedite process, multiple funnel /filters can be used to 
combine product. 
6.  Repea t step 4. NOTE: it may take [ADDRESS_98146] filtered suspension in 15 sterilized 50 mL tubes 
8.  Number the samples as FMT-D-001-FRESH (5 tubes), FMT-D-001-FROZEN  (5 
tubes) and FMT-D-001-LYOPHILIZED (5 tubes) (Form 129-12-03) 
9.  Labe l the tubes with lot number (mm-dd-yyyy) and date and time processed 
10. Keep the samples - 
 FMT-D-001-FROZEN (5 tubes) sealed with plastic (polyethylene or similar 
film) at -80C in room  for up to [ADDRESS_98147]

6.1.2 Monitoring for safety 
 
 
The following definitions of terms are guided by [CONTACT_89299] (21 CFR 3 12.32). 
 
An adverse experience is any unfavorable or u nintend ed sign, symptom, of disease 
temporally associated with FMT procedure, whether or not considered related to the 
proced ure, including, but not limited to: 
 Any symptom  not previously reported by [CONTACT_1955][INVESTIGATOR_840] (Recent Medical History) 
 An exacerbation of a pre-existing illness, increases in the frequency and/or 
severity of the signs or symptoms of CDA D (defined as pos itive C. difficile toxin 
test and enteric symptoms) 
 A significant increase in  frequency or intensity of a pre-existing epi[INVESTIGATOR_89274] 
 A condition first detected or diagnosed after study drug administration even 
through the condition may have been present  before the procedure 
 
Details of all adverse experiences that occ ur after FMT through approximately day 30 
visit will be co llected  as indicated  above. 
 
Serious adverse experience is any adverse experience that: 
 Results in death 
 Is life threatening (at immediate risk of death from the procedure as it occurred) 
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (overnight stay) or prolongs a current 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
 Causes a  persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 Medical important (any event that requires medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above) 
 
The investigator will exercise medical a nd scientific judgment when dec iding whether 
expeditious reporting is appropriate in other situations not strictly meeting the listed 
criteria a bove. The investigators will meet/discuss  with experts in the field if there is a 
question of whether the adverse experience would be considered serious. 
 
Severity – The adverse experience will be d ocumented on  the appropriate page in the 
Patient Diary acc ording to the following descriptors: 
 Mild: associated with no limitation of usual activities or o nly slight discomfort 
 Moderate: associated with limitation of usual activities or s ignificant discomfort

 Severe: associated with inability to carry out usual activities or very marked 
discomfort 
 
Relationship – the relationship of adverse experience to FMT will be ass igned by  [CONTACT_89300]: 
 Probable: a reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the 
proce dure that follows a known or e xpected response pa ttern to the suspected 
proced ure and that could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_89301]‟s clinical state 
 Possible: a reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the 
proced ure that follows a known or e xpected response pa ttern to the procedure but 
could readily have been produc ed by a number of other factors 
 Unlikely: a reaction that does not  follow a reasonable temporal sequence from the 
proced ure but for which ca usality from FMT cannot be ruled out. 
 Not related: a reaction for which sufficient data exist to indicate that the etiology is 
unrelated to the procedure

as the event is discovered. At each visit, after the patient has had an opportunity to 
mention any problems spontane ously, the Investigator (or designee) will inquire about 
adverse experience by [CONTACT_89302], such  as: 
 
 Have you had any  medical prob lems since your last visit? 
 Have any  medical prob lems present at your last visit changed, i.e., stopped, 
worsene d, or improved? 
 Have you taken any new medicines, oth er than study drug,  since your last visit? 
 
Any spontane ous adverse experience information provided by [CONTACT_89303]. If an adverse experience has not resolved at  the time of the Final Visit (day 30 
Visit), the Investigator should evaluate the status of the adverse experience at the 
Follow-Up telephone/email contact [CONTACT_89304] (e.g. ongoing or resolved). 
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_98154] be  reported to the University  of [LOCATION_007] Health

Investigators are not obligated to actively seek follow-up information for patients with 
adverse experience after the conclusion of the study (i.e., > 30 days after the FMT 
proced ure). However, if the investigator becomes  aware of an adverse experience that 
occurs after the patient completes and the adverse experience is considered by  [CONTACT_89305], the investigator must 
notify the University  of [LOCATION_007] Health Science Center IRB.

7.2 Statistical Methods 
 
 
7.2.1 General considerations 
 
 
All analyses will be p erformed and all tables, figures, and data listings will be prep ared 
using SAS (Cary, NC). Summary statistics for continuous variables will include the 
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum value; categorical 
variables will be prese nted as cou nts and percentages. For all analyses, baseline is 
defined as the date of fecal transplantation. 
 
7.2.2 Power calculations 
 
 
No power calculation was performed since this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. We will evaluate the 
program/center after enrollment of 100 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_89276] . Thirty patients (33 in 
each group, receive either fresh or frozen or  lyophilized stools from healthy donors) 
with CDA D will be included in the study using the entry criteria in section 4.3.3.

Listings and summary tables with desc riptive statistics will be prepared  for 
demographic data (gender, date of birth, race/ethnicity), and medical h istory data 
(including the date and  time of onset of CDA D and signs or symptoms of enteric 
infection, epi[INVESTIGATOR_89277] ).

lyophilized stool), blocks of size [ADDRESS_98160] one occurrence of adverse 
experience and/or se rious adverse experience for each system organ class and 
preferred term will be tabulated. Term will also be  tabulated by [CONTACT_89307]. For multiple occurrences of the same adverse experience 
with different severities, the adverse experience with the highest se verity will be 
tabulated. F or multiple occurrences of the same  adverse experience with different 
relationships to the procedure (related and not related); the adverse experience will be 
tabulated as related. All adverse experience and or serious adverse experience for all 
patients will be present ed in d ata listings. Narratives will also be  prepared  for each 
serious adverse experience. 
 
Physical examination findings will be presented  in data listings. Listings and su mmary 
tables with desc riptive statistics will be prepared  for each vital sign parameter (diastolic 
and systolic blood pressure, h eart rate, oral temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]). In addition, 
the percent change from baseline will be ca lculated for each continuous variable.

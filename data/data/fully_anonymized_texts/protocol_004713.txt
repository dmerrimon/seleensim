 Study Synopsis  
Study  Title  A Multi -Center, Sham -Controlled, Double -Blind 
Randomized Withdrawal Study of Pulsed Electromagnetic 
Field (PEMF) Therapy  to Evaluate Vibration Perception 
Threshold and Thermal Sensory in Subjects with Diabetic 
Peripheral Neuropathy in the Lower Extremity  
Protocol Number  RBI.2017.001  
Name [CONTACT_231698]® Therapy System  
Phase of Development  Proof of Concept  
Objective  To demonstrate the effectiveness of PEMF treatment compared 
to sham treatment in changing  Vibration Perception Threshold 
(VPT) and Thermal Sensory (QST) in patients with diabetic 
peripheral neuropathy ( DPN) when treatment is administered 
twice daily through 120 -day period.    
Number of Subjects  Up to 40 subjects randomized 1:1.  
Study Design  This is a multi -center , sham -controlled, double -blind , enriched 
enrollment , randomized withdrawal clinical trial conducted on 
subjects with bilateral symmetrical diabetic peripheral 
neuropathy . Eligible subjects will include those  between 22 and 
80 years of age with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes having persistent 
pain, numbness, ting ling, or burning  in both feet  despi[INVESTIGATOR_206800] .  Eligible subjects will receive two active treatment  
devices ( one for  each foot , to allow  simultaneous  treatment ) and 
treat at home , twice daily for 60 days after which they will return 
to the clinic at Day 61 for a response assessment. Subjects that 
are determined to be responders at Day 61 (subjects that achieve 
a 1-point decrease in the average pain score over the last 24 hours 
using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) ) will be 
randomized 1:[ADDRESS_861716] is determined to be a responder at Day 
75, they will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_861717] is determined to be a responder at Day 9 1, they will be 
randomized 1:[ADDRESS_861718] continues to 
be a non-responder at Day 9 1 they will be terminated from the 
study.

 Endpoints  For this proof of concept study, the primary endpoint s will be 
changes in Vibration Perception Threshold and Quantitative 
Sensory Testing between baseline and end of treatment.  
Secondary endpoints will be changes in nerve conduction 
velocity (NCV) of the sural nerve and amplitude from baseline to 
end of treatment, changes in Skin Perfusion Pressure (SPP) from 
baseline to end of treatment, c hange in Pain Intensity using the 
11-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) from baseline to end 
of treatment, change from baseline in Brief Pain Inventory  (BPI)  
and Brief Fatigue Inventory  (BFI) , change from baseline in 
Patient Global Impression of Change  (PGIC ), change from 
baseline in Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620]  (HADS) , and 
change s from baseline in neuropathy and foot ulcer specific 
quality of life instrument  (NeuroQoL) . 
 
Safety will be assessed through review of Adverse Event ( AE) 
reports and concomitant treatments and medications. All 
concomitant drug or non -drug treatments used during the study 
will be recorded. Safety outcomes will be assessed at the interim 
visits  and the  end of study visit . 
Study P rocedures  Following informed consent and assessment of eligibility, 
subjects will complete Section A -History of the Michigan 
Neuropathy  Screening Instrument (MNSI) with Section B -
Physical Assessment completed by [CONTACT_779].  A measurement of 
the depth of the right foot will be measured from the most inferior 
aspect of the medial malleolus to the plantar aspect of the foot 
when residing on the treatment pad.  The depth should not be 
more than 8cm for e ligibility.   A finger  stick  will be performed 
on the subject to o btain a baseline HbA1c  value  (A1C Now® test 
kit) and subjects will complete a Urine Drug Screen in office . 
Subjects will undergo the Ankle -Brachial Index  (ABI) , Venous 
Insufficiency Assessment, and Pain Phase evaluation  (at least 10 
subjects in each of the  2, 3, and 4 pain phases will be enrolled) .  
For subjects of child bearing potential a urine pregnancy test will 
be obtained.  
At the Enrollment Visit (can be combined with Screening), 
subjects will have a finger stick performed to collect a baseline 
glucose value.  If the Screening Visit and Enrollment Visit are 
not combined, eligibility will be re -assessed to confirm no 
changes, concomitant medications and assessments of Adverse 
Events will be obtained .  Subjects will provide their baseline pain 
score over the last 24 hours using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale 
(NPRS) and will also complete baseline health economic 
questions, questionnaires including the Brief Pain Inventory 
(BPI), Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58900] (HA DS), and the NeuroQoL  Questionnaire .

710-7005 01 F  Protocol RBI.2017.001  Version F CONFIDENTIAL  
 Vibration Perception Threshold (VPT), Quantitative Sensory 
Test (QST) and Nerve Conduction Velocity ( NCV ) will be 
performed . Skin Perfusion Pressure (SPP) will be performed to 
obtain a baseline value of the plantar and  dorsal aspect of the right 
foot.  Eligible subjects will receive 2 active treatment devices (1 
device for each foot).  Subjects will be instructed in the use of the 
devices  and will self -treat both feet twice daily (morning and 
evening; 8am ± 2 hours and 8pm ± 2 hours) for 60 days in the 
home environment. Each treatment will be 30 minutes in 
duration, treating both feet simultaneously.  Subjects will  be 
provided with a study diary for capturing their daily pain scores 
based on a 11 -point numerical pain rat ing scale (NPRS) and 
weekly Patient Global Impression of Change Score (PGIC).  
Subjects will document pain scores each day after the morning 
treatment as instructed by [CONTACT_643986].  Every 
week the PGIC will be collected in the diary an d the subject will 
document their overall status since the beginning of treatment. 
Subjects will either provide consent or not for biopsies to be 
obtained.  Subjects that consent to the biopsies will have two 
3mm punch skin biops ies obtained , one biopsy at  the distal leg 
(10cm above the lateral malleolus) and one biopsy at the distal 
thigh (10cm above the superior margin of patella) .  Biopsies will 
be taken from the right leg to represent small nerve fiber 
innervation emanating from the deep peroneal nerve.  At least two 
subjects in each pain phase category (2, 3, and 4 Pain Phase) will 
be obtained.  
The site will contact [CONTACT_643987] [ADDRESS_861719] adherence to treatment, completion of the diary, and any 
safety concerns and/or changes  in concomitant 
treatments/medications.   
At Days [ADDRESS_861720]’s blood glucose level. 
Subjects will also bring in their study devices and diary to assess 
treatment and diary compliance.  A new study diary will be 
dispensed for the next two weeks. At Day 61, SPP will b e 
conducted and subjects will be assessed for a response.  If a 
subject is determined to be a responder (decrease in average pain 
score over the last [ADDRESS_861721] 1 point)

 they will return the active devices and be randomized 1:1 to 
receive active treatment or inactive  sham devices and be 
instructed to treat for an additional 60 days (through Day 120).  
If the subject is determined to be a non -responder, they will 
continue treating with the active devices for an additional [ADDRESS_861722] conducted.  All 
subjects will bring in their devices and diary to assess treatment 
and diary compliance.  A new study diary will be dispensed for 
the next two weeks.  For those subjects determined to be non -
responders at Day 61, they will be assessed for response.  If they 
become a responder by [CONTACT_2006] 75 they will return their active 
devices and be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_861723]’s blood glucose level. Subje cts 
will also bring in the study devices and diary to assess treatment 
and diary compliance.  A new study diary will be dispensed for 
the next two weeks. At Day 91, non -responders will be assessed 
for a response.  If a subject is determined to be a respond er at Day 
91 (decrease in average pain score using the NPRS of at least 1 
point ) they will return the active devices and be randomized 1:1 
to receive active treatment or inactive -sham devices and 
instructed to treat for an additional 30 days (through day 1 20).  If 
the subject is determined to be a non -responder, they will be 
terminated from the study at the end of the Day [ADDRESS_861724]’s 
that consented to having the biopsy , will have a 3mm punch skin 
biopsy obtained from the distal leg and distal thigh on the right

 leg.  The biopsy will be obtained to represent small nerve fiber 
innervation emanating from the deep peroneal nerve.  
Assessment of adverse events and concomitant medications will 
occur at each visit.  
Study  Device  
 The study device is the PROVANT® Therapy System  (PEMF) . 
The active devices will deliver Pulsed Electromagnetic Field 
(PEMF) energy therapy. The active treatment and inactive sham 
devices will be identical in appearance and all other physical 
characteristics in order to maintain the blinding  of the treatm ent. 
Each device will be identi fied with a unique kit number.  
Study Sample  The anticipated enrollment in this study is up to 40 subjects . The 
study will be conducted at up to 4  sites.  
 
Primary and Secondary 
Outcome Measures  Several efficacy outcome measures will be assessed in order to 
allow for characterization of the response to PEMF therapy.  
Efficacy Assessments  
All efficacy assessments will be conducted at the Enrollment 
Visit (Baseline; Day 0) and at the end of study visit (Day 121) .  
Vibration Perception Threshold (VPT):  For large nerve fiber 
assessment.  VPT is a non-invasive test used in quantifying 
sensation/sensitivity to vibration in evaluating sensory 
dysfunction associated with diabetic neuropathy.  The hand -held 
vibratory stimulator will be placed against the midpoint of the 
plantar aspect and big toe of  the right  foot, the tester will initiate 
the automated test that will last between [ADDRESS_861725] and on the big toe of the right foot.  VPT will be 
collected at the Enrollment Visit to obtain a baseline value  and 
on Days 15, 30, 45, 61, 75, 91, 105 and 121.  
Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST): For small nerve fiber 
assessment.  QST is a noninvasive test used in peripheral nervous 
system disorders for thermal sensory testing.  Contact [CONTACT_643988] a contact [CONTACT_291236].  A cold test of 15°C - 25°C, heat test 
of 40°C - 46°C will be administered.  When activated the patient 
will notify the staff performing the test when they begin to feel 
the cold and warm t est.  The heat and cold thermal stimulation 
will be applied over the dorsal  aspect of the right  foot.  QST will 
be performed at the Enrollment Visit to obtain a baseline value 
and on Days 15, 30, 45, 61, 75, 91, 105 and 121.  
10 
 
710-7005 01 F  Protocol RBI.2017.001  Version F CONFIDENTIAL  
 Nerve Conduction Velocity (NCV) : For large myelinated nerve 
fiber assessments.  Using the NC -stat® DPNCheck®, the subject 
will assume a comfortable position so that their right leg is visible 
(that the subject’s outer ankle bone and Achilles tendon are 
visible). The patient preparation pad is then used to thoroughly 
clean the subject’s outer lower leg and ankle bone area to remove 
any residue.  The subject’s outer ankle bone is the n identified to 
align the anode and cathode just behind with the cathode just 
adjacent to the middle of the ankle bone.  The device is aligned 
on the calf pressing firmly down on the foam to ensure contact.  
The sural nerve conduction velocity and amplitude will be 
recorded at the Enrollment Visit and end of study visit (Day 121).  
Skin Perfusion Pressures  (SPP) : Vasamed Sensilase PAD -IQ 
measures pressure (in mm Hg) of microcirculation using a laser 
Doppler sensor. Patient lies down in supi[INVESTIGATOR_643960] .  The Laser Sensor Assembly (LSA ) is inserted 
into the LSA Placement Guide  and the optical sensor window is 
oriented toward the skin.   For those subjects who will have 
biopsies performed, SPP will be obtained prior to the skin 
biopsies.   A cuff is p osition ed so that the LSA is centered on the 
bladder both horizontally and vertically.  The pressure of the cuff 
is then automatically increased to a pressure necessary to occlude 
blood flow and then released at a controlled rate and a 
measurement of the pressure in the angiosome is made. SPP 
(mmHg) at reactive hyperemia is recorded.  A seco nd measure of 
SPP will be obtained on the plantar aspect of the right foot 
directly below the location where the SPP was performed on the 
dorsal aspect of the right foot.  SPP will be conducted at the 
Enrollment Visit, Day 61, and end of study visit (Day 1 21). 
Pain Intensity  (PI): a validated 11 -point Numeric Pain Rating 
Scale (NPRS) with scores (0 -10) collected as patient -reported 
outcomes on  a paper diary and at the Enrollment visit to obtain a 
baseline value and on Days 61, 75, and 91 to determine respon se. 
On the patient diary, PI [INVESTIGATOR_643961] (8am 
± 2 hours) treatment .  Subjects will report their average pain score 
over the last 24 hours.  Diaries will be distributed and collected 
from the subjects every 2 weeks to ensure complian ce.   
Brief Pain Inventory (BPI):  is a [ADDRESS_861726] on 
specific daily functions.  Cronbach’s alpha reliability ranges from 
0.77-0.91. The BPI [INVESTIGATOR_643962], Day 30, 61, 91, and end of study visit (Day 
121).  
Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI):  is a [ADDRESS_861727] 24 hours.  A global fatigue score  is 
collected by [CONTACT_643989]. Cronbach’s alpha 
reliability ranges from 0. 82-0.97. BFI is patient reported and 
collected at the Enrollment Visit, Days 30, 61, 91, and end of 
study visit (Day 121).  
Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC ): a [ADDRESS_861728] 
changes in pain over the course of treatment.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_469487] y and Depression Scale (HADS):  is a patient 
reported assessment that detects stats of depression and anxiety.  
The subscales within the assessment assess the severity of the 
emotional disorder connected to having diabetic peripheral 
neuropathy.  Subjects will complete the assessment at the 
Enrollment Visit, Days 30, 61, 91, and end of study visit (Day 
121).  
NeuroQo L: is a validated assessment  that measures the effects 
of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and its complications on an 
individual’s quality of lif e. The questionnaire  will be completed 
by [CONTACT_643990] (Day 
121).  
 
Experimental Outcome Assessment  
Skin Biopsy : To assess c -fiber nerve density .  Subjects that 
provide consent to having biopsies taken will have two 3mm 
punch skin biopsies obtained, one biopsy at the distal leg (10cm 
above the lateral malleolus) and one biopsy at the distal thigh 
(10cm above the superior margin of patella) on the right leg at 
the Enrollment Visit.   At least 2 subjects in  each pain phase 
category (2, 3, and 4 Pain Phase) will have a biopsy obtained. 
The biopsy will be shipped overnight to the central lab for 
processing .  At the Day 121 Visit, a second set of biops ies will 
be obtained to the right of each prior biopsy on th e distal leg and 
distal thigh  of the right leg.  The samples will be shipped 
overnight to the central lab for processing.  The lab will assess 
the samples for nerve fiber density and compare to baseline.  
Statistical Considerations  This bi -phasic design includes 2 sequential periods: the Induction 
Phase  and Randomized Withdraw Phase .  All safety analyses will 
[ADDRESS_861729] and time  point.   
Descriptive statistics will be tabulated for all randomized 
subjects for the change from baseline to study day 120 
(Completers Analysis Set), and separately for the change  from 
baseline to the last recorded set of evaluations (End of Study 
Evaluation Set).  This latter set should include all subjects who 
were randomized and complete at least one set of evaluations 
after randomization.  
 
Treatment -emergent adverse events will  be summarized by [CONTACT_24975], 
frequency, severity, and relationship to the study device.  
Adverse events will be provided in a listing .

 I. INTRODUCTION AND BAC KGROUND  
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated the number of d iagnosed and 
undiagnosed level of diabetes mellitus to be 29.1 million people or 9.3% of the [LOCATION_002] 
population.[ADDRESS_861734] 25 years or greater and there has been an association 
with hypertension and obesity.  Acute, aggressive glycemic control has been associated with 
improvement in the severity of neuropathy.  Nonetheless, the sin e qua non for the development and 
severity of diabetic neuropathy is chronic poor glycemic control.3, 4, 5  
Clinical neuropathy syndromes  associated with diabetes mellitus are categorized according to 
their neurologic distribution .  While overlap in presentation exists the categories are as follows: (5)

 Distal symmetric sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSPN) is the most common form of diabetic 
neuropathy and accounts for approximately half of the  diabetic -related neuropathy diagnosed in the 
US.  Clinical presentation and clinical course  of diabetic neuropathy varies  in prevalence associated 
with both the duration of disease and maintenance of adequate glycemic control .  Corresponding to 
length dependent nerve damage, patients present with distal symptoms t hat progress proximately 
affecting the lower extremities more prominently than upper extremities.  Patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_643965].   
Clinical Presentation of  Distal Symmetric Sensorimotor Polyneuropathy (DSPN)  initially 
involves the feet and hands.  DSPN initially affects smaller unmyelinated C -fibers which convey 
light touch, pain and temperature with subsequent progressi on to involve larger myelinated  A delta -
fibers which convey vibratory sensation, proprioception and joint position.  As the disease 
progresses motor function becomes impaired.  Early in the process this may require nerve 
conduction velocity testing and ass essment of reduced deep tendon reflexes (DTR) for detection 
prior to the development of noticeable weakness on flexion or extension of digits.  Progressively 
severe disease may demonstrate weakness with foot and ankle dorsiflexion and extension and grip 
strength. 4,5,6

Microvascular compromise of smaller arterioles demonstrating endothelial dysfunction progressing 
to calcification and dysfunction in larger vasculature add to the complexity of the medical 
presentation with overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_643966].  Diabetic -related metabolic abnormalities lead to 
an impaired immune response to infection and the effect of diabetes on bones, cartilage, tendons 
and fascial tissue causes mec hanical and conformational changes in the architecture of the foot.  
Gait abnormalities, impaired balance and falls frequently ensue.  In advanced peripheral diabetic 
neuropathy,  the patient no longer senses pain developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a loss of the protective sensati on (LOPS),

with insulin resistance and abnormal adiposity leads to the a ccumulation of advanced glycatio n end 
products  (AGE), toxic effects of free fatty acids and pro -inflammatory adipokines .  These factors 
damage nerve fibers, effecting initially smaller unmyelinated C -fibers and progressively advancing 
to damage larger myelinated fibers.  Direct axonal in jury occurs secondary to endothelial injury 
causing endothelial dysfunction, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) levels are reduced leading to small 
vascular vasoconstriction, larger vascular calcifications and constriction, which ultimately result in 
nerve ischem ia.5,6,7      
Therapeutic Intervention for the prevention and treatment of distal symmetric sensorimotor 
polyneuropathy (DSPN)  are generally related to counselling, antioxidant -rich nutrition, optimized 
glycemic control, weight management, moderate exercise , routine foot screening and proper foot 
wear, and avoidance of alcohol and tobacco.  Care must be taken to ensure nondiabetic causes  of 
neuropathy have been assessed and excluded - hereditary, m alignant disease (e.g., bronchogenic 
carcinoma ), metabolic  disorders (e.g., thyroid, renal disease), t oxic (e.g., alcohol) , infective  agents  
(e.g., Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV), Lyme’s, Hepatitis B  infection) , vitamin B 
deficienc ies (e.g., B1, B6, B12, tocopherol), iatrogenic  interventions  (e.g., isoniazid, vinca 
alkaloids , amiodarone, colchicine, Dapsone, Taxol ), heavy metals (e.g., mercury, arsenic), and 
medication -related (chemotherapy, HIV treatment) .(4.5)  Nonetheless,  aside  from adequate glycemic 
control and antioxidants, medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_643968] -based pain control.  The wide variety of medical classifications represented reflect 
the diffuse nature of the disorder a nd the lack of specificity for improvement across the population

While tricyclic antidepressants are the most studied agents used for neuropathic pain, p hysicians 
have been using TCAs, such as amitriptyline and nortriptyline (Pamelor), to treat neuropathic pain 
for years without approved labeling from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).   
Duloxetine  (Cymbalta®)  and pregabalin (Lyrica ®) are the only agents approved by [CONTACT_231663].  Patients frequently 
supplement oral agents with topi[INVESTIGATOR_8588] - includ ing capsaicin 0.075%  cream , doxepin 5% 
solution  or lidocaine  5% patches.  Additionally, topi[INVESTIGATOR_231641],  alpha -lipoic acid antioxidant, and 
homeopathic agents such as evening primrose oil have been reported with variable success in 
reducing neuropathic pain.  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_643972], unresponsive pain.  
In an effort to avoid overuse of opi[INVESTIGATOR_231643], the American Pain Society and 
the Academy of Pain Medicine have generated guidelines that include the use of non -
pharmaceutical interventions currently used to treat chronic pain, Clinical G uidelines for the Use 
of Chronic Opi[INVESTIGATOR_231644] .  Non-pharmaceutical agents such as 
electrical nerve stimulation (E -Stim), a cupuncture, electro -acupuncture, cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT), biofeedback, and physical therapy  (PT) have some usefulness in treating painful 
peripheral DSPN.10 
Trial:   This proof -of-concept (POC) trial is being conducted to evaluate the therapeutic value of 
using pulsed electromagnetic  energy fields  (PEMF ) in the treatment of  diabetic neuropathy .   
Study Product:   PROVANT® Therapy System  is a medical device manufactured by [CONTACT_643991], Inc. (Scottsdale, AZ) , that  has been cleared by [CONTACT_1622]  (K972093, K091791, AND  
K131979) “for adjunctive use in the palliative treatment of post -operative pain and edema in 
superficial soft tissue.” The device delivers self-administered, non -thermal, non -ionizing pulsed 
electromagnetic energy  to the target tissue, using 27.[ADDRESS_861736] the treatment site. The device 
is non -invasive and does not require placement of surface or deep electrodes, nor removal of 
bandages or clothing. Treatment is usually imperceptible and very well tolerated. Evidence suggests 
that PROV ANT® Therapy System  can reduce pain, promote healing, and promote restored range 
of motion following reparative surgery in wounded extremities.  [Guo 2011, Moffett 2011] As  an 
analgesic, it is non -addictive and does not alter the mental state  of the user. R egenesis Biomedical, 
Inc., has marketed the device since [ADDRESS_861737] been administered with rare adverse events reported.  [FDA

 MAUDE Database 2014] In  addition, the safety of PEMF  has been well documented. The 2012 
meta -analysis by [CONTACT_367584]  [Guo 2012] of 25 clinical trials of PEMF  in treatment of pain, edema 
and wound healing identified no serious adverse events among 1,332 patients treated with PEMF. 
In addition, th e same meta -analysis found statistically significant evidence supporting the efficacy 
of adjunctive PEMF  therapy for pain relief, edema reducti on, and wound healing promotion.  
Finally, adjunctive PEMF  therapy has been reported effective in alleviating pai n resulting from 
trauma, [Comorosan 1991, Foley -Nolan 1992, Wilson 1972, Barclay 1983, Pennington 1993, 
Shandles 2002] and chronic pain.  [Foley -Nolan 1990, Wagstaff 1986, Brook 2012].  
In vitro and in vivo  evidence  suggest P EMF  functions by [CONTACT_231665]. In vitro  studies  demonstrated that PEMF  treatment of cells in culture 
can mediate wide -spread changes in transcript levels encoding factors involved in pain and the 
inflamm atory response  (including endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], growth factors, cytokines, and cell cycle 
regulating factors), [Moffett 2011, Moffett 2012, Rohde 2010] and can promote cell proliferation.  
[George 2002] Regenesis Biomedical, Inc. scientists recently found tha t PEMF  increases 
endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_643973], which coincides with an increase in endothelin receptor B in 
keratinocytes, suggesting that P EMF  treatment induces a localized analgesic effect by [CONTACT_643992] -1. [Moffett 2012a,  Moffett 2012b] These  findings have led to the 
proposition that P EMF  activates peripheral endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_643974], in turn, activate an analgesic 
cascade via the endothelin pain axis. In a recent clinical study, P EMF  usage for post -operative pain 
not only  reduced pain levels and opi[INVESTIGATOR_643975] -treated patients, but was also 
associated with lower IL -1ß levels in post -operative wound exudates.  [Rohde 2010] Together , these 
findings suggest that PEMF  therapy reduces pain both by [CONTACT_643993][INVESTIGATOR_2438].  
An exploratory prospective randomized, sham -controlled IRB -approved  study  was recently 
conducted at two sites using the PROVANT® Therapy System  to evaluate small fiber nerve growth 
and function  in subjects with painful peripheral diabetic neuropathy . Twenty -three  subjects with 
painful peripheral diabetic neuropathy were treated for [ADDRESS_861738] of care treatment .  
Eighteen  subjects in this study were evaluated for the effectiveness of t he PROVANT® Therapy 
System  in enhancing small fiber nerve growth and function .  PEMF  treatment twice daily for 60  
days was associated with improved skin perfusion pressure , and improved nerve conduction .   
The purpose of the current study is to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms of increased 
sensation and pain relief observed in pa tients receiving treatment with the PROVANT® Therapy 
System .   In vitro studies have provided evidence that P EMF  therapy improves nerve growth and 
may improve nerve function through up -regulation of genes involved in neurogenesis. [Data on 
File] In addition, genes related to angiogenesis have also been shown to be up -regulated.  Through 
evaluation of vibration perce ption threshold, nerve conduction velocity, quantitative sensory 
testing, vascular changes (skin perfusion pressure), blood glucose (hemoglobin A1c), and quality

 of life questionnaires, this study will evaluate if PEMF treatment in vibration perception and  skin 
perfusion is enhanced in subjects that receive treatment with Provant compared to a group of 
subjects that receive treatment with a sham device.

study site . Recruitment efforts will be supplemented with  IRB approved  internet , radio 
and/or print advertising as necessary.  
F. Randomization  
The schedule for randomization of subject s and allocation to treatment will be prepared 
using SAS® (Statistical Analysis System; Cary, NC) to create a comp uter-generated scheme 
based on a permuted block algorithm. The randomization schedule will randomize  in a 1:1 
ratio (active  : sham ) to a device based on the randomization kit numbers. The kit numbers 
will be assigned sequentially to subjects that qualify for inclusion into the study.  
G. Device Description   
The PROVANT® Therapy System  is a solid -state, fixed -power output radio frequency 
generator and transmitter designed to operate at the Federal Communication Commission 
(FCC) authorized medical device frequency of 27.[ADDRESS_861750] RF 
energy, and single -use Disposable Applicator Covers  (DACs)  intended to minimize 
contagion transmission and help protect the treatment applicator from biological 
contamination .  Key functions and featur es of these components are as follows:  
1. Control Unit   
The control unit contains the main electronics, software, and user interface of the 
system.  The control panel has a therapy Start/Stop switch and two therapy status 
indicators, described below, which are located on the top of the control panel, as well as 
a usage meter on the side of control panel.   
Pressing the therapy Start/Stop switch initiates a preset, thirty (30) -minute therapy 
session by [CONTACT_643996] (RFID) tag interrogation 
and treatment sequence described in greater detail below.  Pressing the therapy start/stop 
30 
 
710-7005 01 F  Protocol RBI.2017.001  Version F CONFIDENTIAL  
 switch again after a therapy session has started will stop the RF energy generation.  
When pressed, the therapy Start/Stop switch generates an audible tone to inform the user 
that therapy is being initiated or terminated.  
The two-therapy  status indicators on the control panel indicate  when therapy is 
underway and the amount of time (in minutes) remaining in the ther apy session.  When 
treatment is initiated, the message “ CPI [INVESTIGATOR_643976] ” is displayed  and green bars scroll 
from left to right across the indicator window.  When the thirty -minute therapy session 
is concluded, the generation of RF energy is automatically termi nated, the therapy status 
indicator windows go blank, and a brief audible beep is generated to alert the user t hat 
the treatment is finished. The user will then be  instructed to turn off the power switch, 
remove the used Disposable Applicator Cover, and store the treatment applicator and 
cable until the next use.    
In this study, the subject  will treat both feet for [ADDRESS_861751] 60 
days (and up to 90 days) with active devices , and then continue to treat after 
randomization until Day 120.  Response to treatment for randomization will be assessed  
at Day s 61, 75, or 91 .  
2. Disposable Applicator Covers.   
The PROVANT® Therapy System  features Disposable Applicator Covers, which are 
placed over the treatment applicator (described below) before each therapy session.  The 
Disposable Applicator Covers of the PEMF  system are single -use-only and are intended 
to minimize contagion transmissio n and help protect the treatment applicator from 
biological contamination .  Embedded in the Disposable Applicator Covers is RFID 
reader functionality that is controlled by [CONTACT_643997].  This 
software prevents the reuse of a Disposa ble Applicator Cover by [CONTACT_643998] a new 
Disposable Applicator Cover is in place before allowing the generation and delivery  of 
the therapeutic RF energy.  If the user attempts to reuse a cover, the device recognizes 
the RFID tag on the cover at start  up as “used” and will generate an audible alert to 
inform the user to replace the used cover with a new cover.  If the user attempts to use 
the device without a Disposable Applicator Cover in place over the treatment applicator, 
the device will generate an audible alert to remind the user to place a new cover.  In 
either scenario, the PEMF  system will not initiate a therapy session until a new 
Disposable Applicator Cover is in place.  The used Disposable Applicator Cover s will 
be discarded as standard (not bio -hazard) waste . 
3. Treatment Applicator   
The PEMF  system delivers pulsed RF energy to the desired treatment area via a spi[INVESTIGATOR_643977].  The treatment applicator contains a therapy emitter, 
an antenna matching circuit, and an RF therapy measuring circuit.  The RF therapy 
measuring circuit automatically detects the level of RF signal that is radiated from the 
[ADDRESS_861752] energy output is 
constantly monitored, regulate d, and maintained at the preset  therapy dose  levels.  
The PROVANT® Therapy System  generates pulsed RF energy using a highly efficient 
Class -C RF amplifier.  Subjects randomized to active treatment will receive treatment 
consisting  of a pulse duration of 42 ± 4 microseconds, repeated every 1000 ± 25 
microseconds, resulting in an output duty cycle of 4.2%, and requiring an average RF 
forward power level of <[ADDRESS_861753] RF energy emitted from the treatment applicator is preset at 591 
± 44 V/m at a distance of 5.[ADDRESS_861754] sub -
assembly.  If the RF therapy measuring circuit in the treatment applicator detects an 
absent or out of range therapy dosage level, treatment will not occur and the message 
“Service Required” will be displayed on the LED indicator window.  In such  an event, 
the research center will trouble shoot the issue as instructed in the Instruction Manual  
which accompanies the study device, and if unsuccessful in resolving the matter, will 
contact [CONTACT_643999] a replacement device.   
H. Logistics and De vice Accountability   
The study devices  will be shipped  via courier (FedEx) delivery or hand delivered  when 
possible  to the investigator or designee at regular  intervals or as needed during the study.  
The investigator or delegated designee  will ensure that all study devices are stored in a 
secured area, in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.  
Study d evice accountability will be overseen by [CONTACT_644000] . These records should conta in the dates, quantities of device received by [CONTACT_1275], dispensed to specified subjects , or returned to sponsor. These inventories, 
along with shipment receipts  must be made available  for inspection by [CONTACT_644001] a gency inspectors. At the conclusion of the study, photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_643978].  
I. Labeling  
The label on each study device kit  will contain the protocol number and  kit number . There 
will be sufficient space for study personnel to write the subject  number, date dispensed, and 
the initials of the dispenser  on the distribution label.  
[ADDRESS_861755] or his/her family or caregiver  in the home or similar setting.  
The first treatmen t with the study device s will be administered on the morning of the day 
following the E nrollment Visit (Day 1) at 8 am (+ 2 hours). Subjects will assume a 
comfortable position and place their feet (both feet will be treated) on the treatment 
applicator s of the PEMF device s, centering the applicator s under the plantar surface (bottom 
of foot) of each foot as identified by [CONTACT_093] . Treatment will be administered  
continuously  for 30 minutes  on both feet  simultaneously . Thereafter, subjects will self -
administer treatments twice daily, at 8am  (± 2 hours) and  8pm ( ± 2 hours) up to Day 120  
(Day 91 for non -responders) .  
Prior to initiation of each treatment session, the subject  will take t he treatment applicator of 
each study device and insert it into a new Disposable Applicator Cover. When inserted 
properly, the yellow starburst logo on the treatment applicator is aligned with the same logo 
on the Disposable Applica tor Cover, and the words “This side t oward s patient” will  be 
visible through the clear window of the Disposable Applicator Cover.  When applied to the 
subject ’s feet, the side of the treatment applicator with the yellow starburst logo is directed 
toward the bottom of the foot (plantar surface) .  Further directio ns for use for the PEMF 
system are found in the Instruction Manual .  Upon completion of the treatment session, the 
subject will remove and discard the Disposable Applicator Cover s, and store the PEMF 
device s until the time of the next scheduled treatment session.  Disposable Applicator 
Covers may be discarded as standard waste.  
K. Blinding  
At the start of this study, all subjects will receive active devices.  At Day 61, Day 75, or Day 
91, if the subject becomes a responder based on a 1-point  decrease in the average pain score  
using the Numeric Pain Rating S cale, the subject will be rand omized 1:1 (active : sham) . 
The sham devices will be PEMF  devices that are de -activated such that no radiofrequency 
energy is generated or delivered when the device is started. All other functions, including 
the start sequence, display lights, audible start -beep and fa n operation of the s ham devices 
are identical to that of the active PEMF devices. Sham devices are indistinguisha ble from 
the active PEMF  devices being used in the study.  The subjects , research  personnel  at the 
investigative site, and sponsor  will be fully blinded to the randomization assignment and 
unable to differentiate active and sham devices.    
L. Study  Assessments  
All efficacy outcome measures will be assessed in order to allow for characterization of the 
response to PEMF therapy . All efficacy assessments will be conducted at the Enrollment 
Visit (Baseline; Day 0) and at the end of study visit (Day 121) .

710-7005 01 F  Protocol RBI.2017.001  Version F CONFIDENTIAL  
 1. Primary Efficacy Assessment s 
Vibratory Perception Threshold (VPT):   For large nerve fiber assessment.  VPT is a 
non-invasive test used in quantifying sensation/sensitivity to vibration in evaluating 
sensory dysfunction associated with diabetic neuropathy .  The hand -held vibratory 
stimulator will be placed against the midpoint of the plantar aspect and big toe of  the right 
foot; the tester will initiate the automated test that will last between [ADDRESS_861756] and on the big toe of the right foot.  VPT will be collected 
at the Enrollment Visit to obtain a baseline value and on Days 15, 30, 45, 61, 75, 91, 105 
and 121.   
Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) : For small nerve fiber assessment.  QST  is a 
noninvasive test used in peripheral nervous system disorders for thermal sen sory testing.  
Contact [CONTACT_644002] a 
contact [CONTACT_291236].  A cold test of 15°C - 25°C and heat test of 40°C - 46°C will be 
administered.  When activated the patient will notify the staff performing the test when 
they begin to feel the cold and warm test.  The heat and cold thermal stimulation will be 
applied over the dorsal  aspect of the right  foot.  QST will be performed at the Enrollment 
Visit to obtain a baseline value and on Days 15, 30, 45, 61, 75, 91, 105 and 121.   
2. Secondary Efficacy Assessment  
Nerve Conduction Velocity (NCV) : For large myelinated nerve fiber assessments.  Using 
the NC -stat® DPNCheck®, the subject will assume a comfortable position so that their right  
leg is visible (that the subject’s outer ankle bone and Achilles tendon are visible). The 
patient preparation pad is then used to thoroughly clean the subject’s outer lower right leg 
and ankle bone area to remove any residue.  The subject’s right outer an kle bone is the n 
identified to align the anode and cathode just behind with the cathode just adjacent to the 
middle of the ankle bone.  The device is aligned on the calf pressing firmly down on the 
foam to ensure contact.  The sural nerve conduction veloci ty and amplitude will be recorded 
at the Enrollment Visit and end of study visit (Day 121). An increase in velocity and a 
decrease in amplitude would be considered clinically meaningful.  
Skin Perfusion Pressures : Vasamed Sensilase PAD -IQ measures pressure (in mm Hg) of 
microcirculation using a laser Doppler sensor. The p atient lies down in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_643979] .  The Laser Sensor Assembly (LSA ) is inserted into the LSA 
Placement Guide  and the optical sensor window is oriented toward  the skin.   For those 
subjects who will have biopsies performed, SPP will be obtained prior to the skin biops ies.  
A cuff is p osition ed so that the LSA is centered on the bladder both horizontally and 
vertically.  The pressure of the cuff is then automatically increased to a pressure necessary 
to occlude blood flow and then released at a controlled rate and a measurement of the 
34 
 
710-7005 01 F  Protocol RBI.2017.001  Version F CONFIDENTIAL  
 pressure in the angiosome is made. SPP (mmHg) at reactive hyperemia is recorded.  A 
second measure of SPP will be obtained on the plantar aspect of the right foot directly below 
the location where the SPP was performed on the dorsal aspect of the right foot.  SPP will 
be conducted at the Enrollment Visit, Day 61, and end of study visit (Day 1 21).  An increase 
in SPP would be considered clinically meaningful.  
Pain Intensity  (PI): a validated 11 -point Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) with scores 
(0-10) collected as patient -reported outcomes on  a paper diary , at Screening for eligibility,  
at the Enrollment Visit  for a baseline value , and Days 61, 75 and 91 to assess response ( 1-
point  decrease from baseline in average pain score over the last 24 hours) . On the diary, PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_643961] (8am ± 2 hours) treatment .  Subject s will report their 
average pain score over the last 24 hours.  Diaries will be distributed and collected from the 
subjects every 2 weeks to ensure compliance.   
Brief Pain Inventory (BPI):  is a [ADDRESS_861757] on specific daily functions.  Cronbach’s alpha reliability 
ranges from 0. 77-0.91. The BPI [INVESTIGATOR_643980], Day 
30, 61, 91, an d end of study visit (Day 121).  The change from baseline will be captured and 
assessed.  
Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI):  is a [ADDRESS_861758] 24 hours.  A  global fatigue score 
is collected by [CONTACT_643989]. Cronbach’s alpha reliability ranges from 
0.82-0.97. BFI is patient reported and collected at the Enrollment Visit, Days 30, 61, 91, 
and end of study visit (Day 121).  The change from bas eline will be captured and assessed.  
Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) : a [ADDRESS_861759] changes in pain over the course of treatment.    
In a single question, subjects will be asked to describe their overall status compared to the 
start of the study (“Since the start of the study, my overall status is:”), and to score it as 
either very much worse, much worse, minimally worse, no change, minimally improved, 
much improved or very much improved ( Appendix C).  “Much Improved” and “Very Much 
Improved” are considered clinically meaningful results.[ADDRESS_861760] changes in pain over the course of 
treatment.  
                                                           
 
35 
 
710-7005 01 F  Protocol RBI.2017.001  Version F CONFIDENTIAL  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS):  is a patient reported assessment that 
detects stats of depression and anxiety.  The subscales within the assessment assess the 
severity of the emotional disorder connected to having diabetic peripheral neuropathy.  
Subjects will complete the assessment at  the Enrollment Visit, Days 30, 61, 91, and end of 
study visit (Day 121).  
NeuroQo L: is a validated measure that measures the effects of diabetic peripheral 
neuropathy and its complications on an individual’s quality of life. The questionnaire will 
be compl eted by [CONTACT_643990] (Day 121).  
3. Exploratory Efficacy Assessment  
Biopsy:  To assess c -fiber nerve density when  treatment with Provant  is administered.  
Biopsies will be taken from  subjects that consent to them b eing taken .  At least 2 subjects 
per pain phase category will be consented.  One biopsy will  be obtained at the distal leg, 
10cm above the lateral malleolus on the  right  leg.  A second biopsy will be obtained at the 
distal thigh, 10cm above the superior margin of the patella on the right leg.  Both biopsies 
will be taken  at the Enrollment Visit.   The biops ies will be shipped overnight to the central 
lab.  At the Day 121 Visit, a second set of biops ies will be obtained to the right of the 
baseline biopsies  on the same subjects that consented at enrollment and shipped overnight 
to the central lab .  At the end of the study, the biopsies will be compared to  assess nerve 
fiber density.  
4. Additional Study Assessments  
Measurement of Ankle -Brachial Index (ABI): Subject is in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], with the 
arms and legs at the same level as the heart for a minimum of 10 minutes before 
measurement to obtain the ABI measurement.  ABI will be measured at the Screening Visit 
and the end of study visit (Day 121) on both l egs.  At Day 121, for those subjects who will 
have biopsies performed, ABI will be completed prior.  The change from baseline will be 
captured and assessed.  
Measurement of Foot Thickness:  The depth of the foot (H) will be measured from the 
most inferior asp ect of the medial malleolus to the plantar aspect of the foot when residing 
36 
 
710-7005 01 F  Protocol RBI.2017.001  Version F CONFIDENTIAL  
 on the treatment pad  (see diagram below) .  The depth should not be more than 8cm for 
inclusion in the trial.  
 
 
Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) Test:  provides the average level of glucose i n the blood over 
the past [ADDRESS_861761], the A1C Now® System will be used, subjects will have 
a finger stick to collect 5µL of blood to obtain the A1c value at the Screening Visit to obtain 
eligibility (and baseline).  At the end of the stu dy visit (Day 121) the A1c will be collected 
and compared to the baseline value.  Each subject will have a A1C Now® System assigned 
to them.  The change from baseline will be captured and assessed.    
Blood Glucose:  measures the amount of sugar in the blood at the time of collection.  A 
TRUE METRIX® PRO Professional Monitoring Blood Glucose System will be assigned to 
each subject for the course of the study.  Subjects will have a finger stick to collect 5µL of 
blood to measure their glucose value at the  Enrollment Visit and on Days 30, 61, 91, and 
121.  The American Diabetes Association’s goals for blood glucose control in patients with 
diabetes is 70 to 130 mg/dL before meals and less than 180mg/dL after meals.  
Subject adherence:  compliance with twice d aily treatment with the study device will be 
assessed verbally during the Day 3 telephone call, at the interim visits and upon completion 
of the study.  At each of the interim visits, subjects will be required to bring in their devices 
to ensure compliance  by [CONTACT_644003].  
Treatment Satisfaction:  will be obtained at Days 15, 30, 45, 61, 75, 91, 105, and end of 
study visit to assess the patients level of satisfaction with the treatment.  Once subjects are 

37 
 
710-7005 01 F  Protocol RBI.2017.001  Version F CONFIDENTIAL  
 randomized, they will also be asked which device (active of sham) they believe they were 
rando mized to at Day 121 (blinding assessment).  
5. Safety  Assessments  
Safety will be assesse d through review of AE reports and concomitant treatment s and 
medications . All concomitant drug or non -drug treatments used during the study will be

1. Allowed Medications  
Subjects will be allowed to continue their regimen of analgesic medications from the time 
of the Screening Visit through and including the Day 121 visit. In this context, “anal gesic 
medications” refers to medications prescribed and administered for the treatment of pain, 
and includes but is not limited to anticonvulsants, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory 
agents, anti -depressants and muscle relaxants. As such, this include s medications taken on 
an “as needed” (prn) basis as well as those medications taken on a regular schedule. Subjects 
may continue to take prn medications on an ad lib basis in response to their pain experience. 
Subjects who experience increased pain during the study will be instructed to increase the 
self-administration of their prescribed prn analgesic(s). Subjects may choose to reduce or 
discontinue prn opi[INVESTIGATOR_643981], and will be specifically instructed to do so by [CONTACT_644007].  
Medications prescribed for other indications are allowed and will be recorded as 
concomitant medications.  Low dose a spi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (acetylsalicylic aci d) 81 mg is allowed if  taken 
for cardiac or vascular prophylaxis.  
2. Prohibited Medications /Treatments

VI. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
The statistical analysis of the study is described in detail in a separate version -controlled prospective 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  However, the statistical methodology described in this section of 
the protocol will be the basis for the detailed SAP.    
This bi -phasic design includes 2 sequential perio ds: the Induction Phase  and Randomized Withdraw 
Phase .  All safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Analysis Set , defined as all subjects who 
were enrolled into the study and issued study devices during the Induction Phase  and followed 
through the Randomization Withdraw Phase  or until they withdraw.   Once a subject is determined 
to be eligible, the subject will be issued active treatment devices and the subject will be formally 
enrolled into the study and become part of the Safety Analysis Set .  Wh ere not otherwise specified, 
the last pre -treatment observation will be used as baseline for calculating post -treatment changes 
from baseline.  
A. Induction Phase / Baseline Evaluations  
Prior to study treatment, subjects will complete the baseline health econ omic questions,  including 
the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_226467] (HADS), and the NeuroQoL .  Vibration Perception Threshold ( VPT), Quantitative Sensory 
Test (QST) and Nerve Conduction Velocity (NCV) will be completed .  Skin Perfusion Pressure

Listings will also include the number of days relative to the initiation of treatment.  Two set s of 
analyses will be generated; summary tabulations for all randomized subjects who complete the 
baseline and study day 120 evaluations ( Completers Analysis Set ), and all randomized subjects 
using the baseline and last recorded set of evaluations ( End of Study Evaluation Set ).  This latter set 
should include all subjects who were randomized and complete at least one set of evaluations after 
randomization.   
Specific algorithms will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan for imputing missing or  
partially missing dates, if deemed appropriate, under specific data topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102].  Imputed or derived data 
will be flagged in the individual subject data listings.  Imputed data will not be incorporated into 
any raw or primary datasets.  The imputed data will be reta ined in the derived / analysis datasets.  
The total duration for a subject on-study  will be calculated as the difference between the date of 
initial study treatment in the Induction Phase  and the last day of observation plus 1 day.  All 
calculations for def ining the duration on -study will follow the algorithm DURATION = [STUDY 
COMPLETION OR WITHDRAW DATE – INITIAL TREATMENT DATE +  1].   
Summary statistics will consist of the count and percentage in each level for categorical variables, 
and the sample size (n) mean, median, standard deviation (SD), minimum, and maximum values 
for continuous variables.  All mean and median values will be fo rmatted to one more decimal place 
[ADDRESS_861774] deviation values will be formatted to two more decimal places 
than the measured value.  Minimum and maximum values will be presented with the same number 
of decimal places as the measured  value.  The number and percentage of responses will be presented 
in the form XX (XX.X%).  Pairwise differences between the treatment groups will be calculated 
and 95% confidence intervals constructed.   
While no formal hypothesis testing is planned, proba bility values may be generated to determine 
the magnitude of the difference between subject groups for an endpoint.  All p -values that round to 
0.0000 will be presented as ‘<0.0001’ and p -values that round to 1.0000 will be presented as 
‘>0.9999’.  P -value s <0.05 will be discussed as being statistically significant.   
All summary tables will include the analysis population sample size (i.e., number of subjects).

for presentation.   Where appropriate, only the measurements from the right foot will be used in the 
calculations.  
D. Adverse Events  
All summaries of adverse events will be based on treatment -emergent adverse events.  Adverse 
events will be provided in a listing .  The number and percentage of subjects experiencing adverse 
events will be summarized. Summaries by [CONTACT_644009] 
(active or sham) will also be provided. Serious adverse events and adverse events leading to 
discontinuation from the study will be presented.  Treatment -related adverse events will be defined 
as adverse events with investigato r assessment of related or possibly related.  In summaries of 
adverse events  by [CONTACT_132628], patients reporting multiple epi[INVESTIGATOR_231652], respectively.  Ser ious 
adverse events will also be presented by [CONTACT_72843]. The number of patients with at 
least one adverse event will be tabulated for each treatment group.  The number of adverse events 
for each treatment group will also be tabulated.  
E. Sampl e Size  
This is a proof of concept study with no formal hypothesis testing planned and therefore there is no 
power associated with this study.  The sample size of 40 patients is a sample of convenience for 
this study.  
VII.  INFORMED CONSENT  
It is the responsibi lity of the investigator, or a person designated by [CONTACT_093] (if acceptabl e 
by [CONTACT_427]), to obtain written informed consent from each individual participating in this 
study after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, objectives and p otential hazards of the study.  
It must also be explained to the subject s that they are completely free to refuse to enter the study or 
48 
 
710-7005 01 F  Protocol RBI.2017.001  Version F CONFIDENTIAL  
 to withdraw from it at any time for any reason.  Appropriate IRB-approved forms for obtaining 
written informed consent will be provided by [CONTACT_644010] , Inc.  or 
their designee.  
If new safety information results in significant changes in the risk/benefit assessment, the consent 
form will be reviewed and updated if necessary.  All subject s (inc luding those already being treated) 
will be informed of the new information, given a copy of the revised form and be re -consent ed to 
continue in the study.  
VIII.  INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW  BOARD  
This protocol , the informed consent form  and any accompanying material pr ovided to the subject  
(such as subject  information  sheets or descriptions of the study used to obtain informed consent) as 
well as any advertising or compensation given to the subject , will be submitted by [CONTACT_231683]’s designee to an IRB.  Approval from the IRB must be obtained before starting the 
study and should be documented in a letter to the investigator specifying the date on which the IRB 
met and granted the approval.  
IX. TERMINATION  OF THE INVESTIGATIO N 
As the study sponsor, Regene sis Biomedical, Inc.  reserves the right to terminate the study at any 
time.  Should early termination be necessary, Regenesis Biomedical, Inc.  and the investigator  will 
consult and make sure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of subject s’ interests.  
Additionally, all clinical investigational data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_231684] a regular basis.  
Reports of all data will be made available to the Institutional Review Boards and to the FDA  as 
required .  Unanticipated adverse device  events will be evaluated and reported in accordance with 
21 CFR Part 812 requirements and as required by [CONTACT_114021].  
The clinical investigation will be suspended if the investigator or the sponsor , upon review and 
evaluation of the clinical data, f inds the severity or incidence of single or total adverse events  
unacceptable for continuation of the investigation.  
X. ADVERSE EVENTS AND UNANTICIPATED ADVERS E DEVICE EFFECTS  
A. Adverse Events  
An adverse event is defined as follows:   Any untoward medical occur rence in a patient or clinical 
investigation patient administered a medical device treatment which does not necessarily have to 
have a causal relationship with this treatment.   An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnorm al laboratory finding), symptom, or disease tempora lly 
associated with the use of study  device  treatment, whether or not considered related to the study  
device .   
All AEs occurring after signing of the consent form will be recorded. AEs arising subsequent to the 
time of initiation of first trea tment with study  device  will be considered treatment emergent AEs .   
[ADDRESS_861776] be recorded in the patient’s chart . 
Any events involving illnesses or injuries with onset during t he study or any events involving 
exacerbations of pre -existing illnesses should be recorded.   All clearly related signs and symptoms 
should be grouped together and recorded as a single diagnosis in the patient’s chart .  A pre -existing 
condition must not be  reported as an AE unless the condition worsens during the trial.      
Each AE will be independently judged by [CONTACT_231685] .  The following 
definitions will be used for these causality assessments.  
Related:            This causal relationship is assigned when the AE:  
 starts a reasonable time after study device administration,  
 cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_423] ’s clinical state.  
Possibly Related:   This causal relationship is assigned when the AE:  
 starts a reasonable time after study device administration, but  
 could have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical state or other 
modes of therapy administered to the subject . 
Unrelated:        This causal relationship is assigned when the AE:  
 is definitely not associated with the study device administered 
and is readily explained by [CONTACT_231686].  
Each AE will also be independently judged by [CONTACT_231687] .  The following 
definitions will be used for these severity  assessments.  
Mild :           The event is transient (<48 hours)  or causes mild discomfort; no 
medical intervention/therapy is required  
Moderate :  The event results in mild to moderate limitation in activity – some 
assistance may be needed; no or minimal medical 
intervention/therapy is re quired  
Severe :       The event results in marked limitation in activity, assistance is 
usually required; medical intervention/therapy is required and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_643982] .  A serious 
adverse event ( SAE ) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that:  
 Results in death, or  
 Is life -threatening,  
50 
 
710-7005 01 F  Protocol RBI.2017.001  Version F CONFIDENTIAL  
 Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in 
which the subject  was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
 Results in permanent impairment of a body fun ction or permanent damage to a body 
structu re,  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect,  
 Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude any one of the outcomes 
listed in this definition . 
All SAEs must be reported  immediately  (within 24 hours of kn owledge of the event) by [CONTACT_231689]:  
Sponsor Medical Contact – Adrianne P.S. (Patti) Smith , MD; Regenesis Biomedical Inc.  
Mobile: ([PHONE_13388] ; Fax: ([PHONE_13389] ; [EMAIL_12281]  
The investigator  will follow up with a written description of the SAE submitted to the sponsor 
within 3 days, including the results of the SAE investigation and any treatment(s) provided.  
All adverse events will be followed until resolution or until the investigator assesses the subject’s  
status has returned to normal.  
B. Anticipated  Adverse Device Effects Associated with Provant  Therapy System   
Anticipated adverse events associated with PROVANT® Therapy System  2  and the procedures and 
medicines used in the study are as follows:  
 Device fails to operate  
 Warmth or burning at treatment site    
 Skin reaction at treatment site (tingling, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2115] -and-needles, rash, blisters, swelling, dry skin, 
redness, nu mbness)  
 Increased bleeding at surgical site  
 Chilliness  
 Headache  
 Malaise  
 Nausea  
 Abdominal or chest wall discomfort  
 Muscle cramps  
 Excessive menstruation  
 Failure to reduce pain or an increase in pain  
                                                           
[ADDRESS_861777] (UADE)  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect means any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any 
life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or 
death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the protocol or 
informed consent form , or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with the device that 
relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects .  The protocol  will contain all of the anticipated 
Adverse Eve nts that could be associated with the study.  
All UADE s must be reported  immediately  (within 24 hours of knowledge of the event) by [CONTACT_231689]:  
Sponsor Medical Contact – Adrianne P.S. (Patti) Smith , MD; Regenesis Biomedical Inc.; 
Mobile: ([PHONE_13388] ; Fax: ([PHONE_13389] ; [EMAIL_12281]  
The investigator  will follow up with a written description of the UADE  submitted to the sponsor 
within 3 days , including the results of the UADE investigation and any treatment(s) provided.  
Any UADE  occurring up to the date of the final Follow -up Visit will be followed until it resolves, 
the investigator assesses the subject’s  status to have returned to baseline , or until the investigator 
feels that the event is stable and chronic.  
The investigator shall submit to the reviewing IRB a report of any UADE occurring during an 
investigation as soon as possible in accordance with the IRB submission guidelines, but in n o event 
later than [ADDRESS_861778].  
XI. INVESTIGATOR’S  FILES/RETENTION OF DOCUMENTS  
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study to 
be fully documented and the  study data to be subsequently verified.  These documents should be 
classified into two different separate categories (1) Investigator’s Study File, and (2) Subject  
clinical source documents. The Investigator’s Study File will contain the protocol/amendments, 
data collection forms , Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board and governmental 
approval with correspondence, sample informed consent, device re cords, staff curriculum vitae and 
authorization forms and other appropriate documents/correspondence. All records defined  in [ADDRESS_861779]  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic records, physician’s and nur se’s 
notes, appointment book, original lab reports, special assessment reports, signed informed consent 
forms, subject  screening and enrollment logs.   
The investigator  must keep these two categories of documents on file for at least [ADDRESS_861780] of the following: completion, discontinuation of the study, or the regulatory submission for 
which the study is being performed is no longer under review.  After that period of time the 
documents may be destroyed, subject  to local regulations.  
[ADDRESS_861781] be made between the investigator  and Regenesis  
Biomedical, Inc.  to store these in a sealed container(s) off-site so that they can be returned sealed 
to the investigator  in case of a regulatory audit.  Where  source documents are required for the 
continued care of the subject , appropriate copi[INVESTIGATOR_231654].  
A. Source Documents and Background Data  
The investigator shall supply the sponsor on request with any required background data   
from the study documentation or clinic records.  This is particularly important when data 
requires clarification .  In case of special problems/and or governmental quer ies or requests 
for audit inspections, it is also necessary to have access to the complete study records, 
provided that subject  confidentiality is protected.   
All forms should be typed or filled out using indelible ink, and must be legible.  Errors 
should be crossed out but not obliterated, the correction inserted, and the change initialed 
and dated by [CONTACT_15009]/her authorized delegate.   
B. Audits and Inspections  
The investigator should understand that source documents for this trial should be m ade 
available to appropriately qualified personnel from the Regenesis  Biomedical, Inc.  Quality 
Assurance Unit or its designees or to health authority inspectors after appropriate 
notification.  The verification of the data must be by [CONTACT_644011] s ource documents  
and patient charts . 
XII. MONITORING THE STUDY  
It is understood that the responsible Regenesis  Biomedical, Inc.  monitor (or designee) will contact 
[CONTACT_231690], upon request, to inspect the various reco rds 
of the trial ( source documents and other pertinent data) provided that subject  confidentiality is 
maintained in accord with local requirements.  
It will be the monitor’s responsibility to inspect the patient charts  at regular intervals throughout 
the st udy to verify the adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency and accuracy of 
the data.  The monitor should have access to laboratory test reports and other subject  records needed.  
The investigator (or his/her designee ) agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any 
problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved.  
XIII.  CONFIDENTIALITY OF T RIAL DOCUMENTS AND SUBJECT  RECORDS  
The investigator must assure that subject s’ anonymity will be maintain ed and that their identities 
are protected from unauthorized parties.  On documents submitted to the sponsor, subject s should 
not be identified by [CONTACT_2249], but by [CONTACT_1209].  The investigator should keep a 
[ADDRESS_861782] s’ written consent forms, 
in strict confidence.  
XIV. PUBLICATION OF DATA AND PROTECTION OF TR ADE SECRETS  
The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings.  If this is foreseen, 
the investigator agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to Regenesis Biomedical, Inc.  at least 
[ADDRESS_861783] editorial and ethical practice, Regenesis Biomedical, Inc.  will generally 
support publication of multicenter trials only in their entirety and not as individual center data.  In 
this case, a coordinating investigat or will be designated by [CONTACT_11402].  Any formal 
publication of the study in which input of Regenesis Biomedical , Inc.  personnel exceeded that of 
conventional monitoring will be considered as a joint publication by [CONTACT_231691], Inc.  personnel.  Authorship will be determined by [CONTACT_231692].

Measurement of Ankle -Brachial Index  
1. Place the patient in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], with the arms and legs at the same level as the heart, for a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_861789] an appropriately sized blood pressure cuff for both the ankle and the arms (see the images below); 
the cuff width should be, at a minimum, 20% greater than the diameter of the extremity.  
a. For the brachial systolic pressure, m ake sure y ou have appropriately sized upper -extremity cuff.  
b. For the ankle systolic pressures, m ake sure that cuff completely encircles lower extremity. The 
ankle cuff should go on the leg between the malleolus and the calf. Enough room should be left 
below both cuf fs to permit placement of the ultrasound gel, so that the Doppler device can 
adequately detect the brachial, dorsalis pedis (DP), and posterior tibial pulses (PT).  
 
3. Obtain the brachial systolic pressures of both arms (see the images below), and choose the higher of the 
2 values as the brachial systolic pressure (the difference between them should be less than 10 mm Hg). 
The brachial pulse is best appreciated on the medial side of the antecubital fossa.  
 
4. Obtain the anterior tibial and posterior tibial  systolic pressures of the extremity in question (see the 
images below), and select the higher of the [ADDRESS_861790] small amou nt of ultrasound transmission gel at landmark where the artery 
was located. Locate artery with Doppler device. Posterior tibial artery is located and marked with gel. 
Identify artery with Doppler device. Upon application of Doppler probe, arterial pulsatio ns should be 
audible. If they are not, reposition probe until appropriate sound is obtained.  
 
5. Do not obscure artery with cuff; you will need to be able to palpate artery and/or locate it with Doppler 
device. As with each appropriately identified arterial s ite, mark site with ultrasound transmission gel 
after palpation.  Locate artery with device. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], Doppler probe must be positioned at 45 -60 
degrees, not at 90 degrees as shown.  
 
6. Finally, divide the ankle pressure by [CONTACT_644013]; the result is the ABI.

VENOUS INSUFFICIENCY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (CEAP)  
For the initial assessment of a patient  with venous insufficiency , the clinical severity is established by 
[CONTACT_4171] (without any specialized testing).  The classification system increases in severity from C0 -C6 
as noted below.  
 
Patients with C3 -6 disease demonstrate an  increasing severity of chronic venous insufficiency with chronic 
irrever sible functional abnormality of the venous system.  Patients with foot edema that typi[INVESTIGATOR_643984] a C2 (as long as they do not also meet criterion for C5 or C6).  Patients 
with persistent ankle edema, gaiter lip oderma tosclerosis, and history of a healed ulcer or current open ulcer 
will be excluded from the trial as a consequence of their increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a chronic non -
healing venous ulcer after biopsy.  
 
Grade  Description  
C 0 No evidence of venous disease.  
C 1 Superficial spi[INVESTIGATOR_400598] (reticular veins) only   
C 2 Simple varicose veins only  
C 3 Ankle edema of venous origin (not foot edema)  
C 4 Skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_643985] ( lipodermatosclerosis ) 
C 5 A healed venous ulcer  
C 6 An open venous ulcer

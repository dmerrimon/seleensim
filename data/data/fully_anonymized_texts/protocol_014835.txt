•To assess time to splenic progression for subjects treated with MMB versus DAN
•To explore  potential correlates with response including but not limited to  mutational analysis
•To explore health care utilization requirements for MMB versus DAN
Trial  Design:  
This is a randomized, double -blind study intended to confirm the differentiated clinical benefit of 
MMB versus DAN in subjects who have previously received approved Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor 
therapy for MF for a minimum of 90 days, or a minimum of 28 days if JAK inhibitor therapy was 
complicated by [CONTACT_725229] ≥ 4 units in 8 weeks, or Grade 3 /4 adverse events 
(AEs) of thrombocytopenia, anemia, or hematoma. Subjects must be symptomatic with a MFSAF TSS 
of ≥ 10 at Screening , and anemic with hemoglobin ( Hgb) < 10 g/dL.   
For subjects with ongoing JAK inhibitor therapy at S creening, JAK inhibitor therapy must be tapered 
over a period of at least 1 week, followed by a ≥ 2-week  non-treatment interval beginning  ≥ 7 days 
prior to Day BL1 (the first of 7 consecutive days of baseline MFSAF assessments) . Subjects receiving 
a low dose of JAK inhibitor, eg, [ADDRESS_989814] a reduced taper period , or no taper, with 
the sponsor’s approval. A 7-day B aseline Period (Day s BL1 to BL7 ) is required prior to 
Randomization.  Randomization and the first dose of study treatment (Day  1) will occur within [ADDRESS_989815] be followed . Following completion of Week 24  assessments, 
subjects will be given the option to receive MMB in the Open Label Extended Treatment Period , with 
the exception of subjects who discontinued blinded study treatment prior to the completion  of Week 24 
if unblinding confirmed that they were receiving MMB. Prior to Week 24, subjects will discuss with 
the investigator or designee whether they wish to receive open -label MMB  after the completion of 
Week  24. With the exception of subjects who discontinued early from the MMB arm, subjects may 
begin open-label MMB at the following timepoints and continue therapy up to the end of Week 204 ; 
a)at the end of Week 24 if they complete the Randomized Treatment Period  and Week 24
assessments; b) at the end of Week 24 if they discontinue d treatment with DAN prior to the end of
Week 24 but continue d study assessments and d id not receive prohibited medi cations (unless use of
prohibited anti -MF medication is approved by [CONTACT_456], eg, for short-term use ); c) at any time  prior
to the end of Week 24 (during the Randomized Treatment Period ) if they meet the protocol-defined
criteria for confirmed splenic p rogression. Open -label treatment with MMB may continue up to the end
of Week 204.  Transition to an MMB extension study, if available, may occur once a subject has
completed at least Week 48 (or in the event of early cross -over, week EC24) on -study.

Subjects randomized to receive DAN who are receiving clinical benefit at the end of Week [ADDRESS_989816] of the trial, a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC , 
described in Section  13.4) will review the progress of the clinical trial, safety data, critical efficacy 
endpoints, and make recommendations to the sponsor regarding the continued conduct of the study. 
While the DMC will be asked to advise the sponsor regarding conduct of the study, the sponsor retains final decision -making authority on all aspects of the study.  
After the Screening  and B aseline P eriod , this trial begins with a 24 -week Randomized Treatment 
Period , during which time data are collected for the primary analysis of efficacy. Subjects will be 
randomized on a 2:1 basis ( MMB plus DAN placebo  : DAN plus MMB placebo ), stratified by [CONTACT_725230] (≥  22 versus < 22), baseline palpable spleen length below the left costal margin (LCM, 
≥ 12 cm versus  < 12 cm), baseline RBC units transfused in the  8-week period  prior to Randomization  
(0, 1-4, and 5+ ), and investigational site.  
Blinded treatment  (MMB plus pla cebo or DAN plus placebo) may be interrupted and/or reduced due to 
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, non-hematologic  or other toxicities according to protocol -specified 
criteria. Continuation of treatment at a reduced dose is preferred over treatment discontinuation, however, study treatment will be discontinued if disease progression or toxicity is observed that, in the 
judgement of the investigator, compromises the ability to continue therapy and/or trial-specific procedures required for the safe continuatio n of therapy. Subjects with confirmed splenic progression 
as defined per protocol or leukemic transformation, will discontinue study treatment. Subjects  
randomized to DAN may cross-over to MMB at any time prior to the end of Week 24 (during the 
Randomized Treatment Period ) if they meet the protocol -defined criteria for confirmed splenic 
progression. 
If a subject discontinues treatment  every attempt should be made to continue all trial assessments 
according to the Schedule of Events  (including transfusion recording, symptom assessments , and 
patient reported outcomes [PROs]), to the end of Week 24, and to perform follow -up procedures  
including Safety  Follow -up Visit and S urvival Follow -up assessments.  
Only if  it is not possible or acceptable to the subject or investigator for a subject to continue trial 
assessments after discontinuing treatment should the subject be withdrawn from the trial.  
Methodology:  
Screening and Baseline Assessments:  
Screening activities will commence after informed consent is obtained. As defined in the Schedule of 
Events  (Table  7) and illustrated in Figure  2, Screening  assessments will include a serum pregnancy test 
for women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), laboratory tests (chemistry, CBC with differential, and 
urinalysis), virology screen , physical examination including disease -related clinical signs, vital signs, 
12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS, orDIPSS-plus) disease assessment, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (EGOG) performance
status. Recording of AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) begin at the time of signing the informed
consent form (ICF). Medical and medication history will be recorded, including prior   therapy  for MF ,
last spleen volume measurement, and best spleen response (response, stable disease, or splenicprogression per IWG criteria) during prior therapy. Recording of concomitant medications will begin,
including the use of a subject-completed narcotic pain med ication log . Recording of RBC transfusions
will begin, including pre -transfusion Hgb concentration, and documentation of whether the transfusion

SRA‑ MMB‑301  
10 of 134 momelotinib / danazol  Version 2.0 (18-D EC-2020) 
 
was given due to factors such as clinically overt bleeding, or accident/injury. Transfusion history and 
pre-transfusion Hgb concentrations for the period of [ADDRESS_989817] will be performed (for WOCBP), along with laboratory tests 
(chemistry, CBC with differential, urinalysis, and blood samples for  exploratory assessments including 
mutational analysi s as described in Section  11), physical examination including disease -related clinical 
signs, vital signs, ECOG performance status, and continu ed recording of AE s and SAE s, RBC 
transfusions, and concomitant medications. Baseline spleen length measurement  for stratification will 
be made by [CONTACT_23302] (or ultrasound) as part of the physical examination .  
In order to provide a consistent baseline ass essment of spleen volume, the baseline magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) scan,  or computed tomography (CT)  scan if a subject is unable to have an MRI, m ust 
be performed within the following time periods: for subjects receiving any active MF therapy known to  
reduce spleen size at Screening (including JAK inhibitors) , the scan should be performed within the 
period Day BL1 to Randomization  (between days BL4 and Randomization  is preferable, if feasible ). 
For subjects not receiving any active MF therapy known to reduce spleen size at the start of the 
Screening period, the scan should be performed within 2 weeks prior to  Randomization. However, the 
results of the scan are not required prior to beginning study  treatment.  
The MFSAF baseline assessment will be completed electronically using an ePRO device at home ; 
daily assessments will be completed for 7 consecutive days  (Days BL1 to BL7), prior to 
Randomization. If more than [ADDRESS_989818] non -compliance (eg, technical problems with the 
ePRO device) , the sponsor should be  contact[CONTACT_451614] .  
Baseline assessments will also be completed electronically using an ePRO device during site visit for 
European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) , Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) – Physical 
Function , Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS), and EuroQoL Five Dimension (EQ -5D) . 
First Day of Study Treatment (Day 1):  
The first dose of study treatment (Day 1) will occur after Randomization, within [ADDRESS_989819] 4  hours after 
study treatment  administration. Patients requiring anti- hypertensive therapy should be closely 
monitored and anti -hypertensives may be administered, if deemed clinically necessary . Study 
procedures on Da y 1 include dispensing of study treatment, physical exam, vital signs, ECG, ECOG 
performance status, and the beginning of daily MFSAF recording.  
Efficacy Assessments:  
In order to assess transfusion status, RBC transfusion history including pre -transfusion  Hgb 
concentration will be gathered from subject records for the 12 weeks prior to Randomization , and at 

SRA‑ MMB‑301  
11 of 134 momelotinib / danazol  Version 2.0 (18-D EC-2020) 
 
each visit until discontinuation. In the Randomized Treatment Period , transfusion and CBC recording 
will occur at least once every [ADDRESS_989820]  has discontinued therapy.  In the Open -label 
Extended Treatment Period , transfusion and CBC recording will continue at each study visit until the 
end of Week 96, or discontinuation.  
PRO questionnaires will be completed electronically at the intervals shown in the Schedule of Events  
(Table  7). The MFSAF will be completed daily using an ePRO device throughout the Randomized 
Treatment Period , and for the 7 consecutive days of week 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, and 48 in  the Open -label 
Extended Treatment Period  as illustrated in Figure  3. A window of ± 7 days is allowed for this 7 day 
period, however , the planned 4 -week interval between MFSAF assessment periods should be 
maintained wherever possible. Subjects who discontinue study treatment prior to Week 24 will 
continue daily MFSAF assessments until the end of Week  24. 
Clinical, laboratory, and disease assessments (including ECOG performance status and MF symptom 
assessment), and continued recording o f RBC transfusions will be completed at regular visits as 
defined in the Schedule of Events  (Table  7). 
Spleen volume will be assessed at the end of Week  24 and 48, and as required to confirm splenic 
progression.  
Leukemia-free survival and OS will be assessed during Survival Follow -up. 
Safety Assessments:  Recording of AEs and SAEs will begin at the time of signing the ICF and 
continue until  [ADDRESS_989821] dose of study treatment. Concomitant medications, laboratory tests 
(chemistry, CBC with differential, and urinalysis), urine pregnancy tests, 12 -lead ECGs, physical 
examinations (including spleen length measurements by [CONTACT_725231] ), and vital signs will 
be completed at visits defined in the Schedule of Events  (Table  7). 
Exploratory Assessments:  Blood samples will be collected for assessments including mutational 
analysis via next generation sequencing (NGS)  as described in Section  11 at the timepoints shown in 
the Schedule of Events  (Table  7). 
Health Resource U tilization: RBC t ransfusion history and history of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042] (in-patient and out-
patient), general practitioner (GP) / family doctor visits, and urgent care visits will be gathered for the 
period of [ADDRESS_989822] records and also recorded throughout the 
Random ized Treatment Period  and thereafter to the end of Week 96 in the Open -label Extended 
Treatment Period . 
Pharmacokinetic A ssessments:  Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected at the timepoints 
shown in the Schedule of Events  (Table  7). 
Sample Size Justification: 
The study is powered to detect with a 2 -sided α of 0.05 and randomization ratio 2:1 in favor of MMB a 
clinically relevant, statistically significant improvement in TSS response rate of 23% compared to 2% 
with DAN, in TI status of 45% compared to 21%, and i n SRR of 15% compared to 1% in the proposed 
population. The sample size of 180 has a power of 98.8% to detect a difference of 21% in TSS and a 
power of 90% to detect a difference of 15% (17% versus 2%).  To reach a power of 90% to detect a 
difference of 24%  in TI status  and a  difference of 14% in SRR, the number of subjects required is also 
equal to 180.  
Number of S ubjects Planned: Approximately 180 subjects.

Criteria for Evaluation:  
Primary Endpoint: 

SRA‑ MMB‑301  
16 of 134 momelotinib / danazol  Version 2.0 (18-D EC-2020) 
 
The MFSAF TSS response rate at Week 24. TSS response rate is defined as the proportion of subjects 
who achieve a ≥  50% reduction in TSS over the 28 days immediately prior to the end of Week  24 
compared to baseline. 
Secondary Endpoints (abbreviated , refer to Section  2.3 for full text ): 
•Proportion of subjects with TI status at the end of Week 24; defined as not requiring RBC
transfusion (except in the case of clinically overt bleeding) for ≥ 12 weeks , with all Hgb levels
during the ≥ 12 -week interval of ≥ 8 g/dL (again, except in the case of clinically overt
bleeding)
•SRR; defined as the proportion of subjects who have splenic response (reduction in spleenvolume of ≥ 35% from baseline) at the end of Week 24
•Mean change from baseline to the end of Week 24 in MFSAF TSS will be analyzed using a
mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM), using all available TSS data
•Other secondary endpoints include : measures of anemia benefit and duration of response ,
mean change from baseline MFSAF TSS, s afety assessments, s urvival analyses, c hange from
baseline in PROs, and plasma concentration of MMB .
Exploratory Endpoints (abbreviated , refer to Section  2.4 for full text ): 
Exploratory endpoints include measures of ra te and duration of MFSAF TSS response,  time to splenic 
progressio n, correlated of response and exploratory analysis (including mutational analysis) and health 
resource utilization.  
Statistical Methods  (abbreviated, refer to Section 12 for full text): 
Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Approximately 180 subjects will be enrolled. Minimization (a  dynamic randomization technique) will 
be used to assign eligible subjects in a 2:1 ratio to receive MMB plus DAN placebo  : DAN pl us MMB 
placebo .  
Analysis Sets 
The intent-to -treat ( ITT) analysis set  will be used for all analyses of efficacy and baseline 
characteristics. The per-protocol ( PP) analysis set  will be used as a sensitivity analysis for efficacy 
endpoints. The safety analysis set  will be used for safety analyses.  
Analysis of Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Descriptive statistics with respect to baseline subject characteristics will be displayed for the ITT and 
the safety  analysis set , both by [CONTACT_6654]. A summary of key demographic data and 
also a listing presenting demographic and baseline data per subject will be presented.  
General Analytical Considerations for Efficacy Analyses  
Details of the planned analyses will be descri bed in a statistical analysis plan (SAP). Any deviations 
from the SAP will be justified in the Clinical S tudy R eport  (CSR). 
Descriptive statistics will be provided for selected demographic and safety by [CONTACT_725235]. Descriptive statistics on continuous data will include means, medians, standard deviations, and ranges, while categorical data will be summarized using frequency counts and percentages. Graphical summaries of the data may also be presented.  
One-sided tests will be used at a significance level equal to 0.025. Two -sided confidence intervals (CI) 
will be computed for a coverage of 0.95.  
Binary outcomes will be described by [CONTACT_725236] a Cochran -
Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by [CONTACT_180660] e MFSAF TSS  (≥ 22 versus  < 22), baseline palpable 

SRA‑ MMB‑301  
17 of 134 momelotinib / danazol  Version 2.0 (18-D EC-2020) 
 
spleen length below the LCM  (≥ 12 cm versus  < 12 cm ), and baseline RBC units transfused (0, 1-4, 
and 5+) .  
Time to event outcomes (“survival times”) will be described by [CONTACT_725237] -Meier 
method. Subjects who have not had the event of interest at the time of the analysis will be censored at 
the time of the last follow up. Summary statistics will be provided by [CONTACT_725238], median and 95% CI and survival probabilities at specific time points (such as 1 year, 2 years, etc.). Survival curves will be plotted by [CONTACT_725239] a log -rank test 
stratified by [CONTACT_725240], baseline spleen length , and baseline RBC units transfused. A 
stratified Cox regression model will be used to estimate the hazard ratio and its 95% CI, as well as to adjust the comparison for baseline covariates.  
Analysis of Primary and Key Secondary Endpoints  
Only in the case that the primary endpoint  of MFSAF TSS response meets statistical significance  in the 
primary superiority analysis, the key secondary endpoints  will be  tested sequentially. The order  of 
secondary endpoint testing will be first non-inferiority in the p roportion of subjects with TI status at the 
end of Week 24, and if significance is reached for this endpoint  then the p -value associated with the 
test of superiority  will also be calculated. If non -inferiority in TI status is reached , superiority of  SRR 
will be tested . If superiority of SRR is reached, next the MMRM analysis of change from baseline in 
MFSAF TSS will be conducted. If superiority is achieved for change from baseline in MFSAF TSS, the proportion of subjects with no transfu sions during first 24 weeks  will be tested for superiority. Only 
in the case the primary and key secondary endpoints as described  above meet statistical significance at 
the primary analysis, additional secondary endpoints will be tested sequentially  as described  in the 
SAP. 
Analysis of Patient Reported Outcomes (P rimary Endpoint):  
TSS response at Week 24 is the primary endpoint. The  MFSAF TSS response rate at Week 24 is 
defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve a ≥ 50% reduction compared with the TSS at 
baseline. The primary analysis of TSS response will be performed using a CMH test, stratified by [CONTACT_475294], baseline spleen length , and baseline RBC units transfused, on the ITT analysis set . In accordance with  
the prohibition of non-study active anti-MF therapy, subjects receiving restricted treatments considered 
to be active anti-MF therapy as defined in Section  5.3.[ADDRESS_989828]-randomization TSS response at Week 24 will be considered 
as a non -responder. For calculation of mean TSS (eg, for b aseline TSS), if more than 3 daily TSS 
results are missing from the 7 -day assessment period, the score will be considered missing.  Sensitivity 
analyses will be described in the SAP and will include analyses on the PP analysis set . 
Baseline TSS is defined as the average of the daily TSS for the period of 7 consecutive days ( Days 
BL1 to BL7) , prior to Randomization . If more than 3 daily TSS results are missing , the baseline score 
will be considered missing. 
TSS at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 are defined as the average of the daily TSS from a consecutive 
28-day period prior to the week considered. If fewer  than 20 daily measurements out of 28 are
available, TSS will be set to missing for the timepoint considered.
TSS will be analyzed  for the difference in mean change TSS from baseline (secondary endpoint) using 
a repeated measures model for the outcome change from baseline, using all available summary data (ie, 
summarized for each 4 -week period) of the ITT analysis set.  
The duration of the Week 24 TSS response, assessed to the end of Week 48, will also be analyzed 
(secondary endpoint). Duration of TSS response is defined as the number of days from the start of the 
initial [ADDRESS_989829] has a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline TSS to the first day of the 
28-day period during which the subject’s TSS equals or exceeds their baseline value.

18 of 134 momelotinib / danazol  Version 2.0 (18-D EC-2020) 
 
Analysis of TI status at Week 24 (Key Secondary Endpoint):  
The proportion of subjects who have  TI status in the terminal [ADDRESS_989830], stratified by [CONTACT_725240], baseline spleen length, an d baseline 
RBC units transfused.   
For the analysis of the key -secondary endpoint TI status, non-inferiority of MMB will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_725241] 80% of that in the DAN arm. If non -inferiority is 
concluded and in additi on the entire 95% CI for the comparison also excludes zero, then the p -value 
associated with the test of superiority will also be calculated. The 80% of DAN response threshold 
represents a margin of approximately 4 percentage points under the expected DAN response rate of 21%. The expected response rate for DAN is based on available clinical literature for DAN treatment in MF with consideration of the patient population to be enrolled in this study.  
In accordance with the prohibition of non -study active anti-MF therapy, subjects receiving other active 
MF therapy , as defined in Section  5.3.3, during the Randomized Treatment Period will be set to non -TI 
for T I status at Week 24. Subjec ts without TI -status at Week 24 will be set to non -TI. 
Analysis of Splenic Response Rate at W eek 24 ( Key Secondary Endpoint):  
Splenic response rate (SRR) is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve a splenic response ( ie, 
reduction in spleen volume of ≥ 35% from baseline) at the end of Week  24. Analysis of splenic 
response will be performed on the ITT analysis set  using a CMH test, stratified by [CONTACT_725242], baseline spleen length , and baseline RBC units transfused. Subjects with missing splenic 
response at Week 24 will be considered as non -responders  for SRR. In accordance with the prohibition 
of non-study active anti -MF therapy, subjects receiving other active MF therapy , as defined in 
Section  5.3.3, during the Randomized Treatment Period will be set to non -responder for SRR response 
at Week 24.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. General Information and Momelotinib Development History 
Momelotinib (MMB) was discovered by [CONTACT_725245] (Melbourne, Australia) who 
commenced an initial Phase 1/2 clinical trial (CCL09101/E) in the [LOCATION_002] in [ADDRESS_989841] other studies, [COMPANY_009] conducted two registration- track Phase 3 studies (SIMPLIFY -1 
and SIMPLIFY -2) in subjects with myelofibrosis  (MF) . 
In 2018, Sierra Oncology Inc. acquired the MMB  program from [COMPANY_009] and assumed the role of 
IND sponsor on 27 September 2018.  Sierra intends to continue development of MMB  for the 
treatment of MF.  
MMB ( N-(cyanomethyl) -4-(2-(4-morpholinophenylamino)pyrimidi n-4-yl)benzamide ; CYT387 ; 
GS-0387) is a novel, weakly basic, disubstituted pyrimidine compound with a molecular weight 
of 487 Da. MMB is presented for clinical administration as a dihydrochloride monohydrate salt . 
MMB is a potent and selective ATP competi tive small molecule inhibitor of Janus kinase 1 
(JAK1) , Janus kinase 2 ( JAK2 ) and activin receptor type 1 ( ACVR1 ), at low nanomolar 
concentrations.  Kinase profiling of MMB indicates the compound is broadly selective for these 
three kinases over other kinase enzymes, including the closely related JAK3 and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2). MMB displays potent in vitro inhibitory activity against cells dependent on JAK2, 
including the JAK2V617F mutant.  
As of January  2019, there have been 7 studies of MMB in MF, four of which are ongoing 
(including an extended access protocol) . In addition, a total of [ADDRESS_989842] been observed, and MMB is well tolerated with extended use. These results support the continued 
clinical development of MMB for the treatment of primary MF (PMF)  and secondary MF  (post - 
polycythemia vera [ PV]/ essential thrombocythemia [ ET] MF). A detailed summary of findings 
for the completed studies is available in the I nvestigator’s Brochure ( IB) for MMB. Investigators 
should refer to this document prior to initiating therapy with MMB. 
1.2. Myelofibrosis  
Myelofibrosis is a rare condition with an incidence of 0.1 to 1 per 100,000 individuals per year, and a prevalence of 6 per 100 000 person- years because of its chronic nature and disabling 
course (O’ Sullivan, 2018) . Median age at diagnosis is 67 years (Iurlo, 2017) . Myelofibrosis may 
occur de novo as PMF or may arise from a pre -existing myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), 
primarily PV or ET (Naymagon, 2017) . Once these conditions reach the overtly fibrotic stage, 
they are virtually indistinguishable clinically.  
The hyperproliferation of mutant pluripotent  hematopoietic stem cells results in the release of 
cytokines and growth factors into the bone marrow microenvironment, causing progressive 

SRA‑ MMB‑301  
30 of 134 momelotinib / danazol  Version 2.0 (18-D EC-2020) 
 
fibrotic displacement of erythropoietic tissue, cytopenias and compensatory extramedullary 
hematopoiesis, and associ ated splenomegaly (Iurlo, 2017; Naymagon, 2017; O’Sullivan, 2018) . 
Aberrant cytokine production and inflammation due to the activation of the Janus kinase -signal 
transducers and activators of transcription ( JAK- STAT)  pathway also leads to elevated levels of 
inflammatory cytokines within the bone marrow and systemically, contributing to additional manifestations of MF  such as an anemia of chronic disease, constitutional symptoms, immune 
dysregulation, and other complications. Besides causing disease- related morbidity, MF may 
result in early death from complications including leukemic progression, which can occur in about 20% of patients, complications arising from progressive bone marrow failure, port al or 
pulmonary hypertension, infections, thrombosis, bleeding, and cardiovascular complications (Vainchenker, 2018; Zahr, 2016) . 
The three cardinal disease manifestations of MF  are (1) anemia often  in association with 
thrombocytopenia or other cytopenias; (2) constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, night sweats, fever, cachexia, bone pain, pruritus, and weight loss; and (3) organomegaly  due to 
extramedullary hematopoiesis, principally of the spleen and less often the liver, which can cause 
commonly associated symptoms such as abdominal distension and pain, early satiety, dyspnea, 
and diarrhea.  
The median survival for all  patients with MF is about 6 years but is considerably worse for 
intermediate 2 - and high -risk patients at 4 years and 2.25 years, respectively (Cervantes, 2009; 
Zahr, 2016) . 
1.2.1. Myelofibrosis-Associated Symptoms 
As a chronic disease, MF is ch aracterized by a high disease burden, disease complications, 
reduced  quality of life  (QoL) and shortened survival. Patients suffering with the disease 
experience a broad range of symptoms that negatively impact their social functioning, physical 
activity, independence with daily tasks, and overall productivity. Patients responding to the MPN 
Landmark survey report that MF  reduced their QoL (81%), interfered with daily activities (53%), 
and resulted in limits to their work productivity (65% of employed respo ndents) such as 
reductions in work hours, medical leave, or early retirement (Mesa, 2018) . The most common 
symptoms affecting patients with MF  include constitutional symptoms associated with systemic 
inflammation such as night sweats, fever, and weight loss; abdominal symptoms secondary to splenomegaly such as abdominal discomfort/pain, early satiety, dyspnea, and diarrhea; 
symptoms of anemia such as fatigue; and symptoms secondary to complications of MF . Fatigue 
(weariness, tiredness) has been identified as the most common and most severe symptom 
(Harrison, 2017; Scherber, 2011) . 
1.2.2. Anemia in Myelofibrosis  
Within a year of diagnosis, 45%  of patients with MF are already red blood cell ( RBC)  
transfusion dependent (TD) and eventually, nearly all will develop transfusion dependence 
(Tefferi, 2012). Severe anemia and transfusion dependence are independent predictors of poor 
prognosis and are inversely correlated with QoL (Naymagon, 2017) . Conversely, response to 
anemia- targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_725200] .  

SRA‑ MMB‑301  
31 of 134 momelotinib / danazol  Version 2.0 (18-D EC-2020) 
 
For most TD  patients with MF , RBC transfusion support is the only therapeutic option, however, 
transfusions can be complicated by [CONTACT_725246], fluid overload, alloimmunization, and 
iron toxicity.  After approximately  [ADDRESS_989843] upregulation of hepcidin  by [CONTACT_13204] -6 
(IL-6) (Ganz, 2013). Hepcidin production is  also directly stimulated through the activation of 
ACVR1 receptor kinase. MMB can therefore reduce hepcidin levels by [CONTACT_725247]1 as well as through the inhibition of JAK/STAT -mediated IL-6 production and signaling. 
High circulating hepcidin levels, common in patients with MF , interfere with iron metabolism 
and iron utilization by [CONTACT_725248], increasing iron retention within 
cellular stores, and decreasing iron availability for erythropoie sis (Langdon, 2014) . Elevated 
hepcidin in MF is strongly associated with reduced hemoglobin ( Hgb) levels (<  10 g/dL), a 
requirement for RBC transfusions, and reduced survival (Pardanani, 2013a) . 
1.2.3. Myelofibrosis Treatment Options and Standard of Care  
Myelofibrosis is curable only after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which is particularly challenging for patients with the condition, because of their advanced age, 
competing comorbidities, and lack of viable donor options. This procedure requires a careful 
risk/benefit as sessment as there is a high -risk of transplant -related mortality and only a 30% to 
37% five -year survival rate (Helbig, 2018; Tefferi, 2015) . 
Before the availability of ruxolitinib, therapy for MF was mainly palliative and directed toward 
amelioration of disease sequelae and symptom management. The discovery of the JAK2 driver 
mutatio n in MPNs led to the research and development of several JAK  inhibitors and 
investigations into other gene mutations for the treatment of MF. Small molecule inhibitors of 
JAK2 or JAK1/[ADDRESS_989844] demonstrated therapeutic benefit in subjects with MF  with or without the V617F mutation, 
consistent with a demonstrated ability to inhibit both mutant (V617F) and wild- type JAK2 
signaling (Pardanani, 2008, 2011) . 
Anemia and thrombocytopenia have remained challenges in the management of MF  despi[INVESTIGATOR_725201] (Naymagon, 2017) . Ideally, treatment of MF-associated anemia would 
be accomplished by [CONTACT_725249], however ruxolitinib is contributing to the overall anemia burden in MF  due to its myelosuppressive properties . 
Existing approaches for the management of MF -associated cytopenia include transfusion, 
erythropoiesis -stimulating agents in patients with low serum erythropoietin  (EPO)  levels, 
corticosteroids, androgens  (including danazol  [DAN] ), immunomodulators, and splenectomy. 
None of these options improve survival, given their limited durability, inconsistent efficacy and 

SRA‑ MMB‑301  
32 of 134 momelotinib / danazol  Version 2.0 (18-D EC-2020) 
 
therapeutic complications (Naymagon, 2017) . For these reasons, each is described by [CONTACT_725250] (NCCN) as minimally effective.  
1.3. Momelotinib Preclinical Pharmacology and Toxicology  
1.3.1. Absorption, Distri bution, Metabolism, and Elimination (ADME)  
Consistent with the moderate to high bioavailability seen in nonclinical species, MMB shows 
high permeability in human Caco -[ADDRESS_989845] high permeability across the intestinal mucosa in 
humans and high oral absorption in vivo.  
Data from plasma protein binding studies using rat and human plasma indicate that MMB binds 
extensively to rat plasma proteins (~ 97%), and moderately to human plasma proteins (87% to 
92%). The  mean human blood- to-plasma ratio was determined to be approximately 1.1, 
suggesting similar distribution between the cellular and plasma fractions of blood.  
The distribution of MMB into brain tissue was assessed in mice following intravenous administrati on. The brain- to-plasma ratio for MMB was determined to be 0.075 and 0.215 at 5 
and 60 minutes following MMB administration, respectively, suggesting low permeability of 
MMB across the blood brain barrier.  
Metabolite profiling has identified major putative metabolites from in vitro and in vivo studies : 
an amide hydrolysis product (M19), a morpholino cleavage metabolite (M20), and a morpholino 
lactam metabolite  (M21) . M21 is the major circulating plas ma metabolite  in human subjects.  
The potential for MMB  and its metabolites to cause drug- drug interactions  has been studied 
extensively. In vitro studies demonstrated that MMB and its metabolites (M19 and M21) are 
unlikely to inhibit cytochrome ( CYP ) enzymes and most renal and hepatic transporters at 
clinically relevant plasma concentrations. MMB is an inhibitor of UGT1A1 and may theoretically increase plasma concentrations of UGT substrates, however clinically significant elevations of indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin (an archetypi[INVESTIGATOR_725202]) have not been 
seen in the clinical program suggesting MMB is unlikely to present a significant DDI risk when 
co-administered with other UGT1A1 substrates. In addition, MMB, M19 and M21 are unlikely 
to induce drug- metabolizing enzymes via activation of the pregnane X receptor (i.e. CYP and 
UGT).  
MMB was shown to be a substrate for cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) and other CYP 
enzymes in vitro, but was shown not to be a sensitive CYP3A substrate in a clinical study. MMB 
is also a substrate for P -gp and BCRP and intestinal interactions could occur with potent 
inhibitors of these efflux transporters. MMB is a substrate for hepatic uptake transporters 
OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 but distribution into cells is mainly mediated by [CONTACT_274775]. No 
significant DDI risk has been identified during the evaluation of M19 and M21. Inhibition of 
transporters was generally weak with the exception of BCRP inhibition by [CONTACT_463020] 
(IC
50 = 2.9 µM) and MATE1 inhibition by M21 (IC 50 = 2.4 µM).

1.3.2. Nonclinical Toxicology 
Nonclinical safety pharmacology and toxicology studies have characterized the safety of MMB 
and included repeat dose toxicology , genotoxicity, carcinogenic ity, development al and 
reproductive toxicology, and juvenile toxicology studies . All pi[INVESTIGATOR_725203] ; 21 Code of Federal Regulations 
[CFR] 58 (21 CFR 58). The scope of the nonclinical safety evaluation is consistent with 
guidance issued by [CONTACT_25039] (ICH).  
In an in vitro human ether -a-go-go relate d gene assay, the IC 50 of MMB was greater than 10 μM . 
In an oral cardiovascular study using telemetered dogs, MMB did not generally cause hemodynamic or ECG changes in dogs at single doses of 5 or 30 mg/kg. A marked decrease (up 
to 29%) in arterial blood pressure and increase in heart rate was observed after a single dose of 
100 mg/kg. No central nervous or respi[INVESTIGATOR_725204] 250 mg/kg in rats . 
Reduced  peripheral nerve conduction velocity was  observed in a  repeat -dose rat toxic ity study. 
However, MMB did not inhibit ion channels associated with peripheral nerve functions  (namely 
voltage -gated sodium [hNav1.6, hNAV1.7 and hNav1.8], potassium [ hHCN2 ] channels, or 
Shaker family potassium channels Kv1.1 and Kv1.2) at a concentration of 3 µM , represent ing 
approximately 3- fold the free fraction of MMB in rat plasma.  
The oral toxicity of MMB was evaluated in rats and dogs for treatment periods of up to 
39 weeks. Toxicological findings included effects related to the pharmacological action of the 
compound, as indicated by [CONTACT_725251]. A dose- dependent decrease in body weight gain and body weight loss 
(dogs), correlating with a dose- dependent decrease in food consumption, was observed and 
considered significant at high- dose levels. Off -target toxicity included changes in the testes, eye, 
kidney, gastrointestinal tract, heart, and liver. A decrease in nerve conduction velocity was 
observed in rats after 13 weeks of 50 mg/kg/day MMB administration. Dose -dependent testicular 
degeneration was observed in rats and dogs following repeated dosing. Recovery of testicular 
findings was dependent upon the severity of the effect. Cataracts were observed in male and 
female dogs after [ADDRESS_989846] sensitive species to adverse effects of MMB. The NOAEL in the 39- week dog study, 
20 mg/kg/day, resulted in similar exposure (AUC
0-24) as in the Phase 2 MF clinical trial 
(Study CCL09101)  at the 300 mg dose level . Adverse effects were observed  at the 50 mg/kg/day 
dose level, which represents approximately twice the therapeutic exposure (AUC 0-24) in MF . 
MMB was negative in genetic toxicology studies both in vitro and in vivo.  
MMB was negative for tumorigenicity in HRas2 mice at MMB doses up to 100 mg/kg/day for 26 weeks, but an increased incidence of testicular interstitial (Leydig) cell adenomas was observed in rats at 15 mg/kg/day for [ADDRESS_989847] been associated with 
off-target effects of JAK inhibitors related to modulation (inhibition) of prolactin signaling 
pathways; however, human health risk is considered unlikely as human Leydig cells lack similar 
prolactin dependence for normal function.  
Reproductive and development toxicity studies showed that MMB reduced male fecundity and fertility, reduced testis and seminal vesicle weight, and reduced sperm concentration and 

SRA‑ MMB‑301  
34 of 134 momelotinib / danazol  Version 2.0 (18-D EC-2020) 
 
motili ty. In female rats and rabbits, MMB resulted in an increase in early resorptions, increased 
post-implantation loss and decreased number of live fetuses and increased visceral and skeletal 
variations. In a pre - and post -natal study in rats, F1 generation pups had detectable plasma levels 
of MMB during lactation and decreased survival.  
MMB did not demonstrate phototoxic or sensitization potential but was a severe irritant in the 
bovine corneal opacity and permeability test.  
A more detailed summary of findings from the studies in rats and dogs is available in the IB for MMB. Investigators should refer to this document prior to initiating therapy with MMB. 
1.4. Clinical Pharmacology  
1.4.1. Pharmacokinetic Profile  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetics, Metabolism, and Excretion 
The pharmacokine tics ( PK), metabolism, and excretion of MMB were evaluated in a mass 
balance study in healthy male subject s administered a single oral dose of 200 mg MMB (a 
mixture of both unlabeled MMB and [14C] labeled MMB).  
Data from this study quantified circulating M MB (17%) and identified M21 (64%) as  the major 
circulating metabolite together with other minor metabolites. MMB is primarily eliminated in the feces (~69%) versus  urine (~28%). The major component excreted in feces was M14 (21% of the 
dose), along with unchanged parent MMB (13% of the dose) and other metabolites (M21: 13% of the dose ). The remaining identified 10 metabolites detected in feces each accounted for less 
than 4% of the dose. In urine, metabolite M21 was the main species (12% of the dose), with low 
levels of unchanged parent MMB and minor metabolites observed.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetics in Subjects with Myelofibrosis  
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Tablet Formulation  
The plasma pharmacokinetics of the 200 mg- tablet formulation of MMB were evaluated in two 
Phase 3 studies, GS -US-352-0101 and GS -US-352-1214. 
In study GS -US-352-0101 ( SIMPLIFY -1
, a randomized study in subjects with MF treated with 
MMB versus ruxolitinib ), trough plasma concentrations of MMB and its major active metabolite, 
M21, appeared to be at steady state by [CONTACT_10585] 2, with concentrations comparable at Week 2 and Week  24 of the Randomized Treatment Period. 
Intensive PK sampling over a 24- hour period was performed in a subset of patients at Week 2 of 
the Randomized Treatment Period. Mean PK parameters are presented in Table  2 and are similar 
to values obtained in the second Phase 3 study (data not presented).  
Initial clinical studies in MF patients (CCL09101; YM -II-02) utilized a rudimentary capsule 
formulation of MMB, while MMB was administered in later studies, including the pi[INVESTIGATOR_61493] 3 SIMPLIFY trials, as a tablet formulation.

A single dose, relative bioavailability study in healthy subjects demonstrated bioequivalent AUC 
and C max values between the initial 300 mg capsule formulation and the 200 mg tablet 
presentation utilized in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_725205].

1.5. Rationale for the Trial  
1.5.1. JAK Kinases  and ACVR1  as Targets in Myelofibrosis 
Myelofibrosis, a BCR -ABL1 –negative MPN, is a clonal hematopoietic stem -cell disorder driven 
by [CONTACT_725252] -signal transducers and activators of 
transcription (JAK -STAT) pathway, such as the JAK2V617F mutation in the JAK2  gene 
(45% -70% of cases) , or mutations in calreticulin ( CALR) (25%‑35%)  or MPL (5% -10%) 
(O’Sullivan, 2018). Beyond these driver mutations that are essential for the MPN phenotype, additional somatic mutations detected in MF  may contribute to disease progression and leukemic 
transformation (Alshemmari, 2016) . 
The JAK kinases play a central role in the regulation of hematopoiesis, controlling survival, 
proliferation, and differentiation of hematopoietic cells as well as the function of mature cells. JAK kinases bind cytokine receptors to form a functional signaling complex and scaffold for 
signaling molecules, particularly for the STATs (Helbig, 2018). Aberrant activation of the 
JAK‑STAT pathway is central to the pathogenesis of MPNs by [CONTACT_725253], inflammation and fibrosis, and progression of the malignant phenotype.  
As a class, the JAK  inhibitors display anti -inflammatory activity with symptomatic and clinical 
benefits of varying degrees (Bose, 2017). The refinement of the symptom assessment process has allowed for greater individualization of treatment plans (Geyer, 2017). For a multifaceted 
indication such as MF , additional therapeutic options within the JAK  inhibitor pharmacological 
class would provide patients with choices that could best address their individual needs. 
MMB is a potent and selective small -molecule inhibitor of both JAK1 and JAK2. The compound 
has good selectivity over other tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases. It displays potent in vitro 
inhibitory activity against the JAK2V617F mutant, which is associated with the etiology of PV and the other MPNs. The compound has good potency against intracellular JAK1 and JAK2 signaling events, including those in cells derived from subjects with PV and ET. MMB has been 

SRA‑ MMB‑301  
36 of 134 momelotinib / danazol  Version 2.0 (18-D EC-2020) 
 
shown to potently inhibit JAK2 signaling and the formation of V617F mutant myeloid colonies 
in a dose- responsive manner suggesting potential activity for the compound in these disease 
settings. The compound has demonstrated in vivo activity in JAK2- dependent cellular and 
animal models.  
MMB also selectively inhibits ACVR1 , a protein that facilitates hepatocyte  hepcidin production. 
Increased hepcidin in chronic disease causes decreased iron uptake from the gut, increased iron 
sequestration in macrophages, and reduced iron availability for erythropoiesis.  A significant 
proportion of patients with MF develop anemia and are or become dependent on frequent RBC transfusions (Tefferi, 2012) . In contrast to ruxolitinib, results of a Phase 2 study (CCL09101E) 
show that MMB provides an anemia benefit to subjects with MF in the form of TD  subjects who 
become transfusion independent (TI) and an increase in Hgb  in TI  subjects (Pardanani, 2013b) . 
Nonclinical studies suggest that MMB’s clinical anemia benefit results from inhibition of 
ACVR1/ALK2 -mediated expression of hepcidin in the liver, which results in increased release of 
iron from sequestered cellular stores and enhanced erythropoiesis.  
1.5.2. Rationale for Trial  Population  
This study is intended to establish the clinical benefit of MMB in subjects previously treated with an approved JAK inhibitor and who are both demonstrably symptomatic and anemic at 
Screening , defined as MFSAF TSS of ≥ 10 and Hgb of < 10 g/dL, respectively. This population, 
by [CONTACT_725254], anemic and having received at least 90 days of treatment with an 
approved JAK inhibitor (or a minimum of 28 days if JAK inhibitor therapy is complicated by [CONTACT_725229] ≥ 4 units in 8 weeks, or Grade 3/4 adverse eve nts of 
thrombocytopenia, anemia, or hematoma), represents a population with an unmet medical need 
with no alternative available MF  therapy that addresse s the [ADDRESS_989848] a MFSAF TSS of ≥  10 at Screening to 
ensure that the study results are considered clinically meaningful assuming the primary endpoint 
is met; specifically, to ensure that each individual responder achieves a meaningful magnitude  of 
symptom improvement whilst maintaining feasibility of study execution.  All s ubjects (TD and 
non-TD) are required to have at least moderate anemia (Hgb <  10 g/dL). Anemia and transfusion 
dependency are the most important negative prognostic factors in intermediate and high- risk MF 
with limited therapeutic options. Importantly, the enrollment of anemic patients aligns this 
significant unmet need in MF with MMB’s differentiated anemia benefit. By [CONTACT_725255], all subject s will meet the criteria for intermediate -1, 
intermediate -2, or high -risk MF as defined by [CONTACT_725256] ( DIPSS) or DIPSS- plus criteria. Relevant data will be collected at entry to 
ensure that the trial population can be characterized by [CONTACT_119580].  
Prior JAK inhibitor therapy, required for enrollment in this trial, is expected to be ruxolitinib for 
nearly all subjects. Other JAK inhibitors, particularly ruxolitinib and fedratinib, do not address 
and often worsen cytopenias (including anemia) by [CONTACT_725257]. Clinical outcome after JAK inhibitor “failure” is poor (Pardanani, 2018), with overall 
survival (OS) estimated to be approximately 14 months (Newberry, 2017). Since the start of J AK 
inhibitor clinical trials over 10 years ago, ruxolitinib remains the only JAK  inhibitor approved 

SRA‑ MMB‑301  
37 of 134 momelotinib / danazol  Version 2.0 (18-D EC-2020) 
 
for MF  though a variety of investigational JAK  inhibitors , including MMB, are in late -stage 
development . The effective use of ruxolitinib is complicated by [CONTACT_9934]- induced cytopenias leading 
to label- defined dose reductions despi[INVESTIGATOR_725206]. Given the prognostic importance of anemia 
and the absence of a highly effective  treatment for the population of patients with moderate to 
severe anemia and MF, these patients have a significant, definable unmet medical need.  
DAN (the comparator treatment in this study) has been shown to provide benefit for MF -
associated anemia as described in Section  1.5.3. However, as outlined in Section  1.2.3, there are 
no approved or NCCN -recommended treatment options available for patients who are not 
candidates for ruxolitinib. For most TD patients with MF, RBC transfusion support is the only therapeutic option. Transfusions are associated with acute and chronic health risks, decreased 
QoL, and place a significant burden on both the patient and the health care system.  
Subjects with ongoing JAK inhibitor therapy at Screening are required to have a  ≥ 2-week non-
treatment interval with the last dose of prior JAK inhibitor therapy at least 7 days prior to Day 
BL1 ( the first of 7 consecutive days of baseline MFSAF assessments) . The incorporation of this 
non-treatment interval is anticipated to provide an opportunity to observe splenic responses after 
the initiation of MMB  therapy . In SIMPLIFY -2, MMB was not statistically superior  to 
ruxolitinib  in reducing splenomegaly, however, a non- treatment interval was not introduced into 
the study design. Rapid spleen growth in response to discontinuation of JAK inhibitor therapy has been documented previously (Mascarenhas, 2017; Tefferi, 2011). This rapid rebound may reset the baseline spleen size and will thus increase the opportunity for a subsequent splenic 
response. Recent publications hi ghlight the impact a forced non -treatment interval or 
discontinuation of prior therapy may have had on promoting splenomegaly rebound, and thus 
subsequent splenic response in the PERSIST -2 and JAKARTA -2 trials (Mascarenhas, 2018, 
2017) . Inclusion of a non- treatment interval in this trial will allow for a more robust examination 
of splenic response.  
In summary, this population of subjects previously treated with an approved JAK inhibitor and 
who are both symptomatic and anemic at study entry, represent a  clear and urgent  unmet medical 
need with no alternative available MF  therapy. Evidence suggests that MMB can provide a 
differentiated and compelling benefit in symptoms, spleen response, and anemia. Specifically, via inhibition of JAK1 and JAK2, MMB is uniquely positioned as the only JAK  inhibitor proven 
to provide comparable splenic benefit when compared directly to ruxolitinib in the 
JAK-inhibitor- naïve setting, while Phase [ADDRESS_989849], clinically meaningful and consistent anemia benefits, likely 
via inhibition of ACVR1 and JAK1, in the two Phase 3 studies of MMB (SIMPLIFY -1, 
SIMPLIFY -2) and in the Phase 2 translational biology study (GS -US-352-1672) in TD  patients.  
1.5.3. Rationale for Comparator Arm 
Danazol (DAN) is a semi -synthetic attenuate d androgen selected as an appropriate treatment 
comparator given its use to ameliorate anemia in patients with advanced MF and inadequate 
response to or intolerance  of ruxolitinib; feasibility for use  in a blinded study design; and 
recommendation by [CONTACT_725258] -associated anemia 

SRA‑ MMB‑301  
38 of 134 momelotinib / danazol  Version 2.0 (18-D EC-2020) 
 
(NCCN MPN Panel, 2018; Vannucchi, 2015) . In comparison to other anabolic steroids used in 
the treatment of anemia (nandrolone, fluoxymesterone, methandrostenolone, and oxymetholone), 
DAN produces similar benefit with less toxicity (Cervantes, 2014) . 
In a study of 30 patients with MF  with myeloid metaplasia, treatment with DAN (600 mg per 
day, tapering to the minimum effective dose in responders after 6 months) resulted in complete 
or partial  anemia response in 11/30 (37%) patients. Complete and partial responses were defined 
as TI  with  Hgb >  11 g/dL ; and increase in H gb ≥ 1.5 g/dL plus TI with Hgb > 10 g/dL for 
≥ [ADDRESS_989850] frequent toxicit ies associated with DAN were 
moderate  increas es in liver enzymes in 8 (27%) patients which improved following a reduction 
of DAN to 400 mg per day. Headaches and mild increase s in the muscle mass were observed  
occasionally . Treatment was withdrawn for 2 (7%) patients who experienced events of 
cholest atic hepatitis and prostate adenocarcinoma respectively (Cervantes, 2005) . 
In a subsequent study of 50 patients (including the 30 patients  previously described)  anemia 
response was assessed per International Working Group- Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research 
and Treatment ( IWG -MRT ) criteria ie, a ≥ 2 g/dL increase in Hgb level for patients TI at 
baseline or becoming TI for patients TD at baseline (Tefferi, 2013). Anemia response was achieved in 15/50 (30%) patients overall;  of these 15 patients who achieved response 5/27 (19% ) 
were TD at baseline and 10/23 (43% ) were not TD at baseline. The most frequent toxicities 
observed were again moderate increases in liver enzymes in the first months of treatment,  which 
improved follow ing a reduction of DAN to 400 mg per day. Two patients had severe cholestatic  
hepatitis leading to discontinuation of DAN, 1 patient developed liver peliosis , and prostate  
cancer was diagnosed in 1 patient (Cervantes, 2015) . 
Subjects randomized to the comparator arm will receive MMB placebo plus DAN at the 
recommended 600 mg total daily starting dose; administered morning and evening in divided 
doses. Standard supportive care measures may be provided to subjects in both arms during the trial, in accordance with protocol -specified restrictions provided in Section  5.3.3. 
1.5.4. Rationale for Symptom Measurement Primary Endpoint 
Improvement in symptoms assessed by [CONTACT_725259] v4.0 
(MFSAF) has been selected as the primary endpoint. The MFSAF is  a validated patient reported 
outcome (PRO) instrument which measures the core symptoms of MF . This instrument assesses 
the therapeutic benefit of MMB on symptom burden, a cardinal feature of MF. Thus, this trial is 
designed to establ ish the differentiated clinical benefit of MMB in improving symptom burden. 
A full understanding of the patient experience for those with MF, including quantifying symptom 
burden is now an integral component of disease diagnosis, treatment optimization, and patient 
monitoring. Some signs of MF  can be directly observed or measured, for example anemia and/or 
splenomegaly, however, most symptoms are less quantifiable and/or are heterogeneous between 
each subject and must be assessed by [CONTACT_725260] (Mesa, 2011). In 2017, the NCCN 
created guidelines for PRO use that outlined that all  patients with  PMF regardless of risk status 
or level of symptom burden should undergo assessment with the myeloproliferative neoplasm -
symptom assessment form (MPN -SAF) total symptom score (TSS) for initial evaluation and 
every 3 to 6 months to monitor for symptom progression or response to therapy (Geyer, 2017; 
NCCN MPN Panel, 2018) . 

SRA‑ MMB‑301  
39 of 134 momelotinib / danazol  Version 2.0 (18-D EC-2020) 
 
The harmonized MF  symptom questionnaire, MFSAF  v4.0, was finalized in 2017 by a multi-
stakeholder working group via the Criti cal Path Patient -Reported Outcome Consortium 
(Gwaltney, 2017; Wang, 2017) . The MFSAF v4.0 focuses on the core symptoms of MF and 
includes seven domains, each assessed on an 11- point numeric rating scale (NRS) anchored from 
0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable). The MFSAF v 4.0 is available in both a 24 hour and 7 day 
recall period. For the purposes of this study, the 24 hour recall version will be administered via 
an electronic ( ePRO)  device. Alternative methods including paper  forms may be used to record 
PRO responses in exceptional circumstances, such as interruption of the ePRO system due to 
technical issues, with the approval of the s ponsor . 
In order to provide a consistent baseline symptom assessment, subjects who are receiving JAK inhibitor therapy at Screening  are required to discontinue treatment for a period of [ADDRESS_989851] day of baseline MFSAF assessments as described in  Section  5.3.1. Thereafter, the 
MFSAF will be completed daily using an electronic ePRO device  throughout the 24 -week 
Randomized Treatment Period . An ePRO de vice is physical hardware used by [CONTACT_725261].   
A landmark responder analysis at Week 24 is proposed as the primary method of evaluation of 
MFSAF TSS response based on prior use in the regulatory review of ruxolitinib including in the 
placebo-controlled ruxolitinib MF  study, COMFORT -1, where TSS response was a key 
secondary endpoint  (Verstovsek, 2012) . The standard threshold for response of a 50% 
improvement in TSS at Week 24 (using the mean value across daily scores from Weeks 20 to 24 compared to the mean value across daily scores during the week prior to the start of treatment) 
will also be applied, consistent with COMFORT -1, SIMPLIFY -1 and SIMPLIFY -2.  
To assess the added value of the durability in symptom response over time, TSS will  be collected 
until Week 48. 
By [CONTACT_37228] a MFSAF TSS of ≥  [ADDRESS_989852] 
achieved a ≥ 5-point reduction in TSS, which is above the 3- point within -subject change 
associated with the minimum clinically meanin gful benefit validated previously in SIMPLIFY -2. 
Of note, this 3- point meaningful change threshold is consistent with the minimum clinically 
meaningful benefit validated for ruxolitinib in the previous COMFORT -1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397].  
1.5.5. Secondary Endpoints Evaluating RBC Transfusion Requirements  
The proportion of subjects with TI status at the end of Week 24 has been selected as a key 
secondary endpoint . Other secondary endpoints include the proportion of subjects not requiring 
transfusion and the proportion requiri ng 4 or fewer transfusions during the Randomized 
Treatment Period , and the rate of conversion to TI status for ≥  12 weeks at the Week 24 
landmark. Further measures of anemia benefit will include duration of transfusion independence 
response, improvements in Hgb in the non- TD subjects, cumulative transfusion risk modelling; 
and the assessment of within subject changes in patient reported outcome measures of fatigue 
and physical function. Transfusion requirements represent a major unmet need in MF and 
represent a mechanistically -defined and differentiated benefit of MMB.  
Clinical evidence from the Phase 3 (SIMPLIFY -1, SIMPLIFY -2) and the Phase 2 translational 
biology study (GS -US-352-1672) show substantial preliminary evidence of anemia benefit in 
patients wi th MF , including maintenance or improvement of Hgb levels, maintenance or 

SRA‑ MMB‑301  
40 of 134 momelotinib / danazol  Version 2.0 (18-D EC-2020) 
 
improvement in the rate of transfusion independency, and reduction in transfusion frequency and 
the rate of transfusion dependency (Asshoff, 2017). In contrast, anemia typi[INVESTIGATOR_725207].  
1.5.6. Rationale f or Splenic Response Rate as a Key Secondary Endpoint  
Splenic response rate (SRR), defined as the proportion of subjects who have splenic response at 
the end of Week 24, has been selected as a key secondary endpoint. A reduction in spleen 
volume of ≥ 35% from baseline will be considered a splenic response, per IWG -MRT criteria.  
Splenomega ly due to extramedullary hematopoiesis is a cardinal features of MF and can cause 
symptoms such as abdominal distension and pain and early satiety.  In order to evaluate splenic 
response with MMB versus  DAN, a baseline spleen volume measurement will be compared with 
the post -treatment volume at the end of Week 24. In addition, spleen examinations by [CONTACT_725262]. Splenic progression will be confirmed by [CONTACT_725263].  
1.6. Benefit/Risk Assessment  
1.6.1. Anticipated Benefits of MMB Treatment  
Given the lack of effective, durable and safe therapeutic options, the complexities and complications of supportive care, and the significant impact on survival and QoL , symptomatic , 
anemic patients with MF  are a population with a significant unmet medical need. JAK  inhibitor 
therapy has been shown to improve the symptom burden of patients with MF as measured by a 
PRO instrument. E ffective management of MF symptom  burden and MF -associated 
splenomegaly are key objectives of this study.  
In addition to symptomatic benefit and reduction of splenomegaly, as demonstrated in SIMPLIFY -[ADDRESS_989853] anemia and transfusion dependency benefit  in 
patie nts with MF  via a differentiated, mechanistically based pro -erythropoietic pharmacology.  
This trial’s  eligibility requirements for demonstrable MF  symptoms in combination with  anemia  
can be viewed as a proxy for failure of prior JAK inhibitor therapy given that the persistence of 
these two cardinal signs of MF  indicate a lack of sustained treatment benefit. JAK inhibitors, 
other than MMB , are myelosuppressive and have no associated ne t anemia benefit.  The current 
NCCN guidance (NCCN MPN Panel, 2018)  recommends that patients with MF -associated 
anemia should be enrolled into a clinical trial, confirming the unmet medical need for patients with this condition.  
1.6.2. Anticipated Risks of MMB Treatment  
Based on preliminary safety data from the SIMPLIFY studies in subjects with MF , the most 
common treatment- emergent adverse events ( AEs) during random ized treatment with MMB 
were: diarrhea, nausea, asthenia, thrombocytopenia, and headache.  

SRA‑ MMB‑301  
41 of 134 momelotinib / danazol  Version 2.0 (18-D EC-2020) 
 
A possible “first dose effect” has been observed in a subset of subjects upon administration of 
the initial dose of MMB. This first dose effect consisted of a constellation of signs and 
symptoms, one or more of which may occur in an individual subject. The first -dose signs and 
symptoms were mostly mild, did not require intervention, and the majority resolved in [ADDRESS_989854] been identified: reduced fertility in males and females and post -natal toxicity via 
exposure through breast milk. Further information is provided in the IB for MMB. Due to the 
possibility of infertility, investigators are to advise study participants on the conservation of gametes prior to receiving study treatment.  
1.6.3. Anticipated Risks of Comparator Treatment (DAN)  
DAN is  the comparator treatment  for the Randomized Treatment Peri od (24  weeks) of this study. 
DAN is used to  ameliorate anemia in patients with advanced MF  and inadequate response to or 
intolerance of JAK inhibitor therapy, and is recommended by [CONTACT_725264] -associated anemia as described in Section  1.5.3 (NCCN MPN Panel, 
2018; Vannucchi, 2015) . In comparison to other anabolic steroids used in the treatment of  MF, 
DAN produces similar benefit with less toxi city (Cervantes, 2014) .  
Events reported in association with the use of DAN  in its approved indications , 
contraindications, and advised precautions are described below and should be interpreted by [CONTACT_725265]  (Lannett 
Company Inc, 2018; Mylan [LOCATION_006] Ltd, 2018)  
Criteria for dose adjustment during the study are provided in Section  3.4. In the setting of this 
study, the investigator should the assess the need for dose modification or discontinuation of 
study treat ment for the individual case, the overall benefit risk to the patient, the severity of AE, 
response to treatment and level of benefit  in discussion with the sponsor.  
Events reported in association with DAN:  
•DAN has been associated with two serious adverse  reactions: hepatocellular injury
(ie., hepatocellular injury, hepatocellular jaundice, and hepatic failure) and an
increased risk of rhabdomyolysis in patients taking DAN in combination with statins
•Conditions such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], migraine, cardiac or renal dysfunction, polycythemia,
and hypertension require careful observation s ince DAN may cause fluid retention
•Androgen like effects including weight gain, acne and seborrhea. Mild hirsutism,
edema, hair loss, voice change (hoarseness, sore throat or instability or deepening ofpi[INVESTIGATOR_23025]). In the event of virili zation, DAN should be withdrawn due to the risk of
irreversible androgenic effects with continued use
•Other possible endocrine effects including spotting, alteration of the timing of thecycle and amenorrhe a

•Flushing, sweating, vaginal dryness and irritation and reduction in breast size, may
reflect lowering of estrogen
•Nervousness and emotional lability
•Modest reduction in spermatogenesis, abnormalities in semen volume, viscosity,sperm count, and motility may occur in patients receiving long- term therapy.
•Hepatic dysfunction evidenced by [CONTACT_725266]/or
jaundice. Serious hepatic toxicity including cholestatic jaundice, peliosis hepatis, and
hepatic adenoma have also been reported
•Abnormalities in laboratory tests including: CPK, glucose tolerance, glucagon,
thyroid binding globulin, sex hormone binding globulin, other plasma proteins, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_725208] : 
•DAN is c ontraindicat ed for use in women who are pregnant or attempting to become
pregnant , undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding, markedly impaired hepatic, renal,
or cardiac function, porphyria, androgen- dependent tumors, and active thrombosis or
thromboembolic disease or history of such events
•DAN capsules contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose
intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose -galactose malabsorption are
excluded from this study
Precautions:  
•Caution is advised in patients with diabetes mellitus and DAN has been reported to
cause exacerbation of the manifestations of acute intermittent porphyria
•Caution is advised in the presence of known or suspected malignant disease. Thepresence of hormone -dependent carcinoma  should be excluded at least by [CONTACT_725267], as well as if breast nodules persist or enlarge during DAN
treatment
•Concomitant medications known to interact with DAN include carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050],
insulin, cyclosporin and tacrolimus, synthetic vitamin D analogs, statins, warfarin,
and other therapeutic agents. Appropriate precautions are described in protocol
Section  5.3.4
•DAN should be stopped if  any clinically significant adverse event arises, and
particularly if there is evidence of papi[INVESTIGATOR_59411], headache, visual disturbances orother signs or symptoms of raised intracranial pressure, jaundice or other indicationof significant hepatic disturbance, thrombosis or thromboembolism

DAN is no -longer marketed in the [LOCATION_002] ( US) for the  indication of fibrocystic breast 
disease. It was withdrawn on the grounds that the benefit -risk profile of the product is 
unfavorable given the risk of potentially serious adverse reactions in the setting of a  condition 
that is a benign, non- disease state. In addition, other treatment options exist which present low er 
risk of adverse reactions. However, DAN remains a marketed therapy in other indications 
including endometriosis  (Kux, 2018) .  
In the setting of MF , the most frequent toxicities associated with DAN have been moderate 
increases in liver enzymes in the first months of treatment, which improved following a reduction of DAN dose (Cervantes, 2005, 2015) . Liver function tests will be monitored 
throughout the study and t he dose of blinded study treatment may be reduced due to treatment -
related thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, or other toxicities according to protocol -specified criteria 
described in Section  3.4.  
1.6.4. Benefit /Risk Conclus ions 
Potential risks  of participation in the study include unforeseen safety events in addition to those 
described in above . During the conduct of the trial, a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will 
review the progress of the clinical trial, safety data, critical efficacy endpoints, and recommend 
to the sponsor whether the study should continue as planned, continue with modifications, or be 
stopped. While the DMC will be asked to advise regarding future conduct of the study, the sponsor retains final decision- making authority on all aspects of the study . Further description of 
the DMC is provided in Section  13.4 .  
MMB offers an important therapeutic diffe rentiation via the compound’s optimal inhibition of 
JAK1, JAK2, and ACVR1 with the potential to provide significant clinical benefit compared to 
available therapy for patients  with MF, along with opportunity for price competition, as a 
second -to-market inn ovation that could lower costs and broaden patient access. Without the 
approval of additional agents that have the potential to address the full spectrum of concerns of patients with advanced disease, there remains a significant unmet need in MF . 
Treatment with DAN for 24 weeks in the comparator arm has an acceptable balance of benefit 
and risk given the setting of a severely disabling or life threatening condition (MF) and the 
demonstrated potential for anemia response with less toxicity in compar ison to other anabolic 
steroids  as described in Section  1.5.3.  
1.7. Dose Justification  
The starting MMB dose in this trial  is 200 mg. T his dose has resulted in clinical improvements in 
splenomegaly, constitutional symptoms, and anemia benefit,  and was well tolerated over an 
extended use period with no significant drug related safety concerns observed in the Phase 3 SIMPLIFY studies.  
As recommended by [CONTACT_725268] s et al  (Cervantes, 2014) , the starting DAN dose in this trial is 
600 mg total daily dose . Subjects continuing on open- label DAN treatment to Week 48 will 
receive a reduced dose of 400 mg total daily dose, and may be progressively reduced to the 
minimum dose necessary to maintain the response.

Section  12.4.6. 
MFSAF TSS response:  ≥ 50% reduction in MFSAF TSS at Week 24, ie, the average of the daily 
TSS from the  consecutive 28 -day period prior to the end of Week 24, compared to baseline . 
Duration of MFSAF TSS response:  the number of days from the first day of the initial 28- day 
period in which a subject has a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline MFSAF TSS to the first day of 
the 28- day period during which the subject’s TSS equals or exceeds the ir baseline value . 
2.1.2. Splenic Response and Progression  
Splenic response:  ≥ 35% spleen volume reduction from baseline . 
Confirmed s plenic progression:   
a)Increase in spleen volume ≥ 25% from baseline, or
b)Symptomatic splenic progression defined as meeting both of the following criteria:
•Worsening of early satiety with weight loss ≥ 5 % from baseline ,
or worsening of sustained splenic pain following either:
−For subjects not previously receiving narcotic pain medication, i nitiation of new
narcotic pain medication use for ≥ 5 days , or
−≥ 50% increase from baseline in the daily dose of narcotic pain medication  for
≥ 5 days. B aseline narcotic pain medication  is defined in Section 5.3.2
•Increase in spleen volume ≥ 15% from baseline
Additional magnetic resonance imaging [ MRI ] or computed tomography [ CT] scan will be 
performed to confirm splenic progression. 
In the event of exceptional circumstances such as severe splenic progression requiring immediate 
action without possibility of confirmation by [CONTACT_240098]- read MRI/CT within a clinically 
acceptable period of time, the s ponsor may approve use of locally read MRI/CT or ultrasound as 
an alternative method of spleen volume measurement for confirmation of splenic progression. 
This approval must be obtained prior to cross- over to open -label MMB.  In these severe cases, 
short- term use of restricted anti -MF medication to treat severe splenic progression may be 
approved by [CONTACT_1142] .

2.1.3. Anemia  
Anemic:  defined for the purpose of study eligibility as any of the following:  
•For any subject; having received a transfusion within [ADDRESS_989855] day of
Baseline assessments (BL1), with pre- transfusion Hgb < 10 g/dL  (if a subject receives a
transfusion after Day BL1, but prior to Randomization, this  pre-transfusion hemoglobin
will be used for eligibility) , or

received within 28 days in which case the pre -transfusion (up to 7 days prior to transfusion) Hgb 
value will be used. 
Baseline RBC transfusion requirement:  number of units of RBC transfusion required per month; 
determined from number  of RBC transfusions given in the 8 -week period prior to Randomization  
(note: transfusion history is collected for the period of 12 weeks prior to Randomization) .

3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
3.1. Overall Trial  Design
This is a randomized, double- blind study intended to confirm the differentiated clinical benefit of 
MMB versus DAN in subjects who have previously received approved JAK inhibitor therapy for 
MF for a minimum of 90 days, or a minimum of 28 days if JAK inhibitor therapy is complicated 
by [CONTACT_725229] ≥ 4 units in 8 weeks, or Grade 3/[ADDRESS_989860] be symptomatic with a MFSAF TSS of  ≥ 10 at Screening 
and anemic with Hgb < 10 g/dL.  
Subjects will orally self -administer their randomized treatment, MMB plus placebo or DAN plus 
placebo. Subjects randomized to receive MMB who complete the Randomized Treatment Period  
to the end of Week 24 may  continue to receive MMB in the Open -label Extended Treatment 
Period  to the end of Week 204 ie, a total period of treatment of approximately 4 years .  
Subjects randomized to receive DAN may  cross -over to MMB open- label treatment in the 
following circumstances; a) at the end of Week 24 if they complete the Randomized Treatment 
Period ; b) at the end of Week 24 if they previously discontinued treatment with DAN but 
continue study assessments and did not receive prohibited medications  (unless use of prohibited 
anti-MF medication is approved by [CONTACT_456], eg, for short -term use); c) at any time prior to 
the end of Week 24 (during the Randomized Treatment Period) if they meet the protocol -defined 
criteria for confirmed splenic progression.  Subjects randomized to receive DAN who are receiving clinical benefit at the  end of Week [ADDRESS_989861] be made at the end of Week 24 ( Figure  1). 
Subjects will remain blinded to their randomized treatment assignment whenever possible . To 
enable decisions as to which patients will be allowed to initiate open- label MMB, for example, 
the unblinding process described in Section  5.[ADDRESS_989862] of 
the study, the sponsor retains final decision -making authority on all aspects of the study. 
After the Screening visit (s) and B aseline period (Figure  2), this trial begins with a 24- week 
Randomized Treatment Period , during which time data are collected for the primary analysis of 
efficacy. Subjects will be randomized on a 2:1 basis (MMB plus DAN placebo :  DAN plus 
MMB placebo ) stratified by  [CONTACT_725273] (≥  22 versus  < 22), baseline palpable spleen 
length below the left costal margin ( LCM, ≥ 12 cm versus <  12 cm) , baseline RBC units 
transfused in the 8- week period prior to Randomization  (0, 1- 4, and 5+)  and investigational site.

The trial includes the following:  
•Screening v isit(s); within 6 weeks prior to Randomization
•Baseline Period  (illustrated  in Figure  2); 7 consecutive days (Days BL1 to Day BL7) ,
prior to Randomization . The baseline MFSAF TSS will be determined over this  7-day
period as described in Section  7.3
•Randomization
•Day [ADDRESS_989863] dose of study treatment; after randomization, within [ADDRESS_989864] 4 hours after administration. Patients requiring anti -
hypertensive therapy should be closely monitored and anti -hypertensives may be
administered, if deemed clinically necessary.
•Randomized Treatment Period ; 24 weeks with visits at Weeks 2 and 4, and every
4 weeks until the end of Week 24
•Open -label Extended Treatment Period (MMB) ; for subjects randomized to MMB,
this may continue to the end of Week 204
•Open -label Extended Treatment Period (DAN); subjects receiving clinical benefit
from DAN in the Randomized Treatment Period  may continue to the Open-l abel
Extended Treatment Period with DAN to the end of Week 48
•Open -label Extended Treatment Period (MMB);, cross -over to treatment with open-
label MMB may occur after the completion of Week 24 assessments  and
discontinuation of randomized treatment (or earlier in the event of confirmed splenic
progression, as described in Section 3.5.2) and continue to the end of Week 204
•During the Open-l abel Extended T reatment P eriod , visits will occur every [ADDRESS_989865]
•Safety Follow -up V isit; [ADDRESS_989866] is to enter
the S urvival Follow -up Period
•Survival Follow -up; subjects will be assessed  for survival and leukemic
transformation  (which may be conducted by [CONTACT_24646])  every [ADDRESS_989867] dose  (Day 1)
Continuation of treatment at a reduced dose is preferred over treatment discontinuation, however, if a subject discontinues treatment prior to Week 24, every attempt should be made to continue 
all trial assessments including symptom assessments to  the end of Week 24.  
If a subject discontinues study treatment  prior to the Week 24  visit (eg, as a result of an AE, 
confirmed  splenic progression, or to begin another therapy) , every attempt should be made to 
maintain blinding of treatment assignment and to continue all trial assessments according to the 
Schedule of Events  (including transfusion recording, symptom assessments and PROs), to the 
end of Week 24.

any active MF therapy (defined in Section  5.3.3 ) known to reduce spleen size at Screening (including JAK inhibitors), scan to 
determine the baseline spleen volume  should be performed within the period Day BL1 to Randomization (between days BL4 
and Randomization is preferable, if feasible) . For s ubjects not receiving any active MF therapy known to reduce spleen size at 
Screening the scan should be performed within [ADDRESS_989870] dose of

3.2. Number of Subjects  
Approximately 180 subjects will be enrolled . 
3.3. Treatment Assignment 
Subjects will be randomized on a 2:[ADDRESS_989871] be recorded on the electronic Case 
Report Form ( eCRF ). 
Blinded treatment (MMB plus placebo or DAN plus placebo) and open- label treatment with 
MMB or DAN may be interrupted and/or reduced due to thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, or other toxicities . During the Randomized Treatment Period , doses of both components of the 
study treatment ie, MMB plus placebo or DAN plus placebo will be reduced in the event of 
toxicity according to protocol -specified cri teria below.  
Continuation of study treatment at a reduced dose is preferred over treatment discontinuation. Dose reduction will be by [CONTACT_725274]  6, except in the case of 
non-hematologic  or other toxicities, as described in Section  3.4.3. 
Criteria for cross -over to open- label MMB or DAN are provided in Section  3.5.2. 
Treatmen t may be interrupted for up to 28 days, inclusive of taper, and restarted as described in 
the following sections. If toxicity persists beyond 28 days, treatment may be restarted upon 
sponsor approval.  
If toxicity recurs, additional treatment interruptions may be made and sequential dose reductions 
may be applied if treatment is resumed.  
In the event of Grade 3 or 4 toxicity , relevant laboratory tests should be performed more 
frequently and closely monitored, according to the investigator’s clinical discretion.  
Re-escalation is allowed upon resolution of toxicity or return to baseline grade , at the 
investigator’s discretion.  
In the setting of this study, the investigator should the assess the need for dose modification or 
discontinuation of study treatment for the individual case, the overall benefit risk to the patient, 
the severity of AE, response to treatment and level of benefit  in discussion with the sponsor.

•For subjects with baseline PLT count ≥ 100 × 109/L:
−If PLT count < 50 × 109/L but ≥ 20 × 109/L, study treatment should be reduced by

interrupted and may resume with reduc tion by 1 decrement , if PLT count recovers
to ≥ 50 × 109/L, in the absence of platelet transfusion for ≥  5 days
•For subjects with baseline PLT count <  100 × 109/L but ≥ 50 × 109/L:
−If PLT count < 20 × 109/L, study t reatment should be tapered, if appropriate, and
interrupted and may resume with reduc tion by 1 decrement , if PLT count recovers
to ≥ 50% of the baseline value  in the absence of platelet transfusion for ≥  5 days
•For subjects with baseline PLT count <  50 × 109/L:
−If PLT count < 20 × 109/L, study t reatment should be tapered, if appropriate, and
interrupted

reduc tion by 1 decrement
3.4.2. Dose Adjustments for Neutropenia  
If the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is < 0.5 × 109/L, treatment should be tapered, if 
appropriate, and interrupted. After recovery of the ANC to ≥  0.75 × 109/L, study treatment  may 
be restarted  with reduction by [ADDRESS_989873] dose level (dose 
decrement 3), treatment may be resumed at the same dose if the ANC count recovers to 
≥ 0.75 × 109/L. Re-escalation is allowed upon resolution of toxicity or return to baseline grade , at 
the investigator’s discretion.

3.4.3. Dose Adjustments for Non -hematologic or Other Toxicities 
Taper, if appropriate, and interruption of treatment should be considered in the event of clinically 
relevant Grade 3 or 4 non- hematologic toxicity that the investigator considers related to study 
treatment, or ≥ Grade 2 bleeding event. Treatment may resume with reduc tion by 1 decrement 
upon resolution of toxicity to ≤  Grade 1, or baseline  grade . For subjects receiving the lowest dose 
level (dose decrement 3), trea tment may be resumed at the same dose if the toxicity  recovers to 
≤ Grade 1, or baseline  grade . Treatment may be resumed at the original dose if the investigator 
no longer considers the event, in retrospect, to be related to study treatment . Re-escalation is 
allowed upon resolution of toxicity or return to baseline grade, at the investigator’s discretion.  
Dose reductions may also be made based on investigator discretion, for example in the event of 
grade [ADDRESS_989874] day of dosing, dose reduction with re -escalation following resolution of 
symptoms is recommended. 
3.4.4. Splenic Progression, Leukemic Transformation, and Disease Progression  
Subjects with confirmed splenic progression as (defin ed in Section  2.1.2 ) or leukemic 
transformation (defined in Section 2.1.4) will discontinue study treatment  as described in  
Section  3.5.1. Subjects randomized to DAN who discontinue due to confirmed splenic 
progression may cross -over to open -label treatment with MMB, after discontinuing DAN, 
according to the criteria in Section 3.5.2. 
Study treatment will be discontinued if disease progression or toxicity is observed that, in the 
judgement of the investigator, compromises the ability to continue therapy and/or trial specifi c 
procedures required for the safe continuation of therapy as described in  Section  3.5.1. 
3.5. Treatment Cross -over and Discontinuation Criteria  
3.5.1. Discontinuat ion from Study Treatment  
Continuation of study treatment at a reduced dose is preferred over treatment discontinuation, however, treatment will be discontinued in the event of leukemic transformation  (defin ed in 
Section  2.1.4) , and in the event of pregnancy. Treatment will also be discontinued i n the event of 
disease progression, confirmed splenic progression, or toxicity observed that, in the judgement of 
the investigator, compromises the ability to continue therapy and/or trial -specific procedures 
required for the safe continuation of therapy.  
When discontinuing study treatment , dosing may be tapered over a period of at least 1 week, at 
investigator’s discretion. For subjects receiving the starting dose or first dose decrement , it is 
recommended that the dose be reduced to the second dose decrement  for 1 week prior to 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_056]  (dose decrements are sh own in Table  6). Treatment may be stopped 
immediately for subjects receiving the second or third dose decrement . 
If a subject discontinues study treatment prior to the Week 24 visit (eg, as a result of an AE, or to begin another therapy) , every attempt should be made to maintain blinding of treatment 

SRA‑ MMB‑301  
59 of 134 momelotinib / danazol  Version 2.0 (18-D EC-2020) 
 
assignment  and to continue all trial assessments to the end of Week 24, including transfusion 
recording, symptom assessments, spleen volume, and PROs .   
For subjects randomized to DAN, cross -over to open- label MMB treatment may still occur at the 
end of Week [ADDRESS_989875] does not receive prohibited medications  (unless use of prohibited 
anti-MF medication is approved by [CONTACT_3211], eg, for short -term use)  and study assessments have 
been completed as described in Section  3.5.2.  
The treatment discontinuation visit is described in Section 7.6 . 
3.5.2. Study Treatment Cross -over 
Prior to Week 24, subjects will discuss with the investigator or designee whether they wish to 
receive open -label MMB  after completing Week 24 assessments . Following the completion of 
Week 24 assessments, subjects will be able to receive MMB in the Open Label Extended 
Treatment Period , providing they are  not restricted from doing so according to the criteria 
described below.  
Subjects who previously discontinued blinded study treatment prior to the end of Week 24, who 
wish to initiate open label MMB will only be allowed to do so if confirmed they were receiving 
DAN, as per the unblinding process as described in Section  5.6.  
Subjects who are willing and able to receive open -label MMB  may  begin open- label MMB at the 
following timepoints and continue therapy up to the end of Week 204:  
a.At the end of Week 24 if they complete the Randomized Treatment Period  and Week
24 assessments.
b.At the end of Week 24 if they discontinue d treatment with DAN prior to the end of
Week 24, but continued study assessments and did  not receive prohibited medica tions
(as described in Section 5.3.4) , unless use of prohibited anti -MF medication is
approved by [CONTACT_456], eg, for short -term use.
c.At any time prior to the end of Week 24 (during the Randomized Treatment Period ) if
they meet the protocol -defined criteria for confirmed splenic progression (defin ed in
Section  2.1.2)  and it is  confirmed they were receiving randomized treatment with
DAN as per the unblinding process as described in Section 5.6 .
At completion of the Randomized Treatment Period including Week 24 assessments, subjects 
who choose to receive open- label MMB , and are not restricted by [CONTACT_725275], will 
begin tre atment at the 200 mg starting dos e, unless during the Randomized T reatment Period  the 
dose of study treatment was reduced for suspected MMB associated toxicity ; ie, for subjects who 
previously required a dose reduction of blinded study treatment for AEs considered by [CONTACT_725276], the starting dose of open- label MMB will be 
the same as was administered in the Randomized T reatment Period . Dose  re-escalation is 
allowed upon resolution of toxicity or return to baseline grade, at the investigator’s discretion, to a maximum daily dose of [ADDRESS_989876] dose of open- label MMB.  
Subjects randomized to receive DAN who are receiving clinical benefit at the end of Week 24 and do not to cross- over to MMB may continue open- label DAN therapy up to Week 48 at a 
maximum total daily dose of 400 mg. Subjects who were receiving a reduced dose of DAN

during the Randomized Treatment Period should remain on the reduced dose. During open- label 
treatment with DAN, the dose may be progressively reduced to the minimum dose necessary to 
maintain the response.  
Subjects who choose not to continue to open- label MMB or DAN will discontinue study 
treatment.  MMB taper requirements are described in Section  3.5.1. 
3.5.3. Replacement of Subjects  
Randomized subjects will not be replaced. Whilst the protocol addendum “G uidance on 
temporary procedures during the COVID -19 pandemic” is in effect, i f the s ponsor determines 
collection of data required to evaluate the key study endpoints is adversely affected by [CONTACT_4113]- 19 (eg, due to early discontinuation of subjects with COVID -19 infection), a similar 
number of additional subjects may be enrolled to a maximum of up to [ADDRESS_989877] ensure that adequate 
consideration is given to the protection of the subjects’  interest s. 
Reasons for terminating the trial overall or at a specific trial site may include, but are not limited to, the following:  
•The incidence or severity of AEs in this trial indicate a potential health hazard to
subjects
•Subject enrollment is unsatisfactory
•Data recording is inaccurate or incomplete
•Investigator does not adhere to the protocol or applicable regul atory requirements in
conducting the trial
•Availability of continued access to MMB via an extension study
In cases of early termination of the trial (eg , due to toxicity) or a temporary halt by [CONTACT_456], 
the sponsor or sponsor’s designee will notify the  appropriate Regulatory Authorities and 
Institutional Review Board/ Independent Ethics Committee  (IRB /IEC ) according to the local

Hormonal methods of contraception are prohibited due to the risk of interactions with DAN. 
Acceptable methods of contraception are described in Appendix 4. 
5.3.4. Recommended Precautions  with Concomitant Medications  
On the day of the first dose of study treatment, anti -hypertensive therapy should not be taken 
until at least 4 hours after study treatment  administration . Patients requiring anti -hypertensive 
therapy should be closely monitored and anti -hypertensives may be administered, if deemed 
clinically necessary . 
Potent CYP3A4 inducers (eg, carbamazep ine, phenytoin, and St. John’s Wort ) may only be used 
in exceptional circumstances with prior approval by [CONTACT_456] . Guidance on identification of 
CYP3A4 inducers is provided in Appendix 5. 
MMB has been determined to be an inhibitor of the BCRP ( Breast Cancer Resistance Protein ) 
transporter. Plasma exposures of BCRP substrates may increase when administered with MMB. 
Consequently, dose modification of the BCRP substrate, or alternative medications as clinically 
appropriate , may be considered during  MMB  therapy. Guidance on identification of BCRP 
substrates is provided in Appendix 5. 
According to the approved US and [LOCATION_008] ( [LOCATION_006]) prescribing information for DAN , the 
following intera ctions  are known in  relat ionship to DAN and r ecommended precautions are 
provided:  
Effect  Recommended Precaution (s) 
Prolongation of prothrombin time in 
patients stabilized on warfarin  Close monitoring of prothrombin time , including at 
any DAN dose re -escalation  
Increase in plasma levels of 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_160667]. 
Similar interaction with phenobarbital 
is likely . No recommendation provided, however, study sponsor recommends m onitor ing for evidence of 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenytoin, and phenobarbital  toxicity 
and assess ment  of serum levels as indicated

5.4. Treatment Compliance 
Subjects will be asked to bring any remaining study drug with them to each clinic visit.  The 
investigator should make every effort to ensure subjects’ compliance to treatment.  
Each  trial site must maintain accurate records demonstrating dates and quantities  of study drugs  
dispensed  for each subject and document the number of drug units returned at each clinic visit , 
with details  noted of any missed dosing, or if any study drug was accidentally or deliberately 
destroyed. The amount of study treatment dispensed is to be recorded and compared with the 
amount returned. At the end of the trial, full reconciliation must be made between the amount of 
study treatment  supplied, dispensed, and subsequently destroyed or returned to the depot  (see 
also Section  6.3).

69 of 134 momelotinib / danazol  Version 2.0 (18-D EC-2020) 
 
5.5. Randomization and Blinding 
Minimization will be used to assign eligible subjects in a 2:1 ratio to receive MMB plus DAN 
placebo  or DAN plus MMB placebo. Minimization is a  dynamic  randomization technique 
designed to reduce imbalances of prognostic factors between treatment arms for b aseline 
variables which include : baseline MFSAF TSS, baseline RBC units transfused, baseline spleen 
length (by [CONTACT_725280]), and investigational site . No treatment allocation will be 
deterministic.  
Subjects , site personnel and the project team, including the project statistician and biostatisticians 
will be blinded. The DMC will include at least one unblinded independent biostatistician who 
will be involved in charter development, SAP analysis, data monitoring and analysis. The DMC 
is described in Section  13.4.  
5.6. Unblinding 
Subjects will receive blinded study treatment from Day [ADDRESS_989885] discontinues study treatment prior to the Week 24 but continues study assessments and does not receive prohibited medications, t heir treatment assignment will be unblinded at the 
end of Week 24 by [CONTACT_725281] (IRT) system . If the 
subject was receiving DAN in the Randomized Treatment P eriod , they may elect to initiate open-
label MMB  after comp leting Week [ADDRESS_989886]  meet s the protocol -defined criteria for confirmed splenic progression (defin ed in 
Section  2.1.2)  during the Randomized Treatment Period , their treatment assignment will be 
unblinded by [CONTACT_725282] . If the subject was receiving randomized 
treatment with DAN they wil l be eligible to initiate open -label treatment with MMB.  If the 
subject was receiving randomized treatment with MMB they discontinue study treatment. MMB taper requirements are described in Section  3.5.1. 
If a subject elects not to receive MMB in the Open-label Extended Treatment Period, but wishes 
to continue receiving DAN if their randomized treatment assignment is confirmed to be DAN , 
their treatment assignment will be unblinded by [CONTACT_725283] . For subjects 
randomized to DAN, cross- over to open- label MMB treatment may still occur at the end of 
Week [ADDRESS_989887] of the study (eg, all  site staff and 

SRA‑ MMB‑301  
70 of 134 momelotinib / danazol  Version 2.0 (18-D EC-2020) 
 
participants, monitoring personnel, and appropriate sponsor’s personnel) will be blinded to 
randomized treatment assignment. Requests for unblinding should be directed to the sponsor Medical Monitor. If unblinding is required urgently for s afety reasons, a subject’s treatment 
assignment will be accessible immediately by [CONTACT_725283]. This activity will be logged by [CONTACT_725284].  
The investigator should document and provide an explanation for any unplanned unblinding 
which may occur due to reporting requirements for SAEs, emergency unblinding for patient 
safety, or accidental unblinding.

7. TRIAL PROCEDURES
7.1. Investigations Schedule
All protocol required tests, procedures, and observations, along with their chronology, are 
outlined in the Schedule of Events  (Table  7). Whilst the pr otocol addendum “ Guidance on 
temporary procedures during the COVID -19 pandemic ” is in effect,  modified study procedures  
as described in the addendum may be used to reduce risks to study subjects and burden on healthcare facilities. 
7.2. Screening Evaluations 
The Schedule of Events  (Table  7) provides a list of evaluations to be performed at Screening. A 
schematic view  of Screening and Baseline as sessments is shown in Figure  2. 
The Screening  Period for a subject commences when the subject undergoes the first trial -specific 
Screening  assessment , having provided informed consent via the ICF .  
All required procedures must be performed only after obtaining informed consent unless the 
assessment was already performed within the allowable window as standard of care.  Subjects 
will acknowledge and agree to the possible use of this information for the trial by [CONTACT_223085].  
All Screening  evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential subjects 
meet all eligibility criteria. Central laboratory assessments should be used to determine 
eligibility, however, if central laboratory assessments are not available prior to Day 1 ( first dose ), 
local laboratory assessments may be used with approval of sponsor  where necessary . The 
sponsor should be consulted regarding any repeat of screening laboratory assessments.  The 
investigator will maintain a Screening  log to record details of all subjects screened and to 
confirm eligibility or record reasons for Screening  failure, as applicable.  
Subjects will be trained in the use of an ePRO device  issued to them. The ePRO device is the 
physical hardware that will be used by [CONTACT_725288] . Alternative methods including paper forms may be used to record PRO responses in 
exceptional circumstances, such as interruption of the ePRO system due to technical issues, with 
the approval of the sponsor . A single  MFSAF assessmen t required for eligibility must be 
completed at the site during Screening, prior  to beginning the 7- day period of baseline  MFSAF 
assessments which will be completed electronically by [CONTACT_725289] 
(Days BL1 to Day BL7) . If necessary, eg, due to technical or subject training issues with the 
assessment, the screening MFSAF assessment may be repeated and used for eligibility with 
approval from the s ponsor. 
Medical history should include MF medication history including the s tart and stop dates and dose 
of the last course of JAK inhibitor therapy, last spleen volume measurement, and best spleen response (response, stable disease, or splenic progression per IWG criteria) during JAK inhibitor 
therapy, and any available information regarding the subject’s genetic profile  and bone marrow 
fibrosis . Transfusion recording will include pre -transfusion Hgb concentration, and 
documentation of whether the transfusion was due to factors such as clinically overt bleeding, or 
accident/injury .

7.3. Baseline Evaluations 
Baseline evaluations are shown in the Schedule of Events  (Table  7). A schem atic view  of 
Screening and Baseline assessments is shown in Figure  2. Baseline laboratory assessments 
should be consistent with requirements of the eligibility criteria . 
The MFSAF will be completed electronically daily for 7 consecutive days ( Days BL1 to BL7) , 
prior to Randomization  using an ePRO device to provide a baseline assessment. Alternative 
methods including paper forms may be used to record PRO responses in exceptional 
circumstances, such as interruption of the ePRO system due to technical issues, with the approval of the sponsor . If more than [ADDRESS_989889] 
non-compliance (eg, technical problems with the ePRO device), the sponsor should be contact[CONTACT_725291]. 
For subjects with ongoing JAK inhibitor therapy at Screening, JAK inhibitor therapy must be 
tapered over a period of at least [ADDRESS_989890] a reduced taper period, or no taper, with the sponsor’s approval . A non-
treatment interval begin s ≥7 days prior to Day BL1 (the first of 7 consecutive days of baseline 
MFSAF assessments) .  
In order to provide a consistent baseline assessment of spleen volume, the baseline MRI (or CT) scan ( contrast not required)  must be performed within the time periods described below. 
However, the results of the scan are not required prior to beginning study treatment.  
•For subjects receiving any active MF therapy (defined in Section 5.3.3)  known to
reduce spleen size at Screening (including JAK inhibitors) – the scan should be
performed within the period Day BL1 to Randomization (between days BL4 andRandomization is preferable, if feasible)
•For subjects not receiving any active MF therapy known to reduce spleen size at the
start of the S creening period, the scan should be performed within 2 weeks  prior to
Randomization
7.4. Evaluations During Treatment Per iods
The Randomized Treatment Period  will begin on Day 1 and end at the conclusion of Week 24. 
The Open -label Extended Treatment Period continues to the end of Week 204, ie the total period 
of treatment may be approximately 4 years . Procedures a re shown in  the Schedule of Events  
(Table  7). 
Clinical evaluations and laboratory studies may be repeated more frequently than detailed, if 
clinically indicated.

7.5. Cross -over  Visit  
Criteria for receiving MMB in the Open-l abel Extended Treatment Period after completing the 
Randomized Treatment Period, or in the event of confirmed splenic progression are described in 
Section  3.5.2. 
If the scheduling of the first dose of open- label treatment does not coincide with the scheduled 
Week [ADDRESS_989891] dose of  treatment during this visit. Subjects 
should continue randomized treatment until the Cross -over Visit to avoid the need to taper and 
temporarily discontinue therapy.  
Laboratory assessments, ECG, physical examination, vital signs, and ECOG performance status 
scheduled for the Cross- over Visit do not need to be repeated if done within 1 week (ie at a prior 
visit).  
Subjects are required to remain for observation for a minimum of [ADDRESS_989892] 4 hours after 
administration.  Patients requiring anti- hypertensive therapy should be closely monitored and 
anti-hypertensives may be administered, if deemed clinically necessary. Procedures are shown in 
the Schedule of Events ( Table  7). 
Procedures to be followed in the event a subject discontinues study treatment prior to the end of 
Week [ADDRESS_989893] day of 
MMB  and thereafter follow the visit schedule shown in the Schedule of E vents ( Table  7) for the 
Open-la bel Extended Treatment  Period  for E arly Cross- over (EC) v isits ie, W eeks EC 4, EC 8,

7.6. Treatment Discontinuation Visit  
If a subject discontinues study treatment prior to the Week [ADDRESS_989894] discontinues study treatment and a scheduled study visit was not performed within 5 days of treatment discontinuation, the following procedures should be performed at a 
Treatment D iscontinuation V isit: 
•MMB/DAN/placebo accountability
•Physical examination (including spleen palpation or ultrasound exam )
•CBC with dif ferential
•AEs/SAE and concomitant medications recording
•Transfusion and pre -transfusion Hgb recording
•Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], GP / family doctor, and urgent care visit recording
•ECOG performance s tatus
•If it is not possible or acceptable for a subject to continue PRO assessments to the endof Week [ADDRESS_989895] dose. This information may come from a visit to 
your doctor, a phone call or information may also be gathered from public records such as 
government census or death records. 
Procedures are  shown in the Schedule of Events  (Table  7).

Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) 
The EORTC QLQ -C30 assesses the health -related QoL in cancer patients participating in clinical 
trials  (Aaronson, 1993). The QLQ -C30 is comprised of 5 functional scales (physical, role, 
emotional, social, cognitive), eight single item symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting, 
appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, insomnia, dyspnea), as well as sub- scales assessing global 
health/QoL and financial impact. Most i tems use a 4 -point Likert scale from “not at all” to “very 
much” and a one -week recall period with the exception of the final two items which use a 7 point 
scale response. Raw scores are transformed to a 0 -100 scale, with higher scores representing 
better functioning/QoL and greater symptom burden. An example questionnaire is provided in 
Appendix 6.

8.2.3. Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) – 
Physical Function  
The PROMIS Physical Function Short Form 10b consists of 10 questions, and an additional 
4 questions relating to physical function from the PROMIS item bank will be included; each has a 5-point response. The PROMIS short form assesses the self -reported capability of a patient 
rather than actual performance of physical activities. This includes the functioning of one’s upper extremities (dexterity), lower extremities (walking or mobility), and central regions (neck, back)  
(Hays, 2013), as well as instrumental activities of daily living, such as running er rands. An 
example questionnaire is provided in Appendix 6. 
8.2.4. Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS)  
The PGIS will be used to evaluate subjects' impression of both the severity of their MF symptoms and fatigue. For the purpose of this study, the PGIS consists of a single question 
relating to MF symptoms and a single question relating to fatigue, each with a 4- point response. 
Example questionnaires are provided in Appendix 6. 
8.2.5. Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)  
The PGIC scale, which has been widely used to evaluate a patient's overall sense of whether a 
treatment has been beneficial  (Cella, 2002) , will be utiliz ed in this study to assess patient 
perceptions of change in both their MF symptoms and fatigue over time  and. For the purpose of 
this study, the PGIC consists of a single question re lating to MF symptoms and a single question 
relating to fatigue , each with a 5- point response . Example questionnaires are provided in 
Appendix 6. 8.2.6. The EuroQoL Five Dimension (EQ- 5D) 5- Level Questionnaire  
The EuroQoL Five Dimension assesses a subject ’s health status in  5 dimensions: mobility; self -
care; usual activities; pain or discomfort; and anxiety or depression. The 5 -level EQ -5D version 
(EQ-5D-5L) was introduced by [CONTACT_725293] 2009 to improve the instrument’s 
sensitivity and to reduce ceiling effects, as compared to the EQ -5D-3L. The EQ -5D-5L consists 
of the EQ- 5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale  (VAS) . 
The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self -care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight 
problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to 
indicate his/her health state by [CONTACT_24213]. This decision results in a 1- digit number that expresses the level selected for 
that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5- digit number that 
describes the patient’s health state.  
The EQ VAS  records the patient’s self -rated health on a vertical VAS , whe re the anchors are 
labeled ‘The best health you can imagine’ and ‘The worst health you can imagine’  (Health 
policy , 1990) . An example questionnaire is provided in Appendix 6.

8.2.7. Myelofibrosis- 8 Dimension (MF -8D) 
The MF -8D is a well -validated condition- specific preference -based measure for MF derived 
from the MFSAF a nd the generic cancer measure EORTC QLQ -C30 (Mukuria, 2015) . The 
generated MF -8D utility values can be used to estimate quality-adjusted life- years for use in 
economic evaluation using data from past and future myeloproliferative neoplasm conditions 
trials that have used both measures. The classification system has eight dimensions: physical functioning and emotional functioning (collected from the EORTC -QLQC30) and fatigue, night 
sweats, i tchiness, abdominal discomfort, pain under the left rib, and bone or muscle pain 
(collected from the MFSAF), with four or five severity levels for the first three dimensions and two levels for the last five dimensions. The inclusion of MF -specific symptoms and the 
exclusion of symptoms such as nausea and vomiting that were not relevant in this population means that this measure is better suited for generating utility values than either the EORTC -8D 
or mapped values to the EQ -5D. 
8.3. Spleen Measurement  
8.3.1. Spleen Length by [CONTACT_725243] (or U ltrasound)  
Spleen  length measured by [CONTACT_725294]. T hereafter , spleen length will be 
measured  at the timepoints noted in the Schedule of Events  (Table  7) and as indicated in order to 
assess splenic progression .  
8.3.2. Spleen Volume by [CONTACT_9268] (or CT) Scan  
Spleen volume will be assessed locally by [CONTACT_725295] (contrast 
not required)  at baseline (refer to Section  7.3 and Figure  2 for timing of baseline spleen volume 
assessment ) and during the study at the  timepoints noted in the Schedule of Events  (Table  7).  
All scan images will be provided to the s ponsor for central assessment  and the SRR endpoint will 
be analyzed using centrally read volumetric data . The central imaging laboratory will provide 
instructions for collection and transfer of scan images. Repeat scans may be required if the original scan is not accepted by [CONTACT_229705], which may occur if the scan is of 
poor quality. The central imaging laboratory will assess spleen volume as described in the 
Independent Review Charter.  
An additional scan will be performed if required to confirm splenic progression as defined in  
Section  2.1.2. Locally -read volume assessments may be used in this case, though images must 
also be provided for central assessment. 
If a subject is unable to have spleen volume measurement by [CONTACT_9268], a CT scan may be performed. 
However, where feasible, the same imaging modality should be used throughout the study.  
8.4. Leukemic Transformation and Survival  
After the S afety Follow -up V isit, s ubjects will be followed for leukemia status and survival 
every [ADDRESS_989916] dose of study treatment .

9. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS
9.1. Safety Parameters  
9.1.1. Med ical and Medication History  
A complete medical and surgical history including MF  symptoms assessment will be obtained at 
Screening . The medical history will include 12 weeks  of transfusion history, as described in 
(Section  8.1).  
Medication history should include a  history of MF medications including the start and stop dates 
and dose of the last course of JAK inhibitor therapy. Also, all medications taken within the 
[ADDRESS_989917] be captured, 
including dose and reason for change. 
Follow up is required for all SAEs and for those AEs considered drug related (highly probable, 
probable or possible) present at the  Safety Follow -up V isit. Follow- up will continue until the 
event resolves, returns to baseline, stabilizes, or the subject discontinues from trial. Complete 
details regarding safety monitoring and reporting are provided in Section 9.2. 
9.1.3. Physical Examination  
At Screening , a complete physical examination will be performed including height, and weight. 
Breast, genital, and rectal examinations are not required at any visit unless warranted in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. Height and weight should be collected per standard practice. At 
subsequent visits, the physical examination will be an interim examination to monitor for any 
changes, and will also include weight and assessment of disease -related clinical signs.  Physical 
examination will be performed at the timepoints noted in the Schedule of Events  (Table  7). 
9.1.4. Vital Signs  
Vital signs to be measured will include heart rate, systolic/diastolic blood pressure (while sitting, unless medically contraindicated), and oral temperature, unless otherwise indicated. Vital signs will be measured at the timepoin ts noted in the Schedule of Events  (Table  7). 
9.1.5. Laboratory Assessments  
All samples for laboratory assessments will be sent to the central laboratory (unless approved 
otherwise by [CONTACT_725296]’s eCRF) with the exception of urine pregnancy test s, urinalysis , and virology screen (including hepatitis B and C)  which will be 
completed at the site  or local laboratory. Screening laboratory samples should be obtained within 
6 weeks  prior to Randomization. Local laboratory CBC assessments may be collected as required 

SRA‑ MMB‑301  
87 of 134 momelotinib / danazol  Version 2.0 (18-D EC-2020) 
 
for dose adjustments throughout the study. All local laboratory assessments resulting in a dose 
change will be reported.  
The central laboratory will be responsible for chemistry, CBC, serum pregnancy testing, PSA 
testing as required  for eligibility , and storage of other study samples. Any sample collected per 
the Schedule of Events  (Table  7) may be analyzed with any tests necessary to ensure subject 
safety. Details of sample processing and collection a re provided in the SRA -MMB -[ADDRESS_989918] of laboratory tests is provided in  Table  8.  
Central laboratory assessments should be used to determine eligibility, however, if central 
laboratory assessments are not available prior to Day 1 (first dose), local laboratory assessments may be used with approval of s ponsor  where necessary . The s ponsor should be consulted 
regarding any repeat of screening laboratory assessments.

9.1.6. Electrocardiogram  
A single 12- lead ECG will be collected using local equipment at the applicable study visit per the 
Schedule of Events  (Table  7). The investigator will review all ECGs and retain the tracing with 
the source documents. 
9.2. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
9.2.1. Definition s (Adverse Events)  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a trial subject administered an investigational 
product(s), a comparator product, or an approved drug regardless of the causal relationship with 
treatment.  
An AE, therefore, can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including laboratory finding), 
symptom or disease temporally associated with participation in an investigational trial, whether or not considered drug related. In addition to new events, any increase in the severity or 
frequency of a pre -existing condition that occurs after the subject receives the first dose of study 
treatment is considered an AE. This includes any side effect, injury, toxicity, or sensitivity 
reaction. All reported AEs will be coded using the current version of Medical Dictionary f or 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  
An AE includes, but is not limited to, those in the following list:  
•A clinically significant worsening of a pre -existing condition. This includes
conditions that may resolve completely and then become abnormal again
•Any recurrence of an intermittent pre -existing condition at a frequency or severity
that differs from the subject’s historical experience
•Any injury or accident occurring during the Screening , on-treatment, or post -
treatment periods. If a medical condition is known to have caused the injury oraccident (eg, a fall secondary to dizziness), the medical condition (dizziness) and the
accident (fall) should be reported as 2 separate AEs
•Any abnormality in physiological testing or a physical examination finding that
requires clinical intervention or further investigation (beyond ordering a repeat
[confirmatory] test)
•Any laboratory (eg, clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis) or investigational
abnormality (eg, ECG, X -ray) independent of the underlying medical con dition that
requires clinical intervention, results in further investigation (beyond ordering a
repeat [confirmatory] test), or leads to study treatment  interruption or discontinuation
unless it is associated with an already reported clinical event. If the  laboratory
abnormality is part of a syndrome, the syndrome or diagnosis (eg, anemia) not thelaboratory result (eg, decreased Hgb ) should be recorded
•AEs occurring from an overdose of study treatment , whether accidental or intentional

SRA‑ MMB‑301  
90 of 134 momelotinib / danazol  Version 2.0 (18-D EC-2020) 
 
•AEs occurring from lack of efficacy of study treatment , for example, if the
investigator suspects that a drug batch is not efficacious or if the investigator suspects
that study treatment  has contributed to disease progression
•An AE occurring from misuse of study treatment
•An AE associated with the discontinuation of the use of study treatment
Note: A pre -existing condition is a clinical condition that is diagnosed before the subject receives 
the first dose of study treatment .  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event s 
An SAE is an AE that meets one or more of the following criteria:  
•Results in death
•Life threatening experience defined as any adverse experience that places the subject,in the view of the sponsor or investigator, at immediate risk of death at the time ofoccurrence; ie, it does no t include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe
form, might have caused death
•Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324](except scheduled hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315] a non- acute, unrelated cause such as
transfus ions or elective surgery)
•Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity (ie, substantial disruption ina subject’s ability to conduct normal activities of daily living)
•Results in a congenital anomaly/ birth defect in the offspring of an exposed femalesubject or offspring of a female partner of a male subject
•Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered SAEs when, based upon appropriate medicaljudgment, they jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgicalintervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition
For fatal SAEs, wherever possible report the cause of death as an SAE with a fatal outcome rather than reporting death as the SAE term. When available the autopsy report will be provided to the sponsor.  
All SAEs that occur after any subject has been enrolled, before treatment, during treatment, or 
within [ADDRESS_989919] be recorded using the  CRF/eCRF  (or backup SAE  form if necessary)  provided by [CONTACT_725297], Inc . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Events Exempt f rom Reporting as Serious Adverse Events 
Events specified in this section do not require reporting as SAEs in this trial. The events must still be recorded  using the  CRF/eCRF .  
Elective admissions to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_725212]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_725213]‑ MMB‑301  
91 of 134 momelotinib / danazol  Version 2.0 (18-D EC-2020) 
 
also exempt from being reported as an SAE. However, if hospi[INVESTIGATOR_725214], an SAE report  must be completed. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Other Reportable Events  
Other events that must be reported within the s ame timelines as an SAE  are listed below ; 
however, these events should be considered/recorded as SAEs only if the outcome meets one of the SAE criteria provided in  Section  [IP_ADDRESS].  
•Pregnancy exposure to study treatment. Any pregnancy occurring in a subject or a
subject’s partner during study treatment or occurring within [ADDRESS_989920] is
withdrawn from the trial  as described in Section  9.2.9
•Overdose of study treatment with or without an AE
−An overdose is defined as an accidental or intentional administration of a quantity
of a medicinal product given per administration or cumulatively which is above
the per -protocol dose. In cases of a discrepancy in drug accountability, overdose
will be established only when it is clear that the subject has taken the excess
dose(s). Overdose cannot be established when the subject cannot account for the
discrepancy except in cases in which the investigator has reason to suspect that
the subject has taken the additional dose (s).
•Inadvertent or accidental exposure to study treatment or m edication error with or
without an AE
−Medication error is any unintentional error in the prescribing, dispensing, or
administration of a medicinal product while in the control of the health car e
provider, subject, or consumer.
•Any AE that could be related to the protocol procedures, and which could modify theconduct of the trial
•Abuse or misuse of the study treatment
−Abuse is defined as persistent or sporadic intentional excessive use of a medi cinal
product by a subject
−Misuse is defined as any intentional and inappropriate use of a medicinal product
that is not in accordance with the protocol instructions or the local prescribinginformation

9.2.2. Relationship to Study  Treatment  
The relationship of t he AE to study treatment should be assessed using the following criteria:  
Relationship Description  
Highly probable  Starts within a time related to study treatment  administration and  
No obvious alternative medical explanation  
Probable  Starts within a time related to study treatment  administration and  
Cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_126026]’s clinical state  
Possible  Starts within a time related to study treatment  administration and  
A causal relationship between study treatment and the AE is at least a 
reasonable possibility  
Unlikely  The time association or the subject’s clinical state is such that the trial drug is not likely to have had an association with the observed effect 
or an alternative medical explanation is more likely ie, a causal 
relationship between study treatment  and the AE is not a reasonable 
possibility  
Not related  The AE is definitely not associated with study treatment administered  
Note: The relationship of an AE to study treatment, including for the purposes of safety reporting (except in 
jurisdictions where  safety reporting requirement s mandat e an alternative classification ), will be “drug related” for 
events assessed as possible, probable or highly probable  and “not -drug related” for events assessed as unlikely, or 
not-related . 
The investigator must endeavor to obtain sufficient information to determine the causality of the 
AE (ie, study treatment, other illness, progressive malignancy etc.) and must provide his/her 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_725215]. This may require instituting supplementary investigations of significant AEs based on their clinical judgement of 
the likely causative factors and/or include seeking a further opi[INVESTIGATOR_35269] a specialist in the field 
of the AE.  
The following guidance should be taken into account when assessing the causality of an AE:  
•Previous experience with the study treatment  and whether the AE is known to have
occurred with the study treatment
•Alternative explanations for the AE such as concomitant medications, concurre nt
illness, non- medicinal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], diagnostic tests, procedures or other confounding
effects
•Timing of the events between administration of the study treatment  and the AE
•Study treatment  blood levels and evidence, if any, of overdose
•De-challenge, that i s, if the study treatment  was discontinued or the dosage reduced,
what happened to the adverse reaction?
•Re-challenge, that is, what happened if the study treatment  was restarted after the AE
had resolved?

9.2.3. Recording Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Event s 
SAE and AE collection and monitoring will commence at the time the subject gives their written 
consent to participate in the trial. The collection and monitoring of SAE and AE will continue until [ADDRESS_989921] also be reported 
to the sponsor or sponsor’s designee as described in Section  9.2.6. 
The investigator is responsible for evaluating all AEs, obtaining supporting source documents, 
and determining that documentation of the event is adequate. The investigator may delegate 
these duties to sub -investigators and must ensure that these sub- investigators are qualified to 
perform these duties under the supervision of the investigator and that they are listed in the 
delegation log. 
9.2.4. Assessment of Severity  
Adverse event severity will be assessed according to Version 5.0 of the NCI -CTCAE. If the AE 
is not listed in the NCI -CTCAE, the investigator should assess causality according to the 
guidance as follows:  
Severity  Description  
Grade 1 – Mild  Asymptomatic or  mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated 
Grade 2 – Moderate  Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)  
Grade 3 – Severe Medically significant but not immediately life threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self -care ADL  
Grade 4 – Life-threatening  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
Grade 5 – Fatal  Death  
9.2.5. Reporting Adverse Events  
All AEs, including SAEs must be promptly documented on the eCRF  (or backup SAE form if 
necessary) . All concomitant medicatio ns, including herbal medications and supplements must be 
recorded. Any therapy used to treat the event must be recorded. The SAE s will be reconciled 
with the safety database during and at the end of the trial. The sponsor or sponsor’s designee will 
review the safety data from both the safety and the clinical database , as needed. Details of the 
event must include severity, relationship to study treatment, dates of occurrence, action taken, 
and outcome. Whenever possible, reporting specific diagnosis is preferred when reporting AEs 
rather than reporting individual signs and symptoms.  
Any change in the severity of an AE will be recorded as a new separate event. All AEs that are 
considered related to the study treatment  and all SAEs regardless of relationship to  the study 
treatment must be followed to resolution or stabilization if improvement is not expected. Adverse 
events which completely resolve and then recur should be recorded as a new AE. For subjects 
who complete the S afety Follow -up visit less than [ADDRESS_989922] dose of study 

SRA‑ MMB‑301  
94 of 134 momelotinib / danazol  Version 2.0 (18-D EC-2020) 
 
treatment, a follow up of ongoing AEs should be attempted by [CONTACT_725298]’s source file. Adverse events continuing at [ADDRESS_989923] be reported to the sponsor (or designee)  immediately . 
Serious AEs should be documented on the eCRF or  backup SAE form if the eCRF is 
unavailable, using the completion guidelines provided.  
If necessary, backup SAE report forms should be submitted using the contact [CONTACT_31307]:

Each epi[INVESTIGATOR_725216]. The NCI -CTCAE v 5.[ADDRESS_989924] be 
used to grade the severity of each SAE. If new or amended information on a previously reported SAE becomes available, the investigator should report this to the sponsor (or designee) immediately  on becoming aware of the new information.  
Requested follow -up information should be reported to the sponsor  (or designee) as soon as 
possible . Should the investigator become aware of any drug- related SAEs at any time after the 
subject discontinues study treatment, these must also be reported to the sponsor immediately, 
using an SAE form if the eCRF is no longer available .  
If required by [CONTACT_427], SAEs must also be reported on an expedited basis to the 
IRB/IEC  of the investigational site . 
9.2.7. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
All SAEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_725299], causality and expectedness. Expectedness will be  determined with  reference to the reference safety information (RSI ) 
specified in the current IB for MMB and the current  US package insert  for DAN. In the event the 
reference source documents are updated or modified during the course of the study, the new approved documents  will be provided to sites by [CONTACT_941] s ponsor  and the protocol references will be 
updated as a non- substantial amendment . The US  package insert (2018 ) for DAN is provided for 
reference in Appendix 7 as the RSI.  
The trial sponsor is required to expedite reports to relevant regulatory authorities relating to suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs)  consistent with relevant le gislation or 
regulations and other country- specific legislation or regulations as applicable.  
9.2.8. Urgent Safety Measures 
The sponsor/sponsor’s designee or investigator may take appropriate urgent safety measures (USMs) in order to protect the subjects of a clinical trial against any immediate hazard to their 

SRA‑ MMB‑301  
95 of 134 momelotinib / danazol  Version 2.0 (18-D EC-2020) 
 
health or safety. This includes procedures taken to protect subjects from pandemics or infections 
that pose serious risk to human health. 
USMs may be taken without prior authorization from the competent authority. 
Should the site initiate a USM, the investigator must inform the sponsor or sponsor’s designee 
immediately e ither by:  
[CONTACT_725300]:  
Americas:  
Europe, Asia , and Pacific  
Email:  Email: 
 
The notification must include: 
•description of the USMs taken
•the date of the USM
•who took the decision
•why action was taken
The sponsor or sponsor’s designee will then notify the applicable regulatory authority(ies) and the applicable IRB/IEC  s within the required timeframes.  
9.2.9. Reporting Pregnancy  
Pregnancy occurring in a subject or a subject’s partner while enrolled in this clinical trial until 
[ADDRESS_989925] be reported to the sponsor’s designee Pharmacovigilance Department within 24 hours of 
the investigator, designee or site personnel learning of the event on a Pregnancy Reporting Form. 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to obtain consent for follow -up from the subject or the 
subject’s partner. The sponsor or sponsor’s designee Pharmacovigilance Department will 
follow -up all pregnancies for the pregnancy outcome via the investigator, using a Pregnancy 
Reporting Form.  
Any premature termination of pregnancy (eg, a spontaneous abortion, an induced therapeutic abortion due to complications or other medical reasons) must be reported immediately  as an 
SAE. The underlying medical reason for this procedure should be recorded as the AE term.   
A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE. Furthermore, any SAE occurring as an adverse pregnancy outcome post study must also be reported. 
The subject should receive appropriate monitoring and care until the conclusion of the 
pregnancy. The outcome should be reported using the pregnancy outcome report form. If the end of the pregnancy occurs after the study has been completed, the outcome should be reported 
directly to the study sponsor.  

SRA‑ MMB‑301  
96 of 134 momelotinib / danazol  Version 2.0 (18-D EC-2020) 
 
Pregnancies of female partners of male study subjects exposed to the study drug must also be 
reported and relevant information should be submitted using the pregnancy and pregnancy outcome forms within 24 hours. If the end of the pregnancy occurs after the study has been 
completed, the outcome should be reported directly the study sponsor.  
Refer to Appendix 4 for Pregnancy Precautions, Definition for Female of Childbearing Potential, 
and Contraceptive  Recommendations.  
10. PHARMACOKINETIC ASSESSMENTS
Trough blood samples for PK analysis will be collected pre -dose and at  the Week 8, 16, and 24 
visits . Subjects should be instructed to refrain from taking  study medication prior to collection of 
the PK sample on these occasions. Samples are to be stored centrally for later analysis.  Details of 
sample processing and collection a re provided in the SRA -MMB -301 laboratory manual . 
11. EXPLORATORY ASSESSMENTS
Blood s amples will be collected at the timepoints shown in the  Schedule of Events  (Table  7) and 
stored centrally for future batched analysis  including mutational analysis via next -generation 
sequencing (NGS). Collection of these samples will be omitted in jurisdictions where collection 
of samples for this purpose is prohibited.  
Mutational analysis may include examination of JAK2, MPL, CALR mutational status and other 
somatic mutations typi[INVESTIGATOR_725217]/or trials of MF therapy. Analysis will be  
carried out to examine prognostic and predictive potential  of alterations  in such genes .  
Details of sa mple processing and collection a re provided in the SRA -MMB -301 laboratory 
manual. 
12. STATISTICS
12.1. Statistical Analysis Plan
The full statistical methods will be detailed in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be finalized prior to the database lock. Any deviations from the SAP will be discussed  in the 
Clinical Study Report  (CSR) . 
12.2. Analysis Sets 
The following analysis sets will be defined for the statistical analysis:  
•The intent- to-treat (ITT) analysis set  includes all randomized subjects in the treatme nt
arm to which they were allocated.
•The Per Protocol (PP) a nalysis set  consists of randomized subjects who do not have any
major protocol violation and received at least one dose of study drug. Study treatment

SRA‑ MMB‑301  
97 of 134 momelotinib / danazol  Version 2.0 (18-D EC-2020) 
 
assignment will be designated according to t he actual treatment received . The definition 
of “major protocol violation” will be specified in the SAP.  
•The safety analysis set consists of all subjects who received at least one dose of study
drug. Study treatment assignment will be designated according to the actual treatment
received.
The ITT analysis set  will be used for all analyses of efficacy and baseline characteristics. The PP 
analysis set  will be used as a sensitivity analysis for efficacy endpoints. The safety analysis set  
will be used for safety analyses.  
12.3. Sample Size Justification  
The study is powered to detect with a 2- sided α of 0.05 and randomization ratio 2:1 in favor of 
MMB a clinically relevant, statistically significant improvement in TSS response rate of 23% compared to 2% with DAN, in TI status of 45% compared to 21%, and in SRR of 15% compared 
to 1% in the proposed population. The sample size of 180 has a power of 98.8% to detect a 
difference of 21% in TSS and a power of 90% to detect a difference of 15% (17% versus 2%). To rea ch a power of 90% to detect a difference of 24% in TI status and a  difference of 14% in 
SRR, the number of subjects required is also equal to 180.  
12.4. Description of Statistical Methods  
12.4.1. General Analytical Considerations  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Enrollment 
Based on projected recruitm ent rates,  [ADDRESS_989926] survival and safety data, as described in Section  3.1. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Other Items 
Unless specified otherwise, computations will not impute data for missing values.  
Missing data in time -to-event will be censored at date of last visit unless specified otherwise.  
12.4.2. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
Minimization will be used to assign eligible subjects in a 2:1 ratio to receive MMB plus DAN 
placebo  : DAN plus MMB placebo. Minimization is a  dynam ic randomization technique 
designed to reduce imbalances of prognostic factors between treatment arms  for baseline 
variables including: MFSAF TSS baseline score, baseline spleen length , baseline RBC units 
transfused , and investigational site . No treatment allocations will be deterministic .  
12.4.3. Analysis of Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Descriptive statistics with respect to subject characteristics at baseline will be displayed for the 
ITT and the safety  analysis set , both by [CONTACT_6654]. A summary of key 

SRA‑ MMB‑301  
98 of 134 momelotinib / danazol  Version 2.0 (18-D EC-2020) 
 
demographic data and also a listing presenting demographic and baseline data per subject will be 
presented.  
12.4.4. General Analytical Considerations for Efficacy and Safety Analyses 
Details of the planned analyses will be described in a SAP . Any deviations from the SAP will be 
justified in the clinical study report.  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for selected demographic s and safety by [CONTACT_725301]. Descriptive statistics on continuous data will include means, medians, 
standard deviations, and ranges, while categorical data will be summarized using frequency 
counts and percentages. Graphical summaries of the data may also be presented.  
One-sided tests will be used at a significance level equal to 0.025. Two -sided tests will be used at 
a significance level equal to 0.05. Two- sided confidence intervals (CI) will be computed for a 
coverage of 0.95.  
Binary outcomes will be described by [CONTACT_725236] a 
Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by [CONTACT_725240] (≥  22 versus  < 22), 
baseline palpable spleen length below the LCM  (≥ 12 cm versus  < 12 cm) , and baseline RBC 
units transfused in the 8- week period prior to Randomization  (0, 1- 4, and 5+) .  
Time to event outcomes (“survival times”) will be described by [CONTACT_725302]-
Meier method. Subjects who have not had the event of interest at the time of the analysis will be 
censored at the time of the last follow up. Summary statistics will be provided by [CONTACT_725303], median and 95% CI and survival probabilities at specific time 
points (such as 1 year, 2 years, etc.). Survival curves will be plotted by [CONTACT_725239] a log- rank test stratified by [CONTACT_725240], baseline spleen length , and 
baseline RBC units transfused. A stratified Cox regression model will be used to estimate the hazard ratio and its 95% CI, as well as to adjust the comparison for baseline covariates.  
Additional details on analysis of secondary and exploratory endpoints will be provided in the 
SAP. A separate pre- specified health -related QoL analysis following US Food and Drug 
Administration ( FDA)  and E uropean Medicines Agency (EMEA)  PRO guidelines will be 
performed and detailed in a separate SAP and health -related QoL  report.  
12.4.5. Analysis of Primary  and Key Secondary Endpoints  and Sequential Testing  
Only in the case that the primary endpoint of MFSAF TSS response meets statistical significance 
in the primary superiority analysis, the key secondary endpoints will be  tested sequentially. The 
order of secondary endpoint testing will be first non -inferiority in the proportion of subjects with 
TI status at the end of Week 24, and if significance  is reached for this  endpoint then the p- value 
associated with the test of superiority  will also be calculat ed. If non- inferiority in TI status is 
reached, superiority of SRR will be tested. If superiority of SRR is reached, next the MMRM 
analysis of change from baseline in MFSAF TSS  will be conducted. If superiority is achieved for 
change from baseline in MFSAF  TSS, the proportion of subjects with no transfusions during first 
24 weeks will be tested for superiority. Only in the case the primary and key secondary 
endpoints as described above meet statistical significance at the primary analysis, additional 
second ary endpoints will be tested sequentially as described in the SAP .

[IP_ADDRESS]. Analysis of Patient Reported Outcomes (Primary E ndpoint)  
TSS response at Week 24 is the primary study endpoint. The MFSAF TSS response rate is 
defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve a ≥ 50% reduction in MFSAF TSS over the 
[ADDRESS_989927], stratified by [CONTACT_725304], baseline spleen length, and baseline RBC units transfused, on the ITT analysis set .  
In accordance with the prohibition of non- study active anti -MF therapy, subjec ts receiving 
restricted treatments  considered to be active anti -MF therapy as defined in Section  5.3.3, may  be 
set to non- responder for MFSAF TSS response at Week 24 following medical review . 
Sensitivity analyses will be described in the SAP and will include analyses on the PP analysis set. 
Baseli ne MFSAF TSS: Average of the daily MFSAF TSS for the period of 7 consecutive days 
(Days BL1 to BL7) prior to Randomization. If more than 3 da ily TSS results  are missing, the 
baseline score will be considered missing . 
TSS at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24: Average of the daily MFSAF TSS from a period of  28 
consecutive days prior to the end of each week considered. If fewer  than 20 daily measurements 
out of 28 are available, TSS will be set to missing for the timepoint considered.  
TSS will be analyzed for the difference in mean change TSS from baseline (secondary endpoint) 
using a repeated measures model for the outcome change from baseline, using all available 
summary data (ie, summarized for each 4- week period) of the ITT analysis set .  
The duration of the Week 24 TSS response , assessed to the end of Week 48 , will also be 
analyzed (secondary endpoint). Duration of TSS response is defined as the number of days f rom 
the first day  of the initial 28- day period in which a subject has a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline 
TSS to the first day of the 28- day period during which the subject’s TSS equals or exceeds their 
baseline value . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Analysis of TI status at Week 24 (Key Sec ondary Endpoint)  
The proportion of subjects who have TI status in the terminal [ADDRESS_989928], stratified by [CONTACT_725240], baseline 
spleen length, and baseline RBC units transfused.  
For the analysis of the key- secondary endpoint TI status, non -inferiority of MMB will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_725241] 80% of that in the D AN arm. If 
non-inferiority is concluded and in addition the entire 95% CI for the comparison also excludes 
zero, then the p- value associated with the test of superiority will also be calculated. The 80% of 
DAN response threshold represents a margin of approximately 4 percentage points under the expected DAN response rate of 21%. The expected response rate for DAN is based on available 
clinical literature for DAN treatment in MF with consideration of the patient population to be 
enrolled in this study. 
In acco rdance with the prohibition of non- study active anti -MF therapy, patients receiving other 
active MF therapy , as defined in Section 5.3.3, during the Ran domized Treatment Period will be 

SRA‑ MMB‑301  
100 of 134 momelotinib / danazol  Version 2.0 (18-D EC-2020) 
 
set to non- TI for TI status at Week 24. Subjec ts without TI -status at Week 24 will be set to non -
TI. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Analysis of S plenic R esponse Rate at Week 24 ( Key Secondary E ndpoint ) 
Splenic response rate (SRR),  is defined as the proportion of subjects who have splenic response 
(reduction in spleen volume of ≥ 35% from baseline) at the end of Week 24. A nalysis of splenic 
response will be performed on the ITT analysis set using a CMH test, stratified by [CONTACT_725230], baseline spleen length , and baseline RBC units transfused.  
In accordance with the prohibition of non- study active anti -MF therapy, subjec ts receiving 
restricted treatments considered to be active anti -MF therapy as defined in Section 5.3.3, may be 
set to non- responder for SRR response at Week 24 following medical review . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Analysis of RBC Units T ransfused  
Kaplan -Meier methods will be used to estimate the proportion of subjects in each treatment 
group who have zero units transfused in the first [ADDRESS_989929] unit 
transfused. 
The following will be estimated and examined; the proportion of subjects with ≥ 1 unit 
transfused, the proportion of subjects with ≥  [ADDRESS_989930] of missing data will be 
described in the SAP.  
•For the primary endpoint  of MFSAF TSS response rate at Week  24, subjects with a
missing assessment of post-randomization TSS response  at Week 24 will be considered
as a non -responder. For calculation of mean TSS (eg, at baseline), if more than 3 daily
TSS results are missing  from the 7 -day assessment period , the score will be considered
missing.
•For the key secondary endpoint of TI status at Week 24, s ubjects without TI -status at
Week 24 will be set to non- TI.
•For the key secondary endpoint of SRR at Week 24, subjects with missing splenicresponse at Week [ADDRESS_989931] plus 30 days will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_1570] (according to the investigational medicinal product received).

[IP_ADDRESS]. Extent of Exposure 
Descriptive information will be provided by [CONTACT_725305]  (MMB/placebo and DAN/ placebo) prescribed, the total number of doses taken, 
the percent of expected doses taken, the number of days of study treatment , and the number and 
timing of prescribed dose modification and interruptions.  
Compliance will be described by [CONTACT_725306] t counts relative to the amount that was dispensed 
(taking into account physician- prescribed modification and interruptions).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events  
All AEs will be listed. The focus of AE summarization will be on treatment- emergent AEs. A 
treatment- emergent AE is defined as an AE that occurs or worsens in the period from the first 
dose of study treatment (MMB/placebo or DAN/placebo) to [ADDRESS_989932] dose of study treatment, or any AEs leading to premature discontinuation of study treatment.  
AEs will be classified using MedDRA (http://www.meddramsso.com) with descriptions by 
[CONTACT_1196], High- Level Group Term, High- Level Term, Preferred Term, and Lower -
Level Term. The severity of AEs will be graded by [CONTACT_178993] 
(CTCAE v5.0, 2017), whenever possible. If a CTCAE criterion does not exist for a specific type 
of AE, the grade corresponding to the appropriate adjective will be used by [CONTACT_725307]: Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate), Grade 3 (severe), Grade 4 (life threatening), or Grade 5 ( fatal). The relationship of the AE to the study 
treatment will be categorized as related or unrelated. 
Treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_2939]. Summary tables will be 
presented to show the number of subjects reporting treatment -emergent AEs by [CONTACT_725308]. A subject who reports multiple treatmen t-emergent AEs within 
the same Preferred Term (or System Organ Class) is counted only once for that Preferred Term (or System Organ Class) using the worst severity grade. AE descriptions will be presented by 
[CONTACT_651449] a given System Organ Cl ass and Preferred Term.  
Separate listings and summaries will be prepared for the following types of treatment emergent 
AEs:  
•Study- drug- related AEs
•AEs that are Grade ≥ 3 in severity
•AEs leading to study treatment  interruption and/or dose modification
•AEs leading to study treatment  discontinuation
•AEs in the 30 days following treatment discontinuation
•SAEs
•Deaths
•Separate listings and summaries will be prepared for Open -label Extended Treatment

13. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/ DOCUMENTS
13.1. Trial Monitoring
In accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), the trial monitor must have direct access to the 
investigator’s source documentation to verify the data recorded in the eCRFs. The investigator 
agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected during these 
monitoring visits are adequately resolved. In extenuating circumstances, such as during the 
COVID- [ADDRESS_989933], suitably controlled remote access to patie nts’ 
electronic medical records may be used for data monitoring (according to local regulations and 
guidelines).  
Before a n investigational site  can enter a subject into the trial, a representative of the sponsor 
will: 
•Determine the adequacy of the faciliti es and resources.
•Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard toprotocol adherence, and the responsibilities of the sponsor or its representatives. This willbe documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between the sponsor and the investigator.
During the trial, a monitor from the sponsor or representative will have regular contacts with the investigational site, for the following:  
•Provide information and support to the investigator(s).
•Confirm that facilities and resources  remain acceptable.
•Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are beingaccurately recorded in the CRF/eCRF , and that investigational product accountability
checks are being performed.
•Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in theCRF/eCRF  with the subject’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and other
records relevant to the trial.
•Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to the sponsor.
•Confirm A Es and SAEs have been properly documented on CRFs and confirm any SAEs
have been forwarded to the sponsor and those SAEs that met criteria for reporting havebeen forwarded to the IRB /IEC .
The representatives of the sponsor or the designee will be available between visits if the

Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements.  
15.3. Written Informed Consent 
The i nvestigator will ensure that the subject is given full and adequate oral and written 
information about the nature, purpose, possible risks and benefits of the trial. The information that is given shall be in a language understandable to the subject . Subjects must also be notified 
that they are free to discontinue from the trial at any time. The subject should be given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information provided.  
The subject ’s signed and dated informed consent must be obtained before conducting any trial 
procedures.  
The i nvestigator must maintain the original, signed ICF . A copy of the signed ICF must be given 
to the subject . Subject s will be reconsented when new information becomes available that may 
impact their willingness to continue participation.  
The sponsor or its designated representative will provide the investigator with a sample ICF . Any 
site-specific changes to the ICF must be submitted to the sponsor or its designated representative 
for approval, prior to submission to the IRB/EC. The IRB/EC  will review the ICF for approval. 
A copy of the approved form must be submitted to the sponsor or its designated representative for its approval prior to initiation of the trial.  
16. DATA HANDLING AND R ECORDKEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]
16.1. Inspection of Records
The sponsor or representative will be allowed to conduct site visits to the investigation facilities 
for the purpose of monitoring any aspect of the trial. The investigator agrees to allow the monitor 
to inspect the drug storage area, trial drug stocks, drug accountability rec ords, subject charts and 
trial source documents, and other records relative to trial conduct.  
16.2. Retention of Records 
The medical files of trial subjects shall be retained in accordance with national legislation and in 
accordance with the maximum period of time permitted by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_307], institution or private

APPENDIX 4. CONTRACEPTIVE GUIDANCE FOR WOMEN OF 
CHILDBEARING POTENTIAL (WOCBP) AND MALE PARTNER OF WOCBP  
1)Pregnancy and Contraception Requirements for Males and Females of Childbearing
Potential
The risks of treatment with momelotinib (MMB) during pregnancy have not been evaluated. 
Data available at this time suggest that this drug does not have a drug- drug interaction (DDI) 
with hormones used for contraception. Please refer to the latest version of the IB  for additional 
information. 
Please refer to the regional prescribing information for information  on the potential risks of 
treatment with danazol (DAN)  during pregnancy. The summary of product characteristics for 
DAN is provided in the pharmacy binder in countries where there is no approved prescribing 
information.  
2)Definition of Female of Childbearing Potential
For the purposes of this study, a female subject of childbearing potential is a woman who has not 
had a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or medically documented ovarian failure. This 
definition includes pubertal females regardless of whether or not she has had a menses (premenarchal, Tanner Stage 3) and perimenopausal women who have had a spontaneous 
menses in the last 12 months. A woman who has had a tubal sterilization is considered to be of 
childbearing potential.  
•Women ≤ [ADDRESS_989937] omy, bilateral
oophorectomy, or medically documented ovarian failure.
•Women > 54 years of age with cessation (for ≥12 months) of previously occurringmenses due to ovarian failure will not be considered to be of childbearing potential.

SRA‑ MMB‑301  
116 of 134 momelotinib / danazol  Version 2.0 (18-D EC-2020) 
 
3)Contraceptive Requirements for Females
Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use protocol specified method(s) of 
contraception from the S creening/enrollment visit throughout the study period and for [ADDRESS_989938] dose of study treatment or c hoose continuous heterosexual abstinence as a 
lifestyle choice. The investigator should counsel subjects on the protocol specified method(s) for avoiding pregnancy during the study. Hormonal methods of contraception are prohibited due to 
the risk of intera ctions with DAN. These methods are recommended due to the low failure rate 
(ie, less than 1% per year):   
Single Methods:  
•Intrauterine devices (IUDs)
−Copper T 380A IUD
•Tubal sterilization.  If tubal sterilization is via the Essure procedure, verification of
tubal blockage by [CONTACT_31084][INVESTIGATOR_8913] (HSP) must be performed approximately 3
months after microinsertion. Prior to verification, Essure is not considered a reliableform of contraception and another contraception method described above should be
used.
•Vasectomy with documented azoospermia 3 months after the procedure
Barrier methods:  
•Acceptable methods must include diaphragm (with spermicide) in combination with
the male condom. In jurisdictions where these acceptable barrier methods are notavailable, other acceptable methods  must be used as described  above .
Female study subjects who are not heterosexually active must have periodic confirmation of continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse and regular pregnancy testing while taking IP. The investigator should counsel subjects on the protocol specified method(s) for avoiding 
pregnancy in case the subject chooses to engage in heterosexual intercourse. 
Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at 
Screening and a negative urine pregnancy test at baseline prior to receiving the first dose of IP. 
Lactating females must discontinue nursing before study treatment admi nistration.  
4)Contraceptive Requirements for Males
Male subjects must agree to use condoms and avoid sperm donation from the 
Screening/enrollment visit throughout the study period and for [ADDRESS_989939] dose of study treatment . 
5)Procedures to be Followed in the Event of Pregnancy
Subjects should be instructed to notify the investigator if they become pregnant at any time 
during the study, or if they become pregnant within [ADDRESS_989940] 
report the information to the investigator and discontinue study treatment immediately. The 
investigator , designee or site personnel  should report all pregnancies to the sponsor’s designee 
Pharmacovigilance Department using the pregnancy report form within 24 hours of becoming 

SRA‑ MMB‑301  
117 of 134 momelotinib / danazol  Version 2.0 (18-D EC-2020) 
 
aware of the pregnancy. The investigator should counsel the subject regarding the possible 
effects of prior study treatment  exposure on the fetus and the need to inform the study site of the 
outcome of the pregnancy. Subjects whose partner has become pregnant or suspects she is 
pregnant during the study must report the information to the investigator.  
Instructions  for reporting pregnancy, partner pregnancy, and pregnancy outcome are outlined 
in Section  9.2.9

 ADDENDUM: GUIDANCE ON TEMPORARY PROCEDURES DURING 
THE COVID -19 PANDEMIC 
To reduce risks to study subjects and burden on healthcare facilities associated with continued 
study participation during the COVID -19 pandemic, study visit procedures may be modified due 
to COVID- 19 restrictions as defined in this protocol addendum. The temporary modifications 
will include allowance for study visits to be conducted by [CONTACT_65859] (or similar connection) between site staff and the study subject at home and laboratory assessments (including imaging) 
to be performed at a n alternative facility eg,  a local/primary care site. These procedures are to be 
used only as needed during disruption resulting from COVID -19. The time period(s) these 
modified procedures are used will be in accordance with any health authority guidance and documented in communication with the Sponsor.  
Rationale for Modification of Study Procedures 
In order to maximize subject safety and minimize loss of data critical to study endpoints, s ubjects 
should be encouraged to visit the site for usual visits whenever possible . However, physical visits 
to the investigational site may temporarily be replaced by [CONTACT_725313]. As described in this 
addendum, the study objectives can be achieved by [CONTACT_725314], telephone call (or similar connection) between site staff and the study subject or visit to an alternative facility without 
requiring the subject to phys ically visit the study site.  
Remote visit procedure s are not intended to permanently eliminate the need for physical visits. 
The modified procedures will only be applied when appropriate, considering the safety and 
health status of the subject, and in consultation with the Sierra Medical Monitor or Chief Medical 
Officer (CMO).  
Screening and Enrollment  
The overall potential impact on data integrity and subject safety should be given careful 
consideration. Decisions regarding continuing screening and enrollm ent will be considered case 
by [CONTACT_725315]. Strong 
consideration should be given to delaying the screening of a subject if the risk assessment 
suggests the subject or the site is at high risk for not being able to comply with the protocol or 
the allowed alternative procedures . The following factors should be considered:  
•Increase or decrease in the  COVID- [ADDRESS_989965].
•As a minimum , a screening visit plus a combined baseline/first dose visit must be
performed at the study site.
•Feasibility of remote visits, including review of laboratory assessments conducted atalternative facility, adverse event (AE) and serious adverse event (SAE) review,release questionnaires for electronic patient reported outcomes (ePRO) excluding the
myelofibrosis symptom assessment form (MFSAF) questionnaire, discussion of
concomitant medications, collection of narcotics log, collection of transfusion detail s,
and recording of healthcare visits.

SRA ‑MMB‑301  
momelotinib / danazol  Addendum to version 2.0 (18-D EC-2020) 2 of 5 
 •Ava
ilability of baseline and on- treatment spleen volume assessments (MRI or CT
scan, contrast not required) either at the study site or an alternative facility.
•Availability of alternative facility for laboratory testing (local or primary care facility)
for safety laboratory assessments and electrocardiogram (ECG). Note: there is a
necessity for regular liver function tests (LFTs) to monitor for potential danazoltoxicity and need for monitoring of Hgb and other laboratory abnormalities requiring
dose reduction. If the ECG is performed at an alternative facility, a copy must be
provided to the investigator for QTc interval check.
•Feasibility of entering laboratory results into the electronic data capture (EDC)
system in the absence of central laboratory assessment.
•If virtual visits on study are required, access to the study site or a primary care site in
the event of AEs that indicate a physical examination, potentially to include spleen
palpation or ultrasound.
•Changes to transfusion practice, eg, hemoglobin threshold to trigger a transfusion,
number of units transfused, since these will impact assessment of transfusion
dependence and independence.
•Changes to pharmacy staffing or procedures and ability to ship treatment directly to
subjects.
•Any other anticipated protocol deviations due to disruption related to COVID -19.
COVID- [ADDRESS_989966] results should be recorded in the EDC system, if available.  
Since “active uncontrolled infection” is excluded (Refer to protocol exclusion criteria 5), individuals with respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856] (eg, cough, shortness of breath)  and a positive COVID -[ADDRESS_989967] recovery, assessed on a case by [CONTACT_413]. Recovery is defined as resolution of fever without the use of fever -reducing medications and improvement in symptoms.  
If the Sponsor determines  collection of data required to evaluate the key study endpoints  is 
adversely affected by [CONTACT_4113] -19 (eg, due to early discontinuation of subjects  with COVID- 19 
infection), a similar number of additional subjects may be enrolled to a maximum of up to 30 
additional subjects.  

SRA ‑MMB‑301  
momelotinib / danazol  Addendum to version 2.0 (18-D EC-2020) [ADDRESS_989968]’s consent 
to these modified study procedures must be obtained. This consent may be obtained remotely  as 
described below:  
•The current, approved, site -specific informed consent form ( ICF) should be provided
to the subject electronically or via courier for their reference.  Once the subject has
received the ICF, re -consent should be obtained from the subject by [CONTACT_725316].
•Consent to modified study procedures must be obtai ned and documented prior to any
remote study visit, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_725218] a subject, or release of
study treatment  to an authorized third party.
•In addition to verbal consent, the appropriate ICF addendum signed at the subject’s
next visi t to the investigational site.
Critical Visit: Screening/Baseline  
As a minimum, a Screening visit plus a combined Baseline/first dose (Day 1) visit must be performed at the study site (Section 7.2  and Section 7.3). If study site facilities are not available, 
Baseline laboratory assessments including spleen volume (MRI or CT scan, contrast not 
required) may be performed at another facility with the capab ility to perform assessments 
according to study requirements . All screening data and stratification factors must be known 
prior to randomization.   
Site personnel must also monitor ePRO questionnaire completion by [CONTACT_725317] a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_989969] been completed and all necessary data from baseline assessments are available.  
Critical Visit: Week 24 Splenic Volume Assessment  
Assessments at the Week 24 visit include a spleen volume assessment ( MRI or CT scan, contrast 
not required) which is critical to the splenic response endpoint of the study (Section 8.3.2) . If it is 
not possible for a subject to attend the site for their scan, the scan may be performed at another 
imaging location. If a visit to any imaging location is not possible within +/ - 1 week of the Week 
24 timepoint, an increased visit window of +/ - [ADDRESS_989970] occur before open- label momelotinib (MMB ) can be provided  and the 
first dose of open- label MMB treatment requires observation at the study site, per protocol 
Section  3.5.2. 
Confirmation of splenic progression for the purpose of early cross -over to open- label MMB may 
be via a visit to an alternative facility for imaging, if it is not possible to perform the scan at the 
study site. If no imaging is possible, confirmation of s plenic progression on the  basis of palpable 
spleen may be considered in consultation with the Sierra Medical Monitor or CMO.

 Rem
ote Non -critical Study Visits  
Continued collection of data for critical study endpoints is at risk in the event of remote visits 
and every effort should be made to maintain collection of the following:  
•MFSAF questionnaire (Section 8.2.1 ) – site to continue to monitor and reinforce
compliance  in order t o identify worsening of symptoms, inability to take study
treatment, and/or non- compliance with assessments which may be due to COVID -19.
•Transfusion monitoring (Section  8.1.1) - regular Hgb monitoring should preserve the
integrity of the transfusion independence  endpoint even when transfusions are more
restricted , however, if central labs are not possible, remote labs are required.
•Spleen volume assessment (Section  8.3.2)  – scans from alternative facilities may not
be readable by [CONTACT_11343], so their use should be avoided wherepossi ble.
When planning remote study visits, an individual subject assessment should be made weighing 
pre-existing risk factors, how many assessments would be missed, and how long the patient has 
been on study. When visits to the study center are not possible, t he preferred alternative is for 
standard of care laboratory assessments, ECG, and physical examinations to be performed at a primary physician's office in addition to remote (telephone or similar connection) subject -PI 
[CONTACT_41995].  
If a visit to a primary physician is not an option, and there are no AEs or other issues that require a physical examination, then assessments are only collected through remote visit with the PI. In 
general, the following procedures will be completed during a remote study visit:  
•Recording the  occurrence of any AEs reported by [CONTACT_423].
•Pregnancy test results required according to the Schedule of Assessments  (Table  7)
should be reported to the site if performed locally/remotely .
•Remote study visits and testing should be recorded in the EDC system.
If a subject cannot visit local physician and/or does not  complete remote subject -PI [INVESTIGATOR_725219], the subject may be required to discontinue participation in the study. The Sierra Medical Monitor or CMO should be consulted 
in this case.  
Storage or Omi ssion of PK and Exploratory Blood Samples 
•Collection of blood samples for pharmacokinetic evaluation (Section 10 ) and
exploratory analyses (Section 11 ) may be omitted when remote visits are required,
unless they can be collected using central laboratory kits and stored at the site.
•If possible, samples can be frozen and stored at site until they can be provided to the
central laboratory.
Shipment of Study Treatment  to Subjects  
If a subject is unable to attend site visits, study treatment may be shipped directly as described below or pi[INVESTIGATOR_725220], as permitted 

SRA ‑MMB‑301  
momelotinib / danazol  Addendum to version 2.0 (18-D EC-2020) [ADDRESS_989971]’s consent.  
•If permitted by [CONTACT_5277], shippi[INVESTIGATOR_110483] a recognized courier company is
advised. In absence of the ability to use a courier company, study site personnel may
deliver study treatment.
•The shippi[INVESTIGATOR_725221], or standard operating procedure ( SOP) if available,
should be filed in the Pharmacy Binder.
•No temperature monitoring is required since the risk and impact of temperature
excursions is low.
•Normal dispensing activities sho uld be completed prior to shippi[INVESTIGATOR_262] ,
including data entry of bottle numbers into the EDC system.
•A log of the bottle numbers shipped to subjects, courier tracking numbers, and hardcopy printed confirmation of delivery notifications should be kept.
•Study treatment accountability will be recorded during remote study visits.
Study Treatment  Accountability  
If study treatment was shipped directly to the subject or pi[INVESTIGATOR_725222], the following will be completed during a remote study visit:  
•The subject will confirm whether the correct bottles of study treatment  were received
sealed, without sign of tampering.
•Subjects should be advised to keep all used bottles in a plastic bag and return them at
their next visit to the investigational site.
•Subjects should be reminded that all medication is to be kept in the original
packaging, at room temperature and out of reach of children.
•Confirm the number of tablets taken and the number remaining in each bottle.
•Review any changes in dosage or administration instructions, if applicable.
Emergency Taper in Case of Study Treatment Unavai lability  
Emergency taper of study treatment similar to treatment taper at discontinuation may be required 
if access to study treatment is interrupted due to factors such as shippi[INVESTIGATOR_725223]. In this case, subjects should be instructed to taper their treatment once only [ADDRESS_989972] and therefore sites 
should suspend enrollment of new subjects in consultation with the Sierra Medical Monitor or 
CMO if they are aware of possible supply issue.

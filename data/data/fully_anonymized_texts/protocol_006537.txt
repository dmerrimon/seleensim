 1. Introduction 
Hemophilia B, or Christmas disease, is a rare congenital bleeding disorder characterized by 
[CONTACT_456805] (FIX).  Individuals with hemophilia B often 
experience mild-to-severe bleeding complications and it can be life-threatening if not 
treated appropriately.  There is no available cure for hemophilia B. Prophylaxis, with 
regular infusion of FIX concentrates, is now the mainstay of hemophilia care to resolve 
bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (epi[INVESTIGATOR_71232]) or prevention of bleeding (prophylaxis treatment) 
(Roberts and Eberst 1993; Srivastava et al. 2012; National Hemophilia Foundation 2007). 
 
Over the past two decades, a series of preclinical and early-phase clinical studies on gene 
transfer for hemophilia have demonstrated a good safety profile using adeno-associated 
viral (AAV) for hemophilia B.  Recent success reported by [CONTACT_456806]., (2011 and 
2014) of sustained long-term expression (up to 6 years) of therapeutic levels of FIX 
between 2% and 6% activity levels in subjects with severe hemophilia B using AAV 
serotype 8 (AAV8) liver-directed gene transfer further validated the potential of gene 
transfer technology.  
 
PF-06838435 is an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector expressing the human factor IX-
Padua (hFIX-Padua) variant.  PF-[ADDRESS_583706] time to 
humans; however, AAV vectors have been administered to humans in more than 100 gene 
therapy clinical trials for a wide range of indications, including hemophilia B (Nathwani et 
al. 2014; Buchlis et al. 2012; Mingozzi and High 2013; Mingozzi and High 2011b; High 
and Aubourg 2011). 
 
Protocol number was changed to C0371005 (formerly SPK-9001-101) after Investigational 
New Drug (IND) transfer from Spark Therapeutics to [COMPANY_007] Inc on July 11, 2018. 
 
2. Objectives 
2.1. Primary and Secondary Objectives 
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single 
intravenous infusion of PF-06838435 in hemophilia B subjects ≥18 years of age with ≤2 
IU/dL [≤2 %] endogenous factor IX [FIX]). The secondary objective is to characterize the 
kinetics of PF-06838435. 
 
3. Investigational Plan 
3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a Phase 1/2a, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation and multi-center study 
to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and kinetics of a single intravenous infusion of PF-
06838435  in hemophilia B subjects with ≤2IU/dL [≤2%] endogenous factor IX [FIX]). 
[COMPANY_007] Inc   Statistical Analysis Plan, Version 4.0
  
C0371005  Date Issued: 01November2019   
8 
 Approximately 15 evaluable subjects will be dosed with a single  intravenous infusion of 
PF-06838435 at one of three different dose levels.  Subjects will provide informed consent and then undergo screeni ng assessments up to 6 
(±2) weeks prior to PF-06838435 infusion on the Dosing Day (Day  0). All dosed subjects 
will undergo safety observation for a total of 52 (±2) weeks af ter PF-06838435  
infusion(see the Schedule of Events). Subjects who complete 52 (±2) weeks (End-of-
Study) will be encouraged to enroll in an extension study evalu ating the long-term safety 
of PF-06838435 for up to an additional 5-year long-term follow- up (LTFU). 
 The administration of PF-[ADDRESS_583707] two (2) weeks to ensure safety. Additi onally, at least eight weeks 
of safety data from at least three (3) out of five (5) subjects  in a given dose level will 
undergo review by [CONTACT_23275] (DMC ) prior to dosing the 
first subject in the next dose level.   
There will be no  dose escalation if at least three (3) subjects in any dose leve l achieve steady-
state vector-derived FIX activity levels of ≥40%. Steady-state levels are based on an average of 
vector-derived FIX:C activity level measurements starting from Week 12 with adequate 
washout (i.e., 96 hours for pd- or r-FIX and up to 168 hours fo r extended half-life rFIX) from 
FIX product.  
 
Originally, up to five (5) evaluable subjects may be dosed in e ach dose level. An initial 
dose level may be expanded up to ten (10) evaluable subjects if  at least three (3) out of five 
(5) subjects achieve detectable steady-state vector-derived FIX  activity levels above 5%. 
If, after the above initial dose-level expansion, at least six (6) out of ten (10) subjects 
achieve detectable steady-state vector-derived FIX activity lev els above 5%, then further 
dose level expansion of up to ten (10) additional evaluable sub jects would be allowed (a 
total of up to twenty evaluable subjects at the starting dose l evel of 5 x1011 vg/kg).  
 
The decision to dose escalate will require the agreement of the  Sponsor and the DMC.

4. General Statistical Considerations 
In general, the following rules will be followed for all applicable analyses contained in this 
analysis plan, unless otherwise specified. Analysis populations used in specific analyses 
will be noted in the tables/listings.  
 
Continuous variables  will be summarized using descriptive statistics including: the 
number of non-missing values, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and 
maximum. Means and medians will be presented to one decimal place beyond that which 
the data was captured. Standard deviations (SD) will be presented to two decimal places 
beyond that which the data was captured. Minimum and maximum will be displayed to the 
same number of decimal places as that which the data was captured. In case of non-
normally distributed variables (such as some laboratory parameters), the geometric mean 
may be calculated.  
 
Categorical variables  will be summarized by [CONTACT_48361]. All percentages will 
be rounded to the nearest integer. The percentage will be suppressed when the count is 
zero. Unless otherwise specified, the denominator for all percentages will be the number of 
subjects in each treatment arm with non-missing data for a given summarization. 
  
Baseline  will be defined as the last non-missing measurement (that can be used for data 
analysis) taken prior to PF-06838435 infusion. 
 
Study day , that is the start/stop date of an event,  will be calculated as (date of event – first 
PF-06838435 infusion date) if event date is prior to PF-06838435 infusion date; Study Day 
will be calculated as (date of event – first PF-06838435 infusion date+1) if event date is on 
or after PF-06838435 infusion date. 
 
Unscheduled visits will not be included in table summaries but will be included in the data 
listings.

9. Safety Analysis 
All safety analyses will be conducted using the safety analysis  set.  
9.1. Adverse Events 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward, undesired, or unplanned medical occurrence in the 
form of any unfavorable and unintended sign (including clinical ly significant abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study 
drug, regardless of causal relationship, occurring in a subject  participating in a clinical 
study. In this study, bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_286109],  but bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_456803] (SAEs). Adverse 
events will be classified using the Medical Dictionary for Regu latory Activities 
(MedDRA) System Organ Classes and Preferred Terms.  MedDRA vers ion 18.0 will be 
used through-out the study.    
An adverse event will be regarded as treatment emergent AE (TEA E) if the start date is on 
or after the infusion of PF-[ADDRESS_583717]’s last visit on study (or the date of 
withdrawal/the date of being lost to follow-up). We will use th e below algorithm to derive 
the start date for the determination of treatment emergence whe n start date is 
partially/completely missing and the original dates will be dis played in the listings: 
x If year is missing (or completely missing) then set to the PF-0 6838435 
infusion date  
x If (year is present, and month and day are missing  
o If year = year of PF-06838435 infusion date:  then set to the P F-
06838435 infusion date 
o If year < year of PF-06838435 infusion date: set month and day to 
December 31
st 
o If year > year of PF-06838435 infusion date: set month and day to 
January 1st 
x If month and year are present and day is missing: 
o If year = year of PF-06838435 infusion date, and: 
 month = month of PF-06838435 infusion date: set day to day 
of SPK-9001 infusion date 
 If month < month of PF-06838435 infusion date: set day to

9.1.1.  Incidence of Adverse Events 
All AEs, including SAEs, will be presented in data listings.  
 
Summaries of the total number of TEAEs, the number of subjects with at least one TEAE 
and the incidence will be presented by [CONTACT_7169]. The number of subjects, the number of 
events and the incidence will also be presented by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred 
term (PT). At each level of summarization, a subject is counted once if the subject reported 
one or more events.  
9.1.2.  Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug 
A summary of TEAEs by [CONTACT_456812] a 
table. The investigator will provide an assessment of the relationship of the event to the 
study drug. The possible relationships are “Not Related”, “Unlikely”, “Possible”, and 
“Related”. In the TEAE relationship table, if a subject reported multiple occurrences of the 
same TEAE, only the most closely related occurrence will be presented. TEAEs that are 
missing a relationship or with a relationship other than “Not Related” or “Unlikely” will be 
presented in the summary table as “Related” but will be presented in the data listing with a 
missing relationship or the actual relationship respectively. Percentages will be based on 
the number of subjects within each dose group in the safety analysis set. 
9.1.3.  Severity of Adverse Event 
A summary of TEAEs by [CONTACT_456813] a table. The severity 
that will be presented represents the most extreme severity captured on the case report 
form (CRF) page. The possible severities are “Mild”, “Moderate”, “Severe”, “Life-
threatening” and “Death”. In the TEAE severity table, if a subject reported multiple 
occurrences of the same TEAE, only the most severe will be presented. Treatment-
emergent AEs that are missing severity will be presented in tables as “Severe” but will be 
presented in the data listing with a missing severity. Percentages will be calculated out of 
the number of subjects within each dose group in the safety analysis set.  
9.1.4.  Toxicity Grade of Adverse Event 
A summary of TEAEs by [CONTACT_154429] (per protocol APPENDIX A3: TOXICITY 
SCALE) will be presented by [CONTACT_456814] a table. If a subject reported multiple 
occurrences of the same TEAE, only the highest grade will be presented. Treatment-
emergent AEs that are missing grade will be presented in tables as Grade 4 but will be 
presented in the data listing with a missing toxicity grade. Percentages will be calculated 
out of the number of subjects within each dose group in the safety analysis set.

events will be presented in a data listing. 
9.1.6.  Serious Adverse Events 
Any AE reported as resulting in death, immediate risk of death (life threatening), inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity, or a congenital/anomaly/birth defect will be classified as a serious 
adverse event (SAE).  An SAE may also be any other medically important event that, in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to 
prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. In addition, any suspected transmission via 
a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered an SAE. 
 
Serious treatment-emergent adverse events (SAEs) will be categorized and presented by 
[CONTACT_456814] a table by [CONTACT_382811] a manner similar to that described in Section 9.1.1. 
Treatment-emergent SAEs with relationship to study drug will also be presented in a table. 
A treatment-related treatment-emergent SAE is a treatment-emergent SAE with any 
relation to study drug other than “Not Related” or “Unlikely”. Treatment-emergent SAEs 
that are missing a relationship will be presented in the table as “Related” but will be 
presented in the data listing with a missing relationship. At each level of summarization, a 
subject is counted once if reporting one or more events. Percentages will be calculated out 
of the number of subjects within each dose group in the safety analysis set. 
9.1.7.  Death 
All subject deaths during the study will be listed. Deaths will be identified from the AE 
with “Outcome” recorded as “Fatal” on the AE eCRFs. 
9.2. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
For laboratory evaluations, baseline is defined as the last non-missing evaluable 
assessment taken prior to PF-[ADDRESS_583719]-baseline laboratory results are 
defined as any assessment taken after the infusion of PF-06838435.  
 
Laboratory assessments will be performed by a certified laboratory. All summaries will be 
based on the units provided by [CONTACT_2237], conversion for the local labs will be 
performed to make the units consistent with the central laboratory results. Summary tables 
will use central laboratory results. Both central and local results will be included in 
listings.  
 
Additional laboratory tests other than the tests listed below will be performed to assess the 
safety of the immunosuppressive therapy regimen, if implemented.

 Laboratory parameters of thrombotic potential in any individual who reaches >150% 
vector-derived FIX:C activity levels after PF-[ADDRESS_583720] baseline visits will be summarized by [CONTACT_456815] a data listing.  Number 
of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum will be 
presented for all change from baseline tables.   
 
Each subject’s laboratory values will be classified according to whether the test result is 
“low” (i.e., below the lower limit of normal [LLN]), “normal” (within the normal range), 
or “high” (i.e., above the upper limit of normal [ULN]). A shift table of minimum and 
maximum on-study records will be created by [CONTACT_456816]. Additionally, the 
abnormality categorical data will be summarized in this shift tables comparing the results 
at the end of study visit at Week 52 with those at the baseline visit.

will be summarized by [CONTACT_456817] a data listing.  Number of subjects (n), mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum will 
be presented for all change from baseline tables. Each subject’s laboratory values will be 
classified according to whether the test result is “low” (i.e., below the LLN), “normal” 
(within the normal range), or “high” (i.e., above the ULN]. The abnormality categorical 
data will be summarized in shift tables comparing the results at the end of study visit at 
Week 52, minimum post-baseline, and maximum post-baseline with those at the baseline 
visit.

Day 0 pre-vector infusion and EOS will also be included in this listing. 
9.4. Physical Examination 
A table will tabulate physical examination results by [CONTACT_456820]. At each visit CRF captures the status of a body system and any finding 
associated with the body system as normal, abnormal, or not done. The by-visit summary 
will include the number and percentage of subjects with each physical examination 
outcome for the following body systems: skin; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]; cardiovascular; gastrointestinal; endocrine/metabolic; genitourinary; 
neurological; blood/lymphatic; musculoskeletal; and other. This categorical data will also 
be summarized in a shift table comparing results at each post-baseline visit with baseline 
by [CONTACT_6764]. Physical examination results for all subjects will be presented in a listing.

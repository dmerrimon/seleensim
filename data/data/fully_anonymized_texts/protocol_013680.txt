Protocol 9713.00 
1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a difficult-to-treat malignancy, claiming 
approximately 10,000 lives each year in the U. S. alone [1-4]. Treatment improvements have 
been very gradual at best over the last two decades, and even with contemporary, intensive 
treatment regimens, only few patients will be alive 2-5 years after initial diagnosis [5, 6]. 
The majority of AML patients will require salvage therapy because of the high rates of failure 
to respond to initial therapy or relapse after standard remission induction therapy. Probably the 
most commonly used salvage regimen employs high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC). Patients with 
relapsed/refractory AML have poor outcomes. In patients who have relapsed within [ADDRESS_889041] primary refractory disease, the complete remission (CR) rate with 
HiDAC is only about 15% [7]; such patients represent the great majority presenting for salvage 
therapy. Given these poor results, the need for new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_658933]. 
Rationale for use of hypomethylating agents in AML  
Decitabine 20 mg/m2 has been given as a single agent typi[INVESTIGATOR_94954] 5-day cycles; CR rates 
in older newly diagnosed patients are about 25%.[8] Subsequently, several groups experimented 
with lengthening to 10-day cycles (also at 20 mg/m2 daily). Ritchie et al described with CR rates 
of 40% for newly diagnosed and 15.7% for relapsed / refractory patients, and other than 
hematologic / infectious toxicities, AEs were mild with no grade >2 events reported.[9] In fact, 
the authors even conclude by [CONTACT_658954] 10 days of decitabine suggests 
that this could be combined safely with other agents. Blum et al reported on decitabine 20 
mg/m2 daily for 10 days in 53 newly diagnosed patients and demonstrated a 47% CR rate; Non-
hematologic / infectious grade >2 toxicities were rare, including fatigue (6%), anorexia (2%), 
mucositis (6%), hypoxia (15%), arrhythmia (6%), rash (4%). The only patients who died within 
2 months of treatment were those who had failed to achieve remission (n=7) / had a severe 
infection (n=1).[10] Similar trends have been seen with non-randomized data for single-agent 
azacitadine: 7-day courses were associated with non-significantly improved CR rates (16.7% vs. 
12.1%) and survival (14.9 vs. 13.2 months), with similar rates of hematologic toxicity and 
similar rates of requiring dose modification / treatment interruption.[11] While there is some 
evidence that longer duration of hypomethylating agents may improve efficacy, and while these 
treatments appear to be safe, remission rates are disappointingly low, suggesting that we should 
explore more effective treatments for AML. One such option is combining two treatments with 
limited efficacy (decitabine and chemotherapy) with the hope of finding synergistic efficacy. 
However, we currently do not know how best to combine these agents. Concurrent dosing may 
be the most obvious and most efficient method, but there is some pre-clinical evidence 
suggesting that giving decitabine prior to chemotherapy may improve efficacy. 
Over the last several years, new insight into leukemogenesis has led to the exploration of 
targeting epi[INVESTIGATOR_658934]. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_658935], mediated by [CONTACT_100660]-methyltransferase (DNMT) 
enzymes, has been shown to contribute to myeloid leukemogenesis by [CONTACT_658955], proliferation, and apoptosis [12, 13]. In contrast to 
structural changes, epi[INVESTIGATOR_658936], resulting in gene re-
expression and restoration of normal cellular functions. Decitabine and azacitidine are cytidine 
analogs that deplete DNA methyltransferases, often referred to as a "hypomethylating cytidine 
analogs" (HCAs). Pre-clinical studies on the functional effects of HCAs in hematopoietic cell 
lines demonstrated that decitabine induced a dose-dependent demethylation and apoptotic 
Page 4 of 34 
Protocol 9713.00 
response in myeloid leukemia cells [14]. Additionally, Qin et. al. found that combinations of 
decitabine and cytarabine synergistically killed leukemic blasts [15], with exposure to decitabine 
followed by [CONTACT_658956] a more pronounced synergistic killing effect 
compared to concomitant use of both agents [14]. 
Hypomethylating agents prior to intensive chemotherapy: evidence on tolerability  
Building on the hypothesize that pretreatment (i.e., priming) with a hypomethylating 
agent such as decitabine might sensitize resistant leukemic cells to cytotoxic chemotherapeutics 
and increase the efficacy of induction chemotherapy in AML, a few studies have examined 
combinations of decitabine priming and cytotoxic chemotherapy for the treatment of patients 
with AML. A good way to determine whether HMAs add to the toxicity profile of standard AML 
chemotherapy is in the context of a randomized trial, which are rare in acute leukemia. In this 
case, however, we can draw from the AML-AZA trial, which randomized patients to 7+3 
induction chemotherapy and high-dose cytarabine consolidation with or without 5 days of 
azaciditine priming before cycles. The difference in AEs was not significant, and early death 
rates did not differ (6% vs. 5%).[16] Several trials have used decitabine priming prior to 
intensive chemotherapy using a dose escalation strategy starting at 20 mg/m 2  for 5 days, and 
none has been able to identify an MTD. Scandura et al used decitabine priming for 7+[ADDRESS_889042] limited dose escalation had the protocol 
been written to allow for this.[17] More recently, we have submitted to ASH the final results of 
our phase 1/2 study of decitabine-primed mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine (MEC), which 
uses 1g/m 2  of Ara-C daily for 6 days and safely administered decitabine for 10 days. Earlier 
results from this protocol, FH #2652, were included in our prior submission. Updated results 
with 52 patients with relapsed / refractory AML showed that grade >2 non-hematolgoic / non-
infectious toxicities were fatigue, nausea, and mucositis. Among [ADDRESS_889043], it is possible that the benefits of hypomethylating agents do not actually require priming, 
and that they could be seen with concurrent administration. 
Hypomethylating agents concurrent with intensive chemotherapy: evidence on tolerability  
It remains unknown whether priming is indeed the optimal way of combining decitabine 
with intensive chemotherapy, or whether similar results could be achieved with concurrent 
administration of decitabine along with chemotherapy. Decitabine at 25-30 mg/m 2  for 4 days has 
been combined with intermediate doses of ara-C without increase in severe infection rate or early 
mortality over decitabine alone in MDS ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).[18] Our institution has been giving 
decitabine 20mg/m 2  for 10 days concurrent with high-dose cytarabine as part of protocol FH 
#9109 since 2014. While induction uses intermediate doses of cytarabine, patients who fail to 
achieve remission with this induction are then given 10 days of decitabine concurrent with high- 
Page 5 of 34 
Protocol 9713.00 
dose cytarabine (1g/m 2  daily for 5 days). Per their protocol, "Although ara-C has yet to be 
combined with 10 days of decitabine the absence of toxicity with tosedostat plus... higher doses 
of ara-C (1g/m 2) suggests excess toxicity will not be an issue..." This protocol was approved for 
use in older patients at high risk for treatment-related mortality (TRM scores >13.1), compared 
to those required for this present study (<9.2). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_459271]-risk patient population in 9109, 
this combination has been well-tolerated, with unpublished results communicated by [CONTACT_9154] 
[INVESTIGATOR_658937] 4 of 12 patients had a temporary grade 3-4 non-infectious / non-hematologic 
adverse event related to treatment (muscle weakness in 2, fatigue in 1, and hyperbilirubinemia in 
1). 
Rationale for studying concurrent decitabine rather than primed decitabine 
While it remains unknown whether priming is the optimal way of combining decitabine 
with intensive chemotherapy, we found that having a randomized study of concurrent vs. primed 
decitabine with GCLAM was impractical from an enrollment standpoint. After an initial [ADDRESS_889044] from home, 
having an extra 15 days in Seattle was considered overly onerous, and therefore patients chose to 
enroll in different protocols or receive treatment off protocol rather than being randomized on 
protocol 9713. We did not note any clear difference in toxicity or efficacy between study arms at 
that point, and so we opted to shut down the sequential arm and enroll on the concurrent arm 
alone. This is consistent with unpublished data from our institution on 71 patients treated with 
decitabine-primed MEC both on and off protocol between 11/15/12 and 11/15/[ADDRESS_889045] dose of decitabine, and so it may be that pre-clinical models of priming effects do not 
translate perfectly in vivo. It is possible that any benefits of hypomethylating agents like 
decitabine do not require priming, and that these benefits could be achieved with concurrent 
administration of decitabine and chemotherapy. 
Rationale for combining decitabine with G-CLAM/Demonstration of safety and tolerability 
of using escalated doses of mitoxantrone as part of G-CLAM  
In 2008, Polish investigators reported their experience with the use of G-CSF, cladribine 
(5 mg/m 2  on days 1-5), high-dose cytarabine (2,000 mg/m 2  on days 1-5), and mitoxantrone (10 
mg/m 2  on days 1-3; "G-CLAM") for the treatment of primary refractory AML or early relapsed 
disease, with encouraging activity — among 118 treated patients, a complete remission (CR) rate 
of 58% was obtained — and acceptable tolerability with low rates of grade >2 non-infectious / 
non-hematologic AEs, the most common ones being nausea (20%), diarrhea (14%), mucositis 
(10%), and bleeding (10%) [19]. Starting in 2014, we have conducted a phase 1/2 study of dose-
escalated G-CLAM in adults with newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory AML or high-risk 
MDS ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], Fred Hutch #2734.00). Preliminary results from the phase [ADDRESS_889046] form at the American Society of Hematology in 2015: 18 
mg/m 2/day was identified as the MTD of mitoxantrone in newly diagnosed patients, and 16 
mg/m 2/day in relapsed/refractory patients. Among 31 newly diagnosed patients with median age 
58 (range: 27-77) years, median TRM score 2.83 (range: 0.15-5.54), 1 patient died within 28 
Page 6 of 34 
Protocol 9713.00 
days of treatment initiation from thrombocytopenia-related intracranial hemorrhage. Overall, 
29/31 patients (93.5%) achieved a CR, including 24 (77.4%) with complete count recovery, with 
1-2 cycles of chemotherapy. One DLT occurred at each of dose levels 3 and 4 (respi[INVESTIGATOR_658938]), establishing 18 mg/m 2/day as the MTD of mitoxantrone. Besides infections and 
neutropenic fever, maculopapular rash, nausea, and hypoxia were the most common grade 3+ 
adverse events. There were 26 relapsed and refractory patients treated in Phase 1 with median 
age 57 (37-77) years, median TRM score of 1.73 (range: 0.29-3.92). 2 patients died within 28 
days of treatment initiation from sepsis and cardiogenic shock respectively. Overall, 13/36 
patients (50%) achieved a CR, including 8 (31%) with complete count recovery. One DLT 
occurred at dose level 1 (nausea) and 2 at dose level 4 (encephalitis and cardiogenic shock), 
establishing 16 mg/m 2/day as the MTD of mitoxantrone. Besides infections and neutropenic 
fever, the most common grade 3+ adverse events were nausea, hypoxia (fluid overload and 
infection related), and maculopapular rash.[20] The final results from the phase 1/[ADDRESS_889047] form to ASH this year; similar rates of 
response and adverse events were reported. 
PROTOCOL UPDATE (2-2018) 
Rationale for restricting enrollment to newly diagnosed (ND) patients 
Analysis of treatment outcomes for relapsed/refractory (RR) patients enrolled in this protocol 
revealed an increased rate of delayed blood count recovery (MLFS) over what would be 
expected based on experience with GCLAM without decitabine. Based on these cases, revisions 
to the RR arm of this protocol are being discussed. These revisions are beyond the scope of what 
can be accomplished with a protocol modification, and so we have elected to restrict this 
protocol to ND patients and to work on a new protocol for RR patients. 
Rationale for allowing only 1 cycle of decitabine + GCLAM  
This protocol initially called for multiple cycles of decitabine in combination with 
chemotherapy: patients who failed to achieve CR without measurable residual disease (MRD), or 
MRDneg CR, were eligible for a 2 nd  cycle of decitabine  + GCLAM, while those who did achieve 
this outcome were eligible for consolidation with decitabine + GCLA. Review of outcomes from 
the 4 ND patients who received on-protocol consolidation showed that 2 had delayed or absent 
recovery of neutrophils and platelets not related to leukemia, or morphological leukemia-free 
state (MLFS). Although it is difficult to interpret results from so few patients, in light of results 
from RR patients showing higher rates of MLFS than we would normally expect, we opt to 
restrict patients to a single cycle of decitabine in combination with GCLAM. Patients achieving 
MRDneg CR have the option of receiving GCLA consolidation (which is a standard therapy that 
they could receive on or off protocol), while those who do not achieve MRDneg CR will be 
taken off study. Because we recognize MLFS as a concern with this regimen, we will add criteria 
to the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_658939].  
Rationale for adding a Phase [ADDRESS_889048] cohort of 6 patients, 
we had 1 DLT (a patient experienced early death), but responses in the other [ADDRESS_889049] room to enroll another 4 patients on 
Page 7 of 34 
Protocol 9713.00 
the trial to determine the MTD or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) assuming that the 
remaining patients have only 0 or 1 DLT. Because of these promising early results, we plan to 
expand our study in ND patients at the MTD/RP2D. The Phase 2 expansion includes stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_658940].

6.0 TREATMENT PLAN 
This study is a single-center, open-label phase 1/[ADDRESS_889053] suggested that the hypomethylating activity of decitabine plateaus 
at 20 mg/m 2/d [23] and since data from Fred Hutch #2652.00 discussed above show that 
decitabine can be given safely for 10 days prior to intensive chemotherapy, we will start our trial 
with 10 days of decitabine at 20 mg/m 2/d and will de-escalate the dose based on DLTs. We will 
use G-CLAM dose established based on data from Fred Hutch #2734.00 described above. Bone 
marrows will be reassessed upon blood count recovery or between day Days +25 to +[ADDRESS_889054]. Patients achieving CR or CR with 
incomplete neutrophil or platelet count recovery (CRi) after one induction course are eligible for 
consolidation chemotherapy with G-CSF, cladribine, and cytarabine ("G-CLA"), which should 
begin within 6 weeks of achieving CR/CRi once patients have recovered to < Grade 2 toxicities 
from the previous course of therapy. 
6.1 Baseline/Pre-Treatment Assessment 
The following studies should be obtained at baseline before initiation of study therapy to 
establish trial eligibility and allow patient characterization and disease prognostication: 
6.1.1 History and physical examination (assessed within 14 days prior to registration). 
6.1.2 Peripheral blood and/or bone marrow examination with morphologic and flow 
cytometric assessment, routine cytogenetic analysis, and molecular testing 
(FLT3/ITD, NPM1, CEBPA) as needed to establish the diagnosis; a bone marrow 
biopsy should be obtained if spi[INVESTIGATOR_658943] 10 of 34 
Protocol 9713.00 
(assessed within 2 months of study day 0 as long as no anti-AML therapy has 
been given in the interim; if anti-AML therapy has been given, disease status 
should be reassessed subsequent to this therapy and prior to study day 0). 
6.1.2 Complete blood counts with differential blood count, including immature 
cells/blasts; platelet count (assessed within 14 days prior to registration). 
6.1.3 Testing of renal function, bilirubin, and albumin (should be assessed within 14 
days prior to registration). 
6.1.4 MUGA scan or echocardiography, or other appropriate diagnostic modality, to 
assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; assessed within 3 months prior to 
registration). 
6.2 Pre-Treatment 
At the discretion of the treating physician, allopurinol 300 mg po daily (or equivalent 
dose adjusted for renal function) may be considered in all patients without known allergies to 
allopurinol to reduce the risk of tumor lysis. Higher doses of allopurinol are permitted if patients 
develop tumor lysis syndrome. Patients may receive rasburicase, a recombinant uric acid oxidase, 
for the prevention and/or treatment of tumor lysis syndrome at the discretion of the treating 
physician. All patients should be adequately hydrated and receive anti-emetics as necessary.

o Level -2: 5 days of decitabine (day 1 to day 5). The total dose of decitabine 
delivered will be 100 mg/m 2  for Level -2. 
6.3.2 The dose of decitabine is calculated using the patient's actual weight. 
6.3.3 Decitabine will be administered IV as per institutional standards. 
6.3.4 Administration in the outpatient clinic is permitted. 
Page 11 of 34 
Protocol 9713.00 
6.3.5 All treatment is given as intent-to-treat; missed doses will not be made up. 
6.3.6 No investigational or commercial agents or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_314960]'s malignancy. 
6.4 Administration of G-CSF, Cladribine, Cytarabine, and Mitoxantrone 
6.4.1 The dose of the G-CLAM chemotherapy will be as follows: G-CSF 300 or 480 gg

cladribine 5 mg/m 2  daily IV over 2 hours on Days 1-5, cytarabine 2 g/m 2  daily IV 
over 2 hours on Days 1-5, and mitoxantrone 18 mg/m [ADDRESS_889055] day of G-CLAM induction as Day +1. 
6.4.2 The doses of G-CLAM are calculated using the patient's actual weight. 
6.4.3 If WBC >20,000/µL, Day 0 and Day 1 G-CSF may be omitted at provider 
discretion. 
6.4.4 Administration in the outpatient clinic can be considered but should be discussed 
with the study investigators. 
6.4.5 All treatment is given as intent-to-treat; missed doses will not be made up. 
6.4.6 No investigational or commercial agents or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_314960]'s malignancy. 
6.5 Monitoring during/after Induction Therapy  
For patient monitoring, the following studies and study intervals are suggested: 
6.5.1 Complete blood counts with differential blood count, including immature 
cells/blasts, and platelet count at least 3 times weekly until ANC >1,000/[iL and 
then at least weekly until platelet count >100,000/4. 
6.5.2 Metabolic panel, including electrolytes (Na, K), bilirubin, ALT/AST, and 
creatinine at least weekly until ANC >1,000/A and platelet count >100,000/A. 
6.5.3 If patients develop signs or symptoms suggestive of cardiac dysfunction, LVEF 
should be assessed using the same method to evaluate baseline LVEF status 
(MUGA scan or echocardiography, or other appropriate diagnostic modality). 
6.[ADDRESS_889056] Induction Course 
A bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_314962] (i.e. ANC 
>1,000/4 and platelet count >100,000/µL) or between Days +25 to +[ADDRESS_889057]; a bone marrow biopsy should be obtained 
if spi[INVESTIGATOR_314958]. In patients with unclear response status, 
the bone marrow examination should be repeated every 7-10 days until the response can 
be assessed or until Day +45. 
6.6.1 Patients achieving MRDneg CR: Patients are eligible for consolidation 
chemotherapy, as described in section 6.8. 
6.6.[ADDRESS_889058], CRi, or those with persistent disease: patients 
are eligible for a second course of induction chemotherapy consisting of G-
CLAM without decitabine provided all non-hematologic toxicities have resolved 
Page 12 of 34 
Protocol 9713.00 
to Grade <2. For patients who experienced > Grade 3 non-hematologic / non-
infectious toxicity during the first induction, a dose reduction is recommended as 
described in section 6.7. Patients who achieve CR or CRi after a second induction 
are eligible to receive consolidation chemotherapy, as described in section 6.8. 
6.6.3 Patients with persistent aplasia without evidence of disease after Day +45:  
patients will be removed from protocol. 
6.7 Dose Modifications of Chemotherapeutic Drugs for Initial and Subsequent 
Treatment Cycles  
The following dose modifications are suggested both for induction cycle #1 (i.e. if organ 
function parameters worsen between baseline and start of chemotherapy) and subsequent 
treatment cycles: 
6.7.1 If a patient develops Grade >[ADDRESS_889059] dose of G-CLAM, subsequent doses of 
cladribine and cytarabine will be reduced by 25% and the dose of mitoxantrone 
will drop by 2 mg/m 2. The patient may receive future cycles using this dose-
reduced regimen, if the patient demonstrated potential response and once the non-
hematologic toxicity has resolved to a level of < Grade 2. If a patient develops 
Grade >[ADDRESS_889060] dose-reduced regimen, the dose of the cladribine and 
cytarabine for subsequent cycles will be reduced by 50%. Mitoxantrone will only 
be given for 1' and 2' induction and is not part of post-remission chemotherapy, 
and so further dose reductions will not be required.. The patient may receive 
future cycles using the new dose-reduced regimen, if the patient demonstrated 
potential response and once the non-hematologic toxicity has resolved to a level 
of < Grade 2, unless, at any time, a patient displays Grade >3 non-hematologic 
toxicity other than Grade 3 infections while receiving the 50% dose-reduced 
regimen, at which point the patient will not be eligible for additional therapy as 
part of the protocol. Furthermore, if patients require treatment interruption of > 21 
days from the planned start of the next cycle, the patient will be not be eligible for 
additional therapy as part of the protocol. 
6.7.2 Mitoxantrone: Consider dose reduction of mitoxantrone by 50% if the bilirubin 
concentration is 1.5-4.[ADDRESS_889061]. The dose of mitoxantrone will be reduced to 
25% if the bilirubin concentration is >4.[ADDRESS_889062]. 
6.7.3 Cladribine: If the serum creatinine exceeds 2.0 mg/dL and/or estimated creatinine 
clearance (calculated by [CONTACT_3158]-Gault) decreases to less than 50 mL/min 
during therapy, we will consider dose reduction in discussion with the Oncology 
Pharmacist. 
6.7.4 Cytarabine: If the serum creatinine exceeds 2.0 mg/dL and/or estimated creatinine 
clearance (calculated by [CONTACT_3158]-Gault) decreases to less than 50 mL/min 
during therapy, we will consider dose reduction in discussion with the Oncology 
Pharmacist. 
6.8 Consolidation Therapy 
Page 13 of 34 
Protocol 9713.00 
After a achieving MRDneg CR  after 1 cycle of decitabine + G-CLAM or after achieving 
CR/CRi after 1 cycle of decitabine + G-CLAM followed by [CONTACT_658957], 
patients are eligible for consolidation therapy with G-CLA. Consolidation will not include 
decitabine. 
6.8.1 The treatment is identical to the induction course but without decitabine or 
mitoxantrone (i.e. G-CSF, cladribine, and cytarabine, "G-CLA"), provided the 
patient had <Grade 3-4 non-hematologic / non-infectious toxicity during 
induction. If there was such toxicity, doses should be reduced as described in 
section 6.7. 
6.[ADDRESS_889063] recovered to Grade <2 toxicities from the previous course of therapy. 
6.8.3 Patients can receive up to 4 courses of consolidation therapy. 
6.8.4 Patients can proceed to transplantation barring contraindications and if a suitable 
donor is available. 
6.9 Supportive Therapy 
6.9.1 All patients will be adequately hydrated and receive appropriate anti-emetics 
based upon NCCN guidelines [24]. 
6.9.[ADDRESS_889064] institutional practices (SCCA, UWMC, and Fred Hutch). 
6.9.3 Transfusional support should be carried out according to institutional practice 
guidelines. 
6.10 Treatment of CNS Disease 
Treatment of CNS disease is done according to institutional practice guidelines or the 
preference of the attending physician. 
6.11 Recommended Follow-up Care 
After completion of protocol treatment, patients should be evaluated by [CONTACT_314984]/or national guidelines or the discretion of the attending 
physician. These evaluations may include peripheral blood studies and/or bone marrow 
examinations, as clinically indicated.

7.0 INFORMATION ON STUDY DRUGS 
7.1 Drug Information on Decitabine (5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine)  
7.1.1 Mechanism of action: The exact mechanism of action for decitabine is unknown. 
As a cytosine analog, decitabine is converted to a deoxynucleotide triphosphate 
form and incorporated into DNA during cell division in lieu of cytosine [25]. At 
lower concentrations (0.001-1 µM), its incorporation into DNA traps and depletes 
DNA methyltransferases (MTases), leading to depletion of methylated DNA in 
cell progeny [14, 25]. At higher concentrations (>1 µM), incorporation of the drug 
into DNA probably leads to a large number of DNA breaks, initiating pro-
apoptotic signals and cell death [14]. 
7.1.2 Human pharmacokinetics: The peak decitabine concentration after 20-30 mg/m 2  
infused over 1 hour is reached in approximately 30 minutes after completion of 
the infusion and approaches 0.5 µM. Decitabine is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_658944] a biphasic manner: an initial rapid phase has a very short half- life (tu2a 
= 7 minutes), such that the decitabine concentration falls below 0.01 µM within 1 
hour after completion of the infusion; the half- life of the second clearance phase 
is more prolonged (two = 30 minutes) [26]. Plasma protein binding is negligible 
(<1%) [27]. 
7.1.3 Human toxicology and adverse events (AEs):  Frequent drug-related AEs 
(occurring in 26% -50% of patients) observed in patients treated with standard 
doses of decitabine (20 mg/m 2/day times 5 days) include: anemia, neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, peripheral edema, 
pyrexia, cough, and dyspnea. Less frequent drug-related AEs (occurring in 10% - 
25% of patients) include: febrile neutropenia, anorexia, vomiting, dyspepsia, 
stomatitis, abdominal pain, asthenia, chills, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], 
pneumonia, hypokalemia, arthralgia, back pain, pain in extremity, headache, 
dizziness, insomnia, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], petechiae, rash, and hypotension. Infrequent drug-
related AEs (occurring in 5% -10% of patients) include: thrombocythemia, 
cardiac failure, tachycardia, otalgia, dysphagia, gastro-esophageal reflux, oral 
pain, toothache, tooth abscess, chest pain, generalized edema, mucosal 
inflammation, generalized pain, cellulites, oral candidiasis, sinusitis, bacteremia, 
urinary tract infection, elevated liver function tests, weight loss, dehydration, 
Page 15 of 34 
Protocol 9713.00 
hyperglycemia, hypomagnesaemia, bone pain, muscle spasm, weakness, 
musculoskeletal pain, myalgia, anxiety, confusion, depression, pharyngeal pain, 
pleural effusion, sinus congestion, dry skin, ecchymosis, skin erythema, night 
sweats, pruritis , other skin lesions, hypertension, and death. Rarer drug-related 
AEs (occurring in <5% of patients) include: splenomegaly, myocardial infarction, 
cardio-pulmonary arrest, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular 
tachycardia, cholecystitis, increased bleeding with and without procedures, fungal 
infections, sepsis, periventricular abscess, mycobacterium avium infection, mental 
status changes, renal failure, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary mass, and 
hypersensitivity reaction [28]. 
7.1.4 Formulation and reconstitution: Decitabine is supplied as a sterile, lyophilized 
white powder, in single vial. Each vial contains 50 mg of the drug. DAC should 
be aseptically reconstituted with 10 ml sterile water, providing a concentration of 
5.0 mg/ml with a pH 6.7-7.3. Immediately after reconstitution, the reconstituted 
decitabine solution should be further diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride, 5% 
dextrose, or lactated Ringers to a final drug concentration of 0.1-1.0 mg/ml. 
7.1.5 Administration and compatibility: The diluted decitabine solution should be 
inspected for particulate matter and discoloration prior to IV infusion. If there is 
evidence of particulate matter or discoloration, the solution should not be infused. 
Patients should be pre-medicated with anti-emetic therapy as per standard practice. 
7.1.6 Storage and stability: Vials of non-reconstituted decitabine should be stored at 
room temperature 25°C (77°F). Unless used within [ADDRESS_889067] be prepared using cold infusion liquids (2-8°C, 36-46°F) 
and can be stored at 2-8°C for up to 7 hours. 
7.1.7 Drug-drug interaction: No formal drug-drug interactions have been studied for 
decitabine. Ex vivo studies in human liver microsomes suggest that decitabine is 
unlikely to inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. 
7.1.8 Warnings and precautions:  Ex vivo and in vivo animal models have found that 
decitabine is mutagenic and may harm the fetus, but the effect of DAC on the 
human fetus has not been systematically examined. Thus, it is considered 
pregnancy category D. Women should be advised not to become pregnant while 
receiving decitabine, and men should be advised not to father a child while 
receiving decitabine and at least [ADDRESS_889068] milk; thus, it is 
not recommended for lactating females who are breast-feeding. A small 
percentage of patients will have hypersensitivity reactions to decitabine, and these 
individuals should not receive the drug again. 
7.1.9 Recommended dose adjustments for organ dysfunction: There is limited or no 
data examining the toxicity of decitabine in patients with renal or liver 
dysfunction. Therefore, administration of decitabine to patients with liver or 
kidney disease must be done with caution. 
7.2 Drug Information on G-CSF (Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) 
Page 16 of 34 
Protocol 9713.00 
7.2.1 Mechanism of Action: G-CSF is a growth factor that stimulates the production, 
maturation, and activation of neutrophils. Further, it promotes premature release 
of neutrophils from the bone marrow and enhances their phagocytic capacity. 
7.2.2 Pharmacokinetics: Peak G-CSF concentrations after sub-cutaneous dosing occur 
in 2 to 8 hours, though the onset of action is approximately 24 hours, with plateau 
concentrations in 3-5 days, and elimination over an 11-20 day period. G-CSF is 
cleared by [CONTACT_314985]. Notably, as G-CSF binds neutrophils, plasma 
levels are controlled in large part by [CONTACT_314986].[29] 
7.2.3 Adverse Effects (AEs):  Common drug-related AEs (occurring in >10% of 
patients) include fever, petechiae, elevated uric acid, splenomegaly, bone pain, 
and epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]. Less common drug-related AEs (occurring in 1% -10% of patients) 
include hyper- or hypotension, arrhythmias, headache, nausea, vomiting, 
leukocytosis, and transfusion reaction. Infrequent drug-related AEs (occurring in 
<1% of patients) include acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], allergic reactions, 
alopecia, alveolar hemorrhage, arthralgia, bone density decrease, capi[INVESTIGATOR_59374], cerebral hemorrhage, vasculitis, dyspnea, edema, erythema nodosum, 
hematuria, hemoptysis, hepatomegaly, hypersensitivity, injection site reaction, 
pericarditis, proteinuria, psoriasis exacerbation, pulmonary infiltrates, renal 
insufficiency, sickle cell crisis, splenic rupture, Sweet's syndrome, tachycardia, 
and thrombophlebitis. 
7.2.4 Recommended dose adjustments for organ dysfunction: There is limited or no 
data examining the toxicity of G-CSF in patients with renal or liver dysfunction. 
Therefore, administration of G-CSF to patients with liver or kidney disease must 
be done with caution. 
7.3 Drug Information on Cladribine (2-chloro-2'-deoxvadenosnie, 2-CdA)  
7.3.1 Mechanism of Action: Cladribine is a prodrug that is converted to an adenosine 
deaminase-resistant triphosphate derivative (2-CdATP). This molecule is then 
activated by [CONTACT_68009] a 5'-triphosphate derivative (2-CdAMP), 
which is incorporated into DNA where it acts as a transcription regulator. In 
addition to its cytotoxic properties in dividing cells, cladribine induces death in 
quiescent cells of lymphoid origin through an unknown mechanism.[30] 
7.3.2 Pharmacokinetics:  Cladribine is renally excreted, with 18-35% as unchanged drug. 
It is able to penetrate the CSF, where it achieves 25% of plasma concentrations. It 
is 20% protein-bound. The half-life for elimination after a 2-hour infusion is 
6.7±2.5 hours in patients with normal renal function. 
7.3.3 Adverse Effects:  Common adverse effects (occurring in >10% of patients) include 
fever, fatigue, headache, rash, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, myelosuppression 
(including grade 3/4 neutropenia/thrombocytopenia), injection site reaction, and 
infection. Less common adverse effects (occurring in 1 to 10% of patients) 
include edema, tachycardia, thrombosis, chills, dizziness, insomnia, malaise, 
diarrhea or constipation, weakness, myalgias and arthralgias, cough, dyspnea, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], and diaphoresis. Rare adverse effects (occurring in <1% of patients) 
include aplastic anemia, bacteremia, opportunistic infections, lymphocytopenia, 
Page 17 of 34 
Protocol 9713.00 
altered mental status, hemolytic anemia, hypersensitivity, myelodysplastic 
syndrome, quadriparesis, and renal dysfunction/failure. 
7.3.4 Reconstitution: Cladribine is supplied as a sterile, preservative-free, isotonic 
solution containing 10 mg of cladribine (1 mg/mL) in 10 mL single-use vials. 
Cladribine should be passed through a sterile 0.221m filter prior to introduction 
into the infusion bag containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. 
7.3.5 Administration and Compatibility: The use of 5% dextrose is not recommended as 
a diluent because of increased degradation of cladribine. The infusion solution is 
stable for 24 hours at room temperature. 
7.3.6 Storage and Stability: Store refrigerated 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F). Protect from 
light during storage. 
7.3.7 Recommended Dose Adjustments for Organ Dysfunction: Specific guidelines for 
cladribine dosing in patients with hepatic/renal dysfunction or hypoalbuminemia 
are not clearly defined. Because of the potential for compensatory elimination of 
cladribine in patients with hepatic and/or renal dysfunction, specific guidelines for 
dosing are difficult to define. Thus, when deciding whether to adjust cladribine 
doses for renal dysfunction, the risks for potential toxicities (e.g., 
myelosuppression, neurotoxicity) against the benefits and goals of treatment must 
be considered. 
7.4 Drug Information on Cytarabine (Cytosine arabinoside)  
7.4.1 Mechanism of Action: Cytarabine is a synthetic pyrimidine analog, in which the 
sugar moiety (normally a ribose or deoxyribose) has been replaced with 
arabionose. Although its mechanism of action is not completely understood, the 
active form of cytarabine is probably incorporated into the DNA and interferes 
with DNA synthesis. As such, cytarabine has been found to primarily effect 
dividing cells, blocking their progression from GI to S phase [31, 32]. 
7.4.2 Human Pharmacokinetics: Cytarabine is metabolized by [CONTACT_658958] (aracytidine triphosphate). Aracytidine 
triphosphate is converted to nontoxic uracil derivatives by [CONTACT_658959]. This balance between the levels of kinases and deaminases is critical 
for regulating the sensitivity/resistance of cells to the drug. Like decitabine, the 
plasma clearance of cytarabine is biphasic: initial rapid phase and more prolonged 
second clearance phase. The rapid clearance phase has a relatively short half-life 
(tu2a = 10 minutes), while the half- life of the second clearance phase is slightly 
longer (tun = 1 — 3 hours). The nontoxic metabolites from the drug are excreted 
in the urine, and within 24 hours after the infusion, approximately 80% of these 
nontoxic metabolites can be recovered from the urine [31, 32]. 
7.4.[ADDRESS_889069] Doses of  Cytarabine: The 
dose-limiting toxicity for cytarabine includes myelosuppression and 
cardiotoxicity. Cumulative doses beyond 550 mg/m 2  result in increased risk for 
congestive heart failure. Frequent AEs (not definitely quantified) include the 
following: myelosuppressionleucopenia, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia 
and related bleeding, pyrexia, rash, anorexia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, 
Page 18 of 34 
Protocol 9713.00 
mucositis, anal inflammation or ulceration, hepatic dysfunction or increased liver 
enzymes, and local thrombophlebitis. Less frequent AEs (not definitely quantified) 
include chest pain, pericarditis, dyspnea dizziness, headache, neural toxicity, 
neuritis, alopecia, pruritis, skin freckling, skin ulceration, urticaria, abdominal 
pain, bowel necrosis, esophageal ulceration, esophagitis, pancreatitis, sore throat, 
urinary retention, jaundice/hyperbilirubinemia, local site cellulites, renal 
dysfunction, allergic edema or anaphylaxis, sepsis, and sudden respi[INVESTIGATOR_13086]. Infrequent AEs (not definitely quantified) include aseptic meningitis, 
cardiopulmonary arrest, cerebral dysfunction, cytarabine syndrome (bone pain, 
chest pain, conjunctivitis, fever, maculopapular rash, malaise, myalgia), 
exanthematous pustulosis, hyperuricemia, intestinal pneumonitis, increased lipase, 
paralysis with intrathecal and IV combination therapy, rhabdomyolysis, veno-
occlusive disorder, and death. Adverse Events Associated with High Dose 
Cytarabine include cardiomegaly and cardiomyopathy, coma, severe 
neurotoxicity, personality change, somnolence, total body alopecia, severe rash or 
skin desquamation, gastrointestinal ulceration, peritonitis, intestinal pneumatosis, 
necrotizing colitis, liver abscess or damage, peripheral neuropathy, corneal 
toxicity, hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, pulmonary edema, sudden respi[INVESTIGATOR_1421], and sepsis [31, 32]. 
7.4.4 Reconstitution: Cytarabine should be reconstituted in sterile water and can be 
further diluted using either 5% dextrose or sodium chloride solutions into 
appropriate concentrations for infusion [31, 32]. 
7.4.5 Administration and Compatibility: The diluted cytarabine solution should be 
inspected for particulate matter, discoloration, and haze prior to infusion. If there 
is evidence of particulate matter, discoloration, or haze.the solution should not be 
infused. Patients should be medicated with standard anti-emetic therapy. 
Cytarabine is not compatible (1) during Y-site administration with allopurinol, 
amphotericin B, ganciclovir; (2) in syringe with metoclopropamide; or (3) 
admixed with fluorouracil, heparin, insulin (regular), nafcillin, oxacillin, 
penicillin G. Cytarabine may have variable compatibility when admixed with 
gentamycin, hydrocortisone, and methylpredinsone [31, 32]. 
7.4.6 Storage and Stability: Vials of non-reconstituted cytarabine should be stored at 
room temperature 15°C - 30°C (59°F - 86°F). The diluted cytarabine solution may 
be stable for up to 48 hours if stored at room temperature [31, 32]. 
7.4.7 Drug-Drug Interaction: Reversible decreases in the plasma steady-state 
concentration for digoxin and cardiac glycosides may occur. Cytarabine may 
diminish the therapeutic effect of flucytosine. There is ex vivo data suggesting that 
cytarabine may reduce the effectiveness gentamycin for killing K pneumoniae. 
7.4.8 Warnings and Precautions:  Ex vivo and in vivo studies have found that cytarabine 
causes extensive chromosomal damage and potential malignant transformation. 
Although there have been some case reports describing cytarabine use in pregnant 
humans, these cases reports are few. Thus, cytarabine is considered Pregnancy 
Category D. Women should be advised not to become pregnant while receiving 
cytarabine, and men should be advised not to father a child while receiving 
Page [ADDRESS_889070] milk; thus, it is not 
recommended for lactating females who are breast-feeding. As with any highly 
immunosuppressive medication, cytarabine may diminish the effectiveness of 
dead and live vaccines and enhance the toxic/adverse effect of live vaccines. One 
should avoid use of live vaccines while receiving it. A small percentage of 
patients will have a hypersensitivity reaction to cytarabine, and these individuals 
should not receive the drug again. 
7.4.9 Recommended Dose Adjustments for Organ Dysfunction: Guidelines for 
adjusting cytarabine dose due to renal or liver dysfunction are not standardized, 
but many clinicians will adjust the dose based upon the function of these organs. 
7.5 Drug Information on Mitoxantrone  
7.5.1 Chemistry: Mitoxantrone (dihydroxyanthracenedione) is an anthracenedione 
derivative that intercalates with DNA, resulting in inhibition of nucleic acid 
synthesis. 
7.5.2 Pharmacokinetics: A three-compartment model was described after a single 
intravenous dose of mitoxantrone. The mean alpha half-life is 6 to 12 minutes, the 
mean beta half-life is 1.1 to 3.1 hours, and the mean terminal (gamma) or 
elimination half-life is 23 to 215 hours (median 75 hours). Mitoxantrone has 
extensive distribution into body tissues and is metabolized in the liver to two main 
inactive metabolites (monocarboxylic acid derivative and dicarboxylic acid 
derivative). The major route of excretion for mitoxantrone appears to be biliary 
into the feces; approximately 11% of the dose is recovered in the urine within 5 
days of drug administration, with 65% of this being unchanged drug. 
7.5.3 Adverse Effects: The most common toxicities —associated with mitoxantrone are 
alopecia, nausea/vomiting, Mitoxantrone will cause cardiac toxicity with 
prolonged administration and doses exceeding 80 to 100 mg/m 2. When used after 
doxorubicin, cardiotoxicity is more frequent; an analysis by [CONTACT_658960] a risk of 6% at 134 mg/m 2  prior doxorubicin and 60 
mg/m 2  mitoxantrone, rising to a 15% risk at 120 mg/m [ADDRESS_889071] more frequent occurrences of cardiac toxicity. 
8.0 EVALUATION AND END POINT DEFINITIONS 
8.1 Treatment Response and Outcome 
Treatment response (e.g. morphologic / cytogenetic / molecular complete remission, 
partial remission) or treatment failure (e.g. resistant disease, aplasia, morphological or molecular 
/ cytogenetic relapse) as well as treatment outcome (e.g. overall survival, relapse-free survival, 
event-free survival, and remission duration) are categorized according to criteria recommended 
by [CONTACT_314991] [21, 33]. Patients are routinely assessed for the presence of 
Page 20 of 34 
Protocol 9713.00 
measurable residual disease (MRD) as detected by [CONTACT_83549], as per 
institutional practice. 
8.2 Toxicity Criteria  
This study will use the CTCAE (NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) 
Version 4.0 for Toxicity and Adverse Event reporting. A copy of the CTCAE v4.0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP home page (http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
8.3 Definition of Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs)  
Reported adverse events and potential risks for decitabince, G-CSF, cladribine, 
cytarabine, and mitoxantrone are described in section 7. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) used for 
trial monitoring are defined as follows: 
8.3.1 Any Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity lasting >48 hours that results in >7 day 
delay of the subsequent treatment cycle, with the exception of febrile neutropenia 
or infection. 
8.3.2 Any Grade >4 non-hematologic toxicity, with the exception of febrile 
neutropenia/infection unless felt to be a direct consequence of treatment-related 
toxicity (e.g., intenstinal infection following mucosal barrier breakdown), and 
with the exception of constitutional symptoms if recovery to Grade <2 within 14 
days. 
8.3.3 Lack of recovery of ANC to?: 500/4 and lack of self-sustained platelet count? 
50,000/i.it by [CONTACT_410630] +49 with no evidence of residual leukemia. 
8.4 Duration of Follow-up  
After removal from protocol, patients will be monitored for late toxicities/complications 
for 1 month or until additional anti-AML therapy is given. Patients will be followed after 
completion of study treatment to determine disease-free survival (for patients achieving CR or 
CRi) as well as event-free and overall survival (for all patients), for a maximum of 5 years. 
Follow-up may include periodic (e.g. every 3 months) review of medical records, and, if 
absolutely necessary, direct contact [CONTACT_314992]. 
8.5 Study Endpoints  
The endpoints of the phase 1 portion of this study are the determination of the MTD of 
decitabine in newly-diagnosed patients. Provided that the MTD is successfully determined, 
enrollment in the phase 2 portion of this trial at the MTD will be conducted in this population. 
The endpoints for the phase 2 portion of this study are (primary) MRDneg CR  compared to 
historical controls of G-CLAM alone and (secondary) disease responses, relapse-free, and 
overall survival. For the primary outcome comparison, response rates will use the best response 
after up to 2 cycles of induction (1 with decitabine G-CLAM and 1 with G-CLAM alone). . 
9.0 RECORDS 
Research data will be recorded in an electronic database using a unique study ID for each 
patient to assure patient confidentiality. Subjects will not be referred to by [CONTACT_9127], by [CONTACT_2300], 
or by [CONTACT_30243]. The medical 
records department affiliated with our institution maintains all original inpatient and outpatient 
Page 21 of 34 
Protocol 9713.00 
chart documents. Data from source documents are used to compi[INVESTIGATOR_658945]'s electronic 
database. Source documents are documents where patient data are recorded and documented for 
the first time. They include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, 
laboratory notes, memoranda, quality of life assessments, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded 
data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_371419], and imaging. The licensed medical records department, affiliated 
with the institution where the patient receives medical care, maintains all original inpatient and 
outpatient chart documents. Patient research files are maintained by a designated research 
coordinator and kept in a locked room with access restricted to personnel authorized by [CONTACT_658961]. Access to the database will be restricted by [CONTACT_658962] (i.e., locked offices). 
10.[ADDRESS_889072] to gender or ethnicity. 
The incidence of AML is slightly higher in men [2], so it is expected that the distribution of these 
patients will reflect a slight male predominance of the disease as well as the general demographic 
distribution of AML patients seen at our institution. Based on our statistical approach, we will 
require no more than [ADDRESS_889073] the 
assumption that dosing Level 1 will be safe, and thus n=41 is assumed. If further dosing levels 
are required and n=12 patients enroll at dose level 1, dose level -1, and dose level -2, enrollment 
may occur up to 41+12+12 = 65..

11.0 GUIDELINES FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 
Page 22 of 34 
Protocol 9713.00 
11.1 Expedited Reporting Requirements and Reporting Period  
In accordance with Fred Hutch/UW Cancer Consortium IRB policy, all adverse events 
(AEs; whether occurring on-site or off-site), which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_658946] 
(1) unexpected, and (2) related or possibly related to the research, and (3) serious or suggests that 
the research places research participants or others at a greater risk of physical or psychological 
harm than was previously known or recognized, will be submitted to the IRB within ten (10) 
calendar days of learning of the problem. Both the "Expedited Reporting Form for Unanticipated 
Problems or Noncompliance" and the "Adverse Event Reporting Form", or equivalent forms, 
will be completed for this reporting. AEs will be monitored from the time of initial drug delivery. 
Upon completion of induction chemotherapy (1-2 cycles), patients will be monitored for late 
toxicities for 1 month or until additional anti-AML therapy is given off of this protocol. 
11.2 Definitions:  according to ICH guidelines and 21 CFR 312.32, IND Safety Reports, and 
ICH E2A,Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, and adverse event is defined as 
follows: 
11.2.1 Adverse Event (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation 
subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporarily associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product. Abnormal laboratory values should 
not be recorded as an AE unless an intervention is required (repeating testing to 
confirm the abnormality is not considered an intervention), the laboratory 
abnormality results in a serious adverse event, or the AE results in study 
termination or interruption / discontinuation of study treatment. Otherwise, grade 
>3 AEs other than hematologic toxicities will be recorded, graded, and reported as 
appropriate. While grade >[ADDRESS_889074] duration of cytopenias as well as epi[INVESTIGATOR_43544]. If the degree and duration of cytopenias is consistent with significant 
bone marrow toxicity as defined in 8.3.3, this will be reported as an AE (and as a 
DLT). Medical conditions present at screening before treatment is administered 
are not AEs and should not be recorded. On the other hand, pre-existing medical 
conditions that worsen during treatment or in the post-treatment period will be 
recorded. 
11.2.2 Related or Possibly Related AE: An AE is "related or possibly related to the 
research procedures" if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_14371], it was more 
likely than not caused by [CONTACT_28821]. AEs that are solely caused by 
[CONTACT_113363], disorder or condition of the subject or by [CONTACT_658963], disorder 
or condition of the subject are not "related or possibly related". If there is any 
question whether or not an AE is related or possibly related, the AE should be 
reported. 
11.2.3 Serious AE (SAE): An adverse event that results in any of the following 
outcomes: 
Page 23 of 34 
Protocol 9713.00 
• Death 
• Life-threatening adverse event (real risk of dying) 
• Prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]* 
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity/or change in psychosocial status 
• Congenital anomaly 
• Requirement of intervention to prevent permanent impairment of damage 
*Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_56595] a serious adverse event if required 
for complications of AML or comorbid conditions. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_658947] a SAE if it fulfills the criteria for a serious and unexpected adverse 
event as otherwise described. 
11.2.4 Unexpected AE: An AE is "unexpected" when its nature, severity, or frequency 
are not consistent with (a) the known of foreseeable risk of adverse events 
associated with the research procedures described in the protocol-related 
documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol, informed consent 
document, and other relevant sources of information such as product labeling and 
package inserts; and are also not consistent with (b) the characteristics of the 
subject population being studied including the expected natural progression of any 
underlying disease, disorder or condition or any predisposing risk factor prolife 
for the adverse event. 
11.3 Monitoring Adverse Events and Recording Period: 
All non-hematologic grade 3-[ADDRESS_889075] 
duration of cytopenias as well as epi[INVESTIGATOR_164355]. Upon completion of induction 
chemotherapy (1-2 cycles), patients will be monitored for late toxicities/complications for 1 
month or until additional anti-AML therapy is given off of this protocol. 
All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_658964]. When applicable AEs should be recorded as diagnoses rather than as the 
individual signs and symptoms. AEs that do not meet the requirement for expedited reporting 
will be reported to the IRB as part of the annual renewal of the protocol. Myelosuppression and 
associated complications are expected events during leukemia therapy; therefore, 
myelosuppression and associated simple complications such as fever, infections, bleeding, and 
related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_658948]. For example, 1) simple febrile neutropenia with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_658949], 
whereas febrile neutropenia complicated by [CONTACT_6907]-negative bacteremia with shock or its 
complications is to be reported expeditiously; 2) thrombocytopenic epi[INVESTIGATOR_658950], whereas major gastrointestinal bleed 
will be reported expeditiously. 
11.4 Recording Adverse Events:  
The following information should be recorded: description of the AE, whether the AE is 
serious, the start and stop date of the event, the severity (grade), a description of potential 
relatedness of the event to a study drug or other cause, action taken due to the AE, and outcome 
Page 24 of 34 
Protocol 9713.00 
of the AE. Subjects who terminate the study will be followed for AEs for 1 month or until 
additional anti-AML therapy is given, as per section 8.4. 
11.5 Grading Adverse Event Severity  
All AEs will be graded in severity according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0. as per section 8.2. If a CTCAE criterion does not 
exist, the investigator should use the grade or adjectives: Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate), 
Grade 3 (severe), Grade 4 (life-threatening), or Grade 5 (fatal) to describe the maximum intensity 
of the AE. 
11.6 Attribution of an Adverse Event 
Association or relatedness to the study agents will be assessed by [CONTACT_3470]: 
• Definite: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from exposure to the 
investigational agent, has been previously described in association with the 
investigational agent, and cannot reasonably be attributed to other factors such as the 
subject's clinical state, other therapeutic interventions or concomitant medications; 
AND the event disappears or improves with withdrawal of the investigational agent 
and/or re-appears on re-exposure (e.g., in the event of an infusion reaction). 
• Probable: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from exposure to the 
investigational agent and has been previously been described in association with the 
investigational agent OR cannot reasonably be attributed to other factors such as the 
subject's clinical state, other therapeutic interventions or concomitant medications. 
• Possible: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from exposure to the 
investigational agent, but could be attributable to other factors such as the subject's 
clinical state, other therapeutic interventions or concomitant medications. 
• Unlikely: Toxicity is doubtfully related to the investigational agent(s). The event may 
be attributable to other factors such as the subject's clinical state, other therapeutic 
interventions or concomitant medications. 
• Unrelated: The event is clearly related to other factors such as the subject's clinical state, 
other therapeutic interventions or concomitant medications. 
For general AE assessment, an AE is considered related if it is assessed as definitely, probably, 
or possibly related; unrelated if it is assessed as unlikely related or unrelated. 
12.0. DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN 
Institutional support of trial monitoring will be in accordance with the Fred Hutch / 
University of Washington Cancer Consortium Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
(DSMP). Under the provisions of this plan, Fred Hutch Clinical Research Support coordinates 
data and compliance monitoring conducted by [CONTACT_51760], contract research organizations, or 
Fred Hutch employees unaffiliated with the conduct of the study. Independent monitoring visits 
occur at specified intervals determined by [CONTACT_658965]. In addition, protocols are reviewed at least annually 
and as needed by [CONTACT_122934] (DSMC), Fred Hutch 
Scientific Review Committee (SRC) and the Fred Hutch / University of Washington Cancer 
Consortium Institutional Review Board (IRB). This trial will be monitored twice yearly. The 
Page [ADDRESS_889076] (DSMB) will be 
established to review the trial yearly as well. DSMB reviews will be offset from DSMC reviews 
such that the trial will be monitored twice annually. The review committees evaluate accrual, 
adverse events, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], and adherence to the applicable DSMP for studies actively 
enrolling or treating patients. The IRB reviews the study progress and safety information to 
assess continued acceptability of the risk-benefit ratio for human subjects. Approval of 
committees as applicable is necessary to continue the study. The trial will comply with the 
standard guidelines set forth by [CONTACT_122935], state, and 
federal guidelines. 
13.[ADDRESS_889077]  
In accordance with federal regulations (21 CFR 312.66), an Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) that complies with regulations in [ADDRESS_889078] also be 
informed that they may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without 
jeopardizing their future treatment. In accordance with federal regulations (21 CFR 50), all 
patients enrolled in the study must sign the IRB-approved consent form. 
13.[ADDRESS_889079] parties, other than those noted below, is prohibited. Upon the patient's request 
and written permission, medical information may be given to his/her personal physician or other 
appropriate medical personnel responsible for the patient's welfare. Data generated for this study 
must be available for inspection on request to representatives of the national or local health 
authorities, and the associated IRB/IEC. Release of research results or data that reveal patient 
names or other identifiers, such as photographs, audio or videotapes, must be carried out in 
accordance with Department of Health and Human Services Final Standards for Privacy of 
Individual Health Information, [ADDRESS_889080] be obtained from 
the patient and IRB/IEC prior to the release of such information. Identifiable patient data may 
not be used for purposes of promoting any drugs used in this trial. 
13.4 Publication Statement 
The results of this clinical trial may be used for public dissemination in the form of 
papers, abstracts, posters, or other informational materials to be presented at scientific meetings, 
or published in professional journals, or as a part of an academic thesis by [CONTACT_2413]. 
Identifiable patient data may not be used for any of these presentations, manuscripts, or reports 
unless directed by [CONTACT_2371].

Protocol 9713.00 
14.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
14.1 General Considerations:  
14.1.[ADDRESS_889081] 75% of the 
assigned decitabine and G-CLAM doses during Cycle [ADDRESS_889082] 75% of 
treatment during Cycle 1, the patient will be considered not evaluable for DLT 
and will be replaced. 
14.1.3 Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the highest dose studied in which 
the incidence of DLT is <33%. 
14.2 Phase 1 Dose De-Escalation Scheme  
Within each study arm (newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory) and within each 
randomization group (sequential and concurrent decitabine) start with dose Level 1 and evaluate 
6 patients: 
a) If [ADDRESS_889083] DLT, expand cohort to 12 patients; if <3 DLTs are observed in 
12 patients declare Level 1 = Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for that study arm 
and randomization group. 
b) If more than [ADDRESS_889084] DLT with dose Level 1, enroll a cohort of 
6 patients at dose Level -1. 
c) If [ADDRESS_889085] DLT, expand cohort to 12 patients; if <3 DLTs are observed in 
12 patients declare Level -1 = MTD for that study arm and randomization group. 
d) If more than [ADDRESS_889086] DLT with dose Level -1, enroll a cohort 
of 6 patients at dose Level -2. 
e) If [ADDRESS_889087] DLT, expand cohort to 12 patients; if <3 DLTs are observed in 
12 patients declare Level -2 = MTD for that study arm and randomization group. 
0 If dose level -2 is found too toxic, the study will terminate for that study arm and 
randomization group. 
Observed versus true DLT rates are summarized here, with two-sided confidence intervals (CIs) 
for probability of DLT with n=12 patients: 
Observed DLTs 80% CI 90% CI 
0 of 12 (0%) (0%, 17%) (0%, 22%) 
1 of 12 (8%) (0%, 29%) (0%, 34%) 
2 of 12 (17%) (5%,39%) (3%,44%) 
3 of 12 (25%) (10%, 48%) (7%, 53%) 
4 of 12 (33%) (15%,56%) (13%,61%) 
5 of 12(42%) (22%, 64%) (18%, 68%) 
Note that 3 DLTs / 12 patients are permitted to declare MTD; if >[ADDRESS_889088] occur. 
In Phase 2, we use the term Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) to denote the dose level 
determined in Phase 1 to be used in Phase 2. 
Page 27 of 34 
Protocol 9713.00 
14.3 Phase 2 
The primary objective of Phase 2 is to evaluate the rate of MRDneg CR after up to 2 courses of 
induction chemotherapy. We will also continue to evaluate toxicity during Phase 2. 
A Simon Minimax two-stage design will be used. The historic rate of MRDneg CR with G-
CLAM alone is 71%. Our regimen will be considered of no further interest if the true rate of 
MRDneg CR is 65% or less (null), while an MRDneg CR rate of 80% will be of considerable 
interest (alternative). The design has a one-sided type-1 error rate of 10% and a power of 80% 
for the primary outcome. Patients treated at the RP2D in Phase [ADDRESS_889089] stage will evaluate 19 patients. If 13 or more patents achieve MRDneg CR, the trial 
will move to stage 2. Additionally, as we are targeting DLT <33% in Phase 1, if [ADDRESS_889090] 19 patients (36%) have what would qualify as a DLT in cycle 1, we would suspend the 
study and consider closure or dose reduction. Under the null hypothesis of an MRDneg CR rate 
of 65%, the probability we stop accrual after the first stage is 51%. 
The second stage would evaluate an additional 22 patients (total n=41). If 31 or more of 
these 41 patients achieve MRDneg CR and if 13 or fewer (<31%) have what would qualify as a 
DLT in cycle 1, we would consider the regimen worthy of further investigation. 
15.[ADDRESS_889091] this study in accordance with applicable [LOCATION_002]

HDS and FGFR3 ” 
NCT number : [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] 
Document Date : 11/29/2022  
  
Protoco l: 
Study Design:  This was a prospec�ve 6-month double -blind placebo -controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_399552] -HDS or FGFR -3.  The  trial was 
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ).   
Subjects :  Poten�al research subjects were recruited from the panel of pa�ents seen by 
[CONTACT_399556]/peripheral nerve groups at  Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC)  ([LOCATION_011], MA)  
and HonorHealth Neurology  (Phoenix, AZ)  and by [CONTACT_31195]�ents seen at neighboring ins�tu�ons in the [LOCATION_011] 
and Phoenix areas .  Addi�onal referrals were obtained through ClinicalTrials.gov.  All recruited subjects 
provided signed  informed consent as  approved by  [CONTACT_399557]�tu�onal Review Boards of  BIDMC and 
Honor Health.   
Inclusion Criteria: Pa�ents were poten�ally eligible if they  had clinically evident SFN in a length 
dependent or non -length dependent patern  as conﬁrmed by [CONTACT_399558] , 
shoo�ng , or prickling pain or dysesthesia for at least 6 months and examina�on ﬁndings demonstra�ng 
loss of pain  sensa�on  and/or loss of temperature detec�on  in the distribu�on of pain .  Subjects also 
required evidence of reduced  intra -epi[INVESTIGATOR_303868] ﬁber density  (IENFD) seen on skin biopsy in the 
region corresponding to examina�on abnormali�es , based on age and sex -matched norma�ve values , 
using PGP 9.5 as the immunostain  .15 Subjects required a baseline daily pain score on a visual analogue  
scale  (VAS)  of greater  than  or equal to 4/10 .  Pa�ents also required elevated �ters of autoan�bodies to 
TS-HDS or F GFR-[ADDRESS_503623] enzyme linked immunoassay ( ELISA ) assays as previously published . 14, 16  An�body 
�ters were measured at the �me of screening and abnormal values measured at the Washington 
University labora tory within  the 6 months  prior to screening were accepted .  Norma�ve values  re 
<10,000 for TS -HDS and <3,000 for FGFR3 .   
Exclusion Criteria:  Individuals were excluded if they had e vidence of large ﬁber neuropathy such as 
abnormal nerve conduc�on studies, motor weakness, absent vibra�on, propriocep�on or deep tendon 
reﬂexes.  Individuals were also excluded if they were found to have other known cause s for small ﬁber 
neuropathy : diabetes , prediabetes , HIV, Sjogren' s syndrome , vitamin deﬁciency , toxin exposure , or 
monoclonal gammopathy .  Pa�ents were also excluded for generalized, severe musculoskeletal 
condi�ons other than SFN that would have prevented accurate  assessment by [CONTACT_099] , or for an 
underlying condi�on that would put them at risk of complica�on from a biopsy such as an�coagulant use 
or high risk of i nfec�on . Other exclusions were a contraindica�on to IVIG because of renal dysfunc�on  
with crea�nine >1.5  mg/dl , prior thrombo� c event or a hypersensi�vity reac�on to IVIG in the past.  
Screening: Study subjects underwent a detailed history, physical examina�on , laboratory studies, pain 
VAS scores, the Short -From 36 ques�on health survey  (SF-36), an�body measurement of TS -HDS and 
FGFR -3 and skin biopsy evalua�on of nerve ﬁber density at the distal leg and proximal thigh using 
standard methodology.  
Randomization and Blinding: Subjects who  were eligible for study inclusion were block randomized into 
2 groups (IVIG or pla cebo) by a blinded sta�s�cian.  All study personnel, study subjects and support staﬀ 
were blinded to treatment assignment.  Only the single research pharmacist who mixed the 
IVIG/placebo was aware of the treatment assignment and was not in communica�on  with any study 
staﬀ.  IVIG and placebo were placed  in opaque infusion bags that covered the en�re treatment product 
and infusion line  to prevent unblinding.   
Study Medication and Treatment Allocation : Subjects received  either IVIG or placebo.  IVIG treatment 
involved a n ini�al dose of 1  gm/kg  (Gamunex, Grifols , Los Angeles, CA ) daily for 2 days followed by 1 
gm/kg in a single dose every 3 weeks for 21 weeks (for a total of 8 doses)  with a maximum of 80  gm IVIG 
infusion .  Normal saline  was used as placebo and included in a volume equivalent to that of IVIG.   
Study Procedures:  The outline of the study protocol is seen in Supplemental Figure 1.  At all study visits 
par�cipants underwent review of inclusion and exclusion criteria, medical history, medica�on review, 
adverse eﬀect review, and pain VAS scores (0 -10 scale  – reported as pain on the day of visit ). At the 
screening and ﬁnal study visits all subjects also completed skin biopsies at the distal leg,17 the Utah Early 
Neuropathy Scale  (UENS) ,18 and the SF -36.19 
Physical Examination : Detailed neurologic examinations were performed at baseline and at 
the final visit .  The physical examination was quantified via the UENS .18  In brief, the UENS  is a 
42-point system that grades neuropathy f rom 0 (no neuropathy) to 42 (absent ankle reflex es, 
weakness at the toes, absent sensation to multiple modalities in the legs ).   
Pain Scores : Subjects rated their pain on an 11- point visual analogue Likert scale at every visit 
(where 0 = no pain and 10 = maximal pain). The location, exacerbating factors and character of 
pain were  recorded at each visit. Subjects were treated with medications to reduce neuropathic 
pain at the discretion of the treating physician, including anti -convulsants, anti-depressants and 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], typi[INVESTIGATOR_399553]. Pain scores were measured while on medication.  Subjects 
were asked not to change doses of daily neuropathy pain medications while participating in the 
clinical trial.  Subject use of pain medications was monitored at each study visit.  
Skin Biopsy Evaluation of I ntra-Epi[INVESTIGATOR_399554] (IENFD) :  All study 
participants underwent [ADDRESS_503624] techniques.  Specimens were fixed and stained with PGP 
9.5 (ubiquitin hydrolase, Chemicon).20  All patients underwent IENFD counting by a blinded 
physician and results were expressed as a linear density for IENFD (number of fibers per millimeter).

Sta�s�cal Analysis  Plan :   
Primary Outcome : The primary eﬃcacy endpoint for this study was the change in IENFD  between 
visits 1 and 8.  We deﬁned  a clinically relevant change in disease endpoint as a >2 .0 ﬁber/millimeter 
increase in IENFD  between screening and ﬁnal visit . We an�cipate d no change in IENFD  between visits 1 
and 8  in the placebo treatment arm . The change in IENFD  was based on prior studies of lifestyle 
modiﬁca�on in diabe�c neuropathy where increases in IENFD of >2 ﬁbers/mm over 1 year were seen in 
25% of pa�ents a ssociated with an impro vement in neuropathic pain .22   Pain was not selected as a 
primary outcome measure be cause a separate ongoing clinical trial using IVIG in small ﬁber neuropathy 
was already inves�ga�ng pain as an endpoint,[ADDRESS_503625] was in evalua�ng 
IVIG for poten�al impact on disease modiﬁca�on.   
Secondary Outcomes : Two secondary outcome measures are included in this study:  
1) The change in neuropath ic pain severity between visits [ADDRESS_503626] a >2 -point reduc�on in neuropathic pain VAS score between screening and ﬁnal visit .  
We an�cipate d a <1 .5-point reduc�on in neuropathic pain VAS score between screening and 
ﬁnal visit in the placebo group . 
2) The change in  quan�ﬁed UENS sco res, between screening and ﬁnal visit.   
We expected that individuals  with immune mediated SFN treated with IVIG would  have a 
have a >[ADDRESS_503627] no change in UENS score between 
screening and final visits . 
Exploratory Outcomes : Safety in response to IVIG infusion and c hanges in distribu�on or character 
of pain associated with SFN  in pa�ents treated with IVIG .   
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_399555] a larger clinical 
trial but  was powered to answer the primary endpoint analysis.  Secondary endpoints and exploratory 
endpoints are not included in the power analysis .  The sample size of 10  par�cipants per group was 
determined with an assumed change in IENFD  rate of 0 ﬁbers/millimeter in the placebo group and >2 .0 
ﬁbers/millimeter in the IVIG group, a 1 -sided α of 5%, and 80% power between the 2 groups, including 
the assump�on of a dropo ut rate of 1 0% ( 2 pa�ents). Therefore, the aim was to include in total 20 
pa�ents in the study.  
The results were  analyzed  according to the inten�on -to-treat (ITT) protocol.  For the primary ITT analysis , 
missing values were imputed as no change from baseline . Par�cipants were analyzed for eﬃcacy 
according to randomized treatment. For the SF -36 Health Survey , biopsy results , and UENS examina�on 
ﬁndings , the diﬀerence between baseline (screening period) and the end of the ﬁnal visit  was calculate d. 
For the primary outcome  measure , the propor�on of pa�ents with a decrease of at least 2.0 
ﬁbers/millimeter was compared between the IVIG and placebo groups with a χ2 test, with mean and 
standard devia�ons reported . For secondary outcome measure, mea n change in values between groups 
was compared using a student ’s T-test (2 tailed, 2 sample, homoscedas�c variance) .  For pain VAS scores, 
ANOVA was used to measure diﬀerences in pain scores between IVIG and placebo  groups.

[ADDRESS_1182029]: HM2001850 5 
Document date: May 20, [ADDRESS_1182030] of brain 
anatomy on the efficacy of iTBS is beneficial for two primary reasons: 1)  imaging techniques pr ovide the 
opportunity to identify the best  patients for iTBS therapy based on their brain anatomy, and 2) stimulation 
therapy could be  optimize d based on the patient’s  brain anatomy. Thus, the effect of brain anatom y on 
iTBS efficacy is important to tailor rehabilitation  appropriately .  
 
In order to determine the effect of brain anatomy on the induced electric fields acting on cortical neural 
fiber tracts projecting to upper limb muscles from single pulse TMS we will  create anatomically accurate 
computational brain models using MR images from  ten nonimpaired individuals. The brain models we 
develop will incorporate anatomical features, including fiber tracts, from magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) data we record from these ten nonimpaired participants.  We will record neurophysiologic data 
from the same ten nonimpaired participants in order to t est for correlations between biceps and FDI 
motor evoked potentials before and following iTBS with modeled induced electric fields acting on their 
corresponding cortical fiber tracts.  
 
Human Subjects  
Ten nonimpaired individuals will be recruited for participation. All subjects will complete and sign a safety 
questionnaire to verify that they are fre e of contraindications for MRI and TMS. All subjects will provide 
informe d written consent . We will seek study approval from the VCU Institutional Review Board.  
 
Magnetic Resonance Image Acquisition  (Session 2 or 3)  
T1-weighted images will be acquired using a 3D MPRAGE sequence (time echo (TE)/time repetition 
(TR)=3.2/6.8 ms acquired sagittally with a 1.0x1.0x1.2 mm resolution at a flip angle of 9 , echo train 
length (ETL) = 240, matrix=256x240).  T2 -weighted images will be acquired using a 3D multishot turbo  
spin echo sequence (TE/TR=245/2500 ms acquired sagittally with a matchin g resolution of the T1 -W 
images, two  averages, flip angle=90 , ETL=133, matrix=256x256).  DTI images will be acquired using a 
high resolution single -shot spin echo EPI [INVESTIGATOR_79714] (TE/TR =89/5700 ms acquired axially with a 1.7 mm 
isotropic resolution at a flip angle of 78 , ETL=141, matrix=140x140, max b -value=2000 s/mm2, 96 
directions).   
 
Computational Brain Modeling  and Simulation of TMS  
We will use MRI data from ten nonimpaired individ uals to create 3D head and brain models of each 
individual. Using the software Freesurfer, along with high -resolution T1 and T2 weighted images, we will 
create high -resolution anatomically accurate models with differentiated skin, bones, cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_656927] d, 
grey matter, white matter, and ventricles within the brain. The Freesurfer software we will use is open -
source and developed for analyzing MRI images for development of 3D models. We will input MRI slices 
and uses contrast information to estimate anatom ical boundaries, such as that between the skin and 
skull, or between grey matter and white matter. A 3D mesh is then created using these estimated 
boundaries and other geometrical information taken directly from the input MRI data.  
We will use high resolut ion DTI data and extract fiber tracts using a graphic al toolbox 
ExploreDTI .[ADDRESS_1182031], such as M1 , with seed fractional anisotr opy threshold of 0.2, minimum fiber length 
of 50 mm and angle threshold of 30 degrees. Coordinates of tracts are imported into SolidWorks and 
9 
 extruded to a solid, 3D line. These 3D fiber models are exported as .STL files for finite el ement analysis 
in Sim4 Life. Figure  3 shows on the left the fiber tracts originating from M1 , and on the ri ght fibers being 
stimulated by a figure -of-eight  TMS coil.  The fiber models will be embedded into our 3D head models to 
calculate  the induced electric field during TMS in different regions of the brain.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Using  finite  element analysis, we will  determine the induced electric fields acting on isolated 
fiber tracts by [CONTACT_850182]4Life  software. We will specify material properties (see Table 2), 
grid details, and the current source, similar to our previous work. Induced electric fields will be 
calculated using the Slice Viewer and Surface Viewer utilities within Sim4Life.  Voxels stimula ted above 
a threshold electric field of 150 V/m will be recorded . 
 
Table 2. Material properties we will specify in Sim4Life simulations of TMS.  
 
 
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Human Subjects  
Subjects who underwent MR imaging, will also participate in two sessions of TMS. Each TMS session 
will consist of baseline measures of MEPs in response to single pulse TMS, followed by [CONTACT_850183]. 
One iTBS session will  one target  the biceps , and one session will target  the FDI. Each session will consist 
of active iTBS applied to the hotspot of the target muscle , and sham iTBS . Sessions  will be separated by 
[CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_1182032] er to quantify  corticomotor excitability  similar to our 
preliminary work . 
Subjects will be instrumented with surface electromyography (EMG ) electrodes on their dominant 
arm after the skin is shaved and cleaned wit h alcohol wipes. S urface EMG electrodes (disposable Ag -
AgCl, Noraxon) will be located over the biceps and the FDI. EMG signals will be amplified (x 1000) and 
bandpass -filtered  prior to A/D conversion (CED Micro 1401 MkII, Cambridge Electronic Design ). All EMG 
data will be sa mpled at 2 kHz using Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531]2 softwar e (Cambridge Electronic Design ) and stored on a 
personal computer for offline analysis.  
Prior to the iTBS session, the maximal compound muscle action potential (Mmax) will be recorded 
from the target muscle (biceps or FDI ). The amplitude of Mmax is required to normalize MEP amplitudes. 
 
Fig. 3.  M1 fibers will be extracted from DTI MRI . Isolated fiber tracts will be exported as 3D objects in 
order to simulate the  induced electric field from TMS on the 3D fibers at regions of interst in the brain.  

[ADDRESS_1182033] Mmax, single pulse electrical stimuli, 0.2 ms pulse width will be delivered to Erb’s point via a 
bipolar stimulating electrode (0.47 cm2; 2.5 cm inter -electrode distance) connected  to a constant current 
stimulator (DS7AH, Digitimer Ltd .). To determine RMTs and record MEPs, single pulse TMS will be 
delivered to the motor cortex contralateral to the  resting  target arm using a Super Rapid2 Plus1 stimulator 
via a [ADDRESS_1182034]’s head. The coil will be held tangentially on the 
scalp via a support stand with the coil center rotated to induce a pos terior -to-anterior cortical current 
across the central sulcus. The h otspot for the target muscle will be identified as the location evoking the 
largest peak -to-peak amplitude MEP using the lowest stimulation intensity. Resting motor threshold 
(RMT) will be  determined as the lowest stimulus intensity that induces MEPs of ≥ [ADDRESS_1182035] 5 of 
10 consecutive stimuli with the target muscle fully relaxed.21 The stimulus intensity for ensuing single 
pulse MEP trials will be set at 120% of RMT. To record MEPs, the stimulator will be triggered to deliver 
15 stimuli at a rate of 0.2 Hz.  Active motor threshold (AMT) will then be determined during sustained 
contractions of 20% the subject’s maximum effort . With visual feedback provided relative to their 
maximum  EMG root mean squared value , subjects will sustain a 20% maximum effort contrac tion of the 
target muscle during which AMT will be determined as the stimulus intensity that elicits a MEP ≥ [ADDRESS_1182036] of three pulses presented at 50 Hz, repeated every 200 ms for 2 s at an 
intensity of 80% AMT. Two second bursts will be repe ated every 8 s for a total of 600 pulses  (Figure 4) .2 
For the sham condition, a sham coil (Magstim 70mm double air film sham coil) , looking  identical to  the 
active coil and making a similar noise but without delivering any active stimulation, will be applied to the 
hotspot of the target muscle. Throughout each session subjects will wear earplugs, be kept unaware of 
the type of stimulation, an d be presented with  nature videos to control engagement.  
 
Data and Statistical Analysis  
We will calculate  the root mean square (RMS) amplitude of the evoked response, the RMS 
amplitude of the pre -stimulus background EMG (over a duration  of approximately [ADDRESS_1182037]. The intensity of all iTBS 
pulses will be 80% of the subject’s active motor threshold (AMT). Before each iTBS session (iTBS 1 
and 2, which are sham  and active, respectively ), RMTs and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) will be 
recorded. MEPs will also be recorded at 10 minute intervals following iTBS.

 duration of the corresponding evoked response), and the peak -to-peak amplitude of the evoked response 
(MEP or M -wave) using purpose -written M atlab code (The MathWorks, Inc. ). Stimulus events where the 
pre-stimulus RMS amplitude is large r than the evoked response, or where voluntary activity is detected, 
will be discarded to ensure similar levels of background activity across subjects and trials. MEP 
amplitudes will be normalized by [CONTACT_850184]. All patient charact eristics, 
including RMTs and AMTs, will be summarized using means and standard deviations. The overall mean 
and standard deviation of MEPs (normalized to Mmax and unnormalized) will be reported. Linear mixed 
effect models will be used to determine the over all mean difference between the normalized MEP 
amplitudes between the active and sham protocols. Separate mixed effect model analyses will be used 
for each  muscle (biceps and FDI), condition (sham and active) and  time point following iTBS (in total [ADDRESS_1182038] models). Since this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], all inference will be performed at the 0.[ADDRESS_1182039] for correlations between mean  MEPs in response to single pulse TMS (before iTBS protocol) and 
the maximum induced electric field. A strong correlation between MEPs and induced electric fields would 
indicate a strong relationship between our experimental and computational outcome measu res and 
provide a foundation for our future work. Pearson correlation coefficients will also be computed to test for 
correlations between mean  MEPs following iTBS and maximum induced electric fields to determine 
whether greater induced electric fields indi cate a participant is more responsive to the iTBS protocol.   
 
Biostatistical Justification  
The difference in the corticomotor excitability  (as measured by [CONTACT_850185] (MEPS))  can be used to determine if there is a difference between the active and sham 
protocols. Under the conditions that the true difference between the  active and sham  protocols is 5% of 
the normalized MEP  with a standard deviation of 9%, and that the correlat ion between the differences 
within an individual is 0.5, ten nonimpaired subjects will be needed to achieve at least 80% power using 
a two -sided test of the overall mean using a repeated measures model. The Type -I error rate was set at 
0.[ADDRESS_1182040], 
to be submitted as an R01 application to National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research (NCMRR) 
within the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development ( NICHD ) 
in June [ADDRESS_1182041] aligns with two research priorities within NCMRR: 1) to explore multimodal 
approaches that promote plasticity and sensorimotor function, particularl y the combination of physical 
therapy with stimulation treatments, and 2) to develop objective measures that may predict rehabilitation 
treatment response, monitor functional progress, and tailor interventions to the individual  abilities, needs, 
and resources of the person with disabilities .  
 
Potential Risks  
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non -invasive brain stimulation technique. TMS protocols, 
including the single pulse and intermittent theta burst stimulation protocols that we propose  to use in 
human subjects, present non -significant risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a human subject. The 
risks associated with TMS protocols have been investigated and discus sed in detail.3 Risks and side 
effects associated with TMS include: heating, induced voltages, forces and magnetization, effect on 
hearing, induced seizure or syncope, headache, local pain or discomfort, and neurophysiological 
changes.  
 
12 
 The risk of heating includes the overheating of the stimulating coil and/or brain tissue. This risk will be 
minimized by [CONTACT_2329] a Magstim Double 70mm Air Film Coil . The Double 70mm Air Film Coil contains 
two temperature sensors. When the internal coil tempe rature approaches 20°C, indicators on the UI 
illuminate. When the internal temperature reaches 41°C, the stimulator will shut down and the Replace 
Coil Light will illuminate.  
 
The risks of induced voltages, forces and magnetization will be minimized by [CONTACT_850186]. Our protocols will exclude the use of TMS on, or in the vicinity of, 
patients or users with cardiac demand pacemakers, implanted defibrillators and/or implanted 
neurostimulators.  
 
The effect on hearin g will be minimized by [CONTACT_850187].  
 
The risk of induced seizure or syncope will be minimized by [CONTACT_850188]. Intake of or withdr awal 
from certain central nervous system (CNS) active drugs lowers seizure threshold. The actual risk for 
seizure induction may depend on additional, not yet fully explored, factors such as drug dose, speed of 
dose increase (or decrease), and combination w ith other CNS active drugs. The majority of reported 
TMS -induced seizures have occurred in subjects/patients on drugs with seizure threshold lowering 
potential. Thus, we will exclude individuals taking medications as listed in section 5.[ADDRESS_1182042] stimulation (TBS), a review of the literature reveals [ADDRESS_1182043] of the published reports of TBS use an 
intensity of 80% of Active Motor Threshold while the seizure occurred in a study applying an intensity 
of 100% of Resting Motor Threshold.  
 
Neurophysiological changes may occur and i s the basis of our research. There is evidence that iTBS 
may increase the excitability of the neural pathway projecting to a muscle .[ADDRESS_1182044] injuries, as well as muscle that has 
been altered my upper limb re construction.  
 
In the majority of subjects/patients experiencing local pain during TMS, including toothache, the effect 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_850179]. Headache may occasionally persist, however, after TMS application; in this case, a 
common analgesic administered orall y may be helpful. No migraine attacks have been described 
following repetitive TMS, neither in nonimpaired individuals  nor in migraine patients who underwent 
repetitive TMS applications as t reatment 5. 
 
The devices we will use are labeled as investigational with the following statement: "CAUTION --
Investigational device. Limited by [CONTACT_4496] (or  [LOCATION_002]) law to investigational use.” We will not 
market or promote the device. We will report unanticipated adverse device effects to the IRB, sponsor, 
etc.

 MRI can cause discomfort or anxiety and participants will be screened and accompanied by a  member of 
the research team, as well as observed during MRI scanning.

5. LAY LANGUAGE SUMMARY OR SYNOPSIS (no more than one paragraph)  
The purpose of this study is to determine if known elements of an individual’s genetic makeup has 
any effect on his or her individual ana tomical response to Eylea® (aflibercept). In addition to 
characterizing the subject’s response using measurements of central retinal thickness and presence 
of retinal fluid (as measured by [CONTACT_7349]), we will also be compari ng individual 
visual acuity, presence of angiographic lesions, and number of injections accrued over the [ADDRESS_6629] will also be signal seeking to 
see if different genetic polymorphisms correlate with treatment outcomes.

Incidence and severity of ocular and non -ocular adverse events will be evaluated.  
 
7. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive disease that  causes irreversible visual 
impairment and blindness in nearly 50 million people globally.  Current estimates of patients affected 
with AMD are higher than those affected by [CONTACT_7351]’s disease.  Although geographic atrophy and 
neovascularization represent  the advanced forms of AMD, neovascular AMD is the more aggressive 
form and accounts for almost 90% of blindness from this disease.  It is characterized by [CONTACT_7352] (CNV), which is the development of abnormal blood vessels underneath th e 
retina. Recent randomized clinical trials (VIEW 1, VIEW 2) have conclusively demonstrated that 
continued intravitreal therapy with Intravitreal aflibercept injection in patients with subfoveal CNV from 
AMD leads to stabilization of vision in over 90% of patients and improvement in vision in at least a 
third of the patients and has led to the approval of Intravitreal aflibercept injection (2.0 mg) for the 
treatment of neovascular AMD.  Both Intravitreal aflibercept injection treatment arms (Intravitreal 
aflibercept injection 2 mg administered every 8 weeks following 3 initial monthly doses, or Q 4 weeks 
following 3 initial monthly doses) were shown to have efficacy that was clinically equivalent to existing 
therapy [1].  
 
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)’s mRNA and protein levels are elevated in individuals with 
the neovascular form of ocular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and AMD. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_7344] -VEGF d rugs, the basic pathogenic mechanisms 
remain largely unknown. VEGFA gene serves as a good candidate for testing pharmacogenetic 
relationships between genotypes and therapy outcomes. VEGFA has been reported as a 
 
 
 
Page 4  predisposing gene to AMD [2-4], yet there have been few studies investigating the association 
between VEGFA genotypes and response to anti -VEGF therapy. A recent meta -analysis 
investigating the genetic susceptibility of AMD demonstrated that VEGFA -rs943080 is  in strong 
linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs4711751 (r2 = 1.0 in 1000 Genomes CEU data), which is 
significantly associated with advanced AMD ([OR=1.15 (95% CI: 1.10 -1.21), P = 8.7x10 -9])[3]. In 
preliminary work, we investigated whether there is an association between the response to anti -
VEGF treatment for neovascular AMD and the VEGFA gene, clinical characteristics, demographic 
factors, or comorbidities. We described a significant association between response to anti-VEGF 
therapy and the VEGFA -rs943080 variant. For the rs943080 polymorphism, the poor -responder 
group had a higher frequency of the T allele and TT genotype than the responder group. Lymphocyte 
cells with the VEGFA rs943080 TT genotype had a higher VEG FA expression than cells with the 
VEGFA rs943080 CC genotype, suggesting that VEGFA expression is associated with response to 
anti-VEGF therapy in neovascular AMD (6).  Additionally, we have recently demonstrated that 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and a h aplotype in region of HTRA1 is a major risk factor for 
neovascular AMD. The HTRA1 gene encodes a secreted serine protease. Our study indicates a key 
role for HTRA1 in AMD susceptibility, and identifies a new pathway for neovascular AMD 
pathogenesis [5].  We will investigate the efficacy of Intravitreal aflibercept injection therapy relative to 
CFH, HTRA1, VEGFA, C3, TIMP3, APOE, CETP, LIPC, TGFBR1, CFI, and CFB and other AMD 
candidate gene status.  
 
Patient response to intravitreal aflibercept injection treatment is heterogeneous and currently not well 
understood. Recent data by [CONTACT_7353]. This will likely 
contribute to heterogeneity in anti -VEGF treatment responses.  HTRA1 has also been recently 
demonstrated to play an important role in neovascular AMD and is expressed in retinal vasculature 
as well. The goal of our study is to identif y genetics de terminants of anti -VEGF response.

If the subject dissents, all potential participation is void.   
 
13. ALTERNATIVES TO STUDY PARTICIPATION  
The alternative to participating in the study is to not participate in this study.  
 
14. POTENTIAL RISKS  
Eye Examinati on 
The risks of the eye examination are no different than they would be on a routine visit to the 
ophthalmologist. The drops used to dilate the pupi[INVESTIGATOR_7346], 
increased light sensitivity and glare in bright light, all ergic reaction, and may in rare instances, cause 
a type of glaucoma for which prompt treatment is needed. The pupi[INVESTIGATOR_7347] 4 -6 
hours.  
  
Intravitreal Injection  
The risks of receiving Eylea® treatment or eye exams during this study are no d ifferent than they 
would be if prescribed outside the study.  The safety and tolerability of intravitreal Eylea® injections 
have been investigated in previous Phase I, I/II, III, and IIIb studies in AMD. Potential safety issues 
associated with the route of administration or the pharmacology of Eylea® in the study population 
include decreased BCVA, pain at the injection site, intraocular inflammation, intraocular infection, 
transient and/or sustained elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP), cataract developme nt or 
progression, retinal or intravitreal hemorrhage, macular edema, retinal break or detachment, and 
arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs). Adverse events that should be considered ATEs include, but 
are not limited to, myocardial infarction and cerebrova scular accident (ischemic and hemorrhagic).  
 
Blood Draw and Flu orescein Angiography  
The blood draw may cause slight discomfort and may result in a temporary bruise at the needle site, 
and rarely the possibility of infection. Also, subjects may faint in res ponse to blood draw.  The same 
risks apply to fluorescein angiography, in which a dye is injected into a patient’s vein. The most 
common side effects of this dye are nausea and vomiting; however, occasional allergic reactions and 
fainting may occur.  A seve re allergic reaction would require immediate medical treatment and could 
result in permanent disability or death. Patients will be carefully observed during this procedure to 
minimize the risk to patient health.  
 
Confidentiality  
There is also the potentia l risk of loss of patient confidentiality. It is conceivable that patients may be 
placed at a disadvantage if employers or potential insurers gain access to genetic or other health 
information.  Many precautions will be taken to protect this information.   
 
15. RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES AND ADEQUACY OF RESOURCES  
Blood Draw  
Blood will be drawn by [CONTACT_7355].  
 
Intravitreal Injection  
 
 
 
Page 8  In order to safely monitor these risks, the following procedures will be followed: Following each 
intravitrea l injection of Eylea®, a finger counting  test will be performed for each patient after each 
injection by [CONTACT_099]; hand motion and light perception will be tested when necessary. IOP will 
be measured 15-[ADDRESS_6636] -injecti on IOP increases ≥ 10 mmHg 
compared with the pre -injection measurement, then the IOP measurement will be performed again at 
60 (±10) minutes. If there are no safety concerns up to 60 (±10) minutes following an injection, 
patients will be allowed to leave t he clinic. If any safety concern or immediate toxicity is noted, the 
patient will remain at the clinic and will be treated according to the designated physician’s clinical 
judgment.  2-[ADDRESS_6637] may decide that the patient  should come to th e clinic for additional eye examinations 
and treatment, if necessary.  
 
Study drug administration will be held at the investigator’s discretion if he or she suspects any safety 
or other issues. If the investigator decides to hold a dose, the reason will be recorded on the source 
documents. In the event a subject experiences an adverse event in the study eye that is considered 
by [CONTACT_7356], consideration should be given to 
holding treatment or discontinuin g the patient from study treatment. This decision will be at the 
investigator’s discretion and should be recorded on the source documents.  
 
Early Withdrawal  
Patients withdrawn from the study prior to completion will be asked to return for an early termina tion 
evaluation 30 days ( ± 7 days) following their last injection for monitoring of all adverse events 
(serious and non -serious; ocular and non -ocular) as well as for final study visit assessments.  
 
  
16. PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY CONSIDERATIONS INCLU DING DATA ACCESS AND MANAGEMENT  
Patients are evaluated in a private room in regular clinic. Access to the patient is limited by [CONTACT_7357]. In order to maintain subject privacy, all study personnel will not share information with 
patients about t heir care or progress unless they are in a private, secure area.  Patient information in 
paper form is kept in locked filing cabinets. All electronic information is kept on password -protected 
computers. Patient identifiers are removed and arbitrary numbers  are assigned to materials that are 
shared with sources involved in the study. In order to maintain patient confidentiality any person who 
has access to or maintains patient records will ensure that confidentiality will be maintained at all 
times by [CONTACT_7358] g all records under their control or in locked cabinets.  All study staff are HIPAA 
trained.  
 
 
17. POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
This study primarily benefit  researchers  and the field of Ophthalmology  with a better  understand ing of  
AMD pathogenesis.  Patients who participate in the study will receive ophthalmological care and an 
investigational drug, which may or may not result in a benefit to their ocular health.  
 
18. RISK/BENEFIT RATIO  
The risks of receiving Eylea® treatment during this study are no different than they would be if your 
doctor prescribed it for you outside the study.  Soreness or bruising at the site of needle insertion 
may occur at the needle site, and rarely the possibility of infection.

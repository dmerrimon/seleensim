This study will evaluate whether a standardized geriatric assessment (GA)i administered through a novel web-
based approach can facilitate communication of age- related problems that could influence outcomes important to 
the older cancer patient and his/her caregivers.ii  Adults, age > 70 with an advanced solid tumor malignancy in the 
University of [COMPANY_002]ster Cancer Center NCI Community Oncology Program (UR CC NCORP) network will be 
eligible.  Oncology p hysicians who practice at sites within the UR CC NCORP  network are eligible to participate in 
the study and will be enrolled.  Their eligible patients will then undergo the informed consent process; those 
patients who agree to participate in this study will undergo a clinical assessment consisting of sociodemographic 
characteristics and GA.  Eligible patients should choose one caregiver to participat e.   
 
 NCORP practice sites with IRB approval of the protocol will be randomized to receipt of GA plus GA-driven 
recommendations (A rm 1) or usual care (A rm 2).  A NCORP  practice site will be defined as any  practice location 
within an overarching NCORP  designation where oncology physicians and study staff work independently (e.g., 
do not cross over into another practice  site).  In Arm 1, oncology physicians, patients, and caregivers will be 
provided with GA summary  plus targeted recommendations (i.e., GA -driven recommendations). In Arm 2, patients 
will complete GA, but no GA summary or GA-driven recommendations will be provided to the oncology teams 
except for information regarding clinically significant cognitive impairment and/or depression.  A brief follow -up 
GA will be collected at [ADDRESS_455754] office visit with the oncology physician after GA will be audio -recorded (to measure number 
of concerns brought up by [CONTACT_364885]), and measures of quality of life and satisfaction will be collected at 4-6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after 
baseline registration .  The primary outcome, patient satisfaction regarding communication about age -related issues 
as measured by a modified Health Care Climate Questionnaire (HCCQ), will be obtained via a phone call 
                                                 
i Geriatric assessment (GA) is a compi[INVESTIGATOR_364866] -based and assessment tools to assess geriatric domains such as 
comorbidity, functional status, nutrition,  physical performance, cognition, and social support, which measures aging related 
issues that can affect the quality of life of an older patient with cancer.  GA can better predict tolerance to cancer treatm ent and 
adds important age -related information t hat is not routinely captured by [CONTACT_339473].  
 
ii For purposes of this study, a caregiver is defined as a valued and trusted person in a patient’s life who is supportive in he alth 
care matters by [CONTACT_90378]/or direct assistive car e. The caregiver accompanies the patient to 
medical appointments, is able to listen and give thoughtful advice and may be a family member, partner, friend, or 
professional caregiver.  

URCC13070 Protocol 2017 -04-25     Page 5 of 56 administered by [CONTACT_21724], the Telephone Team, who are blinded to group assignment, within 1 to 7 days 
of the baseline audio-recorded clinic consultation, hereby [CONTACT_364886].  If a telephone 
call is not fe asible, the HCCQ will be mailed with a return envelope provided.   Caregivers will complete measures 
of satisfaction, and  caregiver burden  (both health and economic) at the same time poin ts.  However, caregivers will 
not receive the  Telephone Team C all. 
 
A total of 5 28 patients  and 528 caregivers (maximum) will be enrolled in the study . 
 
The acronym for this study is COACH, which stands for Communication On Aging and Cancer Health. 
 
1.  BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
 1.1. Intervention  to be Studied 
The URCC NCORP Research Base will conduct a cluster randomized study evaluating whether providing a GA 
summary with targeted recommendations (i.e., GA- driven recommendations) to older patients with advanced 
cancer, their caregivers, and their oncology physicians can improve patient satisfaction with communication 
about age-related issues and concerns.  Secondary aims will determine if the intervention  increases discussions 
about age -related issues du ring a clinic consultation, improves patient-reported quality of lif e, and improves 
caregiver burden and caregiver  satisfaction with communication.
1,2   
 
1.2.  Background and Significance  
Older adults with cancer and their caregivers are presented with complex information regarding the risks and 
benefits of treatment for advanced cancer, but age- related concerns and outcomes are not usually discussed.3  
Outcomes important to the older adult with cancer include not only tumor shrinkage and progression- free survival 
(which are traditionally measured in clinical trials), but also the effect of treatment on health -related quality o f life 
(HRQoL) and geriatric domains.[ADDRESS_455755] geriatric 
domains (e.g., independence, mood, cognition).  Our preliminary data has also shown that incorporating GA, a validated patient -centered approach to the assessment of underlying health status, into the clinical decision making 
process for older patients with cancer is feasible and helps t o identify conditions (normally overlooked in routine 
oncology care) that are rated as very important to older patients and caregivers.
4-[ADDRESS_455756] patient- centered outcomes, 
morbidity, and mortality in the older patient.8  Significant gaps in knowl edge regarding cancer treatment in older 
and/or vulnerable adults led to the formation of the Cancer and Aging Research Group (CARG),9 a coalition of 
geriatric oncology researchers and older patient advocates, working together towards improving clinical care for older adults with cancer.  In 2010, CARG received a U13 grant (U13 AG038151), in collaboration with the NCI 
and NIA, to conduct and disseminate findings from 3 conferences over 5 years on “Geriatric Oncology Research to 
Improve Clinical Care.”
3,8,[ADDRESS_455757] U13 conference identified the need to incorporate GA into clinical care to 
facilitate communication regarding the risks and benefits of cancer treatment for older patients with cancer plus other age-related health status conditions.
8  
 
1.3.  Condition to be Studied  
A growing population of older patients is at high risk 
for adverse o utcomes from cancer treatment .  Cancer 
is a disease of aging; approximately 60% of all 
cancers and 70% of cancer mortality occur in persons 
aged 65 years and over.11  The number of cancer 
patients over the age of 65 is projected to significantly 
increase over the next 20 years (see Figure 1).[ADDRESS_455758] decision making for 
cancer treatment, treatment tolerance, and ultimately 
outcomes.3,13,14 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_364867] 1:   Increase in older patients with cancer  
URCC13070 Protocol [ADDRESS_455759] a high prevalence of comorbidity, disability, and geriatric syndromes.15,16  The majority of older 
patients with cancer are treated based on extrapolations of evidence derived from clinical trials providing data on 
the safety and efficacy of treatment in younger adults or in older patients who are fit without other health status 
conditions.17  
 1.4.  Geriatric Assessment  (GA) 
GA is a validated mechanism to obtain patient-reported information about issues important to the older adult 
including function (i.e., ability to remain independent in self-care and community), psychological status, cognitive 
abilities, social support, and the impact of medical problems on quality of life.  In our team’s research, geriatric 
domains captured on GA are the most important outcomes for older patients with cancer, more so than traditional 
oncology outcomes (such as tumor response, progression- free survi val).  The results from our pi[INVESTIGATOR_364868] (see Preliminary Data, Table 1) are consistent with another study that demonstrated that 
older patients may forgo life- sustaining measures if they will have a significant impact on functio n and cognition.
18 
 
1.5.  Geriatric Assessment Components and Relevance to Older Patients with Cancer  
GA provides valuable information that could identify and help address the concerns of older patients with cancer 
and their caregivers.  A description of each GA domain and its relevance to the older patient with cancer is provided below.  
 
1.5.1.  Functional Status and Physical Performance:   The need for functional assistance (measured by 
[CONTACT_364887]) is predictive of chemotherapy toxicity and survival.
19-22 Physical 
performance measures objectively evaluate mobility and fall risk.23,24 Falls are common in cancer patients and 
predictive of adverse outcomes.1,16,25  
 1.5.2.  Comorbidity and Polypharmacy:   Among patients with cancer, comorbidity is associated with poorer 
overall survival.
26-30  Comorbidity impacts cancer treatment tolerance.31-34  Furthermore, these comorbid 
conditions may predispose patients to the risks of polypharmacy and drug interactions.35 
 1.5.3.  Nutrition:  Poor nutritional status is associated with an increased need for functional assistance and 
poorer overall survival in the geriatric population.
36  Unintentional weight loss during the 6 months prior to 
chemotherapy is associated with lower chemotherapy response rates and lower overall survival.37  
1.5.4.  Cognition:   A cognitive assessment is needed to determine if the patient has the decisional capacity to 
consent and adhere to supportive care medication instructions and understand the indications to seek attention.  In the presence of cognitive impairment, the involv ement of the patient’s family or caregiver is required to 
maintain safety.
38-41 
 1.5.5.  Psychological State and Social Support :  In a study of older adults with cancer, significant distress 
was identified in 41% of older adults, and poorer physical function correlated with higher distress.
41  In both 
the geriatric and oncology literature, social isolation has been li nked to an increased risk of mortality.42-44    
 
The evidence suggests that although underlying health status issues and deficits in geriatric domains correlate 
directly with toxicity of therapy and patient- centered outcomes, these considerations are not addressed in  routine 
oncology clinical care.3,8 Although the commonly used Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) and Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) measures do correlate with treatment toxicity, 
these tools were validated in younger groups of patients and do not reliably predict outcomes in older adults with 
cancer.45-47 GA, a compi[INVESTIGATOR_364869], functional status, 
nutrition, physical performance, cognition, and social support, can help define the “stage of aging.”[ADDRESS_455760] tolerance to treatment2,49,50 and adds important age -related information that are not captured by [CONTACT_364888].51  A CARG study (Hurria and Mohile, et al.) found that several GA 
variables predicted severe chemotherapy toxicities in older patients.[ADDRESS_455761] not 
URCC13070 Protocol 2017 -04-25     Page 7 of 56 generally included GA.  Successful completion of this research has the potential to incorporate communication of 
GA results into the clinical care of older adults with advanced cancer.   
 
1.6.  Gap in Knowledge  
There is a critical gap in knowledge regardin g how to improve communication about age- related concerns 
between older adults with cancer, their caregivers, and oncolog y physicians .54-56 The use of health -related 
quality of life (HRQoL) assessments in clinical practice has been shown to monitor disease and treatment, 
improve the delivery of care, and detect physical or psychosocial problems that otherwise might be 
overlooked.57,[ADDRESS_455762] shown that the implement ation of GA-
driven recommendations into the clinical care of older patients with cancer is feasible.4-7  The ELCAPA study 
illustrated th at providing GA informat ion to oncology teams can influence treatment decisions, although outcomes 
from these interventions were not measured in this study.5  Another pi[INVESTIGATOR_364870].53  In a study by [CONTACT_364889].,64 geriatric nurse practitioners conducted GA with cancer 
patients, which led to a survival advantage (67% in the intervention group compared with 40% in the control 
group) and improved HRQoL.  In a study by [CONTACT_96549]., breast cancer patients in the GA-driven 
recommendations group were significantly more likely to return to normal functioning than controls.65  Different 
approaches for chemotherapy selection and dosing for older and/or frail patients are supported by [CONTACT_364890] o the framework as GA-driven recommendations.  For example, the FOCUS-2 trial found that 
chemotherapy for advanced colorectal cancer was safe and efficacious in the older and/or frail patient if started at a 20% dose reduction with escalation as tolerated.
[ADDRESS_455763] experience in the study of communication in oncology.   Other investigators 
URCC13070 Protocol 2017 -04-25     Page 8 of 56 lend significant interdisciplinary expertise and stakeholders (CARG , an advisory board of  older patients with 
cancer, advocates and caregivers, and community oncology physicians) have provided significant input at all 
stages of preliminary work.   
 
Of importance, [CONTACT_364932] and [CONTACT_96600] collaborate on a NCI-funded study (R01 NIH/ 1R01CA140419-
01A1), which evaluates whether a communication coaching interv ention that targets  oncology physicians, patients 
and caregivers improves discussions regarding prognosis and treatment choices in advanced cancer.  The primary 
outcome for this study ( physician communication behaviors) was  obtained from clinic consultations that are audio-
recorded.  The patients (n=81 older patients) also completed a measure of patient satisfaction (Health Care Climate Questionnaire), which provided preliminary data for sample size calculations for the current proposal as the 
primary outcome.   
 
1.8.1.  Prevalence of Health Status Issues in Older Patients with Cancer.   Using a nationally representative 
population- based database, Mohile and collaborators published two investigations  that demonstrated that 
disability, comorbidity, and geriatric syndromes are more common in cancer patients than in those without 
cancer and that cancer was independently associated with having these conditions.
15,[ADDRESS_455764] been detected from a visit’s 
routine history and physical exam.  For ex ample, 41% of patients needed assistance with instrumental 
activities of daily living despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a mean physician -reported KPS of 85 out of 100; 16% had recent falls, and 6% 
had severe cognitive impairment on the cognitive screening test.  
 
1.8.2.  Feasibility of a Geriatric Assessment for Older Adults with Cancer.7,54 The geriatric and oncology 
literature was reviewed to choose validated GA measures.  Selection criteria included reliability, validity, 
brevity, the ability to self -administer, and the ability to prognosticate risk for morbidity or mortality in an older 
patient.7 The final selection of measures was approved by [CONTACT_364891] B (CALGB) 
Cancer in the Elderly and Quality of Life Committees.  The  initial feasibility study of this tool was conducted 
in a multicenter study by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Hurria and [CONTACT_96600].  Forty patients (mean age 74, range 65 to 87) with cancer 
participated in the study.  The GA was feasible, as demonstrated by a mean time to completion of 27 minutes; 
90% of patients were satisfied with the questionnaire length, and 78% were able to comple te it on their own.7 
Subsequently, CALGB 360401 evaluated the feasibility of incorporating the GA into oncology cooperative group trials for older adults (n=93).
[ADDRESS_455765] Chemotherapy Toxicity?
1 The primary objective of Drs. 
Hurria and Mohile’s  previous study was to determine if GA measures predicted grade 3 -5 toxicity (severe) 
using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, V3.0).  Among the 500 enrollees, 
the mean age was 73 years (range 65 -91); 61% had metastatic disease and 71% re ceived 1st line 
chemotherapy.  Grade 3 -5 toxicity occurred in 53% (50% grade 3, 12% grade 4, 2% grade 5).  Risk factors for 
severe toxicity included:  1) age ≥ 73, 2) cancer type (GI or GU), 3) standard dose, 4) poly- chemotherap y and 
the following GA measures,  5) falls in  the last 6 months, 6) assistance with instrumental activities of daily 
living, and 7) decreased social activity.   
 
1.8.4.  Feasibility of Intervention Proposed in the Study, Contribution of Stakeholders, and Impact on 
Clinical Care .[ADDRESS_455766]. Mohile directs a referral -based consultative Specialized Oncology Care in the Elderly 
(SOCARE) clinic which has collected pi[INVESTIGATOR_364871], outcomes, and GA-driven 
interventions in over 200 older patients with cancer (Table 1).71  All measures and the GA intervention in this 
proposal are utilized within the SOCARE clinic.  Patients were referred to the clinic by [CONTACT_364892].  As routine in the clinic, each patient completes GA by [CONTACT_155353], and summaries of results are provided to the patient and his/her caregivers.  Ratings of each GA domain and acceptability/understanding of 
the GA summaries are as sessed.  GA -driven recommendations, developed by [CONTACT_364893], are provided 
to the referring  oncology physician, the patient, and his/her caregivers.  Patient characteristics:   Mean age was 
82.1 (70-95) and 75% had advanced disease.  GA revealed 68% with functional impairment; 70% had >3 
significant comorbidities; 39% had poor nutrition;72 26% screened positive for depression;73 59% reported 
URCC13070 Protocol 2017 -04-25     Page 9 of 56 inadequate social support; 20% had an abnormal cognition screen (but had decision making capacity);74 34% 
had recently fallen, and 60% had poor physical performance.23,75 Acceptability of summaries:   We have 
developed and revised the GA summaries based on extensive qualitative and written feedback from the 
patients and their caregivers.  The summaries include a description of the test used to assess the domain in lay 
language, an interpretation of the score for each domain, and a list of interventions to consider if the score 
signifies impairment.  Acceptability of GA -driven recommendations:   On average, 80% of the GA-driven 
recommendations were implemented by [CONTACT_364894] 6 interventions 
per patient (range 3 -15).   
 1.8.5.
  The research team has experience with the assessment of patient -physician communication (using 
audio-recordings, surveys, and chart reviews) in the setting of advanced cancer.   [CONTACT_10785], an expert in 
patient-centered communication and co-investigator on this study, has conducted multi- method research to 
study patient -physician interactions using analyses of patient and physician surveys and medical record 
audits.[ADDRESS_455767]. Epstein’s NCI -funded 
RO1 ([CONTACT_96600] is a co-investigator) have been adapted for patients with advanced cancer.67,68   
Using two trained coders, we examined the audio-recorded interactions between the older patients (n=32) with 
advanced cancer and their  oncology physicians (at 8 different sites) to assess number of discussions related to 
geriatric domains brought up by [CONTACT_109796]/or caregiver that were addressed by [CONTACT_364895] y physician and 
the number of “missed opportunities” (i.e., concerns brought up by [CONTACT_364896]).  We found that at baseline, there were 26 discussions and 26 
missed opportunities among 32 audio- recorded visits.  Fifty percent of visits had 0 age -related discussions; the 
median was 1 (range 1 -3).  The majority of missed opportunities were related to functional ability (e.g., not 
taking medicines correctly), physical functioning (e.g., inability to climb stairs, falls), social support (e.g., 
difficulty getting to appointments), and medications (e.g., polypharmacy, drug interactions).  This study was 
not elderly specific and did not incorporate GA (which can identify deficits as described above), but the results provide an estimate of the baseline number of discussions about age- related issues that occur in usual care 
within oncology.  We were able to utilize this data to help gather usual care information to inform our analytic 
plan.   
 
[CONTACT_364933], Chief of Geriatrics and Palliative Care at the University of Chicago, has expertise in medical 
decision making, quality of life, and frailty and has studied the role of emotions in decisions about screening, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer in older persons.  He and [CONTACT_96600] have collaborated on a study that evaluated patient- physician decisions with regard to  the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.
[ADDRESS_455768] with expertise in qualitative methods ( in-depth 
interviewing, cognitive interviewing, focus groups, Delphi techniques, etc.) and survey methods (questionnaire 
design), has significant expertise in the administration and collection of patient -reported outcomes via 
telephone.  The University of C hicago team, which is funded through a PCORI subcontract, will be blinded to 
group assignment and will be able to administer and collect the primary aim as the Telephone Team .  
 
1.9.  Conceptual Model Highlighting Relevance of Topic to Older Patients and Caregivers.   
In 2007, the NCI published a monograph, co-authored by [CONTACT_6283]. Epstein and Street, Patient-Centered 
Communication in Cancer Care, which reviewed 2200 relevant communication studies.67  The monograph 
includes a conceptual framework that has been adapted for this study (Figure 2).  
 
1.9.1.  Patient-centered care.   Patient-centered care considers the patient’s unique experience of illness as 
equal in importance  to the physician’s disease/diagnostic perspective; it directs clinicians to see the world 
both through the patient’s eyes  as well as through a clinical lens.68,69 There is general agreement that patient-
centered care:  1) explores and validates patients’ individual experiences of suffering and their needs, 
expectations and values; 2) offers patients opportunities to provide input into and part icipate in their care; and 
3) enhances partnership, shared understanding, and trust in the patient- physician relationship.  
 
URCC13070 Protocol [ADDRESS_455769]/Epstein “Ecologic al Model” of patient -centered communication.70 It is an interactional model .  In 
health-care settings, effective communication is characterized by:   
 
1.9.2a.  Informed, activated, participatory, and communicative patients and caregivers .  Activated 
patients and caregivers express their concerns and participate  actively in decisions. Providing GA 
information to patients and their caregivers could facilitate “activation.”  We will measure participation in 
the encounter through direct observation and measure the quality of the patient- clinician relationship using 
surveys. 
 
1.9.2b.  Informed, receptive, patient -centered, and communicative clinicians.   Clinician patient-
centered behaviors include organizing the visit to elicit patients’ concerns, raising issues often ignored in 
clinical consultations, and responding to patients’ concerns with information and empathy.  We can 
observe the degree to which oncology physicians explore and validate patients’ and caregivers’ concerns 
about age-related conditions.  Patients and caregivers will  report on the degree to which they felt included 
in discussions regarding their care.

1.10.  Study Subjects  
The study involves adult human subjects.   
NCORP practice sites will be randomized within a 2-arm cluster randomized design  utilizing NCORP practice 
sites as the unit of randomization.  A NCORP  practice site will be defined as any practice location within an 
overarching NCORP designation where oncology physicians and study staff work independently (i.e ., do not cross 
over into another practice  site).   
 Study subjects will include:  
• Oncology physician s at NCORP practice sites 
 
• Patients will complete surveys and will also agree to have a clinical consultation with an oncolog y physician  
audio-recorded (baseline visit ).  Patients will  have advanced cancer and various levels of functional status.  
Patients will be asked to identify a caregiver who may choose to participate in the study.  As much as possible, 
caregivers should be recruited to be part of the study when the patient is recruited.  In the rare circumstance that there is no willing caregiver to participate, the patient will be allowed to participate without a caregiver.   
 
• Caregivers must enroll in the study before or on the baseline visit because they will accompany the patient s 
during the clinic consultation that will be audio -recorded (baseline)  and complete surveys .   
 
URCC13070 Protocol 2017 -04-25     Page 12 of 56 2.  STUDY OBJECTIVE S  
 
This is a cluster randomized study within the  URCC NCORP network evaluating whether GA summary plus GA -
driven recommendations can improve patient satisfaction with communication regarding age- related issues 
between patients, oncology physicians, and caregivers.  The study has received support from the Patient Centered 
Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) under their “Communicatio n and Dissemination” portfolio.  In addition, the 
National Cancer Institute (NCI) review was required which led to changes in the aims and statistical plan.   The 
NCI review led to a new primary aim (satisfaction with communication regarding age -related issues) and the 
original PCORI primary aim (discussions about age- related issues during clinic consultation) became Secondary 
Aim 1.   
 
2.1.  Primary Aim (primary aim as specified by [CONTACT_6812]) : To determine if providing geriatric assessment  (GA) 
summary plus GA-driven recommendations to patients, their caregivers and oncology physicians improves 
patient satisfaction with communication with the oncolog y physician  regarding age -related concerns.  
 Primary hypothesis:  Patient satisfaction with communication  with the oncology physician  about age -related issues 
will be significantly higher in the intervention group compared to the control group.    
The NCI primary outcome, patient satisfaction regarding communication about age- related issues as measured 
by a modified Health Care Climate Questionnaire (HCCQ- age), will be obtained via the Telephone Team Call, 
a phone call administered by [CONTACT_364897] 1 to 7 days  of the baseline 
audio-recorded clinic consultation.    The HCCQ -age will be mailed (with a return envelope) if a telephone call 
is not feasible.   If the responses to the survey are not able to be obtained before the 4 -6 week assessment, the 
HCCQ-age at 4-6 weeks will be utilized.   
  
2.2. Secondary Aims  
 
2.2.1. Secondary Aim 1 (primary aim as specified by [CONTACT_631]):  To determine if providing GA summary plus 
GA-driven recommendations to patients, their caregivers, and oncology physician s increases discussions  about 
age-related issues during clinic consultation.  
 
Hypothesis:  A higher proportion of age -related issues will be discussed and addressed in the intervention 
group.   
 
The outcome measure for this aim is the number of age-related discussions related to the different aspects of 
geriatric assessment that occur in the consultation clinic visit between the patient,  oncology physician, and 
caregiver.  The clinic visit will be audio-recorded.  This outcome was accepted as the primary aim by [CONTACT_631].   
 
2.2.2.  Secondary Aim 2:   To determine whether initially  providing patients, their caregivers, and oncology 
physicians with GA summary plus GA-driven recommendations prior to their treatment influences quality of 
life of older patients receiving treatment  and their caregivers . 
 
2.2.3.  Secondary Aim 3 :  To determine whether providing patients, their caregivers, and oncology physician s 
with GA summary plus GA- driven recommendations influences caregiver satisfaction  with communication  
about age -related issues.  
 2.3.  Exploratory Aims :     
Exploratory aims will evaluate (1) whether the number of discussions about age- related issues during the clinic 
visit correlates with patient satisfaction, (2) whether the intervention increases the proportion of age- related 
concerns that are acknowledged and addressed, and  (3)  if communication about age- related issues influences how 
patients, caregivers, and oncology physicians make decisions for cancer treatment.    An additional exploratory aim will examine the impact of the intervention on survival.

3.  STUDY DESIGN  
 
See Study Schema and Design for summary.  
 
3.1.  Choice of comparators    
Because GA is not performed by [CONTACT_364898] s and this study ultimately will allow 
patients/caregivers/ oncology physicians to choose their cancer treatments, a usual care comparator arm is 
appropriate and will allow for the accurate and appropriate assessment of how the intervention can improve 
communication about age -related issues and outcomes compared to current clinical practice.  This study design is 
similar to previous studies that evaluated the impact of providing summarized HRQoL information to patients and oncology physicians on com munication and outcomes.  Usual care was the comparator arm in these cluster 
randomized studies.
57,81 
 
3.2.  Choice of study design    
The study is designed as a cluster randomized trial because a care o f service model is applied to each patient by [CONTACT_364899].  If a cluster randomized design were not undertaken, there would be contamination in that 
oncology physicians could choose the care of service model if they were exposed to patients randomized to both 
arms.  Given rapid changes that can occur in oncology practice with new supportive care and treatment agents, it is 
important to compare outcomes in the same time frame as would be possible in a cluster randomized study design 
compared to a “pre” versus “post” intervention study design.  
 
4.  PARTI CIPANT ELIGIBILITY  
 
4.1.  Entry Criteria for Oncology Physicians  
Oncology physicians must work at a NCORP practice site with no plans to leave that NCORP practice or retire 
at the time of enrollment  into the study.   
 
4.2.  Entry Criteria for Patients  
   
4.2.1.  Inclusion Criteria for Patient s 
 
4.2.1a.  Male or female 70 years of age or  older 
 
4.2.1b.  Diagnosis of an advanced solid tumor malignancy  (advanced cancer) or lymphoma .  In most 
situations, this would be a stage IV cancer.  A patient with  a diagnosis of stage III cancer or lymphoma is 
eligible if cure is not possible or anticipated.  Clinical staging without pathological confirmation of 
advanced disease is allowed.    
 
Must be considering or currently receiving any kind of cancer treatment (any line) , including but not 
limited to hormonal treatment, chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, or targeted therapy. Patients 
who are considering therapy are eligible even if they ultimately choose not to be on therapy. P atients with 
a history of any previous cancer treatment, including radiation and/or surgery are eligible.  A patient may 
also be enrolled on a treatment trial and participate in this study, if all other inclusion and exclusion criteria 
are met.   
 
4.2.1c.  Have at least one geriatric assessment domain meet the cut -off score for impairment  other than 
polypharmacy per Table 2. 
 
4.2.1d.  Have visits planned with the oncolog y physician  for at least [ADDRESS_455770] 
decision-making capacity, a patient-des ignated health care proxy (per institutional policies) must  sign 
consent by [CONTACT_23760]. 
 
4.2.1f.  Subject has adequate understanding of the English language because not all GA measures have 
been validated in other languages.  
4.2.2.  Exclusion Criteria for Patients  
 
4.2.2a.  Have surgery planned within [ADDRESS_455771] already made a decision to not undergo any cancer treatment (e.g., being followed in best 
supportive care or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125]).     
  
4.3.  Entry Criteria for Caregivers  
A caregiver can be anyone, age [ADDRESS_455772] be chosen by [CONTACT_4677].  For the purposes of this study, a caregiver is defined as a valued and trusted person in a patient’s life who 
is supportive in health care matters by [CONTACT_90378]/or direct assistive care.  The caregiver 
accompanies the patient to medical appointments, is able to listen and give thoughtful advice and may be a family 
member, partner, friend, or professional caregiver.
 
 
4.3.1. Inclusion Criteria for Caregivers  
 
4.3.1a.  Selected by [CONTACT_24200] a “family member, partner, friend or caregiver [age 
21 or older] with whom you discuss or who can be helpful in health-related matters;”  patients who cannot 
identify such a person (“caregiver”) can be eligible for the study. A caregiver need not be someone who 
lives with the patient or provides direct hands- on care.  A caregiver can be any person who provides 
support (in any way) to the patient.   
 
4.3.1b.  If a health care proxy signs consent for or with a patient, and wants to participate in the caregiver 
portion of the study, this same person will always be the caregiver selected.  If a health care proxy does not 
want to enroll as a caregiver in the study or, if enrolled, chooses to stop their own participation in the 
caregiver portion of the study, but is able to assist the patient in completing the study, the patient can still 
participate.  In other words , the health care proxy can choose NOT to participate in the caregiver portion of 
the study.  This does not preclude the patient from participating in the patient portion of the study with the health care proxy’s assistance.   
 
4.3.2.  Exclusion Criteria for Caregivers  
 
4.3.2a.  Caregivers unable to understand the consent form due to cognitive, health, or sensory impairment 
will be excluded.  
 
 
5.  IDENTIFICATION, RECRUITMENT, AND CONSENT PROCEDURES   
 
Patients and their caregivers will be recruited from the outpatient community oncology practices affiliated with the URCC NCORP Research Base network.   The results of this study will be generalizable to the majority of older 
adults with cancer and their caregivers because it will include older cancer patients and their caregivers from diverse backgrounds and at varying health statuses.  
 5.1.  Study Participants (Patients and Caregivers)  
URCC13070 Protocol 2017 -04-25     Page 15 of 56 Study participants will be identified by [CONTACT_96556] s, who enroll in the study, the nurses that 
work with the  enrolled oncology physicians, and the clinical research associates (CRAs).  Th e CRAs will work 
closely with the enrolled oncology physicians and nurses to  identify patients aged [ADDRESS_455773] with the CRA  and signing it .  The oncology 
physician or CRA will introduce the study to the eligible patients and/or their designated  health care 
proxies/caregivers, and will provide them with an IRB approved study brochure and consent to review.  Adequate 
time will be provided to the patient and/or the designated health care proxy to read the consent.  By  [CONTACT_159753], the 
patient should have selected a possible caregiver.  The CRA , the oncology physician, and the nurses  are available 
to answer any questions the patient and/or caregiver/healthcare proxy may have about any aspect of the study prior 
to consenting and throughout the entire study period.  Patients and/or their designated health care proxies and 
caregivers may choose to sign the appropriate (patient or caregiver) informed consent documents immediately on 
the day the study information is presented to them or they may choose to take the consent forms home and discuss 
them with others ; then if they d ecide to participate in the study, they can provide signed consent forms the next 
time they meet with the CRA or oncology physician.   
 
5.1.1.  Informed consent will be obtained from the patient, unless they lack capacity to provide consent.  If a 
patient lacks capacity, a health care proxy will be required to sign consent per institutional or local policies on 
consent for incapacitated/decisionally impaired subjects.  If the patient does not have an appointed health care 
proxy on or before the baseline visit , he/she will not be enrolled onto the study.  All consent documents will be 
signed by [CONTACT_5363]/or designated health care proxy and maintained in the patient record with copi[INVESTIGATOR_364872]/or designated health care proxy.  
5.1.2.  The screening measures will then be performed.  Those with a diagnosis of dementia, as noted in their 
medical recor d or diagnosed by a physician, or who meet the cut -off score for impairment on the cognitive 
screen  (score of 11 or more on Blessed Orientation- Memory-Concentration Scale) can be included if a 
designated health care proxy selected by [CONTACT_364900].  The goal of the intervention is to 
improve outcomes of older cancer patients with all underlying hea lth conditions including cognitive issues.  
Therefore we will include these patients and will conduct the assessments with assistance of the proxy.  The 
health care proxy should agree to participate in the study as the caregiver.  If a health care proxy ch ooses to 
stop their own participation in the study, but is able to assist the patient in completing the study, the patient can 
still participate.  
5.1.3.  Ethical standards for human subjects will be strictly followed in accordance with local policies and/or 
institutional r eview board requirements on the enrollment of a dult decisionally incapacitated research subjects 
and permission of authorized r epresentatives.  
5.1.4.  Current, state, federal, and institutional regulations conc erning informed consent will be followed.  
Participation in this study is voluntary.  Participants are free not to take part or to withdraw at any time, for 
whatever reason, without risking loss of present or future care they would otherwise expect to rece ive.  In the 
event that a patient does withdraw from the study, the information they have already provided will be kept in a confidential manner.  Data will be used unless permission is revoked in writing and  sent to their oncology 
physician or the URCC study team.  Site oncology physician s will be d irected to forward any such 
correspondence to the URCC Research Base. 
 
5.2.  Oncology Physician Recruitment  
Because oncology physicians are being recruited and enrolled from sites across the country  by [CONTACT_364901] , oncology physicians will read and agree to participate either via Research Electronic Data Capture 
(REDCap) or on paper if REDCap is not a feasible option.  REDCap is a software toolset (see Section 16.3 for 
more information) f or electronic collection and management of research and  clinical trial data devel oped by 
[CONTACT_50222].  Oncology physicians will be enrolled prior to enrolling (screening registration) their first 
eligible patient.   Staff from the U RCC Research Base (including the PI) will be available to answer any questions 
the oncology physicians may have over the phone.   Procedures for the oncology physicians are minimal risk and 
involve:  completing surveys that will be de -identified , and identifying patients for the study.  
URCC13070 Protocol 2017 -04-25     Page 16 of 56  
Oncology physicians will provide baseline demographic information, fill out a baseline survey that evaluates 
preference s for decision-making, and help identify their own patients who may be eligible for the study. The 
baseline survey can be completed online via REDCap or on paper if REDCap is not f easible.  REDCap will 
securely store the oncology physician’s email address for surveys.  In addition to the email address, the only 
personal identifying information the oncology physicians will provide will be their  name, age, ethnicity, and the 
name [CONTACT_96596].  The oncology physician will be assigned an ID number, which will be used to 
link their surveys together with those of patients enrolled in the study.  
 The oncology physician also will agree to have one visit per each patient audio -recorded (baseline) .  All parties 
present for recorded office visits, including:  enrolled patients , any accompanying caregivers, family or friends, the 
oncology physician , and any other physicians or health care providers not participating in the study will be fully 
aware that the conversation is being audio -recorded and will provide verbal assent immediately before any 
recording begins, in addition to the prior written consent of enrolled subjects.  These audio-recording s will be 
labeled and stored using the patient’s initials and date.   
 The participation of oncology physicians in the research study meets criteria for “waiver of documentation of 
consent” because the research involves no more than minimal risk to the oncology physicians and there are no 
procedures for the oncology physician s that would normally require written consent outside of the research 
context.

7.  OUTCOMES  
 
The outcomes of this study were informed by [CONTACT_364903] -related issues as very important.  
 7.1.  NCI -specified Primary Outcome  
The Health Care Climate Questionnaire (HCCQ) 
82-85 measures patient -centered autonomy-supportive physician 
behaviors and satisfaction with communication such as whether the pati ent and caregiver feel that the physician 
understands his/her perspective, provides choices and options, and encourages participation in decisions.  The 
measure has been studied and validated in older patients.  Similar to other studies which adapt satisfa ction scales to 
capture specific clinical criteria (e.g., satisfaction with the physician regarding communication about 
chemotherapy),86 the HCCQ has been modified for this study (HCCQ -age) to specifically address patient 
satisfaction with oncology physician behaviors and communication regarding age- related issues and concerns in 
order to specifically address satisfaction with the intervention (geriatric assessment summary and recommendations) rather than satisfaction with other aspects of cancer care (e.g., communication about cancer 
treatment).   As is done with satisfaction with care surveys in other research and in clinical settings, the HCCQ 
(both modified and original) will be administered within 1 to 7 days  after the baseline audio-recorded clinic visit.
87-
90  These measures will be obtained  via a phone call administered by [CONTACT_21724] (or mailed if a telephone 
call within 2 weeks of the baseline visit is not feasible) .  If this is not completed , the 4-[ADDRESS_455775] . Our University of Chicago collaborators (Dale and Gorawara-Bhatt) have experience with 
the conduct of such assessments over the phone and this minimizes perceived or real influence from the oncology 
physician or Research Base .  The University of Chicago collaborators and research staff, who are subcontracted 
through PCORI, will be blinded to group assignment as the Telephone Team .  Press-Ganey measures of 
satisfaction of overall care will be collected at week [ADDRESS_455776]. Epstein’s research team has extensive experience
76,85 with the use of the HCCQ and has captured this measure 
in 81 patients similar to those who will be recruited for the proposed study (older patients with advanced cancer).  Patients were recruited to a NCI -funded study that is evaluating a coachin g intervention to improve physician 
communication behaviors.
91  Because the study utilizes a cluster randomized design, an intracluster correlation 
coefficient (ICC) was estimated from existing data to assist with sample size calculations for the current proposal.    
HCCQ has [ADDRESS_455777] utilized patient satisfaction as a key measure for reimbursement in clinical practice, with a focus on 
obtaining “perfect” scores.   
 
For example, t he Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_364873] -Based Purchasing (VBP) Program92 is a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
Services (CMS) initiative established by [CONTACT_364904] [ADDRESS_455778] acute-care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_364874].  Incentive payments are funded 
by a withhold of 1 -2% of each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s base operating DRG payments for each patient discharge over a year, 
placing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] “at risk” for this amount based upon performance on quality measures.  It is estimated that roughly half of participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_364875] a net decrease in payments, while the remainder will receive a 
net increase in payments resulting from superior performance.   The HCAHPS (Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31993]) survey, which is the first national, standardized , publicly reported survey of 
patients’ perspectives of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10422], represents the performance measurement for the VBP Patient Experience of 
URCC13070 Protocol 2017 -04-25     Page 19 of 56 Care Domain.   The HCAHPS survey is quite similar to the HCCQ in the questions that capture satisfaction with 
perceived understanding of patient’s values and goals by [CONTACT_364905].  In terms of reimbursement, CMS uses performance on nine measures from HCAHPS and each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s 
“top-box” raw score —the percentage of a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s patients who chose the most positive, or “top -box”—is 
utilized to calculate their Achievement Points and Improvement Points.   In this manner, the HCAHPS score is used 
as a binary variable, with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_364876], therefore, payment depending upon the survey respondent’s 
choice of either the highest rating or any other rating.  
As a result, an intervention that can lead to the slightest improvement in patient satisfaction scores has important 
policy implications.  This is evident by [CONTACT_364906].
87,93-[ADDRESS_455779]. Epstein’s group.  For each transcript, coding will be performed directly by 2 trained raters who 
will be blinded  to group assignment. A summary of coding procedures including assessment of inter- rater 
reliability and  resolution procedures for disagreement is included in Appendix X-8.     
 The coding schema includes definitions for each code and the specific steps the coders performed during the 
coding process. The coding procedures involve an initial reading of the transcript to identify specific geriatric 
concerns and the initiator of the concerns, followed by a second reading, in which response quality and 
interventions implemented due to concerns are identified.  
 
Five coders were involved in the coding process, with 20 percent of the transcripts coded by [CONTACT_364907] -rater reliability; the remaining transcripts were all dually coded. For each transcript, 
whether dually coded or coded by [CONTACT_364908], a consensus was agreed upon and a final coding table created for that transcript. These final consensus tables are what will be utilized in the analysis of the data.  
 
Due to the coding schema involving a conditional coding structure, inter rater reliability involved percent 
agreement in 3 coding areas: number of geriatric concerns, the category of geriatric domain discussed, and the 
physician’s response quality. A GA communication composite score will be created by [CONTACT_364909]- related 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_364877]. For number of geriatric concerns, the percent agreement was calculated 
using the difference in numbers between each coder and the consensus. An average of all coder agreement was calculated for the category of geriatric domain and physician response quality. If inter- rater agreement percentages 
fell below 70%, the coding team would meet for additional training. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_364878].  
  
URCC13070 Protocol [ADDRESS_455780]  and caregiver 
HRQoL (burden) as measured by [CONTACT_364910] (CRA) .  We hypothesize that the mean 
HRQoL for patients and caregivers at sites randomized to the intervention arm will be higher than for those in the 
usual care arm at 4 -6 weeks following the intervention and that this increase will be both statistically significant 
and clinically meaningful.99,100 We will include GA impairment (at baseline and follow up) to evaluate if these 
influence patient -reported and caregiver -reported HRQoL differently in the intervention versus the control group.  
Other secondary outcomes will include whethe r the intervention impacts how the oncology physician 
acknowledges and addresses age- related concerns, caregiver burden (as  measured by [CONTACT_364911]) and caregiver satisfaction with communication (as measured by [CONTACT_364912]) at 4 -6 weeks.  We 
will follow participants for survival for 12 months after enrollment.  We will obtain the date, location of death, and 
cause of death. If a site becomes aware that a study participant is deceased, they should complete the form which is 
available on the URCC NCORP website. Otherwise sites will be contact[CONTACT_41576] 1 year after each participant was enrolled to assess survival and asked to complete this form.  
 7.3.  Data Sources 
 
7.3.1.  Audio -recordings.   As part of baseline procedures, a clinic visit for both arms will be audio- recorded 
for the analysis of content.  For our secondary and exploratory aims, outcome measures are derived from 
audio-recordings of oncology physician- patient visits (often with a caregiver present).  All enrolled patients 
(Arm 1 and A rm 2 groups) will have one office visit with their participating oncology physician audio-
recorded (baseline visit) .  All parties present for recorded office visits, including: enrolled patients, any 
accompanying caregivers, family or friends,  the oncology physician , and any other physicians or health care 
providers not participating in the study will b e fully aware that the conversation is being audio -recorded and 
will provide verbal assent immediately before any recording begins, in addition to the prior written consent of 
enrolled subjects  (oncology physicians, patients, and caregivers).  Patients, caregivers and oncology physicians 
may receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_24189].  
 
7.3.2.  Patient Surveys.  Patients will complete surveys prior to the start of treatment at screening and 
baseline, and the Telephone Team Call within [ADDRESS_455781] been utilized in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_364879]-
related health conditions.  In a recent study, 98% of patients with non- small cell lung cancer with a median 
survival of 9 months completed a baseline battery similar in length, and 70% and 64% of those who were still 
alive were able to complete assessments at 3 and 6 months, respectively.
101,102  As is often true for patients with 
advanced disease, missing data were not random; sicker patients tended not to complete surveys.  We have 
included approaches t o missing data in the statistical section of the protocol.  
 
7.3.3.  Oncology P hysician Surveys.  Oncology p hysicians will complete a baseline survey prior to or when 
their first patient consents to the study  and a brief follow-up survey at the end of the study .  After the audio -
recorded baseline clinic visit, oncology physicians will be asked about potentially important covariates or 
moderators, including disease and treatment characteristics.    
 7.3.4.  Caregiver Surveys.  Caregivers will complete surveys at the same time points as patients.  However, 
caregivers will not receive the Telephone Team Call.  We will also ask caregivers to assess satisfaction with 
communication and care, satisfaction with decisions, and caregiver burden  (both personal and economic).
[ADDRESS_455782] information from the CRA on 
recommendations made and implemented.   In order to assess health care utilization (e.g., adverse events such 
as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]) for future work on examining cost- effectiveness of the intervention, permission to obtain 
Medicare claims in the future will be asked on the consent form.    Claims will not be obtained for any 
individual patient until the p atient has completed study procedures.  All consent and research procedures for 
URCC13070 Protocol 2017 -04-25     Page 21 of 56 obtaining Medicare claims will be followed: http://ww w.cms.gov/Research -Statistics-Data-and-
Systems/Computer -Data-and-Systems/Privacy/Researchers.html  
 
Permission to obtain claims is voluntary.  Patients will be able to decline this procedure at  the time of consent.  
Declining consent for obtaining claims from Medicare for future research to examine cost -effectiveness, 
quality of care, and health care utilization does not preclude patients from participating in this study. 
 
8.  MEASURES TO BE COLLECTED  
 
An overview of measures is provided here.  A detailed description of each measure including a summary table 
with collection time points is provided in Appendix X -1:  Measures.

We have pi[INVESTIGATOR_96537].  In total, geriatric assessment measures that are filled out by [CONTACT_364913] [ADDRESS_455783] geriatric assessment in clinic at time of consent or at in clinic before next visit with 
the oncology physician.  They may choose to complete measures at home in between visits.  The geriatric oncology clinic at the University of [COMPANY_002]ster routinely captures these measures as part of clinical care.  
 The assessments performed by [CONTACT_364914] 30 minutes of time in total (including 
physical performance and cognitive tests).  Any person at the practice site can be trained by [CONTACT_364915].  The GA does not need to be performed by [CONTACT_96568]. 
 The oncology physician assessments will be done either on paper or through REDCap, whichever the oncology 
physician prefers.  The baseline  and end of study assessments take no longer than 10 minutes and after the initial 
patient visit, the decision -making form  (to assess factors that influenced decisions) takes only a few minutes to 
complete.   
 
8.1.  Components of Geriatric Assessment  (Patient) 
Assessment tools comprising the comprehensive GA are listed in Table 2.  The various assessment tools were 
selected based upon extensive data in the geriatric literature demonstrating predictive value as well as feasibility 
data in multiple studies of elderly patients with cancer.  Other than the cognitive and physical perfor mance 
measures, the assessments are self -administered.  Patients who cannot complete the assessment on their own will 
receive assistance from study personnel  or from a caregiver.  The GA is performed  before baseline registration . 
Follow-up GA measures are collected at 4 -6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months.

URCC13070 Protocol 2017 -04-25     Page 23 of 56 study are validated tools designed to measure patients’ and caregivers’ confidence in their ability  to 
communicate their concerns, obtain and understand information, ask questions, clarify uncertainties, and make 
sure that their oncology physician  understands them.  We will measure understanding of prognosis, acceptance 
of terminal illness, and perceive d uncertainty in choosing options.  At follow up visits, patient and caregiver 
satisfaction with the decision and experience of care will be assessed with validated t ools.  
 8.3.2.  Oncology P hysician Assessments:   We will collect information on sociodemographics and decision -
making preferences.  Oncology physicians will be presented with a clinical scenario  of elderly cancer patients 
with a variety of geriatric -related impairments (i.e. , physical frailty, cognitive impairment).  A series of 
questions will follow each vignette inquiring about the likelihood of the oncology physician to offer 
chemotherapy and cancer treatments in the scenario .  After the study is over, physicians will be asked to 
complete a brief follow -up survey. After the audio-recorded clinical encounter, oncology physicians will 
complete a short  follow-up survey (<10 questions) requesting information on the plan for the patient and 
factors that influenced how the decision was made.    
 
8.3.3.  Audio -recordings of oncolog y physician- patient visit :  A CRA will audio -record the patient-oncolog y 
physician consultation  (baseline study visit) .  For our Secondary and Exploratory aims, we will assess the 
number of age-related concerns brought up by [CONTACT_88122].  Coders will undergo extensive training 
and supervision by [CONTACT_339474], will not be involved in any other aspects of the study, and will be 
blind to study hypotheses and assignments for intervention vs. control.  Please refer to Appendix X -8 for full 
coding procedures.  
  
9.  NCORP  PRACTICE SITE RANDOMIZATION  
 
A practice site is defined as any practice location within an overarching NCORP designation where oncology 
physicians and study staff work independently, i.e., do not cross over into another site.  Practice sites will be 
randomized to one of the two study arms by [CONTACT_3553] a computer–generated randomization table.  The randomization process will be determined using R software provided by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Charles Heckler, the lead biostatistician of the URCC NCOR P Research Base.  
 Sites are randomized on a continual basis due to a variety of factors (i.e., a new NCORP Community Affiliate has 
been added to the URCC NCORP Research Base network, a new oncology practice site has been added to an 
existing NCORP Communit y Affiliate, or an oncology practice site that is currently affiliated with an NCORP 
Community Affiliate has expressed interest in participating in the COACH study). Past accrual to URCC studies (or NCORP Cancer Control studies if URCC accrual information is not available for new Affiliates and sites) is used to stratify each practice site as a large accruing (20 or more accruals/year) site or a small accruing (less than 
20 accruals/year) practice site in order to assure balance in the randomization.  The g eneral assumption will be that 
any new site will be considered “small”, unless it is determined based on past accruals that they are large. For new 
oncology practice sites that meet the definition for being independent (i.e., physicians and staff that do not cross 
over into another site), the next unassigned randomization allocation, from the randomization table will be used to assign their study arm. The randomization table takes into account size of the practice site.   If a new oncology 
practice site is added at a later time during the study with physicians/staff that also see patients (cross over) at both 
or multiple practice sites, the new practice site will be assigned to the same study arm as the already randomized 
practice site where the physician/staff also sees patients.  
 
Once sites have IRB approval on file with the Research Base and at least one member of research staff is trained 
on all study procedures, they are notified of their randomization allocation by [CONTACT_364916], [CONTACT_96599]. Practice sites names and randomization assignments are saved in the database, this is used to link to which 
arm each study patient belongs to during patient registration.   The original sample size calculation (Section 15) was based on the randomization of the [ADDRESS_455784] utilize GA information in clinical practice 
for older adults with cancer.   The training session provides a brief overview of the intervention information and 
can be comple ted through a web conference, telephone call, or as a paper “sign -off” documenting review of the 
materials.  The training materials were  developed with resources from Drs. Mohile ’s and Hurria’s geriatric 
oncology lectures.   
 
The CRAs and/or r esearch nurses at sites randomized to the intervention arm  will be trained to utilize the 
mycarg.org website to derive a summary of GA scores and a list of targeted GA -driven recommendations.   
 This information will be printed by [CONTACT_364917] “sign off” that he/she has 
received and reviewed the information.   Study or clinical staff can assist the physician in  checking which 
recommendations were considered and  facilitating  implementation of GA-driven recommendations.  Two copi[INVESTIGATOR_364880]: one should be provided to the patient/caregiver and one should be retained in the study chart.  Patients and caregivers should be provided with a copy of the GA summary and GA-
driven recommendation forms prior to the audio -recorded visit.  The original forms should be submitted to  the 
URCC Research Base.

URCC13070 Protocol 2017 -04-25     Page 26 of 56 11.1.  Procedures Prior to Screening  Visit  
 
11.1.1.  Oncology Physician Enrollment  and Participation  
 
11.1.1a.  If a n oncology physician is interested in the study and meets the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 
he/she will  agree to participate on paper or through  REDCap (sent by [CONTACT_96561]). 
 
11.1.1b.  The oncology physician will complete a baseline survey on demographics and treatment 
preferences either on paper or through REDCap.  
 
11.1.1c  Ideally oncology physicians are enrolled as soon as possible.  However, an oncology physician 
can be enrolled after his/her patient is identified for the study or prior to screening registration for the first 
identified patient.  
 
11.1.2.  Subject Identification Process  
 
11.1.2a.  Patients:   Once a site is IRB approved, the site study staff can start screening for patients  
according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria for patients (Section 4.2).  Only patients from enrolled 
physicians can be registered.  
 
11.1.2b.  Screening Log :  A screeni ng log will be kept at each participating  site, where both patients and 
caregivers approached for the study  will be entered by [CONTACT_96577].  
 
11.2.  Screening:  VISIT  0  
 
11.2.1.  Patient & Caregiver Recruitment & Consent Process  
 
11.2.1a.  Patients 
• The site study staff will notify the patient’s  oncology physician when a patient is identified as a 
possible cand idate for the study.  Site study staff should screen for patients who may fit eligibility 
criteria for all requirements other than GA impairment. It is anticipated that  some of the patients who 
are eligible  will be new patients for the oncology physician. 
• The oncology physician and/or CRA should mention the study to the patient and give out recruitment 
materials.  
• If the patient is interested, the oncology physician and/or site study staff will explain the study and 
once all aspects of the study have been discussed to the patient’s satisfaction, t he voluntary written 
informed consent procedures will be completed with the patient if they choose to enroll in the study.  
• Patients should choose a caregiver to participate.  As much as possible, caregivers should be recruited 
to be part of the study when the patient is recruited.  In the rare circumstance that there is no willing 
caregiver to participate, the patient will be allowed to participate without a caregiver.   URCC 
Research Base staff should be notified prior to patient registration if there is n o designated caregiver.   
• The site study staff can schedule a separate visit with the patient and /or caregiver to go over the 
consent and initi ate study procedures if more time is needed.   
 
11.2.1b.  Caregivers 
• If a caregiver, chosen by [CONTACT_102] , is interested in the study and meets the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, the site study staff will confirm eligibility  (as per section 4.3) and complete the informed 
consent procedures with the caregiver . Caregivers must enroll in the study before or on the baseline 
visit. 
 
11.2.2.  Patient & Caregiver Assessment Process  
 
11.2.2a.  Once a patient has consented, screening and baseline assessments/procedures can occur.  Site 
URCC13070 Protocol [ADDRESS_455785] of the steps below:  
• Confirm that the patient’s  oncology physician has been enrolled onto the study and if not, follow 
procedures for enrolling oncology physicians.   
• Patients meeting eligibility criteria are initially registered with a screening registration after signing 
consent. 
• Administer Cognitive , Physical , and Nutritional Assessments to the patient .  
 These assessments can be administered right after consent, at a separate visit scheduled by [CONTACT_96577], or just prior to the next oncology physician visit.  Allow [ADDRESS_455786] prior to an oncology physician  visit.   
 Anyone at the practice site can administer cognitive and physical assessments to the patient as 
long as they have participated in the required GA training administered by [CONTACT_96560].  CRAs, clinical nurses, and technicians are all eligible to p articipate in training 
and can complete GA study procedures.   
• Patient will complete all screening surveys. 
 Ideally the patient will complete either at the time of consent or the screening and baseline 
packets can be taken home and completed  before the next visit with  the oncology physician.  If 
the patient needs assistance from site study staff to complete surveys, allow adequate time.  Approximately 60 minutes is recommended.   
• Abstract required medical information from chart. 
 
11.2.2c. The GA must  be completed prior to the study visit with the oncology physician.  Th e study 
visit with the oncology physician will be audio-recorded with the oncology physician and patient.  
The caregiver should be encouraged to attend this study visit, but the study visit can occur without 
the caregiver present if the caregiver is not available.  
 
11.2.2d.  The procedures for the caregiver assessments will consist of the steps below:  
Caregiver s will complete all baseline surveys. Caregiver s will complete either at the time of consent or the 
packet can be taken home and should be completed before the next visit with the oncology physician.  
 
11.3.  Baseline:  VISIT 1 
 
11.3.1.  Patient & Caregiver Assessment Process  
 
11.3.1a.  BEFORE BASELINE VISIT: 
 Site study staff will telephone the participant to:  
• Confirm scheduled visit with the oncology physician . 
• Confirm that the patient and caregiver completed the screening surveys before the oncology 
physician visit and remind them to bring the surveys in with them . 
 Schedule the  patient to come in  to meet with site study staff at least 45 minutes prior to the 
oncology physician visit in order to complete  study procedures.  A llow for more time if patient 
and caregiver communicate (s) that surveys h ave not been completed. Only patients who 
complete GA procedures can be registered for the study.   
 
11.3.1b.  AT THE BASELINE VISIT:  
• If the patient’s screening surveys have not been completed prior to the patient coming in, complete 
them now. 
• If the caregiver’s surveys have not been completed prior to the caregiver coming in, complete them 
now. 
• If not complete staff should administer cognitive, physical performance, and nutrition assessment . 
• If not complete, staff should complete CRA study forms. 
URCC13070 Protocol 2017 -04-25     Page 28 of 56 • If not complete, complete baseline surveys. The baseline surveys do not need to be completed prior 
to registration, but should be completed on the day of the baseline visit. For example, patients can 
complete baseline surveys while receiving cancer treatment t hat same day.  
• Score each GA measure as taught in the training procedures.  If assistance is needed for scoring, 
contact [CONTACT_96578].  
• Patients who have at least one abnormal GA score other than polypharmacy can move forward with 
the study. 
• After the GA and the  above steps are complete, the baseline registration procedures can be 
completed for the patient and caregiver (refer to section 6, Registration).  
 Registration must occur prior to baseline study visit with the oncology physician. 
• Prior to the study visit with the oncology physician, i f depression (GDS) or cognition (BOMC) 
assessments score ≥ 11, inform patient’s oncology physician as follows: 
 Usual Care arm -- inform oncology physician with template as per training.  
 Intervention arm -- information on cognitive impairment or depression is included in summary 
(see section 1 1.3, Intervention Procedures).  
 
11.3.2.  Intervention Procedures (Only for sites randomized to the intervention arm ) 
 
11.3.2. a. AT THE BASELINE VISIT:  
• After the patients have been registered for the study, enter the GA scores into the mycarg.org 
website or if no internet is available, contact [CONTACT_364919].  
• After entering the GA scores, p rint the built pdf packet specific to that patient.  
• Present GA summary form and recommendation forms to oncology physician to review just prior to 
baseline patient -oncology physician visit .  Study staff can assist the oncology physician in the 
completion of the forms.  Study and clinical staff can assist in implementing GA- driven 
recommendations after physician approves them.  
 Information on cognitive impairment or depression is included in the summary. 
 The oncology physician MUST  review and sign the  summary form and recommendations 
forms. 
 GA recommendations that are planned by [CONTACT_364920]-marked by [CONTACT_96583]. 
• Three copi[INVESTIGATOR_96539]: one should be 
provided to the patient , one should be provided to the caregiver (if requested) , and one should be 
retained in the study chart.   
• The original forms should be sent into the URCC Research Ba se.   
 
11.3.3.  Oncology P hysician Assessment for Patient s:  After the audio-recorded baseline visit, oncology 
physicians will complete a brief survey (on paper) to capture factors that influenced the decision -making 
process for the patient’s plan .   
 
11.3.4.  Submitting Materials to the URCC Research Base:  
 
11.3.4a.  After the audio-recorded baseline visit, site study staff should  ensure the forms below are 
completed and submit them to the URCC Research Base:  
• All oncology physician, patient and caregiver assessments from above 
• All CRA Study Forms 
• Audio-recording s  (submitted and stored as per training)  with Audio-recording Data Form  
• Intervention summary and recommendation forms (if applicable). 
 
11.3.5.  Audio -recordings (for both intervention and usual care)   
 11.3.5a.  The first visit with the oncology physician following the completion of GA measures will be 
audio-recorded for analysis of content and process of communication.  
URCC13070 Protocol 2017 -04-25     Page 29 of 56 11.3.5b.  Site study staff need to ensure that two audio-recorders are on and working during the visit, but 
do not need to be present in the room during the visit.  11.3.5c.  Site study staff will submit audio -recordings as per training and complete the audio- recording 
data form.  
 
11.4.  Follow-up Visits 
 
11.4.1.  Visits will occur 4-6 weeks after the baseline audio-recorded visit,  3 months after the baseline 
audio-recorded visit (10-14 weeks ), and 6 months after the baseline audio-recorded visit (20-24 weeks ). 
 
11.4.1a.  BEFORE EACH FOLLOW -UP VISIT:  
Study staff will telephone the participant to:  
• Confirm scheduled visit with the oncology team .  The visit does not need to be scheduled with the 
oncology physician. 
• Confirm that the patient and caregiver completed the surveys. 
 Surveys must be completed during the appropriate window for each time point.  Site study 
staff can either mail the follow -up surveys to the subjects OR at the end of one visit, they can 
provide the next round of surveys to the subjects to take home with them for the next follow-up visit. 
 Ideally subjects will complete the survey packet at home and bring to site study staff on the 
day of a routinely scheduled visit for the oncology physician visit or designee (e.g., nurse 
practitioner) or cancer treatment.   
 If the patient needs assistance from site study staff to complete surveys on -site, allow adequate 
time (45-60 minutes).  
 If patients and   caregivers cannot complete packet at home:  
 Patient and caregiver can come in prior to office visit to co mplete surveys. 
 Patient and caregiver can complete surveys during cancer treatment visits (e.g., 
chemotherapy infusion). 
 If needed, the patient and caregiver can meet with the site study staff at an additional time 
to complete the follow-up surveys. The subjects do not need to meet with the oncology physician to complete the surveys.  
 
11.4.1b.  AT EACH SCHEDULED FOLLOW -UP VISIT:   
• Staff will administer the following assessments to the patient:  
 Cognitive and Physical Performance. 
 If depression (GDS) assessment score ≥ 11, both usual care arm and intervention arm 
inform patient’s oncology physician with template as per training.  
• CRA:  Complete all CRA follow -up study forms.  CRAs at practice sites randomized to the 
intervention arm  will complete the GA-Recommendation Follow-up forms by [CONTACT_364921]-Recommendation Baseline forms, clinic note, and  referring to the oncology physician (if 
needed). 
• Patient:  Complete all surveys in the follow -up packet. 
• Caregiver :  Complete all surveys in the follow -up packet.   
• Site study staff will submit the following to the URCC Research Base:  
 All oncology physician, patient and caregiver surveys from above. 
 All CRA study forms. 
 
11.4.1c. A subset of the chart notes will be requested if there are discrepanc ies or missing information in 
key data. 
 
11.5.  Te
lephone Team Call (1 to 7 days from Baseline) 
The Telephone Team will consist of University of Chicago and University of [COMPANY_002]ster research staff and will be blinded to group assignment. The Telephone Team will make a phone call to the patient subject within 1 to 
URCC13070 Protocol 2017 -04-25     Page 30 of 56 7 days, or up to 2 weeks, of the baseline clinic consultation to assess patient satisfaction with communication 
about age -related issues and concerns. The phone call will be recorded.  
 
11.5.1.  BEFORE THE PHONE CALL:  
 
11.5.1a.  Site Study staff will provide the patient subject’s preferred and alternate phone numbers, best 
time to call, and mailing address as part of the registration process for the patient.  Caregiver phone number 
will be obtained as a back -up.    
 
11.5.1b.  To ensure that the Telephone Team remains blinded to the patient’s group assignment, the 
Telephone Team will obtain the contact [CONTACT_3031] (phone number and mailing address) from the URCC Research Base.  
11.5.1c.  The study materials will be mailed (with a return envelope provided) to the patient by [CONTACT_364922] a telephone call is not feasible  (e.g., due to sensory or disability impairments).  
 
11.5.2.  DURING THE PHONE CALL :  
 
11.5.2a. The Telephone Team will administer the Health Care Climate Questionnaires to the patient. 
Telephone Team will submit the Health Care Climate Questionnaires to the URCC Research Base and 
keep a copy labeled with patient identification number on site. 
 
12.  REIMBURSEMENT  
 
In order to improve study retention and compliance, we will compensate patients and caregivers for their 
participation (i.e., time and travel). Patient and caregiver subjects will each receive $15.00 for every time point 
assessment completed . Both patients and caregivers can receive up to $60 .00 each if all four time point 
assessments are completed.  
 
13. ADVERSE EVENT RE PORTING  
 
13.1.  Risks from participating in this research are psychological distress from completing the questionnaires and 
the cognitive testing.   
 
13.2.  ADVERSE EVENTS RELATED TO STUDY PROCEDURES AND NOT TO ROUTINE ONCOLOGY 
TREATMENT AND CARE will be reported using the URCC Adverse Event form. This form can be found on the

 13.5.  An unexpected  adverse event is defined as any adverse experience, the specificity or severity of which is not 
consistent with the risk information described in section 13.1.   
 13.6.  A serious event refers to any event in which the outcome results in any of the following:  death, a life -
threatening adverse experience, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant disability, incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  Important medical events that may no t 
result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience 
when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
 
13.7. ONLY serious adverse events related to the study procedures need to be reported  for data and safety 
monitoring purposes .  AEs and SAEs related to routin e oncology treatment and care DO NOT need to be 
reported.   
 
13.8.  Adverse events should be reported to the local IRB as per their requirements.  
 13.9.  Data Safety and Monitoring  
 
13.9.1.  All adverse events requiring reporting will be submitted to the Research Base as described in section 
13.4.  Adverse events that are serious AND unexpected  AND related will be forwarded to the study chair and 
the URCC Data Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMC) chair immediately upon receipt at URCC.  Additional information may be requested upon their review. 
 13.9.2.  All adverse events reported to URCC are entered int o a protocol -specific spreadsheet.  Adverse event 
rates are monitored utilizing the spreadsheet.  If a serious adverse event is being reported frequently, the study chair will conduct a detailed review.  The DSMC Committee Chair will be notified and will d etermine if 
further action is required.  13.9.3.  The URCC Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will review study progress and cumulative 
reports of adverse events at annual meetings.  An overall assessment of accrual and adverse events will enable the committee members to assess whether significant benefits or risks are occurring that would warrant study 
closure.   
 
13.9.4.  The URCC will notify the NCORPs immediately of any serious safety concerns identified by [CONTACT_90398].  DSMC reports will be available for download on the research base website. 
 
14.  CRITERIA FOR WITHDRAWAL  
 Subjects who discontinue or are withdrawn from study will be asked to complete all assessment forms up until  the 
time of withdrawal.   
 
URCC13070 Protocol [ADDRESS_455788] Linear Unbiased Predictors (BLUP) of the mean response for each NCORP. 
 
All regression analyses will include terms to control for study site and oncologist type. In addition, clinically 
important socioeconomic variables such as pati ent gender, age, race/ ethnicity, and cancer variables such as cancer 
type and treatment status will be used to control for patient- level covariates. In case a key covariate is found to be 
unbalanced between study arms, it will be included in the model as a potential confounder.  
  
URCC13070 Protocol [ADDRESS_455789] deviation estimate of HCCQ was 
2.1. The Intracluster Correlation 
(ICC) was 0.14 with a 95% 
confidence interval from 0.01 to 
0.51.  Because of the large amount of uncertainty in the ICC, 
we calculated power curves for 
ICC={0.01, 0.14, 0.51}, with 
ICC=0.[ADDRESS_455790] 
conservative.  This design (8 sites per arm and 31 subjects per site) 
has 80% power at the 0.[ADDRESS_455791] a 
change in HCCQ of 0.6, 1.3 and 
2.3 for ICC={0.01, 0.14, 0.51}, respectively.  Since the best 
estimate of the ICC is 0.14, the expected detectable difference is 
1.3.  This corresponds to an effect 
size of 0.62.  The range of the 
HCCQ scores (modified HCCQ 
for satisfaction with age- related 
discussions) is 7 (worst possible) 
to 35 (best possible). The figure 
to the right shows the power for a 
range of detectable differences (D) for ICC= 0.01, 0.14 and 0.51 (Figure 3). As mentioned in Section 7.1, small 
changes in satisfaction scores have been interpreted in other studies to be meaningful given a focus on achievement 
of high satisfaction scores and the link with reimbursement.  In addition to using the total score as a continuous 
variable, we will compare the results for each question as a dichotomous variable (5 vs <5).  If the distribution is 
skewed, we will consider treating the scores as an ordinal variable in analyses.  
 
 
Accounting for a small dropout rate of 5% (based on our observational cohort data1), the targeted accrual will be 
528 patient subjects total.   The dropout rate reflects patients who sign consent but withdraw prior to the audio-
recorded baseline visit and capture of the modified HCCQ  (which will occur within 7 days of baseline visit).    
 
During NCORP site recruitment, if more than [ADDRESS_455792] 68 practice sites participating in the COACH study; the 
increased practice site clusters provide improved statistical power.  The total patient sample size will stay the 
same, and accrual will cease when that target is met.  
 
Analysis for Primary Aim 1. This is a cluster  randomized trial with NCORP  practice sites being the clusters.  
Because of the cluster randomized study design, we will apply linear mixed model methodology.104  The total 
modified HCCQ scores (HCCQ-age) will be the response, and the arm will be the fixed effect.  NCORP  practice 
sites will be entered as a random effect independent of residual error.  Estimation will be performed using 
Restricted Maximum Likelihood, and the null hypothesis of zero mean difference between arms will be tested 
using the F test .[ADDRESS_455793] Linear Unbiased

15.3.  Secondary Aim 1  (PCORI -specified Primary Aim)  
 
An important secondary aim and the 
primary aim for PCORI is the 
number of discussions related to geriatric domains, as measured by [CONTACT_364923], brought up during the 
audio-recorded baseline visit.  In our 
preliminar y data from a multicenter 
study, the median number of 
discussions was 1 in 32 audio-
recorded conversations between 
older patients, their caregivers, and  
oncology physicians.  This 
preliminary work has allowed us to 
calculate the intracluster correlation 
(ICC) amongst 8 different sites for 
the assessment of the secondary 
outcome, number of discussions 
related to geriatric domains.  The 
ICC was 0.122 with a 95% confidence interval from 0.008 to 
0.659.  Because of the large amount 
of uncertainty in the ICC, we 
calculated power curves for 
ICC={0.008, 0.122, 0.659}, with 
ICC=0.[ADDRESS_455795] 
conservative.  This design (with 8 
NCORP sites per arm and 31 
evaluable subjects per  NCORP) has 
80% power at the 0.[ADDRESS_455796] a change of 0.235, 0.456 and 0.962 in the mean number of 
discussions for ICC={0.008, 0.122, 0.659 } respectively, assu ming a standard deviation of 0.78 (Figure 4). Since 
the best estimate of the ICC is 0.122, the expected detectable difference is 0.122.  This corresponds to an effect size of 0.59.   
 
The analysis for Secondary Aim 1 will be the same as for Primary Aim 1, but will use the number of discussions of 
age-related concerns as the response.  
  
15.4. Other Secondary Analyses  
 
15.4.1.  Secondary Aim 2:  HRQoL will be assessed with the FACT and Caregiver HRQoL will be assessed 
with the Caregiver Reactions Assessment (CRA).  The analysis will be the same as that used for Primary Aim 1. We will include geriatric assessment impairment (at baseline and follow up) to evaluate if these influence 
patient-reported HRQoL differently in the intervention versus the control group.  We will also compare 
whether the uptake of geriatric assessment recommendations influences patient reported HRQoL and caregiver 
burden.  Da ta from the intervention arm will be fit to a linear mixed model with FACT  or CRA as the outcome,  
number and percent of  implemented  interventions (number implemented/number recommended) as the fixed 
effect, and NCORP site as a random effect independent of residual error.  Analyses will be adjusted for 
treatment status.  
 15.4.2.  Secondary Aim 3:  We will compare the effect of the intervention on caregiver satisfaction (the 
modified health care climate questionnaire for the caregiver) using the same linear mixed model methodology. 
Figure 4:  Sample Size for Secondary Aim 1  
(PCORI-specified Primary Aim)  

URCC13070 Protocol 2017 -04-25     Page 35 of 56  
15.4.3.  Exploratory Aims:  Exploratory aims will evaluate (1) whether the number of discussions about age-
related issues during the clinic visit correlates with patient satisfaction, (2) whether the intervention increases 
the proportion of age-related concerns that are acknowledged and addressed, and  (3)  if communication about 
age-related issues influences how patients, caregivers, and oncology physicians make decisions for cancer 
treatment.    An additional exploratory aim will examine the impact of the intervention on survival.   
 
In order to examine the relationship between observed communication from audio-recording s and patient 
satisfaction, we will evaluate the correlation between the numbers of discussions regardin g age-related 
concerns from audio- recorded visits with patient satisfaction on HCCQ -age (modified to evaluate for 
satisfaction for communication about age- related issues) .  We will determine the association of baseline 
oncology phy sician and patient decisi on-making preferences  on the likelihood of having a discussion 
related to geriatric domains . The analysis for PCORI Primary Aim  (secondary aim 1) will be used with the 
above characteristics added as independent variables. The statistical significance and estimated coefficients 
will be used to identify and interpret potentially important baseline features. Any conclusions will be 
considered to be hy pothesis generating for further research.  
 We will also measure the intervention increases the proportion of age- related issues that are acknowledged and 
addressed  (e.g., oncology physician response/(number of patient and caregiver concerns).  We will examine if 
the intervention improves physician confidence with managing age- related conditions as well as physician 
comfort with communication about age-related issues (using data from physician baseline and follow up 
forms)  
 
We will capture survival through the participant’s medical record and verification with the primary team.  We will follow participants for survival for [ADDRESS_455797] of the intervention on 12-month survival using log rank tests and survival plots. 
 
 
15.5.  Missing Data  
Every effort will be made to encourage and facilitate participants' completion of questionnaires, but because of 
dropout, missing data will occur.  We will evaluate the patterns of missing data and associations of missingness 
with other available variables. Under the missing at random (MAR) assumption, the parameter estimates from the mixed model analyses will be unbiased.
 If the data are suspected to  be missing not at random (MNAR), a 
sensitivity analysis using selection and/or pattern -mixture models will be run to determine the impact on the 
results.106  If the estimates are similar to the ones obtained from the simpler analysis of only complete cases, we 
will report the complete -case analysis results.  
 
16.  DATA MANAGEMENT AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
 
16.1. Training Procedures  
A special training session was held at the 2013 annual URCC NCORP  Research Base meeting.   This training 
included a detailed review of the study rationale, design, and research administration procedures. Training session s 
will be held with the staff from each site via teleconference and at the annual meetings.  These sessions and the 
correspondi ng procedures  manuals review the following:  1) informed consent; 2) completing the assessments 
using Teleforms; 3) completing the functional and objective measures; 4) data collection via chart extraction; 5) 
completing the web -based intervention using my carg.org (for intervention arm); 6) transfer of the data to the 
URCC NCORP Research Base; 7) formulating the research chart; and 8) a discussion of interviewing techniques 
so that the research team will standardize their approaches in order to elicit consi stent data from subjects. There 
will be a protocol update every year at the annual Research Base meeting.  All assessments, data collection forms, 
and manuals will be readily available on the NCORP Research Base website.   
URCC13070 Protocol 2017 -04-25     Page 36 of 56   
16.2.  Data Management  
The same protocols and procedures for data quality and control that we use for all URCC NCORP  Research Base 
protocols (which accrued over 1,000 patients in the previous year) will be used for this study. Once the patient 
consents to the protocol, he/she will be assigned a unique identifier by [CONTACT_364924], which will be used to 
link all patient data.  Oncology physician and patient assessments will be captured using scannable Teleforms. The 
CRA and/or Research Nurse at each site will ensure that data are complete prior to submission.  At the Research Base, data are scanned  into an electronic password -secured Access database which is backed up every [ADDRESS_455798] members of the study staff.   
 
16.3.  REDCap  
Data are also collected and managed by [CONTACT_364925] (URMC). We will evaluate records, clinical characteristics, 
and outcomes and we will utilize REDCap to collect and manage this information. Further, we will link this 
information to the encrypted ACCESS database (which contains the s urvey information) with a unique identifier.   
 
16.3.1. The University of [COMPANY_002]ster Medical Center provides the following information on the REDCap 
program:  “ Vanderbilt University, in collaboration with a consortium of institutional partners, has developed 
a software toolset and workflow methodology for electronic collection and management of research and clinical trial data, called REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). The REDCap system is a secure, web -
based application that is flexible enough to be used for a variety of types of research.  It provides an intuitive interface for users to enter data and real time validation rules (with automated data type and range checks) at 
the time of data entry. REDCap offers easy data manipulation with audit trails and functionality for reporting, 
monitoring and querying patient records, as well as an automated export mechanism to common statistical 
packages (SPSS, SAS, Stata, R/S -Plus). Through the REDCap Consortium, Vanderbilt has disseminated 
REDCap for use around the world. Currently, over 240 academic and non-profit consortium partners on six 
continents with over 26,000 research end- users use REDCap”  
 
16.3.2. According to the University of [COMPANY_002]ster Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI), 
REDCap is supported with the following means . “The CTSI Informatics Core , a unit of the SMD Academic 
Information Technology (AIT) Group, will serve as a central facil itator for data processing and 
management.   REDCap data collection projects rely on a thorough study- specific data dictionary defined in an 
iterative self -documenting process by [CONTACT_59881], with planning assistance from the AIT-
CTSI Informatics Core.  The iterative development and testing process results in a well -planned data collection 
strategy for individual studies .”
  
 
16.3.3. The CTSI states that regarding security, “ REDCap servers are housed in a local data center at the 
University of [COMPANY_002]ster and all web -based information transmission is encrypted. REDCap was developed in a 
manner consistent with HIPAA security requirements and is recommended to University of [COMPANY_002]ster 
researchers by [CONTACT_364926].  
 
16.4.  Data Storage:  
All written materials will be kept confidential, locked in the private offices and limited -access file room of the 
URCC NCORP Research Base and identified by [CONTACT_96593].  All electronic information will be kept confidential 
with password -protected, limited access.  
 
The Case Summary should accompany ALL  data submissions.  All completed forms and audio-recording s must be 
submitted within 7 days of the study visit and should be sent to:

17. DATA COLLECTION AND MEASURES  
 
For a detailed description of the measures that will be collected, refer to Appendix X -1:  Measures. 
 
18.  SUBJECT CONSENT AND PEER JUDGMENT  
 
All investigational, FDA, state, federal and institutional regulations concerning informed consent and peer 
judgment will be fulfilled.  
 
19.  RECORD AND DATA RETENTION  
 
Clinical research records are source documents and records, in any form (including, but not limited to, written, 
electronic, magnetic, and optical records, in addition, scans (x- rays and electrocardiograms) that describe or record 
the methods, conduct, and/or results of a trial, and the actions taken. Unlike pharmaceutical -sponsored research, 
under the Terms of the NIH Award, the awardee institution retains ownership of the clinical research records that were conducted with NIH support. Records may be preserved in hardcopy, electronic or other media form since 
there is no regulatory requirement that clinical research records be retained in a certain type of format. However, 
investigators should check with their institution for institutional policies and procedures pertaining to record 
retention. All records rela ting to research that is conducted must be retained for at least five years after completion 
of the research. The three-year time period begins when the individual institution’s engagement in the human 
subjects research activity ends. Human subject research activities are considered completed once all research -
related interventions and interactions with human subjects have been completed, all data collection and analysis of identifiable private information described in the IRB -approved research plan have be en finished and primary 
analysis of either identifiable private or de-identified information is completed.

MEASURES 
 
  
URCC13070 Protocol 2017 -04-25     Page 45 of 56 MEASURES TO BE COLLECTED 
Collection Time -points are Screening/Baseline, Telephone Team Call to patient within 1 to 7 days 
from baseline to assess patient satisfaction, 4-6 weeks, 10-14 weeks (3 months) and 20-24 weeks (6 
months).   Measures signified by *** are only collected at screening /baseline and not a t follow-up 
visits.  Measures signified by (Follow-up)  are collected only at follow -up visits.  
We have pi[INVESTIGATOR_96537].  In total, geriatric assessment measures that are filled out by [CONTACT_364928] 20 minutes of time.  The additional measures (quality of life, symptoms, communication, decision-making) captured at baseline require an additional [ADDRESS_455805] found that 90% of patients complete measures at 
home if allowed to do so.  The geriatric oncology clinic at the University of [COMPANY_002]ster routinely captures these measures as part of clinical care.  
The telephone call that will capture the patient satisfaction measures (based on the Health Care Climate Questionnaire, HCCQ) will take <10 minutes and will occur within 1 to 7 days of the baseline audiotaped visit.  The assessments performed by [CONTACT_364929] 30 to 45 m inutes of time 
in total (including physical performance and cognitive tests).  Any person at the practice site can be trained by [CONTACT_364930].  The assessments do not need to be performed by [CONTACT_099].  
The physician assessm ents will be done either on paper or through REDCap, whichever the physician 
prefers.  The baseline assessments take no longer than 10 minutes and after each patient visit, the decision-making form (to assess  factors that influenced decisions) is less than one-page long (2 minutes 
to complete).  
 
1. Patient Surveys 
1.1. Demographics***:  Age, race and ethnicity, gender, highest level of education achieved, 
employment status, marital status, living situation, and presence of a living companion will be 
captured.  We will also assess financial concerns, understanding of disease, self-rated health, and 
subjective age.  
1.2. Geriatric assessment :  Assessment tools comprising the comprehensive geriatric assessment are 
discussed below.  The various assessment tools were selected based upon extensive data in the geriatric literature demonstrating predictive value as well as feasibility data in multiple studies of elderly patients with cancer.  Other than the cognitive and physical performa nce measures, the 
assessments are self -administered.   Patients who cannot complete the assessment on their own can 
receive assistance from the study personnel  or caregiver . The comprehensive assessment is 
performed first prior to treatment and  brief follo w-up GA measures are collected at 4 -6 weeks, 3 
months, and 6 months.  Measures collected only at baseline are noted with ***.   
1.2.1.   Activities of daily living (ADL):
[ADDRESS_455806] appropriate instrument to assess            
functional status as a measurement of the patient ’s ability to perform activities of daily living 
independently. Clinicians typi[INVESTIGATOR_364881] t problems in performing activities of daily 
living and to plan care accordingly. The Index ranks adequacy of performance in the six functions 
URCC13070 Protocol 2017 -04-25     Page 46 of 56 of bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, continence, and feeding.   Patients are scored yes/no 
for independence in each of the six functions. A score of 6 indicates full function, 4 indicates 
moderate impairment, and 2  or less indicates severe functional impairment.   
1.2.2. Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL):2  Self-reported functional status will be 
assessed using the IADL subscale of the Multidimensional Functional Assessment Questionnaire:  Older American Resources and Services (OARS).  The IADL subscale consists of seven questions rated on a three- point Likert scale.  It measures the degree to which an activity can be performed 
independently.  
1.2.3. Fall History:  A self-reported history of falls in the past six months will be recorded.  A 
history of a recent fall has been demonstrated to be independently predictive of increased risk for chemotherapy toxicity in older cancer patients.
3 
1.2.4. OARS Physical Health:2  Self-reported questions that assess the degree of difficulty with 
physical tasks such as walking, climbing stairs, stoopi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and reaching.  This measure correlates with disability and comorbidity.  
1.2.5. OARS Comorbidity***:
2  Patients self -report their coexisting medical conditions and also 
rate the degree to which their illness causes impairment in daily activities.  The OARS Physical Health Section has been shown to correlate significantly with health professional ratings of comorbidity as w ell.  
1.2.6.  OA RS Medical Social Support and Social Activities:***
2  A 13-question survey asking 
patients to identify the number of support persons involved in their medical care as well as the degree to which they felt supported in a variety of situations.  A follow-up question will be used to assess how much a patient’s physical or emotional hea lth interfered with social activities . 
1.2.7.  Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD- 7):***
4  The GAD- 7 is a self -administered patient 
questionnaire used as a screening tool and severity measure for generalized anxiety disorder. The GAD-7 score is calculated by [CONTACT_135480] 0, 1, 2, and 3, to the response categories of “hardly ever,” “several days,” “more than half the days,” and “nearly every day,” respectively, and 
adding together the scores for the seven questions.  Scores of 5, 10, and 15 are taken as the cut off points for mild, moderate, and severe anxiety, respectively. When used as a screening tool, further evaluation is recommended when the score is 10 or greater.  Using the threshold score of 10, the GAD-7 has a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 82% for generalized anxiety disorder.  It is moderately good at screening three other common anxiety disorders – panic disorder (sensitivity 74%, specificity 81%), social anxiety disorder (sensitivity 72%, specificity 80%), and post-traumatic stress disorder (sensitivity 66%, specificity 81%).   
1.2.8.  Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS):
5   Patients will be screened with the Geriatric 
Depression Scale (GDS). The GDS contains questions that are intended to screen elderly patients 
for depression, while parsing out complaints related to advanced age.6  
1.3. Satisfaction, Quality of Life, and Symptoms: 
1.3.1.  Health Care Climate Questionnaire (HCCQ) (Follow-up)7-9 measures patient - centered 
autonomy- supportive physician behaviors such as whether the patient and caregiver feels that the 
physician understands his/her perspective, provides choices and options, and encourages participation in decisions.  The measure has been studied and validated in older patients. Similar to 
other studies which adapt satisfaction scales to capture specific clinical criteria (e.g., satisfaction with physician regarding communication about chemotherapy),
10 the HCCQ has been modified for 
this study to specifically address patient satisfaction with physician behavior s and communication 
regarding age -related issues and concerns in order to specifically address satisfaction with the 
URCC13070 Protocol 2017 -04-25     Page 47 of 56 intervention (geriatric assessment summary) rather than satisfaction with other aspects of cancer 
care (e.g., communication about cancer treatment) (HCCQ-age).   As is done with satisfaction with 
care surveys in other research and in clinical settings, the HCCQ (both modified and original) will be administered within 1 week after the audio- taped clinic visit.
11-14   Our University of Chicago 
collaborators (Dale and Gorawar a-Bhatt) have experience with the conduct of such assessments 
over the phone and this minimizes perceived or real influence from the physician or team.  The University of Chicago collaborators and research staff, who are subcontracted through a PCORI contract with the University of Chicago, will be blinded to group assignment. The HCCQ will also be completed as part of the patient and caregiver packets in follow up time points for comparison. 
 1.3.2. Press-Ganey  Patient Satisfaction Survey (Follow-up): The P ress Ganey patient satisfaction 
survey consists of a standardized set of questions that measure patient satisfaction in a given healthcare setting.  The survey also represents one of the most widely used methods in the ambulatory setting.  Additional questions may be added to the survey in order to assess unique services or performance improvement issues for a specific organization.  The Press Ganey survey has been utilized to assess patient -reported outcomes in satisfaction  for research studies in a 
number of areas within healthcare, including emergency and cardiovascular medicine.
15  Measures 
were selected from the Press Ganey survey for utilization in the current protocol to assess patient satisfaction with their oncology care related to their physician/healthcare provider, personal issues related to their care, experience with chemotherapy, and an overall assessment of their care.   
 1.3.3. FACT:  Quality of life will be measured using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness 
Therapy tool.  Although there are sev eral validated tools for QoL , the FACT has been validated in 
the geriatric population.
16,[ADDRESS_455807] 
reliability.18  
1.3.4. Karnofsky Self-Reported Performance Status:  This one item question will assess impact of cancer and cancer symptoms on overall health.   
1.3.5. MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI):  Symptoms will be assessed using the MD -
Anderson symptom inventory (MDASI) tool.  This is a brief patient- reported measure assessing 
the impact of cancer -related symptoms.  This 19-question survey assesses [ADDRESS_455808] frequency and/or severity in cancer patients.  It also includes items 
relating to symptom interference with dail y life.  Studies have demonstrated good internal 
reliability.
19   
1.3.6. Emotional  Distress:  Different domains of emotional distress will be assessed.  The Distress 
Thermometer is widely used by [CONTACT_364931] (on a 0-
10 scale).[ADDRESS_455809]. Hurria found that 41% of older patients with cancer (n=245) report significant 
distress and found an association between higher distress (≥ 4) and poorer physical function, increased comorbid medical conditions, and poor eyesight.
21  Perceived burdensomeness was 
assessed using one item from the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire- Revised (INQ -R).22  
Okuyama  et al.’s study of cancer patients’ reluctance to disclose their emotional distress to their 
physician assesses 4 domains of emotional distress: no perceived need, fear of negative impact, negative attitude, and hesitation using the instrument, Reluctance to Disclose Emotional Distress (RDED).
23   
1.4. Communication and Decision- Making Preferences  
1.4.1. Peace, Equanimity, and Acceptance in the Cancer Experience (PEACE)***[ADDRESS_455810] a sense of peaceful acceptance of their terminal illness. Evaluated in 160 patients with advanced cancer, the 12- item PEACE 
URCC13070 Protocol 2017 -04-25     Page 48 of 56 questionnaire has 2 subscales: a 7-item Struggle With Illness subscale (Cronbach’s alpha = .81) 
and a 5-item Peaceful Acceptance subscale (alpha = 0.78). Both subscales were associated with 
patients' self -reported peacefulness (correlation coefficient [r] = 0.66 for acceptance [P <0.01]; r = 
-0.37 for struggle [P <0 .01]).  This measure has been adapted for use with caregivers through [CONTACT_10785]’s work.  
1.4.2.  The Perceived Efficacy in Patient -Physician Interact ions (PEPPI) scale*** 
25 measures 
patients’ and caregivers’ confidence in their ability to communicate their concerns, obtain and understand information, ask questions, clarify uncertainties, and make sure that their doctor understands them.   In older patients, a 5-item short form of the PEPPI [INVESTIGATOR_364882]'s alphas of 0.83.  PEPPI [INVESTIGATOR_364883], correlating positively with active copi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (r= 0.17, P=0.03), and with patient satisfaction with physician interpersonal 
manner (r=0.49, P < 0.01) and communication (r=0.51, P < 0.01).  
1.4.3.  Control Preferences Scale***
26 assesses whether patients and  caregivers  would want an 
active, passive, or shared decision -making process with their doctors. This tool has been validated 
for use in advanced cancer patients, older patients, and caregivers.27,28   
1.4.4. MUIS -Complexity Subscale :29  Complexity is one of four validated subscales of the MUIS 
that addresses cues about treatment and system of care that are multiple and varied.  
2. CRA Packet  (CRA fills out at visits)  
2.1. Tumor and Treatment Characteristics: The tumor stage, previous surgery or radiation, 
chemotherapy type, dosing, and schedule (intended and received), other cancer treatments, and 
supportive care medications will be captured by [CONTACT_2689].  Survival status at [ADDRESS_455811] the pat ient’s previous treatments for 
his/her advanced cancer. 
 
2.2. KPS Physician Rated:  The CRA will obtain the physician’s assessment of the impact of cancer and cancer treatment on the patient’s overall function.   
2.3. Geriatric Assessment  
2.3.1.  Timed Up and Go***:
30  The Timed Up & Go is a performance based test of functional 
status, measuring how many  seconds it takes to stand up from a standard arm-chair, walk 3 
meters (10 feet), turn, walk back to the chair, and sit down again. In community dwelling 
older adults, there was inter -rater and intra- rater reliability  (intra-class correlation coefficient 
0.99 for both).  
2.3.2. Mini-Cog:  A tool that is validated in the geriatric population to quickly assess cognitive 
impairment.31,[ADDRESS_455812]. 
2.3.3.  Short Blessed Orientation -Memory-Concentration (BOMC) Test ***:  A six -question 
evaluation that screens for cognitive impairment.  Studies have shown its validity as a screening instrument and the correlation of its results with those of more extensive mental status tests.
33   
2.3.4.  Nutritional Status and Mini Nutrition Assessment (MNA):  Screening for nutritional 
deficit will be performed with body mass index (B MI) evaluation and self-reported weight 
loss.  Further nutritional evaluation will be performed with the Mini-Nutritional 
URCC13070 Protocol 2017 -04-25     Page 49 of 56 Assessment*** (MNA)34, a well validated screening measure for nutritional deficiency which 
has shown to be prognostic of survival in older patients with cancer . Weight will be assessed 
at each time point.  Height will be measured at baseline.  
2.3.5.  Short Physical Performance Battery:35 Physical performance measures objectively 
evaluate mobility and fall risk. Falls are common in older cancer patients and predictive of 
adverse outcomes.   
2.3.6. Labs:  CRA will send results of baseline tests  collected includ ing hemoglobin, liver 
function tests, and renal function.   
2.3.7. Polypharmacy  will be ascertained from the medical record after patients have been asked 
to review their medication list on file for any changes in the Polypharmacy Log and 
Polypharmacy High Risk D rug Review . 
 
3. Caregiver Packet   
3.1. Demographics***:  Age, race and ethnicity, gender, highest level of education achieved, 
employment status, marital status, and presence of a living companion will be captured.  Additionally, we will collect information on underlying health conditions ( Physical Health) . 
3.2. Caregiver Reaction Assessment (CRA)
36 is designed to measure the reactions of family members 
to caring for elderly relatives. The instrument consists of five dimensions (caregiver’s esteem, lack 
of family support, finances, schedule, and health).   Items are rated on a 5 -point scale (from 
"strongly agree" to "strongly disagree").  The CRA allows for me asurement of p ositive and 
negative reactions to caregiving.  
3.3. The 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF- 12):37  This measure was  developed for the Medical 
Outcomes Study (MOS), a multi-year study of patients with chronic conditions.  The measure assesses functional health and well -being. 
3.4. Cost of Care :
[ADDRESS_455813] and directs costs associated 
with taking care of a cancer patient.   
3.5. Ryff measure of psychological well-being:[ADDRESS_455814] assessment of well -being has 
been studied within numerous settings.  The environmental mastery subscale will be used to assess how well the caregiver perceives that he/she is managing responsibilities.   
3.6. Psychological well -being: The caregiver  psychological wellbeing will be assessed with two 
measures, PHQ2 and GAD-7***. Caregiver’s perspective on patients’ psychological well- being 
will be captured with AD -8.
40 
3.7. Caregivers will also complete 1.2.5., 1.3.1., 1.3.2., 1.3.6., and measures within 1.4.  
4. Physician Assessment   
4.1. Physician Baseline Demographics and Treatment Preferences***:   Age, race and ethnicity, 
gender, and details on medical practice will be captured. We will also capture patient volume, and 
specify years of training after fellowship.  We will assess comfort with shared decision making in 
the baseline survey.  The goal of shared decision - making is to make decisions in a manner 
consistent with the patient's wishes. The patient drives the process. Determining where on the shared decision-making continuum the patient feels most comfortable requires clear communication and dedicated time from the physician.  Several studies have utilized the proposed measure for assessing the relationship of physician decision -making styles on clinical 
outcomes.
28,41,42 
URCC13070 Protocol 2017 -04-25     Page 50 of 56 4.2. Situational Vignettes***:   Physicians will be presented with one of eight clinical s cenarios of an 
elderly cancer patient with a variety of geriatric -related impairments (i.e. physical frailty, cognitive 
impairment).  A series of questions will follow each vignette inquiring about the likelihood of the 
physician to offer chemotherapy in t he scenario and details regarding the regimen that would be 
considered (i.e. chemotherapy type, dosing, etc.).   Only one vignette will be provided to each physician.  The survey will not be repeated with each subsequent patient. 
 Treatment Decision -Making Form (after each audiotaped visit):  Physicians will complete a short 
(<10 questions) follow-up survey requesting information on the treatment plan for the patient and 
factors that influenced how the decision was made.  This follow-up survey is adapted fr om work 
by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Dale and [CONTACT_96600] evaluating how decisions are made for starting hormonal treatment for prostate cancer. Physicians will be asked to identify factors that influenced their decision in 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a treatment plan for each specific patient ( i.e., age, stage of disease, performance 
status, geriatric measures).  Physicians will rank each factor to determine which are most influential in their decision ma king process.  Physicians will also be asked if results of geriatric 
assessment influenced their decision -making.  If physicians have multiple patients enrolled on 
study, this survey will be completed for each individual patient.  
4.3.  Physician Follow-up Survey (follow- up):  Physicians will complete a brief survey on REDCap, 
which will ask them abou t confidence in geriatrics and their opi[INVESTIGATOR_364884] (for intervention arm). Some questions asked at baseline will be repeated at study completion. 
4.4. Understanding of Disease-Physician 
a: Measures what the physician believes about the patient’s 
illness.  
5.  Audio-recordings of oncologist- patient visit  
A CRA will audio -record the patient -oncologist consultation. This visit must occur after the geriatric 
assessment is completed and before treatment initiation.  A medical consultation should be scheduled 
prior to start of c ancer treatment  (if planned).  We  will assess the number of age- related concerns 
brought up by [CONTACT_88122] .  We will also assess how the physician addresses these 
concerns.  Our team has exper ience with all of the study measures.  Transcriptionists  will transcribe 
all audio-recorded visits and will be blinded to study condition.  Coders will undergo extensive 
training and supervision by [CONTACT_339474]. Transcriptionists and coders will not be part of the study team or involved in any other aspects of the study, and will be blinded to study hypotheses and site assignments to intervention or control.   Further, during analysis, study team members will be blinded to site assignments of in tervention or control.

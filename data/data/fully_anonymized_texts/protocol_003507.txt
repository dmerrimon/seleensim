Phase 3  
Rationale 
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is constantly damaged by [CONTACT_466443] 
(environmental) assaults. Normal cells repair single -strand breaks (SSBs) in DNA through a 
process known as base excision repair ( BER) .1 While there are several variations of BER, all 
pathways rely on the activity of poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP] -ribose) polymerase 
(PARP) enzymes.  SSBs that are not repaired result in stalled replication forks and the 
development of double -strand breaks  (DSBs), which are in turn repaired by [CONTACT_466444] (HR) DNA repair, a complex process involving multiple proteins, including those encoded by [CONTACT_466445] 1 and 2 ( BRCA 1 and BRCA2 ), as well as 
ataxia telangiectasia mutated  serine/threonine kinase (ATM), RAD51 , Fanconi anemia core 
complex, and ataxia telangiectasia and RAD3 -related (ATR) protein, among others.

Homologous recombination defects or PARP inhibition on their own can be overcome by a cell, but the combination is fatal, a concept termed “synthetic lethality”, and which forms the 
basis of the therapeutic approach of using PARP inhibition to kill cancer cells with a 
HR-deficient background.
1-[ADDRESS_598034] common cause of cancer -related mortality, with approximately 30,000 men dying 
of the disease each year .4 Based upon GLOBOC AN 2012 estimates, prostate cancer is the 
second  leading malignancy diagnosis and fifth  leading cause of death from cancer in men in 
worldwide, with 307,000 deaths estimated in 2012 .5 The course of prostate cancer from 
diagnosis to death is often  a series of clinical states progressing from localized disease to 
metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), a disease state characterized by 
[CONTACT_466446][INVESTIGATOR_014] (ADT) and that accounts for the majority 
of prostate cancer deaths.

Clinical Study Protocol : CO-338 -063 Amendment 4   18 February 2022 
Confidential Page  6 Homologous recombinati on deficiency (HRD) has been observed in many carcinomas, 
including prostate cancer. Men with a germline mutation in BRCA2 are at increased risk for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_171278], estimated at 2.[ADDRESS_598035] more aggressive features and  higher mortality rates. While less common in prostate 
cancer, germline mutations in BRCA1 are also associated with more aggressive disease.
7 In 
addition to germline mutations in BRCA1/2, somatic mutations in BRCA1/2 and other 
homologous recombination repair (HR R) genes ( eg, ATM, Fanconi anemia, complementation 
group A [FANCA] ) have been shown to occur in advanced prostate cancer, suggesting that a 
significant percentage of patients with mCRPC may benefit from approaches exploiting a 
deficiency in HR R, such as treatment with a PARP inhibitor (PARPi ).8 A recent clinical study 
reported that 16 of 49 evaluable patients with advanced heavily pre -treated mCRPC had a 
response to the PARPi  [CONTACT_395365] . Among the 16 evaluable patients in this study with HRR gene 
mutations , 14 (88%) had a response. Consistent with previous findings, gene mutations  were 
most commonly observed in BRCA2 and ATM.9 These findings provide compelling evidence 
for use  of a PARPi [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a selected population of m CRPC patients with predicted loss -of-function 
mutations  in BRCA1/[ADDRESS_598036] -line systemic treatment for metastatic 
prostate cancer. It is highly active with clinica l, radiographic and prostate -specific antigen 
(PSA) responses for most patients – but almost all men will eventually progress to mCRPC. 
Over the last [ADDRESS_598037] been shown to confer a survival benefit for 
patients with mCRPC and were  approved on this basis, including docetaxel, cabazitaxel , 
Sipuleucel -T, radium Ra 223 dichloride, and two  agents that target the androgen receptor  (AR) 
pathway, abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide.10-[ADDRESS_598038] -line 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_171284] ; however, patients progress on these agents after a median duration of 
16 to 18 months on treatment. Some patients receive a second regimen of AR -directed 
therapy; however, response rates are low in this setting.18-[ADDRESS_598039] 
progressed on AR -directed therapy, systemic chemotherapy is the next treatment option. 
Treatment options include docetaxel (75  mg/m2 every 3 weeks) plus prednisone, cabazitaxel 
plus prednisone, radium Ra [ADDRESS_598040] represents an attractive opti on. 
Primary Objective: 
• To assess the efficacy of rucaparib versus physician’s choice of treatment based on 
radiographic progression free survival (rPFS ) in mCRPC patients with HRD  who 
Rucaparib Clovis Oncology, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol : CO-[ADDRESS_598041] not yet received chemotherapy in the 
castration -resistant setting .  
Secondary Objectives : 
• To assess overall survival (OS)  
• To assess objective response rate (ORR)  using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) Version 1.1 in patients with measurable (nodal or visceral) 
disease  
• To assess duration of response (DOR)  using modified RECIST Version 1.1  in patients with 
measurable (nodal or visceral) disease 
• To assess time to PSA progression  
• To assess PSA response ≥  50% (all patients)  
• To assess PSA response ≥  90% (all patients)  
• To evaluate Patient -reported Outcome (PRO) using the following instruments:  
- EuroQol 5 dimensions 5 level questionnaire (EQ -5D-5L),  
- Functional Assessment of Cancer Ther apy–Prostate (FACT -P),  
- Analgesic drug score, and  
- Brief Pain Inventory–Short Form (BPI -SF) instruments  
• To assess clinical benefit rate (CBR)  
• To assess sparse  pharmacokinetics ( PK)  
• To assess safety and tolerability  
Exploratory Objectives:  
• To assess concordance in BRCA/ATM  gene mutation status in matched Pre -Screening  
biopsy tissue, archival primary and metastatic tumor tissue , and plasma circulating 
cell-free tumor DNA ( ctDNA) 
• To assess changes in the molecular profile over time of matched pre and post -treatment 
tumor or plasma samples  
• To evaluate loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in metastatic disease site biopsy and archival 
primary  and metastatic  tumor tissue samples  
• To evaluate mechanisms of response and resistance in ctDNA and progression tumor tissue samples.  
Study Design  
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, study of rucaparib versus physician’s choice of second -line AR-directed therapy (abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide) or docetaxel as 
treatment for mCRPC patients who have  progressed on one prior AR-directed therapy  
(abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide,  apalutamide,  or investigational AR -targeted agent)  and 
have not yet received chemotherapy in the castrat ion-resistant setting. Patients who received 
prior PARPi [INVESTIGATOR_466410]. This study will enroll mCRPC patients with

Confidential Page  8 deleterious mutations in BRCA1/2 or ATM  genes . The primary endpoint is rPFS  by [CONTACT_466447] ( IRR; rPFSirr) using modified RECIST Version 1.1/ Prostate 
Cancer  Working Group Guidelines Version 3 ( PCWG3 ) criteria.  
This study consists of a Pre-Screening Phase , Screening Phase, Randomization, Treatment 
Phase , Post-Treatment Phase, and Cross -over Phase (if applicable) . Patients will receive 
rucaparib monotherapy or physician’s choice of comparator therapy  (pre- designated prior to 
randomization) in the Treatment Phase, and will undergo procedures and assessments 
including regular safety and efficacy evaluatio ns during the entire conduct of the study. 
Patients randomized to the control arm  in the Treatment Phase will have the opportunity to 
receive treatment with rucaparib in the C ross-over Phase . 
Pre-Screening Phase 
The purpose of the Pre -Screening Phase is to  perform central plasma and  tumor tissue testing 
to identify patients with qualifying deleterious BRCA1/2 or ATM  gene mutations. If a patient 
has a  qualifying deleterious  BRCA1/[ADDRESS_598042] evidence of radiographic or 
biochemical disease progression, and be eligible for this study as their immediate next therapy. 
Patient tissue and plasma samples should be submitted simultaneously during Pre -Screening. 
Tissue submitted for Pre -Screening testing should be from a newly obtained metastatic biopsy, 
if there is a lesion  suitable for biopsy and the patient consents  to this procedure. A biopsy or 
resection of a visceral or nodal site of metastasis is  preferred;  however, biopsy of primary 
tumor or of a site of bony metastasis is  also acceptable. If a metastatic biopsy is not feasible, 
archival tissue samples should be submitted, if available. To reduce the chance of test failure, archival tissue should be < 3 years old.  
Screening Phase 
The purpose of the Screening Phase is to perform study- specific screening assessments, ot her 
than testing for qualifying  deleterious  BRCA1/[ADDRESS_598043] a deleterious gene mutation in BRCA1/[ADDRESS_598044]  be documented in the patient’s medical record .  
Randomization 
Eligible patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive rucaparib (600  mg twice a day  [BID]) or 
physician’s choice of either docetaxel or AR -directed therapy (abiraterone acetate or 
enzalutamide, whichever the patient has not yet received ). The physician’s choice of agent in 
the control arm must be prespecified prior to randomization.  
Treatment Phase 
Rucaparib will be administered at a starting dose of 600 mg BID and comparator treatments 
according to labelling  and local practice. Tumor assessments by [CONTACT_20420] 
(CT)/magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) and bone scans will be performed during the 
Screening  Phase , at the end of every 8  calendar weeks (±  7 days) from Study Day  1 (Week  1) 
up to 24 weeks and every 12 calendar weeks (±  7 days) thereafter, and at the Treatment 
Discontinuation Visit, if applicable. Modified RECIST Version 1.1 criteria will be used to 
document radio graphic  response in soft tissue (visceral and nodal) disease and PCWG3 criteria 
Rucaparib Clovis Oncology, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol : CO-338 -063 Amendment 4   18 February 2022 
Confidential Page  9 will be used to document radio graphic  progression of bone lesions. Any drug modifications 
(interr uption, dose reduction,  or discontinuation) should be documented in the electronic case 
report form (eCRF ) and source documents. If study treatment is interrupted, tumor 
assessments will not be delayed and will proceed on the regular study schedule. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_466411], at which time IRR will be discontinued and all radiographic 
scans will be evaluated by [CONTACT_466448] . 
Patients will receive study drug until radiographic disease progression is confirmed by [CONTACT_466449], or by [CONTACT_466450] i s discontinued, based on 
modified RECIST Version 1.1  (for nodal/visceral lesions only)  and PCWG3 (for bone lesions 
only) criteria, unequivocal clinical disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or inability to tolerate further treatment, loss to follow -up, or withdrawal of consent. Patients in the docetaxel 
arm will receive study drug for a maximum of [ADDRESS_598045] consent prior to 
continuing treatment with study drug. 
Safety and efficacy data will be periodically reviewed by  [CONTACT_269395] ( IDMC).  
Post-treatment Phase  
Upon treatment discontinuation, patients will have a Treatment Discontinuation Visit, a 
28-day Follow -up Visit, and then will proceed to long- term follow- up. An optional tumor 
biopsy will be collected  prior to the start of subsequent anticancer therapy from patients who 
experience radiographic disease progression or unequivocal clinical disease progression and 
provide appropriate consent.  
Radio graphic tumor assessment s (using the same methodology as was used at initial study 
screening [eg, CT scan  and bone scan]) will continue until radiographic disease progression is 
confirmed  by [CONTACT_466451] , irrespective of whether the patient has initiated subsequent anticancer 
therapy . Once the analysis of the primary endpoint has been performed, radiographic scans 
will continue to be performed by [CONTACT_466452] s chedule of assessments 
until radiographic disease progression is determined by [CONTACT_093]; scans  will no longer 
be submitted to or read by [CONTACT_466451].  
Ongoing serious adverse events ( SAEs ), adverse events  of special interest (AESIs), and 
treatment -related Grade 3/4 adverse events ( AEs) will be followed until either resolution or 
stabilization has been determined or until lost to follow -up. After the 28 -day Follow -up Visit, 
Rucaparib Clovis Oncology, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol : CO-338 -063 Amendment 4   18 February 2022 
Confidential Page  10 only SAEs assessed as potentially related to study drug should be reported per Clovis 
Oncology Pharmacovigilance (PV) requirements and captured in the Clovis Oncology PV 
database.  
After the 28 -day Follow -up Visit, AESIs of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute 
myeloid leukemia (AML), irrespective of causality, should be reported  per Clovis 
Oncology PV requirements and captured in the Clovis Oncology PV database.  
• AESIs of pneumonitis or similar  events (ie,  interstitial lung disease, pulmonary fibrosis, 
acute interstitial pneumonitis, alveolitis necrotizing, alveolitis, hypersensitivity 
pneumonitis , and organizing pneumonia) should be reported up to, but not beyond, the 
28-Day Follow -up Visit (28- days after the last dose of rucaparib). After the 28 -day 
Follow- up Visit, only pneumonitis or similar events meeting the criteria for an SAE  and 
assessed a s potentially related to study drug should be reported per Clovis Oncology PV 
requirements . 
 
All patients will be followed for survival and subsequent treatments every 12  weeks 
(± 14 days) relative to the last dose of study drug until death, loss to follow- up, withdrawal of 
consent, or study closure.  
Cross -over Phase  
Patients randomized to comparator therapy will be given the opportunity to cross -over to 
receive rucaparib therapy after radiographic progression is confirmed by [CONTACT_466453] , or by [CONTACT_466454]. After providing consent, 
patients will be assessed to ensure  criteria  are met for the Cross -over Phase. I f eligible, the 
patient will have protocol assessments per the rucaparib Treatment Phase, as well as  including 
the Post -Treatment Phase.  
Blinding 
This is an open- label study; the study drugs will not be blinded or masked to the investigator 
or patient, so each will know the treatment being administered. A Blinding Plan will be put in 
place to limit the knowledge of aggregate efficacy data by [CONTACT_151670].  
Number of Patients  
The total enrollment planned for this study is approximately 400 patients . A total of  
approximately 300 patients with a deleterious BRCA1/2 gene mutation will be randomized  
and a pproximately 100 patients with a  deleterious ATM gene mutation may be randomized . 
This is a multicenter, multinational study. Patients will be randomized  across approximately 
150 study sites worldwide .

Randomization 
Eligible patients w ill be randomized 2:1 to receive rucaparib (600  mg BID) or physician’s 
choice (specified prior to randomization) of either docetaxel or  AR-directed therapy 
(abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide, whichever the patient has not yet received ). 
Randomization will occur by a central randomization procedure using an Interactive Response 
System ( IXRS ). The following will be included as randomization stratification factors at study 
entry to ensure treatment groups are balanced:  
• ECOG Status 0 vs 1  
• Presence of hepatic metastases or not  
• BRCA1  vs BRCA2 vs ATM  gene mutation  
Study Treatment  
Rucaparib:  
The starting dose and schedule of rucaparib is [ADDRESS_598062]  8 oz (240 mL) of water 
as close to 12  hours apart as possible, preferably at the same times every day. Rucaparib may 
be provided as 200, 250 and 300 mg (as free base) dose strength tablets.  Tablets should be 
swallowed whole.  
Dose holds or reductions are permitted in the event of unacceptable toxicity.  
Abiraterone acetate plus prednisone : 
The starting dose of abiraterone is 1,000 mg orally once a day  (QD). No food should be eaten 
for at least 2 hours before  and 1 hour after  dosing. Abiraterone should be swallowed whole 
with water. Prednisone should be administered concomitantly at a dose of 10 mg orally daily . 
Enzalutamide:  
The starting dose of enzalu tamide is 160  mg orally QD. Enzalutamide may be taken with or 
without food.  Enzalutamide  should be swallowed whole with water.

Confidential Page  14 Docetaxel  plus prednisone  or prednisolone : 
Docetaxel at a dose of 75  mg/m2 should be administered intravenously (IV) every  3 weeks , for 
up to a maximum of 10 cycles (whereupon no additional study treatment shall be given, but 
assessments continue) . Docetaxel is g iven in combination with prednisone or prednisolone

criteria, unequivocal clinical disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or inability to tolerate 
further treatment, loss to follow -up, or withdrawal of consent.  
Dose modifications of comparator drugs are permitted according to the label and local 
institution treatment guidelines . 
If a patient receiving study drug has met criteria for confirmed radiographic disease 
progression by [CONTACT_466455] 1.1 and/or PCWG3 criteria, but the patient 
continues to derive clinical benefit per the investigator, then continuation of treatment will be permitted with additional consent.  
Concomitant Medications  
During the study, supportive care (eg, antiemetics; analgesics for  pain control) may be used at 
the investigator’s discretion and in accordance with institutional procedures. Supportive care 
must be recorded for each patient in the appropriate section of the eCRF .  
Erythropoietin, darbepoetin alfa, and/or hematopoietic c olony- stimulating factors for treatment 
of cytopenias should be administered per standard of care and according to institutional 
guidelines. Transfusion thresholds for blood product support will be in accordance with institutional guidelines.  
Palliative ra diotherapy for the treatment of painful bony metastasis is permitted during the 
study. Treatment with  rucaparib  should be held prior to initiation of radiation therapy and until 
the patient has recovered from any radiation- related  toxicity.  Radiotherapy to  soft-tissue 
lesions (either target or non- target) renders these inevaluable by [CONTACT_466457]  1.1, and is 
therefore discouraged during the Treatment Phase of the study.  
For patients who have not undergone an orchiectomy and are currently being treated wi th 
LHRH analogs at the time of consent, therapy must be continued throughout the study.  
No other anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including chemotherapy, radiation, antibody, immunotherapy, 
gene therapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, or other experimental drugs) of any kind will be permitted while the patient is participating in the study with the exception of LHRH analogs and palliative radiotherapy for painful bony metastases.  
Initiation of bisphosphonates or other approved bone targeting agents is allowed, if clinically  
indicated, and should not result in study treatment discontinuation unless patient has 
radiographic evidence of disease progression.

Efficacy Assessments  
Soft tissue (visceral and nodal) disease will be evaluated for evidence of radiographic response 
based on modified RECIST  Version  1.1 criteria. Bone lesions will be followed and evaluated 
for evidence of radio graphic progression based on PCWG3 criteria. Additionally, PSA 
response will be evaluated.  
Tumor assessments will be performed during screening (baseline), at the end of every 
8 calendar weeks (±  7 days) relative to Study Day  1 (Week 1) up to 24 weeks, the n every 
12 calendar weeks (±  7 days), until confirmed radiographic disease progression by [CONTACT_466458] 1.1 and/or PCWG3 (for bone lesions only) criteria, loss to follow -up, 
withdrawal, or study closure. Tumor assessments will continue to be perf ormed until 
radiographic disease progression is confirmed by [CONTACT_466451].  After the primary endpoint analysis is 
performed, confirmation of radiographic progression by [CONTACT_466459]- assessed radiographic progression performed. If a complete response (CR) or 
partial response (PR) is noted, confirmatory scans should be performed at least [ADDRESS_598066] of clinical examination and appropriate imaging techniques 
(ie, CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with appropriate slice thickness per modified 
RECIST Version 1.1); other studies (MRI, X -ray, positron emission tomography ( PET)/CT, 
and ultrasound) may also be performed if required. If a site can document that the CT 
performed as part of a PET/CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV 
and oral contrast) then the CT portion of the PET/CT can be used for RECIST  Version  1.1 
measurements. Radionuclide bone scanning (whole body) should be performed using 99mTc -
methylene diphosphonate (MDP) or hydroxydiphosphonate (HDP) . All sites of disease should 
be followed and the same methods used to detect lesions at baseline are to be used to follow 
Rucaparib Clovis Oncology, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol : CO-[ADDRESS_598067] and bone scans (and other im aging, as appropriate) from the Treatment Phase of 
the study will be submitted for IRR  for all patients . Once the analysis of the primary endpoint 
has been performed, radiographic scans will continue to be performed by [CONTACT_466460]; scans  will no longer be submitted to or read by [CONTACT_466451]. After analysis of the 
primary endpoint, investigator -assessed radiographic disease progression will be used for 
cross- over eligibility evaluation. Radiographic assessments from the C ross-over P hase will not 
be submitted for IRR . 
PSA will be measured locally at Screening, each clinic visit, and at the Treatment 
Discontinuation V isit. 
Safety Assessments  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed based on the following:  
• Incidence, type, seriousness, and severity of AEs reported;  
• Clinical laboratory investigations (hematology , serum chemistry  and urinalysis ); 
• Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse , and body temperature);  
• 12-lead electrocardiograms ( ECGs ); 
• Physical examinations; and 
• ECOG perfor mance status  
Statistical Methods  
Sample Size Justification  
The total enrollment planned is approximately 400 patients, w ith approximately 300 patients 
in the subgroup with a deleterious BRCA 1/2 mutation  and approximately 100 patients in the 
subgroup with a deleterious ATM mutation . The median rPFS is assumed to be 6 months for 
the control arm and 10 months for rucaparib in the subgroup of patients with a deleterious 
BRCA 1/2 mutation  and 9 months for ruca parib in the total population . A sample size of 
approximately 300 patients in the subgroup with a deleterious BRCA 1/2 mutation  should 
result in approximately 200 events of rPFS, which will provide approximately 90%  power to 
detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0. 6 at a one -sided 0.025 significance level.  A sample size of 
approximately 400 total patients should result in approximately 270 events of rPFS, which will 
provide approximately 90%  power to detect a HR of 0.[ADDRESS_598068] be tested amo ng the patients with a 
deleterious BRCA 1/2 mutation  and then in the intent -to-treat (ITT) Population (ie, BRCA +

subgroup of patients with a deleterious BRCA 1/2 mutation  is statistically significant, then

Clinical Study Protocol : CO-338 -063 Amendment 4   18 February 2022 
Confidential Page  17 rPFSirr will be tested in the ITT Population . Continuing in an ordered step -down manner, the 
key secondary endpoints of  OS and ORR (by [CONTACT_466451]) will be tested at the two -sided 0.05 
significance level. To preserve the overall Type  1 error rate, statistical significance will only 
be declared for a secondary endpoint if the primary endpoints and previous secondary 
endpoints are a lso statistically significant in the ordered step- down procedure.  
Quantitative variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics. For variables registered on a continuous scale, the following will be presented: N, mean, standard deviation  (StD) , 
median, minimum and maximum. Categorical variables will be presented using frequencies and percentages. The Kaplan -Meier methodology will be used to summarize time -to-event 
variables. The stratified HR from the Cox proportional hazards model will be used to estimate 
the HR between the randomized treatment groups  for the primary endpoint .  
Primary Efficacy Analysis  
rPFSirr is defined as the time from randomization to the first objective evidence of 
radiographic progression, or death due to any cause (whichever occurs first). Radiographic 
disease progression includes soft tissue disease progression as per modified RECIST  Version  1.1 and confirmed progression of bone disease per PCWG3 criteria.  rPFS , as 
assessed by [CONTACT_093] (rPFSinv) , is defined similarly and will be supportive of the 
primary endpoint, rPFSirr .  
Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
Overall survival time will be calculated as the time from randomization to death (by [CONTACT_55544]) +[ADDRESS_598070] 
known to be alive. OS will be analyzed at the time of the primary analysis (interim OS 
analysis) and again for a final OS analysis  when maturity is reached .  
ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with a confirmed response of CR or  PR using 
modified RECIST Version 1.1 (ie, CR or PR by [CONTACT_466461]3).  Per RECIST  Version 1.[ADDRESS_598071] reported to the time that 
disease progression is documented including that in bone  (modifie d RECIST  
Version  1.1/PCWG3 criteria) . 
Time to PSA progression is defined as the time from randomization to the date that a ≥  25% 
increase and absolute increase of ≥  2 ng/mL above the nadir (or baseline value for patients 
who did not have a decline in PSA) in PSA was measured. The increase must be confirmed by 
a second consecutive assessment conducted at least 3 weeks later.  
Confirmed PSA response is defined as ≥  50% (or  ≥ 90%) reduction in PSA from baseline to 
lowest post -baseline PSA result, with a consecutive assessment conducted at least [ADDRESS_598072]- baseline assessment. PSA will be assessed by a local laboratory.  
CBR is defined as the combination of CR, PR, and stable disease ( SD) as defined by [CONTACT_466458]  1.1 with no progression in bone per PCWG3 criteria.  
Safety Analyses  
AEs, clinical laboratory results, vital signs, ECOG performance status, body weight, and 
concomitant medications/proce dures will be tabulated and summarized. AEs will be 
Rucaparib Clovis Oncology, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol : CO-338 -063 Amendment 4   18 February 2022 
Confidential Page  18 summarized overall and separately for SAEs, AESIs, AEs leading to discontinuation, AEs 
leading to death, and Grade 3 or higher AEs graded using NCI -CTCAE Version  4.03 or 
higher. Body weight and vital signs will be summarized descriptively (N, mean, StD , median, 
minimum, and maximum). ECOG performance status will be summarized categorically.  
An IDMC will review safety and efficacy data on a periodic basis to ensure an acceptable 
overall risk and benefit for patients participating in the study.  
Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
An IDMC with multidisciplinary representation will regularly evaluate benefit -risk during the 
study, and recommend any potential changes to study conduct . No formal efficacy or futility 
interim analyses for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_123410]; however, OS will be analyzed  at the time of 
the primary analysis  (interim OS analysis)  and again for a final OS analysis when matur ity is 
reached . The IDMC may recommend that t he study be stopped if there is excessive toxicity 
observed in the rates of serious and/or Grade 3 and 4 AEs .

Clinical Study Protocol : CO-[ADDRESS_598090] 
Rucaparib (CO -338) is a small molecule inhibitor of poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP] -ribose) 
polymerase ( PARP ) being developed for the treatment of cancer associated with homologous 
recombination deficiency (HRD) . Rucaparib has been  shown to potently inhibit PARP -1, 
PARP -2, and PARP -[ADDRESS_598091] cancer gene 1 or 2 (BRCA1  and BRCA2 ) mutations in both clinical and nonclinical 
studies. 
Clovis Oncology, Inc. is developi[INVESTIGATOR_466419] -resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) associated with HRD, including patients with a 
deleterious mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2 and ataxia telangiectasia mutated serine/threonine 
kinase (ATM) and other  homologous recombination repair  (HRR) gene mutations.  
3.2 Background and Rationale for PARP Inhibition 
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is constantly damaged by [CONTACT_466443] 
(environmental) assaults. Endogenous causes include spontaneous base changes, replication 
errors, and oxygen- free radicals. Exogenous agents of DNA damage include  chemicals and both 
ultraviolet and ionizing radiation. A common type of DNA damage is the formation of DNA single- strand  breaks (SSBs). Normal cells repair SSBs in DNA through a process known as base 
excision repair (BER).
[ADDRESS_598092] characterized.22 SSBs that are not repaired result in stalled replication forks 
and the development of double -strand breaks (DSBs), which are in turn repaired by  [CONTACT_104634], a 
complex process involving multiple proteins, including BRCA1  and BRCA2 , as well as RAD51, 
Fanconi anemia core complex, ATM , and ataxia telangiectasia and RAD3 -related (ATR) protein, 
among others .[ADDRESS_598093] as a functional buffer to enable normal cells to survive 
the effects of PARP and BER inhibition and overcome DSB in DNA. Homologous recombination defects or PARP inhibition on their own can be overcome by a cell, but the 
combination is fatal, a concept termed “synthetic lethality”, which forms the basis of the therapeuti c approach of using PARP inhibition to kill cancer cells with HRD .
1-[ADDRESS_598094] common malignancy among men in the [LOCATION_002]  (US) , and the 
second -most common cause of cancer -related mortality, with approximately 30,[ADDRESS_598095] androgen deprivation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_466420].

Clinical Study Protocol : CO-[ADDRESS_598096] more aggressive features and higher 
mortality rates; while less common in prostate cancer, germline mutations in BRCA1  are also 
associated with more aggressive disease.[ADDRESS_598097] cancer 2 gene ( BRCA1/2 ), somatic mutations in BRCA1/[ADDRESS_598098] 
been shown to occur in advanced prostate cancer.8 A large genomic study of mCRPC identified a 
12.7% rate of mutation/deletion in BRCA2 (of which over 90% was biallelic ), half of which was 
a germline mutation in BRCA2; a 7% rate of loss of ATM , an approximately 5% mutation rate of 
cyclin -dependent kinase  12 (CDK12 ), a previously -reported positive regulator of BRCA genes, 
and lower rates of mutation  of BRCA1 , Fanconi anemia, complementation group A ( FANCA) , 
RAD51  homolog B (RAD51B ), RAD51 homolog C ( RAD51C ), and other HR R genes. Overall, 
almost 23% of tumors were found to have a  mutation  in at least one HR R gene, and over 19% of 
tumors had either a BRCA1/2  or ATM  mutation, suggesting that in principle a significant 
percentage of patients with mCRPC may benefit from approaches exploiting a deficiency in 
homologous recombination repair, such as  treatment with  a PARP inhibitor (PARPi).8 A recent 
clinical study reported that 16 of 49 evaluable patients with advanced heavily pre -treated 
mCRPC had a response to the PARPi , olaparib . Response was defined as a Response Evaluation

3.4 Prior Experience with Rucaparib 
Refer to the current rucaparib Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for the latest relevant 
nonclinical and clinical information regarding rucaparib, including the status of ongoing 
and completed clinical studies.  
An overview of data fro m nonclinical and clinical studies with rucaparib are summarized below. 
More current additional  detail is provided in the rucaparib I nvestigator’ s Brochure  (IB). A 
summary of the benefits and risks of rucaparib treatment are also provided in the rucaparib IB. 
The nonclinical and clinical data and benefits and risks of rucaparib have been consistent over time.

multiple BRCA1/[ADDRESS_598108] that when given 
orally, rucaparib poses a low risk for causing neurobehavioral and cardiac effects in patients.  
In pharmacokinetic (PK) s tudies, rucaparib demonstrated species -dependent oral bioavailability, 
moderate plasma protein binding, and large volumes of distribution in nonclinical species. As a P-glycoprotein ( P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) substrate, rucaparib

Clinical Study Protocol : CO-338 -063 Amendment 4   18 February 2022 
Confidential Page  33 demonstrated minimal penetration of rucaparib -derived radioactivity through the blood-brain 
barrier. In  vitro  data suggested slow metabolism by [CONTACT_9058] P450 (CYP) enzymes, with 
CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 contributing to the metabolism  of 
rucaparib. Rucaparib was mainly excreted in feces in rats and dogs. In  vitro , rucaparib  reversibly 
inhibited CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP3A, and to a lesser extent CYP2C8, CYP2D6, 
and UDP -glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1). Rucaparib induced CYP1A2, and 
down- regulated CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 in human hepatocytes at clinically relevant exposures. 
Rucaparib is a potent inhibitor of multidrug and toxin extrusion protein  1 (MATE1) and 
MATE2 -K, a moderate inhibitor of organic cationic transporter 1 (OCT1), a weak inhibitor of 
OCT2, and may inhibit P -gp and BCRP in the gut.  
Oral dosing of rucaparib in single and repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs resulted in toxicity to the hematopoietic, lymphopoietic, and gastrointestinal systems. These toxicitie s were 
generally both reversible upon recovery and predictive of toxicities observed in patients. Rucaparib was shown to be clastogenic in an in vitro  chromosomal aberration assay suggesting 
potential genotoxicity in humans. Reproductive and development toxicity studies in rat showed that rucaparib caused maternal toxicity and was embryo -toxic. Although no rucaparib related 
effects on sperm total count, density, motility, or morphology were identified, based on published studies, PARP inhibitors have the potential to impair spermatogenesis and reduce 
fertility .

3.4.2  Clinical Experience with Rucaparib  
Rucaparib has been evaluated in Phase 1 , 2, and 3 clinical studies and is being evaluated in 
ongoing Phase  1, 2, and Phase  3 clinical studies. The early clinical program assessed safety and 
efficacy of rucaparib in patien ts with malignancies commonly treated with chemotherapeutic 
agents. Initially, an intravenous ( IV) formulation of rucaparib was administered in combination 
with a variety of chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; later, the oral formulation of rucaparib was administered in 
combi nation with chemotherapy and as a monotherapy. The oral formulation as monotherapy is 
the focus of current development efforts. The IV formulation is no longer in use.   
On 19 December  2016, under priority and expedited review, the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for the marketing of rucaparib (Rubraca®) 
for monotherapy treatment of patients with deleterious breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) 
mutation (germline and/or somatic) associated advanced ovarian cancer who ha ve been treated 
with 2 or more chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_466423] 06 April  2018 Rubraca was approved for use as 
monotherapy maintenance treatment for  adult patients with recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_12253]  (EOC), 
fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_76351] (FTC), or primary peritoneal cancer (PPC)  who are in response (complete 
or partial) to platinum- based chemotherapy . On 29 May 2018, the European Commission (EC) 
authorized oral rucaparib as monotherapy treatment of adult patients with platinum -sensitive, 
relapsed or progressive, BRCA -mutated (ger mline and/or somatic), high -grade EOC, FTC, or 
PPC, who have been treated with [ADDRESS_598109] summary information on indications and ongoing/completed clinical studies is

[IP_ADDRESS]  Overview of Pharmacokinetics  and Drug -Drug Interactions  
An overview of data are provided below and described in detail in the rucaparib IB.  
Assessment of rucaparib PK in cancer patients showed an approximate dose proportional 
exposure after once a day  (QD) or BID d osing, rapid absorption with maximum plasma 
concentration ( Cmax) achieved within 1.5  to 6 hours, and distribution into tissue. The oral 
bioavailability was 36% and elimination ranged from 11 to 29.8  hours. Rucaparib was 
moderately bound to human pla sma proteins in  vitro. 
At a dose of 600 mg BID rucaparib, steady state was achieved after approximately 1  week. The 
absolute oral bioavailability was 37.2%. In the presence of a high- fat meal, there was a slight 
delay in absorption, but an overall increase in exposure and oral bioavailability (51.7% [fed] vs. 
36.2% [fasted]).  
In vitro , CYP enzymes were shown to contribute to ruca parib metabolism. In a preliminary 
assessment of rucaparib metabolism in patients, rucaparib biotransformation pathways included 
hydroxylation or oxidation, N -demethylation, deamination, and phase II methylation. A

were identified as major metabolites.  
POPULATION PK ANALYSES  
Drug interactions with rucaparib as a substrate were assessed in a population PK analysis. 
CYP2D6 phenotypes (poor metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers, normal metabolizers, and 
ultra‑rapid metabolizers) and CYP1A2 phenotypes (normal metabolizers and hyperinducers) did 
not significantly impact the steady -state exposure of rucaparib at [ADDRESS_598115] of BCRP inhibition on rucaparib PK has not been studied. 
Concomitant treatment with proton pump inhibitors ( PPIs) did not show clinically significant 
effect on rucaparib PK.  No dose modification is recommended based on use PPIs.  
EFFECT OF RUCAPARIB ON THE PHARMACOKINETICS OF OTHER DRUGS  
In the “cocktail” drug -drug interaction study CO -338-044, the effects of steady -state rucaparib at 
600 mg BID  on CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A, and P -gp were evaluated with single 
oral doses of sensitive probes (caffeine, S -warfarin, omeprazole, midazolam, and digoxin, 
respectively). Data suggest that rucaparib is a moderate inhibitor of CYP1A2, a weak  inhibitor of 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A. Rucaparib also marginally inhibit ed P-gp in the gut  but the 
effect is unlikely clinically significant . Details and results of study CO -338- 044 are provided in 
the rucaparib IB .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Overview of Efficacy  
An overview of data are provided below and described in detail in the rucaparib IB.  
Efficacy analysis was based on pooled efficacy data from 106 patients with BRCA mutant ovarian cancer, who received two  or more prior chemotherapy regimens, and who initiated 
treatment with rucaparib at 600  mg BID in Part 2A of Study CO -338- 010 and Parts  1 and 2  of 
Study CO-338- 017. The enrollment cut -off date was 1 October 2015 (all 42 patients enrolled) 
and the visit data cut -off date was 30 November 2015 for Study CO -338- 010 Part 2A. The 
enrollment cut -off was a 1 October 2015 and the visit data cut -off was 29 February 2016 for 
Part 1 (24 patients) and Part 2 (40 patients) of Study CO ‑338‑017. 
Efficacy data indicate that many patients with advanced ovarian cancer associated with a BRCA1/2 gene mutation and who had two or more prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_466424] T Version  1.1 
and/or Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup ( GCIG ) cancer antigen -125 ( CA-125) responses. The 
confirmed objective response rate ( ORR) per RECIST  Version 1.1  by [CONTACT_165888] 
53.8% (57/106) and the confirmed response by [CONTACT_466457] 1.1 or GCIC  CA-125 was 
Rucaparib Clovis Oncology, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol : CO-338 -063 Amendment 4   18 February 2022 
Confidential Page  37 70.8% (75/106). The confirmed ORR per RECIST  Version 1.1 by [CONTACT_171327] 
41.5% (44/106).  
In addition, patients without a BRCA1/2 gene mutation in tumor tissue are also deriving benefit, 
with 43% achieving RECIST  Version 1.1 and/or GCIG CA -125 responses.  
In the Phase 3, randomized, double -blind study of monotherapy oral rucaparib versus placebo as 
switch maintenance treatment in patients with platinum- sensitive, relapsed, high -grade ovarian 
cancer who achieved a response to platinum -based chemotherapy  (ARIEL3), the primary 
efficacy endpoint was investigator- assessed PFS (invPFS) by [CONTACT_150114] 1.1. Three patient 
populations (tB RCA, HRD, and intent- to-treat [ ITT]) were evaluated in a step -down analysis .  
The primary endpoint was achieved as of 15 April  2017 with a highly statistically significant 
difference in invPFS between rucaparib treatment as compared to placebo for  each of the 
3 stratified primary efficacy analysis populations (p  < 0.0001 for each population) . The median 
invPFS in the tBRCA population was 16.6 months (95% CI, 13.4- 22.9) for the rucaparib group 
and 5.4 months (95% CI, 3.4- 6.7) for the placebo group. Additiona l data in HRD and ITT 
populations are available in the rucaparib IB.  
For each of the [ADDRESS_598116]  Version  1.1, in patients with measurable disease at baseline was statistically 
significantly higher in the rucaparib group compared to the placebo group. In the tBRCA 
population, the confirmed ORR was 15/40 (37.5%) for the rucaparib group and 2/23 (8.7%) for 
the placebo group (p = 0.0055). Additional data in HRD and ITT populations are available in the 
rucaparib IB.  
Three mCRPC patients with a BRCA mutation received rucaparib monotherapy in Study CO-338- [ADDRESS_598117] of whom experienced tumor 
stabilization , decrease of PSA levels, and symptom improvement . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Overview of Safety  
An overview of data are provided below and described in detail in the rucaparib IB.  
Integrated Safety Analysis  in the Treatment Setting (Studies CO -338- 010 and CO -338-017) 
An integrated safety analysis, based on pooled safety data from 545 patients  in Study 
CO-338- 010 (Parts 2A and 2B) and Study CO -338- 017 (ARIEL2; Parts 1 and 2)  with relapsed 
ovarian cancer who were treated with 600 mg B ID monotherapy rucaparib, was performed and a 
summary of treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ), overall and ≥  Grade 3, is presented in 
Table 1. This analysis includes data as of 1  September  2017. Overall, the median duration of 
treatment was 160.0  days ( approximately 5.3 months;  range, 2 to 1234 days).  
The most common  TEAEs reported  were primarily mild to moderate ( Grade 1 to 2) in severity 
and include d gastrointestinal disorders (nausea  [78.5%] , vomiting [45.9%] , constipation [37.6], 
abdominal pain (32.5%), and diarrhea  [32.3%]), asthenia/ fatigue (75.0%), anemia/decreased 
haemoglobin (44.0%), ALT/AST increased (39.3%), decreased appetite (38.3%), and dysgeusia 
(36.7%).

The most common TEAEs ≥  Grade 3 were anemia/decreased hemoglobin ( 24.2% ), 
asthenia/fatig ue (11.7%), ALT/AST increased (10.8%), thrombocytopenia/decreased platelets 
(6.1%), and nausea (5.3%). As of the data cut -off date, approximately 9 % of  patients had 
discontinued due to a treatment -related TEAE.   
In addition, photosensitivity has been reported in some patients . Photosensitivity was initially 
reported in the Phase  1 dose -escalation  portion of Study CO-338- 010 (n = 6; 10.7%) and based 
on these reports of photosensitivity, guidance for sun protection was included in rucaparib 
clinical studies. Of 917 patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with rucaparib 600  mg 
BID in Studies CO -338- 014 (ARIEL3), CO -338- 010, and CO -338- 017 (ARIEL2), 
118 patients  (12.9%) experienced photosensitivity, of whom 2 patients (0.2%) experienced 
≥ Grade 3 photosensitivity as described in the rucaparib IB. Patients should use typi[INVESTIGATOR_466425], such as applying sunscreen ( sun protection factor  50 or greater)  
and/or covering exposed skin with clothing and wearing a hat and sunglasses.

The laboratory abnormalities were consistent with the TEAEs, with decreased hemoglobin, 
increased ALT, increased AST, and increased serum creatinine, most common ( Table 3 ). 
Decreased platelets, neutrophils, leukocytes, lymphocytes, and increased cholesterol were 
observed to a lesser extent ( Table 3).  
A decrease in hemoglobin ( National Cancer Institute [NCI] Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events [ CTCAE ] Grade 1 to 4) from  baseline was observed in 61% of patients 
(Grade 3, 13%). A decrease in lymphocytes, platelets, or neutrophils from baseline to a 
worsening CTCAE Grade occurred in 24%, 40%, and 35% of all patients, respectively). A shift 
to CTCAE Grade  3 or greater lymphocytes, platelets, or neutrophils  was observed in 5 %, 2%, 
and 6%, of all patients, respectively.  
Notable shifts from baseline were observed for creatinine, ALT, AST, and cholesterol 
concentrations in the majority of patients. An increase in ALT or AST from baseline to a

CTCAE Grade [ADDRESS_598121] was observed in 7% and 1% of all patients, 
respectively.  
Increases in ALT/AST are a known self -limiting effect of rucaparib treatment; therefore, 
management of these elevations was specified within the protocol.  Elevations in ALT/AST were 
generally not accompanied by a concomitant elevation in bilirubin  outside the normal range, and 
no cases met Hy’s Law criteria for drug -induced liver injury . Continued dosing with rucaparib in 
the presence of Grade 3 ALT/AST elevations is permitted if there are no other signs of liver 
toxicity.  
An increase in serum creatinine from baseline to a worsening CTCAE grade occurred in 43% of 
patients ( 0.3% Grad e 3) using an updated version of the CTCAE (ie, version 5) . In CTCAE 
version 4.03, any increase in creatinine above the baseline value is assessed as a Grade 1 toxicity 
(1 to 1.5 x baseline value) and almost all patients exhibit a shift from baseline creatinine. In 
CTCAE version 5, Grade  1 for increased creatinine is based on values greater than the upper 
limit of normal (ULN) . The elevations were observed early in treatment ( Day 15 of Cycle  1) and 
then stabilized with continued rucaparib treatment. Serum c reatinine levels decreased with 
interruption or discontinuation of rucaparib, and increase again with resumption of treatment.  
An increase in total cholesterol from baseline to a worsening CTCAE grade occurred in 41% of 
all patients ( 4% Grade ≥ 3).

Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are considered adverse 
events of special interest (AESI), as these events have been obs erved in patients exposed to 
cytotoxic chemotherapy (eg, platinum and anthracyclines) used for treatment of ovarian cancer as well as with PARP inhibitors, including rucaparib. Patients in rucaparib clinical studies 
diagnosed with MDS or AML had significant confounding risk factors including prior cytotoxic 
chemotherapy, and in some cases a deleterious BRCA mutation, which increases the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_50876](s). Based on these confounding factors, there is insufficient scientific 
evidence to conclude that MDS and AML are causally related to rucaparib. More information on AESIs of MDS/AML experienced by [CONTACT_466468].

Confidential Page  43 Adverse events (AEs) of pneumonitis have been reported with PARP inhibitor treatm ent, 
including in clinical trials evaluating rucaparib. Currently, however, there is a lack of 
understanding of a mechanistic link between pneumonitis and PARP inhibitor treatment, and 
causality assessment is often confounded by [CONTACT_171338] a consistent clinic al pattern as well as other 
pre-disposing factors, such as cancer and/or metastases in lungs, underlying pulmonary disease, 
smoking history, and/or previous chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Clovis Oncology is seeking to 
understand whether or not there is a relationship betw een pneumonitis  and rucaparib treatment; 
thus, Clovis Oncology is designating pneumonitis as an AESI  to gather data to enable a thorough 
evaluation and assessment of the event and associated  terms specified in Section  10.7. Also, refer 
to the rucaparib IB for information regarding the AESI of pneumonitis.

aggressive features and higher mortality rates; while less common in prostate cancer, germline 
mutations in BRCA1  are also associated with more aggressive disease.7 Deleterious germline 
mutations in other HR R genes, including ATM, checkpoint kinase 2 ( CHEK2 ), 
RAD51  homolog D ( RAD51D) and partner and localizer of BRCA2  (PALB2 ),[ADDRESS_598124] also been 
reported. In addition to germline mutations, somatic mutations in the HR R genes BRCA1, 
BRCA2 and ATM , and other much less frequent mutations in BRCA1 -interacting 
protein 1 ( BRIP1 ), CDK12, CHEK2, FANCA, nibrin  (NBN ), PALB2, RAD51B, and  RAD51C  
have been observed in advanced prostate cancer.8, 9 
Nonclinical evaluation has demonstrated sensitivity of BRCA1 and BRCA2 homozygous mutant cell lines to rucaparib and other PARP inhibitors (see Section 4.1 of the Investigator’s Brochure). 
In addition, sensitivity to PARP inhibition has also been observed in cells deficient or depleted in 
other components of HR R, including ATM .
31 This sensitivity is the result of synthetic lethality in 
homologous recombination deficient cells (like BRCA -mutant tumors) when exposed to a 
PARP i.  
Rucaparib, olaparib , niraparib, and talazoparib, similar agents in the growing class of PARP 
inhibitors in clinical development, have demonstrated clinical activity in several studies as a 
single agent for treatment of ovarian, prostate, and breast cancer associated with a BRCA  
mutation (germline or somatic), as well as in patients without a  BRCA  mutation.9, 32-[ADDRESS_598125] description of a B RCA mutant prostate cancer 
patient responding to PARPi [CONTACT_48831].
41 In a Phase 1 dose -escalation study of olaparib , three  
mCRPC patients were enrolled, of which one patient was a germline BRCA2 mutation carrier. 
This BRCA mutant mCRPC p atient had a > 50% reduction in his PSA level, resolution of bone 
metastases, and treatment duration >  1 year. The two  mCRPC patients without a germline BRCA 
mutation did not demonstrate a similar response.  
Rucaparib Clovis Oncology, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol : CO-338 -063 Amendment 4   18 February 2022 
Confidential Page  44 Sandhu et al. reported on a cohort of four patients with germline BRCA2 -mutant advanced 
prostate cancer treated with either olaparib  (three  patients) or niraparib  (one patient).42 In the 
patients treated with olaparib , PSA and radiographic responses lasting 34 and 26 months were 
noted in two  patients, and  stable disease ( SD) of [ADDRESS_598126] . The patient 
treated with niraparib  demonstrated primary resistance and quickly progressed; the total duration 
for niraparib treatment in that patient was 6  weeks.  
Olaparib was further evaluated in mCRPC in several Phase 2 studies. In one study that enrolled 
multiple tumor types, Kaufman e t al. (2014) reported efficacy data for eight BRCA mutant 
mCRPC patients who had received a median number of two  prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].43 All patients had 
experienced disease progression following hormonal  therapy; 75% had received prior docetaxel, 
and 50% had received prior platinum (carboplatin or cisplatin). Four patients had a confirmed PR 
(confirmed RECIST  Version 1.1  ORR = 50%) and two  patients (25%) had a best response of 
SD. Overall duration of response (DOR)  was [ADDRESS_598127]. In the Trial of 
PARP Inhibition in Prostate Cancer (TOPARP) study, which enrolled 50  mCRPC patients who 
received prior docetaxel (100%), abiraterone or enzalutamide (98%), and cabazitaxel  (58%), 
olaparib demonstrated an ORR of 33% in 49 evaluable patients. Response was defined as any of 
the following: response according to modified RECIST Version 1.1; at least 50% reduction in 
PSA level; or a confirmed reduction in the circulati ng tumor -cell count from 5 or more cells per 
7.5 mL of blood to less than 5 cells per 7.5 mL. The ORR in patients with a  mutation in a DNA 
repair gene (n = 16) was 88%, including 7/7 patients with a BRCA2 mutation and 4/5 patients 
with an ATM mutation . Med ian radiographic PFS ( rPFS ) and OS in patients classified as 
biomarker positive (with HR R gene mutation ) were 9.8 months and 13.8 months, respectively, 
compared to 2.7 months and 7.5  months for patient classified as biomarker negative (no HR R 
gene mutation ). 
To date, rucaparib has exhibited clinical activity and an acceptable safety profile when 
administered as monotherapy. Details of the rucaparib clinical studies and efficacy data are 
further described in Section  3.4.2  and Section  [IP_ADDRESS], as well an in the IB (Sections  5.1 and 5.3). 
Complete and partial responses, as defined by [CONTACT_466457] 1.[ADDRESS_598128] efficacy has been observed in ovarian cancer patients with a BRCA mutation (germline and somatic) ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) and in patients who have a BRCA -like 
tumor (ie, did not have a BRCA mutation, but had a high percentage of tumor genome loss of heterozygosity [LOH]), including patients with a deleterious mutations in RAD51C or RAD51D . 
Three mCRPC patients with a BRCA mutation received rucaparib monotherapy in Study CO-338- [ADDRESS_598129] of whom experienced tumor 
stabilization , decrease of PSA levels, and symptom improvement . Rucaparib monotherapy has a n 
established and manageable safety profile. Taken  together, nonclinical and clinical data with 
rucaparib and other PARP inhibitors provide a compelling evidence for use of rucaparib in a selected population of m CRPC patients wi th predicted loss -of-function mutations  in HRR genes 
such as BRCA1/2 and ATM .

5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, study of rucaparib versus physician’s choice of 
second -line AR-directed therapy (abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide) or docetaxel as treatment 
for mCRPC patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma who have progressed on one prior AR-directed therapy (abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, apalutamide, or 
investigational AR -targeted agent) and have not yet received chemotherapy in the 
castration -resistant setting. Progression is defined according to the Prostate Cancer Working 
Group Guidelines Version 3 ( PCWG3 ) criteria as a rise in PSA, new or progressive disease by 
[CONTACT_466469] 1.1 (Appendix 1 ), or two new lesions by [CONTACT_466470]. 
Patients who received prior PARPi [INVESTIGATOR_466426]. This study will e nroll mCRPC 
patients with a deleterious mutation in BRCA1/2 or ATM genes. Deleterious mutations are 
defined as protein- truncating mutations, large protein- truncating rearrangements, splice site 
mutations, deleterious missense mutations, and homozygous dele tions. Mutations may be 
detected by [CONTACT_26773], with the result documented in the patient’s medical record, or may be detected through central testing provided by [CONTACT_466471] -Screening . For local test 
results, the classification of the mutation as deleterious must be documented in the patient’s medical record. The primary endpoint is rPFS using modified RECIST V ersion  1.1/PCWG3 
criteria by [CONTACT_466472]  (IRR ; rPFSirr ). 
This study consists of  a Pre-Screening Phase ( Section  5.1.1 ), Screening Phase ( Section  5.1.2 ), 
Randomization ( Section  5.1.3 ), Treatment Phase (Section  5.1.4 ) and Post -Treatment Phase 
(Section  5.1.5 ). Patients will receive rucaparib monotherapy or physician’s choice of comparator 
therapy  (pre-designated prior to randomization)  in the Treatment Phase, and will undergo 
procedures and assessments including regular safety and efficacy evaluations during the entire 
conduct of the study. Patients randomized to the control arm  will have the opportunity to receive 
treatment with rucaparib in the Cross -over Phase of the study, after confirmation of radiographic 
progression (see Section  5.1.6 ).

is provided in  Figure 1.  
In the event that a deleterious BRCA1/[ADDRESS_598133] germline testing performed, this result will be entered in the clinical trial database for this 
study. 
During the Pre -Screening Phase, unless otherwise required by [CONTACT_427], serious adverse 
events ( SAEs ) which are related to protocol -mandated assessments will be reported.  
5.1.2  Screening Phase  
After providing consent to participate, patients with a deleterious BRCA 1/[ADDRESS_598134] dose of study drug. 
Patients will undergo procedures and assessments during the Screening Phase as described in  
Section  9.3.  
During the Screening Phase, unless otherwise required by [CONTACT_427], SAEs which are 
related to protocol -mandated assessments will be r eported.  
Additional scree ning assessments will include collection of the patient’s medical information and 
demographics, physical exam, laboratory safety assessments, tumor assessments, PRO instruments, and blood  and tissue  samples to support exploratory objectives as described in 
Section  9.3.  
Randomization will require prospective sponsor (or designee) review and confirmation of 
eligibility, including, but not limited to:  
• BRCA/ATM  gene test result by [CONTACT_466473]  
• details of prior therapy for prostate cancer  
• screening laboratory assessments  
 
5.1.3  Randomization  
Following confirmation of all eligibility criteria in the  Screening Phase, patients will be 
randomized 2:1 to receive rucaparib or physician’s choice  of docetaxel or AR -directed therapy 
(abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide, whichever the patient has not yet received ). The 
physician’ s choice of agent in the control arm must be prespecified prior to randomization. 
Randomization will occur by a central randomization procedure  using an Interactive Response 
System  (IXRS ), which is described in more detail in Section  7.4. Study treatment must be 
initiated within 3  days after randomization, unless approved by [CONTACT_170281] .

During the treatment phase, patients will r eceive rucaparib or physician’s choice (pre -designated 
prior to randomization) of docetaxel or AR -directed therapy (abiraterone acetate or 
enzalutamide)  and be monitored for safety and efficacy  as described in Section  9.5. 
Rucaparib will be administered as 600  mg orally BID. Abiraterone acetate will be administered 
as 1,000 mg orally QD , with prednisone administered concomitantly at a dose of 10 mg orally 
daily. Enzalutamide will be administered as 160  mg orally QD . Docetaxel will be administered at 
a dose of 75  mg/m2 IV every 3  weeks  in combination with prednisone or prednisolone, given 
orally, 5  mg BID, for up to a maximum of 10 cycles . 
Patients will receive the same  therapy , as appropriate,  throughout the Treatment Phase, or in the 
case of docetaxel up to a maximum of 10 cycles  wher eupon no additional study treatment shall 
be given, but all assessments will continue to be perfor med until criteria for treatment  
discontinuation are met. PRO assessments should also be collected at every visit .  
Tumor assessments by [CONTACT_20420] ( CT)/magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) and bone 
scans will be performed during the S creening  Phase , at the end of every 8 calendar weeks 
(±7 days) from Study Day  1 (Week 1) up to 24 weeks and every 12 calendar weeks (±  7 days) 
thereafter, and at the Treatment Discontinuation Visit, if applicable. Modified 
RECIST  Version  1.1 criteria will be used to document radiographic response in soft tissue 
(visceral and nodal) disease and PCWG3 criteria will be used to document radiographic progression in bone  lesions . If a CR or PR is noted, confirmatory scans should be performed at 
least [ADDRESS_598135] documented.  Radiographic tumor assessment 
(using the same methodology as was used at initial study screening [eg, CT scan and bone scan]) 
will continue until radiographic disease progression is confirmed, irrespective of whether the 
patient has discontinued study drug treatment or initiated subsequent anticancer therapy. Any  
drug modifications (interruption, dose reduction, or disco ntinuation) should be documented in 
the electronic case report form ( eCRF ) and source documents. If study treatment is interrupted, 
tumor assessments will not be delayed and will proceed on the regular study schedule. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_466427], at which time IRR will be discontinued and all radiographic scans will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_466474]. The sponsor will inform investigators

Patients will receive study drug until radiographic disease progression is confirmed by [CONTACT_466475], or by [CONTACT_466476], based on modified 
RECIST Version 1.1 and PCWG3 (for bone lesions only) criteria, unequivocal clinical disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or inability to tolerate further treatment, loss to follow -up, or 
withdrawal of consent. Patients in the docetaxel ar m will receive study drug for a maximum of 
[ADDRESS_598136] 12 weeks of therapy and is 
discouraged as a criterion to start a new systemic antineoplastic therapy throughout the study.

Patient safety will be monitored on a regular basis using procedures and assessments described in 
Section  9 and Section  13.4 . Safety and efficacy data will be periodically reviewed by [CONTACT_117123] (IDMC) as described in Section  13.[ADDRESS_598137] a Treatment Discontinuation Visit ( Section  9.6.1), a 28 -day Follow -up Visit ( Section  9.6.2 ), 
and then will proceed to long- term follow-up ( Section  9.6.3 ). An optional tumor biopsy will be 
collected prior to the start of subsequent anticancer therapy from patients who experience 
radiographic or unequivocal clinical disease progression and who provide appropriate consent. 
For patients who had their last tumor assessment ≥ 8 weeks  (≥ 12 weeks if previous scan was 
after 24  weeks on study) prior to the Treatment  Discontinuati on Visit, a tumor assessment must 
be performed.   
If study drug was discontinued for reasons other than centrally confirmed radiographic disease progression, tumor assessment s (using the same methodology as was used at initial study 
screening [eg, CT scan]) will continue until radiographic disease progression is confirmed by 
[CONTACT_466451]. Similarly, PRO will continue to be collected during this time and until radiographic disease 
progre ssion is confirmed by [CONTACT_466451].  Once the analysis of the primary endpoint has been performed, 
radiographic scans will continue to be performed by [CONTACT_093] , as well as collection of

5.1.6  Cross -over Phase  
Patients randomized to comparator therapy will be given the opportunity to cross  over to receive 
rucaparib therapy after radiographic progression is confirmed by [CONTACT_466477], or by [CONTACT_1697] a ssessment after analysis of the primary 
endpoint has been performed and IRR is discontinued. After providing consent, patients will be 
assessed to ensure  eligibility criteria are met for the Cross -over Phase (see protocol Section  6.4). 
If eligible, the patient will have protocol assessments for a Treatment Discontinuation Visit 
performed when treatment to which the patient is randomized has been completed or is 
discontinued and then will have protocol assessments per the rucaparib Treatment Phase. 
Radiographic assessments from the Cross -over Phase will not be submitted for IRR  either before 
or after the analysis of the primary endpoint has been performed . The patient will also have all  
Post-Treatment Phase assessments completed after discontinuing cross -over rucaparib , including 
a second Treatment Discontinuation Visit .

7.5 Preparation and Administration of Protocol-specified Treatment 
The investigator will be responsible for distributing study drug to all patients. Study drug 
(ie, rucaparib or comparator therapy) will be assigned by [CONTACT_466484]’s 
randomization assignment.  
The IXRS  will manage all study drug supplied by [CONTACT_456]. The system should be accessed to 
record each dispensation of rucaparib  and each administration of the comparator  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_466428]’s randomized treatment. Guidelines for the use of the IX RS will be 
provided to study sites. Study sites should follow local guidelines for the handling of comparator 
therapy . 
Rucaparib Clovis Oncology, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol : CO-[ADDRESS_598174] 8  oz (240  mL) of water. Tablets should be 
swallowed whole  without crushing or chewing. Tablet strength combinations shall be determined 
by [CONTACT_466485].  
Patients should take rucaparib doses as close to 12  hours apart as possible, pref erably at the same 
times every day. If a patient misses a dose ( ie, does not take it within 4  hours of the scheduled 
time), the patient should skip the missed dose and resume taking rucaparib with the next 
scheduled dose. Missed or vomited doses should not be made up.  
Dosing with rucaparib may be held or reduced as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  and 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] .  
Patients will b e provided a sufficient quantity  of study drug for 28 days  with a small overage . 
Patients will be instructed to bring their rucaparib tablets and all containers (empty, partially 
used, and/or unopened) to the next scheduled visit for reconciliation by [CONTACT_8786].  Partially 
used bottles  may be returned to the patient according to local guidelines .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rucaparib Dose Modification Criteria  
Treatment with rucaparib should be held if any of the following are observed and a dose 
reduction should be considered or implemented.  
• Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity  
• Grade 3 or 4 non- hematologic toxicity (except for alopecia, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea 
adequately controlled with systemic antiemetic/antidiarrheal medication administered  in 
standard doses according to the study center routines) . Grade 3 or Grade  4 ALT/AST 
elevations should be managed as described below. 
• At the discretion of the investigator, rucaparib may be held or continued if new or worsening 
unexplained pulmonary symptoms suggestive of pneumonitis (including, but not limited to, dyspnea) occur and while evaluation to rule out pneumonitis or confirm such a diagnosis as 
well as etiology are ongoing; these events should be managed as described below.  
• In addition, and at the discretion of the investigator, the dose of rucaparib may be held and/or reduced for Grade 2 toxicity not adequately controlled by [CONTACT_171348]/or 
supportive care.  
 
M
ANAGEMENT OF ANEMIA INCLUDING EVALUATION FOR MDS/AML  AND FOLLOW -UP OF 
PATIENTS WHO DISCONTINUE TREATMENT WITH ONGOING ANEMIA  
• If the patient d evelops anemia CTCAE Grade ≥ 3, rucaparib  treatment should be held until 
the anemia resolves to CTCAE Grade ≤ 2 whereupon daily dosing may then be resumed at 
either the same dose or a lower dose, per investigator discretion.  
• If a patient has persistent CTCAE Grade  3 anemia despi[INVESTIGATOR_466429], and the 
anemia is considered related to the patient’s underlying prostate cancer (eg, patient has 
Rucaparib Clovis Oncology, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol : CO-338 -063 Amendment 4  18 February 2022 
Confidential Page  62 extensive bony disease or history of disease -related anemia), then resumption of study drug 
may be considered, if the patient was benefiting from treatment in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_144086]  
• If the duration of dosing is interrupted for >  14 consecutive days due to anemia CTCAE 
Grade ≥ 3, treatment should be permanently discontinued, unless otherwise agreed between 
the investigator and the sponsor.  
• In addition, if anemia  CTCAE Grade ≥ 3 persists for >  14 consecutive days, or a dependence 
upon blood transfusion occurs, then weekly complete blood counts should be performed until 
resolution of the event.  
• If, after 42 days of interruption of rucaparib, the anemia has not recovered to CTCAE Grade ≤ [ADDRESS_598175] hematologic 
practice.  
- The bone marrow analysis should include a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] (for cellular 
morphology, cytogenetic analysis, and flow cytometry) and a core biopsy (for bone 
marrow cellularity).  
 
M
ANAGEMENT OF RUCAPARIB TREATMENT -EMERGENT ALT/AST  ELEVATIONS  
• Grade 4 ALT/AST elevations: hold rucaparib until values have returned to Grade 2 or better, 
then resume rucaparib with a dose reduction. Monitor liver function tests weekly for 3 weeks 
after ru caparib has been restarted.  
• Grade 3 ALT/AST elevations, in the absence of other signs of liver dysfunction,  should be 
managed as follows:  
- Monitor liver function tests weekly until resolution to ≤  Grade  2. 
- Continuation of rucaparib with elevation of ALT/AST up to Grade  3 is permitted 
provided bilirubin is <  ULN.  
- If patient has Grade 3 ALT/AST and continues on rucaparib, and levels do not decline 
within 2 weeks or they continue to rise, treatment interruption and resolution to ≤  Grade 2 
will be required before rucaparib can be resumed, either at the current dose or at a 
reduced dose.  
 For patients who meet treatment interruption guidelines above, treatment with rucaparib should 
be held until the toxicity resolves to ≤  CTCAE Grade  2. Dosing BID may then be resumed at 
either the same dose or a lower dose, per investigator discretion. If treatment is resumed at the same dose, and the patient experiences the same toxicity, treatment should be interrupted, then 
resumed at a reduced dose following resolution of the event to ≤  CTCAE Grade 2. If the patient 
continues to experience toxicity, additional dose reduction steps are permitted; however, the investigator must consult with the sponsor’s medical monitor before reducing to 300 mg BID. If 
a patient continues to experience toxicity despi[INVESTIGATOR_466430] 300 mg BID, or if 
dosing with rucaparib is interrupted for >  14 consecutive days due to toxicity, treatment should 
be discontinued, unless otherwise agreed between the investigator and the sponsor.

Confidential Page  63 Drug -induced liver injury (DILI) is described in the US FDA Guidance for Industry, 
Drug -Induced Liver Injury: Premarketing Clinical Evaluation,46 and should be referenced when 
managing treatment -emergent ALT/AST elevations . 
Rucaparib treatment must be interrupted if biochemical criteria for suspected DILI are met, 
according to presence of the following laboratory abnormalities:  
ALT or AST >  3 × ULN   
and  
Bilirubin >  2 × ULN  
While t reatment  is interrupted, the patient should be evaluated for the presence of confounding 
factors including malignant disease in the liver, coadministration of other suspect drugs, 
cholestasis, and viral or autoimmune hepatitis that could have caused the laboratory 
abnormalities. Other labor atory investigations of liver function such as international normalized 
ratio ( INR) should be implemented as indicated. If no alternative cause is identified, rucaparib 
must be permanently discontinued.  
All cases of possible DILI  must be reported as SAEs (see Section  10.9) and  will be followed 
until all abnormalities have returned to normal or to baseline levels , or an alternative cause is 
found to explain the combination of the increased transaminases and bili rubin. 
MANAGEMENT OF NEW OR WORSENING PULMONARY SYMPTOMS  
If new or worsening unexplained pulmonary symptoms suggestive of pneumonitis (including, 
but not limited to, dyspnea) occur, or a deterioration of pulmonary function is observed, and/or 
radiologic abnormality is detected in the lungs, and this occurs in the absence of any clear 
diagnosis, a diagnostic workup (including high resolution CT scan) in consultation with a 
pulmonologist should be performed in order to rule out pneumonitis. During this time, treatment 
with rucaparib  may be interrupted or continued per investigator discretion.  
Following investigation, if pneumonitis is not confirmed, treatment with rucaparib may be 
resumed/continued as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_466486]. All confirmed events of pneumonitis should be 
treated as appropriate per medical judgement and institutional guidelines. If the event resolves 
and retreatment with rucaparib is being considered, pleas e consult the Sponsor’s Medical 
Monitor. Retreatment with rucaparib may be resumed at the current or a reduced dose, if 
appropriate.  
Refer to Sections 10.3 and 10.7 of the protocol for additional information regarding classification 
and reporting of pneumonitis ( and associated  events ) as an AESI.

protection factor  50 or greater) and/or covering exposed skin with clothing and wearing a hat and 
sunglasses.  
7.5.[ADDRESS_598176] toxicity observed per the recommendations and guidelines provided in the approved 
Prescribing Information provided in the Pharmacy Guidelines or according to ins titutional 
guidelines or local dose reduction protocols. Dose modifications (interruption, reduction, 
re-escalatio n) must be recorded for each patient in the appropriate section of the eCRF .  
Rucaparib Clovis Oncology, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol : CO-[ADDRESS_598177] the option to cross -over to rucaparib 
treatment upon radiographic disease progression, following sponsor (or designee)  approval of the 
radiology report confirming disease progression by [CONTACT_466451], and meeting el igibility for the 
cross- over as listed in Section  6.4. 
Once the analysis of the primary endpoint has been performed, radiographic scans will continue 
to be performed  by [CONTACT_466487]; scans will no longer be 
submitted to or read by [CONTACT_466451] . After analysis of the primary endpoint, i nvestigator- assessed 
radiographic disease progression will be used for cross -over eligibility  evaluation . Patients may 
cross- over to rucaparib treatment upon radiographic disease progression, following sponsor (or 
designee) approval of the radiology report confirming disease progression by [CONTACT_093], 
and provided the patient meets eligibility criteria for cross -over as listed in Section  6.4.  
Patients who cross -over to receive rucaparib will continue to have all protocol -required 
assessments as described in Section  9. Cross -over to rucaparib can occur only after toxicities 
related to the comparator  have resolved or sufficiently stabilized and the patient meets all criteria 
for initiation of treatment with rucaparib. Initiation of treatment with rucaparib should normally 
occur within 28-days following the scan date resulting in  confirmed radiographic disease 
progression. Deviations from this timeline must be confirmed with the Sponsor. 
7.5.7  Continuation of  Study Drug beyond Disease Progression  
If a patient  (either per initial randomization or after  cross-over) has met the criteria for 
radiographic disease progression, but conti nues to derive clinical  benefit per  investigator 
assessment , then continuation of treatment is permitted  with additional consent. Clinical 
scenarios where continuation of study drug treatment after radiographic progression may be 
considered include a patient in whom radiographic progression develops slowly while 
disease -related symptoms remain well controlled, a patient who experiences progression in a site 
of disease that is unlikely to adversely affect prognosis (eg, enlargement of a solitary lymph 
node), or a patient with general disease control but limited progression in sites of disease that can 
be managed with local therapi[INVESTIGATOR_171293].  In such cases, the decision to 
continue must be documented in the medical notes prior to continuing treatment. Patients continuing to receive study drug will need to provide additional consent and will continue to 
have all protocol -required  assessments as described in  Section  9, with the exception of 
radiographic assessments which may be performed per local standard of care. 
7.6 Treatment Compliance 
7.6.1  Rucaparib Treatment Compliance  
Study site personnel will review  dosing information with the patient (or legally authorized 
representative) on scheduled clinic visit days, providing instructions regarding dose, dose 
frequency and the number of tablets to be taken for each dose. Patients (or legally authorized 
represent ative) will be instructed to keep all unused containers (empty, partially used, and/or

Confidential Page  66 unopened) for accountability at the next  scheduled clinic visits. A compliance check and tablet 
count will be performed by [CONTACT_466488]. Study site personnel will record 
compliance information i n the eCRF . 
Every effort should be made to ensure patients return to the clinic with their study drug 
containers /unused study drug at each study drug dispensation visit. Study site personnel should 
conduct a verbal review of dosing with the patient and document the discussion in the patient’s medical record . This may serve as source documentation for the purpose of entering dosing data 
in the appropriate eCRF . 
7.6.2  Comparator T herapy  Treatment Compliance  
Com parator therapy will be managed by [CONTACT_466489] .  
For abiraterone and enzalutamide, s tudy site personnel will review dosing information with the 
patient (or legally authorized representative) on scheduled clinic visit days, providing 
instructions regarding dose, dose frequency and the number of tablets /capsules  to be taken for 
each dose. Patients (or legally authorized representative) will be instructed to keep all unused containers (empty, partially used, and/or unopened) for accountability for any product provided 
by [CONTACT_466490]. A compliance check and tablet/capsule count 
will be performed by [CONTACT_466488]. Study site personnel will record 
compliance information i n the eCRF . 
Every effort should be made to ensure patients return to the clinic with their  study drug 
containers/unused study drug a t each study drug dispensation visit. Study site personnel should 
conduct a verbal review of dosing with the patient and document the discussion in the patient’s 
medical record. This may serve as source documentati on for the purpose of entering dosing data 
in the appropriate eCRF . 
For docetaxel, s ite personnel should record  dosing data ( changes, interruptions, etc. ) in the 
source records and i n the appropriate eCR F.  
7.7 Accountability of Protocol-specified Treatment 
Study personnel will maintain accurate records of study drug receipt, dispensation, use, return, destruction, and reconciliation for study drugs provided by [CONTACT_456] . The IXRS will be used 
to manage study drug inventory at all sites. In order to function properl y, the system will require 
real-time entry of study drug receipt, dispensation, destruction, etc. by [CONTACT_466491]. 
The site is responsible for the return or destruction of study drug supplied by [CONTACT_466492]. Authorization to destroy study drug at the site that has not been dispensed to a patient 
(eg, expi[INVESTIGATOR_143187]) , must be requested from the s ponsor prior to destruction. Any study drug 
supplied by [CONTACT_466493]. All study 
drug containers must be accounted for prior to their destruction at the study center, according to 
institutional procedures for disposal of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs. Unused study drug

treatment with chemotherapy (eg docetaxel, mitox antrone, cyclophosphamide,  platinum- based 
agents) for mCRPC  are not eligible to participate in this study. Prior treatment with docetaxel (or 
other taxane chemotherapy) admi nistered for castration -sensitive disease is permitted.  
All procedures performed (eg, thoracentesis, etc.) during the study must be documented i n the 
eCRF . 
8.1 Supportive Care 
During the study, supportive care (eg, antiemetics; analgesics for pain control) may be used at 
the investigator’s discretion and in accordance with institutional procedures.  Supportive care 
must be recorded for each patient in the appropriate section of the eCRF.  
Continuation of l ow-dose corticosteroid therapy that has been stable prior to study entry is 
permitted  (see Section 6.3). A low dose is considered 5-15 mg/day of prednisone or 
prednisolone, and 0.5-3 mg/day of dexamethasone. For corticosteroid s admini stered  in 
combination with comparator  therapy during the study, see S ection 7.1.2 .  
Erythropoietin, darbepoetin alfa, and/or hematopoietic colony- stimulating factors for treatment 
of cytopenias should be administered according to institutional guidelines. Transfusion 
thres holds for blood product support will be in accordance with institutional guidelines.  
8.2 Radiotherapy 
Palliative radiotherapy for the treatment of painful bony metastasis is permitted during the study.  
Treatment with rucaparib  should be held prior to initiation of radiation therapy and until the 
patient has recovered from any radiation related toxicity.  Radiotherapy to soft -tissue lesions 
(either target or non- target) renders these inevaluable by [CONTACT_466457]  1.1, and is therefore 
discouraged during the Treatment Phase of the study.

Clinical Study Protocol : CO-338 -063 Amendment 4  18 February 2022 
Confidential Page  68 8.4 Anticancer or Experimental Therapy 
No other anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including chemotherapy, radiation [except for palliative 
radiotherapy to bone metastases ], antibody therapy, immunotherapy, gene therapy, angiogenesis 
inhibitors, or other experimental drugs ) of any kind will be permitted while the patient is taking 
study treatment in the study ( ie, unless in follow -up). Prior treatment with anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_466431]  [ADDRESS_598180] dose of study drug.  Prior treatment 
with hormonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (with the exception of LHRH analog) must be discontinued at least 
[ADDRESS_598181] dose of study drug.  
8.5 CYP450 Isoenzyme Inhibitors, Inducers, and Substrates 
Based on  the results from the  CYP interaction clinical study CO-338-044, rucaparib is a 
moderate inhibitor of CYP1A2, and a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A. 
Caution should be used in patients  on rucaparib  taking concomitant medicines that are sensitive 
substrates of CYP1A2,  CYP2C9, and/or CYP3A ( Appendix 4). Patients taking phenytoin, a 
CYP2C9 substrate with a narrow therapeutic window,  should have therapeutic drug level 
monitored while using concomitantly with rucaparib.  
Although in vitro rucaparib metabolism mediated by [CONTACT_097]3A4 was slow, a significant contribution of CYP3A4 in vivo cannot be excluded. Caution should be used for concomitant use 
of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers.  
8.[ADDRESS_598182] initiated denosumab or bisphosphonate therapy or adjusted bisphosphonate 
or demosumab dose/regimen within [ADDRESS_598183] dose of study drug. Patients on a stable 
denosumab or bisphosphonate regimen are eligible and may continue treatment. Initiation of 
bisphosphonates or other approved bone targeting agents if clinically indicated is allowed, and 
should not result in study treatment discontinuation unless patient has r adiographic evidence of 
disease progression. 
8.7 Anticoagulants 
Rucaparib is a weak inhibitor of CYP 2C9 in vivo . Caution should be exercised in patients 
receiving rucaparib and concomitant warfarin (Coumadin) . Patients taking warfarin should have 
INR monitored regularly per standard institut ional practice.  
8.8 Other Concomitant Medications 
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_171295]’s well -being may be given at the discretion of the 
investigator and should be documente d in the eCRF. O ther concomitant medications, except for 
analgesics, chronic treatments for concomitant medical conditions, or agents required for 
life-threatening medical problems, should be avoided. H erbal and complementary therapi[INVESTIGATOR_466432], but any taken by [CONTACT_466494] i n the eCRF .

Confidential Page  69 Rucaparib marginally increased digoxin AUC by 20%. Caution should be exercised for patients 
receiving rucaparib and requiring concomitant medication with digoxin. Patients taking digoxi n 
should have their digoxin levels monitored after starting rucaparib and then regularly per 
standard clinical practice.  
In vitro, r ucaparib is a potent inhibitor of MATE 1 and MATE2- K, a moderate inhibitor of 
OCT1, and a weak inhibitor of OCT2. As inhibition of these transporters  could de crease renal 
elimination and liver uptake of metformin, caution is advised  when metformin is co -administered 
with rucaparib.

c Pre-Screening is for central testing of plasma ctDNA and tumor tissue samples to identify patients with qualifying  deleterious  BRCA1/[ADDRESS_598189] evidence of radiographic or biochemical disease progression, and be eligible for this study a s their immediate next therapy . Both 
plasma ctDNA and tumor tissue samples should be submitted simultaneously. If plasma or tis sue testing results in failure, additional samples may be submitted, as 
available. Pre-Screening requires a separate informed consent form.  
d Tissue for Pre -Screening should be from biopsy or resection specimen from metastatic tumor, if there is a lesion suitable for biopsy. A biopsy or resection of a visceral or 
nodal site of metastasis is preferred; however a biopsy of primary tumor or of a site of bony metastasis is also acceptable (soft tissue biopsy preferred over bone site 
biopsy). If a metast atic biopsy is not feasible, archival tissue samples can be submitted. Archival tissue for Pre -Screening should be <  3 years old. Submission of a tumor

Patients are required to sign the Pre- Screening ICF prior to undergoing any Pre -Screening 
activities (ie, deleterious  BRCA1/2 or ATM gene mutation testing), and are required to sign the 
Screening ICF prior to undergoing any other Screening assessments. Obtaining written informed 
consent does not signify the start of the Screening Phase as it begins when the first study-specific 
screening activity is performed. 
The investigator or their designee shall discuss with each patient the nature of the study and its  
requirements. The information on the IRB/ IEC approved consent form should be translated and 
communicated in the language the patient (or legally authorized representative)  can understand.  
Additionally, patients undergoing tumor tissue biopsy during Pre -Screening at the time of 
radiographic disease progression/randomized treatment discontinuation must provide additional 
consent for this procedure.  
Patients who cross -over to treatment with rucaparib after  confirmed radiographic disease 
progression must provide additional consent to continue treatment, as well as sponsor  (or 
designee)  approval of the radiology report confirming disease progression a nd eligibility . Details 
regarding cross -over to rucaparib are described in Section  9.7. 
Patients  with radiographic disease progression who are still receiving benefit and are allowed to 
continue study drug must also provide consent for continued treatment .

During Pre -Screening:  
• Submit patient plasma  sample for ctDNA analysis and tissue samples simultaneously  
• Tissue should be from a newly obtained metastatic biopsy, if there is a lesion suitable for 
biopsy. A biopsy or resection of a visceral or nodal site of metastasis is preferred ; however, a 
biopsy of primary tumor or of a site of bony metastasis is also acceptable.  
• If a metastatic biopsy is not feasible, ar chival tissue samples can be submitted. Archival 
tissue should be < [ADDRESS_598216] recently collected tumor tissue sample available that

Patients are to  be randomized to receive either rucaparib or the physician's choice of c omparator 
therapy  (Section  5.1.3 ) through IXRS after meeting eligibility criteria ( Sections  6.2 and 6.3) and 
having completed screening assessments ( Section  9.3).   
The first dose of study drug must be administered ≤ [ADDRESS_598218] dose is Study Day 1.  
During the treatment period, patients randomized to rucaparib will receive oral rucaparib tablets 
which should be taken BID at 600 mg/dose with 8 oz (240 mL) of water with or without food. At  
each study visit, the first dose of rucaparib will be taken in the clinic, with the remaining  doses 
self-administered by [CONTACT_44126]. Patients should take rucaparib at about the same time 
every day  and should inform the clinic staff of any changes to their dose and timing of 
self-administration of oral rucaparib.  
The choice of comparator therapy is at the discretion of the investigator from the regimens described in this protocol  and must be specified prior to randomization. Refer to

endpoint has been performed, radiographic scans will continue to be performed by [CONTACT_466495], including to assess for consideration to continue treatment ; scans  
will no longer be submitted to or read by [CONTACT_466451]. The sponsor will inform investigators when 
submission of scans for IRR should discontinue. These patients  will continue cycles of study 
drug as described starting in Section s [IP_ADDRESS]  and [IP_ADDRESS] , and a Treatment Discontinuation V isit 
as described below will occur at the end of all study  treatment . In such cases, the patient must 
consent prior to continuing treatment with study drug.  
Patients who continue treatment on study drug after radiographic disease progression will have 
the option of tumor tissue biopsy collection at time of first disease pro gression on study (requires 
additional consent).  Tumor tissue will be processed locally as  formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded  
(FFPE ) tissue. Refer to the Pathology Charter for detailed sample handling instructions.  Patients  
on comparator arms  may be evaluated for eligibility to cross -over to treatment  as described in 
Sections  6.4 and 9.8.

Patients who cross- over to rucaparib treatment will follow the procedures beginning in 
Section  9.7. These patients  will have appropriate follow -up visits after discontinuation of 
cross- over rucaparib treatment.  
Patients in long -term follow -up will undergo the following assessments:  
•If applicable, tumor assessment (using the same methodology as was used at initial studyscreening [eg, CT and bone scan]) when the reason for treatment discontinuation was other
than death or disease progression based on radiographic assessment and it has been
≥ 8 weeks (≥ 12 weeks if previous scan was after 24  weeks on study) since last scan or
disease progression was noted on the last scan. Tumor assessment should continue to be
performed at the end of every 8  calendar weeks (±7  days) relative to Study Day  1 (Week  1)
up to 24 weeks, then every 12 calendar weeks (±7 days), until confirmed radiographic
disease progression by [CONTACT_466500]  1.1 and/or PCWG3 (for bone lesions only)

9.7 Informed Consent for Patients Who Cross-over to Rucaparib after 
Disease Progression on Comparator Treatment 
Patients who initially received comparator treatment  and then cross -over to treatment with 
rucaparib after  radiographic disease progression is confirmed by [CONTACT_466451]  (after the analysis of the 
primary endpoint is performed, this will change to investigator -assessed radiographic 
progression, as IRR will be discontinued) must provide additional consent to receive rucaparib 
treatment, as well as spo nsor (or designee) approval. Patients  who are  eligible  to cross -over as 
described in Section  6.[ADDRESS_598223] dose of rucaparib within 
28-days following the scan date resulting in confirmation of radiographic progression.  Ineligible 
patients will continue with  a 28-day S afety Follow-up V isit and long- term follow -up as in 
Sectio ns 9.6.2  and 9.6.3 . 
Additionally, patients participating in the optional tumor tissue biopsy at the time of radiographic 
disease progression/ treatment discontinuation  after cross -over to rucaparib must provide 
additional consent for this procedure.  
9.8 Screening Prior to Cross-over to Rucaparib 
Following written informed consent, and unless otherwise specified, the screening assessments 
equivalent to 28 days before study start through 14 days before study start ( Section  9.4.1 ) will be 
performed prior to initiating treatment with rucaparib  within the allowable windows of time as 
indicated . Assessments performed within the specified windows, but prior to patient signing 
infor med consent, are acceptable only if confirmed to have been standard of care.  Assessments 
performed at treatment discontinuation and/or at the 28-day S afety Follow-up Visit following 
discontinuation of comparator therapy may be utilized , provided they were within the allowable  
windows of time as indicated.  
Screening procedures may be repeated if the findings/results are considered invalid or not representative of the patient ’s baseline medical status. When screening procedures are repeated, 
the rationale should be documented in the source file.  
9.8.1  Ongoing Assessments for Cross- over Patients:  
Patients will continue with all assessments required from and incl uding XO-Study Day [ADDRESS_598224] dose of rucaparib through to 28- day follow -up after s tudy drug is stopped per schedule of 
assessments, as described in Section s [IP_ADDRESS]  to [IP_ADDRESS]  and Sections  9.6.1  and 9.6.2  of this

9.9 Methods of Data Collection 
9.9.1  Medical History and Demographic/  Baseline Characteristics  
Basic demographic and baseline characteristics will be collected during screening. In addition to 
the evaluation of a patient’s medical history in terms of study eligibility, all relevant medical 
conditions will be documented in the appropriate eCRF. Events that occur after signing of 
informed consent but prior to initiation of study drug, unless an SAE  and due to a 
protocol- mandated procedure, should be recorded in  the Medical History eCRF.  
The patient’s entire oncology history will be collected i n the appropriate eCRF including date of 
diagnosis for mCRPC (and other malignancy, if applicable), prior surgeries/  treatments received 
for cancer, dates of treatment administration, best response achieved, date of progression and 
how assessed , and BRCA 1/BRCA 2/ATM/other HR R gene mutation status (if known) .

9.11.1  Disease/  Tumor Assessments  
Radiographic tumor assessments including CT scans of the chest, abdomen & pelvis (and other 
anatomical regions as indicated) that are contrast -enhanced and have ≤  5 mm slice thickness, as 
well as skeletal scintigraphy (whole body) using 99m Tc-MDP or HDP . MRI or non- contrast CT 
may be utilized for patients intolerant to contrast. Where indicated for neurological symptoms, 
MRI of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_466434]. Other studies, such as PET, may also be 
performed. If a site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET/CT is of identical 
diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast) then the CT portion of the PET/CT can be used for RECIST  Version 1.[ADDRESS_598226]/MRI  
and bone scans will be performed during screening, every 8 calendar weeks (±  7 days) from 
Study Day 1 up to 24 weeks and then every 12 calendar weeks (±  7 days) thereafter . If study 
drug was discontinued for reasons other than radiographic disease progression confirmed by 
[CONTACT_466451], tumor assessments (using the same methodology as was used at initial study screening [eg, 
CT scan]) will continue until radiographic  disease progression is confirmed by [CONTACT_466451].  Once the

assessments will be reported.  Once enrolled  to study drug, p atients will be monitored for all 
AEs/SAEs/ AESIs  during study participation and until [ADDRESS_598232] dose of study drug. 
Any ongoing SAEs, AESIs, or  treatment -related Grade 3/4 AEs will be followed until resolution 
or stabilization. After the 28 -day window, only SAEs assessed as potentially related to study 
drug should be reported per Clovis Oncology PV requirements and captured in the Clovis  
Oncology PV database.  
After the 28 -day Follow -up Visit, AESIs of MDS and AML, irrespective of causality, should 
be reported  per Clovis Oncology PV requirements and captured in the Clovis Oncology PV 
database.  
• AESIs of pneumonitis or similar  events (ie,  interstitial lung disease, pulmonary fibrosis, 
acute interstitial pneumonitis, alveolitis necrotizing, alveolitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, 
and organizing pneumonia) should be reported up to, but not beyond, the 28- Day Follow -up 
Visit ([ADDRESS_598233] dose of rucaparib). After the 28 -day Follow -up Visit, only 
pneumonitis or similar events meeting the criteria for an SAE and assessed as potentially related to study drug should be reported per Clovis Oncology PV requirements . 
 AEs and laboratory abnormalities will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE grading system (Version  4.03 or higher) and recorded in the eCRF.  
Complete details for monitoring AEs  (inclusive of SAEs and AESIs), including the definition of 
drug- related AEs, are provid ed in Section  10. 
9.12.2  Clinical Laboratory Investigations  
Samples for hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis will be analyzed by a local laboratory. 
The panels of laboratory tests to be performed are shown below:  
Hematology: red blood cells (RBC) and parameters (hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular 
volume [MCV], mean corpuscular hemoglobin [MCH], and mean corpuscular hemoglobin 
concentration [MCHC]) and reticulocyte count, white blood cells (WBC) and differential (with 
ANC), and platelet count will be assessed at screening, during treatment at study visits , and at 
the Treatment Discontinuation and 28- day Foll ow-up V isits (inc luding those for cross -over) for 
all patients. Hematology results must be reviewed by [CONTACT_466508] . Additional and more frequent 
tests may be performed at the investigator’s discretion.  
Serum Chemistry:  total protein, albumin, creatinine f or estimating GFR using the 
Cockcroft- Gault formula  (Appendix 3) , BUN or urea, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP), ALT, AST, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH ), glucose, sodium, potassium, chloride, CO

discretion. 
Urinalysis: performed locally on a freshly voided clean sample by [CONTACT_124764], glucose, 
blood, pH, and ketones. If dipstick findings are abnormal based on the investigator’s judgment, 
then a microscopic evaluation will be performed to assess the abnormal findings. Urinalysis will 
be performe d at screening, during treatment at study visit s, and at the Treatment Discontinuation 
and 28- day Follow -up Visits (including those for cross -over) for all patients, but may be 
conducted at other times as clinically indicated.  
Laboratory reports will be reviewed by [CONTACT_466510] -of-range parameters and assess clinical significance. Clinically significant 
abnormalities and associated panel results  will be documented in the eCRF as an AE ; any results 
of unscheduled tests will also be recorded in the e CRF . Refer to Section  10.[ADDRESS_598234] 5  minutes during screening, at study visits during the 
Treatment Phase, and at the Treatment Disco ntinuation and 28- day Follow -up Visits (including 
those for cross -over). 
9.12.4  12-lead Electrocardiogram  
For all patients, 12- lead ECGs will be performed at the following times:  
• Screening (within 28 days prior to randomization)  
• Treatment Discontinuation Visit  
 
The following will be measured or calculated: heart rate, pulse rate, QRS, QT, QTc, and rhythm. 
The investigator  or qualified designee  will review the ECGs locally and assess the results as 
normal or abnormal (clinically significant or not clinically significant).  
If it is clinically indicated, ECGs can be performed at other times during the study.  
9.12.5  Physical Examinations, Body Weight and Height  
Physical examinations will include an assessment of all the major body systems. Complete 
physical examinations will be performed during screening and at the T reatment Discontinuation 
Visit. Physical examinations at study visits during the Treatment  Phase and 28-day Fol low-up 
Visit (including cross -over) will be limited as appropriate.  
Height will be measured during the screening visit only. Weight will be measured per institutional guidelines during screening, at study visit s prior to therapy administration, and at the 
Treatment Discontinuation and 28-day Follow -up V isits (including those for cross -over).

ECOG performance status ( Appendix 2) will be assessed during screening, at study visits during 
the Treatment Phase, and at the Treatment Discontinuation and 28-day Follow -up V isits 
(including cross -over) . The ECOG performance status should be assessed by [CONTACT_466511], if possible. For eligibility purposes, patients with borderline ECOG 
performance status should be considered carefully to avoid enrolling patients who may have 
significant impairment.  
9.13 Biomarker Analysis – FFPE Tumor Tissue 
An optional tumor biopsy obtained between the time of disease progression/ randomized 
treatment discontinuation and the start of the next treatment will be obtained from consenting 
patients.  The molecular profile of the progression biopsy will be compared with that from 
matched pretreatment primary or metastatic tumor tissue to identify mechanisms of resistance to rucaparib . Patients must provide additional consent for the optional tumor tissue biopsy sample. 
New lesions or lesions that are growing should be prioritized for the optional biopsy. I f possible, 
collect the lesion responsible for progression.  Detailed sample handling instructions are located 
in the Pathology Charter.   
9.14 Biomarker Analysis – ctDNA/genomic DNA from Blood 
Blood samples will be collected during Pre -Screening  (for deleterious BRCA 1/2 or  ATM  gene 
mutation assessment) , Screening, before dosing on Study Day 1 and at treatment discontinuation 
from all patients entered in the study for plasma ctDNA  analysis.  
Blood will be collected for  pharmacogenomics analyses  on Study Day 1 from  all patients ; this 
sample is not collected on Cross -over Study Day 1. Genomi c DNA will be extracted from the 
cellular portion of th is blood sample and may be analyzed to de termine whether th e deleterious 
BRCA 1, BRCA2 or ATM  gene mutation identified is germline or somatic prior to final data 
analysis. Because the germline analysis will be done near the end of the study, there are no plans 
to share these results with the inves tigator. However, if an actionable mutation , as defined by [CONTACT_466512]  
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/acmg/), is revealed that was not detected in tumor or 
plasma , these incidental findings will be made  available to the investigator provided the results 
are generated from a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA )-certified 
laboratory. Sample collection details will be provided in a Laboratory Manual.  
9.15 Pharmacokinetics Evaluation 
For patients  receiving rucaparib  (except those in the Cross- over Phase ), plasma  samples are to be 
collected for trough level PK analysis of  rucaparib before the morning dose  on Study Day 29, 
Day 57, Day 85, and Day  113 as close to 12  hours after the previous dose as possible.  If the start 
of the next dose is delayed, the PK sample should still be collected during this  visit instead of on 
the delayed start of the next dose . Samples are not to be collected in patients receiving 
comparator therapy or crossing ove r to rucaparib.  Refer to the Laboratory Manual for sample 
collection details  for PK samples .

Questionnaires)  
Patient -reported outcomes utilizing the BPI -SF (Appendix 5) , FACT -P (Appendix 6) , EQ-5D-5L 
(Appendix 7) , and analgesic drug score ( Appendix 8) instruments  will be assessed during 
screening, at study treatment visits during the Treatment Phase, the Treatment Discontinuation 
Visit, and at the 28-day S afety Follow-up V isit. The analgesic drug score will be recorded 
according to the World Health Organization's ( WHO’s ) analgesic ladder: [ADDRESS_598235] complete the instruments before any other scheduled study procedures are performed and 
dosing occurs (if applicable).  
PRO assessments should be collected at every study visit  for all patients thro ugh disease

therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or 
not related to the investigational medicinal product. This in cludes an exacerbation of pre -existing 
conditions or events, intercurrent illnesses, or drug interaction that is not recorded elsewhere in 
the eCRF  under specific efficacy assessments. Anticipated fluctuations of pre-existing 
conditions, including the disease under study, that do not represent a clinically significant 
exacerbation or worsening are not considered AEs.   
It is the responsibility of the investigator to monitor all AEs that occur during the study. AEs 
should be elicited by [CONTACT_99020]  a non- leading question (eg, “Have you experienced any 
new or changed symptoms since we last asked/since your last visit?”). The existence of an AE 
may be concluded from a spontaneous report of the patient; from the physical examination; or 
from special te sts such as the ECG, laboratory assessments, or other study- specified procedure 
(source of AE). Symptoms reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_466513] (and hence documented i n the AE eCRF, not i n the

prolongat ion of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/  incapacity  
• Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Important medical events  that may not result in death, are not life -threatening, or do not 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

AESIs (serious or nonserious) are defined as AEs of scientific and medical concern specific to 
the sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by 
[CONTACT_35348]. Such an event might warrant further 
investigation in order to characterize and understand it. Depending on the nature of the event, rapid communication by [CONTACT_171359] (eg, regulators) might also be 
warranted.  
Details on the sponsor’s currently agreed list of AESIs for rucaparib can be found in the current 
rucaparib IB. These AESIs are to  be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of knowledge of the 
event  (see Section  10.7  for reporting instructions) .  
10.4 Events or Outcomes Not Qualifying as Serious Adverse Events 
The following are not considered SAEs for the purposes  of this protocol, and therefore do not 
need to be reported as such:  
• Preplanned or elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_171298]/  or convenience situations 
(eg, respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594])  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_171299] 24  hours duration  (eg, patient presents to the emergency room , but 
is not admitted to a ward)  
• Overdose of study drug or concomitant medication unless associated with an  SAE. However, 
the event should still be captured as a nonserious AE i n the appropriate eCRF page  
• Events of progression of the patient ’s underlying cancer as well as events clearly related to 
progression of the patient’s cancer (signs and symptoms of progression) and progression of 
disease leading to death  should not be reported as a n AE or  SAE . This section exclude s other 
SAEs with fata l outcome

changes in lab values within the normal range will require similar judgment.  
An abnormal laboratory value that is not already associated with an AE is to be recor ded as an 
AE only if any one of the following criteria is met:  
• an action on the study drug is made as a result of the abnormality  
• intervention for management of the abnormality is required 
• at the discretion of the investigator should the abnormality be dee med clinically significant  
 
10.6 Pregnancy or Drug Exposure During Pregnancy 
A pregnancy is not considered to be an AE or SAE; however, any pregnancy occurring in a 
partner of a study patient during study participation or within [ADDRESS_598242] be 
reported to the sponsor using the Pregnancy Report Form within the same timelines as an SAE.  
A pregnancy will be followed through to outcome. Once the outcome of the pregnancy is known, 
the Pregnancy Outcome Report Form is to  be completed and reported to the Sponsor.  
AEs, SAEs, or AESIs that occur during pregnancy will be assessed and processed according to 
the AE or SAE/AESI processes using the appropriate AE or SAE/AESI forms.  
10.[ADDRESS_598243]  
Events that occur after signing of informed consent but prior to initiation of study drug, unless 
due to a protocol -mandated procedure,  are to  be recorded i n the Medical History eCRF ; however, 
events are to be reported as SAEs if serious and related to a protocol -mandated procedure  during 
the Pre- Screening Phase or Screening Phase .  
Any AE that occurs after first dose of study drug through [ADDRESS_598244] dose of 
study drug will be recorded i n the AE eCRF.  
After t he 28-day Follow- up Visit , only SAEs assessed as potentially related to study drug should 
be reported  per Clovis Oncology PV requirements and captured in the Clovis Oncology PV

activities  
• Severe events are medically significant, but not immediately  life-threatening; interrupt the 
patient’s usual self -care daily activities, disablin g, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or prolongation of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) is indicated  
• Life-threatening events require urgent intervention to prevent death ; or 
• Fatal events are those events that lea d to the patient’s death  
 
10.7.4  Causal Relationship of Adverse Events to Stud y Drug  
Medical judgment should be used to determine the cause of the AE considering all relevant 
factors such as , but not limited to , the underlying study indication, coexisting disease, 
concomitant medication, relevant history, pattern of the AE, temporal relationship to the study 
medication,  and dechallenge or rechallenge with the study drug.

concomitant medication s, disease under study, etc.)  
• It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
study drug  
• It does not follow a known pattern of response to study drug 
• It does not  reappear or worsen when study drug is restarted, or  
• An alternative explanation is likely , but not  clearly identifiable . 
 
Related to 
Study Drug • An AE that is difficult to assign to alternative causes.

used to estimate the HR between the randomized treatment groups for the primary endpoint .  
The number of patients with events and the number of censored patients will also be presented. 
For stratified analyses, if one or more of the strata contain few patients (eg, <  5 patients) or only 
patients from a single treatment group, or if the convergence criteria in SAS are not met, strata will be combined to ensure a sufficient number of patients in each stratum by [CONTACT_466514] (which is equivalent to combining the 2 categories) and then combining the BRCA1/ [ADDRESS_598256] will be used for treatment group comparisons.  
The primary and key secondary endpoints will be tested among the patients with a deleterious  
BRCA 1/2 mutation  and the ITT Population, using an ordered step- down multiple comparisons 
procedure. The primary endpoint of rPFSirr in the subgroup of patients with a deleterious 
BRCA 1/[ADDRESS_598257] at a two -sided 0.05 significance level. If rPFSirr in the 
subgroup of patients with a deleterious BRCA 1/2 mutation  is statistically significant, then 
rPFSirr will be tested in the ITT Population (see Section  11.3). Continuing in an ordered 
step-down manner, the key secondary endpoints of OS and ORR (by [CONTACT_466451]) will be tested at the 
two-sided 0.[ADDRESS_598258] , 
statistical significance will not be declared for all subsequent analyses in the ordered step -down 
procedure. See Section 11.6 for details about the ordered step -down procedure.  
As a secondary endpoint of the study, trough concentrations (C
min) of rucaparib will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics overall and by [CONTACT_466515] P K 
sample collected.  
Further details  to describe handling of missing, unused, and spurious data will be in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  Unless otherwise specified, baseline is defined as the last 
measurement on or prior to the first day of study drug administrati on or randomization date, if 
the patient was never treated .  
All statistical analyses will be conducted with the SAS® System, V ersion  9.3 or higher. Further 
detai ls around the statistical analys es planned in this study will be outlined in the SAP.  Changes 
to or deviations from the SAP will be described in the clinical study report (CSR).  
11.2 Determination of Sample Size 
The tot al enro llment planned for this study is approximately 400 patients. A total of  
approximately 300 patients with a deleterious BRCA1/2 gene mutation will be randomized  and 
approximately 100 patients with a  deleterious  ATM gene mutation may be randomized . This is a 
multicenter, multinational study. Patients will be enrolled across approximately 150 study sites 
worldwide. 
The total enrollment planned is approximately 400 patients, with approximately 300 patients in 
the subgroup with a deleterious BRCA 1/2 m utation  and approximately 100 patients in the

control arm and 10 months for rucaparib  in the subgroup of patients with a deleterious BRCA 1/2 
mutation and 9  months for rucaparib in the total population. A sample size of approximately 
300 patients in the subgroup with a deleterious BRCA 1/2 mutation  should result in 
approximately 200 events of rPFS, which will provide approximately 90%  power to detect a HR 
of 0.6 at a one- sided 0.025 significance level. A sample size of approximately 400 total patients 
should result in approximately  270 events of rPFS, which will provide approximately 90%  power 
to detect a HR of 0.6 7 at a one -sided 0.025 significance level . 
11.3 Analysis Populations  
The following analysis populations are defined for the study:  
Safety Population  – The safety population will consist of all patients who received at l east one 
dose of protocol -specified treatment.  
Intent -to-Treat Population  – The ITT population w ill consist of all randomized patients  
(ie, patients with BRCA -mutated mCRPC and patients with ATM -mutated mCRPC) . 
BRCA Subgroup – The BRCA Subgroup will consist of patients in the ITT population with 
BRCA -mutated mCRPC.  
IRR Efficacy Population  – The IRR efficacy population will consist of all patients evaluable for 
response by [CONTACT_466516] 1.1/PCWG3 criteria  (Appendix 1) per independent radiology 
review.  
Investigator Efficacy Population  – The investigator efficacy population will consist of all 
patients evaluable for response by [CONTACT_466457]  1.1/PCWG3 criteria ( Appendix 1) per 
investigator.  
11.4 Patient Disposition 
Patient disposition will be summarized using frequency counts and the corresponding 
percentages. The number of patients in each analysis population, number of patients 
discontinued , and the  primary reason for discontinuation will be summarized.

DOR is defined as the time from the first response (modified RECIST  Version 1.1  in patients 
with visceral/nodal disease) until the first date that PD (using the same criteria) is documented. DOR  will be summarized and analyzed for the responders using the same methodology as 
described for the primary endpoint. DOR will be analyzed separately for both IRR and 
investigator assessments.  
Time to PSA progression is defined as the time from randomization to the date that a ≥  25% 
increase and absolute increase of ≥  2 ng/mL above the nadir (or baseline value for patients who

All information about the clinical study, including the patient information and the ICF,  is 
prepared and used for the protection of the human rights of the patient according to ICH GCP 
guidelines, the Declaration of Helsinki, and local requirements . 
The IC F(s), prepared by [CONTACT_466526], must comply with all 
applicable regulations, be approved along with the study protocol by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB and be 
acceptable to the sponsor.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain legally -effective informed consent  from each 
patient participating in this study after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, objectives, and potential hazards of the study, answering all questions from the patients regarding the study,  
and prior to undertaking any study- related procedures.  
13.2.[ADDRESS_598274] current IEC/IRB-approved ICF. The investigator or their designee shall discuss with each patient  the 
nature of the study, its requirements, and that participation is voluntary and may be terminated at any time by [CONTACT_466527]. To participate in the study, informed consent must be obtained from each prospective patient prior to any protocol- specific activities.  
The ICF must be in language fully comprehensible to the prospective patient. Patients or 
legal ly-authorized  representatives  (where acceptable according to national law and/or local 
regulations ) must be given sufficient time a nd opportunity to inquire about the details of the 
study and to discuss and decide on their participation in the study with the investigator. T he 
patient  and the person conducting the informed consent discussion for the study will  personally 
sign and date the ICF in addition to any other required signature (if applicable). A copy of the 
signed ICF will be retained by [CONTACT_466528] -authorized representative and the original 
ICF will be filed in the investigator file. The process of obtaining informed consent will be 
documented in the patient’s source documents. The date when a patient’s informed consent was 
obtained will be captured in the patient’s source documents and eCRF. The  patient will need to 
re-consent if the ICF is updated during the study, such as after an amendment to the protocol, if 
mandated by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB.  
The ICF will contain a separate section that addresses the use of remaining mandatory  or 
optional samples for optional exploratory research. The investigator or authorized designee will 
explain to each study patient the objectives of the exploratory research. Patients will be told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their consent at any ti me and for any 
reason during the storage period. A separate consent will be required to document a patient's 
agreement to allow any remaining specimens to be used for exploratory research.  
Rucaparib Clovis Oncology, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol : CO-[ADDRESS_598275] assure that patients’  anonymity is strictly maintained and that their 
identities are protected from unauthorized parties. Only identification code s (ie, no names  or, in

form submitted to the sponsor and the IEC/IRB. The investigator mus t maintain  a list with the 
identity of all study participants, but not intended for use by [CONTACT_456] .  
The investigator further agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent the disclosure of 
confidential patient information to any unauthorized party or into the public domain. The 
investigator will notify Clovis Oncology  within [ADDRESS_598276] research organization (CRO)  or contract monitor acting on the sponsor’s 
behalf, will contact [CONTACT_466529] (unless the sponsor  or the CRO has worked with the center recently  in the same or

the last visit by [CONTACT_112676], and the potential investigator/site are currently in good 
standing with respect to regulatory compliance,  in which case this initial visit maybe waived) 
and at appropriate intervals during the study until after the l ast patient is completed.   
In accordance with ICH GCP guidelines, and local regulations, the clinical monitor will 
periodically review, via direct access, eCRFs, study documents, and medical records (office, 
clinic, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) for patients  enrolled  in this study . Monitors will not share patient identifiers 
with the sponsor. Additionally, the clinical monitor will review and assess  research facilities, and 
clinical laboratory facilities associated with the study. Clinical monitoring will be scheduled to occur at mutually convenient times until completion of the study. If these requirements are in 
conflict with local regulatory restrictions or institutional requirements, the investigator must 
inform the sponsor of these restrictions before initiation of the study. 
Where applicable, if the sponsor or their representatives are not able to come to the study center, 
patient study data may be reviewed by [CONTACT_171367], in conformity with the applicable 
institutional guidance and local regulations. The site staff m ay place relevant medical records, 
with personal identifiers removed, into a secure computer system for the sponsor or their representative to view, allow them to view these records during a video conference, and/or 
provide them direct access to patient’s electronic medical records. This review would occur in a 
manner that protects the confidentiality of study patient data. Whether a patient’s medical 
records are reviewed at the study center or remotely, their identity and medical records will be 
kept secur e during this process. Remote review of patient study data should not be carried out if 
adequate data protection, including data security and protection of personal data even if pseudonymized, is not ensured. Further details will be provided in the study t raining materials

Criteria (Version 1.1) and Prostate Cancer Working Group [ADDRESS_598293] guidelines (Version  1.1) are described in Eisenhauer et al. 200953 at 
http://www.eortc.be/Recist/Default.htm  and PCWG3 criteria as described by [CONTACT_171376], et al. 2016 .25 
A short summary is given below.  
Measurable Disease:  
Tumor lesions : measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at 
least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) with the following:  
− A minimum size of [ADDRESS_598294]  scan (CT  scan slice thickness no greater than 5  mm)  
− A minimum size of 10  mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions that cannot be 
accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as nonmeasurable)  
− A minimum size of [ADDRESS_598295] be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node must be ≥  [ADDRESS_598296]  scan (CT  scan slice thickness 
recommended to be not greater than 5  mm). At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will 
be meas ured and followed.  
Nonmeasurable Disease:  
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <  10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with ≥  10 to <  15 mm short axis), as well as truly nonmeasurable 
lesions, are considered nonmeasurable disease. Lesions considered truly nonmeasurable include 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, inflammatory breast disease, 
lymphangitic involvement of skin and lung, and abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly 
identified by [CONTACT_87415].  
Bone Lesions  
For the purposes of this study, bone metastatic lesions should be recorded at baseline and 
followed during treatment using PCWG3 criteria. Bone lesions should not be recorded as target 
or nontarget lesions to be followed by [CONTACT_150114]  1.1 criteria ; this includes bone lesions 
with a soft tissue component and soft tissue lesions extending from a bone lesion.  
Lesions with Prior Local Treatment  
Tumor lesions situated in a previous irradiated area or in an area subjected to other locoregional 
therapy are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in 
the lesion.  
Rucaparib Clovis Oncology, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol : CO-338 -063 Amendment 4  18 February 2022 
Confidential Page  127 Target Lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5  lesions per organ (per PCWG3), representative of 
all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. 
A maximum of 10 target lesions  total should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with 
the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by [CONTACT_14217]). A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be 
calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD will be used as refer ence 
by [CONTACT_14218].  
Prostate and prostatic bed lesions should NOT be selected as target lesions, according to PCWG3 
criteria.  
Nontarget Lesions  
RECIST  Version  1.[ADDRESS_598297] should be performed using a ≤  [ADDRESS_598298] performed as part of a PET/CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast) then the CT portion of the PET/CT can be used for RECIST  Version 1.[ADDRESS_598299] is preferable.   
Ultrasound, endoscopy and laparoscopy should not be used to measure tumor lesions.  
Cytology and histology can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases (eg,  after 
treatment to differentiate between residual benign lesions and residual malignant lesions.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging- based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_16688] a treatment.

Clinical Study Protocol : CO-338 -063 Amendment 4  18 February 2022 
Confidential Page  128 Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether 
target or nontarget) must have reduction in short axis to < [ADDRESS_598300] a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as 
reference the baseline sum LD.  
Stable Disease Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify 
for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.  
Progressive Disease At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as 
reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must 
also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new extra -skeletal lesions is also considered progression. For bone 
lesions, refer to PCWG3 criteria for determ ining progressive disease.  
 
Evaluation of Nontarget Lesions  
Complete Response  Disappearance of all nontarget lesions.  
Stable Disease/Incomplete 
Response  Persistence of one or more nontarget lesion(s).  
Progressive Disease Appearance of one or more new extra -skeletal lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing nontarget lesions. For  bone lesions, refer to PCWG3 
criteria for determining progressive disease.  
Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started). The patient’s best response assignment  will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

Any Yes PD 
a ‘Non -CR/non -PD’ is preferred over ‘stable disease’ for non -target disease since SD is increasingly used as 
endpoint for assessment of efﬁcacy in some studies  so to assign this category when no lesions can be 
measured is not advised.  
 
Patients with global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without 
objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having symptomatic 
deterioration. Every effort should be made to document the objective progression, even after discontinuation of treatment.  
In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. 
When evaluation of CR depends on this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion 
be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]/biopsy) prior to confirming the complete response status.   
Confirmation  
If an initial CR or PR is noted, confirmatory scans must be performed at least 4 weeks later.   
Duration of Response  (DOR)  
CT scans are required for this study at screening and every 8 calendar weeks (within 7  days 
before or after is permitted) thereafter. Patients who have been on study at least 24 weeks, may 
Rucaparib Clovis Oncology, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol : CO-338 -063 Amendment 4  18 February 2022 
Confidential Page  130 decrease the frequency of disease/  tumor assessments to every 12 ca lendar  weeks (within 7  days 
before or after is permitted).  
Duration of Overall Response  
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR 
or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or PD is objectively 
documented (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment 
started), including progression in bone per PCWG3 criteria.  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are fir st met for CR 
until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.  
Duration of Stable Disease 
SD is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as 
reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.  
PCWG3 Criteria for Assessment of Bone Disease  
PCWG3 criteria will be used to document evidence of disease progression in bone lesions as described by [CONTACT_171376], et al. [ADDRESS_598302]. A quantitative measure of disease burden, such as lesion 
number, the bone scan index, or lesion area, is also suggested, recognizing that these measures 
require further analytical and prospective cl inical validation. Changes in lesions considered 
metastatic on bone scintigraphy should be followed and assessed serially using a bone scan assessment form. Areas/lesions on bone scintigraphy that are suggestive can be assessed further 
with CT or MRI and followed separately, but such supplemental imaging should not be used to 
establish indicator lesions for the purposes of a study. 
Different modalities for imaging bone metastases can provide different information for the same 
patient. However, because of the lack of standards for reporting disease presence or changes after 
treatment, PET imaging with sodium fluoride, fluorodeoxyglucose, choline, or prostate -specific 
membrane antigen, bone marrow MRI (body MRI), and other modalities that are in use to image 
bone, should be approached as new biomarkers subject to independent validation.  
Criteria for progression in bone at study entry  
• Two new lesions observed on 99mTc- MDP or HDP  radionuclide bone scintigraphy  
• Confirm ambiguous results by [CONTACT_15210] (eg, CT or MRI) however only 
positivity on the bone scan defines metastatic disease to bone

Clinical Study Protocol : CO-338 -063 Amendment 4  18 February 2022 
Confidential Page  131 Documentation of baseline bone disease  
• Presence or absence of metastasis recorded first  
• A quantitative measure of disease burden, such as lesional number, the bone scan index, or 
lesion area, is required  
• Changes in lesions considered metastatic on bone scintigraphy should be followed and assessed serially using a bone scan assessment form. Areas/lesions on bone scintigraphy that 
are suggestive can be assessed further with CT or MRI and followed separately, but such 
supplemental imaging should not be used to establish indicator lesions for the purposes of a 
study 
 
Following for bone progression during the study  
• Exclude pseudoprogression in the absence of symptoms or other signs of progression 
• At least two new lesions on scans during the 12- week flare window (ie, the first post -
treatment scan ), which are persistent and appear with at least two additional lesions on the 
next scan  after the 12 -week  flare window  (2+2 rule)  
• If at least two additional new lesions are seen on the next (confirmatory) scan  performed 
after the [ADDRESS_598303] two new lesions were doc umented  
• For scans after the 12- week flare window (ie, after the first post -treatment scan ), at least two 
new lesions relative to the first post- treatment scan confirmed on a subsequent scan  
• Date of progression is the date of the scan that first documents the second lesion 
• Changes in intensity of uptake alone do not constitute either progression or regression

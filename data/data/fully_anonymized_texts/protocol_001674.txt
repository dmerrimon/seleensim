1.[ADDRESS_607803] COVID -19 safety guidel ines, including face masks, social 
distancing, and frequent hand washing. Masks will be worn in the lab and in 
the Environmental  Research  Building  (ERB)  at all times,  and social  distancing 
protocols will be followed. Before returning to the Boise State Uni versity 
campus after scheduled breaks or campus closures, all lab members will 
follow university guidelines for COVID -19 testing and isolation, if required. 
All lab members will participate in a weekly or bi -weekly virtual meeting to 
remain up -to-date and aligned on tasks. There will be no face -to-face 
interactions  between  lab members  and potential  or enrolled  study  participants.  
 
All communication with participants and any potential participants will be 
done via their preferred method of communication (call or text) and in their 
preferred  language.  In most  instances  in this protocol  it is assumed  that text is 
the preferred method o f communication for participants once enrolled in  this 
5  study.  In addition  to collecting  and testing  urine  samples,  as well as managing 
food ordering  and delivery  activities,  lab members  will also be responsible  for 
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_474336]. Accurate, detailed 
documentation is a vital part of the data collection process. The following 
guidelines will help lab members in completing the forms included in this 
document and logging  activities:  
 
• Be compulsive  in record  keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  It is better  to record  too much 
information than not enough. After the data are collected, these 
records will be the only way of knowing what occurred during 
sample collection and in the  lab. 
 
• Always use pen (no  pencils).  
 
• If a record on a form ne eds to be changed, draw a single line 
through the entry that needs to be changed, write in thecorrect 
information, and then write the date of the change and the 
initials of the lab member making the  change.  
 
• If a mistake is made or there are deviations fro m protocol, 
indicate this on the associated form. This is very importantin 
helpi[INVESTIGATOR_474337].  
 
• Always use 24 hour (i.e. military)  time.

A lab member will compi[INVESTIGATOR_474346]. The Urine 
Chain of Custody Form will be taken from the folder in the locked filing 
cabinet labeled with the participant’s ID number. The lab member will take 
all supplies to the urine collec tion. 
Scheduling  
 
For weekly urine sample collections, participants will be informed at the 
initial contact[CONTACT_474384] a pre -established date and time for weekly 
sample pi[INVESTIGATOR_474347], which will be decided a priori by [CONTACT_474385]. 
Scheduling changes will be considered should the pre -set day and time for 
weekly  sample  collection  not work  for a study  participant.  All scheduling  will 
be recorded in the CAHL Calendar. The lab member will call or text the 
participant one day prior to the scheduled pi[INVESTIGATOR_474348] a  reminder.  
 
Weekly Urine Sample Collections  
 
Each  week  on the pre-scheduled  day, participants  will be instructed  to provide 
a first morning  void in the specimen  cup with the barcoded  label  for that week, 
which was provided to them at the prior week’s collection. The participants 
will be instructed to use their previously provided Sharpie to record the date 
and time of collection  directly on the specimen cup. The sample should be 
provided the morning of the collection day (first morning void), and then 
placed  in the sealable  plastic  bag and into the previously  provided  cooler  with 
the ice pack.  This cooler  will then be placed  outside  the participant’s  home.  A 
lab member will then travel to each participant’s home to collect the urine 
sample. If the lab member arrives at a participant’s home and finds that the 
weekly urine sample has not been provided, the lab member will make 
reasonable attempts to contact [CONTACT_474386].  
 
At collection, the lab member will ensure that the cup is labeled with the 
correct  Participant  ID number  and correct  week  number.  The cup will then be 
placed in the lab cooler wit h the lab ice pack to be taken back to CAHL. The 
lab member will leave in the participant’s cooler: 1) specimen cup with 
barcoded label for the following week’s collection in sealable plastic bag;  2) 
17  extra specimen cup to be used in case of an accident and only when  barcoded 
cup is not available; and 3) a $[ADDRESS_607818] the weekly urine sample in the refrigerator and 
complete the appropriate sections of the Urine Chain of Custody Form. This 
sample  will remain  in the refrigerator  for no more  than 24 hours  until analyzed 
for color, clarity and specific gravity, and stored at -80˚C. The lab member 
will then document  all information  in the K01 Database.  The lab member  will 
file the Urine Chain of Custody Form in the folder labeled with that 
participant’s ID number in the locked filing cabinet. At this time, the lab 
member should analyze and store the weekly urine sample as described in 
Section [ADDRESS_607819] from her due date, a 
text message wi ll be sent to the participant in her preferred language to 
remind her to let us know once she gives birth. Once the participant informs 
us that her baby [CONTACT_168461], no more weekly urine samples will be 
provided or collected. Each participant will receiv e a $[ADDRESS_607820] purchases and documentation will follow Boise State 
University rules and regulations.  
 
 
5. WEEKLY URINE SAMPLE ANALYSIS &  STORAGE  
 
5.1 Summary of Methods  
 
Weekly urine samples will be collected from participants and returned to 
CAHL in a lab cooler with a lab ice pack. Samples will be stored for no 
more than 24 hours under refrigeration at CAHL until analyzed and stored. 
During analysis, lab members will det ermine urine color, clarity, and 
specific gravity. Urine sample storage will occur immediately after urine 
sample analysis. Each sample will be aliquoted into four 4mL weekly 
cryovials  for storage.  These  will be stored  in a weekly  cryobox  in the CAHL  
-80˚C  freezer. At the conclusion of an individual’s participation in the  study 
(ideally when they give birth), one of the four 4 mL weekly cryovials from 
each week will be sent to the CDC for glyphosate analysis. The remaining 
three cryovials are duplicate samp les that will be stored in  thebiorepository.

will then be filed in the folder labeled with the participant’s ID in the locked 
filing cabinet.  
 
Weekly Urine Sample Storage  
 
Supplies Preparation  
 
Urine sample storage should occur immediately after analysis. Prior to 
beginning  storage  procedures,  the lab member  will set the following  supplies 
out on a lab station on an absorbent pad (this can be the same absorbent pad 
used during analysis): 1) Eppen dorf Plus Research Pi[INVESTIGATOR_8462] (set at 4.0 mL) 
and tip; 2) four 4 mL weekly cryovials with the appropriate barcoded  labels;  
3) one cryobox at the lab station; and 4) the appropriate urine specimen cup. 
A pair of nitrile gloves will be worn when handling urine samples.  
 
Weekly Urine Sample Storage  
 
Four mL of the urine sample will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_474350] [ADDRESS_607821] been filled, the lab member will remove the 
weekly cryobox from the -80˚C freezer. This weekly cryobox will be placed 
at the lab station, and the newly filled weekly cryovials will then be 
transferred from the cryobox at the lab s tation and into the freezer weekly 
cryobox. The weekly cryobox in the freezer will only be removed from the 
freezer briefly for daily cryovial transfer, and it will be immediately returned 
to the freezer as quickly as possible.  
 
Documentation  
 
The lab memb er will record the specific cryovial label and cell number 
where each of the four weekly cryovials were placed in the freezer weekly 
cryobox. This will be recorded in the CAHL shared Google Drive Cryobox 
Document.

6.[ADDRESS_607823]  the Dietary  Intervention  Reminder  Flyer  in the participants’  coolers 
in their preferred  language.  
 
Participants will be provided their own local grocery store account username 
[CONTACT_474393] a lab member. Participants will receive a personalized flyer 
(described in more detail below) with instructions regarding how to log into  
24  their accou nt and shop for up to $150 worth of groceries (either conventional 
or organic, as randomly assigned) and select their preferred grocery delivery 
time.  
 
Participants will also be instructed to call or text a lab member via the One 
Talk App once grocery shop pi[INVESTIGATOR_53090]. The lab member will then 
review the order to ensure that all items are available and correspond to the 
week in which the participant has been randomized (i.e., conventional or 
organic),  and that no prohibited  items  have  been  added  (e.g.,  no alcohol,  non- 
food items, items from the “Personal Care & Health” department, cigarettes, 
or lottery tickets). The lab member will contact [CONTACT_474388].  After  the lab member  has reviewed  the 
order, h e/she will contact [CONTACT_474389]. The participant or a member of her household must 
be home at the time of grocery delivery. The grocery order will be placed by 
[CONTACT_474390].  
 
Participants wil l also be given a brief food log for each week, in which they 
will be asked to note any food or drinks they consume from food outside of 
their grocery order, including any meals from restaurants. Participants will 
also be asked to complete a Likert scale q uestion each day with the  following 
options: “Everything I ate was fromthe study,” “Most of what I ate was from 
the study,” “About half what I ate was from the study,” “A little bit of what I 
ate was from the study,” or “None of what I ate was from the  study.”  
 
Week One  
 
A lab member will leave a Personalized Week One Grocery Flyer in the 
participant’s cooler in her preferred language during weekly urine sample 
collections from June 3 -June 9. Each Week One Grocery Flyer will be 
personalized for each part icipant. This flyer will clearly indicate: 1) the 
participant’s username [CONTACT_474394],  2) whether  she should  shop  for conventional  or organic  groceries for 
this week, 3) how to complete her grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]; 4) ho w to select her 
preferred grocery store location and delivery time frame, 5) the deadline for 
completing her grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and 6) instructions to text or call lab 
members on the One Talk phone number once her grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_474351].  
25  On the day before the participant is scheduled to complete her Week One 
grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], the lab member will send a text to the participant in her 
preferred language reminding her to complete her order by 5:00 PM the 
following day, if she has not done so yet. 
 
Grocery orders for Week One will be delivered to participants on June 14. 
Participants will begin to eat their Week One groceries on June 14.  
 
The Week One Food Log will be left in each participant’s cooler in her 
preferred language by a lab member d uring urine sample collections on June 
7-11. Participants will complete the Week One Food Log from June [ADDRESS_607824] the Personalized Week Two Grocery Flyer in the 
participant’s cooler in her preferred language during daily urine sample 
collection  on June 17 or June 18. This flyer  will be similar  to the Personalized 
Week  One Grocery  Flyer,  but with appropriate  changes  made  for Week  Two.  
 
On the day before the participant is scheduled to complete her Week Two 
grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], the lab member will send a  text to the participant in her 
preferred language reminding her to complete her order by 5:[ADDRESS_607825] morning void  on 
the morning of June 22, prior to consuming any Week Two  groceries.  
26  The Week  Two Food  Log will be left in each participant’s  cooler  in her 
preferred language by a lab member during urine sample collections on  June 
21. Participants will complete the Week Two Food Log from June [ADDRESS_607826] that day’s sample, 
provide the participant with a specimen cup for the following day, and  bring 
that week’s sample back to CAHL in a lab cooler with a lab ice pack. Once 
back  at CAHL,  the lab member  will analyze  and store  the daily  urine  sample.  
 
Daily urine sample collections will follow the same protocol as described in 
Section 4 of this doc ument, with the following major deviations:  
 
• Lab members will collect and deliver daily urine samplecups, 
rather than weekly urine sample  cups 
 
• Lab members  will complete  a Daily  Urine  Chain  of Custody 
Form, rather than the Urine Chain of Custody  Form.  
 
• For non -local collections two days of daily urine samples will 
be collected during a two -day trip. On the first day a lab 
member will drive to that area, collect the daily urine samples 
for that day, transport the daily urine samples in a lab cooler 
with a  lab ice pack to a hotel, and store the daily urine samples 
in the study refrigerator at the hotel. The lab member will  spend 
the night at the hotel, and then on the second day the lab 
member will collect the daily urine samples for that day and 
bring the urine samples for both days back to CAHL in a lab 
cooler with a lab ice  pack  
 
• Participants will receive one $[ADDRESS_607827] at the end of the 
dietary intervention period if they provided all 14 daily urine 
samples, rather than receiving a $[ADDRESS_607828] for e ach sample 
collected

For daily urine sample collections, a lab member will compi[INVESTIGATOR_474352]. The Daily Urine Chain of Custody Form will be  taken 
from the folder in the locked filing cabinet labeled with the participant ’s ID 
number. The lab member will take all supplies to the urine  collection.  
Daily Urine Sample Collections  
 
Each  day, participants  will be instructed  to provide  a first morning  void in the 
specimen cup with the barcoded label for that day, which was provided to 
them at the prior day’s collection. The participants will be instructed to use 
their previously provided Sharpie to record the date and time of collection 
directly on the specimen  cup. The sample should be provided the morning of 
the collection day (first morning void), and then placed in the sealable plastic 
bag and into the previously  provided  cooler  with the ice pack.  This cooler  will 
then be placed outside the participant’s  home. 
 
Two lab members  will collect  local  daily  urine  samples  as described  in Section 
[ADDRESS_607832] day (this will occur on June 16, 18, 
20, 24, 26, and 28), collect the daily urine samples for that day, transport the 
daily urine samples in a lab cooler with a lab ice pack to the hotel, and store 
the samples in the study refrigerator at the ho tel. The lab member will spend 
the night at the hotel, and then on the second day the lab member will collect 
the daily urine samples for that day (June 17, 19, 21, 25, 27, and 29). The lab 
member will then bring the urine samples for both days back to CAH L in a  
30  lab cooler  with a lab ice pack.  Daily  urine  sample  collected  from  the non-local 
area on June 22 and June 30 will be completed  by [CONTACT_474391]. 
 
The lab member will text the participant one day prior to each daily pi[INVESTIGATOR_474353] a reminder. After each sample collection, a text message will be sent to 
each participant.  
 
If a participant does not provide a urine sample for a given day, the lab 
member wil l document the missed day on the Daily Urine Chain of Custody 
Form. This will be considered a missed day and that day number will not be 
reused the following day; the next sequential day number will be used.  
 
Documentation upon Returning to the Lab  
 
After collecting samples, the lab member will return back to CAHL either 1) 
on the same  day for local urine  sample collections,  or 2) on the second day  of 
each two -day trip for non -local urine sample collections. There, the lab 
member  will place  the daily  urine  samples  in the refrigerator  and complete  the 
appropriate sections of the Daily Urine Chain of Custody Form. The samples 
will remain in the refrigerator for no more than [ADDRESS_607833]  be prioritized  for 
processing on the same day they return to the  lab. 
 
Gift Cards  
 
A $[ADDRESS_607834] will be given to participants who provide all 14 daily urine 
samples.  
 
8. DAILY URINE SAMPLE ANALYSIS &  STORAGE  
 
8.1 Summary of  Methods  
 
Daily  urine  samples  will be collected  from  participants  and returned  to CAHL 
in a lab cooler with a lab ice pack. Each day, one or more lab member(s) will 
be responsible  for analyzing  and storing  all daily  urine  samples  arriving  in the 
lab that day. During analysis, the lab member will determine urine color, 
clarity, and specific gravity. Urine sample storage will occur immediately 
after urine  sample  analysis.  Each  sample  will be aliquoted  into two 4mL daily  
31  cryovials f or storage. These will be stored in the daily cryobox in the CAHL  
-80˚C freezer. In addition, 0.6 mL of each urine sample will be aliquoted into 
two 4 mL composite cryovials created for each participant for each week. 
These  will be stored  in the composite  cryobox  in the CAHL  -80˚C  freezer.  At 
the end of the dietary intervention, each participant will have two 4 mL 
composite  cryovials  that contains  0.6 mL of each daily  sample  for each week, 
representing  a weekly  composite  sample.  At the conclusion  of an individual’s 
participation in the study (ideally when she gives birth), one of the two 4 mL 
composite cryovials from each week will be sent to the CDC for glyphosate 
analysis (up to 2 total composite cryovials per participant: one for week one 
and one for week  two).  The remaining  composite  cryovials,  as well as the two 
daily 4 mL cryovials, will be stored in the  biorepository.

8. 3 Procedures  
 
Daily Urine Sample Analysis  
Lab members will analyze the daily urine samples as described in Section  
5.3 of this document.  
 
Daily Urine Sample Storage  
 
Supplies Preparation  
 
Urine sample storage should occur immediately after analysis. Prior to 
beginning storage procedures, the lab member will set the following supplies 
out on a lab station on an absorbent pad (this can be the same absorbent pad 
used during analysis): 1) Eppen dorf Plus Research Pi[INVESTIGATOR_8462] (set at 4.0 mL and 
then changed to 0.6 mL) and tip; 2) two 4 mL daily cryovials with the 
appropriate barcoded labels and two 4 mL composite cryovials with the 
appropriate barcoded labels; 3) one cryobox at the lab station; and 4)  the 
appropriate urine specimen cup. A pair of nitrile gloves will be worn when 
handling urine samples.  
33  Daily Urine Sample Storage (Daily Cryovials)  
 
Four mL of the urine sample will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_474354] [ADDRESS_607835]  been  filled,  the lab member  will remove  the daily  cryobox 
from the -80˚C freezer. This daily cryobox will be placed at the lab station, 
and the newly filled daily cryovials will then be transferred from the cryobox 
at the lab station and into the freezer daily cryobox. The daily cryobox in the 
freezer wil l only be removed from the freezer briefly for daily cryovial 
transfer, and it will be immediately returned to the freezer as quickly as 
possible.  
 
Daily Urine Sample Storage (Composite Cryovials)

9. URINE SAMPLE SHIPM ENT & GLYPHOSATE  ANALYSIS  
 
9.[ADDRESS_607837] been collected, analyzed, and 
stored for all 40 participants, two lab members will complete a quality 
assurance (QA) check of each cryovial to ensure that it is lab eled with the 
correct barcoded label and that it is placed in the correct cryobox and correct 
cell, and that this information correlates with the information in the K01 
Database,  as well as with the Google  Drive  Cryobox  Documents.  The QA will 
be done thoro ughly, but quickly, to prevent the thawing of the cryovials. 
Following the QA, the first of the four cryovials from every other week and 
the first composite  cryovials  from  each week  in the dietary  intervention,  along 
with a number of quality control vials and randomly selected cryovials, will 
be sent to the CDC for glyphosate analysis. These samples will be packaged 
by [CONTACT_474392][INVESTIGATOR_474355].

9.3 Procedures  
 
Quality Assurance  
 
Weekly Urine Samples Electronic Documentation Check  
 
The electronic database documents containing information on the stored 
weekly urine sample collections and cryovials will be exported from their 
original source. All changes to any of these documents will be done on the 
exported copi[INVESTIGATOR_474359]. No changes will be made the original 
data sources.  
 
The lab member  will cross -check  the exported  forms  with the exported  aliquot 
boxes document. The lab member will highlight any info rmation on  the 
36  exported aliquot boxes document that does not match or that seems 
implausible. The lab member will briefly describe the issue in the margins of 
the exported aliquot boxes document. The lab member will refer to the Urine 
Chain of Custody Form as needed.  
 
Weekly Urine Sample Cryovials Check  
 
After completion of the Electronic Documentation Check, two lab members 
will cross -check the now highlighted exported aliquot boxes document with 
the frozen cryovials in order to 1) confirm that each cryovial is in the co rrect 
cell; 2) confirm  that each cryovial  is labeled  correctly;  and 3) clarify  any typos 
or resolve other issues in the exported aliquot boxes  document.  
 
Documentation and Correction  
 
After all the weekly cryoboxes have been checked and returned to the -80˚C 
freezer, the lab members will review all the highlighting and notes in the 
exported aliquot boxes document. Typos will be corrected as appropriate.  
 
Quality Assurance For Daily and Composite Urine Samples  
 
QA for the daily  and composite  urine  samples  will follow  the same  procedures 
as QA for the weekly urine samples as described  above.  
 
Sample Shipment  
 
Sample Selection  
 
[CONTACT_474396] will select [ADDRESS_607838] of  the two composite 
cryovials from each week of the dietary intervention from each participant to 
the CDC, as well as all 14 daily cryovials from one participant fromeach day 
of the dietary intervention to serve as composite sample  qualitycontrol.  
37  Supplies Preparation  
 
Prior  to the shipment  of urine  samples  to the CDC,  three  lab members  will set 
up a shippi[INVESTIGATOR_474360]:  1) twelve  cryovial 
carrier boxes; 2) twenty -four small absorbent pads; 3) twenty -four rubber 
bands; 4) twelve biohazard bags; 5) shippi[INVESTIGATOR_474356]; 6) shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3858]; 7) 
shippi[INVESTIGATOR_45295]; 8) shippi[INVESTIGATOR_474357]; and 9) four absorbent pads. The lab 
members will also have five  ice packs in the freezer and five pounds of dry 
ice in the -80˚C freezer, and will have the Aliquot Boxes Spreadsheet 
available  electronically.  
 
Packaging and Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_474361], then composite cryovials, and 
then daily cryovials. Cryoboxes will be pulled from the -80˚C freezer one at 
a time and the selected cryovials from that cryobox will be transferred to a 
cryovial carrier  box. 
 
The l ab members will place the five ice packs from the freezer at the bottom 
of the shippi[INVESTIGATOR_474362]. The lab members 
will then remove all twelve cryovial carrier boxes in biohazard bags  fromthe  
-80˚C freezer and place them in to the shippi[INVESTIGATOR_474363]. Finally, two more absorbent pads will be placed on top and the lid 
to the shippi[INVESTIGATOR_474364]. The shippin g cooler will be placed 
into the shippi[INVESTIGATOR_474365]. No more tape 
should be used on the shippi[INVESTIGATOR_474366].  
 
Appropriate shippi[INVESTIGATOR_474367] d on the shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3858], and the 
box will be transported for Overnight Air Priority Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_474368]. The lab members will email the CDC to provide 
the tracking information, and will also request that the CDC confirm receipt 
of the samples and that all samples arrived frozen once the shipment arrives.

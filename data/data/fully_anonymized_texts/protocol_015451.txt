BACKGROUND:  
Lymphocyte activation gene 3 protein (LAG -3) is a transmembrane protein found on activated T and 
natural killer (NK) cells and a key mediator of immune responses. Eftilagimod alfa (efti, eftilagimod  
alpha,  IMP321) is a recombinant soluble human LAG -3Ig fus ion protein which is under development as  
a cancer immunotherapeutic agent. Like endogenous LAG -3, efti  binds to major histocompatibility 
complex (MHC) class II antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells (DCs) and triggers a T 
helper (Th) [ADDRESS_1029033] been/are conducted in the following setting s: efti monotherapy or as part of chemo -
immunotherapy or as part of a combination with PD -1 antagonists  in patients with advanced and/or 
metastatic malignancies or as a vaccine adjuvant in patients with advanced malignancies.  
Pembrolizumab (Brand name: [CONTACT_260792]®, MK -3475) is a potent humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) 
monoclonal antibody (mAb) with high specificity of binding to the programmed cell death 1 (PD -1) 
receptor, thus inhibiting its interaction with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD -L1) and programmed 
cell death ligand 2 (PD -L2). Based on preclinical in vitro data, pembrolizumab has high affini ty and 
potent receptor blocking activity for PD -1. Pembrolizumab has an acceptable preclinical safety profile 
and is in clinical development as an intravenous ( i.v.) immunotherapy for advanced malignancies. 
Keytruda®  (pembrolizumab ) is indicated for the tr eatment of patients across a number of  indications. 
For more details on specific indications refer to the Investigator’s Brochure. Refer to the Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB)/approved labeling for detailed background information on MK -3475.  
STUDY  RATIONALE  
Treatment of advanced solid tumors remains challenging despi[INVESTIGATOR_751714], monoclonal antibodies,  
and immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_751715] -1/PD -L1 and CTLA -[ADDRESS_1029034] been approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) in 
many different solid tumors. In general immune therapi[INVESTIGATOR_751716] 12 % ( ovarian cancer) and 40 % (melanoma, MSI -high) in a high number of solid tumors (i.e. 
NSCLC; small cell lung cancer (SCLC), renal cell cancer (RCC), HNSCC, triple negative breast cancer 
(TNBC), hepatocellular cancer (HCC), gastroesophageal cancer (GEC) and others) (1-6). 
Understanding the reasons why a majority of patients do not respond to PD -1/PD -L1 blockade is key to 
develop ing new therapy combinations. On -treatment tumor biopsies have shown that non -responding 
patients have either little or no tum or-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the tumor bed or a non -
functional immune response (i.e. no intratumoral IFN ) with PD -1/PD -L1 negative TILs (7). Thus, 
immunogenic signals that induce tumor antigen -loaded DCs to escape p eripheral tolerance and better

immunity cycle (8). 
In a mouse model of  
 
. 
In clinical studies with efti it has been shown that efti as an APC activator at a d ose of ≥ 1 mg/injection 
induced a sustained increase in monocyte and dendritic cells blood counts as well as a sustained 
activation of blood monocytes over 6 months. Moreover, this APC activation led to a sustained increase 
of activated CD8 T cells over 6 months and a sustained increase in serum IFN J, a Th1 cytokine.   
In the cross -talk between immune system and cancer, PD- 1 antagonists like pembrolizumab address the 
immune escape (T cell downregulation). On the other hand, the capacity of the immune cells to recognize 
the tumor cells and prime an efficient effector response can be increased by [CONTACT_751750].  
In patients eligible to anti -PD-[ADDRESS_1029035] pembrolizumab in a larger patient population. Based on the complementary mechanism 
of action , the presented preclinical and clinical data  it is believed that the addition of efti to 
pembrolizumab therapy increases the response rates of  pembrolizumab in these indications. Patients will 
be enrolled regardless of their PD-L1 status and tumor samples will be collected and the PD- L1 status 
will be assessed centrally.  
The proposed statistical design (Simon`s 2 stage) ensures that initially a small number of patients is 
exposed to the combination of efti and pembrolizumab.  
STUDY LOCATION  
The study is planned to be conducted in Eur ope (Spain, Ukraine, [LOCATION_008], Poland), United 
States of America and Australia in 20-25 experienced clinical sites.

STUDY DESIGN  
The study is designed according to Simon's optimal two- stage design (9). During the first stage of the 
study the number of N1 patients will be recruited for each indication into this multicenter , open label, 
phase II study.  In case there are more responses than threshold r1 observed in patients recruited in the 
initial stage (N1), additional patients (N2) will be recruited. Following the completion of the initial stage, 
the decision to recruit the additional patients (N2) will be taken by [CONTACT_1578] 
(DMC), as described later.

INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT S, DOSE AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION 
Eftilagimod alfa (efti, eftilagimod alpha, IMP321): 
The efti drug product is a single-use, preservative-free, sterile solution of efti  
 for subcutaneous injections (s.c.) at a concentration of 25  mg/mL. The drug p roduct is 
filled into  mL glass vials with an extractable volume of  mL to be stored at  
. 
Efti will be injected at a dose of [ADDRESS_1029063] 8 cycles (1 cycle = 3 weeks) and every 
3 weeks thereafter  (starting cycle 9) until cycle 18. The maximum number of 22 efti injections may be 
administered ( 18 cycles). Efti is to be given always ≥ 30 minutes after pembrolizumab infusion is 
finished .  
The route of administration for efti will be subcutan eous injection (s.c., single anatomical site) in the 
anterior face of the thigh. The location of the inject ion site should be rotated with each injection and 
alternating left and right thighs (if, for example, the first injection is on the left thigh, the subsequent one 
will be on the right and so on). The injection should be performed slowly to avoid discomfort at the site 
of injection.  
No dose reductions of efti are allowed. Dose delays are allowed and are described in section 6.7.  CCICCICC

Pembrolizumab : 
Pembrolizumab Solution for Infusion 100 mg/vial is a liquid DP. The vials are stored at 2°C to 8°C (36°F 
to 46°F) . The liquid DP is clear to opalescent solution, essentially free of visible particles.  
Pembrolizumab will be given at a dose of 200 mg (flat) as a 30-minute i.v. infusion every 3 weeks. The 
maximum number of 35 pembrolizumab infusions (35 cycles) may be administered. Dose modifications 
and dosing interruptions will be performed as described section 6.7. Pembrolizumab will be provided by 
[CONTACT_456] .   
DURATION OF THE STUDY  
Individual patients will undergo up to  3 weeks screening period, followed by a 54-weeks combination 
treatment phase (18 cycles). Patients who benefit from the treatment may continue with another 51-
weeks of pembrolizumab monotherapy (17 cycles). Three (3)  weeks after the last study drug 
administration an end of treatment visit (EOT) is to be conducted. Patient will be followed- up for 
progression and/or survival  (dependent on patient status at EOT) until PD, death, study end, withdrawal 
of consent or loss to  follow-up, whatever occurs first. 
The timelines are as follows: first patient first visit occurred March 2019. The recruitment time for stage

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
Sample Size Calculation: 
The null hypothesis that the true response rate is [ p0 ] will be tested against a one -sided alternative. In 
the first stage, [ n1 ] patients will be accrued. If th ere are [ r1 ] or fewer responses in these [ n1 ] patients, 
the study will be stopped. Other wise, [ n - n1 ] additional patients will be accrued for a total of [ n ]. The 
null hypothesis will be rejected if [ r2 + 1 ] or more responses are observed in [ n ] patients. This design 
yields a one-sided type I error rate of  and power of  when the true response rate is [ p1 ]. 
Mini -max results of this calculation were used for this clinical trial.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY    Page 19 of 113 The “true response rates ” for 1st line NSCLC were extracted from Keynote-024 and Keynote- 042 under 
consideration that for PD -L1 all comers response rate will be lower (10, 11). For 2nd line NSCLC there 
are no available publications  for pembrolizumab alone in PD-1/PD-L1 refractory patients, but due to the 
confirmation of progression it (p 0) is considered close to 0 % for pembrolizumab alone. The alternative 
(p1) of  % was  considered clinically relevant especially in comparison to available standard 
chemotherapy. For HNSCC relevant publications from Keynote 012 and Keynote-040 were used (2, 12)  
for p 0.  
For part A an extension  (Part A extension) is anticipated based on the ORR of efti in combination with 
pembrolizumab as test group  in a single arm design . The true ORR of monotherapy pembrolizumab in 
NSCLC 1st line is expected to be 23%, whereas a rate of % is expected for the  test group (in case PD -
L1 distribution is as expected from historical studies with ~70%  of patients with <50% TPS PD-
L1expression) . Using these assumptions with a power of % and a one -sided level of significance of 
% in this phase II trial, a sample size of 105 patients would be required for analysis. With a drop -out 
rate of 5%, a total of 110 patients need to be enrolled. With the 36 patients of stages 1 and 2, another 74 
patients would be needed to be enrolled  in total in this extensio n. This sample size is re garded sufficient 
to provide a reasonable precision for the estimate of ORR as basis for sample size considerations for 
further clinical studies.  
Possible extensions of part B and C will be  introduced via substantial amendments.    
Analysis Populations:  
x The Full Analysis Set (FAS) follows the intent to treat principles and includes all assigned patients 
who received at least one dose of study drug (i.e . one dose of either pembrolizumab or efti). This 
population will be the primary population for the analyses of efficacy endpoints and baseline 
characteristics.  
x The safety set is defined analogously to the full analysis set and includes all assigned patients who 
received at least one dose of study drug (i.e . one dose of either pembrolizumab or efti ). This 
population will be the primary population for the analyses of safety. 
x In addition, a per protocol population and a PK population are defined.    
Baseline and Demographic Characteristics:  
Baseline characteristics and demographic information at baseline will be summarized with descriptive 
statistics for each part of the study independently. Medications will be coded using the most current 
version of the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug d ictionary and will be summarized as treated 
for all patients in the safety population. Prior medications, medications used at study and concomitant 
medications will be described separately.  
Safety Analysis:  
Safety data will be summarized for the safety population. The baseline value for safety analysis is defined 
as the value collected at the time closest to and prior to the start of any study drug administration. The 
number and percentage of patients with at  least 1 AE will be summarized by [CONTACT_751754]. AEs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_751755] (i.e., either efti or 
pembrolizumab ). Vital signs, 12-lead ECG variables, body weight, and safety laboratory par ameters will 
be presented (each time point and changes from base line) using descriptive statistics (mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum, and maximum). Other safety data will be summarized and/or listed.

As a sensitivity analysis ORR, DOR, PFS will be assessed based on RECIST 1.1. All efficacy analyses 
are based on local investigator assessments. A central independent assessment will be conducted , 
respective analyses will be specified in the SAP.  
For indications with an extension, the patients of stages 1 and 2 will be combined with the newly e nrolled 
patients of the extension as combined dataset for anal ysis. Certain endpoints will in addition be analyzed

after efti injection . The following windows are permitted on the assessment time points for PK: up to 1 hour for the PRE -dose assessment, ±5 minutes for the 1-hour assessment, 
±15 minutes for the 2 hour and 4-hour assessments, ±30 minutes for the 8-hour assessments , ±2 hours for the 24 , 48-hour assessments  and -4 hours or up to +48 hours window  
for the 72 and 96-hour timepoint s. 
12. Blood samples for assessment of poten tial anti -efti ADA s will always be collected pre -dose of efti and pembrolizumab administration day 1 of cycle 1, day 8 of cycle 2, day 
15 of cycle 3, day 1 of cycle 5, day 1 of cycle 9, day 1 of cycle 13, EOC and EOT.  
13. Blood samples for Th1 biomarker assessment will be collected for all patients  on day 1 of Cycle 1, Cycle 5, Cycle 9 , Cycle 13 , End of Combo (EOC)  and EOT prior to dosing 
with Pembrolizumab  and/or efti. In subset s of patients with PK assessment, Th1 biomarkers will be additionall y assessed in selected samples collected as part of PK assessment 
after dosing at cycle 1, cycle 5 and cycle 9  (no additional blood sampling needed) . 
14. Eftilagimod alfa (efti,  eftilagimod alpha,  IMP321)  administration will be every 2 weeks  until week 23. Thereafter efti will be administered every 3 weeks until week 52 (starting 
week 25). Patients must  stay for 30 minutes at the site after each efti administration. The combined immunotherapy of pembrolizu mab and efti requires on several occasions 
that both treatments will be given on the same day. In these cases, efti will be given ≥ [ADDRESS_1029067] study treatment . SAEs 
(pregnancy or breastfeeding) will be recorded from the time of informed consent until 90 (120) after last study drug treatmen t. In case patients receive s ubsequent antitumor

for each AE, SAE or ECI . 
16. Additionally, any  next line of anti -cancer therapy and the outcome will be recorded.  
17. At end of combination (EoC) therapy visit will be performed three (3) weeks ±[ADDRESS_1029068] combination treatment (cycle 18)  in case the patient continues on 
pembrolizumab monotherapy . 
18. Patients who discontinue the treatment phase prior to regular EOT have an EOT visit within 3 weeks (±7 days) after discontinu ation or their last study drug administration.  
19. Progression free survival follow -up will be performed every 12 weeks  ±[ADDRESS_1029069] radiological scan under treatment and then 
every 12 weeks thereafter. PFS -FU is to be conducted until confirmed PD (iCPD), study end or any other reason, whatever occurs first.  
20. Overall survival follow -up will  be performed every 12 weeks  ±[ADDRESS_1029070] visit of the treatment phase (if not EOT 
took place), EOT or PFS -FU whatever was last. OS -FU is to be conducted until study end, death, withdrawal of consent or lost to follow -up whatever occurs first.  
21. Autoantibodies (i.e. antimitochondrial antibodies, rheumatoid factor, antithyroid (antithyroglobulin) antibodies, and antinuclear antibodies ) will be evaluated at the local 
laboratory  
22. Patient can be consented up to 35 days before cycle 1 day 1 to allow planning of fresh tumor biopsy  and/or perform CT scan for assessment of eligibility at screening  (the latter 
for Part B only) . All screening assessments including the biopsy or confirmatory tumor assessment for part B (to confirm progression) itself are still to be performed between 
-21 days and -1. 
23. Thyroid function tests (Triiodothyronine (T3) or Free Triiodothyronine (FT3), Fre e thyroxine (FT4) and Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)) are to be performed up to [ADDRESS_1029071] will also be performed at E oT.

 3 INTRODUCTION  
The information given in this section is an overview of the pre -clinical and clinical development program 
for eftilagimod alfa (efti,  eftilagimod alpha,  IMP321 ) and pembrolizumab  to date that underpin the 
proposed Phase II clinical study. Further specific and more detailed information is provided in the 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for efti. The IB will be updated at regular intervals and whenever new safety 
relevant data become available.  
 
3.1. Standard Treatment Options  
3.1.1.  Advanced n on-small cell lung cancer  (NSC LC) 
Almost 800.000 new cases of NSCLC are reported worldwide every year accounting for approximately 
85 % of all lung cancers (13). NSCLC can be divided into adeno -, large cell and squamous cell carcinoma 
representing approximately 50 -60 %, 30 -40 % and 2 -10 % with diff erences between the regions.  
NSCLC is the indication leading to the most cancer related death worldwide as it is mostly diagnosed 
relatively late. In the US approximately 180.000 new cases were recorded in 2015 (13). The 5 -year survival 
rate published by [CONTACT_751758] 2017 for patients with stage IIIA NSCLC is about 36 %. 
For stage IIIB cancers the survival rate is about 26 %. F or stage IIIC cancers the survival rate is about 13 %. 
(14). Approximately 41 % are diagnosed with stage IVA with a 5 -year survival rate of ~ 10 % or stage IVB 
with a survival rate of <1 % (13).  
3.1.2.  1st line NSCLC   
Treatment of NSCLC is dependent on histological subtypes (squamous vs. non -squamous) and presence of 
EGFR, BRAF, ALK or ROS1 mutations. Patients with actionable mutations (10 -20 % of all NSCLC 
patients (15)) will receive targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_751721], depending on the mutation 
(16).  
Patients with >50 % programmed death ligand 1 ( PD-L1) expression and non -squamous NSCLC can be 
treated with the  programmed death 1  (PD-1) blocking antibody pembrolizumab as first line therapy (16). 
In the Keynote -024 study an objective response rate (ORR) of 45 %, media n progression free survival (PFS) 
of 10.3 and median overall survival (OS) of 30 months were reported (10). These results were confirmed 
in the Keynote -[ADDRESS_1029081] line NSCLC patients with either squamous or non-
squamous disease and PD -L1 expression of >1 % (17). The response rate for pembrolizumab in this patient 
population was reported with 27 %  (11).  
For patients not amenable to treatment with therapi[INVESTIGATOR_751722] (based on the performance status) platinum -based doublet chemotherapy in 
combination with pemetrexed. The ORR of platinum plus pemetr exed was reported with 28 %. The median 
PFS was 6 months (10).  
Just recently at American association for Cancer Research (AACR) congress April 2018, results from the 
Keynote -189 trial were reported f or the combination of platinum -based chemotherapy plus pemetrexed ± 
pembrolizumab (18) in first line non -squamous NSCLC patients. An ORR of 47.6 % compared to 18.9 %, 
and overall survival hazard ratio ( HR) of 0.49 was reported regardless of PD -L1 expression. The 
combination of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45762] (CTLA -4 and PD -1 antagonists) also repo rted superior efficacy 
(median PFS of 7.2 months) compared to chemotherapy (median PFS of 5.5 months) in a large Phase III 
trial, in NSCLC patients with high tumor mutational burden (19). Pembrolizumab has been submitted for 
registration for the patient population investigated in Keynote -[ADDRESS_1029082] line treatment of

chemotherapy . 
3.1.3.  2nd line NSCLC  
Although it is difficult to estimate the proportion of NSCLC patients receiving 2nd line therapy , it was about 
40-50 % in recent clinical trials (20). Single agent chemotherapy was the mainstay for long. Docetaxel, a 
widely used single agent chemotherapy, results in a ORR of 9 -12 %, a median PFS of about 4 months,  and 
a median OS of about 9 months (21, 22) . Different PD -1/PD -L1 targeting therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (pembrolizumab, 
nivolumab or atezolizumab ) are approved and recommended for monotherapy for different 2nd line NSCLC 
subsets. In PD -X naïve (having not received  any PD -[ADDRESS_1029083]) 2nd line patients with non -
squamous NSCLC and PD -L1 expression >1 % pembrolizumab at doses of 2 or 10  mg/kg led an ORR of 
18 %, a median PFS of ~4 months and a median OS of 10.4 -12.7 months (3). Nivolumab obtained 
comparable results with ORR of 19  %, median PFS of 2.[ADDRESS_1029084] line 
chemother apy.  
The majority of patients with metastatic NSCLC will progress and ultimately succumb to their disease. 
Based on the results published at AACR 2018 it is assumed that shortly the clear majority  of patients not 
amenable to ALK/EGFR targeted therapy will receive a PD -X antibody in the first line setting. Therefore, 
new treatment regimens for 1st line in combination with an anti -PD-1 antibody and for PD -X refractory 2nd 
line NSCLC are needed to imp rove clinical benefit in this incurable setting.  
3.1.4.  Recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer  
Worldwide about half a million new cases of head and neck cancer (HNC) are reported every year. For the 
US 58.115 cases were reported for 2016 with an anticipat ed annual growth rate of approximately 1.5 % for 
the next decade. Initial treatment options for stage I -III are, if feasible, surgery and/or radiation therapy 
together with adjuvant regimes. If the cancer is non -resectable, chemoradiotherapy is offered as standard 
of care.  
HNC has a recurrence rate of 20 -50 % depending on the stage of diagnosis and is responsible for about 
300.000 death per year worldwide (23, 24) . The treatment paradigm for HNC is schematically depi[INVESTIGATOR_3075] 1.

3.2. Eftilagimod alfa 
Eftilagimod al fa (efti,  eftilagimod alpha,  IMP321)  consists of the extracellular portion of the human LAG -
3 protein (27, 28)  fused to the Fc fraction of a human IgG1 ( Figure 2). This soluble LAG -3Ig fusion protein, 
like the membrane form of LAG -3 naturally  expressed on human T cells, binds to Major Histocompatibility 
Complex (MHC) class II molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APC) and promotes the 
activation, maturation and chemokine secretion of APC (29-35). Efti is a first -in-class APC activator.  
 
 
Figure 2: Diagrammatic structure of efti (IMP321) , a first -in-class APC activator  
 
APC such as dendritic cells (DC) and monocytes/ macrophages form a network in tissues. Following a 
“danger signal” (e.g., local infection/ tumor ) DC capture non -self-microbial / oncogenic proteins, digest 
these proteins into immunogenic peptides, migrate to the draining lymph nodes a few centimeters  away and 
present these peptides to CD4 and CD8 T -lymphocytes. The binding of efti to MHC class II leads to APC 
activation/ expansio n with enhanced presentation of tumor  antigens to T -cells. As a result, strong and 
sustained anti -tumor  cytotoxic T -cell responses are obtained. This natural process is made even more 
effective when efti is given the day after chemotherapy at a time when A PC are fully loaded by [CONTACT_751760].

As already mentioned above, LAG-3 is a membrane protein associated with the T-cell receptor on the 
surface of activated T cells, which binds to MHC class II molecules on the surface of APC (28, 34, 36-38) 
and promotes the activation, maturation and chemokine secretion of human DC (31-33). In addition, a 
natural soluble form of the LAG-3 molecule (sLAG-3), is found in normal sera and has been shown to be 
a good prognostic factor as a Th1 marker in tuberculosis and breast cancer.  
Immune checkpoint pathways strongly downregulate T-cell activation with the intent of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_751724]

3.3. Pembro lizumab  
Pembrolizumab  is a potent humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (mAb) with high 
specificity of binding to the programmed cell death 1 ( PD-1) receptor, thus inhibiting its interaction with 
programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD -L1) and programmed cell death ligand  2 (PD -L2). Based on preclinical 
in vitro data, pembrolizumab has high affinity and potent receptor blocking activity for PD -1. 
Pembrol izumab has an acceptable preclinical safety profile and is in clinical development as an intravenous 
(i.v.) immunotherapy for advanced malignancies. Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) is indicated for the treatment 
of patients across a number of indications. For mo re details on specific indications refer to the Investigator’s

3.3.1.  Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background  
The importance of intact immune  surveillance function in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformations has been known for decades . Accumulating evidence shows a correlation between tumor -
infiltrating lymphocytes in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in various malignancies. In  particular, the 
presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector T -cells/FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells (T -regs) 
correlates with improved prognosis and long -term survival in solid malignancies, such as ovarian, 
colorectal, and pancreatic cancer; hepatoc ellular carcinoma; malignant melanoma; and renal cell carcinoma. 
Tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes can be expanded ex vivo  and reinfused, inducing durable objective tumor 
responses in cancers such as melanoma  (42).

Clinical Trial Protocol v5.0, final; [ADDRESS_1029098] hijacked by [CONTACT_44857]. 
The normal function of PD-1, expressed on the cell su rface of activated T-cells under healthy conditions, 
is to down-modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including autoimmune reactions. PD-1 
(encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1 ) is an immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily member related to cluster of 
differentiation 28 (CD28) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-as sociated protein 4 (CTLA-4) that has been shown 
to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD-L1 and/or PD-L2) 
(43). 
The structure of murine PD-1 has been resolved. PD-1 and its family members are type I transmembrane 
glycoproteins containing an Ig-variable –type (IgV-type) domain responsible for ligand binding and a 
cytoplasmic tail responsible for the binding of signaling molecules. The cytoplasmic tail of PD-1 contains 
2 tyrosine-based signaling motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif, and an 
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif. Followi ng T-cell stimulation, PD-1 recruits the tyrosine 
phosphatases, SHP-1 and SHP-2, to the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif within its cytoplasmic 
tail, leading to the dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3 zeta (CD3 ζ), protein kinase C -theta 
(PKCθ), and zeta -chain-associated protein kinase (ZAP70), whic h are involved in the CD3 T-cell signaling 
cascade (43, 44). The mechanism by [CONTACT_13209]-[ADDRESS_1029099]

As a consequence, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is an attr active target for therapeutic intervention in NSCLC 
and HNSCC .  
3.3.2.  Pre-clinical and Clinical Data 
Therapeutic studies in mouse models have shown that  administration of antibodies blocking PD-1/PD-L1 
interaction enhances infiltration of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells and ultimately leads to tumor rejection, 
either as a monotherapy or in combination with other treatment modalities (47-53). Anti-mouse PD-[ADDRESS_1029100] demonstrated an titumor responses in models of squamous cell 
carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, melanoma, acute myeloid leukemia, and colorectal carcinoma (50, 52-
55). In such studies, tumor infiltration by [CONTACT_398]8+ T cells and increased interferon (IFN)- γ, granzyme B and 
perforin expression were observed, indicating that the mechanism underlying the antitumor activity of PD-
1 checkpoint inhibition involved local infiltration and activation of effector T cell function in vivo  (52). 
Experiments have confirmed the in vivo  efficacy of anti-mouse PD-1 antibody as a monotherapy, as well 
as in combination with chemotherapy, in syngeneic mouse tumor models (see the IB).

Understanding the reasons why a majority of patients does not respond to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade is key to 
develop new therapy combinations. On-treatment tumor biopsies have shown that non-responding patients 
have either little or no tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the tumor bed or a non-functional immune 
response (i.e. no intratumoral IFN J) with PD-1/PD-L1 negative TILs (7). Thus, immunogenic signals that 
induce tumor antigen-loaded DCs to escape peripheral  tolerance and better prime and activate effector 
T cells are expected to reactivate the deficient early steps of the cancer-immunity cycle (8, 56). 
In a mouse model of  
 
 
In clinical studies with efti it has been shown that efti as an APC activator at a dose of ≥ 1 mg/injection 
induced a sustained increase in monocyte and dendritic cells blood counts as well as a sustained activation 
of blood monocytes over 6 months. Moreover, this APC activation led to a sustained increase of activated 
CD8 T cells over 6 months and a sustained increase in serum IFN J, a Th1 cytokine.   
In the crosstalk between immune system and cancer, PD-1 antagonists like pembrolizumab address the 
immune escape (T cell downregulation). On the other hand, the capacity of the immune cells to recognize 
the tumor cells and prime an efficient effector response can be increased by [CONTACT_751750].  
In patients eligible to anti-PD-1 therapy, the addition of a well-tolerated APC activator like efti may help 
to activate the cellular immune response mechanisms to mediate tumor recognition and killing and thus 
may lead to higher frequency of durable responses compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy in different solid tumor without adding substantial toxicity.

In both dose finding trials (P011 – AIPAC, P012 – TACTI-mel) cytokine levels were closely monitored 
after the first and 12th injection of efti. No increase of  have been observed at any dose

) have been reported fro m both trials at different dose levels (1-30 mg) of efti but these 
serum concentrations levels were too low to induce sy stemic reactions such as fever. Vital signs and other 
parameters are closely and frequently monitored during clinical trials with efti.  
Transient injection site reactions (including skin chan ges e.g. erythema, pain and induration) of mild and 
moderate intensity have been reported from all trials.  
Details on management of efti related adve rse reaction are discussed in Section 6.7.1. 
In studies P003 and P005, no ADAs were detected in the serum of patients even after [ADDRESS_1029102]-treatment start) and P011 (  patients tested post -
treatment start) and are further investigated. To evalua te this risk, the relationship between the therapeutic 
protein and endogenous LAG-3 (a co-inhibitory recept or expressed on activated  T cells) should be 
considered. If ADAs are induced in metastatic breast cancer patients and if a significant fraction of these 
ADAs are neutralizing antibodies, the function of the endogenous LAG-3 receptor expressed on activated 
effector T cells and on Treg cells will be blocked. Consequently, the anti-tumor cellular responses of these 
patients would be increased due to immune checkpoint blockade. This could lead to additional clinical 
benefit for cancer patients which outweighs the risks of immune-related adverse events (irAEs).  
Generally speaking, irAEs have been reported after the blocking of inhibitory receptors (CTLA-4, PD-1) 
expressed on T cells but not after stimulation of AP Cs (TLR8 or TLR9 agonists, anti-CD40 agonist mAb). 
So far, no irAEs have been observed. However, occurrence of irAEs cannot be excluded, especially when more patients are treated, potentially including patients predisposed to autoimmune reactions.  
The rationale to combine pembrolizumab and efti comes from its complementary mechanism of action. Efti 
activates APCs and

In this study, efti will be combined wi th pembrolizumab. The

Based on the RSD, Pembrolizumab is well tolerated in the approved indications, as evidenced by a low rate

related AEs  %). Furthermore, the frequency of immune -mediated adverse events of special interest is CCICCI

Pembrolizumab provided substantial, clinically meaningful benefits in terms of prolonged OS and PFS, and 
increased ORR in patients with NSCLC who progressed after platin um-containing chemotherapy and 
whose tumor cells expressed PD -L1. In previously treated patients with PD -L1 expression ≥1  % and disease 
progression following platinum -containing chemotherapy, pembrolizumab provided a statistically 
significant and clinicall y meaningful OS benefit compared to standard docetaxel chemotherapy.  
For patients with previously untreated metastatic NSCLC whose tumors expressed high (≥ 50 %) levels of 
PD-L1, pembrolizumab demonstrated significant improvements in PFS and OS over stand ard of care 
chemotherapy. For patients with previously untreated squamous or non -squamous NSCLC with ≥1  % 
PD-L1 expression pembrolizumab increased the overall survival significantly. Pembrolizumab in 
combination with pemetrexed/carboplatin for the first -line treatment of metastatic non -squamous NSCLC 
demonstrated both a statistically significant and clinically meaningful difference in ORR and a statistically 
significant benefit in PFS compared with pemetrexed/carboplatin alone.  
In the treatment of advanced  HNSCC after platinum based first line chemotherapy, pembrolizumab 
demonstrated a clinically meaningful ORR of ~15  % and a prolonged duration of response that was 
substantially distinct from what is expected with standard of care (i.e. methotrexate with ~ 8 % ORR) in 
previously treated patients with HNSCC. However, a treatment benefit of pembrolizumab over standard of 
care for overall survival has not been confirmed.  
Efti has shown antitumor activity in combination with paclitaxel (P005 and P011) and in co mbination with 
pembrolizumab (P012) in MBC and metastatic melanoma patients with suboptimal response to 
pembrolizumab alone, respectively . 
The principal aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of efti in combination with 
pembrolizumab in patients with: advanced/metastatic  treatment naive  NSCLC (1st line) (Part A), advanced 
recurrent PD -X refractory NSCLC after failure of 1st line PD-X containing therapy (Part B), and HNSCC 
after failure of prior platinum -containing 1st line therapy (Part C). The patients intended to be enrolled have 
no curative treatment options and especially for 2nd line NSCLC and 2nd line HNSCC there are only very 
limited treatm ent options (see section  3.1). Pembrolizumab monotherapy is approved f or 1st line NSCLC 
patients with ≥50 % PD -L1 positivity  and for ≥2nd line NSCLC patients progressing on (platinum 
containing) chemotherapy and with ≥1% PD -L1 positivity by [CONTACT_16096] , FDA  and TGA  and for 2nd line HNSCC 
patients by [CONTACT_751767] . Efti injected s.c. every 2 weeks up to 30 mg has shown to be well tolerated 
in pati ents with advanced cancer in combination with chemotherapy or pembrolizumab. The dose finding 
was based on the preclinical and clinical data.  
Furthermore, this trial will help to identify patients who may especially benefit from the combination of 
efti and pembrolizumab as different biomarkers (PD -L1 expression, gene expression profile  acc. to 
PanCancer Immune code, circulating level of Th1 biomarkers) will be assessed and analyzed  under the 
current protocol.  
The anticipated risks are based on efti and pembrolizumab non -clinical and clinical experience. Patients 
will be treated at well trained sites and with an emergency unit under the supervision of investigators 
experienced with the use of checkpoint therapi[INVESTIGATOR_751729].  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_376094] -[ADDRESS_1029104] populations under 
investigation, the risk benefit assessment does not change . 
In summary it is considered that the combination of pembrolizumab and efti has an acceptable risk/benefit 
profile. T he expected benefit outweighs the expected risks for the patients.

 5 STUDY DESIGN  
The study is designed according to Simon's optimal two -stage design (9). During the first stage of the study 
the number of N1 patients will be recruited for each indication into this multicenter , open label, phase II 
study.  In case there are more responses than threshold r1 observed in patients recruited in the initial stage 
(N1), additional patients (N2) will be recruited. Following the completion of the initial stage, the decision 
to recruit the additional patients (N2) will be taken by [CONTACT_1578] (DMC), as described 
later.

In case ORR in any part meets a predefined threshold an extension of this cohort may be set up to combine 
the patients of stages 1 , 2, and newly enrolled patients in that respective part, to provide a reasonable basis 
in sample size considerations for further clinical studies. For sample size considerations in the extension 
phase please refer to the section "sample size calculations" in the synopsis and chapter [ADDRESS_1029107] either:  
Part A:  Histologically - or cytologically -confirmed diagnosis of non -small cell lung cancer stage IIIB not 
amenable to curative treatment (unresectable) or stage IV not amenable to EGFR/ALK based therapy, 
treatment naïve for advanced/me tastatic disease.  
Note: Patients who received durvalumab or any other PD -1 or PD -L1 therapy as maintenance therapy to 
the adjuvant chemotherapy regimen and hence are not naïve to anti -PD-X agents, can be recruited provided 
that all other necessary require ments are met.  
Part B:  Histologically - or cytologically -confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC after failure of first-line treatment 
(for metastatic /advanced  disease) with at least 2 cycles of any PD -1/PD -L1 therapy (e. g. nivolumab, 
pembrolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab , etc.) alone, or in combination with any other immunotherapeutic 
or chemotherapy  given as part of first -line treatment  
Note: Failure on therapy is defined as progress acc. to RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1029108] documented PD in the absence of rapid clinical 
progression . If patients discontinue PD -1/PD -L1 after being treated for at least 2 cycles  for reasons other 
than progression , they may enrol l in the study if initial progression occurs within 12 weeks after end of PD -
1/PD -L1 therapy and progression is confirmed . Only patients to be receiving treatment in true second -line 
setting can be enrolle d to Part B . Patients who have received durvalumab or any other PD -1 or PD -L1 
therapy as part of their adjuvant therapy and no other PD -1/PD -L1 therapy in the first line treatment are 
not eligible for Part B.  
Note: In Parts A and B patients with neuroendoc rine or sarcomatoid NSCLC tumor types are not eligible. 
Patients with undifferentiated lung carcinoma with some neuroendocrine features can be recruited.  
Part C:  Histologically - or cytologically -confirmed recurrent disease not amenable to curative treatment 
with local or systemic therapy, or metastatic (disseminated) HNSCC of the oral cavity, oropharynx,

three weeks s.c. therea fter (cycle 9 to 18); 1 cycle = 3 weeks  
 
Figure 4: Study flow chart for part A, B and C.  
 
Screening of patients for eligibility to enter this study will be done in the three weeks prior to cycle [ADDRESS_1029110] 1 week apart. A patient  will stay on treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, 
completion of 35 cycles of pembrolizumab (~2 yrs.; completion of study treatment)  or discontinuation for 
any other reason . Three (3) weeks after  the end of the combination therapy (cycle 18) end of combination 
(EOC) therapy assessments will be performed. Three (3) weeks after end of any study treatment (cycle 35) 
an end of treatment (EOT) visit will be performed. Upon start of study treatment, patient s will be followed 
for PFS and OS. PFS will be radiologically assessed at the study sites until progressive disease (PD), death, 
withdrawal of consent, loss to follow -up, or until the end of the study, whichever occurs first. Radiological 
assessment will b e performed at intervals of 9 weeks until week 36 (week 9, 18, 27, 36) and every 12 weeks 
thereafter (after week 36). OS will be monitored until death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow -up or 
until the end of the study, whichever occurs first. Measurab ility will be assessed according to iRECIST. 
Response to treatment and treatment decisions will be assessed according to iRECIST. Objective response 
(iPR, iCR) should be confirmed by a repeat imaging assessment at least [ADDRESS_1029111] unconfirmed disease progression (iUPD) should stay on 
treatment (if clinically stable) until progression i s confirmed (iCPD), provided they have met the conditions 
detailed in Section 8.1.3 .  
Radiological scans and related information will be evaluated at the study sites for treatment decision and 
for primary objective  and will be collected for potential later central evaluation by [CONTACT_751752].

5.1. DMC Review  
The DMC will review the available safety data of all patients (part A -C) after [ADDRESS_1029113] two cycles (6 weeks) of therapy. In addition, the DMC will review the efficacy and safe ty data after 
the last patient N1 has been enrolled or the minimum number of responses is reached for each part of the 
study, whatever is first. Patients included in this decision must have had at least one tumor imaging after 
treatment was initiated. The DMC will give a recommendation for each part of the study if stage 2 or an 
extension can be opened independently. Further details are described in the DMC charter.  
Furthermore, the DMC will monitor safety and efficacy data at regular intervals and in accordance with the 
DMC charter. The DMC may recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/changing the study if at any time during the trial there 
are unacceptable adverse events or safety concerns. Unless immediate action is required to protect the safety 
and well -being of study p atients, the sponsor will consult with appropriate regulatory authorities prior to 
early termination of the study based on any DMC recommendation.

recording, noncompliance or unsatisfactory enrolment with respect to quality or quantity and decision by 
[CONTACT_364798], evaluation, or de velopment of the product.  
Patient safety will be monitored at study level (within the DMC) and on substance level (Immutep safety 
monitoring board). The recommendation of the above committees will be taken into consideration in such 
decisions of the Sponso r. The Investigator s will be notified by [CONTACT_751768]. The relevant Independent Ethics Committees  (IEC) / Institutional  Review Board s (IRB)

Therefore, dosing was primarily based on pharmacodynamic parameters

Thus, efti should be injected s.c. at a dose level of 30 mg. 
 
5.5. Justification for Dose of pembrolizumab 
The planned dose of pembrolizumab for this study is 200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W). Based on the totality 
of data generated in the Keytruda development program, 200 mg Q3W is the appropriate dose of 
pembrolizumab for adults across all indications and regardless of tumor type. As outlined below, this dose 
is justified by: 
x Clinical data from 8 randomized studies demo nstrating flat dose- and exposure-efficacy 
relationships from 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W),  
x Clinical data showing meaningful improvement in be nefit-risk including overall survival at 200 mg 
Q3W across multiple indications, and 
x Pharmacology data showing full target saturation in both systemic circulation (inferred from PK 
data) and tumor (inferred from physiologically-based PK (PBPK) analysis) at 200 mg Q3W. 
Among the 8 randomized dose-comparison studies, a total of 2262 patients were enrolled with melanoma 
and NSCLC, covering different disease settings (treatment naïve, previously treated, PD-L1 enriched, and 
all-comers) and different treatment settings (monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy). Five studies compared 2 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W (KN001 Cohort B2, KN001 Cohort D, KN002, 
KN010, and KN021), and 3 studies compared 10 mg/ kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W (KN001 Cohort B3, 
KN001 Cohort F2 and KN006). All of these studies demonstrated flat dose- and exposure-response 
relationships across the doses studied representing an approximate 5- to 7.5-fold difference in exposure. 
The 2 mg/kg (or 200 mg fixed-dose) Q3W provided similar responses to the highest doses studied. 
Subsequently, flat dose-exposure-response relationships  were also observed in other tumor types including 
head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer, and classical Hodgkin Lymphoma, confirming [ADDRESS_1029117], PK data in KN001 
evaluating target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) conclusively demonstrated saturation of PD-[ADDRESS_1029118] tumor PD-1 saturation over a wide range of tumor penetration and PD-1 expression. This evaluation concluded that pembrolizumab at 200 mg Q3W achieves full PD-1 saturation in both blood and tumor. 
Finally, population PK analysis of pembrolizumab, which characterized the influence of body weight and 
other patient covariates on exposure, has shown that  the fixed-dosing provides similar control of PK 
variability as weight-based dosing, with considerable overlap in the distribution of exposures from the 
200 mg Q3W fixed dose and 2 mg/kg Q3W dose. Supporte d by [CONTACT_751770] -002

No dose modifications for efti are allowed.  
On days pembrolizumab and efti are given the same day (e.g. cycle  1 day 1), i n case there is an adverse 
event after pembrolizumab administration which necessitates delay of efti administration, efti 
administration can be delayed up to 72 hours after end of pembr olizumab  infusion . If the recovery  (as 
described below) occurs more tha n 72 hours after end of pembr olizumab  administration, then the efti 
administration will be  omitted. Next treatment of efti will then occur at the next planned injection of efti in 
case adverse events improved as described in the next paragraph .  
On days efti is given alone, i n case during the study there is an adverse event which necessitates delay (but 
not discontinuation) of efti administration, then the medical monitor should be informed, and efti should be 
delayed until the patient has recovered to ≤ grade 1, except for isolated laboratory values abnormalities 
which should recover to ≤ grade [ADDRESS_1029143] your me dical monitor in such cases. All grade

6.7.2.  Pembrolizumab  
Dose modification and toxicity management for immune -related AEs  
AEs associated with pembrolizumab exposure may represent an immunologic etiology. These immune -
related AEs (irAEs) may occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the last dose of 
pembrolizumab treatment and may affect more than on body system simultaneously. Therefore, early 
recognition and initiation of treatment is critical to reduce complications. Based on existing clinical study 
data, most irAEs were reversible and could be managed with interruptions of pembrolizumab, 
administration of corticosteroids and/or other supportive care. For suspected irAEs, ensure adequate 
evalua tion to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Additional procedures or tests such as 
bronchoscopy, endoscopy, skin biopsy may be included as part of the evaluation. Based on the severity of 
irAEs, withhold or permanently discontinue pembrolizumab and a dminister corticosteroids. Dose 
modification and toxicity management guidelines for irAEs associated with pembrolizumab are provided 
in Table 8.  
In ca se pembrolizumab needs to be discontinued due to safety reasons, patients who have completed at least 
four infusions of pembrolizumab are allowed to switch to efti treatment only. Investigator must ask the 
medical monitor beforehand.

 6.8. Other allowed dose interruption for study treatment  
Pembrolizumab and/or efti may be interrupted for situations other than treatment -related AEs such as 
medical / surgical events or logistical reasons (e.g. COVID -19) not related to study therapy. Medical 
Monitor must be consulted  prior to the event to discu ss the best option for each patient. Patients should be 
placed back on study treatment within 3 weeks of the scheduled interruption, unless otherwise discussed 
with the Medical Monitor . The reason for interruption  and missed doses  should be documented in t he 
patient's study record.  The maximum number of interruptions  and missed doses  per patient before non -
compliance is reached is described in section 6.11.  
 
6.9. Rescue  Medications & Supportive Care  
Patient s should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_124133]. Suggested supportive care measures for the management of AEs with potential immunologic 
etiology are outlined alon g with the dose modification guidelines in Section above. Where appropriate, 
these guidelines include the use of oral or i.v. treatment with corticosteroids, as well as additional anti -
inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with administration of c orticosteroids. Note that several 
courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. 
For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial 
or viral i nfection, which might require additional supportive care. The treatment guidelines are intended to 
be applied when the investigator determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab  and/or efti.  
Note: If after the evaluation of the event, it is determi ned not to be related to pembrolizumab  and/or efti, 
the investigator does not need to follow the treatment guidance.  
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin 
photography as part of evaluation of the ev ent.  
 
6.10. Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria (including the timeframe 
mentioned there) are not allowed during the ongoing trial. If there is a clinical indication for any medication 
or vaccination specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may 
be required. The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with the Medical Monitor.  The 
final decision on any support ive therapy or vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the patient's 
primary physician. However, the decision to continue the patient on study treatment requires the mutual 
agreement of the investigator, the Sponsor and the patient.  
Listed below are  specific restrictions for concomitant therapy or vaccination during the course of the study:  
• Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy  
• Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol  
• Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol  
• Investigational agents other than pembrolizumab and/or efti 
• Radiation therapy Note: Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion or to the brain may be 
allowed at the investigator’s discretion.  
• Live vaccines within [ADDRESS_1029155] dose of IMP . Examples of live vaccines include, but are not 
limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and

 typhoid vacci ne. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and 
are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines 
and are not allowed.  
• Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other tha n (1) to modulate symptoms from an AE that is 
suspected to have an immunologic etiology  or (2) to treat an AE of not immunologic etiology, only 
for a short course (i.e. no longer than 10 days) and if that is in line with the site’s SOC . Inhaled or 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_751718] 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents 
are permitted in the absence of active auto -immune disease.  In case of doubt, the study Medical 
Monitor should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
Patients who, in the assessment of the inv estigator, require the use of any of the aforementioned treatments 
for clinical management should be removed from the study  treatment .  
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a patient’s welfare may be administered at the 
discretion o f the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_77981].  
Acceptable concomitant therapy is defined as follows:  
• Patients may receive supportive care including but not limited to antibiotics, analgesics, transfusion 
of blood products, anti -diarrheal medication or laxatives according to local clinical practice and the 
approved pembrolizumab  label.  
• Growth factors (such  as filgrastim) are allowed a minimum of 2 days after efti or pembrolizumab  
administration  
• Vaccination  (e.g. influenza, COVID -19) with any non -live vaccine (e.g. Vector based, mRNA 
based) is allowed if it takes place more than 3 days prior to or after any efti or pembrolizumab 
administration. Live attenuated vaccines cannot be used.  
• Bisphosphonates and RANK -targeted therapy as clinically indicated.  
• Patients receiving opi[INVESTIGATOR_751735].  
• Inhaled or topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826].  
• Acute surgery or elective (pre -planned) surgical procedures with non -oncological intent.  
All concomitant medication will be recorded on the eCRF including all prescription, over -the-counter 
(OTC) products, herbal supplements, and  i.v. medications and fluids. If changes occur during the study 
period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, and date should also be included on the eCRF.  
Prior chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant, first line), targeted small molecule, anti -cancer monoclonal 
antibody or other systemic investigational drug therapy to treat the cancer disease including but not limited 
to are allowed in respective time window s defined in the inclusion and exclusion criteria and is to be 
recorded in the eCRF.  
Prior high -dose chemotherapy requiring hematopoietic stem cell rescue or chemotherapy for metastatic 
disease is not permitted.  
All concomitant medications received within  [ADDRESS_1029156] (ECIs) 
as defined in section  9.3.  
The medical monitor should always be contact[CONTACT_751779] t

6.11. Treatment Compliance 
Patients are expected to receive both intravenous pembrolizumab infusion and subcutaneous injections of 
efti as per protocol schedule within the allowable time window (see section 6.7). 
In the event a patient misses a dose, the Investigator must contact [CONTACT_751780] . Any subsequent dose should then be given according 
to the previous schedule as outlined in section 6.7.  
Patients who miss more than a total of 3 (2) injections of efti (pembrolizumab) within the first 8 cycles or 
a total of more than 5 (5) doses of efti (pembrolizum ab) in total until cycle end of combo treatment (end of 
cycle 18) will be regarded as treatment non-compliant. Patients will need to end the treatment. An end of treatment (EOT) visit will be performed. The patients should then continue with PFS (if not progressed) or 
OS follow-up (if progressed or receiving another therapy). 
 
6.12. Drug accountability 
Investigators must maintain accurate records regarding the receipt, dispensing, and return or destruction of 
pembrolizumab and efti for each patient in the study. Any used vials, as well as any unused vials or unused 
portions of vials, must be maintained until accounted by [CONTACT_2037]. After accountability by [CONTACT_751781], all unused vials or medication not dispensed should be sent back to 
the Sponsor or a representative or is destroyed loca lly after prior approval by [CONTACT_456] (details are 
provided in the IMP Handling Manual). All used vials ma y be destroyed locally, if the destruction is fully 
documented, and following the site’s SOP for destruction of biological waste.  
 
6.13. Contraception Methods 
Efti and Pembrolizumab may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero . Furthermore, it is not known if 
pembrolizumab and/or efti have 
transient adverse effects on the .   
Patient should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to the fetus (unborn 
baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study. In order to participate in the study, patients of childbearing potential must adhere to the contraception requirement (from the day of study medication 
initiation (or 14 days prior to the initiation of study medication for oral contraception) throughout the study 
period up to [ADDRESS_1029157] stud y treatment. If there is any question that a patient of 
childbearing potential will not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that patient should 
not be entered into the study. 
The following methods  that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1 % per year when used consistently 
and correctly are considered as highly effective bi rth control methods. Highly effective birth control 
methods include:  
x intrauterine device  
x bilateral tubal occlusion  
x vasectomized partner  
x sexual abstinence  
x hormonal contraceptives as clinically allowed  
Notes: abstinence is only acceptable as true abstinence when it is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle 
of the patient, periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and CCI

document the patient ’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated. The outcome of 
patient`s pregnancy will be reported to the Sp onsor without delay and within 24 hours if the outcome is a 
serious adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life -threatening 
complication to the mother or newborn). The study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission 
to follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the Sponsor.

Screening assessments will include:  
• Obtaining of written informed consent prior to any study specific procedure (including screening 
procedures) being performed . Note: Patient can be consented up to 35 days before cycle 1 day 1 to 
allow planning of fresh tumor biopsy and/or perform CT scan for assessment of eligibility at 
screening  (the latter for Part B only) . All screening assessments including the biopsy or 
confirmatory tumor assessment for part B (to confirm progression ) itself are still to be performed 
between -21 days and -1. 
• Check for every i nclusion  and exclusion criteria  
Re-testing in the case of isolated out -of-range lab results during the screening period may be allowed on a 
case-by-case basis. The investigator mu st receive the approval from the Medical Monitor for each  case 
beforehand  A patient who failed screening due to an isolated out -of-range lab value may be allowed to be 
re-screened once, only on a case -by-case basis and only after approval by [CONTACT_303766] . 
Additional procedures (assessments) will be performed at screening and throughout the study. The 
following table provides a brief overview of the assessments and indicate references to specific chapters .

 7.2.1.  End of Treatment Visit  
All patients are scheduled to receive 8 cycles of combined pembrolizumab every 3 weeks and efti every 2 
weeks followed by [CONTACT_334102] 10 cycles of pembrolizumab and efti every 3 weeks. Thereafter pembrolizumab 
will be given every 3 weeks (cycle 19 till cycle 3 5) unless any of the reasons as specified in section 7.3 
occur. An End of Treatment (EOT) visit will be performed 3 weeks (± 7 days) after the last dose of any 
study treatment. The patients should then continue with PFS follow -up or OS follow -up dependent on the 
status of their disease.

7.2.2.  Progression Free Survival (PFS) - Follow -Up 
Patients who complete all study Treatment Visits without documented PD will attend PFS Follow -Up Visits 
every 12 weeks (± 9 days ) until PD, start of next anticancer therapy, pregnancy, withdrawal of consent, loss 
to follow -up, death from any cause, or the end of the study (whichever occurs first).  
For patients who prematurely discontinue treatment for any reason except PD and do not receive any other 
anti-cancer therapy or any other inv estigational therapy, PFS Follow -Up Visits will occur  every  [ADDRESS_1029171] recent 
radiological assessment prior to discontinuation.  
At each PFS Follow -Up Visit, the f ollowing will be performed:  
• Radiological assessment as described in section 8.1 
• Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance  status  and body weight  
• Advers e event follow -up  
Note: Once a patient starts new line of anti -cancer therapy, the patient will be followed up for OS . Details 
on the next anti -cancer therap ies will be recorded.

 7.2.3.  Overall Survival (OS) - Follow -Up 
After documented PD, or after start of any next line of anti -cancer therapy, the patient will be followed up 
for survival every 12 weeks  (± 4 weeks)  until end of study, lost to follow -up, withdrawal of consent or 
death whatever occurs first . The first overall survival visit will take place [ADDRESS_1029172] visit of the 
treatment phase  (EOC, EOT ) or PFS follow up  whatever was last . The visit can be performed via a 
telephone call. If necessary, patients may be contact[CONTACT_751782]  (FU) window.  
Patients who progre ss while on study treatment may receive any other next line of therapy, as clinically 
indicated, after performing the EOT visit. Patient who do not progress and complete the study treatment 
period (i.e. reach the end of cycle 35 without progression) may re ceive any other next line of therapy,  as 
clinically indicated, after performing the EOT visit. In both cases this is to be recorded during overall 
survival follow -up. Additionally, any details on the next  anti-cancer therap ies and its duration/outcome will 
be recorded.  
7.2.4.  Unscheduled Visits  
Additional unscheduled visits may be conducted to assess adverse events or to evaluate disease status or 
for any other reason according to the Investigator’s clinical judgment. These visits wil l be documented in 
the eCRF.  
 
7.3. Withdrawal, Discontinuation and Replacement of Patients  
7.3.1.  Patient Withdrawal  
Patients should be withdrawn from the study, if patient:  
• withdraws consent  
• is non -compliant with the study visits and procedures (refer to  section 7.4) 
• becomes pregnant  
It is recommended that the Investigator attempts to perform an EOT visit evaluations if a patient withdraws 
consent during the treatment period.  
The reason for patient withdrawal will be noted on the eCRF. The Investigator should attempt to follow 
withdrawn patients until resolution of any adverse events, or at least [ADDRESS_1029173] to follow -
up or (confirmed) progression , but remain on the study (e.g. PFS follow -up in case the patient has  not 
progressed , otherwise OS follow -up) if: 
• is non -compliant with the study treatments (refer to section 7.4) 
• the patient has clinically significant lab abnormalities or AEs  (i.e. recurrent pneumonitis grade 2)  
that, in the Investigator’s judgment, would preclude continued treatment  
• any other reason except withdrawal of consent

7.3.3.  Replacement of Patients  
The number of patient s to be included in the study may be increased in order to achieve the expected number 
of patien ts with evaluable data for the prima ry objective  analysis. Therefore, p atients discontinued from 
study treatment due to SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_1029175] possible 
date. Subsequent scans will then be performed every 6  weeks from the original scheduled scan date until 
week 12, every 9 weeks until week 30 and every 12 weeks thereafter.  Patients who are persistently 
noncompliant may be withdrawn from the study at the Investigator’s or the Sponsor’s discretion.

 8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
8.1. Efficacy Assessments  
8.1.1.    Radiological Scans and color  digital photography  
A computed  tomography ( CT) scan with contrast of the chest, abdomen  and pelvis is required for each 
patient at each timepoint. For patients in part C (HNSCC) a head and neck CT scan is required at each 
timepoint in addition . Tumor imaging is strongly preferred to be  acquired by [CONTACT_751783] . 
For the abdomen and pelvis, contrast -enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used when CT 
with iodinated contrast is contraindicated, or when mandated by [CONTACT_53246]. For the chest, a non -contrast 
CT o f the chest is recommended to evaluate the lung parenchyma. If brain imaging is performed to 
document the stability of existing metastases, MRI is the strongly preferred modality (not mandatory for 
patients without evidence of brain disease) . The same imaging technique regarding modality, ideally the 
same scanner, and the use of contrast should be used in a patient  throughout the study to optimize the 
reproducibility of the assessment of existing and new tumor burden and improve the accuracy of the 
assessment of response or progression based on imaging.  
The machines (CT or MRI) to be used are described in the imaging manual. The process for image 
collection and transmission to the central imaging vendor can be found in the Site Imaging Manual  (SIM).  
All scheduled images for all study patient s from the sites will be submitted to the central imaging vendor. 
In addition, images (including via other modalities) that are obtained at an unscheduled time point to 
determine disease progression, as we ll as imaging obtained for other reasons, but captures radiologic 
progression based on investigator assessment, should also be submitted to the central imaging vendor.  
The Imaging Central Laboratory will receive all information that is relevant (e.g., pre vious radiation, 
bisphosphonate therapy, etc.). Specific methodological details for all radiological assessments will be 
provided in the Imaging Review Charter.  
All treatment decisions will be based on  the investigator `s read.  
A lesion identified at follo w-up in an anatomical location that was not scanned at screening is considered a 
new lesion and will be handled accordingly. An example of this is when a patient has visceral disease at 
screening and while on study requires a CT or MRI scan of the brain wh ich reveals metastases. The patient’s 
brain metastases are considered new lesions even if there was no brain imaging conducted at screening.  
Imaging will be performed independently to the treatment schedule according to the  following schedule:  
• Screening:  ≤ 21 days prior to initiation of therapy, historical images (obtained within a window of 
≤ 28 days  prior to the start of study treatment) can be used for assessment of patient eligibility  for 
part A and C, if they are in lin e with the imaging protocol . For part B a confirmatory scan needs to 
be performed to confirm initial progression if patient was on PD -1 therapy at the time of consenting  
as detailed in the respective inclusion criterion .  
• 9-weekly (± 6 days) intervals star ting from date of assig nment to treatment  until week 36, meaning 
week 9, 18, 27  and 3 6 
• 12 weekly (± 9 days) intervals thereafter, meaning week 48, 60, 72, etc. 
 
Please Note: Actions taken with the study treatment /study agent (e.g. drug withdrawn or delayed) do not 
affect the imaging schedule. The imaging schedule shall remain as determined from  date of  assignment .  
 
Skin (Clinical) lesions if present at screening will be assessed in the same intervals as described above.  
Clinical Lesions: Clinical lesions detected by [CONTACT_751784] ≥ 10  mm in diameter as measured w ith calipers (for example skin nodules). If skin

 lesions are present at screening the documentation of these visible lesions (e.g. index tumor  lesion and/or 
new skin lesions) by [CONTACT_751785] a centimeter  ruler to estimate the size of the les ion is 
recommended. All photographs will maintain the anonymity of the patient and will be labelled using the 
patient’s study identifier and photograph date. Detailed photography instructions will be provided in the 
Imaging Manual.  
If skin lesions can be e valuated by [CONTACT_17588], clinical examination and imaging, imaging evaluation should be 
undertaken since it provides a more objective evaluation.     
Superficial clinical lesion (e.g., skin nodule) must be measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter 
in the plane of measurement will be recorded) with a minimum size of  the longest axis being ≥ [ADDRESS_1029176] 1.1.  
If a patient has clinically -indicated skin lesion(s), the investigator site will perform color  digital 
photography of all skin lesions using a ruler held flush to the skin next to the longest diameter of the lesion 
to indicate the size of the lesion at every time point scheduled for radiological scans that a lesion is present. 
Once a lesion(s) is d ocumented, the target area should be documented at every subsequent time point for 
the duration of the study.  
 
8.1.2.  Tumor  Response acc. to iRECIST  
Only patients with measurable disease at screening will be included in this study.  When more than one 
measurable lesion is present at baseline all lesions up to a maximum of five lesions total (and a maximum 
of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and 
will be assessed at baseline and specified time points  throughout the study. Initial tumor response and 
treatment decisions will be done according to iRECIST. iRECIST is based on RECIST 1.1, but adapted to 
account for the unique tumor response seen with immunotherapeutic drugs. iRECIST will be used by [CONTACT_751786]. When clinically stable  
(see section 8.1.3 ), patient s should not be discontinued until progression is confirmed by [CONTACT_737], 
working with local radiology, according to the rules outlined in section 8.1.[ADDRESS_1029177].  
• Complete Response (iCR): disappearance of all target and non -target lesions  
• Partial Response (iPR): at least 30  % decrease from baseline in the sum of the longest diameters 
(longest axis for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal regions) of target lesions  
• Unconfirmed p rogressive Disease ( iUPD): at least 20  % increase  (≥ 5 mm)  in the sum of the longest 
diameters (longest axis for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal regions) of target lesions, taking 
as a reference the smallest sum on study  
• Confirmed progressive Disease (iCPD): a further increase of a t least ≥ [ADDRESS_1029178] diameters (longest axis for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal regions) of target lesions, 
taking as a reference the last iUPD assessment on study  
• Stable Disease ( iSD): small changes that do not qualify for the above criteria  
For targ et lesions iCR, iPR and iSD can all be assigned after iUPD (unconfirmed progress).

  CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  Page 82 of 113 
 All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non -target lesions and will also be assessed at 
baseline and specified time points throughout the study. Tum or response for the group of non -target lesions 
will be evaluated according to the iRECIST:  
• iCR: Disappearance of all non -target lesions. All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size 
(<10  mm short axis).  
• iNon-CR/ iNon-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s).  
• iUPD: Unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions .  
• iCPD: Further increase of non -target lesions taking as a reference the last iUPD assessment on 
study . 
New lesions are assessed and classified as non -measurable or  measur able (if ≥ 10 mm; ≥ [ADDRESS_1029179] 1.1). From measurable new lesions, up to 5 lesions total (up to 2 per organ), may be 
selected as New Lesions – Target.  The sum of diameters of these lesions will be calculated and  kept distinct 
from the sum of diameters for target lesions at baseline.  All other new lesions will be followed qualitatively 
as New Lesions – Non-target. First occurrence of new lesions leads to iUPD.  
The Medical Monitor is to be contact[CONTACT_751787] a patient i s assessed as having iUPD. 
Confirmation in clinically stable patients as described in section 8.1.3  is necessary.  Progression is 
considered confirmed, and the overall response will be iCPD, if ANY  of the following occurs:  
• Any of the factors that were the basis for the initial iUPD show wors ening  
o For target lesions, worsening is a further increase in the sum of diameters of ≥[ADDRESS_1029180]  prior iUPD time point; this does not have to meet the “unequivocal” standard of RECIST 
1.1 
o For new lesions, worsening is any of these:  
▪ an increase in the new lesion sum of diameters by ≥[ADDRESS_1029181]  prior iUPD time 
point  
▪ visible growth of new non -target lesions  
▪ the appearance of additional new lesions  
• Any new factor appears that would have triggered PD by [CONTACT_393] 1.1  
Persistent iUPD  
Progression is considered not confirmed, and the overall response remains iUPD, if:  
• None of the progression -confirming factors identified above occurs AND  
• The target lesion sum of diameters (initial target lesions) remains above the initial PD threshold 
(by [CONTACT_393] 1.1)  
Additional imaging for confirmation should be scheduled 4 to 8 weeks from t he imaging on which iUPD is 
seen. This may correspond to the next visit in the original visit schedule. The assessment of the subsequent 
confirmation imaging proceeds in an identical manner, with possible outcomes of iCPD, iUPD, and 
iSD/iPR/iCR.  
The r eason  why iUPD cannot be confirmed (e. g. patient clinically not stable, treatment stopped but patient 
not reassessed/imaging not performed  due to patient refusal, protocol noncompliance or patient death) 
should be recorded.

Resolution of iUPD  
Progression is co nsidered not confirmed, and the overall response becomes iSD/iPR/iCR, if:  
• None of the progression -confirming factors identified above occurs, AND  
• The target lesion sum of diameters (initial target lesions) is not above the initial PD threshold.  
The respon se is classified as iSD or iPR (depending on the sum of diameters of the target lesions), or iCR 
if all lesions resolve.  
In this case, the initial iUPD is considered to be pseudo -progression, and the level of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_178883] “reset”. This means that the next visit that shows radiographic progression, whenever it 
occurs, is again classified as iUPD by [CONTACT_19393], and the confirmation process is repeated before a response 
of iCPD can be assigned.  
At each specified time point, the overall respons e will be determined  as described below . For each patient 
the best overall response rate will be evaluated according to 19.2.

Clinical Trial Protocol v5.0, final; [ADDRESS_1029182] (section 19.2), disease progression should be confirmed by [CONTACT_779] [ADDRESS_1029183] unconfirmed disease 
progression may continue on treatment at the discretion of the investigator until progression is confirmed 
by [CONTACT_779], provided the patient is clinically stable. Clinical stability is defined as the following:  
• Absence  of symptoms  and signs  indicating  clinically  significant  progression  of disease  
• No decline in ECOG performance status  
• No requirements for intensified management, including increased analgesia, radiation, or other 
palliative care  
Any patient  deemed clinically u nstable  should be discontinued from study treatment at site -assessed first 
radiologic evidence of PD and  is not required to have repeat tumor imaging for confirmation of PD by 
[CONTACT_19393].  
If the Investigator decides to continue treatment, the patient  may cont inue to receive study treatment and 
the tumor assessment should be repeated 4 to 8 weeks later (i.e. earlier than originally scheduled  according 
to the protocol but not earl ier than 4 weeks after the previous one ) to confirm PD by [CONTACT_19393], per 
Investigator assessment.   
If repeat imaging does not confirm PD per iRECIST, as assessed by [CONTACT_737], and the patient  
continues to be clinically stable, study treatment may continue and follow the regular imaging sche dule 
(e.g., in the combo -treatment phase scans were to be done at week 9, 18, 27, 36 , and a scan was done at 
week 13 to confirm progression , then the next scans should be done at week 18, 27  and 36, as planned).  
Patients who receive confirmatory imaging do  not need to undergo the next scheduled tumor imaging if it 
is less than 4 weeks later; tumor imaging may resume at the subsequent scheduled imaging time point, if 
clinically stable.  
If however PD is confirmed  (iCPD) as defined in Appendix 1 , patient s shou ld be discontinued from study 
treatment.  Nevertheless, i f a patient  with confirmed radiographic progression (iCPD) is achieving a 
clinically meaningful benefit, an exception to continue study treatment may be considered following 
consultation with the Sponsor. In this case, if study treatment is continued, tumor imaging should continue 
to be performed following the intervals as outlined in Section [ADDRESS_1029184] publication (61). A summary of imaging and treatment requirements after first radiologic 
evidence of progression is provided and illustrated as a flowchart in the figure below:

Figure 6: Imaging and Treatment for Clinically Stable Patient s Treated with Pembrolizumab after First Radiologic 
Evidence of PD Assessed by [CONTACT_751788]. As opposed to the 
rules in place for confirmation of iUPD, confirmation of iPR and iCR can be done within 4 to 9 weeks until 
week 36 and within 4 to 12 weeks thereafter, r espectively. In other words, the radiological confirmation of 
the response can be done earlier but also as per the original radiological assessment schedule, at the 
discretion of the Investigator.  
Patients who receive confirmatory imaging do not need to u ndergo the next scheduled tumor imaging if it 
is less than 4 weeks later; tumor imaging may resume at the subsequent scheduled imaging time point, if 
clinically stable.  
 
8.1.4.  Tumo r Response acc. to RECIST 1.1  
Only patients with measurable disease at screening w ill be included in this study.  When more than one 
measurable lesion is present at baseline all lesions up to a maximum of five lesions total (and a maximum 
of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesio ns and 
will be assessed at baseline and specified time points throughout the study. Tumor  response for target 
lesions will be evaluated according to the RECIST version 1.1:  
• Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions

 • Partial Response (PR): at least 30  % decrease from baseline in the sum of the longest diameters 
(longest axis for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal regions) of target lesions  
• Progressive Disease (PD): at least 20  % increase in the sum of the longest diameters (longest axis  
for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal regions) of target lesions, taking as a reference the 
smallest sum on study  
• Stable Disease (SD): small changes that do not qualify for the above criteria  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identif ied as non -target lesions and will also be assessed at 
baseline and specified time points throughout the study. Tumor  response for the group of non -target lesions 
will be evaluated according to the RECIST version 1.1:  
• CR: Disappearance of all non -target lesions. All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size 
(<10mm short axis).  
• Non-CR/ Non -PD: Persistence of one or mor e non -target lesion(s).  
• PD: Unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions.  
At each protocol -specified time point, the overall response will be determined as shown below:  
Target lesions  Non-target lesions  New lesions  Overall response  
CR CR No CR 
CR Non-CR/ non -PD No PR 
CR Not evaluated  No PR 
PR Non-PD or not all evaluated  No PR

8.1.5.  Progression -Free Survival  
PFS is defined as the number of days between the date of treatment assignment and the earliest date of 
documented disease progression or death without prior progression. The date of disease progression or 
censoring for PFS will be determined according to t he conventions listed below. These conventions are 
based on the May 20 18 FDA Guidance for Industry, ‘ Clinical Study Endpoints for the Approval of Cancer 
Drugs and Biologics ’ (https://www.fda.gov/media/[ZIP_CODE]/download) and on the Apr 2015 FDA Guidance  
for th e Industry, ‘Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer Drugs and  
Biologics’ (https://www.fda.gov/media/116860/download) .

8.1.6.  Overall Survival  
Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time between the date of treatment assignment and the date of death. 
For patients without documentation of death, OS will be censored on the last date the patient was known to 
be alive. OS will be followed continuous ly while patients are on the study treatment and during OS follow -
up via in -person or phone contact [CONTACT_751789] . If necessary, patients may 
be contact[CONTACT_751790].  
 
8.2. Pharmacokinetics  
At each time point a single blood sample collected will be sufficient for all test to be performed  for PK 
analysis purposes .  
In the subpopulation s of [ADDRESS_1029185] additional 10 patients in Stage 2 , samples will 
be collected  in EDTA tub es on day 1 of cycle 1, 5 and 9 before and after the efti injections (pre -dose and 
then at 1, 2, 4, 8, 24 , 48, 72 and 96  hours after dosing). PK sampling will be done at selected sites in ES 
and [LOCATION_006].  
Plasma, prepared from the blood samples , will be stored at -80°C  (-112 F) . Details on handling of blood 
samples will be described in detail in the Laboratory Manual.

Plasma samples will be collected in EDTA tubes  to assess for Th1 biomarkers (e.g. IFN -, CXCL10) pre -
dose on Day 1 Cycle 1, 5, 9 , 13, EOC  and EOT. Plasma, prepared from the blood samples , will be stored 
at -80°C ( -112 F) and shipped in batches to the central laboratory.  
In the subset s of patients with PK assessment, Th1 biomarkers will be ad ditionally assessed in samples 
collected at selected timepoints  after dosing with efti at cycle 1, cycle 5 and cycle 9. No additional blood 
samples will be  taken. The PK samples available at these timepoints will be sufficient.  
8.3.2.  Tumor tissue sample  
Archival t umor material or newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion not previously 
irradiated will be provided by [CONTACT_84208] a mandatory basis. Samples will be shipped in batch es to the 
central laboratory.  
It will be analyzed  in order to identify potential biomarkers of response  (i.e. PD -L1 expression) . These 
analyses will involve histopathological (e.g., immunohistochemistry) and/or molecular (e.g., protein 
sequencing, MS -based proteomics5) and/or genetic (e.g. gene expression profile analysis) assay 
technologies. Other potential biomarkers may also be assessed depending on emerging scientific data. 
Specific methodological details for all tumor  tissue assessments will be provi ded in the Tumor  Tissue 
Manual.  
8.3.3.  Gene expression profile  analyses  
Whole blood will be collected at screening and pre -dose cycle 5 from each patient for gene expression 
profile analyses (acc to PanCancer Immune Code). Blood samples wi ll be shipped to the central laboratory 
according to the instruction s on the Laboratory Manual .  
 
8.4. Immunogenicity  
Autoantibodies (i.e. antimitochondrial antibodies, rheumatoid factor, antithyroid (antithyroglobulin) 
antibodies, and antinuclear antibodies ) will be evaluated at the local laboratory  at cycle 1 day 1, cycle 9 day 
1, EOC and EOT.

 The formation of anti -drug antibodies (ADA) against efti will be assessed at the central laboratory in blood 
samples collected at cycle 1 day 1, cycle 2 day 8, cycle 3 day 15, cycle 5 day 1, cycle 9 day 1, cycle 13 day 
1, EOC prior to dosing and at the EOT visit.  
Blood samples for ADA will be collected in a tube without any anticoagulant to prepare serum. These 
samples will be stored at  -80°C (-112 F ). ADA samples will be shipped in batches to the central laboratory. 
Details on handling of all blood samples will be  described in detail in the Laboratory Manual.  
 
8.5. Safety Assessments  
Details for all safety assessments will be recorded in both the eCRF and the patient’s source documents.  
8.5.1.    Laboratory Tests  
All laboratory test results fulfilling one or more criteria defined in section 9.[ADDRESS_1029188] be reported immediately using a 
pregnancy form  (see section  9.5) and further study treatment must be discontinued. Patients must be 
followed throughout the duration of the pregnancy. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes are considered SAEs 
and must be reported using the SAE form.  
Routine safety laboratory assessment, including hematology , biochemistry, coagulation , thyroid function 
test and uri nalysis values will be performed  as specified in Table [ADDRESS_1029189] be 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_17044] 10 minutes before ECG collection and remain supi[INVESTIGATOR_105305]. For all patient ECG should be performed prior to meals.   
For the purpose of immediate patient safety a t the site, a qualified physician (the Investigator or qualified 
designee) will be responsible for interpreting the ECGs. If a clinically significant quantitative or qualitative 
change from baseline is identified after enrolment, the Investigator will asse ss the patient for symptoms to 
determine whether the patient can continue in the study. The Investigator or qualified designee is 
responsible for determining if any change in patient management is needed and must document his/her 
review of the ECG printed at the time of evaluation.  The following variables will be measured or calculated 
for each ECG:  QRS duration and axis ; PR interval ; Heart rate and RR interval  and QT interval .  
8.5.3.  Vital Signs Assessments  
Vital signs will be assessed at regular intervals as in dicated in the schedule of assessments. Vital signs will 
be recorded after a 10 minute resting (supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]) period. The following variables will be measured:  
• Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mm/Hg)  
• Pulse rate (beats per minute)  
• Body temperature (Celsius or Fahrenheit ) 
• Body weight  
• Height (at screening  only)  
All blood pressure measurements should be made using the same type of device on the same arm, using a 
completely automated device. Manual techniques will be used only if an a utomated device is not available. 
Body temperature will be measured in a consistent manner throughout the study.

8.5.4.  Adverse Events  
AEs will be collected, categorized  and reported as described in section  9. 
 
8.6. Medical History  
Each patient’s medical history will be taken during screening. This includes in particular patient 
demographics,  smoking history,  details of cancer onset, cancer history including prior PD -L1 status, prior 
surgery, and past treatment including chemotherapy and/ or radiation therapy  and for HNSCC prior HPV 
status . Medical history should also include history of HIV, HCV and HBV exposu re. 
 
8.7. Concomitant Therapy and Concomitant Procedures Assessment  
Prior medications  comprise all therapi[INVESTIGATOR_751737] 1 day 1 . Concomitant medications 
are defined as medications that were started on or after cycle 1 day 1  until 28 days a fter end of treatment 
(last dose of any study drug).  Acceptable concomitant therapy is described in section 6.10. Concomitant 
procedures will be assessed, starting from cycle 1 day 1  until 28 days after end of treatment (last dose of 
any study drug).  Concomitant therapy and concomitant procedures need to be assessed at every visit.

 9 ADVERSE & SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
9.1. Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence (which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship 
with this treatment). An AE can be any unfavorable  and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory 
findings as described below), symptom , or disease, whether or not related to any study drug. This includes 
any occurrence that was new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the baseline condition.  
All AEs, regardless of severity or causality, will be documented for type of adv erse event, date and time of 
onset, date of resolution, duration, severity grade according to the current CTCAE version 5.0 where 
applicable, relationship (unrelated, possibly related, or related) to each of the study drugs separately ( efti 
or pembrolizumab ), remedial actions taken, and outcome (see  section 19.5).  
If no common toxicity criteria ( CTC ) grading is available, the severity of an AE is graded  as mild, moderate, 
severe, life -threatening or fatal. The respective translation in the gradings 1 to 5 is described in section 19.5. 
It is the Investigator’s res ponsibility to review all laboratory findings and vital sign measurements. 
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test abnormalities, are considered AEs if 
they result in any of the following:  
• Discontinuation of study treatment  
• Requirement for treatment or any other therapeutic intervention  
• Necessity for further diagnostic evaluation (excluding a repetition of the same procedure to confirm 
the abnormality)  
• Association with clinical signs or symptoms that may have a significant c linical impact, as 
determined by [CONTACT_737].  
• Clinically significant (as assessed by [CONTACT_093]) changes of any laboratory parameter 
throughout the study (i.e. compared to the last assessment prior to any study treatment)  
• Any abnormal laboratory  parameter qualifying for any ≥ grade 3 NCI -CTC criteria  
Note: If the abnormal result was already present at baseline with the same severity, it will be recorded as 
medical history. Only abnormal results of ≥ grade [ADDRESS_1029190] the information in the patient’s medical records. All AEs are to be recorded 
on the appropriate eCRFs and in detail on the source documents.  
If it concerns a SAE, it must be reported to th e Sponsor or its delegate within 24 hours of becoming aware 
of the event (for details see sections 9.2 and 9.5). Safety follow -up is to be performed.  
Patients who experience AEs will be monitored with relevant clinical assessments and laboratory tests, as 
determined by [CONTACT_737]. All AEs  and laboratory abnormalities encountered during the study should 
be followed until resolution or stabilization  of the event(s). Any action taken and follow -up results must be 
recorded in the patient’s medical record. Follow -up laboratory results should be  filed with the patient’s 
source documentation and eCRF.  Adverse events that are ongoing after the end of safety follow -up should 
be marked as ongoing.  
 
For all AEs related to study treatment that require the patient to discontinue treatment, relevant clinical 
assessments and laboratory tests should be repeated on at least a monthly basis until final resolution or 
TACTI -002  
Clinical Trial Protocol v5.0, final; 18 Aug 2023                                                                                    Immutep S.A.S.  
 
  CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  Page 92 of 113 
 stabilization  of the event(s). These asses sments should be captured in the source data, SAE forms and be 
entered in the eCRFs.  
Observations of the same laboratory abnormality or vital sign abnormality from visit to visit should not be 
repeatedly recorded on the CRF, unless the etiology  changes. Th e initial severity of the event should be 
recorded. If the severity or seriousness of the event changes, a new AE should be reported.  
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and symptoms 
should be identifie d by [CONTACT_303595]. However, if the Investigator does not consider an 
observed or reported sign or symptom a component of a specific disease or syndrome, it should be recorded 
as a separate AE.  
 
9.2. Serious Adverse Events  
A SAE is generally any  AE that results in one or more of the following:  
• Death (not resulting due to disease progression) . 
• Is immediately life threatening (i.e. presents an immediate risk of death at the time of the AE, not an 
AE that hypothetically might have caused death if i t were more severe) . 
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . 
• Causes persistent or significant disability/ incapacity . 
• Is a congenital anomaly/ birth defect . 
• Qualifies for ECIs as described in section 9.3. 
• Other important medical events that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , but based upon appropriate medical judgment, are thought to jeopardize the patient 
and/or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent  one of the outcomes defining a SAE  
Elective pre -planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_751738]. Tumor  
progression  and associated signs or symptoms are not considered SAEs, based upon investigators 
discretion.  
The Investigator should consult with the Medical Monitor if there is any doubt regarding classification of 
a SAE.  
Definition of Life -Threatening Adverse Events : An adverse event is life threatening if the patient was at 
immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred (i.e. it does not include a reaction that, had it occurred 
in a more serious form, might have caused death). For example, drug -induced hepati tis that resolved without 
evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life threatening, even though drug -induced hepatitis 
can be fatal.   
Definition of Disabling/ Incapacitating Experience:  An adverse experience is incapacitating or disabling 
if the experience results in a substantial and/ or permanent disruption of the patient’s ability to carry out 
normal life functions.  
9.3. Events of clinical interest  
Selected non -serious and serious adverse events are also known as Events of Clinical Interest (ECI ) and 
must be reported to the Sponsor  within [ADDRESS_1029191] * for this trial include:

 • an overdose of pembrolizumab or efti (For this study, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined 
as any dose of 1000 mg or ≥5 times the indicated dose and an overdose for efti will be defined as any 
dose of 150 mg or ≥5 times the indicated dose) – Treatment of Overdose, that is not associate d with 
clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results.  
• an elevated AST or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 3X the upper limit of normal and an 
elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or equal to 2X the upper limit of normal and, at 
the same time, an alkaline phosphatase lab value that is less than 2X the upper limit of normal, as 
determined by [CONTACT_13149] -specified laboratory testing or unscheduled laboratory testing.*  
*Note:  These criteria are based upon available regul atory guidance documents. The purpose of the criteria 
is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require an additional evaluation for an 
underlying etiology. The trial site guidance for assessment and follow up of these criteria can be ma de 
available. It may also be appropriate to conduct additional evaluation for an underlying etiology in the 
setting of abnormalities of liver blood tests including AST, ALT, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase that 
do not meet the criteria noted above. In these cases, the decision to proceed with additional evaluation will 
be made through consultation between the study investigators and the Medical monitor. However, 
abnormalities of liver blood tests that do not meet the criteria noted above are not ECIs fo r this trial.  
 
9.4. Time period and frequency for collecting AEs, SAEs, pregnancy and ECIs  
All AEs, SAEs and other reportable safety events (i.e. Pregnancy, ECIs) that occur after the consent form 
is signed but before treatment /allocation must be reported by [CONTACT_093]. If an AE occurred after 
signing informed consent, the AE is to be recorded in the AE section of the eCRF.  
. 
All AEs or ECIs (Events of Clinical Interest) from the time of treatment/ allocation through [ADDRESS_1029192] be reported by [CONTACT_093].  
All AEs meeting serious criteria, from the time of treatment/ allocation thro ugh [ADDRESS_1029193] be reported by [CONTACT_093].  
All pregnancies and exposure during breas tfeeding, from the time of treatment/ allocation through [ADDRESS_1029194] be reported immediately to the Sponsor if the event is considered to be drug -related.  
Safety follow -up is to be performed until resolution of AEs/ECIs/SAEs or for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1029195] study drug administration or until patients is receiving any other anti -cancer therapy or any other 
investigational therapy.  
9.5. Expedited reporting of SAEs, ECIs or pregnancy  
All AEs that meet the crit eria for SAE require the completion of a study specific SAE Form (or Additional 
Safety Information (ASI) Form). This applies to all SAEs, whether or not they were considered to be related 
to the study treatment.  
The Investigator must report all SAEs to th e sponsor or its designee immediately, i.e. within 24 hours (by 
[CONTACT_3719] e -mail) of learning of its occurrence. For this reporting, a SAE Form (provided in the Investigator

 File) needs to be completed in English. Follow -up information about a previously repo rted SAE must also 
be reported within [ADDRESS_1029196] also be entered on the relevant Medical History page of the CRF.  
The SAE report should provide a detailed description of the AE and may include anonymized copi[INVESTIGATOR_751739]. Autopsy results, if applicable, should also be sent to the 
sponsor or its designee as soon as they become available. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_751740].  
All SAEs will need to be followed actively until resolution or stabilization  (but for at least [ADDRESS_1029197] study drug administration). The above is also applicable to follow -up SAE information.  
If a female patient becomes pregnant during the study, she will be removed from the study without receiving 
further study medication. Follow -up regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and any postnatal sequelae in 
the infant is required. Pregnancies are considered immediately reportable AEs (within 1 working da y) and 
are to be documented in the eCRF.  Furthermore, a Pregnancy Reporting Form (provided in the Investigator 
File) needs to be completed in English.  
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs):  S[LOCATION_003]Rs are SAEs that are at a minimum 
possibly r elated to any of the study agents or study treatment ( efti or pembrolizumab ) and are unexpected  
(i.e. not listed in the investigator brochure and/or SmPC). S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be collected and reported 
expeditiously to competent authorities and IECs)/IRBs accordin g to regulations.  
 The reporting timelines are as follows:  
• All fatal/ life -threatening S[LOCATION_003]Rs need to be reported within 7 calendar days of initial notification.  
• All other S[LOCATION_003]Rs within 15 calendar days of initial notification.  
Expectedness is determined  by [CONTACT_751791].  
Medical and scientific judgment is to be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate 
in other situations, such as for important medical events that are not immed iately life threatening or do not 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_751741].  
In addition to the expedited reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs, the Sponsor will submit, once a year throughout the 
clinical study, an aggregated s afety report (Developmental Safety Update Report, DSUR) to the Regulatory 
Authorities and Ethics Committees of the participating sites in the concerned countries. This DSUR 
includes cumulative listings of all SAEs and S[LOCATION_003]Rs from the Sponsor’s clinical stu dies with efti during 
the reporting period.

A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide deta ils on the methods of analysis to address all study 
objectives. The SAP may be amended during the study, but will be finalized before the cut-off date for any 
statistical analysis.  
For continuous variables, data will be summarized with  the number of patients, mean, standard deviation, 
median, and minimum and maximum values. For categorical variables, data will be tabulated in frequency 
tables to display the number and proportion of patien ts for each category. Baseline assessments for each 
outcome variable will be defined as the last measurement obtained before the first dose of study drug. 
 
10.1. Sample Size Determination 
The null hypothesis that the true response rate is [ p0 ] will be tested against a one-sided alternative. In the 
first stage, [ n1 ] patients will be accrued. If there are [ r1 ] or fewer responses in these [ n1 ] patients, the 
study will be stopped. Otherwise, [ n - n1 ] additional patients will be accrued for a total of [ n ]. The null 
hypothesis will be rejected if [ r2 + 1 ] or more responses are observed in [ n ] patients. This design yields a one-sided 
type I error rate of  and power of  % when the true response rate is [ p1 ].  Calculations 
reveal that [ADDRESS_1029198] to agree with  the assumed proportions for the calculations (r1/N1 
and r2/N total and p 1), especially for such small sample numbers. 
Mini-max results of this calculation were used for this clinical trial.

NSCLC 2nd 
line 7 %  % 1 23 13 36 
HNSCC 15 %   % 2 18 19 37 
The “true response rates” for 1st line NSCLC were extracted from Keynote-024 and Keynote-042 under 
consideration that for PD-1 all comers resp onse rate will be lower (10, 11). For 2nd line NSCLC there are 
no available publications for pembrolizumab alone in PD-1/PD-L1 refractory patients, but due to the 
confirmation of progression it (p 0) is considered close to 0 % for pe mbrolizumab alone. The alternative (p 1) 
of  % was  considered clinically relevant especially in  comparison to available standard chemotherapy6. 
For HNSCC relevant publications from Keynote 012 and Keynote-040 were used (2, 12) for p 0. 
Sample size calculations were performed using the validated software R R version 3.3.3 (2017-03-06),

6 Given the available treatment option in this patients population (mostly single agent chemo therapy) and its efficacy 
(about 20 % SD at 6 months; median OS 6-12 months),  long-term stabilization of the disease (6+ months) are 
considered as a meaningful clinical benef it and will be counted equal to a respons e for the decision if stage 2 can be 
opened. Final decision is to be made by [CONTACT_737911] C based on an updated risk benefit assessment.   CCICCI

For part A an extension (Part A extension) is antici pated based on the ORR of efti in combination with 
pembrolizumab as test group in a single arm design. The true ORR of monotherapy pembrolizumab in 
NSCLC 1st line is expected to be 23%, whereas a rate of % is expected for the test group (in case PD -
L1 distribution is a s expected from historical studies with ~70% <50 % PD-L1expression). Using these 
assumptions with a power of % and a one -sided level of significance of % in this phase II trial, a 
sample size of 105 patients would be required for analysis. With a drop-out rate of 5%, a total of 110 patients need to be enrolled. With the 36 patients of  stages 1 and 2, another 74 patients would be needed to 
be enrolled in total in this extension. This sample size is regarded sufficient to provide a reasonable 
precision for the estimate of ORR as basis for sample size considerations for further clinical studies.  
Possible extensions of part B and C will be introduced via substantial amendments.

LLC. Kaysville, Utah, [LOCATION_003], ncss.com/software/pass. 
10.2. Assignment to treatment  
Patients will be assigned to the single treatment arm according to the indication as assessed during 
screening.  
 
10.3. Analysis Populations 
Full Analysis Set 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) includes all assigned pati ents who received at least one dose of study drug (i.e. 
one dose of either pembrolizumab or efti). This popu lation will be the primary population for the analyses 
of efficacy endpoints and baseline characteristics. 
Per-protocol Population 
In addition, a per protocol population analysis will be performed. Details are described in the SAP. 
Safety Population 
The safety set is defined analogously to the full analys is set and includes all assigned patients who received 
at least one dose of study drug (i.e. one dose of either  pembrolizumab or efti). This population will be the 
primary population for the analyses of safety. 
Pharmacokinetic population (PK population) 
All patients of the subpopulations (20 in Stage 1 and additional 10 in Stage 2) will be taken into account 
who: 
x received at least one dose of efti and  
x have sufficient plasma concentration data to calculate reliable estimates of at least one PK 
parameter, and 
x are without any protocol deviation that would in terfere with the interpretation of PK results.

 10.4. Handling of Missing Data  
When tumor  response (as defined by [CONTACT_751792]) based on target lesions is missing, it will 
be set to PD if the last non -missing observation is PD. No imputation will be used to handle any other 
patterns of missing data for tumor  response (i.e., it will be censored in the efficacy  analysis). Rules for 
handling of missing data for secondary endpoints including missing/ partial dates will be defined in the 
SAP.  
 
10.5. Subgroup Analyses  
Subgroup analyses  (e.g. PD-L1 positivity) will be described in the SAP.   
 
10.6. Interim Analyses  
Descriptive interim analyses (incl. abbreviated report , if needed ) may be performed e.g. for the DMC  
meetings  or when one stage of one part of the study is completed , which do not affect the analysis of the 
primary endpoint. No adjustments for multiplicity are needed  as no statistical test will be performed . Details 
will be described in the SAP.  
 
10.7. Timing of analysis  
The analyses (also interim analyses) may be performed separately for each indication  (dependent on 
availability of the results)  as described in the SAP. Separate clinical study reports (also interim analyses) 
may be written for each indication  (dependent on availability of the results)  as described in the SAP . 
 
10.8. Baseline and Demographic Characteristics  
Baseline characteristics and demographic information at baseline will be summarized with descriptive 
statistics for the FAS of each part A -C of the study. Medications will be coded using the most current 
version of the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug dictionary and will be summarized as treated for 
all patients in the safety population. Prior medications are defined as medications that were stopped prior 
to the treatment period/cycle 1 day  1. Medications used at study entry are defined as medication th at started 
on or prior to the treatment period/cycle 1 day  1. Concomitant medications are defined as medications that 
were taken from cycle 1 day 1 until 28 days after end of treatment (last dose of any study drug) .  
 
10.9. Efficacy Analyses  
Efficacy analyses will be performed for each part of the study independently.  
For indications with an extension, the patients of stages 1 and 2 will be combined with the newly enrolled 
patients of the extension as combined dataset for analysis. Certain en dpoints will in addition be analyzed 
in the subgroups "patients of stage 1+2" and "newly enrolled patients" to assess any effect of later 
enrollment on the outcome. All endpoints assessed in stages 1 and 2 will also be assessed for the extension 
as describ ed above. Details will be given in the SAP.  
10.9.1.  Analysis of the primary endpoint

Clinical Trial Protocol v5.0, final; 18 Aug 2023                                                                                   Immutep S.A.S. 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY Page 98 of 113 Primary endpoint is the objective response rate (ORR).  The ORR is defined as the number of subjects with 
a best overall response (BOR) according to iRECIST as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by [CONTACT_14458]. The BOR is the best  response as determined by [CONTACT_751793], whichever comes first. For patien ts with no documented progression or subsequent 
therapy, all available response assessments will be used to define BOR. In addition, analysis of confirmed 
responses will be described in the SAP.  
The response will be further evaluated by [CONTACT_147448] (DOR) based on iRECIST, calculated 
for all patients with CR or PR up to an objective documentation of progression or death, whichever occurs first. For patients with no documented progression or death, DOR will be censored at the date of last 
documentation of response.  
DOR = Date of disease progression / death – Date of first partial or complete response + 1. 
ORR will be summarized by [CONTACT_751756]-sided 95% exact confidence intervals using 
the Clopper-Pearson method.  
The DOR will be summarized using the Kaplan-Meier  product-limit method. The median time to event will 
be calculated along with 95% CIs using the Kaplan-M eier method. In addition, the proportion of responders 
still in response at different timepoints (3 and 6 months) will be assessed based on a Kaplan-Meier Plot.  
As a sensitivity analysis ORR and DOR will be asse ssed based on RECIST 1.1 based on the investigator 
assessment. All efficacy analyses are based local investigator assessments. A central independent 
assessment may be conducted as specified in the SAP. 
10.9.2.  Analysis of the secondary and exploratory endpoints 
All secondary analyses will be performed descriptively.  
The time-to-event endpoints (PFS, 
 OS) will be summarized using the Kaplan -Meier product-limit 
method. The median time to event will be calculated along with 95% CIs using the Kaplan-Meier method. In addition, the proportion of responders still in respons e at different timepoints (3, 6 and 9 months) will be 
assessed based on a Kaplan-Meier Plot. The assessment  of progression will be based on iRECIST (this does 
not apply to ) . 
PFS will be calculated as the time from the date  of assignment into the study to the date of first 
documentation of disease progression or date of death due to any cause, whichever occurs first: 
PFS = Date of disease progression/ death – Date of assignment into the study + 1. 
The PFS rate at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months and corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be estimated 
using the Kaplan-Meier method.  
The OS rate at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months and corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be estimated 
using the Kaplan-Meier method.  
The overall survival (OS) will be calculated as the tim e from the date of assignment into the study treatment 
to the date of death from any cause:  
OS = Date of death – Date of assignment into the study + 1. 
 
, will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. 
As a sensitivity analysis PFS will be assessed ba sed on RECIST 1.1. All efficacy analyses are based on 
local investigator assessments. A central independent asse ssment will be conducted as specified in the SAP.

 10.10.  Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
The plasma concentration time profile of efti will be summarized and PK parameters such as area under the 
curve (AUC), peak serum concentration (C max), time to reach C max (tmax), systemic clearance (CL), 
elimination half -life (t1/2) and volume of distribut ion (VD) will be calculated.  
 
10.11.  Immunogenicity analyses  
The development of anti -efti antibodies will be evaluated  and characterized . Autoantibodies will also be 
evaluated.  
 
10.12.  Biomarker Analyses  
Tumor  material or newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion not previously irradiated will 
be provided by [CONTACT_84208] a mandatory  basis. Blood sampling for potential biomarker will be conducted 
throughout the study. Exploratory analyses to asse ss correlations between biomarkers (PD-L1 expression, 
PancGen Score , TH-1 levels ) and response endpoints will be done, depending on the available data.  
10.13.  Safety Analyses  
Safety data will be summarized  for the safety population. The baseline value for safety analysis is defined 
as the value collected at the time closest to and prior to the start of  any study drug ( pembrolizumab  or efti 
whichever was first ) administration (i.e. Day 1 of week 1 of cycle 1).  
An adverse event (AE) summary table will include treatm ent-emergent adverse events (TEAE; i.e., AEs 
with onset dates on or after the first dose of study drug regardless of causality), serious TEAEs, TEAEs 
related to pembrolizumab  and efti, fatal TEAEs, TEAEs leading to temporary and permanent stop, TEAEs 
accor ding to worst severity and combinations of previously mentioned type of AEs.  
The number and percentage of patients with at least 1 TEAE will be tabulated by [CONTACT_751754] (i.e. from MedDRA). For these tabulations, the number of pati ents (i.e., patients with multiple 
events will be counted only once per preferred term) and the number of events (i.e. except for by [CONTACT_751794]) with that particular TEAE are presented. The AE tabulations including all TEAEs (by [CONTACT_926]), 
seriou s TEAEs, fatal TEAEs, permanent stop of study agent TEAEs will be presented. The previously 
mentioned type of TEAEs might also be presented in combination with treatment -relatedness. AEs will also 
be tabulated by [CONTACT_1037]/or relationship to study drug.  At each level of tabulation, the event with the 
highest level of severity or strongest drug relationship will be presented. The tables will be described in 
detail in the SAP prior to any analysis.  
All AEs will be listed. In addition, detailed listings will be provided for patients who die, experience a SAE, 
or discontinue the study because of an AE. These listings will include age, duration of follow up, number 
of doses received, and time since last dose.  
Vital signs (blood pressure, temperatur e and pulse rate), body weight and derived body mass index, and 
laboratory parameters (e.g., hematology , biochemistry, coagulation, thyroid function testing, urinalysis, and 
ADA results) will be presented at each time point using descriptive statistics (nu mber, arithmetic mean, 
standard error, standard deviation, 95% confidence interval of the mean, median, 1st and 3rd quartile, 
minimum, and maximum).  
Cross -tabulations of hematology , biochemistry results, and other parameters as described in the SAP will 
be prepared to examine the worst CTCAE toxicity grade / abnormality versus the grade / abnormality at 
baseline. Cross -tabulations of vital sign results and categorical laboratory results will be prepared to

All data from the  12-lead ECG will be analyzed  descriptively.  
For indications with an e xtension, the patients of stages 1 and 2 will be combined with the newly enrolled 
patients of the extension as combined dataset for analysis. Certain endpoints will in addition be analyzed 
in the subgroups "patients of stage 1+2" and "newly enrolled patien ts" to assess any effect of later 
enrollment on the outcome. All endpoints assessed in stages 1 and 2 will also be assessed for the extension 
as described above. Details will be given in the SAP.

11.1. Case Report Forms  
All pat ient data generated in the study, and documented on the source documents on site, will be recorded 
in each patient’s eCRFs. Data reported on the eCRFs that are derived from source documents should be 
consistent with the source documents or the discrepancie s should be explained. eCRFs will be considered 
complete when all missing and/ or incorrect data have been resolved and all safety data have been recorded.  
 
11.2. Source Documents  
Source documents are considered to be all information in original records and certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_1930], observations, data, or other activities in a clinical study necessary for the 
reconstruction and evaluation of the study.  
The Investigator and designees agree to maintain accurate eCRFs and source documentation as part of the 
case histories. Source documents are the originals of any documents used by [CONTACT_737], sub -
investigator, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/ institution that will allow verification of the existence of the patient and 
substantiate the integrit y of the data collected during the study.  
eCRFs must be completed only by  [CONTACT_751795]. All data entered into the eCRF 
also must be available in the source documents. The Investigator will allow designated representatives of 
the S ponsor and regulatory bodies to have direct access to the source documents to verify the data reported 
in the eCRFs.  
Each completed eCRF must be reviewed and digitally signed by [CONTACT_192164] a timely 
manner. The completed eCRF will be re viewed by [CONTACT_751796] a routine basis.  
 
11.3. Record Retention  
Study records and source documents need to be preserved for at least 15 years after the completion or 
discontinuation of/ withdrawal from the study, or [ADDRESS_1029200] approv al of a marketing application 
in an International Conference on Harmonization  (ICH) region, whichever is the longest time period.  
 
11.4. Drug Accountability  
Each time study drug is dispensed to a patient this must be recorded on a drug dispensing/accountability 
log. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_751742].  
At regular intervals the CRA(s) will perform a ‘drug reconciliation visit’, verifying if all study medication 
that has been shipped to the institute can be accounted for by [CONTACT_751797], dispensing and destruction.  
At the end of the study, it must be possible to reconcile delivery records with records of usage and destroyed 
or returned stock. It is essential that all study treatment be accounted for by [CONTACT_751798], a nd 
that any discrepancies are explained and documented.  
After accountability by [CONTACT_751799], a ll unused vials or medication 
not dispensed should be sent back to the sponsor or representative of the sponsor (details provided in the 
IMP Handling Manual). All used vials may be destroyed locally, if the destruction is fully documented, and 
following the site’s SOP for destruction of biological waste. Unused vials might be destroyed locally only 
upon approval by [CONTACT_1034].

0 Fully active, able to carry on all pre -disease performance without restriction  
1 Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a 
light or sedentary nature, e.g. light house work, office work  
2 Ambulatory and capable of all self -care but unable to carry out any work activities. Up and 
about more than 50% of waking hours  
3 Capable of only limited self -care, confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours

19.4. Imaging Protocols  
CT Imaging Protocol : The specific parameters of the CT imaging protocol are shown in Table 20, below.  
CT scan with contrast of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis is the recommended modality. If there are brain 
metastases/ tumors , an MRI scan of the head must also be performed. Patients with HNSCC will perform a 
head and neck CT.  
Intravenous contrast on CT and MRI exams is recommended when not medically contraindicated.   
Patients who have a contraindication to i.v. contrast may have MRI exams performed instead, except for 
exams of the chest.  In these cases, a non -contrast CT of the chest is recommended to evaluate the lung 
parenchyma.

  CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  Page 110 of 113 
 Note : The anatomical coverage must be complete at baseline and all follow -up visits.  Scans la cking 
complete anatomical coverage will be considered non -readable data and will exclude patients at screening.  
• MRI without and with i.v. contrast is the preferred modality for brain imaging. If there is a 
contraindication to MRI, then CT of the brain with out and with i.v. contrast is a second choice.  
• It is recommended that CT scans be performed with i.v. contrast. However,  scans should be 
performed according to local site imaging protocols based on the clinical status of the patient.  
MRI Imaging Protocol : MRI examinations should be performed with the recommended 1.5T or 3T MRI 
system. It is preferable that repeat MRI examinations are performed on the same type of T system. The 
specific parameters of the MRI imaging protocol will be provided in an imaging ma nual.  
Bone Scan Imaging Protocol : Radionuclide bone scans should only be performed when clinically 
indicated.  If bone scans were clinically indicated and positive at baseline , they should be repeated at the 
time of confirmation of response either if these lesions are not assessable on CT, or to confirm CR. The 
choice of radionuclide scanning, bone scan (i.e. Technetium -99m bone scintigraphy (Tc-99m bone scans )) 
should be based on site standard of care.  The specific parameters will be provided in an imaging manual.   
Color  Digital Photography:  Superficial clinical lesion (e.g., skin nodule) must be measured in at least one 
dimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurement wi ll be recorded) with a minimum size of  the 
longest axis being ≥ [ADDRESS_1029217] 1.1.  
If a patient has clinically -indicated skin lesion(s), the investigator site will perform color  digital 
photography of all skin l esions using a ruler held flush to the skin next to the longest diameter of the lesion 
to indicate the size of the lesion at every time point scheduled for radiological scans that a lesion is present. 
Once a lesion(s) is documented, the target area should be documented at every subsequent time point for 
the duration of the study. The imaging manual will include more detailed instructions for the site to follow 
during image capture.

Scan delay   Given 3ml/sec, start delay optimized for venous portal phase during abdominal 
scanning (routinely 70 seconds).  
If done locally, biphasic neck injection can be used.  
Contrast 
enhancement  The portal phase implies that the contrast reached the liver and po rtal venous system.

19.5. Definitions for Clinical and Laboratory AEs  
All AEs (clinical and laboratory) will be rated AEs and SAEs, according to the current National Cancer 
Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0)  
The applicable National Cancer Institute CTCAE, can be accessed using the following link: 
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm   
AEs will also be categorized  in terms of a) severity, b) causal relationship, c) action taken regarding to 
study treatment and d) outcome to date, as follows:  
 
a) Severity (Clinical Events Only) if not listed in the CTCAE v5.0  
Severities of clinical events are to be graded as follows:  
Code  Descriptor  Definition  
[ADDRESS_1029219] normal daily 
activity  
3  Severe  An event that is incapacitating with inability to work or do usual 
activity or inability to work or perform normal daily activity  
4  Life threatening or 
disabling  An event that is life threatening or disabling  
5  Fatal  An event that is fatal  
 
b) Causal Relationship  
TACTI -002  
Clinical Trial Protocol v5.0, final; [ADDRESS_1029220], and alternative 
explanations (e.g., other drugs, medical history, concomitant diseases). The expression “reasonable causal 
relationship” means to convey in general that there is evidence or argument to suggest a causal  
relationship. Causality assessment will be documented on the AE and SAE form.  
No reasonable possibility of causal relationship:  
• Unrelated:  
o There is no reasonable causal relationship between the investigational medicinal product 
and the event.  
Reasonable possibility of causal relationship:  
• Possibly related:  
o Event or laboratory test abnormality, with reasonable time relationship to drug intake.  
o Could also be explained by [CONTACT_19699].  
o Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
• Related:  
There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational medicinal product and the event.   
For CIOMS forms a binary form of causality assessment will be used as outlined in th e safety handling 
manual:  
• Yes:  There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational medicinal product and 
the AE  
• No: There is no reasonable causal relationship between the investigational medicinal product and 
the AE  
 
c) Action Taken Regardi ng any study treatment  
The investigators are to record the action taken regarding treatment agent using the following 4  categories:  
Code  Descriptor  Definition  
1  None  No change in study treatment was made  
2  Discontinued  The study treatment was permanently stopped  
3  Delayed/ 
Interrupted  Study treatment/study agent was  delayed or was temporarily stopped  
4  Partial/ Incomplete 
Dose  The complete Study treatment dosage was not given  
 
d) Outcome to Date  
The investigators are to record the outcome to date using the following 5 categories:  
TACTI -002  
Clinical Trial Protocol v5.0, final; [ADDRESS_1029221](s) are present. Residual effects of the 
AE are still present and observable  
3 Ongoing  The AE itself is still present and observable  
4 Death  Death  
5 Unknown

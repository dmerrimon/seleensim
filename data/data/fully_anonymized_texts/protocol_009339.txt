Sponsor:  National Marrow Donor Program® 
 
Principal Investigator (s): Javier Bolaños Meade, MD and Bronwen Shaw, MD, PhD  
 
Study Design:   This  is a multi -center, single arm Phase II study of hematopoietic cell 
transplantation  (HCT) using human leukocyte antigen ( HLA )-mismatched unrelated bone 
marrow transplantation donors  and post -transplantation cyclophosphamide  (PTCy), sirolimus 
and mycophenolate mof etil (MMF) for graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis  in patients 
with:  
1. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia  (ALL) /T lymphoblastic lymphoma  (T-LBL) , acute 
myelogenous leukemia  (AML) , acute b iphenotypic  leukemia (ABL), or acute 
undifferentiated leukemia  (AUL)  in 1st or subsequent complete remission ( CR) 
2. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) , fulfilling the following criteria:  
a. Subject s with de novo MDS who have or have previously had Intermediate -2 or 
High risk disease  as determined by [CONTACT_83501]

RCI BMT Protocol #[ADDRESS_91014]  is a potentially curative therapy for a variety of hematologic diseases, including 
the acute and chronic leukemias, myelodysplasia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma .  Clinical 
data now confirm that T -cells contained within the donor graft are capable of exerting a “graft -
versus -malignancy” effect  (Horowitz et al.,  1990) .  However , successful application of 
allogeneic HCT  to patients with hematologic diseases is limited by [CONTACT_83509], a life threatening complication. Development of 
GVHD is associated with lower OS and thus the prevention of GVHD is a cornerstone of 
allogeneic HCT  therapy  (Choi & Reddy, 2014) .  
 
Transplantation using cells from HLA -identical sibling donors results in the lowest incidence of 
GVHD, and such donors are prioritized; however, only approximately 30% of patients have an 
HLA -identical sibling donor. Alternative sources of stem cells for t hose without an HLA -
identical sibling include unrelated donors, umbilical cord blood and HLA -mismatched 
(haploidentical) related donors  (Kekre & Antin, 2014) . When using these donor sources, more 
intensive strategies are required to reduce the incidence of  rejection and/or GVHD resulting from 
greater differences in both major and minor histocompatibility antigens.  
 
Several methods may overcome the drawbacks associated with HLA -mismatched 
transplantation. In vivo T -cell depletion using alemtuzumab or anti -thymocyte globulin (ATG) is 
well recognized to reduce the incidence of both acute and chronic GVHD and graft rejection but 
is associated with delayed immune reconstitution and subsequent problems with infection, 
particular ly reactivation of viruses  (Potter et al. , 2014; Chakraverty et al., 2010; Walker  et al. , 
2016; Bacigalupo  et al. , 2006) .  
 
Several studies indicate that administering high dose, PTCy decreases the incidence of acute and 
chronic GVHD after HLA -mismatched transplantation without an adverse effect on immune 
reconstitution.  The immunobiologic rationale for administering Cy after HCT  is that recently 
activated, alloreactive T -cells (the cells most responsible for GVHD) are selectively sensitive to 
the toxic effects of this drug  (Mayumi, Umesue, & Nomoto, 1996) .  
 
This strategy was initially tested in HCT  using cells from partially HLA -mismatched (HLA -
haploidentical) relative s in two independent single center clinical trials with favorable results  
(Luznik et al., 2008) . Eighty -eight consecutive patients of all ages with high -risk hematologic 
malignancies were accrued to these trials between 1999 and 2006. Transplantation conditioning 
consisted of Cy 14.5 mg/kg/day IV on Days –6 and –5, fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day IV on Days –6 
to –2, and 200 cGy of TBI on Day –1.  On Da y 0, patients received donor bone marrow, which 
was obtained in a targeted collection of 4 x 108 nucleated cells/kg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_83423] a Gambro Spectra apheresis instrument. On Day +3, 50 mg/kg 
Cy was administered. A subset of patients received an additional dose of Cy on Day +4.  
Pharmacologic prophylaxis of GVHD was initiated on the day following completion of PTCy.  
All patients received tacrolimus and MMF.  Patients received filgrastim 5 mcg/kg daily starting 
at Day+5 and continuing until recovery of neutrophils to >1000/ L for three days. The outcomes 
of these studies showed: graft failure in 18% (73% of whom had measurable disease); complete 
donor chimerism (>95%) in patients with sustained engraftment by [ADDRESS_91015] ;

NMDP IRB Approv ed cumulative incidences of grades II -IV and III -IV aGVHD by [CONTACT_2006] +200 of 35% and 10%, 
respectively; cumulative incidences of overall and extensive cGVHD in the first year after HCT  
of 22% and 14%, respectively. The cumulative incidences of non -relapse mortality (NRM) at 
[ADDRESS_91016]  were 13% and 19%, respectively.  The cumulative incidences of 
relapse at [ADDRESS_91017]  were 50% and 57%, respectively.  At a median follow -up of 
survivors of 817 days (range, 112 -1808 days), the actuarial OS of the entire group at 1 and 2 
years were 45% and 35%, respectively.   
 
Based on these encouraging results, the BMT CTN initiated a Phase II study to test this approach 
in a multi -center setting ( Brunstein, et al., 2011 ). Fifty patients (<70 years) with high -risk 
leukemia or lymphoma were included. Only one patient had primary graft failure and all 
engrafting patients had 100% donor chimerism at Day+56. The 100 -day cumulative incidence of 
grade II -IV aGVHD was 32%.The 1 -year cumulative incidences of NRM and relapse were 7% 
and 45%, respectively, with 1 -year probabilities of OS and PFS of 62% and 48%, respectively.  
 
Some disease states continue to have a higher non -engraftment rate in this setting. U npublished 
data from Johns Hopkins University reveals that in the haploidentical non-myeloablative setting, 
patients with active CLL have a [ADDRESS_91018] found 
higher rates of graft failure in patients with CLL in the non -myeloablative setting (Delgado et al., 
2006) . 
 
These studies, and others, show that use of PTCy with additional post -HCT  immune suppression 
allows successful outcomes using very mismatched donors. Clinical practice has now evolved to 
include PTCy as standard of care GVHD prophylaxis for patients receiving cells from 
haploidentical donors  (Bashey & Solomon, 2014) . However, there are several drawbacks to use 
of haploidentical related donors. Related donors often fall outside the norms used for accepting 
unrelated donors (i.e. >60 or <18 , or presence of co morbidities ) with several important 
consequences for both the patient and the donor.  
 
The use of older donors is associated with worse clinical out comes for recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  Kollman et al . 
(2001)  showed, in a retrospective analysis of 6978 unrelated bone marrow transplants,  that 
patients receiving cells from an unrelated donor under the age of 30 had significantly better 
survival than those with older donors  ( p = 0.0002 ). Younger donors were associated with a 
significantly lower risk of severe aGVHD among HLA -mismatched pairs. Incidences at 
Day+100 were 30%, 41%, and 40%, respectively, with donors aged 18 to 30 years, 31 to 45 
years, and more than 45 years ( p < 0.0001). A significantly lower risk of cGVHD was also found 
with younger donors (p  = 0.02).  These data were confirmed in a later study (Kollman et al., 
2015) including 6349 unrelated donor transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], which again showed that using 
donors under the age of 32  conferred a significant survival advantage (p  <0.001). As in the 
previous study, the incidence of GVHD was lower with a younger donor. This publication 
included a recent validation subset of 4690 HLA -matched (8/8 HLA -A, -B, -C, and –DRB1 loci) 
donor -recipi[INVESTIGATOR_83424] a linear impact of donor age on patient survival, with 
younger donor ages associated with higher survival (p  = .006). Importantly, all three of these 
studies showed that the effect of donor age was present irrespective of the degree  of HLA 
matching between the pair, suggesting that it is an ind ependent  risk factor for survival and 
GVHD.

Finally, a  European Blood and Marrow Transplant group study (Kroger et al., 2012) of 719 MDS 
patients over the age of 50 years showed that patients transplanted from a younger unrelated 
donor (<30 years) had significantly higher 5 -year OS in comparison with those transplanted from 
a related donor or an older unrelated donor (>30 years): 40 % vs 33 % vs 24 % (p = 0.04).  Other 
data do not confirm this finding of better outcomes with an unrelated compared to a related 
donor (Alousi  et al. , 2013).  
 
Additionally, other non -HLA donor selection factors (such as ABO status, sex and parity), which 
are variably associated with differences in HCT outcomes, can often not be prioritized in the 
related donor setting  (Kollman et al., 2015) . Although there is controversy about the impact of 
ABO matching on HCT outcome, large recent CIBMTR studies suggest a surviv al advantage 
with ABO matching (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_43221], et al., 2014).  Although the impact of ABO matching  has not been 
studied in the haploidentical setting, it is an i mportant logistical issue when transplanting bone 
marrow, as mismatching requires red cell depleting procedures, which may result in a loss of 
stem cells, potentially increasing the risk of poor engraftment. The ability to sel ect amongst 
donors to avoid ABO  mismatching is an attractive option, seldom available when choosing 
among related donors. Use of female donors is also associated with reduced engraftment and 
parous donors are associated with increased cGVHD  (Shaw  et al. , 2005; Kollman  et al. , 2001) . In 
the haploidentical PTCy setting, transplanting female donor bone marrow into a male recipi[INVESTIGATOR_83425]  (Kongtim, Cao, & Ciurea,  2016) . 
 
There are also potential ethical and logistic considerations when using related donors. While any 
potential coercion and conflicts of interest are removed in the unrelated donor setting due to 
anonymity between patients and donor and the separation of pati ent and donor care, this is not 
always the case in the related donor setting. Additionally, older donors are much more likely to 
have co -existent health issues, which may increase the risks of adverse events  (AEs)  post 
donation or require peripheral blood rather than bone marrow harvest  (Anthias, et al., 2015a) , 
though most of the experience with PTCy is with HCT using bone marrow grafts . Recently, 
concerns have been raised about the psychologic impact of donation in pediatric donors  (Bitan et 
al., 2015) . Conflicts of interest may arise where the donor and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_83426]. Although health assessment and consent are not separated in many centers, this is 
almost always  not the case with the bone marrow harvest, since  only transplant  teams are trained 
in this intervention  (Anthias et al., 2015b) . There is evidence that donor AEs are increased in 
centers where harvest numbers are low (Shaw et al., 2015) which may be an issue in centers 
performing only infrequent bone marrow harvest on related donors. In this protocol utilizing 
unrelated donors, bone marrow collection will be centralized using facilities performing large 
numbers of procedures for the NMDP. Operators are likely to have appropriate levels of 
expertise thus minimizing  donor AEs. 
 
A perceived restriction in the use of unrelated donors is the time necessary to find a donor, a 
delay which is thought to be associated with inferior patient outcomes. The ability to select a 
MMUD would remove this barrier by [CONTACT_83510], thereby [CONTACT_83511] a donor available to donate in a timely 
manner . The ability to select a MMUD would also benefit patients from ethnic minorities who 
are also more likely to find a mismatched tha n a matched unrelated donor on international donor

NMDP IRB Approv ed registries.  With currently over 20 million unrelated donors listed on the international donor 
registries, multiple mismatched dono rs are expected to be available  for each patient ; thus, donor 
selection can be optimized and expedited.  
 
A recent single center feasibility study at Johns Hopkins University is evaluating the use of 
MMUD  bone marrow transplantation using PTCy, sirolimus and MMF to prevent GVHD 
(Kasamon  et al. , 2015) . The conditioning regimen used is non -myeloablative and includes 
fludarabine, Cy and low dose TBI with two doses of PTCy (Day+4 and +5). Sirolimus and MMF 
are started on Day+5. The primary objectives include estimating that [ADDRESS_91019] (N=9 ) received 
the HCT  for AML . The unrelated grafts had a median of 2 HLA mismatches and included three 
7/10 matches, one 6/10 match, and one 5/10 match. HLA -C mismatch was present in 10 grafts 
(63%) and complete -DP mismatch in 6 (38%).  By [CONTACT_83512], 25% of p atien ts 
were high risk, 69% intermediate risk, and 6% low risk; 69% were in CR at time of transplant . 
The median graft doses were 3.36 x 108 total nucleated cells/kg and 3.87 x 107 CD3+ cells/kg. 
All p atien ts engrafted, and there were no non -relapse deaths or prohibitive toxicities. By 
[CONTACT_83513] -risk analysis, the estimated cumulative incidence of neutrophil recovery was 100% by 
[CONTACT_2006]+29, with a median of 20 (range 14 -29) days. Platelet recovery ≥ 20,000/µL was 100% by 
[CONTACT_2006]+46, with a median of 32 (range 12 -46) day s. By [CONTACT_2006]+60, 14/15 (93%) evaluable patients 
achieved full donor chimerism in either CD3+ or unsorted cells. Notably, there were no cases of  
grade III-IV aGVHD. Grade ≥ II aGVHD was limited to 2 cases of skin -only grade II aGVHD 
and 1 case of grade II skin and ungradable visceral aGVHD. By [CONTACT_83513] -risk analysis, the 
estimated cumulative incidence of grade II aGVHD was 12% at Day+100 (90% confidence 
interval ( CI), 0-27%) and 19% at Day+180 (90% CI, 2 -37%). The cumulative incidence of any 
cGVHD at 1 and 2 years was 7% (90% CI, 0 -18%). Critical illness prior to relapse was limited to 
1 case of sepsis which resolved. With a 3 -year median follow -up, the probability of PFS was 
56% at 1-year and 50% at 3 years. The cumulative incidence  of relapse was 44% at 1-year. 
Median OS has not been reached, with an estimated 1 -year and 3 -year OS of 68% .  
 
In order to broaden the expanded access which this protocol will provide to patients without a 
matched donor to additional patients, we have included the option of myeloablative conditioning 
(Shabbir -Moosajee, Lombardi, & Ciurea, 2015).  Although this PTCy approach has not been 
tested using mismatched unrelated donors, there is evidence for its efficacy in the haploidentical 
setting . Data  published in abstract ( Symons  et al. , 2015) from Johns Hopkins University is 
presented here (personal communication: Heat her Symons). [ADDRESS_91020] been transplanted 
using the PTCy, CNI and MMF approach using unmanipulated BM from haploidentical donors. 
73 patients received Busulfan (Day -6, -5, -4 and -3, adjusted to AUC) and Cytoxan (day -2 and -
1, 50mg/kg/day) (Symons  et al. , 2015); [ADDRESS_91021] CyTBI conditioning (Thomas  et al. , 
1977).  Median patient age was 42 (range: 1 -65), and transplants were done for diverse 
hematological malignancies. 80/88 patients were eligible for assessment of chimerism at day 60,

NMDP IRB Approv ed with 91% having >95% donor chimerism at that time. Rates of grade II -IV and III -IV acute 
GVHD were 17% and &% respectively. Chronic GVHD occurred in 15% of patients (5% 
moderate/severe). The TRM at 100 days and 1-year was 6% and 11%, and relapse at the 1-year 
and 3 years was 36% and 44%. Overall survival at 1-year is 72%. Based on these encouraging 
results we include the option of a myeloablative approach in this study.  
 
Given that this is the only current experience with PT Cy in the unrelated donor  setting, and the 
lack of increased toxicity with PTCy and sirolimus as described above, we will use a harmonized 
approach to GVHD prophylaxis for all patients in this study irrespective of conditioning 
regimen. This approach is also supported by [CONTACT_83514]  (Fitzhugh et al., 2013) . Additionally , sirolimus promotes Treg expansion, and may 
inhibit graft rejection and GVHD by [CONTACT_6561] T -cell tolerance  (Cutler & Antin, 2004 ). There 
may also be positive antiviral and graft versus leukemia effects ( Kasamon et al., 2012).  
 
Based upon the encouraging safety and efficacy data from the Johns Hopkins University study  and 
the potential advantages of using HLA -mismatched unrelated versus related donors , we wish to 
test the safety and anti -tumor efficacy of HLA MMUD bone marrow transplantation with PTCy, 
sirolimus and MMF in a national, multi -center Phase II trial.

donors being considered for HIV-positive  patients . 
 
The MMUD selection algorithm (Appendix J) is the proposed search strategy that prioritizes 
donor age, CMV serostatus, and ABO match over HLA match. This strategy should not be 
considered the prescribed search strategy for potential study subjects. Study sites may instead 
utilize institutional donor selection practices.

MMF  
MMF begins on Day +5, at least 24 hours after completion of PTCy. The  MMF dose is 15 
mg/kg PO TID ( according to adjusted IBW  (Appendix K) ) with total daily dose not to 
exceed 3  g (i.e. maximum 1 g PO TID). An equivalent IV dose (1:1 conversion) may  
instead be given. Dose modification guidelines are provided in section 2.6.4. MMF  
prophylaxis is discontinued after the last dose on Day +35, or may be continued if there is  
GVHD.  
 
Growth factors  
G-CSF (filgrastim) or a biosimilar begins on Day +5 at a dose of 5 mcg/kg/day ( according 
to actual body weight) IV or  SC (rounding to the nearest vial dose is allowed), until the 
ANC is ≥ 1,000/mm3 over the course of 3 consecutive days. Additional G -CSF may be 
administered as  warranted. Pegfilgrastim (Neulasta®) and granulocyte -macrophage 
colony -stimulating factor ( GM-CSF) or their biosimilars are not permitted.  
 
Post-HCT  donor cellular infusion (D CI) 
Prophylactic post -HCT  DCI (for persistent detectable malignancy, prophylaxis in the 
absence of detectable malignancy, or mixed donor chimerism) is not permitted before 
Day+100. Any use of DCI, and the indication for DCI  must  be recorded.  
 
Other post -HCT  therapy  
Preemptive systemic cancer therapy is permitted post -HCT  (e.g., deoxyribonucleic acid 
(DNA )-methyltransferase  inhibitor, tyrosine kinase inhibitor, rituximab for CD20+ 
malignancy). Intrathecal chemotherapy and  consolidative radiation therapy are permitted. 
The use of such post -HCT  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_83432]. 
 
RCI BMT Protocol #[ADDRESS_91034] be given with busulfan containing regimens per institutional 
guidelines.  
Herbal supplements and nutraceuticals are contraindicated.  
HIV-positive  subjec ts: ARV is only effective when administered in combination and with 
consistency. Single agent therapy or repeated interruptions in therapy lead to drug 
resistance. The ARV guidelines (Appendices D and E)  are designed to minimize the 
possibility of drug interactions with high dose chemotherapy. ARV should be 
administered only when it is anticipated that the ARV regimen can be taken on a 
consistent basis (i.e., conditioning  regimen toxicities such as nausea and mucositis will 
not interfere with dosing s chedules). In cases where the subject receives an HCT using a 
CCR5delta32 homozygous donor, ARV should be continued through  at least  Day+100.  
• Subjec ts on RIC Regimens : Subjec ts will continue on ARV therapy.

 RCI BMT Protocol #[ADDRESS_91042] common toxicities for therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44809]. See the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA )-approved package insert for each drug for a 
comprehensive list of AEs. 
 
Busulfan  (Busulfex®)  
Busulfan (1, 4 -dimethanesulfonoxybutane) is an alkylating agent. The drug is extensively 
metabolized by [CONTACT_83524].  
 
Busulfan toxicities  include:  
• Gastrointestinal: nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, 
anorexia, dyspepsia, mucositis , stomatitis  
• Hepatobiliary: VOD/SOS  
• Neurologic: h eadache, insomnia, seizures , dizziness  
• Cardiovascular: hypertension, hypotension and tachycardia  
• Pulmonary: dyspnea, lung fibrosis , cough  
• Endocrine and metabolic: electrolyte imbalance  
• Genitourinary: amenorrhea,  dysmenorrhea,  infertility  
• Dermatologic: rash, urticarial  
• Miscellaneous: rhinorrhea, cataracts , fluid retention  
 
PK monitoring of Busulfan is required  to achieve a daily AUC target of 4800 -5300 
μM*min (Perkins et al., 2012 ). Busulfan  dosing is based on adjusted IBW (Appendix K), 
unless the subject weighs less than IBW, in which case dosing is based on  actual body 
weight.  
 
Fludarabine (Fludara®) 
Fludarabine is a fluorinated nucleoside analog. After phosphorylation to fluoro -ara-
adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) the drug  appears to incorporate into DNA and inhibit DNA 
polymerase alpha, ribonucleotide reductase and  DNA primase, thus inhibiting DNA 
synthesis. Excretion of f ludarabine is impaired in subjec ts with  impaired renal function.  
 
Fludarabine toxicities include:  
• Hematologic: hematopoietic suppression including neutropenia with increased 
risk of infection and immunosuppression  
• Neurologic: peripheral neuropathy and encephalopathy manifested by [CONTACT_29429], 
weakness, paresthesia, visual disturbances, somnolence and coma  
• Gastrointestinal: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and stomatitis  
• Dermatologic: rash, urticarial  
• Pulmonary: cough, idiopathic pneumonitis , dyspnea  
• Miscellaneous: fever   
 RCI BMT Protocol #15 -MMUD  
  Version 4.0 March 14, 2018  
42 
NMDP IRB-2016 -0365  
NMDP IRB Approv ed Dose adjustments of fludarabine are required for renal insufficiency if the estimated CrCl 
is < 60  mL/min ( per section 2. 6.1). Fludarabine BSA dosing is based on adjusted ideal 
body weight (IBW) (Appendix K), unless the subject weighs less than IBW, in which 
case dosing is based on actual body weight.  
 
Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan®) 
Cyclophosphamide  (Cy) is an alkylating agent. It is activated by [CONTACT_83525] 
P450 system to  cytotoxic metabolites, which form cross -links with DNA. It is cell cycle -
nonspecific.  
 
Cy toxicities include:  
• Gastroi ntestinal: nausea, vomiting, anorexia , stomatitis, diarrhea, abdominal pain  
• Hematologic: myelosuppression , thrombocytopenia , carcinogenesis , anemia  
• Cardiovascular: severe chronic heart failure characterized by [CONTACT_83526], 
pericardial effusions, diffuse voltage decrease on ECG and decreased LVEF  
• Genitourinary: hemorrhagic cystitis (prevented by [CONTACT_83527]) and gonadal function impairment , amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, 
infertility, damage to unborn baby  
• Pulmonary: rare pulmonary toxicity , lung fibrosis  
• Dermatologic: alopecia , rash, urticarial  
• Miscellaneous: fluid retention , allergic reaction  
 
Dose adjustments for Cy will not be made.  
 
Pre-HCT Cy : dosed according to adjusted IBW (Appendix K), unless the subject weighs 
less than IBW, in which case Pre-HCT Cy  will be dosed according to actual weight.  
 
PTCy : dosed according to IBW, unless the subject weighs less than IBW, in which case 
PTCy  will be dosed according to actual body weight.  
 
 
Mesna  (Mesnex®) 
Mesna (sodium -2-mercaptoethanesulphonate) is a prophylactic agent used to prevent 
hemorrhagic  cystitis induced by [CONTACT_83528] ( Cy and ifos famide). It has no 
intrinsic  cytotoxicity and no antagonistic effects on chemotherapy. Mesna binds with 
acrolein, the urotoxic  metabolite produced by [CONTACT_83528], to produce a non -
toxic thioether and slows the rat e of acrolein formation by [CONTACT_12787] 4 -hydroxy 
metabolites of oxa zophosphorines.  
 
Mesna t oxicities  include :  
• Cardiovascular: hypotension  
• Dermatologic: rash, urticarial  
• Gastrointestinal : nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, altered taste  
• Neurologic: headache, joint or limb pain  
• Miscellaneous: fatigue  
 RCI BMT Protocol #[ADDRESS_91043]  Mesna : pre-transplant use of mesna and dosing will be done according to 
institutional standards. A recommended approach is as follows: mesna IV dose ≥ 80% of 
the total daily dose of Cy and given in divided doses 30 minutes before and at 3, 6, and 8 -
9 hours after completion of C y. Mesna is dosed according to adjusted IBW (Appendix 
K), unless the subject weighs less than IBW, in which case mesna will be dosed 
according to actual weight.  
 
Post-HCT  Mesna : the recommended approach is mesna IV dose ≥ 80% of the total daily 
dose of Cy, given in divided doses [ADDRESS_91044] weighs less than IBW, in 
which case mesna will be dosed according to actual body weight.   
 
 
MMF  (Cellcept®) 
MMF is an ester prodrug of the active immunosuppressant mycophenolic acid (MPA).  
 
MMF t oxicities include:  
• Hematologic: pancytopenia  with increased risk of infection and 
immunosuppression , anemia  
• Cardiovascular: hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia  
• Dermatologic: rash, urticarial  
• Gastrointestinal : nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, altered taste, 
hematemesis,  hematochezia  
• Neurologic: headache, joint or limb pain, dizziness, insomnia, Progressive 
Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), tremors  
• Genitourinary : miscarriage, birth defects, damage to unborn baby, limited 
effectiveness of birth control  
• Endocrine and metabolic: hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], hyperglycemia, electrolyte imbalances  
• Pulmonary:  dyspnea  
• Miscellaneous: fatigue, changes in vision, edema , unusual contusions, allergic 
reaction, leg cramps  
 
Drug interactions: MMF activity is decreased with oral antacids and cholestyramine. 
There are no  pharmacokinetic interactions with cotrimoxazole, oral contraceptives, or 
cyclosporine. Acyclovir or  ganciclovir blood levels may increase due to competition for 
tubular secretion. High doses of  salicylates or other highly protein -bound drugs may 
increase the free fraction of MPA and  exaggerate the potential for myelosuppression.  
 
Dose adjustments: No dose adjustments are required for liver dysfunction. For renal 
insufficiency,  MMF dosing should not be modified unless dialysis is needed, in which 
case MMF can be reduced  to 25 -50% of the starting dose.

  Version 4.0 March 14, 2018  
44 
NMDP IRB-2016 -0365  
NMDP IRB Approv ed The MMF dose is 15 mg/kg PO TID (adjusted IBW (Appendix K)) with total daily dose 
not to exceed 3 g (i.e. maximum 1 g PO TID). An equivalent IV dose (1:1 conversion) 
may instead be given.  
 
 
Sirolimus (rapamycin, Rapamune®) 
Sirolimus is an immunosuppressant that inhibits cytokine -stimulated T -cell activation and  
proliferation, and also inhibits antibody formation.  
 
Drug formulations: The mean bioavailability of sirolimus after administration of the 
tablet is ~27%  higher than the oral solution. Sirolimus oral tablets are not bioequivalent 
to the oral solution. Clinical  equivalence has been demonstrated at the 2 -mg dose level; 
however, it is not known if higher doses  are clinically equivalent on a mg to mg basis.  
a. Sirolimus oral solution: sirolimus oral solution (1 mg/mL) should be stored 
protected  from light and refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). For dilution, 
the appropriate dose  should be measured using an amber oral syringe, then added 
to a glass or plastic container  that holds at least 60 mL. Before taking the dose, it 
should be diluted with water or orange  juice then taken immediately; it should not 
be diluted with grapefruit juice. The syringe  should be discarded after one use. 
Sirolimus oral solution provided in bottles may develop a  slight haze when 
refrigerated, which does not affect product quality; allow the product to  stand at 
room temperature and shake gently until the haze disappears.  
b. Sirolimus tablets: sirolimus tablets are available in 1 mg and 2 mg tablets that

c Lipid -lowering agent may be required; consider if fasting serum triglycerides are > 2.[ADDRESS_91045], and  recommend

Drug interactions:  
• Sirolimus is known to be a substrate for both cytochrome CYP3A4 and 
Pglycoprotein.  
 RCI BMT Protocol #15 -MMUD  
  Version 4.0 March 14, 2018  
46 
NMDP IRB-2016 -0365  
NMDP IRB Approv ed • Agents that may increase sirolimus levels include tri -azole drugs (especially  
voriconazole and posaconazole*), amiodarone, calcium channel blockers, 
macrolide antibiotics (but  not azithromycin), micafungin, gastrointestinal 
prokinetic agents (cisapride, metoclopramide),  cimetidine, cyclosporine, 
grapefruit juic e, and HIV protease inhibitors.  
• Agents that may decrease  sirolimus levels include anticonvulsants 
(carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] , phenobarbital, phenytoin), rifamycins, St.  John’s Wort.  
Dose adjustments:  
• The sirolimus dose is adjusted to maint ain a serum trough level of 5 -15 ng/mL.   
• Changes in levels due to altered bioavailability should be apparent wit hin 24 -48 
hours.  
• For sirolimus  without CNI as in this study, a 20 -25% reduction of sirolimus dose 
is recommended for trough levels  >12 – 18 ng/mL, and a 20 -25% increase is 
recommended for trough levels < 5 ng/mL.  
• Renal failure does not affect the excretion of sirolimus.  
• Excretion is reduced in liver failure;  impaired hepatic function should prompt 
consideration of reduction in sirolimus maintenance doses  but no dose adjustment 
of the loading dose is necessary.  
 
Due to extreme interactions with triazole antifungal agents (fluconazole, itraconazole, 
clotrimazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, ketoconazole) sirolimus should be 
administered cautiously together with fluconazole, itraconazole, or posaconazole, 
and with extreme caution if administered together with voriconazole .  If co -
administration is unavoidable, then the dose of sirolimus should be greatly reduced when 
used in combination with an azole  antifungal medication as recommended in  Table 2.6 D 
(Pi[INVESTIGATOR_43221], Alousi,  & MacMillan, 2015) and that there should be very frequent monitoring of 
trough concentrations of sirolimus in whole blood.  Sirolimus concentrations should be 
measured upon initiation, during co-administration, and at discontinuation of antifungal 
treatment, with sirolimus doses adjusted accordingly.

when the true OS percentage is 65%, there is 80% power to rule out an OS percentage of ≤ 45%.  
This can equivalently be viewed as t esting the following hypothesis: H o: p = 0. 45 versus H 1: p ≠

5.5.2 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
Progression -free survival  
Death or relapse/progression will be considered events, and the PFS distribution will be 
estimated by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier curve, starting from the time of HCT .  A 90% CI will be 
constructed at Day+180 and +365.   
 
Transplant -related mortality  
TRM is death occurring in subject s in the absence of disease progression or relapse.  A 
cumulative incidence curve will be computed along with a 90% CI at Day+100, +180, 
and +365.  Progression/relapse will be considered as a competing risk.   
 
Cumulative i ncidence of neutrophil  recovery  
To assess the incidence of neutrophil recovery  from day of HCT , a cumulative incidence 
curve will be computed along with a 90% CI.  Death prior to neutrophil recovery  will be 
considered a competing risk.  
Cumulative i ncidence of platelet recovery  
 RCI BMT Protocol #[ADDRESS_91066] , a cumulative incidence 
curve will be computed along with a 90% CI.  Death prior to platelet recovery will be 
considered a competing risk.  
 
Cumulative i ncidence of primary graft failure  
The frequency and proportion of subject s experie ncing primary graft failure by D ay+56 
will be described with a 90 % CI.  Death prior to primary graft failure  will be considered a 
competing risk.  
Donor Chimerism  
Peripheral blood donor chime rism will be measured at Day+28, +56, +100, +180, and 
+365.  The degree of donor chimerism will be summarized at each time point using 
descriptive statistics.   
Peripheral blood chimerism at Day +56 
The percentage of patients with peripheral blood chimerism  >95% by [CONTACT_2006] +[ADDRESS_91067] day of aGVHD onset at a certain grade will be used to calculate a cumulative 
incidence curve for that aGVHD grade.  An overall cumulative incidence curve will be 
computed along with a 90% CI at Day+[ADDRESS_91068] , a cumulative 
incidence curve will be computed along with a 90% CI at Day+180 and 365 .  Death and 
relapse prior to occurrence of cGVHD will be considered as competing risks.  
 
Cumulative i ncidence s of viral reactivations  and infections  
To assess the i ncidence of CMV, EBV, BK, ADV , and HHV -6 viral activations  and 
infections , a cumulative incidence curve will be computed along with a 90% CI at 
Day+100, +180 and +365. 
 
Cumulative incidence of relapse/progression  
To assess the incidence of progression/relapse from day of HCT , a cumulative incidence 
curve will be computed along with a 90% CI at Day+180 and +365.  Death prior to 
progression/relapse will be considered as a competing risk.   
 
Cumulative incidence s of TMA and VOD /SOS  
The cumulative incidence of TMA  and VOD /SOS  will be described in transplanted 
subject s, treating death as a competing risk.

6.2 Adverse Event and Unanticipated Problem Reporting  
6.2.1 Event Definitions  
Adverse Event  – Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical 
treatment or procedure regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical 
treatment or procedure (attribution of definite, probable, possible, unlikely, or unrelated).  
 
Expected Adverse Event – Any AE listed in the informed consent, product inserts, or 
study materials.  
 
Life-Threatening Adverse Event – Any AE that places the participant, in view of the 
investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) – Any AE that results in any of the following outcomes: 
death, a life threatening AE, in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_83460] #15 -MMUD  
  Version 4.0 March 14, 2018  
61 
NMDP IRB-2016 -0365  
NMDP IRB Approv ed hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect.  
 
Unexpected Adverse Event  – Any AE, the specificity or severity of which is NOT listed 
in the study protocol, product inserts or informed consent document.  
 
Unanticipated Probl em – any incident, experience, or outcome that meets  all of the 
following criteria:  
1. unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the 
Institutional Review Board  (IRB)-approved research protocol and informed 
consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being 
studied;  
2. related or possibly related to participation in the research; and  
3. suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was 
previously known or recognized.  
 
See Appendix L  for further details and examples.  
 
Attribution  – The determination of whether an AE is related to a medical treatment or 
procedure.  Attribution categories:  
• Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study procedure/treatment(s).  
• Probable – The AE is likely related  to the study procedure/treatment.  
o The AE is not likely to be caused by [CONTACT_423]’s underlying medical 
condition or other concomitant therapy, and the nature of the AE or the 
temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and study 
procedure /treatment administration lead the investigator to believe that 
there is a reasonable chance of causal relationship.  
• Possible – The AE may be related  to the study procedure/treatment(s).  
o The AE could be attributed to the subject’s underlying medical 
condition or other concomitant therapy, but the nature of the AE or the 
temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and study 
procedure/ treatment administration lead the investigator to believe that 
there could be a causal relationship.  
• Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related  to the study procedure/treatment(s).  
• Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study 
procedure/treatment(s).  
o The AE is most plausibly explained by [CONTACT_423]’s underlying medical 
condition or other concomitant therapy, or the AE has no plausible 
biological relationship to study procedure/ treatment.  
 
Grade  – Severity of the AE.  All toxicities will be graded using the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE) Version 4.03.  The CTCAE includes 
a grading (severity) scale for each AE term :

assess whether there are safety concerns that should be referred to the DSMB.   
 
Any concern regarding the type or frequency of an AE will be reported to  the DSMB 
when  warranted. The DSMB will determine if additional review is required and make 
recommendations to the study team concerning continuation of the study.  If the DSMB  
recommends modification of protocol documents and/or determines that the event affects 
the conduct of the overall trial, the event will be reported to the NMDP IRB. The 
Principal Investigators and the Protocol Team will meet to determine prot ocol 
modifications bas ed on DSMB  recommendations.  
 
The NMDP IRB will report events to regulatory agencies following NMDP IRB 
processes and procedures. CIBMTR will distribute reports of such events and any 
protocol modifications to study sites and study site  Principal Investigators will be

NMDP PROCEDURE FOR IDENTIFIC ATION OF CCR5DELTA32 MUTATION 
HOMOZYGOUS DONORS RELATED TO THIS PROTOCOL  
 
Background  
A recent case report by Hütter et al. (NEJM, 2009) documented the outcome of an allogeneic 
HCT performed for the treatment of AML in which the well -matched donor was selected for 
homozygosity for the CCR5delta32 mutation. The recipi[INVESTIGATOR_83466]-
infected prior to developi[INVESTIGATOR_83467] a donor could confer natural resistance to HIV infection in the 
transplanted hematopoietic and immune cells. A single HLA -matched donor hom ozygous for 
the CCR5delta32 mutation was identified among approximately [ADDRESS_91087] for the treatment of the patient’s AML was performed using that donor. 
Following HCT , the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s ARV medications were discontinued and viral titers were 
monitored. No subsequent recrudescence of HIV replication was detected. The recipi[INVESTIGATOR_83468] a second HCT using the same donor 
was successfully performed with c ontinued primary disease remissio n and HIV control with 
undetectable HIV viral loads two years following the second HCT (Hütter, personal 
communication).  
 
The [ADDRESS_91088] 
incidence in Northern Europeans (Galvani and Novembre, 2005); from these data, it is 
apparent that non -European populations manifest hom ozygosity too rarely to warrant 
evaluation. Additionally, it is also known that donor ethnicity strongly correlates with 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_83469].  
 
In view of that fact that this protocol allows the use of HLA MMUDs  there is a statistically 
higher chance of finding a CCR5 delta [ADDRESS_91089] the information available at the time of the search. No 
additional sample collection  or informed consent is required  for these donors .

RCI BMT Protocol #[ADDRESS_91091]’s conditioning regimen must be reviewed with the Treatment Review Committee. 
This review should typi[INVESTIGATOR_83470] [ADDRESS_91092]’s 
medication regimen.   
 
The treating institution will review subject s with the Treatment Review Committee prior to 
the initiation of HCT therapy by a review panel composed of experts in HIV drug resistance, 
HIV care, pharmacology, HCT infectious diseases and oncology. Recommendations for HCT 
are based on the following supporting documentation:  
 
− Current diagnosis  
− Past medical history  
− Prior ARV history  
− Documented ARV drug toxicities  
− Drug allergies  
− History of HLA B57 antigen testing, if available  
− Current creatinine and liver function test s  
− Past and recent HIV drug resistance test results  
− Current ARV drug regimen  
− Current concomitant medications  
 
The Committee will review available past and current HIV -[ADDRESS_91093] therapy to allow sufficient time for implementation of recommendations for the ARV 
regimen.  The Treatment Review form and de -identified copi[INVESTIGATOR_83471] (noted above) must be submitted to the CIBMTR Protocol Coordinator. The 
CIBMTR Protocol Coordinator will then provide these materials to the Treatment Review 
Committee to conduct their review.  
 
 
 
 
RCI BMT Protocol #[ADDRESS_91094] will include prophylaxis 
for:  
1. Bacteria : In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_83472].  
2. Pneumocystis Jiroveci Pneumonia:  Prophylaxis will be administered until CD4 counts are 
>[ADDRESS_91095]  
tolerance (nausea, allergic reaction, G6PD or other considerations) may contraindicate a 
particular regimen. Choices in order of preference are: 1) TMP/SMX 1 double -strength 
daily; 2) TMP/SMX 1 single strength  daily; 3) dapsone 100 mg daily (may be decreased 
to 50 mg daily if given in combination with pyrimethamine as described below for 
toxoplasmosis prophylaxis; 4) atovaquone 1500 mg daily; and, 5) aerosolized or IV 
pentamidine monthly, or per institutional standard.  
3. Toxoplasmosis:  Subject s on TMP/SMX do not require additional prophylaxis. If 
toxoplasma IgG is positive and TMP/SMX cannot be used subject s should be 
prophylaxed for at least [ADDRESS_91096] and until CD4>100. This prophylaxis may 
be either: 1) dapsone 50 mg PO daily and pyrimethamine 50 mg/week and leucovorin 25 
mg/week or 2) atovaquone 1500 mg daily plus pyrimethamine 25 mg/day plus leucovorin 
10 mg/day. Since all medications for toxoplasmosis prophylaxis are oral, and some 
subject s may be unable to ta ke PO medications in the peri -HCT period, polymerase chain 
reaction ( PCR ) for toxoplasmosis should be checked at least weekly whenever 
prophylaxis must be held in toxoplasma IgG positive subject s for more than a week and 
the CD4 is < 100.  
4. Fungi : Anti -fungal prophylaxis will be per local institutional practice. It is noted that in 
histoplasma endemic areas (Midwest and Puerto Rico) antifungal prophylaxis is standard 
for CD4 <[ADDRESS_91097] and until 
CD4>150 ( see Appendix F for detailed interactions with ARVs ).  
5. Herpes simplex virus ( HSV )/varicella –zoster virus  (VZV ): One of the following 
regimens should be used for 1-year after HCT, or per institutional standard, unless the 
subject  remains on immunosuppressive acyclovir 400 - 800 mg PO BID, valaciclovir 500 
mg PO BID, or famciclovir 500 mg PO BID.  
6. M. Avium Complex (MAC ): If CD4 < 50, azithromycin suggested at 1200 mg q week or 
600 mg twice weekly.  
7. Hepatitis:  
a. Subject s with positive hepatitis B surface antigen should be evaluated for viral DNA 
replication (viral load) by a quantitative PCR me thod before enrolling the subjec t on 
the study.  
b. Lamivudine or newer generation of anti -hepatitis B agents, like tenofovir, should be 
started in those with detectable hepatitis B viral load according to institutional 
preferences. The goal of the treatment should be achieving undetectable (<500 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml) viral load status.  
c. Subject s should be maintained on anti -hepatitis B treatment throughout 
chemotherapy, throughout the HCT , and at least 1-year post-HCT .  
d. Subjects with hepatitis C must have achieved a sustained virologic response for 12 
weeks after cessation of antiviral treatment to be eligible for the study.

RCI BMT Protocol #[ADDRESS_91102] with promising results. We will use this approach in 
this correlative study to prospectively investigate tolerance development following 
PTCy/sirolimus/MMF therapy among MMUD HCT.  
 
Aim 1: Identify and verify transcriptional markers predictive of immune tolerance 
development  
(a) Day+100 and/or Day +180 samples will be used for prediction of immune tolerance, 
defined by [CONTACT_83545].  
 
Aim 2:  Investigate longitudinal change in transcriptional markers for prediction of 
immune tolerance development   
(a) Change in gene expression from Day+21 to Day+180 will be examined for prediction 
of immune tolerance development.  
 
Research blood samples will be collected from recipi[INVESTIGATOR_83482]+21, Day+100, and 
Day+180. Two PAXgene 2.5 mL -fill Blood RNA (IVD) tubes will be drawn at each time 
point. This whole blood collection system stabilizes RNA, and thus is ideal for collection 
and shipment from multiple study sites to H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research 
Institute for analysis. Based on expected yield of 0.5 -1ug RNA/mL whole blood, total 
RNA isolated (~ 2.5 -5ug) will be more than sufficient for planned mRNA profiling 
platforms (Affymetrix ge ne array, Nanostring nCounter technology). RNA will be 
isolated from whole blood (total RNA, inclusive of small RNA to permit microRNA 
analysis), and RNA integrity confirmed.  
 
The collection of these samples should  be scheduled for Monday -Thursday of any given 
week . Samples must be stored at room temperature and shipped on the day of c ollection 
in an ambient sample shippi[INVESTIGATOR_83483] H. Lee Moffitt Cancer 
Center and Research Institute .  
In rare cases where  samples must be  collected on Friday, Saturday,  or Sunday, samples 
must be sto red in the  refrigerator at 2 – 8°C until  shipped in a validated insulated cooled

and Day +365. A custom panel (TBD) designed as a clinical leukemia panel  of genes 
important in oncogenesis will be evaluated  by [CONTACT_83546] -generation sequencing . To 
investig ate the propensity of donor clones for expansion and malignant transformation we 
will analyze the clonal architecture of donor -derived hematopoiesis in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_83485]. We will apply targeted next -generation sequencing (as described above) to bett er 
understand the clonal dynamics in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. We will analyze the changes in variant 
allele frequency of previously identified premalignant clones as well as the occurrence of 
additional cooperating mutations.  
 
Aim 1: To define the population of bone marrow recipi[INVESTIGATOR_83486] 2:  To determine the clinical and functional consequences of the hematopoietic

shipped priority overnight to the CIBMTR Biorepository.  Samples will be frozen for 
later use for this correlative study, which will be conducted by a qualified investigator 
(TBD) .  
 
The collection of these samples should  be scheduled for  Monday -Friday  of a given week.  
Samples must be stored at room temperature and shipped on the day of c ollection in an 
ambient sample shippi[INVESTIGATOR_83488] . If 
shipped on a Friday for Saturday delivery, the shipment must be designated for Saturday 
delivery.  
In rare cases where samples must be  collected on Saturday or Sunday, samples must be 
stored  upright  in the refrigerator at 2 – 8°C until ambient temperature shipment to the 
CIBMTR Biorepository  on Monday  or the next business day in the case of a holiday.

NMDP IRB-2016 -0365  
NMDP IRB Approv ed collected to explore the relationships of immune cell populations with the development of 
acute and/or chronic GVHD, and with outcomes including PFS, TRM and OS.  
 
A peripheral blood research sample ( 10 mL ) will be collected  from recipi[INVESTIGATOR_83489]+100 and Day +365. The 10 mL blood sample will be added to one 10 mL (or two 
6mL) sodium heparin blood tube and shipped priority overnight to Roswell Park Cancer 
Institute.  
 
The collection of these samples must be scheduled for Monday -Friday of a given week.  
Samples must be stored at room temperature and shipped on the day of c ollection in an 
insulated ambient  sample  shippi[INVESTIGATOR_83490] . If shipped on a Friday for Saturday delivery, the shipment must be designated 
for Saturday delivery.  
 
D. Latent HIV Cellular Reservoir Analysis  (HIV -positive patients only)  
In patients with undetectable viral load as measured in conventional assays, there is 
persistent viremia that can be measured at single copy/mL by [CONTACT_83550].  
This viremia may reflect virus being released by [CONTACT_83551].  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_83491]. Pre -HCT conditioning therapi[INVESTIGATOR_83492].  
 
Required Latent HIV Research Sample Collections on HIV -positive Patients  
Once an HIV -positive patient  with one or more available MMUDs  that are homozygous 
for the CCR5delta32 mutation is consented and enrolled on the trial, a required peripheral 
blood research sample will be collected at approximately 8 weeks prior to initiation of 
ablative therapy.  The peripheral blood research sample (180 mL) will be collected and 
placed into eighteen (18) 10 mL EDTA containing, lavender -top Vacutainer tubes.  
Additional scheduled required Latent HIV research samples will be collected at Day +180 
and Day+365.   
HIV-positive patients may be contact[CONTACT_83552]. A separate  informed  consent would be required to participate in 
that research.  
The collection of these samples should be scheduled on only a Mon day, Tuesday or 
Wednesday of a given week. Samples must  be stored at room temperature and shipped on 
the day of collection in an insulated ambient shippi[INVESTIGATOR_83493] . In all cases, this large volume peripheral blood sample 
collection should be scheduled with consideration of other standard of care and required 
research sample collections so that the collection of the entire sample volume might be 
possible. Study sites must notify  the CIBMTR Protocol Coordinator prior to sample 
collection at each time point  to advise of the planned collection date.

MMUD  SELECTION ALGORITHM  
  
Given no available suitable  8/[ADDRESS_91109] 4/8 allele matched (HLA -A, -B, -C, -DRB1), exclude 
any donor with HLA alleles against  which the patient has specific antibodies.    
2. Attempt to find a donor that meets all following criteria:  
a. Young donor <30  years  over 31 -40 years over 41 -50 years  over 51 -60 years  
b. ABO m atched to patient over minor ABO mismatch over major ABO mismatch  
c. CMV serostatus matched to patient CMV (i.e. CMV positive donor for CMV 
positive patie nt) over CMV mismatch  
3. If donor mee ting all criteria in #[ADDRESS_91110] been optimized , the following 
characteristics should be pursued (if possible ): 
a. Male over nulliparous female over parous female   
b. Donor having body weight sufficient for adequate cell collection per patient size, 
if data available  
c. Donor availability information (last donor contact [CONTACT_83557] ) 
5. After optimizing non -HLA criteria, the transplant team may select  the donor based on 
HLA factors : 
a. Best allele match out of 8 alleles (HLA -A, -B, -C, -DRB1; 7>6>5>4)  
b. Consideration of -DPB1 allele matching (allele matching or T-cell-epi[INVESTIGATOR_83496])  
c. Consideration of -DQB1 matching  
d. Consideration of other HLA -loci or genetic markers (e.g. -DRB3/4/5, Killer 
Immunoglob ulin-like Receptor)  
 
Selection for any HIV-positive patient  will prioritize donors homozygous for CCR5delta32 
mutation as the primary selection criteria.   Additional donor selection criteria with 
consideration of a ge, gender, donor weight, ABO matching, CMV matching and donor 
availability will be made by [CONTACT_83558].  
 
Multiple NMDP  resources are  available to assist study sites with donor selection assistance:   
• Traxis application : may  be used by [CONTACT_83559]. P lease note  the 
following  limitations : 
o Traxis results do not include  donors  <5/6 HLA -A, -B, -DRB1 antigen level match  
to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] .  
o This protocol allows for lower overall matching; many potential donors will not 
be available in the  default NMDP HapLogic listing  in Traxis .

NMDP IRB-2016 -0365  
NMDP IRB Approv ed • NMDP Immunogenetic Operations group : may  use additional methods  to identify 
donors .  
• NMDP Case Management group : may use the MMUD selection algorithm with 
specific search factor(s) at the request of the study site. NMDP Case Management then 
provides a Search Strategy Advice (SSA)  report to the study site within [ADDRESS_91111]. The results included in the SSA balance the MMUD algorithm with the 
study site’s specifications.  
 
During donor selection, study sites may consider other factors that may impact the product 
and/or the infusion:     
• Plans for c ell processing/manipulation may increase the potential for a reduction in TNC 
yield . 
• Product travel time may delay the planned  infusion date (and conditioning regimen 
schedule in relation to the infusion date) . 
o Late product pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] -up time: some collection centers do not allow product pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] -up 
until later in the day , which may result in product delivery  delay . 
• In instances where the product requires processing prior to infusion, it may be beneficial 
to delay Day 0 by [CONTACT_24358] (especially if t he product requires transcontinental travel ).

GUIDANCE ON REVIEW ING AND REPORTING  
UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
For more information, see http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html#Q1.  
 
Below are pertinent excerpts from the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) Guidance on 
Reviewing and Reporting Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects.  
 
I. What are unanticipated problems ? 
The phrase “unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others” is found but not defined in 
the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services ( HHS ) regulations at 45 CFR part 46.   OHRP 
considers unanticipated problems , in general, to include any incident, experience, or outcome that 
meets all of the following criteria:  
1. unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
2. related or possibly related to participation in the research (in this guidance document, possibly 
related  means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may 
have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and  
3. suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
OHRP recognizes that it may be difficult to determine whether a particular incident, experience, or 
outcome is unexpected and whether it is related or possibly related to participation in the research.  
 
II. How to determine which AEs are unanticipated problems ? 
In OHRP’s experience, most IRB members, investigators, and institutional officials understand the 
scope and meaning of the term AE in the research context, but lack a clear understanding of OHRP’s 
expectations for what, when, and to whom AEs need to be reported as unanticipated problems, given 
the requirements of the HHS regulations at 45 CFR part 46.   
The following Venn diagram summarizes the general relationship between AEs and unanticipated 
problems:   
 
 
 
 

RCI BMT Protocol #15 -MMUD  
  Version 4.0 March 14, 2018  
 
96 
NMDP IRB-2016 -0365  
NMDP IRB Approv ed  
To determine whether an AE is an unanticipated problem, the following questions should be asked:   
• Is the AE unexpected?  
• Is the AE related or possibly related to participation in the research?  
• Does the AE suggest that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm than 
was previously known or recognized?  
If the answer to all three questions  is yes, then the AE is an unanticipated problem.  
 
 
 
 
 
III. Some examples of unanticipated problems:  
 
• A series of related AEs that individually may not be unexpected but indicate a trend that 
places research participants or others at a greater risk of harm than was previously known or 
recognized.  
• A breach of confidentiality.  
• Incarceration of a participant in a protocol not approved to enroll prisoners.  
• Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks.          
• A paper published from another study that shows that the risks or potential benefits of the 
research may be different than initially presented to the IRB.

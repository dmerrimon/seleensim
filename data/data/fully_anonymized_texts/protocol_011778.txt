Version 4 4/23/[ZIP_CODE].0 Background
The epi[INVESTIGATOR_823575] 2 (SARS-CoV-2)/COVID-
[ADDRESS_1141929] suggested that transfusion of 
convalescent plasma was effective. Shen C et al published a case series of 5 critically ill 
patients with COVID-19 and Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_39053] (ARDS) who were 
treated with convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody and detected an 
improvement in the patients’ clinical status.  Research has shown that IgM and IgG 
antiviral antibodies can be detected in the serum samples of infected patients. After 
infection with COVID-19, the virus antigen stimulates the immune system to produce 
antibodies that can be detected in the blood.  Among these antibodies, IgM antibodies 
appears early and are mostly positive after 3-5 days of onset.  IgM titers then decrease 
while the IgG antibody potency starts to rise rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]. During the recovery phase, the 
titer of the IgG antibody may increase four times or more compared to the acute phase.
The purpose of this prospective interventional study is to gain clinical experience using 
convalescent plasma transfusion administered to critically ill patients with COVID-19.
2.0 Rationale and Specific Aims
To study the efficacy of plasma from patients recovered from COVID-19 infection 
with a high neutralizing antibody titer (NAT) as treatment for individuals who are 
critically ill with COVID-19.
Determine if the antibodies from convalescent plasma will suppress virus load in 
critically ill patients with COVID-19.

Version 4 4/23/2020We propose to conduct a prospective study on patients admitted with COVID-19 to 
Trinity Health Of New England Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] (Saint Francis Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_469716], 
Mount Sinai Rehab Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Saint Mary’s, Mercy Medical Center, Johnson Memorial.   
There will no randomization.  Subjects will be enrolled if the satisfy the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria 
5.[ADDRESS_1141934] blood drawn to 
measure serum SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody titers,neutralizing antibody titers (when 
kit is available) and viral load.   Blood will be collected and stored  so we can measure 
SARS-CoV-2– specific antibody(IgM and IgG) binding titers and a neutralization titers.  
We will be patnering with [LOCATION_011] Heart Diagnostics for these tests.
We hope to screen and collect plasma from [ADDRESS_1141935] will then be sent to the [LOCATION_001] Blood Center (NYBC)  where plasma is 
obtained according to  NYBC Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for plasma collection 
by [CONTACT_823585].  Plasma is frozen within 24 hours of collection per NYBC 
SOPs.  Plasma will be labeled:   Caution: New Drug--Limited by [CONTACT_4496] (or United 
States) law to investigational use along with the IND number. It is then stored for up to 
one year, and thawed when needed. Plasma will be stored at Saint Francis Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_823577].  The subject’s plasma samples will be assigned an unique number and de-identified.  
Duty of Privacy and Confidentiality has been outlined in the Master Blood Services 
Agreement and the Affiliate Participation Agreement.
Risks to subjects may include side effects from intravenous needle insertion site. This 
includes skin irritation, pain, swelling, bleeding, bruising and infection.  Other symptoms 
include light-headedness, dizziness, nausea after drinking.

Version 4 4/23/2020Once we have availability of the convalescent plasma from the NYBC patients are 
eligible to participate if they are over the age of 18 years and below the age of 90 years 
and are critically ill with COVID-19, meet inclusion criteria and are not responding to 
supportive care.  We will study the use of  Convalescent Plasma on 45 eligible recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].
Eligible subjects or legally authorized representative (LAR) will be asked for consent by 
[CONTACT_1963].  Once informed consent is obtained, subjects will have ABO blood 
types determined for compatibility with the convalescent plasma donor and will receive 
two consecutive convalescent plasma infusions of [ADDRESS_1141936] 2-4 hours.
Viral load after convalescent plasma treatment will be measured on day 0 prior to 
administering the convalescent plasma and then on days 3, 5, and 7.  In addition 
antibody titers will be measured on day 0 prior to administering the convalescent 
plasma and thereafter on days 3, 5 and 7.
Blood  will be sent off to [LOCATION_011] Heart Research labs for antibody titers using DIAZYME 
DZ-LITE SARS-CoV-2 IgM CLIA KIT.  They will also measure the viral load
Risks to subjects may include side effects from intravenous injection like skin irritation, 
pain, swelling, bleeding or bruising. Serious risks include:

6.0 Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problems involving Risk to 
Participants or Others
Using the Full unanticipated problem and Adverse event report all AE, 
unanticipated AE and SAE will be reported to the IRB  and the FDA. .  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_823578].   
In each  safety report, the study team will identify all IND safety reports 
previously submitted to FDA concerning a similar suspected adverse reaction, 
and will analyze the significance of the suspected adverse reaction in light of 
previous, similar reports or any other relevant information.

Version 4 4/23/2020suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than 5 
calendar days after the PI’s initial receipt of the information.
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32(a):
Adverse event - means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of 
a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. 
Life-threatening adverse event or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction - An 
adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered "life-threatening" if, in 
the view of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or 
subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or 
suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death. 
Serious adverse event or serious suspected adverse reaction - An adverse event or 
suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life-
threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Suspected adverse reaction - means any adverse event for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of 
IND safety reporting, "reasonable possibility" means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. Suspected adverse 
reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, 
which means any adverse event caused by a drug. 
Unexpected adverse event or unexpected suspected adverse reaction - An adverse event or 
suspected adverse reaction is considered "unexpected" if it is not listed in the investigator 
brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an 
investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information 
described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as 
amended. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_36092]) if the investigator brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or 
hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [INVESTIGATOR_101330]: SFH-20-23

IRB APPROVAL DATE: 04/23/2020
IRB Revision: July 2017
Version 4 4/23/2020virtue of greater specificity) if the investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. 
"Unexpected," as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse 
reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned 
as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.

7.0 Statistical Considerations
The analysis will focus on two primary comparison groups. Within the intervention 
group, viral load and antibody titers overall and at 0, 3, 5, and 7 will be compared by 
[CONTACT_823586], patient demographics, and clinical profile. Viral load and antibody 
response at each time point will be graphed.  A secondary analysis will compare in-
patient mortality between the intervention group and a matched control group of 
COVID-19 inpatients cared for prior to the intervention. Descriptive statistics and IRB NUMBER: SFH-20-23

Version 4 4/23/2020comparisons will include patient demographics, comorbidities, medications, laboratory 
values, APACHE score, and other clinical variables. Variables pertaining to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_823581], date of onset of COVID-[ADDRESS_1141939]; categorical variables will be compared using χ² tests or Fisher’s exact test. 
Outcomes will be considered statistically significant at a p-value < 0.05. 
8.0 Privacy/Confidentiality Issues
Discuss the methods for ensuring participant privacy, and the methods for protecting All 
data collected will be stored in the hard drive of a password-protected and encrypted 
computer at Saint Francis Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_469716].  The subjects’ research folder 
and medical records for both the donor and the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_823582] a 
locked file cabinet in the co-investigators’ office at the Research Department at Saint 
Francis Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_823583].  The study 
database will contain only de- identified data points.  A study identifier, linked to the 
database through a key code, will be kept separate from the data set, stored in a 
password protected and encrypted database accessible only to the Primary 
Investigator.  The study identifier will be used only to verify and confirm the accuracy of 
the data collected from the medical record. This study identifier will be kept separate 
and hidden from the database, and also maintained on a password protected and 
encrypted database in files accessible only to the Primary Investigator.

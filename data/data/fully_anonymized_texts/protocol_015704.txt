 1. INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1 Background - Immunotherapy in Prostate Cancer  
 Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among males in the United 
States. There will be an estimated 234,460 new diagnoses of prostate cancer made in the [LOCATION_002] in 2006 (1) (the estimates for 2006 were not available at the time of the protocol completion).  Treatments for organ- confined prostate cancer include radical prostatectomy and 
radiation therapy.  When the cancer presents de novo, or recurs outside the prostate, first-line systemic treatments typi[INVESTIGATOR_84052] (with LHRH agonists or bilateral orchiectomy), which suppress testosterone levels, limit the growth of androgen-dependent cancer cells, and result in clinical tumor control. After a median time of 2 years, patients progress into a clinical hormone-refractory state, when the prostate specific antigen (PSA) 
levels rise despi[INVESTIGATOR_84053], there is proliferation of androgen-independent cancer cells, and 
there is continued clinical tumor growth that becomes fatal. Therapeutic measures in this situation include further hormonal manipulations or the use of systemic chemotherapy, which has recently shown a small survival benefit in phase III trials. Approximately 30,[ADDRESS_91666] been used successfully in both gene transfer and vaccine therapy studies (2).  Replication- competent and replication-deficient adenoviruses expressing foreign proteins have 
been used to elicit immune responses to a variety of tumor antigens (3-7).  
 We have demonstrated that immunizations with adenovirus, carrying the human PSA gene, 
can induce vigorous anti -PSA T -cell responses and cause the destruction of PSA -secreting 
tumors in a pre-clinical mouse model of prostate cancer (8,9).  Such active immunization 
against prostate-cancer associated antigens might be more effective than active non-specific or 
adoptive/passive immunotherapy.  Therefore, we have pursued a vaccination strategy based on an adenovirus that carries the gene for prostate specific antigen (PSA).  Results from our Phase I trial of adenovirus/PSA (Ad/PSA) vaccine (section 1.4, below) demonstrated that a single immunization of men with metastatic prostate cancer was able to induce anti -PSA T cell 
responses.  The trial design was a dose escalation study with the vaccine administered 
subcutaneously (sc) either in an aqueous solution or in a collagen matrix (Gelfoam
®).  We now 
propose a Phase II clinical trial using the Ad/PSA vaccine, administered in multiple injections to 
prostate cancer patients with minimal disease burden. 
 
1.2 Adenovirus vectors  
 
Recombinant adenoviral vectors transduce a wide range of dividing and nondividing cells 
types, making this gene delivery system valuable as a tool for studying diseases, for vaccine 
therapy, and for potential clinical use (10). Recombinant adenovirus can be prepared and purified in high titers.  In addition, wild-type adenovirus infections are extremely common in the general population, giving adenovirus a well -documented safety record (11).  Moreover, 
adenoviruses are structurally stable and no adverse effects have been reported following the vaccination of US military recruits with wild types, demonstrating their safety for human use (11).  Adenoviral vectors for gene therapy and vaccine therapy are adenoviruses which have been genetically modified to allow insertion of foreign genes and to render the virus replication-defective.  Current vectors have a deletion in the E1 region or in both the E1 and E2 regions.  
PROTOCOL #1  Lubaroff, page 5  
 
 Adenoviral gene transfer has been used in a variety of experimental conditions that include 
transfers to the liver (12), lung (13), central nervous system (14,15), and to cancer cells (16).  
 There is evidence that the introduction of foreign transgenes by [CONTACT_84071], which become ultimately responsible for the elimination of the virus (17,18).  While this is disadvantageous for insertion of functional genes into host cells, it is advantageous in the use of viruses carrying foreign genes as immunogens.  In the vaccine therapy of cancer, active immunization against a murine colon cancer, breast cancer, and 
melanoma antigens have been induced by [CONTACT_84072]  (19-25).  
 
The Ad/PSA vaccine used our laboratory and in our Phase I clinical trial was produced by 
[CONTACT_84073]-pro form of human PSA into a replication deficient 
adenovirus serotype 5.  Replication deficiency was induced by [CONTACT_84074] E1a and E1b 
genes of the virus.  Details of the vaccine can be found in section 9 of this protocol.  Approval 
for the use of the vaccine in the Phase I trial was obtained from the FDA under IND #9706. 
 
In pre-clinical studies, our group has demonstrated that the Ad/PSA vaccine was able to 
induce stronger anti -PSA immune responses than other viral PSA vaccines.  These include 
vaccinia viruses, both replication competent and replication deficient, and to a canarypox vaccine (Table 1), The frequency of PSA -specific CD8+ cells T cells generated by [CONTACT_84075]/PSA 
vaccine was greater than were generated by [CONTACT_84076].. In addition to the  
superior immunizing property of the Ad/PSA, the incorporation of Gelfoam, a collagen matrix (section 1.3), has been shown in pre-clinical studies to enhance the ability of the vaccine to induce strong anti -PSA immune responses (8).  Lastly, immunization of mice with Ad/PSA in 
matrix can induce anti -PSA responses even in the presence of high titer anti -adenovirus 
antibodies (8).  This latter finding is important in light of the fact that most humans have pre-
existing levels of anti -adenovirus antibodies as a  result of prior natural exposure to the virus.

1.3 Gelfoam® Matrix  
 Gelfoam (Pharmacia & Upjohn Company, Kalamazoo, MI) is a medical device intended for 
application to bleeding surfaces as a hemostatic agent.  It is a water -insoluble, off -white, non-
elastic, porous, pliable product prepared from purified pork skin. The Gelfoam gelatin preparation is available either as a cross -linked sponge or as non-cross linked beads.  It is able 
to absorb and hold within its interstices approximately 45 times its weight of blood and other fluids (26). The absorptive capacity of Gelfoam is a function of its physical size, increasing with increasing gelatin volume (27). 
 
PROTOCOL #1  Lubaroff, page 6  
 
 The mechanism of action of surface-mediated hemostatic devices is supportive and 
mechanical (27). Surface-acting devices, when applied directly to bleeding surfaces, arrest 
bleeding by [CONTACT_84077] a mechanical matrix that 
facilitates clotting (28).  Jenkins et al have theorized that the clotting effect of Gelfoam may be due to release of thromboplastin from platelets, occurring when platelets entering the Gelfoam become damaged by [CONTACT_84078] (29).  Thromboplastin interacts with prothrombin and calcium to produce thrombin, and this sequence of events initiates the clotting reaction.  The authors suggest that the physiologic formation of thrombin in Gelfoam is sufficient 
to produce formation of a clot, by [CONTACT_84079] (29).  The spongy physical 
properties of Gelfoam hasten clot formation and provide structural support for the forming clot (28,30).
 
 
Gelfoam has been used experimentally for the delivery of soluble proteins and drugs, 
including insulin, antibiotics , and growth factors (31-33). Gelfoam was used for sustained 
release of insulin in an ocular implant device (31). Delivery of insulin in solution had no effect on blood glucose levels.  In contrast, the use of Gelfoam as a sustained release delivery agent provided measurable insulin activity for up to 10 hours after implantation.  Glucose levels in the blood stabilized at 60% of the original value, whereas administration of insulin in eye drops had 
no effect.  
 
MacDonald and Mathews (34) studied Gelfoam implants in canine kidneys and reported that 
it assisted in healing, with no marked inflammatory or foreign-body reactions. Jenkins and 
Janda (35) studied the use of Gelfoam in canine liver resections and noted that Gelfoam appeared to offer a protective cover  and provide structural support for the reparative process. 
Correll et al (36) studied the histology of Gelfoam when implanted in rat muscle and reported no significant tissue reaction.   
Gelfoam has been used as a hemostatic agent in dog prostate (37).  In these studies no 
gross histological evidence of tissue damage or calcification was induced.  In addition, these 
investigators demonstrated that placement of Gelfoam into the lumen of the bladder resulted in 
liquefaction of the Gelfoam without any evidence of calculogenesis.  Finally, Bischoff and Goerttler (38) used Gelfoam in human prostate therapeutic embolization with success.   
Our laboratory, in collaboration with [CONTACT_84132], has demonstrated that 
administration of the Ad/PSA vaccine in Gelfoam
 induces a stronger anti -PSA immune response 
(Figure 1).  In our pre-clinical studies, immunization with the vaccine in an aqueous suspension induces strong immunity with 10
9 pfu with weaker immunity induced with 108 and 107 pfu.  Use 
of Gelfoam permits  the induction of strong responses at the lower dose of 108 pfu.  In addition, 
strong anti -PSA T cell responses could be induced by [CONTACT_84080]/PSA vaccine in 
Gelfoam even in mice pre-immunized to adenovirus (Figure 2).  In the Phase I clinical trial 
(section 1.4), the addition of Gelfoam to the vaccine immunization did not result in excess 
serious adverse events.

1.4 Phase I study  
 
A Phase I clinical trial of the Ad/PSA vaccine has  been completed in men with measurable 
metastatic prostate cancer, with the primary objectives of determining the toxicity profile and maximal tolerated dose (MTD).  The ability of the vaccine to induce anti -PSA immune 
responses and any clinical responses was also evaluated. Funding for the Phase I trial was provided by [CONTACT_84081], the 
Department of Urology, and the Carver College of Medicine at the University of Iowa. 
 
Eligible patients consisted of men with prostate cancer that had measurable metastatic 
disease, 90% of whom were stage D3. Prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_84054], ketaconazole, prednisone, Casodex, Taxotere, and external beam radiation, but the initiation of vaccine therapy was equal to, or greater than, [ADDRESS_91667] sufficient numbers of patients in the groups to 
statistically evaluate the anti -PSA immune responses induced by [CONTACT_84075]/PSA vaccine. In 
summary, 32 patients were treated in the study followed through the one-year period.  Two 
additional patients were enrolled in the study (total number of enrolled patients, 34) but never received the vaccine and were therefore not evaluable.  One patient chose to have radiation therapy instead of participating in the trial and the second was diagnosed with a second 
malignancy (melanoma) shortly after his enrollment in the phase I study.  
 
1.4.1 Phase I study results 
  The median age of the patients was 70.2 years (range, 52 to 89). The vaccine was 
administered as an aqueous suspension or in a collagen (Gelfoam) matrix to 32 patients.  Sixteen (16/32) or 50% of the patients exhibited grade 1 vaccine-related adverse events (AE), 1/32 (3.1%) that exhibited a grade [ADDRESS_91668] of the presence 
of anti-adenovirus Ab on Ad5-
PSA immunization with and 
without Gelfoam. Mice were injected i.p. with 10
9 PFU of Ad5-
lacZ or PBS 2 wk before immunization with 10
9 PFU Ad5-
PSA delivered s.c. in the fluid 
phase (PBS) or Gelfoam. CTL 
were tested against RM-11psa and RM-11neo to demonstrate 
PSA specificity. Cytolytic acti vity 
of each group against RM-11neo 
targets was <10% for all E:T 
ratios.

 We measured the anti -PSA immune responses, both antibody and T cell, in all patients 
enrol led in the study.  Antibody responses to PSA were measured by [CONTACT_84083] -
secreting cell lines using the method adapted from Cavacini, et al. (39). Results of those analyses demonstrated that 57% of men immunized with the Ad/PSA vaccine developed measurable anti -PSA antibodies.  ELISPOT assays were utilized to measure anti -PSA T cell 
responses.  The results, depi[INVESTIGATOR_28071] 3, demonstrate that of the 32 patients, 18 (56.3%) 
developed anti -PSA T cell responses.  The addition of Gelfoam did not appear to affect the 
development of anti -PSA responses, but in this Phase I study the numbers of patients in each 
group was too small to make statements of statistical significance of the data. These results demonstrate the ability of men with late stage metastatic prostate cancer, injected one time with Ad/PSA, to respond to the vaccine with the production of anti -PSA T cells.

The effects of vaccination on serum PSA and on patient survival were also evaluated as a 
secondary endpoint in the phase I trial. Although there was no sustained decline in individual PSA levels, the PSA doubling times (PSADT, calculated based on 3 pre-enrollment consecutive 
PROTOCOL #1  Lubaroff, page 11  
 
 PSA measurements) were reduced in [ADDRESS_91672] dose of 
the vaccine  (Table 4).  In addition, published survival nomograms for patients with hormone 
refractory prostate cancer were applied to patients in this phase I trial (40,41). Table 5 shows 
that 57% of all patients at all doses, whether injected with the vaccine as an aqueous 
suspension or in the collagen matrix, had a survival time longer than that predicted by [CONTACT_84084]. The range of increased survivals in the different groups was 33% to 100%.

been used in the immunization process that include dendritic cells (45,50-58,63), vaccinia virus 
(39,42,43,47,49), fowlpox virus (39,47), liposomes (44), plasmids, (48), and chemical 
conjugates (59-61).    
Recently, Kaufman et al. recently reported the results of a phase II trial (ECOG 7897) with a 
prime/boost vaccine using vaccinia virus and fowlpox virus expressing human PSA in patients with hormone-dependent prostate cancer (64 ). Sixty -four eligible patients with biochemical 
progression after local therapy were randomly assigned to three treatment arms: (A) fowlpox -
PSA (rF -PSA) by [CONTACT_84085], (B) rF-PSA for three 
doses followed by [CONTACT_84086]-PSA (rV -PSA) given by [CONTACT_34545], or (C) rV -PSA followed 
PROTOCOL #1  Lubaroff, page 12  
 
 by [CONTACT_84087] -PSA vaccines.  Dreicer et al. reported a randomized phase II study with a 
recombinant Modified Vaccinia Ankara virus which expresses both MUC1 and IL2 (TG4010) 
(65). MUC1 is a  glycoprotein associated with several malignancies. Eligible patients were 
required to have no evidence of metastatic disease following curative intent local therapy, 
evidence of PSA failure (PSA over 2 ng/ml) and PSA doubling time (PSA -DT) less than [ADDRESS_91674] consisting of 
autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells enriched for a dendritic cell fraction pulsed with PA2024, a Prostatic Acid Phosphatase (PAP) -GM-CSF construct (66). Patients with 
asymptomatic, metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer were randomized (2:1) to receive APC8015 (n=82) or placebo (n=45) every 2 weeks x 3.  
 ECOG is currently planning a phase III trial using the Vaccinia virus (PROS TVAC-
V/TRICOM) followed by [CONTACT_84088] (PROSTVAC -F/TRICOM) with GM -CSF, 
compared with placebo vaccine plus GM -CSF in patients with hormone-refractory prostate 
cancer with absence of metastatic disease (ECOG 1805, PARADIGM).  
 In summary, the results from these trials vary in terms of patient populations studied 
(hormone dependent vs. independent) and in levels of positive results, which include the induction of antigen-specific immune responses, decreases in levels of serum PSA and in rates of change in PSA velocity, and measures of clinical responses. Thus far no single vaccine 
immunotherapy has proven to be definitely superior to others in terms of clinical benefit, and 
other phase II and III trials continue to be planned or conducted. The results of some of these 
vaccine trials raise the question that an increase in PSADT may in the future represent a possible surrogate marker for increased time to progression, or overall survival in immunotherapy studies, and that absolute PSA responses may not constitute an obligatory step for the ultimate demonstration of clinical benefit of immunotherapy approaches in prostate 
cancer. Furthermore, the T-cell stimulation index may have important correlation with clinical 
vaccine efficacy, as seen in the phase III trial by [CONTACT_84089].(66).  These developi[INVESTIGATOR_84058]/PSA vaccine, also based on the results of our prior phase I trial. 
 
1.6 Proposed phase II clinical trial : rationale  
 
Based on the significant pre-clinical activity of the Ad/PSA vaccine in generating tumor -
specific T cells, and the encouraging safety and efficacy results from our phase I study, we propose to continue the clinical development of the Ad/PSA vaccine with the performance of the current phase II trial. It is our contention that the vaccine product and the method of 
immunization set this therapy apart from other ongoing prostate cancer investigational 
immunotherapeutic approaches.  Specifically, the incorporation of Gelfoam, not present in other vaccine preparations, enhances the induction of strong anti -PSA responses. Immunization of 
mice with Ad/PSA in Gelfoam matrix was able to induce anti -PSA responses even in the 
presence of high-titer anti -adenovirus antibodies. Notably, most humans naturally possess high 
titers of anti -adenovirus antibodies due to natural exposure to adenoviruses. 
 
We plan to enroll prostate cancer patients into one of two arms (A & B) of the Phase II 
clinical trial.  The ideal patient population to determine a therapeutic benefit of a new treatment, 
particularly immunotherapy, is one with minimal disease burden.  The low tumor burden should allow therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], particularly those relying on antigen-specific effector T lymphocytes, to destroy 
PROTOCOL #[ADDRESS_91675] therapeutic arm (Arm A) will enroll men with recent evidence of recurrence following surgery or radiation therapy for their primary tumor.  
Patients in the population will be eligible if they exhibit at least three separate rises in serum 
PSA, at least one month apart with differences > 0.03 ng/ml and a total PSA of >0.2  ng/ml; have 
a PSA doubling time of >6 months; are not at high risk or if they  refuse treatment with Taxotere 
or radiation.  A high risk patient is  defined below .  All patients will be hormone naïve, meaning 
that they may not have had prior systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_15169] (hormonal therapy, 
including but not limited to LHRH agonists, antiandrogens, ketoconazole or chemotherapy – 
mitoxantrone/taxanes/estramustine, etc.) unless they stopped hormone therapy two or more years prior to enrollment and currently have normal testosterone levels..  Since standard therapy for these patients would be to postpone androgen ablation therapy until such time as  
there is a high serum PSA level ( >20 ng/ml), enrolling patients into this Phase II trial does not 
withhold accepted treatment.  Patients will be excluded from the trial if they refuse salvage 
radiation therapy  or had greater than two positive  margins at s urgery, or positive lymph nodes.  
 The second therapeutic arm (Arm B) will enroll men with recurrent disease who will undergo 
androgen depletion therapy.  The choice of this additional patient population is based upon published documentation that inflammati on and the generation of immune responses are 
augmented by [CONTACT_84090] (67-69).  Mercader, et al., in attempts to demonstrate an enhanced termination of tolerance to prostate associated antigens documented CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltrates in benign prostates and in prostate tumors of men undergoing androgen withdrawal (67).  Roden and co-workers published data demonstrating that T cell levels and T cell proliferation were increased in mice following castration (68) while Drake, et al. reported 
breaki ng tolerance to antigens associated with the TRAMP prostate tumors in mice (69).  
Therefore, we propose to vaccinate men beginning [ADDRESS_91676] be willing to be in either study 
group (Arm A or Arm B).  Randomization of patients to Arm A (vaccine only) or Arm B (ADT plus vaccine) will be 1:1.  Fifty (50) patients will be enrolled, 25 in each Arm of the study.  Twenty five (25) cards will be printed for Arm A and [ADDRESS_91677] will be drawn to determine which Arm 
of the study the patent is entered. 
 
We will enroll and treat patients at two affiliated and adjacent medical centers, the University 
of Iowa Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84059] (UIHC) and the Iowa City Veterans Affairs Health Care System  (IC 
VAHCS).  There is a single Institutional Review Board (IRB) that approves protocols for both 
institutions.  After the University of Iowa’s IRB has approved the protocols the Research and 
Development Committee of the IC  VAHCS  meets to provide their approval for the study. 
 
Patient Recruitment:  The UIHC and IC VAHCS  draw from a large catchment area that will 
ensure the enrollment of sufficient numbers of men into the protocol.  We will use recruitment 
methods similar to the methods used to obtain subjects for our Phase I clinical trial.  That 
includes contact[CONTACT_84091], Internal Medicine, and Radiation Oncology at the UIHC and IC VAHCS  and letters written to 
urologists, oncologists, and medical oncologists in Iowa and the neighboring states of Wisconsi n, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Minnesota, and South Dakota.  Drs. J. Brown and M. 
O’Donnell and ARNP E. Brown will assist in the recruitment of patients from the Department of 
PROTOCOL #[ADDRESS_91678]. Smith from Radiation Oncology.   Additional 
recruitment of patients will occur through a referral collaboration with Mercy Medical Center, 
Des Moines, IA (Hereafter referred to as DMMCC).  Once accrual has been completed, no 
further recruitment methods will be utilized.  
 
A physician from outside the UIHC or IC VAHCS  may inform  patients of the study.  If a 
patient expresses interest in learning more about the trial , the physician will provide him with 
contact [CONTACT_84092].  When a patient contacts the clinical trial team, a 
member of the trial team will briefly describe the study and request the patient’s mailing address 
in order to mail him a copy of the study informed consent form.  
 After the patient has had time to become familiar with the study and discuss it with his 
family, a member of the research team will follow up with a telephone call  to discuss the study 
and answer any questions the patient may have.  Of particular importance is the patient’s understanding that he will be assigned to one of two arms in the protocol, vaccine alone or androgen deprivation therapy followed by [CONTACT_29298].  At this time, if the patient is still interested in participating, he will be asked to provide verbal consent to allow the research team to review information from his medical record to evaluate his eligibility for the trial.  The researcher will 
document the verbal consent process in the research file, and will contact [CONTACT_102]’s 
physician to request the medical record for review. The patient will be required to sign a HIPAA 
privacy form and a Release of Medical Information form at his physician’s  office prior to the 
physician releasing his records to the research team.  
   After reviewing the relevant portions of the medical record, a member of the research team 
will again contact [CONTACT_102].  Eligible individuals will be scheduled for a visit to the UIHC or IC 
VAHCS to undergo additional eligibility testing.  At that visit, informed consent for participation in 
the clinical trial will be obtained.  The subject will then be further evaluated for study eligibility through a medical history and physical exam, blood tests, and scans.  Final determination of eligibility will occur at a weekly meeting of the clinical trial team.

research staff to the University of Iowa Cancer Center at this time, and the patient will be 
registered and assigned a unique patient number.  4.6 No patient may be enrolled or begin the research intervention prior to registration and 
assignment of a patient number.  As a follow -up, University of Iowa Cancer Center will 
provide the investigator with written confirmation of each patient's registration.

 5.  RESEARCH INTERVENTION PLAN  
 
5.1 Administration Schedule  
 
Ad/PSA  
Patients with recurrent disease after surgical treatment or radiation therapy will be 
randomized to either Arm A (vaccine only) or Arm B (androgen depletion therapy plus vaccine).  All patients will receive three injections of 0.125 ml. of the Ad/PSA subcutaneously in the right thigh  unless patient condition precludes the use of that leg, in 
which case the left thigh will be used for all three injections.  The dose of the vaccine, based upon our results from the Phase I trial, will be 1 x 10
8 pfu (4.4 x 109 particles) in the Gelfoam 
matrix .  The Gelfoam comes in sterile patient-ready packages.  The virus will be suspended  
in sterile saline and the Gelfoam powder added in a ratio of [ADDRESS_91690] cells by [CONTACT_84096].  Results from the 
Phase I trial indicated that the injection of the vaccine in Gelfoam did not produce any adverse events greater than those produced by [CONTACT_84097].   The vaccine induced anti -PSA immune response in patients injected as an aqueous or 
Gelfoam vaccination.  Injections will be carried out in the University of Iowa Clinical 
Research Unit (CRU).  Each subject will be required to stay  in the CRU for two hours and 
observed for early signs of toxicities  following each of the three vaccinations.   
 
PROTOCOL #1  Lubaroff, page 18  
 
 5.2 Design and Stages  
 
 Subjects will enter the study according to a phase II two-stage design Simon (1989). We 
anticipate a total of 25 s ubjects (per arm) if the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_84061]. After 
testing the research intervention on [ADDRESS_91691] the desired increase in anti -
PSA T cells, the trial will be terminated. Otherwise, an additional 15 patients will be al lowed 
to enter the trial for a total of 25 patients with the goal that more than 13 will show the 
desired increase. For both arms, we will need 50 subjects.  For statistical considerations and the power reached under this study design consideration, we refer the reader to Section 10. 
 
6.  Adverse Events  
Toxicity will be graded according to the NCI common toxicity criteria “ Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events” (NCI -CTCAE v3.0  can be accessed at website:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/forms/CTCAE_Index.pdf).  Non-hematologic and Hematologic dose 
limiting toxicity  (DLT) will be defined as described in Section 8.5.1. 
 
6.1 Definitions  
 Adverse Event (AE)  is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this research intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product.  
This will also include intercurrent diseases and accidents observed during the research intervention  period as well as corresponding events during drug-free, pre- and post-
intervention periods, under placebo or in a reference group receiving drug or non-drug 
therapy.  
Serious adverse event  (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
a. results in death 
b. is life -threatening
i 
c. requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
d. results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
e. is a congenital anomaly / birth defect or  
f. is another medically important condition.ii 
 
6.[ADDRESS_91692] exposure to the study 
drug (through Day 90) .  
Documentation of AEs includes: date of onset and offset, intensity, frequency, seriousness, related interventions and outcome. The investigator will also evaluate the 
PROTOCOL #1  Lubaroff, page 19  
 
 probability of a causal relationship of the adverse event to the study medication as being: “definite, probable, possible, unlikely, or unrelated.”  
All unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others, serious adverse events 
related to participation in the study and subject deaths related to participation in the study will  be promptly reported by [CONTACT_648] ([PHONE_164]), by [CONTACT_6968] 
([EMAIL_145]
), or by [CONTACT_6972] (301-6 19-7803) to the [LOCATION_003]MRMC,  Office 
of Research Protections, Human Research Protection Office.  A complete written report will follow the initial notification.  In addition to the methods above, the complete report 
will be sent to the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, ATTN: MCMR -
ZB-PH, [ADDRESS_91693], Fort Detrick, Maryland [ZIP_CODE]. 
The medical monitor is required to review all unanticipated problems involving risk to volunteers or others, serious adverse events , and all volunteer deaths associated with 
the protocol and provide an unbiased written report of the event.  At a minimum, the 
medical monitor should comment on the outcomes of the event or problem, and in the 
case of a serious adverse event or death, comment on the relationship to participation in the study.  The medical monitor should also indicate whether he/she concurs with the details of the report provided by [CONTACT_1704].  Reports for events determined by [CONTACT_84098].  
Expedited reporting  
The investigator must immediately report serious adverse events (SAE) occurring or observed during the course of the study and within [ADDRESS_91694] administration of the study drug to the FDA, IRB, OBA, and CRU.  
The order of reporting of SAEs is the following:  reported to the Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hours of the event; the PI [INVESTIGATOR_84062] , OBA, 
Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) , and DOD within 7 days of the event and to the 
IRB within 10 days of the event.  After notifying the proper agencies  by [CONTACT_84099] “Serious Adverse Event Report ”must also be sent by [CONTACT_84100]. If complete information is unavailable the investigator must provide follow -up information to the agencies as soon 
as it is known.  
In particular, the investigator must inform the agencies  and committees  by [CONTACT_84101]- threatening SAEs or SAEs 
with fatal outcome.  
 Important: The investigator must report any SAE to the FDA, IRB, OBA, and 
CRU, regardless of causality. 
Reports will be evaluated by [CONTACT_1689]/Sponsor. FDA/HPB and investigators 
will be informed as required by [CONTACT_50342]. The same information will also be made available to all participating investigators as well as to other investigators participating in different clinical trials utilizing the same study medication.  
It should be noted that, although the Ad/PSA vaccine contains the gene for PSA, there is no need for patients to utilize contraceptive practices.  The adenovirus will not be transmitted from patient to his partner. 
In addition, the side effects of androgen depletion therapy, fluid retention, hair loss, hot 
flashes, nausea, vomiting, bone pain, memory changes, and depression, were not 
PROTOCOL #1  Lubaroff, page 20  
 
 observed in vaccinated men our Phase I trial.  Therefore, there should not be any confusion as to which side effects will be attributed to ADT and which to the Ad/PSA 
vaccine.   However, subjects will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_84102]-related side effects.  If side effects occur, investigators will take 
necessary steps to treat them, including discontinuation of the medication and/or discontinuation from the study.  
 [ADDRESS_91695] a baseline evaluation 
prior to the injection of the Ad/PSA vaccine.  The measurements will include physical exam, temperature, weight, serum PSA, blood chemistries, urinalysis, a quantitative 
bone scan for bone metastases, chest x -ray, and CT for soft tissue metastases, and 
performance status for quality of life.  PSA measurements, CT and bone scans are routinely used to follow disease recurrence and/or progression in individual prostate cancer patients and as such would be considered standard of care.  Laboratory measurements such as hematology, liver function and kidney function chemistries, while are routinely used to follow the health of a prostate cancer patient, would not normally be 
performed at the frequency proposed in this trial to assess possible vaccination 
toxicities.  Therefore, they would be considered part of the research protocol.  
 
Patients will be seen in the Urology and Oncology Clinics (see Table 6 for schedule).   The injection site will be examined for evidence of erythema, induration and necrosis 
and patients will have their temperature and weight recorded and the patients will be 
interviewed to determine whether they experienced any adverse reactions.  Blood 
samples will also be taken for standard laboratory testing and measurement of PSA and 
anti-PSA immune responses  (see Table 6).   Patients recruited from the DMMCC will 
return to that facility for their laboratory testing on days 44, 74, and at 6, 9, [ADDRESS_91696]-vaccination visit .  The visits will continue until  the 
patient demonstrates signs of progressive disease.  Follow -up of patients for survival will 
occur  every 6 months by [CONTACT_84103]. 
 
7.2 Use of Serum PSA for Disease Evaluation – Based upon our pre-clinical experiments 
and the results from the Phase I clinical trial we expect the immunized men to produce 
anti-PSA antibodies.  The levels of antibody will be measured by a flow cytometry assay 
as described by [CONTACT_84104], et al. used i n our Phase I clinical trial (39 ).  We will also 
explore the use of a second serum marker for prostate cancer, hK2 in collaboration with 
Donald Tindall, Charles Young, and George Clee at the Mayo Clinic.  Investigators at Mayo, along with Hybritech, Inc. have been exploring hK2 and published a number of papers in recent years on the subject (70-73).  Patient sera from each clinic visit will be 
sent to Mayo where they will measure the levels of hK2.  We will use the data to 
evaluate the effect of anti -PSA antibodies on both PSA and hK2 in the sera of 
vaccinated patients.  
PROTOCOL #1  Lubaroff, page 21  
 
 7.3 Experimental Evaluation of the Ad/PSA Vaccination 
 
7.3.1  Blood will be collected prior to each  injection of the Ad/PSA vaccine and at return 
dates indicated in Table 6, page 26.  Two separate samples will be collected; one in red top tubes to allow collection of serum from coagulated blood and a second in heparinized tubes to permit collection of lymphocytes.  
 7.3.2 Levels of PSA, hK2, anti -PSA antibodies, and anti -adenovirus antibodies will be 
measured in the serum. 
 7.3.3  Anti-PSA T cell immune responses will be measured by [CONTACT_84105], and used in, our Phase I clinical trial.  In addition to 
measuring the anti -PSA T cell activity, we will also measure anti -adenovirus T 
cell activity as well as reactivity to stimulation with cytomegalovirus (CMV).  A non-specific stimulus will be provided by [CONTACT_84106]’s lymphocytes.

8.5 REMOVAL OF PATIENTS FROM STUDY  (Criteria for discontinuation of a patient's 
study participation)  
 
8.5.1 Adverse events:  Study subjects will be monitored for adverse events for 30 days beyond the final study injection, or longer if existing unresolved AEs are being monitored.  In the event of a vaccine-assoc iated unmanageable or irreversible 
toxicity, that would include hematological and non-hematological toxicities  (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]), the investigator will withdraw a patient from further research intervention and notify the Study Chair immediately.  In addition, the FDA and the 
IRB and other agencies listed on page [ADDRESS_91702] possible medical care according to the recommendations of the treating 
physicians.  The treatment plan will depend upon what unmanageable or 
irreversible toxicities may occur.  In the event of an emergency the patient will be

9.[ADDRESS_91709] been 
outlined in Section 5.1 of this protocol. 
 
9.5 Availability  
 
Produced and provided by [CONTACT_84113], LLC, San Diego, CA  
 
9.6 Storage 
 
The vaccine is stored in the UIHC’s Pharmacy Department in a -70oC temperature-
monitored and controlled access freezer.  Only the Investigational Pharmacist will remove the vaccine from the freezer and enter the amount removed in a trial -specific 
log.  
9.7 Injection Procedures  & Observation  
 
At the weekly meetings of the clinical trial team at which the eligibility of the patients 
is decided, orders for the initial vaccine injection will be  written by [CONTACT_84114].  Orders for the second and third vaccine injections will be  written at the 
meetings  as close  to the date of the scheduled injections  as possible.  On the 
designated days of injections and immediately prior to vaccination, the Investigational Pharmacist will mix the Ad/PSA (10
8 pfu or 4.4 x 109 particles) with the Gelfoam powder  
(30 mg/ml).  Each vial of the vaccine contains twice the volume needed for each injection.  One half of the vial will contain the proper pfu and particles required for the vaccination.  The injection material will be taken from the pharmacy in a 1 ml. syr inge 
with 25 gauge needle and presented to staff in the General Clinical Research Center.  Each patient will be injected with approximately 0.125 ml. of the vaccine/Gelfoam 
material subcutaneously in the thigh.  The exact volume of the vaccination mixture (Ad/PSA in Gelfoam) is not as important as the exact number of pfu or particles and that 
PROTOCOL #[ADDRESS_91710] container.  
 
 Patients wi ll remain in the CRU  for 2 hours after each injection to be monitored for 
signs of adverse events.  
 
9.8 Assignment of Patients to Arms A or B  
 
Randomization of patients to Arm A (vaccine only) or Arm B (ADT plus vaccine) will be 
1:1.  Fifty (50) patients will be enrolled, 25 in each Arm of the study.  Twenty five (25) cards will in printed for Arm A and [ADDRESS_91711] of LHRH or GNRH agonists, such as 
leuprolide (Lupron) or goserelin (Zoladex).  ADT will be continued for the first nine months of the study.  Anti-androgens will be used initially to avoid testosterone flair, but then 
discontinued.  Aromatase inhibitors will not be used.  Patients in Arm B will be vaccinated 14 
days after the initiation of ADT.  To insure that all patients in Arm B reach castrate levels of 
testosterone (T) (<50 ng/ml), serum T levels will be measured on their [ADDRESS_91712] vaccination.  This will be approximately  10 weeks after the initiation of androgen 
withdrawal, a time at which T levels should reach their nadir .  
 
9.9 Manufacturing 
 
9.9.1  The PSA cDNA provided by [CONTACT_84115], Mayo Clinic, [COMPANY_002]ster, MN, was 
placed 3’ to the CMV promoter in a shuttle vector containing Ad5 DNA.  The 
sequence inserted was the pre-pro form of PSA described by [CONTACT_84116] (75) that encodes 262 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 28.8 kDa.  Using 
methods previously described (75), the shuttle vector and E1a-E1b deletion 
mutant Ad5 DNA were transfected into HEK 293 cells, and recombination 
between the DNA species was allowed to occur.  The amplification and purification of Ad/PSA was performed by [CONTACT_84117] (76).  Ad/lacZ used as a control was also 
obtained from the Gene Transfer Vector Core and is previously described (75).   
 9.9.2 The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_84064]/PSA vaccine used for the pre-clinical studies to Molecular Medicine, LLC of San Diego, CA for the production of the clinical grade product.  Information on the manufacturing of the GMP Vaccine by [CONTACT_84113], LLC is found in the accompanying documents supplied by 
[CONTACT_7904]. 
10  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
 The ideal endpoint would be a clinical  outcome that is of particular relevance to the patient 
such as increased time to tumor progression, increased time to death, or reducing the 
proportion of death. The trial is using a surrogate endpoint as a substitute to the clinically 
meaningful outcome since the tumor cannot be accessed directly. The association between the 
surrogate and survival rate had not been clearly established by [CONTACT_84118] I & II trial. The trial consists of using Ad/PSA vaccine administered in multiple injections to prostate cancer patients with minimal disease burden—with the goal to induce anti -PSA T cells responses. Three 
injections of equal dose are proposed. A previous phase I trial consisting of a single injection in 
PROTOCOL #1  Lubaroff, page 29  
 
 men with metastatic prostate cancer was able to induce anti- PSA T cells responses. The Phase 
I consisting of a single injection using a dose escalation protocol of the vaccine in an aqueous or 
matrix delivery vehicle did not show any significant AE. Additional pre-clinical pharmacology 
/toxicology studies required by [CONTACT_84119]-injection schedule. The primary endpoint is the development of anti -PSA immune response—
defined as an increase of greater than 200% above pre-immunization level of anti -PSA T cells 
as measured by [CONTACT_84107], measured [ADDRESS_91713] immunization. This endpoint 
will be the same for both arms considered in the protocol —the vaccine only and the vaccine 
plus androgen deprivation therapy arms.   During the Phase I trial consisting of vaccine alone, patients that developed anti -PSA T cell 
responses had an increase in the frequency of anti -PSA T cells.  We decided to express the 
anti-T cell response as percent change in antigen-specific T cell frequency compared to the 
frequency prior to immunization. Based on our phase I results, we judge 70% of the patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_84065] -PSA immune response as being clinically important while anything less than 
40% in both arms will be judged unworthy.  
  The ideal design would be a two-stage design of Simon (1989). After testing the research 
intervention  on [ADDRESS_91714] the desired increase in anti -PSA T cells, the trial 
will be terminated. Otherwise, an additional 15 patients will be recruited for the trial for total of 25 patients with the goal that more than 13 will show the desired increase. If 8 or more show the 
desired increase, then the research intervention  will be judged worthy for further considerations. 
In case the number is less than 8, the research intervention will be rejected. 
 
The expected sample size will be 15.14 and the probability of early termination, 0.63. If the 
research intervention is not effective, there is 0.05 probability of concluding that it is. If the 
research intervention is effective, there will be 0.09 probability of concluding that it is not.  
  We will be conservative and use the same design and sample size considerations for both 
arms  (25 per arm for a total of 50 patients)  even though we expect the vaccine plus androgen 
deprivation therapy arm to yield better results. This brings a natural question of why two 
different research interventions and how one would assess the superiority of one research 
intervention over the other.  We postulate that men in Arm B, those receiving ADT plus vaccine, 
will generate a stronger anti -PSA immune response, as measured by [CONTACT_84120] -
specific T cells, than will men in Arm A, those receiving the vaccine alone. For patients in Arm 
B, there will be a quantitative and/or qualitative difference in the generation of anti -PSA T cells.  
That is, a higher percentage of men will demonstrate antigen specific T cells and/or the 
magnitude of the T cell response, as indicated by [CONTACT_84121], will be greater in this population.  The differences will be most evident [ADDRESS_91715] confidence interval for the proportion of subjects who show 50% increase in PSADT will be reported.  
Monitoring toxicity:  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_84066] 15% versus the alternative that it is actually greater than 35%. In this setting, 
we will carry  two different but dependent looks. If 3 out of 10 show grade 3 vaccine -related 
toxicity or higher, the trial will stop (this will correspond to testing the toxicity hypotheses at level alpha=0.1 with a power of 68%); otherwise, another test for toxicity after we have a total of 17 
PROTOCOL #1  Lubaroff, page 30  
 
 subjects  will be considered. If 5 out of 17 show a grade 3 vaccine-related toxicity or higher, or if 
2 out 17 show a grade 4 toxicity the trial will stop (this will be equivalent to testing the toxicity 
hypotheses at level alpha =0.1 with a power 77%); otherwise we will proceed to full registration. 
The overall type I error for testing toxicity level is around 0.19.  In addition, the trial will stop if any vaccine -related deaths occur.  The determination of a death related to the vaccine will be 
made by [CONTACT_84122].  Randomization to clinical arm: one-to-one.

i The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the patient is at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death 
if it were more severe. 
ii Medically important conditions that may not result in death, be life- threatening or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84070], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition above. 
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.  N.B.: The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) 
of an event (such as: mild, moderate, or severe e.g., pain). The event itself may be of relatively minor 
medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as “serious”, which is based on 
patient/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to patient’s life 
or vital functions. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.

Comparative Effectiveness of Biologic or Small Molecule Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_376234]-TNF Treatment in 
Patients with Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis  
A. SPECIFIC AIMS  
Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) , collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), affect 
approximately 1.[ADDRESS_470823] over $[ADDRESS_470824] 
line treatment for moderate to severe disease. 9-13  Yet, primary  non-response occurs  in up to 30% of patients  and 
secondary  loss of response is observed in up to 80%  of patients.14,15 
When  anti-TNF  therapy  fails, subsequent treatment options  for CD  include  vedolizumab ( α4 β7 integrin antibody)  and 
ustekinumab (anti -IL-12/23 antibody) .   For UC, options include  vedolizumab  or tofacitinib (small  molecule JAK inhibitor 
with  anticipated  FDA approval for UC around 3/201816).  Unfortunately, anti -TNF refractory patients respond less well to 
subsequent treatments ,17-[ADDRESS_470825] effective 2nd line agent.  Yet, there is a 
paucity of comparative effectiveness res earch (CER) to guide this challenging clinical decision faced my many patients 
and their providers .22,23  Given the expanding  therapeutic armamentarium  in IBD, the  Institute of Medicine,  Crohn’s  & 
Colitis Foundation (the Foundation) , and others  have  prioritized CER research to guide treatment algorithms.24-[ADDRESS_470826] is to compare the effectiveness of non-anti -TNF bio logics and small molecules after 
failure of anti -TNF therapy.  We propose to address this pressing, unmet need for CER in IBD with a series of 
complementary prospective and retrospective cohort studies and through the linkage of PCORnet Health Plan Researc h 
Networks (HPRNs) with the CCFA Partners Patient Powered Research Network  (PPRN).  We will also leverage an existing 
mult i-center clinical cohort sponsored by [CONTACT_376239].  Through the use of these varied sources of real -world data , 
our study findings will be broadly  generalizable 27 and directly info rm these important patient treatment decisions.  
Aim 1:  To compare the effectiveness of second line  bi ologic agents ( vedolizumab versus ustekinumab ) among 
patients with Crohn’s disease  (CD) who are anti -TNF primary or secondary non -responders.   
We will perform a prospective cohort  study through the recruitment and linkage of participants from our HPRN Partners 
(HealthCore and Humana) wi th the CCFA Partners PPRN, and by [CONTACT_376240] -center cohort.  Outcomes 
will include disease specific and general patient reported outcomes (PROs) 26 weeks following treatment initiation.  
Aim 2:  To compare the effectiveness of a second lin e b iologic agent (vedolizumab) versus  small molecule (tofacitinib) 
among patients with ulcer ative colitis  (UC) who are anti -TNF primary or secondary non -responders.   
We will perform parallel prospective cohort stud y in UC as described for CD above.  
 
B. BACKGROUND   
Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC),  collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) , affect 
approximately 1.[ADDRESS_470827] over $6 billion annually2.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_15563] (e.g., abdominal 
pain, bloody diarrhea)28 result in substantial morbidity  including,3,4 missed work5 and diminished quality of life.7,8   
The pr imary treatment goals for all IBD  patients are to  1) induce remission by [CONTACT_376241] , 2) maintain remission by [CONTACT_376242]. In 1998, the FDA approval  of 
infliximab, the first anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) biologic agent, revolutionized the tre atment landscape for IBD .  
More recently, a number of ad ditional anti -TNF and other biologics have been FDA-approved.[ADDRESS_470828] line therapy for patients with moderate to severe disease.9-13  However, 
primary non- response occurs in up to 30% of patients and secondary loss of response is observed in up to 80% of 
 
  
 2 patients.14,15  Fortunately, the therapeutic armamentarium continues to grow .  When anti -TNF therapy fails, subsequent 
treatment options for CD include vedolizumab ( α4 β7 integrin anti body) or  ustekinu mab (anti -IL-12/23 antibody). For 
UC, options are vedolizumab or tofacitinib (small molecule JAK inhibitor with anticipated FDA approval in March 2018).[ADDRESS_470829] effective 2nd line agent.  This is a high-risk/ high-reward treatment decision , requiring 
patients and their physicians to weigh the potential benefits of these new treatm ents  (improved symptoms and quality 
of life, halting disease progression, and modifying disease course) against severe, life -threatening short - and long -term 
risks (serious infectious and malignancy). Yet, there is a paucity of patient-centered comparative  effectiveness research  
C.  Study Design 
This comparative ef fectiveness project comprises two prospective cohorts (CD and UC) and two retrospective cohorts 
(CD and UC).  Each prospective cohort will be a secondary data analysis of data collected through t wo external cohort 
studies (IBD Partners and SPARC-IBD).  The retrospective cohort studies will utilize health care claims data from 
HealthCore and Humana, analyzed through the PCORnet distributed research network (Coordinating Center, Harvard 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_41282]).   
C.[ADDRESS_470830] discrete da ta using a variety of 
formats including radio buttons and/or drop -down menus.  This allows for real -time implementation of range and 
consistency checks, and greatly reduces missing data. To the extent possible, survey items are based on validated instruments and include assessments of medication adherence, exercise,  disease symptoms and activity, and QO L/PRO 
measurements.  Measures that are both general (NIH PROMIS) and disease-specific (disease activity indices and QOL measures).  Participants  can also  update their treatment and outcome information on an “on demand”  basis on our 
patient portal.   
Participant recruitment and follow -
 up in the IBD Partners study is ongoing.  To facilitate recruitment of patients initiating 
treatment with vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and tofacitinib, we have partnered with the research divi sions leading health 
plans (HealthCore/Anthem and Humana) to identify new users of these medications and invite them to join the cohort.  To encourage retention of such patients, we have created customized email notifications and will be providing a $[ADDRESS_470831]. 
In addition to survey data, for participants recruited by [CONTACT_274669] s, we will obtain a patient -level dataset derived 
from claims  data that includes basic demographics along with indicators of the following: diagnoses/comorbidities, 
medication  use, and basic measures of health services utilization (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], surgery, endoscopy)  before and after 
index date.  
Study of Prospectiv e C
 linical Adult Research C ohort (SPARC ) is a prospective, multi -center cohort of adult IBD patients 
with longitudinal collection of clinical  and patient-reported data and biosample s.  Clinical a nd demographic 
characteristics of all participants are captur ed at the time of enrollment and updated during follow -up visits and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  Data elements include disease p henotype, duration of disease, selected laboratory data, prior surgeries , 
and prior medication use.  Data on validated endoscopic severity scores are also captured.33,[ADDRESS_470832] clinical  data are 
captured at the point of care through an EHR-based “Smartform” at each site, and subsequently extracted, transformed, 
and loaded (ETL) into the I2B2 -based Plexus data warehouse.  This clinical data is supplemented by [CONTACT_376243].    
C.2 Prospective Cohort Studies  
Croh n’s disease 
Study Population.   Inclusion criteria will include 1) diagnosis of CD , as reported by [CONTACT_40198] (PPRN) and/or treating 
physician (SPARC); 2) initiation of either ustekinumab or vedolizumab ( date of the first dose, as reported by [CONTACT_376244] , will be considered the index date ); 3) age ≥ 18 years; and 4) 
treatment with anti -TNF  prior to index date.   
 
  
 3 Comparators .  As above, new users o f ustekinumab or vedolizumab 
Outcomes .  Co-primary  outcome s will be  NIH Patient Reported Outcome Measurement and Information System 
(PROMIS) measures of Pain Interference and Fatigue, which have been prioritized by [CONTACT_376245] -investigators and 
PPRN P atient Governance Committee.   PROMIS scales are  continuous meas ures, calibrated using a T -score metric to the 
US general population with a mean of [ADDRESS_470833] deviation of 10. Minimal important differences (MIDs) are in the 
range of [ADDRESS_470834] to 6 months.  
Secondary PROs  which may include a disease-specific symptom index (Short Crohn’s Disease Activity Index)[ADDRESS_470835] describe characteristics of new initiators of each treatment, and compare mean 
PROMIS T-scores (approximately 6 months after treatment initiation) for Pain Interference and Fatigue.  We will then utilize generalized linear mixed models  (GLMM) to compare outcomes by [CONTACT_1570], taking into account  
clustering by [CONTACT_26423]-cohort (internal PPRN population, referral  from HPRN, and SPARC -IBD), and adjusting for the following 
covariates of interest:  age, gender, race/ethnicity,
 time from diagnosis (< 2 or ≥ 2 years),  smoking status, body mass 
index (BMI) ba seline disease activity disease  as measured  Short Crohn’s Disease Activity Index32, other baseline 
indicators of health status such as the PROMIS domains listed above, prior use of corticosteroids and other immune suppressive agents (e.g. azathioprine, mercaptopurine, methotrexate, cyclosporine, tacrolimus prior to index date), and ongoin g use of concomitant immune suppression.   
In addition, each sub -cohort offers the opportunity to evaluate a unique set of expanded covariates.  For example, 
existing PPRN participants will have rich data about health behaviors (i.e. Godin -Shephard Leisure-Time Physical Activity 
Questionnair e
42 and the Patient Activation Measure43).  HPRN-referred participants will have data on  healthcare 
utilization and data on comorbidities included in the Deyo-Charlson Comorbidity Index (DCCI)[ADDRESS_470836] an expanded array of  clinic al data including anatomic location of 
disease, endoscopic  severity , body mass index (BMI), and selected laboratory  values (ESR, CRP, hemoglobin, albumin).  
We will first conduct separate analyses of each population using each sub -cohort’s full data extent , and will report sub-
cohort -specific estimates of the treatm ent effect s, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) . Next, we will compare the 
covariate characteristics that were measured in each sub -cohort (enumerated in the above paragraph); if those common 
covariates suggest similar patient populations across sub -cohort s, then we will assess heterogeneity of treatment effects  
(HTE)  in the full data.  If treatment effect estimates from the full data suggest homogeneity, then we will report the 
results from the G LMM as described above .   
Missing data:   Missing data may occ ur due to either loss to follow up and/or incomplete responses to survey items.  We 
will make every possible effort to monitor and mitigate against this risk of missing data, and will report on t he 
occurrence of drop -out and summarize results on all patien ts in the prospective cohort.   We will use multiple 
imputation47 to account for missing data, based  on the assumption that data will be missing at random conditional on 
the joint distribution of an extensive set of covariates measured on each participant.   We will also perform sensitivity 
analyses to assess the robustness of findings to plausible altern ative assumptions about the missing data.48  
Pre-specified subgroup analyses and Heterogeneity of Treatment Effects .  All analyses will be stratified by [CONTACT_376246] (< 2 or ≥ 2 years) , number of prior anti -TNF therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  age group (18 to <40, 40 to <65, >65), sex, and use of 
concomitant immune suppressive therapy.  For each subgroup analysis, we will  estimate treatment effects and 95% CIs  
within each subgroup, and graphically  display results  across subgroups.  Although the study will not have adequate 
power for each subgroup analysi s, estimating the effect size  and precision will provide useful hypothesis -generating data .   
Sample size and Power .  Ou r sample size is based upon the co -primary outcomes of this an alysis, PROMIS measures of 
Pain Interference and Fatigue, which  will be assessed approximately 6 months after treatment initiation.  We estimate 
our needed sample size on the following assumption s: 
• The t hreshold of a clinically relevant effect size is a difference in mean T scores of ≥ 5 .  This is based on prior 
longitudinal data from our CCFA Partners network  indicating that a change of 5 points is associated with 
“improvement” or “worsening” of disease activity.  [ADDRESS_470837] been estimated between 3 and 6.49  If the true treatment difference falls below this threshold, then 
other factors such as type of dosing (oral, subcutaneou s, intravenous), dosing interval (daily, weekly, monthly) will 
play a more important role in treatment decisions.  
• Based on our preliminary data, the ratio of patients  exposed to each treatment may be as high as 2:1  
• Loss to follow up rate may be as high as 20%  
Based on the above ,  a total of 180 participants will be needed to achieve 80% power with  a two-sided α of 0.05.   
 
Ulcerative colitis  
Our UC prospective cohort will be parallel in design to the CD cohort described above, with the following minor changes.   
Study population.   Inclusion criteria will include 1) diagnosis of UC, as reported by [CONTACT_2299] (PPRN) and/or treating 
physician (SPARC); 2) initiation of either tofacitinib or vedolizumab .  Other eligibility criteria will remain the same.  
Outcomes  will remain the same with the substitution of a  self-reported UC symptom index.33  
Sample size and recruitment potential.  As with the CD cohort, our required sample size is 180 participants.

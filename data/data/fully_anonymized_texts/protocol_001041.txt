 [ADDRESS_733559] Cesarean Delivery Analgesia: A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116]  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Date: 10/1/2024                 
 2 Patients over the age of 18 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Classification II or III scheduled to undergo elective cesarean delivery (CD) under spi[INVESTIGATOR_558694] a term pregnancy of 37 to 42 weeks will be approached to participate in the prospective open label component of the study. Exclusion criteria include: patients with greater than 3 prior CDs, a pre-pregnancy body mass index >40 kg/m2, planned concurrent surgical procedure other than tubal ligation, receiving chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_218947], clinically significant event or condition uncovered during surgery (e.g. excessive bleeding, acute sepsis) that might render the patient medically unstable or complicate the patient’s postsurgical course, and an allergy or contraindication to any component of the multimodal analgesic regimen.   All patients will receive the standard of care intraoperative and postoperative analgesic regimen used at Duke University Medical Center incorporating 100 mcg intrathecal morphine (ITM), intraoperative acetaminophen [ADDRESS_733560] block (ESPB) will be performed at the T10 level under ultrasound guidance using 133 mg liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_23183] 20 ml bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.25% per side. 
 [ADDRESS_733561] information about pain scores (0-10 verbal rating scale, 0= no pain, 10= worst possible pain), need for rescue antiemetics or antipruritics, and need for rescue analgesia. At [ADDRESS_733562] the obstetric quality of recovery score and ask patients about their satisfaction with postoperative analgesia on a 0-10 scale (0=not satisfied, 10=totally satisfied). At 48 h, patients who had a repeat CD will be asked about how analgesia for this delivery compared with the prior CD (can’t remember, worse, same, better, much better). Prospectively enrolled patients will be matched in a 1:4 ratio by [CONTACT_654], race, history of prior CD, and insurance status with historical controls who received the same multimodal analgesic regimen but no truncal blocks identified through a review of electronic medical records (Epic Systems EMR, Verona, WI, [LOCATION_003]).  The primary outcome of the study is postoperative oxycodone consumption 0-48 h after surgery. Secondary outcomes include: total postsurgical opi[INVESTIGATOR_338358] [ADDRESS_733563] postsurgical opi[INVESTIGATOR_39890], area under the curve (AUC) of visual analog scale (VAS) pain intensity scores through 48 h (AUC0–48), need for treatment of PONV and pruritus, and proportion of opi[INVESTIGATOR_558695] (defined as patients not receiving any rescue opi[INVESTIGATOR_558696]).   A power analysis was conducted assuming a log-normal distribution of postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556]. With 30 recruited block patients matched 1:4 to historical controls (total sample size 150), we had 80% power to detect a reduction in opi[INVESTIGATOR_443435] 36% (mean ratio 
 4 0.64) with an alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_733564] size reported as a geometric mean ratio.  Secondary outcomes will be compared using chi-squared tests or log-linear regression, as appropriate.

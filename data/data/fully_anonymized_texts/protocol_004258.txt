A.Purpose/Objectives
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of a decision support
system aimed at reducing glucose variability in T1DM patients using continuous
subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or multiple daily injections (MDI). The system will be
deployed on our portable medical application platform (DiAs) and will include the following
elements:
1.An insulin pump or MDI treatment parameters optimization routine, using a month of
collected CGM/insulin/meal data
2.An exercise risk warning system, capable of predicting hypoglycemia at the onset of
physical activity and advising on mitigating treatments such as insulin adjustment or
carbohydrate consumption
3.A smart bolus calculator based on CGM glucose measurements and insulin sensitivity
estimation.
Primary Specific Aim: 
To demonstrate feasibility and safety of a glucose variability-reducing decision support 
system, measured by [CONTACT_105]-inferiority of use of the system compared to standard SMBG-
informed CSII or MDI therapy in terms of occurrence of hypoglycemia and percent time 
spent between 70 and 180 mg/dl as measured by [CONTACT_520300]. 
Secondary Specific Aims: 
To assess the effect size of using the GV advisory system compared to standard CSII or MDI 
therapy in terms of: 
Occurrence of hypoglycemia during and immediately after exercise
Glycemic excursion post meals
B.Stu
dy Design Overview
Subjects : The study is intended to complete up to 20 subjects with Type 1 Diabetes
Mellitus who use continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and up to 20  subjects
wit
h Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus who use multiple daily injections (MDI). The study will be a
randomized cross-over design with a Control and Experimental admission. The order of the
admissions will be randomized.   It is estimated that there will be a higher than normal rate
of screen failures, dropouts, or withdrawals, thus we intend to set a recruiting target of 70
subjects .

Procedure : Data collected during an approximately 28 day data collection period will be 
analyzed and will be used to optimize insulin parameters.  These n ew parameters are the basis 
for the treatment optimization , requiring a minimum of 14 valid days during the 28 days of 
collection to advise the system. The collected basal rates or basal insulin dose, insulin 
sensitivity factor (ISF), and carbohydrate ratio data will be used to optimize the subject’s insulin 
parameters (basal rates or basal insulin dose, insulin sensitivity factors and carbohydrate 
ratios). Subjects on MDI therapy will record this data into ‘MySugr’, an app that helps keep 
track of blood sugar levels, insulin dosages, meals, activities, mood and other information .  The 
subject may also use a novel Bluetooth connected insulin pen, called inPen, for prandial dosing 
(Companion Medical, San Diego CA) . The optimized parameters will be approved, modified or 
rejected by [CONTACT_88003]. CGMs will be blinded during the trial.  
This system will only implement a retrospective optimization of the subject’s insulin therapy, 
with defined limits in how much it can deviate from the original (See Appendix A-3 for details). 
Thi
s optimization is  then reviewed by [CONTACT_520301] . 
The study physician is at liberty to accept, modify, or reject the advised optimal settings. A 
record of these decisions will be maintained . If a change in the basal insulin dose is 
recommended and accepted by [CONTACT_520302], the subject will be instructed to 
use the new basal dose(s) for  approximately [ADDRESS_674871] access to this 
information via remote monitoring (password protected on DiAs) during the study 
admissions . The CGM is blinded to the study participant to avoid CGM-induced glucose 
variability reduction, as it would cloud the analysis of the impact of the system. 
Subjects will use their own insulin parameters, including basal rate or basal insulin dose insulin 
sensitivity factor and carbohydrate ratio, and determine their own insulin usage during the 
Control admission.  
MDI subjects will be provided with an insulin pen (NovoPen Junior, NovoPen Echo, or 
Companion Medical inPen Smart Pen ) with short-acting insulin for treatment during the 
Exp
erimental admission. These pens are capable of delivering insulin in 0.5 unit increments and 
are FDA approved but for the Smart Pen which is under 510(k) review (see letter of 
Authorization) . If this option is selected, the Companion Medical pen, known as the InPen, will 
be used in the trial. This insulin pen contains computer chip technology built into the base and 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL 
 
 Version Date:  10/14/[ADDRESS_674872]’s data and then transmits it to an 
app that contains a dose calculator and also calculates real-time insulin on board (IOB). The 
insulin pen has remote monitoring, permitting the subject to inform the study team of their 
in
sulin dose, BG and carbohydrates. An inPen User Guide will be available to all MDI subjects if 
this smart pen is used in the trial. If this pen is not available at the time of the trial, a pen that 
can deliver in 0.[ADDRESS_674873] with two 3x15min exercise bouts.

it 1: Screening Visit.  All subjects will be consented and receive a history and physical. Study 
eligibility will be reviewed.   After a subject completes the screening criteria, the subject will be 
randomized to the Experimental or Control admission first. 
Visit 2: CGM Placement & Training.  All subjects will receive training on the use of the 
continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and study glucometer prior to the Experimental admission . 
Approximately 28 days of blinded  CGM data will be collected with a total of 14 valid days 
needed to participate in the research house/hotel admission. Visit 1 and 2 can be done on the 
same day.    
Visit 3: Data Collection Period.  Blinded CGM data will be collected prior to the Experimental 
admission and analyzed by [CONTACT_520303].  For CSII users, the insulin pump and CGM 
downloads will be reviewed approximately 72 hours before the Experimental admission by [CONTACT_520304] . For MDI users, data entered into the 
MySugr app and  CGM downloads will be similarly reviewed. Subjects will also wear a ‘Fitbit’ to 
collect information activity, exercise, heart rate, and sleep. An anonymous Gmail account will 
be est ablished for each subject. An app will be placed on the subject’s smartphone or subject’s 
personal laptop to facilitate weekly downloading of the Fitbit data. Additional Data Collection 
Periods may be requested to ensure proper data collection.  
Visit 4 and 5: Research House/Hotel Admission.  The Experimental and Control admission will 
be separated by [CONTACT_3450] 4 weeks, 8 weeks or 12 weeks . The order of these two visits will 
be randomly selected. Subjects will be admitted to the research house/hotel at ~16:00-17:00 
and will be discharged after approximately 48 hours.

C. Sample Size and Investigational Sites 
This study will be conducted at the University of Virginia Center for Diabetes Technology (CDT) . 
Twenty subjects (N= 20) with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus who use CSII and twenty subjects (N= 20) 
w
ith Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus who use MDI  to treat their diabetes will be needed to complete 
the protocol. The studies will be conducted at the CDT Research House as noted below . The 
study may also occur at a local hotel. Vulnerable populations (i.e. pregnant women, prisoners, 
etc.) will be excluded from participation. Based on our experience with similar studies, we 
estimate an higher than normal screen failures, dropouts, or withdrawals due to the data 
coll
ection requirements and admission time restrictions; thus we intend to set a recruiting 
target of 70 subjects .  
As a safety/feasibility investigation, this study is not powered to a specific outcome. 
Nonetheless, based on prior work and computer simulations we estimate the likely effect size 
to be large (around 0.7); we therefore have chosen a sample size of 15-20 subjects for each 
group (CSII and MDI). Using a power analysis with a fixed sample size, significance and 0.[ADDRESS_674874] size larger than 0.67. In prior studies, 15 subjects 
ha
ve also been considered by [CONTACT_520305].

Admission Procedures 
Day 1 
1. General Information:  During both admissions, the subject will wear a blinded Dexcom CGM 
connected to DiAs for remote monitoring capabilities. The staff will remotely monitor the 
subject using the remote monitoring website. DiAs will be programmed with the home 
insulin dosing parameters during the Control admission and with the optimized insulin 
dosing parameters during the Experimental condition. DiAs will be used for meal insulin 
dosing advice for both admissions and for pre-exercise advice during the Experimental 
admission. DiAs will be informed of any BG values, meals, carb treatments, correction 
doses, or snacks during the admission. The DiAs system will be initiated prior to dinner.  
a. Experimental Admission  – The DiAs will be programmed with the new optimized 
basal rates or basal insulin dose (entered as a basal rate U/hr = Lantus, Tresiba, 
Levemir dose/24hr), insulin sensitivity factor(s), and carbohydrate ratio(s) . Thes e 
new parameters will be used for insulin dosing advice during the entire admission. 
MDI users will use the study insulin pen for meal insulin dosing and the home insulin 
pen or syringe for Lantus (glargine), Tresiba [degludec], or Levemir [Detemir] dosing. 
Pump users will use the home pump for both meal insulin dosing and basal insulin 
administration during the admission.  
b. Con
trol Admission  –The study subject will use the home basal/bolus MDI  or CSII 
insulin regimen via the home insulin pens or pump and determine the amount of 
insulin to give for the entire admission per the subject’s home carb counting 
parameters and as calculated by [CONTACT_520308].

will be administered based on the subject ’s regular therapy regimen (basal profile, 
correction factor and carbohydrate ratio profiles) and according to the subject’s 
estimate of the carbohydrate content of the meal. The subject will self-administer the 
DiAs-calculated meal bolus under study staff supervison.   
3. Optional Snack:  The subject may eat a snack in the evening with optional insulin coverage 
per their usual care . If chosen, this snack must be replicated at both admissions. The subject 
will inform DiAs of the carbohydrates in the snack and current blood glucose level by 
[CONTACT_520312] . Otherwise 
the snack carbohydrates will be entered in DiAs using the hypoglycemia treatment screen. 
DiAs will advise an insulin dose using the usual patient carb ratio during the Control 
admission and using the optimized ratio during Experimental admission. The DiAs-advised 
insulin dose will be self-administered by [CONTACT_520313].

Blood Glucose Measurements  
 The subject will be instructed that all fingersticks should be preceded by [CONTACT_520319] 
w
arm water and a dry towel. The subject will be instructed to obtain fingerstick, avoiding 
alternative sites, when obtaining blood values. The first drop of blood will be discarded. The 
second hanging drop will be used to measure the glucose level. 
• The subject will be reminded that all treatment decisions should be based on fingerstick 
values and not on CGM values. 
• Once a fingerstick is obtained for any reason during the admissions, the Glycemic Treatment 
Guidelines (Appendix A-6) will be followed to determine timing of subsequent fingersticks.  
• Scheduled times: prior to meals and snacks, before and after each 15 minute exercise bout, 
and at bedtime (23:00) .  
• Prior to calibration of CGM and/or if calibration is requested by [CONTACT_28047]. 
• The subject may request any additional fingersticks as desired. 
• Study personnel may also request additional fingersticks at their discretion. 
• BG treatments will be based on Glycemic Treatment Guidelines (Appendix A-6) although 
hypoglycemic treatments can occur at any time per the subject’s request.   
• If CGM < 80 mg/dL, SMBG will be performed every 15 minutes. If SMBG <100 mg/dL, the 
Glycemic Treatment Guidelines (Appendix A-6 ) will be applied. 
• If CGM >300 mg/dL, SMBG will be performed every 60 minutes. If SMBG >300 mg/dL, the 
Glycemic Treatment Guidelines (Appendix A-6) will be applied.  
• In case of remote monitoring unavailability or in case of CGM failure (an alert will sound on 
the DiAs and on the remote monitoring), SMBG will be collected at bedtime, 3am and 7am 
until the issue is resolved.  
• Calibrations of the CGM will be per manufacturer guidelines. Hypoglycemia treatment (e.g. 
glucose tablets, glucose gel/liquid, and a glucagon emergency kit) will be available for

treatment at all times .  
• The subject will have access to ad lib glucose-free beverages. 
• A study MD will be available for any clinical concerns. 
• The Senior DiAs Engineer with remote monitoring capability will be available if needed to 
view the study from another location. A DiAs trained technician will be on site for any 
system issues. 
• The subject will be accompanied by a medically qualified staff member and a technician 
during the admissions. 
SAFETY MONITORING / RISK ANALYSIS 
 Monitoring Procedures by [CONTACT_445628] 
1. C
GM values are updated onto DiAs every [ADDRESS_674916]-entered SMBG values from 
the 
remote monitoring website and alert nursing and physician staff when the CGM is <80 
or >300 mg/dL .  
3. If CGM < 80 mg/dL, SMBG will be performed every 15 minutes. If SMBG >80 mg/dL, the 
Glycemic Treatment Guidelines (Appendix A-6) will be applied during both the Experimental 
and Control admissions.   
4. If CGM >300 mg/dL, SMBG will be performed every 60 minutes. If SMBG >300 mg/dL, the 
Glycemic Treatment Guidelines (Appendix A-6) will be applied Experimental and Control 
Admissions.  
5. The DiAs trained technician will monitor the system for the first floor of the research 
house/hotel during the entire admission.  
6. Medical personnel and emergency supplies are on the first floor of the research 
house/hotel but the study staff periodically round subjects’ rooms on both floors during the 
overnight hours.  
 Glucose Monitoring Risk :

K121087).  
 Hypoglyce mic/Hypergly cemi c Risk :  
CLINICAL PROTOCOL 
 
 Version Date:  10/14/16 Page 25 
The Glycemic Treatment Guidelines will be followed during Visit 4 and Visit 5. The treatment 
guidelines are attached in Appendix A-6. 
 Calibration of CGM Risk :  
T
he CGM will be calibrated using fingerstick values before meals, bedtime, and as requested by 
[CONTACT_520320]. The study team may recommend 
calibrations as needed.  
 Sterilization Risk :  
St
udy equipment cannot be ster ili zed in an autoclave. Cl eaning instructions for study 
equipment provided to study the sub ject are provided below. 
 Device Reuse Risk: 
Th
e Dexcom Continuous Glucose Monitors are labeled for single use only. The sensor, the 
component of the system that enters the skin, will be single use only. The transmitter and 
recei
ver will be reused after cleaning as described below. The transmitter is attached to the 
sensor but does not enter the skin and the receiver is a hand held device. The transmitter and 
receiver will be cleaned adhering to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27994]. The subject will be 
informed that the FDA has approved these devices for single use and that by [CONTACT_520321], bloodborne pathogens (i.e. Hepatitis B) may be spread through the use of 
mul
tiple users.  
Cleaning Procedure: Equipment that touches intact skin will be cleaned with ethyl or isopropyl 
alcohol (70-90%), quaternary ammonium germicidal detergent (i.e. CaviCide) or household 
bleach. The contact [CONTACT_28041]. 
CaviCide requires three minutes on the surface. Clorox Germicidal Bleach Wipes require two 
minutes on the equipment. The surface should remain wet (i.e.  slightly damp) with the 
di
sinfectant to be considere d effective though not wet enough to l eave drops of liquid. 
Equipment will be stored in a clean zipped bag.

The subject will be instructed how the device is inserted, calibrated and removed. The subject 
will be trained how to upload the CGM data. The subject will verbalize understanding of how 
the device is used, how to insert the device, how to calibrate the device and how to remove the 
device. The subject, with the guidance of the study team, will then insert the sensor and begin 
wearing the CGM. The study team will teach the subject how to calibrate the device as needed . 
The study team will confirm that all questions have been answered and that the subject has 
understood the training. The subject will be given a contact [CONTACT_520322] 24 hours per day. 
Study Glucometer Training: 
The Bayer CONTOUR NEXT Blood Glucose Monitoring System will be used during visit 2-[ADDRESS_674917] has u nderstood the training. 
DiAs Training: 
During the Control and Experimental admissions, a brief introduction to the DiAs UI will o ccur  
with a qualifie d clinical member of the study team. DiAs will be used as an insulin-dosing 
calculator for both admissions and the advice recommended by [CONTACT_520323] (Experimental admission) or home 
insulin pen (Control admission) for MDI users.  For the Control admission, DiAs will be pre-
progra mme d by [CONTACT_520324]’s home insulin parameters. For the 
Experimental admission, DiAs will be pre-programmed with the optimized insulin parameters 
pe
r the decision support system and that have been approved by [CONTACT_5989] . To 
minimize risk associated with the use of DiAs: 
1. The study team will confirm the home pump parameters entered in DiAs during 
the Control admission and the physician-approved optimized parameters during 
the Experimental admission .  
CLINICAL PROTOCOL 
 
 Version Date:  10/14/16 Page 27

Table 2:  Adverse Events, Unanticipated Problems, Protocol Violations and Data Breaches 
 
Definition of Adverse Event:  A reportable adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence 
or any unexpected medical occurrence in a study subject.     
Hypoglycemic events are recorded as Adverse Events if the event required assistance of 
another person due to altered consciousness to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, 
or other resuscitative actions.  This means that the subject was impaired cognitively to the 
point that he/she was unable to treat him or herself, was unable to verbalize his or her 
needs, was incoherent, disoriented, and/or combative, or experienced seizure or coma.  
These epi[INVESTIGATOR_27982].  
If plasma glucose measurements are not available during such an event, neurological 
recovery attributable to the restoration of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient 
evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration.   
 
Hyperglycemic events are recorded as Adverse Events if evaluation or treatment was 
obtained from a health care provider or if the event involved diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), as 
defined by [CONTACT_3467] (DCCT), and had all of the following:  
 Symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, nausea, or vomiting;  
 Serum ketones or large/moderate urine ketones;  
 Either arterial blood pH <7.30 or venous pH <7.24 or serum bicarbonate <15; and 
 Treatment provided in a health care facility 
 
Recording of Adverse Events : Throughout the course of the study, all efforts will be made to 
remain alert to possible adverse events or untoward findings.  The first concern will be the 
safety of the subject, and appropriate medical intervention will be made. 
The investigator will elicit reports of adverse events from the subject at each visit and

 Version Date:  10/14/[ADDRESS_674922] been 
caused by [CONTACT_28033].    
The intensity of adverse events will be rated on a three-point scale: (1) mild, (2) moderate, or 
(3) severe.  It is emphasized that the term severe is a measure of intensity: thus a severe 
adverse event is not necessarily serious.  For example, itching for several days may be rated 
as severe, but may not be clinically serious.   
Adverse events that continue after the participant’s discontinuation or completion of the 
study will be followed until their medical outcome is determined or until no further change in 
the condition is expected.   
Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary.  
Definitions of relationship and intensity are listed on the data entry form.   
 
Reporting Serious or Unexpected Adverse Events  
A serious adverse  event is any untoward occurrence that: 
 results in death, 

 is life-threatening (a non-life-threatening event which, had it been more severe, might have 
b
ecome life-threatening, is not necessarily considered a serious adverse event), 
 requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], 

 results in significant disability/incapacity, or  

 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 
An
 Unanticipated Adverse Device Event  (UADE) is defined as an adverse event caused by, or 
associated with, a device, if that effect or problem was not previously identified in nature, 
severity, or degree of incidence. 
All anticipated Adverse Events will be reported in details to both the IRB and FDA with the 
results of the study within [ADDRESS_674923]. 
The CGM (Dexcom Share AP) malfunctions which are not related to the modifications of the 
interface to include them as components of the AP device will be reported to its respective 
manufacturers as a complaint per MDR requirements (Dexcom for the Share AP CGM). 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL 
 
 Version Date:  10/14/16 Page 34 
Malfunctions related to the interfaces of the CGM with the DiAs platform will also be 
reported to their respective manufacturers within 10 days. 
The principal investigator/s is responsible for informing the UVA IRB of serious study-related 
adverse events and abiding by [CONTACT_520330], experience that meets ALL 3 criteria below: 
 not anticipated or foreseen (e.g., not described in the consent form); 
 involves risk or harm to a research participant or others; and 
 probably, definitely related to, or caused by, the research. 
Def
inition of a protocol violation 
A protocol violation is defined as an accidental or unintentional change to the IRB approved 
protocol that harmed participants or others or that indicates participants or others may be at 
increased risk of harm.  
Definition of a Pr otoc ol Enrollment Ex ception 
No enrollment exceptions will be permitted in this trial. 
Definition of a Data Breach 
A data breach is defined in the HITECH Act (43 USC [ZIP_CODE]) as an unauthorized acquisition, 
access, or use of protected health information (PHI) tha t compromise s the security or privacy of 
such information. 
Dat
a Collection 
Endpoint data be collected/recorded in the form of source documents and will be stored on a 
database on a Health Systems Computing Services (HS/CS) managed server that is configured to 
store data regulated by [CONTACT_2373].

Recor ding, Re porting, and Grading  
Only adverse events that a re d eemed relate d AND serious will be reco rded, reporte d, and 
gr
aded. The princ ipal inve stigato r will be responsible f or the overall safety monitoring of the 
st
udy. The principal investigator, along with the sub- inve stigators, will review the individual 
ad
verse events as they o ccur.  Any event that merits ad verse eve nt reporting will be collected 
and recorde d in the I RB databa se by [CONTACT_259589] e IRB Adverse Eve nt Reporting form online.  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_520298] a report o f all adverse events 
reported on the study to do an aggregate re view.  If the AE is unexp ected and s erious, a signed 
hard copy of the IRB Adverse Event Reporting form will be submitted to the I RB with in 7

CATASTROPHIC EVENT PLAN 
The Outpatient Emergency Plan will go into effect should a catastrophic event occur during the 
study admissions. A catastrophic event is defined as any event that requires emergency 
tr
eatment by [CONTACT_520331]. A 
copy of this plan will be located at the monitoring desk. Staff will be aware of its location at all 
times. 
In the unlikely event of a disruption in [ADDRESS_674924] their local non-
emergency number (e.g. Charlottesville-UVA-Albe marle Emergency Communications Center can 
be reached 
via their non-emergency num ber 434- 977-904 1). This numbe r feeds into their main 
ca

ENDPOINTS 
We assess the risk to the subject by [CONTACT_520333], based of the blinded CGM data, retrofitted to the SMBG point (see 
DelFavero et al. JDST 2015). Gaps of less than 3h will be filled using spline based interpolation. 
LBGI is the primary endpoint. 
LBGI and HBGI are measures of glycemic risk that were developed by [CONTACT_520334] 
1990s and have been shown to be predictive of increased frequency of severe hypoglycemia 
and increased HbA1c. Detailed formula can be found in Kovatchev et al. Diabetes Care 1998. 
In addition we will capture: 
 Quality of glycemic control using the percent time spent between 70mg/dl and 
180mg/dl. 
 Meal insulin coverage will be assessed using Area Under the glucose Curve in the 
postprandial state. 
CLINICAL PROTOCOL 
 
 Version Date:  10/14/16 Page 38 
 Glucose variability will be assessed using the Risk Index (sum of LBGI and HBGI). 
SUCCESS CRITERIA / GOAL 
As a general rule, a session will be considered useful for data analysis if the subject completes 
more than 80% of the active study protocol. Subjects completing less than 80% of the protocol 
may be rescheduled.   
Safety and feasibility will mean that using our system, subjects will not increase either their risk 
of hypoglycemia as measured by [CONTACT_461157] (non-inferiority claim) 
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  
All variables are continuous and though bounded by [ADDRESS_674926].

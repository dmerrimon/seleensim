Safety evaluation/Endpoints:
NCI Common Toxicity Criteria Version 4.0
Rationale for number of subjects:Primary objective is to determine the overall
response rate. Historically ORR with single agent nivolumab in CRC is <5% and metformin
and nivolumab combination will have ORR of 15%. Simon’s MinMax two stage design is
employed for the study with power of 80% and alpha of 0.1. If there is [ADDRESS_274978] stage of the study, then it will proceed with second stage to enroll total
of 28 patients. If there are 3 or more responders out of the 28 patients then it would be
positive study. This will enable us to evaluate clinical endpoints (ORR, CEA, RFS, OS) as
well as evaluate the impact on immune biomarkers.

114. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
4.1Study Disease
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the US and it is estimated to cause
more than 50,000 deaths in 2018. [1] Approximately 20% of patients have metastatic CRC at
initial presentation who have a 5 year overall survival of 14%. [1] Clear majority of the CRCs
develop through chromosomal instability (CIN) pathway and approximately 15% develop
from the microsatellite instability (MSI) pathway which results from deficient DNA mismatch
repair (MMR). [2] While about 15% of all CRCs are MSI-H, about 4% of metastatic CRCs are
MSI-H. [3] Germline mutations in MMR genes such as MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 or
epi[INVESTIGATOR_228389]1 gene cause deficient MMR. MSI-H CRCs have better stage
adjusted prognosis compared to MSS CRCs. [2] Consensus molecular subtype (CMSs) system
classifies CRCs into 4 different gene expression-based molecular subtypes: CMS1 (14%,
microsatellite unstable with strong immune activation and hypermutated), CMS2 (canonical,
37%, epi[INVESTIGATOR_228390], strong WNT and MYC Signaling activation), CMS3 (13%,
characterized with metabolic dysregulation and KRAS mutations) and CMS4 (mesenchymal,
23%, phenotype with strong transforming growth factor beta activation, stromal invasion and
angiogenesis), an unclassified group with mixed features represent 13% of remaining cases.
[4] The immunological signatures of tumor microenvironment (TME) and the molecular
subtypes were shown to be correlated. [Becht et al] CMS1 is the most immunogenic subtype
of all four subtypes while the CMS4 is the second most immunogenic. [4, 5] Immunotherapy
with checkpoint inhibitors has been proven to be very effective in the treatment of metastatic
CRC with high level of Microsatellite Instability (MSI-H), but ineffective in Microsatellite
Stable (MSS) CRC. [6] Immunotherapy with anti-PD-[ADDRESS_274979] line systemic chemotherapy. [7] MSI-H
tumors respond to check point inhibitors because of high mutational rate, up 20 times higher
compared to MSS CRC, as well as significant immune checkpoint expression [5]. At the
present time patients with MSI-H status, high expression of neo-antigens and TILs are good
candidates for check point inhibition whereas MSS CRC patients lack response to
immunotherapy due to opposite tumor features. [5] TME is essential for prognosis and is a
viable target for anti-cancer therapy by [CONTACT_228422]. Only a small set
(4%) of metastatic CRCs would be candidate for anti-PD-1 therapy therefore there is
significant unmet need for innovative approaches to combine anti-PD1 therapy with other
agents to achieve manipulation of TME of CRCs and sensitize MSS CRCs to anti-PD-1
therapy. For example, by [CONTACT_228423] (ORR
17%, 4PR, 5SD) were reported in MSS patients when a checkpoint inhibitor was combined
with Cobimetinib in a phase Ib trial based on preclinical data showing increased intratumoral
CD8+ T cell infiltration and increased sensitivity to PDL-1 inhibition. [8] The preclinical
rationale was also confirmed in this phase Ib trial by [CONTACT_228424]8+ T cell
infiltration, MHC-I expression and PDL-1 upregulation in serial tumor biopsies on treatment.
4.2 Investigational Agents
4.2.1
Nivolumab in CRC:
Winship Protocol #: Winship4494-18
Protocol: Nivolumab + Metformin12
Protocol/Amendment No.:Version 6/June 13, 2023
12Immune checkpoint expression as programmed death 1 (PD-1) or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-
associated antigen (CTLA-4) by [CONTACT_228425].
[3, 9] PD-1, a member or B7/CD28 costimulatory receptor family, down regulates T-cell
activation by [CONTACT_228426] 1 (PD-L1) and programmed
death ligand 2 (PDL-2). Nivolumab is a fully humanized monoclonal IGG4 anti-PD-1 inhibitor
which is currently approved for MSI-H CRC after progression on systemic chemotherapy.
Nivolumab was studied as a single agent at doses of 0.3-10 mg/kg in the first phase I study in
39 patients with advanced solid tumors, 1/14 CRC patients achieved durable complete response
(CR), no maximum tolerated dose was determined. [10] That patient had MSI-H positive CRC.
In the following phase Ib study with single agent Nivolumab at a dose of 0.1-10 mg/kg IV in
296 patients with treatment refractory solid tumors none of the 19 CRC patients had objective
response. Of note these patients included predominantly MSS CRCs. [11]
CheckMate 142 Phase II study of single agent Nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks in 74
treatment refractory MSI-H CRC patients revealed 31.1% objective response rate (ORR), 3%
complete response (CR) and 69% disease control rate (DCR) for 12 weeks or longer at a
median follow up of 12 months. [12] More updated results of the same study at median follow
up of 21 months revealed 34% ORR, 9% CR, and 62% DCR. [13] The response rates did not
differ between Tumor expression of PD-Ll≥1% and <1% in the same study. CheckMate142
trial currently has multiple arms with Nivolumab combined with other agents.
Most commonly reported grade 3 or 4 adverse events in CheckMate142 study included
elevated lipase (8%) elevated amylase (3%); and rest of grade 3 or 4 adverse events included
fatigue (1%), diarrhea (1%), maculopapular rash (1%), increased alanine aminotransferase
(1%), stomatitis (1%), abdominal pain (1%), increased creatinine (1%), decreased lymphocyte
count (1%), colitis (1%), acute kidney injury (1%), adrenal insufficiency (1%), esophagitis
(1%), increased gamma-glutamyltransferase (1%), gastritis (1%), pain (1%) No treatment
related deaths were reported.
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for additional information for preclinical activity,
toxicology and potential adverse effects.
4.2.2
Metformin in CRC:
Metformin is a biguanide and decreases liver glucose production and increases insulin
sensitivity. It is the first line therapy and most commonly prescribed antidiabetic agent for
diabetes mellitus type II. It has favorable safety profile, weight neutral effects, low risk of
hypoglycemia and low cost. [14] Immediate release (IR) and extended release formulations
(ER) exist and extended release formulation provides better tolerability especially lower
gastrointestinal adverse events as well as improved patient adherence. ER formulation provides
gradual release of the drug into upper GI tract although it provides similar drug exposure at the
same daily total dose as immediate release formulation. [14] Maximum plasma concentration
of IR Metformin is reached at 2-3 hours and 7 hours for ER Metformin. [15] ER tablets cannot
be crashed or chewed and should be swallowed whole in order to maintain slow drug release.
The most common adverse events were reported as following in a 16-week, randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with type II diabetes: upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_228391] #: Winship4494-18

13infection (15%), diarrhea (12.9%), nausea/vomiting (8.2%), musculoskeletal pain (7.6%),
headache (7.1%), influenza (6.6%), dyspepsia/heartburn (5.3%), abdominal pain (5.1%), sinus
abnormality (3.7%), dizziness (3.4%), hypertension (3.1%), urinary tract infection (3.1%).That
particular study included 5 different treatment regimens including Metformin ER 1000 mg po
twice daily.
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for additional information for preclinical activity,
toxicology and potential adverse effects.
Several epi[INVESTIGATOR_228392]. A meta-analysis revealed decreased risk of colorectal
cancer incidence diabetic patients who are on metformin and improved overall mortality, CRC
specific mortality in CRC patients who are on metformin compared to those who are not. [16,
17] In meta-analysis by [CONTACT_228427]. improved overall survival (OS), HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.65 to
0.87, was reported for metformin users compared to nonusers in patients with CRC and
diabetes although no cancer specific survival, HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.08, was detected.
[18] Anticancer properties of Metformin were attributed to mTOR inhibition through AMPK
pathway activation. [19] The positive therapeutic effects of metformin were shown in colon
cancer and lung cancer patients with diabetes on metformin versus other antidiabetic drugs in
a single institution retrospective study. [20] In that study colon cancer (104 on metformin, 98
non-metformin) and lung cancer (93 metformin and 87 non-metformin) patients with diabetes
were stratified according to being on metformin versus other antidiabetic medications between
1998 and 2012. 94.2% of patients were treated with surgery, 44.2% were treated with
chemotherapy, and 14.4% were treated with radiation therapy in colon cancer patients on
metformin as opposed to 89.8%, 48% an 18.4% in non-metformin cohort with colon cancer.
In the colon cancer group better OS (5.7 versus 4.1 years, p=0.001), better 5-year OS rates
(57% vs 37%, p=0.004), rate of CEA decrease (72% versus 47%, p=0.015), less metastasis
(23% versus 46%, p=0.001), less number of deaths (48% versus 76%, p<0.001) and less
recurrences (4% versus 19%, p=0.002) were seen in the metformin group compared to non-
metformin group. Additionally, better 5-year OS rates (29% versus 15%. P=0.023) and OS
(3.4 vs 1.8 years, p<0.001) were reported in patients on metformin compared to non-metformin
antidiabetic medication group in lung cancer cohort. 48.4% received surgery, 47.3% received
chemotherapy, and 40.9% received radiation therapy metformin cohort with lung cancer
patients compared to 40.2%, 42.5%, 47.1% in non-metformin cohort, respectively. No clinical
staging information was included for either colon cancer or lung cancer patients in this report.
In a nationwide population-based study from Taiwan including 47,597 patients with DMII
metformin use was associated with lower risk of CRC in a dose dependent manner. [21]
More recently multiple immunomodulatory effects of Metformin have been shown which
points to potential synergistic effect of Metformin with anti-PD-1 therapy in CRC. [22, 23]

Protocol: Nivolumab + Metformin14
Protocol/Amendment No.:Version 6/June 13, [ADDRESS_274981] immunomodulatory properties that could complement
PD-1 blockade and may potentially increase the sensitivity of MSS metastatic CRC patients to
PD-1 inhibition. [22, 23] Longer PFS and OS was reported in CRC patients with higher CD8+
T cell and memory T cell infiltration highlighting the potential role of immunomodulation as
a mechanism by [CONTACT_228428].
Immune effects of Metformin in tumor microenvironment:
1. Metformin increased CD8+ tumor infiltrating T cells (TILs) and prevented apoptosis
and immune exhaustion of TILs. Metformin prevents apoptosis of CD 8+ tumor
infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and restored multi-functionality of PD1+, Tim3+
CD8+ TIL by [CONTACT_6561] a phenotypic switch of T cells to adopt central memory and
effector phenotypes in murine tumor models. [22]
2. Metformin has metabolic properties that favor decreased intratumoral oxygen
consumption in vitro and in vivo, while it increased the oxygen consumption by [CONTACT_398] 8+
TIL and improved the effector cytokine production by [CONTACT_398]8+ TIL in B16 melanoma
and MC38 colon adenocarcinoma tumor models. [23]
3. Expression of coinhibitory molecules PD1 and Tim3 was modulated in metformin
treated mice compared to controls. [23]
4. The combination of metformin and PD1 inhibitor resulted in improved intratumoral T
cell function and increased anti-tumor activity. [23]
5. The metformin and PD-1 inhibitor combination improved antitumor activity and
intratumoral T cell function. [23]
Preclinical data strongly suggests that metformin can improve immune exhaustion of TIL and
potentiate the effects of immunotherapy.Based on this preclinical rationale, in this study
we propose evaluating the effects of metformin in potentiating the effects of
immunotherapy in patients with treatment refractory metastatic MSS CRC patients.
4.4 Correlative Studies Background
Abundant CD8+ T cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment is associated with a survival
advantage in CRCs, independent of tumor stage. [24] Individual molecular subtypes of CRCs
have distinct immunological features. For example, CMS1 CRCs have upregulation of Th1
lymphocytes, cytotoxic T cells, NK cell infiltration and PD-1 expression. These features are
correlated with better clinical outcomes in CRCs. [25] In contrast, tumors displaying an
immune infiltration pattern with presence of Th17 cells, IL-17, Tregs, and MDSCs are
associated with poorer outcomes in CRCs. [24, 26] Preclinical studies demonstrated that
metformin could modulate the TME and improve CD8+ T cell infiltration and function,
decrease tumor cell oxygen consumption and increase CD8+ T cell oxygen consumption. [22,
23] The current study aims to harness the immunomodulatory effects of metformin, and
potential clinical benefit in combination with an anti-PD-1 agent, nivolumab, by [CONTACT_228429]. Therefore, we aim to analyze the immunogenic
profile of the tumors by [CONTACT_228430] #: Winship4494-18
Protocol: Nivolumab + Metformin15
Protocol/Amendment No.:Version 6/June 13, [ADDRESS_274982] biopsy tissue will be evaluated using IHC or immunofluorescence for relevant
lymphocyte, myeloid and stromal/vascular markers to provide a comprehensive view of the
cellular composition within the TME. Tissue will also be dissociated and flow cytometry will
be used to further define phenotypic properties of macrophages, lymphocytes or other cell
populations. In addition, we plan to perform on a subset of these patients, genomic analysis of
lymphocyte population.
Metformin is a mitochondrial electron transport chain Complex I inhibitor. The basis for co-
administration of metformin with anti-PD-1 therapy relies on inhibiting Complex I activity in
tumor cells, reducing oxygen consumption rates (OCR) in tumor cells while concomitantly
increasing oxygen in the surrounding microenvironment and oxidative metabolism of the
infiltrating T cell subsets. We will performex vivostudies to determine whether oxidative
metabolism is indeed regulated in the tumor and T cell subsets. Pre and post therapy tumor
sections will be evaluated for expression of the following: OCT-1 (metformin transporter), p-
AMPK (that is known to be activated with metformin), mTOR pathway (should be suppressed
as a consequence of AMPK activation), HIF1a, Caspase 3, and Ki67. Intracellular oxygen
levels in tumor and stroma will be evaluated using HypoxyprobeTMto confirm OXPHOS
inhibition. Sorted T cells populations will be evaluated for baseline OCR and OCR/ECAR
(extra-cellular acidification) with and without short-term exogenous metformin administration
using a Seahorse Bioenergetics bioanalyzer. In addition, viability of T cells with metformin or
specific complex I inhibitors (rotenone/pi[INVESTIGATOR_228393]) will be evaluated. Glycolytic gene

6.2 DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS
6.2.1 Metformin
The following guidelines are provided for the modification of the dose of metformin in the
event of toxicities attributed by [CONTACT_228432]. Toxicities unrelated to
metformin will not ordinarily result in the modification of dose. AEs will be defined based on
the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
(CTCAE) version 4.
In general, subjects experiencingGrade [ADDRESS_274997] the
dose of metformin modified. However, appropriate supportive care should be provided for the
management of drug related toxicities. Grade 2 toxicities may require dose or schedule
modifications (delaying or omitting individual doses) due to potentially greater clinical
significance; however, this should occur after discussion with study PI.
Dosing of metformin must be delayed if a subject experiences aGrade 3 non-hematologic
toxicity. If the toxicity resolves (returned to baseline or decreased to Grade≤1) within 7 days,
dosing of metformin may be resumed one lower dose level (See section 6 Table 3). Exceptions
to this rule are as follows:
Grade 3 fatigue: dose modification is left to the PI’s discretion;
Winship Protocol #: Winship4494-18
Protocol: Nivolumab + Metformin22
Protocol/Amendment No.:Version 6/June 13, 2023
22Grade 3 nausea, vomiting and diarrhea: dose modification only after optimal
prophylactic measures have failed to control the symptoms adequately;
In the case of Grade 4non-hematologictoxicity,or persistent Grade 3toxicity despi[INVESTIGATOR_228395], metformin will be discontinued.
No dose adjustment of metformin will be performed for anemia.
No dose adjustment for Metformin will be performed for grade 1, 2, or 3 neutropenia or grade
1, 2, or 3(without bleeding) thrombocytopenia.
Dosing of metformin will be delayed if subjects develop grade 4 neutropenia or grade 3
thrombocytopenia complicated by [CONTACT_228433] 4 thrombocytopenia. If the toxicity
resolves (returned to baseline or decreased to Grade≤1) within 14 days, dosing of metformin
may be resumed one lower dose level (See section 6 Table 3).

6.2.2 Nivolumab
Adverse events (both non-serious and serious) associated with nivolumab exposure may
represent an immunologic etiology. These adverse events may occur shortly after the first dose
or several months after the last dose of treatment. nivolumab must be withheld for drug-related
toxicities and severe or life-threatening AEs as per 3 below. See Section 6.6.1 for supportive
care guidelines, including use of corticosteroids.
Toxicities unrelated to nivolumab will not ordinarily result in the modification of nivolumab
dose. AEs will be defined based on the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.
Dose Modification Guidelines for Drug-Related Adverse Events- Nivolumab
1.Corticosteroid taper should be initiated upon AE improving to Grade [ADDRESS_274998]
dose or corticosteroids cannot be reduced to≤10mg prednisone or equivalent per day
within [ADDRESS_274999]
followed by [CONTACT_44874]. Other immunosuppressive treatment should be initiated if
irAEs cannot be controlled by [CONTACT_13216].

5.Newly developed Type I diabetes mellitus: Follow endocrinopathy adverse event
management algorithm. Permanently discontinue Nivolumab if associated
hyperglycemia is grade 4.
6.Dosing interruptions are permitted in the case of medical / surgical events or logistical
reasons not related to study therapy (e.g., elective surgery, unrelated medical events,
patient vacation, and/or holidays). Subjects should be placed back on study therapy
within 3 weeks of the scheduled interruption, unless otherwise discussed with the
Sponsor-investigator. The reason for interruption should be documented in the patient's
study record.

Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_228397] (including retreatment for post-complete response relapse) of this trial:
Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody or biological therapy
Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol
Investigational agents other than Nivolumab and Metformin
Radiation therapy
oNote: Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion or to the brain may
be allowed at the investigator’s discretion. Nivolumab will be held during
radiation and can be resumed after radiation is finished and patient is stable per
the treating physician. Metformin can be resumed during radiation.
Live vaccines within [ADDRESS_275003] dose of trial treatment and while
participating in the trial. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the
following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and
typhoid vaccine.
Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an
event of clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology. The use of physiologic
doses of corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the Sponsor -
investigator.
Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or PgP
Co-administration with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole,
ritonavir) is prohibited.
Co-administration with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin,

Moderate inducers of CYP3A4 are allowed if alternatives are not available.
Subjects who, in the assessment by [CONTACT_093], require the use of any of the
aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from the trial. Subjects
may receive other medications that the investigator deems to be medically necessary.
There are no prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3927]-Treatment Follow-up Phase.
6.6 Rescue Medications & Supportive Care
6.6.1 Supportive Care Guidelines
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_228434]. Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse
events with potential immunologic etiology are outlined in Section 6.2. Where appropriate,
these guidelines include the use of oral or intravenous treatment with corticosteroids as well as
additional anti-inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with administration of
corticosteroids. Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms
may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be made to
rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might
require additional supportive care. The treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when
the investigator determines the events to be related to nivolumab.
Note: if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the investigator does not
need to follow the treatment guidance (as outlined below). Refer to Section 6.2 for dose
modification.
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or
skin photography as part of evaluation of the event.

shortly after drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of
completion of infusion

progression will be considered inevaluable for the primary endpoint and will be replaced.
8.1.2 Clinical Procedures/Assessments
Winship Protocol #: Winship4494-18
Protocol: Nivolumab + Metformin41
Protocol/Amendment No.:Version 6/June 13, 2023
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event (AE) Monitoring
The investigator or qualified designee will assess each subject to evaluate for potential new or
worsening AEs as specified in the Trial Flow Chart and more frequently if clinically indicated.
Adverse experiences will be graded and recorded throughout the study and during the follow-up
period according to NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 (see Section 11.2). Toxicities will be characterized
in terms regarding seriousness, causality, toxicity grading, and action taken with regard to trial
treatment.
For subjects receiving treatment with nivolumab all AEs of unknown etiology associated with
nivolumab exposure should be evaluated to determine if it is possibly an event of clinical interest
(ECI) of a potentially immunologic etiology (termed immune-related adverse events, or irAEs, see
section 6.2.2).
Please refer to section 8.2 for detailed information regarding the assessment and recording of AEs.
Winship Cancer Institute’s Clinical Trials Office will perform the quality assurance and quality
control checks on this clinical trial. Before enrollment of any subject in this study, CTO personnel
and the Investigator will review the protocol; the Investigator’s Brochure; the CRFs/electronic
CRFs and instructions for completion; the informed consent process; and the procedure for
reporting AEs and SAEs.
[IP_ADDRESS] Full Physical Exam
The investigator or qualified designee will perform a complete physical exam during the screening
period. Clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as medical history. A full
physical exam should be performed during screening,
[IP_ADDRESS] Directed Physical Exam
For cycles that do not require a full physical exam per the Trial Flow Chart, the investigator or
qualified designee will perform a directed physical exam as clinically indicated prior to trial
treatment administration.
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs
The investigator or qualified designee will take vital signs at screening, prior to the administration
of each dose of trial treatment and at treatment discontinuation as specified in the Trial Flow Chart
(Section 6.0). Vital signs should include temperature, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], weight and blood
pressure. Height will be measured at screening only.
[IP_ADDRESS] Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Scale
The investigator or qualified designee will assess ECOG status (see Section 11.1) at screening
(within 14 days of day 1 cycle 1), prior to the administration of each dose of trial treatment and
discontinuation of trial treatment as specified in the Trial Flow Chart.

428.1.3 Tumor Imaging and Assessment of Disease
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.[ADDRESS_275023] version 1.1* will be used in this study for assessment of tumor response. While either
CT or MRI may be utilized, as per RECIST 1.1, CT is the preferred imaging technique in this
study.
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Tissue Collection and Correlative Studies Blood Sampling
Paired biopsies (biopsy#1) will be obtained at baseline from all [ADDRESS_275024]-9, 19-23 (14 patients in total) will get post
treatment biopsy (biopsy#2) cycle 1 Day 1 (same day or up to 5 days later) and subject# 10-18,
24-28 (14 patients in total) will get post treatment biopsy (biopsy#2) C1 Day 15 (same day or up
to 5 days later). Most accessible metastatic disease tumor site will be biopsied by [CONTACT_228435]. Same site will be biopsied at biopsy#1 and biopsy#2. We don’t believe
biopsy site bias the study as any metastatic site which is deemed safe and accessible can be
biopsied. 3 core biopsies will be obtained each time. If a patient undergoes biopsy#1 and refuse
biopsy#[ADDRESS_275025]:
1) RNAlater for RNA stabilization and tissue storage
2) Formalin-fixed paraffin block with one cut H&E stained slide
3) Liquid nitrogen frozen tissue in cryo-preservation vials
All collected tissues are stabilized and stored in -80°C freezers (RNAlater stabilized, OCT
embedded, short term storage) or the vapor phase of a liquid nitrogen freezer (long term storage)
in single use aliquots. All FFPE tissue blocks are stored in a climate-controlled storage room that
is temperature (less than 27ºC) and humidity controlled.
Tissue will be evaluated using IHC or immunofluorescence to measure relevant immune markers
(i.e. CD3, CD4, CD8, CD163, PD-1, PD-2, PDL-1, MIF, TAM and stromal/ vascular markers).
When sufficient quantities of fresh tissue is available, it will also be dissociated and flow cytometry
will be used to determine the phenotypic characteristics of cell populations in the tumor
microenvironment. Tissue will be preserved for future exploratory studies including genomic
profiling.
Peripheral blood samples
Approximately 20 mL of peripheral blood will be collected prior to initiation of study therapy (at
baseline), cycle 1 day 1, cycle 1 day 15, Cycle 3 Day 1 and at progression. The peripheral blood
mononuclear cells will be isolated from these samples and stored in -80°C freezers until analysis.
Samples will be evaluated for:
i. Determine whether there are phenotypic changes in of T-cell or myeloid cell surface
markers (including co-stimulatory/immune checkpoint molecules) in PBMCs after treatment.
Samples will be collected at baseline, cycle 1 day 1, cycle 1 day 15, Cycle 3 Day 1 and at
progression.
ii. Determine whether functional changes are evident in PBMCs in response to treatment and
whether these data correlate with clinical outcome measures. Samples will be collected at baseline
and week 10th. Pending quantity of cells a variety of assays may be performed, including but not
limited to intracellular cytokine production and expression of CD107.

8.2 Assessing and Recording Adverse Events
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a
preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation participant administered study drug and
that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be
any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or
disease temporally associated with the use of investigational product, whether or not considered
related to the investigational product.
Anon-serious adverse eventis an AE not classified as serious.
8.2.1 Serious Adverse Events
ASerious Adverse Event (SAE)is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
results in death
is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time
of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it
were more severe)
Winship Protocol #: Winship4494-18
Protocol: Nivolumab + Metformin51
Protocol/Amendment No.:Version 6/June 13, 2023
51requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312] (see
NOTEbelow)
results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life-
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical and
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical,
surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.) Examples
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study
drug is an SAE.
Unusual Failure in Efficacy (for Phase IV Canadian studies)
Although pregnancy and potential drug-induced liver injury (DILI), are not always serious by
[CONTACT_8661], however, these events must be reported within the SAEs timeline.
Any component of a study endpoint that is considered related to study therapy should be reported
as an SAE (eg, death is an endpoint, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be
reported).
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8609]:
a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours, that does not result
in admission (unless considered an important medical or life-threatening event)
elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure
routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (eg,
routine colonoscopy)
Medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry into
the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases.
Admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status
and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic inadequacy,
caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative reason).
Admission for administration of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other SAEs (applies
to oncology protocols)

[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of Serious Adverse Events Associated with Nivolumab
All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) that occur following the subject’s written consent to
participate in the study through [ADDRESS_275033] be collected that relate to any later protocol-specified procedure (eg,
a follow-up skin biopsy).
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related
or not related to study drug, are collected, including those thought to be associated with
protocol-specified procedures. The investigator should report any SAE occurring after these
aforementioned time periods, which is believed to be related to study drug or protocol-
specified procedure to BMS.
An SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its
seriousness;
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related
to the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy or a complication of a
study procedure), the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE
Report Form.
An appropriate SAE form (e.g. ex-US = CIOMS form or [LOCATION_003] = Medwatch form) should be used
to report SAEs to BMS. If you prefer to use your own Institutional form, it must be reviewed by
[CONTACT_228439] a minimum all of the data

The data elements listed on the GPV&E reconciliation report will be used
for case identification purposes. If the Investigator determines a case was
not transmitted to BMS GPV&E, the case should be sent immediately to
BMS ([EMAIL_555]).
In addition to the Sponsor Investigator’s responsibility to report events to the FDA ,
suspected serious adverse reactions (whether expected or unexpected) shall be reported by

Protocol/Amendment No.:Version 6/June 13, 2023
53BMS to the relevant competent health authorities in all concerned countries according to
local regulations (either as expedited and/or in aggregate reports).
In accordance with local regulations, BMS will notify sponsor investigators of all reported
SAEs that are suspected (related to the investigational product) and unexpected (ie, not
previously described in the IB). An event meeting these criteria is termed a Suspected,
Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R). Sponsor investigator notification of these
events will be in the form of either a S[LOCATION_003]R Report or a Semi-Annual S[LOCATION_003]R Report.
Other important findings which may be reported by [CONTACT_228441]
(ESR) include: increased frequency of a clinically significant expected SAE, an SAE
considered associated with study procedures that could modify the conduct of the study,
lack of efficacy that poses significant hazard to study subjects, clinically significant
safety finding from a nonclinical (eg, animal) study, important safety recommendations
from a study data monitoring committee, or sponsor or BMS decision to end or
temporarily halt a clinical study for safety reasons.
Upon receiving an ESR from BMS, the investigator must review and retain the ESR
with the IB. Where required by [CONTACT_34342] a central IRB/IEC for
the study, the sponsor will submit the ESR to the appropriate IRB/IEC. The investigator
and IRB/IEC will determine if the informed consent requires revision. The investigator
should also comply with the IRB/IEC procedures for reporting any other safety
information.
SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS
within 24 hours \ [ADDRESS_275034] complete.
SAE Email Address:[EMAIL_176]
SAE Facsimile Number:+[PHONE_1161]
If only limited information is initially available, follow-up reports are required. (Note: Follow-up
SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.)
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new information
becomes available, a follow-up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours \ 1 Business Day to
BMS using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.
All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.
The causal relationship to study drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess all
adverse events (AE). The casual relationship can be one of the following:
Winship Protocol #: Winship4494-18
Protocol: Nivolumab + Metformin54
Protocol/Amendment No.:Version 6/June 13, 2023
54Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between study drug administration and the AE.
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study drug administration and
the AE.
The term "reasonable causal relationship" means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship.
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open-ended questioning,
examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
8.2.2 Nonserious Adverse Event
Non-serious Adverse Events (AE) are to be provided to BMS in aggregate via interim or
final study reports as specified in the agreement or, if a regulatory requirement [eg, IND
US trial] as part of an annual reporting requirement.
Non-serious AE information should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead-in
period or other observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects.
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
The collection of non-serious AE information should begin at initiation of study drug. All
non-serious adverse events (not only those deemed to be treatment-related) should be collected
continuously during the treatment period and for a minimum of [ADDRESS_275035] results that constitute SAEs should be documented and reported to BMS as such.
The following laboratory abnormalities should be documented and reported appropriately:
any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an SAE
any laboratory abnormality that required the participant to have study drug discontinued or
interrupted
any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to receive specific corrective therapy.
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be used by [CONTACT_228442] (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).

The investigator must immediately notify [EMAIL_555] of this event and complete
one of the following forms within [ADDRESS_275037] be reported to the FDA/IRB per FDA and IRB
guidelines. These requirements are briefly outlined in the tables below (Section 8.3.2).
Written IND safety reports will be submitted to the FDA by [CONTACT_106507], for serious,
unexpected suspected adverse reactions within 15 calendar days of learning of its
occurrence. If the event is fatal or is deemed to be life threatening, the report will be made
within 7 calendar days. The IND sponsor will also make an assessment of whether the
event constitutes an unanticipated problem posing risks to subjects or others (UP). This
assessment will be provided to the Emory University IRB, which, in turn will make a final
determination. If the Emory IRB determines an event is a UP it will notify the appropriate
regulatory agencies and institutional officials.

568.3.2 Table 6 Evaluating Adverse Events
An investigator who is a qualified physician, will evaluate all adverse events as to:
V4.0 CTCAE
GradingGrade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mid symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated.
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental ADL.
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228409]; disabling; limiting self-care ADL.
Grade 4 Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.
Grade [ADDRESS_275038] that:
†Results in death; or
†Is life threatening; orplaces the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred (Note: This
does not include an adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.); or
†Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity(substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions); or
†Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059](hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19357], regardless of length of
stay, even if the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138] a precautionary measure for continued observation. (Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19358]
a pre-existing condition that has not worsened is not a serious adverse event. A pre-existing condition is a clinical condition that is diagnosed
prior to the use of investigational products and is documented in the patient’s medical history.); or
†Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect(in offspring of subject taking the product regardless of time to diagnosis);or
Is anewcancer(that is not a condition of the study)(although not serious per ICH definition, is reportable to the Sponsor within 24 hours
and to BMS within 2 working days to meet certain local requirements);or
Is an overdose(whether accidental or intentional). Any adverse event associated with an overdose is considered a serious adverse event for
collection purposes. An overdose that is not associated with an adverse event is considered a non-serious event of clinical interest and must
be reported within [ADDRESS_275039] and may require medical or
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed previously (designated above by a †).
DurationRecord the start and stop dates of the adverse event. If less than 1 day, indicate the appropriate length of time and units
Action takenDid the adverse event cause investigational products to be discontinued?
Relationship
to
investigational
Product(s)Did investigational product(s) cause the adverse event? The determination of the likelihood that investigational product(s) caused the adverse
event will be provided by [CONTACT_19427] a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or
worksheet that supports the causality noted on the AE form, ensures that a medically qualified assessment of causality was done. This initialed
document must be retained for the required regulatory time frame. The criteria below are intended as reference guidelines to assist the
investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relationship between the test drug and the adverse event based upon the available information.
The following components are to be used to assess the relationship betweeninvestigationalproduct and the AE; the greater the
correlation with the components and their respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the more likely BMS product caused the adverse
event (AE):
ExposureIs there evidence that the subject was actually exposed to investigational product(s) such as: reliable history, acceptable
compliance assessment (pi[INVESTIGATOR_692], diary, etc.), expected pharmacologic effect, or measurement of drug/metabolite in bodily
specimen?
Time
CourseDid the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of investigational product(s)?
Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a drug-induced effect (applies to trials with investigational medicinal product)?
Likely
CauseIs the AE not reasonably explained by [CONTACT_26369], other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or
environmental factors

8.4 Routine Adverse Event Reporting
All Adverse Eventsmustbe reported in routine study data submissions. ALLAEs are to be
reported through ONCORE .
8.5 Secondary Malignancy
Asecondary malignancyis a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy (e.g., treatment
with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary malignancy is
not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.
All secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an IND/IDE must
be reported through ONCORE. Three options are available to describe the event:
Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia
[AML])
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
Treatment-related secondary malignancy

58Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be
reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.
8.6 Second Malignancy
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and isNOTa
metastasis from the initial malignancy).
A list of the adverse events and potential risks associated with the investigational or commercial
agents administered in this study can be found in investigator`s brochure.
9. LABELING, PACKAGING, STORAGE AND RETURN OF CLINICAL SUPPLIES

9.1.3 Packaging and Labeling Information
Clinical supplies will be affixed with a clinical label in accordance with regulatory requirements.
9.1.4 Clinical Supplies Disclosure
This trial is open-label; therefore, the subject, the trial site personnel, the Sponsor-investigator
and/or designee are not blinded to treatment. Drug identity (name, strength) is included in the label
text; random code/disclosure envelopes or lists are not provided.
9.1.5 Storage and Handling Requirements
Winship Protocol #: Winship4494-18
Protocol: Nivolumab + Metformin59
Protocol/Amendment No.:Version 6/June 13, [ADDRESS_275042] be recorded by [CONTACT_228446].
Clinical supplies may not be used for any purpose other than that stated in the protocol.
9.1.6 Returns and Reconciliation
The investigator is responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_228411], the amount dispensed to and returned by [CONTACT_228447]. Upon completion or termination of the study, all unused and/or
partially used investigational product will be destroyed at the site per institutional policy. It is the
Investigator’s responsibility to arrange for disposal of all empty containers, provided that
procedures for proper disposal have been established according to applicable federal, state, local
and institutional guidelines and procedures, and provided that appropriate records of disposal are
kept.
10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
10.1 Study Design/Endpoints/ Determination of Sample Size
This is a phase II trial. Primary objective is to determine the overall response rate. Historically
ORR with single agent Nivolumab in CRC is <5% and Metformin and Nivolumab combination
will have ORR of 15%. Simon’s MinMax two stage design is employed for the study with power
of 80% and alpha of 0.1. If there is [ADDRESS_275043] stage of the study,
then it will proceed with second stage to enroll total of 28 patients. If there are 3 or more responders
out of the 28 patients then it would be positive study. This will enable us to evaluate clinical
endpoints (ORR, CEA, RFS, OS) as well as evaluate the impact on immune biomarkers.
10.2 Statistical and Analytical Plans
Summary statistics will be presented for all safety, efficacy and biomarker parameter analyses.
The purpose of these analyses is hypothesis generating. Various exploratory statistical tests may
be applied to data generated from this trial to generate hypotheses to be tested in subsequent trials.
In general, data for continuous parameters will be presented using descriptive statistics including
sample size, mean, and median; standard deviation; and minimum and maximum. Categorical
parameters be displayed using counts and percentages. Toxicities will be presented as worst
toxicity per patient and will be reported as percent toxicity.
Objective response rate will be calculated as proportion (Responders/Total patients) along with
95% confidence intervals using the Clopper-Pearson method. Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test
will be used to compare the efficacy in term of response rate, biochemical response (CEA) between
the different groups stratified by [CONTACT_228448], respectively. Logistics regression
Winship Protocol #: Winship4494-18
Protocol: Nivolumab + Metformin60
Protocol/Amendment No.:Version 6/June 13, [ADDRESS_275044] follow-up. Overall survival (OS)
and progression free survival (PFS) rates of two patient groups stratified by [CONTACT_228449]-Meier method and compared between different groups
using the log-rank test, respectively. The PFS and OS of each patient group at specific time points,
such as 6 moths, 1 year, 3 year, and 5 year, etc. will be also estimated alone with 95% CI. Cox
proportional hazards models will be further used in the multivariable analyses to assess adjusted
effect of response on the patients’ OS and PFS after adjusting for other factors. Interaction terms
between these factors will also be tested for statistical significance. The proportional hazards
assumption will be evaluated graphically and analytically with regression diagnostics. Violations
of the proportional hazards assumptions will be addressed by [CONTACT_228450]-dependent covariates or
extended Cox regression models.
For the biomarker study, descriptive statistics will be first used to summarize biomarker endpoints,
including analyses of tumor biopsies. Biomarker data will also be displayed graphically, where
appropriate. Depending on whether data is normally distributed, t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test
will be used to compare each biomarker between any two groups stratified by [CONTACT_228451], respectively. General linear model (GLM) will be used to compare each biomarker
between responders and nonresponders with and without adjusting for other factors. Logistics
regression model will be further employed to test the adjusted effect of biomarker on the response
rate after adjusting for other factors.
10.[ADDRESS_275045] be assessed for response to treatment, even if there are
major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible. Each patient will be assigned one of
the following categories: 1) complete response, 2) partial response, 3) stable disease, 4)
progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) early
death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, insufficient data). [Note: By
[CONTACT_480], category 9 usually designates the “unknown” status of any type of data in a
clinical database.]
All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria (with the possible exception of those who
received no study medication) should be included in the main analysis of the response rate.
Patients in response categories 4-[ADDRESS_275046] a treatment failure (disease
progression). Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule or drug administration does not result in
exclusion from the analysis of the response rate. Precise definitions for categories 4-9 will be
protocol specific.

identified (e.g., early death due to other reasons, early discontinuation of treatment, major protocol
violations, etc.). However, these subanalyses may not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions
concerning treatment efficacy, and the reasons for excluding patients from the analysis should be
clearly reported. The 95% confidence intervals should also be provided.
10.[ADDRESS_275048] grade of each laboratory parameter by [CONTACT_228452] 4.0 at baseline and follow-up will be presented along with change from Baseline.
Additionally, laboratory values ≥Grade [ADDRESS_275049] basis.

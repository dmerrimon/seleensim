1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Lubricating eye drops are often used to treat symp toms of ocular dryness and discomfort.  Most 
of the major lubricating eye drop manufacturing co mpanies have some type  of lipid product to 
address lipid deficient tear films, however JJV CEH does not currently have a lipid-like 
lubricating drop in our portfolio.  
This study will be conducted at one clinical s ite in the [LOCATION_002] and will include one 
investigational lipid eye drop ( ) and one marketed lubricating eye drop (blink®Tears).  
By [CONTACT_12780][INVESTIGATOR_007] a lipid-like drop addition to the CEH portfolio it would c ontinue to support JJV 
Eye Health Mission.
1.1. Name [CONTACT_89636]:  
xInvestigational lipid eye drops  (Test) 
xBlink®Tears (Control) 
1.2. Intended Use of Inve stigational Products
One of the products is an investigational, pr eserved lipid drop, and the other product is a 
marketed eye drop in the U.S. and the EU, available over the counter (without a prescription).  
Subjects will be required to use the [ADDRESS_98564] version of the Investigator’s Brochure.
1.4. Summary of Known Risks and Benefits to Human Subjects
The following risks/adverse events can be associated with using lubricating eye drops and 
contact [CONTACT_13276], in general:
xThere may be less comfort than when the drop was first placed on the eye.
xThe eyes may burn, sting and/or itch. 
xThere may be a feeling of something in  the eye (foreign body, scratched area). 
xThere may be the potential for some temporary impairment due to peripheral infiltrates, peripheral corneal ulcers and corneal erosion.   
xThere may be the potential for other physio logical observations, such as local or 
generalized edema, corneal neovasculariza tion, corneal staining, injection, tarsal 
abnormalities, iritis and conjunctivitis, some of which are clinically acceptable in low 
amounts. 
xThere may be excessive watering, unusual eye secretions, or redness of the eye. 
CR-6371, v4.0  
Page 16 of 86JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
xPoor visual acuity, blurred vision, rainbows or halos around objects, photo-phobia, or 
dry eyes may also occur if the drops ar e used continuously or for too long a time. 
There is no direct benefit to the subject for pa rticipating in the study, although they will be able 
to try out new lubricating eye drops.  The info rmation from this study will aid if the further 
development and design of new lubricating eye drops.   
For the most comprehensive clinical information regarding the lubricating eye drops refer to 
the package inserts (Appendix B) and the la test version of the Investigator Brochure.

This is a single visit, randomized, double-mask ed, bilateral, contro lled, 2×[ADDRESS_98567]-to-follow-
up.
At Visit 1, subjects will be consented and screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria.  Baseline 
logMAR visual acuity will be measured in their ha bitual contact [CONTACT_13276].  If a subject is found 
to meet all eligibility criteria, the first lubricating eye drops will be instilled based on the randomization scheme; otherwise, the subject  will be discontinued from the study. Three
minutes and ten minutes after OD drop instillation logMAR visual acuity will be measured.  There will then be a [ADDRESS_98568] articles.

[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
4.3. Enrollment Target and Study Duration
Up to 30 subjects will be enrolled (informed c onsent signed) and randomiz ed from up to [ADDRESS_98569] articles one at a time over two study peri ods. The randomization scheme will 
be generated using the PROC PLAN procedure fr om the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) 
Software version 9.[ADDRESS_98570] baseline visit (Visit 1). The following must have 
occurred prior to randomization: 
xInformed consent has been obtained 
xSubject meets all the inclusion / exclusion criteria
xSubject history and baseline in formation has been collected 
5.2. Masking
This is a double masked study where subjects and the investigators are masked to the identity 
of the eye drops during the study period.  Every atte mpt will be made to ke ep the other clinical 
trial personnel involved in the study (e.g., Data manage ment, Biostatistician)  unaware of the 
identity of the test articles.
The identity of the investiga tional products will be masked by [CONTACT_89627] a label containing the study number, expi[INVESTIGATOR_89618].  Only 
the personnel involved in the over labeling an d the unmasked Statis tician generating the 
randomization scheme will have access to the decode information translating the 
randomization codes into Test and Control eye drops.  The medical monitor will also have access to the decode information in case breaking the mask is necessary for the urgent medical 
treatment of a subject.
5.3. Procedures for Maintainin g and Breaking the Masking
Under normal circumstances, the mask should not be broken until all subj ects have completed 
the study and the database is finalized. Otherwise, the mask shoul d be broken only if specific 
emergency treatment/course of ac tion would be dictated by [CONTACT_89628]-6371, v4.0  
Page 20 of 86JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
subject. In such cases, the Investigator may, in an emergency, contact [CONTACT_7195].  In 
the event the mask is broken, the Sponsor must be informed as soon as possible. The date, 
time, and reason for the unmasking must be documented in the subject record. The Investigator is also advised not to reveal the study treatment  assignment to the clinical site or Sponsor 
personnel.  
When dispensing test articles, the followi ng steps should be followed to maintain 
randomization codes: 
1. Investigator or designee (documented on the Delegation Log) will consult the 
randomization scheme to obtain the test article assignment for that subject prior to 
dispensing 
2. Investigator or designee will record the subject’s number on the appropriate line of the 
randomization scheme 
3. Investigator or designee will pull the appropriate test articles from the study supply.  
All test articles that are opened, whether dispensed (placed/fit on eye or dispensed outside the clinical site) or not, must be recorded on the Test Article Accountability Log in the “Dispensed” section.

xComplete the Final Evaluation, indicating th e reason that the subject was discontinued 
from the study 
An additional subject may be enrolled if a s ubject discontinues from the study prematurely.  
In cases where a subject is lost to follow-up, ever y possible effort must be made to contact [CONTACT_35508]/withdrawal. The measures taken to follow 
up must be documented including two written attempts and a certified letter (or equivalent) as the final attempt. 
9. PRE-STUDY AND CONCOMITANT INTERVENTION/MEDICATION
Concomitant medications will be documented during screeni ng and updated during the study.
Disallowed medications for this study include: Current habitual use of Prescription Only 
Medicines for dry eye or ocular  discomfort, ocular steroids, or any medication (RX or OTC) 
that would interfere with the clinical st udy (at the discretion of the investigator).
9.1. Systemic Medications
Due to the nature of the study and endpoints being assessed, medicati ons will be allowed 
provided they did not interfere with contact [CONTACT_13279], which will be at the discretion of the 
investigator.  
10. DEVIATIONS FROM THE PROTOCOL
Investigator will notify study sponsor upon identif ication of a protocol  deviation. Protocol 
deviations must be reported to the sponsor w ithin 24 hours after discovery of the protocol 
deviation. The Investigator will report deviations per IRB/IEC r equirements. All deviations 
will be tracked and corrective actions implemented as appropriate.  
CR-6371, v4.0  
Page 30 of 86JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
If it becomes necessary for the Investigator to implement a deviation in order to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to the trial subject, the Investigator may implement the deviation immediately without notification to the spons or. Within [ADDRESS_98571] notify and provide the rati onale to the Sponsor and, as 
required, the IEC/IRB.  
If the deviation potentially impacts the safety of patient or changes the technical integrity of 
the study then it must be reported to IEC/IRB. This is a "Major Deviation".
Minor deviations have no substa ntive effect on patient safety or technical integrity of the 
study.  They are often logistical in nature. The informed consent must also not be contradicted by [CONTACT_89629]. 
Visual performance assessments started at 2 minutes, or between 4 and 5 minutes after OD 
drop insertion will be considered minor deviations. Visual performance assessments started 1 
minute or less, or 6 minutes or more after OD drop insertion will be considered major deviations for the 3-minute LogMAR procedure (Steps 1.19 and 1.25).  
Visual performance assessments started at 8 minutes, or between 11 and 12 minutes after OD
drop insertion will be considered minor deviations. Assessments started 7 minutes or less, or 
13 minutes or more after OD drop insertion will be considered major deviations for the 10-minute LogMAR procedure (Steps 1.20 and 1.26).  
Protocol waivers are prohibited. 
11. STUDY TERMINATION
The occurrence of one or more Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect ([LOCATION_003]DE), or 
any SAE where the relationship to study agen t cannot be ruled out, may result in stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35446]. In the even t of a [LOCATION_003]DE or SAE, the Sponsor may unmask 
the treatment regimen for the subject(s) and will discuss this with the Investigator before any 
further subjects are enrolled. 
The Sponsor will determine when a study will be stopped. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_89619]’s results are compromised. 
JJVC reserves the right to terminate the study at any time for any reason. Additionally, the 
IEC/IRB reserves the right to terminate the study if an unreasonable risk is determined. The 
study can be terminated by [CONTACT_35511], if in their opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], after a discussion with JJVC, it is determined 
that it would be unwise to continue at the clinical site.
JJVC (and the IEC/IRB and DMC, if applicable) will evaluate all adverse events. If it is 
determined that an adverse event presents an unr easonable risk, the investigation, or that part 
of the investigation presenting the risk, will be terminated as soon as possible.

Should the study be terminated (either prematurely or as scheduled), the Investigator will 
notify the IEC/IRB and Regulatory Authority as  required by [CONTACT_35512]. 
12. PROCEDURE FOR HANDLING PRODUCT QUALITY COMPLAINTS
A Product Quality Complaint (PQC) refers to any written, electronic, or oral communication 
that alleges deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness or performance of test articles after they have been released for clinical trial use.  
Potential complaints may come from a variety of sources including but not limited to subjects, 
clinical research associates (CRA), clinical  operations managers (COM), medical monitors, 
and site personnel, etc. The following are not considered product quality complaints: 
xSubject satisfaction inquirie s reported via “Subjective Qu estionnaires” and “Patient 
Reported Outcomes (PRO).” 
xClinical test articles that are stored improperly or damaged after receipt at the investigational site.
xTest article replacements that occur due to missed drops. 
xDamage deemed by [CONTACT_35513], 
and not indicative of a quality deficiency, only in situations where there is no deficiency alleged by [CONTACT_423]. 
Within [ADDRESS_98572] be 
recorded in the EDC system, which will trigger an automatic email notification to the appropriate COM/CRA and Clinical QA representative. In cases where the EDC system in use is not configured to send automatic notificati ons or when an EDC system is not used, the 
COM/CRA is responsible for notifying Clinical QA upon discovery that a PQC has occurred.   
Upon receipt of the EDC notification, the COM/ CRA will contact [CONTACT_19568]: 
xDate the complaint was received/recorde d in the EDC System (Date of Sponsor 
Awareness). 
xWho received the complaint. 
xStudy number. 
xClinical site information (contact [CONTACT_2300], site ID, telephone number). 
xLot number(s). 
xUnique Subject Identifier(s). 
xIndication of who first observed co mplaint (site personnel or subject). 
xOD/OS indication, along with whet her the lens was inserted. 
xAny related AE number if applicable. 
xDetailed complaint description (scheduled/unscheduled visit, wear time, symptoms, resolution of symptoms, etc.). 
xEye Care Provider objective (slit lamp) findings if applicable. 
CR-6371, v4.0  
Page 32 of 86JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
xConfirmation of product availa bility for return (and tracking information, if available), 
or rationale if product is not available for return 
Once a complaint is received, it will be assessed by [CONTACT_19569], CRA, or trained site personnel 
to determine if it is an Adverse Event/Seri ous Adverse Event (AE/SAE). If the complaint 
results in an AE/SAE, the COM/CRA, or traine d site personnel will follo w Section 13 of this 
protocol. If the AE/SAE was potentially the result of a product quality related deficiency, these procedures also applies and will be executed in parallel.   
In some cases, a PQC form may be generated in EDC by [CONTACT_35514]. In this event, the 
PQC forms will be marked “Intentionally Left Blank” or “ILB”.  Justification for ILB must be documented. 
13. ADVERSE EVENTS
13.1. Definitions and Classifications
Adverse Event (AE) – An AE is “any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or 
injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users 
or other persons, whether or  not related to the investigational medical device.  
This definition includes events related to the investigational medical device or the 
comparator, and to the procedures involved. Fo r users or other persons, this definition is 
restricted to events related to  investigational medical devices1
An AE includes any condition (including a pre-existing condition) that: 
1. Was not present prior to the study, but app eared or reappeared following initiation of 
the study. 
2. Was present prior to the study, but worsen ed during the study. This would include any 
condition resulting from concomita nt illnesses, reactions to concomitant medications, 
or progression of disease states. 
3. Pregnancy must be doc umented as an adverse event and must be reported to the clinical 
monitor and to the Sponsor immedi ately upon learning of the event. 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) – An SAE is any adverse event that led to any of the following: 
xDeath
xSerious deterioration in the health of the subject that resulted in any of the following: 
xLife-threatening illness or injury 
xPermanent or persistent impairment of a body structure or a body function

xLocalized Allergic Reactions
xAny corneal event not explicitly defined as serious or significant adverse event, which 
necessitates temporary lens discontinuation < [ADDRESS_98574] (ADE) – An ADE is an “adverse event related to the use of an 
investigational medical device.
NOTE 1: to entry: This definition includes adverse events resulting from insufficient or 
inadequate instructions for use, deployment, implantation, installation, or operation, or 
any malfunction of the inve stigational medical device. 
NOTE 2 to entry: This definition includes any ev ent resulting from use error or from 
intentional misuse of the investigational medical device.”[ADDRESS_98575] (UADE) – Any serious adverse effect on health or 
safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, the test article, 
if that effect, problem, or death was not previous ly identified in nature, severity, or degree of 
incidence in the investigational plan, Inves tigator’s Brochure or protocol, or any other 
unanticipated serious problem associated with the test article that relates to the rights, safety and welfare of subjects.
13.2. Assessing Adverse Events
In conjunction with the medical monitor, the Investigator will evaluate adverse events to ensure the events are categorized correctly. Elements of categorization will include: 
xSeriousness/Classifications (s ee definition in Section 13.1). 
xCausality or Rela tedness – i.e. the relationship between the test article , study treatment 
or study procedures and the adverse event (not related; unlikel y related; possibly
related; related - see de finition in Section 13.2.1). 
xAdverse Event Severity – Adverse event severity is used to assess the degree of intensity of the adverse event (mild; moderate; severe for all events - see definition in Section 13.2.2). 
xOutcome – not recovered or not resolved; recovering or resolving; recovered or 
resolved with sequelae; recovered or resolved; death related to adverse event;
unknown. 
xActions Taken – none; temporar ily discontinued; permanently discontinued; other. 
13.2.1. Causality Assessment
Causality Assessment – A determination of the relationshi p between an adverse event and the 
test article. The test article relationship for each adverse event should be determined by [CONTACT_19575]: 
xNot Related- An adverse event that is not re lated to the use of the test article, study 
treatment or study procedures. 
xUnlikely Related – An adverse event for which an alternative explanation is more 
likely, e.g. concomitant treatme nt, concomitant disease(s), or the relationship of time 
suggests that a causal relationship is not likely. 
CR-6371, v4.0  
Page 35 of 86JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
xPossibly Related – An adverse event that might be due to the use of the test article, or 
to the study treatment or study procedures. An alternative explana tion, e.g. concomitant 
treatment, concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in time is 
reasonable. Therefore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded. 
xRelated – An adverse event that is listed as a possible adverse effect (device) or adverse reaction (drug) and cannot be reasonably e xplained by [CONTACT_4867], e.g. 
concomitant treatment of concomitant disease(s). The relationship in time is very suggestive, e.g. it is confirmed by [INVESTIGATOR_5328]-challenge and re-challenge. 
13.2.2. Severity Assessment
Severity Assessment – A qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an adverse event 
as determined by [CONTACT_19577]/her by [CONTACT_423]. The assessment of 
severity is made irrespective of  test article, study tr eatment or study procedure relationship or 
seriousness of the event and should be eval uated according to the following scale: 
xMild – Event is noticeable to the subject, but is easily tolerated and does not interfere with the subject’s daily activities.
xModerate – Event is bothersome, possibl e requiring additiona l therapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.
xSevere – Event is intolerable, necessitates additional ther apy or alterati on of therapy 
and interferes with the subject’s daily activities. 
13.3. Documentation and Follow-Up of Adverse Events
The recording and documenting of adverse even ts (ocular and non-ocular) begin when the 
subjects are exposed to the test article, study tr eatment or study procedur e.  Adverse events 
reported before the use of test  article, start of st udy treatment, or study procedures will be 
recorded as medical history. However, if the c ondition deteriorates at any time during the study 
it will be recorded and reported as an AE. Untoward medical events reported after the subject’s exit from the study will be recorded as adverse ev ents at the discretion of the Investigator. 
Upon finding an adverse event, the Principal In vestigator will document the condition in the 
subject record and in the eCRFs. He/she will complete the Adverse Event /eCRF.  
Complete descriptions of all adverse events must be available in the subject record. All 
Adverse Events including local and systemic re actions not meeting the criteria for “serious 
adverse events” shall be captured on the appropriate case report form or electronic data system. All adverse events occurring while the subject  is enrolled in the study must be documented 
appropriately regardle ss of relationship.   
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to maintain documentation of each reported adverse event. All adverse events will be followed in accordance with applicable licensing requirements. Such documentation will include the following: 
xAdverse event (diagnosis not symptom). 
xDrawings or photographs (where appropri ate) that detail the finding (e.g., size, 
location, and depth, etc.). 
CR-6371, v4.0  
Page 36 of 86JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
xDate the clinical site was notified.
xDate and time of onset.
xDate and time of resolution.
xAdverse event classification, se verity, and relationship to te st articles, as applicable. 
xTreatment regimen instituted, including concomitant medications prescribed, in 
accordance with applicable licensing requirements.
xAny referral to another health care provider if needed.
xOutcome, ocular damage (if any). 
xLikely etiology. 
xBest corrected visual acuity at the discovery of the ev ent and upon conclusion of the 
event. 
In addition, if an infiltrate(s) is present, he/she  will complete the Corneal Infiltrate Assessment 
eCRF. Where necessary, a culture of the corneal lesion will be collected to determine if the infection is microbial in nature. If cultures are collected, the date of culture collection and laboratory utilized will be recorded.  
Changes in the severity of an AE shall be documented to allow an assessment of the duration 
of the event at each level of intensity to be performed. Adverse events characterized as 
intermittent require documentation of the onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Changes in the assessment of relationship to the Test Ar ticle shall also be clearly documented.
Subjects who present with an adverse event sh all be followed by [CONTACT_737], within 
licensure, until all signs and symptoms have retu rned to pre-treatment status, stabilized, or 
been satisfactorily resolved. If further treatme nt beyond licensure is required, the patient will 
be referred to the appropriate health care provider. The Investigator will use his/her clinical judgment as to whether a subject reporting with an adverse event will continue in the study. If a subject is discontinued from the study, it will be  the responsibility of the Investigator to 
record the reason for discontinuation. The Inves tigator will also document the adverse event 
appropriately and complete the Adverse Event eCRF. Any subjects with ongoing adverse events related to the test artic le, study treatment or study procedur es, as of the final study visit 
date, should be followed to resolu tion of the adverse event or un til referral to an appropriate 
health care provider, as recommended by [CONTACT_737]. Non-ocular adverse events that are not related to the test artic le, study treatment, or study proc edures may be recorded as 
“ongoing” without further follow-up. 
13.4. Reporting Adverse Events 
The Investigator will notify the Sponsor of an adverse event by e-mail, facsimile, or telephone 
as soon as possible and no later than 24 hours from discovery for an y serious /significant 
adverse events, and 2 days from discovery for any non-significant adverse event. In addition, 
a written report will be submitted by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_35451]/IRB according to their requirements (Section 13.4.2) . The report will comment whether the adverse event was 
considered to be related to the test article, study tr eatment or study procedures.

13.4.1. Reporting Adverse Events to Sponsor 
Serious/Significant Adverse Events
The Investigator will inform the sponsor of a ll serious/significant adve rse events occurring 
during the study period as soon as possible by e- mail, fax, or telephone, but no later than 24 
hours following discovery of the event. The Investigator is obligated to pursue and obtain information requested by [CONTACT_35519]. All 
subjects experiencing a serious/si gnificant adverse event must be  followed up and all outcomes 
must be reported. 
When medically necessary, the Investigator ma y break the randomizati on code to determine 
the identity of the treatment that the subj ect received. The Sponsor and study monitor should 
be notified prior to unmas king the test articles. 
In the event of a serious/significant adverse event, the Investigator must: 
xNotify the Sponsor immediately.
xObtain and maintain in the subject’s records all pertinent medical information and 
medical judgment for colleague s who assisted in the treatment and follow-up of the 
subject.
xProvide the Sponsor with a complete case history which includes a statement as to 
whether the event was or was not related to the use of the test article. 
xNotify the IEC/IRB as required by [CONTACT_35520] C/IRB reporting procedure according to 
national regulations. 
Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE)In the event of an Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE), the Investigator will submit a report of the UADE to the Sponsor and IEC/IRB as soon as possible, but no later 
than [ADDRESS_98576] report the results of the 
evaluation to FDA, the IEC/IRB and participati ng Investigators within [ADDRESS_98577]. 
Non-Serious Adverse EventsAll non-serious adverse events, including non-seri ous adverse device effects, will be reported 
to the sponsor by [CONTACT_35521] 2 days from discovery. 
13.4.2. Reporting Adverse Events to the Resp onsible IEC/IRB and Health Authorities
Adverse events that meet the IEC/IRB requirements for reporting must be reported within the 
IEC/IRB’s written guidelines. Each clinical site will refer to and follow any guidelines set forth by [CONTACT_19581]/IRB. Each clinical site wi ll refer to and follow any guidelines set forth 
by [CONTACT_19582]. 
The Sponsor will report applicable Adverse Events to the local health authorities according the 
written guidelines, including reporting timelines.

[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
13.4.3. Event of Special Interest
None 
13.5. Reporting of Pregnancy 
Subjects reporting pregnancy (by [CONTACT_6270]-report) during the study will be discontinued after the 
event is recorded as an Adverse Event. Once  discontinued, pregnant participants and their 
fetuses will not be monitore d for study related purposes. 
Pregnant participants are not discontinued from contact [CONTACT_89631], but due to ge neral concerns relati ng to pregnancy and contact [CONTACT_19584]. 
Specifically, pregnant women are discontinued due to fluctuations  in refractive error and/or 
visual acuity that occur secondary to systemic  hormonal changes, and not due to unforeseen 
health risks to the mother or fetus. 
14. STATISTICAL METHODS
14.1. General Considerations
Statistical Analysis will be undertaken by [CONTACT_35522]. A 
general description of the statistical methods to be implemented in this clinical trial is outlined 
below.
All data summaries and statistical analyses will be performed using the SAS software Version 
9.4 or higher (SAS In stitute, Cary, NC)7. Throughout the analysis of data, the results for each 
subject/eye will be used when available for summarization. Unschedu led visits will be 
summarized separately.
Summary tables (descriptive statistics and/or frequency tables) will be provided for all baseline 
variables, efficacy variables and safety variable s as appropriate. Continuous variables will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation [SD]), median, minimum and maximum). Frequency count and percentage of subjects or eyes within each category will be provided for categorical data.
14.2. Sample Size Justification
Approximately 30 subjects will be  enrolled in this study to attain a minimum of 25 completed 
subjects. This is a feasibility descriptive study to evaluate the visual acuity after the instillation 
of a lipid-based eye drop. Sample size is no t based on the empi[INVESTIGATOR_89621], and the 
data collected for this study may be used  in future study design if applicable. 
14.3. Analysis Populations 
Safety Population: All subjects who were administered any test ar ticle excluding subjects who drop out prior to 
administering any test article. At least one observation should be recorded. 
CR-6371, v4.0  
Page 39 of 86JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
Per-Protocol Population:  
All subjects who have successfully completed all visits and did not substantially deviate from 
the protocol as determined by [CONTACT_89632]. 
Justification of excluding subjects with protocol deviations in the Per-Protocol Population set 
will be documented in a memo to file.
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population:
All randomized subjects regardless of actual trea tment and subsequent withdrawal from study 
or deviation from protocol. At leas t one observation should be recorded. 
14.4. Level of Statis tical Significance
No inferential statistics are planned to be performed in this st udy; hence, the level of statistical 
significance is not a concern. In the event that exploratory an alysis is conducted, an overall 
type I error rate of 5% will be used.
14.5. Primary Analysis  
Change in logMAR visual acuity will be descriptively summarized. 
14.6. Secondary Analysis  
Not applicable.
14.7. Other Exploratory Analyses 
The following study endpoints will be disruptively summarized: 
xSlit Lamp Findings using FDA scale
xSnellen best corrected distance visual acuity
xSubject reported ocular symptoms 
xAdverse Events
xNumber and reasons for discontinuation will be monitored. 
14.8. Interim Analysis
Not applicable.
14.9. Procedure for Handling Mi ssing Data and Drop-Outs
Missing or spurious values will not be imputed. The count of obs erved values will be included 
in the summary tables and listings. 
14.10. Procedure for Reporting Devi ations from Statistical Plan
The analysis will be conducted according to that specified in above sections. There are no known reasons for which it is planned to deviate fr om these analysis methods. If for any reason 
a change is made, the change will be documented in the study re port along with a justification 
for the change.

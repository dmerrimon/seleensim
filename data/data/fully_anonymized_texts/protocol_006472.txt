Investigation 
Purpose  The purpose of the Apogee  co-enrollment study is to further enhance scientific understanding of 
the implant procedure, opti mized blood pressure management, and anticoagulation / antiplatelet 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  The goals of Apogee are: 
• To evaluate collective impact of Apogee  standardized  guidelines and characterize impact on 12 -
month aggregate adverse event rate  
• To better understa nd the effects of implant technique and patient management on clinical 
outcomes  
Study Design  DT PAS Sites have the option to co -enroll patients in Apogee .  Patients must be consented for the 
DT PAS  to be eligible for participation in Apogee , which will re quire a separate consent . 
 
Sample Size  The total sample size will be dependent on the number of sites  and patients  interested in 
participation in Apogee .  If 1/3 of the total DT PAS patients  participate in Apogee , the study would 
be expected to enroll  (but not limit ed to) ~100 patients (1/3 of the total DT PAS patients since the 
DT PAS enrolls 300 pa tients).

D. Introduction  
 
 Background  
 
Medtronic is sponsoring the Apogee  study.  Co -enrollment in Apogee  is allowed for patients participating in the 
Destination Therapy (DT) Post  Approval Study (PAS).  Patients must be consented for the DT PAS to be eligible for 
participation in A pogee , which will require a separate consent.  
  
Apogee is conducted within Medtronic’s Product Surveillance Registry (PSR) platform and is specific under  the DT PAS 
addendum. The Apogee  addendum outlines data collection, applicable procedures, objectives, statistical methodology, 
analysis cohort, and re porting plans specific to the Apogee  study  which are not defined in the PSR core and MCS 
appendix (MCS PS R platform base protocol)  or the DT PAS addendum . The combination of these elements together 
define the requirements for Apogee study.   
 
E. Methodology    
 
 Study Design  and Purpose  
 
The Apogee  study is a prospective, observational, multi -site study  in Destin ation Therapy (DT) patients .  The Apogee  
study includes three areas of data collection :  
 
• Implant Procedure  
• Blood Pressure Management  
• Anti-coagulation / Anti-platelet Therapy  
 
Sites choosing to participate in Apogee  are expected to collect data in each  of the se three  areas . 
 
Most  patients receiving mechanical circulatory support (MCS) experience severe adverse event burden. The 2013 
Intermacs report show ed that approximately 70% of patients experience a major adverse event within the first [ADDRESS_702224] practice guidelines. The purpose of 
Apogee  is to further enhance scie ntific understanding of the implant procedure, optimized blood pressure management, 
and anticoagulation / antiplatelet therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  The goals of Apogee  are: 
 
• To evaluate the collective impact of Apogee  standardized guidelines and c haracterize impact on 12 -month 
aggregate adverse event rate  
• To better understand the effects of implant technique and patient management on clinical outcomes  
 
 Site Participation  
 
It is expected that a subset of the DT PAS sites will participate in Apogee .  DT PAS sites can choose to participate in 
Apogee , or they can decline Apogee  and limit their participation to the DT PAS.  As an estimate, i f one -third of the  
approximately 50  DT PAS  sites participate in Apogee , it is expected the Apogee  cohort will be co mprised of

01DEC2020   Medtronic Confidential  approximately (but not limited to) 100 patients from  approximately  (but not limited to)  17 Apogee  sites .  In general, it is 
expected that any site participating in Apogee  would enroll all of their eligible patients in Apogee ; however,  there may 
be exceptions due to  timing of Apogee  activation,  lack of patient interest , or concerns regarding non -compliance.  
 
Prior to enrolling patients in Apogee , sites must be activated in the DT PAS and Apogee  and have an established 
contract,  Institutional Revi ew Board (IRB) approval and fulfill any and all other Apogee  or IRB initiation requirements.  
The consent for Apogee is separate from the DT PAS consent .  The patient must be consented with the DT PAS consent 
prior to consenting with the Apogee consent.   The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good 
Clinical Practice , and the ap plicable regulatory requirements.  The clinical investigation shall be conducted in accordance 
with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declarati on of Helsinki.  
 
 Enrollment and Duration  
 
The enrollment duration of Apogee  is expected to occur  parallel to enrollment in the DT PAS.  There are no additional 
inclusion or exclusion criteria to Apogee subjects outside of the requirements outlined in the M CS PSR platform base 
protocol and the DT PAS  Addendum .  Full enrollment is anti cipated to require approximately  [ADDRESS_702225] -
implant or as prompted by [CONTACT_538837] , defined in the MCS PSR platform base protocol and the DT PAS addendu m.  
 
Apogee  data collection is summarized in  Table 2 .

G. Implant Procedure  Investigation  
 
 Implant Procedure Data Collection  
 
Detailed information on the implant procedure will be collected , if available, including:  
Version 2  Apogee Addendum Plan                Page 10 of 26 
01DEC2020   Medtronic Confidential  • Surgical incision and heparinization  
• Arterial and venous cannulation, cardio -pulmonary by[CONTACT_6476] (CPB) time  
• Inflow cannula and outflow graft placement  
• Driveline placement and concomitant procedures  
• Pump parameters exiting t he OR  
• Pericardium After Implant  
 
 2-D Echo Color Doppler V elocimetry  
 
Echos will be collected via digital media and uploaded to Medtronic  via secure file transfer (e.g. Box) .  Medtronic will 
share echos with the vendor University of [LOCATION_004] San Diego (UCSD) so they can conduct 2D velocimetry evaluation 
using their proprieta ry software to evaluate flow in new ventricular imaging techniques.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 The 2D echo color 
Doppler velocimetry (echo -CDV) modality allows for non -invasive personalized risk assessment of hemolysis and blood 
clot formation inside the lef t ventricle. It is hypothesized that this new modality can be used to non -invasively 
charact erize the effect of left ventricular assist device support in LV hemodynamics in vivo leading to improved patient 
care.  
 
The overarching goal is to evaluate the uti lity of echo -2D color Doppler velocimetry to guide LVAD positioning, pump  
settings, and mini mize the risk for cerebr ovascular accident (CVA), pump thrombosis (PT) and hemolysis in the clinical 
setting.   The goals for this work are to:  
 
• Evaluate shear stre sses near cannula and their dependence on LVAD pump speed and cannula placement 
(assess how to minimize hemolysis risk)  
• Evaluate changes in blood transport efficiency and blood stasis as a consequence of LVAD placement (assess 
how to minimize stasis and r isk of thrombus formation)  
• Evaluate energetic and momentum efficiency created by [CONTACT_538839] (e.g. flywheel effect) as a potential 
outcome predictor  
Echo cardiogram s will be obtained when performed per standard institutional procedures, which is expected to occur at  
the following timepoints : 
 
• Baseline (prior to implant) – transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE)  
• In OR, after chest is open prior to cardio -pulmonary by[CONTACT_538840] - transesophageal 
Echocardiogram (TEE)  
• In OR, after implantation, off cardio -pulmonary by[CONTACT_6476], while chest is still open - transesophage al 
Echocardiogram (TEE)  
• Prior to Discharge ( capture with Lavare off  for 5 minutes *)- transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE)  
• Prior to Discharge ( capture with Lavare turned on  for 5 minutes *)- transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE)  
• [ADDRESS_702228] -implant - transthora cic echocardiogram (TTE)  
 
Echo d ata will also be collected on a Case Report Form (CRF).

for 5 minutes , then doing the views needed for Doppler velocimetry with Lavare ON for 5 minutes  to see the improved 
washing with Lavare turn ed on).  Lavare views should:  
 
o Evaluate shear stress near cannula  
o Evaluate changes in blood tr ansport efficiency and blood stasis  
o Evaluate energetic and momentum efficiency created by [CONTACT_538841] (e.g. flywheel effect)  
For instructions on the echo image  capture, p lease reference the  most recent version  of the  Apogee Echocardiography 
Manual.  
 
 Ches t X-Ray (if performed)  
 
A digital image of the standard post -op chest x -ray (expected to occur on Post -op Day 1) will be collected and 
uploaded to Medtronic . 
 
 CT Scan  (if performed)  
 
If a CT scan is performed post implant, a digital image will be uploaded to Medtronic . 
 
 Right Heart Cath eterization (RHC) Hemodynamics Collection (if performed)  
 
If a subject undergoes a ny RHC  during the first year post -implant, information about right ventricular function 
will be collected  on the CRF , as well as any available baseline data from a previous RHC  prior to implant.    
 
 Videotape Procedure (if performed)  
 
A videotape of the procedure will be collected for any sites with capability and interest to videotape the 
procedure for training purposes , if performed .  If the pro cedure will be videotaped, the  recording will follow 
institutional procedure and must be sp ecified in the  subject ’s signed  consent.   The recording is recommended 
to capture the api[INVESTIGATOR_538794], including the c annulation sequence  and a ortic outflow anastomosis . 
 
H. Blood Pressure (BP) Management  Investigation   
 
Apogee  sites will manage blood pressure according to blood pressure management guidelines described in the DT PAS 
PSR platform addendum  and the  product labeling, which may include but is not limi ted to  the IFU and the product 
reference manuals.  In addition, Apogee  sites will  report items from the patient diary and consider medication guidelines 
for hypertensive patients.   The patient will check whether they have a palpable pulse at each check.  Diary recordings will 
be entered into the CRF , including Doppler p ressure, presence of palpable pulse, LVAD measurements and presence of 
dizziness . 
 
Inpatient  Medication Guidelines  
1.  Manage to target goal: 75-90 mmHg  (via Doppler/cuff method  once arteria l line pulled ) 
2.  Ensure patient and caregiver(s) properly trained on Doppler/cuff method prior to discharge  
3.  Medication guideline recommendations for management of hypertensive patients prior to discharge:  
In patients without AKI or significant renal dysfunction:  
• First line therapy: Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor  (ACE -I) or Angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB)  
Version 2  Apogee Addendum Plan                Page 12 of 26 
01DEC2020   Medtronic Confidential  • Second line therapy: Nitrates and/or Hydralazine, spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407], or Norvasc* (Amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050])  
• Third line therapy: Clonidine  
In patients w ith AKI or significant renal dysfunction:  
• First line therapy: Nitrates and/or Hydralazine or Norvasc* (Amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050])  
• Second line therapy: Clonidine  
*Note: Norvasc (Amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) will not acutely lower blood pressure  
 
Outpatient  Diary Collection & Medication Guidelines  
Blood pressure monitoring (using Doppler with cuff)  
• Time of day: Measure every morning at least 40 minutes AFTER taking BP medication and during resting conditions, 
while sitting  
• Frequency: Measure daily.  If stab le after 1 month of daily monit oring, Investigator can consider reducing frequency 
to measuring 3 times per week ( e.g., every Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule ).  Stable is defined as: no instances 
of BP>90 mmHg for three consecutive days and not a single o ccurrence of BP>110 mmHg (i.e. no instances of 
needing to call HCP)  
• Diary: Patient to record Doppler pressure , presence of palpable pulse or dizziness, and HVAD measurements from 
controller (i.e. power, flow, RPM, peak, trough) in diary and bring to site d uring scheduled visits.  Site w ill record 
these onto CRF.  
Patient should c all site if: 
• BP >90 for 3 consecutive days or if postural symptoms >48 hours (e.g. orthostatic reaction)  
• BP >110 for single timepoint  (take BP measurement twice before calling  to confirm  both show >110 at timepoin t) 
• BP <6 0 for single timepoint (take BP measurement twice befo re calling to confirm both show <60 at timepoint)  
• Patients with symptoms of hypotension (dizziness/syncope/presyncope/weakness) should be instructed to call even 
if values read normal.

I. Anti-Coagulation  / Platelet Therapy  Investigation  
 
 Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_538795]’s aspi[INVESTIGATOR_538796] -up or when the patient presents with a bleeding or thrombotic event, including hemorrhagic or ischemic 
strokes.  Per the HeartWare HVAD System Instructions for Use, “In general, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_538797] 
>81 mg/day” (i.e., moderate -dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_538798] 162mg or high -dose of 325mg, etc.).  The Medication Log captures 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_538799].  
 
  VerifyNow Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_538800]  
 
A VerifyNow Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_538801] (if available) will be collected alo ng with the current aspi[INVESTIGATOR_538802] -up visit through 12 months.  The assay and CBC (if available) will also be collected 
at all Unscheduled Visits, if the patient presents with a bleeding or thrombotic complication,  including 
hemorrhagic or ischemic st rokes.   See Appendix A for instructions on the use of the VerifyNow Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_538803], 
which is also available online at http://www.accumetrics.com/products/verifynow -system -platelet -reactivity -
test.  
 
The purpose of collec ting this information is to correlate  the VerifyNow Assay results with bleeding or 
thrombotic events.  Information from the assay collection may characterize the platelet reactivity and 
responsiveness to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_538804], up to one -year post -implant.  It 
may also characterize whether platelet activity is greater in ventricular assist device (VAD) patients with 
frequent/severe thrombotic events as compared to those with less frequent/less severe thrombotic events, an d 

Version [ADDRESS_702230] ivity/reactivity are reduced in VAD patients with hemorrhagic events 
compared to those without such events.  
 
During this study, sites should continue to follow their current institutional practice and IFU recommendation s 
for aspi[INVESTIGATOR_538805].  Test  results from the VerifyNow Assay should not be used to guide aspi[INVESTIGATOR_538806]’s current standard of practice.   
 
 Home INR Monitoring  
 
The HVAD IFU recommends anticoagulation with the recommended INR range of 2.0 – 3.0. Home INR 
mon itoring will be i nstitute d with  point of care testing for subjects on anticoagulation therapy with intent to 
improve time in therapeutic range . Where possible, INR monitoring equipment will be provided to subjects for  
weekly  INR monitoring . Sites will reco rd reported  INR values.   
 
The a nticoagulation management strategy/protocol will be site defined.  Sites should use a  warfarin 
management software as part of the dosing algorithm (sites can follow their VAD center protocol and manage 
warfarin dosing using their preferred software  algorithms).   Any suspected stroke should be confirmed with CT 
scan.  
 
 Enoxaparin Bridging Recommendation  (for stable ambulatory patients with sub -
therapeutic INR)  
 
It is recommended that ambulatory patients with an INR ≤ 1.7 be bri dged with enoxaparin (or fondaparinux) 
unless contraindicated, such as increased risk of bleeding. Details of data co llection and enoxaparin bridging 
recommendations include :   
 
o Collect previous history of gastrointestinal ( GI) bleeding, presence of nasal arteriovenous malformation 
(AVM), proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use,  bleeding location (upper/ lower / small bowel bleed) , and any 
endoscopic procedure(s) findings such as  video capsule endoscopy (VCE) and enteroscopy  
o Enoxaparin Dosing: For eGFR > [ADDRESS_702231] 10mg  
o Dosing may be altered for p atients with increased risk of bleeding where half -dose dosing may be 
considered (0.5mg/kg)  
o A patient should  meet the following criteria to receive enoxaparin bridging:  
▪ Minimum weight: women  must weigh more than 45 kg; men more than 57 kg  
▪ Most recent plate let count > 100,000/UL  
▪ Ability to safely and accurately self -administer enoxaparin  
o In a p atient with a contraindication to enoxaparin, fondaparinux can be utilized:  
▪ Fondaparinux 7.5mg SC dai ly (wt 50 -100kg)  
▪ Fondaparinux 10mg SC daily (wt > 100mg)  
 
 GI bleeding  Recommendation  
 
Subject management strategies for GI bleeding (GIB) have recently been described , including an endoscopic 
algorithm  to eliminate sequential and overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_4585], an d to eliminate low -yield procedures;.11This 
algorithm was focused on maximizing procedures with the highest diagnostic and therapeutic yields while

• Age-appropriate colon cancer screening  
 
Diagnostic testing for GI bleeds will  be collected.  If acquired by [CONTACT_538844] , 
angiopoietin -2 levels will be c ollected.  
 
J. Objectives  and Statistical Methodology  
 
General Considerations  
 
Many ancillary objectives are not statistical in nature.  Ancillary objective analysis methods will be detailed in the 
Apogee Statistical Analysis Plan.  This is an observational study;  therefore,  no hypothesis tests are planned.  
 
The Apogee study might ob serve variations in data collection due to 1) variations in routine care practices across 
participating sites and 2) the COVID -[ADDRESS_702233] statistical hypothes es; thus, available data will 
be analyzed.  
 
 
Version [ADDRESS_702234] practices.  Major adverse events are defined to be o ccurrence of infection, bleeding, device 
malfunction, stroke or death.  
 
Endpoint Definition  
 
Events counted as “major adverse events” are:  
• Major infection as defined by [CONTACT_538845] a dverse events  V5 
• Major bleeding as defined by [CONTACT_538846]  
• Device Malfunct ion as defined by [CONTACT_538846]  
• Any stroke (includes ischemic stroke , acute symptomatic  ICH, and clinically covert ischemic stroke or ICH ) as 
defined by [CONTACT_538847] a sub -category of neurological dysfunction  
• All-cause death  
Analysis Methods  
 
Time to  first major adverse event will be analyzed using Kaplan -Meier methods, with Time [ADDRESS_702235] known follow -up, and the date of their 12 -month follow -up.  There is no planned form al

APPENDIX A: VerifyNow Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_538809]: Sample Preparation  
 
The VerifyNow Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_538810]’s instructions provided below:  
Verify Now®  Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_538811] -1 (COX -1) enzyme involved in the 
conversion of arachidonic acid to thromboxane A2, which ultimately activates the GPI[INVESTIGATOR_97086]/IIIa receptors involved  in 
platelet aggregation. If aspi[INVESTIGATOR_538812] -platelet effect, such aggregation will not occur. The 
Verify Now Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_538813].  The Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_538814] d to 
measure plate let function based upon the ability of activated platelets to bind fibrinogen.  Fibrinogen -coated 
microparticles aggregate in whole blood in proportion to the number of unblocked platelet GP IIb/IIIa receptors.  Light 
transmittance increa ses as activated p latelets bind and aggregate fibrinogen -coated beads.  The instrument measures 
this change in optical signal caused by [CONTACT_538848].  
Materials Required  
 
• VerifyNow Instrument with Electronic Quality Control (EQC).

Speci men Collection and Specifications  
 
Specimen Type : Whole blood collected from venous or arterial sites must be collected in or immediately transferred to 
Greiner 2.0 mL partial fill blue top tubes containing 3.2% Sodium Citrate.  The t ube must be filled to its intended whole 
blood capacity (indicated by [CONTACT_538849]).  
      - Samples should be collected between [ADDRESS_702237] but no longer than 4 hours . 
 
Instructions for Sample Collection Directly Into Vacuum Collection Tubes:  
1. Whole blood may be collected from venous or arterial sites using a 21 gauge or larger needle in partial fill 3.2% 
citrate vacuum collection tube.  Blood samples should be obtained  from an extremity free of peripheral venous 
infusions.  
2. Perform the phlebotomy and obtain the appropriate volume of blood in the sample tube following a discard tube of 
at least [ADDRESS_702238] AFTE R A TUBE THAT 
CONTAINS EDTA (PURPLE TOP).  Always draw the sample tube(s) for the Verify Now Test first.  
3. Gently invert the citrated tube containing whole blood [ADDRESS_702239].  
Version 2  Apogee Addendum Plan                Page 20 of 26 
01DEC2020   Medtronic Confidential  5. Samples that are difficult to obtain may hemolyze or clot.  Samples that are hemolyzed or clotted  should be 
recollected.  
 
Special Instructions if blood is obtained from an indwelling catheter:  
1. Whole blood samples that are obtained from an indwelling catheter should be collected after sufficient discard 
(approximately 5 mL) has been drawn to clear the line.  
2. Ensure indwelling c atheter is free of clots.  
3. When using a syringe, transfer blood to the appropriate blood collection tube immediately after collection.  
4. Immediately gently invert the citrated tube containing whole blood at least [ADDRESS_702240].  
6. Samples that are difficult to obtain may hemolyze or clot.  Samples that are hemolyzed or clotted sho uld be 
recollected.  
 
Sample Stability and Storage : The sample must be incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes prior to testing and 
can be used up to 4 hours after collection if stored at room temperature (18 to 25 C).  Do not refrigerate or freeze 
specimen . 
 
Sample Precautions : Collection of the blo od specimen should be performed with care to avoid hemolysis or 
contamination by [CONTACT_538850].  Samples with evidence of clotting must not be used.  
 
Interfering Substances : 
Laboratory testing was performed  to determine the effects of several classes of dr ugs on VerifyNow Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_538817]. 
The following medications may cause a change in platelet function. The following information should be considered for 
patients who are to be tested with the VerifyNow Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_538818].  
 
P2Y12 Inhibitors:   Plavix®, Ticlid ®, and Effient® are commonly prescribed in conjunction with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248].  While infrequent, 
these agents may cause a reduction of ARU in some patients.  However, the effect of the P2Y12 inhibitors did not affec t 
the categorization of patients taking aspi[INVESTIGATOR_538819] (i.e. ARU < 550) due to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_538820].  The 
duration of inhibitory effects varies among these P2Y12 inhibitors.  Average durations are listed below:  
• Plavix (up to 5 Days)  
• Ticlid (up to 5 Days)  
• Effient (up to 10 days)  
 
Other  Anti -Platelet Agents:  These agents can all inhibit platelet function and may result in a decreased ARU value 
independent of the effects of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]. The duration of inhibitory effects varies among drugs. Av erage duration times are 
listed for each drug . 
• Aggrenox (10 days)  
• Persantine (12 hours)  
• Pletal/Cilostazol (12 hours)  
 
NSAIDs : Like aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (ASA), NSAIDs have been documented to inhibit platelet function.  Unlike ASA, NSAIDs do not 
irreversibly inhibit plat elet function. This may lead to less platelet  inhibition by [CONTACT_538851]. Average duration times for these inhibitory effects are given for each drug.  
 
• Ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) (8 hours)  
Version 2  Apogee Addendum Plan                Page 21 of 26 
01DEC2020   Medtronic Confidential  • Naproxen (Aleve, Anaprox, Nap relan, Naprosyn) (24 hours)  
• Diclofenac (Volta ren, Cataflam) (24 hours)  
• Indocin (24 hours)  
• Feldene (50 hours)  
 
GP IIb/IIIa Inhibitors: Patients who have been administered tirofiban (Aggrastat®) or eptifibatide (Integrilin®) within two 
days, or abciximab (Re oPro®) within two weeks should not be tested.  
Other classes of commonly used drugs were tested with no significant effect on VerifyNow Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_538821] 
(antioxidants, ACE inhibitors, antiarrhythmics, anticoagulants, antidepressants, insulin, allopu rinol, alcohol, beta 
blockers, bronchodilator s, calcium channel blockers, gastrointestinal medications, betamethasone, lovastatin, and the 
thyroid hormone L -thyroxine).  The thrombolytic agent streptokinase showed a measurable inhibition of platelet 
functi on, as measured by [CONTACT_538852][INVESTIGATOR_538818] . 
Laboratory and clinical testing was performed to assess the effect of the levels of several blood constituents:  
Test performance was not affected by [CONTACT_538853] 29 -56%, platelet count values of ≥  92,[ADDRESS_702241] samples.  
No significant interference was obser ved on samples studied with triglyceride concentrations up to 577 mg/dL.  
Fibrinogen levels between 164 -529 mg/dL w ere tested with the VerifyNow Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_538818]. No known relationship exists 
between performance of VerifyNow Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_538822].  
 
Handling Conditions  
 
The sample must be incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature prior to testing.  If testin g is delayed, the sample can 
be stored at room temperature (18 to 25 C) for up to [ADDRESS_702242]

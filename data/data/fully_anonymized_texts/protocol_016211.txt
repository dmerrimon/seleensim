1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Non-Small Cell L ung Cancer (NSCL C) is the leading cause of cancer- related deaths in man y 
countries, including the US. The prognosis for advanced stage disease has improved modestly  
in the past 20 y ears. With an overall 5- year survival rate of onl y 15% the treatment of this 
disease clearl y remains a major clinical challenge ( R05-0867).
While sy stem ic chemotherapy  has demonstrated modest activity in advanced NSCL C, novel 
targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_810523] a new treatment paradigm. Among the molecules most extensively studied 
are the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_12591] (EGFR) or the Subclass I of the superfamily  of 
transmembrane t yrosine kinase receptors ( R06-1301 , R06 - 1302 ).
Aberrant activation of EGFR frequentl y observed i n a variet y of malignant tumors can be 
induced b y different molecular mechanisms including receptor overexpression, mutation, 
ligand -dependent receptor dimerization, and ligand -independent activation. Overexpression 
of EGFR has been detected in 40% to 80% of NSCL C patients ( R06-1301, R06- 1393 , R06-
1394 ). However, recent clinical experiences with specific EGFR- Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors 
(TKI) have demonstrated tumor regres sion in only 10% to 15% of unselected NSCL C 
patients ( R05-0867, R06 - 1301 , R06-1306 ). The treatment with EGFR TKIs isassociated with
higher Response R ate (RR) in patients with tumors which harbor EGFR mutations.  In a 
recent meta -analy sis based on 13 randomized trials, the response rate was 70% vs. 33.2% in 
first-line trials. In three second -line trials, response rates were 47.4% vs. 28.5%, with a 
benefit similar t o first -line trials (R elative Risk, 1.79; p = .04) (R12-4000 ).  Somatic 
mutations between exons 18 through 21 of the EGFR gene was found to occur in 
approximately  10% of NSCL C patients from the US, Europe or Australia compared to up to 
30% in patients from Japan and Taiwan ( R06-1262 , R06-1306 , R06-1393 ).The most 
common EGFR mutations are a short, in- frame deletion in exon 1 9 (E19del [L REA del etion] 
found in approximately  46% of patients) and a point mutation (CTG to CGG) that results in a 
substitution of leucine by [CONTACT_262521] 858 of exon 21 ([L 858R] found in 37.5% of 
patients) ( R14-2119).
Two large multinational randomized Phase III studies of afatinib in the f irst line treatment of 
mutation positive stage IVNSCL C patients have been performed :the LUX-Lung 3 (1200.32) 
and LUX -Lung 6 (1200.34) studies . 
LUX -Lung 3compared first line afatinib to up to six cy cles of cisplatin /pemetrexed (N=345 
with 2:1 ra ndomization). Adult p atients with performance status (PS) 0- 1 were included in 
the trial without age limitation .Seventy -two percent ( 72%) of all trial patients were Asian 
with the rem ainder classified as non- Asian. In this trial patients treated with afatinib 
demonstrated significant and clinically  meaningful improvements in progression free survival 
(PFS, median PFS afatinib vs. cisplatin/pemetrexed 11.[ADDRESS_1120985] ratio 0.58; 
95% CI ,0.43 to 0.78; P=.001) and O bjective Response Rate(ORR, afatinib vs cisplatin 
/pemetrexed 56% vs. 23% ;P= .001).  This was accompanied b y significant delay s in time to

[ADDRESS_1120991] information on the drug profile of afatinib, please refer to the current afatinib 
Investigator Brochure (IB) (c01802941-09).  All references in this protocol concerning 
afatinib refer to the free base compound afatinib which is used as the oral formulation.
Afatinib is moderatel y fast absorbed after oral administration. Maximum plasma 
concentrations of afatinib were achieved mainly at [ADDRESS_1120992] administration. The major route of elimination of afatinib was via 
faeces. After food intake, a decreased systemi c exposure was observed compared to 
administration under fasted conditions. Therefore, afatinib should be taken without food (i.e. 
food should not be consumed for at least 
2hours before and at least 1 hour after taking 
afatinib). The PK characteristics in Caucasian cancer patients were comparable to those 
observed in Japanese cancer patients. 
Afatinib is bound covalently  to proteins to a variable extent and covalent protein adducts 
were the major circulating metabolites in the plasma. Afatinib did not sho w relevant 
inhibition or induction of cy tochrome P450 isoenzy mes, and it appears unlikely  that drug -
drug interactions based on this mechanism will occur. 
Afatinib is a substrate of the P -gp transporter. Concomitant administration of the potent P- gp
inhibi tor ritonavir did not relevantl y change the exposure to 40 mg afatinib when taken
simultaneously  with or 6 h after afatinib but increased the bioavailability  of afatinib (single
dose of 20 mg) b y 48% and 39% for AUC0- ∞ and Cmax when given 1 h before afatin ib,
respectivel y. Pretreatment with the potent P -gp inducer rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_810524] 40 mg afatinib by  34 % afatinib (AUC0- ∞) and 22 % (Cmax), respectivel y.
Caution should be exercised when combining afatinib with potent P -gp modulators .
In pre -clinical studies afatinib is not an irritant to intact skin but an ocular irritant.

ASSESSMENT
2.1 RATIONALE FOR PERFORMING THE T RIAL
The US registration of the EGFR TKIs afatinib and erlotinib has changed the clini cal 
management of patients with advanced NSCLC (R06-1394, R06 - 1307 , R07-1049 , R07-
1134 ). A significant clinical benefit may  be achieved by  a treatment that co ntrols NSCL C 
progression with acceptable levels of side effects through a defined and specific targeted 
molecular mechanism.
Elderly  patients (variously  defined in the literature as≥ 65years of age or >70 yearsof age)
tend to be under represented in clin ical trials (R14-1781, R14 - 1839 , R14-1840 ).For this trial 
we will define elderly patients as those patients who are 70 years of age or older. 
Half of all NSCL C patients are 70 y ears of age or older at the time of initial diagnosis ( R14-
1781 ).
There are several retrospective subset analyses from large clinical trials of the saf ety and 
efficacy  of EGFR TKI s in elderl y patients (age> 70). These trials were conducted regard less 
ofmutational status and allowed multiple prior lines of therap y (R09-2250 ,R14-1350 ). One 
such study  in Canadian patients demonstra ted significant improvement in progression free 
survival in both elderly  and y ounger populations compa red to placebo ( R09-2250). Elderl y 
patients however ,had significantly  more overall and severe toxicity  (grade 3/4 35% vs. 
18.5%; p< .001) .  The elderly  werealsomore likely  to have > grade 3 rash, fatigue, 
stomatitis, or dehy
dration.  
A subset anal ysis of a Japanese population based observational study  in  patients ≥[ADDRESS_1120993] to mutational status and had multiple prior lines of therap y.
In this stud y there was a statistical difference between the disease control rate in the elderly
and non- elderly (58.2 % vs .42.5 % P= 0.0228). There was no statistical difference in the 
time to treatment failure or in overall survival between the two groups. There was also no 
significant difference in the occurrence of grade > 3 toxicities between the groups. [R15-

The objective of this study  is to describe the occurrence of AEs leading to dose reduction 
following afatinib treatment in NSCL C patients with common EGFR mutation s (Deletion 19
and/or L858R ) who are 70 y ears of age or older. 
See Section 5 for a detailed description of the study  endpoints.
2.3 BENEFIT - RISK ASSESSMENT
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_103281], NSCL C still has a dismal prognosis with an overall 5 y ear survival 
rate of 15%. 
  Afatinib is approved in the United S tates for the first line treatment of patients 
with Exon 19 Deletions or Exon 21(L 858R) substitution mutations . I
ntheLUX -Lung 3 trial, 
afatinib showed a statistically  significant and clinically  meaningful improvement in PFS, 
response rate and lung cancer symptoms compared to chemotherap yin NSCL C patients with 
common EGFR mutation (P13-[ZIP_CODE]). Across all afatinib clinical trials, diarrhoea , including 
severe diarrhoea, has been reporte d during treatment .Diarrhoea may  result in dehy dration 
with or without renal impairment, which in rare cases has resulted in fatal outcomes. Diarrhea 
usually  occurred within the firs t 2 weeks of treatment. Grade 3 diarrhea is reported in about 
15% of patients and most frequentl yoccurred within the first 6 weeks of treatment. 
The dermatological AEs in afatinib trials are captured as group terms including rash, acne, 
paron ychia, pruri tus, dry  skin, eczema, and folliculitis. Across all trials rash/acne occurred at 
a high frequency  and half of the cases begin within 4 weeks of exposure to afatinib. Grade 3 
rash wasobserved in about 17- 18% of patients and those at higher risk for Grade 3 rash/acne 
appear to be the patients of low body weight/body surface area and patients with low baseline 
renal function. 
Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a rare and serious (potentially  fatal) AE reported with other
EGFR TKIs. The frequency  of ILD -like AEs in all afatinib treated patients was low 
(approximately  1%) and similar to that observed with other EGFR TKI s. In this study , 
patients with known pre -existing ILD will be excluded. Afatinib treatment will be interrupted 
if patients experienc eacute onset and/or unexplained worsening of pulmonary  symptoms 
(including d yspnea, cough, and fever). If interstitial lung disease is diagnosed, study  drug 
must be permanentl y discontinued and appropriate treatment should be instituted as 
necessary .
Although rare, a potential for drug -induced liver injury  (DILI ) due to afatinib is under 
constant surveillance b y sponsors and regulators. Therefore, this study  requires timely  
detection, evaluation, and follow -
up of laboratory alterations of selected liver la boratory  
parameters to ensure patient safet y.
Keratitis was identified using the MedDRA SMQ (Medical Dictionary  for Drug Regulatory  
Activities Standardised MedDRA Queries )(narrow) for corneal disorders and B oehringer 
Ingelheim ’s internal database was searched. In all afatinib-treated patients as of 15 January

preferred term being keratitis (19 patients [0.4%]).
In regard to treatment of older pati ents, in the LUX -Lung 3 study , the predominant adverse 
events noted in patients aged 70 and over (N= 48) receiving afatinib treatment were diarrhoea
95.8% (10.4% > grade 3), rash/acne 85.4% (12.5% > grade 3), stomatitis 66.7% (6.3% > 
grade 3) and nail ef fects 56.3% (16.7% > grade 3). These adverse events were treated 
symptomaticall y, and with treatment interruption and dose reductions. For patients aged 70 
and over, therap y was discontinued because of treatment related AEs in 14.6% of the patients 
receiv ing afatinib. Of the most common AEs associated with afatinib, only diarrhoea (4.2%) 
and paron ychia (2.1%) were cause for treatment discontinuation. There were no cases of 
interstitial lung disease -like events potentiall y related to afatinib in patients 70 years of age or 
older. Two deaths in this age group were considered to be related to afatinib treatment (one 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_810525] d one sepsis) . In the first line Lux Lung 6 trial encompassing
364patients with varying EGFR mutations, one hundred percent of patients were Asian .The 
mean age was 56 years, 25 ( 6.9 % ) afatinib patients were 70 y ears of age or older and had 
exon 19 deletions or L 858R mutations. The tolerability  of afatinib in this study  was 
consistent with what was reported in the LUX -Lung 3 trial. .
In this stud y, the guideline for management of expected side effects of afatinib will be 
followed (refer to 
Section 4.4 ). Regular and frequent monitoring of the safety  as well as the 
clinical benefi t throughout the trial will be implemented, including scheduled clinical visits 
when the emergence of afatinib related AEs are expected.  Hence, earl y management and 
education will take place to mitigate worsening of sy mptoms. In addition, periodic tumor 
assessment will be performed by [CONTACT_093]; patients lacking clinical benefit will be 
removed from afatinib treatment. 
In summary ,there is a medical need for i mproving treatment of elderl y patients with EGFR 
driver mutations.

TREATMENT
4.2.1 Rescue medication, emergency procedures, and additional treatments
[IP_ADDRESS] Rescue medication
Rescue medications to reverse the actions of afatinib are not available . There is no specific 
antidote for over dosage with afatinib . Potential adverse events should be treated 
symptomaticall y. Common adverse events of treatment with afatinib with specified 
management recommendations and/or requirements incl ude diarrhoea, and rash/acne. To 
improve tolerability  and the probability  of clinical benefit, patients should receive prompt and 
appropriate supportive care at the first signs of s ymptoms. Suggested treatments for AEs are 
described in Section 4.4.2 .
[IP_ADDRESS] Emergency  procedures
Careful assessment of all patients with an acute onset and/or unexplained worsening of 
pulmonary  symptoms (dy spnoea, cough, fever) should be performed to exclude ILD. Afatinib 
should be interrupted pending investigation of these sy mptoms. If interstitial lung disease is 
diagnosed, study  drug must be permanently discontinued and appropriate treatment instituted 
as necessary . 
Patients who present with sy mptoms of keratitis, such as acute or worsening ey e 
inflammation, lacrimation, light sensitivity , blurred vision, ey e pain and/or red ey e should be 
referred promptly  to an ophthalmic specialist. If a diagnosis of ulcerative keratitis is 
confirmed, treatment with afatinib should be interrupted or discontinued. If keratitis is 
diagnosed, the benefits and risks of continuing treatment with afatinib should be carefull y 
considered. Afatinib should be used with caution in patients with a history  of keratitis, 
ulcerative keratitis or severe dry  eye. Contact [CONTACT_810548] a risk factor for keratitis and 
ulceration.
Dermatologic adverse events and diarrhoea are the most common side -effects associated with 
treatment with afatinib. Treatment of these side- effects should be proactive and should be 
started as earl y as possibl e after onset of s ymptoms.
[IP_ADDRESS] Additional treatments
Concomitant medications or therap y to provide adequate supportive care may be given as 
clinically  necessary . 
After stud y enrollment , palliative radiotherap y may be given for bone pain or for other 
reasons (e.g. bronchial obstruction, skin lesions), provided that the total dose delivered is in a 
palliative range according to institutional standards. The irradiated area cannot be used f or 
tumor response assessment. During palliative radiotherap y, stud y treatment should be delayed 
and may  be resumed once the patient has recovered from an y radiation -associated toxicity .  If 
medication is interrupted for more than 14 day s, the decision to c ontinue will be made by  [CONTACT_810549].   Patients who are dose interrupted for

medication.
All concomitant therap y, including an aesthetic agents, vitamins, homeopathic/herbal 
remedies, nutritional supplements, must be recorded in the eCRF during the screening and 
treatment period, starting from the date of signature [CONTACT_43998], and ending at the 
EOT (end of treatment) visit. After the EOT visit, only  concomitant therap y indicated for 
treatment of an AE has to be reported. 
In case of major surgery  (as judged by  [CONTACT_093]), it is recommended to stop treatment 
with afatinib around one week prior to the surgery, and to restart treatment after complete 
wound healing. If afatinib is interrupted for more than 14 day s, the decision to continue will 
be made b y the BI Clinical Monitor in agreement with the investigator.
4.2.2 Restrictions
[IP_ADDRESS] Restrictions regarding concomi tant treatment
Concomitant medications or therap y to provide adequate supportive care may be given as 
clinically  necessary . 
Palliative radiotherap y may be given as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].
Additional experimental anti- cancer treatment and/or standard chemo- , immunotherap y, 
hormone treatment (with the exception of megestrol acetate and use of anti -androgens and/or 
gonadorelin analogues for treatment of prostate cancer), or radiotherap y (other than palliative 
radiotherap y for symptom control) is not allowed concomitantly  with the administration of 
afatinib. 
Afatinib is a substrate of the P -gp transporter. Caution should be exercised when combining 
afatinib with P -gp modulators.  For a list of potent P- gp inhibitors and induc ers see Appendix 
10.2.
[IP_ADDRESS] Restrictions on diet and life sty le
Patients should be advised to avoid any  foods known to aggravate diarrhoea .
To prevent skin related adverse events it is recommended to avoid intense irradiation with 
UV light and harsh detergents, seealso Section 4.4.[ADDRESS_1121014] use adequate contraception throughout the trial (from screening until 28days after last 
dose of trial medication). 
Acceptable methods of contraception include surgical sterilisation and double barrier method , 
and must be in accordance with local reg ulations where applicable. Double barrier method of

intercourse. Accepted barrier methods include diaphragm, female condom, cervical cap, male 
condom and intrauterine device ( IUD) (the diaphragm and cervical cap must be used in 
conjunction with spermicidal jelly /cream). Those with partners using hormonal 
contraceptives must also be using an additional approved method of contraception (as 
described above).  Natural “rh ythm” and spermicidal jelly /cream are not acceptable methods 
of contraception.
Pregnancies that result from a male participating in this trial must be reported following BI 
internal SOP using the pregnancy  monitoring form (refer to ISF).   
4.3 TREATMENT COMPLIANCE
The study  medication will be given in accordance with the protocol and the instructions of a 
site investigator. 
The appropriate number of afatinib tablets for 28 days of treatment will be provided to 
patients to be self -administered a t home.
Patients will be asked to bring the remaining trial medication to the investigator site for a 
compliance check according to the Flowchart . The remaining film -coated tablets will be 
counted b y the investigator/site staff and recorded at the investigator site. Discrepancies 
between the number of tablets remaining and the calculated number of tablets the patients 
should have taken must be docu mented and explained. At the end of each [ADDRESS_1121015] be dispensed. 
Patient’s repeatedly  missing scheduled on- treatment study  visits, unless due to exceptional 
circumstances, should be discussed with the BI trial monitor and be evaluated for 
compliance. A maximum of 25% of the dispensed afatinib doses may  be missed for other 
reason s than drug- related AEs. Patients who miss afatinib treatment more frequentl y are 
considered non -compliant.  
The investigator and/or the sponsor can withdraw a patient from the stud y in the event of 
serious and persistent non- compliance which jeopardizes the patient’s safety  or render study  
results for this patient unacceptable. 
4.4 MANAGEMENT OF DOSE REDUCTION AND EXPECTED ADVERSE 
EVENTS
4.4.1 Management of d ose reduction for afatinib
Afatinib t
reatment related toxicities will be managed b y treatment int erruptions and 
subsequent dose reductions according to the schedule described in Table 4.4.1: 1 . Dose 
reductions will apply  to individual patients only . Once the dose has been reduced, it cannot 
be increased later.

ILD is diagnosed, afatinib should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated as 
necessary .
In the event of an y unrelated adverse events, the investigator may choose to interrupt the 
medication for up to 14 day s, but no dose reduction should occur.  If the medication is 
interrupted for more than 14 day sfor an y reason , the decision to continue with afa tinib will 
be made b y the BI clinical monitor in agreement with the investigator.
4.4.2 Management of expected adverse events
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of diarrhoea and h ydration status following treatment with afatinib
Diarrhea occurs at a high frequency  and generally  begins within 2 weeks of exposure to 
afatinib. Although usually  mild to moderate, diarrhea may  lead to dehy dration and require 
treatment modification or discontinuation, so early management is essential (Table 4.4.1:1 ). 
At the time of initiation of treatment with afatinib, patients should be given a supply of 
loperamide to keep with them at all times or access to loperamide should be confirmed; and 
patients should be counselled o n the appropriate use. 
Patients must be advised to drink an adequate amount of fluid to make up for the fluid lost 
through diarrhea.

Personal hygiene Use of gentle soaps and shampoos for the body, e.g. pH5 neutral bath and 
shower formulations and tepid w ater.
Use of very mild shampoos for hair w ash.
Only clean and smooth towels are recommended because of potential risk of 
infection. The skin should be patted dry after a shower, whereas rubbing the skin 
dry should be avoide d.
Fine c otton clothes should be worn instead of synthetic material.
Shaving has to be done very carefully.
Manicure, i.e. cutting of nails, should be done straight across until the nails no 
longer extend over the fingers or toes. Cuticles are not allowed to be tri mmed 
because this procedure increases the risk of nail bed infections
Sun protection Sunscreen should be applied daily to exposed skin areas regardless of season. 
Hypoallergenic sunscreen with a high SPF (at least SPF30, PAPA free, 
UVA/UVB protection), pr eferably broad spectrum containing zinc oxide or 
titanium dioxide are recommended
Patients should be encouraged to consequently stay out of the sun.
Protective clothing for sun protection and wearing a hat should be recommended.
Moisturizer treatment It is important to moisturize the skin as soon as anti -EGFR therapy is started.
Hypoallergenic moisturizing creams, ointments and emollients should be used 
once daily to smooth the skin and to prevent and alleviate skin dryness.

There are three cate gories of endpoints in this trial: 1) the primary  endpoint , 2)secondary  
endpoints and 3) other endpoints. The primar y endpoint of this study  isa safety  endpoint, the 
occurrence of AEs leading to the dose reduction of afatinib. Thesecondary  endpoints are 
also safet y endpoints. The category  of “other endpoints” includes specific safet y and efficacy 
endpoints.

5.2 SAFETY
5.2.1 Endpoints of safety
The p rimary  endpoint of the study  is the occurrence of AEs leading to dose reduction of 
afatinib. Patients without AEs leading to dose reduction of afatinib will be considered as “no ” 
for the primary  endpoint. No confirmatory anal ysis is planned (i.e. no formal hy pothesis 
testing will be performed .)
The secondary  endpoints of the study  are:
Occurrence of CTCAE grade ≥
3 diarrhea
Occurrence of CTCAE grade ≥ 3rash/acne + 
Occurrence of CTCAE grade ≥3 stomatitis +
Occurrence of CTCAE grade ≥
3 -)(*%6>:$ ) H
Time to first dose reduction of afatinib caused b y AEs, defined as time from the date 
of the first administration of afatinib to the first dose reduction of afatinib caused b y 
AEs.
In the stud y, MedDRA preferred terms that describe AEs of similar nature will be grouped 
together as “grouped term” to ensure that important events will not be underestimated. These 
grouped terms are flagged by  a ‘+’.
Endpoint sfor safet ybelonging to the category  of ‘other endpoints’ are :
Adverse events evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0(R12-2532) .
5.2.2 Assessment of adverse events
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions of adverse events
Adverse event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence, including an 
exacerbation of a pre -existing condition, in a patient in a clinical investigation who received a 
pharmaceutical product. The event does not necessarily  have to have a causal relationship 
with this treatment.
Serious adverse event

2018 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies. All rights reserved.
This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE which results in death, is immediately 
life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disab ility / incapacit y, requires or prolongs 
patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], is a congenital anomaly  / birth defect, or is to be deemed serious for 
any other reason if it is an important medical event when based upon appropriate medical 
judgement which may  jeopardise the patient and may  require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definitions.
Intensit y of adverse event
The intensity  of adverse events should be classified and recorded according to the Common 
Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 and recorded in the eCRF .
Causal relationship of adverse event
Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant 
factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re -challenge, 
confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant 
history . Assessment of causal relationship should be recorded in the case report forms (CRF) . 
Yes: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
administered and the AE. 
No: There is no reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
administered and the AE. 
Worsening of the underly ing disease or other pre
-existing cond itions
Disease Progression in oncology  trials is a study  endpoint for anal ysis of efficacy . Disease 
progression is exempted from reporting as a (S)AE. Progression of the patient's underl ying 
malignancy  will be recorded in the appropriate pages of the (e)CR F as part of efficacy  data 
collection. Death due to disease progression is to be recorded on the appropriate (e)CRF page 
and not on a SAE form. 
Examples of exempted events of PD are: Progression of underl ying malignancy  (Progressive 
disease PD): if PD is clearly  consistent with the suspected progression of the underl ying 
malignancy  as defined by  [CONTACT_810550]. 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/Procedures due solel y to the progression of underl ying malignancy  (PD) 
• Clinical sy mptoms and/or signs of progression (with or without confirmation by  [CONTACT_810551] e.g. imaging, clinical measurement): if the sy mptom can exclusivel y be determined to 
be due to the progression of the underl ying malignancy  and does meet the expected pattern of 
progression for the disease under study . 
When there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the drug and the progression 
of the underl ying disease, the event must be reported as (S)AE on the eCRF and SAE form. 
Worsening of other pre -existing conditions will be recorded as an (S)AE in the eCRF and 
SAE form (if applicable) .

(U03 -3218-13).
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event and serious adverse event reporting
All adverse events, serious and non -serious, occurring during the course of the clinical trial 
(i.e., from signing the informed consent onwards through the follow -up period of 28days 
after the last drug administration, Table [IP_ADDRESS]:1 )will be collected, documented and reported 
to the sponsor by  [CONTACT_20616] r on the appropriate eCRFs / SAE reporting forms. Reporting 
will be done according to the specific definitions and instructions detailed in the ‘Adverse 
Event Reporting’ section of the Investigator Site File. 
For each adverse event, the investigator will provide the onset date, end date, intensity , 
treatment required, outcome, seriousness, and action taken with the investigational drug. The 
investigator will determine the relationship of the investigational dru g to all AEs as defined in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
The Residual Effect Period (REP), defined as the period of time after the last dose of 
medication when measureable drug levels or pharmacody namic effects are still likely  to be

For treated patients; From signing of 
informed consent to the end of the follow -up 
visit ( [ADDRESS_1121021] trial drug 
administration)Report all AEs and SAEs regardless of 
relatedness or whether the trial drug is 
administered . This includes all deaths.
After the 28 day followup visit until vital 
status followup (VS) is completedReport all related S AEs. 
After the patient has completed the study Active monitoring for adverse events is not 
required. If the investigator becomes aware of 
an SAE that occurred after the patient has 
completed the clinical trial it should be 
reported to the sponsor if cons idered relevant 
by [CONTACT_093].
If not stipulated differently  in the ISF, the investigator must report the following events using
theSAE form via fax immediately  (within 24 hours) to the sponsor: SAEs and non -serious 
AEs relevant to an SAE .The sam e timeline applies if follow -up information becomes 
available. In specific occasions, the investigator could inform the sponsor via telephone. This 
does not replace the requirement to complete and fax the BI SAE form.
BI has set up a list of AEs which are defined to be alway s serious. In order to support the 
investigator with the identification of these “always serious adverse events”, if a non -serious 
AE is identified to be serious per BI definition, a query  will be raised. The investigator must 
verify  thedescription and seriousness of the event.  I f the event description is correct, the 
item “serious” needs to be ticked and an SAE has to be reported in expedited fashion 
following the same procedure as above.
The list of these adverse events can be found v ia the Remote Data Capture (RDC) system.
With receipt of an y further information to these events, a follow -up SAE report has to be 
provided. SAEs and non -serious AEs must include a causal relationship assessment made b y 
the investigator.
The SAE form is to be forwarded to the defined unique entry  point identified for the BI OPU 
(operative unit ) (country - specific contact [CONTACT_810552]). This immediate report is required irrespective of whether the in vestigational product 
has been administered or not and irrespective of causal relationship. I t also applies if new 
information to existing SAEs becomes available. 
Pregnancy
In this stud y, pregnancy is not expected to occur in female participant s with the age of 70 
years or older. In rare cases, pregnancy  might occur in afemale partner of amale participant
with drug exposure to afatinib; in which case, pregnancy  must be reported following BI

Patients who meet the inc lusion criteria and not violate the exclusion criteria at enrolment are 
allowed to take part in this 
study .
6.2.2 Treatment period s
All p atients will receive continuous daily  treatment with afatinib until the criteria for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_688605] (Section 3 .3.4.1). Fo r administrative purposes, treatment is divide d into 
courses, which are each 4 weeks (28 days) in duration. 
During the treatment phase ,visits shoul d be performed as scheduled when ever possible, but 
within the visit window . Deviation in schedul ing for administrative purpose would be 
acceptable upon agreement between the investigator and the sponsor.
6.2.3 End of treatment visit
End of treatment visit should be performed within 7calendar day s after permanent 
discontinuation of treatment, regardl ess of the reason. If the decision to discontinue study  
treatment 
is taken during a scheduled visit, the EOT visit should be performed instead of the 
scheduled visit.

7.6 DETERMINA TION OF SAMPLE SIZE
In the general population of the LUX- Lung 3 study ,approximately  60% of the patients 
experienced AEs leading to dose reduction of afatinib. For 25patients and a 60% dose 
reduction rate (caused b y AEs), the 95% CI half -width for the dose reduction rate would be 
19.2% based on a normal approximation , resulting in a two- sided, 95% confidence interval of
(40.8%, 79.2%).  If a lower dose reduction rate of 50% is observed, the resulting 2 -sided, 
95% confidence interval would be ( 30.4%, 69.6%). Similarly , if a higher dose reduction rate 
of 70% is observed the 2 -sided, 95% confidence interval would be ( 52.0%, 88.0%).

8.4 LISTEDNESS AND EXPED ITED REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS
8.4.1 Listedness
To fulfil the regulatory  requirements for expedited safet y reporting, the sponsor evaluates 
whether a particular adverse event is "listed ", i.e. is a known side effect of the drug or not
.
Therefore a unique reference document for the evaluation of listedness need sto be provided. 
Forafatinib this is the current lyapproved drug label. The current version sof these reference 
documents are to be provided in the I SF. No AEs are classified as listed for study  design, or 
invasive procedure s.
8.4.2 Expedited reporting to health authorities andIECs/IRBs
Expedited reporting of serious adverse events, e.g. suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) to health authorities andIECs/I RBs, will be done according to local 
regulatory  requirements. Further details regarding this reporting procedure are provided 
in the 
Investigator Site File.

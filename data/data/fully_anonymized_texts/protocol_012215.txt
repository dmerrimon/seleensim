Indication s
Glasdegib is being studied in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of adult patients 
with previously  untreated acute m yeloid leukemia (AML) who are not candidates for 
intensive induction chemotherap y(Non -intensive AML  population) .
Glasdegib is being studied in combination with cytarabine and daunorubicin for the treatment 
of adult patients with previously  untreat ed acute my eloid leukemia (Intensive AML  
population) . 
Background and Rationale
Glasdegib is a selective, orally  administered inhibitor of smoothened ( SMO ), which 
demonstrates potent and selective inhibition of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in vitro and 
signific ant antitumor efficacy  in vivo.  The Hh signaling pathway  regulates cell 
differentiation and self -renewal in the developi[INVESTIGATOR_265302] o, and is ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y silenced in adult 
tissues.  Aberrant Hh signaling may  result from mutations in key  pathway  genes, 
non-mutat ional mechanisms related to the secretion of Hh ligands, or from cells in the tumor 
microenvironment.  Aberrant Hh signaling has been identified in a variet y of human 
leukemia and leukemic stem cells ( LSCs).1-3Upregulation of Hh pathway  components has 
been observed in chemo resistant AML cell lines in vitro, and pharmacological inhibition of 
the Hh pathway  resulted in decreased multi -drug resistance 1 (MDR -1) or P -glycoprotein 
(P-gp) expression in these cells.4  The SMO inhibitors, vismodegib (Erivedge®)5and 
sonidegib (Odomzo®)6have been demonstrated to be safe and effective in the treatment of 
patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma.  Glasdegib is being developed for indications in 
myeloid malignancies.
Acute M yeloid Leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous cancer of the hematopoietic system
character ized by [CONTACT_545111], pancytopenias causing infections and bleeding, and 
reduced survival.  AML is characterized by [CONTACT_545112], resulting in treatment resistance, disease relapse , and
reduced survival.  It is estimated that there will be 21,380 new cases and 10,590 deaths from 
AML in the [LOCATION_002] (US) in 2017.7Incidence rates in Europe are similar to rates in the 
[LOCATION_002].8  AML  is a disease of older people and is uncommon before the age of 45.  
The average age of a patient with AML  is about 67 y ears. 
Existing standards of care, such as anthracy cline + cytarabine or hypomethy latingagents like 
decitabine and azacitidine, can induce complete remissions in 5-70% of patients; however, 
remissions are not durable and disease relapse occurs in up to 60% of patients.[ADDRESS_713031] treatments like low-dose 
cytarabine ( LDAC) areassociated with response rates <20% and median overall survival 
(mOS) times of 5-6.[ADDRESS_713032] shown improved overall survival (OS) vs LDAC in AML  patients 
notsuitable forintensive chemotherapy . Midostaurin (Ry dapt®) is indicated for use in 
combination with standard ‘7+3’ cytarabine and daunorubicin induction ,and with cy tarab ine 
consolidation therap y, for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed AML who are

Page 23FLT3 mutation -positive.  Approval in 2017 was based on the Phase III RATIFY (Cancer and 
Leukemia Group B [ CALGB ][ZIP_CODE]) cl inical trial resulting in a 23% reduct ion in the risk of 
death compared with chemotherap y alone (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.77, 95% confidence interval 
[CI],0.63, 0.95; 2 sided p=0.016) .10  Event -free survival (EFS) was significantly  higher for 
Rydapt plus chemotherapy  versus chemotherapy  alone ( EFS median of 8.2 months compared 
to 3.0 months, HR = 0.78, 95% CI  0.66, 0.93 and 2 sided p=0.004). The most frequent 
adverse events (AEs) were febrile neutropenia, nausea, vomiting, mucositis, headache, 
musculoskeletal pain, petechiae, device -related infection, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], hy pergly cemia and upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_36115]. 
Reducing the incidence of disease progression to prolong survival remains the highest unmet 
medical need in the treatment of AML patients.11-13
Glasdegib has shown activity in m yelod ysplastic s yndrome (MDS) and AML with improved 
response rates and improved OS.
In the safet y lead -in cohort of the B1371012 stud y, 12 patients with previously  untreated 
intermediate -2 or high -risk MDS (n=7) AML with 20-30% blasts and multi -linage d ysplasia 
(n=3), ery throleukemia (n=1) or CMML (n=1) were treated with glasdegib in combination 
with azacitidine. Patients were treated for a median 94.0 days.  One patient had a glasdegib 
dose reduction 98days after start of treatment.  As of March 2017, 5 out of the 12 patients
responded . 3patients with CR (all AML ) and 2 patients with marrow CR .14The number of 
CRs observed with glasdegib and azacitidine appears favorable in the context of the 
15-17% CR rate seen with azacitidine alone.
In the randomized Phase [ADDRESS_713033] induction chemotherap y using 
established criteria15were stratified into good/intermediate risk vs poor risk by  [CONTACT_545113] 2:1 to receive in an open -label fashion, LDAC+glasdegib vs L DAC alone.  
In AML patient s (78 and 38 randomized to L DAC + glasdegib and LDAC, respectivel y), 
mOS for LDAC + glasdegib was 8.3 vs 4.3 months for LDAC alone ( and OS HR=0. 463, 
with p-value=0.0002) with 94 observed deaths .  Glasdegib ha s demonstrated a statistically  
significant and clinicall y meaningful improvement in OS when combined with LDAC vs 
LDAC alone in elderl y AML  patients not suitable for intensive chemotherapy , with no new 
significant safet y signals identified to date in a pro spective randomized trial.
In the ongoing single -arm Phase 2 cohort of Study B1371003, patients with previously  
untreated AML or high -risk MDS received intensive chemotherap y (‘7+3’) in combination 
with glasdegib in an open -label fashion. The ‘7+3’ regim en consists of 7 day s of cy tarabine 
and 3 day s of daunorubicin. Based on investigator’s assessment, CR rate for AML patients 
was 4 7% (80% CI 38.3- 55.6) and Complete Remission/Complete remission with incomplete 
hematologic recovery  (CR/CRi)rate was 55%(80% CI  46.7-62.7). The mOS for AML pts 
(n=64) was 16.3 months with 37 observed deaths.

Page 24Based on results from B1371003 , 2 prospective randomized (1:1), double -blind, placebo 
controlled registration trials in patients with newly diagnosed AML are proposed: in the first 
study , 400 AML patients suitable for intensive chemotherap y will be randomized to receive 
‘7+3’+ glasdegib (Arm A) or ‘7+3’+ placebo (Arm B) .  In the second study , 320 AML 
patients not suitable for intensive chemotherap y per investigator will be randomized to 
receive azacitidine + glasdegib (Arm A) or azacitidine + placebo (Arm B) .  The primary  
endpoint for both trials will be OS .  Both studies will be powered , conducted , and analy zed
separately and independently  under 1protocol (B1371019) to maximize efficiency .  
Together, the trials can provide substantial evidence to register glasdegib in AML  patients
treated in combination with 7+3 or with azacitidine.
Objectives and Endpoints
Protocol B1371019 consists of 2 independent studies: an intensi ve chemotherapy  study  and 
non-intensive chemotherapy  study.  Within each study , subjects will be randomized to 
chemotherap y with either glasdegib or matching placebo.  The primary  and secondary  
endpoints for each study  will be analyzed separately .  Respons e criteria for AML  are defined 
by [CONTACT_941] 2017 European LeukemiaNet ( ELN )recommendations.16
The objectives and endpoints for each stud y are the same unless otherwise specified and are 
described below:

Page 27Non-Intensive Chemotherap y Study
A total of 320 patients who are not considered adequate candidates to receive or who refuse 
intensive c hemotherapy will be treated as follows:
Experimental therap y:Glasdegib 100 mg PO QD or matching placebo. Both will be 
administered dail y, starting on Day 1 and will continue if subjects demonstrate 
reasonable evidence of clinical benefit and do not meet the criteria for progression 
regardless of an y delay s/modifications in the chemotherapy  treatment.   Subjects will 
continue glasdegib or placebo until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity , 
consent withdrawal, or death, whichever comes first .  If ther e is HSCT per local 
standard of care, single agent blinded therap y ma y be administered up to [ADDRESS_713037].
For subjects proceeding to HSCT following CR during the stud y period, glasdegib 
or placebo will be interrupted at least [ADDRESS_713038] date of stem cell infusion, once there is ANC
engraftment, no ongoing Grade [ADDRESS_713039] disease (GVHD ), and no 
ongoing SAE s that prevent resuming glasdegib or placebo in the judgement of the 
investigator.
All subjects will receive a zacitidine per local label or per the Investigational Product 
Manual (or summary  of product characteristics [ SPC]).  The dose for azacitidine is 
75mg/m2daily  for 7 days administered by  [CONTACT_6567] ( SC)injection or 
IVinfusion in 28 day  cycles.
Alternate dosing schedule to administer the 7 doses may be used to accommodate 
patient and treatment center availability .  Dose adju stments will be made according to 
institutional guidelines or per the SPC for azacitidine.  In addition, each subsequent 
cycle may  be delay ed for up to 28 day sto allow for recovery  of blood counts.
Subjects who proceed to HSCT will not receive azacitidine post HSCT. 
Discontinuation of Study Therapy for the Non -Intensive Study
If glasdegib or placebo is permanentl y discontinued for reasons other than objective disease
progression, patient refusal, or consent withdrawal, single-agent treatment with azacitid ine
may be continued if, in the Investigator ’s judgment, a clinical benefit has been observed.
In cases of unacceptable toxicity  or pregnancy , the patient must be withdrawn from study  
treatment and entered into the follow -up phase of the study .

Sample Size Determination
The interim and final analy ses of the intensive chemotherap y and non -intensive 
chemotherap y populations will be conducted separately and independent of each other.
Intensive Chemotherapy Study: 
Approximately  [ADDRESS_713040] s are to be enrolled with 33% expected to be censored. A total of 
267death events among the enrolled subjects would provide 90% power to detect an 
improvement in OSwith an HR of 0.67 (translating in mOS from 21 months to 31.5 months 
assuming a composite mOS for the population as follows: y oung AML [ aged 60years]with 
a mOS of 23.7 months and elderl y AML [aged >60 y ears] with a mOS of 15 months17,18)
using a [ADDRESS_713041] at a significance level of 0.025 and a 3 -look group -sequential 
design. 
Two interim anal yses would be conducted: an early  futility -only anal ysis of OS after 
50% death events occur and an efficacy and futility  analy sis of OS after 70% deaths occur in 
the Intensive Chemotherapy  population or upon completion of enrollment of these patients, 
whichever occurs later.
Non-Intensive Chemotherapy Study:
Approximately  320 subjects are to be enrolled with 31% expected to be censored. A total of 
220death events amon g all the enrolled subjects would provide 90% power to detect an 
improvement in OSwith an HR=0.64 (translating in mOS from 10.4 months9to 16.2 months)
using a [ADDRESS_713042] at a significance level of 0 .025 and a 2- look group -sequential 
design.  One interim efficacy  and futility  analy sis of OS would be planned after 60% death 
events occur in the non -intensive chemotherapy  population or upon completion of enrollment 
of these patients, whichever is later.

infused over 3 hours, given approximately Q12 hours (morning and evening) on Days 1, [ADDRESS_713063] be recalculated if the weight changes by >10%. The sta rt of subsequent 
consolidation cycles may be delayed from the end of the previous cycle to allow for recovery from reversible hematologic or non -hematologic drug-related 
toxicities.  If the consolidation cycle(s) extends longer than [ADDRESS_713064]: Follow local and institutional standard of care practices for HSCT conditioning and transplant (see footnote 37).
18.Drug Compliance : Dates of all missed doses must be recorded.  All glasdegib or placebo bottles including any unused tablets and patient dosing diaries will 
be returned to the clinic for compliance assessment and drug accountability. 
19.Bone Marrow Assessments for Disease Evaluation.
Baseline Bone Marrow Sample : For all patients, a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_545079] a bone marrow biopsy ispreferred .  Samples 
taken prior to consent but within 28-days of first dose can be used for disease classification only and need not be repeated.  Bone marrow samples required 
for other study assessments must be done after consent is signed.  
Response assessments require bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_545080]. All samples for disease assessments wi ll be evaluated by a 
local laboratory. In case of an inadequate aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] (eg dry tap), a bone marrow biopsy is required.
Post-Baseline Time points for Bone Marrow Sampling :
No bone marrow assessments are necessary if non-response or progressive disease can be diagnosed from peripheral blood evaluation  or radiological/clinical 
assessment. For instances when bone marrow assessments are done, bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_545081]. In cases
of an inadequate aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] (eg dry tap), a bone marrow biopsy is required.
•Induction: Bone marrow assessments will be collected post Induction to determine if a 2ndInduction is needed and at the end of the Remission
period to confirm remission status.
•Consolidation (applies to Cytarabine and post remission HSCT): Bone marrow assessments will be collected at the end of the Consolidation 
period with cytarabine to confirm disease status and determine response. A bone marrow assessment must be done prior to HSCT (may be same 
marrow assessment as remission assessment or post consolidation assessment).
•Glasdegib Therapy following Cytarabine Consolidation or post remission HSCT, up to 2 years : A bone marrow sample should be obtained at 
least every [ADDRESS_713065] dose of G-CSF or GM-CSF growth factor, it should be c onsidered “Not 
Evaluable” for response assessment and a BM evaluation should be repeated at least [ADDRESS_713066] dose of growth factor.
20.Bone Marrow genetics: Genetics (local) will be conducted on all patients using any scheduled or unscheduled bone marrow samples collected during study  
participation.  Please see Footnotes 19and 30for details on bone marrow samples collection schedule.  Baseline genetics classification must be completed 
within [ADDRESS_713067] risk category at randomization by [CONTACT_737] ( Appendix 14 ).
Post baseline genetic assessments may be limited to the abnormalities identified at baseline.
21.Adverse Event (AE) Assessments: Adverse events should be documented and recorded at each visit using the NCI CTC AE version 4.03.  Patients must be 
followed for AEs for [ADDRESS_713068] be 
collected up until the start of another anticancer therapy if the start of anticancer therapy is earlier than 28 days.  For ser ious adverse events (SAEs), the 
active reporting period to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative begins from the time that the patient provides informed cons ent, which is obtained prior to 
the patient’s participation in the study, (ie, prior to undergoing any study related procedure and/or receiving investigational  product), through and including 
[ADDRESS_713069].  Serious adverse events occurring to a patient af ter the active reporting period 
has ended should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events  that the investigator 
believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug are to be reported to the sponsor.
22.Concomitant Medications and Treatments: All concomitant medications and treatments should be recorded in the CRF. However, for post remission 
HSCT period, no concomitant medications will be recorded during the HSCT period. 
23.Red Blood Cells and Platelets Transfusion Recording : All red blood cell and platelet transfusions, including date of each transfusion and number of red 
blood cell and platelet units transfused will be recorded while on treatment.  Note that number of units not number of bags mus t be recorded. 
24.PRO surveys (MDASI-AML/MDS, EQ 5D 5L, PGIC, PGIS,  refer to Section 7.4 ):The surveys will be completed by [CONTACT_545117], Consolidation, and Follow-up (footnotes 30, 31). Interviewer administration may be used under 
special ccircumstances (eg, subject is visually impaired, forgot their glasses, feels too ill). PROs are collected every 7 days up to 28 days during Induction. 
There is no PGIC on Day 1 of Induction 1 but it will be administered for Day 1 of Induction 2. See footnote # 32for schedule during HSCT consolidation. 
.  Each PRO will continue to be 
completed at each Post Treatment Follow Up visit and during the Long-Term Follow-up phase by [CONTACT_648].  PROs should never be comple ted more than once 
on any calendar day.  For subjects hospi[INVESTIGATOR_545077] a timepoint falling on weekend or holiday, the PRO may be performed on the next business day.  If 
Consolidation(s) are extended PRO will not continue beyond Day 28.

29.End of Treatment : Obtain these assessments if not completed in the last week (last 3 months for BM assessments, unless the patient is coming off study 
treatment for disease progression). Occurs within [ADDRESS_713070] Treatment Follow Up Visits (First 2 years): A follow-up contact [CONTACT_31052] [ADDRESS_713071] ( Section 6.4 ). Subjects will return to site for visits every [ADDRESS_713072] 2 years only.  During these visits, physical examinations will be performed, hematology samples and information  on any new 
anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_545082], PRO data will be collected, and bone marrow biopsy and/or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_545083]. Date of post-treatment disease progression recorded in the source not es will be collected. 
31.Long Term Follow up activity log (Years ≥3): Survival Follow-Up Telephone contact, New Anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_236005], 
Disease progression, and PRO: Patients will be contact[CONTACT_80077] [ADDRESS_713073] information and/or to document date of death, if permitted by 
[CONTACT_1769]. 
32.PRO Collection during HSCT Post Remission Period (HSCT Period): PRO will be completed on the day of conditioning regimen administration as 
described in Section 7.[ADDRESS_713074] infus ion 
(Day 0) until the subject resumes glasdegib or placebo; then begin PRO assessments on Day 1 in SoA column labeled “Following Consolidation until up to
[ADDRESS_713075] randomization). Optimally, subjects will complete electronic PROs (in tablet) themselves.  However, if PRO tablets are  not available to the 
subject during this HSCT period, subject if able, will complete the PRO over the phone with a study coordinator so the coordinato r may complete the 
electronic tablet.  The study coordinator will make no attempt to clarify, explain, interpret, influence or filter, but simply r eading the questions verbatim and 
transcribing patient choice of answers directly onto the site tablet.
 
34.HSCT- related information: Donor details, type of transplant, day of donor stem cell infusion, and conditioning regimen (including radiation) will be 
collected in the CRF.  Presence of GVHD prior to resuming glasdegib/placebo post HSCT will be reported in the CRF. HSCT–related  information must be 
made available to the B1371019 study and must be able to be monitored. Post Remission HSCT period ( HSCT period ) is defined as time from start of 
conditioning until resuming glasdegib/placebo, death, withdrawal of consent, or entering follow up period post HSCT. No concomita nt medications 
(including transfusions) will be collected during the HSCT period.  Day 0 is defined as the day of stem cell infusion (HSCT). Se e Section 7.1.8 .
35.ANC engraftment: ANC engraftment is defined as ≥0.5 x 109/L for [ADDRESS_713076] (Day 0) until resumption of study therapy, death, or withdrawal: All deaths regardless of 
causality, Grade [ADDRESS_713077], e vents summarized in 
Table 13 will be reported.
37.Interrupt glasdegib/placebo at least 28 days prior to day of hematopoietic stem cell infusion (HSCT). Following HSCT, subjects may continue 
glasdegib or matching placebo 30-[ADDRESS_713078], once there is ANC engraftment, no ≥Grade 2 ongoing GVHD, and no ongoing SAEs that 
prevent resuming glasdegib or placebo, in the judgement of the investigator.

Type of Bone Marrow Sample
: For all patients , a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_545085]; in addition, a bone marrow biopsy is preferred .  
Samples taken prior to consent but within the 28-day window can be used for disease classification only and need not to be repe ated.   
  Thereafter bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_545086] a local laboratory.  Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_545087].  In cases of an inadequate aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] (eg dry tap), a bone marrow biopsy is required.  No bone ma rrow assessment is 
necessary if non-response or progressive disease can be diagnosed from peripheral blood evaluation or radiological/clinical assessment.
 
Time points for Bone Marrow Sampling:
•Baseline Bone Marrow must be completed at screening (within [ADDRESS_713085] dose), Response assessment when CR suspected or afte r end of Cycle 6; 
whichever, is earlier.  For patients receiving HSCT, a BM aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy must be done prior. Disease assessment will occur whe n progressive disease 
(PD) is suspected; then when the investigator suspects progression.
•Please see Footnote 28for details on collection of bone marrow assessments during the Post-Treatment Follow Up period.
17.Post remission HSCT: Follow local and institutional standard of care practices for HSCT conditioning and transplant. HSCT may occur at any time duri ng

1.1.Indication
Glasdegib is being studied in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of adult patients 
with previously  untre ated acute myeloid leukemia who are not candidates for intensive 
induction chemotherap y(Non -intensive AML population) .
Glasdegib is being studied in combination with cytarabine and daunorubicin for the treatment 
of adult patients with previously  untreated acute my eloid leukemi a(Intensive AML  
population) .
1.2.Background 
1.2.1. Acute Myeloid Leukemia 
Acute M yeloid Leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous cancer of the hematopoietic system
characterized b yincreased blast counts, pancytopenias causing infections and bleedin g, and 
reduced survival.  AML is a genetically heterogeneous malignancy characterized by [CONTACT_545119], resulting in treatment 
resistance, disease relapse, andreduced survival.  It is estima ted that there will be 21,380 new 
cases and 10,590 deaths from AML  in the [LOCATION_002] in 2017.7Incidence rates in Eur ope 
are similar to rates in the [LOCATION_002].8  AML  is a disease of older people and is uncommon 
before the age of 45.  The average age of a patient with AML  is about 67 years. 
Existing standards of care, such as anthracy cline + cytarabine or hypomethy lating agents like 
decitabine and azacitidine, caninduce complete remissions in 5-70% of patients; however, 
remissions are not durable and disease relapse occurs in up to 60% of patients.9For AML  
patients unable to receive intensive chemotherapy ,existing standard treatments like low-dose 
cytarabine ( LDAC )areassociated with response rates <20% and median overall survival 
(mOS) times of 5-6.5 months.  Hy pomethy lating agents, azacitidine and decitabine, although 
not approved in the [LOCATION_002] (US) speci fically for AML, have shown improved overall 
survival (OS) vs LDAC in AML  patients not suitable forintensive chemotherapy . 
Midostaurin (Ry dapt®) is indicated for use in combination with standard cytarabine and 
daunorubicin induction and cy tarabine consol idation chemotherap y, for the treatment of adult 
patients with newly  diagnosed AML who are Fms -like ty rosine kinase 3 ( FLT3 )
mutation -positive.19  Approval in 2017 was based on the Phase III RATIFY
(CALGB [ZIP_CODE] [Alliance]) clinical trial resulting in a 23% reduction in the risk of death 
compared with chemotherap y alone (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI ], 
0.63, 0.95; 2 sided p=0.016)[3].10  Event -freesurvival was significantly  higher for R ydapt 
plus chemotherap y versus chemotherap y alone (median of 8.2 months compared to 
3.0months, HR = 0.78, 95% CI  0.66, 0.93 and 2 sided p=0.004). 
The most frequent adverse reactions were febrile neutropenia, naus ea, vomiting, mucositis,

medi cal need in the treatment of AML patients.11-13
Glasdegib has shown activity  in my elodysplastic sy ndrome (MDS) and AML with improved 
response rates and improved OS.
Genetic and funct ional studies have demonstrated that AML  develops as a result of 
acquisit ion of genetic and epi[INVESTIGATOR_545089] -renewal.  The World Health Organization ( WHO )2016 classification 
define s AML as  20% blasts in the marrow or blood. A diagnosis of AML may  be made 
with less than 20% in patients with recur rent cy togenetic abnormalities [ eg,t(15;17), t(8;21), 
t(6;16), inv(160) ].  In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) revised their 
classification of m yeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia ( Appendix 2).20In this revision, 
acute prom yelocy tic leukemia (APL) with a t(15:17) gene fusion , was renamed as APL  with 
PML -RARA. AML with t(9:22) was renamed AML  with BCR -ABL breakpoint cluster 
region- Abelson 1 (BCR -ABL1 )to identify  the rare cases that may  benefit from ty rosine 
kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy .21,[ADDRESS_713100] and Glasdegib Mechanism
Glasdegib is a selective, orally  administered inhibitor of the seven- transmembrane protein, 
smoothened ( SMO ), which demonstrates potent and selective inhibition of Hedgehog (Hh) 
signaling in vitro and significant antitumor efficacy in vivo.  The Hh signaling pathway 
regulates cell differentiation and self- renewal in the developi[INVESTIGATOR_265302] o, and is ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y 
silenced in adult tissues.  Aberrant Hh signaling may  result from mutations i n key  pathway  
genes, non- mutational mechanisms related to the secretion of Hh ligands, or from cells in the 
tumor microenvironment.  Aberrant Hh signaling has been identified in a variet y of human 
leukemia and leukemic stem cells ( LSCs).[ADDRESS_713101]  resulted in decreased multi- drug resistance 1 (MDR -1) or P -glycoprotein 
(P-gp) expression in these cells.4The SMO inhibitors, vismodegib (Erivedge®)5and 
sonidegib (Odomzo®)6have been demonstrated to be safe and effective in the treatment of 
patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma.  Glasdegib is being developed for indications in 
myeloid malignancies.
In nonclinical models, SMO, acting via its effector, Glioma -associated oncogene homolog 
2 (GLI2), has been implicated in the maintenance of L SC dormancy  and associated resistance 
to chemotherap y and targeted therap y, while inhibition of SMO via glasdegib can cause 
LSCs to re -enter the cell cy cle.22-[ADDRESS_713102] a role in the treatment of AML  patients.

level may  be a responsive biomarker during treatment with glasdeg ib in AML .25Upon GLI 
binding to the NONOG pluripotency  promoter, GLI -NANOG axis promotes stemness and 
growth in several cancers. When NANOG expression was examined in primary  AML 
patient bone marrow samples f ollowing treatment with glasdegib, NONOG transcript levels 
decreased along with GLI -target gene s; such as, GLI1 and patched ( PTCH ).  Upregulation of 
Hhpathway  components has been observed in chemo -resistant AML cell lines in vitro, and 
pharmacological inh ibition of the Hhpathway  resulted in decreased multi drug resistance 
(MDR -1) or P -glycoprotein (P -gp) expressio n in these cells .4Additional evidence for the 
importance of the Hh pathway  in leukemia is derived from patients enrolled in the completed
single agent hematology  trials .Importantly , these preliminary  data suggest the mechanism of 
action of Hh inhibition in leukemia appears to be mobilization of blast cells from the bone 
marrow to the peripheral blood, with subsequent expansion and differen tiation of LSCs.23

Details of the nonclinical safet y program are provided in the current Investigator’s Brochure , 
Section 5.3.
1.2.4. Clinical Development
In the clinical development program to date, glasdegib has been studied in >300 patients 
across multiple diseases, and >100 healthy  participants. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Pharmacology of Glasdegib
Glasdegib has been orally  administered to humans at doses rang ing from 5 mg to 640 mg 
QD.  Following dail y dosing as a single agent, steady  state was usuall y achieved b y Da y 8of 
treatment.  In patients with my eloid malignancies and solid tumors, the time to maximum 
plasma concentration (T max) typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y ranged from 1 -4 hours both after a single dose and at 
steady  state . 
The geometric mean (geometric %CV) apparent volume of distribution (V z/F) of glasdegib 
was 188 (20) L following a single dose of 100 mg glasdegib in patients with hematologic 
malignancies and exceeded the ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_545090] (3L) suggesting that glasdegib is 
distributed into tissues from plasma.   In nonclinical studies, the fraction unbound in human 
plasma (fu) was 0.0899 at a concentration of 10 µ M (3744 ng/mL).   The absolute 
bioavailability  of glas degib was 77.12%.
In the first -in-participant (FIP) study  (B1371001), following peak plasma concentrations 
obtained after oral administration, glasdegib plasma concentrations appear to have a 
biexponential decline.  Glasdegib accumulated following repeated dosing with a median 
accumulation ratio ( Rac) ranging from 1.[ADDRESS_713103] s.  Renal excretion of unchanged glasdegib is ~17% of the 
total administered dose (100 mg).  
To estimate the impact of a inhibition of CY3A4/5 on glasdegib plasma expos ures, an 
interaction study  with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor, was conducted in 
14healthy  volunteers. A single 200- mg oral dose of glasdegib in the presence of 
ketoconazole compared to 200 -mg dose of glasdegib alone resulted in higher glasdeg ib 
exposures, with the mean plasma exposure ( AUC inf)ratio of 2.4 (90% CI: 2.15, 2.68) and the 
mean peak plasma concentration (C max) ratio of 1.4 (90% CI : 1.24 -1.58).   
A second interaction study to estimate the effect of a strong CYP3A4/5 inducer on glas degib 
PK was conducted using rifampin, a strong inducer of CYP3A4/5, in 12 healthy  volunteers.  
In the presence of rifampin, there was a 70% decrease (90% CI : 26, 31) in plasma exposures 
(AUC inf)and a 35% decrease (90% CI : 57,73) in peak plasma concentrat ion (C max) of a 
single 100 mg oral dose of glasdegib when compared to glasdegib alone indicating that 
CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_713104] of food on the maleate salt 100 mg tablet for mulation ( B1371026) 
showed a reduction in glasdegib C maxand AUC inf[geometric mean ratio (90% CI): 
76% (65%, 88%) and 86% (81%, 92%) respectively ]. Co-administration of glasdegib with a 
pH altering agent (the proton pump inhibitor, rabeprazole) under fas ting conditions, resulted 
in no change in glasdegib AUC inf(geometric mean ratio [90% CI ]: 100.58% [93.19%, 
108.55%]) and a 19.5% decrease in glasdegib C max(geometric mean ratio [90% CI ]: 
80.46% [70.68%, 91.59%]) compared with a single dose of glasdegib a dministered alone.

therapeutic and supratherapeutic exposure and placebo [blin ded]; moxifloxacin [open label]), 
single dose, [ADDRESS_713105] crossover thorough QT (TQT) study  was conducted that investigated the 
effect of glasdegib on cardiac repolarization in [ADDRESS_713106] of glasdegib on the QTcF interva l was demonstrated at the therapeutic (100 mg QD

squares mean differences between g lasdegib (150 mg and 300 mg) and placebo was below 
the pre -specified criterion of 20 msec –the threshold of clinical concern in oncology . None

B1371003 Phase 2 Randomized Non -intensive Chemotherapy
AML  + MDS patients not eligible for intensive chemotherap y were randomized 2:1 to 
glasdegib + LDAC orLDAC alone. The combination of glasdegib 100 mg QD plus LDAC
resul ted in aclinicall y meaningful and statistically  significant improvement in OS in the 
AML  subgroup that comprised 88% of all randomized participant s (hazard ratio (HR)=0.463 
[95% confidence interval (CI): 0.299, 0.717], p=0.0002), with an mOS of 8.3 months versus 
4.3months. Improvement in OS was consistent across pre -specified subgroups by
[CONTACT_411785]/intermediate and poor cytogenetic risk. The demonstrated benefits in OS were 
supported by [CONTACT_545121], which appeared to be consistent across the cli nical 
trial program when glasdegib was combined with standard -of-care chemotherapy  for AML or 
MDS such as azacitidine, decitabine, or 7+3 in the context of historical controls.

In a single -arm open- label trial in AML  + MDS patients who were able to receive intensive

1.3.Rationale for Drug Combinations and Dosing
1.3.1. Rationale for Glasdegib in Combination with Azacitidine as Non-Intensive 
Chemotherapy
In the randomized cohort of Study  B1371003, g lasdegib (100 mg PO QD) demonstrated a 
statistically  significant and clinically  meaningful improvement in median overall survival 
(mOS) when combined with LDAC vs LDAC alone in elderl y AML patients not suitable for 
intensive chemotherap y, with no new safet y signals identified. 
For AML patients who are not expected to tolerate intensive chemotherap y, treatment 
alternatives are limited to best supportive care, low- intensity  treatment, or cli nical trials with 
investigational drugs. When compared with conventional care regimens, azicitidine 
increased mOS from 6.5 months to 10.4 months.16  In the European Uni on (EU), azacitidine 
(Vidaza®) has been approved for patients aged [ADDRESS_713109] based on data from the AML -001 study .9Median OS was 10.4 months. The one year 
survival rate was 46.5%. Grade 3 -4 anemia , neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and 
thrombocy topenia rates, respectivel y, were 16%, 26%, 28%, and 24% with azacitidine.   
Azacididine is not curative ; therefore, continuing glasdegib or placebo until disease 
progression or toxicity  is reasonable.
Preclinical data demonstrated synergistic activity  when a SMO inhibitor erismodegib, was 
combined with 5 -azacitidine, a h ypometh ylating agent.32Silencing of chromosomes 5 and 
7enhances the activit y of 5 -azacitidine. In a 5-azacitidine ribonucleic acid 
(RNA )-interference sensitizer screen to identify gene targets within the commonly  deleted 
regions of chromosomes 5 and 7, drugs that inhibited SMO (erismodegib and vismodegib) 
showed single -agent activity  in AML cell lines. Combi nation of erismodegib with 
5-azacitidine demonstrated sy nergistic activit y in multiple AML  cell lines regardless of the 
extent of Hh pathway  gene expression. 
In Stud y B1371012, serial PK samples were collected for both glasdegib and azacitidine 
alone and in combination during the first cy cle of treatment, to assess forpotential drug -drug 
interaction. The PKparameters for glasdegib and azacitidine were similar when dosed 
separately  or in combination, indicating no evidence of drug -drug interaction potential.

reductions in disease relapse frequency , and improvements in OS in the co ntext of historical 
controls have been observed both in different populations (MDS, post -allogeneic stem cell 
transplant , elderl y AML and suitable for intensive chemotherap y) and with different 
treatment combinations commonly  used in the treatment of AML  patients (azacitidine, 
decitabine, ‘7+3’, allogeneic stem cell transplant .  AML  relapse does not typi[INVESTIGATOR_545092] 
2 years; therefore, it is reasonable to administer glasdegib or placebo up to [ADDRESS_713110] 
randomization.12,16
CR is achieved in 60% -80% of y ounger adults and 40% -60% adults (age  60) following 
administration with standard intensive ‘7+3’ chemotherap y consisting of 7days of cy tarabine 
(100-200 mg/m2) and 3 day s of an anthracy cline (ie ,daunorubicin
45-60 mg/m2.12,16  Thus, a ‘7+3’ is a reasonable induction regimen for patients who are 
medically  fit.34
The AML14 trial enrolled 1273 patients, predominantly  aged >60 years (although y ounger 
patients were allowed) with AML  and High Risk MDS.35The overall response rate across all 
arms was 62% ( CR54%, CRwitho ut platelet/ne utrophils recovery  8%); 5- year survival was
12%, and no benefits were observed in either dose escalation schedule. To determine if the 
addition of a Hhinhibitor can increase intensive chemotherapy  response rates, glasdegib will 
be administe red once dai ly and continuously  starting on Day 1, along with the start of 
cytotoxic therapy . This schedule is consistent with other m obilizing/cytotoxic combination 
studies, and will allow cells time to transit from the marrow to the peripheral blood 
compartment .[ADDRESS_713111] common consolidation regimens include single -agent cy tarabine at high doses and 
multiagent chemotherapy which lead to similar outcomes. High –dose cy tarabine ( HIDAC; 
2000 -3000 mg/m2) is com monly  used.[ADDRESS_713112] and with adverse genetics.16
The relapse incidence without the procedure is expected to be 35% to 40%.
In the Phase 1b portion of Study  B1371003 for glasdegib in combination with 7+3, the PKof 
100mg QD glasdegib at steady  state were in line with expected exposu res and the exposures 
of 7+[ADDRESS_713113] Characteristics (SPC)for cytarabine
38and daunorubicin.[ADDRESS_713114] hematologic malignancies. Study B1371003 with glasdegib in combination with LDAC and intensive chemotherapy (cytarabine/daunorubicin) initially tested both glasdegib 100 mg QD and 200 mg QD starting dose levels in the Phase 1b portion of the study.  However the clinical dose of 100 mg QD (MTD-4) was selected as the dose for further evaluation in the Phase [ADDRESS_713115] of a CYP3A4 inhibitor. These data provided a compelling rationale for the 100 mg QD dose of glasdegib being a safe and clinically effective dose in combination with azacitidine or cytarabine/ daunorubicin.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.5. Summary of Benefit Risk Assessment
Glasdegib is a selective, once daily oral tablet SMO inhibitor with a safety profile that 
appears consistent with other approved, marketed SMO inhibitors based upon data reported in the IB (September 2018).  In the ongoing clinical development program, glasdegib significantly improved OS in a prospective randomized study in combination with LDAC in AML patients not suitable for intensive chemotherapy. 
Data are mature, as median duration of follow-up is longer than mOS.  CCI
PF-[ADDRESS_713116] been observed both in different populations 
(MDS, post- allogeneic stem cell transplant ( SCT),andelderl y patients with AML  suitable for 
intensive chemotherap y) and with different AML treatment regimens commonly  used in the 
treatment of AML patients (azacitidine, decitabine, ‘7+3’, allogeneic SCT). 
The clinical safety database of glasdegib contains over [ADDRESS_713117] 100 mg .  The 
safet y profile observed so far appears consistent with thatreported for the SMO inhibitor 
class and the underly ing chemotherap y backbones. 
Based on the results from B1371003, 2 prospective randomized (1:1), double -blind, 
placebo- controlled registratio n trials in patients with newly  diagnosed AML are proposed: in 
the first study , 400 AML patients suitable for intensive chemotherapy  will be randomized to 
receive ‘7+3’+ glasdegib (Arm A) or ‘7+3’+ placebo (Arm B) .  In the second study , 
320AML  patients no t suitable for intensive chemotherapy per investigator will be 
randomized to receive azacitidine + glasdegib (Arm A) or azacitidine + placebo (Arm B).  
The primary  endpoint for both trials will be OS.  Both studies will be powered ,conducted , 
and anal yzedseparatel y and i ndependentl y under 1protocol (B1371019) to maximize 
efficiency .  Together, the trials can provide substantial evidence to register glasdegib in AML 
patients treated in combination with 7+3 or with azacitidine.
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOIN TS
Protocol B1371019 consists of 2 independent studies: an intensive chemotherapy  study  and 
non-intensive chemotherapy  study.  Within each study , subjects will be randomized to 
chemotherap y with either glasdegib or matching placebo. The primary  and second ary 
endpoints for each study  will be analyzed separately .  Response criteria for AML  are defined 
by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_713118] recommendations.16
The objectives and endpoints for each stud y are the same unless otherwise spe cified and are 
described below:
Prim ary Objective: Prim ary Endpoint:
To demonstrate that glasdegib is superior to 
placebo in combination with azacitidine

3. STUDY DESIGN
Two separate registration trials conducted under one protocol number are proposed to 
adequately and independently evaluate the addition of glasdegib in intensive and non-intensive chemotherapy populations. Each study will have an experimental treatment arm and a placebo arm.
Study B1371019 ( Figure 1 ) is a randomized (1:1), double-blind, multi-center, placebo 
controlled study of chemotherapy in combination with glasdegib versus chemotherapy in combination with placebo in adult patients with previously untreated AML (excluding APL with PML-RARA, AML with BCR-ABL1 and active central nervous system [CNS]leukemia) to support the proposed indication statements: 
•Intensive Study: Glasdegib is being studied in combination with cytarabine and 
daunorubicin for the treatment of adult patients with untreated AML.
•Non-intensive Study: Glasdegib is being studied in combination with azacitidine for
the treatment of adult patients with untreated AML who are not candidates for 
intensive induction chemotherapy.CCI

4.3. Screen Failur es
Screen failures are defined as subjects who consent to participate in the clinical study  but are 
not randomized.  A minimum set of screen failure subject data , should be collected to ensure 
transparent reporting of screen failure subjects. 
PF-[ADDRESS_713134]’s 
ability  to father or bear children must be assessed by  [CONTACT_545129]’s chart. Subjects who are, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] , 
sexually  active and at risk for pregnancy  with their partner(s) must agree to use at least
1highl y effective form of contraception throughout the study  and for at least 180days after 
the last dose of investigational product as defined in Table 6.  
The investigator or his or her designee, in consultation with the subject , will confirm that the 
subject has selected at least 1appropriate method of contraception for the individual subject
and his/her partner(s) from the list of permitted contraception methods (see below) and will 
confirm that the subject has been instructed in their consistent and correct use.  At time 
points indicated in theSchedule of Activities , the investigator or designee will inform the 
subject of the need to use at least 1highl y effective method of contraception consistently and 
correctly  and document the conversation, and the subject’s affirmation, in the subject’s chart.  
In addition, the investigator or designee will instruct the subject to call immediatel y if the 
selected contraception method is discontinued or if pregnancy  is known or suspected in the 
subject or partner (s). 
Highl y effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently  and correctly  (ie, perfect use) and 
include the methods described in Table 6.
4.4.2. Postmenopausal Def ined
Postmenopausal female
A postmenopausal state is defined as age 60 or older or no menses for 12 months without an 
alternative medical cause.
A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range (as per
the reference range used by [CONTACT_25699] ) may be used to confirm a postmenopausal
state in women under 60 years old and not using hormonal contraception or hormonal
replacement therap y (HRT).
Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one
of the non-estrogen hormonal highl y effective contraception methods if they wish to
continue their HRT during the trial. Otherwise, they  must discontinue HRT to allow
confirmation of postmenopausal status before trial enrollment.

2. Intrauterine hormone releasing system (IUS).
3. Intrauterine device (IUD).
4. Bilateral tubal occlusion.
5. Vasectomized partner:
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective form of 
contraception prov ided they are the sole male partner 
of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been 
confirmed.  If not an additional highly effective 
method of contraception should be used.1. Combined hormonal contraception (estrogen and 
progestogen).
 Oral.
 Intravaginal.
 Transdermal. 
 Injectable.
2. Progestogen only hormonal contraception.
 Oral; or 
 Injectable.
3. Sexual abstinence .
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective 
method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual
intercourse during the entire period of risk associated 
with the trial intervention. The reliability of sexual 
abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the 
duration of the trial and the preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the participant .
Note: Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), 
spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM) are not acceptable methods of contraception for this trial. 
Male condom and female condom should not be used together (due to risk of failure with friction).
4.5.Sunlight Exposure
Patients will be advised to report an y reaction to sun exposed skin. In addition, special
precautions will be taken to limit any  potential photo irritation effect, b y minimizing the
subjects’ exposure to light including high intensity  ultraviolet B light (UVB) sources such as
tanning beds, tanning booths and sunlamps. Subject s should be encouraged to apply
sunscreen/sunblock daily.

5.STUDY TREATMENTS
For the purposes of this protocol , and per International Conference on Harmoni sation ( ICH)
guidelines ,investigational product is defined as a pharmaceutical f orm of an active 
ingredient or placebo being tested or used as a reference /comparator in a clinical trial, 
including a product with a marketing authorization when used or assembled (formulated or 
packaged) in a way  different from the approved form, or when used for an unapproved 
indication, or when used to gain further information about an approved use (ICH E6 1.33) .
For this study , the investigational product sareglasdegib , azacitidine, daunorubicin, 
and cy tarabine . 
5.1.Allocation to Treatment
Allocation of subject s to treatment groups will proceed through the use of an interactive 
response technology  (IRT)System [Interactive Web Response (IWR)/Interactive Voice 
Response (IVR)]. The site personnel (stud y coordinator or specified designee) will be 
required to enter or select information including but not limited to the user’s identification 
(ID) and password, protocol number and the date of birth of the subject . The site personnel 
will then be provided with a treatment assignment and dispensable unit s(DU) or container 
number (s)when drug is being supplied via the I RT. The IRT s ystem will provide a 
confirmation report containing the subject identification number and DU (s) or container 
number (s)assigned. The confirmation report must be stored in the site’s files.
The study -specific I RT reference manual will provide the contact [CONTACT_545131] . 
Glasdegib or matching placebo t reatment allocation will be blinded to the subject , 
investigator, and the study  team . Randomization will be stratified according the stratification 
factors described in Section 9.3.[ADDRESS_713136] the sponsor prior to unblinding a participant’s treatment assignment are 
encouraged to discuss with a member of the stud y team if they  believe that unblinding is 
necessary , unless this could delay  further management of the participant. The date and 
reason that the blind was broken must be recorded in the source documentation . 
Treatment allocation will be subject , investigator and sponsor blinded. There is no plan to 
break the blind upon subject progression or permanent discontinuation from study  treatment .  
Blinding codes may  be broken in emergency  situations for reasons of subject safet y.
NOTE: Once the blind is broken for a given patient, the patient will no longer be able to 
receive additional study treatment, follow -up and long -term follow -upare expected. 
5.3.Subject Compliance
For glasdegib/placebo, all subject s will maintain subject dosing diaries throughout the study  
which will record the date of admini stration and all regular, missed, changed, or delay ed 
doses. 
Subject s are required to return all bottles, unused study drug and the subject dosing diary , at 
each cy cle(or Day  1 of Induction(s)) and at End of Treatment visit for compliance 
assessment and drug accountability . 
The number of tablets returned b y the subject at the end of the cy cleor Induction (s)will be 
counted, documented and recorded.
For azacitidine , daunorubicin , and cy tarabine , the site should complete the required dosage 
Preparation Re cord located in the Investigational Product Manual.  The use of the 
Preparation Record is preferred but it does not preclude the use of an existing appropriate 
clinical site documentation system.  The existing clinical site's documentation sy stem should 
capture all pertinent/required information on the preparation and administration of the dose 
including the methodology  used to calculate the subject body  surface area (BSA) .  This may  
be used in place of the Preparation Record after approval from the Sponsor .

5.5.Administration
5.5.1. General Administration Guidance for Study Drugs
Bone marrow evaluations are performed at specific times to determine clinical response and 
treatment progression decisions within the trial. Bone marrow assessments are described in 
the Schedule of Activities for Intensive Chemotherap y (Table 1,Table2) and for 
Non-Intensive Chemotherap y (Table 3,Table 4).
For subject s receiving chemotherapy , all subject s should be weighed within 7 2 hours prior to 
dosing for every  cycle (or start of Induction 1, 2) to ensure they did not experience either a 
weight loss or gain >10% from the prior weight used to calculate the amount of azacitidine , 
cytarabine ,or daunorubicin required for dose prepar ation. Decision to recalculate 
chemotherap ydose based on the weight obtained at each cy cle (or start of Induction 1, 2) can 
be in accordance with institutional practice for changes in weight of 10% or less; however if 
the subject experienced either a wei ght loss or gain of >10%, the amount of chemotherap y
PF-[ADDRESS_713137] 
recent weight /BSA obtained.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Glasdegib or Placebo in Subject s Receiving Intensive Chemotherapy and 
Non-Intensive Chemotherapy
Study  treatment (glasdegib or placebo) will be administered by [CONTACT_545132] 
100mg daily at approximately  the same time each day, preferabl y in the morning with 
approximately  8 ounces (240 ml) of water.   Study  treatment can be administered with or 
without food.  Tablets must not be crushed or cut; they  must be swallowed whole and not 
chewed.
A cy cle is defined as 28 days, in the Non -Intensive Chemotherap y study . There is up to a 
28day window to coincide with azacitidine admin istration; dose delay s due to toxicity  will 
not impact the cy cle duration or planned protocol assessments. 
If a subject forgets to take their dose at the regularly  scheduled time, and if less than [ADDRESS_713138] misses 
a day ’s dose entirel y, they must be instructed not to “make it up” the next day .  Missed doses 
will NOT be made up at any  time.  If a subject vomits any  time after taking a dose, they  must 
be instructed not to “make it up,” but to resume subsequent doses the next day  as prescribed.
If asubject inadvertentl y takes one extra dose during a day , the subject should not take the 
next day’sdose of glasdegib or placebo.
During the intensive chemotherap y study ,glasdegib/placebo dosing will begin on Day 1 and 
be given once daily  continuously  incombination with I nduction and Consolidation 
chemotherap y.  Glasdegib or placebo will continue to be administered for a maximum of 
2years (starting from randomization until 2 years) or until subject discontinues per

c.If after the second induction, the subject still shows residual or resistant leukemia, 
they must be discontinued from treatment and followed as described in Section 5.5.[ADDRESS_713154] induction bone marrow assessment and remission 
assessment will depend on investigator judgement. I n general:
The post first induction bone marrow assessment will occur approximately  
14-15days after initiation of first induction therapy ; how ever, the precise timing will 
be according to investigator judgment.  The post first induction bone marrow 
assessment is generally  done to assess marrow hypoplasia and determine if/when a 
second Induction is needed. Following the post first induction bone marrow 
assessment, subjects may complete Induction 1 therap y, start Induction 2 before 
finishing Induction 1, or end treatment and go to follow -up.
The remission bone marrow assessment usuall y occurs approximately  36-48days 
after initiation of inductio n therap y.  However, these timings will depend on 
investigator judgement.   The remission bone marrow assessment is generally  done to 
assess hematologic response following Induction therap y. Hematological response 
will be assessed using the bone marrow res ults from the remission bone marrow 
assessment.
PF-[ADDRESS_713155] s achieving < 5% bone marrow blasts ,after the completion of induction therap y are 
eligible to begin consolidation. Glasdegib will continue to be given at the dose given during 
induction (unless dose modification due to toxicity is required) once dail y in the morning

marrow evaluation should be repeated within [ADDRESS_713157] has not relapsed. At a minimum a 
bone marrow evaluation is required following the final consolidation cy clebefore an y 
subsequent therap y.
The start of subsequent consolidation cy cles may  be delay ed from the end of t he previous 
cycle to allow for recovery  from reversible hematologic or non- hematologic drug -related 
toxicities. If the consolidation cycle(s) extends longer than [ADDRESS_713158]; this is the day  when stem cells are infused. 
For post remission HSCT, glasdegib or placebo will be interrupted at least [ADDRESS_713159] date of stem cell infusion, once there is ANC 
engraftment , no Grade 2 ongoing GVHD, and no ongoing SAEs that prevent resuming

Section 8.4.2 ).Hold study drug until toxicity has recovered to 
baseline or Grade [ADDRESS_713176] epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] : Decrease by 1 dose level.

Interrupt glasdegib/placebo d osing.   If an alternative 
cause is found, restarting of glasdegib/placebo at the 
same dose may be considered.
Glasdegib/placebo should be permanently 
discontinued.
Appropriate follow- up assessments should be implemented until adequate recovery  (toxicity
resolves or returns to baseline) occurs.
Depending on when the adverse event resolved, treatment interruption may  lead to the patient 
missing all subsequent planned doses of glasdegib or placebo within the cycle. If the AE 
leading to treatment interrup tion recovers within the same cy cle, re -commencement of dosing 
in that cy cle is allowed. Glasdegib or placebo doses omitted for toxicity  will not be replaced 
within that cy cle (eg ,cycles will not be prolonged bey ond the 28 days in order to make up 
for an y missed glasdegib or placebo doses during that cycle). 
The need for a dose reduction at the time of treatment resumption should be based on the 
criteria outlined in Table 9, unless specificall y agreed otherwise following discuss ion 
between the i nvestigator and the s ponsor. If a dose reduction for glasdegib or placebo is 
applied in the same cy cle, the patient must return to the clinic to receive a new supply  of 
drug.
In the event of glasdegib or placebo treatment interruption for reasons other than 
treatment -related toxicity (eg ,elective surgery ) for a duration > 28days, the details of 
treatment resumption will be determined in consultation with the sponsor.Glasdegib/placebo

5.6. Investigational Product Storage 
The investigator or an approved representative, eg, pharmacist, will ensure that all 
investigational products, including a ny comparator and/or marketed products, are stored in a 
secured area with controlled access under required storage conditions and in accordance with 
applicable regulatory  requirements.
Investigational products should be stored in their original containers and in accordance with 
the labels. 
Any storage conditions stated in the SRSD (IB for PF -04449913 and EU SPC for Vidaza®,33

Site sy stems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a 
minimum, daily  minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as 
applicable, including frozen, refrigerated, and/or room- temperature products).  This should 
be captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout the study .  Even for 
continuous- monitoring sy stems, a log or site procedure that ensures active evaluation for 
excursions should be available.  The intent is to ensure that the minimum and maximum 
temperature is checked each business day  to confirm that no excursion occurred since the last 
evaluati on and to provide the site with the capability to store or view the minimum/maximum 
temperature for all non- working day s upon return to normal operations.  The operation of the 
temperature monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, 
should be regularl y inspected to ensure they  are maintained in working order. 
Any excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported to [COMPANY_007] upon 
discovery .  The site should actively  pursue options for returning the prod uct to the storage 
conditions described in the labeling, as soon as possible.  Deviations from the storage 
requirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to [COMPANY_007].

[CONTACT_545135] I nvestigator.  The number of tablets returned by  [CONTACT_545136] (or induction 1, 2) will be counted, documented and recorded.
5.7.1. Destruction of Investigational Product Supplies 
The sponsor or designee will provide guidance on the destruction of unused investigational 
product (eg , at the site). If destruction is authorized to take place at the investigator site, the 
investigator must ensure that the materials are destroy ed in compliance with applicable 
environmental re gulations, institutional policy , and any  special instructions provided by  
[CONTACT_4618] ,and all destruction must be adequatel y documented.
5.8.Concomitant Treatment(s)
All concomitant medications and treatments must be recorded in the CRF except during the 
HSCT peri od from the first day  of conditioning until a subject resumes glasdegib or placebo 
post HSCT .  During this HSCT period, no concomitant medications (other than transplant 
conditioning regimen) will be collected. If a patient resumes glasdegib o r placebo fo llowing 
HSCT , HSCT -related Medical History  must be provided.  This will include information 
regarding ongoing medical conditions and their associated concomitant medications that 
started from the first day  of conditioning until the time of re- starting glasdegib or placebo

5.8.1. Restricted or Prohibited Concomitant Medications
The following medications are not allowed during the active stud y treatment period:
Agents used to treat AML ;
Investigational agents;
Concurrent administration of herbal preparations;
CYP3A4/5 Inducers : A drug -drug interaction study in health subjects with the strong 
CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin, resulted in a 70% decrease in plasma exposures (A UC inf) 
and a 35% decrease in peak plasma concentration (C max) of a single 100 -mg oral dose 
of glasdegib.  Therefore co -administration of glasdegib and moderate/strong 
CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_713182] of moderate/ strong 
CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_713183] use restrictions dur ing the active stud y treatment period:
CYP3A4/5 Inhibitors: In a health y volunteer stud y, ketoconazole, a potent 
CYP3A4/5 inhibitor, produced a 2.4 -fold increase in plasma exposure and a 1.4 -fold 
increase in peak plasma concentration of glasdegib .  Therefo re a potential exists for 
drug-drug interactions with CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, and co -administration of 
glasdegib /placebo in combination with moderate/strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors is not 
recommended.  Selection of concomitant medication with no or minimal 
CYP3A4/5 inhibition potential is recommended.  Moderate/strong 
CYP3A4/5 inhibitors ( Appendix 6and Appendix 7) should be used with caution and 
only if considered medically  necessary .  If a moderate/strong CYP3A4/5 inhibit or is 
to be initiated in addition to glasdegib /placebo, the guidance provided in Section 7.1.[ADDRESS_713184] the Sponsor study team.
Drugs with a known risk of Torsade de pointes (TdP): Glasdegib has b een shown 
to have the potential to prolong the QTc interval in pre -clinical studies. In the 
first-in-subject study  as single agent, Grade [ADDRESS_713185] doses tested (400 mg and 600 mg) .  While the glasdegib dose 
evaluated in this study  is [ADDRESS_713186] of such drugs is provided in Appendix 8.  Use of these drugs is 
not recommended unless there are no alternatives. If a TdP drug is to be initiated 
in addition to glasdegib /placebo the guidance provided in Section 7.1.[ADDRESS_713187] be followed. 
QT prolonging medications (without a risk of TdP) should be avoided whenever 
possible. 
Concomitant administration of multiple moderate/strong CYP3A4/5 inhib itors, TdP 
drugs, and/or QT prolonging medications (without a risk of TdP) is not 
recommended .
5.8.2. Permitted Concomitant Medications

6. STUDY PROCEDURES 
6.1. Screening
Screening can be accomplished over one or multiple visits over a 4-week period (28 days), 
unless specifically noted otherwise (ie, bone marrow sample collection).  Protocol specific tests or procedures not considered standard of care can only be done after the subject has signed the Informed Consent document.  The Informed Consent document may be signed up to [ADDRESS_713189] an end of treatment visit ( Section 6.3),and be entered into the post-treatment 
follow -up phase ( Section 6.4).
Subjects who permanently discontinue bo th study  drugs (azacitidine or daunorubicin and 
cytarabine or glasdegib/placebo) for an y reason (except death, or withdrawal of subject
consent for follow -up) will enter into the follow -up phase of the stud y. 
6.3.End of Treatment Visit
The End of Treatment Visit should be scheduled as soon as possible once a patient has been 
withdrawn from stud y drug.  For a detailed list of assessments and procedures to be 
completed please refer to the Schedule of Activities.
Patients continuing to experience toxicity  following discontinuation of treatment will be 
followed b y the Investigator at least every [ADDRESS_713190] to capture an y potential adverse 
events (see the Time Period for Collecting AE/SAE I nformation section) and to confirm 
appropriate contraception usage (see the Contraception section).  Contact [CONTACT_168074] a phone call.
Please refer to the Schedule of Activities for d etails on assessments to be completed during 
the 2 ty pes of follow -up visits : post treatment follow -up visits (first [ADDRESS_713191] 
dose of study  medication) and long -term follow -up (3 years) .
Subject s will be followed for survival for up to [ADDRESS_713192] information and/or to documen t date of death, as permitted by  [CONTACT_1769].
6.5.Subject Withdrawal
Subject s may  withdraw from the study  at any  time at their own request, or they  may  be 
withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety (see also the 
Withdrawal f rom the Study  Due to Adverse Events (see also the Subject Withdrawal Section)
section) or behavioral reasons, or the inability  of the subject to comply  with the 
protocol -required schedule of study  visits or procedures at a give n study  site. 
Reasons for withdrawal of study  treatment may  include: 
Objective disease progression in the Intensive and Non-Intensive Chemotherap y 
Study  or Treatment Failure or Hematologic relapse (Lack of Efficacy ) in the Intensive 
Chemotherap y Study ac cording to the [ADDRESS_713193] Recommendations ( Appendix 4):16

Reasons for withdrawal from study  follow -up may include:
Study  terminated by  [CONTACT_2728];
Lost to follow -up;
Withdrawal of subject consent for an y further contact;
Death.
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every  effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_1560] .  All attempts to contact [CONTACT_8873] ’s medical record.  In any  circumstance, every  effort 
should be made to document subject outcome, if possible.  The Investigator should inquire 
about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return all unused investigational 
product(s), request that the subject return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow up with 
the subject regarding an y unresolved AEs.
If the subject withdraws from the study , and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should b e performed, and no additional data should be 
collected.  The sponsor may  retain and continue to use any  data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent.
Withdrawal of consent :
Subject s who request to discontinue receipt of study  treatment will remain in the study  and 
must continue to be followed for protocol specified follow- up procedures.  The only  
exception to this is when a subject specificall y withdraws consent for an y further contact 
[CONTACT_310799].  
Subject sshould notify  the investigator in writing of the decision to withdraw consent from 
future follow -up, whenever possible.  The withdrawal of consent should be explained in 
detail in the medical records by [CONTACT_093], as to whether the withdrawal is only  from 
further receipt of investigational product or also from study  procedures and/or post -treatment 
study  follow -up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page.  In the event that vital status 
PF-04449913
B1371019
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 12 April 2019 
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 93(whether the subject is aliv e or dead) is being measured, publicly  available information 
should be used to determine vital status only  as appropriatel y directed in accordance with 
local law.
Lost to follow- up: 
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subject s to determine and r eport their ongoing 
status.  This includes follow -up with persons authorized by  [CONTACT_74084].  Lost 
to follow -up is defined by  [CONTACT_53981] y to reach the subject after a minimum of [ADDRESS_713194]’s medical 
records.  If it is determined that the subject has died, the site will use locally permissible 
methods to obtain the date and cause of death.  If, after all attempts, the subject remains lost 
to follow -up, then t he last -known- alive date as determined by  [CONTACT_61861]’s medical records.
7.ASSESSMENTS
Every  effort should be made to ensure that the protocol -required tests and procedures are 
completed as described.  Ho wever, it is anticipated that from time to time there may  be 
circumstances outside of the control of the investigator that may  make it unfeasible to 
perform the test.  In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the 
safet y and w ell-being of the subject .  When a protocol -required test cannot be performed, the 
investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions that 
he or she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as po ssible.  The 
study  team will be informed of these incidents in a timely  manner.
For samples being collected and shipped, detailed collection, processing, storage, and 
shipment instructions and contact [CONTACT_545138] p rior

7.1.Safety Assessments
Safety  assessments will include collection of AEs, SAEs, vital signs, phy sical examinations, 
triplicate ECGs (12 -lead), laborato ry assessments (includ ing genetics), transfusion s, 
HSCT -related information, and verification of concurrent medications and interventions.
7.1.1. Cardiac Testing ( MUGA /ECHO)
For subjects to be enrolled in the I ntensive Study , an ECHO or MUGA scan is required at 
screening. If the LVEF is  50%, the subject may  proceed to their first induc tion therap y.If 
the L VEF is <50%%, the subject may  not be included in the Intensive Chemotherapy  Study , 
per Section 4.2 and may  be eligible for the treatment in the Non -intensive Chemotherapy
Study .
If a second cycle of induction chemotherapy  is indicated, a second MUGA or ECHO is 
required prior to initiating the second cy cle if clinically  indicated (eg, subject exhibiting signs 
of cardiac failure). If the second MUGA or ECHO demonstrates a L VEF <45%, the subject 
is not eligible to receive additional induction chemotherap y and will be removed from the 
trial.
PF-[ADDRESS_713195] 25 mIU/mL, will be performed on [ADDRESS_713196] administration (first dose).  I n addition, for the Intensive Study , a 
pregnanc y test must also be done at the start of every  Induction (1,2) during the active 
treatment period, and at Day 1 of each Consolidation Cy cle with single -agent cy tarabine, 
Day 1 of each cy cle for single -agent glasdegib/placebo following the period labeled as
“Consolidation up to [ADDRESS_713197] randomization ” (as labeled in Table 1),and the end of 
treatment.  For the Non- intensive Study , a pregnancy  test must be done every  cycle during 
the active treatment period and at the end of trea tment. 
Following a negative pregnancy  result at screening, appropriate contraception (defined in
Section 5.3 ) must be commenced and a further negative pregnancy  result will then be 
required at the baseline visit before the subject may receive the study  treatment.  Pregnancy  
tests will be repeated at every  treatment cy cleor start of each induction(s) during the active 
treatment period, at the end of study  treatment, and additionally  whenever 1menstrual cy cle 
is missed or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected.  Additional pregnancy  tests 
may also be undertaken if requested by  [CONTACT_128624] (I RBs)/Ethic 
Committees (ECs) or if required by [CONTACT_427]. In the case of a positive confirmed 
pregnancy , the subject will be withdrawn from administration of study  treatment and enter 
into the Follow- up phase of the study . 
7.1.3. Adverse Events
Assessment of AEs will include the t ype, incidence, severit y (graded b y the NCI  CTCAE 
version 4.03) timing, seriousness, and relatedness.  Additional information regarding AE and 
Serious AE (SAE) reporting is provided in Section 8.  Assessment of acute GVHD will be 
graded by [CONTACT_545139] G rading 
(Appendix 15).46  Assessment of chronic GVHD will be assessed based on the National 
Institutes of Health ( NIH) Dia gnosis and Staging Working Group Report .47,48
7.1.4. Laboratory Safety Assessments
Hematology , blood chemistry , coagulation and urinaly sis assessments will be drawn at the 
time points described in the Schedule of Activities and will be anal yzed by [CONTACT_39722]/I nvestigator at local laboratories.  Laboratory  certifications and normal ranges with units 
must be provided to the Sponsor.
Laboratory  assessment s should be obtained during the 28 -day screening period as described 
in the Schedule of Activities and as defined in Table 12.  There is no need to repeat on 
Day 1if these assessments are performed withi n 3days prior to randomization. From 
Cycle2 Day  1 (C2D1) onwards (or Induction [ADDRESS_713198]) , ifa hematology  (complete blood 
count [ CBC ]with differentials) sample is obtained within [ADDRESS_713199] of required laboratory  tests.

Transfusions will not be collected during the HSCT period (Day [ADDRESS_713201] therapy  follow up ).
7.1.6. Vital Signs and Physical Examination
Vital signs will include blood pressure and heart rate (to be recorded in sitting position).  
Subject s will have a ph ysical exam (PE) including an examination of major body  systems,
measurement b y palpation of spleen and liver, weight, height and assessment of Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology  Group ( ECOG ) performance status (Appendix 3).  If PE obtained 
within [ADDRESS_713202] be recorded at 
Screening and Day 1of each cy cleor Day  1 of Induction(s) .
7.1.7. Triplicate (12- Lead) ECGs
See the Schedule of Activities for the specific time points of local El ectrocardiogram ( ECG )
collection and Table 10for dose modifications related to management of QTcF prolongation.
Triplicate 12 -lead (with a 10 -second rh ythm strip) tracing will be performed for ECGs at
every  time p oint. It is preferable that the machine used has a capacity  to calculate the
standard intervals automatically .The acceptable mean on treatment upper limit of QTc
interval will be using the Fridericia (QTcF) correction method. At each time point
3conse cutive supi[INVESTIGATOR_545097]  2 minutes (but no longer than
5 minutes) apart, to determine the mean QTcF interval. The sites will be provided with a
simple calculation tool that will allow for real-time assessment of mean QTcF values from
the triplicate QT and heart rate measurements.
The acceptable mean on -treatment upper limit of QTcF interval is [ADDRESS_713203] -dose QTcF value >480 msec, please refer to Table 10of the protocol
for detailed instructions on management of QTcF prolongation and handling dose delay s and
dose modifications for glasdegib/placebo.
When matched with PK sampling, every  effort should be made to perform the ECGs before
each PK sample dr awing such that the PK sample is collected at the nominal time (ie, the
timing of the PK collections over rides the timing of the ECG collections). A [ADDRESS_713204] -Related I nformat ion
Donor details, ty pe of transplant (myeloablative, non -myeloablative, or reduced intensity ), 
day of donor stem cell infusion, and conditioning regimen (including radiation) will be 
collected in the CRF.  Presence of GVHD prior to resuming glasdegib/plac ebo post HSCT 
will be reported in the CRF.  HSCT –related information must be made available to the 
B1371019 study staff and must be able to be monitored. 
Post Remission HSCT period (HSCT period) is defined as time from start of conditioning 
until resuming glasdegib/placebo, death, withdrawal of consent, or entering follow up period 
post HSCT.  No concomitant medications (including transfusions) will be collected during 
the HSCT period.  Day  0 is defined as the day  of stem cell infusion (HSCT).
Post HSCT, a ny ongoing AEs and concomitant medications to treat ongoing AEs from the 
HSCT period must be collected in the CRF.
7.1.9. ANC Engraftment
Follow ing post remission HSCT, ANC engraftment must be confirmed before resuming 
glasdegib or placebo.  Confirmed ANC engraft ment is defined by  [CONTACT_58846] ≥0.5 x 109/L for 
3consecutive days without growth factor support following HSCT using myeloablative or 
non-myeloablative conditioning regimen.
7.1.10. Pharmacokinetics Assessments
Every  effort must be made to obtain the PK samples at the sc heduled nominal time relative to 
dosing.  However, PK samples obtained within 10% of the nominal time (eg, within 
6minutes of a 60 minute sample) will be considered protocol compliant, and the exact time 
of the sample collection should be noted on the CRF .  The pre -dose PK sample should be 
collected within [ADDRESS_713205] operating procedures.  Details regarding the collection, processing, storage and 
shippi[INVESTIGATOR_545098] t he laboratory  manual.

7.2.1. AML Response Criteria
Disease response, measured from baseline through the End of Treatment will be evaluated 
using a modified version of the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) recommendations for 
diagnosis and management of AML  in adults (Appendix 4).16ELN response a ssessments 
include evaluation of bone marrow, peripheral blood neutrophils, platelets, and blast %, 
assessment for EMD, and results from central lab MRD assessment. Every  subject must 
have an Investigator determined Response Assessment documented per Appendix 4or 
response should be marked as indeterminate if the evaluation does not meet a specific ELN
response criteri on. 
All subject files and bone marr ow assessment slides/samples must be available for source 
verification.
CR with partial hematologic recovery  (CRh) will be assessed for the Non-intensive 
chemotherap y stud y.  CRh is defined as ANC >0.5x109/L and p latelets >50x109/Lwithout 
qualify ing for CR .
7.2.2. Genetics 
For all subject s, genetics must be performed using any scheduled or unscheduled bone 
marrow biops y and/or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_545099] y participation.
Baseline genetics classification must b e completed within [ADDRESS_713206] recommendations for diagnosis and management 
of AML in adults ( Appendix 14).16  
Baseline genetics classification known at the time of randomization will be used to stratify  
subjects; therefore, the Investigator must review available, baseline genetic and molecular 
reports and stratify each subject.
Following baseline assessments, subsequent anal ysis of genetic abnormalities may be 
restricted to abnormalities identified at baseline.  Molecular abnormalities will be repeated at 
each none marrow assessment per standard of care.  
7.2.3. Bone Marrow Assessments
Please see the Schedule of Activities for specific assessment time points for BM biopsy
and/or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_55523] .  Bone marrow samples should be prepared according to the study 
Laboratory  Manual. Results of all bone marrow evaluations performed during the study  
participation will be reported in the CRF.
The importance of timely and complete di sease assessments (including BM assessments) at 
screening and during the study  cannot be understated.  Failure to perform any  of the required 
disease assessme nts will result in the inability  to determine disease status for that time point 
and have the potential to weaken the conclusions of this study .
PF-[ADDRESS_713207] analysis are part of the response assessments in the main study; therefore, these samples are a required part of the study and should always be 
collected.  Following MRD analysis on the whole blood sample, any remaining sample will 
be discarded rather than being used for molecular profiling.

7.4. Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs)
Patient reported outcomes will be assessed using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory 
AML/MDS Module (MDASI-AML/MDS), EuroQol 5-Dimension questionnaire 5-Level version (EQ-5D-5L), Patient Global Impression of Symptoms (PGIS), and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC).   
 
PROs are completed at the same interval as drug dosing, clinical visits, and post-treatment 
follow-up are conducted.  Refer to Table [ADDRESS_713208] be strictly limited to transcription and data entry of patient responses, 
without any attempt to interpret, lead, or influence.  Interviewer administration may be used under special circumstances (eg, patient is visually impaired, forgot their glasses, or feels too ill). If interviewer administration is required, every effort should be made to have the same interviewer administer the PRO surveys to the patient.  In addition, the interviewer will stay true to the patient’s response and not alter it.
Patients must complete these PRO surveys prior to any discussion of the patient’s health or 
treatment with their physician or other healthcare personnel at the site.  While every effort should be made to have patients complete these PRO surveys prior to dosing with any study drugs and other clinical procedures, flexibility is allowed to accommodate for site-specific operating procedures.CCI

7.4.1. MDASI -AML/MDS
The MDASI -AML/MDS is a validated modulized patient reported outcome measure for 
AML  and MDS.49-51
It consists of a 19- item core cancer module and a four- item AML/MDS specific module 
[Appendix 9].  The 23 items are designed to measure 13 core cancer s ymptoms (pain, fatigue, 
nausea, disturbed sleep, distress, shortness of breath, problem remember ing, lack of appetite, 
drowsiness, dry  mouth, sadness, vomiting, and numbness), 4 AML /MDS -specific s ymptoms 
(malaise, diarrhea, muscle weakness, and skin problems), and 6 areas of interference (general 
activity , mood, work, walking, relations with other pe ople, and enjoy ment of life) The core 
module’s [ADDRESS_713209] 
frequency  and/or severit y in patients with various cancers and treatment t ypes.  The four -item 
AML /MDS -module includes additional s ymptoms that are uniquel y relevant to patients with 
AML  and MDS. 
It measures at the severity of symptoms and related interference at their WORST level in the 
last 24 hours by [CONTACT_545141] 0 -10 numeric rating scale 
(NRS), w here 0 =“not present” or “did not interfere” and 10 = “as bad as you can imagine” 
or “interfered completel y”. 
The instrument is brief, simple, and eas y to use. Its 24 hour recall period and 0-10 numerical 
rating scale are eas y for patients to understand and complete.  The burden to the patient is 
minimal, as it takes a few minutes to complete the questionnaire.
For this study , the response for the single item “Fatigue” (one of the 13 MDASI  core cancer 
symptoms) will be anal yzed separatel y as the key  secondary  efficacy  endpoint.
7.4.2. EQ-5D-5L
The EQ -5D- 5L (Appendix 10) is a brief, self -administered, validated and reliable generic 
health status instrument developed b y the EuroQoL  Group .It consists of the EQ -5D 
descr iptive s ystem and a visual analogue scale (VAS), the EuroQoL visual analogue scale 
(EQ- VAS). 
The EQ -5D descriptive sy stem measures a patient’s health state on 5 dimensions: mobility , 
self-care, usual activities, pain /discomfort, and anxiety /depression.  The patient is asked to 
indicate his/her health state by[CONTACT_545142] a five -level scale (1=no problem, 
5=extreme problem).  This rating resulted in a 1 -digit number expressing the level selected 
for that dimension.  The digits for the 5 dimensions were combined in a 5- digit number 
describing the respondent’s health state.  It shoul d be noted that the numerals [ADDRESS_713210] no 
arithmetic properties and should not be used as a cardinal score.
PF-04449913

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 104EQ-5D-5 L healt h states, defined by  [CONTACT_20367] -5D-5 L descriptive system, can be converted into 
a single index value ( the EQ -5D Index or “utility ") between 0 to 1 by  [CONTACT_2931] a formula that 
essentially  attaches country -specific values (also called weights) to each of the levels in each 
dimension. The index can be calcu lated by  [CONTACT_386595] 1, the 
value for full health (ie ,state [ZIP_CODE]). 
Currently , EQ-5D- 5L value sets are available for each country  that performed a va luation 
study  for the EQ -5D- 3L. By [CONTACT_545143]-5D- 5L descriptive sy stem, index values for the EQ -5D-5L can be calculated. 
Documents containing tables of values for all 3125 health states and the ‘EQ -5D- 5L 
Crosswalk Index Value Calculator’ can be downloaded from the EuroQ ol website.
The EQ -5D Index scores range generally  from [ADDRESS_713211] health.  The index values, presented in country  specific value sets, are a 
major feature of the EQ -5D instrument, facilitating the calculation of quality -adjusted life 
years (QALYs) that are used to inform economic evaluations of health care interventions.
The EuroQoL visual analogue scale ( EQ VAS )records the respondent’s self -rated health on 
a 20-cm vertical, visual analogue scale f rom 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best 
imaginable health state). This information could then be used as a quantitative measure of 
health as judged by [CONTACT_112775].
A score difference of 0.08 for the EQ -5D Index score and of 7 for the EQ -VAS are 
recommended as estimates of minimally  important differences for the EQ- 5D.
7.4.3. Patient Global Impression of Symptoms
The Patient Global Impression of Sy mptoms ( PGIS ) (Appendix 11) and the Patient Global 
Impression of Change (PGI C) (Appendix 12) are employ ed as anchors in responder anal yses 
for MDASI -AML/MDS, especiall y the fatigue item, which is a key  secondary  endpoint. 
PGIS is generall y the preferred anc hor over PGI C because PGI C may  be subject to recall 
bias. As recommended by  [CONTACT_2165] ( FDA ), for this protocol, both 
anchor scales will be used to provide an accumulation of evidence to help interpret a 
clinically  meaningful score c hange in MDASI -AML /MDS.
The PGI S (Appendix 11) is a single1- item questionnaire designed to assess patient ’soverall 
impression of disease severity  at a given point in time. It uses a 4- point Likert scale as 
follows: I n the last 24 hours, my  leukemia sy mptoms are: 1 -“Absent (no s ymptoms)”, 
2-“mild”, 3-“ moderate”,  4=”severe”,  .
It will be used as an anchor for defining a “responder threshold”, on MDASI -AML/MDS and 
can also be used to create severit y categorizat ion for this PRO to enhance interpretation.
Patients complete this questionnaire at baseline, and repeatedly  at the same time points as the 
MDASI -AML/MDS is collected.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 1057.4.4. Patient Global Impression of Change 
The Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) ( Appendix 12 ) is a single-item 
questionnaire designed to assess the patient’s overall sense of whether there has been a change since starting treatment as rated on a 7 point Likert scale anchored by (1) ‘very much improved’ to (7) ‘very much worse’, with (4) =’ no change’.  The PGIC is a measure of “participant rating of global improvement and satisfaction with treatment”.
1. This instrument is used to determine global improvement as assessed by [CONTACT_545144] a responder definition for MDASI-AML/MDS and as a sensitivity analysis for defining a ‘clinical important difference’ on this PRO. 
2. Patients complete this questionnaire repeatedly at the same post baseline time points 
as the MDASI-AML/MDS.

8. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING
8.1. Requirements
The table below summarizes the requirements for recording safety events on the CRF and for 
reporting safety events on the Clinical Trial (CT) Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form to [COMPANY_007] Safety.  These requirements are delineated for 3 types of events: (1) SAEs; (2) non-serious adverse events (AEs); and (3) exposure to the investigational product under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and occupational exposure. CCI
PF-[ADDRESS_713212]-treatment follow up : 
All deaths, Grade 3/Grade [ADDRESS_713213] under study during 
pregnancy or breastfeeding, and 
occupational exposureAll (regardless of whether 
associated with an AE), except 
occupational exposureExposure during pregnancy, 
exposure via breastfeeding, 
occupational exposure (regardless 
of whether associated with an AE)
Note: Serious adverse events occurring to a patient after the active r eporting period has ended should be reported to the 
sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events that the investigator 
believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug are to be r eported to the sponsor.
a. In [LOCATION_013] only: All SAEs, regardless of causality, will be recorded on the CRF.
All observed or volunteered events regardless of treatment group or suspected causal 
relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported a s described in the following 
paragraphs.
Subjects must be followed for AEs for [ADDRESS_713214] resolved, whichever is later; or earlier than 28 days should the 
patient commence another anticancer therap y in the meantime.  For serious adverse events 
(SAEs), the active reporting period to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative begins from the 
time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s 
participation in the study , (ie, prior to undergoing any  study  related procedure and/or 
receiving investigational product), through and including [ADDRESS_713215].  Serious adverse events occurring t o a patient 
after the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the sponsor if the 
investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events that the 
investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility  of being rel ated to study  drug are 
to be reported to the sponsor.
The HSCT Post Remission P eriod (HSCT Period) is define das time from the start of 
the conditioning regimen until the subject restarts glasdegib or placebo, death, post 
study  follow up, or withdrawal. For subjects being treated with HSCT, subjects must 
be followed for AEs for at least 28days after the last investigational treatment 
administration prior to HSCT. Following HSCT Day 0, all deaths regardless of 
causality , Grade 3/Grade [ADDRESS_713216] period are to be reported to the sponsor. In German y 
only: All SAEs, regardless of causalit y, will be recorded on the CRF. 
PF-04449913
B1371019
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 12 April 2019 
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 108Once subjects resume glasdegib or placebo following HSCT, events summarized in 
Table 13will be reported. 
Events listed in the table above that require reporting to [COMPANY_007] Safet y on the CT SAE Report 
Form w ithin [ADDRESS_713217] be made immediately , irrespective of the extent of available 
event information.  This time frame also applies to additional new (follow -up) information on 
previously  forwarded reports.  I n the rare situation that the investigator does not become 
immediately  aware of the occurrence of an event, the investigator must report the event 
within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the 
event.
For each event, the investigator must p ursue and obtain adequate information both to 
determine the outcome and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE 
(see the Serious Adverse Events section below).  In addition, the investigator may  be 
requested b y [COMPANY_007] Safety to obtain specific follow -up information in an expedited fashion.  
This information is more detailed than that recorded on the CRF .  In general, this will include 
a description of the event in sufficient detail to allow for a comple te medical assessment of 
the case and independent determination of possible causalit y.  An y information relevant to 
the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses, must be provided.  I n the case of a 
subject death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible 
to [COMPANY_007] Safety .  An y pertinent additional information must be reported on the CT SAE
Report Form; additional source documents (eg, medical records, CRF, laboratory  data) are to 
be sent to [COMPANY_007] Safet y ONLY upon request.
As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted b y the sponsor, an y non -serious AE that is 
determined b y the sponsor to be serious will be reported by [CONTACT_74094].  To assist 
in the determination of case seriousness, further information may be requested from the 
investigator to provide clarity  and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical 
study .
8.1.1. Additional Details onRecording Adverse Events on the CRF
All events detailed in the table above will be recorded on the AE page (s) of the CRF.  I t 
should be noted that the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information is not the 
same as the AE page of the CRF.  When the same data are collected, the forms must be 
completed in a consistent manner.  AEs should be recorded using concise medical 
terminology  and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the CT SAE Report 
Form for reporting of SAE information.
8.1.2. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to record on the CRF all directly  observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously  
reported b y the subject.  In addition, each study  subject will be questioned about the 
occurrence of AEs in a non -leading manner.
PF-04449913
B1371019
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 12 April 2019 
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 1098.1.3. Withdrawal from the Study Due to Adverse Events (see also the Subject
Withdrawal Section)
Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, 
according to the definition of AE noted below, and recorded on the CRF. 
When a subject withdraws from the study  because of an SAE, the SAE must be recorded on 
the CRF a nd reported, as appropriate, on the CT SAE Report Form, in accordance with the 
Requirements section above.
8.1.4. Time Period for Collecting AE/SAE Information
The time period for actively  eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active c ollection 
period”) for each subject begins from the time the subject provides informed consent, which 
is obtained before the subject’s participation in the study  (ie, before undergoing any  
study -related procedure and/or receiving investigational product), through and including a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_713218] s who are screen failures, the active collection period ends when screen failure 
status is determined.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting SAEs to [COMPANY_007] Saf ety
All SAEs occurring in a subject during the active collection period are reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  on the CT SAE Report Form.
SAEs occurring in a subject after the active collection period has ended are reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  if the investigator beco mes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the 
investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility  of being related to investigational 
product must be reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety .
Follow up by  [CONTACT_74095] a level acceptable to the investigator, and 
[COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
If a subject begins a new anticancer therapy , SAEs occurring during the above -indicated 
active collection period must still be reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety  irrespective of any  intervening 
treatment.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Recording Non -serious AEs and SAEs on the CRF
During the active collection period, both non-serious AEs and SAEs are recorded on the 
CRF.
Follow -up by [CONTACT_47610] a level acceptable to the investigator, and [COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
PF-[ADDRESS_713219] begins a new anticancer therapy , the recording period for non- serious AE s ends at 
the time the new treatment is started; however, SAEs must continue to be recorded on the 
CRF during the above -indicated active collection period.
8.1.5. Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (seriou s and 
non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship on the CRF, and report such 
an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable.  An 
investigator’s causalit y assessment is the determination of whether the re exists a reasonable 
possibility  that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE; generall y the facts 
(evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided.  If the 
investigator does not know whether or not the inves tigational product caused the event, then 
the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as 
defined b y the sponsor.  If the investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not 
related” to investigational produ ct, this should be clearl y documented on study  records. 
In addition, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with study  procedures, 
the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, and 
report such an assessment in the dedicated section of the CT SAE Report Form and in 
accordance with the SAE reporting requirements.
8.1.6. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
AE reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be carried out 
in accordance with applicable local regulations.
8.2.Definitions
8.2.1. Adverse Events
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a study subject administered a product or 
medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment 
or usage.  Examples of AEs include, but are not limited to: 
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant signs and sy mptoms;
Changes in ph ysical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .

Final Protocol Amendment 5, 12 April 2019 
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 111Additionally , AEs may  includ e signs and s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse; 
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy  (EDP);
Exposure via breastfeeding;
Medication error;
Occupational exposure.
Worsening of signs and symptoms of th e malignancy  under study  should be recorded as AEs 
in the appropriate section of the CRF.  Disease progression assessed b y measurement of 
malignant lesions on radiographs or other methods should not be reported as AEs.
8.2.2. Abnormal Test Findings
Abnormal objec tive test findings should be recorded as AEs when any  of the following 
conditions are met: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; 
and/or
Test result leads to a change in stud y dosing (outside of an y protocol -specified dose 
adjustments) or discontinuation from the study , significant additional concomitant 
drug treatment, or other therap y; and/or
Test result is considered to b e an AE b y the investigator or sponsor.
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  An y abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require 
recording as an AE.
PF-[ADDRESS_713220] medical occurrence at any dose that:
•Results in death;
•Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death);
•Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
•Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions);
•Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Or that is considered to be:
•An important medical event.
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
Progression of the malignancy under study (including signs and symptoms of progression) 
should not be reported as an SAE unless the outcome is fatal within the active collection period.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4588].  If the malignancy has a fatal outcome during the study or within the active collection period, then the event leading to death must be recorded as an AE on the CRF, and as an SAE with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 5 (see the Severity Assessment section).

The investigator may  use the following definitions of Severit y in accordance with CTCAE 
Version 4.03 to describe the maximum intensity  of the adverse event :
GRADE Clinical Description of Severit y
0 No change from normal or reference range (This grade is not included in the 
Version 4.03 CTCAE document but may  be used in certain circumstances.)
1 MILD adverse event
2 MODERATE adverse event
3 SEVERE ad verse event
4 LIFE -THREATENING consequences; urgent intervention indicated
5 DEATH RELATED TO adverse event
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily  an SAE.  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes significantly with 
the subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for SAEs, listed above.
8.4.Special Situations
8.4.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events
All cases of Grade >[ADDRESS_713221] dose of study  drug 
administered. All SAEs will be reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety  by [CONTACT_545145], and will be handled as SAEs in the safet y database .
8.4.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury
Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury  (as determined by  [CONTACT_20023]) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transien t liver injury , but adapt 
are termed “adaptors.”  In some subject s, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a more 
serious potential outcome.  These subject s fail to adapt and therefore are "susceptible" to 
progressive and serious liver injury , commonly referred to as drug -induced liver injury  
(DILI).  Subjects who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 times the upper limit of 
normal ( ×ULN) should be monitored more frequently  to determine if they are an “adaptor” 
or are “susceptible.”

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 115In the major ity of DILI cases, elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) precede total bilirubin (TBili) elevations (>2 ×ULN) by  [CONTACT_74097].  The increase in TBili ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y occurs while AST/ALT is/are still eleva ted 
above 3 ×ULN (ie, AST/AL T and TBili values will be elevated within the same lab sample).  
In rare instances, b y the time TBili elevations are detected, AST/ALT values might have 
decreased.  This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI.  There fore, abnormal 
elevations in either AST OR AL T in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below 
are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy ’s law criteria) cases and should alway s be 
considered important medical events, even before all other p ossible causes of liver injury  
have been excluded.
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the subject’s 
individual baseline values and underl ying conditions.  Subjects who present with the 
following laboratory  abnorm alities should be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy ’s law) 
cases to definitivel y determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory  values:
Subjects with AST/AL T and TBili baseline values within the normal range who 
subsequently  present with AST OR AL T values >3 ×ULN AND a TBili value 
>2× ULN with no evidence of hemol ysis and an alkaline phosphatase value 
<2×ULN or not available;
For subjects with baseline AST OR ALT ORTBili values above the ULN, the 
following threshold values are used in the defi nition mentioned above, as needed, 
depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline:
Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT 
values >2 times the baseline values AND >3 ×ULN; or >8 ×ULN (whichever is 
smaller) ;
Preexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from 
baseline value b y an amount of at least 1 × ULN orif the value reaches 
>3 × ULN (whichever is smaller).
Rises in AST/AL T and TBili separated b y more than a few weeks should be assessed 
individually  based on clinical judgment; any  case where uncertainty  remains as to whether it 
represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor. 
The subject should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results.  This evaluation should 
include laboratory  tests, detailed history , and physical assessment.  T he possibility  of hepatic 
neoplasia (primary  or secondary ) should be considered.
In add ition to repeating measurements of AST and AL T and TBili, laboratory  tests should 
include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutam yl 
transferase (GGT), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), total bile
acids, alkaline phosphatase and acetaminophen drug and/or protein adduct levels.  
Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an 
PF-04449913

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 116anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneou s 
analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology .  A detailed 
history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (either b y 
itself or as a coformulated product in prescription or over -the-counter medications) , 
recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family  history , sexual history , 
travel history , history  of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, surgery , blood transfusion, history  
of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be 
collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging 
(eg, biliary  tract) may  be warranted. 
All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria of A ST/AL T and 
TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy ’s law) cases if no 
other reason for the LFT abnormalities has yet been found.  Such potential DILI (Hy’s law) 
cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availability of all the results of the 
investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT abnormalities.
A potential DILI (Hy ’s law) case becomes a confirmed case onl y after all results of 
reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternat ive etiology .
8.4.3. Exposure to the Investigational Product During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and 
Occupational Exposure
Exposure to the investigational product under study  during pregnancy  or breastfeeding and 
occupational exposure are reportable to [COMPANY_007] Safe ty within 24 hours of investigator 
awareness.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during 
pregnancy  (EDP) occurs if:
A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational 
product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or 
being exposed to the investigational product;
An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact 
[CONTACT_4490] a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant 
and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exp osure) to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed 
during his partner’s pregnancy . 
If a subject or subject ’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the subject ’s 
treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must report this information to 
[COMPANY_007] Safety  on the CT SAE Report Form and an EDP supplemental form, regardless of 
whether an SAE has occurred.  In addition, the investigator must submit information 
PF-[ADDRESS_713222] in a pregnant woman (eg, a subject 
reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product by [CONTACT_31061][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) to [COMPANY_007] Safety  using the EDP supplemental form.  This must be done irrespective 
of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.  The 
information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see below for 
information related to termination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  [COMPANY_007] Safet y of the outcome as a 
follow -up to the initial EDP supplemen tal form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural 
integrit y of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the 
reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically  possible, the structural 
integrit y ofthe terminated fetus should be assessed by  [CONTACT_4692] (unless 
pre-procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are 
reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregn ancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live-born bab y, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are reported to [COMPANY_007] Safet y as SAEs 
follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;
Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_713223].
Additional information regarding the EDP may  be requested by  [CONTACT_456].  Further 
follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on 
preterm infants to identify developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal exposure, the 
investigator will provide the subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form 
to deliver to his partner.  The investigator must document in the source documents that the 
subject was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his 
partner.
PF-[ADDRESS_713224] be reported, irrespective of the presence of 
an associated SAE, to [COMPANY_007] Safet y within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the 
CT SAE Report Form.  An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a [COMPANY_007] 
drug specifically  approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in 
accord with authorized use.  However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such 
a drug’s administration, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898], which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE.
An occupational exposure is reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety  within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form, regardless of whether there is an associated 
SAE.  Since the informa tion does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study , the 
information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy  of the completed CT SAE Report 
Form is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.4.4. Medication Errors 
Other exposures to the investigational p roduct under study  may  occur in clinical trial settings, 
such as medication errors.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Medication Errors
Medication errors may  result from the administration or consumption of the investigational 
product b y the wrong subject, or at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength. 
Medication error s include :
Medication errors involving subject exposure to the investigational product;
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating subject.

Medication errors will NOT include:
Cases where commercial bac kbone drug was used instead of supplied stock;
Cases where the wrong lot number of drug was dispensed ;
Dose modifications outlined in Section 5.5.5 .
In the event of a medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified immediately .
Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by  [CONTACT_1149], as determined by  [CONTACT_1275], the medication error is recorded on the medication error page of the CRF and, if 
applicable, an y associated AE(s), serious and non -serious, are recorded on an AE page of the 
CRF.
Medication errors should be reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety within [ADDRESS_713226] SAE Report 
Form only when associated with an SAE .
9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS
Detailed methodology  for sum mary  and statistical anal yses of the data collected in this study  
is outlined here and further detailed in a s tatistical analysis plan(SAP) , which will be 
maintained by  [CONTACT_456].  The SAP may modify  what is outlined in the protocol where 
appropriate ; however, any  major modifications of the primary  endpoint definition s or their 
analyses will also be reflected in a protocol amendment.
9.1.Sample Size Determination
For the intensive chemotherapy population, a total of 267 death events will be required to 
provi de 90% power to detect an HR=0.67 ( translating in median OS of 31.[ADDRESS_713227] s: young intensive

efficacy  and futility  is planned when 70% of death events have occurred or upon completion 
of enrollment of intensive chemotherapy subject s, whichever is later.  An O’Brien- Fleming 
boundary  with Lan -DeMets spending function will be used for effic acy and a Rho(3) 
-spending function will be used for the non -binding futility  boundary .  Assuming a 
PF-[ADDRESS_713229] intensive chemotherapy subjects with a total of 400 intensive chemotherapy subjects using a 1:[ADDRESS_713230] enrollment and drop-out rates. 
For the non-intensive chemotherapy population, a total of 220 death events will be required 
to provide 90% power to detect an HR=0.64 (translating in median OS of 16.[ADDRESS_713231] at a significance level of 0.025 and a 2-look group 
sequential design.  An interim analysis for efficacy and futility is planned when 60% of death events have occurred or upon completion of enrollment of non-intensive chemotherapy subjects, whichever is later. An O’Brien-Fleming boundary with Lan-DeMets spending 
function will be used for efficacy and a Rho(3) β-spending function will be used for the 
non-binding futility boundary.  Assuming a 10-month ramp-up of subject enrollment up to 18 subjects per month then plateauing at that level and expecting approximately 31% of all enrolled subjects to be censored, the desired number of death events will accrue within [ADDRESS_713232] non-intensive chemotherapy subjects with a total of 320 non-intensive chemotherapy subjects using a 1:[ADDRESS_713233] enrollment and drop-out rates. 
9.2. Analysis Population
The primary, secondary,  analyses of intensive and non-intensive 
chemotherapy subjects will be conducted separately and independently of each other.
9.2.1. Full Analysis Set
The Full Analysis set (FAS) will include all randomized subjects.  Subjects will be classified 
according to the treatment assigned at randomization.
9.2.2. Safety Analysis Set
The safety analysis set will include all subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug.  
Subjects will be classified according to the treatment assigned at randomization unless the incorrect treatment(s) was/were received throughout the dosing period in which case subjects will be classified according to the first study treatment received.
9.2.3. PK Analysis Set
The PK concentration analysis set is defined as all subjects who are treated and who have at 
least [ADDRESS_713234] (stratified by [CONTACT_545146], ≤60 vs 
>60 years, and region [rest of world {ROW} vs China]) will be used at the interim and final analyses with the overall significance level preserved at 1-sided ≤0.025.  The rate of stem 
cell transplantation is expected to be much lower for sites in China versus the ROW thus 
region is being added as a stratification factor in the primary analysis. Should 
over-stratification prevent model convergence or there exists large imbalance in the distribution (eg, 90% or more subjects from one strata level), the intermediate and poor cytogenetic risk groups may be pooled in the analysis.  OS time associated with each treatment arm will be summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method and displayed graphically where appropriate CIs for the 25
th, 50th(median), and 75thpercentiles of OS will be reported 
using Brookmeyer and Crowley method.45In addition, the median OS and its two-sided 
95% CI using the same method will be provided for each stratum within each treatment arm separately.  The Cox proportional hazards model will be fitted to compute the treatment HR and the corresponding 95% CI.  The HR and its two-sided 95% CI will be provided for each stratum as well.  Additional covariates may be added in the Cox proportional hazard model to explore the potential influence of other baseline factors on OS (including but not limited to age, race, gender, and secondary AML).  
 
The Schoenfeld residuals for the 
stratified Cox PH regression model will be plotted to investigate graphically violations from the PH assumption; a non-zero slope is evidence of departure from PH.  The PH assumption will be formally tested using Schoenfeld’s residual test.  Large departures from PH will be evidenced by a p-value <0.05.  
 
 
For the non-intensive chemotherapy population, the primary analysis of OS will be 
performed based on the FAS when about [ADDRESS_713235] (stratified by [CONTACT_545147] <75 vs ≥75 years) will be used at the interim and final analyses with the overall 
significance level preserved at 1-sided ≤0.025.  The rate of stem cell transplantation is 
expected to be low in all regions in the non-intensive study.  Should over-stratification CCI

9.3.2. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
All secondary PRO and efficacy endpoints will be based on the FAS unless stated otherwise.
Fatigue 
The key secondary PRO endpoint based on the Fatigue single-item from the 
MDASI-AML/MDS questionnaire will be analyzed for proportion of responders (defined below) at week 12 for non-intensive patients and week 8 for intensive chemotherapy patients. The proportion of responders will be estimated with a 2-sided 95% CI (using normal approximation). The proportion and 2-sided 95% CI (using exact method) of responders for each stratum will also be provided. A hierarchical testing procedure will be followed, namely, a formal testing of proportion of responders (using a 1-sided Cochran Mantel Haenszel [CMH] test, stratified by [CONTACT_545146], age [age ≤60 vs >60 years for the 
intensive patients, and age <75 vs ≥75 years for the non-intensive patients]), and region 
[ROW vs China for intensive patients only]) will only be conducted in one population if the primary OS endpoint is met in that population (intensive or non-intensive treatment).  The risk ratio and 2-sided 95% CI will also be summarized.CCI

CRi.  CR (including CR MRD-neg) is a deeper response than CRh (if applicable), and CRh (if 
applicable) is a deeper response than CRi.
The proportion of subjec ts achieving each endpoint will be estimated with 2- sided 95% CI 
(using the normal approximation) respectivel y.The proportion and 2- sided 95% CI  of 
subject s achieving each of the endpoint for each stratum will also be provided. The 
proportion of subject s achieving each endpoint will be compared between the treatment arms 
using a [ADDRESS_713237] (stratified as described in Section 9.3.1 )and an 
unstratified chi -square test.
Duration of Response
For the Intensive chemotherap y subjects, Duration of Response (DoR i) isonly defined for 
subject s who have ever achieved CRi or better on study  as the time from date of first 
achieving CRi or better to the date of disease progression, or rel apse after CRior better, or 
death due to an y cause.  Subjects last known to be alive who are free from disease 
progression or relapse after CRior better are censored at the date of last disease assessment 
that verifies their status.   Note that CRi or better includes CR and CRi for the intensive 
chemotherap y subjects.   
Fornon-Intensive chemotherap y subjects, DoR iis only  defined for subject s who have ever 
achieved CRi or better on study  as the time from date of first achieving CRi or better to the 
date of disease progression, or relapse after CRi or better , or death due to any  cause. We also 
define DoR hfor subjects who have ever achieved CRh or better on study  as the time from 
date of first achieving CRh or better to the date of disease progression, or relapse after CRh
or better , or death due to any  cause . Note that CRi or better includes CR, CRh, and CRi for 
the non- intensive chemotherap y subjects. CRh or better includes onl y CR and CRh for the 
same subjects.

between treatment arms.  DoRi/DoRh will be analyzed and displayed graphically for each arm separately using the Kaplan-Meier method.  The median DoRi/DoRh for each treatment arm and corresponding two-sided 95% CI will be provided. 
Time to Response (Non-Intensive Study only)
Time to Response (TTRi) is only defined for subjects who have ever achieved CRi or better 
on study as the time from date of randomization to date of first achieving CRi or better.  Similarly, TTRh is only defined for subjects who have ever achieved CRh or better on study as the time from date of randomization to date of first achieving CRh or better. 
As TTRi/TTRh are not defined for all subjects, no formal statistical comparison will be made 
between treatment arms.  The minimum, median, and maximum TTRi/TTRh for each treatment arm will be provided. 
Event Free Survival
Intensive Study
For the Intensive chemotherapy patients, EFS is defined as the time from the date of 
randomization to the date of treatment failure (TF), relapse from CR, or death from any cause, whichever comes first. TF is defined as failure to achieve CR during the induction cycle (including the re-induction cycle if there is one) and the event date for TF is the day of randomization. Responders last known to be alive who are free from disease progression or relapse are censored at the date of last disease assessment that verifies their status.

Should over-stratification prevent model convergence or there exists large imbalance in the distribution (eg, 90% or more subjects from one strata level), the intermediate and poor cytogenetic risk groups may be pooled in the analysis.  EFS time associated with each treatment arm will be summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method and displayed graphically where appropriate CIs for the 25

Crowley method).44  In addition, the median EFS and its two-sided 95% CI using the 
Brookmeyer and Crowley method45will be provided for each stratum within each treatment 
arm separately.  The Cox proportional hazards model will be fitted to compute the treatment HR and the corresponding 95% CI.  The HR and its two-sided 95% CI will be provided for each stratum as well. 
Patient Reported Outcomes
Analysis of patient-reported outcomes will be based on the MDASI-AML/MDS, EQ-5D-5L, 
PGIS, PGIC,  
 
 For MDASI-AML/MDS and EQ-5D-5L, a 
completion table will be constructed showing the number and percentage of subjects at each time point for each treatment group by [CONTACT_545148]. Analysis of MDASI-AML/MDS and EQ-5D-5L will be based on their respective subscales as defined in the guidance document for each of these instruments.
Particularly, although fatigue is the most commonly experienced symptom among AML 
patients, other symptoms also may be relevant for patients.  Accordingly, analysis of MDASI-AML/MDS will be based on the core cancer symptom score, the AML/MDS-specific symptom score, the interference areas score, and also the 5 individual items of fatigue, disturbed sleep, dry mouth, muscle weakness, and lack of appetite.  Note that Fatigue also appears earlier in Section 9.3.2 (as a key secondary endpoint) using a 
responder analysis. 
A display of descriptive statistics including means, medians, standard deviations, and 
95% confidence intervals at each assessment point will be provided. This will be done based on the observed values as well as on change from baseline values.  Statistical comparison of the 2 treatment groups will be based on a longitudinal repeated measures mixed effects model using baseline as a covariate.C

For intensive and non-intensive studies, the plasma trough concentration (C trough) will be 
reported for glasdegib (and metabolite, if relevant). Descriptive statistics will be provided for these PK parameters in tabular form (n, mean, standard deviation (Stdev), CV, median, minimum, maximum, geometric mean and its associated CV) by [CONTACT_5265] (or induction 1,2) and day.
PK Concentrations:
For drug concentrations, individual values and descriptive statistics (n, mean, Stdev, CV, 
median, minimum, maximum, geometric mean and its associated CV) will be presented by 
[CONTACT_5265] (or induction 1, 2), day of assessment, and nominal time in tabular form. 
Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis or PK/PDx Modeling
PK and pharmacodynamics (PDx) data from this study may be analyzed using modeling 
approaches and may also be pooled with data from other studies to investigate any causal relationship between study treatment exposure and biomarkers or significant safety endpoints.  The results of these analyses, if performed, may be reported separately.

9.5.1. Adverse Events
All subjects who receive any study treatment (safety analysis set) will be included in the 
summaries and listings of safety data.  Overall safety profile and tolerability of the glasdegib + other study treatment and the placebo + other study treatment arm will be characterized by [CONTACT_24975], frequency, severity, timing, and relationship to study therapy of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities.
Adverse events will be classified using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) classification system.  The severity of the toxicities will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE version 4.03. 
In all summaries, emphasis will be placed on treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs).  
Adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_545149] (version 4.03) grade.  Summaries will also be provided of treatment related TEAEs, namely, those judged by [CONTACT_545150]. 
Adverse events leading to death or discontinuation of study treatment, events classified as 
NCI CTCAE version 4.[ADDRESS_713239] toxicity grade observed for each lab assay ,graded according 
to NCI  CTCAE version 4.03.  The anal yses will summarize laboratory  tests both on the 
entire study  period and by  [CONTACT_545151]/or Induction (Cycle 1 and C ycles beyond 1 or 
Inducti on 1,2).  Shift tables will be provided to examine the distribut ion of laboratory  
toxicities.
For laboratory  tests without CTC grade definitions, results will be categorized as normal, 
abnormal or not done . 
9.5.3. Baseline Characteristics
Subject characteristics at the time of study  entry  will be summarized in frequency  tables and 
descriptive statistics will be provided for quantitative variables for the full analy sis set (see
Section 9.2.1 for definitions of study  populations).  I mbalances in subject characteristics in 
the treated populations will be assessed.
9.5.4. Electrocardiogram Analysis
The QT measurements corrected b y heart rate (QTc) will be used for the data anal ysis and 
interpretation.  QTcF is planned to be the primary  anal ysis method for the QTc endpoint.  In 
addition a study -specific correction method (QTcS) and QTcB may  also be evaluated for the 
QTc evaluable subject s.  The most appropriate correction method that eliminates any  QT vs. 
RR relationship may  be chosen after review of the data.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Summary and Categori cal Analysis of Electrocardiogram Findings
The anal ysis of ECG results will be based on subject s with both baseline and on -treatment 
ECG data.  All ECGs obtained during the study  will be evaluated for safet y.  ECG collected 
prior to the first day  of dosing will be considered the baseline ECG.
ECG measurements (an average of the triplicate measurements) will be used for the 
statistical analysis and all data presentations.  Any  data obtained from ECGs repeated for 
safet y reasons after the nominal time-points will not be averaged along with the preceding 
triplicates.  Interval measurements from repeated ECGs will be included in the outlier 
analysis as individual values obtained at unscheduled time points.
Data will be summarized and listed for QT, HR, RR, PR, Q RS, QTcF and QTcB.  Individual 
QTc (all evaluated corrections) intervals will be listed by  [CONTACT_5586].  The most appropriate 
correction factor will be selected and used for the following analy ses of central tendency  and 
outliers and used for the study  conclusions.
Descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) will be 
used to summarize the absolute QTc value and changes from baseline in QTc after treatment, 
and by  [CONTACT_12268].  Foreach subject by [CONTACT_545152] -baseline value across time -points.  
Outlier anal ysis of the QTc data will be conducted and summarized as follows:

9.6.Interim Analyse s 
The interim anal yses will be performed based on the FAS for the intensive and non -intensive 
chemotherap y population separately and independently of each other.
For the intensive chemotherap y population, two interim anal yses are planned.  One efficacy  
and futility  interim anal ysis is planned when 50% of death events have occurred in the 
intensive che motherapy  population.  However, no efficacy  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_545103] .  A second interim analy sis of efficacy  and futility  is 
planned when 70% of death events have occurred or upon completion of enrollment of the 
intensive chemotherap y population, whichever is later.  An O’Brien -Fleming boundary  with 
Lan-DeMets spending function will be used for efficacy  and a Rho(3) -spending function 
will be used for the non -binding futility  boundary.  If exactly  50% of the events is accrued at 
the first interim anal ysis, the futility  boundary  will be crossed when 1 -sided p>0.461.  If 
exactly  70% of the events is accrued at the second interim analy sis, the futility  boundary  will 
be crossed when 1 -sided p>0.186 and the efficac y boundary  will be crossed when 1 -sided 
p<0.007.  If the actual number of events at the interim analy ses is different, the 
corresponding spending function will be used to calculate the actual stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_74239]. 
For the non -intensive chemotherapy  populat ion, one interim anal ysis is planned.  An interim 
analysis of efficacy  and futility  is planned when 60% of death events have occurred or upon 
completion of enrollment of the non -intensive chemotherapy  population, whichever is later.  
An O’Brien -Fleming bou ndary  with Lan-DeMets spending function will be used for efficacy  
and a Rho(3)  -spending function will be used for the non -binding futility  boundary .  If

Page 1319.7.Data Mo nitoring Committee 
This study  will use an external data monitoring committee (E- DMC). The study  team will 
remain blinded. An unblinded reporting team (separate from the study  team) will work with 
E-DMC for the on- going monitoring.
The E- DMC will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the safet y of subject s in the study  
according to the charter.  The recommendations made b y the E -DMC to alter the conduct of 
the study  will be forwarded to [COMPANY_007] for final decision.  [COMPANY_007] will forward such decisions, 
which may  include summaries of aggregate analy ses of endpoint events and of safet y data
that are not endpoints , to regulatory  authorities, as appropriate.  An E-DMC will be convened 
to monitor safety  in the study  at least once yearly.  The E -DMC will also evaluate the results 
of all interim anal yses.
10.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
[COMPANY_007] or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits during stud y conduct to ensure that 
the protocol and Good Clinical Practices ( GCPs) are being followed.  The moni tors may  
review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs areaccurate.  The 
investigator and institution will allow [COMPANY_007] monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate 
regulatory  authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.   This 
verification may  also occur after study  completion.
During stud y conduct and/or after stud y completion, t he investigator site may  be subject to 
review b y the IRB/EC , and/or to quality  assurance audits performed by  [CONTACT_4618], or compa nies 
working with or on behalf of [COMPANY_007], and/or to inspection by  [CONTACT_8901].
The investigator(s) will notify  [COMPANY_007] or its agents immediately  of any  regulatory  inspection 
notification in relation to the study .Furthermore, the inv estigator will cooperate with [COMPANY_007] 
or its agents to prepare the investigator site for the inspection and will allow [COMPANY_007] or its 
agent, whenever feasible, to be present during the inspection.  The investigator site and 
investigator will promptly resolve any discrepancies that are identified between the stud y 
data and the subject's medical records.  The investigator will promptl y provide copi[INVESTIGATOR_74040].  Before response submission to the regulatory 
authorities, th e investigator will provide [COMPANY_007] or its agents with an opportunity  to review 
and comment on responses to any  such findings.
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.
PF-[ADDRESS_713240] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic dat a record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject .  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole propert y of [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from [COMPANY_007].
The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y, and laborat ory data entered on the CRFs and any  other data collection forms (source 
documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring, and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed b y the investigator or b y an authorized staff member to attest that the 
data contained on the CRFs are true.  An y corrections to entries made in the CRFs or source 
documents must be dated, initialed, and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the 
original entry . 
In most cases, the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110258]’s subject chart.  In these 
cases, data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF may also serve as the sourc e document.  In these cases, a document 
should be available at the investigator site and at [COMPANY_007] that clearl y identifies those data that 
will be recorded on the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the source document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable eval uations and/or inspections/audits from regulatory  authorities or [COMPANY_007], the 
investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity  of all participating subjects 
(sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original sig ned 
informed consent documents, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safet y reporting forms, source documents, 
and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, and telephone call reports).  The records should 
be retained b y the investigator according to the ICH guidelines, according to local 
regulations, or as specified in the clinical study agreement (CSA), whichever is longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period (eg, retirement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007], such as another 
investigator, another institution, or an indepen dent third party  arranged by  [CONTACT_4618]. 
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of [ADDRESS_713241] obtain [COMPANY_007]'s written pe rmission before disposing of an y records, 
even if retention requirements have been met.
12.ETHICS
12.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB) /Ethics Committee (EC)
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, eg, 
recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the I RB/EC.  All correspondence with the 
IRB/EC should be retained in the investigator file.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] I RB/EC approvals should be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_007].
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/EC and Pf izer in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, legal and regulatory  
requirements and the general principles set forth in the I nternational Ethical Guidelines f or 
Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of

Helsinki.
12.3. Subject Information and Consent
All parties will ensure protectio n of subject personal data and will not include subject names 
or other identifiable data in any  reports, publications, or other disclosures, except where 
required b y law. 
When study  data are compi[INVESTIGATOR_47581], subject
names, addresses, and other identifiable data will be replaced b y numerical codes based on a 
numbering s ystem provided by  [CONTACT_47617] -identify  study  subject s.  The investigator 
site will maintain a confidential list of subject s who participated in the study , linking each 
subject ’s numerical code to his or her actual identity.  In case of data transfer, [COMPANY_007] will 
maintain high standards of confidentialit y and protection of subject s’ personal data consistent 
with applicable privacy  laws.
Theinformed consent documents and any  subject recruitment materials must be in 
compliance with ICH Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ), local regulatory  requirements, and legal 
requirements, including applicable privacy  laws.
The informed consent documents used dur ing the informed consent process and any  subject
recruitment materials must be reviewed and approved by  [CONTACT_4618], approved by  [CONTACT_1201]/EC
before use, and available for inspection.

12.4. Reporting of Safety Issues and S erious B reaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP
In the event of an y prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) b y an applicable 
regulatory  authorit y in any area of the world, or if the investigator is aware of an y new 
information that might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the investigational 
product, [COMPANY_007] should be informed immediately. 
In addition, the investigator will inform [COMPANY_007] immediately  of any  urgent safet y measures 
taken b y the investigator to protect the study subjects against an y immediate hazard, and of 
any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of.
13.DEFINITION OF END OF TR IAL
13.1. End of Trial in All Participating Countries 
End of Study  in all other participating countries is defined as Last Subject Last Visit.
14.SPONSOR DISCONTINUAT ION CRITERIA
Premature termination of this study  may  occur because of a regula tory authority  decision, 
change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_1100]/EC, or investigational product safety  problems, or at the 
discretion of [COMPANY_007].  In addition, [COMPANY_007] retains the right to discontinue development of 
glasdegib at an y time.
If a stud y is prematurel y terminated, [COMPANY_007] will promptly  notify  the investigator.  After 
notification, the investigator must contact [CONTACT_76626][INVESTIGATOR_4601]  
(if applicable) within [ADDRESS_713243] extent possible.
After the end of the trial, the continuation of treatment; such as in an extension study , for 
those patients who are still receiving benefit in the non- intensive study  may be decided based 
upon availability  of alternative treatment options.  An extension study  would not be 
available for patients who receive HSCT within the non -intensive study . Non-intensive 
study  subjects who receive HSCT would continue blinded therap y for up to [ADDRESS_713244] -negative 
disease at 2 consecutive timepoints; whichever comes first.

Response criteria for clinical trials
Stable Disease (SD)  Absence of CRMRD -, CR, CRh (if applicable), CRi, PR, MLFS, and criteria for PD not met.
 Period of stable disease should be at least 3 months in the non-intensive only. The 3 month criteria does not apply to the intensive study.
Progressive Disease 
(PD) Evidence for an increase in bone marrow blast percentage and/or increase of absolute blast counts in blood:
 >50% increase over baseline (a minimum 15% point increase in cases with <30% blasts at baseline); or persistent marrow blast percentage of 
>70% over at least 3 months; without at least a 100% improvement in ANC to an absolute level (>0.5x109/L [500/µL], and/or platelet count to 
>50x109/L [50 000/µL] non -transfused) ;OR
 >50% increase in peripheral blasts (WBC x %blasts) to >25x109/L (>25 000/µL) OR New extramedullary disease.
Indeterminate A response that does not fit the criteria for SD or PD. For example, when peripheral blood blast count assessed and no bone marrow assessment, or 
when a technical issue prevents the ability to make a response as sessment (ie dry tap or insufficient sample), or when an SD is not maintained for

the [COMPANY_007] -provided Good Clinical Practice training course (“[COMPANY_007] GCP Training”) or 
training deemed equivalent by  [CONTACT_4618].  An y investigators who later join the study will 
complete the [COMPANY_007] GCP Training or equivalent before performing study-related duties.  For 
studies of applicable duration, the investigator and sub-investigators will complete [COMPANY_007] 
GCP Training or equivale nt every  three y ears during the term of the s tudy, or more often if 
there are significant changes to the ICH GCP guidelines or course materials.
2.Investigational Product .
No subjects or third -party  payers will be charged for investigational product.
3.Inspect ions.
The investigator(s) will notify  [COMPANY_007] or its service provider immediatel y of any regulatory 
inspection notification in relation to the study . Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate 
with [COMPANY_007] or its service provider to prepare the study  site for the inspection and will allow

SPECIFIC AIMS  
Concisely state the objectives of the study and the hypothesis being tested.  
Part A (pattern of upper airway muscle activity and NED)  
 
We hypothesize that upper airway mechanoreceptor reflexes may protect against NED. 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_94797] e phasic genioglossus activity. Thus, 
we also hypothesize that patients with Starling Resistor type behavior (constant inspi[INVESTIGATOR_94798] a range of driving pressures) will develop NED once the reflexes have been impaired with 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_15413]. We pla n to: 
1. measure upper airway muscle EMG to assess how it corresponds to the 
presence or absence of NED.  This aim will allow us to test the hypothesis that 
robust upper airway muscle reflexes can protect against NED.  
2. reduce upper airway muscle activity and r eflexes by [CONTACT_12523][INVESTIGATOR_94799]. This will allow us to test the hypothesis that attenuated upper 
airway muscle activity induced by [CONTACT_12523][INVESTIGATOR_94800].  
 
Part B (upper airway endoscopy during flow limitation)  
 
This part of the protocol has 3 separate steps: 1) Pharyngometry during wakefulless, 2) CPAP 
during sleep to induce flow limitation  and 3) oral devices (oral appliance and oral pressure 
therapy) to observe their effect on negative effort dependence  and pharyngeal collapsibility .  
 
Pharyngometry during wakefullness:  We will use a pharyngometer to estimate pharyngeal length 
and cross -sectional area.  
CPAP to induce flow limitation:  We will induce inspi[INVESTIGATOR_94801] [ADDRESS_104925] area and pressure.  
 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  June 1, [ADDRESS_104926] on negative effort dependence  and pharyngeal collapsibility : Subjects 
will use either an oral appliance (the subject’s own oral appliance that is being used at home to 
treat obstructive sleep apnea ) or a temporary device provided for the duration of the study  or an 
oral pressure therapy device that we will provide.   
 
The following hypothesis will be tested:  
Aim 1:  We aim to test the wave -speed theory for inspi[INVESTIGATOR_94802]. We hypothesize that this flow limiting mechanism can explain inspi[INVESTIGATOR_94803]. On the other hand, we hypothesize that downstream pressure 
propagates upstream past the choke point when negati ve effort dependence can be 
observed, what is not expected by [CONTACT_94865].  
 
Aim 2:  We aim to t est the influences of lung volume and low ventilatory drive on 
progressive expi[INVESTIGATOR_94804] (PEN). Pharyngeal cross -sectional area using 
endoscopy w ill be measured simultaneously with lung volume (magnetometers), 
genioglossus EMG, pharyngeal pressure, and end -tidal CO2 during [ADDRESS_104927].  
 
Aim 3:  We aim to test the effect of oral appliance and oral pressure therapy on the 
pharyngeal  cross -sectional  area and collaps ibility  during sleep . We hypothesize that the 
both oral appliance and oral pressure therapy stabilize the soft palate and tongue and 
decrease negative effort dependence and improve collapsibility . 
 
Aim 4: We aim to test the correlation between the primary structure of collapse with the 
change in pharyngeal collapsibility with O ral Appliance (OA)  therapy.  We hypothsize 
that non -PAP therapi[INVESTIGATOR_94805] -specific and will function 
optimally when correctly matched to the primary structure causing collapse, and have a 
finite scope to improve upper airway anatomy and  will be most effective in patients 
without severe pharyngeal collapsibility . 
 
Part E (expi[INVESTIGATOR_94806])  
 
 Test of the influences of added expi[INVESTIGATOR_94807]. 
Recent research indicates that expi[INVESTIGATOR_94808] (prolapse) during expi[INVESTIGATOR_94809]. This can lead to a pattern of 
progressive expi[INVESTIGATOR_94810]. Theoretically, applying an added expi[INVESTIGATOR_94811] a pressure gradient opposing soft palate prolapse may prevent this behavior.  
Thus, we will test whether  expi[INVESTIGATOR_94812] F (oral breathing)  
 
 Test the effect of added a single -use Varnum mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_94813]. Research indicates that 
nasal breathing not only may improve sleep apnea but it also increases cir culation, blood oxygen, 
and carbon dioxide levels, slows the breathing rate, and improves overall lung volumes (23) .

BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
Provide a brief paragraph summarizing prior experience importan t for understanding the 
proposed study and procedures. 
 
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by [CONTACT_94866]. However, OSA remains 
undertreated due in part t o the few treatment options available. Thus, understanding the 
pathophysiology of sleep apnea and developi[INVESTIGATOR_94815].  
The mechanisms of recurrent upper airway collapse in OSA remain incompletely understood. 
Airflow lim itation, negative effort dependence and progressive expi[INVESTIGATOR_696] n arrowing (defined 
below) are important characteristics  of the upper airway associated with pharyngeal collapse that 
need further understanding.  
Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_94816] a lack of increase in flow despi[INVESTIGATOR_94817]. This phenomenon can be easily observed during polysomnography as a 
flattening of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_94818] , which are defini ng 
events of OSA.  The mechanism of flow limitation in the upper airway is not known.  Several 
models and theories have been proposed to explain why flow limitation occurs. The Starling 
Resistor model is frequently used to assess pharyngeal mechanics and de fines a constant airflow 
over a range of driving pressures. The wave -speed theory was proposed by [CONTACT_94867] a compliant tube could not exceed the lowest flow at which the air speed  
equaled the tube’s “ wave speed ”. The wave s peed of a tube is the speed that a pressure pulse 
travels longitudinally along (and within) the wall of the tube.  Flow limitation at wave speed 
depends on gas density, airway cross -sectional area,  and airway compliance. Another flow 
limiting mechanism, vi scous flow limitation, has been proposed to explain flow limita tion in 
tubes of smaller areas.  This mechanism of flow limitation results from the coupling between 
dissipative pressure losses (dependent on viscosity) and tube compliance. Since the wave -speed 
and viscous flow mechanisms have not been tested as flow limiting mechanisms of the human 
pharynx, we intend to test both these theories.  
Classic Starling Resistor models suggest constant flow through a collapsible tube over a 
range of driving pressures . However, NED or negative effort dependence is a well recognized 
phenomenon whereby [CONTACT_94868][INVESTIGATOR_21266].  The 
mechanisms underlying NED in the human upper airway remain unclear. On the other hand, the 
upper airway  muscle dilators are modulated by [CONTACT_94869]. This reflex may compensate the 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_94819]. Moreover, muscle recruitment coul d 
potentially mitigate NED. Conversely, topi[INVESTIGATOR_94820].  We intend to evaluate the pattern of upper a irway muscle activity 
and the development of NED on flow limited breaths in OSA patients during sleep. We 
hypothesize that upper airway mechanoreceptor reflexes may protect against NED. In addition, 
we also hypothesize that patients with Starling Resistor type behavior (constant inspi[INVESTIGATOR_94821]: Protocol Summary  
Version Date:  June 1, 2005     4  over a range of driving pressures) will develop NED once the reflexes have been impaired with 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_94822].  
A number of studies have shown that, in OSA, there is progressive narrowing of the pharyngeal 
airway across breaths during expi[INVESTIGATOR_94823]. The mechanism of this 
progressive expi[INVESTIGATOR_94804] (PEN) is not known, but potential c auses include: falling lung 
volume in the breaths preceding an apnea (“lung volume hypothesis”); decreasing ventilatory 
drive following an arousal with ventilatory overshoot (“low drive hypothesis”); insufficient time 
for the airway to expand during expi[INVESTIGATOR_51520] (“expansion time hypothesis”); re -expansion on 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_94824] (“hysteresis 
hypothesis”); slow narrowing due to viscoelastic properties of the airway (“viscoelastic 
hypothesis”) ; or p rolapse of the velopharynx specifically occurring during expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] 
(“expi[INVESTIGATOR_94806]”).  We hypothesize that PEN can occur despi[INVESTIGATOR_94825]. We also hypothesize that PEN can occur due to 
reduced time for expi[INVESTIGATOR_94826] -expansion and also due to hysteresis and viscoelastic properties of 
the pharynx.  In addition, we hypothesize that applying expi[INVESTIGATOR_94827].  
In general, Oral Appliances (OA) devices are designed to maintain the mandible and/or 
tongue in a protruded posture during sleep, preventing upper airway obstruction. Limited studies 
in awake or s edated patients have demonstrated the effects of mandibular advancement on 
aspects of pharyngeal structure and function.  We propose that the two major baseline 
determinants of OA success are the structure and severity of upper airway collapse.  
In addition,  mouth breathing during sleep causes the jaw to drop resulting in a reduction 
of pharyngeal airway diameter and contributing to sleep apnea severity. Therefore, one potential 
solution to this problem is to use a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_94828] (and 
thus reduce pharyngeal collapse). We hypothesize that such a device will keep the lips from 
separating and thereby [CONTACT_94870].  
 
 
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
Briefly describe study design and anticipated enrollment, i.e., number of subjects to be enrolled 
by [CONTACT_17839] -wide and by [CONTACT_17840].  Provide a brief summary of the 
eligibility criteria (for example, age range, gender, medical condition).  Include any local site 
restric tions, for example, “Enrollment at Partners will be limited to adults although the sponsor’s 
protocol is open to both children and adults.”
 
OSA patients with an AHI > 10 epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]/hr will be studied  as well as subjects who snore 
with suspected obstructive sleep apnea .  Subjects will be on no medications  that could affect 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_94829].  Individuals with concurrent sleep disorders such as periodic limb 
movements (periodic limb movement arousal index > 10/hr), narcolepsy, or a parasomnia will be 
excluded.  Other exclusion criteria include:  periodontal disease, insufficient number of teeth , 
allergy to lidocaine, pregnancy, renal failure, neuromuscular disease or other major neurological 
disorders, uncontrolled diabetes, heart failure, central sl eep apnea or Cheyne -Stokes respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], 
uncontrolled hypertension, thyroid disease, or any other unstable major medical condition .  The 
age range will be 21 – 70 years.    
For each Part, Subjects will report to and be admitted into Brigham and Women’s 
Hospi [INVESTIGATOR_307] (BWH) Clinical Research Center (CRC) approximately 2 hours prior to their usual 
bedtime and after having been without food intake for the preceding 4 hours . For Part B there 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  June 1, [ADDRESS_104929] with Velcro straps and the mask attached to a pneumotachograph and a modified 
CPAP device. End Tidal partial pressure of CO 2 (PETCO 2) and pressure in the mask will also be 
monitored.  Pharyngeal pre ssure will be measured with a 5 -french Millar catheter that has 6 
pressure sensors 1.5cm apart starting at the tip. After nasal decongestion (0.05% oxymetazoline) 
and topi[INVESTIGATOR_41459] (4% lidocaine), the catheter will be placed with the tip1cm below the 
tongue base.  Once in place the catheter will be taped at the nose to ensure it does not move.  
Two pairs of magnetometers will be used to monitor lung volume.  The magnetometers 
will be placed on the front and back of the subject along the midline at the level of the sternum 
and just above the umbilicus.  Calibration will be performed during wakefulness by [CONTACT_94871].  
 
If the data collected are considered insufficient, the subject may be asked to repeat the 
whole study or a part of it.  
 
Part A (pattern of upper airway muscle activity and NED ) (n= 40): 
 In addition to the above described procedures, g enioglossal  EMG  will be measured with 
unipolar intramuscular electrodes as follows. Two 25 gauge needles containing 30 gauge 
Teflon -coated stainless steel wires are inserted into the muscle after topi[INVESTIGATOR_94830] 4% 
lidocaine (1 -2 mL’s). The needle is immedia tely removed leaving the wire in place. Both 
electrodes are referenced to a single ground producing a bipolar recording. Needle placement is 
as follows: the muscle is approached through the floor of the mouth with each needle being 
inserted about [ADDRESS_104930] anesthesia will be performed. Selective orophary ngeal anesthesia will 
be achieved by [CONTACT_94872], tonsillar pi[INVESTIGATOR_36523], posterior pharyngeal 
wall, and supraglottic area of the posterior oropharynx with a 4% lidocaine  HCl solution 
repeatedly until the gag reflex is abolished. S ubjects will be instructed to spit out any saliva 
accumulated during the procedure to minimize systemic absorption of the dose. The subject will 
then be allowed to sleep again and CPAP reduced to the same pressures as above to see if 
worsening NED develops . 
Study endpoints for Part A include successful completion of all measurements in the 
study, at the subject’s request, or by [CONTACT_94873].  
 
Part B ( upper airway endoscopy during flow limitation ) (Aim 1 - n=20 ; Aim 2 – n=40 ; Aim 
3=20 ): 
 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  June 1, 2005     6  Pharyngometry data will be collected in the CRC using the EccoVision Acoustic 
Pharyngometer (E. Benson Hood Laboratories, Pembrooke, MA) during wakefulness, prior to 
instrumentation. Each measurement consists of a plot of cross -sectional area [CSA (cm2)] as a 
function of distance (cm) from the oral cavity. Each subject will be asked to breathe into the 
device through a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]. Oral breathing will be ensured by [CONTACT_1299] a clip on the nares. 
Measurements will be obtained at functional residual capacity. Al l measurements will be 
performed while subjects are awake and in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].  
A standardized pre -fabricated trial mand ibular advancement ( Blue Pro, BlueSom, Paris, 
[LOCATION_009]) will be adjusted for patients not currently using oral appliances. It is a thermoplastic 
custo mizable  titrable  oral appliance  that can be easily fitted. We will set the mandible  position 
for 7 0% percent of the subject ’s maximum possible protrusion.   The device is designed to 
maintain the mandible in a maximally protruded posture consistent with patient comfort during 
sleep.  
EEG, EMG, EKG , EOG , oxygen saturation, mask pressure, PETC O2, airway pressure, 
genioglossal EMG and lung volume will be measured the same as already described. In addition, 
a 2.8mm pediatric fiberoptic bronchos cope with a working channel will be used to visualize the 
pharyngeal airway .  
A small diameter (<2 mm) catheter will be introduced through the working channel of the 
bronchoscope. This catheter is comprised of two main assemblies: an inner core comprised o f a 
rotating drive shaft and an optical fiber able to deliver a visible light located within the drive 
shaft, and a protective outer sheath. The internal core and rotational components of the catheter 
are sealed from communication with biological fluids an d tissue at all times. The fiber is 
terminated at the proximal end with a commercial fiberoptic connector that permits rapid and 
precise connectivity to a motor drive unit and a light source. Similar catheters have been used to 
conduct a number of optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI) studies including the pulmonary 
airways at the [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (MGH) (IRB Protocol #2008P001254). Although 
we will use an identical catheter as the ones being used at MGH, the present protocol will not use 
OFD I technology. Instead, we will use the device in the current protocol only to shine a visible 
light perpendicular to the catheter. No OFDI imaging will be performed. [CONTACT_94888], PI [INVESTIGATOR_94831] e xperience with this device with 
no adverse events being reported to date. We have been adequately trained to operate the device 
safely.  
The nares and nasopharynx will be topi[INVESTIGATOR_94832] 1 -2 ml of 
4% lidocaine spray. Additionally, 4% lidocaine gel with a cotton tip will be inserted through the 
nares in order to assure nasal topi[INVESTIGATOR_41459].  After making sure the nares and nasopharynx 
are numb, the scope will be inserted via a sealed hole in the mask and positioned just above the  
soft palate. The other end of the scope will be secured to an i.v. pole next to the bed. The visible 
light catheter will then be advanced through the auxiliary channel of the bronchoscope [ADDRESS_104931] to be recorded by [CONTACT_94874]´s camera. Once the visible 
light catheter is in place, the inner optical co re will be rotated at a speed of 100 rps.  
 
1. CPAP to induce flow -limitation: After instrumentation, the patient  will be asked to 
sleep in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_94833]. Once asleep, CPAP will be set to 
the holding pressure. After several minutes of stable breathing at the holding pressure 
during NREM sleep, CPAP will be decreased slightly for [ADDRESS_104932] gases for 2

patient will be asked to sleep in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_94834]. After a few minutes of stable sleep, 
the patient will be asked to wear the oral appliance or oral pressur e therapy. The 
patient  will be asked to test  the oral appliance  first. After a few minutes of stable 
sleep  with oral appliance in place , the patient  will be asked to change for the oral 
pressure therapy device.  
3. Oral appliance and effect on pharyngeal colla psibility:  The patients  will be invited 
to par ticipate in two additional physiological PSGs with and without OA.  Those 
patients fitted with the temporary thermoplastic device will be asked to use it at home 
the night before the physiological PSG with OA .  For the physiological PSGs, the  
instrumentation will be same described above , except the bronchoscope  that will not 
be used . The patient will be asked to sleep in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].  Once asleep, CPAP 
will be set to the holding pressure.  During the first  1-[ADDRESS_104934]

Study endpoints for Part B include successful completion of all measurements in the 
study, at the subject’s request, or by [CONTACT_94873].  
 
Part E (expi[INVESTIGATOR_94806])  (n=30) : 
 
EEG, EMG, EKG, EOG, oxygen saturation, mask pressure, PETCO 2, and airway 
pressure will be performed the same as already described in part B. One of the following two 
procedures will be performed. 1) A non -rebreathing v alve will be placed on the mask to enable 
changes in resistance to be made exclusively during expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (providing expi[INVESTIGATOR_94835]) during sleep. 2) A single -use expi[INVESTIGATOR_51374] (EPAP ; Provent Sleep 
Therapy, Manchester, NH,  [LOCATION_003] ) device will be applied to each nostril. The EPAP contains a 
mechanical valve with very low inspi[INVESTIGATOR_94836], medium, or high expi[INVESTIGATOR_94837] a seal.  
After instrumentation, the patients will be asked to sle ep in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_94838].   
Once asleep, during periods of reduced airflow (whether due to expi[INVESTIGATOR_94839]), expi[INVESTIGATOR_94840] -rebreathing valve (20 -80 
cmH 2O/L.s) in procedure  1 or the EPAP (low, medium, or high expi[INVESTIGATOR_32721]) in 
procedure 2 to examine whether airflow increases. A sham expi[INVESTIGATOR_94841] a

test whether expi[INVESTIGATOR_94843] (rather than when expi[INVESTIGATOR_94844]).  
Following completion of each study, all equipment will be removed, and the subject will 
be free to sleep in the laboratory free from equipment for the rest of the night. Alternatively, if 
the subject feels alert enough to leave, they may do so.  
Study endpoints for Part E include successful completion of all measurements in the 
study, at the sub ject’s request, or by [CONTACT_94873].  
Part F (oral breathing)  (n=30) : 
 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  June 1, [ADDRESS_104935] pressure will be performed 
the same as already described in part B. During the device night, in addition to these 
measurements, a single -use Varnum’s mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959], which is similar to an adh esive tape with a 
central opening, will be placed on a patient’s  mouth to encourage nasal breathing. The nostril -
size central opening allows for oral breathing when necessary.  
After instrumentation, the patients will be asked to sleep in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_94845]. Following completion of each study, all equipment will be removed, and 
the subject will be free to sleep in the laboratory free from equipment for the rest of the night. 
Alternatively, if the subject feels alert enough t o leave, they may do so.  
Study endpoints for Part F include successful completion of all measurements in the 
study, at the subject’s request, or by [CONTACT_94873].  
 
 
Briefly describe study procedures.  Include any local site restrictions, for example, “Subjects 
enrolled at Partners will not participate in the pharmacokinetic portion of the study.”  Describe 
study endpoints.
 
 
 
For studies involving treatment or diagnosis, provide information about standard of care at 
Partners (e.g., BWH, MGH) and indicate how the study procedures differ from standard care.  
Provide information on available alternative treatments, procedures, or methods of diagnosis.
 
 
 
Describe how risks to subjects are minimized, for example, by [CONTACT_94875].
 
We will attempt to minimize the risk to subjects participating in these studies as follows:  
 
1.  All participants will be healthy.  The obstructive sleep apnea patients have no other 
medically important disorders other than sleep apnea.  
2.  All studies will be conducted by [CONTACT_94876] a trained technician  
knowledgeable in all asp ects of the procedures utilized.  T he investigator is an M.D. or a Ph.D. 
who is very knowledgeable in respi[INVESTIGATOR_94846] .  The trained technician will only monitor subjects during procedures equivalent to a 
standard or home sleep study .  
3.  Resuscitation equipment is immediately available should the need for it arise.  
However, this seems highly unlikely.  If there is significant bleeding or  the patient aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026], or if 
any other complications occur, then the PI ( David Wellman , MD, PhD) will be called (if he is 
not the one conducting the study) and the patient will be ev aluated by a physician in the CRC or 
the Emergency Department on the bottom floor of the same building where the studies are 
conducted . 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  June 1, [ADDRESS_104936] from the study, for example, objective criteria for worsening disease/lack of 
improvement and/or unacceptable adverse ev ents.  The inclusion of objective drop criteria is 
especially important in studies designed with placebo control groups.
An adverse event is defined as untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence (e.g. 
abnormal physical sign/symptom or lab value) associated  with the subject’s participation in the 
research study.  A serious adverse event is defined as any adverse event that results in death, is 
life threatening, requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or causes disability.  The subject will be removed from 
the study if an adverse or serious adverse event occurs.  Subjects will not be entered into the 
study unless they are healthy other than having obstructive sleep apnea in the patients. 
Specifically if any subject has uncontrolled hypertension or any cardio -respi[INVESTIGATOR_94847]. If significant bleeding, swelling or vomiting are encountered 
during placement of the intramuscular electrodes and pressure catheter the study will be ceased 
although this has not been encountered in the past a nd so we do not expect these events. During 
the study the protocol will be ceased if any ECG abnormalities are noted or if any other 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]/sleep disorder is discovered and the subject will be seen by [CONTACT_94877] -up arranged as necessary.  
 
FORESEEABLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS  
Provide a brief description of any foreseeable risks and discomforts to subjects.  Include those 
related to drugs/devices/procedures being studied and/or administered/performed solely for 
research purposes.  In addition, include psychosocial risks, and risks related to privacy and 
confidentiality.  When applicable, describe risks to a developi[INVESTIGATOR_17779].
We believe that the risks associated with the procedures of the present study to be small. 
However, they will be individually addressed below.  
 
Pharyngeal Pressure Determination:  Pharyngeal pressure will be monitored during the studies. 
We have extensive experience with pharyngeal catheter placement without significant adverse 
reactions. However, some discomfort and potential risk may be present. There may be some 
discomfort passi ng the catheter through the nose and gagging can occur. The risk of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_94848] a subject in whom a mask is in place and pharyngeal catheter has been 
inserted. Although this is a potential risk, we believe the likelihood to be quite sm all for several 
reasons. First, once in place , the pharyngeal catheter causes little gagging. Second, all subjects 
will have fasted for four hours prior to the study and thus their stomach content is minimal. 
Finally, the mask can be easily removed. For th ese reasons we believe aspi[INVESTIGATOR_94849] a minimal 
risk. 
Lidocaine 4%:  If the subjects have any history of lidocaine allergy, they will be excluded from 
the study. Excessive use of lidocaine can cause seizures, but this is reported with much higher 
doses th an will be utilized in this study. Note: lidocaine does taste unpleasant and the subjects 
will be informed of this.  
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  June 1, 2005     10  OxymetazolineHCl: Oxymetazoline will be sprayed twice into each nostril just prior to inserting 
the pressure catheters. This medicine could  cause irritation to the nasal mucosa. In larger doses 
than used in this study, transient hypertension has been seen.  
Determination of Ventilation During Sleep:  The electrodes (EEG, EMG, and EOG), elastic 
bands, vibration sensors, mask, and oximeter used to monitor sleep and breathing may be mildly 
uncomfortable and could interfere with normal sleep. However, apart from the possibility of poor 
quality of sleep and sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_94850], no other important risk is anticipated.  
Visualization of upp er airway with a pediatric bronchoscope:   The insertion of a pediatric 
bronchoscope into the nasopharynx will cause some discomfort when it is passed through the 
nose, and it may cause gagging when it is in the pharynx. As with the pharyngeal catheter 
insertion, the risk of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_94851]. While this is a potential risk, we believe the 
likelihood to be small for the following reasons. First, the nose and pharynx will be anesthetized 
with lidocaine.  Second, once the bronchoscope is in place, it causes little gagging. Third, all 
subjects will have fasted for four hours prior to the study and thus their stomach content will be 
minimal. For these reasons we believe aspi[INVESTIGATOR_94849] a minimal risk.  
Visible light catheter:  the visible light cathete r will be inserted through the working channel of 
the bronchoscope and kept in the pharyngeal lumen under continuous endoscopic view and 
therefore does not offer ad ditional risk to the procedure.  
Oral appliance:  We do not expect any further risk or discomf ort while using an oral appliance 
since the subject will be tested with his /her own custom -made device in use during the previous 
months.  
Temporary thermoplastic oral appliance:  The device may cause temporary dental sensitivity, jaw 
pain, dry mouth or hype rsalivation. We do not expec t any other significant risk once its use will 
be temporary.  
Oral pressure therapy:  this device may cause minor oral discomfort and salivation. No significant 
risks are expected.  
Acoustic Pharyngometry:  There is no risk with this procedure and no discomfort.  
CPAP drops:  As above, the only risks are the instrumentation described above, poor quality 
sleep, and transient shortness of breath when CPAP is lowered.  
Magnetometers:  Two pairs of m agnetometers wil l be taped to the front and back of the patient. It 
does not offer any risk. However, it may lead to some discomfort since the patient will lay on the 
back magnetometers. After using the magnetometers in several patients, this was very infrequent.  
Intramus cular EMG Determination : Needle insertion is likely to be mildly painful although the 
mucosa is topi[INVESTIGATOR_94852]. We have found this pain to be similar to venipuncture and well 
tolerated. Once he needle is removed and the wire left in place, we have found the discomfort to 
be minimal. As we are not inserting the needle into areas where large arteries are present, we 
doubt quantitatively important bleeding is very probable. However, small hematomas could 
develop. Intramuscular or surface infection coul d occur as a result of the needle or wire. 
Although both are sterile, it is impossible to sterilize the mouth. We have, however, never 
encountered such a problem or heard of it happening elsewhere. However, there may be some 
residual soreness in the tongue  for several hours after the wires are removed.

Although we expect  this to make breathing out easier for some subjects, this may make breathing 
less comfortable for other subjects. By [CONTACT_2329] a specialized breathing apparatus (non -rebreathing 
valve) it will not be any harder to breathe in through the nose, which will minim ize any 
discomfort.

In conclusion, we believe the medical risks of the study to be quite small. We and other 
investiga tors have accomplished similar studies without incident. The time required to participate 
in this study will depend to a certain extent on how well the individual sleeps in the laboratory . 
However, every subject will be required to attend one overnight sle ep study.  
 
EXPECTED BENEFITS  
Describe both the expected benefits to individual subjects participating in the research and the 
importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result from the study.  Provide 
a brief, realistic  summary of potential benefits to subjects, for example, “It is hoped that the 
treatment will result in a partial reduction in tumor size in at least 25% of the enrolled subjects.”  
Indicate how the results of the study will benefit future patients with th e disease/condition being 
studied and/or society, e.g., through increased knowledge of human physiology or behavior, 
improved safety, or technological advances.  
The proposed studies offer no real benefit to the participating subjects. If un known 
abnormalities of sleep are encountered, the information will be given to the subject and the 
subject’s physician if the subject desires. However, there is no other direct benefit. The studies 
we propose should substantially improve our understanding of and apnea pathogenesis which 
will hopefully lead to new strategies for therapy. Therefore the societal benefit will hopefully be 
considerable.  
 
 
EQUITABLE SELECTION OF SUBJECTS  
The risks and benefits of the research must be fairly distributed among the populations that stand 
to benefit from it.  No group of persons, for example, men, women, pregnant women, children, 
and minorities, should be categorically excluded from the research without a good scientific or 
ethical reas on to do so.  Please provide the basis for concluding that the study population is 
representative of the population that stands to potentially benefit from this research.
In all proposed protocols, males and females will be recruited. It is also our intent  to 
include minorities based on their representation in the patients seen at Brigham and Women’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Based on a recent assessment, the racial/ethnic mix at Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94856] 70.6% Caucasian, 12.6% African -American, 4.8% Hispanic and 2. 3% Asian.  American 
Indian and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander make up < 0.05% of the population and thus will 
not be included in these protocols.  We plan to include all other groups at appropriate numbers 
based on these figures.  
Children will not be stu died as the pathophysiology of OSA is different in children and is 
primarily related to tonsil and adenoid hypertrophy. Pregnant women will not be studied as 
pregnancy will likely change respi[INVESTIGATOR_94857].  
 
When people who do not speak English are excluded from participation in the research, provide 
the scientific rationale for doing so.  Individuals who do not speak English should not be denie d 
participation in research simply because it is inconvenient to translate the consent form in 
different languages and to have an interpreter present.
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form    Filename: [CONTACT_9453]:  June 1, 2005     12  The interpreting services and the “Short Form” consent forms will be utilized to enroll 
any subjects who wishes to participate but does not speak English. We will provide a translator 
obtained from interpreter services department who is fluent in English and the subjects’ native 
language

RECRUITMENT PROCEDURES  
Explain in detail the specific methodology that will be used to recruit subjects.  Specifically 
address how, when, where and by [CONTACT_94878].  Inc lude any specific recruitment methods used to enhance recruitment of women 
and minorities.
Subjects will be recruited from our database of existing research subjects. Subjects also 
may be recruited through word of mouth, email, telephone, newspaper, intern et and social media 
sites such as Facebook and Craigslist, and or bulletin fliers. Should the subject be interested in 
the study, they can call or email the study physician or coordinator to inquire about study 
participation .  All email sent outside of the  Partners firewall containing confidential information 
will be encrypted using "Send Secure" as per policy.  Subjects may opt out of encrypted email 
communications if they have been advised of the risks associated with unencrypted email, and 
they indicate a preference to receive unencrypted email despi[INVESTIGATOR_94858].  
Only patients who have stated in the initial clinical questionnaire that they are interested 
in hearing about research studies will be contact[CONTACT_94879].  During the phone  or email 
interview patients will first be asked if they are willing to hear about research studies. If they 
aren’t , the interview will be stopped. Patients will be called  or emailed  by [CONTACT_94880]. Therefore, patients won’t feel obliged to 
participate because of a therapeutic relationship.  
Individuals who respond and are interested in participating in this study will be given a 
thorough review of the risks, discomforts, potential benefits and their expected involvement 
during the initial phone  or email  conversation. Both men and women and people of all racial and 
ethnic backgrounds will be studied.   
 
Provide details of remuneration, when applicable.  Even when subjects may derive medical 
benefit from participation, it is often the case that extra hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042], meals at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
parking fees or other inconveniences will result in  additional out -of-pocket expenses related to 
study participation.  Investigators may wish to consider providing reimbursement for such 
expenses when funding is available
Subjects will receive $1 00/night for participation in this study.  Compensation for pa rking 
costs or taxi vouchers will also be provided

CONSENT PROCEDURES  
Explain in detail how, when, where, and by [CONTACT_17844], and the timing of consent 
(i.e., how long subjects will be given to consider participation).  For most studies involving more 
than minimal risk and all studies involving investigational drugs/devices, a licensed physician 
investigator must obtain informed consent.  When subjects are to be enrolled from among the 
investigators’ own patients, describe how the  potential for coercion will be avoided.
 
There will be separate consent forms for Part s A, B, E, and F. Informed consent will be 
obtained either by [CONTACT_1716][INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a n experienced co -investigator  prior to any 
participation in the study. The o pportunity to talk to a licensed MD (who is readily available at 
the time of consent, and available overnight at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) will be offered and documented in 
each case. After informed consent is obtained, the licensed MD will examine the subject (histor y 
and physical) to confirm whether he/she is suitable to proceed with the study.  Subjects will have 
more than [ADDRESS_104937] 
who is unable to give consent will not be studied.

DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
Describe the plan for monitoring the data to ensure the safety of subjects.  The plan should 
include a brief description of (1) the safety and/or efficacy data that will be reviewed; (2) the 
planned frequency of review; and (3) who will be responsible for this review and for determining 
whether the research should be altered or stopped.  Include a br ief description of any stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_94859], when appropriate.  Depending upon the risk, size and complexity of the 
study, the investigator, an expert group, an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB) or others might be assigned primary  responsibility for this monitoring activity.

investigator [INVESTIGATOR_17782], safety, and welfare of subjects 
under his/h er care.  
This study is primarily a physiological investigation of the factors that lead to OSA in 
particular individuals.  Thus, subjects will be carefully monitored with physiologic instruments 
(airflow, oxygen saturation, end -tidal carbon  dioxide, etc.) during each of the studies.  During 
each of the physiologic measurement , subjects will be monitored by [CONTACT_56692] (typi[INVESTIGATOR_94860] a co -investigator) , a PhD , a co -investigator , or a trained technician  very 
knowledgeable in Respi[INVESTIGATOR_94861].  Each of  
the participants will have OSA (and be otherwise healthy).  The range of possible adverse events 
is quite narrow and will be quickly realized by [CONTACT_94881](s) perfor ming the 
physiologic measurement.  The study staff and investigators in this protocol will meet monthly to 
examine raw data and discuss any difficulties encountered.  Thus, the investigators involved in 
this study will be responsible for overseeing the int egrity of the results and monitoring for 
adverse events.  “Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]” will consist of the patient’s inability to tolerate the 
monitoring equipment, side effect from one of the medications, swelling of the airway, difficulty 
breathing, or bleeding.  
 
 
Describe the plan to be followed by [CONTACT_079]/study staff for review of adverse 
events experienced by [CONTACT_17847]/her care, and when applicable, for review of sponsor 
safety reports and DSMB reports.  Describe the  plan for reporting adverse events to the sponsor 
and the Partners’ IRB and, when applicable, for submitting sponsor safety reports and DSMB 
reports to the Partners’ IRBs.  When the investigator is also the sponsor of the IND/IDE, include 
the plan for repo rting of adverse events to the FDA and, when applicable, to investigators at 
other sites.

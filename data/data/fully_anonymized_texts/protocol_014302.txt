Version 3; Version Date 5/4/23 
 Page 2 of 15    1.0 Objectives Primary: To evaluate the feasibility of conducting a randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing a proactive identification + digital mental health intervention (DMHI) approach vs treatment as usual (TAU) among individuals living with likely incurable cancer (ILLIC) with depression.  Secondary: To determine the acceptability, appropriateness, and adoption of a proactive identification + DMHI approach and TAU among ILLIC with depression.  Secondary: To examine the fidelity of Moodivate approach among ILLIC with depression.  Exploratory: To explore the effect of a proactive + DMHI approach on depression, anxiety, and quality of life among ILLIC with depression relative to TAU.  2.[ADDRESS_737571] documented that evidence-based psychosocial treatment improves depression outcomes for ILLIC. However, multilevel barriers, including transportation issues, stigma, and a scarcity of oncology mental health providers18-20 limit treatment access (Figure 1). Thus, ILLIC need feasible, accessible evidence-based depression treatment options.   Best practice guidelines for comprehensive survivorship care suggest that screening and assessment of psychosocial concerns should be part of every clinical encounter11,12,21. Short depression screeners (e.g., the PHQ-222) are now routinely administered in oncology settings21,23 and these data can be used to proactively (i.e., outside of a clinical encounter) identify survivors in need of psychosocial treatment and link them to scalable options. While psychosocial screening data are recorded in structured Electronic Health Record (EHR) fields and can be readily used for proactive identification of patients with depression, efficient identification of ILLIC is more challenging. Data necessary to determine likelihood of curability, such as advanced stage at diagnosis or progression to metastatic cancer, are typi[INVESTIGATOR_561300]24, necessitating labor-intensive, manual chart review to identify ILLIC. To realize the goal of proactive identification and delivery of scalable evidence-based depression care for ILLIC, accurate, efficient, automated identification approaches are needed. Self-guided digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) can be paired with proactive identification to deliver scalable evidence-based depression treatment25. Our team previously adapted one evidence-based depression treatment26-29, Behavioral Activation (BA), for delivery via a DMHI called “Moodivate.” Of available psychosocial depression treatments, BA is an ideal fit for ILLIC because of its: 1) strong clinical evidence base among cancer survivors26-29 and 2) appropriateness for an underlying mechanism of depression faced by [CONTACT_561305]. Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_561301] a feasible, acceptable, and efficacious DMHI30,31. While a proactive treatment delivery model using a DMHI such as Moodivate may be a promising approach to deliver evidence-based depression treatment to ILLIC, additional work is needed to determine feasibility and efficacy of the approach.

 Page 3 of 15  3.0 Intervention to be studied  Moodivate: When users first download Moodivate, they complete a psychoeducational interactive tutorial, practice generating goals and activities, and receive instruction on app use. Users are then taken to their Home screen where they can see an overview of their activities for the day, plan additional activities, and track mood. Users are prompted to continuously generate new goals across life areas (Relationships, Daily Responsibilities, Recreation, Career and Education, Health) and multiple activities within each goal. By [CONTACT_561306], this goal-driven framework ensures that activities will be positively reinforced32. Once a user has identified activities across goals, activities are scheduled and monitored via the Calendar (for future planning) and Home (for today) screens. After completing an activity, the user receives reinforcement (e.g., “Great job!”). Moodivate users can track daily mood to monitor progress and are prompted to complete a clinical assessment of depressive symptoms33 once every two weeks. Users can view a graph of fluctuations in mood and depressive symptoms overlaid upon a graph of the number of completed activities, illustrating the connection between activity and mood. Users are reinforced for treatment engagement via badges31. Users are encouraged to use the app regularly, at least once per day, for the treatment of depressed mood34. If randomized to receive Moodivate, study staff will provide the participant with a Moodivate app download code and will ensure successful download. Study staff will then give the participant a brief, scripted overview (as utilized in our R41 and R42) regarding app utilization and will provide the participant with 10 minutes to use the app and ask questions.   
  TAU: TAU mimics existing depression treatment for ILLIC. Participants in both conditions will be provided educational mood management material available via the EHR with the suggestion to discuss questions with their oncology provider. Across conditions, participants will not be precluded from obtaining additional treatment (e.g., pharmacotherapy, palliative care), which will be tracked throughout the study via self-report.    4.0 Study Endpoints Table 1.

Change in the PHQ-936 score from baseline to 1-month follow-up. Change in the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620], Anxiety subscale (HADS-A) score from baseline to 1-month follow-up. Change in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G7) score from baseline to 1-month follow-up.   5.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria/ Study Population Inclusion criteria:  1) elevated depressive symptoms, defined as a score of ≥ 10 on the PHQ-936 2) ILLIC (as determined during manual chart review) 3) age 18+ 4) currently own an iOS- or Android-compatible smartphone 5) report willingness to utilize a mobile app for the treatment of depressed mood (response of “yes” on yes/no item) 6) have a valid e-mail address that is checked regularly or have regular access to text messages (to access follow-up assessments) 7) English fluency  Exclusion criteria: 1) Severe cognitive impairment that precludes completion of informed consent 2) current suicidal ideation on the PHQ-9 at screening or final study eligibility, defined as a response ≥1 (several days) on item nine   6.0 Number of Subjects We will recruit 15 participants to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of proactive identification + DMHI vs TAU among ILLIC with depression.  7.0 Setting This study will be conducted within the NCI-Designated Hollings Cancer Center (HCC) and recruitment will leverage the HCC Survivorship and Cancer Outcomes Research (SCOR) infrastructure (Director: mPI [INVESTIGATOR_561302]). As the only NCI-Designated Cancer Center in SC, HCC serves a diverse racial, socioeconomic, and geographic population. More than 3,500 new patients are diagnosed or treated at HCC annually.  8.0 Recruitment Methods Study participants will be recruited proactively and remotely via the EHR using the same procedures utilized in our team’s prior proactive behavioral health intervention trials. We will utilize available EHR data via a research data request to obtain a recruitment report of HCC patients with depressive symptoms with likely incurable cancer. Free-text and other fields (e.g., radiology reports, lab values) will be manually reviewed to identify survivors with likely incurable cancer. Discrete fields (e.g., PHQ-2 screening, depression-related diagnostic or billing codes) will be used to identify those with likely depressive 
Version 3; Version Date 5/4/[ADDRESS_737572] and/or consensus discussion at the multi-disciplinary tumor board documenting an advanced cancer stage that is deemed likely incurable and/or cancer that is metastatic upon diagnosis and/or progresses to metastatic following prior treatments. Depression will be defined as 1) a score of > [ADDRESS_737573] PHQ-2 (the optimal cut-point to identify depression37), 2) depression listed on the problem list, or 3) a depression-related billing code associated with the last visit. To facilitate chart review, EHR data and clinical notes will be imported into a secure REDCap database38. Labels (ILLIC/non-ILLIC) will be provided as fields in REDCap and team members will assign an outcome. Clear guidelines will be created based on the ILLIC definition and linked in the REDCap project for easy reference. Patients on the study recruitment report identified as having likely incurable cancer and depressive symptoms will be sent a study invitation by [CONTACT_5051]. Invitations will be sent via MyChart, text message, e-mail, and/or phone call and we will follow all requirements of the POR process. The study team will not cold-contact [CONTACT_289272]-ed out of receiving contact [CONTACT_289273]. If interested, participants will complete an online screening within REDCap to determine preliminary study eligibility.   9.0 Consent Process After completing determination of preliminary eligibility, a member of the research team will schedule a phone call with the participant to determine final study eligibility (no suicidal ideation reported on the PHQ-9 and a score >=10 on the PHQ-9). After determination of final study eligibility, a study team member will complete remote electronic informed consent (e-consent) with the participant via REDCap. Participants will receive a link to an electronic consent form, available via REDCap, that they can review and sign. Review of the consent form will be paired with a phone call with a member of the research team to ensure that all questions are answered prior to enrollment. This remote consent procedure is currently utilized across all of [CONTACT_436908]’s current NIH-funded awards. As smartphone ownership is an inclusion criterion (to use Moodivate), all participants will have internet access and thus access to the electronic consent form. All participants will electronically sign informed consent forms that have been IRB-approved once the study is explained to them in full and they have stated that they understand what is being asked of them. Participants will be given the opportunity to ask questions about their participation throughout the course of the study. A copy of the informed consent will be kept centrally at our study office within locked filing cabinets and a copy will also be given to each study participant. Participants will be given a study phone number and e-mail address to contact [CONTACT_561307].  10.0 Study Design / Methods ILLIC with depressive symptoms identified chart review will be randomized 2:1 to proactive identification + DMHI vs TAU via a two-arm remote pi[INVESTIGATOR_561303] (N=15). The purpose of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_561304] a larger future grant (e.g., R01) and examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of proactive identification + self-guided DMHI approach vs TAU.  In addition to baseline assessments completed following e-consent, all participants will be text messaged and/or emailed a REDCap link, accessible via smartphone, to complete follow-ups weekly for 4 weeks. Assessments are estimated at 10 minutes each and participants will be compensated $40 in electronic gift codes for completion of baseline assessments, $40 for completion of each follow-up assessment, and $[ADDRESS_737574]-study interview (~30-45 minutes) to help further refine trial procedures. Individual interviews may occur either remotely using an MUSC-approved HIPAA compliant video conferencing platform (e.g., Microsoft Teams, MUSC Pro Zoom) Those who participate in these interviews will earn an additional $40 (total

 Page 6 of 15  potential compensation = $340). Procedures for remote remuneration are well-established through our prior trials39.  We will collect the following study measures from the EHR or patient self-report as indicated below.  Baseline Demographics (Assessed via self-report at baseline) Participants will self-report age, race, sex, ethnicity, marital status, insurance, and home address (which will be used to determine rurality).   Clinical characteristics (Assessed via EHR data and self-report at baseline) Clinical and mental health characteristics are assessed using clinical documentation within the EHR unless otherwise indicated.  We will collect data via the EHR and participant self-report regarding include type of cancer (breast, lung, colon, etc), type of ILLIC [locally advanced, metastatic], current cancer treatment (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, etc), and ECOG performance status40. We will also collect self-report data regarding use of psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, DMHIs, and supportive care services (e.g., palliative care, support groups).  Technological Experience (Assessed via self-report at baseline) Pew Research Center’s technology adoption survey: This validated survey will be used to assess experience using technology and internet access (home broadband, access via mobile device)41.  Mobile Device Proficiency Questionnaire (MDPQ-16)42: The MDPQ-16 is a validated 16-item measure of mobile device proficiency.  Computer Proficiency Questionnaire (CPQ-12)43: The CPQ-12 is a validated 12-item measure of computer proficiency.  Implementation (Assessed via self-report Week 4 [SUS] and via app analytics across study duration) System Usability Scale (SUS35): The SUS is a 10-item self report measure of acceptability.  Adoption: Adoption will be characterized as 1) number of app sessions, 2) average time per session, and 3) total time using the app.  Retention: Retention will be defined as any app use within each week following enrollment.  Fidelity: Fidelity will be measured as 1) number of goals created, 2) number of activities created, 3) number of activities scheduled, and 4) number of activities completed.  Clinical Efficacy (Assessed at baseline and at all study timepoints via self-report) PHQ-936: The PHQ-9 is a validated 9-item measure of depression. The PHQ-9 has high sensitivity and specificity for identifying individuals with depressive symptoms, particularly among cancer survivors44-46.  Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G7)47: The FACT-G7 is a patient-reported outcome measure of health-related quality of life with good validity and reliability in patients with cancer47.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620], Anxiety subscale (HADS-A). The HADS-A is a validated 7-item patient-report measure of anxiety symptoms in the past week which has been used extensively among patients with advanced cancer48.

 Page 7 of 15  11.0 Data Analysis and Data Management   Data Analysis Data analysis for Aims 1 and 2 will primarily focus on descriptive analysis of feasibility and acceptability metrics. Descriptive statistics will be summarized overall and within each intervention group for baseline demographic and clinical variables and for primary study outcomes. Descriptive analyses will be used to help determine feasibility of a future larger scale clinical trial with this patient population using these approaches.   Data Management Participants will enter data in REDCap, a secure, web-based application designed exclusively to support data capture for research studies. REDCap provides: 1) an intuitive interface for data entry (with data validation); 2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures; 3) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages (SPSS, SAS, Stata, R); 4) procedures for importing data from external sources; and 5) advanced features, such as branching logic and calculated fields. These procedures are effective in minimizing data entry errors (e.g., missing or errant data). All data from Moodivate will be stored on a HIPAA-compliant server and data will be transmitted securely to the research team via industry standard protocols as in our prior trials. Recruitment projects are housed in REDCap and only IRB approved study team members will have access to the recruitment project database. The research team will only have access to the REDCap recruitment project while actively enrolling for the study.  12.[ADDRESS_737575] weekly meetings to discuss any qualitative comments received during data collection and any problems in data collection. The PIs will examine the database for potential irregularities monthly. Initial data analyses will examine distributions of variable scores and comparability of baseline characteristics across conditions in case analyses need to be adjusted for these. Confidentiality procedures are outlined above.   Regulatory Issues All serious AEs will be reported to the MUSC Committee on Human Research within 48-hours. Follow-up of all unexpected and serious AEs will also be reported. All AEs will be reviewed weekly by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_184197]. Any significant actions taken by [CONTACT_335434]. We estimate the significant AE rate to be very low (< 5%). Potential conflicts of interest (COI) will be reported using the rules of MUSC’s COI committee.  Trial Safety The contact [CONTACT_976] ([CONTACT_436908]) will serve as the lead Program Manager for AEs. All unexpected AEs will be monitored while they are active to determine if treatment is needed. We anticipate that AEs will be rare given that the Moodivate app is non-invasive and that all participants will be engaged with current healthcare. For each weekly study meeting, the research assistant will prepare a summary of all AEs, including their severity, whether they caused a dropout, required treatment, and presumed relation to app utilization. The PIs will review this at the weekly study meeting (or before if more urgent). At the weekly meeting (or before if urgent), the research staff will report any premonitory symptoms to suggest emergence of a serious psychiatric condition (e.g., suicidality).

Study procedures will follow as much as possible the FDA’s Good Clinical Practice Guidelines and our research team has found Spi[INVESTIGATOR_84620]’s comprehensive text on conducting clinical trials to be useful49. We will encourage participants to notify their physicians that a) they are in a randomized controlled research study examining a treatment for depressed mood, and b) the physician should contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_260680].   The research staff will be instructed not to reveal whether a person is a participant in the study and will report to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_260681] a participant or any breaches in confidentiality. All requests by [CONTACT_3445]’s physicians and other medical providers will be referred directly to the PI.   Data and Safety Monitoring Plan Administration The PIs will be responsible for monitoring the trial, with additional oversight provided by [CONTACT_389930]-Investigators. The PIs will examine monthly the outcomes database for missing data, unexpected distributions or responses, and outliers. The PIs will check weekly the AE database prepared by [CONTACT_561308].   13.0 Risks to Subjects This is considered a minimal risk study. Minimal risk means the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests. The potential risks in this study include those related to: a) depressive symptoms, b) clinical deterioration, c) confidentiality, d) potential data breach from the app database, and e) frustration. All risk mitigation strategies outlined have previously been approved by [CONTACT_561309]’s prior Moodivate evaluation trials.  a) Depressive symptoms: Depressive symptoms will be monitored via the PHQ-9. All participants will complete the PHQ-[ADDRESS_737577] access to the online PHQ-9 assessments.  b) Clinical deterioration: Drs. Dahne, Graboyes, and their research team will monitor participant PHQ-9 scores for possible clinical deterioration (i.e., increasing depressive symptoms and/or the development of suicidal ideation) throughout the course of the study as participants complete the PHQ-9 weekly. Clinical deterioration will be defined as an increase of 5 or more points on the PHQ-9 from the baseline PHQ-9 assessment or a response of “More than half the days” or “Nearly every day” on item 9 (“Thoughts that you would be better off dead, or thoughts of hurting yourself in some way”) of the PHQ-9. Our team has developed real-time alerts in REDCap which alert the investigative team if a participant completes a PHQ-[ADDRESS_737578]. Dahne (or other IRB-approved clinical personnel) will suggest that the participant seek treatment and then will follow-up with the participant via phone one week later. In the event that a participant reports suicidal ideation either during study screening or during subsequent assessments, [CONTACT_436908] will complete a risk assessment with the participant via phone. [CONTACT_436908] will query the participant for details regarding the suicidal ideation, including a likelihood of harming oneself imminently and a plan for committing

If neither the participant nor the emergency contact [CONTACT_561311]. Dahne within 48, [CONTACT_436908] will call local emergency services and will provide them with the participant’s name [CONTACT_561313] a well check. These risk mitigation procedures will be reviewed with all participants during the informed consent process and are currently approved across all of our team’s IRB protocols. [CONTACT_436908] has more than 10 years of experience conducting suicide risk assessments. In the event that a participant evidences clinical deterioration, the participant will be allowed to continue in the trial, but we will recruit an additional participant for data collection purposes.   c) Confidentiality: Participants will be made aware of limits to confidentiality at the beginning of screening and during informed consent which includes a report of suicidal or homicidal intent or report of abuse or neglect. If the participant reports suicidal or homicidal intent or abuse/neglect during screening or at any point during the trial, [CONTACT_436908] will take appropriate action as outlined by [CONTACT_165469], NIH, and the State of South Carolina, which may include paging the participant’s oncologist, contact[CONTACT_436900]/or pursuing involuntary commitment at a mental health facility. If participants present no imminent danger but also need more extensive treatment of mental health concerns, they will be given appropriate referrals. All individual interviews will be recorded, transcribed, and destroyed within [ADDRESS_737581] confidentiality.  d) Data breach: Although health information will be collected within Moodivate (e.g., daily mood ratings, activities, values), personally identifiable information will intentionally not be collected within the app (e.g., name, phone number, email address, etc), and thus we will not collect nor will we retain protected health information (PHI). In the event of a data breach, it is important to note that health information will not be able to be tracked back to specific individual users. By [CONTACT_540510], we ensure HIPAA compliance while also protecting the identities of our users. In the event of a data breach, all app users will be notified via email.    e) Frustration: Participants may become frustrated while completing questionnaires or while using Moodivate. Participants will be informed that they may refuse to answer any question(s) that they do not wish to answer and that they may discontinue use of Moodivate at any time.  f) Randomization: The treatment participants receive may prove to be less effective or to have more side effects than the other study treatment(s) or other available treatments.  e) Unknown risks: The experimental treatments may have unknown side effects. The researchers will let participants know if they learn anything during the course of the study that might make participants change their mind about participating in the study.  Since patients will all currently be receiving medical care at HCC, there are no additional risks associated with participation in this study.  Adequacy of Protection Against Risks  Recruitment and Informed Consent Study participants will be recruited proactively and remotely via the EHR using the same procedures utilized in our team’s prior proactive behavioral health intervention trials. We will utilize available EHR 
Version 3; Version Date 5/4/[ADDRESS_737582] will be sent a study invitation by [CONTACT_5051]. If interested, participants will complete an online screening within REDCap to determine preliminary study eligibility. After completing determination of preliminary eligibility, a member of the research team will schedule a phone call with the participant to determine final study eligibility (no suicidal ideation reported on the PHQ-9 and a score >=10 on PHQ-9). After determination of final study eligibility, a study team member will complete remote electronic informed consent (e-consent) with the participant via REDCap. Participants will receive a link to an electronic consent form, available via REDCap, that they can review and sign. Review of the consent form will be paired with a phone call with a member of the research team to ensure that all questions are answered prior to enrollment. This remote consent procedure is currently utilized across all of [CONTACT_436908]’s current NIH-funded awards. As smartphone ownership is an inclusion criterion (to use Moodivate), all participants will have internet access and thus access to the electronic consent form. All participants will electronically sign informed consent forms that have been IRB-approved once the study is explained to them in full and they have stated that they understand what is being asked of them. Participants will be given the opportunity to ask questions about their participation throughout the course of the study. A copy of the informed consent will be kept centrally at our study office within locked filing cabinets and a copy will also be given to each study participant. Participants will be given a study phone number and e-mail address to contact [CONTACT_561307].  Protections Against Risk All screening information will be kept in a password protected REDCap database. Only key study personnel will have access to the database. If an individual is not eligible to participate, his/her screener will include his/her first name [CONTACT_436907]. Eligible participants’ full name, telephone number and e-mail address will be recorded in the database. This is the only place where participants’ names and subject identification numbers appear together. Eligible participants will be assigned a subject number, will complete informed consent (see procedures above), will be randomized, will complete baseline assessments, and subsequently will receive their randomized intervention.  Upon completing eligibility screening, if study eligible, individuals will be provided with a verbal overview of the study, asked to review a consent form, and asked to provide informed consent. Participants will be informed of limitations of confidentiality (i.e., abuse or neglect, intention to harm self or someone else) both verbally and in writing during the informed consent process. The consent form will include the participant’s name, but not his/her subject number. Consent forms will be provided in English. As utilization of Moodivate requires that participants are able to read, participants unable to read the consent form on their own will not be included.  Regarding questionnaire data, data will be obtained for research purposes only. All data will be collected, stored, and managed via REDCap, which is a secure, web-based application designed exclusively to support data capture for research studies. REDCap includes real time validation rules with automated data type and range checks at the time of entry. The underlying database is hosted in a secure data center at MUSC and includes redundancy, failover capability, backups and extensive security checks. The system has several layers of protection including user/group account management, "Data Access Groups" which allow data to be entered by [CONTACT_253757], audit trails for all changes, queries and reports, and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. Name [CONTACT_436906] [CONTACT_436903], in accordance with HIPAA. All data will be identified only by [CONTACT_63903] (participant IDs). Participant IDs will be linked to participants’ names in a password-protected file that is accessible only to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_66171].   
Version 3; Version Date 5/4/[ADDRESS_737583] hashed version of the patient’s email address to support password reset and unique identification, but that identification will not be traceable back to the user’s true identity. We will not store any personally identifiable information (e.g., first name, last name, email address, phone number) of users in our app database. We will use a HIPAA-compliant server protected by [CONTACT_45655]-standard safeguards to prevent unauthorized access. Since we are not associating patient health information with personally identifiable information there would not be a risk of unauthorized release of patient medical data in the event of a security breach. User personal information will be contained behind secured networks and will only be accessible by [CONTACT_473], who will have special access rights to such systems. In addition, all sensitive information users supply will be encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. We will not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer personally identifiable information to outside parties. Our privacy policy will be available within the app for users to view at any time.     Protection against risk resulting from depressive symptoms includes the following: Regarding suicidal ideation and broader mental health concerns, [CONTACT_436908], a licensed clinical psychologist, will take appropriate action as outlined by [CONTACT_165469], NIH, and the State of South Carolina, which may include contact[CONTACT_436900]/or pursuing involuntary commitment at a mental health facility. If participants present no imminent danger but also need more extensive treatment of mental health concerns, they will be given appropriate referrals. As noted above, PHQ-[ADDRESS_737584] any possible clinical deterioration. PHQ-9 data will be monitored using only the participants’ subject numbers. Should a participant evidence clinical deterioration, [CONTACT_436908] will then use the participant database to obtain contact [CONTACT_540514].   Regarding recordings, all interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed with recordings stored on an MUSC secure, password protected server. Recordings will be destroyed within one year of recording. Only IRB approved research staff will have access to recordings. Recordings will be destroyed within [ADDRESS_737585] access to recordings.  14.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects or Others All participants in this trial will receive at minimum treatment as usual. We will not augment treatment as usual as provided by [CONTACT_561312]. The majority of participants will also receive a mobile app developed to improve depressive symptoms, therefore there is a possibility of reduced depressive symptoms through the use of Behavioral Activation for those that receive the Moodivate app. The major benefit to society will be whether a proactive identification + DMHI approach improves depression treatment outcomes relative to TAU for ILLIC. Potential issues of clinical deterioration, confidentiality, data security, and frustration are a high priority and will be closely monitored throughout the study. Consequently, the risk to benefit ratio in the proposed study appears to be acceptable.  15.0 Sharing of Results with Subjects Study outcomes will not be shared with subjects.

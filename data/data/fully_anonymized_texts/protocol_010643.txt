 6 2  INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 STUDY R ATIONALE   
 
Rates of depression in children and adolescents are substantial (Basta et al., 2022) , and prevalence is 
steadily increasing (Hawes et al., 2021). Challenges to the treatment of depressive disorders in youth 
include a dearth of  trained providers , treatment cost, and imperfect treatment response with ~30% -60% 
failing to respond to gold standard treatments (TADS, 2004). These daunting challenges necessitate the 
development of preventative intervention s to reduce subclinical depressive symptoms in children and 
adolescents before  full-blown, clinical depression  develops . Given links between depressive symptoms 
and low leve ls of cognitive control, video -game -based  cognitive control training may serve as a low-cost, 
accessible, and suitable strategy for improv ing emotion regulation , lessen ing subclinical  symptoms, and 
thereby  [CONTACT_9123][INVESTIGATOR_9096]. The video -game intervention assessed in the 
current study is called EndeavorRx . Cognitive control training through EndeavorRx  will target cognitive 
and affective domains, with the goal of improving cognitive control /emotion regulation  and thus reducing 
depressive symptoms.  
 
2.2 BACKGROUND   
2.2.1  SUBCLINICAL DEPRESSION IS  PREVALENT I N YOUTH , INCREASES RISK 
FOR FULL DEPRESSIVE DISORDER AND LONG -TERM  IMPAIRMENT ; 
BETTER INTERVENTIONS ARE NEEDED.  
 
Depressi ve disorders  are extremely common , beginning at peripuberty, with youth who experienced 
anxiety disorders at younger ages at especially high risk for depression in  adolescen ce (Kessler et al., 2001; 
Basta et al., 2022). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_9097] a decade ago (~10% for 
depression and ~30% for anxiety; Merikangas et al., 2010), rates of depression and anxiety have continued 
to rise during the course of the COVID -19 pandemic (Hawes et al., 2021). Depression symptoms are often 
evident  at young  ages, and if left untreated, can lead to significant impairment in social, educational, and 
familial domains  (e.g., school dropout, unemployment, social isolation, and suicide; Rapaport et al., 2005 ). 
Further, having symptoms of these disorders increases risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_9098]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_9099], such as CBT,  many children 
are left without care. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9100], and treatments like CBT are 
resource -intensive, putting a significant  time-burden on  patients, their  families , and the clinicians (Rasing 
et al., 2017). There are not enough providers or resources to reach all the children and adolescents with 
depression and/or anxiety, even when considering that many youth and their families will not to seek 
treatment in the first place (Planey et al., 2019; Reinert et al., 2021). Moreover, o nce a depressive disorder 
sets in, full remission following treatment is difficult to achieve, and as many as ~30 -60% continue to 
experience clinically significant symptoms even after receiving treatment (TADS, 2004).  
Prior research on youth depression has focused mostly on patients with diagnosed, clinical depression. 
However, depressive symptoms also exist at the subclinical level. For instance, estimates indicate that more 
than 20% of adolescents experience subclinic al depressive symptoms (Wickrama et al., 2009); these youth 
have symptoms of depression but do not meet the diagnostic criteria that would indicate a full clinical 
diagnosis. Although youth who are suffering from subclinical symptoms are often absent from  published 
prevalence estimates of depression, their impact on society and the healthcare system is hardly invisible . A 
recent study in Dutch youth found that the associated costs of subclinical  depressive symptoms in 
adolescents in the Netherlands was equivalent to about $235 million annually (Bodden et al., 2022). In 
Video Game to Target Subclinical Depressive Symptoms in Youth                            Version 2.2  
Protocol #: HUM00227345                [ADDRESS_8421] the onset of clinical  depression (Cuijpers et al., 2014; 
Garber & Weersing, 2010). Having an  anxiety disorder diagnosis is also a risk factor for developi[INVESTIGATOR_9101]; these disorders are highly comorbid, though anxiety typi[INVESTIGATOR_9102] (Kalin, 2021). To prevent the development of clinical depression in child ren and adolescents, 
depressive symptoms should be intervened upon at the subclinical level. However, in order to be effective, 
the preventative in tervention needs to be accessible, low -cost, and feasible without the use of clinician 
resources.    
2.2.[ADDRESS_8422] attention towards regulating emotions and behaviors , 
and can be measured by [CONTACT_9124] a high cognitive demand (Joorman & Vanderlind, 2014; Muris et al., 
2008). Accumulating evidence indicates that are there cognitive control behavioral deficits in youth with 
depression and anxiety (Han et al., 2016;  Keller et al., 2019; Kertz  et al., 2016),  a dysfunction that is 
observed at the neurobiological  level as well. For example, c ognitive control is facilitated by a network of 
regions across superior parietal, lateral, and medial prefrontal cortex , sometimes referr ed to as the 
frontoparietal network (FPN; Zanto & Gazzaley, 2013 ). In youth with anxiety, as compared to health y 
youth, there is hypo -activity of the FPN during cognitive control demanding tasks (Fitzgerald et al., 2013 ). 
Additionally, a meta -analysis of studies assessing major depressive disorder identified hypo -connectivity 
of the FPN as compared to healthy individuals (Kaiser et al., 2015). One model of depression in youth 
postulates that lower cognitive control capacity confers risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_9103]; when challenging 
life events occur, those with lower cognitive control capacity are less able to implement effective emotional 
regulation, leading to worse symptoms (Joorman & Vanderlind, 2014; Tajik -Parvinchi et  al., 2020). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_9104] (Han et al., 
2016), no preventative interventions for subclinical depression have been developed  that specifically  target 
cognitive control. The current project will assess  a novel, low -cost and accessible preventative intervention 
that trains cognitive control, with the goal of reducing subclinical depression symptoms.   
2.2.3  A VIDEO GAME (ENDEAVORRX) MIGHT IMPROVE COGNITIVE CONTROL 
AND THEREFORE REDUCE DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS  
 
The intervention used in the current study is  EndeavorRx , a video game  that has been demonstrated to 
improve cognitive control in youth (Kollins et al., 2020) . EndeavorRx  is designed specifically to improve 
attention and cognitive control  and is FDA approved to support the treatment of Attention -
Deficit /Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD ; Davis et al., 2018; Kollins et al., 2020). In studies of ADHD -
affected youth , the benefits of EndeavorRx  on cognitive control appear to be maintain ed over time . 
Specifically, following EndeavorRx training , ADHD symptom reduction is maintained over a three year 
span (Jurigova et al., 2021). Though untested in youth with subclinical depressive symptoms, a recent study 
found that EndeavorRx led to improvements in cognitive control in adults with clinical depression (Keefe 
et al., 2022). Based on this convergence of evidence, we hypothesize that EndeavorRx  will increase  
cognitive control and thereby [CONTACT_9125] -affected youth. This hypothesis  
is further supported by [CONTACT_9126] -
play cognitive training intervention in anxious preschoolers improved cognitive control and reduced anxiety 
symptoms (Sc hroder et al., 2022 ), which commonly precede depressive symptoms at later ages.

 8 2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT   
2.3.1  KNOWN  POTENTIAL RISKS  
 
1)  Risk of boredom or fatigue  (likely) . Participants may become tired or bored during the  intervention, 
assessments , and computerized cognitive testing.  
To minimize risk: Participants will be allowed breaks in between testing sections  and game -play is 
completed for no more than 25 minutes/day . 
2) Loss of confidentiality around sensitive information (rare).  
To minimize risk: All subjects are assigned research numbers, and all research information collected 
is linked to the subject only by [CONTACT_9127]. Great care is taken to remove all identifying information 
from research records. A single tracking file conta ins links to the research records and subject codes. 
Recruitment tracking files are kept only for the duration of recruitment.  Any p aper records are kept 
in locked file drawers in a locked room, to which only authorized research personnel have access. 
Any paper records with identifying information (consent form, payment records) are kept in locked 
file cabinets, physically separate from the research records. Computer records with identifying 
information are kept on secure, password protected servers. Staff m embers are trained to 
scrupulously protect the confidentiality of sensitive information, and take care to limit the printing of 
documents with identifying information and to avoid unnecessary discussion of subject names. 
Screening forms for subjects who d o not qualify for the study will be destroyed, except for 
anonymous information unlinkable to the subjects (such as age, gender, and education).  
However, if a subject may become eligible in the near future, e.g. they need to wait 1 month after a 
recent medication change, we will retain certain records so as not to repeat the assessments, with the 
assent of the potential participant.  
3)  Worsening of depressive symptoms, including suicidal thoughts plans, intentions or behaviors.  
Depressive symptoms may worsen during the course of the participation in the study, including the 
emergence of suicidality. During the screening period  in Assessment 1 , suicidal thoughts, plans, 
intentions and behaviors will be assessed with the Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale – Screen 
Version (C-SSRS ). If assessment uncovers suicidal plans or intentions or recent behaviors, 
emergency evaluation will occur, and an appropriate plan of action will be followed, e.g. safety plan 
will be created and refer ral to psychiatric emergency room.  Subjects will not continue to be enrolled 
in the study if any items on the C -SSRS are endorsed during the  screening period  of Assessment 1 . 
Therefore, any potential participant with suicidal thoughts or behaviors will be excluded from the 
study. Suicidal thoughts will also be assessed after the 4 -week intervention and (if applicable) at a 3 -
month follow up through items on the CDI and CDSRS. If these items are endorsed, then evaluation 
will occur, followed by [CONTACT_9128] e plan of action (as stated above). If symptoms worsen during 
the course of participation, but not to the level of suicidal thoughts, plans, intentions or behaviors , 
the participant may be withdrawn  (see 7.1 below).

cognitive  control  training (CCT). It is also possible that participants may not derive any direct benefit from 
participating in the study. Please refer to section 2.2.[ADDRESS_8424] intervention.

 9 2.3.3  ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
The risks associated with this study are no greater than those associated with usual clinical management of 
subclinical depression and anxiety in children and adolescents.  The proposed experiment could  reveal 
important information about the nature of mental processes involved in the pathophysiology of subclinical 
depression and anxiety . It is expected that this information may indirectly lead to the development of better 
forms of  preventative intervention for depression and for  treatment for anxiety and/or depression . There is 
no other, safer or less -invasive means of answering the questions posed by [CONTACT_9129].  
Strategy has been made to minimize each risk, respectively.  
 
[ADDRESS_8425] 
will result in increased 
cognitive control 
capacity , which will also 
relate to reductions in 
depressive symptoms .  Enhanced cognitive

regulate symptoms, 
thus lowering 
symptoms and 
reducing risk of

4 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 OVERALL  DESIGN  
 
We hypothesized that cognitive training EndeavorRx  may augment cognitive control and reduce 
depressive symptoms. In this study, youth with subclinical depressive symptoms (ages 9 to 17) will be 
recruited to complete the CCT intervention for 4 -weeks. Before and after the intervention, all participants 
will complete semi -structured clinical assessment of depressive symptoms and a computerized evaluation 
of cognitive control capacity (e.g., Millisecond Inquisit Web Cognitive Battery ; Zelazo, Anderson, Richler, 
Wallner -Allen, and Beaumont, 2013)  
Recruitment will leverage a well -characterized sample from a recently completed study (“Parent 
study” ; HUM00118950 ) of clinically significant anxiety, a known risk factor for emergence of later 
depressive symptoms in the subclinical -to-clinical range.  In the Parent study,  148 youths (7 -17 years) 
with impairing anxiety were  recruited and randomized 2:1 to receive 12 -week CBT or a non -active 
control therapy, “relaxation and mentorship therapy” (RMT); behavioral, neurobiological ( fMRI ), and 
clinical measures  were collected before and after treatment. Additional participants may need to be 
recruited beyond the “Parent study” sample (for reasons such as: slow recruitment from “Parent study” or 
not enough participants from “Parent study” meeting enrollment criteria).  
Up to thirty subjects  from the Parent study will be recruited to complete the EndeavorRx  intervention.  
The intervention will be played  at home  for ~25  min/day) , 5x per week,  for 4 weeks . Designed as an 
exciting, youth -friendly computer game, EndeavorRx engages and trains cognitive control across 
component processes of attention, response inhibition, shifting and working memory. Of note, EndeavorRx 
game difficulty is titrated to individual performance, and thus age; the increasing difficulty helps to reduce 
participant boredom and progressively train cognitive control.  Adherence to prescribed training will be 
monitored using an Akili -provided dashboard, available to the research study team, that interfaces real -time 
as participants access EndeavorRx via their iPads. If there is no game play for ≥[ADDRESS_8429] work , including 
UMHealthResearch . The proposed study  will add up to three additional timepoints of assessment (pre -
intervention, post -intervention, and (if applicable) 3-months post -intervention. All study activities will be 
completely remotely via an encrypted HIPAA -compliant video conferencing platform (e.g., Zoom), phone

 11 call, and/or Qualtrics links.  Depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, general psychopathology, and 
cognitive control behavior as  indexed by a Millisecond Inquisit Web  Cognitive Battery  will be assessed 
pre-intervention. After the intervention, the same symptoms and cognitive control behavioral will be 
assessed. These variables will optionally  be assessed  again  3-months post intervention.  
Data analyses will compare pre - and post -CCT  data. Additionally, multilevel models will assess change 
in depressive symptoms and cognitive control over time and comparing between those who received CBT 
as compared to those who received  RMT in the Parent study. These data will include Millisecond  measures 
of behavioral capacity for cognitive control  and detailed assessment of  depressive and  anxiety symptoms 
using both clinician -interview and self -report. Pre - to post -CCT  change in  depressive symptom  severity 
(clinician -measured) will serve as the primary o utcome variable .  
 
At protocol version 2.1 (02 April 2024), Assessment #3 (3 -month follow -up) was removed to increase 
feasibility so that resources could focused on increased recruitment .

control after the [ADDRESS_8432] intervention.  
4. If applicable, e xamine whether the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in a previous 
intervention and protocol have been maintained at a [ADDRESS_8433] 4 -weeks of video game play (for 25 minutes/day , 5 
days/week) .The EndeavorRx  video game is designed to target focused attention, response inhibition, 
working memory and multiple simultaneous attention to constitute a general executive function training, 
and activate neural systems associated with executive function/cognitive control. All video game play will 
be done remotely, at -home, via iPad . iPads will have EndeavorRx preloaded  or downloaded onto a personal 
iPad, which participants will access through a unique username [CONTACT_2383]. Difficulty of the games will 
be titrated individually and by  [CONTACT_9130], which we hypothesize will subsequently reduce depressive symptoms. Prior 
clinical trials have administered EndeavorRx  for this duration and frequency (4 weeks, 25 minutes/day, 5 
days/week) in youth (Kollins et al., 2020).

 13 Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in this study  but are not subsequently 
assigned to the study intervention or entered in the study. Individuals  who do not meet the criteria for 
participation in this trial (screen failure) because of meeting one or more exclusion criteria that are likely 
to change over time may be rescreened. Rescreened participants will be assigned the same participant 
number as for the initial screening.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_8439], we may also reach out to parents via text message (using a prepared and approved message 
template) to direct their attention to their voicemail or email, and request to schedule a phone screen. Parents 
of potential participants will be con tacted  from the sample of eligible participants of the Parent study until 
target enrollment of the current protocol is reached.  If it is decided to recruit from outside of the Parent 
study, those new participants will be not be contact[CONTACT_9131] t message to complete the phone screen, as we 
will not have access to their contact [CONTACT_9132]. Only participants from the Parent study (who 
had consented to be re -contact[CONTACT_9133]) will be contact[CONTACT_9134]).  
 Participants from the Parent study were initially  recruited  to the Parent study  from outpatient 
psychiatry programs at the University of  Michigan Health System, from multi -media advertisements 
(UMClinicalStudies.org, passive advertisements on social media sites and Craigslist Ann Arbor, Google 
Adword campaigns, print and electronic media, radio ads and flyers) and by [CONTACT_9135] y 
clinicians. Participants from the Parent study can be enrolled in the current protocol if they previously 
endorse d elevated depressive symptoms during the Parent study and do not possess any of the exclusionary 
criteria.  Initial screening will occur in a telephone interview. Participants can enroll in the study from 
anywhere in the [LOCATION_002], as all aspects of the study protocol will be completed remotely. Based on 
the demographic characteristics of the sample with elevated depressive symptoms  (CDI T -scores > 50)  
from in the Parent study, we anticipate that the sample of the current protocol will be primarily comp osed 
of youth that identify as female (90%) and are Caucasian (75%).  
If needed to reach recruitment goals, new participants may be recruited through multi -media 
advertisements (UM HealthResearch .org, passive advertisements on social media sites, print and 
electronic media, and flyers). If additional recruitment is conducted, recruitment of male youth and youth 
from unrepresented racial and ethnic groups will be prioritized. Additionally, r ecruitment outside of the 
Parent study will be restricted to potential participants who live in the state of Michigan, in order to 
ensure that an iPad can be provided to participants  (via drop -off, pi[INVESTIGATOR_9107], or mail delivery)  if they do not 
already have access to one.  Interested participants (i.e. , as indicated on UMHealthResearch) will fill out 
several pre-screen eligibility questions on UMHealthResearch. If eligible based on the se pre-screening 
questions, participants will be contact[CONTACT_9136].  
Minimizing the potential for coercion of patients to participate : Because members of the research team are 
involved in clinical care and research, there is the potential that some patients of the study team may be 
recruited.  It will be made clear to all potential subjects that participation is entirely optional and no t a part 
of regular treatment.  The bulk of the recruitment process will occur with the study coordinator, who does 
not treat patients in any of the clinical venues where recruitment will occu r. Overall, the research team is 
experienced in clinical research and very mindful of the conflict between the dual roles of clinician and 
researcher.  They firmly believe that the safety and desires of the patient take precedence over any research 
protoco l, and work hard to assure their patients that research participation is not required for treatment.  In

Payment of participants  
 
In the current protocol, participants will  receive the following payments:  
1. After completing Assessment #1 (including semi -structured interview, Millisecond  battery , and 
self-report clinical measures), participants will earn $50. If participants screen out during 
Assessment 1, participants will receive up to $50 for their participation (according to the time spent 
completing the assessment; up to 2 hrs ($25), up to 4 hours (the full $50).  
2. After completing one half of the CCT training (2 weeks), participants will earn an additional $25.  
3. Once the full training has been completed ([ADDRESS_8440] 80% compliance), participants will 
earn another $25.  
4. *After completing Assessment #2, participants will earn another $25.  
5. **For those who have  complet ed Assessment #[ADDRESS_8441] -intervention, participants earn an 
additional  $25.  
 
Therefore, if all three assessments are completed in addition to the full EndeavorRx intervention, each 
participant will receive  a total of $150. All participants will have the opportunity to earn the same amount 
of compensation  (if completed Assessment #3) . Incentives are structured to promote retention of 
participants throughout the full intervention period, as well as for Assessment  #3 (if applicable) . Payment 
for all enrolled participants will be made in up to two  payments: at payment step # 4* and again  at 
payment step # 5**, if all activities completed . If participants screen out during Assessment 1, they will be 
provided payment after screening out.  The participant  will receive the incentive  directly . If a participant 
withdraws from the study or does not complete certain parts of the study, payment will be distributed for 
the amount earned at the point of  study discontinuation. If a participant does not complete at least [ADDRESS_8442] -intervention assessments.

ADMINISTRATION  
 
6.1.1  STUDY INTERVENTION  OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  DESCRIPTION  
 
The EndeavorRx video game is a digital therapeutic designed to improve attention and related cognitive 
control processe s by [CONTACT_9138] t. The video game design displays two tasks that are 
to be completed in parallel, which requires multitasking and thus cognitive control. Task performance is 
assessed during  single and interference (multitask) conditions.  Difficulty of the game is titrated, in real 
time, to adapt to the individual’s performance. The game -player makes progress by [CONTACT_9139] r ewards and 
thus unlocking new environments. P eriodic recalibration occurs t hroughout gameplay t o maintain an 
optimal difficulty level. This feature of the game helps to avoid participant boredom and progressively 
activate the functional systems underlying cognitive control. EndeavorRx  is similar to other cognitive 
training intervention games used in prior research and are well -tolerated by [CONTACT_9140]  
(Keefe et al., 2022) .

Computerized cognitive training : The CCT intervention will consist of ~ 25 minutes of EndeavorRx video 
gameplay per day  (at any time of the day) , for 5 days/week, for 4 weeks. This is the duration of gameplay 
used in prior studies of the EndeavorR x game  (Kollins et al., 202 0) and the dose suggested by [CONTACT_9141] . Participants will be instructed to try not to play the game for more than [ADDRESS_8443]  about game instructions . All participants will also be provided with the same 
instruction manual .

There is no randomization in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
6.4 STUDY INTERVENTION /EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  ADHERENCE  
 
Tolerability and compliance with the intervention will also be assessed. The CCT application will 
measure the amount of time each day that the child spends playing the video game. Additionally, 
completion of self -report questionnaires and Millisecond  assessments will be tracked to ensure that these 
assessments are completed within the specified time period. If the cognitive task battery and start of the 
cognitive training intervention are not completed within sufficient time of the baseline clinical and self -
report assessment (i.e., within 14 days of completing the CDI; due to scheduling and/or equipment 
constraints), then the CDI and CDRS -R will be re -administered  prior to initiating the cognitive task 
battery and cognitive training.

7.1 DISCONTINUATION  OF STUDY INTERVENTION /EXPERIMENTAL 
MANIPULATION  
 
When a subject discontinues from  CCT  but not  from the study, remaining study procedures will be 
completed as indicated by [CONTACT_4690].   If a clinically sig nificant finding is identified ( including, but 
not limited to changes from baseline) after enrollment, the investigator or quali fied designee will determine 
if any change in participant management is needed.  
 
Discontinuation of study for a given participant will occur  in the event of any of the following:  
• Suicidal thoughts with specific plans and intentions (Endorse item 9 the CDI) 
• The participant is h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_9108]  
• A participant reports s ymptom worsening:  > 25% increased CDI score (referenced to baseline)

Electronic data capture :   
Subjects will complete the  self-report forms described above using Qualtrics .  Qualtrics is an Application 
Service Provider (ASP) with a Software -as-a-Service (SaaS) platform for creating and distributing online 
surveys and related research services. The platform records response data, performs analysis, and reports 
on the data. A ll services are online and require no download software; only modern JavaScript -enabled 
browsers are required (no Java/JVM or Flash). Surveys are usually taken online within a web browser, with 
optional SMS surveys and offline methods available for smartphones/tablets. Qualtrics has been approved 
for the University of Michigan research community, and individual investigators access the web interface 
through a University of Michigan Qualtrics portal. Subjects will receive a coded link via email which will 
take them to the required surveys. The emailed link contains no identifiable information about the subjects, 
and once activated, establishes an https encrypted link with the Qualtric s server. Once completed, each 
survey is locked so that re -access is not permitted. We can also adapt the process for each subject, e.g. 
provide access on computers or tablets in the Department of Psychiatry for subjects who do wish or cannot 
use email. So me subjects may request paper, and, if so, paper forms will be provided.  
Subjects will be asked to complete the consent form online (provided through a secure web -link sent via 
email) via SignNow prior to their initial evaluation. A copy of the consent will be emailed to the subject. 
Data will be downloaded from Qualtrics and stored on protected computers to be used for analysis.

et al. 2007).  A clinician -rated scale assessing suicidal ideation and behavior.  
• Child Depression Inventory  (CDI).  A self -report assessment to rate the severity of depression 
symptoms in children.  Total scores on this measure range from 0 to 54. Symptom  worsening:  > 
25% increased CDI score (referenced to baseline) .  
 
Any safety -related assessments (C -SSRS administered at Assessment #1 ) or primary outcome measure 
(CDI at Assessments #1 or #2 ) that are missed will be reported to the IRB as a protocol deviation. We 
will accept a window of ± 1 week. However, for the other assessments, missing or late assessments will 
not be reported as protocol deviations unless they constitute >  50% of the total assessments. These 
allowances should affect neither the scientific integrity nor the safety monitoring provisions of the 
protocol.  
All SAEs will be:  
• recorded on the appropriate SAE Report Form  
• followed through resolution by a study clinician  
• reviewed and evaluated by a study clinician.

8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
8.3.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
This protocol uses the definition of a dverse event from 21 CFR 312.32 (a): any untoward medical 
occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in humans, whether or not considered intervention -
related . 
Any unfavorable or unintended symptom, sign, or disease associated with a medical treatment or procedure 
that may or may not be related to the treatment or procedure. Adverse events can be related to the 
intervention or to the symptoms that the intervention is intended to act on  (e.g. subclinical depressive 
symptoms ), or to another disorder (e.g. Anxiety), or they could be entirely unrelated to any of these (e.g., 
motor vehicle accident).  
8.3.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
An SAE is defined as an AE that meets one of the following conditions:  
• Death during the period of protocol -defined surveillance  
• Life-threatening event (defined as a subject at immediate risk of death at the time of the event)  
• An event requiring inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9110]  
• Results in congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
Any other important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered a serious adverse experience when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject and may requ ire medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed above.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse/overdose or cancer.  
 
All SAEs will be:  
• recorded on the appropriate SAE Report Form  
• followed through resolution by a study clinician  
• reviewed and evaluated by a study clinician  
 
The study will comply with IRB reporting requirements and guidelines for SAEs.  
 
8.3.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE E VENT  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
 
Video Game to Target Subclinical Depressive Symptoms in Youth                            Version 2.2  
Protocol #: HUM00227345                08 October 2024  
    
 
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 21 For adverse events ( AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will 
be used to describe severi ty.  
 
• Mild  – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant ’s daily 
activities.   
• Moderate  – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. 
Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe  – Events interrupt a participant ’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy 
or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.   Of note, 
the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION /EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  
 
All adverse events ( AEs) will have their relationship to study procedures, including the intervention , 
assessed  by [CONTACT_9152] -trained clinician  based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. 
The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below.  
• Definitely /Probably  Related  – There is  evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other 
possible contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory 
test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to study procedures  administration and is unlikely 
to be explained by [CONTACT_9153]. The response to withdrawal of 
the study procedures  should be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacologically o r 
phenomenologically definit ive. 
• Potentially  Related  – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of study procedures ). However, other factors 
may have contributed to the event (e.g., the participant ’s clinical condition, other concomitant 
events). Although an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be flagged 
as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or “definitely related”, 
as appropriate.  
• Unlikely to be related /Not related  – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, 
whose temporal relationship to study procedures  administration makes a causal relationship 
improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the study 
procedures ) and in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible 
explanations (e.g., the participant ’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments) . Or, the AE is 
completely independent of study procedures administration . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
 
A clinician with appropriate expertise in treating  youth  anxiety and depression will be responsible for 
determining whether an adverse event (AE) is expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered 
unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information 
previously described for the study procedures , as outlined in this document, the consent materials and 
documents related to the video game and its use.

 22  
The occurrence of an adverse event ( AE) or serious adverse event ( SAE ) may come to the attention of study 
personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant  presenting for medical care, or upon 
review by a study monitor.  
 
All AEs , not otherwise precluded per the protocol,  will be captured on the appropriate  case report form  
(CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of 
severit y, relationship to study procedures  (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a 
decision ), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study will be 
documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate re solution , such 
that the participant has been offered or received necessary care . 
 
Any medical or psychiatric condition that is present at the time that the participant  is screened will be 
considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition  deteriorates 
at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at 
each level of severity  to be performed. Documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_9111] . 
 
A study team member will record events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is 
obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation.  At 
each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit. 
Participants and/or their parent can spontaneously notify the investigator of an AE or health status change 
via phone call or email, if necessary, in between scheduled visits. Events will be followed for outcome 
information un til resolution or stabilization.  
 
8.3.5  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
 
The occurrence of an AE may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits . At each visit,  
subjects will be questioned about putative AEs. Information to be collected includes event description, time 
of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity (mild, moderate, or severe), relationship to study (assessed by 
[CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_9112]), expected versus unexpected, local versus systemic, a nd time of 
resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while in the study will be documented appropriately 
regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution. Adverse event reporting will 
occur on the standard IRBMED t imetable.

8.4.1  DEFINITION OF U NANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
This protocol uses the definition of Unanticipated Problems as defined by [CONTACT_9155] ( OHRP).  OHRP considers unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others to 
include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board (IRB) -
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the 
participant population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156]); and  
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
8.4.2   UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM S REPORTING  
 
The investigator will report an other reportable incident or occurrence (ORIO)  to the reviewing Institutional 
Review Board (IRB). The ORIO  report will include the following information:  
 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project number  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an ORIO  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or are 
proposed in response to the ORIO  
 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, U Ps will be reported using the following timeline:

• ORIO s that are serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported to the IRB and to the study 
sponsor/funding agency within 7 calendar days of the investigator becoming aware of the event  
• Any other ORIO  will be reported to the IRB within 7 calendar  days of the investigator becoming 
aware of the problem

9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
 
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
 
Primary Endpoint:  
We hypothesize that CCT will increase cognitive control capacity (Millisecond battery  composite score  
and individual cognitive test scores ) and reduce depressive symptoms  (CDI and CDRS -R scores) over 
the [ADDRESS_8453] -intervention as compared to pre -intervention.  
 
Secondary Endpoint *: 
We hypothesize that CCT will further increase cognitive control capacity (measured by [CONTACT_9157] ) and reduce depressive symptoms (as 
measured by [CONTACT_9158] -R) further [ADDRESS_8454] -intervention to 3 -months after the intervention.  
*Secondary endpoint was optional to participants and then discontinued after protocol version 2.1 (02 April 2024).   
 
Feasibility/Acceptability and Experimental Endpoints :  
1. We hypothesize that the majority of participants will complete the intervention with at least 80% 
compliance.  
2. We hypothesize that participants will have favorable emotions associated with game play.  
3. We hypothesize that depressive symptoms will be reduced from the baseline assessment of the 
Parent study but that they will be slightly elevated from the post -intervention assessment in the 
Parent study.   
 
The statistical tests used to test these hypotheses will be outlined later in this protocol and registered with 
clinicaltrials.gov.  
 
9.2 SAMPLE SIZE  DETERMINATION  
 
Sample size was determined  based on results from a power analysis and feasibility of participant 
recruitment. A sample size of 32 participants would yield 80% power for the planned analyses in the current 
study, but 30 participants is a more achievable initial target for recruitment. Though there is minimal data

Protocol #: HUM00227345                [ADDRESS_8455] sizes to be 
used in future, larger studies.  
 
9.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES  
 
Complete -Case  Analysis Population: This population will consist of enrolled participants  without missing 
data on variables  of interest from Assessment #2 . 
 
Per-Protocol Analysis Dataset: This population will consist of participants who complete all four weeks of 
the intervention (with at least 80% compliance to the guidelines of 25 minutes/day for 5 days a week across 
the 4 weeks. Compliance of 80% can be achieved by [CONTACT_9159] 20 minutes of gameplay on 80% 
of the days that they could play the game in the [ADDRESS_8456] 20 minutes of gameplay for 20 d ays during  the 4 week 
period, a participant with 80% compliance would engage in at least [ADDRESS_8457] 16 
days during this period. Compliance will be assessed using gameplay metrics provided by [CONTACT_9160] e is played on a participant’s device.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_8458] deviation and range will be computed for continuous data (all behavioral data and 
some of the clinical data). In general, statistic al significance is reported based on p < 0.05 two -tailed . 
Missing data from Assessment 3 (if applicable) will be handled using pairwise deletion. Missing data from 
Assessment 1 or 2 will be handled using listwise deletion.  
 
9.4.2  ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT(S)  
 
We hypothesize that CCT will  increase cognitive control capacity and reduce depressive symptoms. The 
hypothesis will be tested using paired samples (repeated measures) t-tests (pre vs. post) for each dependent 
variable (CDI score and Millisecond battery  composite score ). Both of these dependent variables are 
interval variables.  
Standard deviations and effect sizes will be assessed for each of these analyses.  
9.4.3  ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S) * 
 
We hypothesize that CCT will  further  increase cognitive control capacity (measured by [CONTACT_9161] s) and further reduce depressive symptoms (as measured by [CONTACT_9158] -R) 3-months 
post-intervention than immediately after the intervention. This hypothesis will be tested using repeated -
measures ANOVAs, with three timepoints (pre -intervention, immediately post -interven tion, and [ADDRESS_8459] intervention), on behavioral performance (cognitive control capacity) and depressive symptoms.  
 
Standard deviations and effect sizes will be assessed for each of these analyses.  
*Secondary endpoint was optional to participants and then discontinued after protocol version 2.1 (02 April 2024).

participants. If scores are significantly worse at Time 2 than at Time 1 (a significantly higher average CDI 
score  across participants ), then the study may be halted.  Similarly, if greater than one third of the 
participants (~ 7 subjects) withdraw from the study due to symptoms, then the study may be halted. If there 
is no change, or an improvement in CDI scores (lower CDI scores), then the study will continue as planned. 
This interim analysis will be conducted with the intention of maintaining safety of par ticipants, rather than 
for assessing the efficacy of the intervention.  
 
9.4.[ADDRESS_8461] subgroup analyses based on sex 
or race/ethnicity. However, if applicable, in the secondary endpoint models, age and sex may be included 
as covariates. The current analyses will assess the efficacy of the study intervention in youth only (ages 9 -
17).  
 
9.4.[ADDRESS_8462] whether change in cognitive control indices (behavioral  
performance on Millisecond battery ) will associate with change on clinical outcomes ( CDI or CDRS -R

Consent forms describing in detail the study intervention, study procedures, and risks will be  given to the 
participant and electronic  documentation of informed consent will be completed prior to starting the study 
intervention.  The following consent materials are submitted  to IRBMED  with this protocol : Assent Form  
and a Parent -only Consent Form to accompany the child Assent Form.  
  
[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION  
 
The protocol will begin by [CONTACT_9162] (or their parent[s] /guardian[s]  for adolescent subjects) provide 
assent and informed consent . Informed consent will be obtained at the beginning of a remote visit. This 
remote visit will include a review of an oral assent script, assent from the minor subject, and signed 
electronic consent from  their parent/guardian. Electronic informed consent signatures will be collected 
using SignNow. All procedures will adhere to the IRBMED Guidance for use of SignNow for Electronic 
Informed Consent Procedures. Informed consent i s a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s 
agreeing to participate in the study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation. Extensive 
discussion of risks and possible benefits of this  intervention will be provided to the subject/parents. Consent 
forms (written in non -technical language, understandable by [CONTACT_9163]) describing in detail the study interventions/products, study procedures, and risks will be given to the 
subject/parent.  Par ticipants may also be presented with a visual timeline of the tasks that may be involved 
in participating in this study, during the consenting process or at another time during the study, to aid their 
understanding of the process. Upon reviewing the docume nt, one of the investigators (or their designee) 
will explain the research study to the subject/parent and answer any questions that may arise.  
All youth subjects will be given an assent form and/or will be read an assent script by [CONTACT_464]. The parent 
will sign the parental informed consent document prior to any procedures being done specifically for the 
study , besides the  prescreen questions on UMHealthResearch and/or  initial phone screen , which is 
conducted with the parent . Youth subjects  will be asked to sign in the assent box o n the assent form written 
in language that is developmentally appropriate for their understanding of study participation , along with 
parent signature  [CONTACT_9184]. Children under age 10 (age 9) will be read an assent script 
by [CONTACT_9164], but to verbally give assent and study staff will indicate 
their assent and sign the document. If the child wishes to sign, they may do so. For all subjects, parents will 
sign a separate parent consent form. All subjects or their parents may withdraw consent at any time 
throughout the course of the trial. A copy of the  parental  informed consent and child assent documents will 
be given to the subjects for their records.  
The subjects may withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the trial.  The rights and welfare 
of the subjects will be protected by [CONTACT_9165].  NOTE: older teens may become legal adults (i.e., reach 
the age of 18 years) during the course of the study.  If the teen is still actively involved in the study (i.e., 
data collection ongoing), then a new consent form, signed by [CONTACT_9166], w ill be obtained.  However, if the 
teen reaches [ADDRESS_8463] to re -
consent.  This approach is intended to avoid burdening study participants and their parents.    
10.1.2  STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE  
 
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause. 
Reasons for discontinuation will be document, and all outcome assessments will proceed as scheduled, if 
possible. If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the  Principal Investigator ( PI) will promptly

provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension. Study participants will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], as applicable, 
and be informed of changes to study visit schedule.  
 
Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension of CCT include, but are not limited to:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9113]  
• Suicide behaviors during the study period (assessed by  [CONTACT_9167] -intervention)  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants  
• Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable  
 
The s tudy may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, and data quality are addressed ,

10.1.[ADDRESS_8465] by [CONTACT_1697], research staff, and the 
sponsor(s) and funding agency. This confidentiality is extended to the data being collected as part of this 
study. Data that could be used to identify a specific study participant will be held in strict confidence within 
the research team.  No personally -identifiable information from the study will be released to any 
unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the sponsor/funding agency.  
 
All research activities will be conducted virtually, but in as private a setting as possible , so that participants 
feel comfortable to share details about their symptoms to the assessing clinician.  
 
Other  authorized representatives of the sponsor or funding agency, representatives of the Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) , or regulatory agencies  may inspect all documents and records required to be 
maintained by [CONTACT_093], i ncluding but not limited to, medical records (office, clinic, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) and 
pharmacy records for the participants in this study. The r esearch team will permit access to such records.  
 
The study participant’s contact [CONTACT_9168]. At the 
end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure location for as long a period as dictated by 
[CONTACT_3488], Institutional p olicies, or sponsor/funding agency requirements.  
All paper and computer research records will be identified by [CONTACT_9169].  Paper records are stored in a double -locked environment to which only 
authorized study team members have access. The link between subject ID and subject name [CONTACT_9185] a secure study folder (only primary research team members have access; requires Level -2 Login) 
that can only be accessed on computers that are password protected . Consent documents and any ot her 
forms with identifying information will be maintained separately from research data files (identified by 
[CONTACT_9170]).  
 
The assessments in this protocol will ask participants about sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], such as mental illness  and 
substance use. We will inform the consenting parents of minor participants at the beginning of the process 
that we will respect the confidentiality of all participants.  It is important for us to let participants know that 
they can be honest about sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_9114].  However, all 
participants will also be informed about limits to confidentiality.  If we learn that a subject has potential to 
harm him or herself, or another individual, we will break confidentiality and take steps t o prevent harm.  
Similarly, any evidence of potential child abuse will be reported to Child Protective Services.  If we become

If subjects object to data sharing, they have the option of not participating in the research.  Although our 
project does provide a potential direct benefit in the form  of CCT intervention , this intervention  is readily 
available outside of the research protocol.  
In some cases, participants may either be ineligible for the current protocol or be eligible for an additional 
study protocol. In these cases, if participant has indicated in the consent that they would like to be contact[CONTACT_9172], we will shar e their contact [CONTACT_9173], and if eligible, can share some of our data with these investigators to 
assist in their screening and assessment process (per consent form).

regulatory guidelines.  No regular monitoring by [CONTACT_9175].  
 
10.1.7  CLINICAL MONITORING  
 
No additional monitoring is required – the nature  and size of this study does not require additional safety 
monitoring to that provided by [CONTACT_1201].  However, participant well -being will be monitored at both of the  
assessments  (self-report but also clinical assessments with trained clinician) . The study team will check for 
worsening depressive symptoms after the assessment for each participant. Video game play will also be 
monitored by [CONTACT_9176] -being is implicated 
(i.e., not playing enough or playing the video game with extremely high intensity/ frequency). The study 
team will also regularly monitor clinical self -report assessments in Qualtrics (at least 1x/week) to identify 
whether any safety items have been flagged in Qualtrics (Qualtrics will be set up to flag certain self -report 
items if endorsed).   
 
10.1.8  QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL  
 
Quality control ( QC) procedures will be implemented as follows:  
 
Informed consent  --- Study staff will review both the documentation of the consenting process as well as 
a percentage of the completed consent documents.  This review will evaluate compliance with GCP, 
accuracy, and completeness.  Feedback will be provided to the study team to ensure proper consenting  
procedures are followed .

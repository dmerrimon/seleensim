 Protocol Synopsis 
Title:   An International, Randomized, Double -blind, Placebo- controlled, Phase [ADDRESS_32033] Cancer  
Study Phase: 2 
Indication:   Postmenopausal wome n with hormone receptor  (HR) -positive, locally advanced or 
metastatic breast cancer  who have disease progression during or within [ADDRESS_32034] prior endocrine therapy  for 
metasta tic disease  
Primary Objective:   To provide an estimate of the relative efficacy of Arm A (AMG 479 in 
combination with endocrine therapy [exemestane or fulvestrant] versus Arm B (AMG 479 placebo 
in combination with endocrine therapy [exemestane or fulvestrant]) as measured by [CONTACT_32663] ( PFS) hazard ratio. This estimate will be precise enough to provide 
guidance for further development of AMG 479.for use in the planning of a phase 3 study in this 
patient population.   Additionally, this study will provide qualitative estimates of PFS for treatment 
arms A and B.  
Secondary Objectives:  To investigate the effect of AMG  479 compared with placebo when 
administered in combination with exemestane or fulvestrant on:  
• the safety and tolerability  
• the impact to  patient reported outcomes (PROs)  
• the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AMG  479  
• additional efficacy measures including clinical benefit rate, objective response rate, 
duration of response, time to progression (TTP), time-to-response, time- to-treatment 
failure, and survival time  
Exploratory Objectives:   To assess the potential effect of co -administration of AMG 479 and 
endocrine therapy (exemestane or fulvestrant) on the PK of the endocrine therapy (exemestane 
or fulvestrant).  
To investigate the effect of  AMG  479 compared with placebo when administered in combination 
with exemestane or fulvestrant on biomarkers using biochemical analysis of blood and tumor 
samples, including the correlation between biomarker measurements at baseline and/or in 
response to treatment outcomes .  
To investigate the effect of genetic variation in drug metabolism genes, breast cancer genes, and 
drug target genes on treatment outcomes (this part of the study is optional for subjects) . 
Hypothesi s:  This study will provide an estimate of the relative efficacy of AMG 479 in 
combination with endocrine therapy (exemestane or fulvestrant) versus AMG 479 placebo in 
combination with endocrine therapy (exemestane or fulvestrant) as measured by [CONTACT_32664].  Additionally, this study will provide the estimate of PFS for each treatment arm.  
Study Design:   This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, phase 2 study.  Subjects 
will include postmenopausal women with confirmed hormone receptor ( HR)-positive, locally 
advanced or metastatic breast cancer , who have disease progression during or within [ADDRESS_32035] prior endocrine therapy  for 
metastatic disease.  
Based on investigator  discretion, subjects will be prescribed an endocrine therapy of either 
exemestane or fulvestrant to be administered throughout the study.  The study plans to 
randomize 150 subjects in a 2:1 ratio to Arm A: AMG  479 in combination with endocrine therapy 
(exemestane or fulvestrant) or Arm B: placebo in combination with endocrine therapy 
(exemestane or fulvestrant).

  A ®
 At least 45 of the 150 subjects randomized will be required to be prescribed to each endocrine 
therapy (exemestane and fulvestrant). 
Study treatment with AMG 479 or placebo and endocrine therapy (exemestane or fulvestrant) will 
continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, investigator  
discretion, initiation of a new anticancer  treatment, or death.   
Subjects randomized to placebo in combination with endocrine therapy (Arm B) may have the 
opportunity to continue receiving study treatment as  open- label  AMG 479 in combination with the 
endocrine therapy originally prescribed (‘roll over treatment’) upon disease progression.  
In order to safeguard the interest of the study subjects and maintain the study integrity, [COMPANY_010] 
will form an unblinded data review team (DRT) that is external to the study team involved in the 
daily conduct of the study, but internal to [COMPANY_010] to review safety data and efficacy analysis 
results.    
Endpoints:    
Primary:  Progression free survival ( PFS) , as measured by [CONTACT_32665] ( modified RECIST ) per local review  
Secondary :  
• Clinical benefit (complete response, or partial response, or stable disease for ≥ [ADDRESS_32036] per local review), objective response rate (complete 
and partial response as measured by [CONTACT_32666]), duration of 
response, TTP, time -to-response , time -to-treatment failure, and s urvival    
• Incidence of adverse events , abnormal laboratory values, and anti -AMG 479 antibody 
formation  
• PK parameters of AMG 479   
• Breast cancer related symptoms, health related quality of life, and skin toxicity burden  
Exploratory : Objective response by [CONTACT_32667] , biochemical concentration s and 
abundance of drug targets in tumor tissue and blood samples, genetic variations in drug 
metabolism genes and target genes (optional,  separate informed consent required).    
Sample Size:   The study plans to randomize 150 subjects in a 2:1 ratio to Arm A: AMG  479 in 
combination with endocrine therapy (exemestane or fulvestrant) or Arm B: placebo in combination 
with endocrine therapy (exemestane or fulvestrant).

endocrine therapy of either exemestane (25 mg tablets once a day  [QD] by [CONTACT_1966] [PO]) or 
fulvestrant (loading dose [500 mg intramuscular (IM)  on study day 1, then 250 mg IM on study 
day 15] then 250 mg IM on study day 29 and every 28 days  thereafter) to be administered 
throughout the study.  AMG [ADDRESS_32042]:  AMG 479

 Procedures:   Informed consent, radiological assessments including bone scan and CT or MRI 
scans , clinical evaluations, hematology, coagulation factors, chemistry,  HgbA1c , urine analysis, 
AMG  479, PK, biomarker and tumor tissue collection, concomitant medication collection, adverse 
event collection, and completion of PRO  questionnaires.  
Statistical Considerations:   The sample size of 150 subjects randomized in a 2:[ADDRESS_32043] 
versus control (Test: AMG 479 + fulvestrant or exemestane; Control: placebo + fulvestrant or 
exemestane) is intended to generate treatment effect estimates that may aid in the design of a 
potential phase 3 program for AMG 479.  The desired increase in the median PFS, for subjects 
that received AMG 479 in combination with endocrine therapy  that is believed to be clinically 
meaningful is 2 months (with a minimum increase of 1.5 months).  Using a median PFS of 
4 months for the treatment of placebo in combination with endocrine therapy (exemestane or 
fulvestrant), a 2 month absolute increase (50% relative increase) in the median PFS trans lates 
into a hazard ratio of 0.667 [test(n  = 100)/control(n = 50)] and a 1.5 month absolute increase 
(37.5% relative increase) in the median PFS translates into a hazard ratio of 0.727. 
Interim analyses of safety  data will occur at the time [ADDRESS_32044] completed 
treatment administration for 2 months to assess safety and tolerability of the combination of 
AMG  479 or placebo with endocrine therapy (exemestane or fulvestrant).  The DRT, will review 
cumulative safety data and make recommendations regarding study conduct.  An interim analysis 
of efficacy and safety data is planned at the time [ADDRESS_32045] is randomized.  Summary statistics and 
Kaplan -Meier (K -M) plots of PFS by [CONTACT_2939], 80% confidence intervals for the estimated 
hazard ratio and the K -M estimated  proportion of subjects without a PFS event at [ADDRESS_32046] to PFS (using the stratification factors) and to produce an 80% 
confidence interval for the hazard ratio.  
All primary and secondary efficacy analyses will be conducted on the full analysis set .  Subjects 
will be included in the analysis according to their randomized treatment assignment.   The primary 
efficacy analysis will be performed when approximately [ADDRESS_32047] is randomized.   At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, summaries will 
be provided for each safety, efficacy and PRO endpoint.  The primary analysis of PFS will use the 
same methods utilized for the interim analysis of PFS.

 a Endocrine  therapy (exemestane  or fulvestrant ) will be prescribed based on investigator  discretion.   Patients prescribed exeme stane will have 
compliance reviewed and discussed with subject if needed at every clinic visit.  
b Clinical evaluation, including physical exam performed, and ECOG status   
c Height will only be collected at screening.  Weight will be required pre -infusio n to access the IVRS to obtain box assignment, quantity of vials 
and the volume of AMG 479 or placebo for infusion.  
d Vitals, include blood pressure and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], pulse, and temperature.  
e  Blood chemistry will be analyzed at the local laboratory  and will include: sodium, potassium, chloride, creatinine, CO 2, BUN, AST, ALT, 
alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin.   Additionally fasting/non- fasting glucose will be assessed (fasting: screening, day 1 of cycles 1- 4 then 
every second cycle, roll over treatment assessment [if applicable], and safety follow -up; non -fasting: day 15 of cycles 1- 4, and day 1 cycle 5, 
then every second cycle)  
f Either serum creatinine or calculated creatinine clearance (by [CONTACT_32670] -Gault formula)  
g These laboratory assessments do not need to be performed on cycle  1 day  1 if they were performed during screening within 7 days of 
initiation of treatment  
h Blood collections for PK analysis will occur for AMG 479 (pre- and post -AMG 479 infusion thru cycle 3), for exemestane (only for subjects 
prescribed exemestane; pre- and post -exemestane administration thru cycle 3), and for fulvestrant (only for subjects prescribed fulvestrant; 
pre-fulvestrant IM injection only thru cycle 3).  No PK sample collection is needed for post -fulvestrant IM injection.  Thereafter, blood collection 
for PK analysis of AMG 479, exemestane, and fulvestrant will only occur pre- dose every  
[ADDRESS_32051] bon e scans performed  every 11 to 12 weeks thereafter while on study  
treatment .  Subjects with a negative bone Scans will not be required to continue this procedure.   Confirmatory bone images at baseline (CT 
with bone windows or MRI) at baseline and on during study treatment are required for positive areas on baseline bone scan as specified in 
Section 7.1.[ADDRESS_32052] th is analyte analyzed while on 
study.  The tumor marker selected at screening should remain the same throughout the study.  Subjects with a tumor marker CA 15-3 or 
CA 27-29 within normal ranges at screening will not be required to continue this procedure.  
l Tumor Sample (archived block, slides or fresh tissue collected for clinical care purposes) are to be obtained.  A paraffin tumor block or fresh 
tissue from the most recent tumor tissue is preferred.  
m PRO questionnaires should be completed before any other study procedures and before the patient is informed of their disease status  
n Subjects will have a roll over visit, before initiating open -label AMG 479.  This visit will allow assessment of roll over eligibility and will serve as 
the new baseline from  which all changes will be compared.  All subsequent visits and assessments will be performed according to the regular 
schedule of assessments continuing with the next per protocol visit after the last completed visit that occurred during blind ed treatment . 
o Safety FU - Safety follow -up visit is to be completed [ADDRESS_32053] enrolled into the study to evaluate overall survival and disease status.

Version 0 6 of the LPCN 1021 -18-001 study protocol was developed to make the following 
changes to the study:  
• The primary endpoint of the study was changed from change in average daytime systolic 
blood pressure to change in av erage 24 -hour systolic blood pressure based on the recent 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA ) public workshop on ambulatory blood pressure 
monitoring studies  (“Evaluating the Pressor Effects of Drugs and Ambulatory Blood 
Pressure Monitoring Studies”).  The public wo rkshop noted that the primary endpoint for 
ABPM studies should be the change in 24 -hour average blood pressure.  
• Changed the Development Phase  of the study protocol  from Phase 1 to Phase 3.  The 
FDA’s Division of Bone, Reproductive  and Urologic Products not ed that although 
Protocol  LPCN 1021 -18-001 listed the Development Phase  of the study as Phase 1, the 
study  design  is not consistent with the definition of a Phase  1 study in 
21 CFR  Part 312.21 .  The Division requested that Lipocine change the designated 
Development Phase  to be consistent with the CFR.  Based on the CFR study descriptions, 
the Development Phase  for Protocol  LPCN 1021 -18-001 was changed to Phase 3.

This is a n open -label, multicenter, single arm study evaluating the  BP changes from baseline 
(Visit 3) to post -treatment (Visit 5)  assessed by [CONTACT_351141] 1021 treated a dult hypogonadal 
male subjects .  
The study is comprised of six scheduled visits: Visit 1 and 2 are for screening, Visit  3 is 
scheduled on Day -4 (±2 day) to assess subject’s baseline BP and PR via ABPM.  Visit [ADDRESS_436481]’s post-treatment  BP and PR via ABPM .  Visit 6 is to perform exit procedures.  
There are two confinement visits during the study of approximately 30 hours each (prior to start 
of the dosing and at the end of the study).  The study visits are d escribed below.  
Visit 1 & 2: Subjects will undergo a screening period to complete the pre -study examinations 
and to confirm  their hypogonadal status. Serum total testosterone (T)  below lab normal range  
based on two consecutive blood samples obtained betwee n 6 and 10 AM, on two separate days at 
approximately the same time of day, following an appropriate washout of current androgen 
replacement therapy will be used for screening T levels.  
MRI -1 (Window: any time between Visit 2 and Visit 4) : The MRI -1 baseli ne MRI -PDFF 
measurement will be performed between Visit 2 and Visit 4 in a subset of study subjects 
(approximately 20 or more subjects).  Following confirmation of a subject’s hypogonadal status 
at Visit 2, sites will schedule a MRI -[ADDRESS_436482] Visit 4  at the time of Version 04 implementation . 
Visit 3: The morning of Visit 3 (Day -4), hypogonadal men meeting the inclusion criteria and 
none of the exclusion criteria will be confined for approximately [ADDRESS_436483]’s vital signs (oral temperature, Clinic BP and PR) , with the subject seated  
at rest with back support for at least 10 minutes  prior to vital sign mea surement . Following this 
measurement , subjects will be started on the 24 -hour ABPM portion  of the study , starting at 
7:[ADDRESS_436484] with a 
meal, and then affix a validated, 510(k)  cleared,  portable ABPM  device to the subject’s arm; the 
device will record the subject’s BP and PR over [ADDRESS_436485]’s ABPM data ar e valid based on the ABPM Data Criteria provided in 
Section  Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring .  Subjects with valid recorded ABPM data will 
proceed to Visit 4; subjects who do not have valid ABPM data may choose to repeat Visit [ADDRESS_436486]  
Salt Lake City, UT -[ZIP_CODE]  
 
Date: 19 February 2019  Confidential  Page 9 of 50 Visit 4: Subjects with valid ABPM data will return to the clinic for study enrollment.  The 
morning (6 – 10 AM) of Visit 4 (Day 1 of treatment), eligible subjects will return to the clinic, 
where staff wi ll dispense study drug.   
Investigation Drug Product Resupply ( Day 60; Window Day 30 to Day 60 ): subjects will return 
to the clinic  for a resupply of study drug.   Sites will record the day of the study drug resupply, 
and batch number of the study drug prov ided to the subject.  
MRI -2 (Window: any time between Day 56  and Day 76 , inclusive ): The MRI -2 interim MRI -
PDFF measurement will be performed between Visit 4 and Visit 5 in subjects who had a baseline 
MRI -PDFF measurement (MRI -1).  Sites will schedule MRI -[ADDRESS_436487]’s MRI -1. 
Visit 5: The Visit 5 (Day 107, window ± 7 days) schedule involves collecting a blood sample, 
providing meals to subject s, dosing the study medication and ABPM measurements.  
The visit starts on Day [ADDRESS_436488] a  
single blood sample from the subjects  (at approximately [ADDRESS_436489]-morning  dose on Day 106). 
Following the blood sample collection, subjects will remain at the site until completion of 
ABPM  on Day 108 (on site duration: ~45 hours) . For subjects who are not able to remain in the 
site for the 45-hour duration, blood sam ple may be collected at approximately 3 hours after the 
evening dose  of Day 106 (on site duration  at least 33 hours) .  
On the morning of Day 107 prior  to start of the ABPM , vital signs ( oral temperature, Clinic BP 
and PR) will be measured when seated at rest with back support for 10 minutes.  Subjects will 
then be provided with the study medication approximately 30 minutes after a meal.  Following 
the administration of study drug , subjects will be started on the 2 4-hour ABPM portion  of the 
study , starting at 7:00 AM . For the 24 -hour ABPM portion  of the study , the site will  affix a 
validated, 510(k)  cleared  portable ABPM device to the subject’s arm; the device will record the 
subject’s BP and PR over 24 -hours. Durin g the ABPM confinement visit, the subjects will be 
administered study drug every 12 hours with meal ( evening of Day 106, morning and evening of 
Day 107, morning of Day 108 prior to exiting site) . Following the 24 -hour ABPM period, 
subjects will exit the cl inic.  All s ubjects will be instructed to continue taking their study 
medication.  Subjects with valid recorded ABPM data  at Visit 5  will proceed to Visit 6 for exit 
procedures  after completing the MRI -2 measurement described below ; subjects who do not hav e 
valid ABPM data may choose to repeat Visit 5. 
MRI -3 (Window: any time between Visit 5 and Visit 6): Following the second ABPM 
measurement at Visit 5, subjects who had a baseline MRI -PDFF measurement  (MRI -1) will have 
a post-treatment  MRI -PDFF  (MRI -3).  Sites will schedule MRI -[ADDRESS_436490]’s MRI -1. 
Visit 6: The Visit 6 (Day 1 10, window ± 10 days) schedule involves  exit procedures, including 
return of study medication, vital signs measurement (oral temperat ure, Clinic BP and PR), a

LPCN 1021 (TU) is an oral capsule developed for use in the proposed indication of replacement 
therapy in males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous T due to 
primary or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.  
Testosterone is an endog enous androgen that is responsible for normal growth and development 
of the male sex organs and for maintenance of secondary sex characteristics. Testosterone has 
effects that include the growth and maturation of the prostate, seminal vesicles, penis, and 
scrotum; the development of male hair distribution, such as facial, pubic, chest, and axillary hair; 
laryngeal enlargement; vocal cord thickening; alterations in body musculature; and fat 
distribution. Dihydrotestosterone is another androgen endogenously p roduced in the body. 
Testosterone and DHT are necessary for the normal development of secondary sex 
characteristics.  
The Endocrine Society defines hypogonadism in men as “a clinical syndrome that results from

the hypothalamus (or pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]) to produce sufficient gonadotropi[INVESTIGATOR_2115] (i.e., follicle stimulating 
hormone [FSH] and luteinizing hormone [LH]).  The [ADDRESS_436508] -pass metabolism.2  The only oral produc t currently used

been marketed for more than  20 years outside of the US and is available in more than  80 
countries, including Canada ( as Andriol), for the treatment of male hypogonadism .4  
The LPCN 1021 clinical developme nt program included eight Phase 1 studies and three Phase 3 
studies .  In previous clinical studies (Study LPCN 1021 -05-001 and Study LPCN 1021 -09-001), 
various oral TU formulations were evaluated. All formulations increased T concentrations in 
postmenopaus al female and hypogonadal male subjects. Two formulations (07 and 10) were 
further evaluated in a single ascending dose study in hypogonadal males ( Study S361.1.001 ). 
Single doses administered ranged from 75 mg to 225 mg, and all doses for both formulation s 
achieved T Cmax values at or slightly above the eug onadal range . In a multiple ascending dose 
study (Study M12 -778), LPCN [ADDRESS_436511]  is taken  with food compared  to 
fasting.  However, s ystemic  exposure  of T following  administration of LPCN  1021 with  varying  
fat contents  was evaluated  and the data demonstrated  that there  was no significant  influence  of 
varying fat content  on T levels.   
The Phase 3 Study LPCN 1021 -13-001 provides safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic for a 
titrated dose  of LPCN 1021 as a T replacement therapy in men with primary and secondary 
hypogonadism.  Results indicate that a starting  dose of 225  mg BID, with titration to 150 mg or 
300 mg LPCN 1021 based on a pharmacokinetic algorithm, was effective in restoring T levels of 
hypogonadal men to the eugonadal  range when taken with a meal.  
The Phase 3 Study LPCN 1021 -16-002 provides safety , efficacy, and pharmacokinetic data for a 
fixed dose of LPCN 1021 as a T replacement therapy in men with primary and secondary 
hypogonadism.  R esults indicate that a twice daily fixed dose of 225 mg  taken with a meal  is

Change in average daytime, nighttime, and average 24 -hour diastolic BP and PR assessed by 
[CONTACT_351140]  3 to Visit  5.  
Change in morning systolic and diastolic  BP and PR measured in triplicate  at the clinic (“Clinic 
BP and PR ”) from Visit  3 to Visit  5.  
Change in patient reported sexual desire and sexual distress from baseline to Visit  5. 
Change in Magnetic Resonance Imaging -Proton Density Fat Fraction (MRI -PDFF)  from MRI -1 
(baseline ) to MRI -2 (interim) and to MRI -3 (post-treatment ) in all subjects with baseline , 
interim,  and post -treatment MRI -PDFF measurements, those with a MRI -PDFF measurement of 
>5% at ba seline, and those with a MRI -PDFF measurem ents of >10% at baseline.  
12.0 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
12.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a n open -label, multicenter, single arm study evaluating the BP changes from baseline 
(Visit 3) to post -treatment (Visit 5)  assessed by [CONTACT_29642] M in LPCN 1021 treated a dult hypogonadal 
male subjects .  
The study is comprised of six scheduled visits: Visit 1 and 2 are for screening, Visit 3 is 
scheduled on Day -4 (±2 day) to assess subject’s baseline BP and PR via ABPM.  Visit [ADDRESS_436514]  
Salt Lake City, UT -[ZIP_CODE]  
 
Date: [ADDRESS_436515]’s post-treatment  BP and PR via ABPM .  Visit 6 is to perform exit visit procedures.  
There are two confinement visits during the study , one  prior to start of the dosing and another at 
the end of the study.   The study visits are described below.  
Visit 1 & 2: Subjects will undergo a screening period to complete the pre -study examinations and 
to confirm  their hypogonadal status. Serum total testosterone (T)  below 300 ng/dL based on two 
consecutive blood samples obtained between 6 and 10 AM, on two separate days at approximately 
the same time of day, following an appropriate washout of current androgen re placement therapy 
will be used for screening T levels.  At the end of Visit 2 , sites will provide subjects with a 7-day 
sexual desire question printout, with instruction s to answer the question each day for 7 days leading 
up to Visit 3.  Sites will remind subjects to complete the  sexual desire question  printout when 
scheduling Visit 3 for elig ible subjects; ineligible subjects will be informed that they will not be 
able to participate  in the study, and they do not need complete the printout.  
MRI -1 (Window: between Visit 2 and Visit  4): The MRI -1 baseline MRI -PDFF measurement 
will be performed between Visit 2 and Visit 4 in a subset of study subjects (approximately 20 or 
more subjects).  Following confirmation of a subject’s hypogonadal status at Visit 2, sit es will 
schedule MRI -[ADDRESS_436516] Visit 4  at the time of Version 04 implementation .   
Visit 3: The morning of  Visit 3 (Day -4), hypogonadal men meeting the inclusion criteria and none 
of the exclusion criteria will be confined for approximately [ADDRESS_436517] the 7-day sexual desire question 
printout from subjects and give subjects a s exual distress question printout  to answer .  About 2 
hours  prior to start of the ABPM , vital sign measurements w ill be recorded to include oral 
temperature, Clinic BP  PR. For proper measurement of Clinic BP  and PR , the following 
procedures should be follow ed: 
• An appropriately sized cuff for the size of the subject’s arm circumference should be 
utilized to minimize inaccurate readings.   
• No smoking or exercise for at least 30 minutes before a blood pressure measurement  
• Subjects should sit in a chair with a b ack support and the arm supported at heart level 
with feet flat on the floor. The subject should void prior to the measurement.  
• Blood pressure and PR will be measured in triplicate over a minimum of approximately

Date: 19 February 2019  Confidential  Page 21 of 50 Following this  measurement , subjects will be started on the 24 -hour ABPM portion  of the study , 
starting  at 7:[ADDRESS_436519] with a meal, and then  affix a validated, 510(k)  cleared  portable ABPM device to the 
subject’s arm; the device will record the subject’s BP and PR  over [ADDRESS_436520] BP and PR every 15 minutes during daytime hours (7 AM to 11 PM), 
and every 20 minutes during nighttime hours (11 PM to 7 AM).  At the end of confinement 
period, sites will upload the ABPM data from the device to the web upload , and a central reader 
will evaluate if a subject’s ABPM data are valid based on the ABPM Data Criteria provided in 
Section  Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring .  Subjects with valid ABPM data will proceed to 
Visit 4; subjects w ho do not have valid ABPM data may choose to repeat Visit  3 or they will not 
be enrolled into the study .  Subjects will be asked if they were  able to tolerate the ABPM 
component of the study  and if they are willing to participate in the ABPM visit at the e nd of the 
study.  
Visit 4: Subjects with valid ABPM data will return to the clinic for study enrollment.  The 
morning (6 – 10 AM) of Visit 4 (Day 1 of treatment), eligible subjects will return to the clinic , 
where staff  will dispense study drug.  At the end of the visit, sites will provide subjects with a 7-
day sexual desire question printout, with instruction s to answer the question each day for [ADDRESS_436521] Resupply (Day 60; Window Day 30 to Day 60) : subjects will return 
to the clinic for a resupply of study drug.   Sites will record the day of the study  drug resupply, 
and batch number of the study drug provided to the subject.  
MRI -2 (Window: any time between Day 56 to Day 76 , inclusive ): The MRI -2 interim MRI -
PDFF measurement will be performed between Visit 4 and Visit 5 in subjects who had a baseline 
MRI-PDFF measurement (MRI -1).  Sites will schedule MRI -[ADDRESS_436522]’s MRI -1. 
The Visit 5 (Day 107, window ± 7 days) schedule involves collecting a blood sample, providing 
meals to subject, dosing the study medication and ABPM measurements.  
The visit starts on Day [ADDRESS_436523] a 
single blood sample from the subjects (at approximately [ADDRESS_436524] -morning dose on Day 106). 
Following the blood sample collection, subjects will remain at the site until completion of 
ABP M on Day 108 (confinement duration  of about 45 hours). For subjects who are not able to 
remain in the site for the 45 -hour duration, blood sample may be collected at approximately 3 
hours after the evening dose of Day 106 (confinement duration of at least 33 hours).  
Sites will collect the 7-day sexual desire question printout from subjects and give subjects a 
sexual distress question printout  to answer . Then, o n the morning of Day 107, prior to start of the 
ABPM , vital signs ( oral temperature, Clinic BP and PR) will be measured.  Subjects will then be 
provided with the study medication approximately [ADDRESS_436525]

includ ing the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or  sign/symptom, severity, time course, 
duration, outcome, relationship of the AE to study drug, and any action(s) taken. For serious AEs 
not considered  "related" to study drug, the investigator will provid e an “Other ” cause of the 
event.  For AEs to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and  severity. 
Adverse events, whether in response to a query, observed by [CONTACT_8786], or  reported 
spontaneously by [CONTACT_41614] . All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory 
resolution . 
14.1. Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical  investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not  necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore  be any unfavorable and unintended sign,  
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational)  product, 
whether or not the event is considered causally rel ated to the use of the product.  
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as  well as 
from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal. Any  worsening of a 
pre-existing condition or illnes s is considered an AE. Worsening in severity of a reported AE 
should be reported as a new AE. Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are AEs 
only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic  medical intervention, 
and/or if the investigator considers them to be AEs.

If an AE meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to the sponsor/PI  [INVESTIGATOR_351130] 24 hours of the site being made aware of the SAE : 
Event  Description of Event  
Death of Subject  An event that results in the death of a subject.  
Life-Threatening  An event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would  have resulted in 
immediate fatality if medical intervention  had not been taken. This does not 
include an event that  would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe  
form.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_351131]'s hosp ital stay.  This does not include an emergency room 
visit or  admission to an outpatient facility.  
 
Congenital Anomaly  An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that  results in fetal loss in 
the female partner of a study subject.  
 
Persistent or 
Significant  
Disability/Incapacity  An event that results in a condition that substantially  interferes with the 
activities of daily living of a study  subject. Disability is not intended to include 
experiences  of relatively minor medical signifi cance such as headache,  nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental  trauma (e .g., sprained ankle).  
 
Important Medical 
Event Requiring 
Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to 
Prevent Serious 
Outcome  An important medical event that may not be immediat ely life -threatening or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based on medical judgment may jeopardize 
the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of 
the outcomes listed above (i .e., death of subject, life -threatening, hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity). Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or  convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
For SAEs with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF.   
14.3. Adverse Event Severity  
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each AE: 
Mild  The AE is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].  
Moderate  The AE causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject's usual 
activities . 
Severe  The AE causes considerable interference with the subject's usual activities 
and may be incapacitating or life -threatening .

The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the AE to the use 
of study dru g: 
Related  An AE where there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
study drug and the AE . 
Not Related  An AE where there is no evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
study drug and the AE . 
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being  related  to 
the study drug will be  considered “related”. Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility 
of being  related  to study drug  will be considered  “not related”. If an investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_351132],  an “other” cause of event must be

Statistical analyses will be performed on the full analysis set (FAS), and safety set .  
Safety Set (SS):  The safety set includes all subjects who received a dose of study drug . All 
safety analyses will be conducted in the SS.  
Full An alysis Set ( FAS ): The FAS consists of all subjects enrolled into the study with valid 
ABP M data at Visit  3 and Visit 5. All analyses of blood pressure will be conducted in the FAS.  
16.3. Statistical Analysis  
Demographic parameters will be summarized descriptivel y. Treatment -emergent AEs will be 
summarized descriptively for all subjects who were dosed (safety population).  
Descriptive statistics (arithmetic and geometric means, standard deviation (SD), coefficient of 
variation (CV [%]), minimum, maximum, and media n) of Clinic BP and PR  measurements will 
be summarized descriptively for all subjects who were dosed (SS population).  
Descriptive statistics (arithmetic and geometric means, SD, CV [%], min imum, max imum, and 
median) of daytime (7:00 AM to 11:00 PM) , nighttime ( 11:00 PM to 7:00 AM) , and 24 -hour

In addition , the following analyses  and data presentation will be included : 
• Central tendency analysis and outlier analysis for the 24 -hour average and for the hourly 
average. Outliers will be defin ed in the SAP (i.e., systolic BP exceeding 160 mmHg or a 
change in systolic BP > 20 mmHg, or a diastolic BP exceeding 100 mmHg or a change in 
diastolic BP > 15 mmHg).  
• Graphical display of hourly ABPM averages that include standard deviation bars for both 
systolic BP and diastolic BP at baseline and at endpoint (mid -trial data optional).  
• Cumulative distribution curves of 24 -hour average systolic BP and diastolic BP at 
baseline and at each of the timepoints in which ABPM studies are performed.  
• Forest plots of  daytime, nighttime, and 24 -hour change from baseline with 95% 
confidence interval displays for systolic BP and diastolic BP. 
Sensitivity analyses: 1) the above four sub -bullets grouped for subjects without hypertension, 
with hypertension untreated, and wi th hypertension treated; 2) the above four sub -bullets for 
subjects with/without diabetes mellitus.  
A complete description of the statistical analyses to be performed will be presented in the SAP.  
16.4. Endpoint Analysis  
Details of the analyses to be performed will be described  in detail in the SAP. Study primary 
endpoints are briefly discussed below.   Primar y endpoint analysis will be performed using data 
from all subjects with valid ABPM data at baseline (Visit 3) and post-treatment  (Visit 5).   
The objective of the study is to rule out a clinically meaningful increase in 24-hour average 
systolic BP, as measu red by [CONTACT_44117].   The primary endpoint is the change from Visit 3 to Visit 5  
of the average 24-hour systolic BP.  If the upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the change 
from Visit 3 to Visit 5 in average 24-hour systolic BP  is ≤ 4.9 mm Hg, then the change w ill be 
considered not clinically significant . 
16.5. Other Safety Endpoints  
Other k ey safety endpoints are AEs  and physical examination.  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  
(MedDRA). An AE is considered treatment emergent if the event begins or worsens in severity 
after initiation of treatment . The number and percentage of subjects with treatment -emergent 
AEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term. A summary of the 
number of  subjects with treatment -emergent AEs will be provided by [CONTACT_128498]. Subjects reporting more  than [ADDRESS_436582]

18.1. Source Documents  
Sour ce documents are defined as original documents, data and records. These may  include 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory data/information, subject  questionnaires or 
evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing and other records, recorded data from automated 
instruments, microfiches,  photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, and/or x -rays. 
Source document  data may be transcribed onto eCRFs as required. Data collected during this 
study must be  recorded on the appropriate source do cument.  
The investigator/institution will permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB review, and  
regulatory inspection(s), providing direct access to source data documents.  
18.2. Case Report Forms  
Case report forms (CRF) must be completed for each subject who receives study medication  in 
this study. These  forms will be used to transmit information collected during the study to 
sponsor/PI  [INVESTIGATOR_351133], as applicable. The CRF data for this study will be  collected 
with an electronic data capture  (eEDC ) system. The EDC system and the study -specific eCRFs 
will comply with Title 21 CFR Part 11. The documentation related to the validation of the EDC 
system is available through the system vendor , while the validation of the study -specific eCRFs  
will be conducted by [CONTACT_282336] ( CRO ) and will be maintained in the Trial 
Master File at the CRO.  
The investigator will document subject data in his/her own subject files. These subject  files will 
serve as source data for the study . All eCRF data required by [CONTACT_351156]. All data entered into the  eCRF will be supported 
by [CONTACT_26300].   
The investigator or an authorized member of the investigator's staff wi ll make any necessary 
corrections to the eCRF. All change information, including the date and person performing the 
corrections, will be available via the audit trail, which is part of the EDC system. For any 
correction, a reason for the alteration will be  provided. The eCRFs will be reviewed periodically 
for completeness, legibility, and acceptability by [CONTACT_351157] (or their representatives). The 
CRO (or their representatives) will  also be allowed  access to all source documents pertinent to 
the study in  order to verify eCRF entries. The  investigator will review the eCRFs for 
completeness and accuracy and provide  his or her electronic signature [CONTACT_147596].  
The CRO  will provide access to the EDC system for the duration of the tri al through a  
password -protected method of internet access. Such access will be removed from  investigator 
sites at the end of the site's participation in the study. Data from the EDC  system will be archived 
on appropriate data media ( e.g., CD-ROM) and provi ded to the  investigator at that time as a 
durable record of the site's eCRF data. It will be possible for  the investigator to make paper

personnel, the investigator(s), and the study coordinators/project manager(s). This meeting will 
include a detailed discussion and review of the protocol and essential documents, performance of 
study procedures, eCRF completion and spec imen collection methods.  
The CRO monitor will monitor the study site throughout the study. Source document verification 
will be performed. A quality assurance check will be performed to ensure that the investigator is 
complying with the protocol and regula tions. In addition, after the eCRFs are submitted, a review 
of the data will be conducted by a representative at CRO.  
Computer logic checks will be run to identify such items as inconsistent study dates. Any 
necessary corrections will be made to the database via the eCRF.  
Routine hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis tests will be conducted using a certified 
clinical laboratory. Laboratory reference ranges will be obtained prior to the initiation of the 
study. A review of all laboratory results will be conducted by [CONTACT_351158], the investigator 
and other appropriate personnel from CRO.

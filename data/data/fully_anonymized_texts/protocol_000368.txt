3 Rationale and Background
3.1 Photorefractive Keratectomy (PRK)
Photorefractive Keratectomy (PRK) is a common elective surgery used to correct refractive
errors (nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism). An excimer laser is used to remove
stromal corneal tissue to achieve the desired refractive outcome. The corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_322458], creating a very well controlled and reproducible
surgical injury to the ocular surface. Post-operative healing is easily monitored and quite
predictable, but does cause potential discomfort and visual blurring for the patient, hence any
supportive measures or medication that hastens epi[INVESTIGATOR_322459].1,2In rare circumstances, the creation of
these epi[INVESTIGATOR_322460] eects or complications including
delayed epi[INVESTIGATOR_195537], recurrent erosions, or dry eye. We propose that amniotic ﬂuid

Protocol Version Date: December 01, 2021  
Amniotic
 Fluid Trial Network
Page 10 of 36 Protocol 1.05 ([CONTACT_148011]in)
drops may be beneﬁcial in promoting ocular surface healing following PRK. Puriﬁed amniotic
ﬂuid (pAF) contains anti-inﬂammatory, anti-microbial and regenerative factors similar to solid
amniotic membrane.3Amniotic membrane has growth factors and natural anti-inﬂammatory
factors and has demonstrated therapeutic eect following a variety of ocular surface injuries or
surgery including: Stevens Johnson Syndrome and pterygium removal.4,5Anecdotal experience
has indicated that amniotic ﬂuid eye drops may be beneﬁcial in graft-versus-host disease, but
controlled studies are needed to determine if this has clear beneﬁcial eects.
3.2 Amniotic ﬂuid (AF):
Early after conception and until the mothers water breaks for the delivery of their infant, the
fetus is bathed in amniotic ﬂuid. AF functions as a supportive cushion to the fetus and provides
a protective environment. AF is a rich source of nutrients, cytokines and growth factors that are
required for fetal development and maturation.6AF also contains stem cells with the potential
to dierentiate along multiple cell lineages.7,8The protective and regenerative properties
of AF are achieved via the exchange of water and solutes with surrounding tissues. This is
accomplished via the utilization of dierent pathways during the course of a pregnancy that
likely contribute to changes in the composition of the AF with gestational age.6A report
that concentrates of AF inhibited the development of peritonitis was among some of the ﬁrst
evidence that AF had protective biological properties.9This was followed by a publication
by [CONTACT_322487]-workers that AF accelerates defense-repair mechanisms within damaged
joints.9,10Since these early publications, more sophisticated evaluations have revealed the
presence of antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, and growth-promoting activities in AF.6Reports
about antimicrobial activity in AF diers11among investigators. Some studies show that AF
is inhibitory, while others show no eect against the same microorganisms. Yet, other reports
provide evidence that AF with low antimicrobial activity is associated with a high incidence
of an infectious syndrome in pregnant women.12Components with antimicrobial, antiviral
and antifungal activity that are present in AF include lysozyme, peroxidase, transferrin, -lysin,
immunoglobulins and zinc-peptide complexes.11Immunomodulatory properties of AF are
evident from studies showing that enteral feeding of AF suppresses the pro-inﬂammatory
responses in preterm pi[INVESTIGATOR_322461].13While growth promoting activities of
AF are supported by [CONTACT_322488],14regenerate peripheral nerves15and bone,16accelerate re-epi[INVESTIGATOR_322462],17and promote healing of human skin wounds.18Some of the factors that are found
in AF that may contribute to these activities include inﬂammatory mediators that include, but
are not limited to TNF-a, IL-6, IL8, and IL-10,19trophic factors that include EGF, IGF-1, FGF,
HGF and TGF-a,20–24and HA, an important factor in promoting re- epi[INVESTIGATOR_322463].18

Protocol 1.05 ([CONTACT_148011]in) Page [ADDRESS_398132] was to determine
the feasibility of consenting and screening volunteer donors for the routine collection of AF from
full-term pregnant women scheduled for caesarean- section (C-sections) and then processing the
AF for clinical applications. The second aim was to develop a processing method that resulted
in a cell-free AF preparation suitable for clinical applications. The third goal was to gain a better
understanding about components of AF procured from full-term pregnancies.
With the above 3 goals in mind, human AF was collected by [CONTACT_322489][INVESTIGATOR_322464] (CTRM) facility at the University of
Utah. Physician executed abdominal incisions were performed through the abdominal and
uterine muscles without cutting into the amnion membrane. Using a sterile soft suction catheter
connected to a sterile MediVac Suction Container (Cardinal Health, Waukegan, IL), a blunt
end insertion with a catheter was made into the amnion membrane and the AF was aseptically
suctioned into a MediVac Container. The container was labelled, wrapped in frozen Insul-ice
mats (Fisher Scientiﬁc, Hanover Park, IL) and placed in a temperature-monitored shipper that
was validated for transport between 2 and 8C. The AF was transported to the CTRM facility
at the University of Utah. Upon arrival at the CTRM facility, the product was immediately
placed into a refrigerator at 2-8C until processing occurred. At the time of processing, the
MediVac container with AF was aseptically placed in a biological safety cabinet and the AF
was transferred via aseptic techniques into sterile centrifuge tubes. The total volume and
gross appearance of the AF were recorded and samples were removed for sterility testing,
cell counts and other relevant testing. The AF was centrifuged at 1400Xg for 20 min at 4C.
Once centrifugation was complete, the supernatant was expressed into a new transfer pack and
the remaining cell pellet was characterized and cultured as described below. The supernatant
from the AF was processed using a proprietary ﬁltration technology to sterilize and eliminate
cellular debris from the ﬁnal product. AF collections and ﬁnal products were evaluated for
total volume, ﬂuid chemistries, total protein, and hyaluronic acid (HA) levels. Final products of
processed AF (pAF) were also assessed for their cellular content and for their protein proﬁles
using quantitative antibody arrays.
To validate the above described approach for collecting and processing AF, 36 pregnant
women consented and passed the donor screening criteria. AF was successfully collected from
17 individuals. Median AF volumes were 70 mL (range 10-815 mL; n =17). Fluid chemistries
were similar, but some dierences were noted in HA levels and cytokine proﬁles. Cytokine
arrays revealed that an average of 304 20 (mean SD; n=3) of [ADDRESS_398133] defense. Among the 300
proteins present in pAF were two proteins with functions known to be associated with ocular

development and corneal stroma maintenance.
3.3 Processed Amniotic Fluid (pAF): Preliminary Clinical Data
The presence of peptides in processed amniotic ﬂuid (pAF) that have roles in ocular development
and corneal stroma maintenance, along with the understanding that one of the in utero beneﬁcial
functions of AF is to bathe the fetuses eyes, led us to hypothesize that pAF may be a valuable
treatment regimen to improve corneal re-epi[INVESTIGATOR_322465].
Our pAF has been clinically used in over [ADDRESS_398134] patient reported no change.

Eye Dropper Bottles that contain pAF or control saline solution (NaCl 0.9% Baxter Medical).
The patient will apply one drop 1-2 drops (one drop is approximately 50 L) in each eye four
times daily for a total of 7 days. The patient will apply 1-2 drops (0.25mL) in each eye four
times daily for a total of [ADDRESS_398148] dose of pAF or placebo to patients the morning of surgery, Day 1.
The study treatment assignment for each patient will be randomly selected. Neither the
patient nor their doctors will know if they are receiving pAF or placebo. The eyedropper bottles
containing pAF and the placebo will be packaged identically.
Patients will be instructed to use preservative free artiﬁcial tears from individual vials (any
brand) no less than [ADDRESS_398149], package and release Comar Eye Dropper Bottles containing pAF or the
placebo saline solution (NaCl 0.9% Baxter Medical) to the clinical site. A small box of eight (8)
eyedropper bottles containing 3.0 mL of either pAF or placebo will be provided in a Thermosafe
box with dry ice to the patient for 7 days of treatment.
The small boxes will be packaged on dry ice and transported to the patient. The patient will
be provided with the instructions on how to store the eye drops at home, how to use the eye
drops and how to handle the dry ice. The patient will transport the eye drops to their home and
immediately transfer them to their kitchen refrigerator freezer. For each day of use the patient
will dispense the eye drops as follows:
1.The patient will remove the box containing the bottles from the freezer and remove a
single bottle from the small box. They will verify that the lot number on the bottles
match the labels on the small box. If the lot numbers on the bottle do not match the lot
numbers on the small box, the patient will be instructed to notify the study coordinator.
The study coordinator will notify CTRM, and CTRM will replace the bottle with the
correct lot number. The patient will have to come to the Moran to trade out the bottle(s).

3.For the 1stdaily application (e.g. morning), they will remove the cap from the bottle.
They will invert the bottle over the right eye and squeeze to dispense 1-[ADDRESS_398151] the thawed bottle into refrigerate at a temperature between 1C and
10C (e.g. refrigerator). They will not re-freeze the thawed bottle.
5.For each subsequent application of the day, they will remove the same thawed bottle that
they used for the 1stapplication from the refrigerator and repeat steps [ADDRESS_398152] if they missed any doses of their medication.
5.4 Assessment of Primary Endpoint(Safety)
Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_322468] ﬁndings of scheduled eye exami-
nations at days 1 (day of surgery) through 8 (in-person follow-up visit) and at months 1, 3, 6
and 12 after initiation of pAF therapy. More frequent safety evaluations may be performed if
clinically indicated or at the discretion of the investigator. Information from the eye examination
at these additional safety evaluations will be collected and entered into the EDC as adverse
events as appropriate.
All ocular adverse events will be recorded from randomization through Month 12. Any
events that occur from time of consent to randomization will be recorded as medical history.
6 Safety Monitoring
6.1 Adverse Event Reporting
The site investigator is responsible for evaluating all adverse events at their Clinical Center
and ensuring that they are properly reported. Only ocular adverse events (as speciﬁed in 6.1.2)
that occur during this study will be recorded. The nature of each experience, date and time
PRK Protocol Version 1.05
Protocol Version Date: December 01, 2021 
Amniotic Fluid Trial Network
Page 18 of 36 Protocol 1.05 ([CONTACT_148011]in)
(where appropriate) of onset, outcome, course, and relationship to treatment will be documented.
6.1.1 Deﬁnition of Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event
Adverse Event (AE) means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an
intervention in humans, whether or not considered intervention-related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)). An
event constitutes a disease, a set of related signs or symptoms, or a single sign or symptom.
Serious Adverse Event (SAE): A serious adverse event (SAE) for this population is an
adverse event that:
1. results in death; or
2.is life-threatening (the patient was, in the view of the site investigator, in immediate
danger of death from the event as it occurred); or
3. requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43928]; or
4. results in persistent or signiﬁcant disability or incapacity; or
5. results in congenital anomaly/birth defect; or
6.any other event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the
subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the
other outcomes listed in this deﬁnition.
6.1.2 Classiﬁcation of an Adverse Event (Relatedness, Severity, and Expectedness
Relatedness: The suspected relationship between study interventions and any adverse event
will be determined by [CONTACT_322497]. Relatedness must be assessed
by [CONTACT_322498] a research coordinator.
Not Related: The event is clearly related to other factors, such as the subject’s clinical

Probably Related: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of
beginning the assigned study intervention, and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_184467]’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs
administered to the subject.
Severity:
The severity, which is a measure of intensity, of clinical adverse events and laboratory abnor-
malities will be recorded by [CONTACT_184468]. The following guidelines will
be used to describe severity.
Mild: The event requires minimal or no treatment and does not interfere with the partici-
pants daily activities.
Moderate: The event results in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.
Severe: The event interrupts a participants usual daily activity and may require systemic
drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life-threatening or
incapacitating. Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.
Expectedness of the Event:
All adverse events, including serious adverse events, will be evaluated as to whether their
occurrence was expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature,
severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information described for the
study intervention. The following events will be reported as AEs::
Infection
Delayed healing of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_17754] (after the 7-day post-surgery visit)
Scarring or haze
Severe irritation of conjunctiva or periocular skin in the ﬁrst week
Poor refractive outcome (worse than 20/40 at 3 months or beyond)
Pain or severe irritation at 3 months or beyond
Corneal erosion
Corneal haze
Need for touch up surgery
There is a theoretical risk of infection with amniotic ﬂuid drops. A patient could have an
immune reaction to the study drops.

6.1.3 Treatment or Action Taken:
For each adverse event, the site investigator will record whether an intervention was required:
Medical or surgical procedure
Concomitant medication: started, changed, or discontinued
Other, specify
No action taken

in the study, but prior to actual randomization, are not adverse events. These should be recorded
as baseline conditions.
6.1.6 Data Collection Procedures for Adverse Events
After patient randomization all adverse events (including serious adverse events) will be recorded
according to relatedness, severity, and expectedness, as well as their duration and any treatment
prescribed. Any medical condition present at the time of randomization, recorded in the patient’s
baseline history at study entry, which remains unchanged or improves (unless the clinician feels
it is clinically relevant), will not be recorded as an adverse event at subsequent evaluations.
However, worsening of a medical condition that was present at the time of randomization will
be considered a new adverse event and reported.
Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA coding vocabulary. Coding will be done
centrally at the Data Coordinating Center as this requires speciﬁc training.

6.1.7 Unanticipated Problems (UP)
Unanticipated problems (UP) are deﬁned as incidents, experiences, or outcomes that are un-
expected, related or possibly to participation in the study, and suggest that the research places
subjects at a greater risk of harm than was previously known or recognized. The site investi-
gator will report unanticipated problems to the Data Coordinating Center within 24 hours of
becoming aware of the event. A detailed completed report will be required to be sent to the
Data Coordinating Center within 3 working days of the event. After receipt of the complete
report, the Data Coordinating Center will report these unanticipated problems to the CTRM in
an expedited manner (as close to 24 hours as possible).
In accordance with local IRB requirements, the site investigator may be required to report
such unanticipated problems to the IRB in addition to notifying the Data Coordinating Center. In
the event that the medical monitor believes that such an event warrants emergent suspension of
enrollment in the trial, and funding sta cannot be reached expeditiously, the Data Coordinating
Center will notify the study investigator and all site investigators to cease enrollment in the trial.
6.1.8 Monitoring Serious Adverse Events
A qualiﬁed physician will be designated to fulﬁll the function of the medical monitor for this
study. Site investigators and/or research coordinators will report serious adverse events to the
Data Coordinating Center within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. A detailed completed
report will be required to be sent to the Data Coordinating Center within 3 working days of
the event, and the medical monitor will assess all serious adverse events reported from site
investigators.
For each of these serious adverse events, the site investigator will provide sucient medical
history and clinical details for a safety assessment to be made with regard to continuation of the
trial. The medical monitor will sign o on each SAE report after review. All SAE reports will
be retained at the Data Coordinating Center, and all SAE reports will be available for review by
[CONTACT_322500] . The SAE reporting process may be incorporated into the Electronic Data Capture
(EDC) System in use for the study.
In the unlikely event that the medical monitor believes an unexpected and study-related
SAE warrants emergent cessation of enrollment in the trial, funding sta will be immediately
consulted. If these individuals concur with the judgment of the medical monitor, or if the
funding sta cannot be reached expeditiously, the Data Coordinating Center will notify the study
investigator and all site investigators to cease enrollment in the trial. Resumption of enrollment
will not occur without consent of the funding sta.
In accordance with local IRB requirements, the site investigator may be required to report
such events to the IRB in addition to notifying the Data Coordinating Center.

The determination of the number of patients having serious, related and unexpected ocular
adverse events in the study group will be reviewed by [CONTACT_4318], who may be unblinded
to the study drug. Thus, the blind will not be broken throughout the study.
The purpose of the DSMB is to advise the study investigators regarding the continuing
safety of study subjects and the continuing validity and scientiﬁc merit of the study.
The DSMB Chairperson will prepare a summary of each DSMB meeting that conveys the
public conclusions of the DSMB, with respect to protocol alterations and recommenda-
tions concerning continuation of the study.
In the unlikely event that the medical monitor believes an unexpected and study-related
SAE warrants emergent cessation of enrollment in the trial, sta and the DSMB chair-
person will be immediately consulted. If these individuals concur with the judgment
of the medical monitor, or if the sta and the DSMB chairperson cannot be reached
expeditiously, the DCC will notify the study investigator and all site investigators to cease
enrollment in the trial. Resumption of enrollment will not occur without consent of the
sta after discussion with the DSMB.

12 Statistical Considerations
12.1 General Statistical Methods:
Simple descriptive statistics of patient characteristics, operation parameters, and vision/ocular
measurements will be calculated (overall and by [CONTACT_322502]. controls) at baseline,
post-op and each follow-up visit. Outcomes will be described using appropriate summary
measures and graphical approaches.
Between-group comparisons will be performed on:
Time to complete re-epi[INVESTIGATOR_275447] (primary ecacy outcome).
Visual Acuity (best-corrected and uncorrected) (this measure at 30 days is the key sec-
ondary ecacy outcome).
Dimensions of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_322470]
(exploratory ecacy outcome).
Pain in each eye using a 0-10 point V AS scale on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. (exploratory
ecacy outcome).
Timing and frequency of use of rescue pain medication.
Corneal staining and surface irregularity.
Adverse event rate and complication rate.
For the primary ecacy outcome, a mixed eects model with time to healing as outcome
and assigned treatment arm as a predictor, including a random eect for each patient to model
correlation between eyes in the same participant, will be ﬁt to carry out the primary analysis. A
two-sided probability value with an alpha level of 0.[ADDRESS_398156] the null hypothesis
that time to complete re-epi[INVESTIGATOR_322471]. The
primary analysis will be performed on an intention to treat basis.
12.2 Analyses for Other Outcomes:
The key secondary ecacy outcome at 30 days will be analyzed (on a logarithmic scale) using a
mixed eects ANOV A model as for the primary aim. Exploratory outcomes will be analyzed in
appropriate fashion; for example, each patients pain level (worst in either eye) will be examined
on each evaluation day and compared between treatment groups for each day, while each patients
peak pain level at any time, and number of days until the patient is pain-free, will be compared

between treatment arms. A Statistical Analysis Plan will fully delineate all analyses to be
performed, including additional analyses to assess robustness of the primary and secondary
ecacy analyses.
12.3 Statistical Power and Sample Size: Time to complete re-epi[INVESTIGATOR_322472]-epi[INVESTIGATOR_322473]-epi[INVESTIGATOR_322474]. While evaluation times will be collected,
since the time of surgery and the time of the follow-up exam are dependent upon scheduling,
time to complete re-epi[INVESTIGATOR_322475], being simply the number
of calendar days from the day of surgery to the date of the ﬁrst examination demonstrating
complete re-epi[INVESTIGATOR_275447].

13 Data Management
13.1 Clinical Site Data Management
The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) will develop an electronic data capture system for this
trial. Currently the DCC uses multiple applications, such as OpenClinica or REDCap, and will
elect to use the most appropriate application at the time of implementation of the study.
The DCC will use an electronic discrepancy management system to notify sites of in-
consistent or erroneous data entry, which will be corrected by [CONTACT_977]. The discrep-
ancy/management system maintains an audit trail of all discrepancy resolution.

The Data Coordinating Center may supplement on-site monitoring with remote monitoring
activities. Remote monitoring involves detailed review of the data entered by [CONTACT_322506]/or research coordinator to review safety and data
quality. This may require uploading copi[INVESTIGATOR_41984], patient study ﬁles, regulatory
documentation, or other source documents for the monitor to review. Alternatively, other
methods, such as remotely viewing source documentation, may be utilized. This helps assure
protocol compliance and accurate data collection. The Data Coordinating Center may conduct
more remote monitoring activities early in the trial to assure protocol compliance and identify
any training issues that may exist. Remote monitoring documents will be retained in accordance
with federal requirements.

16 Data Coordinating Center
The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) in the Department of Pediatrics at the University of
Utah School of Medicine provides data coordination and management services for a variety of
national research networks. Anchoring these services is a new state-of-the art, energy ecient
data center completed in 2013. The data center facility supports more than 1400 users around the
world and provides a secure, reliable, enterprise-wide infrastructure for delivering critical DCC
systems and services. The new data center was built using high industry standards and energy
ecient cooling solutions. The data center is cooled by [CONTACT_322507],
providing eciency, redundancy and modularity. Cooling is based upon a hot/cold aisle design
that allows for even air distribution with minimal hot spots. The data center electrical power
system contains a redundant Mitsubishi uninterruptible power system (UPS) with a diesel
backup generator. The data center is protected with a FM200 ﬁre suppression system, early
warning smoke detectors and a heat detection warning system to act as a secondary system to
the smoke detectors. Security guards are on-site conducting access control and rounds. Entry

data center and external building access points are monitored with video surveillance.
In 2011 the data center began a large scale VMware server virtualization deployment.
Currently, the data center has virtualized about 99% of its environment. The virtual
environment consists of more than 200 virtual servers. The data centers virtualization
solution provides key advantages: high availability in the event of hardware failure,
virtual servers automatically go back online in a seamless process.
Flexible infrastructure disk storage, memory and processor capacity can be increased or
reallocated at any time.
Rapid deployment servers can be provisioned on-demand with minimal waiting on
hardware of software.
The data center also enhanced its storage resources by [CONTACT_67940] a networked storage
system to support its virtualized environment. The data center currently manages over 50
teraby[CONTACT_46784]. The storage solution consists of Dells EqualLogic PS Series Storage system
for providing a virtualized storage area network (SAN). Some of the beneﬁts that are realized
through this technology are:
Storage architecture is no longer be a bottleneck for IT services;
Performance is better than with the previous architecture;
Tiered storage is now possible;
Provisioning and reclamation of SAN disk will be much easier; and most important;
The new architecture includes a redesign of the SAN fabric to include complete redun-
dancy.
Production servers running critical applications are clustered and conﬁgured for failover
events. Servers are backed up with encryption through a dedicated backup server that connects
across an internal [ADDRESS_398169]. DCC storage area networking (SAN)
applications, clusters, and switch-to-switch links are also on a 10 gigabit network. Incremental
backups occur hourly Monday through Friday from 6 am to 6 pm. Incremental backups also are
performed each night with full system backups occurring every Friday. Tapes are stored in a
ﬁreproof safe inside the data center facility, and full backups are taken o site on a weekly basis
to an o-site commercial storage facility. In the event of catastrophic failure, such as a ﬁre in
PRK Protocol Version 1.05
Protocol Version Date: December 01, 2021 
Amniotic Fluid Trial Network
Page 32 of 36 Protocol 1.05 ([CONTACT_148011]in)
the server facility, daily backups would probably survive because of the ﬁre suppression system
and ﬁreproof safe, but there would be obvious delay in re-establishing data center function
because the servers will not survive such a disaster. Total destruction of the data center facility
could cause the loss of up to one weeks data. In future investments, the data center is making
co-location, disaster recovery and business continuity solutions a top priority. DCC information
systems are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to all users unless a scheduled maintenance
interruption is required. If this occurs, we notify all users of the relevant systems, and data entry
can be deferred until after the interruption is over. Critical systems availability has exceeded
99.9% for the past two years, and there has been no unscheduled downtime in over ﬁve years.
16.1 Security and Conﬁdentiality
The data center coordinates the network infrastructure and security with the Health Sciences
Campus (HSC) information systems at the University of Utah. This provides us with eective
ﬁrewall hardware, automatic network intrusion detection, and the expertise of dedicated security
experts working at the University. Network equipment includes four high-speed switches. User
authentication is centralized with two Windows 2012 domain servers. Communication over
public networks is encrypted with virtual point-to-point sessions using transport layer security
(TLS) or virtual private network (VPN) technologies, both of which provide at least [ADDRESS_398170] access to data center machines is only available while physically located
inside our oces, or via a VPN client.
All network trac is monitored for intrusion attempts, security scans are regularly run
against our servers, and our IT sta is notiﬁed of intrusion alerts. Security is maintained with
Windows 2012 user/group domain-level security. Users are required to change their passwords
every 90 days, and workstations time out after 5 minutes of inactivity. All ﬁles are protected at
group and user levels; database security is handled in a similar manner with group-level access
to databases, tables, and views in Microsoft SQL Server. Finally, all laptop computers in use in
the DCC or in the Department of Pediatrics are whole-disk encrypted.
The data center uses control center tools to continuously monitor systems and failure alerts.
Environmental and network systems are also monitored to ensure up time. Highly trained system
administrators on sta are available to respond in high risk emergency events. All personnel
involved with the DCC have signed conﬁdentiality agreements concerning data encountered
in the course of their daily work. All personnel (including administrative sta) have received
Human Subjects Protection and Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
education. We require all users to sign speciﬁc agreements concerning security, conﬁdentiality,
and use of our information systems, before access is provided.

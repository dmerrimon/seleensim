Background and Significance: One-half or more of older adults fail to remit with antidepressant 
pharmacotherapy. Treatment -resistant depression (TRD) in older adults is highly deleterious, 
because persistence of depression is a lead ing cause of disability, suicide, dementia, and 
premature mortality. Making it worst  is the lack of evide nce-supported treatments at a stage in 
life when medications’ benefit vs. risk ratio crucial .  
 
The Optimizing Outcomes of Treatment -Resistant Depression in Older Adults (OPTIMUM) study 
will provide the evidence that older adults need to get effective trea tment that works best for 
them, improving their quality of life while minimizing risks of medications.  
 
Study Aims: The study aims to close the evidence gap on late -life depression in three ways. First, 
we will examine the comparative benefits and risks of  antidepressant strategies (augmentation 
and switching) in older adults with TRD. We will focus on the effects on the outcomes that matter 
most to older adults, like well -being, adverse events, and falls. Secondly, we will explore how 
aging changes the bal ance of benefits vs. risks. With aging comes a decline in brain and systemic 
health that may alter the benefit/risk ratio of antidepressant strategies. Third, we will maximize 
stakeholder engagement to ensure relevancy to providers and patients alike. Arme d with the 
knowledge of differential benefits and risks, stakeholders could provide personalized precision 
care that maximizes the benefits of TRD treatment strategies for older adults with minimizing 
risks.  
 
Study Description: We will randomize 1500 adult s aged 60+ to 10 weeks of one of three Step 1 
strategies: aripi[INVESTIGATOR_711557], bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_711558], or switch to bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]. Those 
who do not attain remission in Step 1  will be randomized to 10 weeks of one of two Step 2 
strategies: lithium augmentation or switch to nortriptyline. Those who complete acute treatment 
will be followed in a one -year continuation. This pragmatic RCT will be carried out in real -world 
clinical s ettings. Primary care and mental health clinical partners will provide treatments, with 
decision support from the study team.  
 
Study population : Participants will be non -demented older adults aged 60+, with equal 
proportions aged 60 -70 and 70+, with curre nt major depression that has failed to respond to 2+ 
adequate antidepressant trials. We will recruit across five regions: St. Louis and rural Missouri; 
Los Angeles City and County; Western Pennsylvania; [LOCATION_001] City; and Toronto and rural 
Ontario. Two -thirds of the sample will be women and 70% white, 15% black, 10% Latino, and 5% 
other racial groups.  
 
Patients will be identified from clinical networks at each of the five participating centers. Our two 
primary mechanisms of recruitment will be through scree ning and referrals. We will screen 
through clinical networks using Electronic Medical Records (EMR) and will contact [CONTACT_711603] [ADDRESS_967889] were prescribed or are currently taking 
antidepressants. Referrals will be elicited from practitioners and through in -practice 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
OPTIMUM Protocol Version 3.0 2019-03-04 Final Version  6 advertisements to patients and their caregivers specifically asking if the doctor, patient, or 
caregiver describes the clinical situation as treatment resistant or difficult to treat.  
 
Primary/seconda ry outcomes : Psychological well -being is the patient -centered effectiveness 
outcome and remission from depression is the clinician -focused effectiveness outcome. 
Secondary patient -reported outcomes include physical function and social participation. Safety  
will be monitored through serious adverse events as well as falls and fall -related injuries. As well, 
the study will test how aging influences the relative benefits and risks of antidepressants for TRD.  
Additionally, a qualitative study of patient and cl inician partners will provide the lived experience 
of TRD and antidepressant strategies.  
 
Analytic methods : Repeated measures ANOVA  will test effectiveness of antidepressant strategies 
with respect to the primary patient -centered outcome of psychological w ell-being, as well as 
other continuous variables . Then, specific time*group contrasts will compare the changes across 
pairs of treatment groups.   Corresponding generalized linear models with a logit link function will 
test e ffectiveness for reaching remiss ion.  Cox models examining time to event will test safety of 
antidepressant strategies in terms of serious adverse events, falls, and fall -related injuries.   
 
Moderator analyses will examine the effect of aging on changing the relative benefits and risks o f 
antidepressants.  We will include the treatment by [CONTACT_551] (<70 vs >70) by [CONTACT_711604].  
A2 Purpose of the Study Protocol  
This study protocol will serve as the shared working document for the study team  to ensure that 
the research is being conducted consistently at all participating sites.  Investigators Revisions will 
be made and shared by [CONTACT_711605] (Washington University). Changes re quiring the 
approval of local IRB’s or the funding agency (PCORI) will not be implemented until such 
approval is obtained .  
B Background  
Treatment -resistant depression (TRD) is a major health problem for the growing population of 
older adults. Older  adults w ith persistent depression experience devastating medical 
consequences, place high burdens on caregivers, and suffer high suicide rates.4,[ADDRESS_967890] 
antidepressant pharmacotherapy.6,7 Persistent depression decreases older adults’ quality of life 
more than any other illness.[ADDRESS_967891] billions of doll ars each year in health care costs.23 This public health issue will rapi[INVESTIGATOR_711559].24 
 
Yet, in spi[INVESTIGATOR_711560], the comparative risk/benefit ratio of 
antidepressants is entirely unstudied in older adults with TRD.  This stands in contrast with 
numerous studies in younger adults.25-29   This evidence gap was highlighted in critical reviews30,31 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
OPTIMUM Protocol Version 3.0 2019-03-04 Final Version  7 that found a complete lack of evidence in this age group.  The sole exception is our recent 
randomized controlled trial (RCT) of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_711561].2,32   
 
C Study Objectives  
The study aims to close the evidence gap on late -life dep ression in three ways : 
C1 Aim 1: Effectiveness  
Examine the comparative benefits and risks of antidepressant strategies (augmentation and 
switching) in older adults with TRD.  
 
Effectiveness outcomes: psychological well -being and remission from depression  
Safe ty outcomes: serious adverse events, falls, and fall -related injuries  
C2 Aim 2: Effects of Aging  
Explore how age, and age -related variables (medical comorbidity, cognitive problems)  change 
the balance of benefits vs. risks.  
C3 Aim 3: Maximize Stakeholder Engagement  
We will maximize stakeholder engagement to ensure relevancy to providers and patients alike.  
C4 Rationale for the Selection of Outcome Measures  
 
OUTCOME  WHEN AND HOW MEASURED  RATIONALE  
Psychological well -being is the 
patient -centered effectiveness  
outcome (Hypothesis 1a [H1a]).  
 
Secondary quality of life 
measures are self -reported 
physical function and social 
participation.  In Acute, beginning and end of 
Step 1 (and Step 2); in 
Continuation months 4, 8, 12.  
Measured by [CONTACT_711606]* 
(Psychological Well -being) and 
PROMIS* (Physical function, 
Social participation).  
Assessed by [CONTACT_711607]**  Psychological well -being 
encompasses satisfaction, 
happi[INVESTIGATOR_008], cognitive engagem ent, 
and meaning/purpose.  It is a 
critical dimension of quality of life, 
recommended by [CONTACT_711608].  
 
Remission is our clinician -
focused effectiveness  outcome 
(H1b): reduction of depressive 
symptoms below a threshold 
(MADRS≤10).  This goal of 
treatment is a consensus among 
practitioners.53,54  In Acute, beginning and end of 
Step 1 (and Step 2); in 
Continuation, months 4, 8, 12  
Assessed by [CONTACT_6222] 
(blind) rater** via [ADDRESS_967892] outcome in 
antidepressant studies.   
Patient stakeholders described this 
assessment as “very important” 
for assessing effectiveness.  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) 
(H2a)  
This safety  outcome 
encompasses life threatening 
illness, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or need 
of medical care.  Anytime when a SAE occurs.  Key measure of antidepressant 
safety in older adults.  
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
OPTIMUM Protocol Version 3.0 2019-03-04 Final Version  8 Falls and fall -related injuries via 
self-report are another safety  
outcome (H2b).  
 End of Step 1 and Step 2, 
every 4 months in 
continuation.  
Assessed by [CONTACT_711607]**   Patient stakeholders told us that 
fall risk was very important to 
them.  Clinicians and policy -
makers are also concerned about 
fall risk due to antidepressants.   
D Study Design  
D1 Overview  or Design Summary  
The study design compares benefits and risks of [ADDRESS_967893]-line (simpler to use) strategies : 
augmentation with aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] , augmentation with bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], and switch to  bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]; and 2 
second -line (requires more monitoring) strategies : augmentation with lithium and switch to 
nortriptyline. The step -wise design matches real -world care, in which clinicians go from easier to 
more challenging management strategies.   
 
This is a collaborative, multi -site study with fiv e sites: Washington University (Coordinating Site)  
which includes University of Missouri -Columbia , University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], University of Toronto, 
University of [LOCATION_004] Los Angeles, and Columbia University. Each site will randomize [ADDRESS_967894] Selection and Withdrawal

1.d Ethical Considerations  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, United  States (US) Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) regulations, and all o ther applicable local law s and regulatory 
requirements.  
 
Each study site will seek approval by [CONTACT_51277] (IRB) according to regional 
requirements.  The IRB will eval uate the ethical, scientific and medical appropriateness of the 
study.  Further, in preparing and handling  electronic  case report forms ( E-CRFs), the investigator, 
sub-investigator and their staff will take measures to ensure adequate care in protecting 
participant privacy.  To this end, a participant identification  number will be used to identify each 
participant . 
 
1.e Informed Consent  
All subjects will have the purpose of the study, study interventions and evaluations, and the 
potential risks and benefits of participation explained to them and any questions will be 
answered.  If a subject agrees to participate in this study, the subject will review and sign the 
informed consent form (ICF).  
 
Written informed consent will be obta ined from all subje cts, themselve s, with no proxy consent . 
If requested by [CONTACT_1130] , we will be prepared to include others (family members, friends, or their 
personal physician -making) in the process of informed consent  to . Consent will be documented 
on a written ICF.  The ICF will be approved by [CONTACT_656009].  Each ICF 
will comply with the FDA regulations in Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part [ADDRESS_967895] preliminary pre -screening with the patient’s  verbal 
assent , following the process described in section F1. 
 
Written Informed consent  will be obtained before any study procedures  other than pre -
screening  are performed . 
 
Once appropriate essential information has been provided and fully explained in layman’s 
language to the subject by [CONTACT_093], or a qualified designee, the IRB -approved written 
ICF will be signed and dated by [CONTACT_123254] ( i.e., 
investigator or designee) .  The subject will receive a copy of the signed informed consent form; 
the original shall be kept on file by [CONTACT_093].  
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
OPTIMUM Protocol Version 3.[ADDRESS_967896] be agreed upon by [CONTACT_711615], and approved by [CONTACT_36349], prior to implementing.  
1.g Randomizatio n Method and Blinding  
Randomization of participants will be implemented in REDCap, using a randomized block design 
within clinic and age group using variable block size, stratified by [CONTACT_711616].  
 
Only assessors of outcome measures w ill be blinded. Participants, providers, and other research 
staff will not be blinded to participants’ condition.  
 
In this pragmatic design where all levels of adherence are allowed, participants will be 
considered randomized assuming they meet the eligibi lity requirements at screening (including 
any safety screens as applicable ) and they and/or their clinician has been given a randomization 
assignment .  
 
1.h Potential Risks  
Study Instruments and measures:  The assessments to be conducted as part of this study 
involving mood assessments, neuropsychological testing, and behavioral and functional 
assessments are non -invasive and carry with them no more than minimal risk. The most 
significant risks to the participants related to assessments are those that would fol low a breach 
of confidentiality and the disclosure  of clinical information. We also include  discomfort in the 
potential risks. The instruments to be used in this study are brief and pragmatic and have been 
well-tolerated by [CONTACT_711617] .  
 
Aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253]:   The most common side effect of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (occur in 25% of people) is akathisia.  
 
Common side effects (occur in 1 -25% of people) include restlessness, insomnia, fatigue, blurred 
vision, somnolence, tremor, constipation, sedation, and diz ziness. There is a potential that 
aripi[INVESTIGATOR_711562] (increased blood sugar), diabetes, abnormal 
cholesterol or increased triglycerides.  
 
We will monitor patients for these symptoms and require that they have a fasting blo od glucose 
and lipid profile obtained prior to start of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_711563].  
 
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has been reported for all atypi[INVESTIGATOR_16709], 
including aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (albeit rarely   -- only [ADDRESS_967897]  been reported, and the aripi[INVESTIGATOR_711564] ).  Patients who develop this syndrome 
may have high fevers, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, irregular pulse or blood pressure, 
rapid heart rate, excessive  sweating, and heart arrhythmias.  
 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
OPTIMUM Protocol Version 3.0 2019-03-04 Final Version  12 Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]:  The most frequent (occurs in more than 25% of people) side effects of bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_711565], dry mouth, and headache. Common side effects (occurs in 1 -25% of people) 
include excessive sweating, dizziness, tremor, constipation, nausea, decreased appet ite, weight 
loss, rash, heart pounding, high blood pressure, unsteadiness when walking, confusion, anxiety, 
increased urination, and difficulty sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Seizures may occur in patients receiving bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] ; 
however, at the dose range (max 300mg) and once -daily formulation used in this study, only [ADDRESS_967898] been reported, and our exclusion of individuals with seizure disorders will 
minimize this risk . There is a rare (<1%) risk of mania or hypomania associated with 
antidepressant treatment.  
 
Lithium:  Likely side effects (occurs in more than 25% of people) of lithium carbonate include 
shakiness of the hands, drowsiness, headache, increased urination, increased thirst, and dry 
mouth. Common side effects (occurs in 1 -25% of people) include weight gain, nausea, vomiting, 
and diarrhea. These are temporary side effects that will usually stop after the body adjusts over 
1-2 weeks. Lithium may commonly slow down the functioning of the thyroid hormone (hormone 
that controls growth and ability to burn ene rgy) and, after years of treatment, it may affects 
(occurs in less than 1% of people) the functioning of the kidneys.  In rare cases, lithium 
intoxication may occur with muscular weakness and lack of coordination, confusion, altered 
consciousness.   These ri sks are less likely at the lower serum levels used in this study.  
 
Nortriptyline:  The most frequent side effects of nortriptyline include dry mouth and constipation 
(25-30% of elderly participants  in our past studies). Other common (occurs in 1 -25% of people) 
side effects include sedation, sweating, dizziness, rapid pulse, heart poundin g, blurred vision, 
headache, and hypertension (high blood pressure) . There is a rare risk of arrhythmia. There is a 
rare (<1%) risk of mania or hypomania associated with antidepressant treatment.  
 
Potential Risks from Drug Cross -Over:  The intent of the stu dy is to move patients onto 
augmentation and switch strategies; therefore, there is some chance that patients will be 
switched to a drug that is either ineffective or that the transition will cause side effects (e.g., 
discontinuation syndrome).  In cases o f switch, tapering the previous drug while cross -titrating 
the new drug should minimize any discontinuation risks.  
 
One of our primary aims is to evaluate the safety of these  antidepressant pharmacotherapy 
options .  We will closely monitor all participants  for any problems (either in low effectiveness, or 
with side effects) and use this information as part of our “decision support” to inform 
participants and their clinicians about treatment steps such as increasing or decreasing the 
medication.   Thus, we be lieve that participants  treated in the proposed protocol will actually be 
safer in than they would in usual care . The potential risks associated with participation 
(including the risk of medications  and the risk of receiving an ineffective treatment) are t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_711566], and these will be clearly described to all  potential 
participants  as part of the infor med consent process.  
 
Suicide:   Suicide is not a risk of the study per se but is a risk of having major depression.  Patients 
who are identified as being acutely suicidal w ill be excluded from the study. Nevertheless, since 
the rate of completed suicide in the [LOCATION_003] remains high (i.e., abo ut twice the rate of homicide) 
and most Americans who commit suicide suffer from depression, all participants eligible to 
participate in this study are statistically at a relatively higher risk for suicide than the general 
population. Participation in the study does not create or increase the risk of completed suicide ; 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
OPTIMUM Protocol Version 3.[ADDRESS_967899] a 24/7/[ADDRESS_967900] included a Suicide 
Risk Management protocol to assess and r educe suicide risk in the manual of procedures  as well 
as a Quick Suicide Safety Screening that may be used during phone pre -screening.  
 
Body Composition Measurement (Washington University site only):  
For participants with  a pacemaker or a prosthesis tha t uses any other type of battery -powered 
or electrical power implant, there is a chance that the measurement of body composition could 
cause interference with the device. In order to protect from that risk,  participants  should not 
take part in the body com position measurement if they  have a battery -powered or electrical 
implant. Participants with a  history of abnormal heart rhythms  will be reviewed by  a medical 
doctor to make sure that the body composition measurement will not worsen their condition.  
1.i Potent ial Benefits  
Participant s may or may not benefit from being in this study. Changing medication strategies 
may provide relief from symptoms of depression.  Results from this study will provide doctors 
and patients with knowledge about the risks and benefits of antidepressant medicat ions for 
older adults, so that they can make informed choices to manage depression.  
1.j Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
Participants will be asked  to continue in the study for follow -up regardless of their and their 
physician’s adherence to the medication recomm endations from the study team. Participants 
who discontinue study medications for tolerability reasons will be asked to complete the 
appropriate Acute Phase End Assessments for their phase of the study (see Section F5). 
Participants who end Step 1 treatment early due to tolerability issues will be invited to proceed 
to Step 2 after completing  Acute Phase End Assessments.  
 
Participants who choose to withdraw from th e study early will be asked to complete the 
appropriate final visit for their phase of the study (Step 1 Week 10, Step 2 Week 20, or 
Continuation Month 12).  
 
Withdrawal from the study for any reason, including study completion, will be documented in 
the E lectronic Case Report Form . 
Participants’ reasons for withdrawal will be summarily reviewed by [CONTACT_25733]’s IRB at Continuing 
Review and at DSMB meetings.  
E Medication Strategies and Decisional Support  
1.a Description of Decisional Support  
The pragmatic, comparat ive effectiveness design research  participants continue to receive 
ongoing care, management, and prescriptions from their own physicians. The research team will 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
OPTIMUM Protocol Version 3.[ADDRESS_967901] of care 
medicatio n strategy conditions. The research team will assess participants for symptoms and 
tolerability by [CONTACT_711618]. The research team will make a 
recommendation for medication dosing that the treating physician can override or ignore. The 
Manual of Procedures for this study will describe how the study team will communicate the 
randomization assignment and any recommended changes to the treating physician. This 
decision support is greater than is seen in usual clinical care.  Pat ients highly recommended it, 
and a similar measurement -based approach has worked well in our prior studies in late -life 
depression.  
• Dose adjustment is done by [CONTACT_711619] :  
o If PHQ -9 score is 6 or greater, and side effects are absent or well -tolerated: 
increase the dose.  
o If PHQ -9 score is 5 or less, or side effects are enough that participant cannot 
tolerate a dose increase: keep dose the same.  
o If side effects are such that participant needs a dose decrease: dec rease dose 
back to previous.  
o If side effects are intolerable such that participant needs a medication change: 
end step and move on to the next step (or remove from study if in step 2).  
• Clinicians and patients have flexibility : they may decide to exit Step 1 or Step 2 
treatment early (e.g., due to tolerability issues).  Clinicians are allowed to coprescribe 
other medications as well.  The Manual of Procedures for this study will contain the 
communication plan for how the treating physician will communicate an y changes or 
new medications back to the study team.  
• Decision support will also ask participants their study med adherence.  If participants 
have missed doses, brief counselling about adherence, including the importance of 
100% adherence, and solving barr iers to adherence, will be provided.  
1.b Treatment Group  Assignment  
In this step -wise design, participants will be randomized 1:1:1 to a Step 1 medication strategy: 
aripi[INVESTIGATOR_711557], bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_711558], or bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_711567]. Participants whose 
depr ession has not remitted at the end of Step 1 , will be randomized 1:1 to a Step 2 medication 
strategy: lithium augmentation or bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_711567]. All medications  are being used within their 
FDA-indicated population (adults), disease (major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_28948] e), dosage, and route of 
administration (PO).  
1.c Aripi[INVESTIGATOR_711568]  2.5 mg 
Maximum Dose:  15 mg  
Titration:  Study team will recommend increases 
approximately every two weeks (5, 7 .5, 10, 
15) based on symptoms and tolerability.

1.h Preparation and Administration of Study Drug  
In this pragmatic, real -world study, physicians will prescribe these standard of care medications  
to study participants, who will procure them in the same manner they obtain their other 
prescriptions. This will include but is not limited to: using health i nsurance and prescription drug 
benefit programs, retail pharmacies, and clinic pharmacies.  
1.i Subject Compliance Monitoring  
Because this is a pragmatic study, all levels of adherence are allowed. Compliance with the 
study -recommended medication and dosing w ill be assessed at each decision support call using 
the Protocol Adherence Form. Reasons for non -compliance will be documented.  
 
1.j Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Patients randomized to an augmentation strategy will continue their previous antidepressant 
mon otherapy. Patients randomized to a switching strategy will be tapered off of their current 
antidepressant medication with guidance from the research doctors prior to initiating acute 
treatment. Research doctors will be available 24/7 via exchange in case o f issues.   
 
Co-prescription of other medications by [CONTACT_711620], consistent with the 
pragmatic design.  We will recommend limiting benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_711573] ≤2 mg of lorazepam or 
equivalent each 24 hours as needed.

OPTIMUM Protocol Version 3.0 2019-03-04 Final Version  20 F1 Scree ning for Eligibility  
Potential participants identified through each site’s IRB -approved recruitment plans will be 
screened for eligibility. Staff and PI’s at each site are responsible for verifying that participants at 
their site meet all eligibility crite ria before being randomized to acute treatment. We anticipate 
differences between sites in which assessments may be obtained in pre -screening (pre - written 
consent) versus screening  (post  written  consent).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_711574], the 
followin g assessments must be conducted prior to randomization to ensure eligibility (see also 
Section D2 for Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria):  
• PHQ -9 
• MINI MDE Module  
• Screening questions for treatment resistance and medical exclusions  
• Short Blessed Test  
• ATHF  
• CIRS-G  
1.a Screening Log  
Each site will use a phone screening script and screening log as approved by [CONTACT_11577]. In the 
event that participants do not currently qualify for the study, but may qualify in the near future, 
research staff will ask the potential part icipant for permission to keep their contact [CONTACT_711621]/or their doctor at a later date.

F7 Genetic Testing  
The proposed study will be a robust clinical trial platform for translational research, and the 
primary aims of this study, regarding effectiveness and safety of augmentation and switch 
strategies , lend themselves to pharmacogenetic studies . For example, t hese methods can 
address whether efficacy or tolerability are associated with genetic variability at the medication 
target receptors (producing pharmacodynamic variability at serotonin, norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238], and 
dopamine receptors).  
We will collect DNA from all participants at baseline. As the study approaches completion  (or 
after completion) , we will select specific hypotheses based on pharmacogenetics advances 
expected during the next 5 years.  Resources such as the Human Genome Center at Washington 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
OPTIMUM Protocol Version 3.0 2019-03-04 Final Version  24 University or the Centre for Pharmacogenetics in Toronto will provide cutting -edge testing and 
analytical methods leading to precision and patient -centered medicine.  
7.a Processing of DNA:  
Saliva samples will be obtained  approximately at baseline for each  subject. Eac h site will ship 
samples  (typi[INVESTIGATOR_711578])  to WU for DNA isolation and long -term storage.  
F8 Qualitative Interviews  
A subset of  randomly selected participants will be asked to participate in a semi -struct ured 
qualitative  phone interview  to fulfill Aim 3.  These interviews will be conducted by [CONTACT_711624][INVESTIGATOR_9109]. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed. 
They will take approximately [ADDRESS_967909] with participants 
that is much more frequent and structured than routine clinical  care.  
 
In addition, we will ask each participant and their physician to notify us of new symptoms, 
illnesses , or other problems.  
1.b Definitions of Adverse Events  
An A dverse Event (AE)  is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation 
subject administered a  drug under study .  An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with the stu dy drug .   
The criteria for identifying AEs are:  
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug under study, whether 
or not considered related to the drug und er study  
• Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease  
• Any deterioration in nonprotocol required measurements of a laboratory value or other 
clinical test (e.g., ECG or x ray) that results in symptoms, a change in treatment, or 
discontinuation of study drug  
• Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present 
pretreatment (i.e., baseline)  
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
OPTIMUM Protocol Version 3.0 2019-03-04 Final Version  25 • An abnormal laboratory test result should be considered an AE if the identified 
laboratory abnormality leads to any type of intervention, whether prescribed in the 
protocol or not.  
• A laboratory result should be considered by [CONTACT_76702]:  
o Results in the withdrawal of study drug  
o Results in withholding of study drug pending some investigational outcome  
o Resul ts in an intervention, based on medical evaluation (e.g., potassium 
supplement for hypokalemia)  
o Results in any out of range laboratory value that in the investigator’s judgment 
fulfills the definitions of an AE with regard to the subject’s medical profile  
 
All AEs observed during the study will be reported on the e -E-CRF.  All AEs, regardless of 
relationship to study drug or procedure, should be collected beginning from the time the subject 
signs the study ICF through the last visit.  Serious AEs will be co llected for [ADDRESS_967910] be made by [CONTACT_711625] t he study treatment.  
i Assessing Severity of Adverse Events  
AEs will be graded on a 3 point scale (i.e., mild, moderate, and severe) and reported in the detail 
indicated on the CRF.  The definitions are as follows:  
 
• Mild:   Discomfort noticed, but no disrupti on of normal daily activity  
• Moderate:  Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity  
• Severe:   Incapacitating, with inability to work or to perform normal daily activity  
ii Assessing Relationship of Adverse Events  
The causal relationship of the study drug to an AE will be assessed as related or unrelated, as 
follows:  
• Probably Related : There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study 
drug and the AE.  The event responds to dechallenge.  Seeing a recurrence of the AE 
with study medication rechallenge is not required.  
o Example: patient in step 1 is started on bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_711579] 300mg.  They report severe insomnia that reduces their day -time 
functioning (moderate AE).  Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_711580] 150 mg and insomnia is no 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
OPTIMUM Protocol Version 3.0 2019-03-04 Final Version  26 longer present.  Patient and clinician make a decision not to try higher dose of 
bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_711581].  
• Possibly Related : There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study 
drug and the AE.   Dechallenge is lacking or unclear.  
o Exam ple: patient in step 2 is switched to nortriptyline.  They report constipation 
which is uncomfortable but does not disrupt their daily activity (mild AE).  They 
are willing to continue the medication at the current dose; no dose reduction is 
made.  
Unrelate d: 
• Not Likely  Related : There is a temporal relationship to study drug administration, 
but there is not a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the event.  
o Example: patient in step [ADDRESS_967911] dose, they are driving and are hit by [CONTACT_711626], necessitating 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (severe and serious AE).  The accident is the fault of the other 
driver.  
iii Assessing Expectedness of Adverse Events  
An Unexpected Adverse E vent  is an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not 
consistent with the applicable product information.  
iv Assessing Serious ness of  Adverse Events  
An Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 
• Results in de ath 
• Is life -threatening (i.e., the subject was at immediate risk of death from the 
adverse event as it occurred; this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death)  
• Requires in patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect in the child of a subject who was exposed 
to the study drug  
 
Other important medic al events that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death 
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], when based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes in the definition of SAE 
listed above should also be considered SAEs.  Medical and scientific judgment should be 
exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in such situations.  
 
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3517] “adverse 
event” (i.e., there is no untoward medical occurrence) associated with the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]:  
 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3095]  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_711582]  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3521] a device (e.g., battery replacement) 
that was in place before study entry

H Statistical Plan  
 
H1 Analysis Plan  from OPTIMUM grant  
A priori, specific plans for data analysis correspond to major aims  and will be  directed by [CONTACT_15957] -I J. 
Philip Miller, professor of biostatistics at the coordinating site.  
We will follow the intention -to-treat (ITT) principle. In other words, patients who receive co -
prescribed medications  stop randomized medication, or switch to a different medication will 
continue to be followed.  To confirm that ITT findings represent the “true” data on effectiveness, 
safety, and tolerability of management strategies, we will conduct a sensitivity analysis that will 
compa re ITT to per -protocol findings .  
 
H1a (Psychologica l Well -Being):  We will use a repeated measures 2*2*3 ANOVA with age (60 -70, 
>70), time (baseline, end of Active phase of Step 1) by [CONTACT_1570] (3 levels). Specific time*  
treatment group contrasts will compare the changes across pairs of treatment grou ps. These tests 
will be conducted with a significance level of .05/3. We will include site as a strata in all analyses.63 
For those who proceed to Step 2, analogous repeated measures 2*2*2 ANOVA will be used with 
a significance level of .05 for the time*treatment group comparison.  
 
H1b (remission) : Corresponding 2*3 (age by [CONTACT_1570]) generalized linear models with a 
logit link function will be computed for the dichotomous outcome of remission.  
 
In the continuation phase  we will explore the long -term effectiveness of antidepressants:  
We will test for preservation of psychological well -being and other quality of life variables, and 
sustained resolution of depressive symptoms, by [CONTACT_711629].  
 
We will also test for sustained remission by [CONTACT_711630]. Relapse  will be 
defined as meeting DSM 5 criteria for a major depressive epi [INVESTIGATOR_1865], as determined by [CONTACT_711631] a study investigator.  
We will carry out Cox models examining time to relapse and time to dropout, to examine for 
treatment inferiority (i.e., whether one ant idepressant strategy produces poorer long -term 
outcomes).  Based on our prior research we don’t have an empi[INVESTIGATOR_711584] a specific arm 
as inferior.   Therefore, although these analyses are important to our stakeholders, we describe 
them as explora tory.  
 
We will also examine exploratory hypotheses , such as whether there are baseline covariates 
which will help to significantly enhance the prediction of response to treatments, e.g., gender, 
race, treatment site (primary care vs. specialty clinic), soc ial support, co -treatments. This will 
enhance the precision medicine implications of the study.

OPTIMUM Protocol Version 3.0 2019-03-04 Final Version  29 H2: serious adverse events, falls,  and fall -related injuries  are the safety outcomes. Cox models 
examining time to event (with Anderson & Gill64 extensions for repeated events) will compare 
the treatmen t arms during both the acute phase and the continuation in terms of serious 
adverse events, falls, and fall -related injuries.  
We will also compute rates of side effects  in each arm, as specifically recommended by [CONTACT_711632].  These data are not h ypothesis -testing, but they support the patient -centered goal 
of allowing clinicians and patients to know what to expect in terms of side effects from 
treatment .  
H3: Moderator analyses (Heterogeneity of Treatment Effects).  
Confirmatory analysis (HT -1): Ef fectiveness and safety differences between treatment arms will 
be moderated by [CONTACT_654].  Specifically, with increasing age effectiveness differences between 
treatment arms will decrease, and safety differences between treatment arms will increase.  
 
Rationale:  Our stakeholders demand that we move past the current “one size fits all” paradigm 
of antidepressant prescribing.  Precision treatment would greatly improve older adults’ quality of 
life. 
 
Data analysis plan for moderator testing:   We will inclu de the treatment by [CONTACT_551] (<70 vs 
>70) by [CONTACT_711633].  
 
We are well -powered for a confirmatory moderator analysis examining how age modula tes the 
differences between treatment arms in comparative benefits and risks, because of our 
recruitment strategy aiming for equally -sized strata of ages (60 -70 and >70).  Age will be treated 
as a categorical variable, comparing relative benefits and risks  of antidepressants in those aged 
<70 to those aged >70.   
 
Here are some scenarios of the types of treatment modulators by [CONTACT_711634] a power > 85% (using SAS’s GLMPOWER): (1) If treatment arm A has superior 
effectiveness over  arm B by 2.3 points more than what would be predicted based on age and 
treatment effects on Psychological Well -being for age 60 -70 but no difference between arms for 
age >70; (2) If treatment arm A has a superior effectiveness over arm B in terms of 13% h igher 
remission rate for age 60 -70, but there is no difference between arms for age>70.   
Exploratory moderator analyses based on aging -related brain and systemic health variables: Our 
next step will be to analyze three aging -related variables –impairment in executive cognitive 
function, frailty, and medical complexity –   treated both as continuous variables and categorical 
variables, using the same models as with chronological age.  
 
Finally, we will examine the relative strength of these moderator variabl es by [CONTACT_746] a 
combined moderator test.76,[ADDRESS_967912] (moderator) analyses:  We will perform 
statistical contrasts between treatment arms as a function of thee pre -specified moderator 
variables, and we will report all of these prespecified analyses, as well as post -hoc analyses, in 
published reports .

OPTIMUM Protocol Version 3.[ADDRESS_967913] Size  of the benefits and risks of antidepressants: As a conservative 
method for computing the detectable effect size we used simple t -tests for comparing change 
scores between groups. The research on minimally clinically relevant changes for Toolbox or 
PROMIS measures suggests that they are between 2 -3 T-score points (personal communication, 
David Cella, PI [INVESTIGATOR_711585]). The table below shows that we have power > 0.[ADDRESS_967914] changes smaller than minimally clinically relevant changes (e.g., we can detect changes 
< 2 T -score points).  For proportional outcomes we used the conservative approach of a simple 
comparison between proportions for remission. Difference of 10 percentage points around a 
remission rate of 40%1,2 are generally considered clinically meaningful.  Secondary tests of 
effectiveness will examine changes in other aspects of quality of life: physical function, social 
participation, and changes in depressive symptoms (i.e., MADRS scores). Detectable differences 
for these endpoints are also included in the power table  below  
 
We have robust power for detecting clinically significant differences even if we only recruit 400 
in each group: we would still  have a power of .[ADDRESS_967915] a difference of 2.0 in Step 1 on our 
primary outcome (Psychological Well -being) and a difference of 13 percentage points on our 
primary clinical outcome (remission rate).

OPTIMUM Protocol Version 3.0 2019-03-04 Final Version  38 K5 History of Changes to Study Protocol  
Version number 
and date  Description of changes  
V2.3: 1/19/17  Originally approved version of the study protocol.  
V2.4: 3/31/17  1) Participants who do not qualify for Step 1 due to a contraindication to 
a Step 1 medication, but otherwise meet eligibility criteria, may 
participate and proceed directly to S tep 2.  
2) Increase in maximum dose of bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_711591] 300 mg to 450 mg to 
be consistent with the FDA approved maximum dose.  
3) Additional baseline assessments . 
4) Assessment of falls at every decision support.  
5) Collection of self -reported weight at baseline, acute ph ase end, and 
continuation time points.  
6) All participants followed in Continuation, not just remitters.  
7) NIH Cognitive and Motor Batteries assessed at Continuation Month 
12 but not at 4 or 8.  
8) DNA samples collected via saliva sample instead of blood.  
V2.5: 6/26/17  1) Changes to eligibility criteria. Seizure disorder and Parkinson’s disease 
are exclusions for Step 1 but not for Step 2.  
2) Clarification to Step 2 exclusions indicating that participants may still 
be considered for Step 1 participation even if ineligible for Step 2.  
3) Clarification to lithium augmentation prescribing information that 
levels outside of 0.4 – 0.8 mEq/L window may still be acceptable per 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106].  
4) Clarification to nortriptyline switch prescribing information that levels 
outside  80-120 ng/ml window may still be acceptable per PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_9106].  
5) Removed fasting glucose from (generally) recommended baseline 
labs and added new section for recommended labs prior to 
aripi[INVESTIGATOR_711592].  
V2.6: 10/2/17  1) Clarified Step 2 exclusion of Acute or chronic renal insufficiency with 
the addition of the following language: as indicated by [CONTACT_711641] 30 mL/min; suspected if creatinine above 1.5 mg/dL; 
per PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or clinician discr etion.  
V2.7: 10/31/17  1) Updates to assessment procedures:  
a. If there is a long delay between the Step 1 Week 10 
assessment and the initiation of Step 2, the participant may 
be asked to repeat some or all of the Step 1 End assessments.  
b. Participants who relapse in Continuation after Step 1 may be 
invited to particip ate in Step 2; and then continuation 
subsequently.  
2) Addition of qualitative interviews for randomly selecte d subset of 
participants to fulfill Aim 3.  
V2.8: 12/5/17  1) Narrowed Step [ADDRESS_967943] 2 years.  
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
OPTIMUM Protocol Version 3.0 2019-03-04 Final Version  39 V2.9: 3/26/18  1) Addition of body composition measurement at WU.  
V3.0: 3/4/19  1) All participants are to begin the study in Step 1. Following their 
participation in Step 1, they will be considered for Step 2 (as in the 
current protocol). However they will not be invited to participate in 
Step [ADDRESS_967944] participating in Ste p 1. 
a) Accordingly, because direct entry into Step 2 is disallowed, the Step 
1 exclusions of Seizure disorder and Parkinson’s Disease are 
exclusions to the study as a whole.  
2) Increasing the inclusion criteria for the PHQ -9 from 6 to 10 to include 
participa nts with higher degree of symptom severity.  
3) Recommended schedule for standard of care follow -up labs is being 
standardized in the protocol.  
4) Removal of body composition measurement. This was exploratory 
and is not safety related.

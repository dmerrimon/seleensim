INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_21392]  (INtelligent  Stewardship Prompts  to Improve  Real-time Empi[INVESTIGATOR_783518] ): The INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_21392] -ASP Pneumonia Trial  Protocol  
 
A. Background and Goals  
 
A.1.[ADDRESS_1077385] infection (UTI).1 In treating these infections, the Center s for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has found that antibiotic prescribing could be improved 
in 35- 40% of patients.[ADDRESS_1077386] ~[ADDRESS_1077387] fueled 
national calls to improve antibiotic choices by [CONTACT_341142].8-13 There is a 2020 target to 
reduce “inappropriate” antibiotic prescribing in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341118] 20%, as discus sed in the 2014 
“National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic -Resistant Bacteria” released by [CONTACT_341143].[ADDRESS_1077388] pr actices for improving judicious antibiotic presc ribing. Evidence, 
engagement, and education are required to build a culture where it is accepted that rationale 
antibiotic prescribing is every physician’s responsibility.[ADDRESS_1077389] empi[INVESTIGATOR_341065] a 
patient ’s condition, selecting the wrong dose or durati on, and failing to re- evaluate the choices 
that have been made. Empi[INVESTIGATOR_341066]. We focus here on improving the empi [INVESTIGATOR_783519].  
When selecting initial antibiotics for common community -acquired conditions that cause 
admission, such as pneumonia and ur inary tract infection (UTI), physicians vary widely in their 
adherence to national guideli nes.18-20 This is often due to misperceptions that multidrug -resistant 
organisms (MDROs) are more common than they actually are, or beliefs that extended-
spectrum antibiotics are more effective in curing infections than standard- spectrum choices, 
even for pa thogens sensitive to standard- spectrum agents.21 Often, such perceptions are based 
on studies on critically ill patients and those with infections caused by [CONTACT_783562]-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA ), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and extended -spectrum  beta-
lactamase producing (ESBL) Enterobacteriaceae.22-[ADDRESS_1077390] been 
called “the missing care bundle,”[ADDRESS_1077391] to extrapolate the probability that the infection is due to a particular pathogen. 
As mentioned above, physicians are expected to use local antibiogram data from their microbiology laboratory to determine the risk of an MDRO infection in a given patient.
51-54,92 Yet, 
these data are not presented in a mann er helpful to clinical decision- making.93 For example, 
national data shows that over 50% of S. aureus  are resistant to methicillin (MRSA), and 22% of 
E. coli and 30% of P. aeruginosa are resistant to fluoroquinolones.94 
These data may be misinterpreted as the probability that a patient has an MDRO 
infection. However, when accounting for the likelihood that a patient is infected with these 
pathogens, the risk of MDRO infection drops substantially. In two recent studies of patients 
presenting from the communi ty with pneumonia, there was a 2.5- 4.6% risk of MRSA, a 1.0- 1.9% 
risk of Gram -negative Enterobacteriaceae , and a 0.7- 1.2% risk of P. aeruginosa resistant to 
standard -spectrum antibiotics.26,94- [ADDRESS_1077392] ewardship are lacking, there is evidence t hat precision 
medicine approaches can substantially improve patient care.
56-59 This involves reformulating a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]’ antibiogram data into disease- specific probabilities of MDRO infection to facilitate 
appropriate prescribing.  
A.1.[ADDRESS_1077393] generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone as empi[INVESTIGATOR_783520].18-20 There is  growing evidence that fluoroquinolones are associated with serious 
adverse drug reactions and an increased risk of C. difficile colitis.99-101 The Food and Drug 
Admi nistration (FDA) has also issued a warning  (May, 2016) against the routine use of 
fluoroquin olones for acute bacterial exac erbation of chronic bronchitis.[ADDRESS_1077394] been 
shown to increase a patient’s risk for future MDRO, length of stay, risk for C. difficile  colitis, 
healthcare costs, and mortality.99,103 Data are emerging that there  is time to await definitive 
culture data to i nform antibiotic treatment and that a delay in antibiotics targeting resistant 
organisms is not necessarily harmful and may improve outcomes.103-105    
  
 
B. INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_21392] -ASP Pneumonia Trial Study Design & Population  
 
B.1.1 INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_21392] -ASP Pneumonia Trial Study Design & Population  
The INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_21392] -ASP Pneumonia Trial is  a two -arm cluster -randomized trial in HCA 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_783521] -of-care precision medicine computeriz ed physician order entry 
(CPOE ) smart prompt  for adult patients admitted to general medical or surgical floors . The unit 
of randomization will be the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . The trial will begin with a six -month phase- in period  from 
October 1, 2018- March 31, 2019, followed by  a 15-month trial interv ention period between April 
1, [ADDRESS_1077395] 3 days of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. A  baseline period between April 1, 2017- September 30, 2018 will be utilized for 
comparison with the inter vention period at each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Per guidance from the Office for 
Human R esearch Protections (OHRP) , prisoners will not be included in this t rial. Prescribers 
and antibiotic stewardship teams in intervention facilities will be trained (e.g., coaching calls, 
usual communication channels (email, flye rs)) that prisoners should be excluded from the t rial 
(i.e., the CPOE smart prompt should not be acted upon for these individuals). D ata for any 
prisoners that may be inadvertently included in study dataset s will be removed prior to analyses  
using claims d ata as well as admission/discharge/transfer codes indicating ‘Court/Law 
Enforcement’ . 
 
 B.1.[ADDRESS_1077396] ered (see Appendix B for example CPOE indication screens ). For facilities assigned to 
the intervention arm of the INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_21392] -ASP Pneumonia Trial,  an INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_783522]- spectrum (ES, Table 1) for a  
             
 
pneumonia indication i n the first three days of a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. This CPOE smart prompt  will 
provide clinicians with a patient -specific estimate of the likelihood that the pneumonia is due to 
the associated target pathogens (e.g. MRSA, Pseudomonas, ESBL, or CRE, Table 1). The 
smart prompt will also provide guidance for  appropriate empi[INVESTIGATOR_783523] .   
For example, if an anti -MRSA antibiotic is being ordered  for pneumonia, the clinician will 
receive a prompt during the ordering process providing the probability that the patient has 
pneumonia due to  MRSA . Recommendations for  using standard -spectrum antibiotics (e.g. 
ceftriaxone) will be made when the probability of a given MDRO is lower than a given threshold 
(e.g., <10%). Thi s thres hold used in the trial will be finalized after evaluation of the prevalence 
of MDROs, and after discussion with the INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_21392] -ASP Steering Committee.  Similarly, if an ES 
antibiotic is se lected that targets a resistant Gram -negative Enterobacteriaceae or 
Pseu domonas aeruginosa, the ordering physician will receive information on the probability that 
the patient is likely to grow such organisms. The smart prompt will account for personal 
attributes of the patient as well as local resistance  patterns. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_783524], principally involving  a decision support

[ADDRESS_1077397], we will provide webinars 
through HCA  Healthcare’s webhosting sys tem to introduce the trial and call for participation. Second,  a call for 
participation will be made by [CONTACT_783563]. Third, our HCA Healthcare  co-investigators, who are system -wide leaders of antibiotic stewardship, 
quality, and infection prevention, will provide direct -to-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341077]. Recruitment 
announcement s will utilize usual corporate and local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_783529]/infectious diseases 
leaders. Participation will be confirmed by a signed l etter of participation from the individual hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]’ CEOs.  
For each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_783530] i nterest , enrollment criteria will be assessed by [CONTACT_783564] s. First, a contact [CONTACT_341148]. Second, a facility sur vey will be distributed to 
confirm eligibility criteria and obtain information on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_783531] .  As done in our previous HCA  Healthcare trials , surveys will be administered through HCA  
Healthcare usual survey channels and results will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_319377] r eturned to investigators in a database 
format.

Healthcare corporate regulatory affairs  and risk management  liaison  will facilitate delegation of IRB 
governance from each participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_783532] - Healthcare

stewardship meets national regulatory standards  for waiver of informed consent under the O ffice of Human 
Research Protections (OHRP) criteria 45 CFR 46.116(d), 117(c) (2) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
CFR 56.109(c) (1).(38) since 1) trial activities meet minimal risk criteria, 2) the trial randomizes hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], not 
patients,  to a q uality improvement strategy,  3) the intervention is not designed to supplant physician judgment, 
but rather provide relevant infor mation to prescribing physicians who will be educated to choose the treatment 
they deem most clinically appropriate for indivi dual patients, and 4) all assigned activities will be performed 
according to usual  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341083]. We wil l also collect attestations from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_783533] s tewardship efforts.   
 B.1.5 Randomization  
While this study represents a large cluster -randomized trial of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], simple r andomization of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554897], and without care could even result in very 
unequal numbers of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341086]. Achieving balance on key features of the randomization units (in 
this case, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]) is a critical task in cluster -randomized trials, but little literature on it exist s. Unlike 
individually -randomized trials, inform ation about the clusters is  often known in advance, but the number of 
clusters to be randomized can be relatively small. The existence of a priori data can mitigate the small 
numbers and help to obtain adequate balance through stratification or other methods. One attractive approach 
is to establish tuplets —matched sets (pairs, for a two- arm trial) –  in which one member of each tuplet is 
assigned to each arm. Schemes for constructing tuplets need not be guided by [CONTACT_75780]. A formal approach 
would be to calculate the Mahalanobis distance between hospi[INVESTIGATOR_783534]. In this approach, we could standardize the variables, and then 
multiply by [CONTACT_783565] i n the importance of balancing them. Other approaches 
are more ad hoc, such as prioritizing broad classes of balance on a key v ariable and making pairs within these 
strata based on lower -priority variables. However, there is no “best” method of tuplet const ruction, only sets 
that com e closer to meeting the varied needs of each trial.  
We will establish the pairs under several plausible tuplet -construction schemes, and use graphical 
methods to compare all possible realizations for balance between the arms und er each scheme. For example, 
 
  
[ADDRESS_1077399] on balance in this 
case,  we will use a parallel coordinates plot, a multivariate plot method. After determining key variables where 
balance across t he arms would be highly desirable, we will plot the mean difference between the arms for all 
key variables for each  potential realized randomization.  
We will focus on balancing the baseline outcome values in participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_783535] s that may be associated with pneumonia such as  facility pneumonia admission volume, local prevalence 
of antibiotic resistance in pneumonia patients, length- of-stay, ICU transfers, and facility case mix of pat ients  
with pneumonia.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_783536] a single hospi[INVESTIGATOR_783537].  
 
B.1.6 Baseline Period Activities  
 The baseline period will  be a 18 month  period from April 1, 2017 -  Septe mber 30, 2018 , prior to the 
phase in and will share a similar month distribution as the intervention period. This period will provide baseline 
outcome data for both arms (see Analysis Section B.1.10). In addi tion to recruitment and randomization, 
preparatory activities for Phase- In and Intervention Periods will also begin. The corporate HCA  Healthcare 
Information Technology (IT) team will develop the CPOE smart prompt template which will include creation of 
smart prompt algorithms, automated compliance reports, and centralized beta testing. CPOE smart prompts 
will use MDRO infection risk estimates developed in a separate retrospective cohort  study . Educational 
materials and training modules will be developed as  described below.  
 
B.1.[ADDRESS_1077400], the implementation of the CPOE smart prompt requires both corporate and local IT 
department efforts. This will require time to accurately implement and ensure sufficient validation and refinement for proper function at each participating intervention arm hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
During this period, educational material s will be distributed to study champi[INVESTIGATOR_783538] (Table 2). In addition, study site champi[INVESTIGATOR_783539]- In period, ultimately transitioning to every other month calls when 
implementa tion and feedback stabilizes. Special coaching calls will also occur at least quarterly for both arms 
and involve best practice stewardship recommendations from national guidelines and experts. All coaching 
calls will be led by [CONTACT_783566] p. 
Coaching calls will involve a shared PowerPoi nt slide set followed by a question and answer s ession. All 
coaching calls will be recorded and placed on arm -specific INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_21392] -ASP Pneumonia Trial sites o n the HCA 
Healthcare intranet for continued access by [CONTACT_341151]. Participant s will be highly 
encouraged to share concerns and solutions with one another.

available) , including reasons for continuing with extended spectrum antibiotic prescribing.   Pharmacy/physician

to the trial Steering Committee for determination of trial conflict. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_783543].   
 
B.1.9 INSPIR E-ASP Pneumonia Trial Outcomes 
The goal of this trial is to reduce unnecessary physician prescribing of empi[INVESTIGATOR_341102] -spectrum 
antibiotics  (Table 8) . Trial outcomes evaluating intervention effectiveness ar e outlined in Table [ADDRESS_1077402] three days of an 
admission. We define thi s outcome as an Extended- Spectrum Days Of Therapy (ES- DOT) per empi[INVESTIGATOR_341105].   
Days of therapy (DOT) is specific  to each extended- spectrum antibiotic, where any dose is considered one 
day’s worth of therapy. The ES antibiotics are then aggregated to obtain t he total ES DOT. For e xample , if a 
patient is st arted on vancomycin and cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_341106] 1 day, this will count as  2 ES DOT for that day. Multiple 
 
  
9 
 
 doses of the same antibiotic received on the same day are only counted as one day of therapy  for that 
extended sp ectrum antibiotic . This outcome will include  antibiotic s in Table 1.

Safety outcomes planned for the primary manus cript are shown in Table 4. Safety outcomes will be analyzed 
separately from the main effectiveness outcomes of the trial (see Primary Statistical Analysis section below).

B.1.[ADDRESS_1077404] three days of an 
admission. We define this outcome as an Extended- Spectrum Days Of Therapy (ES -DOT) per empir ic day. For 
clarity the calculation is as follows: we define a DOT for a particular ES antibiotic as a  day in which any number 
of doses of that antibioti c is given. Different ES antibiotics are summed across the empi[INVESTIGATOR_783546], then divided by [CONTACT_597818][INVESTIGATOR_341115] -admission to determine each admission’s 
DOT per at -risk da y. If an admission is less than [ADDRESS_1077405] an ICD -10 claims code 
indicating pneumonia is present on ad mission, who received any antibiotic within 3 days of admission, and who 
were admitted to a non -ICU loc ation. For admissions initially on a non -ICU flo or and transferred to the ICU, 
analysis will include only admission days on the non- ICU floor within 3 days of admission.  
 
  
10 
 
 The trial periods are defined as follows: (1) Baseline –  April 1, 2017 –  September 30, 2018 (18 months); 
(2) Phase- in – October 1, 2018 – March 31, 2019 (6 months); (3) Intervention – April 1, 2019 –  June 30, 2020 
(15 months).  
The unit  of analysis will be individual admissions. Individuals can contribute more than one admission. The 
analy tic model will be a generalized linear mixed eff ects model for differences in differences, with random 
effects accounting for correlation within cluster,  period- varying random effects to allow for differences between 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341116] -up, and admission- level random effects to account for  correlation within 
person and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Analyses of the baseline data, performed before randomization, found no evidence of 
overdispersion in a Poisson model, and so we plan to use that model for analysis of outcomes.  The model can 
be expressed as follo ws: 
 
where y_ijph is the ES -DOT per at -risk day for patient i for admission j in period p at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] h, and A_ijph=1 if 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] h is in the intervention arm and 0 if not, and T_ijph=[ADDRESS_1077406] diffe rent mean ES -DOT per at -risk day across multiple admis sions. Equivalently, they allow for correlation 
within hospi[INVESTIGATOR_783547] -up. 
The assessment of trial success will be determined by [CONTACT_783567] β_3, w hich assesses whether  the log relative rate of the outcome due to being in the intervention arm in 
the intervention period is different from 0. The exponentiated parameter estimate for β_3 is the estimated 
relative rate of ES -DOT  per at -risk day due to the intervention, relati ve to the baseline period. For example, if 
β_3  had a negative value and a p- value <0.05, we would conclude that the pat ient-specific CPOE smart 
prompts generated a benefit over routine care. Exponentiating t he parameter value would provides an estimate 
of the relative reduction due to the intervention in the expected ES -DOT per at -risk day.  
The primary trial analysis will use an as -randomized unadjusted model with two- tailed significance set 
at alpha = 0.05.  Secondary outcomes also will be assessed using an as -randomized unadjusted model with 
adjustment for multiple comparisons with two- tailed significance set at alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_1077407] conservative manner to identify 
potential safety issues. This is required because a reduction in ES -DOT might be achieved only by [CONTACT_783568]. Each safety outcome will be evaluated for non -
inferiority using an as -randomized unadjusted model with a one -tailed significance set at alpha = 0.05.  
Analy ses planned for these assessments are proportional hazards models with random effects (t o account for 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341117]). These models ar e sometimes called frailty or shared frailty models. Because these are safety 
outcomes, we do not intend to make adjustm ents for multiple comparisons in testing them, further increasing 
conservatism.  
All anal yses will be performed using current versions of  SAS (Version 9.4, as of writing, SAS Institute, 
Cary NC) and/or R (Version 4.0, as of writing).   
 
B.1.11 Powe r Size/Sample Size Calculations  
Power assessment proceeded as follows, using a Monte Carlo approac h. We used available data to 
define a baseline period of 10/1/2015 -12/31/2016 in a bootstrap procedure. Individuals were selected with 
replacement from within  each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], once to represent baseline data and separately to represent 
 
  
11 
 
 intervention period da ta. In the randomization portion of the Monte Carlo approach, we ordered the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_783548] “size”, meaning the number of admissions with pneumonia. Then,  within strata of 6 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], we orde red by 
[INVESTIGATOR_5165]-DOT per at -risk day. Then we took pairs of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_783549] h adjacent ES -DOT per at -risk day and assigned 
one member of the pair to one arm. To do this, a single pseudo- random number uniformly distributed between 
0 and 1 was generated for each pair.  If it was less than 0.5, the arbitrary “first” member of the pai r was 
assigned to Routine Care and the other to Intervention.  If it was greater than or equal to 0.5, then the 
assignments were reversed. The remaining unpai red hospi[INVESTIGATOR_66537] 59 units wer e assigned as the “first” 
member of a pair with no match. (Three s ets of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341120] a stewardship progr am and these 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_783550] a single hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341122].)  
If an admission was in th e intervention arm in the intervention period, then their ES -DOT per at -risk day 
was reduced by a propor tion, given below. The reduction of ES -DOT per a t-risk day was selected with a lower 
bound determined by [CONTACT_341157]- for effect of th e inte rvention with minimal clinical 
significance, and the impact in the Monte Carlo calculation on a pe r-admission basis was to reduce the days of 
therapy proportionately between this number and 1, on a uniform distribution. In other words, if the effect of the  
intervention was to multiply doses by [CONTACT_182739] .9, each person would have their doses multipl ied by [INVESTIGATOR_82473] 
.[ADDRESS_1077408] 12.5% relative to usual care. Using the m ethod above, we have 97% power (CI 91- 99%) 
to de tect this effect. Table 5 below shows the calculated power and confidence intervals for the primary and 
secondary outcomes to be evaluated in our primary manuscript.

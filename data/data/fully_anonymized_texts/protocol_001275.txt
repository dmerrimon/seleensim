STUDY DESIGN: 
ECOSPOR IV; Cohort 1 is an open-label extension of Study SERES-012. This study is designed to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, and efficacy of a SER-109 treatment regimen in adult subjects 18 years of age or older with 
recurrent Clostridioides. difficile  infection (RCDI), who received a SER-[ADDRESS_337675] responded to CDI SOC antibiotic therapy defined as 10 to 21 days 
of treatment with vancomycin [125 mg QID] or fidaxomicin [200 mg BID] will be eligible to enroll in Study 
SERES-013, and will receive a SER-109 treatm ent regimen. A SER-109 treatment regimen is  
 adm inistered orally in 4 capsules once daily for 3 consecutive days.  
Subjects being considered for SERES-01 3 will start screening for 013 at the Recurrence Visit of Study SERES-
012.  Subjects with a confirmed recurrence of CDI will receive 10 to 21 days of treatment with vancomycin [125 mg QID] or fidaxomicin [200 mg BID]. On Day -1, within 3 days of completion of SOC antibiotic treatment for 
their CDI, subjects will undergo a bowel cleanse followed by [CONTACT_276833] 1. 
  Laboratory values or procedures obtained during the screening window and from the central laboratory of Study 
SERES-012 (e.g. Recurrence Visit) do not need to be  repeated at the Screening Visit for SERES-013. The 
SERES-012 Recurrence Visit may be used for the SERES-013 Screening Visit. However, if the SERES-012 Recurrence Visit occurred outside the SERES-013 screening window (Day -24 to Day -2), the required screening 
procedures for SERES-[ADDRESS_337676] not taken study drug when contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], they will be reminded to do so as soon as possible. From 
Day 1 to Week 8, all subjects will be contact[CONTACT_276834], with the exception of a 
home or in-clinic visit at Week 2 and an in-clinic visit at Week 8, and queried for adverse events (AEs) and diarrheal symptoms. After Week 8, all subjects will be contact[CONTACT_276835] 4 weeks 
(i.e., Weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24) and queried for serious adverse events [SAEs] and adverse events of special 
interest [AESIs]). Health-relat ed quality of life and health outcomes will be assessed throughout the study via the 
CDI-specific, Cdiff32 Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) 
questionnaires. 
To document epi[INVESTIGATOR_119999], su bjects will complete a diarrhea log (see  Investigator Site File) to include

central laboratory stool testing. Data from the C. difficile  toxin test (either EIA or CCNA), performed at the central 
laboratory, will be used for the primary endpoint analysis. The central laboratory results will be communicated to 
the investigator and the decision to treat with antibiotics will be based upon the investigator’s assessment. 
The schedule of assessments and procedures is provided in Table 1. 
 
The Open-Label cohort (Cohort 2) w ill commence after the last subject from SERES-[ADDRESS_337679] recu rrence of CDI. Approximately -200 subjects are expected to be enrolled in 
Cohort 2  
In Cohort 2, subjects with symptoms suggestive of RCDI may submit a stool sample for CDI toxin or PCR 
testing at a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendmen t (CLIA)- certified local laboratory or the central 
laboratory with a prescreening  or screening consent.  Stool samples submitted to the central lab for pre-screening 
and screening will be tested using a PCR . test.   All subjects who are confirmed to have toxin  or PCR positive 
CDI at prescreening will undergo all Screening Visit assessments after providing signed informed consent. 
Subjects with one or more recurrences of CDI (including the current epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]) who have responded to CDI 
antibiotic therapy defined as 10 to 42 days of treatment with vancomycin or 10 to 25 days of fidaxomicin [200

 4. INTRODUCTION  
Clostridioides difficile  is a sporeforming Gram-positive anaerobe present throughout the 
environment and, in low amounts, can be a compone nt of the gut flora of a healthy individual. 
Clostridioides difficile  infection (CDI) usually develops in pa tients with a history of antibiotic use 
that depletes the norma l gut flora, enabling C. difficile  to colonize and proliferate within the colon, 
elaborating virulent toxins A and B. These t oxins invade epi[INVESTIGATOR_276801], resulting in damage to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_276802]. 
The clinical manifestations of CDI vary broadl y, ranging from nuisance diarrhea lasting a few 
days, to more pronounced disease with severe  colonic inflammation that can develop into 
pseudomembranous colitis with associated syst emic toxicity requiring lifesaving colectomy. 
With ever increasing use of antib iotics, particularly in the agi ng populations in ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_276803], the incidence of C. difficile - associated disease has been increasing such that 
C. difficile  is the leading cause of nosocomial infection in the [LOCATION_002] (US). The Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention estimate that C. difficile  causes diarrhea linke d to approximately 
29,000 American deaths each year ( Lessa et al, 2015 ). In Canada, there are approximately 37,900 
CDI epi[INVESTIGATOR_276804] (2012); 7980 (21%) of these are relapses ( Levy, 2015 ). In the European 
Union (EU), the number of reported cases of CDI has also increased in recent years, and is 
estimated to affect 172,[ADDRESS_337701] been implicated in 
association with CDI. The mechanistic link to an tibiotic use is based on th e finding that a healthy 
microbial ecology resists pathogen colonization by [CONTACT_276842] ( Theriot et al, 2014; Weingarden- et al, 2014 ). Antibiotic use disrupts the microbiota and 
liberates nutrients that enable colonization by C. difficile (Ng et al, 2013 ).  
The incidence of recurrent CDI has paralleled th e increased incidence of primary infection. CDI 
recurs in approximately 25% of  patients after antibiotic treat ment for first time disease ( Bakken et 
al, 2011; Depestel and Aronoff, 2013; Surawicz- et al, 2013 ). After the first recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], 
patients are at an even higher risk for subsequent  CDI, estimated to be > 60% after the second or 
subsequent epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] ( Higa and Kelly, 2013 ). There are few proven, a pproved therapeutic options 
for significantly reducing CDI recu rrence in patients with recurrent CDI. Some patients are treated 
with antibiotics indefinitely to avoid persis tent diarrhea and other sequelae of CDI. 
SER-109 is an Ecobiotic  drug being developed for the treatmen t of adults with recurrent CDI. 
SER-[ADDRESS_337702] from inactive components 
and formulating and encapsulating the spores fo r oral delivery. SER-109 is administered to 
subjects after completion of a course of  antibiotic therapy fo r recurrent CDI.  
SER-109 has been shown to prevent CDI and to treat C. difficile  relapse in nonclin ical studies in 
mice and hamsters (see Investigator’s Brochure fo r more information). Clinical experience with 
SER-109 includes four studies : 1) a completed open-label, two-pa rt study in 30 subjects with a 
history of 3 or more occurrences of CDI (S ERES-001); 2) a completed double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel-gro up study in adults with recurrent CDI (SERES-004); 3) a completed 
expanded access for intermediate-size patient populations and open-labe l extension of study

Of the other SAEs, 3 were seve re including diarrhea related to C. difficile , recurrent syncope, and

hyperkalemia and exacerbation of end-stage renal di sease, and pancolitis. These SAEs and fatality 
rates are consistent with thos e expected in the study populatio n with multiple comorbidities. 
SERES-012 was a stratified, ra ndomized, double-blind placebo-co ntrolled Phase 3 study, that 
enrolled subjects with recurrent CDI defined as 2 or more recurrences of CDI in the previous 12 
months. Subjects were stratified by [CONTACT_654] (< \HDUV  65 years) and antibiotic treatment of the

This is a summary from the interi m analysis dataset. The majority of the 182 subjects were female

 primarily used polymerase chain reaction testing (PCR), also known as nucleic acid amplification

controlled trial, with statistically significant and clinically meaningful  improvement observed. 
4.2. Rationale  
There are few proven, approved therapeutic options  for significantly reducing CDI recurrence in 
patients with recurrent CDI.   
This study is being conducted primar ily to gather safety and tolerability data  as well as efficacy 
from subjects exposed to SER-109 at the dose used in SERES-012. In addition to subjects rolling 
over from SERES-012 (Cohort 1), subjects with first recurrence or more will be eligible for Cohort 
2. There are no data to suggest diffe rences in safety profile in subj ects with at least one recurrence 
versus those with at least two recurrences. In a Phase 3b/4 study that described safety in groups 
with 0, 1, or 2 recurrences, there were no differe nces when comparing an extended pulsed course 
of fidaxomicin with vancomycin ( Cornely 2019 ).

The majority of subjects enrolled in the trial were having their first occurrence  of CDI.  Those with 
first and second recurrence make up a small propor tion of subjects.  However, there does not 
appear to be an increased AE, SAE, or death ra te going from first occurr ence to second and third 
occurrences.  These data support inclusion of fi rst recurrence (second occu rrence) subjects in the 
larger safety population.  Enrollment of patients w ith first CDI recurrence will allow participating 
centers to present the protocol to a higher numbe r of subjects, who previo usly did not qualify.  
The reason to require toxin testin g in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_276808].  However, this significantly limited 
availability of treatment to a popul ation in whom toxin testing was available.  Inclusion criteria 
have been broadened to allow evaluation of safe ty and tolerability in subjects who may receive 
SER-[ADDRESS_337716] for C. difficile . In the IDSA treatment guidelines, 
diagnosis of C. difficile  infection using PCR alone is accepta ble in patients w ho meet clinical 
diagnostic criteria (McDonald 2018). Subjects who have been treated with longer duration and

care durations of antibiotics to wards prolonged and tapering courses (McDonald 2018, Cornely 
2019). Broadening eligibili ty to subjects with C. difficile  infection who do not have access to toxin 
EIA testing or who have received longer courses of antibiotics prior to study participation better 
reflect ‘real world’ management of CDI patients.  Subjects prev iously screened in SERES-012 
who did not receive SER-109 and had not previous ly rolled over to SERES-013 will also be 
eligible. 
4.2.1.  Rationale for Dose and Treatment Regimen 
In this study, subjects will receive a dose of SER109 ( ) 
per day for [ADDRESS_337718] microbiome 
demonstrates that spore forming species richness in  the subjects' GI tract at 1 week was positively 
correlated with SER-109 dose. Importantly, of subjects who recurred in SERES-004, about 50% 
of recurrences in both placebo and SER109 arms happened by [CONTACT_2006] 10 and 75% by [CONTACT_2006] 20, starting 
as early as Day 3. In SERES-004, the engraftmen t of SER-109 spore-forming bacteria in treated 
subjects’ gastrointestinal tracts was less robust a nd less rapid as compared to that observed in 
SERES-001, although it was signif icantly greater than the changes in placebo-treated 
subjects. Engraftment improved at  later time points, but due to  early recurrences, the SER-109-
induced microbiome change in SERES-[ADDRESS_337719] dosing is correlate d with better clinical outcome. In aggregate, these observations 
are central to the design of the proposed re gimen that provides a higher daily dose ( ) 
repeated daily over [ADDRESS_337720] observed recurrences, three (3) doses will be 
administered on Days 1-[ADDRESS_337721] 
C. difficile bacteria regardless of toxin production. This phenomenon has called into question 
whether a positive PCR or NAAT result reflects clinical disease or represents C. difficile 
colonization ( Polange et al, 2015 ).  
Thus, in SERES-004, the diagnostic test for entry may not have differentiated subjects with active 
CDI disease from those with C. difficile  carriage. This would lead to enrolling subj ects who may 
be experiencing a post-CDI irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) if colonized by C. difficile. IBS 
following CDI is reported to occur in up to 25% of CDI patients ( Wadhwa et al, 2016 ). This would

ECOSPOR IV – Cohort 1 is an open-label extens ion of Study SERES-012. This study is designed 
to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy  of a treatment regimen SER-109 in adult subjects 
18 years of age or older with recurrent Clostridioides difficile  infection (RCDI), who received a 
treatment regimen of SER-[ADDRESS_337724]-of-care (SOC) antibio tic treatment for CDI (i.e. vanc omycin [125 mg QID] and/or 
fidaxomicin [200 mg BID]) will be eligible to enroll and receive a treatment regimen of SER-109 
in Study SERES-013. A treatment regimen of SER-109 is administered orally as  
 in 4 capsules once daily for 3 consecutive days. Approximately 30 
eligible subjects with recurrent CDI disease from Study SE RES-012 are expected to enroll in 
Cohort 1. Approximately 200 subjects will be enro lled through the Open-Label program in Cohort 
2For Cohort 2, subjects with one or more recurre nces of CDI (including the current epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]) who 
have responded to CDI an tibiotic therapy defined as 10 to 42 days of treatment with vancomycin 
[125 mg QID] or 10 – 25 days of  fidaxomicin [200 mg BID] will be  potentially eligible to enroll 
in Study SERES-013 to receive a SER-109 treatment regimen. 
The study duration is approximately 27 weeks, in cluding a ~3-week Screening Period, an 8-week 
Efficacy Period, and a 16-week Follow-up Period fr om initiation of treatment on Day 1. Subjects 
treated with prolonged or tapering doses of antibiotics after prescr eening confirmation of CDI will 
be screened during the 3-week scr eening period (Day -24 to Day -2) 
In Cohort 1, favorable clinical out come, or sustained clinical res ponse, will be determined by [CONTACT_276837] 8  weeks after initiation of treatment of study drug, with CDI 
UHFXUUHQFHGHILQHGDV  [ADDRESS_337725] on a stool sample determined by a t oxin assay and a decision  by [CONTACT_093] 
(based on clinical assessment) that antibiotic treatment is needed. Data from the C. difficile  toxin 
assay (either enzyme immunoassay [EIA] or cell cytotoxicity neutrali zation assay [CCNA]), 
performed at the central laboratory, will be used  for the primary endpoint analysis. The central 
laboratory results will be communicat ed to the investigator and the decision to treat with antibiotics 
will be based upon the investigator’s assessment. 
In Cohort 2, favorable clinical out come, or sustained clinical res ponse, will be determined by [CONTACT_276837] [ADDRESS_337726] 
For Cohort 1, screening will begin at the Recurr ence Visit of Study SERES-012. Eligible subjects, 
or their legally authorized representative, will provide informed consent and undergo all baseline 
evaluations at the Screening Visit. Assessments  performed at the Recu rrence Visit of Study 
SERES-012 do not need to be repeated, if pe rformed within the SERES-013 screening window 
(Day -24 to Day -2) and from the cen tral laboratory of study SERES-012.

 For Cohort 2, subjects with symptoms suggestive of RCDI may submit a stool sample for CDI 
toxin or PCR testing at a Clin ical Laboratory Improvement Amen dment (CLIA)- certified local 
laboratory or the central laborat ory with a prescreening or screening consent. The central 
laboratory will only be performing PCR testing on  qualifying CDI. All subj ects who are confirmed 
to be toxin or PCR positive at prescreening wi ll undergo all Screening Vi sit assessments after 
providing signed informed consent.   Subjects who were previously  test negative who have a new 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_276809]-scr eening or screening using a new consent and study number. 
Cohort 1 subjects will receive 10 to 21 days of treatment with vancomycin [125 mg QID] or 
fidaxomicin [200 mg BID]. On Day 1, within 3 da ys of completion of SOC antibiotic treatment 
for their CDI, subjects will undergo a bowel cl eanse by [CONTACT_144059] 10 oz. (~300 mL) of oral 
magnesium citrate followed by [CONTACT_276848]. Subjects with impaired kidney function who are 
unable to take magnesium citrate will take 250 mL of GoLytely (p olyethylene glycol electrolyte 
solution).   
Subjects will come to the clinic after an overnight  fast on Day 1 to receive a dose of oral SER-109 
( ) in [ADDRESS_337727] all safety evalua tions performed. On Day 1, subjects will be 
dispensed a 2-day supply of SER-109 ( ) in [ADDRESS_337728] not taken study

all subjects will be contact[CONTACT_276834], with the exception of a 
home or in-clinic visit at Week 2 and an in-clini c visit at Week 8, and queried for adverse events 
(AEs) and diarrheal symptoms. After Week 8, all subjects will be contact[CONTACT_276838] 4 weeks (i.e., Weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24) and queried for serious adverse events 
[SAEs] and adverse events of special interest [A ESIs]). Health-related quali ty of life and health 
outcomes will be assessed throughout the study via the CDI-specific, Cdiff32 Health Related 
Quality of Life (HRQoL) and EuroQol 5 Dime nsion 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaires. 
All AEs, SAEs/AESIs, and concomitant medications  will be collected from initiation of study drug 
administration up to Week 8. From Week 8 up to  Week 24, all SAEs/AESIs  and SAE/AESI-related 
data, and any antibiotic medication and its corresponding indication will be collected.

8.1. SER-109 
SER-109 is an ecology of bacterial spores enrich ed from stool donations obtained from healthy, 
screened donors. SER-109 is formulated as an oral  capsule for administration to patients following 
cessation of antibiotic therapy. 
8.1.1.  Donor Screening 
Donors undergo a general health examination incl uding gastrointestinal (GI) medical history, 
familial GI medical history, blood chemistry, hema tology with complete blood count, urinalysis,

successfully complete the physical screening and laborato ry tests after the donation period before 
the material can be released for manufacturing. A description of donor screening procedures is 
provided in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
8.1.2.  Manufacturing and Storage 
SER-109 is manufactured using current Good Manufac turing Practice (GMP).   Stool raw material 
is sourced from donors who are screened for health history, physical status, and a panel of pathogen 
tests; materials from a single donor are pooled to  make a manufacturing lot.  The manufacturing 
process inactivates non-spore forms of live bacteria and fungi, and pot ential parasites and viruses, 
and substantially reduces the amount of undige sted food and inactivated non-spore components 
via successive separation steps.  The purified mate rial is then concentrated  to enable oral capsule 
formulation, stored frozen, and qual ity control tested until formulation. 
8.2. SER-109 Kit Storage and Handling 
The investigational produc t (SER-109) will be provided as a pe r subject kit to include 3 bottles 
containing four size 00 capsules ( ) in an  opaque, [ADDRESS_337745] compliance to  study drug will be checked by [CONTACT_276853](s) and documented in the CRFs (e.g., tablet count). Subjects will be instructed to

8.4. Method of Assigning Patients to Study Treatment  
This is an open-label study. All subjects who qualify for dosing will  receive single daily doses of 
SER-109 ( ) in [ADDRESS_337746] ered over 3 consecutive days.

11. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY A ND ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 
All AEs, SAEs/AESIs, and concomitant medications will be collected from  the time of initiation 
of study drug up to Week 8. From Week 8 up to Week 24, all SAEs/AESIs  and SAE/AESI-related 
data, and any antibiotic medication and its corresponding indication will be collected.  
The investigator is responsible for: 
x Informing the sponsor in the event that a subject or a subject’s partner becomes 
pregnant during the study. A “Pregnancy Report Form” will be generated and the 
pregnancy will be captured in the safety da tabase and will be followed through to the 
outcome. 
x Instructing subjects in the self-reporting of selected AEs incl uding diarrhea and 
abdominal discomfort. 
x Evaluating subject safety including assessmen t of AEs for seriousness, severity, and 
causality. 
x Informing the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) 
of AEs as required and SAEs as per IRB/IEC guidelines. 
For the purpose of this study, an AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject 
who was administered study drug, regardless of its  causal relationship to  the study drug. An AE 
can, therefore, be any unfavorable  and unintended sign (including an  abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with  the use of the study drug, whether or not it is 
considered related to the study drug. 
An SAE is any AE regardless of causality that: 
x Results in death. 
Seres Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol: SERES-013 
CONFIDENTIAL 
Amendment 8 Date: [ADDRESS_337777] caused death.  
x Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_187868]; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128895]/or surgical operations sche duled to occur during the study period, but 
planned before study entry are not considered  AEs if the illness or disease existed 
before the subject was enrolled in the st udy, provided that it di d not worsen in any 
unexpected manner during the study (e.g., surg ery performed earlier than planned). 
x Results in persistent or significant disabi lity/incapacity. Disabil ity is defined as a 
substantial disruption of a subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
x Is associated with a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
x Is an important medical event. An important medical event is an event that may not 
result in death, be life threat ening, or require hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_276824], based upon appropriate medical ju dgment, may jeopardize the subject and 
may require medical or surgical interventi on to prevent one of the outcomes listed in 
the definition of an SAE. Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias, convulsions that  do not result in inpati ent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) (serious  or non-serious) is one of  scientific and medical 
concern specific to the produc t or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid 
communication by [CONTACT_276866]. 
In this protocol, an invasive infection (e.g., bact eremia, abscess, meningitis) is designated as an 
AESI, and as such, will be reported and followed in the same manner as an SAE during the course 
of the study. 
All AEs, including SAEs and AESIs, will be graded for severity by [CONTACT_276867]' ( Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 (CTCAE) 
Publish Date: May 28, 2009 with the exception of diarrhea .  Criteria for diarrhea severity will be 
as follows:   
x mild: 3-4 unformed bowel movements per day 
x moderate: 5-6 unformed bowel movements per day 
x VHYHUHXQIRUPHGERZHOPRYHPHQWVSHUGD\  
 
In general, the severity of AEs can be assessed using following guidelines: Severity Description 
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms ; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive in tervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate 
instrumental activities of daily living* 
Seres Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol: SERES-013 
CONFIDENTIAL 
Amendment 8 Date: 16 February 2021   Page 67 of 80 
  Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threaten ing; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8942]; disabli ng; limiting self-care activities of daily living 
(ADL)** 
*Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_276825], using the 
telephone, managing money, etc. **Self-care ADL refer to bath ing, dressing and undressing, 
feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, a nd not bedridden. Changes in  the severity of an 
AE will be documented, and documentation will in clude assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of intensity. Adverse events charact erized as intermittent will be documented based 
on the severity, onset, and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
An abnormal laboratory test finding that meets any of the criteria below will be considered an AE: 
x Is associated with accompanying symptoms; 
x Requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; 
x Leads to a concomitant drug treatment or any change in a concomitant medication or 
therapy; 
x Is considered an AE by [CONTACT_093]. 
Laboratory results that fall outside  the reference range and do not meet one of the criteria above 
will not be reported as AEs. Repeating a test becau se of an abnormal result, in the absence of the 
above conditions, does not constitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an 
error will not be re ported as an AE. 
For all AEs, including SAEs, the investigator will report on the re lationship of the AE to the study 
drug by [INVESTIGATOR_1477]: 
x Unrelated : There is little or no chance that the study drug caused the AE; other 
conditions, including concurrent illnesses, pr ogression or expression of the disease 
state, or a reaction to a concomitant  medication best explain the event 
x Related  or Possibly Related : The association of the AE with the study drug is 
unknown; however, the AE is not clearly du e to another condition, or a reasonable 
temporal association exists between the AE  and treatment administration and, based on 
the investigator’s clinical experience, the association of the AE with the study drug 
seems likely 
Adverse events, including local and systemic reac tions not considered medi cally serious, will be 
recorded. Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, investigator 
assessment of severity, relationship to study drug, date of resolution  of the event, seriousness, and 
outcome. Additionally, serious criteria  will be collected for all SAEs. 
Any medical condition that is present at the time th at the subject is screened will be considered as 
a baseline condition and not be reported as an AE. However, if it worsens at any time during the 
study, it should be recorded as an AE.

 a stool sample determined by a toxin assay, and assessment by [CONTACT_276868]) should NOT be entered as  an AE. Events of diarrhea that are not associated with CDI 
recurrence (e.g., due to food poisoni ng or flu), should be reported as an AE (e.g., Diarrhea [Not 
CDI related]). Other symptoms associated with  CDI recurrence, e.g. abdominal pain, abdominal 
distension, should be report ed as adverse events. 
When CDI recurrence is deemed se rious due to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], CD I recurrence should be included 
as an SAE  term and recorded as the reason for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_276826]. 
11.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
The sponsor has requirements for expedited repor ting of SAEs meeting specific criteria to 
worldwide regulatory authorities. Therefore, the sponsor (or sponso r’s designee) must be notified 
immediately regarding any SAE that occurs  after administration of the study drug. 
All SAEs must be reported to the medical monito r within 24 hours of know ledge of the event at 
the study site. Refer to the Investigator Site File for deta iled instructions. 
The study site will tr ansmit an SAE report (SAE R) to the sponsor or sponsor’s designee by 
[CONTACT_276869]. The study site will be prov ided with SAER forms wherein the following 
information is requested: 
x Subject identification, investigator name, and study site number 
x SAE information: event term, onset date, se verity, and causal relationship to study drug 
x The outcomes attributable to the event (i.e. serious criteria) (e.g., de ath, life threatening, 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of  existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1838], a congenital 
anomaly, a persistent or significant disability  or incapacity, or ot her important medical 
event) 
x A summary of relevant test results, pertin ent laboratory data, a nd any other relevant 
medical history 
x The date of study drug administration 
x Whether or not the stud y drug was discontinued

received any amount of SER-109. All safety  analyses will be conducted based on the 
Safety Population. 
12.3. Determination of Sample Size 
Approximately 30 subjects are anticipated to enroll from SERES-012 (Cohort 1). The recurrence 
rates prior to 8 weeks after initiation of study drug assumed in SERES-012 are 16% in SER109 
and 36% in placebo. However, it is expected that only a fraction of subjects who recur in SERES-
012 prior to 8 weeks will roll-ove r to this study, since a follow-up of 8 weeks from start of study 
drug in earlier protocol versions of SERES-012  (up through and including Amendment 5) was 
required before rolling over to SERES-013, regardle ss of when the CDI recurrence occurred in 
SERES-012. Additionally, 200 subjects with RCDI may enroll in the Open-Label program (Cohort 
2) into SERES-013. Approximately [ADDRESS_337784] data will be produced.  
All summary tables will be presented based on the following groups: For Cohort 1, 1) Subjects 
who were randomized to SER-109 in SERES-012, 2)  Subjects who were randomized to placebo 
in SERES-012, 3) Overall (groups 1 and 2 combined ).  For Safety and To lerability and Primary 
Efficacy, summary tables will include an additi onal fourth group consisting of Cohort 2 . The 
safety summary will be presented combining all subjects (pooling c ohort 1 and cohort 2). 
A comprehensive statistical analysis plan (SAP ) will be submitted to regulatory authorities. 
12.5. Subject Population and Baseline Characteristics 
Enrollment, protocol deviations, and discontinuations from the st udy will be summarized by [CONTACT_276873]. Demographics (e.g., age, race, ethnicity, sex), ba seline characteristics 
(e.g., weight,), medical history, and other baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_276874], ITT and mITT Populations.

Amendment 8 Date: [ADDRESS_337800] Information and Informed Consent 
Before any testing under this prot ocol, including screening tests a nd assessments, written informed 
consent with the IRB/IEC approved ICF must be  obtained from the subject or their legally 
authorized representative (LAR) in accordance with local practice and regulations. 
For Cohort 2, a prescreen consent will be available for testing the stool for C. difficile  toxin or 
PCR assay either at the local or central laboratory.   The central laboratory will test with the PCR 
assay for eligibility. 
The background of the proposed study, procedures, and benefits and risks of the study must be 
explained to the subject or LAR.  The subject or LAR must be gi ven sufficient time to consider 
whether to participate in the study. 
A copy of the ICF, signed and dated by [CONTACT_276879], must be given to the subject or LAR. 
Each ICF should contain an authorization allowing the investigator to use and disclose subject 
health information (i.e., subject identifiable health information) in compliance with local law. 
13.5. Subject Confidentiality 
Subject confidentiality is held strictly in trust by [CONTACT_276880]. 
This confidentiality is extended to cover testing of  biological samples in addition to the clinical 
information relating to participating subjects. Th e investigator will grant a regulatory authority 
access to the subject’s original medical records for verification of data gathered, and to audit the 
data collection process. The subjects’ and donors’ confidentiality will be ma intained and will not 
be made publicly available to the extent pe rmitted by [CONTACT_4913]. 
Subjects will not be identified by [CONTACT_70882], and these reports will be used for 
research purposes only. 
13.6. Protocol Compliance 
The investigator will conduct the study in compli ance with the IRB/IEC approved protocol without 
any changes or deviations. Modifi cations to the protocol will re quire approval from the sponsor 
and written IRB/IEC approval before implementati on, except when the modification is needed to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to the subject. A ny change, intentional or otherwise, must be 
reported immediately to the sponsor and to the re levant IRB/IEC and/or regulatory authority as 
required by [CONTACT_276881]. Study sites that fail to  comply may be terminated. 
13.7. Future Use of Stored Specimens 
The sponsor may, where permitted by [CONTACT_276882], conduct future biomedical research on 
specimens (including serum, and stool) routinely a nd specifically collected during this clinical 
study for potential commercial use by [CONTACT_276883], Inc., and specimens may be stored for 
up to 10 years.  
13.8. Study Monitoring 
Regular monitoring is defined in ICH Guidan ce for Industry E6 Good Clinical Practice: 
Consolidated Guidance, Section 1.38, as “The act of overseeing the pr ogress of a clinical trial, and 
of ensuring that it is conducted, recorded, and re ported in accordance with the protocol, standard

Amendment 8 Date: 16 February 2021   Page 77 of 80 
 operating procedures, GCP, and the applicable  regulatory requirement(s).” The purpose of 
monitoring is to verify that: 
x The rights and well-being of the human subjects are protected. 
x The reported study data are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents. 
x The conduct of the study is in comp liance with the cu rrently approved 
protocol/amendment(s), with GCP, and with  the applicable regulatory requirements. 
It will be the responsibility of th e investigator to ensure that th e essential documents are available 
at the investigator or institutional site. Any or all of these documents may be pertinent to, and 
should be available for, monitoring by [CONTACT_276884]. 
The sponsor or an authorized sponsor representa tive will conduct regular  study site monitoring 
visits to review and validate st udy data as defined in the monito ring plan by [CONTACT_276885]’ 
medical records and eCRFs in accordance with written sta ndard operating procedures, ICH 
guidelines, GCP, and applicable regulations and guidelines. The investigator will allow 
representatives of the sponsor or regulatory authorities to inspect facilities and records relevant to 
this study. 
13.9. Case Report Forms and Study Records 
Data will be collected for this study by [CONTACT_276886]. The investigator and study site staff will 
receive training and support on th e use of the eCRF. All eCRF da ta are to be completed by [CONTACT_276887] d study site personnel. All data entry, modi fication, or deletion 
will be recorded automatically in the electronic  audit trail. All data changes will be clearly 
indicated with a means to locate prior values. A unique user identification and password will be 
assigned to all personnel approved to enter or cha nge data to prevent unauthorized access to the 
data.  
All electronic data entered by [CONTACT_3452] (inclu ding the electronic audit trai l) will be maintained 
or made available at the study site in complianc e with Title 21 Part 11 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) and other applic able retention regulations. The computerized system is able to 
generate accurate and complete copi[INVESTIGATOR_276831] s in paper or electronic form for inspection and 
review by [CONTACT_276888], the IRB/IEC/Resear ch Ethics Board, and auditors or 
other designees authorized by [CONTACT_456].  
In addition to capturing the user identification as pa rt of the audit trail for all data entry, the eCRF 
allows for application of electr onic signatures. The investigator or designated sub--investigator, 
after review of the data in the eCRF, will confirm the validity of each  subject’s data by [CONTACT_276889]. This electronic signature [CONTACT_116016] 21 CFR Part 11. 
The sponsor will retain the original eCRF data and audit trail. An electroni c or certified paper copy 
of all completed eCRF data, including query re solution correspondence, will be provided to the 
investigator at the end of the study.

Pre-Screening  prior to HIPAA Authorization  
Will any of the identification methods checked above involve 
access to Protected Health Information  (PHI)  prior to obtaining 
HIPAA Authorization ? 
☒ Yes  
☐ No 
• We request a Partial Waiver of HIPAA Authorization  for Screening 
Purposes. See Addendum E: Waiver/Alteration of HIPAA Authorization  
Recruitment of Potential Participant s:   
• We will use our electronic ED tracking board to identify potential 
adolescent participants . For those who are eligible per age as 
listed on the tracking board, the study team will check the 
electronic health record to determine if a research note for this 
study is present. Those adolescents who have already participated 
in this study are not el igible. The study team will approach  
potential participants sequentially during their ED visit based on 
arrival and availability. We will carefully time our approach of 
potentially eligible patients to minimize impact on patient care  
and ED flow . We will ensure balanced enrollment  in regard to  sex 
(male/female)  using data that is easily accessible on the electronic 
tracking board.  
 
9.0 Surveys and Psychometric  Testing:  
Study surveys were developed by [CONTACT_318326]. Surveys will be delivered via REDCap and completed on a 
ED-HEART Pi[INVESTIGATOR_318313] 9 of 36 
 smart phone, desktop, or tablet computer. Surveys  and their domains  are 
listed below.   
• Adolescents:  
o Baseline Survey  (intervention, control arms) : unique code 
questions,39 demographics, ARA victimization and 
perpetration,35,40,41 recognition of abusive behaviors,35,41 
self-efficacy,42 consequences of ARA, ARA resource 
knowledge/use,35 readiness to engage in healthy 
relationship behaviors  
o Exit Survey (intervention arm only) : fidelity, acceptability,  
self-efficacy,35 use of POC resources, ARA disclosure  
o Follow -up Survey  (intervention, control arms) : unique 
code questions,39 ARA victimization  and 
perpetration,35,40,41 recognition of abusive behaviors,35,41 
self-efficacy,35 consequences of ARA, ARA resource 
knowledge/use  
10.[ADDRESS_391855] : A study team member will use a 
REDCap instrument to collect insurance type from the medical record for 
each participant.  Additionally,  upon completion of enrollment,  we will 
collect  aggregate medical record  data (i.e., the number of participants for 
whom each order is used) using the Cerner study order set  (this is an 
order set designated for use for any POC resource for which a medical 
record order is required).  
Screening Log : The study team will maintain an adolescent screening log 
that includes patient age, sex, and reason for study exclusion.  Age and 
sex will be obtained from the Cerner ED tracking board.  No PHI will be 
included in the Screening Log. The Screening Log will enable the study 
team to determine the number of adolescents who are excluded and for 
what reason(s), the number who are potentially eligible for participation 
but the enrollment opportu nity is missed, etc.  
Refusal Log : The study team will maintain a refusal log to better 
understand potential differences between adolescents that participate 
and those that do not. Adolescents who decline to participate will be 
asked if they will provide information anonymously. If they a gree to do 
this, they will complete an anonymous survey that assesses age, sex, 
gender, race, ethnicity, primary language, and reason for not 
participating. This survey will be administered via REDCap/tablet 
computer. If the adolescent declines to complete the refusal survey, the 
study team member will complete items on age and sex (available on the 
ED-HEART Pi[INVESTIGATOR_318313] [ADDRESS_391856] used for screening purposes) and reason for study 
declination, if provided.  
 
11.0 Follow -up 
• Participants will complete a [ADDRESS_391857] information if 
needed. We will send up to 2 emails and/or 2 text reminder s for the 
6-week check in. If by [CONTACT_5875] 7 the participant has not completed the 
follow -up survey, a study team member will call them using the 
phone number(s) provided to remind them about the survey 
(maximum number of phone calls = 3). If needed at the time  of the 
call, the follow -up survey weblink  will be sent via email and/or text.  
• Option to notify participants of 6 -week check in and 12 -week follow 
up survey availability via social media  using a Children’s Mercy 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318314] (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.).  
• Participants will receive a reminder contact [CONTACT_318327], sent one week ahead of the 12 -week survey (at week 11) via 
the participant’s preferred method of contact  [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or social media 
handle using a Children’s Mercy Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318314].  
• Participants will complete the Follow -up Survey at 12 weeks 
(completion window 10 -14 weeks).  
• Participants will receive an email and/or text inviting them to 
complete the follow -up survey using a weblink provided. We will send 
up to 2 emails and/or 2 text reminders, as needed. If by [CONTACT_5875] 13 the 
participant has not completed the follow -up survey, a study team 
member will call them using the phone number(s) provided to remind 
them about the survey  (maximum number of phone calls = 3) . If 
needed at the time of the call, the follow -up survey weblink will be 
sent via email and/or text.  
• To aid in completion of the Follow -Up Survey s, the study team will 
check the medical record to see if participants have scheduled 
appointments at Children’s Mercy during the [ADDRESS_391858] an appointment, or are admitted to 
Children’s Mercy,  the study team will approach them at this time  to 
offer opportunity to complete the Follow -up Survey via tablet 
computer at this appointment.  
12.0 Genetic Analysis Information  
ED-HEART Pi[INVESTIGATOR_318313] 11 of 36 
 N/A  
 
13.0 Sharing of Results with Participant s 
We will not share results of research  procedures with participant s. 
Results derived from clinical care procedures (i.e., lab testing) will be 
shared with participant by [CONTACT_318328].  
 
14.0 Risks to Participant s* 
Breach of confidentiality: As with any study, there is potential for breach 
of confidentiality. Strict measures will be taken to ensure participant 
privacy and confidentiality. All data will be managed in accordance with 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318315]. Participants will 
provide assent/consent  and complete data collection privately to 
maintain confidentiality. Study personnel will not use study data and 
records for any purpose other than cond ucting the study. Only 
researchers involved in this study will have access to the collected data. 
All data will be de -identified then stored in the secure REDCap database, 
and all participants will be assigned a unique identification number. The  
contact [CONTACT_318329] [ADDRESS_391859] provision, 
personally identifiable information will be destroyed.  
Mandatory reporting: During the consent process, we will inform 
participants that we are unable to maintain confidentiality if they verbally 
disclose abuse that requires a mandated report by [CONTACT_318330]  a minor 
(i.e., < 18 years of age) adolescent participant.  
Emotional distress: Participants may experience distress triggered by [CONTACT_318331]. However, our prior experience with similar studies and 
available published evidence suggests this risk is minimal.43-45 We include 
information in the consent process that reminds participants that they 
are not required to answer questions that make them feel uncomfortable 
and may choose to terminate study participation at any time. CMH social 
workers and a community -based intimate partner violence advocate are 
available 24 hours daily for patients and families; participants will be 
informed of this availability during the informed consent process, as well 
as upon interview completion. Additionally, each participant will rec eive 
a list of teen community resources (e.g., local intimate partner violence 
ED-HEART Pi[INVESTIGATOR_318313] 12 of 36 
 agency, teen resource center, mental health resources, and agency 
advocating for sexual minority youth; national suicide hotline, ARA, and 
sexual exploitation resources), such that they may contact [CONTACT_318332].  
Study risks are not greater than minimal for all participants.  
 
15.0 Potential Benefits * 
 
Participants  may benefit directly from the teen resource list that will be 
provided to each participant. Participants in the intervention arm may 
benefit from receipt of the ED -HEART intervention. Information provided 
in the teen resource list and ED -HEART intervention may enable 
participants to better delineate healthy vs. unhealthy relationship 
behaviors,  to provide support for peers experiencing ARA, and to access 
CM and community resources for common issues, including ARA.  
Benefits to society/science  may include 1) improved care of adolescents 
treated receiving care in ED settings in the future, through ED -HEART 
implementation, and 2) better understanding of effective interventions 
to promote healthy adolescent relationships and mitigate harms of ARA.

26.0 Adverse Events and Unanticipated Problems * 
Monitoring:  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_318316] 
3-month follow -up period to identify and discuss adverse events and 
unanticipated problems . Study team members will promptly notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_318317].   
Reporting:  We will follow Policy 5.11 Reportable Events of the CM  Research 
Program Policies and Procedures  in regards to reporting adverse events and 
other unanticipated problems to the CM IRB .

 27.0 Data  Analysis  
We will generate a descriptive summary of feasibility using the Bowen model’s 
eight constructs (Table 2). 
Table 2:  Assessment of  Bowen  Feasibility Constructs  
Construct  Definition  Assessment measures  
Acceptability   To what extent is ED-
HEART  suitable?   Adolescent surveys, Health Educator 
field notes  
Demand   To what extent is ED -
HEART  likely to be used?   Proportion of  screened adolescents 
eligible; proportion of eligible 
adolescents enrolled; Health Educator 
field notes  
Implementation   To what extent can  ED-
HEART  be delivered as 
planned?   Fidelity  assessment  per 
adolescent  survey, Health Educator field 
notes, audio recordings of intervention 
delivery  
Practicality   What factors make  delivery 
challenging or facilitate 
delivery?   Health Educator field notes  
Adaptation   To what extent  does ED -
HEART perform in a new 
system?   Comparison with published outcomes in 
original setting33  
Integration   To what extent can ED -
HEART  be integrated within 
existing system?   Health Educator field notes  
Expansion   To what extent can the 
existing system be expanded 
to provide  ED-HEART?   Health Educator field notes  
Limited  efficacy    Are ED -HEART  outcomes 
promising?   Primary outcome: any ARA  at 3-month 
follow up33 , per adolescent survey  
 
Acceptability ratings will be collapsed to dichotomous variables. ED -
HEART will be deemed acceptable if the test of the proportion of 
very/fairly satisfactory ratings for adolescents, the health educator, and 
ED staff being <85% is not statistically signif icant. We will compare ED 
length of stay between the two arms, and calculate the mean/median 
number of interruptions per participant, with a list of reasons for 
interruption. For limited efficacy assessment, our primary outcome is any 
ARV as individual typ es of abuse rarely occur in isolation and HEART is 
designed to address ARV broadly. We will compare odds of reporting AR A 
at follow -up for the two arms by [CONTACT_6486] a logistic regression model with 
any ARV at follow -up (yes or no) as the dependent variable, baseline AR A 
ED-HEART Pi[INVESTIGATOR_318313] 21 of 36 
 (yes or no) as a covariate, and study arm as focal predictor. This approach 
should have higher statistical power than the Fisher’s Exact Test used in 
the power analysis, making our sample size somewhat conservative. We 
will analyze secondary outcomes (AR A perpetration, AR A victimization , 
recognition of abusive behaviors, knowledge of AR A resources, self -
efficacy to use harm reduction strategies, use of harm reduction 
strategies and resources) similarly. Factors potentially affecting 
intervention efficacy (e .g., sex, gender, race/ethnicity, recognition of 
behaviors as abusive, intention to engage in healthy relationship 
behaviors, adolescent change talk, MI fidelity [MI -consistent/ -
inconsistent behaviors], intervention intensity [number of intervention 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_318318]]) will be considered as additional model predictors.  We 
will summarize demographics and report baseline prevalence of any AR A 
and individual types of AR A. We will check for differences in 
demographics and baseline variables between the two arms, as well as 
for demographic differences between participants and refusals.  
2.3 A sample size of 69  per arm provides 80.4% power to detect a 
between -arm difference, assuming control and intervention arm TVD 
rates of 0.55 and 0.30, respectively, at 3 months  at follow -up (two -sided 
Fisher’s Exact Test at alpha=0.05). We set a final sample as n=174 
participants (n=87 each arm) to account for an estimated 20% loss to 
follow up, based on our previous work.   
28.0 Data and Specimen  Management * 
Data Management:   Data will include that obtained from the study surveys and 
medical record, as described above.  
Data will be collected via REDCap or paper survey or EHR review. Data 
from the surveys and EHR will be stored in REDCap. Paper surveys, if used  
in the event of a REDCap or other IT issue , will be stored in a locked office 
of the investigators.  
Deidentified data will be exported from REDCap to statistical programs 
for analysis (e.g., SAS, SPSS, Excel). All data will be securely stored on 
password -protected CM servers.  
Strict measures will be taken to ensure participant privacy and 
confidentiality. Participants will be assigned a unique study identification 
number. Additionally, s urvey data will be collected using a unique, 
participant -created code such that a link between participant survey 
number and participant identity do not need to be linked.[ADDRESS_391870] access to the data .  
Data will be stored per CM records retention policy.

STUDY MANAGEMENT  
31.0 Setting  & Locations  
Study processes will occur at Children’s Mercy, with participant recruitment and 
procedures occurring in the EDs. The treating ED team, an ED social worker, and 
ED-HEART Pi[INVESTIGATOR_318313] 23 of 36 
 an intimate partner violence advocate are available to participants 24 hours daily 
in the ED setting.   
 
32.0 Multi -Site Research  
 
All study procedures will occur at CM. However, some co -investigators 
are from non -CM institutions: Elizabeth Miller, MD, PhD (University of 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]), Ann Davis, PhD (University of Kansas Medical Center), Megha 
Ramaswamy, PhD (University of Kansas Medic al Center). These study 
members are categorized as not participating in human participants 
research as they will at no time interact with study participants or have 
access to identifiable data.

 Addendum A: Waiver of Documentation of Permission/Consent  
 
Regulatory Criteria: To qualify for a waiver of documentation of parental permission or 
adult consent, the study must fit into at least one of the three scenarios below. Indicate 
which scenario(s) applies.  
 
☐ The only record linking the participant  and the research would be the 
permission/consent form and the principal risk is potential harm resulting from a 
breach of confidentiality.  Each parent/LAR or adult participant  will be asked whether 
they want documentation linking the participant  with the research, and the 
parent/LAR’s or adult participant ’s wishes will govern.  
 
OR 
 
☒ The research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to participants  and 
involves no procedures for which written parental permission or adult consent is 
normally required outside of the research context.  
 
OR 
 
☐ The parent(s)/LAR or adult participants  are members of a distinct cultural group or 
community in which signing forms is not the norm , the research presents no more 
than minimal risk of harm to participant s and an appropriate alternative mechanism 
for documenting that informed parental/LAR permission or adult consent was 
obtained will be provided. Describe the alternative mechanism provided:  
ED-HEART Pi[INVESTIGATOR_318313] 25 of 36 
  Addendum B: Waiver/Alteration of Permission/Assent/Consent  
 
What’s the difference between a “waiver” and an “alteration” of parental permission, 
child assent, or adult consent?   
 
• A “waiver” of parental permission, child assent, or adult consent is when all 9 
required elements of permission/consent are waived.  If the IRB approves a 
waiver,  then the study team does not need to obtain the parental permission or 
adult consent in order to include a participant  in the study.  
 
• An “alteration” of parental permission, child assent, or adult consent is when 
one or more of the [ADDRESS_391871] still obtain parental permission or adult consent in order to include a 
participant  in the study, but certain elements may not be required in the 
form/discussion.  
 
 
Criteria  Explain how the study meets the criteria  
The research involves no more 
than minimal risk to the 
participant s Study participation entails no more than minimal risk  for 
participants . 
The research could not 
practicably be carried out 
without the requested 
waiver/alteration (i.e., explain 
why the study could not be 
done if  
permission/assent/consent 
were required)  Exclusion of adolescent presenting to the ED 
unaccompanied by a parent would result in sampling bias. 
Adolescents commonly present to the ED unaccompanied 
by a parent. Further, a common reason for adolescents to 
seek medical are without a parent is to addr ess 
reproductive and sexual health concerns; these adolescents 
are at increased risk for ARA and should not be excluded 
from this study.  
If the research involves using 
identifiable private 
information or identifiable 
biospecimens, the research 
could not practicably be 
carried out without using such 
information or biospecimens 
in an identifiable format  PHI is needed to enable data collection at the 12 -week 
follow up. PHI collected is limited to that needed for 12 -
week follow up . 
The waiver/alteration will not 
adversely affect the rights and 
welfare of the participant s Waiver of parental permission for adolescents presenting to 
the ED unaccompanied by a parent will not adversely affect 
the rights and welfare of participants as this study is 
minimal risk and all participants will provide assent.  
ED-HEART Pi[INVESTIGATOR_318313] 26 of 36 
 Whenever appropriate, the 
participant s or legally 
authorized representatives 
will be provided with 
additional pertinent 
information after participation  Whenever appropriate, the participant s or legally 
authorized representatives will be provided with additional 
pertinent information after participation . 
 
Proposed Alteration (if applicable):  
Select which required elements of permission are to be omitted . 
☐ A statement that the study involves research, an explanation of the purposes of 
the research and the expected duration of the participant 's participation, a 
description of the procedures to be followed, and identification of any 
procedures that are experimental;  
 
☐ A description of any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the 
participant ; 
 
☐ A description of any benefits to the participant  or to others that may reasonably 
be expected from the research;  
 
☐ A disclosure of appropriate alternative procedures or courses of treatment, if any, 
that might be advantageous to the participant ; 
 
☐ A statement describing the extent, if any, to which confidentiality of records 
identifying the participant  will be maintained;  
 
☐  For research involving more than minimal risk, an explanation as to whether any 
compensation and an explanation as to whether any medical treatments are 
available if injury occurs and, if so, what they consist of, or where further 
information may be obta ined;  
 
☐  An explanation of whom to contact [CONTACT_129025] s' rights, and whom to contact [CONTACT_44751] a 
research -related injury to the participant ; 
 
☐  A statement that participation is voluntary, refusal to participate will involve no 
penalty or loss of benefits to which the participant  is otherwise entitled, and the 
participant  may discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of 
benefits to which the participant  is otherwise entitled; and  
 
☐  One of the following statements about any research that involves the collection 
of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens:  
 
ED-HEART Pi[INVESTIGATOR_318313] 27 of 36 
 ☐  A statement that identifiers might be removed from the identifiable private 
information or identifiable biospecimens and that, after such removal, the 
information or biospecimens could be used for future research studies or 
distributed to another investi gator for future research studies without 
additional informed consent from the participant  or the legally authorized 
representative, if this might be a possibility; or  
 
☐  A statement that the participant 's information or biospecimens collected as 
part of the research, even if identifiers are removed, will not be used or 
distributed for future research studies.  
 
Provide the rationale for omitting the item(s) selected : N/A 
 
  
ED-HEART Pi[INVESTIGATOR_318313] 28 of 36 
 Addendum C: Non -English Speaking Participant s 
 
There are special considerations that must be made when obtaining 
permission/assent/consent from partic ipants  who prefer to communicate in a language 
other than English. To ensure that adequate processes are in place to obtain effective 
permission/assent/consent from these participants  address each of the items below.  
 
Indicate which language(s) other than English are understood by [CONTACT_318336].  
 
☒  Spanish  
☐  Arabic  
☐  Burmese  
☐  Somali  
☐  Vietnamese  
☐  Other:_______________________________________________  
 
 
Describe the plan  for enrolling non -English speaking participants  (e.g.,  fully translated 
consent forms, use of Qualified Bilingual Study Staff or interpreters):  
 
For enrollment of minor participants with Spanish -speaking parents who are present at 
the time of the ED visit, we will use:  
• Qualified bilingual study staff or an interpreter.  
• A Spanish version of the Study Information Sheet for Parents.  
 
If providing fully translated consent forms, explain if the ORI Translation Program for 
internally and/or federally funded studies  will be used , or if translation services will be 
obtained through the study sponsor or some other service.  
 
As this is a federally funded study, we will use the ORI Translation Program for 
documents requiring translation (i.e., Study Information Sheet for Parents).

ED-HEART Pi[INVESTIGATOR_318313] 31 of 36 
   
Addendum E: Waiver/Alteration of HIPAA Authorization  
 
 
What’s the difference between a “waiver” and an “alteration” of HIPAA 
Authorization?  
 
• A “waiver” of HIPAA Authorization is when the requirement to obtain 
authorization is completely waived.  If the IRB approves a waiver,  then the study 
team does not need to obtain HIPAA Authorization in order to include a 
participant  in the study.  
 
• An “alteration” of HIPAA Authorization is when one or more of the required 
elements of authorization are waived.   If the IRB approves an alteration,  then 
the study team must still obtain HIPAA Authorization in order to include a 
participant  in the study, but certain elements may not be required in the 
form/discussion.  
 
 
 
Criteria  Explain h ow the study meets the 
criteria  
The use or disclosure of PHI involves no 
more than minimal risk to the privacy of 
individuals based upon the following:   
a. Plan to protect PHI from 
improper use and disclosure:  
b. Plan to destroy PHI at the 
earliest opportunity, unless 
there is a health or research 
justification for retaining the 
PHI:  
c. Assurance that PHI will not be 
reused or disclosed to any 
other person or entity:  
 Partial Waiver of HIPAA 
Authorization and Alteration of 
HIPPA Authorization:  
a. Only researchers involved in 
this study will have access to PHI 
and will use it only for study 
purposes as described in this 
protocol. Recorded data will be 
stored in the secure REDCap 
database and all participants will 
be assigned a unique study 
identi fication number.  
b. All recorded PHI will be deleted 
upon study completion, such that 
only de -identified data is 
permanently stored as part of this 
study.  
c. PHI will not be reused or 
disclosed to anyone not involved 
in this research.  Good Clinical 
Practice guidelines will be 
ED-HEART Pi[INVESTIGATOR_318313] 32 of 36 
  
  followed in order to ensure that 
information will not be disclosed 
to unauthorized persons.  
The research cannot practicably 
be conducted without the 
waiver/alteration, i.e., explain 
why a signature [CONTACT_318341] . Partial Waiver of HIPAA 
Authorization for pre -
screening/recruitment:  Data will 
be accessed prior to recruitment 
of participants by [CONTACT_318337].  
PHI will not be recorded prior to 
obtaining informed 
permission/assent/consent.  
The research cannot practicably 
be conducted without access to 
and use of the PHI, i.e., explain 
why access to  PHI is needed for  
this study.  Partial Waiver of HIPPA 
Authorization:  Without access to 
PHI via the Cerner electronic 
tracking boards  for 
screening/recruitment, we will be 
unable to  practicably  identify 
which patients are potentially 
eligible for study participation.

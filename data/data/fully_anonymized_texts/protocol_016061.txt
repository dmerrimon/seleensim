Study Title : Creating a Sustainable Infrastructure for SARS -COV -2 Testing at Syringe Exchange Programs  
Protocol Number:  11162020.[ADDRESS_884775] drugs (PWIDs) are a socially vulnerable population and are exposed to risk factors
inc
luding unstable housing and underlying medical conditions such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
tuberculosis (TB), and viral hepatitis that put them at increased risk for severe COVID -[ADDRESS_884776] been an
underserved population in the context of the current pandemic; thus, little is known about the prevalence of
COVID -19 and the acceptability and possible reach of testing for COVID -19 among PWIDs. To address this
gap, this study leverages a current partnership with HIV Alliance (HIVA) in Oregon and our Community andScientific Advisory Board  to support implementation and sustainability of a COVID -19 testing program.
Specifically, we w ill use community -based participatory approaches to develop, implement, and evaluate a
COVID -19 testing program offered through HIVA’s Syringe Services Programs (SSP), a natural point of care
for PWIDs. Moreover, SSPs may offer a natural venue for dissemination and delivery of a vaccine, once
available. The COVID -[ADDRESS_884777] the disease.

ecific Aims/Study Objectives
We will accomplish our goals to increase testing capacity and utilization of testing resources for PWIDs by[CONTACT_656759]:
Aim 1 : Use a community -based participatory approach to collaborate with HIVA to build their capacity to
implement a sustainable COVID -19 testing program that will include procedures for sample collection,
transmis sion of specimens to the University of Oregon CLIA -certified laboratory, and results reporting, and
assess testing utilization to understand the reach of the program.
Aim 2 : Develop a brief one -s
 ession intervention (i.e., Connect2Test ) that incorporates ecological assessment
and motivational interviewing and that can be implemented during syringe exchange services. We will use a
randomized control trial design to evaluate whether the Connect2Test  intervention increases the likelihood of
COVID -[ADDRESS_884778] whether social
determinants of health (SDOH)  linked to COVID -19 moderate intervention effects.
Aim 3 : Assess implementation outcomes associated with COVID -[ADDRESS_884779] for scale- up. 
We are also testing the following aims as a result of obtaining Phase II funding  which mirror the aims fr om 
Phase I (listed above) but adds an evaluation of vaccination uptake and tests the combination of contingency management (CM) : 
Aim 1: Collaborate with HIVA to sustain the SARS -CoV-2 testing program established at SEPs during Phase 
I and develop infrastructure and processes to implement a COVID -19 vaccine program at SEPs, and assess  
if testing program reach is sustained from Phase I to Phase II and assess the vaccination program’s reach.  
Aim 2:  Use a community -based participatory research approach to adapt the Connect2Test intervention 
developed in Phase I and conduct an evaluation of the adapted intervention.  
2a: Adapt Connect2Test to 1) address the continued necessity of SARS -CoV-2 testing in the context of 
vaccine accessibility and vaccine hesitancy, 2) enhance vaccine uptake, and 3 ) enhance acceptability, 
appropriateness, and feasibility of the intervention based on lessons learned during Phase I.  
2b: Conduct a 2- arm randomized control trial to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of CM alone (arm 
1)
v
ersus CM plus the adapted Connect2Test intervention (arm 2) on SARS- CoV-2 testing and COVID -19
vaccination uptake.
Aim 3: Evaluate the implementation of CM and Connect2Test including: 1)  an assessment of  reach, 
acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity, penetration,  and sustainability , and 2) a cost -effectiveness  
analysis of CM versus CM + Connect2Test.  
C
.Methods, Materials and Analysis
Overall Study Design : This study involves development and implementation of a COVID -19 testing and
vaccination program embedded in HIV Alliance’s (HIVA) Syringe Service Programs (SSP) at 10 sites across
Oregon (Aim 1) . We will evaluate testing and vaccination utilizatio n rates as our outcome for Aim 1. Across all
sites, for Aim 1, we to administer approximately 150 tests per week  for a total of 15,600 tests over the study
period. We will also administer a total of 1,200 vaccines during the study period. Some of these ind ividuals
will be repeat testers  and vaccinators . For Aim 1, we will compute the ratio of total persons tested a nd
v
accinated /total persons attending syringe exchange who were offered testing or vaccination to asse ss
t
esting and vaccination program reach. We will use data collected during testing and vaccination intake,
“Testing Intake Form”, processed by [CONTACT_29452]’s data scientist which includes name, date of birth, a nd
c
ontact information. We will collect test results from  the UO COVI9 -[ADDRESS_884780] the opportunity to take a follow -up survey, “Aim [ADDRESS_884781] -Testi ng
S
urvey”.  A t the time of testing or vaccination, the HIVA testing facilitator  will invite clients to complete th e
t
esting intake and obtain informed consent and authorization for sharing protected health information.
Consent, information sharing authorization, and the testing intake and consent will be completedelectronically. The  “Aim [ADDRESS_884782] -Testing Survey” will be collected either electronically either on Qualtrics or
through a secure data collection tool provided by [CONTACT_656760]. Research assistants will
administer the “Aim [ADDRESS_884783] -Testing Survey”.
Aim 1, St ep 1 (Testing  or
  vaccination Facilitator, Consent and HIPAA Authorization):  Participate in testing 
or vaccination and receive $10 to get tested or vaccinated and share testing information.  
Aim 1, Step 2 (Research Assistant, no additional consent):  Pa rticip ate in “Aim [ADDRESS_884784] -Testing Survey” and 
get $20 for completing the 20- min survey.  
D
ata from steps 1 and 2 will be shared with the RADx -UP CDCC as required by [CONTACT_656761]. The 
information that will be shared is summarized in the consent form.   
For Aim 2 , we will use a brief motivational enhancement intervention ( Connect2Test ) to increase testing and 
vaccination program utilization  and use a randomized control trial  (RCT) design to evaluate if this intervention 
increases COVID -[ADDRESS_884785] survey and interview data on implementation experiences from HIVA staff and 
volunteers.  
T
he research will occur at HIVA SSP sites across the state of Oregon. HIVA will be responsible for 
coordinating training activities for HIVA staff a nd UO will be responsible for training HIVA staff on-site and 
virtually. HIVA will meet with the UO implementation team (Cioffi, Mauricio, Tavalire) at least monthly (but more frequently to start).  
      Research Procedures : 
Phase I Testing Program: Aim 1. At the time of testing, the HIVA testing facilitator will invite clients to share 
their intake data with the study team and obtain signed informed consent. The testing intake data will be 
collected by [CONTACT_656762]. Consents will  be available on site for clients to read and copi[INVESTIGATOR_656753]. Signatures will be collected electronically.   
A
fter testing (either the same day or at a future date), a research assistant will have a list of people who have 
been previously tested and provided consent for the Testing Follow -up Survey. Only these individuals will be 
able to participate. They may also participate if they were tested the same day the research assistant was on site. They will provide either an electronic data collection tool or paper and pencil surveys to be read by [CONTACT_656763]. If clients cannot read, the survey may be read to them by a member of the research team. If the 
survey is read aloud, it will be done in a space away from other clients to maintain privacy.  
P
hase II: Aim 1.  In Phase I, we demonstrated close collaboration with HIVA to establish a SARS -CoV-2 
testing program as mentioned in Phase I, Testing Program: Aim 1. This program and research are on- going 
and will remain unchanged. In addition to testing, given the ever -changing nature of the pandemic and need 
to offer COVID -[ADDRESS_884786] Evaluation: Aim 2 : We will use community -based participatory approaches to 
develop a brief one- session intervention that will include an ecological assessment, feedback,  and 
motivational interviewing, called Connect2test. While Connect2Test draws from principles used in the Family 
Check -Up, such as ecological assessment, feedback, and motivational interviewing, the Connect2test 
intervention is unique from the Family Check -Up. We will use a randomized control trial (RCT) design to 
evaluate if Connect2test in creases COVID -[ADDRESS_884787]  by a 
research staff . Clients that agree to participate will complete signed informed consent programmed in 
Qualtrics and consented participants will be randomized to the intervention or control condition by  [CONTACT_38385].  
All participants will complete a study questionnaire (in Qualtrics) that includes both the Connect2Test Assessment questions and Common Data Elements questions. For clients randomized to the intervention, the 
Connect2Test Assessment questions will be used to guide the Connect2Test motivational interviewing 
intervention component. The consent and all surveys/assessments will be administered via an iPad. 
Recruitment script and consent  are included with protocol.  In most cases, clients will self -administer the 
survey ; however,  if they cannot read, the survey may be read to them. If the survey is read aloud, it will be 
done in a space away from other clients to maintain privacy.  In total , surveys/assessment should take 
approximately [ADDRESS_884788] fidelity on a randomly selected 20% of testing days. The clinician 
offering the intervention will also self -report on fidelity. We will use testing utilization (yes/no) as our outcome 
to evaluate intervention effects. Data from the CDE survey and the HIVA intake form will be leveraged to 
evaluate moderators of  intervention effects.   
A
ny client can receive COVID -19 testing, regardless of their participation in the research. 
C
lients using HIVA’s syringe exchange services provide their unique HIVA ID. This unique identifier is used to 
link data for persons who are repeat users of HIVA’s services.  We will use the unique ID to link HIVA intake, 
CDE data, and UO’s CLIA laboratory data (i.e., testing utilization) for the purpose of evaluating effects of  
Connect2Test  on testing utilization and the moderating effects of SDOHs  (assessed using the CDEs  and 
HIVA intake data).  
A
t the time of consent , a research team member  will ask clients to complete a HIPAA Authorization form 
(which will be programmed in Qualtrics with the consent and survey) for the purpose of releasing their testing 
utilization data to the UO research team. UO’s COVID -[ADDRESS_884789], clients will only be invited to participate in the study once. Participation in the 
study will be tracked by [CONTACT_3647]. Regardless of whether clients consent to participate in the study, they will be offered an opportunity to get tested every time they visit the exchange.  
Data Analysis: We will use a randomized control trial to evaluate wh ether Connect2Tes t increases COVI D-[ADDRESS_884790] whether SDOH  moderate intervention effects.  We will use chi -square tests 
to examine whether the expected rates of testing utilization vary by [CONTACT_3004]. We will use logistic regression to examine whether SDOHs  moderate intervention effects.  
P
hase II, Aim 2: For Aim 2, we will adapt the ME Connect2Test intervention that we developed during Phase 
I and examine whether the adapted Connect2Test augments the effects of Contingency M anagement  on 
SARS- CoV-[ADDRESS_884791] training, staff and 
volunteers will provide input on talking points in line with motivational interviewing principles. The second part 
will be training on the specificized intervention after incorporating staff and volunteer feedback. It will also include training on research protocols for randomization (e.g., research assistants will invite participation, consent participants, and identify participants to receive the intervention then syringe exchange staff will deliver the intervention to clients who are randomized to intervention). Staff and volunteers will receive $75 for 
participation in each part of the co- design process ($150 total). We will assess pre -post gains in knowledge 
and self -efficacy (See MI pre- post survey ). Each survey will take approximately 5 minutes to complete.  
I
ntervention testing. For Aim 2 , we will use a randomized control trial (RCT) design to evaluate if this 
intervention in conjunction with contingency management  increases COVID -19 testing and vaccination 
utilization, in comparison to  contingency management (CM) alone. Aim [ADDRESS_884792] by [CONTACT_656764]. Clients that agree to participate will complete 
signed informed consent programmed in Qualtrics; consented participants will complete a brief survey ( Aim 2 
Brief Client Survey) and be randomized by  [CONTACT_656765]2Test + CM condition or to CM alone. At  
the time of consent , research staff will ask clients to complete a HIPAA Authorization form for the purpose of 
sharing their testing and vaccination utilization data as well as test result with the UO research team.  The 
HIPAA Authorization form will also be programmed in Qualtrics. Research staff will discretely inform syringe 
exchange staff/volunteers whether the client has been assigned to Connect2Test + CM so the staff/volunteer will know whether to deliver the intervention. Clients in the CM only condition will be invited to participate in 
testing and vaccination after completing syringe exchange. Clients in the Connect2Test + CM condition will receive the brief intervention, which involves an approximately 5- minute conversation guided by [CONTACT_656766] 5 of 14 interviewing processes, and then be invited to participate in testing and vaccination. The syringe exchange 
staff/volunteer delivering the intervention as well as the research staff assisting with Aim [ADDRESS_884793] to document intervention delivery.   
W
e will use data collected during testing  and vaccination intake, “Testing Intake Form”, processed by [CONTACT_656767]’s data scientist which includes name, date of birth, and contact [CONTACT_3031]. We will collect test 
results from the UO COVI9- [ADDRESS_884794] results . 
A
ll individuals who participate in Aim 2 will be invited to complete an additional longer survey (i.e., “ Post-
Testing Survey” ; 20 minutes) that includes common data element (CDE) questions. This survey will be 
completed during a future visit to syringe exchange or via e- mail,  phone, text, or Facebook.   
The target sample size for the RCT in Aim [ADDRESS_884795] will be initiated once IRB 
approval is received and we anticipate it will take approximately 3-4 months to reach the target sample size. 
Aim 2 data will be shared with the RADx -UP CDCC as required by [CONTACT_656761]. The information that will be 
shared is summarized in the consent form.  We plan to enroll 350 participants.  
Data Analysis: We will use a randomized control trial to evaluate whether Connect2Tes t + Contingency 
Management  increases COVID -[ADDRESS_884796] whether SDOH  and key motivational variables (collected via Aim 2 Brief Client Survey ) moderate 
interventi on effects.  We will use chi -square tests to examine whether the expected rates of testing utilization 
vary by [CONTACT_3004]. We will use logistic regression to examine whether SDOHs moderate intervention effects.  
P
hase I, Assess implementation experiences from HIVA staff and volunteers: Aim 3 . HIVA staff and 
volunteers will be invited to participate and complete consent via email. Staff/volunteers who consent to 
participate will be invited to complete a survey. In the consenting process, participants will provide their name [CONTACT_120254]. Participants will also provide an e- mail so we can send them a $[ADDRESS_884797] anonymity of responses. Audio recordings will be transcribed for coding. Participants’ names will be used to link their survey and their audio transcript so we can know participants to whom we should send a gift 
card for their participation. After this, a unique ID will be assigned to participants’ survey data and audio 
transcr ipt to link these and then identifiers (name [CONTACT_320945]) will be permanently deleted. The audio 
transcription of the interview will be stored on a secure server, prior to being transcribed, and will be destroyed immediately following transcription. All staf f and volunteer data will be presented in aggregate so 
that responses can never be linked to a particular staff or volunteer.  
Phase II, Aim 3:  Similar to Phase I, Aim 3, we will conduct interviews and surveys with HIV Alliance staff. 
However, we will expand Aim 3 in Phase II to also interview clients , observe interventionists,  and review 
administrative data from HIV Alliance. We plan to develop these materials and will submit an amendment 
prior to implementation.

the Aim [ADDRESS_884799] from any needle exchange workers or clients to maintain the privacy of the participant. Afte r 
obtaining informed consent, the research assistant will begin interviewing the participant. The 
interviews will take 20 – [ADDRESS_884800] the anonymity of responses. The research assistant will, however, obtain an HIV Alliance ID 
that is a unique ID used by [CONTACT_656769] a participant’s acquisition of syringe exchange 
services. This information must be obtained to link the participant’s COVID- 19 surv ey responses to 
their interview responses. However, all identifying information will be removed from the data as soon as possible and all data will be de- identified. The interview data will be stored on the 
Prevention Science Institute server, accessed by [CONTACT_2374]’s VPN. All data will be aggregated 
prior to presentation to ensure individual responses cannot be traced back to any participant.  
A
fter the interview process has concluded, interviews will be transcribed, and responses will be 
coded in NVIV O.  
G
iven the nature of this study and the increased risk of severe COVID- 19 symptoms among 
PWIDs, both the participant and the research assistant will be masked for the entirety of the 
Pa
ge 7 of 14 recruitment, informed consent, and interview processes. All surfaces will be sanitized with 
disinfectant wipes at the end of every interview. 
A

number of client interviews will not exceed 60.  
D.Research Population & Recruitment Methods
Study Population: The study population will be people who inject drugs (PWID) and use HIVA’s SSP services
in Oregon. We anticipate the sample characteristics to be comparable to demographics for individuals w ho
t
ypi[INVESTIGATOR_656754]. Specifically, we expect 6% Hispanic and 94% non- Hispanic, with
85% of individuals identifying as White in both ethnic groups and the remaining 15% identifying as Africa n
A
merican, Asi an, Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native, or more than one race. Only individuals [ADDRESS_884801]  and vaccinate;  only participants who speak English will be eligible for the RCT (Aim 2) , as
Connect2Test materials will only be available in English. For Phase II, We anticipate approximately 3800
unique participants will be included in Aim 1 and approximately 350 unique participants will be included in Ai m
2.A
ll HIVA SSP clients (up  to testing capacity, i.e., 150 per week) will have access to and be invited to test.
We expect an excess of male participants (i.e., 60%), based on the demographics of persons who us e
s
yringe exchange services. Across all sites, we expect to offer testing to [ADDRESS_884802] survey.
Recruitment Procedures : 
F
or Phase I  & II, Aim 1,  data from all syringe exchange service participants across 10 HIVA syringe 
exchange sites will be included in this study. HIVA SSP clients will also be invited to complete a “Common Data Elements” survey for the funder, National Institutes of Health. At the time of testing  or vaccination, the 
HIVA testing facilitator will invite clients to complete the survey and obtain signed informed consent. The Data 
Manager will create a running list with client names and date of birth of individuals who have consented to participate in the follow -up survey. Clients who wish to participate will either provide their name [CONTACT_656776], or the client will consent as part of the testing process the same day and the testing team will verbally let the research assistant on site know that the client has signed consent to participate. Clients who share their intake information will receive a $[ADDRESS_884803] 
for their participation. Clients who complete the follow -up survey will receive a $[ADDRESS_884804] for their  
participation.  
F
or Phase I  & 2, Aim 2  syringe exchange clients,  a research staff person will invite syringe exchange 
service p articipants  to participate in the study when they visit the exchange for services (see Recruitment 
script) . The research staff will inform clients about the opportunity to participate in the research study  and 
obtain signed informed consent. At  the time of consent , research staff will ask clients to complete a HIPAA 
Authorization form for the purpose of releasing their testing and vaccination intake data and test  result  to the 
UO research team. The HIPAA form will also be programmed in Qualtrics . UO’s COVID- [ADDRESS_884805] in 
Aim 2 will be conducted any HIV Alliance syringe exchange site. Clients will receive a $[ADDRESS_884806] for their 
participation  in the study  to be given after completing the Brief Client Survey . All individuals who participate in 
Aim 2 will be invited to complete an additional longer survey (i.e., 20 minutes) that includes common data 
element (CDE) questions and “Aim 2 Brief Client Survey” at a future date approximately [ADDRESS_884807] participants if they are unable to make their scheduled appointment and will provide 
reminder messages. Participants will receive a $[ADDRESS_884808] survey will be optional and part of the research. Staff and volunteers will receive 
$75 for participating in each day of training (3- hours each, 6 hours total) for a total of $150. They will be 
receive compensation regardless of their participation in the survey.  
F
or Phase I  & II, Aim [ADDRESS_884809] survey and interview data on implementation experiences from 
HIVA staff and volunteers. We anticipate staff and volunteers to be 13% Hispanic and 87% non-Hispanic, with 
87% of individuals identifying as White in both ethnic groups and the remaining 13% identifying as African 
American, Asian, Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native, or more than one race. We anticipate 75% of staff and volunteers  to be female.  We anticipate up to [ADDRESS_884810] names for 
consenting purposes and email address es for sending $[ADDRESS_884811] a time to schedule a 30- 45 minute zoom or phone interview. Staff 
and volunteers will receive a $[ADDRESS_884812]  for their participation in the survey and interview each time they 
participate.   
I
nformation on additional Aim 3 procedures for Phase II will be submitted in a future amendment.  
T
esting and Vaccine Hesitancy Client Interviews: The recruitment process for this research will be verbal. 
The primary sampling procedure will be convenience sampling with participants in HIV Alliance’s COVID -[ADDRESS_884813] not received any COVID -19 vaccinations will be 
selected for interviews. The research assistant will use the attached “Client Interviews recruitment script” to inform participants about the background, goals, and procedures of the project. If the individual is interested in 
being interviewed, they will be invited to read the informed consent form provided to them and will then the 
researcher will obtain informed consent. If the individual suggests that they are not available to be interviewed at the time in question but are interested in being interviewed at a later date, they  will be invited to contact [CONTACT_656770]. The research assistant will then schedule a time to interview them at one of the six approved syringe exchange locations during syringe exchange hours. 
Individuals that participate in this study will received a $[ADDRESS_884814] as compensation for their time.  The 
number of client interview s will not exceed 6 0. 
E.Informed Consent Process
Phase I & II, Aim 1. To assess the Aim 1 outcome, proportion of HIVA syringe exchange clients being testedor vaccinated, no individual level data is being collected by [CONTACT_5051]. We will compute proportions
based on aggregate weekly syringe exchange and testing data.   At the time of testing, the HIVA testi ng
f
acilitator will invite clients to share their testing data and obtain signed informed consent  for sharing testing
data and the follow -up survey . Consents will be read by [CONTACT_656771] e
su
rvey will  be read to the client  as part of testing intake . The testing research staff will also clarify that th e
i
nformation that the participant includes in the follow -up CDE survey will be used by [CONTACT_656772] (NIH) and Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI ), however identifying information will not be shared .
T
o ensure only clients who have consented to participate take the follow -up survey, the data manager will
create a list with name [CONTACT_656777] n a
par
ticipant comes to take the follow -up survey after the participant provides their name [CONTACT_18131]. For
clients who wish to participate on the same day after they complete testing, the testing team will verbally let
the research team know that the client has signed their consent (the research surveys will be conducte d
phy
sically adjacent to the testing tent). Clients will be reminded that they previously consented to participating
Pa
ge 9 of 14 in a research study  when they were t ested and remind them that participation in the follow up survey is 
voluntary .  
Phase I & II, Aim 2: Clients attending the syringe exchange will be invited to participate in the RCT  by a
r
esearch staff. Clients who agree to participate will provide signed informed consent  via Qualtrics, and 
participants that consent will be randomized to the intervention or control condition via Qualtrics . At the time of 
consent, the research staff will review the consent with the participant before they sign it to ensure that the 
participant is clear about data will be obtained by [CONTACT_656773].  Specifically, the UO will collect ident ifying information like including name [CONTACT_656778] [CONTACT_3031]. The research staff will clarify that the information that the participant shared with the UO research team will be used by [CONTACT_552845] (NIH) and Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI), however identifying information will not be shared with NIH or Duke. At the time of consent , the research team member  will ask clients to complete 
and a HIPAA Authorization form (also in Qualtrics) for the purpose of releasing their testing and vaccination 
intake data and test results to the UO research team. Clients will be given a blank paper copy consent and 
HIPAA form . For follow -up surveys, c lients will be reminded that they previously consented to participating in 
a research study when they were tested and remind them that participation in the follow up survey is voluntary.  
S
taff and volunteer co -creation.   For pre-post training  survey s consent forms for HIVA staff and volunteers 
will be provided on Qualtrics. The informed consent will explain the project, their rights, and how the data will be used in the future. Staff and volunteers will be assured that their participation in the study  is voluntary and 
that if they choose to participate, they can change their minds at any time. They will be informed about potential benefits and harm. Staff and volunteers will be informed that their data will only be presented in aggregate. Staff and volunteers will provide signed informed consent before participating. Participants will be able to download from Qualtrics and save a copy of the consent for their records.  It will be clear that they will 
receive compensation for attending training, regardless of their participation in the survey.  
Phase I & II, Aim 3:  Survey and interview data from HIVA staff and volunteers. For survey and 
qualitative interview data on implementation experiences from HIVA staff and volunteers,  consent forms for 
HIVA staff a nd volunteers will be provided on Qualtrics. The informed consent will explain the project, their 
rights, and how the data will be used in the future. Staff and volunteers will be assured that their participation in the study is voluntary and that if they choose to participate, they can change their minds at any time. They will be informed about potential benefits and harm. Staff and volunteers will be informed that their data will only be presented in aggregate. Staff and volunteers will provide signed informed consent before 
participating. Participants will be able to download from Qualtrics and save a copy of the consent for their 
records. In addition to asking for consenting purposes , we will ask for an email address for sending them a 
$[ADDRESS_884815] and linking audio and survey data, a unique ID will be assigned to survey data and audio transcript and then identifiers (name [CONTACT_320945]) will be permanently deleted.  
E
mails with the consent and survey will be sent to staff and volunteer by [CONTACT_656774]. If staff and volunteers choose 
to participate, after reviewing and signing informed consent, they  will be able to proceed to the survey; after 
completing the survey they will have the opportunity to schedule a time for a qualitative interview. In the consenting process, participants will provide their name [CONTACT_120254]. However, names will be replace d with 
a unique participant ID and consent information will be stored separately from the data. Qualitative interview 
data will be audio- recorded but names will not be used in the interview to protect anonymity of responses. 
Audio recordings will be transcribed for coding. Participants’ names will be used to link their survey and their 
audio transcript so we can know participants to whom we should send a gift card for their participation. After 
this, a unique ID will be assigned to participants’ survey data and audio transcript to link these and then 
identifiers (name [CONTACT_320945]) will be permanently deleted. The audio transcription of the interview will be stored 
on a secure server, prior to being transcribed, and will be destroyed immediately following trans cription. All 
staff and volunteer data will be presented in aggregate so that responses can never be linked to a particular 
staff or volunteer.  
A
dditional consent procedures will be added in a subsequent amendment for new research activities.  
Pa
ge 10 of 14 Testing and Vaccine Hesitancy Client Interviews: The research assistant will provide a printed 
copy of the “client interviews informed consent document” for the individual to read. The research 
assistant will request that the individual does not sign the consent form until they have had a 
conversation with the research assistant regarding the form’s contents. After the individual has 
finished reading the document, the research assistant will go over every element with them and will 
administer several comprehension checks to ensure there is a mutual understanding of what will be asked of them during the interview. During the process of obtaining informed consent, the research 
assistant will also ensure that the participant understands that their interview responses may  also 
be shared with HIV Alliance and a research team at the Prevention Science Institute. Specific attention will be drawn to the fact that their participation in the study will have no bearing on their 
ability to access HIV Alliance resources. Once the research assistant feels confident that the participant understands the entirety of the document, they will ask them to sign the final page and 
the interview will proceed. The research assistant will remind them that they are welcome to ask 
questions at any  point during the interview process or after the interview has completed.

G.Potential Research Risks or Discomforts to Participants
Potential Risks : Potential risks and discomforts involved in participation include (1) possible violation of
confidentiality. This risk are unlikely but possible.
Pa
ge 12 of 14 Minimizing Potential Risk 1 : Possible violation of confidentiality.  All records obtained from participants will be 
kept strictly confidential. To ensure strict confidentiality, any additional data will be coded with HIVA ID.  
T
he protocol involves intervention. The intervention includes a n intervention that aims to increase testing and 
vaccination utilization. This will involve a brief assessment and conversation with syringe exchange staff or 
volunteers.  This research does not pose any additional risk over the services provided as usual . 
The funding agency required a Data Safety Monitoring Plan for this research at the time of funding proposal. 
A copy of the DSMP submitted to the funder is attached.  
There is no established Data and Safety Monitoring Board/Committee (DSMB/C) as noted in the DSMP.  
H.Potential Benefits of the Research
T
he overall risk involved in the project is relatively minor, given the goals of the research. Participants woul d
f
ace similar levels of risk - or higher - visiting a clinic or other outdoor testing or vaccination event i n order t o
be t
ested or vaccinated for COVID -19. Participants will benefit by [CONTACT_26777] a free SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_884823]- to-engage, underserved population at high risk for
SARS- CoV-2 transmission and severe illness, if infected. Additionally, through this work, we plan to offer
testing and vaccination to 3800 persons in year one, after which HIVA will continue to administer testing and
vaccination, adding to the total testing, vaccination,  and surveillance efforts in the [LOCATION_002] and our
understanding of the disproportionate spread within - and burden felt by - these historically underserv ed
c
ommunities.

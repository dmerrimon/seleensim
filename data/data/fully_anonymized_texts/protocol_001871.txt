FER-TH-007 Amendment 4   October 1, 2012  7 1.0 Background  
 
1.1 Disease Background  
 
Lung cancer is the number one cause of death from cancer in both men and women. In particular 
the elderly (age > 65) comprise more than 45% of newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC, but are 
inadequ ately represented in the therapeutic literature – rarely more than 20% of the populations 
studied.  Based on the retrospective analysis of two large trials (SWOG 9509, SWOG 9308)1,2, 
elderly lung cancer patients tend to have more co -morbidities, increased toxicity to cytotoxic 
chemotherapy, and trend towards worsened overall survival.  It has been reported in the ELVIS 
trial3 that the fit elderly (Performance Status 0 -1) appear to benefit from systemic therapy 
(compared to best supportive care) with respect to quality of life (QOL) and overall survival, but 
many older patients decline systemic chemotherapy because of the perceiv ed increased toxicity.  
Less toxic and more effective alternatives are obviously needed in elderly patients with advanced 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  
 
In the literature, there is no definite evidence of superiority for one systemic therapy over 
another.  But the introduction of new targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_632221]. 
This study, first of its kind, explores the response rate of combinati on treatment with 
bevacizumab and erlotinib in treatment -naïve elderly patients with advanced NSCLC – an 
important cohort that need less toxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
1.2 Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and Anti -angiogenic Therapy  
 
Folkman and others have provid ed compelling evidence linking tumor growth and metastases 
with angiogenesis4.  Of the identified angiogenic factors, VEGF is the most potent and specific 
and has been identified as a crucial regulator of both normal and pathologic angiogenesis5.  
VEGF produces a number of biologic effects, including endothelial cell mitogenesis and 
migration, induction of proteinases, leading to remodeling of the extracellular matrix, increased 
vascular permeability, and maintenance of survival for newly formed blood vessels5.  The 
biologic effects of VEGF are mediated through binding and stimulation of two receptors on th e 
surface of endothelial cells:  Flt -1 (fms -like tyrosine kinase) and KDR (kinase domain region)5,6. 
 
Increased expression of VEGF has been measured in most human tumors examined to date, 
including tumors of the lung, breast, thyroid, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, bladder, ovary, and 
cervix, as well as angiosarcomas and glioblastomas5.  Inhibition of VEGF by [CONTACT_632253]-VEGF monoclonal antibody blocks the growth of a number of human cancer cell lines in 
nude mice5.  In addition, the combination of anti -VEGF antibody and chemotherapy in nude 
mice injected with human cancer xenografts results in an increased antitumor effect compared 
with antibody or chemotherapy treatment alone7.    
 
To test the hypothesis that inhibition of V EGF in patients with cancer results in clinical benefit, a 
recombinant humanized version of a murine anti –human VEGF monoclonal antibody, named 
Avastin (bevacizumab; previously known as rhuMAb VEGF), was created8.  Based on results of 
non-clinical efficacy and toxicology studies, bevacizumab was adv anced into clinical

FER-TH-007 Amendment 4   October 1, 2012  8 development by [CONTACT_8229], Inc. for use as a single agent and combined with chemotherapy to 
induce tumor shrinkage in patients with solid tumors.  
 
1.3 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_632222] a complex network of signaling pathways responsive 
to external influences, such as growth factors, as well as to internal controls and checks.  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_13403] f actor (EGF) was one of the first growth factors to be described.  It was shown 
to be mitogenic, an effect mediated by [CONTACT_632254] a cell surface EGF receptor 
(EGFR) , stimulating autophosphorylation of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of t he 
receptor .  Subsequent investigations revealed EGFR to be one of a family of closely related 
receptors that includes EGFR (HER1), HER2, HER3, and HER4.   
 
EGFR and other HER  family members are considered to be important in the development, 
progression, a nd aggressive behavior of human epi[INVESTIGATOR_632223] s.   A number of human malignancies are associated with aberrant or 
over-expression of EGFR38.  Stimulation of tumor cells via the EGFR is important for both 
tumor  growth and tumor survival in vivo.  Over -expression of EGFR in certain human tumors, 
including NSCLC, has been correlated with both chemo -resistance and poor prognosis9-15. 
Inhibitors of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity (EGFR TKIs) have been in development for a 
number of years, and although earlier compounds lacked specificity and potency, newer 
compounds have proven active in non -clinical and clinical studies16,17. 
 
Tarceva (erlotinib hydrochloride ; previously known as OSI -774) is an orally active, potent, 
selective inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase.  Early clinical data with erlotinib indicate that 
the compound is generally safe and well tolerated at doses that provide the targeted effective 
concentration based on non -clinical experiments.  A recently compl eted, randomized, double -
blind, placebo -controlled trial has shown that erlotinib as a single agent significantly improves 
the survival of patients with incurable Stage IIIb/IV NSCLC who have failed standard therapy 
for advanced or metastatic disease18.  
 
1.4 Bevacizumab:   Background and Clinical Experience   
 
Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth fac tor (VEGF).  
Bevacizumab has been studied in a multitude of Phase I, II, and III clinical trials in more than 
5000 patients and in multiple tumor types. In addition, data are available from 3,863 patients 
enrolled in two postmarketing studies in metastatic  colorectal cancer (CRC).  Approximately 
130,[ADDRESS_844114] or in clinical trials. 
The following discussion summarizes bevacizumab’s safety profile and presents some of the 
efficacy results pertinent to this particular trial. Please refer to the bevacizumab Investigator 
Brochure for descriptions of all completed Phase I, II, and III trials reported to date.  
 
These clinical trials have included patients with a number of tumor types, including colorectal, 
breast, lung, and renal carcinoma.19-22. 
 
In a large phase III study (AVF2107g) in patients with  metastatic colorectal cancer, the addition 
 
Copyright© 2012 Fox Chase Cancer Center ® Extramural Resea rch Program.  All rights reserved.  
FER-TH-[ADDRESS_844115] VEGF, to irinotecan/5 -
fluorouracil/leucovorin (IFL) chemotherapy resulted in a clinically and statistically significant 
increase in duration of survival, wit h a hazard ratio of death of 0. 67 (median survival 15.6 vs. 
20.3 months; p  < 0.0001).  Similar increases were seen in progression -free survival (6.2 vs. 10.6 
months; p  < 0.0001), overall response rate (35% vs. 45%; p  < 0.01), and duration of response 
(7.1 vs. 10.4 months; p  < 0.01) for the combination arm versus the chemotherapy only arm19.   
 
Based on the survival advantage demonstrated in Study AVF2107g, bevacizumab wa s 
designated for priority review and was approved on [ADDRESS_844116]-line treatment in combination with IV 5 -FU
based chemotherapy for subjects with 
metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC).  
 
Additional data from Phase III trials  in metastatic CRC (E3200), non
 small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC; E4599), and metastatic breast cancer (E2100) have also demonstrated clinical benefit 
from bevacizumab when added to chemotherapy.  In Study E3200, the addition of bevacizumab 
to FOLFOX chemothe rapy resulted in improved overall survival compared with FOLFOX alone 
(13.0 vs. 10.8  months, respectively, HR  
 0.75; p  
 0.01) in a population of previously treated 
CRC patients.   
 
There was also improved overall survival in first -line NSCLC patients (E4 599) treated with 
carboplatin/paclitaxel  
 bevacizumab compared with chemotherapy alone (12.3 vs. 10.3 months, 
respectively; HR  
 0.80; p  = 0.003).  The results from this trial were the basis for FDA approval 
of bevacizumab for use in combination with carb oplatin  
 paclitaxel as first -line treatment of 
patients with unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic, non -squamous NSCLC in 
October 2006.  Finally, patients with untreated metastatic breast cancer (E2100) who received 
bevacizumab in combin ation with weekly paclitaxel had a marked improvement in PFS 
compared with chemotherapy alone (13.3 vs. 6.7  months, respectively; HR  
 0.48; p  
 0.0001) 
(see the Bevacizumab Investigator Brochure for additional details).  
 
 
1.4.1 Bevacizumab in Unresectable, Non-Squamous, Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer  
 
The safety and efficacy of Bevacizumab in patients with non -small cell lung cancer was 
investigated in a randomized Phase III trial conducted by [CONTACT_64851] (ECOG 4599)23.  
 
In this multicenter trial, more than [ADDRESS_844117] doses of carboplatin and paclitaxel (PC) or the same regimen 
with the addition of bevacizumab every three weeks at a dose of 15 mg/kg IV (PCB) 
given on day one along with the chemotherapy. Patients were all treatment naïv e, with 
locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic disease. Patients with squamous histology, 
evidence of brain metastasis, uncontrolled hypertension, on anticoagulation therapy, 
unstable angina or a history of hemoptysis (more than half a te aspoon) were ex cluded. 
After completion of chemotherapy, patients continued to receive bevacizumab alone 
every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary

FER-TH-007 Amendment 4   October 1, 2012  10 endpoint of the study was overall survival and secondary endpoints included response  
rate, time to progression and tolerability.  
 
Overall survival was statistically significantly better in the PC plus bevacizumab arm. 
The median overall survival was 12.3 months vs. 10.3 months in the control group 
(hazard ratio 0.80). Response rate (10% vs. 27%) and time to progression (4.5 mos vs. 
6.4 mos) also favored the bevacizumab arm. Toxicities included grade 4/5 neutropenia 
(16.4% vs. 24%); grade 3/4 thrombosis/embolism (3% vs. 3.8%); & hemorrhage (1.0% 
vs 4.1%). There were 11 treatment -related de aths (arm PC: 2; arm PCB: 9); 5 due to 
hemoptysis, all on the bevacizumab arm . Bases on this trial, in October 2006, the FDA 
granted approval of this regimen for patients with locally advanced or metastatic non -
squamous non -small cell lung cancer.  
 
1.5 Clinica l Experience with Erlotinib  
 
As of April 2004, erlotinib has been studied clinically in more than 4000 healthy subjects and 
patients (excluding patients exposed to placebo) in a number of Phase I, II, and III studies.[ADDRESS_844118] been conducted, along with 
three classic Phase I trials in patients w ith advanced cancer.  The single -agent maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) was estimated to be 150 mg administered once daily.   
 
The primary toxicities of single -agent erlotinib consisted of rash (dermatosis), diarrhea, 
nausea, fatigue, stomatitis, vomiting, and  headache.  When given daily, dose -limiting 
toxicity (diarrhea) was observed at 200 mg/day.  At 150  mg/day, diarrhea was 
manageable with the addition of loperamide therapy; this dose was considered the 
maximal tolerated dose.  
 
Rash (variously referred to as dermatitis, acneiform rash, or maculopapular rash) has 
been variable in onset, duration, and severity, but typi[INVESTIGATOR_8160], neck, 
scalp, chest, and back starting after ~1 week of treatment.  The mechanistic basis of the 
rash remains uncert ain; histopathologic examination of biopsies of the rash demonstrated 
inflammatory cell infiltrate and mild epi[INVESTIGATOR_8161].  In some cases, the 
rash gradually improved despi[INVESTIGATOR_8162], in general, resolved without 
sequelae follow ing erlotinib discontinuation.  The rash did not result in study 
discontinuation in patients with cancer in the Phase I trials.   
 
Laboratory abnormalities observed infrequently with single -agent erlotinib involved 
primarily liver function tests, including  elevation of ALT, AST, and/or bilirubin.  
 
Selection of the 150 mg/day dose of erlotinib for subsequent single -agent studies was 
based on pharmacokinetic parameters, as well as the safety and tolerability profile of this 
 
Copyright© 2012 Fox Chase Cancer Center ® Extramural Resea rch Program.  All rights reserved.  
FER-TH-007 Amendment 4   October 1, 2012  11 dose in Phase I trials in heavily p retreated patients with advanced cancer.  Drug levels 
seen in patients with cancer receiving the 150  mg/day dose were consistently above the 
average plasma concentration of 500 ng/mL targeted for clinical efficacy.  
 
1.5.2  Pharmacokinetics  
 
Oral erlotinib is well absorbed and has an extended absorption phase, with mean peak 
plasma levels occurring at 3 hours after oral dosing of 150 mg/dL at steady state.  A study 
in healthy subjects provided an estimate of bioavai lability of 59% (95% CI:  55%, 63%).  
The time to reach steady -state plasma concentration was ~5 days.  The accumulation ratio 
with daily dosing of erlotinib was estimated to be 2.0.  From a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis of 708 patients, the median t rough concentration (C min) 24 
hours following the previous dose was 1041 (
 697) ng/mL.  Median AUC achieved 
during the dosing interval at steady state was 19,801  ng/hr/mL.  Exposure after an oral 
dose is increased by [CONTACT_8208].   
 
There is extensive binding of erlotinib and metabolites to both serum albumin and AAG 
(alpha -1-acid glycoprotein), with total plasma protein binding for erlotinib and OSI -420 
of ~95% and 91%, respectively.  Erlotinib is extensively metabolized in the liver by [CONTACT_632255] —primarily by [CONTACT_097]3A4 and to a lesser extent by 
[CONTACT_097]1A2.  The primary metabolite of erlotinib, OSI -420, has potency comparable to that 
of erlotinib, but is present at levels that are 
  10% of erlotinib levels.  Erlotinib is 
excreted predominantly via the feces (
  90%).  The elimination half -life after a 150 -mg 
oral dose is ~[ADDRESS_844119], central 
nervous system (glioma), and others25-29.  Erlotinib has been evaluated bo th as a single 
agent and administered concurrently with conventional chemotherapy agents using 
various doses and schedules.     
 
Evidence of activity has been observed in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, 
ovarian, breast and pancreatic carcinom a, non –small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and 
glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).  Patients received 150  mg/day of erlotinib in all of 
these studies except the GBM study where dose escalation was allowed until limited by 
[CONTACT_8210] a higher starting dose was t ested in subjects receiving concomitant 
enzyme inducing anti -epi[INVESTIGATOR_006].  Dose reduction was allowed in all studies in the 
case of intolerance.  Diarrhea was treated with loperamide therapy and/or dose reduction.  
Rash was treated with a variety of ag ents, including oral and topi[INVESTIGATOR_8163], 
corticosteroids, and other agents.

FER-TH-[ADDRESS_844120] 
generally experienced the same type of adverse events (AEs) as with either agent alone.   
 
The first randomized placebo controlled trial to demonstrate a survival advantage for an 
EGFR inhibitor was the Phase III study, BR .21.  This international trial, conducted by [CONTACT_632256] (NCIC CTG), includ ed 731 
patients with incurable Stage IIIb/IV NSCLC who have failed standard therapy for 
advanced or metastatic disease.  Patients randomized in a 2:1 ratio to single -agent 
Erlotinib 150 mg/day obtained a 42.5% improvement in median survival over placebo, 
from 4.7 to 6.7 months.  The one -year survival increased significantly (from 22% to 
31%) as did the median and 6 month progression -free survival, response rate, and the 
time to deterioration of tumor related symptoms of pain, cough, and dyspnea.18 . 
 
In BR .21, of the 727 patients evaluable for safety (485 erlotinib, 242 placebo), the most 
common AEs in the erlotinib arm were rash (75% erlotinib, 17% placebo), diarrhea (54% 
erlotinib, 18% placebo) and stomatitis  (17% erlotinib, 18% placebo) events.  The 
majority of these events were mild to moderate in severity.  The incidence of interstitial 
lung disease (ILD) reported was the same in the placebo and erlotinib groups at 0.8% in 
each arm.  
 
Two large, Phase III, r andomized studies in first -line NSCLC patients evaluated erlotinib 
in combination with platinum -based two -drug combination chemotherapy.  A total of 
1079 previously untreated patients received carboplatin/paclitaxel with either erlotinib or 
placebo in the TRIBUTE trial (OSI2298g) conducted in the [LOCATION_002]30.  An 
additional 1172 patients received cisplatin/gemcitabine plus either erlotinib or placebo in 
the TALENT trial (BO16411) conducted in 27  countries in Europe and other ex-U.S. 
locati ons31.  Neither study met its primary endpoint of improved overall survival or a 
secondary endpoint of improved time to disease progression or overall response rate.  
Overall, the number of adverse events and serious adver se events were well balanced 
between the two arms of each study, with two exceptions.  As expected, rash and diarrhea 
occurred more frequently in the Erlotinib arms.  In the TRIBUTE study, more serious 
adverse events resulting in death were seen in the Erl otinib arm compared with the 
placebo arm (53 vs. 27).  Most of the apparent imbalance was due to events reported as 
pneumonia or progression of underlying cancer.30,31. 
 
1.5.4  Patients with Hepatic or Renal impairment  
 
The influence of hepatic metastases and/or hepatic dysfunction on the pharmacokinetics 
of Erlotinib is not yet known.  However, erlotinib is cleared predominately by [CONTACT_4852], 
and caution should be used when admin istering erlotinib to patients with hepatic 
dysfunction. Erlotinib is also a strong inhibitor of the UDP -glucuronosyltransferase 
UGT1A1 enzyme responsible for the glucuronidation of bilirubin.  Hyperbilirubinemia 
appears most often to be a side effect rela ted to genetic polymorphisms of UGT1A1.   
Rare cases of hepatic failure (including fatalities) have been reported during the 
postmarketing use of erlotinib.  Confounding factors for severe hepatic dysfunction have 
included pre -exiting liver disease such as cirrhosis, viral hepatitis, hepatocellular

FER-TH-007 Amendment 4   October 1, 2012  13 carcinoma, hepatic metastases, or concomitant treatment with potentially hepatotoxic 
drugs.    
 
A pharmacokinetic (PK) study (data on file) in patients with advanced solid tumors and 
moderate hepatic impairment acc ording to the Child -Pugh criteria has been completed.  
In this study, 10 of the 15 patients died on treatment from progressive disease, one patient 
died from hepatorenal syndrome and one patient died from rapi[INVESTIGATOR_632224].  Six out of the 10 patients who died had baseline total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_844121] 
suggesting severe, rather than moderate, hepatic impairment, highlighting the limitations 
of utilizing the Child -Pugh criteria in an oncology patient population.  All patients had 
hepatic impairment  due to advanced cancer with liver involvement such as hepatocellular 
carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, or liver metastases.  
 
Rare cases of myocardial infarction (including fatalities) have been reported during the 
postmarketing use of erlotinib.  
 
No clinical  studies have been conducted in patients with compromised renal function 
since Erlotinib and its metabolites are not significantly excreted by [CONTACT_8212].   
 
1.[ADDRESS_844122] demonstrated that the combination of bevacizumab and erlotinib results in greater 
efficacy than either agent alone.  Furthermore, because there is little to no overlap in toxicity 
profile between the two agents, the combination is expected to be well tolerated and may provide 
even greater benefit for patients who are unable to receive cytotoxic therapy.  
 
An investigator -sponsored Phase I/II trial (OSI2486s) has been con ducted to evaluate the 
combination of bevacizumab and erlotinib in subjects with relapsed or refractory NSCLC with 
non-squamous histology32.  This Phase  I study evalu ated three dose combinations to determine 
tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of each agent when combined.  Subjects whose disease 
had progressed following at least one chemotherapy regimen for advanced disease (Stage IIIb or 
IV) were treated with 100  mg/day erlotinib + 7.5 mg/kg Bevacizumab every 3 weeks, 100 
mg/day erlotinib + 15 mg/kg bevacizumab every 3 weeks, or 150 mg/day erlotinib + 15 mg/kg 
bevacizumab every 3 weeks.  A  total of 12 subjects were enrolled and treated (3, 3, and 6  per 
cohort, res pectively).  No dose -limiting toxicities were observed, and the pharmacokinetic 
profiles of both drugs did not appear to be affected by [CONTACT_188183].  
 
For the Phase II portion of the study, 22 subjects were evaluable for safety and efficacy, 
inclusive of the 12 subjects treated in Phase I.  The majority of the subjects had a good 
performance status (11 with a Karnofsky score of 90%), adenocarcinoma histology (14 of 22 
subjects), and fewer than two prior chemotherapy regimens (16 of 22).  The most common  
 
Copyright© 2012 Fox Chase Cancer Center ® Extramural Resea rch Program.  All rights reserved.  
FER-TH-007 Amendment 4   October 1, 2012  14 adverse events were rash (20 of 22 subjects), diarrhea (14 of 22), proteinuria (11 of 22), and 
nausea (9 of 22).  All of the events were Grade  1 or 2.  There was one epi[INVESTIGATOR_119988]  1 
hemoptysis and one epi[INVESTIGATOR_119988] 3 hypertension.  Eleven of the 22 subjects (50%) 
experienced progressive disease after the first 6 weeks of therapy.  Four partial responses 
(18.8%) and seven instances of stable disease (31.2%) were reported.  Based on the preliminary 
data from this single -arm, Phase I/II study, it appear s that the combination of bevacizumab and 
erlotinib is well tolerated by [CONTACT_632257], 
supporting a larger, controlled study to assess the efficacy and tolerability of the regimen.  
 
At the recent ASCO meeting,  Fehrenbacher presented an abstract from a study were patients 
with NSCLC were randomized to three different arms: chemo plus placebo, chemo plus 
bevacizumab and erlotinib plus bevacizumab (AT). In this population (not limited to the elderly), 
the serious adverse event rates were somewhat less common in the erlotinib plus bevacizumab 
arm compared to the other two arms. There was one case of a pulmonary hemorrhage in this arm 
vs. two in the chemo plus bevacizumab arm. Study discontinuation due to adverse eve nts were 
also less frequent in the AT arm. Efficacy was similar to the chemo plus bevacizumab arm and 
better that the chemo alone group34.  Hence the safety of this regimen has been tested and 
validated in a broader population of patients with advanced NSCLC.  
1.7 Study Rationale  
 
The elderly (age > 65) comprise more than 40% of newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC, but are 
inadequately represented in the published therapeutic literature – rarely more than 20% of the 
population s studied.  Based on the retrospective analysis of two large trials (SWOG 9509, 
SWOG 9308)1,2, elderly lung cancer patients  tend to have more co -morbidities, enhanced toxicity 
to cytotoxic chemotherapy, and trend towards worsened overall survival.  It has been reported in 
the ELVIS3 trial that the fit elderly (PS 0 -1) appear to benefit from systemic therapy (compared 
to best su pportive care) with respect to QOL and overall survival, but many older patients refuse 
systemic chemotherapy because of the perceived increase in risk of toxicity.  Less toxic 
alternatives are obviously needed in elderly patients with advanced NSCLC who a re chemo -
averse or who appear vulnerable or frail, even if their performance status technically is intact.  
 
In the literature, there is no definite evidence of superiority for one systemic therapy over 
another.  Erlotinib is a well -tolerated EGFR -TKI which  has been extensively tested in advanced 
NSCLC patients, especially in heavily pre -treated patients.  With the exception of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_632225], single agent erlotinib has not been studied exclusively in the elderly; and the 
combination of erlotinib an d bevacizumab has never been studied exclusively in the treatment -
naïve elderly.  This study, first of its kind, will explore the response rate in treatment -naïve 
elderly patients with advanced NSCLC –an important cohort that needs less toxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

3.1 Description of the Study  
 
The dose of bevacizumab in this study is 15  mg/kg administered by I V infusion on the first day 
of each 3 -week cycle.   
 
The dose of erlotinib is 150  mg/day orally starting on cycle 1 day 1.  Tablets should be taken at 
the same time each day with ~200  mL (6

6.0 Treatments  
 
6.1 Bevacizumab  
 
6.1.1 Bevacizumab formulation (supplied by [CONTACT_8229])  
 
Bevacizumab is a cl ear to slightly opalescent, colorless to pale brown, sterile liquid 
concentrate for solution for intravenous (IV) infusion.   Bevacizumab may be supplied in 
5-cc (100 -mg), 20 -cc (400 -mg), and 50 -cc (1000 -mg) glass vials containing 4 mL, 16 
mL, or 40 mL of b evacizumab, respectively (all at 25 mg/mL).   Vials contain 
bevacizumab with phosphate, trehalose, polysorbate 20, and Sterile Water for Injection 
(SWFI), USP.   Vials contain no preservative and are suitable for single use only.  
For further details and mole cule characterization, see the bevacizumab Investigator 
Brochure.  
 
6.1.2 Bevacizumab Safety Profile  
 
 In the initial Phase I and II clinical trials, four potential bevacizumab -associated safety 
signals were identified: hypertension, proteinuria, thromboembolic e vents, and 
hemorrhage.  Additional completed Phase II and Phase III studies of bevacizumab as well 
as spontaneous reports have further defined the safety profile of this agent. Bevacizumab -
associated adverse events identified in phase III trials include co ngestive heart failure 
(CHF)  primarily in metastatic breast cancer , gastrointestinal perforations, wound healing 
complications, and arterial thromboembolic events (ATE). These and other safety signals 
are described in further detail as follows and in the b evacizumab Investigator Brochure.  
 
Hypertension : An increased incidence of hypertension has been observed  in 
patients treated with  bevacizumab Grade [ADDRESS_844136] included hyperten sive crisis, hypertensive 
encephalopathy, and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) (Ozcan 
et al., 2006; Glusker et al., 2006).  
 
 
Copyright© 2012 Fox Chase Cancer Center ® Extramural Resea rch Program.  All rights reserved.  
FER-TH-007 Amendment 4   October 1, 2012  21 Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome:  There have been rare reports 
of bevacizumab -treated pati ents developi[INVESTIGATOR_632228], a ra re neurologic disorder that can present with the following signs  and symptoms 
of headache, altered mental function, seizures, and visual disturbances / cortical blindness 
with or without  associated hypertension. Brain imaging is mandatory to confirm the 
diagnosis of RPLS.  In patients who develop RPLS, treatment of specific symptoms, 
includ ing control of hypertension, management of specific symptoms, and 
discontinuation of bevacizumab . (Glusker et al. 2006; Ozcan et al. 2006).   
 
There is no information on the effect of bevacizumab in patients with uncontrolled 
hypertension at the time of initiating bevacizumab therapy.  Therefore, caution should be 
exercised before initiating bevacizumab t herapy in these patients.  Monitoring of blood 
pressure is recommended during bevacizumab therapy.  Optimal co ntrol of blood 
pressure according to standard public health guidelines is recommended for patients on 
treatment with or without bevacizumab.   
 
Temporary interruption of bevacizumab therapy is recommended in patients with 
hypertension requiring medical therapy until adequate control is achieved.  
If hypertension cannot be controlled with medical therapy, bevacizumab therapy should 
be permanently dis continued.  Bevacizumab should be permanently discontinued in 
patients who develop hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy.  
 
Proteinuria :  An increased in cidence of p roteinuria has been observed  in patients treated 
with bevacizumab compared with  control arm patients . In the bevacizumab -containing 
treatment arms of clinical trials (across all indications), the incidence of proteinuria 
(reported as an adverse event) was up to 38% (metastatic CRC Study AVF2192g).  The 
severity of proteinuria has ran ged from asymptomatic and transient events detected on 
routine dipstick urinalysis to nephrotic syndrome; the majority of proteinuria events have 
been grade 1. NCI-CTC Grade 3 proteinuria was reported in up  to 3% of bevacizumab -
treated patients, and Grade 4 in up to 1.4% of bevacizumab -treated patients.  The 
proteinuria seen in bevacizumab clinical trials was not associated with renal impairment 
and rarely required permanent discontinuation of Bevacizumab therapy.  Bevacizumab 
should be discontinued in pati ents who develop Grade 4 proteinuria (nephr otic 
syndrome).  
 
In study AVF2107g, none of the 118 patients receiving bolus -IFL plus placebo, three of 
158 patients (2%) receiving bolus -IFL plus bevacizumab, and two of 50 (4%) patients 
receiving 5 -FU/LV plus be vacizumab who had a 24 -hour collection experienced grade 3 
proteinuria (> 3.5 g protein/24 hr). Rare events of nephrotic syndrome have occurred, and 
bevacizumab should be discontinued in patients with nephrotic syndrome.  
 
Thromboembolic Events :  Both venou s and arterial thromboembolic (TE) events, 
ranging in severity from catheter -associated phlebitis to fatal, have been reported in 
patients treated with bevacizumab in the colorectal cancer trials and, to a lesser extent, in 
patients treated with bevacizuma b in NSCLC and breast cancer trials.

FER-TH-007 Amendment 4   October 1, 2012  22 Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis pulmonary 
embolism, and thrombophlebitis:   In the phase III pi[INVESTIGATOR_47273], 
there was a slightly higher rate of venous TE  events in patients tr eated with bevacizumab 
plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone (19% vs. 16%). There was also a 
higher rate of arterial TE  events (3% vs. 1%) such as myocardial infarction, transient 
ischemia attack, cerebrovascular accident/stroke and angina/uns table angina . A pooled 
analysis of the rate of arterial TE events from 5 randomized studies (1745 patients) 
showed that treatment with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab increased the risk of having 
an arterial TE event compared with chemotherapy alone (3.8% vs . 1.7 %, respectively) 
(Skillings et al., 2005). Furthermore, subjects with certain baseline characteristics (age ≥ 
65 years and/or a history of a prior arterial TE event) may be at higher risk of 
experiencing such an event. . See the bevacizumab Investigator Br ochure for additional 
information on risk factors.  
 
In Study AVF2107g, a Phase III, pi[INVESTIGATOR_47273], VTE events, including 
deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and thrombophlebitis, occurred in 15.2% 
of patients receiving chemotherap y alone and 16.6% of patients receiving 
chemotherapy  
 bevacizumab.  
 
The incidence of NCI -CTC Grade  
 3 venous VTE events in one NSCLC trial (E4599) 
was higher in the bevacizumab -containing arm compared to the chemotherapy control 
arm (5.6% vs. 3.2%).  On e event (0.2%) was fatal in the bevacizumab -containing arm; no 
fatal events were reported in the carboplatin/paclitaxel arm (see Bevacizumab 
Investigator Brochure ).  In  metastatic CRC clinical trials, the incidence of VTE events 
was similar in patients rec eiving chemotherapy  
 bevacizumab and those receiving the 
control chemotherapy alone.  
 
In clinical trials across all indications the overall incidence of VTE events was 
2.8%
 17.3% in the bevacizumab -containing arms compared with 3.2%
 15.6% in the 
chemothe rapy control arms.  The use of bevacizumab with chemotherapy does not 
substantially increase the risk of VTE event compared with chemotherapy alone.  
However, patients with metastatic CRC who receive bevacizumab and experienced a 
VTE event may be at higher  risk for recurrence of VTE event.  
 
Arterial Thromboembotic Events:  An increased incidence of ATE events was 
observed in patients treated with bevacizumab compared with those receiving control 
treatment.  ATE include cerebrovascular accidents, myocardial infarction, transient 
ischemic attacks (TIAs), and other ATE.  In a pooled analysis of data from five 
randomized Phase II and III trials (mCRC [AVF2107g, AVF2192g, AVF0780g]; locally 
advanced or metastatic NSCLC [AVF0757g]; metastatic breast cancer [AVF211 9g]), the 
incidence rate of ATE was 3.8% (37 of 963) in patients who received 
chemotherapy  
 bevacizumab compared with 1.7% (13 of 782) in patients treated with 
chemotherapy alone.  ATE led to a fatal outcome in 0.8% (8 of 963) of patients treated 
with che motherapy  
 bevacizumab and 0.5% (4 of 782) of patients treated with 
chemotherapy alone.  Cerebrovascular accidents (including TIAs) occurred in 2.3% of

FER-TH-007 Amendment 4   October 1, 2012  23 patients treated with chemotherapy  
 bevacizumab and 0.5% of patients treated with 
chemotherapy alone.  Myocardial infarction occurred in 1.4% of patients treated with 
chemotherapy  
 bevacizumab compared with 0.7% of patients treated with chemotherapy 
alone (see the Bevacizumab Investigator Brochure for additional details).  
 
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_33930] a standard therapy fo r primary and secondary prophylaxis of arterial 
thromboembolic events in patients at high risk of such events, and the use of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] ≤ 
[ADDRESS_844137] to metastatic colorectal cancer patients were 
presented at ASCO 2005 (Hambleton et al., 2005). Further analyses of the effects of 
concomitant use of bevacizumab and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_51674].  
 
Gastrointestinal perforation : Patients with metastatic carcinoma may be at 
increased risk for the development of gastrointestinal perforation and fistula when treated 
with bevacizumab and chemotherapy. Bevacizumab should be permanently discontinued 
in patients who develop gastrointest inal perforation. A causal association of intra -
abdominal inflammatory process and gastrointestinal perforation to bevacizumab has not 
been established. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when treating patients with 
intra-abdominal inflammatory proc esses with bevacizumab. Gastrointestinal perforation 
has been reported in other trials in non -colorectal cancer populations (e.g., ovarian, renal 
cell, pancreas, breast , and NSCLC ) and may be higher in incidence in some tumor types.  
 
Fistula :  Bevacizumab use has been associated with serious cases of fistulae 
including events resulting in death.  Fistulae in the GI tract are common (1% –10% 
incidence) in patients with metastatic CRC, but uncommon (0.1%
 1%) or rare (0.01% –
0.1%) in other indications.  In addit ion, fistulae that involve areas of the body other than 
the GI tract (e.g., tracheoesophageal, bronchopleural, urogenital, biliary) have been 
reported uncommonly (0.1% –1%) in patients receiving bevacizumab in clinical studies 
and postmarketing reports.  Ev ents were reported at various timepoints during treatment, 
ranging from [ADDRESS_844138], 
discontinuation of bevacizumab should be considered  
 
Wound healing complications:   Wound healing complications such as wound 
dehiscence have been reported in patients receiving bevacizumab. In an analysis of 
 
Copyright© 2012 Fox Chase Cancer Center ® Extramural Resea rch Program.  All rights reserved.  
FER-TH-007 Amendment 4   October 1, 2012  24 pooled data from two trials in metastatic colorectal cancer, patients undergoing surgery 
28-60 days before study treatment with 5 -FU/LV plus bevacizumab did not appear to 
have an increased risk of wound healing complications compared to those treated with 
chemotherapy alone (Scappaticci et al., 2005). Surgery in patients currently receiving 
bevacizumab i s not recommended. No definitive data are available to define a safe 
interval after bevacizumab exposure with respect to wound healing risk in patients 
receiving elective surgery; however, the estimated half life of bevacizumab is 21 days. 
Bevacizumab shou ld be discontinued in patients with severe wound healing 
complications.  
 
Hemorrhage :   Overall, grade 3 and 4 bleeding events were observed in 4.0% of 
1132 patients treated with bevacizumab in a pooled database from eight phase I, II, and 
III clinical tria ls in multiple tumor types (bevacizumab Investigator Brochure, October 
2005). The hemorrhagic events that have been observed in bevacizumab clinical studies 
were predominantly tumor -associated hemorrhage (see below) and minor mucocutaneous 
hemorrhage.  
 
Tumor-associated hemorrhage : Major or massive pulmonary hemorrhage or 
hemoptysis has been  observed primarily in patients with NSCLC.  Life -threatening and 
fatal hemoptysis was identified as a bevacizuma b-related adverse event in NSCLC trials.  
These events o ccurred suddenly and presented as major or massive hemoptysis .  Among 
the possible risk factors evaluated  (including   squamous cell histology , treatment with 
anti-rheumatic/anti -inflammatory drugs, treatment with anticoagulants, prior 
radiotherapy, bevaciz umab therapy, previous medical history of atherosclerosis,  and/or 
tumors located in the center of the chest in close proximity to major blood vessels  and 
cavitation of tumors during therapy),  the only variables that showed statistically 
significant correla tions with bleeding were bevacizumab therapy and squamous cell 
histology.  
 
Of patients experiencing pulmonary hemorrhages requiring medical intervention, many 
had cavitation and/or necrosis of the tumor, either preexisting or developi[INVESTIGATOR_632229].  Patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_632230] -benefit.  
 
In ECOG -conducted study E4599, in which squamous cell carcinoma was excluded, the 
rate of any type of Grade ≥ 3 hemorrhage was 1.0% in the control arm 
(carboplatin/paclitaxel) versus 4.1% in the carboplatin/paclitaxel + bevacizumab arm23. 
 
GI hemorrhages, including rectal bleeding and melena have been reported in patients 
with CRC, and have been assesse d as tumor -associated hemorrhages.  
 
Tumor -associated hemorrhages were also seen rarely in other tumor types and locations, 
including a case of CNS bleeding in a patient with hepatoma with occult CNS metastases 
and a patient who developed continuous oozing of blood from a thigh sarcoma with 
necrosis.

FER-TH-007 Amendment 4   October 1, 2012  25 Mucocutaneous  Hemorrhage:  Across all bevacizumab clinical trials, 
mucocutaneous hemorrhage has been seen in 20% -40% of patients treated with 
bevacizumab. These were most commonly grade [ADDRESS_844139] also been less common events of minor 
mucocutaneous hemorrhage in other locations, such as gingival bleeding and vaginal 
bleeding.  
 
Congestive heart failure :  In clinical trials CHF was observed in all cancer indications 
studied to date, but predominantly in patients with metastatic breast cancer.  These events 
varied in severity from asymptomatic declines in left ventricul ar ejection fraction (LVEF) 
to symptomatic CHF requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_632231]/or left ventricular function following treatment.  CHF has been 
reported in bevacizumab clinical trials and may be increas ed in incidence in patients with 
prior exposure to anthracyclines or prior irradiation to the chest wall. In a phase III trial 
(AVF2119g) of capecitabine with or without bevacizumab for metastatic breast cancer, 7 
subjects (3.1%) who received capecitabine plus bevacizumab developed clinically 
significant CHF compared with 2 subjects (0.9%) treated with capecitabine alone; of 
note, all subjects in this trial had had prior anthracycline treatment. In addition, 2 subjects 
had a left ventricular ejection fracti on < 50% at baseline and [ADDRESS_844140] 
cancer (E2100), the incidence of LVEF decrease (defined as NCI -CTC Grade 3 or 4) in 
the paclitaxel  
 bevacizumab arm was 0.3% versus 0% for the paclitaxel alone arm .  
 
No information is available on patients with preexisting CHF of [LOCATION_001] Heart 
Association (NYHA) Class II
 IV at the time of initiating bevacizumab therapy, as these 
patients w ere excluded from clinical trials.  
 
Prior anthracycline exposure and/or prior radiotherapy to the chest wall may be possible 
risk factors for the development of CHF.  Caution should be exercised before initiating 
bevacizumab therapy in patients with these risk factors.  
 
A recently published phase II study in subjects with refractory acute myelogenous 
leukemia reported 5 cases of cardiac dysfunction (CHF or decreases to <40% in left 
ventricular ejection fraction) of 48 subjects treated with sequential cytara bine, 
mitoxantrone, and bevacizumab. All but one of these subjects had significant prior 
exposure to anthracyclines as well (Karp et al., 2004). Other studies are ongoing in this 
patient population. Patients receiving anthracyclines or with prior exposure to 
anthracyclines should have a baseline MUGA or ECHO with a normal ejection fraction.  
 
Neutropenia:   Increased rates of severe neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or infection 
with severe neutropenia (including some fatalities) have been observed in patient s treated 
with some myelotoxic chemotherapy regimens plus bevacizumab in comparison to 
chemotherapy alone23.

Additional Safety Signals:   
 
Other safety concerns seen to date —asthenia, pain, headache, fever, chills, rash, 
infection, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], and mouth ulc eration —are not thought to be clinically significant in 
that they rarely or never required treatment or study drug discontinuation.  An additional 
SAE reported in patients receiving bevacizumab is Nasal Septum Perforation.  
 
Non-Gastrointestinal fistula for mation has been reported in patients treated with 
bevacizumab (< 0.3%) some with fatal outcome.  Permanent discontinuation of 
bevacizumab in patients with fistula formation involving any internal organ is 
recommended in a recent addition to the WARNINGS se ction of the Avastin label.  
 
If patients on treatment with bevacizumab require elective major surgery, it is 
recommended that bevacizumab be held for 4 -8 weeks prior to the surgical procedure. 
Patients undergoing a major surgical procedure should not begin /restart bevacizumab 
until 4 weeks after that procedure (in the case of high risk procedures such as liver 
resection, thoracotomy, or neurosurgery, it is recommended that chemotherapy be 
restarted no earlier than 6 wk and bevacizumab no earlier than 8 wk a fter surgery).  
 
Additional Adverse Events: See the bevacizumab Investigator Brochure for additional 
details regarding the safety experience with bevacizumab.  
 
6.1.3 Bevacizumab Dosage and Administration  
 
Bevacizumab will be given at a dose of 15 mg/kg IV on day 1 of each 21 day cycle.  
 
Bevacizumab will be diluted in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, to a total volume 
of [ADDRESS_844141] infusion is tolerated without infusion -associated adverse events 
(fever and/or chills), the second infusion may be delivered over 60
 10 minutes.  If the 
60-minute infusion is well tolerated, all subsequent infusions may be delivered over 
30
10 minutes.   
 
6.1.4  Bevacizumab Storage  
 
Upon receipt of the study drug, vials are to be refrigerated at  2
C–8
C  
(36
F–46
F) and should remain refrigerated until just prior to use.  DO NOT FREEZE.  
DO NOT SHAKE.   Vials should be protected from light.  
 
Opened vials must be used within [ADDRESS_844142] be administered within 8 hours.

FER-TH-[ADDRESS_844143]. Bevacizumab has a terminal half -life of 21 days; 
therefore, its discontinuatio n results in slow elimination over several months. There is no 
available antidote for bevacizumab.  
 
Subjects should be assessed clinically for toxicity prior to, during, and after each 
infusion. If unmanageable toxicity occurs because of bevacizumab at an y time during the 
study, treatment on study should be discontinued.  
 
Infusion Reaction  Related to Bevacizumab :  
 
Infusion of bevacizumab should be interrupted for subjects who develop dyspnea or 
clinically significant hypotension. Subjects who experience a NCI CTCAE v. 3.0 Grade 3 
or 4 allergic reaction/hypersensitivity, adult respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], or 
bronchospasm (regardless of grade) will be discontinued from bevacizumab treatment  
and removed from the study .  Document the reason for  remov al as 
hypersensitivity/bevacizumab.  
 
The infusion should be slowed to 50% or less or interrupted for subjects who experience 
any infusion -associated symptoms not specified above. When the subject’s symptoms 
have completely resolved, the infusion may be continued at no more than 50% of the rate 
prior to the reaction and increased in 50% increments every 30 minutes if well tolerated. 
Infusions may be restarted at the full rate during the next cycle.  
 
Adverse events requiring delays or permanent discontinuation of b evacizumab are listed 
in Table 1.  Infusion reactions are described in section 6.1.3  
 
Regardless of the reason for holding bevacizumab treatment, including the events in 
Table 1, the maximum allowable length of treatment interruption is three weeks. If > 
three weeks, discontinue treatment.  Treatment with erlotinib will continue during this 
period.   Protocol treatment will discontinue if any of the drugs are held for more than 
three weeks.

A number of measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this 
trial.  These measures will be addressed through exclusion criteria (see Section 4.2) and 
routine monitoring as follows.  
 
Patients enrolled in this study will be evaluated clinically and with standard laboratory 
tests before and at regular intervals during their participation in this study.  Safety 
evaluations will consist of medical interviews, recording of adverse events, physical 
examinations, blood pres sure, and laboratory measurements.  Patients will be evaluated 
for adverse events (all grades), serious adverse events, and adverse events requiring study 
drug interruption or discontinuation at each study visit for the duration of their 
participation in t he study.  Patients discontinued from the treatment phase of the study for 
any reason will be evaluated ~30  days (28 –42 days) after the decision to discontinue 
treatment (see Section 5.0).  Specific monitoring procedures are as follows:  
 
 Hypertension will be monitored through routine evaluation of blood pressure prior 
to each bevacizumab treatment.  Optimal control of blood pressure is required.  
For blood pressure ≥  150/100 mm/Hg on the day of treatment with bevacizumab , 
which can not be controlled with stan dard antihypertensive therapy,  treatment 
with bevacizumab must be withheld.  
 If patients on treatment with bevacizumab require elective major surgery, they 
must be taken off study (section 5.1).  It is recommended that bevacizumab be 
held for 4 -8 weeks pri or to the surgical procedure. Patients undergoing a major 
surgical procedure should not begin/restart bevacizumab until 4 weeks after that 
procedure (in the case of high risk procedures such as liver resection, 
thoracotomy, or neurosurgery, it is recommend ed that chemotherapy be restarted 
no earlier than 6 wk and bevacizumab no earlier than 8 wk after surgery).  It is the 
treating physician’s discretion whether or not to resume bevacizumab but i f

through this study.  
 In patients with bleeding, hemostasis evaluation should be performed as clinically 
indicated.   
 Proteinuria will be monitored through urinary protein/creatinine ratio  or dipstick  
performed  at least every [ADDRESS_844146] an ongoing bevacizumab -related Grade 4 or serious adverse 
event at the time of discontinuation from study treatment will continue to be 
followed until resolution or deemed irreversible.  
 
Erlotinib will continue as per protocol guidelines until  toxicities resolve and bevacizumab 
is continued or until the patient is removed from the study.  
 
6.2 Erlotinib (Tarceva) (supplied by [CONTACT_8229])  
 
6.2.1 Formulation  
 
In addition to the active ingredient, Tarceva (erlotinib hydro chloride), tablets contain 
lactose (hydrous), microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, sodium lauryl 
sulfate, and magnesium stearate.   
 
Tablets containing 25 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg of erlotinib are available.  The oral tablets 
are conventional , immediate -release tablets containing erlotinib as the hydrochloride salt.  
Each bottle will contain 30 tablets, a quantity sufficient for 4 consecutive weeks of 
dosing, with overage.   
 
For further details, see the erlotinib Investigator Brochure.  
 
6.2.2 Erlot inib Safety Profile  
 
Common adverse events associated with erlotinib  administration include rash and 
diarrhea.  Other common adverse events include nausea/vomiting, mucositis/stomatitis, 
headache, and fatigue.  
 
A rash occurred in 75% of erlotinib -treated NSCLC patients enrolled in BR.21.  Similar 
incidence of rash have occurred when erlotinib was administered concurrently with 
chemotherapy including gemcitabine, paclitaxel/carboplatin, and gemcitabine/cisplatin.  
A papular, pustular rash manifesting most o ften on the face and upper trunk was common 
across all studies, but rash was rarely the cause of study drug discontinuation. Other 
dermatologic manifestations reported in clinical studies or postmarketing use of erlotinib  
include nail changes, paronychia, painful fissures or cracking of the skin on the hands and 
feet, and hair growth abnormalities (alopecia, thinning hair, eyelash/eyebrow changes, 
hirsutism).  
 
Wearing of contact [CONTACT_632266].  The 
incidence of diarrhea in BR.21 was 54% of erlotinib -treated NSCLC patients.  The 
 
Copyright© 2012 Fox Chase Cancer Center ® Extramural Resea rch Program.  All rights reserved.  
FER-TH-[ADDRESS_844147] been infrequent reports of serious (including fatal) intersti tial lung disease 
(ILD) in patients receiving erlotinib  for treatment of NSCLC or other advanced solid 
tumors.  In Study BR.21, the incidence of ILD (0.8%) was the same in the placebo and 
erlotinib  groups.  The overall incidence in erlotinib -treated patien ts from all studies 
(including uncontrolled studies and studies with concurrent chemotherapy) is 
approximately 0.6%.  Included in this rate of ILD are reported diagnoses of pneumonitis, 
radiation pneumonitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, interstitial pneu monia, interstitial 
lung disease, obliterative bronchiolitis, pulmonary fibrosis, acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_13086], alveolitis, and lung infiltration, irrespective of investigator assessed causality.  
Most of the cases were associated with confounding o r contributing factors such as 
concomitant/prior chemotherapy, prior radiotherapy, preexisting parenchymal lung 
disease, metastatic lung disease, or pulmonary infections.  
 
Cases of hepatorenal syndrome, acute renal failure (including fatalities), and renal  
insufficiency have been reported. Some were secondary to baseline hepatic impairment 
while others were associated with severe dehydration due to diarrhea, vomiting, and/or 
anorexia or concurrent chemotherapy use. In the event of dehydration, particularly in 
patients with contributing risk factors for renal failure (eg, pre -existing renal disease, 
medical conditions or medications that may lead to renal disease, or other predisposing 
conditions including advanced age), erlotinib  therapy should be interrupte d and 
appropriate measures should be taken to intensively rehydrate the patient. Periodic 
monitoring of renal function and serum electrolytes is recommended in patients at risk of 
dehydration.  
 
Erlotinib  is both protein bound (92% –95%) and metabolized by h epatic cytochromes 
CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 and pulmonary cytochrome CYP1A1.  Therefore, a potential for 
drug–drug interaction exists when erlotinib  is co -administered with drugs that are highly 
protein bound or that are CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers.   
 
Co-administ ration of erlotnib  with omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, decreased the 
exposure of erlotinib  (AUC) by 46% and the maximum concentration (C max) by 61%. 
There was no change to Tmax or half -life.  Therefore, drugs that alter the pH of the GI 
tract may alt er the solubility of erlotinib  and hence its bioavailability.  
 
The exposure to erlotinib  (AUC) increased to a moderate extent, by 39%, and the 
maximum concentration (C max) by 17%, when erlotinib  was co -administered with 
ciprofloxacin, an inhibitor of both CYP3A4 and CYP1A2.  
 
Erotinib  clearance can be induced by [CONTACT_13443]1A2 induction. Potential drug -
drug interaction is expected when erlotinib  is taken with CYP1A2 inducers or inhibitors.  
In a single -dose study in healthy volunteers, the AUC was reduce d by 64% in smokers 
when compared with nonsmokers.  In BR.21, current smokers achieved erlotinib steady -
state trough plasma concentrations, which were approximately 2 -fold less than the former 
 
Copyright© 2012 Fox Chase Cancer Center ® Extramural Resea rch Program.  All rights reserved.  
FER-TH-[ADDRESS_844148] was accom panied by a 24% 
increase in apparent erlotinib plasma clearance. Similarly, in a Phase I (N=35) dose 
escalation PK study in NSCLC patients who were current smokers, Pka at steady -state 
indicated a dose proportional increase in erlotinib exposure when the erlotinib  dose was 
increased from 150mg to 300mg. However, the exact dose to be recommended for 
smokers is unknown. These data suggest that patients who continue to smoke may be 
under dosed when treated with the current approved erlotinib  dosage of 150mg, t herefore, 
warranting consideration of dose escalation.   Patients should be advised to stop smoking.  
If patients continue to smoke, a cautious increase in the dose of erlotinib , not exceeding 
300mg/day may be considered while monitoring the patient’s safe ty. If patients decide to 
stop smoking while on a higher dose, then the dose should be reduced immediately to the 
indicated starting dose.  Efficacy and long -term safety (>14 days) of a higher dose than 
the recommended starting dose has not been establishe d in patients who continue to 
smoke.   Pretreatment or co -administration of erlotinib  did not alter the clearance of a 
prototypi[INVESTIGATOR_47292]3A4 substrate, midazolam.  Therefore, significant metabolic 
interactions with other CYP3A4 substrates are unlikely.  Howev er, the oral 
bioavailability of midazolam decreased by [CONTACT_8622] 24% following erlotinib  treatment, 
which was not attributed to a metabolic interaction.  
 
Pretreatment  or co -administration of erlotinib  did not alter the clearance of a prototypi[INVESTIGATOR_529197]3A4 substr ate, midazolam.  Therefore, significant metabolic interactions with other 
CYP3A4 substrates are unlikely.  However, the oral bioavailability of midazolam 
decreased by [CONTACT_8622] 24% following erlotinib  treatment, which was not attributed to a 
metabolic interact ion. 
 
Co-administration of erlotinib  with an inhibitor  of CYP3A4 metabolism (ketoconazole, 
200 mg po BID for 5 days) resulted in increased exposure to erlotinib  as measured by [CONTACT_1629] 
86% increase in median erlotinib  AUC and a 69% increase C max, compared with 
administration of erlotinib  alone.  
 
Induction of CYP3A4 metabolism by a known enzyme inducer (rifampin, 600  mg po QD 
for 7 days) resulted in a 69% decrease in the median erlotinib  AUC, compared with 
administration of erlotinib  alone.  However, the effect of  rifampin on C max was negligible.  
In another study, rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_529198] -administration of rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_632233] a single 450 mg dose of erlotinib  resulted in a mean erlotinib  exposure (AUC) that 
was 57.6% of that observed following a single 1 50 mg erlotinib  dose in the absence of 
rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_47279].  Therefore, a potential for drug -drug interaction exists when 
erlotinib  is co -administered with drugs that are highly protein bound or that are potent 
CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers.  
 
Internationa l normalized ratio (INR) elevations and/or bleeding events have been 
reported in some cancer patients while on erlotinib  alone and in combination with other 
chemotherapeutic agents, and concomitant NSAIDS or anticoagulants, including 
warfarin.

Based on clinical results, rash (dermatosis), diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, stomatitis, vomiting 
and headache were the most frequently observed undesirable effects following exposure 
to single -agent erlotinib. Patients receiving erlotinib in  combination with various 
chemotherapy agents have generally experienced the same type of AEs as with either 
agent alone. AEs considered study drug related that appear to occur more frequently 
when erlotinib is administered with chemotherapy , regardless of  regimen , includ e nausea, 
vomiting, stomatitis, and anemia.  
 
 General Plan to Manage Safety Concerns:  
 
A number of measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this 
trial, addressed through exclusion criteria and routine monitor ing.  Patients will be 
evaluated for adverse events at each study visit for the duration of their participation in 
the study and for  a minimum of  30 days afte r the discontinuation of erlotinib .  
 
Skin toxicities will be monitored by [CONTACT_632267].    The following agents may be used to treat rash:  diphenhydramine, 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_47283], and topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] (clindamycin) or oral antibiotics (tetracycline, 
minocycline, doxycycline).  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_529199].   
 
Diarrhea will be monitored and managed symptomatically.  Guidelines for management 
include administration of loperamide and erlotinib  dose reduction/interruption as 
described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
 
Although quite rare, ILD can be life threate ning.  Therefore, patients should be monitored 
closely for symptoms consistent with ILD, such as new onset dyspnea without an obvious 
cause.  In the event that ILD is suspected, erlotinib  treatment should be discontinued and 
the patient should receive appr opriate medical management.  Although there is no proven 
therapy, systemic corticosteroids are often provided.  Erlotinib  should not be restarted in 
those patients suspected of having drug -related ILD.  See Section [IP_ADDRESS]  and Table 4 for 
management guidel ines, including erlotinib  dose interruption.

FER-TH-[ADDRESS_844149], and/or bilirubin, have 
been observed infrequently with single -agent erlotinib  and occasionally with erlotinib  in 
combination with concomitant che motherapy.   Treatment with erlotinib  should be used 
with extra caution in patients with total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_844150].   Patients with hepatic 
impairment (total bilirubin > ULN or Child -Pugh A, B and C) should be closely 
monitored during therapy with erlotini b.  Erlotinib  dosing should be interrupted or 
discontinued if changes in liver function are severe such as doubling of total bilirubin 
and/or tripling of transaminases in the setting of pretreatment values outside normal 
range .   
 
Women of childbearing pot ential should have a negative pregnancy test prior to starting 
therapy with erlotinib. Men and women should use adequate contraceptive methods 
during and for at least [ADDRESS_844151] -feeding while receiving erlotinib  
therapy.  
 
 
6.2.3  Dosage and Adm inistration  
 
Erlotinib will be self -administered in an open -label, unblinded manner to all patients 
enrolled in the study . During the treatment period, patients will receive erlotinib  
150 mg/da y.  Tablets should be taken at the same time each day with [ADDRESS_844152] 1  hour before or 2 hours after a meal .  Patients who are unable to swallow tablets 
may dissolve the tablets in distilled water for administration.  
 
Dose reductions for adve rse events will be permitted (see Section 6.2.6 ). Treatment  is 
continued daily until disease progression or other reason for termination of study therapy 
(see Section 5. 1). 
 
6.2.4  Drug Ordering and Accountability  
 
All study drug required for completion of  this study will be provided by [CONTACT_8230] -
Pharmaceutical (manufacturer), in partnership with Genentech and distributed through 
Biologics Inc.  
   
Following submission and approval of the required regulatory documents, the initial 
order may be placed.  Biologics d rug order forms and ordering procedure will be 
presented at the site initiation meeting.

6.2.5 Storage  
Erlotinib tablets will be supplied for clinical trials in white, high -density polyethylene 
(HDPE) bottles with child -resistant closures and should be stored at temperatures 
between 15°C and 30°C (59°F and 86°F).  
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_844154] at any time during 
the study.  The patient will remain on bevacizumab until toxicities resolve and erlotinib is 
resumed or until the patient is removed from the study.  Toxicity grading is based on 
NCI-CTCAE, v 3.0.  Dose level reductions are presented in Table 2.  If patients do not 
tolerate the second dose reduction, erlotinib is to be discontinued  and the patient removed 
from the study .

FER-TH-007 Amendment 4   October 1, 2012  37 experiencing Grade 4 skin toxicity should be discontinued from study treatment.     
 
Skin toxicities will be monitored by [CONTACT_8223].  Because secondary bacterial infections  are common and can 
lead to more serious complications, topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], or systemic antibiotics may be 
considered.  Anecdotally, topi[INVESTIGATOR_8165] a short course of systemic corticosteroids can 
be helpful.  See Table 3 for management guidelines, including erlotinib dose  
reduction/interruption.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Gastrointestinal  
 
Diarrhea will be monitored and managed symptomatically.  Guidelines for 
management include administration of loperamide and erlotinib dose 
reduction/interruption as described in Table 3. 
 
For Grade 1 or 2  diarrhea, early intervention should include continuation of 
erlotinib at the current dose and initiation of loperamide therapy as described in 
Table 3.  Grade 2 diarrhea that persists over 48 hours, despi[INVESTIGATOR_115116], should be managed by  [CONTACT_632268] 
3.  Patients experiencing Grade 3 diarrhea should interrupt erlotinib until 
resolution to Grade 
 1 and re -start at one dose level reduction according to Table 
3.  Patients should be maintained at the reduced dos e without attempt at dose re -
escalation .  Patients experiencing Grade 4 diarrhea should be discontinued from 
study treatment.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pulmonary  
 
Although quite rare, ILD can be life threatening.  Therefore, patients should be 
monitored closely for symptom s consistent with ILD, such as new onset dyspnea 
without an obvious cause.  In the event that ILD is suspected, erlotinib treatment 
should be interrupted and the patient should receive appropriate medical 
evaluation.   Although there is no proven therapy, systemic corticosteroids are 
often provided.  Erlotinib should not be restarted in those patients suspected of 
having drug -related ILD.  See Table 3 for management guidelines, including 
erlotinib dose interruption.   If diagnosed with ILD, the patient will be removed 
from the study.

7. 0 Concomitant and Excluded Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_632235]-neoplastic or anti -tumor agents not part of the study therapy, including 
chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, and hormonal anticancer therapy, is not 
permitted while participating in this study.  
 
Use of concur rent investigational agents is not permitted.  
 
There are potential interactions between erlotinib and CYP3A4 inhibitors and CYP3A4 
promoters.  Although caution and careful monitoring are recommended when use of these 
compounds is necessary, use of these co mpounds does not exclude patients from participating in 
this trial (see Appendix C for a list of CYP3A4 inhibitors /inducers ). 
 
Grapefruit juice is a CYP3A4 inhibitor, therefore, consumption of grapefruit  or grapefruit  juice 
should be avoided during erlotin ib treatment.  
 
Patients who are taking erlotinib with an inhibitor of both CTP3A4 and CYP1A2 like 
ciprofloxacin, a dose reduction of erlotinib should be considered if severe adverse reactions 
occur.   
 
The solubility of erlotinib  is pH dependent.  Erlotini b solubility decreases as pH increas es. Co -
administration of erlotinib  with omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, decreased the exposure of 
erlotinib  (AUC) by 46% and the maximum concentration (C max) by 61%.  There was no change

FER-TH-[ADDRESS_844159] of  histamine 2 receptor blockers (H2 blockers) or proton 
pump inhibitors in patients receiving erlotnib . However, no clinical study has been conducted to 
evaluate the effect of antacids on erlotinib pharmacokinetics. If an antacid is necessary, the 
antacid d ose and the erlotnib  dose should be separated by [CONTACT_342912].  
 
The exposure to erlotinib  (AUC) increased to a moderate extent, by 39%, and the maximum 
concentration (C max) by 17%, when erlotinib  was co -administered with ciprofloxacin, an 
inhibitor of bot h CYP3A4 and CYP1A2.  Patients who are taking erlotinib with an inhibitor of 
both CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 like ciprofloxiacin, a dose reduction of erlotinib should be 
considered if severe adverse reactions occur.  
 
Erlotinib  clearance can be induced by [CONTACT_632269] a CYP1A2 induction. Potential drug -drug 
interaction is expected when erlotinib  is taken with CYP1A2 inducers or inhibitors.  Patients 
who continue to smoke may be under dosed when treated with the current approved Tarceva 
dosage of 150mg, therefore, patien ts should be advised to stop smoking.   
 
International normalized ratio (INR) elevations and/or bleeding events have been reported in 
some cancer patients taking warfarin while on erlotinib.  Patients taking warfarin -derivative 
anticoagulants should be mon itored regularly for changes in prothrombin time or INR . 
 
Low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] ( ≤ 325 mg/d) may be continued in subjects at higher risk for arterial 
thromboembolic disease. Subjects developi[INVESTIGATOR_366890] 1, Bevacizumab Dose

Treatment with hormones or other chemotherapeutic agents will result in the patient’s removal 
from the study, except for steroids administered for adrenal failure, septic shock, or as 
temporizing measure for symptomatic pain or breathing, rash, or at the treating physician’s 
discretion for symptom management, or hormones administered for non -disease related 
conditions, e.g., insulin for diabetes.  Glucocorticosteroids may be used as antiemetics and 
megestrol acetate may be use d for appetite.  
 
Patients should receive full supportive care including transfusions of blood and blood products, 
antibiotics, antiemetics, etc., when appropriate.  The use of erythropoietin (i.e., Epogen, Procrit)  
is permitted.

Subjects who discontinue study treatment should  be seen and assessed by [CONTACT_2413](s). The 
reason for withdrawal and the dat e of withdrawal must be documented.  If possible, any diary 
cards, questionnaires (e.g. for Quality of Life assessments) and investigational products

If the reason for withdrawal from the trial is the death of the subject, the two  options for 
categorizing withdrawal are either progressive disease  or an adverse event (AE); more than one 
AE may be documented as a reason for withdrawal.  Only one event will be captured as the 
cause of death.  Note that death is an outcome and not an AE.  
 
All deaths that occur within the trial period or within [ADDRESS_844163] be reported primarily for the purposes of serious adverse event (SAE) 
reporting; however, deaths due unequivocally to progression are not SAE's.  
 
All subjects who have new or worsening CTC grade [ADDRESS_844164]’s medical records.  Laboratory 
abnormalities should not be reported as serious adverse events unless any criterion for a SAE is 
fulfilled, the laboratory abnormality causes the subject to discontinue from the study, or the 
investigator insists the abnormality should be reported as an attributable AE. At withdrawal all 
on-going study -related toxicities and SAEs must be followed unti l resolution, unless in the 
investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the condition is unlikely to resolve due to the subject’s underlying 
disease.

10.0 Data Safety Monitoring Plan   
 
All adverse events will be summarized 1) without regard to causal relationship and 2) by [CONTACT_632277], based on the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649].  Worst toxicity grades per 
patient will be tabulated for selected adverse events and laboratory measurements.  Any serious 
adverse e vent or adverse event resulting in premature and permanent discontinuation of any 
study drug will be described in detail.  
 
Adverse events and other symptoms will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adv erse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0.  
 
A Data Safety Monitoring Plan has been implemented to monitor safety parameters during the 
 
Copyright© 2012 Fox Chase Cancer Center ® Extramural Resea rch Program.  All rights reserved.  
FER-TH-[ADDRESS_844167] and 
identify any protocol violations and unre ported adverse events in a timely manner.  Any events 
determined to be significant will be reported immediately to the principal investigator.  FER 
administrative staff will review data every six months with the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_28677].  Dat a will be collected from individual case report forms  (CRF)  once the CRFs have 
been monitored  and all queries are resolved.  The semiannual review will include complete 
accrual listing demographic information, response, toxicity tables, and summaries of in cidence 
severity and resolution of adverse events, including laboratory results abnormalities, summary of 
any pertinent findings from monitoring/auditing visits and a description of all known or 
suspected protocol violations.  
 
Each participating practice m ust designate a single on -site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_632236].  This site specific principal investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_632237].  SAEs experienced by a subject participating in a clinical trial 
must be reported according to section 13.[ADDRESS_844168] the study as 
appropriate.  
 
FER will manage the flow of documents to participating sites and external agencies (including 
reports of serious adverse events) to facilit ate ongoing and timely review of the protocol.  FER 
will monitor the medical and study records of each participant accrued at each site throughout 
the course of the study.  All serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reviewed on a real time basis 
first by [CONTACT_3433] e site PI [INVESTIGATOR_632238]. Borghaei.  Regular teleconferences may be conducted 
with all principal investigators or their designees.  During these meetings, the participants will 
review documents summarizing baseline demographic characteristics, rete ntion and disposition 
of participants, QA issues, regulatory issues, AEs and SAEs, and efficacy (response rates, time -
to-progression).  FER will supplement these meetings with routine written summary updates 
which will be distributed to the participating s ites. 
 
Grade [ADDRESS_844169] be reported to FER within 24 hours of awareness of the 
event (please refer to section 13).  FER will report this information immediately to the principal 
investigator, and appropriate regulatory authorities.  Pa rticipating  site PIs  will be notified 
according to section 13.0 .

11.1 Primary endpoint:  Progression Free Survival  
 
PFS will be the primary endpoint. We will test  the null hypothesis that median PFS is [ADDRESS_844170] 90% power and 5% type I error for a study of 
33 evaluable patient s accrued over a period of 24 months and followed for an additional 12 
months. Follow up on all patients for progression and survival will continue until death.  
 
Toxicity is monitored for possible early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. If, at any point in time 5 patients experie nce 
attributable DLTs (DLT defined in section 5.2) among the first [ADDRESS_844171] 30% then the chance of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_632239] 61% and the chance of declaring the treatment too toxic is at least 84%. If the chance of 
DLT is at most 15% then the chance of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], in error, is 9.9% and the overall type I 
error is 15.5%. Early  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], here, does not mean that accrual is stopped until the first [ADDRESS_844172] 20% versus the alternative that it is at least 35%. A one -sided test based 
on the exponential distribution of survival time will have 86% power and 10% type I error to 
make this distinction.

12.0     Efficacy Measurement   
 
12.1 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)  
 
The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria will be used for objective 
tumor response assessment.  See Appendix A for the timing of  the assessments.   
 
12.1.1  Definitions  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) Committee36.  
Changes in only the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions 
are used in the RECIST criteria.  Note: Lesions are either measurable or non -measurable 
using the criteria provided below.  The term “evaluable”  in reference to measurability 
will not be used because it does not provide additional meaning or accuracy.  
 
12.1.[ADDRESS_844175] one 
dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >20 mm with conventional techniques 
(CT, MRI, x -ray) or as >[ADDRESS_844176] be 
recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
12.1.3  Non-measurable disease  
 
All other lesions (or site s of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <20 mm 
with conventional techniques or <[ADDRESS_844177] scan), are considered non -
measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusions, lymphangitis  cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses 
(not followed by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions are all non -measurable.  
 
12.1.4  Target lesions  
 
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, 
representative  of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded 
and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size 
(lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated 
 
Copyright© 2012 Fox Chase Cancer Center ® Extramural Resea rch Program.  All rights reserved.  
FER-TH-007 Amendment 4   October 1, 2012  47 measurements  (either by [CONTACT_14217]). A sum of the longest diameter 
(LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD. The 
baseline sum LD will be used as reference by [CONTACT_204667].  
 
12.1.5  Non-target lesions  
 
All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and 
should also be recorded at baseline. Non -target lesions include measurable lesions that 
exceed the maximum numbers per organ or total o f all involved organs as well as non -
measurable lesions. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence or 
absence of each should be noted throughout follow -up.

12.3 Response Criteria  
 
12.3.1  Evaluation of target lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions  
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) 
of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD  
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or 
the appearance of one or more ne w lesions  
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment 
started  
 
12.3.2  Evaluation of non -target lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization 
of tumor marker level  
Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (SD):  Persistence of one or more non -target 
lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits  
 
Copyright© 2012 Fox Chase Cancer Center ® Extramural Resea rch Program.  All rights reserved.  
FER-TH-007 Amendment 4   October 1, 2012  48 Progressive Disease (PD ): Appearance  of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non -target lesions  
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, in such 
circumstances the opi[INVESTIGATOR_13387], and  the progression 
status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_978].  
 
12.3.[ADDRESS_844179] response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as refe rence for progressive disease the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response 
assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation 
criteria.

Note:  Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be 
classified as having “symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to 
document the objective progression, even after discontinuation of treatm ent. 
In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal 
tissue.  When the evaluation of complete response depends on this determination, it is 
recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/bi opsy) before 
confirming the complete response status.  
 
12.4 Confirmatory Measurement/Duration of Response  
 
12.4.[ADDRESS_844180] be confirmed 
by [CONTACT_3611] 4 weeks after the criteria for 
 
Copyright© 2012 Fox Chase Cancer Center ® Extramural Resea rch Program.  All rights reserved.  
FER-TH-[ADDRESS_844181] once after study entry at a minimum interval of 6 weeks . 
 
12.4.2  Duration of overall response  
 
The duration o f overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met 
for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive 
disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the 
small est measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met 
for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.  
Upon the subject’s withdrawal, the  investigator should assign an overall best response for 
the subject based on the definitions given in Appendix and his or her clinical judgment.  
 
12.4.[ADDRESS_844182] was known to be alive.  
 
12.4.5  Time to Progression  
 
Time to Progression (TTP):  will be assessed from the start of study treatment to the date 
when objective disease progression is observed.  Death will be regarded as a progression 
event in those subjects who die before disease progression.  Subjects without documented 
objective progression at the time of the final analysis will be censored at the date of their 
last tumor assessment.   
 
12.[ADDRESS_844183] be assessed for response to treatment, even if there are 
major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible.  Each patient will be assigned one of 
the following categories: 1) complete  response, 2) partial response, 3) stable disease, 4) 
progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) early 
death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, insufficient data).  ( Note : By 
[CONTACT_632278] c onvention, category 9 usually designates the “unknown” status of any type of data in a 
clinical database).  
 
All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria should be included in the main analysis of the 
response rate.  Patients in response categories 4-9 should be considered as failing to respond to 
treatment (disease progression).  Thus an incorrect treatment schedule or drug administration 
 
Copyright© 2012 Fox Chase Cancer Center ® Extramural Resea rch Program.  All rights reserved.  
FER-TH-[ADDRESS_844184] been identified (e.g., early death due to o ther reasons, 
early discontinuation of treatment, major protocol violations, etc).  However, these sub -analyses 
may not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions concerning treatment efficacy, and the 
reasons for excluding patients from the analysis shoul d be clearly reported.  The 95% confidence 
intervals should be provided.  
 
12.6     Patient -Reported Outcomes (PROs)  
 
The methods for collecting subject/Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) data are p resented below.  
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Lung, Version 4 (FACT -L v. 4) (secondary 
endpoint)  
 
12.6.1      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -Lung (FACT -L)(Appendix G)  
 
Methods of Assessment  
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Lung, Version 4 (FACT -L v. 4) will be 
utilized for each patient prior to the start of therapy , on the first day of every other cycle , 
for the first [ADDRESS_844185] -L administration to a specific 
individual (e.g., a  Research Nurse).  The Fox Chase Cancer Center Extramural Research 
Program (FER) will provide training for relevant personnel in the administration of the 
FACT -L to help avoid the key problem of missing data.  It is also important that the 
significance and  relevance of the data are explained carefully to participating subjects so 
that they are motivated to comply with data collection37. 
The date of compl etion of each FACT -L should be documented.  
The instructions for completion of the FACT -L are: 
 
 It must be completed in private by [CONTACT_632279], friends or clinic staff  
 Only one answer to each question should be recorded  
 Immediately following completion of FACT -L, the Research Nurse or appointed 
individual must collect and review the FACT -L for completeness.  If items are 
missed, the form must be returned to the subject immediately for completion.  
 
 
Copyright© 2012 Fox Chase Cancer Center ® Extramural Resea rch Program.  All rights reserved.  
FER-TH-[ADDRESS_844186] -L will be collected. We will assess patient -specific changes over time 
based on the 7 item lung cancer subscale (LCS) and treatment outcome index (TOI) 
composed of the sum of physical well - being (PWB), functional well -being (FWB), and 
LCS scores . 
 
12.6.3  Procedure for Missing Data  
 
For each subscale, if less than 50% of subscale item s are missing, the subscale score will 
be divided by [CONTACT_154562] -missing items and multiplied by [CONTACT_632280].  Hence, missing data will be imputed.  If at least 50% of the items 
are missing, that subscale also will be tr eated as missing.  The reason for any missing 
data will be identified.  If data are missing at random, the above techniques will be used.  
If there is evidence that the missing data is systematic, missing values will be imputed to 
ensure that any possible bias is minimized.   
 
13.[ADDRESS_844187].   
 
Calculation or derivation of ou tcome variables  
Any new conditions reported during the study will be documented as an AE.  Only those 
findings that are in addition to the condition being treated will be documented a s AEs, see 
Section 13 for recording of AEs.  
 
If the patient is withdrawn from the trial due to death, the two  options for categorizing 
withdrawal are either progressive disease or an adverse event (AE); more than one AE may be 
documented as a reason for w ithdrawal).  Only one event will be captured as the cause of death.  
Note that death is an outcome and not an AE.  
 
All deaths that occur within the trial period or within [ADDRESS_844188] be reported primari ly for the purposes of serious adverse event (SAE) 
reporting; however, deaths due unequivocally to progression are not SAE's.  
 
Investigators are required to report to FER serious adverse event (SAE) as soon as 
possible.   
 
13.1 Adverse Event (AE) Definitio ns 
 
Adverse Event (AE)  is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or 
procedure rega rdless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure 
(NCI CTEP Guidelines January 2001) . 
 
 
Copyright© 2012 Fox Chase Cancer Center ® Extramural Resea rch Program.  All rights reserved.  
FER-TH-007 Amendment 4   October 1, 2012  52 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is any sign, symptom or medical condition that emerges during 
protocol treatment or during a post -treatment f ollow -up period  that (1) was not present at the 
start of study treatment and it is not a chronic condition that is part of the patient’s medical 
history, OR (2) was present at the start of study treatment or as part of the patient’s medical 
history but wor sened in severity and/or frequency during therapy, AND that meets any of the 
following regulatory serious criteria:  
 
 Results in death  
 Is life -threatening  
 Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_632240] a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Is medically significant or requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.  
 
13.1.1  Severity Ratings  The investigator will evaluate the severity of each adverse  
event.  NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Eve nts Version 3.0 will be used to 
capture adverse events.  Severity is expressed in numerical grade using the following 
definitions if the AE is not clearly specified in the CTC  
 
Grade 1:  Mild -noticeable to the patient, does not interfere with the patient’s daily activities, 
usually does not require additional therapy, dose reduction, or discontinuation of the study 
drug.  
Grade 2:  Moderate -interferes with the patient’s daily activities, possibly requires additional 
therapy, but does not require discontinuatio n of study drug.  
Grade 3:  Severe -severely limits the patient’s daily activities and may require discontinuation 
of the study drug.  
Grade 4:  Life-threatening or disabling  
Grade 5:  Fatal  
 
13.1.2  Relationship to Study Drug/Attribution  
 
Definite  –clearly rela ted 
Probably Related -the event occurs within a reasonable time period following drug 
administration or follows a known response for the drug and cannot be reasonably explained 
by [CONTACT_632281] (including use of concomitant medications).  
Possible  –may be related  
Unlikely  –doubtfully related  
Definitely Not Related  - the event is not known to be caused by [CONTACT_5257].  
Expected Adverse Event  is one where the specificity or severity is consistent with the 
current information available from the  resources.  
Unexpected Adverse Event  is one not identified in nature, severity, or frequency in the 
Investigator’s Brochure or the product package insert for the study drug.

FER-TH-007 Amendment 4   October 1, 2012  53 13.2.  Investigator Reporting Responsibilities:  
 
1. Upon identification of an AE , the investigator will utilize the above definitions to properly 
classify the event.  Each category listed above must be recorded for each event.  
 
2. Assessing Causality:  
Investigators are required to assess whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study 
treatment caused or contributed to an adverse event.   The following general guidance may be 
used.  
 Yes:    if the temporal relationship of the clinical event to study drug administration 
makes a causal relationship possible, and other drugs, thera peutic interventions or 
underlying conditions do not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
 No:       if the temporal relationship of the clinical event to study drug administration 
makes a causal relationship unlikely, or other drugs, th erapeutic interventions or 
underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
 
3. All AEs and SAEs will be recorded in the case report forms on the “AE/Toxicity Form” with 
details about the grade and attribution of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  T he action taken with respect to the 
study drug and the patient’s outcome should be recorded in the remarks section of the 
“Treatment Flow Sheet”.  All events will be recorded on case report forms each cycle until 
they resolve.  
 
4. All SAEs will be recorded on  “FDA Form 3500 MedWatch” and faxed to the Office of 
Extramural Research (FER) Study Manager at [ADDRESS_844189] medication information, the report 
should include the following information within the Event Description of the MedWatch 
3500 form:  
 
 Treatment regi men (dosing frequency, combination therapy , lot numbers ) 
 Protocol description (and number, if assigned)  
 Description of event, severity, treatment, and outcome, if known  
 Supportive laboratory results and diagnostics  
 Investigator’s assessment of the relation ship of the adverse event to each investigational 
product and suspect medication  
 
5.  Follow -up information:   
Additional information may be added to a previously submitted report by [CONTACT_51756]:  
 Adding to the original MedWatch [ADDRESS_844190]

 Expected Event: Grade 4 -5 regardless of attribution requires report to FER by 
[CONTACT_648]/fax/e -mail within [ADDRESS_844193] for whom an adverse event was reported.  
 
13.2.1  FER Respons ibilities  
 
1. Any serious or unexpected adverse event that is possibly, probably or definitely related to 
the study will be reported in writing to FER who will submit to Genentech  and 
voluntarily to the FDA  within 5 working days of notification of the even t.  Death from 
any cause will be reported immediately to Genentech and participating sites.  The report 
will be distributed to all investigative sites within 15 working days of notification of the 
event for review by [CONTACT_632282]  
 
2. If the results of an investigator or FER investigation show an adverse event not initially 
determined to be reportable is so reportable, FER will report the event following the 
above guidelines based on the date the determination is made.  
 
3. FER will track all serious  events and report them routinely to the Principal Investigator

Procedure for Obtaining a Urine Protein / Creatinine Ratio  
 
1)  Obtain at least 4 ml of a random urine sample (does not h ave to be a 24 hour urine)  
2)  Determine protein concentration (mg/dL)  
3)  Determine creatinine concentration (mg/dL)  
4)  Divide #2 by #3 above:       urine protein / creatinine ratio =  protein concentration (mg /dL) / 
creatinine concentration (mg /dL)  
 
The UPC directly correlates with the amount of protein excreted in the urine per 24 hrs (i.e. a 
UPC of 1 should be equivalent to 1g protein in a 24hr urine collection)  
Protein and creatinine concentrations should be available on standard reports of urinaly ses, not 
dipsticks. If protein and creatinine concentrations are not routinely reported at an Institution, 
their measurements and reports may need to be requested.

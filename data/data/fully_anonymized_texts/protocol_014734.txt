Title
A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_487231]-ESO -1 Specific NY-ESO -1(c259) T cells in 
HLA -A2+ Patients with Synovial Sarcoma
Background
Patients with unresectable, metastatic and recurrent synovial sarcomas have long-term survival 
rates of <30%.  C ytotoxic chemother apy has not significantl y improved survival for this high -risk 
group of patients.
A recent study  (Robbins 2011) conducted b y the NCI  Surgery  Branch demonstrated that adoptive 
immunotherapy  using T cells geneticall y engineered to recognize NY-ESO -1 followin g 
lymphodepletion led to objective antitumor responses in four out of six patients with recurrent, 
metastatic sy novial sarcoma.
Objectives
Primary :
Determine the response rate in patients with unresectable, metastatic or recurrent s ynovial 
sarcoma treated with lymphodepletion and Treg depletion followed by [CONTACT_487289] T cells engineered to recognize an HLA -A2 restricted NY-ESO -1 
derived peptide (Cohort 1).
Determine the response rate and duration of response of adoptive immunotherap y with 
NY-ESO -1c259T cells in patients with synovial sarcoma and low-level expression of 
NY-ESO -1 (Cohort 2).
Determine the response rate and duration of response of adoptive immunotherap y with 
NY-ESO -1c259T cells in patients with synovial sarcoma treated with a lymphodepleting 
regimen containing cy clophosphamide as a single cytotoxic agent (Cohort 3).
Determine the response rate and duration of response of adoptive immunotherap y with 
NY-ESO -1c259T cells in patients with synovial sarcoma treated with a lymphodepleti ng 
regimen containing cyclophosphamide and fludarabine cytotoxic agents at reduced total 
doses relative to Cohort 1 (Cohort 4).
Secondary :
Determine the safet y of treatment with adoptivel y transferred NY -ESO -1c259T. 
When possible, assess whether patients with progressive disease following NY-ESO -1c259T 
or who do not respond (Cohort 3 and 4 ) experience a response following a second dose.
Exploratory :
Evaluate persistence, phenoty pe and functionality  of adoptively  transferred 
NY-ESO -1c259T and correlate with clinical responses. 
Evaluate mechanisms of resistance and sensitivity to NY -ESO -1c259T.
Evaluate antigen spreading as a mechanism of response.

Design
Patients will undergo apheresis at the enrolling institution.  PBMC swill be shipped to a central 
manufacturer for gene transduction, activation and expansion, then cryopreserved and shipped 
back to the enrolling institution.
Patients will undergo lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide with or without fludarabine as 
outlined in the Treatment Schema .  Patients will receive transduced NY-ESO -1c259T.  Cell doses 
are specified in Section 3.2.7
The trial seeks to enroll up to 20 patients into Cohort 1 and up to 15 patients each into Cohorts 2 -
4. See Section 3.2and Section 6.
Cohort 1: Complete .  Patients must have proven positive, high tumor expression of NY -
ESO -1 defined as 2+ or 3+ by [CONTACT_9064]  (IHC) in ≥ 50% cells.  Patients 
receive Regimen A lymphodepletion .

positive, high tumor expression of NY -ESO -1 defined as 2+ or 3+ by  [CONTACT_188029] ≥ 50% cells.  
Patients receive Regimen B lymphodepletion . 
Note: If insufficient activity  is seen using cyclophosphamide -only lymphodepletion in 
cohort 3 and in combination with data across the Sponsor program using this regimen , 
Cohort 3 will cease enrolli ng and close .  Patients previously  eligible for Cohort 3 will be 
enrolled to Cohort 4 .  Cohort 4 is now open as Cohort 3 is closed .  See Section 3.2.3
Cohort 4: Closed to enrollment .  Up to [ADDRESS_626231]

Note : If insufficient activity  is seen using reduced dose Regimen C lymphodepletion in 
Cohort 4, the cohort will cease enrolling and close.  The decision will be based on clinical 
judgment .  If the anti -tumor activity  with Regimen C is det ermined to be suboptimal, then 
future subjects enrolled in Cohort 4 will receive Regimen A. See Section 3.2.4 .
Patients ≥40kg will receive the minimum cell dose of at least 1x109transduced NY-ESO -1c259T
cells with a maximum of 6x109transduced cells.  The target dose for this protocol is 5x109
trans duced NY-ESO -1c259T cells .  If the transduced cell dose is less than the minimum dose, 
manufacturing of additional transduced T -cells from excess banked leukapheresis product will be 
undertaken to achieve a total dose in the 1 x 109–6 x 109range.
Patients <40 kgwill bedosedper body  weight with a minimum 0.025x109transduced cells/ kg, 
with a target dose of 0.125x109transduced cells/k g.  
Patients will be monitored for toxicity , antitumor effects and immune endpoints.
Patients who have a confirmed response, or have stable disease for >[ADDRESS_626232] treatment .  Patients in Cohort 3 and 4 who do not show a response 
to treatment may receive a second dose of NY-ESO -1c259T using Regimen Alymphodepletion .

1.3 Background and Rationale
1.3.1 Synovial Sarcoma
Synovial sarcomas account for approximately  6%–10% of all soft tissue sarcomas .  Approximately  
33% of synovial sarcomas occur in childhood, and approximately  20-25% of non-
rhabdom yosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas occurring in childhood are synovial sa rcomas.  The peak 
incidence is in the third decade of life, and approximately  70% of patients with sy novial sarcoma 
are less than 40 years of age.  Thus sy novial sarcoma is primarily  a disease of children and young 
adults (Herzog 2005) . 
The most common primary site for synovial sarcoma is the distal lower extremity  (63%) with a 
tendency  for primary  tumors to develop near the knee or ankle.  Synovial sarcomas also often

Page 20of 100present as painless masses in the upper extremity , head, neck and trunk.  The lungs are a common 
site for distant metastases, occurring in 6% of patients in a recent series (Ferrari 2004) .  Synovial 
sarcoma metastasizes to the lymph nodes more frequentl y than most sarcomas, with clinicall y 
evident ly mph node metastases reported in 14- 20% of c ases (Tunn 2008) . 
Histologicall y, synovial sarcoma consistentl y demonstrates a spi[INVESTIGATOR_487235], and a variable epi[INVESTIGATOR_487236].  Tumors comprised exclusively  of the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_487237], whereas those comprised of spi[INVESTIGATOR_487238] .  Immunohistochemistry  typi[INVESTIGATOR_487239]. 
A patho gnomonic chromosomal translocation between chromosome X and 18is found in virtually  
all cases of synovial sarcoma.  The translocation involves theSYTgene at 18q11 and the SSX1, 
SSX2, or SSX4 gene at Xp11 (Clark 1994; de Leeuw 1995; Crew 1995) .  The fusion transcript is 
found in both the spi[INVESTIGATOR_487240].  There is no clear evidence that the fusion 
partner effects prognosis, but the fusion partner does have aclear impact on histology  and 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] , because essentially  all SYT-SSX2+tumors are monophasic (Kawai 1998) and there 
is an even male -to-female ratio for SYT -SSX1 but a 1:2 ratio for SYT-SSX2.  Haldar et al. modeled 
synovial sarcoma in mice by [CONTACT_487295]-SSX translocation in myoblasts (Haldar 2007) .  
The fusion protein was oncogenic only when expressed in myoblasts, but not when expressed
earlier or later in my ogenesis, suggesting that the myoblast may bethe cell of origin (Davis 2007) .  
Interestingly , even in mouse model of synovial sarcoma, the majorit y of tumors occur near a joint, 
suggesting that microenvironmental factors in this area are uniquel y suited to support growth of 
SYT -SSX tumors.
Like all soft tissue sarcomas, therap y for s ynovial sarcoma is largel y focused on surgical excision 
with wide margins.  Indeed, synovial sarcoma does not appear to be curable without complete 
surgical excision and very  few patients with distant metastases or recurrent sy novial sarcoma are 
cured with standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], regardless of the administration of chemotherap y (discussed below).  
Microscopic or macroscopic residual tumor is consistently  an adverse prognostic factor (Andrass y 
2002; Andrassy  2001), therefore, excisions with margins <3 cm should be considered for second 
excision if possible without severe functional limitation.   Tumor size is an important prognostic 
factor as well.  The 5-year event -free survival rate was 66% in 86 patients with <5 cm sized SS 
treated in Milan compared with a rate of 24% for synovial sarcoma >5 cm2.  Adjuvant radiation 
therap y to 50-70 Gy provides a benefit in terms of thelocal control for patients with synovial 
sarcoma (Okcu 2001) .  As a result, adjuvant radiation therapy  is often recommended for sy novial 
sarcomas >5 cmin maximal diameter (Wolden 2005) .  In summary , size of tumor (>5 cm), axial 
location, high grade (grade 3), invasiveness of tumor, and detection of distant metastases are poor 
prognostic factors (Ferrari 2004; Okcu 2003; Ferrari 2008; Sultan 2009; Canter 2008) .
Neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherap y for synovial sarcoma remains an area of controvers y.  
Compared with other spi[INVESTIGATOR_487241], synovial sarcoma appears to be somewhat more 
chemosensitive, with objective responses to chemotherap y reported in 40%–60% (Ferrari 2004; 
Pappo 2005).  Prior to the initiation of the EPSSG NRSTS trials, all pediatric patients with synovial 
sarcoma enrolled in European trials received chemotherap yregardless of stage, with the same 
regimen used for rhabdomy osarcoma.  A  r etrospective study  of this cohort that sought to 
investigate the potential impact of cy totoxic chemotherap y in this disease reported longer survival 
for children receiving adjuvant chemotherap y when tumors were >5 cm and high grade (Ferrar i

Page 21of 1002004), but no difference in survival with adjuvant chemotherapy  in patients with smaller tumors 
or low grade tumors.  Similarly , a multicenter, multivariate review ofpediatric synovial sarcoma 
patients by [CONTACT_487296]. revealed that chemotherap yresponses resulted in longer survival in clinical 
group III patie nts(Okcu 2003).  Thus, although randomized studies have not been undertaken, 
most pediatric oncologists recommend neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherap y for children with 
high-risk s ynovial sarcoma.  High -risk is typi[INVESTIGATOR_487242] -grade histology  and size >5 cm 
or axial primary , or metastatic disease.
Some recent non- randomized anal yses of adult patients with sy novial sarcomas >5 cm also report 
a survival advantage for patients treated with ifosfamide -containing regimens (Cant er 2008; Eilber 
2007) .  However, other reviews of sy novial sarcoma in adults have not shown a positive effect of 
chemotherap y(Palmerini 2009) .  In a non- randomized study  from Milan, chemotherap y appeared 
to improve survival in sy novial sarcoma, regardless of size, for y ounger patients (0–16 years old), 
but did improve overall survival rates in patients >17 years old, suggesting that age may influence
clinical behavior of synovial sarcoma (Ferrari 2004) .  Indeed, differences in the 5-year survival 
curves for pediatric synovial sarcoma (60%–83%) versus adult synovial sarcoma (50% –70%) 
suggest that older age itself may  be an adverse risk factor (Sultan 2009; Palmerini 2009) .  This is 
not likely  accounted for by [CONTACT_487297] y, since a SEER analysis 
showed that the0-to 9-year-old age group had better outcomes than the 10-to 18-year-old age 
group, who were likely  to have been treated in a similar fashion (Sultan 2009).  Similar adverse 
effects of age on prognosis are seen in Ewing’s sarcoma, although the basis for this remains unclear 
and there are no known age associated biologic differences in s ynovial sarcoma.  
In summary , the consensus regarding chemotherapy  is not clear for adult patients with high-risk 
synovial sarcoma, but it is clear that unresectable, metastatic and recurrent sy novial sarcomas are 
nearl y universall y fatal.  Thus, new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_487243] -risk features. 
1.3.2 Adoptive Im munotherapy with NY- ESO -1 Specific T Cells in Synovial Sarcoma
NY-ESO -1 is a member of the cancer -testis family  of tumor antigens.  NY -ESO -1 is expressed in 
approximately  70-80% of cases of synovial sarcoma, reportedly  at high levels.  Scanlan et al (2002) 
reported that in synovial sarcoma 16/ 21 specimens showed diffuse homogeneous staining but in 
5 specimens (23%) this was heterogeneous. Lai et al (2012) evaluated NY-ESO -1 expression by 
[CONTACT_487298] 417 tumors including 50 stage IV synovial sarcomas and reported that 
38/ 50 (76%) expressed NY-ESO -1 in a strong and diffuse pattern (2-3+, >50–70% of tumor cells), 
3 cases showed weak and focal expression (1+ <10% tumor cells) and 9 cases were negative for 
NY-ESO -1.  Endo et al (2015) reported NY-ESO -1 staining intensity  of 2 – 3+ by 
[CONTACT_389860] >50% of tumor cells in 34/69 (49.3%) s ynovial sarcomas.  
An HLA-A2 binding peptide corresponding to amino acids 157 to 165 of NY-ESO-1 
(SLLMWITQC) can be recognized by [CONTACT_487299]-ESO -1 reactive T cells (Zeng 2002) and NY-ESO -1 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_487244] (Jager
1998; Jager 2000).  Several studies have demonstrated antibodies against NY-ESO -[ADDRESS_626236] this antigen (Gnjatic 2006), suggesting that among tumor associated 
antigens, NY-ESO -[ADDRESS_626237] been observed in a small percentage of patients treated 
with NY- ESO -1 vaccin es alone (Bioley  2009; Old 2008) .

PHOTOCOPYDate [ADDRESS_626238] the 
SLLMW ITQC peptide bound to HL A-A2.  The result is a high affinity T cell receptor designated 
as 1G4a95:LY TCR (c259 TCR) , which shows pre-clinical activity  in vitro and in vivo against 
NY-ESO -1 expressing HLA -A2+ tumors (Robbins 2008).  The 1G4a95:L Y TCR mediates 
efficient recognition by [CONTACT_398]8+ T cells of the HLA -A2 bound peptide 157-165 and also mediates 
sufficient avidit y to render CD4+ T cells capable of recognizing the 157-165 peptide in the context 
of HLA -A2(Robbins 2008) .  This co-receptor independent recognition implies high avidity of the 
1G4a95:LY TCR , a potentially  important property  of clinically  active T cell receptors .  The 
enhanced TCR binds with varying affinity  to HLA -A2 subty pes.  There is not much data evaluating 
the TCR in subty pes other than HLA -A201, but binding affinities are similar for HLA -A201 and 
HLA -A205, whereas binding to HLA -A206 is much higher.  
Between 2008 and 2010 a clinical trial of adoptive immunotherap y following lymphodepletion 
using T cells expressing IG4a95:LY TCR was carried out in the Surgery  Branch of the National 
Cancer Institute.  Patients with NY -ESO -[ADDRESS_626239] therapy  were 
eligible
Patients with HLA-A2+, NY-ESO -1 synovial sarcomas and melanomas underwent apheresis for 
collection of mononuclear cells.  They then received lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide (60 
mg/kg/d x2) and fludarabine (25mg/m2/d x 5).  PBMC were treated with anti-CD3 antibody  and 
transduced with a retrovirus encoding 1G4a95:LY TCR.  A  s econdary T cell expansion was 
carried out with anti-CD3 antibody , and a median of 5x1010T cells were generated for therapy  
(range 1.6 x 109– 13 x 1010; approximately  1.9 x 109/kg-2.2 x 108/kg).  A median of 78% (range 
63-87%) of the transferred CD8+ T cells and 65% (range 57 -79%) of the transferred CD4+ T cells 
bound theNY-ESO -1 tetramer, and median of 92% (range 85-96%) of the total CD3+ T cells 
bound ananti-BV13.1 antibody , which binds the beta chain on the genetically  transduced TCR.  
With the exception of one patient, the cell infusions were comprised of >67% CD8+ T cells.  
Lower, but substantial levels, also bound the NY-ESO -1 tetramer and all of the products 
recognized peptide pulsed target cells at concentration of 0.1-0.01 nM of NY-ESO -1:157 -165. 
NY-ESO -1 specific T cells were infused after conditioning, then high dose IL2 was administered 
every  8 hours to tolerance (Robbins 2011; Robbins 201 5).
The cell dose for the initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]  (Cohort 1)of [COMPANY_004] 208466 ( ADP -[ZIP_CODE] )protocol was 
chosen to largel y replicate the doses administered in the Robbins et al study (Robbins 2011) .  The 
4 patients with synovial sarcoma in thatstudy  who had clinical responses following treatment with 
NY-ESO -1 specific T cells received absolute doses ranging from 16-83 x 109cells.  Assuming  
average weights of 70 kg, this translates to a dose of 0.2 -1 x 109/kg.  No toxicity  attributed to the 
cells was reported in thatstudy  and thegoal in the current study  is to replicate the cell product as 
close lyas possible.  Therefore, a target dose of 5x109transduced cells was chosen with a minimum 
of 1x109transduced cells and a maximum overall dose of 6x109cells as it falls closely  within the 
cell dose where clinical responses without significant toxicity  were observed.  
A recent update to the study reported 11 of 18 patients (61%) with synovial sarcoma and 11 of 20 
patients (55%) with melanoma demonstrated objective clinical responses .  The estimated overall 
three and five year survival rates for patients with synovial cell sarcoma were 38% and 14%, 
respectivel y, while the corresponding estimated survival rates for patients with melanoma were 
both 33% (Robbins 2015).

As of February  2017, 36 patients were enrolled.  15 of these patients were enrolled in Cohort 1 
(completed enrolment) ,5 patients in Cohort 3 (completed enrollment) and [ADDRESS_626240] been enrolled 
in Cohorts where enrolment is on going ( 6 subjects in Cohort 2 and 10 subjects in Cohort 4).  
The following is a brief s ummary  of Cohort 1.  Patients with unresectable, metastatic or recurrent 
synovial sarcoma underwent lymphodepletion with 30 mg/m2fludarabine daily  on days -5 through 
-2, and 1800 mg/m2cyclophosphamide daily  on days -[ADDRESS_626241]: 1 patient had a complete response (CR) which was maintained 
from month three up to month nine before relapse .  In 5 patients with partial response (PR), the 
response continued for up to four to [ADDRESS_626242] received T -cell infusion (including 12 subjects in 
Cohort 1 and 4 in subsequent Cohorts) is briefly  summarized (from Investigator Brochure dated 
12 April 2016 ).  The most common adverse events (non-laboratory ) occurring in more than 5 
subjects include nausea, pyrexia, cough, dyspnea, diarrhea, fatigue, dizziness, headache, rash 
maculo- papular, sinus tachy cardia, vomiting, musculoskeletal pain, anxiety , constipat ion, cytokine 
release s yndrome and pruritus.  Cy tokine Release Sy ndrome (CRS) was reported in 6 patients; in 
3 patients this was Grade 3 or 4.  Laboratory abnormalities reported as Grade ≥3 treatment related 
adverse events in 2 or more subjects include anemia, lymphocy te, neutrophil, platelet and white 
blood cell counts decreased, and hypophosphatemia.  Serious AEs (SAE) reported in 2 or more 
subjects include pyrexia, cytokine release syndrome, febrile neutropenia, neutrophil count 
decrease, dyspnea, lympho cyte count decrease, and platelet count decrease.  One fatal SAE of bone 
marrow failure (reported as bone marrow hypocellular and aplastic anemia) was reported in a 
patient enrolled in Cohort 2.
In addition, one subject in the ATTACK -OG clinical trial sponsored by [CONTACT_487300][INVESTIGATOR_487245] [[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]] experienced fatal gastrointestinal bleeding with gangrenous 
necrosis of the small bowel in the setting of rash, enterocolitis and bone marrow failure after initial 
bone marrow recovery .
As of January  2017, [ADDRESS_626243] document ed the capacity  for a “preparative

Page 24of 100is necessary  and/or suffic ient to augment immunotherap y efficacy (Klebanoff 2005).  Current 
paradigms hold that “preparative regimens” augment expansion of adoptively  transferred T cells 
by [CONTACT_219689] T cell lymphopenia, which results in increased levels of homeostatic cytokines 
including interleukin -7 and interleukin- 15, which sustain T cell proliferatio n (Fry 2001; Fr y 2001; 
Cui 2009; Gattinoni 2005).  Lymphodepleting regimens also induce transient reductions in 
suppressive T cell populations, which may augment proliferation of adoptively  transferred T cells ; 
however it is unclear which cytotoxic agents best achieve this.  Lymphodepleting regimens may 
also induce damage to the lining of the gastrointestinal tract, which could allow transit of 
lipopoly saccharide across the mucosal barrier and may augment innate immunity , which may in 
turn augment T cell proliferation.  Cytotoxic regimens also induce reductions granulocy tic and 
monocy tic hematopoietic cells, which may modulate suppressive effect of myeloid derived 
suppressor cells. Finally , cytotoxic agents may also induce tumor cell death within the 
microenvironment, which may render it more accessible to antigen activated T cells.  Given that 
the primary  factor responsible for augmenting expansion of adoptive transferred T cells remains 
unclear, it is not surprising that we have a limited understanding of which preparative regimens 
are most effective in this regard.  
This clinical trial utilized lymphodepletion inCohort 1 designed primarily  to induce T cell 
depletion by [CONTACT_487301], a common conditioning strategy  in 
recent gene modified adoptive T cell research .  Some evidence indicates that cyclophosphamide 
as a single agent might achieve depletion of Treg lymphocy tes without global depletion of the 
lymphocy te compartments, therefore reducing the depth of immunosuppression caused by 
[CONTACT_487302] y(Klebanoff 2005); however in some circumstances Tregs can be 
resistant to cyclophosphamide and this is thought to be the mechanism for efficacy of 
cyclophosphamide in graft -versus -host disease prophy laxis in the post-allogeneic transplant 
setting (Kanakry  2013).  In order to establish whether cyclophosphamide alone can deliver an 
environment that allows activity  of the therapeutic cells without the potential additional toxicity 
of an additional chemotherapeutic agent, Cohort [ADDRESS_626244] on the depth of cytoreduction but 
additionally  on the specific action of some cy totoxic drugs .  Recent studies in lymphoma, chronic 
leukemia and acute leukemia using a chimeric antigen receptor showed increased T cell expansion, 
persistence and disease -free survival when fludarabine was added in to a previously 
cyclophosphamide -only preparative regimen (Turtle 2015).  Based on this emerging data, in light 
of our previous demonstrated efficacy  in cohort 1, if there is insufficient activity  in Cohort 3 and

hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Paplham 2014), and while effective it has not been 
established that this is the best preparative strategy .  Effective lymphodepletion has been 
demonstrated in studies using chim eric antigen receptors using reduced cyclophosphamide dosing 
than previously  used in this study ,together with fludarabine (Batlevi 2016) .  In Cohort 4, in order 
to establish whether efficacy  can be maintained with less intensive lymphodepleting

Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless 
permanentl y sterile (see below).
If fertility  is unclear (e.g., amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) an d a menstrual cy cle cannot be 
confirmed before first dose of study  intervention, additional evaluation should be considered.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP
1.Premenarchal
2.Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:
Documented h ysterectomy
Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]
Documented bilateral oophorectom y
For individuals with permanent infertility  due to an alternate medical cause other than the 
above, (e.g., mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity ), investigator discretion s hould be 
applied to determining study  entry .
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history  interview.
3.Postmenopausal female
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. 
A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range (as per 
laboratory  parameters for postmenopausal range) may be used to confirm a
postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal 
replacement therap y (HRT) when postmenopausal status is in doubt .  However, in the 
absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirmation with more than one FSH 
measurement is required. 
Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one 
of the non-estrogen hormonal highl y effective contraception methods if they wish to 
continue their HRT during the study .  Otherwise, they  must discontinue HRT to allow 
confirmation of postmenopausal status before study  enrollment.

to enroll additional patients to further characterize the activit y of the regimen .  Refer to Section 
6.3for information on the rationale for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_487250] .  Enrollment into this 
cohort is now closed.
3.2.4 Cohort 4
On either completion of recruitment or closure ofCohort 3 up to 15 patients with high tumor 
expression of NY-ESO -1 will be treated inCohort 4.  Cohort 4will receive Regimen C 
lymphodepletion ,as described in Section 3.3.3 , and NY-ESO -1c259T.  High tumor NY-ESO -1

context of the totality  of the data.  Refer to Section 6.3for information on the rationale for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_487251] .  If the anti -tumor activity  with Regimen C is determined to be suboptimal, 
then future subjects enrolled in Cohort 4 will receive Regimen A.  
3.2.5 Apheresis 
A non-mobilized PBMC collection should be performed by [CONTACT_487306][INVESTIGATOR_408836].  Bilateral peripheral venous access should be 
used whenever possible but a temporary  central venous catheter (CVC) may be placed for 
collection if peripheral venous access is inadequate.  Standard clinical procedures for apheresis 
should be followed.  Prior to apheresis, platelets should be >75 x109/Land hemoglobin >8.0 gm/dl.  
A large volume leukapheresis should be per formed.  For patients who are >50 kg, 10 to 15 liters
should be processed per procedure; in patients ≤ 50kg, 2-3 blood -volumes should be processed per 
procedure with a goal of the procedure being collection of 1.0 x 108PBMC/kg, and a minimum of 
1.5x107PBMC/kg .  Prior to leukapheresis, an absolute ly mphocy te count of >0.5 x 109/L and the 
CD3 count >200/µL  is recommended .  In cases where the minimum number of PBMC isnot 
collected or the T cells cannot be administered (e.g. release criteria not met), a second apheresis 
may be performed .  Citrate anticoagulant should be used.  Prophylactic intravenous CaCl 2and 
MgSO 4infusions should be administered at the discretion of the apheresis phy sician.

3.3.1 Timing
Apheresis and subsequent chemotherap y should be conducted following the required washout 
periods after the previous dose of treatment .  Preceding anti-neoplastic treatment will need to be 
completed at an appropriate time prior to lymphodepleting chemotherap y (see Section 2.1)
Patients will initiate lymphodepleting therapy  upon receipt by [CONTACT_487307]-process testing demonstrating that the product has achieved release criteria 
(Table 1).  In the unlikely  event that lymphodepleting therapy  has been initiated, but final cell 
product release criteria are not met, discussions between the manufacturing site, Principal 
Investigator , and Sponsor Study  Physician will be conducted to evalu ate the safet y and feasibility  
of cell administration.  The Competent Authority  and IRB/IECwill be notified as necessary .  
Should the cell product be unable to be administered, the Investigator’s clinical team will provide

[IP_ADDRESS] Additional Eligibility Criteria (Prior to Second T -Cell Infusion)
Prior to receipt of a second infusion of NY -ESO -1c259T, all patients must remain eligible to 
receive manufactured T -cell product as defined in Section 2.1and Section 2.2and meet the 
following inclusion criteria:
1.Patient has had a documented confirmed respo nse (PR or CR) or stable disease >[ADDRESS_626286] progressive disease or stable disease ≤[ADDRESS_626287] response may be 
eligible for second infusion (seeSection 3.5.3).
2.A second T cell infusion is recommended b y the Investigator.
3.Patients in any cohort with a confirmed response (PR or CR) or stable disease must have a
new tumor biopsy  confirming NY -ESO -[ADDRESS_626288] T -cell infusion that resolved to Grade ≤1. 
6.Manufactured T -cell product must be available.  
In cases where previously  manufactured T-c ell product is not available, any residual 
leukapheresis product from collections prior to receipt of the gene modified T cells will 
be utilized for a new product manufacture.  
In cases where residual leukapheresed product is not available, patients can a gree to be 
re-leukapheresed for cells only in circumstances where there are no detectable gene 
modified cells.
Furthermore and prior to receipt of a second T-cell infusion, a patient meeting the following 
criterion is not eligible for a second T -cell infusion:

regain contact [CONTACT_1155] (where possible, [ADDRESS_626291]’s last known mailing address or lo cal equivalent methods).  These contact [CONTACT_131994]’s medical records.  Should the subject continue to be 
unreachable, only then will he/she be considered to have withdrawn from the study  with the 
primary  reason as ‘Lost to Follow -up’.
If the subject withdraws consent for further participation in the study , all final End-of- Study  
assessments should be performed, if possible on the day the decision is made to take the subject 
off-study  or as soon as possible thereafter.  All of the results of the evaluations and observations, 
together with a description of the reasons for study  withdrawal, must be recorded in the medical

The following are some of the justifiable reasons for the Investigator to withdraw a subject from 
study :
Withdrawal of consent.
Did not receive an y T cells (refer to Section 8.3and Section 8.4) for continued 
monitoring of AEs/SAEs following stud y procedures.

the Investigator must complete the appropriate documentation to request sample destruction within 
the timeframe specified by [CONTACT_487309].  In 
either case, [COMPANY_004] will only keep stud y information collected/generated up and until that point.
Once a subject has permanently  discontinued from study  treatment, the subject will not be allowed 
to be retreated.
All subjects who discontinue from study  treatment will have safety  assessments at the time of 
discontinuation and during post-study  treatment follow -up as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments Table (see Appendix 2).

3.9 Biologic studies
3.9.1 Monitoring Persistence/Expansion of NY- ESO -1c259T
The goal of the immune/biologic studies are to monitor the expansion/persistence of the adoptively 
transferred cells to test the hypothesis that clinical response correlates with the 1) degree of 
expansion and/or 2) persistence of the geneticall y modified cell in vivo.  
Due to nature of this study , it is possible that expansion of specific T -cell clones will be observed 
as tumor reactive T-cells proliferate.  Therefore, care will be taken to track NY-ESO -1c259T 
persistence.  Geneticall y modified cells willbe measured in blood samples collected periodically

Page 50of 1003.9.4 Monitor ing and Management of Replication- Competent Lentivirus 
Replication Competent Lentivirus (RCL) is a theoretical risk associated with the use of lentiviral 
vectors; no RCL  has ever been detected in vitro or in vivo .  The risk is derived from the detection 
of replication competent retrovirus (RCR) during the use of early  γ-retroviral vector packaging 
systems which were inadequatel y designed to avoid recombination events between the vector and 
packaging components (Miller 1990).  RCR resulted in the onset of lymphoma in 3/10 monkey s 
after receiving cells transduced with an RCR contaminated vector lot (Donahue 1992) .  Updated γ 
retroviral packaging systems have not been associated with RCR, however as a result of the 
Donahue study , RCR/L  must continue to be rigorously  evaluated in vector and cell lots, and in 
subjects post infusion with any  product involving a retrovirus (FDA 2000).
A RCL ma y be generated during the production phase or subsequently after introduction of vector 
transduced cells into the subject .  RCL  may be generated between homologous or non-homologous 
recombination between the transfer vector and packaging elements, or endogenous retroviral 
elements (Chong 1998; Garrett 2000).  A RCL  resulting from the production phase of the lentivirus 
used in this trial is highly  unlikel y since elements are incorporated in the design of the vector 
system that minimize vector recombination and generation of RCL .  Nevertheless, generation of 
an RCL  following infusion of the vector product remains a theoretical possibility .  The 
consequences of such recombination events could be neutral, could reduce the replication rate or 
pathogenicity  of the subject's virus, or could increase the replication rate or pathogenicit y of the 
subject's virus.  Since the development of a strain with increased pathogenicity  would pose greater 
risk to both the subject and their close contact(s), periodic monitoring for RCL  is conducted during 
the course of the trial.
Regulatory  agencies and the gene therap y community  have previousl y discus sed measures to be 
taken should an RCL be confirmed in a subject (FDA 2000).  However, because the probability 
and characteristics of an RCL  are unknown, no concrete plans have been put in place .  
Nevertheless, all agree that the subject must be isolated u ntil an understanding of how to manage 
the subject becomes clear.
Approaches that have been discussed for managing the subject are the following:
Provide targeted antiretroviral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_145071].
Intensive follow up of subject in consultation with gene therapy  experts, study  
investigators, HIV ph ysicians, FDA and NIH.
Inform local public health officials and CDC.
Identify  sexual partners and provide appropriate counseling and intervention.
3.9.5 Testing for RCL in C linical Studies
RCL  will be monitored using a PCR- based assay  that detects and measures copi[INVESTIGATOR_487256]’s envelope protein, namel y Vesicular Stomatitis Virus G protein (VSV -G) 
that is necessary for the assembly  of pseudoty ped infectious lentiviral particles but absent from the 
vector’s backbone .  RCL testing and monitoring will take place on:

3.9.7 Blood Volume Restrictions for Research Samples :
Blood sample volume for the research purposes of this study  will be restricted .  The amount of 
blood drawn from adults (those 18 years of age or older , or relative country -specific guidelines ) 
for research purposes shall not exceed 10.5 mL /kg or 550 mL , whichever is smaller, in an 8 week 
period .  The amount of blood drawn for research purposes from pediatric patient subjects (those 
under 18 years of age or relative country -specific guidelines ) will not excee d 5 mL/kg in a single 
day, and no more than 9.5 mL /kg over an [ADDRESS_626308]; 
the information learned will build understanding of tumor immune escape mechanisms, as well as 
the ability  of the cell product to induce or recover a broader anti-tumor immune response within 
each patient.  Correlating this data with patient responses will be essential to understanding the 
mechanism of action of the NY-ESO -1c259Tproduct and mechanism(s) of tumor escape. The data 
will support late phase clinical development and in parallel will inform potential improvements 
that could be made to NY-ESO -1c259Tto enhance response and durabilit y.
3.10.1 Tumor Biopsy at Baseline, Month 2 , and Disease Progression
When possible, p atients with safel y accessible tumor will be asked to unde rgo core needle tumor 
biopsies at baseline and Month 2(the biops y may betaken ±4weeks of the Month 2 visit) .  If 
possible, biopsies should consist of multiple cores taken from more than one lesion.  Since lung 
lesions are common in synovial sarcoma and may not be amenable to core needle biops y, fine 
needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_487258] .  The baseline biopsy  material may be collected anytime between two months

Page 52of 100and 2 weeks (+1 week) prior to the start of chemotherap y,with a preference for the biops y to be 
taken closer to the chemotherap y.  The tumor tissue should be taken from non-target lesions, or 
from target lesions provided they  are greater than 2cm .  When possible the same lesion(s) should 
be biopsied at both baseline and Month 2.  If it is not possible to biopsy  the same non-target 
lesion(s) at Month 2 , then (an) other non- target lesion(s) preferabl y in the same anatomical region 
should be biopsied.  The apparent clinical or scan status of the lesion(s) biopsied at Month 2should 
be noted at the time (e.g. decreased, stable, increased size or activity ). 
Patient will not be excluded from the study  if tumor is not safely  accessible or if patient does not 
opt for biopsy .
The investigational plan for the biopsies andthe collection and sample preparation methods can 
be found in the Study  Procedures Manual . 
If feasible, biops y material should also be collected when disease progression has been confirmed 
and documented, ideall y on lesions that have progressed .  If progression is identified in the same 
lesion(s) biopsied at Month 2, then this lesion would be preferred for repeat biopsy .  Abiopsy may
be obtained any time post -progression during resection, if possible .  
As stated in section 2.3, patients should not receive anticancer therapy , including surgical 
resections, prior to disease progression .  In the event that a resection of target or non -target lesi ons 
is performed for disease progression, or prior to progression for medically  justified reasons, a 
portion of the tissue must bemade available to [COMPANY_004] for translational research studies to understand 
mechanisms of response or resistance to the therapy .
In patients who have an accumulation of pleural effusion, if there is a clinical requirement for 
removal of the effusion fluid at any time on study we request that samples be collected for [COMPANY_004] 
for translational research studies .  If available, pleural effusion fluid should becollected in addition 
to and not in place of the requested tumor biopsies .  We request that every  attempt is made to 
collect both tumor biopsies and effusion fluid when it is possible and for each of the requested on -
study  time points.
3.11 Criteria forCompletion of Interventional Phase, Transition to Long -Term Follow -up 
or Discontinuation

Subjects who remain progression free will continue to be assessed under the interventional phase 
of the protocol until [ADDRESS_626310] swill be followed for 15 years from the time of second T cell infusion.  
All subjects will continue to be followed for overall survival during the Long Term Follow Up 
(LTFU).  LTFU will occur either as part ofthis study , or subjects willbe rolled -over into a separate 
LTFU protocol ([COMPANY_004]208750 [ADP -0000 -002]) when available .  TheLTFU protocol will undergo 
regulatory , institutional and ethic scommittee approval and subjects will be consented to this 
specific LTFU study for continued collection of LTFU data. Please refer to Appendix 4for LTFU
assessments .
Subjects who have progressive disease prior to one y ear will be assessed at 3months for required 
persistence, RCL , hematology , chemistry ,and phy sical exam but then should be monitored every 
[ADDRESS_626311] T cell infusion as described in Appendix 4.
The physical exam (including concomitant medications and adverse events) will be conducted with 
careful attention to features possibly  related to oncoretroviral diseases including: (1) New 
malignancies, (2) New incidence or exacerbation of a pre-existing neurologic disorder, (3) New 
incidence of exacerbation of a prior rheumatologic or other autoimmune disorder, and (4) New 
incidence of a hematologic disorder .  (5) Unexpected illness and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_487259] y.
From year 6 to 15, s ubjects will be asked to return for testing only if vector modified cells were 
detected in the previous visit.  If so, then blood for persistence of vector modified cells will be 
performed and an annual RCL  testing (archive) collected .  If no vector modified cells were detected 
in the previous visit, annual follow -up will be conducted by [CONTACT_3553] a clinical questionnaire 
completed via phone or through the mail by [CONTACT_9137] .  A draft letter to the patient and 
the patient’s primary  doctor (if different than the study  Investigator listed on this protocol) is 
provided in Appendix 5.
For as long as female patients have detectable gene modified cells, they will be advised to avoid 
pregnancy .  Persistence data will be performed in real time and this data will be used to properly 
advise patients in a timely  manner .

4.4 Treatment of Cytokine R elease S yndrome 
Cytokine release sy ndrome (CRS) is a potentially life -threatening toxicity  that has been observed 
following administration of antibodie s and adoptive T-cell therapi[INVESTIGATOR_72911] .  It is defined 
clinically  by [CONTACT_487315], nausea, diarrhea, 
headache, fatigue, tachycardia, hypotension, transaminitis, rash and dyspnea .  It is important to 
evaluate the subject for concurrent infections.  Potentially  life-threatening complications of CRS 
include cardiac dy sfunction, adult respi[INVESTIGATOR_36522], neurologic toxicity , renal and/or 
hepatic failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation .  CRS may also be associated with 
findings of macrophage activation sy ndrome or occur coincident with tumor ly sis sy ndrome.
CRS causes a rapid rise in serum cytokine levels under conditions of immune activation and 
although cytokines will be assay ed serially  thro ughout the study , results of the assay s will not be 
available in real time; therefore CRS, should be graded and managed with supportive and 
immunosuppressive interventions according to the severit y of s ymptoms (Lee 2014 ).  
Table 3 provides the recommended management of CRS according to grade, which has been 
further adapted from CTCAE for use with immunotherapy  and should be implemented in 
accordance with institutional guidelines.
Symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_487263] y.  Symptoms can mimic 
those seen with infection .  The diagnosis of CRS is clinical, and is supported by  [CONTACT_487316] .  Assessment 
and treatment guidelines are provided below.  If CRS is suspected, in addition to assessment for 
infection, cytokine levels as described as well CRP and Ferritin levels should be measured 
approximately  every other day until symptoms are improving or an alternative diagnosis is 
confirmed.

Source:  Lee 2014
Subjects requiring immunosuppressive intervention may receive tocilizumab, steroids, or both 
(Davila 2014 ; Lee 2014 ).  Tocilizumab is a humanized anti-IL-6 receptor antibody  that has been 
used to manage severe CRS (although it is not approved for this indication).  Anecdotally , 
tocilizumab has produced rapid and complete correction of CRS with single doses (Maude 2014).  
Lee et al., recommend administration of tocilizumab 4 mg/kg administered over [ADDRESS_626317]-line treatment of severe CRS (Lee 2014) .  Subjects may receive a repeat dose 
if clinical signs and s ymptoms do not improve within 24- [ADDRESS_626318] not been reported in CRS use ( Lee 2014 ).
Subjects unresponsive to tocilizumab or experiencing severe neurological symptoms (e.g. 
confusion, delirium, seizure, etc.) may require treatment with steroids.  Lee et al., recommend 
steroids as second -line therapy  for CRS as the response to tocilizumab may be more rapid and 
owing to the potential of steroids to attenuate the anti -tumor effects of the adoptive T- cell therap y.  
However, in subjects with grade 3 or 4 CRS associated with neurologic dysfunction without

doses (e.g. 2 mg/k g/day  prednisone equivalent) may  be required.
If cytokine release syndrome is suspected, a physician with expertise in the management of 
subjects following bone marrow transplant should be consulted .  If high dose corticosteroids are 
required, treatment should generally  be continued for at least [ADDRESS_626320] label for tocilizumab.

have been reported (Fidler 2012).  There are no published guidelines for the management of 
autologous GvHD .  However, lessons can be drawn from published cases reports and guidelines

Of Note: Bone marrow suppression and related cytopenias have been described in the setting of 
acute GvHD.  Management of this complication is challenging, with no clearl y established 
guidelines regarding immunosuppression.  Treatment may be largel y supportive, including 
transfusions and treatment of infections. 
Management should include consultation with a physician with expertise in the management of 
patients following bone marrow transplant.
Bone marrow suppression is also a feature of transfusion-related GvHD .  To minimize the 
possibility  of trans fusion-related GvHD, all blood products transfused within [ADDRESS_626324] 4 weeks following T -cell infusion or  until bon e marrow 
recovery  (whichever is longer) must be irradiated .  Patients receiving steroids or other 
immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_487266].
4.6.2 Grading of GvHD
Grading of GvHD is based on the stage of dermal, gastrointestinal, and hepatic involvement as 
described in the Table below .  Careful measurement of stool volume and assessment of percentage 
of body  area covered by  [CONTACT_487319].
Stage Skin Gut Liver
1 Maculopapular rash <25% of body area Diarrhea >500 ml/day Bilirubin 2- 3 mg/dl
2 Maculopapular rash 25% -50% of body area Diarrhea >1,000 ml/day Bilirubin 3- 6 mg/dl
3 Generalized erythroderma Diarrhea>1,500 ml/day Bilirubin 6- 15 mg/dl
4 Desquamation an d bullae Diarrhea>2,000 ml/day or 
pain or ileusBilirubin >15 mg/dl
With the addition of assessment of functional impairment, grading can be determined using the 
table below (Glucksberg 1974).

4.6.3 Management of GvHD
Although the diagnosis of GvHD is predominantly  based on clinical grounds, biopsy  of affected 
organs can be helpful in excluding other causes and supporting the diagnosis of GvHD with 
consistent histopathologic findings .  However, awaiting biops y results should not delay  the 
institutio n of appropriate therap y. 
If GvHD is suspected:
A physician with expertise in the management of subjects following bone marrow 
transplant should be consulted.
Consider biopsy  of the affected organ(s)
Corticosteroids have been used as the standard first li ne treatment for GvHD for several decades .  
Their effect is likely  to be due to lymphol ytic effects and anti-inflammatory  properties .  In general, 
intestinal and liver GvHD require more prolonged steroid therapy  than skin disease although 
response times va ry. 
Diarrhea should be managed with volume replacement, dietary  restriction, and anti-diarrheal 
agents including the consideration of somatostatin for secretory  diarrhea .  Agents that slow 
motility  should be used cautiously , ensuring that there is no evid ence of ileus or toxic megacolon, 
and infectious causes of diarrhea should be excluded.
General guidelines for first-line treatment based on grade are provided below, and should be 
considered in conjunction with input from the consulting physician with bone marrow transplant 
expertise.
Grade Management Strategy
I Subjects with grade I disease are not likely to require systemic treatment .  Cutaneous 
GvHD may respond to topi[INVESTIGATOR_178339] .  Antihistamines may be helpful in 
subjects with pruritus .  Subjec ts should be reviewed frequently for other organ 
manifestations of GvHD .
II Treat skin symptoms with topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826] .  For GI symptoms -optimize anti -diarrheal 
regimen, dietary restrictions, volume replacement and consider initiation of non -
absorbable steroids .  For refractory or progressive symptoms consider systemic steroids 
as outlined below.

Page 60of 100III For more severe or progressive symptoms consider systemic corticosteroids (e.g., 
methylprednisolone one (1) mg/kg per day*)
IV Methylprednisolone two (2) mg/kg per day*
*The use of ‘nonabsorbable’ steroids (Budesonide and beclomethasone) can be considered for acute intestinal GvHD in 
order to reduce the dose of systemic steroids
If high dose corticosteroids are required, treatment should generall y be continued for at least [ADDRESS_626325] GvHD .  Therefore, for grade II -IV disease refractory  to high dose steroids, the 
addition of a calcineurin inhibitor can be considered.
Otherwise, there are several additional second line treatment options for which there is currently 
limited and/or evolving supporting data.  Treating physicians can refer to the Haemato -oncology  
Task Force of the British Committee for Standards in Haematology  and the British Society  for 
Blood and Marrow Transplantation guideline for diagnosis and management of acute graft -versus-
host disease (Dignan 2012).

4.7.1 Management of Neutropenia
The pre -conditioning chemotherapy  is intended to cause lymphodepletion .  However, neutropenia 
is also common .  Prophy lactic use of G-CSF should be administered toall subjects.  G- CSF should 
be used for management of neutropenia according to ASCO guidelines.  G-CSF should be given
daily  from day +2 (RIB/regimens A and B) or [ADDRESS_626327] the final dose of cyclophosphamide 
(Regimen C) and continued until reaching an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of at least 1× 109/L
or per institutional practice .
According to institutional standard practice, long-acting (pegy lated) G-CSF may be given in 
preference to short acting daily G-CSF.  Pegylated G-CSF will be given as one dose on day +2 
(Regimens A and B) or [ADDRESS_626328] the final dose of cyclophosphamide (Regimen C).

Page 61of 1004.7.2 Management of Pancytopenia with Bone Marrow F ailure
Recurrent pancy topenia/aplastic anemia has been reported after initial bone marrow recovery  from 
chemotherap y followed by [CONTACT_487320]-ESO -1c259T cells.  Bone marrow recovery  following 
lymphodepletion will be defined as:
Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1x109/L for 2 consecutive measurements and
Platelet count ≥ 20 x109/L without transfusion support
Aplastic anemia is a rare hematological disorder characterized by [CONTACT_487321] a hypocellular 
marrow.  Patients are usually  symptomatic on presentation but some are detected incidentally  when 
unexpected cytopenias are found on a routine blood count.  The diagnosis of severe aplastic anemia 
is made in the setting of a hypocellular bone marrow when 2 of the following 3 blood counts are 
met: absolute neutro phil count < 0.5 x109/L, absolute reticulocy te count < 60 x109/L, and platelet 
count < 20 x109/L, and myelodysplastic syndrome is ruled out.  The clinical consequences of 
aplastic anemia are life-threatening bleeding from thrombocy topenia, and infection as a result of 
neutropenia.  Bacterial and fungal infections are common and a significant cause of morbidity and 
mortality .
Management of bone marrow suppression and related cytopenias in aplastic anemia is challenging, 
with no clearly established guidelines regarding immunosuppression.  Treatment is largel y 
supportive, including transfusions and treatment of infections.  If there is evidence of, or concern 
for the development of pancy topenia (decreasing hemoglobin, platelets or neutrophils, or 
increasing transfusion requirements) following initial bone marrow recovery  the following 
measures should be implemented:
1.Consult a phy sician with expertise in the management of aplastic anemia
2.Increase the frequency  of CBCs as clinically  indicated.
3.Exclude other altern ative etiologies such as other drugs, viral causes, etc.
4.An early bone marrow biopsy  is recommended for clinical diagnosis, with a sample to be 
provided to the sponsor fo r study
5.A matched peripheral blood sample should be collected in parallel with the bone marrow 
sample and provided to the sponsor
6.Initiate treatment with GCSF
7.Consult an I nfectious Diseases expert
8.Once alternative etiologies have been excluded, strongl y consider immunosuppression 
(e.g. methy lprednisolone 2mg/kg initial dose) or more aggress ive regimens (e.g. 
antithy mocy te globulin (ATG), cyclosporine, eltrombopag) as well as antimicrobial 
prophy laxis/therapy  with the advice of your hematology /ID consultant(s) .  If high dose 
corticosteroids are initiated, continue for a minimum of 5 days and taper graduall y with 
advice from expert consultants.
Please refer to Section 4.5(Management of Graft -versus -Host Disease) regarding bone marrow 
suppression as a feature of GvHD.

Page 62of 1005 Response Criteria 
Objective response and progression will be primarily  evaluated in this study  using the new 
international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_8225] (RECI ST 
v1.1) Committee ( Eisenhauer 2009).  Although criteria for progression may be reached at the Day 
28 evaluation, determination of progression will not be made prior to confirmation by  [CONTACT_487322] 8, due to the potential for initial swelling and delay ed tumor response in cell therapy  
regimens.  
All imaging scans (CT or MRI ) will also be collected and stored at a central imaging laboratory  
for independent review .  Imaging scans of all areas affected by [CONTACT_487323], at minimum, the 
chest, abdomen and pelvis should be performed at Baseline and all subsequent visits.  Acceptable 
imaging modalities for this study  include:
Diagnostic -quality  CT scan with oral and/or i.v. iodinated contrast of the chest and 
abdomen/pelvis (CT is the preferred modality  for tumor assessmen ts)
MRI  of the abdomen/pelvis acquired before and after gadolinium contrast agent 
administration and a non -contrast enhanced CT of the chest, if a subject is contraindicated 
for contrast enhanced CT.
The same imaging modality  and image -acquisition protocol (including the use of IV contrast) 
should be used consistently  across all timepoints for individual subjects to allow uniform 
comparison of lesions.  Prior to starting the study , a detailed imaging acquisition protocol will be 
provided to the sites.
5.[ADDRESS_626329] v1.1, at the baseline tumor assessment, a maximum of five (up to two 
per organ) reproducibl y measurable lesions (≥10mm in longest diameter or, for lymph nodes, 
≥15mm in the shortest diameter) will be determined as Target lesions and other tumor lesions or 
disease manifestations (e.g.ascites, effusions) recorded as Non-Target lesions .  At each subsequent 
tumor assessment, changes in the sum of the diameters (unidimensional measurement) of all 
designated Target tumor lesions is used to assess outcome according to RECI ST v1.1 criteria .  In 
addition, perpendicular bi-dimensional measurements of Target lesions should also be made 
(where possible) and the sum of the products of the [ADDRESS_626330] perpendi cular diameters are to be 
used to evaluate tumor burden in accordance with the principles of the immune related response 
criteria (irRC , Wolchok 2009 ).

absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  Note: determination of PD will require confirmation 
by [CONTACT_487324] 4 weeks later unless the patient requires anti-cancer therap y 
sooner.
Stable Di sease (SD) 
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, 
taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study
b.Evaluation of Non -Target L esions 
Complete Response (CR) 
Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level.  All 
lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm short axis)
Note:  If tumor markers are initially  above the upper normal limit, they must normalize 
for a patient to be considered in complete clini cal response.
Non-CR/Non -PD (Stable Disease, SD)
Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker 
level above the normal limits.
Progressive Disease (PD) 
Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions may be considered PD for non-
target lesions. 
Unequivocal progression should not normally  trump target lesion status.  It must be 
representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.    
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_33954], and the progression

tissue.  When the evaluation of complete response depends on this determination, it is 
recommended that the residual lesions be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy , 
PET scan) before confirming the complete response status.

axis when assessed by [CONTACT_3610] (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5

5.6 Non-Measurable Disease
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non-measurable disease.  
Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonitis , inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_118445] ), are considered as non -measurable.
Note:  Cy stic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographicall y defined simple cy sts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cy sts.
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if 
they meet the definition of measurability  described above .  However, if non-cystic lesions are 
present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.
5.7 Target Lesions
Measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, representative 
of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and measured and recorded at 
baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameters), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend 
themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the 
largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next 
largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly  should be selected.  A sum of the diameters 
(longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated 
and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then 
only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to 
further characterize an y objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.
Progressive disease by [CONTACT_393] v1.1 criteria (Eisenhauer 2009) noted after the first re-staging scan 
may represent disease that was not detected on the pre -study  scan, and a confirmatory  scan will be 
required at the next scheduled re -staging evaluation unless clinically  not indicated.  If confirmed, 
progression should be dated by  [CONTACT_487326].

All measure ments should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely  as possible to the beginning of treatment and 
never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up.  Imaging -based evaluation is

safet y evaluations.  
If several subjects within a cohort are deemed major protocol violators, for example receiving a 
dose outside the range defined in Section 3.2.[ADDRESS_626341] eligibility  for inclusion in the per-protocol population will be made 
prior to data analy sis and reporting.
The following subgroups may be evaluated: (1) Subjects who receive a dose of at least 1 billion

67% response rate 5 or more 0.93 probability
67% response rate 6 or more 0.79 probability
Thus, if the true probability  of a response were 0.67, there is a 79% probability  of observing 6 or 
more responses and 93% probability  of observing 5 or more responses .  If the true probability  were 
0.30, these probabilities are 5% and 15% respectively .  This would indicate that observing 5 or 
more responses out of 10 provides reasonable evidence that the true response rate could be 
consistent with 67%.  
A lower response rate for example of 57% would also be clinicall y meaningful.  The probability  
of observing 5 or more res ponders out of 10 subjects would be 78% given a true response rate of 
0.57.  
Should the trial dynamics result in >10 subjects in a cohort, holding all other variables constant, 
this would result in greater confidence.  The table below illustrates this forthe probability  of

6.3.2 Cohort 2
A true response rate of 0.40 would be clinically  meaningful in this cohort.  The following table 
shows the probabilit y of observing 3+ or 4+ responses in 10 patients as a function of the true 
underly ing probability  of a response equaling 40%:

response, assuming N=10 Probability of 
respo nding 
40% response rate 3 or more 0.83 probability
40% response rate 4 or more 0.62 probability
Thus, if the true probability  of a response were 0.40, there is a 62% probability  of observing 4 or 
more responses and 83% probability  of observing 3 or more responses .  This would indicate that 
observing 3 or more responses out of 10 provides reasonable evidence that the true response rate 
could be consistent with 40%.

0.75.  As such the lower bound of 0.2 5 is considered clinically  relevant to evaluate for futility . 
To compute the predictive probability (PP), we assume a fairl y non -informative prior distribution, 
i.e., a beta (0.18, 0.82) for the ORR .  This prior was chosen as it may be viewed as somewhat 
pessimistic and supportive of the historical control rate .  Under the assumption that the number of 
responses X in n=5 subjects follows a binary  distribution B(n, p), the posterior distribution of the 
ORR follows a beta(0.18+x, 0.82+n- x) distribution .  This then means that the future number of 
responses, Y in m = Nmax- n follows a beta-binomial (m, 0.18+x, 0.82+n- x) distribution .  Using 
methods described in Lee and Liu (2008 ), the predictive probability  is derived for Nmax=10 as 
shown in the table below.
A threshold of 0.2 is used to declare futility , i.e. if PP < 0.2 then the cohort has met the futility  
criterion.

Observed X responses in [ADDRESS_626346] X=0/5 X=1/5*X=2/5 X=3/5 Futility (PP < 0.2)

0.50  0 0 0.031 0.299 Yes X=0,1,2
* if 1/ 5 responses are observed thePP that ORR > 0.25 is 0.033, which is < 0.2 (the futility  
threshold), so the futility  criterion has been met.
When X = [ADDRESS_626347] 
considered above. 
Likewise when X > 2, the PP does not meet the futility  criterion and hence the cohort will 
continue to N maxsubjects. 
When X = 2/5 (i.e., p=0.4), the PP ranges from 0.031 to 0.548 depending on whether the rate is 
0.50, 0.25 or 0.18 and hence futility  is declared for the probability  that ORR exceeds 0.50 but not

Page 70of 100for the other two scenarios .  Note that in this case the ORR of 0.4 leads to a 95 % (Wilson) CI  of 
(0.12, 0.77).  The small sample size leads to a high degree of imprecision and therefore a high 
chance of a type II error (even if this trial is not powered to test the hypothesis) .  Thus, clinical 
judgment will also be employ ed in the decision to stop a cohort as indicated earlier.

overall response rate (ORR); time to response (TTR), duration of response (DoR), best overall 
response (BOR); progression free survival rate (PFS); and the overall survival rate (OS).
Primary  Analyses–The primary  effic acy endpoint is ORR.  ORR is defined as the proportion of 
subjects with a confirmed CR or PR per RECI ST v1.1 relative to the total number of subjects in 
the corresponding analysis population.  The ORR will be based on confirmed responses from the 
investiga tor assessment of overall response.  Subjects with unknown or missing response will be 
treated as non-responders (i.e., they will be included in the denominator when calculating the 
proportion).  90% and 95% Wilson confidence intervals will be computed forORR in each cohort.  
Secondary  Anal yses–The key secondary  endpoints are DoR, PFS and OS.  
Duration of overall response is defined as the time between confirmed response until the first date 
of progressive d isease per RECI ST v1.1 (see S ection 5.2).  DoR will be summarized descriptively 
for subjects for each cohort using Kaplan -Meier quartile estimates.  
Overall Survival is defined as the interval between date of T-cell infusion and death due to any 
cause.  If the subject does not have a documented date of death, OS will be censored at the date of 
the last adequate assessment.
PFS is defined as the interval between the date of first dose and the earliest date of disease 
progression or death due to any cause.  PFS will be summarized by [CONTACT_487328] -Meier 
quartile estimates.  If the subject does not have a documented date of progression or death, PFS 
will be censored at the date of the last adequate assessment.
OS and PFS will be summarized graphicall y for each cohort using Kaplan- Meier plots.
Further details about the primary  and other secondary efficacy /exploratory analyses will be 
outlined in the RAP, for example, sensitivity  analy ses, details for rules for censoring ,etc. 
6.5 Statistical Methods for Safety and Demographic Endpoints

laboratory  measurements, ECG recordings, and phy sical examina tion results.  
Adverse Events –All adverse events will be listed and coded by [CONTACT_61132].  The number and 
percent of patients reporting any treatment emergent adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_53428].  Adverse events with missing date of onset will be considered 
treatment emergent. Adverse events will be further summarized by [CONTACT_926] , relationship to 
treatme nt and seriousness .Tables and/or narratives of any on study  death, or serious or significant

7 Human Subjects Protections
7.1 Participation of Children
The age range of patients eligible for this trial is ages ≥4 and up .  All patient s<18 years of age (or 
relative country -specific guidelines) will be enrolled at participating sites.  Physicians, nurses, and 
multidisciplinary  support teams for these subjects must have expertise in the management of 
children.  
7.2 Evaluation of Benefits and Risks/Discomforts
7.2.1 Potential Benefit of Adoptive Immunotherapy
Survival for the population of patients eligible for this trial is limited .  Although the overall 
treatment plan is experimental, preliminary  data from a study  conducted in adults demonstrated 
significant antitumor effects, therefore, there is reason to believe that patients enrolled on this study 
will derive benefit.  Patients participating in this trial will be treated with therapeutic intent, and 
the response to therapy  will be monitored.  The potential benefits from adoptive immunotherap y 
for synovial sarcoma are disease remission and/or reduction in cancer -related symptoms.  This 
protocol involves greater than minimal risk, but presents the potential for direct benefit to 
individual subjects according to 21CFR50.52, 46.405.
7.2.2 Potential Risks of Adoptive Immunotherapy
The primary  risks to patients participating in this research study  include toxicity  of the 
chemotherap y,as described in Section 7.2.3 ,and the potential risks associated with infusion of 
autologous modified T cells engineered to express antigen receptors to a known tumor antigen.

conducted on this tumor biopsy is unlik ely, participation in this research may allow patients some 
benefit in knowing their contribution may lead to a greater understanding of their cancer and 
potential benefit to others in the future.  Patients enrolled on this protocol suffer from extremel y 
rare malignancies with very low survival rates and often have a strong desire to participate in 
research that may  lead to a better understanding of their disease.
7.2.5 Potential Risk of Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy / Guillain Barré 
Syndrome (G BS)
Acute demy elinating peripheral neuropathy  / Guillain Barré Syndrome (GBS) developed in two 
subjects who received the NY -ESO -1C259T cells following infusion. Therefore, subjects with prior 
or active demy elinating disease will be excluded from the study .Neurologic consultation is 
required for patients with Grade 2 or higher neurologic events of a ≥7 day  duration. Additionally , 
any potential future recurrence of GBS will lead to a pause in study  enrolment until further 
investigation .

8.2 Definition of Adverse Event
In accordance with the International Conference of Harmonization (I CH), an AE is any  untoward 
medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject who receives a pharmaceutical 
product .  The event does not necessarily  have a causal relationship with study  treatm ent to be an 
AE.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product .  Disease progression will not be reported as an AE, however other pre-existing conditions 
which worsen during the study  are to be reported as AEs.
Additionally  for this study , all laboratory  abnormalities with a CTCA E grading of grade [ADDRESS_626352] be reported as an adverse event.

product infusion.  During the period between leukapheresis and lymphodepletion , only serious 
adverse events (SAEs) related to the study  procedure which occur within 2 weeks of leukapheresis 
will be reported .  During long term follow -up (15 years), subjects will only be monitored for 
delay ed adverse events related to the gene transfer aspect of the protocol (see Section 3.11.2 for 
LTFU). 
Adverse events will be graded according to the NCI Common Toxicity  Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) v 4.0. 
All reported adverse events, signs or symptoms or abnormal laboratory  findings should be 
recorded at every visit according to the appropriate diagnosis and rated for intensity , causality  and 
seriousness .  In the absence of a diagnosis, individual symptoms or findings should be recorded 
and rated.  If photographs are requested by [CONTACT_487332] e.g. a rash AE, the subject will sign a 
Medical Photograph Release prior to an y photographs being taken. 
All AEs should be followed until: 
Resolved or improved to baseline.
Investigator confirms no further improvement can be expected.
Death
On discontinuation of the subject from the interventional portion of the study, or withdrawal from 
the study , serious or severe adverse events will be followed until one of the above criteria is met 
for up to 4weeks .  Serious adverse events related to investigational product will continue to be 
recorded and monitored into long -term follow -up at any  time (Section 10.4).

8.4 Reporting Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
An SAE is any  adverse event that:
Is fatal (results in death; NOTE: death is the outcome, not the event).
Is life-threatening; (NOTE: the term “life-threatening” refers to an event in which the 
subject was at immediate risk of death at the ti me of the event; it does not refer to an event 
which could h ypothetically have caused a death had it been more severe).
Requires in- subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].
Results in a persistent or significant disability  or substantial disruption of the ability  to 
conduct normal life functions.
Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect.
Is clinicall y significant or requires intervention or prevent one or the outcomes listed above.
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding if an adverse event is of 
significant enough medical importance to be classified as serious outside the above definitions.  
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of 
major clinical signi ficance .  They  may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to 
prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above .  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a 
seizure that did not result in in-subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_487270] y be considered serious .  In this case event will be reported 
using the serious criteria of clinically  significant or requires intervention.

Encephalopath y has been described in association with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T 
therap y, and termed (CAR) T cell related encephalopathy  syndrome, or CRES (Neelapu et al, 
2018 ).  CRES ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y manifests as a toxic encephalopathy  which is generall y reversible.  Early 
signs include diminished attention, language disturbance and impaired handwriting.  Other 
signs/sy mptoms include confusion, disorientation, agitation, aphasia, somnolence, and tremors.  In 
severe cases of CRES (defined as grade >2), seizures, motor weakness, incontinence, mental 
obtundation, increased intracranial pressure, papi[INVESTIGATOR_044], and cerebral edema may  also occur.
CRES occurring within the first 5 days after immunotherapy  may be concurrent with high fever 
and CRS sy mptoms.  This fo rm of CRES tends to be of shorter duration, lower grade (grade 1–2, 
see Table 6), and is generall y reversible with anti-IL-6 therapy .  CRES presenting as delay ed 
neurotoxicity  with seizures or epi[INVESTIGATOR_487273] y, after the initial fever and CRS subside.
Encephalopath y syndrome (ES) may occur with other cancer immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including TCRs.  
Cance r patients may also be at risk for encephalopathic symptoms due to other causes ranging 
from mild to moderate somnolence and confusion as a result of sedating medications, to seizures 
in relation to brain metastases.  The possible contribution of other medications, underl ying disease 
and/or co-morbidities should be evaluated when considering a diagnosis of encephalopath y 
syndrome in relation to T cell therapy .
8.7.1 Grading of ES
Neelapu et al (2018) have developed a new grading system for ES which incorpor ates the 
CARTOX 10 point neurological assessment (CARTOX 10) tool, see Table 5.  Points are assigned 
for each of the tasks in Table 1 which are perfor med correctly .  Normal cognitive function is 
defined b y an overall score of 10.
The CARTOX -10 should be used to monitor all subjects for ES.

1 • Vigilant supportive care; aspi[INVESTIGATOR_134174]; intravenous (IV) hydration
• Withhold oral intake of food, medicines, and fluids, and assess swallowing
• Convert all oral medications and/or nutrition to IV or enteral tube if swallowing is impaired
• Avoid medications that cause central nervous system depression
• Evaluate for other contributing causes and treat accordingly
• Neurology consultation including fundoscopic exam to assess for papi[INVESTIGATOR_59411]
• MRI of the brain with and without contrast (CT scan of the brain if MRI is not feasible).  Further 
testing if indicated such as diagnostic lumbar puncture with measurement of opening pressure if 
increased intracranial pressure is suspected, or MRI spi[INVESTIGATOR_487276]
• Institute levetiracetam therapy and consider EEG if seizure activity is suspected
• Consider anti-IL-6 therapy with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg1IVor siltuximab 11 mg/kg IV, if Grade 1 
persists beyond 24 hours, or worsening and associated with concurrent cytokine -release syndrome 
(CRS)
2 • Supportive care and neurological work -up as described for grade 1 ES
• Anti-IL-6 therapy if associated w ith concurrent CRS
• Consider Dexamethasone 10 mg IV every  6 h or methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg IV every  12 h if 
refractory to anti-IL-6 therapy, or for ES without concurrent CRS; Once initiated continue 
corticosteroids until improvement to grade 1 ES and then taper

8.8 Pregnancy
There is no preclinical or clinical trial data of NY-ESO -1c259T in pregnant women; however, 
there is a reasonable but unproven likelihood that this intervention may be significantly 
embry otoxic or even an abortifacient given the underly ing biology  of the target.  The effects on 
breast milk are unknown; therefore, breastfeeding should be discontinued for the duration of the

cell infusion, or 4 months after there is no evidence of persistence/gene modified cells in the 
subject’s blood, whichever is longer.
Pregnancy  (or pregnancy of a male subject’s partner) is not considered an AE/SAE unless there is 
reason to believe that the pregnancy  may be the result of fail ure of the contraceptive being used 
due to interaction with any of the IPs.  However, the Investigator shall report all pregnancies 
immediately  to the Sponsor.  A woman who becomes and remains pregnant during the study  will 
be discontinued from the treatme nt phase as exposure to radiation from imaging studies would be 
contraindicated in this setting.  The subject would enter into LTFU.  The outcome of the pregnancy  
must also be reported to the Sponsor.  The contraception and pregnancy  guidelines in Section 2.3.1
should continue to be followed during LTFU.
If a pregnancy  is reported, the investigator should inform [COMPANY_004] within 24 hours of learning of the
pregnancy .

The occurrence of any event of GBS will mandate a pause in enrollment and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_487278]3377794 studies.
9.2 Regulatory and Ethical Considerations, Including the Informed Consent Process 
Prior to initiation of a site, the Sponsor will obtain favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]/approval from the appropriate 
regulatory  agency  to conduct the stud y in accordance with ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and 
applicable country -specific regulatory  requirements.
The study  will also be conducted in accordance with ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP), all 
applicable subject privacy  requirements, and the guiding principles of the current version of the 
Declaration of Helsinki.  This includes, but is not limited to, the following:
IRB/IEC review and favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]/approval of the study protocol and amendments as 
applicable
Obtaining signed informed consent
Investigator reporting requirements (e.g. reporting of AEs/SAEs/protocol deviations to 
IRB/IEC)
Sponsor will provide full details of the above procedures, either verball y, in writing, or 
both.
Optional assessments (including those in a separate protocol and/or under separate 
informed consent) and the clinical protocol should be concurrentl y submitted for approval 
unless regulation requires separate submission .  Approval of the optional assessments may 
occur after approval is granted for the clinical protocol where required by [CONTACT_169687] y 
authorities.  In this situation, written approval of the clinical protocol should state that 
approval of optional assessments is being deferred and the study , with the exception of the 
optional assessments, can be initiated.

ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, 
bilirubin, I NR) and perform liver 
event follow up assessments 
within 24-[ADDRESS_626375] weekly 
until liver chemistries resolve, 
stabilize or return to within baseline 
(pre-Gene Therap y)
1.Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is ava ilable .  Additionally, if serum bilirubin fractionation 
testing is unavailable, record presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick, indicating direct bilirubin 
elevations and suggesting liver injury. 
2.All events of ALT 3x ULN andbilirubin 2x ULN (>35% direct bilirubin) or ALT 3x ULN andINR>1.5, which 
may indicate severe liver injury (possible ‘Hy’s Law’), must be reported as an SAE (excluding studies of hepatic 
impairment or cirrhosis); The INR threshold value stated will not apply to p articipants receiving anticoagulants .
3.New  or w orsening symptoms believed to be related to liver injury (such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, or jaundice) or believed to be related to hypersensitivity (such as fever, r ash or 
eosinophilia) .
4.Includes: Hepatitis A IgM antibody; Hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) and Hepatitis B Core Antibody (IgM); 
Hepatitis C RNA; Cytomegalovirus IgM antibody; Epstein -Barr viral capsid antigen IgM antibody (or if unavailable, 
obtain hete rophile antibody or monospot testing); Hepatitis E IgM antibody .

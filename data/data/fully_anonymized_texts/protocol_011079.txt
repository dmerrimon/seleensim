1 PROTOCOL SUMMARY 
1.1 SYNOPSIS 
Title: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_599170]:          Psoriasis is a Th17 linked inflammato ry disease and we find that the 
vitamin B3 analogue nicotinamide ri boside (NR) blunts Th1 and Th17 
activation in ex-vivo naïve and differentiated T cells from control and psoriasis subjects. These findings  supported the proposal of the 
following hypothesis. Supplementation with NR will blunt systemic immune activation in mild/moderate psoriasis. 
Objectives: 1) Evaluate the effect of NR on Th17 biology 
2) Explore the effect of NR on ne utrophils, specifically low- 
density granulocytes 
3) Evaluate whether NR modulates keratinocyte activation in skin 
lesions in psoriatic subjects 
4) Evaluate the effect of NR on HDL regulated reverse 
cholesterol transport and lipid composition 
 
Endpoints: The primary outcome will be  the change in the T H17 cell cytokine IL- 
17 secretion in response to T- cell differentiation comparing the 
baseline versus NR or placebo. The comparisons will be performed using paired two-tailed Student t-tests. Significance will be tested at 
the 0.05 alpha level in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. 
Exploratory outcomes are: 
1) Evaluate the effect of NR on the T cell transcriptome 
2) Explore the effect of NR on low-density granulocytes and 
neutrophils 
Study Population: Up to 40 male and female subjects of all races between the ages of 
18-80 years with mild-moderate psor iasis who live locally will be 
screened . 
Phase: N/A 
Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants: Enrollment and study visits will take place at the NIH Clinical Center

Version Date: 07/21/[ADDRESS_792642] two decades, inflammation has been id entified as an important pathogenic process in 
cardiometabolic diseases (CMD) such as at herosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), 
dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], insulin resistance, diabetes and ob esity. Over the last eight years, the Mehta 
laboratory within the NHLBI DIR has studied psoriasis, a comm on, chronic inflam matory T-cell 
skin disease associated with increased CVD and CMD as a mode l to understand the effect of 
chronic inflammation on these disease states. At th e same time, the degree of obesity has been 
linked to the severity of psoriasi s and caloric restriction ameliora tes dermatologic manifestations 
of this disease. The Sack laboratory is studyi ng the effects of caloric  restriction on immune 
activation and is demonstrating the caloric-restriction mimetic v itamin B3 analogue nicotinamide 
riboside (NR) blunts both adaptive  and innate immunity. Furthermore, the in-vitro administration 
of NR to CD4+ T cells extracted from psoriatic subjects bl unts IL-[ADDRESS_792643] 
untreated mild to mo derate psoriasis. 
 
2.2 BACKGROUND 
Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory  skin disease that affects 2–3% of the US population. In addition to 
its skin and joint manifestations, psoriasis predis poses to premature cardiovascular co- morbidities 
in part through immune activ ation and systemic inflamma tion-induced atherosclerosis.1, 2 The skin- 
initiated immune activation thr ough non-professional immune cells  including keratinocytes and 
fibroblasts, initiates and amplif ies innate and adaptive immune ac tivity of monocytes/macrophages, 
neutrophils and their subsets (low -density granulocytes), and effector T-cells (predominantly Th1 
and Th17 subsets) which concurrently exacerbate  local disease and init iate systemic sterile 
inflammation. The centrality of immune activation in psoriasis is reinforced by [CONTACT_599188]-TNF D and anti-IL-17 therapy.3-5 
The contribution of caloric-load to psoriasis has been long debated, how ever, epi[INVESTIGATOR_599171]-analysis data support th at the incidence of obesity  is higher in psoriasis and that the greater the 
severity of psoriasis, the hi gher the incidence of obesity.6-8 The role of caloric excess in the 
pathophysiology of psoriasis is further strengthened  by [CONTACT_599189].9-11 Taken together, these data support that nut rient levels may play a role in the 
pathophysiology of psoriasis and at the same t ime employing strategi es to mimic caloric 
restriction/fasting may contribu te to disease-amelioration. 
The Sack laboratory employs fasting as a model system to investigate immune cell function and 
have identified biological pathways that ex plain how fasting blunts immune activation in 
monocytes/macrophages and CD4+ T cells in both healthy subjects and in those with a mild 
inflammatory disease (steroid-naïve asthma subj ects). More recently we have begun to explore the 
role of a caloric restriction/fasting mimetic , nicotinamide ribosi de (NR – a vitamin B 3 analogue and 
precursor for NAD+ biosynthesis) on immune modulation. Our in itial clinic study using 1000 mg of 
NR daily blunted immune pathways importa nt in CVD both in monocytes and CD4+ T cells, however, 
we did not investigate the ef fects of NR on neutrophils.

Abbreviated Title: NR in psoriasis
Version Date: 07/21/2023
Template version date 07-29-2019Given that these cell types contribute to the pathophysiology of psoriasis and that disease activity
may be ameliorated by [CONTACT_599190], we reasoned that NR may blunt psoriasis-linked immuneactivation pathways. To explore this, a collaboration was established with the Mehta laboratory andthe in-vitro effects of NR were tested on CD4
+ T cells extracted from biologic treatment-naïve
psoriatic subjects. NR was found to b OXQWWKHVHFUHWLRQRI,)1ȖDQG,/ -17, predominantly Th1 and
Th17 cytokines respectively. Because these cytokines are instrumental in the progression of thedermatologic, systemic and vascular consequences in psoriasis, we propose a pi[INVESTIGATOR_599172]ïve, mild to
moderate psoriatic subjects.
Preliminary Data:
To study the effect of NR on T cell function, blood was drawn from psoriatic subjects enrolled
on protocol 13-H-0065 and from matched normal control subjects enrolled on protocol 16-H-0126. Psoriatic subjects were biological anti-immune therapy naïve. Primary peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs) were isolated by [CONTACT_599191]. CD4
+ T cells were then negatively selected 
from PBMCs and cell purity was confirmed at > 95%. 
CD4+ T cells were activated in culture on plates coated with DCD3 and DCD28 antibodies for
3 days in the presence or absence of 0.5mM NR. Alternatively they were differentiated into two T
cell subtypes by [CONTACT_599192] ( ± NR) - Th1 (20 ng/ml IL-12 and
10 Pg/mlDIL-4) and Th17 (20 ng/ml IL-6, 2 ng/ml TGF- E1, 10 ng/ml IL-1 E, 10 ng/ml IL-23, 10 
Pg/ml DIL-4, and 10 Pg/ml DIFNJ). Supernatants were collected, centrifuged to remove cells and
debris, and stored at í& The levels of cytokines, including IL-1 E, IFNJ, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-17,
IL-22, IL-9, IL-2, and MIP-1 Ewere measured by [CONTACT_6428] (R&D Systems). Results were normalizedto
cell number using the CyQuant cell proliferation and BCA protein assays .

DCD28 (n=7). C, D. IFNJ and IL-17 release in differentiated CD4+T cells isolated from Pso riatic subjects (PS) and

differentiation supplement (R&D). PS age (y), 54.43±14.41 (range: 32-72); PS gender, 1 female and 6 males. Healthy 
volunteers (PSC) were paired with the psoriatic subjects for age (± 5 years) and sex. P value *<0.05 and **<0.01. 
 
These data show that NR blunts Th1 and Th17 activation in naïve a nd differentiated T cells and that 
the psoriatic subjects exhibited elev ated IL-17 responsiveness, which is  a consistent signature [CONTACT_599220]. These findings supported the proposal of the following hypothesis. 
 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT 
2.3.1 Known Potential Risks  
Niagen has been sold as a dietary supplement in the [LOCATION_002] since 2003. Labeling guidelines 
recommend consumers to limit their intake to 2 capsules/day (250 mg/d ay). This recommended 
level is the equivalent of 3.8 mg/kg body weight/day, which is 1000-fold less than the highest 
dose determined to be safe and well tolerated in rats, and there is no limit on the duration of 
ingestion. 
 
There is extensive literature on the benefi cial effects of NR in animal models,12, [ADDRESS_792644]  that it should be well tolerated in human s ubjects. In an acute 
toxicology study, rats that were gi ven a single oral dose (5000 mg/kg)  of NR did not show clinical 
signs of toxicity or mortality (unpublished results). The NR dose pr oposed for this study is within 
the doses tested in mice for up to 4 months and is  300-fold below the daily dose that was given in 
rats in a 14-day dose range finder study. There are also accumulating data on the 
pharmacokinetics and safety of orally administe red NR in humans. Recently, a 2 x 6-week 
randomized, double-blind, cross-over study was performed  to assess the tolera bility of chronic NR 
supplementation and its efficacy for increasing NAD+ bioavailabilit y. Here the oral administration 
of NR 500 mg twice daily (total 1000 mg daily,  Niagen, ChromaDex, Inc.) was well tolerated, 
readily absorbed, and detectable in hu man plasma, white blood cells, and urine.14 In a 
pharmacokinetic study of 8 healthy volunteers at the University of Washington, Seattle, the oral 
dose of NR dose was escalated from 250 mg dail y to 1000 mg twice daily  over a 9-day period 
with a resultant 100% in crease in blood NAD+ content that highly correlated to NR levels.[ADDRESS_792645]  with NR treatment was not diffe rent compared with placebo in 
the double-blind study.18 Nicotinamide, an expected metabolite of  NR, is considered to be of low 
toxicity in food by [CONTACT_599194] (FDA) and the European Food Safe ty Authority (EFSA). Clinical trials of 
nicotinamide up to [ADDRESS_792646] not reported  significant adverse effects.19, 20 In addition, doses of 25 and 42 mg/kg 
body weight per day had no effect on a variety of biochemical parame ters including those 
assessing liver a nd kidney function.

 In summary, careful analysis of the available information on NR does not  reveal any potential 
serious toxicity that would preclud e its use in psoriasis subjects. Gi ven the safety and tolerability 
of NR in published human studies,18, 21 and the favorable experience with NR in our NHLBI DIR 
protocol (16-H-0129, discussed in Background section), we propose to test the effect of NR in 
psoriasis patients at a dose [ADDRESS_792647] udy are skin biopsies (o ptional), blood draws, 
and urine collection. The individual study procedure risks are listed below.  
Skin biopsy: Two 4mm or smaller biopsies ma y be collected at visit 1 and visit 2 for a total of 
four skin biopsies. This procedure will be perf ormed under local anesthesia . The entire procedure 
takes approximately 20 minutes. Discomfort at the biopsy site is usually mild and transient. This 
can be treated with minor analgesics. Normally, the risks include a reaction to the local anesthetic 
and the slight possibilities of loca l bleeding or infection. Scarring al ways occurs at the biopsy site. 
 
Phlebotomy: Standard precautions for obtaining human blood samples will be taken. Transient 
discomfort and minor bruising may occur at the phlebotomy site. Vasovaga l symptoms can occur 
during blood drawing. Blood samples will be obtain ed by [CONTACT_48571]. The quantities of blood to 
be drawn for research purposes will be less than 550ml, which is consistent with the CC policy as 
provided in Medical Administrative Series (MAS) 95 -9 (revised 5/29/12): for adults, no more than 
10.5mL/kd or 550ml (whichever is smaller) will be drawn for research purposes over any [ADDRESS_792648] benefit. 
2.3.2 Assessment of Potential Risks and Benefits 
The risks of the study supplemen t and the minor procedures in cluded in this protocol are 
minimal and justified by [CONTACT_599195] a role in the pathophysiology of psoriasis and at th e same time employing 
strategies to mimic ca loric restriction/fasting may contri bute to disease-amelioration. This 
supplement has been employed at the same or higher doses in numerous  studies without any 
reported adverse effects.14, 18, [ADDRESS_792649] of NR on Th17 in the T H17 cell cytokine IL-17 secretion activation in naïve and 
biology in response to T-cell differentiation

4.1 OVERALL DESIGN 
This study is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], prospective, two-arm doubl e-blind, placebo-controlled study where subjects 
immunological profile will be studi ed at baseline and following 4 weeks of supplementation with 
NR or placebo. The allocation of NR: placebo will be 2:1. All enrolled subjects  will receive NR or 
placebo and following [ADDRESS_792651] sufficient 
samples to use RNAseq analysis to explore the effects of NR on T ce ll biology if the primary 
outcome of the study is confirmed. 
 
4.2 JUSTIFICATION FOR DOSE 
Recently, a 2 x 6-week randomized, double-blind, cr oss-over study was performed to assess the 
tolerability of chronic NR supplementation and it s efficacy for increasing NAD+ bioavailability 
by [CONTACT_599196], Boulder.14 They demonstrated that the oral 
administration of NR 500 mg tw ice daily (total 1000 mg dail y, Niagen, ChromaDex, Inc.) was 
well tolerated, readily ab sorbed, and detectable in human pl asma, white blood cells, and urine.

6.2 S TUDY INTERVENTIONS (S) ADMINISTRATION 
6.1.1 Study Intervention Description 
The study will use the dietary supp lement Nicotinamide Riboside or  a placebo capsule. Niagen®is a 
commercially-available form of nico tinamide riboside (NR). The nucle oside NR is a single chemical 
moiety containing nicotinamide and ribose.[ADDRESS_792658] as part of dietary NAD+. T hus, humans are constantly exposed to NR from the diet, albeit at 
low levels. Considering the clinic al investigation is designed to  study the relationship between a 
dietary supplement’s effect on st ructure or function in humans or to characterize the mechanism by 
[CONTACT_9444] a dietary supplement acts to maintain such structure or func tion, this study would not need to 
be conducted under an IND. Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, a 
dietary supplement is not considered  a drug and is not subject to the premarket approval requirements 
for drugs if the intended use for which it is marketed is only to affect the stru cture or any function of 
the body (i.e., not intended to be used for a therapeutic

supplement is determined by [CONTACT_599197]. If the clinical in vestigation is 
intended only to evaluate the di etary supplement’s effect  on the structure or function of the body, an 
IND is not required.

8.4.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAE) 
25 
Abbreviated Title: NR in psoriasis 
Version Date: 07/21/2023 
Template version date 07-29-2019  
 An adverse event (AE) or suspected adverse reacti on is considered "serious " if, in the view of 
either the investigator, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse 
event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or 
significant incapacity or substantia l disruption of the ability to c onduct normal life functions, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect. Im portant medical events that ma y not result in death, be life- 
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_599174], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the part icipant and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of th e outcomes listed in this defin ition. Examples of such medical 
events include allergic bronchospa sm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do no t result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug depe ndency or drug abuse. 
8.4.3 Classification of an Adverse Event 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Severity of Event 
This study will utilize the Common Terminology Cr iteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE 
v5.0) for toxicity and adverse ev ent reporting. A copy of the CTCA E v5.0 can be downloaded from 
the https://ctep.cancer.gov/ protocolDevelopment/electr onic_applicati ons/ctc.htm. 
AEs classified as Grade 2-5 will  be recorded, verified, and follo wed until satisfactory resolution or 
stabilization. In the event of any treatment-rel ated SAEs, enrollment will be suspended until 
discussed with the IRB and Clinical Director.  Grading and attribution of adverse events 
Severity definitions found in the CTCAE v5.0 will be  used for grading the severity (intensity) of 
AEs: 
1) Mild : Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clin ical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated. 
2) Moderate: Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate 
instrumental ADL* 
3) Severe: Severe or medically significa nt but not immediately life- threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_599175]; disabling;  limiting self -care ADL**. 
4) Life- threatening: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 
5) Death: Death related to AE. 
 
*Instrumental ADL refer to prep aring meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_166669], using the 
telephone, managing money, etc.  
**Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Relationship to Study Intervention 
• All Grade 2-5 adverse events (AEs) must have  their relationship to study intervention 
assessed by [CONTACT_599204] a nd evaluates the participant 
based on temporal relationship and his/her cl inical judgment. The degree of certainty 
26 
Abbreviated Title: NR in psoriasis 
Version Date: 07/21/[ADDRESS_792671]. 
• Definitely Related – There is clear evidence to suggest  a causal relationship, and other 
possible contributing factors can  be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal 
laboratory test result, occurs in a plausi ble time relationship to study intervention 
administration and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_113395]. The response to withdrawal of the study intervention (dechallenge) should be 
clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacologically or phenomenologically 
definitive, with use of a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary. 
• Probably Related – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence 
of other factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test 
result, occurs within a reasonable time afte r administration of th e study intervention, is 
unlikely to be attributed to concurrent diseas e or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a 
clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is 
not required to fulfi ll this definition. 
• Potentially Related – There is some evidence to sugge st a causal relationship (e.g., the 
event occurred within a reas onable time after administration of the trial medication). 
However, other factors may have  contributed to the event (e. g., the participant’s clinical 
condition, other concomitant events). Although an  AE may rate only as “possibly related” 
soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more information and later be 
upgraded to “probably related” or “d efinitely related” , as appropriate. 
• Unlikely to be related – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, 
whose temporal relationship to study in tervention administration makes a causal 
relationship improbable (e.g., the event did no t occur within a re asonable time after 
administration of the study intervention) a nd in which other drugs or chemicals or 
underlying disease provides plausible explan ations (e.g., the part icipant’s clinical 
condition, other concom itant treatments). 
• Not Related – The AE is completely independent of study interventi on administration, 
and/or evidence exists that the event is defin itely related to another etiology. There must 
be an alternative, definitive e tiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].] 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Expectedness 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_599176] (AE) is expected 
or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or 
 
frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk informat ion previously described for the study 
intervention. We expect some vasovagal symptoms during blood draws (expected frequency 50%) 
and transient bruising at the site of blood draws (expected frequency 50%). 
 
8.4.4 Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow-Up 
The occurrence of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) may come to the 
attention of study personnel duri ng study visits and interviews of  a study participant presenting 
for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor. 
27 
Abbreviated Title: NR in psoriasis 
Version Date: 07/21/2023 
Template version date 07-29-2019  
 Investigators will assess the occurrence of AEs and SAEs at all patient evaluation time points 
during the study. Grade 2 – 5 AEs/SAEs whethe r volunteered by [CONTACT_102], discovered by [CONTACT_45949], or de tected through physical examin ation, clinically  significant 
laboratory test, or other means will be recorded on the appr opriate case report form. .  
Information to be collected on Grade 2-5 AE/S AE includes event descri ption, time of onset, 
clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assesse d only by [CONTACT_21218] a diagnosis), and time of resoluti on/stabilization of the event. All 
Grade 2-5 AEs will be followed to ad equate resolution or stabilization. 
Abnormal laboratory values not associated with clinical symptoms ( except  for grade 2 elevated liver 
enzymes)  will be evaluated but will not be       considered an AE. The laboratory results will be 
monitored by [CONTACT_599205]. 
Psoriasis is a chronic disease associated with flares and we will record this information in 
the medical record. 
Any medical condition that is pres ent at the time that the part icipant is screened will be 
considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition 
deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE. 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documen ted to allow an assessment of the duration of 
the event at each level of severity to be perfo rmed. AEs characterized as  intermittent require 
documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_599177] 7 days (for non-serious AEs or SA Es) after the last day of study 
participation. At each study visit,  the team member will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs 
since the last visit. Events will be followe d for outcome information until resolution or 
stabilization.  
8.4.5 Adverse Event Reporting 
Grading and attribution of AE’s captured in the database will be determined by [CONTACT_9532] [INVESTIGATOR_599178] e Investigator’s designat ed on the designation log. 
 
8.4.[ADDRESS_792672] include an a ssessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the 
study intervention caused the event. 
All serious adverse events (SAEs) will be followe d until satisfactory resolution or until the site

9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESIS 
Supplementation with NR will blunt systemic imm une activation in mild/moderate psoriasis. 
 
Primary Endpoint(s): The primary ou tcome will be the change in the T H17 cell cytokine IL-17 
secretion in response to T-cell di fferentiation comparing the baseline to NR response after 28 days. 
Exploratory Endpoint(s): 
o Evaluate the effect of NR  on the T cell transcriptome 
o Explore the effect of NR on low-de nsity granulocytes and neutrophils 
9.[ADDRESS_792675] assuming equal 
variances with a two-sided alpha of 0.05 and a 2:1 (unequal) alloca tion of subjects NR: placebo. A 
previous in-vitro study (unpublished to data) yields  data for IL-17 levels  (pg/ml) for T-cells 
extracted from psoriatic subj ects at baseline and after 72 hours of exposure to 0.5 mM 
nicotinamide riboside (NR). The observed mean ch ange in IL-17 cytokine release was 329 pg/ml 
(from 600 to 271 pg/ml) with a stan dard deviation of 185.74 for the 72-hour changes. For the 
proposed in-vivo study, we assume a similar change in mean IL- 17 (and standard deviation) for 
psoriatic subjects treated with NR for [ADDRESS_792676] 98% power to  detect a difference of  329 pg/ml in the mean 
baseline to 4-week changes between the two study groups (scenario 1). Note that there will still be 
82% power to detect a smaller mean differenc e of 229 pg/ml between the two study arms (a 100 
pg/ml difference less than that achieved in the in -vitro study) should the control subjects exhibit 
up to a 100 pg/ml decrease in IL-[ADDRESS_792677] (scenario 2). Furt hermore, even with a 
loss to follow-up of 3 subjects (2 in the NR ar m, 1 on placebo), the study will have 97% power to 
detect a mean change of 329 pg/ml (scenario 3), and a reduced power just under 80% for a strong 
placebo effect with a mean  difference = 229 pg/ml (scenario 4). Therefore, we request approval to 
screen up to a total of 40 subjec ts to account for po ssible treatment non- co mpliance and/or study 
dropouts (18 NR + 9 placebo completi ng study) and to achieve the obj ectives of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].

attendant risks and discomforts and potential be nefits will be carefu lly explained to the 
participant in a private setting. The participant will be given as much time as they need to 
review the document and to c onsult with their family, friends , and personal health care 
providers. In addition, a study team member wi ll be available to answer any questions. 
A signed and dated informed consent document will be obtained by [CONTACT_599208] (See Key Study Personnel Page) prio r to entry onto the study. Consent may be 
obtained with required signatures on the hard co py of the consent  or on the electronic

 document.   
When a document that is in electronic format is used for obta ining  consent, this study may use 
the iMed platform which is 21 CFR, Part 11 compliant, to obtain th e required signatures. 
During the consent process, participants and inve stigators may view the same approved consent 
document simultaneously when participant is bei ng consented in person at the Clinical Center 
or both may view individual c opi[INVESTIGATOR_599180]. Signatures may be  obtained either by [CONTACT_599209] (when in person) or  through iMed Mobile 
Signature [CONTACT_302607]  (remotely) which allows texti ng or emailing a link to the participant. That 
link allows the participant to review the consen t, then proceed to si gn on the device they are 
using. 
Whether hard copy or electronic, both the i nvestigator and the participant will sign the 
document with a hand signature [CONTACT_475474] a pen (if using hard copy), finger, stylus, or mouse (if 
electronic). 
When done remotely, if the partic ipant prefers to sign a hard c opy, they may be instructed to 
sign and date the consent docum ent during the discussion and ma il, secure email or fax the 
signed document to the c onsenting investigator. 
Whether in person or remotely, the privacy  of the participant will be maintained. 
Finally, the fully signed informed consent documen t will be stored in the electronic medical 
record, and the participant will receive a copy of the signed informed consent document.  
The informed consent process will be documented on  a progress note. The date th e signed informed consent 
document was received from the subject and signed by [CONTACT_3433] e consenting investigator w ill be documented in the 
consent progress note.

10.5 CLINICAL MONITORING 
The monitoring of this study will  be conducted by [CONTACT_599217] (CRAs)/monitors 
employed by [CONTACT_599218]. The objectives of a monito ring visit will be: 1) to verify the existence of signed informed 
consent form (ICF) and documentati on of the ICF process for each mo nitored subject; 2) to verify 
the prompt and accurate recording of all monitored data  points, and prompt reporting of all SAEs;  
3) to compare abstracted info rmation with individua l subjects’ records and source documents 
(subject’s charts, laboratory analys es and test results, physicians’ pr ogress notes, nu rses’ notes, and 
any other relevant original subj ect information); and 4) to help ensure investigators are in 
compliance with the protocol. The monitors also w ill inspect the clinical si te regulatory files to 
ensure that regulatory requirements (Office for Hu man Research Protections-OHRP) and applicable 
guidelines (ICH-GCP) are being followed. Monito ring will be conducted according to the OCD 
schedule. During the monitoring visits, the investig ator (and/or designee) and other study personnel 
will be available to discuss the study progress and monitoring visit. 
The investigator (and/or designe e) will make study documents (e.g., consent forms and pertinent 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_599184] y available for inspection by [CONTACT_1036], the site monitors, and 
the NHLBI staff for confir mation of the study data.

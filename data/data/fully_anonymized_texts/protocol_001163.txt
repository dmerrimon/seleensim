Study Title  
Peppermint Oil (PMO ) Pharmacok inetics  (PK) and Pharmacodynamics ( PD) and Novel Biological Signatures 
in Children with Functional Abdominal Pain  (FAP) 
 
Objectives  
In children 7 -12 years of age with FAP (n=30) determine:  
Aim 1 - PK of PMO (menthol)  
Sub-Aim: YP2A6 and UGT2B7 genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  (exploratory)  
Aim 2 – PD of PMO  as assessed by [CONTACT_109704]:   
a) Microbiome composition (16S RNA sequencing)  
b) Transit rate/contractile activity (using the SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]®)   
 
Design and Outcomes   
An initial single -dose  PK study of PMO in 30 children with FAP  will be carried out using a 3 -fold dosing range 
(180, 360, and 540 mg - 10 children per dose).  
Following the single -dose PK study, a PD study  will be carried out wherein the subjects will receive their 
assigned dose of PMO for 7 days administered thrice daily.  
In a subset of subjects, on day 7 steady state menthol concentrations will be measured  for the purpose of 
assessing steady state PK and PK/PD relationships . 
Gut microbiome composition and a SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]® study (gut contractility and transit time) will be carried out before 
and after administration of the PMO during the PD study.  
 
Intervention s and Duration  
Randomization to one of three dose s of PMO administered orally and PK measured over [ADDRESS_121579] Guidelines and Considerations  5 of 50 Version 1. 4

2. BACKGROUND A ND RATIONALE  
2.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus  
1) Importance of the Problem  – Worldwide, 10 -15% of children and adults up through the geriatric age 
range experience chronic intermittent abdominal pain without a clear etiology, classifying them as functional 
abdominal pain gastrointestinal ( GI) disorders ( FGID ).9-[ADDRESS_121580] common 
of these in children being irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional abdominal pain ( FAP).16,17 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_109641] (e.g., FAP vs. IBS) it is well established that in children and adults, symptoms may overlap 
between subcategories of FGIDs and/or patients may transition from one subcategory to another over time.18,[ADDRESS_121581] abdominal pain a mean of 7 
times/wk.; these pain epi[INVESTIGATOR_109642] 24% of the time.16 A large body of data shows that 
up to 60% of child ren have similar pain as adults.22-[ADDRESS_121582] of adult IBS care alone in the US 
is enormous with total costs reaching $30 billion yearly.25   
2) Barriers to Progress  – Despi[INVESTIGATOR_109643], there are few effective 
pharmacologic treatmen ts. In part because of the paucity of effective treatments, at least 15 -50% of patients with 
FGIDs employ complementary and alternative treatments such as botanicals like peppermint oil ( PMO ).26-[ADDRESS_121583] also recruited children  with FAP  (J. Kline, personal 
communication 5/2007).  Unfortunately this study had issues with lack of clarity of: what defined significant 
improvement; how diaries were analyzed; and lacked presentation of data on symptoms.29 Importantly, there are 
no studies of appropriate dosing of PMO in pediatric patients. Thus, future clinical tri als need to be based on 
pharmaco -kinetic/dynamic (PKD) data and the relationship between drug concentration and biological effects 
(signatures)  to increase the likelihood of treatment benefit while reducing side effects . In previous PMO studies  
in adults o nly half of patients respond to treatment.30,[ADDRESS_121584] treatment 
response; specifically whether this may be dose related.  
Different pathophysiologic changes are likely responsible for symptom generation in different patients with 
FAP (see below). Thus, PMO may or may not be effective depending on its effects on the GI tract and the specific 
GI abnormalities in an individual pati ent. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_109644], few data 
are available in humans regarding its effects on gut function. Improving scientific knowledge of the  pharmacokinetics (PK) 
and pharmacodynamics ( PD) and their relationships to biological signatures (e.g., effects on gut microbiome 
composition, gut transit time, gut contractility) will allow treatment to be tailored to individual patients.  For 
example, PMO would be anticipated to be effective in a pa tient with gut dysbiosis if it normalizes the gut 
microbiome composition but is unlikely to be effective in a patient in whom psychosocial distress is primarily 
operative.   
3) Emerging View of the Etiologies of FAP : With the launch of the Human Microbiome Pr oject, attention has 
increasingly focused on the Microbiota -Brain -Gut Axis model  to illuminate the pathobiology of FGIDs such as 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  [ADDRESS_121585] interplay between abnormalities in the composition of the GI bacterial population 
(dysbiosis), motility disturbances, impaired gut barrier function (a s reflected by [CONTACT_109705]), 
altered mucosal and systemic immune responses, and psychosocial distress leading to the symptoms of FAP 
(Figure 1). In an individual patient, one or more factors may be primarily contributory.  
 
 
• Altered GI Bacterial Population in children with FGIDs  –  
 
Our recent work and that of others suggest that the composition of the GI microbiome (defined as bacteria, 
their genomes and interaction with the host) differs between children with FGIDs and healthy individuals.33-37 We 
made the novel observation that the composition was related to severity o f abdominal pain symptoms and 
stooling characteristics.33,36 Gammaproteobacteria are increased in abundance in children with FGIDs and this 
class contains known pathogens.33,38 Visceral hyperalgesia is a common finding in children and adults with FAP 
which may be related to GI microbiome composition.39-42 Some commensal GI microbes are responsible for 
inflammation -related gut hyperalgesia whereas others can downregulate afferent pain from the gut.43-45 Indeed, 
visceral hypersensitivity, can be induced in a mouse by [CONTACT_109706] a patient with a FGID 
(but not from a healthy individual).46 
A variety of bacteria directly up - and/or down -regulate cytokine and innate immune responses, some by 
[CONTACT_109707] -like receptors (Figure 1).47-49 These pro - or anti -inflammatory changes can impair gut barrier 
function (increase GI permeability). Inflammation also can affect the function of gut smooth muscle  and enteric 
nerves resulting in clinical symptoms of dysmotility (see below).50,[ADDRESS_121586] behavior and anxiety 
levels in mice; effects mediated via the vagus nerve.54,[ADDRESS_121587] higher Beck depression scores than those without malabsorption and that administration of 
probiotics alters brain processing in humans based on magnetic resonance imaging.56,57 These data underscore 
the potential contribution of the GI microbiome not only to abdominal pain but also the psychosocial distress 
often seen in FAP.    
• Dysmotility in FAP  - Some adult and p ediatric patients with FAP have gastric, small bowel, and/or colonic 
dysmotility.58,[ADDRESS_121588]. Therefore, it is critical to determine if dysmotility 
exists and if so, what type, in a specific patient and thus, whether a treatment (e.g., PMO) is likely to correct (or 
worsen) the physiological abnormality. Such data are critical to designing cl inical trials and ultimately, indications 
for treatments.      
 
Figure 1 . Modification of Rodríguez -Fandiño1 et 
al.’s updated version of Drossman’s2-4 
biopsychosocial model ofFAP takes into account 
recent investigations of pathobiological markers. 
These disorders can develop from centrally 
domina nt factors (e.g., stress) or luminal factors 
(e.g., alterations in the GI microbial composition) 
triggering impaired gut barrier function and low 
grade gut inflammation. Gut barrier function also 
may be influenced by [INVESTIGATOR_7009].5 Stress can alter GI 
motility thereby [CONTACT_109708]/exacerbation. All these factors 
contribute to the visceral hyperalgesia commonly 
found in IBS/FAP.6-[ADDRESS_121589] Guidelines and Considerations  7 of 50 Version 1. 4

 2.2 Study Rationale  
Describe the scientific and medical data (e.g., results of observational studies and early clinical 
trials) that justifies the study, its design, and the intervention groups. Include any data  from animal 
and human studies relevant to mechanism of action, effect size, and possible effects of the 
intervention on selected outcomes.   
Name [CONTACT_109762](s) and justify why the interventio n(s) have been 
chosen.  Describe and justify the route of administration, dosage regimen, intervention period, 
frequency and intensity,  etc. Summarize the known and potential risks of the interventions.  
    
Peppermint is a perennial flowering plant that grows throughout Europe and North America. Peppermint 
(Mentha × pi[INVESTIGATOR_109645]) is a (usually) sterile hybrid mint, a cross between Water mint ( Mentha aquatica ) and 
Spearmint ( Mentha spi[INVESTIGATOR_109646] ) that is believed to have arisen naturally. Mint plants have a lon g history of medicinal 
use, dating to ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome where they were used as stomach soothers. PMO is on the 
GRAS list as determined by [CONTACT_1622].  
 
The main constituent and active ingredient of PMO is menthol.61,62 Studies in both rats and humans 
demonstrate that PMO is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_109647].61,63 However, 
when taken in capsule form designed for delayed release approximately 70% reaches the colon.63 30,31,64  
 
The use of peppermint oil is ubiquitous, with nearly 6 million pounds produced in the US in 2014 
(www.statista.com ), Mint (active ingredient menthol) has been used to treat abdominal ailments dating to ancient 
civilizations.[ADDRESS_121590] shown that PMO is efficacious in the treatment of functional 
gastr ointestinal pain disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome.30,31,66 -70 One randomized, double blind trial has 
shown it to be effective in children with irritable bowel syndrome and functional abdominal pain (personal 
communication with the investigator revealed that both types of conditions were studied).[ADDRESS_121591] in treating functional abdominal pain disorders.  
 
• Antimicrobial/Antifungal Actions  - Multiple studies h ave shown that PMO (menthol) is one of the most 
potent antimicrobial/antifungal/antiviral botanicals.[ADDRESS_121592] 20 commo n enteric pathogens 
including Helicobacter pylori, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus , Klebsiella sp., Salmonella typhi , Shigella 
boydii , and Shigella flexneri .76-79   
 
• Effects on GI Tract Motor Function  - Evidence suggests that PMO can act as a smooth muscle relaxant.[ADDRESS_121593] PMO reverses acetylcholine induced contraction and antagonizes serotonin -induced contraction 
through calcium channel blockade.81 In humans the GI response to PMO remains unclear, likely related to the 
wide range in doses us ed (>6 -fold). For example, in two studies PMO accelerated gastric emptying in adults, in 
one study had no effect, and in another decreased the gastric motility index.71,[ADDRESS_121594] 
regarding PMO’s effects on small intestinal motility, again likely related to differences in dosing.83,85,86 
 
• Effects on GI Tract Visceral Sensation  - Visceral hyperalgesia contributes to the symptoms of functional 
gastrointestinal pain disorders in adults and children. Although PMO (via menthol) is a well-known topi[INVESTIGATOR_34481], rodent studies show that PMO can decrease visceral pain when administered orally or 
intraperitoneally.87-[ADDRESS_121595] that the reduction in visceral pain is mediated through the TRPM8 
and/or TRPA1 receptor of the transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channel superfamily located in the gut.90-
[ADDRESS_121596] Guidelines and Considerations  8 of 50 Version 1. 4 
  15 November 2017  
 • Effects on Inflammation  - Studies demonstrate that PMO (menthol) possesses anti -inflammatory activity. 
Xylene induced inflammation in mice is prevented by [CONTACT_109709].87 In vitro, menthol suppresses 
the production of inflammatory mediator s from human monocytes at clinically relevant concentrations.94 Immune 
cells also contain transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channels and it is believed that the anti -inflammatory 
effects of PMO may be mediated, in part, via TRPM8 as activatio n downregulates chemically induced colitis in 
mouse models.95,96 Patients with functional gastrointestinal pain disorders ofte n show evidence of low grade 
gastrointestinal inflammation. Thus, PMO may alleviate this inflammation to some degree.  
 
• Effects on Behavior  - Studies in humans demonstrated that inhalation of peppermint aroma improves 
attention but whether it improves mood  remains unclear.97-[ADDRESS_121597] been 
no studies evaluating its PKD in pediatric patients. Thus, there is no scientific basis upon which to derive effective 
dosing regimens for PMO in pediatric patients which will generate local and/or systemic exposure of menthol 
previously associated with putative beneficial effects in adults with FAP or IBS. Only an old, small (n=6) study in 
adults examined the pharmacokinetics alone of the enteric coated form of PMO and only urine menthol was 
measured.[ADDRESS_121598] 
relationship for PMO.  
 
Although clinical (albeit imperfect) data support the use of PMO in IBS, only one study has evaluated 
whether PMO is effective for treating FAP.105 Asgarshirazi et al. randomized children with FAP to treatment 
with PMO, a synbiotic, or placebo.105 Per protocol results (n=88) showed those in the PMO group to have the 
greatest reduction in abdominal pain symptoms compared with the other groups. However, interpretation of the 
study is limited by [CONTACT_109710] (see above).[ADDRESS_121599], it is conceivable it would be effective in FAP as some data (albeit imperfect) suggest 
potential efficacy for other antispasmodics in FAP in children and adults.106-108 Thus, as in the case of IBS, well 
designed, rigorous clinical trials are needed to determine the efficacy of PMO in FAP based on PKD data and 
the response to biological signatures of the disorder.  
 
We propose to carry out our studies in - children – a population who frequently are overlooked in 
determining therapeutic dosing. Our results are likely to move science forward significantly because we will be 
able to dose PMO based on PKD rather than extrapolating from adult dosing as is done now. For the PK study 
we will administer the PMO in the doses (180, 360, 540 mg) used for many years to treat patients, including 
those with irritable bowel syndrome and FAP. We propose to study a total of 30 subjects assigned to three 
different (3 -fold) doses (180, 360, 540 mg; 10 children per dose). This “three dose” approach in ligh t of the 
anticipated range of body weights in the study cohort would produce a dynamic, > 3 -fold range in systemic 
exposure to PMO (e.g., AUC of menthol).  For the PD study the subjects will continue on the same dose ( 180 
once, twice or three times daily) for a total of 7 days.  
Potential Risks  
Menthol is listed as generally regarded as safe by [CONTACT_3133] ( FDA).  The 
European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) recently released their assessment and recommendations regarding PMO:

Few adverse events have been reported in PMO trials.30,67   In those studies reporting adverse events, 
no differences were noted between PMO and placebo groups except in the study by [CONTACT_109711]. in which 
heartburn was more common in the PMO vs placebo group; however the efficacy of the enteric coating use d in 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  9 of 50 Version 1. 4 
  15 November 2017  
 this study of 30 years ago is unknown. In theory, enteric coated formulations of PMO allow for release of PMO 
distal to the stomach – thereby [CONTACT_109712].  30,[ADDRESS_121600] been identified in the cerebellum in some rat studies but not others at doses of ≥ 
40 mg·kg-1·d-1.[ADDRESS_121601] been considered to be 
potentially toxic in high doses.  In a rat study, ≥ 80 mg·kg-1·d-1 of pulegone was associate d with vacuolization of 
hepatocytes.109  In a more recent series of studies from the National Toxicology Program, liver necrosis and 
cytoplasmic vacuolization were only seen in rats given ≥150 mg·kg-1·d-[ADDRESS_121602] hyperplasia, hepatocyte focal necrosis and hypert rophy and renal 
glomerulopathy were only seen at doses ≥75 mg·kg-1·d-[ADDRESS_121603], mice were more resistant to 
the effects than were rats with doses of 300 mg·kg-1·d-1 of pulegone required to see hepatic injury at 2 weeks.111  
The EMA statement points out that “prevailing opi[INVESTIGATOR_109648] i n humans are 
associated with the use of peppermint oil or mint oil.” In a case report of suspected to have ingested PMO in a 
suicide attempt, although comatose on arrival, she recovered without evidence of hepatic or renal injury.112 
 
In a 2 -year study in rats, pulegone was associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer at a 150 
mg·kg-1·d-[ADDRESS_121604], in a 2 -year study of mice, an increased risk for hepatoblastoma was found at the 
75 mg·kg-1·d-1 dose but not at the 150 mg·kg-1·d-1 dose in males with no increased risk in females.111 The EMA 
statement posits that “non -relevance of rodent neoplasms to human carcinogenesis seems probable” in part, 
because of the long term sustained exposure required and doses which are not relevant in human situations.  
 
The amount of pulegone in PMO can be reduced depending on how the peppermint is grown, when it is 
harvested, and how it is proce ssed.113 PMO normally contains a  maximum of 0.1% pulegone and its metabolite 
menthofuran according to the European Pharmacopoeia (and more commonly 0.03 -0.07%). As likely would be 
used to treat FGIDs in adults, the EMA statement proposes for adults a maximum intake of 1.5 mg·kg-1·d-1 of 
pulegone and menthofuran combined up to a maximum of 75 mg/day. The maximum usual dose of PMO used 
to treat FGIDs such as IBS is 540 mg/d which would deliver [ADDRESS_121605] en to understand how these recommendations might 
apply to the pediatric population.

 Subjects will visit the Children's Nutrition Research Center ( CNRC ) for  Study  Visit 1 (see Table 1. Study 
Timeline , below ). Informed consent and assent will be obtained and they will complete questionnaires 
(demographics, medical history,  modified pediatric Rome III questionnaire  (or Rome IV if available and 
validated) , the BASC -3,the CSI, FDI and the PCS ).   
Subjects  will swallow  a SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]® during the visit immediately after ingesting a standardized meal (SmartBar®) 
to measure gut contractility and transit time.  If the subject is unable to swallow the SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] , they still may be 
allowed to continue in the study  as the discretion of the PI.  The SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]® capsule has been used previously in 
this age range in studying children with abdominal pain in addition to other diso rders. We have previously used 
a similar sized pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_47281]®) in similarly aged children with functional gastrointestinal pain disorders without 
issue in our previous  study (RC2 NR011959). Subjects  will wear a recorder on a lanyard or belt clip for [ADDRESS_121608] SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]® data. They will keep a 5 -day Event Dairy while wearing the recorder.  The recorder and any 
other study materials will be returned by [CONTACT_30367].   
  
Study Visit 1  to Study Visit 2  (60 days allowable)  
 
Prior to Study Visit 2, subjects  will receive a call to schedule the overnight study. The subjects will receive  
information on medications to stop 5-10 days before the 2nd SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]®Test, and SmartBar® Meal or alternative 
meal .  
Subject s will be asked to discontinue all PMO  products at least  [ADDRESS_121609] 8 hours before Study Visit 2.   
Subjects who do not complete the Baseline procedures within 8 weeks of Study Visit 2 will be required to 
repeat them prior to Study Visit 2.  
 
Study Visit 2  
 
At Study Visit 2 , subjects  they will come to the CNRC. A general physical examination will be performed 
by [CONTACT_21114] [INVESTIGATOR_5768] -investigator. Height, weight, and vital signs (pulse and respi[INVESTIGATOR_109651], and blood 
pressure) will be obtained. After application of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_109652] -related blood 
sampling, a cannula will  be inserted to obtain repeated blood samples. A maximum of three attempts will be 
made to place the cannula. A maximum of two attempts will be made to replace the cannula should it become 
dislodged. After obtaining a 2 mL baseline blood sample, children w ill be randomized to receive either 180 (83mg 
menthol equivalent), 360, or 540 mg of  PMO .  
A 0 time point (pre -dose) blood sample (2 mL) will be obtained to measure total menthol concentration and 
for isolation of genomic DNA that will be used to determine  CYP2A6  and UGT2B7  genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. The PMO used 
is a commercially available, proprietary, nonprescription enteric coated product available over the counter 
(Peptogest®, Nature’s Way Products, LLC, Lehi, UT) and deemed GRAS (generally regarded as safe) by [CONTACT_1556]. 
At approximately 0900, subjects will receive their assigned single oral dose of PMO. Ingestion of the dose 
will be followed by [CONTACT_109716] [ADDRESS_121610] SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]® Test, will be 
given the 2nd SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]® Test after ingesting the assigned PMO dose . Repeated venous blood samples (1.5 mL 
each) will be obtained at the following time points: 1, 2, 2.5, 3,  4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, [ADDRESS_121611] dosing . 
Based upon our previous pi[INVESTIGATOR_109653], the aforementioned sampling scheme will 
enable us to capture both the absorption phase of menthol and also, adequately characterize the apparent 
elimination of the drug from plasma (e.g., > 4 times average menthol elimination half -life of 3.0 hours).115 It is 
also consistent with the approach outlined in the current FDA guidance (General Clinical Pharmacology 
Considerations for Pediatric Studies for Drugs and Biological Products:  Guidance for Industry, U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services, Food  and Drug Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research; 
December 2014 ).  Namely, for drugs that do not have extensive pharmacokinetic data in pediatric patients, to 
utilize “rich” sampling schemes sufficient to accurately describe the pharmacoki netics of an active 
pharmaceutical ingredient after a single  dose so as to facilitate understanding of the variability in the dose vs. 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  12 of 50 Version 1. 4 
  15 November 2017  
 systemic exposure relationship.  As described in this FDA Guidance, a non -compartmental approach will be 
used to derive i mportant pharmacokinetic parameter estimates (e.g., AUC, apparent elimination rate constant, 
apparent oral plasma clearance) for menthol.  
Six hours after SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]® Test administration, participants will be given a standardized meal and will eat 
ad libitum  thereafter. The subjects  will be restricted from any strenuous physical exercise.  
After completion of the final (24 -hour) blood sample, vital signs will be reassessed, the venous cannula 
removed, and the insertion site evaluated for redness, swelling and/or bruising. At this point, all subjects will 
continue taking the PMO at their rando mized dose for 7 days. The subjects will be given a 14-day supply of the 
assigned randomized dose of PMO  with instructions on use. Although administration of the PMO ideally is 
designated to be for 7 days, the additional days  (up to 14 days total ) are prov ided recognizing that not all subjects 
may be able to return for Study Visit 3 at exactly 7 days. The SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]® test, stool collection, diet history , 
pain/stool diary, (i.e., baseline studies)  will be repeated while on the PMO (see below - Study Visit 2 to Study 
Visit 3 and Table  1). Subjects also will receive instructions on filling out the Adverse Event form.  
Arrangements will be made to set up for Study Visit 3. It is recognized that not al l subjects may be willing 
to participate in Study Visit 3. Subjects  then will be sent home.  
 
Study Visit 2  to Study Visit 3  
 
Subjects  will take the PMO capsules at the same dose they were initially randomized to for the Day 0 PK 
study evaluation ( i.e., 180 mg once daily, 180 mg twice daily, 180 mg thrice daily ). Ideally,  
Subjects will again keep the pain/stooling diary and also be instructed to report any potential adverse 
effects or healthcare utilization using a designated [ADDRESS_121612]-withdrawal.  
Subjects will again keep the SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]®  Event D iary [ADDRESS_121613] a stool sample and complete a 3 -Day Diet History .  A courier will be sent to up 
the recorder and the stool sample.  
All participants will be encouraged to complete all study measures while taking PMO through day 7 and 
provide a blood sample during study visit 3 after 6 -14 days of PMO ingestion (at the randomized dosage). At the 
end of Study Visit 2, staff will d ocument whether the parent and participant are willing to have blood collected at 
study visit [ADDRESS_121614] blood drawn (1.5 mL) 
immediately pr ior to their dose and then again either 3 or 4 hours after their dose to assess steady state 
pharmacokinetics of menthol (e.g., to assess whether there is unexpected accumulation in the dose vs. plasma 
concentration profile) and to enable a linked PK/PD an alysis of menthol at steady state conditions.  This approach 
is consistent with that recommended in the current FDA draft guidance describing clinical pharmacology 
considerations for pediatric studies (see aforementioned citation to December 2014 FDA draft  guidance 
document).   
A phone call will be made to the subjects to inquire about any potential adverse effects  following completion 
of the PMO dosing .

of Medicine Research website.  
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  17 of 50 Version 1. 4 
  15 November 2017  
 A Screening Log  will be kept:  
• All subjects screened  will be recorded: subject initials, date of birth, date of screen, results of screen (qualify 
or do not qualify and reason for disqualification)  
• A subject will be  disqualified  if they do not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• Subjects declining participation  will be considered disqualified  
 
Informed consent procedures:   
All aspects of the protocol will be explained in depth to the subjects and parent/guardian. Subjects will 
receive a written copy of the consent form. Assent will be obtained from the child and c onsent from the 
parent/guardian. The research coordinator will explain the protocol to the parent/guardian and then explain the 
protocol to the child. The procedures will be explained in terms that a 7 -year-old child can understand. Adequate 
time will be p rovided for questions from both the parent/guardian and the child. Questions will be answered in 
terms that a 7 -year-old child can understand.  
Randomization procedure for assigning a participant to an intervention group : 
      
• Prior to randomization for the PK study, all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be verified to ensure the 
potential participant qu alifies for study enrollment  
• A dosing randomization scheme from www.randomizat ion.com  and stratified by [CONTACT_109720]  
• The subject will be assigned a participant ID number and a PMO dose as determi ned by [CONTACT_109721]  
• Participant ID number will consist of the three letters “PMO ” followed by a 3 -digit number t hat will be 
assigned sequentially as participants are enrolled. For example: The first participant enrolled will be 
assigned PMO -001 and enrollees will be assigned numbers sequentially thereafter .  
• The participant will retain their unique participant ID number throughout the study  
• The study coordinator will complete the “PMO  Randomization Assignment List Form denoting whethe r the 
subject is male or female  
• The information on the Randomization Assignment List Forms will include:  participant initials , ID numb er, 
birthdate, date dose assigned, and the assigned dose    
• The completed PMO Assignment List Forms will be kept in the Essential Documents/Regulatory Binder in 
the study coor dinator’s locked file cabinet  
• Once a participant is randomized, the ID number will  not be reassigned or reissued to a new participant.  If 
a subject drops out or withdraws before the randomized PMO dose is administered, the same dose will be 
given to the next sex-appropriate participant.  
STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
5.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration   
Aims 1 and 2  
 
PMO  capsules (Peptogest ) will be obtained from the manufacturer using a single lot number. The 
manufacturer will provide the investigators with an assessment of potency and active ingredient ( PMO/ menthol ) 
content in the product. An IND will be approved by [CONTACT_109722].  
 
Aim 1 – PK Study  
 
Study Visit [ADDRESS_121623] (Peptogest , Nature’s Way  
Products, LLC, Lehi, UT). Children will be randomized to receive one dose of either 180 (83  mg menthol 
equivalent), 360, or 540 mg of PMO. Ingestion of the dose will be followed by [CONTACT_109723] 120  mL of water.  
Immediately prior to and after PMO administration, repeated blood samples (1.5mL each) will be obtained 
directly into green top glass tubes contain sodium heparin  (Vacutainer, Becton Dickinson, East Rutherford, NJ) 
at the following time points: 0 (pre -dose),1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18 and 24 hours.   Based upon our pi[INVESTIGATOR_109657] i n pediatric patients,115 the aforementioned sampling scheme will enable us to capture both 
the absorption phase of menthol and also, adequately characterize the apparent elimination of the drug from 
plasma (e.g., > 4 times average menthol elimination half -life of 3.0 hours).  
Two hours after PMO administration, participants will be given a standardized meal and will eat ad libitum 
thereafter. The study participant will be restricted from any strenuous physical exercise.  
After completion of the final (24 -hour) blood sample, vital si gns will be reassessed, the venous cannula 
removed, and the insertion site will be evaluated for redness, swelling and/or bruising. Parents will receive a 
followup call from the research coordinator the following day to access/evaluate if any adverse effec ts were 
experienced.  
  At Study Visit [ADDRESS_121624]  1.5 mL of blood drawn prior to and either 3 or 4 hours 
after a dose of PMO  at the end of the study (final PMO doses) . These blood samples will be obtained by 
[CONTACT_48571].  This will  be the last PK study blood draw taken during day 6 -14 of PMO dosing.  
 
Aim 2 – PD Study  
 
Following completion of the PK study described in Aim 1, children will be sent home to continue on  their 
assigned dose of PMO for [ADDRESS_121625] 
and dinner and those who received 540  mg will take 180 mg thrice daily ([ADDRESS_121626], lunch, 
and dinner).  
 
 
5.2 Handling of Study Interventions   
The PMO capsules will be sent to the investigator in sealed bottles by [CONTACT_109724] (between 68  - 77°F) as recommended by [CONTACT_3455]. The PMO capsules will be placed in a 
locked cabinet with access available only to the investigator and study staff. The PMO capsules will be dispensed 
by [CONTACT_9137]. For the PK study the capsules will be pla ced in a small plastic bag labeled with the 
randomization number, the subject ID number, the subject initials, date dispensed, and the number of capsules 
assigned. For the PD study the capsules for the [ADDRESS_121627] Compliance  
• Subjects will be advised how to store and administer their daily capsules  
• Subjects will be asked to complete the PMO -Daily Use Form  by [CONTACT_109725] d time the capsules 
were taken  
• If the capsules were not taken, the subject will record the reason  
• The subjects will be asked to return the bottle with any unused capsules at the end of the study  
 
Study Product Accountability  
Inventory will be recorded as will capsules dispensed. Data will be kept as to who dispensing the capsules, 
the number of capsules dispensed, to whom they are dispensed, date, and time.   The study coordinator will 
complete the  “PMO  Investigator Study  Product Accountability Form” and “PMO  Patient  Study Product 
Accountability  Form ”  and the “ PMO  Capsule Inventory Log  for each subject.

6.2.2  Enrollment, Baseline, and/or Randomization  
Enrollment  
The subject will be considered enrolled once they have passed screening and the consent/assent form has 
been signed. Enrollment will be documented on the Enrollment Log.  
     
Baseline Assessments  
• Demographics  
• Medical  history  
• Physical examination  
• Vital Signs  
• Height and weight  
• Concomitant medications  
• 3-Day diet history  
• Pain/stooling diary  
• Gut microbiome composition  
• Gut contractility/transit time via SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]  
• Rome III Questionnaire  
• BASC -3 
• CSI 
• FDI 
• PCS 
 
Randomization  
After completing  the baseline assessment  the subjects will undergo the PK study at which time they will be 
randomized to one of three doses of PMO: 180, 360, or [ADDRESS_121631] Guidelines and Considerations  24 of 50 Version 1. 4 
  15 November 2017  
 6.2.3  Blinding  
This is an open label study. However, the investigator s responsible for analyzing the PK data (Dr s. Kearns  
and Garg ) will be blinded to the dose assignment of the subject. Similarly, the investigator responsible for 
analyzing the gut microbiome and contractility/transit time data will be blinded to the dose assignment of the 
subject as well as the timing of the me asurements (i.e., pre - versus post -treatment with PMO). Data only will be 
identified by [CONTACT_109732]/data are 
analyzed.  
Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_109661]. The code will be 
broken once the study analyses are complete. The blind may be broken should data be required to investigate 
an adverse event. The blind will be broken by [CONTACT_109733].  
 
6.2.4 Followup  Visits  
There are no followup visits as such. Subjects who do not participate in the steady state studies (Study 
Visit 3)   will have their last visit to the CNRC at the time of the PK study. Those subjects willing to participate in 
the steady state studies at Study Visit 3  will return to the CNRC for the study . Activities  to be carried out after 
Study Visit 2 are shown in Table 1.  These will include a followup call to assess for AE and pi[INVESTIGATOR_109662].  
 
6.2.5 Completion/ Final Evaluation  
See above (6.2.4)  
 
Potential reasons for early termination  of subject from the study  
• If any of the exclusion criteria dev elop in the course of the study  
• If a serious adverse event occurs during the study  
• If the subject withdraws from the study or is withdrawn by [CONTACT_093]   
  
7. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
 
Given the safety profile of PMO, it is not anticipated that (serious) adverse events directly related to the 
PMO will occur. Theoretically the following are possible following PMO ingestion:  
• Allergic reactions – will be managed by [CONTACT_109734]  
• Anal/perianal burning or discomfort – will be managed by [CONTACT_109735], administering the PMO closer to meal time,  use of skin barriers such as petroleum jelly, 
or if severe enough/unresponsive to the previous  manipulations, discontinuation of the product  
• Heartburn - will be managed depending on severity, by [CONTACT_109735], advising that the subject should not lay down for an hour after PMO administration, 
administering the PMO closer to meal time, the addition of antacids, or if severe 
enough/unresponsive to the previous manipulations, discontinuation of the product  
• Nausea - will be managed depending on severity, by [CONTACT_109736], 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  [ADDRESS_121632] should not lay down for an hour after PMO administration, administering 
the PMO closer to meal time, the addition of antacids, or if severe eno ugh/unresponsive to the 
previous manipulations, discontinuation of the product

Menthol is listed as generally regarded  as safe by [CONTACT_3133] ( FDA).  The 
European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) recently released their assessment and recommendations regarding PMO 
(see below).[ADDRESS_121635] been reported in PMO trials.  In those studies reporting adverse events (see 
Table below ), no differences were noted between PMO and placebo groups except in the study by [CONTACT_109711].

statement posits that “non -relevance of rodent neoplasms to human carcinogenesis seems probable” in part, 
because of the long term sustained exposure required and doses which are not relevant in human situations.  
The amount of pulegone in PMO can  be reduced depending on how the peppermint is grown, when it is 
harvested, and how it is processed.113 PMO normally contains a maximum of 0.1% pulegone and its metabolite 
menthofuran according to the European Pharmacopoeia (and more commonly 0.03 -0.07%). The EMA statement 
proposes a li fe-long exposure acceptable dose of 0.75 mg·kg-1·day-1.116  As likely would be used to  treat FGIDs 
(oral use for less than one year or intermittently over several years) in adults, the EMA statement proposes an 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  26 of 50 Version 1. 4 
  15 November 2017  
 acceptable exposure of pulegone plus menthofuran to be 75 mg/day.116  The maximum usual dose of PMO used 
to treat FGIDs such as IBS is 540 mg/d which would deliver 0.54 mg of pulegone and menthofuran combined.  
Thus, in summary, PMO has an excellent safety profile backed up by [CONTACT_109738]  (Table 2) .

7.3 Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Events  
ICH-E2A defines an AE as “any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any  unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product.”  
The occurrence of an AE may come to th e attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews 
of a study recipi[INVESTIGATOR_12189], or upon review by a study monitor. Subjects will use a daily 
“Adverse Events Diary” to capture events to report. This will be kept while the  PMO is being given.  All adverse 
events will be recorded on the attached Adverse Event Record.  Information to be collected includes event 
description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product, and time of 
resolutio n/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study will be documented appropriately regardless 
of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution. Any medical condition that is present at the time 
that the patient is screened will  be considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if it deteriorates 
at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  All AEs will be graded for severity and relationship to 
study product. See attached Adverse Event Record.

Relationship to Study Product:    
The investigator’s assessment of an AE's relationship to test article is part of the documentation process, 
but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. If there is any doubt as to whether a 
clinical observation is an AE, the event will be reported. All AEs will have their relationship to study product 
assessed using the terms: Not Related, Possibly/ related, Related/associated, Research Rela ted. 
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
ICH-E2A defines Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or Reaction as untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does 
not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a con genital anomaly/birth defect  
 
Subjects will keep a daily log of any adverse effects; hence, they  will have the opportunity to report AEs 
and intercurrent illness at any time during the study. In addition, there is a [ADDRESS_121644] messages for the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_67880]. The consent 
form will include the paging operato r number for the pediatric gastroenterology physicians (as well as the 
principal investigator). The paging service is available [ADDRESS_121645]’s as a whole. Where clinically 
indicated, a laboratory or other test may be ordered to assess a reported adverse event, in which case, the 
laboratory normal value will be used an interpreted in a clinical context (i.e., an elevation immediately outside 
the normal range (but within 3 SD of normal) may be interpreted as normal.  
As noted above, AEs will be collected throughout the [ADDRESS_121646]’s primary healthcare provider, pediatric gastroenterologist , and or  the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_874] [ADDRESS_121647]’s record.   
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  [ADDRESS_121648]’s permission, information on adverse events will be communicated to the primary care 
healthcare provider  for additional followup.   
Follow up through resolution of the adverse event and for one m onth after completion of the study protocol 
will be provided in person or  by [CONTACT_109739].  
AEs judged by [CONTACT_109740]/related, Related/associated, or Research Related will be 
reported the Data Safety Monitoring Board as well  as the IRB for review.  
We will report any serious AEs to the Data Safety Monitoring Board within [ADDRESS_121649](s) to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within the required 
timelines as specified in 21 CFR  Part 312.32: fatal and life -threatening events within 7 calendar days (by [CONTACT_109741]) and all other SAEs in writing within 15 calendar days. All serious events designed as “not associated” to 
study product(s), will be reported to the FDA at least annual ly in a summary format.

• Reviewed and evaluated by [CONTACT_458]  
 
7.6 Safety Monitoring   
The [LOCATION_007]  Medical Center Digestive Diseases Center (DDC) will provide a Data Safety Monitoring Board 
of 3 reviewers to monitor the trial data and participant safety (Drs. Marc Rhoads , Craig Jensen , and Moreshwar 
Desai ). The members of the Data Safety Monitoring Boa rd have no potential personal, professional, or financial 
conflicts of interest related to the proposed study and its investigators. The DDC is a NIH -funded digestive 
disease center and consists of clinical and basic science investigators working in and ar ound the [LOCATION_007] Medical 
Center in Houston who meet weekly for the DDC sponsored seminar. There is active collaboration among 
members of the DDC. Members of the Data Safety Monitoring Board  were chosen who are familiar with the 
methodology proposed and the c ondition of FAP. The Data Safety Monitoring Board  will review baseline and 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  [ADDRESS_121652]. The plan will include review by [CONTACT_458], t he research coordinator, and the IRB.  
 
8. INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION  
Abdominal pain , bloating, and/or constipation may be, by [CONTACT_108], a part of FAP.  I n order to  have better 
discrimination between normal changes in a subject’s symptoms and an adverse reaction , an individual subject 
will discontinue PMO if any of the following occurs:  
• Diarrhea: 6 or more watery stools or greater than 800 grams of stool/24 hours OR  requires outpatient 
IV hydration  
• Vomiting: Prevents daily activities, requires outpatient IV hydration  
• Bloating: Prevents daily activities and requires medical intervention  
• Constipation: Prevents daily activities and requires medical intervention  
• Abdomin al pain: Interference with activity and requiring medical intervention  
These criteria meet a severity grade of 3 based on National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events  (CTCAE). The study also will be stopped in an individual for an allergic reaction to 
PMO.  The study will be stopped in all individuals if ≥ [ADDRESS_121653]. If a subjects 
misses > 4 doses of medication in a 7 day period of time, they will be considered for removal from the study for 
non-compliance. Followup by [CONTACT_109743].  
PMO may be discontinued t emporarily if an AE occurs and cessation and reinstitution of the medication 
would clarify whether the AE was related to administration of PMO. Discontinuation would be for ≤ 24 hrs.  
 
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 General Design Issues   
Hypothesis: A  relationship exists between systemic menthol exposure and GI function.  The design is 
predicated on the clinical need to define appropriate dosing for the use of PMO in the treatment of children with 
functional abdominal pain ( FAP).  Thus, children are fi rst randomized to the three doses of PMO typi[INVESTIGATOR_109670] ( PK). Then, children continue on their 
assigned dose to determine the effect of that dose on gastrointestinal ( GI) function.  As a n exploratory 
hypothesis, we propose that systemic menthol  exposure after PMO reflects a genotype -phenotype relationship 
in subjects with allelic variants of CYP2A6 and/or UGT2B7.  
 
9.2 Sample Size and Randomization  
 
A total of 30 subjects will be assigned to three different (3 -fold) doses (10 children per dose). This “three 
dose” approach in light of the anticipated range of body weights in the study cohort would produce a dynamic, 
> 3-fold range in systemic exposure to PMO (e.g., AUC of menthol).  While the limited size of the participant 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  32 of 50 Version 1. 4 
  15 November 2017  
 groups would not support (i.e., with statistical validity) therapeutic dose selection for PMO in children with FAP, 
it will enable us to assess and explore important PK (e.g., dose p roportionality) and PD (e.g., concentration vs. 
effect) relationships.   The planned 3 -fold range in PMO dose used in the proposed study (180, 360 and 540 
mg) is associated with an ability to detect a difference in the three dose groups (n=10 per group) wit h a power 
of > 90% (assuming alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_121654] deviation in dose -normalized [mg/L*hr per 1 mg/kg of 
menthol derived from PMO] AUC).     
 The following biological signatures (microbiome composition, motility, transit time) will be assessed to 
determine if giving peppermint oil (PMO) to humans results in a clinically meaningful change in the measure.  A 
change in any of the following will be considered to be meaningful. Given the limited information regarding the 
physiologic effects of PMO, part icularly in children, it is recognized that the direction of change in the biological 
signatures following PMO treatment may not be predictable. Because the following biological signatures are 
independent of each other, there will be no contradictory chang es.  
A clinically meaningful change for:  
Microbiome is defined for this study as a statistically significant change from baseline after treatment with 
PMO, correcting for multiple testing (q value). Such changes may occur with respect to gut microbiome 
diversity and/or composition (e.g., phylum, family, genera). We anticipate there will be an increased bacterial 
diversity, as well as increases in the abundance of organisms associated with a healthy microbiome, in 
response to PMO administration. Using a pair ed study design, with n=30, a presumed mean difference of 0.[ADDRESS_121655] deviation of 0.25 (Hollister et al. Microbiome 2016;3:36), we will 
have a power of 0.[ADDRESS_121656] a significant (P= 0.05) difference.  
Contractile activity will be defined as a significant change from baseline for the group. We anticipate that 
contractile activity will decrease significantly as a function of PMO administration. Using a paired study design, 
with n=30, presuming a mean difference (base line vs post -PMO) of 20% in contractile activity, with a standard 
deviation of 26 pressure waves per hour (Rao et al. Neurogastroenterol Motil 2010;22: 640), we will have a 
power of 0.[ADDRESS_121657] a significant (P=0.05) difference.    
Transit time will be  defined as a significant change from baseline for the group. We anticipate that transit 
time will decrease significantly as a function of PMO administration. Using a paired study design, with n=30, 
presuming a mean difference (baseline vs post -PMO) of [ADDRESS_121658] deviation of 12.5 
hours (Haase et al. Neurogastroenterol Motil 2014;26:1783), we will have a power of 0.[ADDRESS_121659] a 
significant (P=0.05) difference.    
Since this is not a randomized trial other than by [CONTACT_2715], there is n o intention to treat.  The data will be 
analyzed on a per protocol basis. Consequently, the data will provide the greatest amount of information 
regarding the effects of PMO on the three outcomes. Should 30 subjects  initially not complete the trial, 
additi onal subjects may be recruited if warranted scientifically.  
 
Treatment Assignment Procedures  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_109671].randomization.com. Subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_109744] 7 -9 and 10-12.  The samples will be coded 
so that the investigator analyzing the data (menthol, GI studies)  will not know to which dose group the subject 
had been randomized.  The data will be analyzed using the total dose taken over the week as a covariate. 
Sensi tivity analysis can be considered to assess the impact of compliance on outcome.  
Should there be an AE in which knowing the dose assigned is critical, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_109672] (e.g., primary car e physician, DSMB).  Thus, the blind will 
only be broken if need be on an individual subject.

 9.3  Definition of Populations  
 As noted above, the study does not employ an intention to treat design; rather the data will be analyzed 
per protocol.  
 
 
 
9.4 Interim Analyses  and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_109673] (see below).  
Abdominal pain , bloating, and/or constipation may be, by [CONTACT_108], a part of FAP.  I n order to have better 
discrimination between normal changes in a subject’s symptoms and an adverse reaction , an individual subject 
will discontinue PMO if any of the following occurs:  
• Diarrhea: 6 or more watery stools or g reater than 800 grams of stool/24 hours OR requires outpatient 
IV hydration  
• Vomiting: Prevents daily activities, requires outpatient IV hydration  
• Bloating: Prevents daily activities and requires medical intervention  
• Constipation: Prevents daily activities  and requires medical intervention  
• Abdominal pain: Interference with activity and requiring medical intervention  
These criteria meet a severity grade of 3 based on National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events  (CTCAE). The study will be stopped in all individuals if ≥ 2 subjects on drug develop the same 
CTCAE Grade 3 or if 1 patient develops a CTCAE Grade 4 or higher . The study also will be stopped in an 
individual for an allergic reaction to PMO.   
 
9.5 Outcomes  
9.5.1 Primary Outcome   
State and d efine the primary  outcome measure  and s pecify  at which  study visit  the outcome  
assessments will be performed . 
There are two primary outcomes which are independent of each other:  
• The pharmacokinetics of menthol after oral administration of 180 mg, 360 mg or 540 mg of PMO  
• The effects of PMO after daily administration of 180 mg, 360 mg or 540 mg of PMO as reflected 
by [CONTACT_109745], gut contractile activity, and gut transit time.  
9.5.2 Secondary Outcomes   
A secondary exploratory outcome is the potential relationships between s ystemic menthol exposure after 
PMO and allelic variants of CYP2A6 and/or UGT2B7.  
 
9.6 Data Analyses   
PK/PD  Data Analyses  
 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  34 of 50 Version 1. 4 
  15 November 2017  
 Concomitant assessment of drug disposition (PK) and effect ( PD) is possible using a PK -PD link model. 
This approach entails characterizing the concentration (generally plasma) vs. time relationship for the analyte(s) 
of interest in each study participant.  Model dependent (classical PK) or independent (based on statistical 
moment theory) can be used to derive relevant PK parameters (e.g., elimination half -life, mean absorption time, 
apparent volume of distribution, appare nt total plasma clearance) for each subject. Similarly, the PD approach 
entails repeated measurement of functionally relevant effect endpoints (e.g., those reflecting motility and/or 
intensity of contraction) as a function of time after the administration of the test article.  In most instances, the 
apparent time of peak effect lags the time of the peak plasma concentration. In this case, the Sigmoid E -max 
model (based on the Hill equation) is used to derive PD parameter estimates of interest (e.g., EC 50, Emax, E 0).  
The descriptive assessment of certain physiologic data captured by [CONTACT_109746][INVESTIGATOR_109674] (e.g., change in 
motility) also will enable us to define an area under the effect curve (AUEC ) that is associated with a given degree 
of systemic exposure (i.e., AUC) for menthol from a given dose of PMO.  With the simultaneous determination 
of relevant PK and PD parameters, these can be evaluated as a function of age (i.e., to assess potential 
developmental differences in either PK and/or PD) or disease severity.  Most importantly, the PK/PD approach 
enables characterization of the clinical pharmacology of a given drug/xenobiotic in a specific patient population. 
It does not require that the expos ure-response relationship first is well characterized in adults as the approach 
per se creates the exposure -response relationship in the population of interest (i.e., target population).   
Three different doses were selected for the initial PK evaluation s o as to purposefully create a dynamic 
range of systemic menthol exposures (i.e., range of AUC values).  We anticipate that this range will not only 
verify dose proportionality in PK but also, provide a real dynamic range for a careful exposure -response ana lysis 
(i.e., the PK/PD link model).  For the effect (PD) biomarkers, we will be able to discern from our pharmacokinetic 
modeling the menthol AUC that appears to correspond to specific changes from baseline for the activity of a 
given PD marker.  Once the PK/PD link model is built and the exposure -response relationships identified, we will 
use standard modeling/simulation techniques to assess the PMO dose (mg/kg) needed to produce a target 
menthol AUC (corrected per 1 mg/kg dose of menthol) associated with a given (desirable) effect on the gut.  
These data will be used to inform PMO dose selection for a subsequent study of PMO.  
In the steady state assessment carried out on Day 7, concurrent exposure vs. response data will be 
collected in subjects willing to undergo two additional blood draws .  Response data (i.e., pharmacodynamic 
surrogate endpoints) will consist of the physiologic measurements captured after the collection of the stool for 
microbiome analysis and administration of the SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382].  A populati on-based pharmacokinetic approach will 
be used to determine menthol PK parameters.  This particular sparse sampling approach (also known as an 
opportunistic sampling design) has been previously used by [CONTACT_109747] ([CONTACT_109765]) to assess 
the PK of antimicrobial agents in pediatric patients.122,123 The linked PK/PD analysis will be focuse d on exposure 
(i.e., plasma menthol AUC) vs. response data and will be accomplished using subroutines available in a widely 
used, proprietary software program (NONMEM v 7.2, Icon Development Solutions, San Antonio, TX).  
Finally, menthol plasma PK data from  both the single -dose and steady -state evaluation will be used to 
parameterize a final model that will be used to project PMO dose for the second phase of our research program.  
Specifically, Monte Carlo simulations will be performed using the aforemention ed parameter estimates to define 
a PMO dosing regimen that will produce systemic exposures (e.g., 5th to 95th percentile) previously associated 
with safety and desired effect in adults and, as informed by [CONTACT_36532]/PD data from the first phase of our program,  
a “target” level of exposure that appears to be associated with PD properties of menthol that based on objective 
(i.e., SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]) and subjective (i.e., reports of clinical improvement) data, are considered as desirable.  In the 
second phase of our resear ch program, we will select a subset from our study cohort to serve as the “test 
population” that will be used for the purposes of validation of PMO dose selected from our initial Monte Carlo 
simulations.  
Paired t testing will be used to compare baseline an d post -PMO changes in gut microbiome composition, 
transit time, and contractility after we establish that each parameter of interest is normally distributed.  
Gender and racial/ethnic subgroups  will be used as covariates to explore if they impact the study  results.  
 
TRPM8 , CYP2A6 , and UGT2B7  Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_109675]8 is a membrane transport protein located in the small intestine. It is also known as the cold -receptor  
for menthol. To our knowledge, there are no studies which examine the in vivo ontogeny of TRPM8 .   CYP2A6  
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  [ADDRESS_121660] of this study is exploratory as the size of the study population is not large 
enough, given the frequency of functionally important allelic variants of the drug metabolizing enz ymes 
associated with menthol biotransformation, to incorporate genotype as a covariate in the PK/PD analysis.  The 
value of the genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_109676] a PK “outlier” (e.g., a 
disproportionately increased AUC in a patient with a genotype known to correspond to a slow metabolizer 
phenotype).  
If our data analysis reveals either an apparent developmental or pharmacogenomic association between 
menthol exposure and response of the gastrointestinal tract, we will use the data for hypothesis generation for 
future investigations.  Specifically, the d ata generated from our proposed study will be sufficient to construct 
larger, mechanism -based trials sufficient to further characterize, at a tissue and cellular level, the effect of 
menthol on the bowel in children FAP.

An individual also can be removed from the study for poor adherence to study medication and/or study visits. If 
a subjects misses > 4 doses of medication in a 7 day period of time they may be considered for removal from 
the study for non -compliance. Follow  up by [CONTACT_109743].  
 
Adverse Event SOP  
 
Responsibility  
• The principal investigator (PI), research coordinators, and designated members of the PI’s research staff 
are responsible for Adverse Event recording a nd reporting to the Sponsor, Data Safety Monitoring 
Board, the FDA and the IRB.  
• The PI [INVESTIGATOR_109697].  
• The PI/Sub -I/Research Staff are responsible for follow -up information on all SAEs until resolution or an 
endpoint is reached .   
 
Definitions  
Adverse Event : any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
 
Serious Adverse Event :  untoward medical occurrenc e that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it 
does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  
• Requires inp atient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 
Expected Adverse Event : Described in the “Risks” section of the Consent Form.  
 
Unexpected Adverse Event : An adverse event for which the nature or severity is not consistent with the 
applicable product information (e.g. Investigator’s Brochure for an unapproved investigational product or 
package insert/summary of product characteristi cs for an approved product.  Not described in the “Risks” section 
of the Consent Form   
 
Causality, Suggested Guidelines for:  
1. Not related: no temporal association, or the cause of the event has been identified, or the drug cannot 
be implicated  
2. Possibly rela ted: temporal association, other etiologies are possible  
3. Probably related:  temporal association, other etiologies are possible but unlikely  
4. Related/Associated: established temporal or other association for event not reasonably explained by 
[CONTACT_423]’s k nown clinical state or any other factor  
5. Research -related:  related to the study entity or to a procedure or intervention conducted for the 
purposes of the research study  
 
Procedure  
1. All clinical events and symptoms are recorded by [CONTACT_109761].  A copy of the progress note containing details of adverse events will be placed in the research 
record.  
2. For each event or symptom, start date, severity, treatment or action taken will be recorded on th e Adverse 
Event Record.  A stop date or determination of ongoing status will be noted.  
3. The research coordinator must notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_109698] -threatening medical or 
laboratory event.  
4. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_109699].  
49 5. SAEs (including description, notifications, intervention, and resolution) are reported on appropriate source 
documents.  These may include: report sheets, copi[INVESTIGATOR_109700], medical orders, medication 
adminis tration records, progress notes, etc.  
6. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_109701] [ADDRESS_121697](s) 
to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within the required timelines as specified in 21 CFR Part 312.32: 
fatal and  life-threatening events within 7 calendar days (by [CONTACT_36984]) and all other SAEs in writing within 
15 calendar days.  
9. All serious events designed as “not associated” to study product(s), will be reported to the FDA at least 
annually in a summary format . 
10. Only the Data Safety Monitor Board may determine the causality of all SAEs.  
11. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_109702]’s condition  
12. A summary of all SAEs is  reported to the IRB and FDA in Annual Reports and in the Final Report.

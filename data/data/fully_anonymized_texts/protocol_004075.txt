Protocol Version 1.0  Version date: 29/APR/2021 Page 18 of 22 visits. For planned procedures/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_643102], documentation should be completed at the time of the Screening.  Parkinson’s disease and Previous Therapy for this disease     The date of diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease, as well as previous treatments, will be recorded during Screening visit.   Concomitant Medication Review      Data concerning concomitant medications and procedures will be collected throughout the clinical trial. This data will be obtained at scheduled or unscheduled visits based on information provided by [CONTACT_102].   Handling of Biological Samples   Sampling tubes, material for shipments of the samples and a laboratory manual detailing all sample collection and shipment procedures will be provided and distributed to the clinical trial site by [CONTACT_643121]. Laboratory samples will be collected as per protocol during Visit 1 – Screening, and/or Visit 2 – Infusion 1 (Baseline), Visit 6 - Infusion 5 and Visit 9 – End of Study.  Adverse Events    Adverse Event  An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered as adverse events if the abnormality results in study withdrawal, a serious adverse event, leads to additional treatment or diagnostic tests, or is considered by [CONTACT_1372]. Information on all adverse events should be recorded immediately in the source documents, CRF and in the appropriate adverse event section of the source documents. All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should be recorded in the source document and CRF, though should be grouped under one diagnosis.  A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event. Any adverse event that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_66301] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for an adverse event. All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the subject is lost to follow-up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained

Protocol Version 1.0  Version date: 29/APR/2021 Page 19 of 22 Serious Adverse Event  Adverse events are classified as serious or non-serious.  A serious adverse event is any AE that is:  • fatal • life-threatening • requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] • results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity • a congenital anomaly or birth defect • an important medical event  Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening but are clearly of major clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above. All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious adverse events. Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered possibly related to the study treatment or study participation should be recorded and reported immediately.  Adverse Event Reporting Period  The study period during which adverse events must be reported is normally defined as the period from the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment follow-up.  For this study, the study treatment follow-up is defined as approximately [ADDRESS_860879] one of the following events occur:   1. Allergic reaction as evidenced by [CONTACT_4140], bronchospasm, or hypoxia after the product has been administered intravenously.   2. Patient verbally decline the treatment at any moment prior, or during the infusion.    3. Hyperpyrexia develops after infusion administration begins (core body temperature greater than or equal to 104°F).   4. Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_643103], based upon PI’s discretion.    5.

Sudden Severe Hypotension (30-40 mm/Hg drop from pre-infusion level)  If an infusion is stopped for a subject due to an adverse event or serious adverse event, including but not limited to hypersensitivity reaction/anaphylaxis, no additional study treatment will be given to the study participant who develops the event. Although, the study participant will not receive the investigational product, he or she must be followed for safety purposes according to the protocol.   Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_643104]:   1. Subject’s Death.   2. Occurrence of any thromboembolic event during or after HB-adMSCs administrations (up to 72 hours).   3. Any cerebrovascular ischemia or seizure event occurring within [ADDRESS_860880] administrations.   4. Any Serious Adverse Events determined to be related to the following:   - When there is one CTCAE.v5 grade [ADDRESS_860881] administration.  Should the study participant discontinue study treatment he/she will be followed for safety according to the protocol safety monitoring plan. The study participant will receive follow up communication to ascertain the outcome until resolved fully. All will be documented as per protocol. Statistical Methods     Sample size consists of up to [ADDRESS_860882] been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. All data collected from subjects who are enrolled and received the investigational product will be analyzed. The incidence of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events will be recorded and reported. Efficacy will be measured by [CONTACT_643122]’s signs and symptoms associated with Parkinson’s disease. Interim analysis of all safety and efficacy data may be performed at any time deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_1034]. Although, the subject’s data may be analyzed at any time, a data analysis of all available data will be conducted when a least [ADDRESS_860883] completed Week 24. Data may be analyzed for internal informational purposes, reports, presentations, and manuscripts.

Protocol Version 1.0  Version date: 29/APR/[ADDRESS_860884]-hoc comparisons. Parkinson’s assessment scores (i.e., MDS-UPDRS) at screening and infusion 1 (before treatment) will be averaged and treated as a baseline. Averaging is performed to minimize sources of variance (i.e., patient condition, assessors) and particularly to establish a reliable baseline from which to establish changes.   Data Handling     Case Report Forms (CRF)  As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or an electronic data record or both. Reports received by [CONTACT_779], or from the central laboratory should be printed, retained as source documentation and signed by [CONTACT_458], indicating which values are considered clinically significant and to be reported as AEs if applicable.   Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source documents  Changes in the Conduct of the Clinical Trial       Protocol Amendments   Any change to the protocol will need to have a protocol amendment submitted to the IND, and FDA and IRB must agree prior to proceeding.  Deviations from the Protocol   Deviations from the protocol should not occur. If safety deviations occur, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_643105], and the implications of the deviations must be reviewed and discussed. Any deviation must be documented in the protocol deviation log. In addition, each deviation must include a description of the deviation, the relevant dates (start and stop), and the action taken. All deviation reports and supporting documents must be kept in the Investigator Site File and in the Trial Master File.   Premature Clinical Trial Termination   Both the Study Investigator and Sponsor have the right to terminate the clinical trial at any time.  Should this become necessary, the procedures will be agreed upon after consultation between the two parties. In terminating the clinical trial, the Sponsor and the Study Investigator will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the best interests of the study participants. Regulatory authorities and IRB will be informed.  In addition, the Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the participation of any clinical trial site. Conditions that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to:

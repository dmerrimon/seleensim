Background:  
 
Post-cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_875998]. Abnormal bleeding after cardiopulmonary 
by[CONTACT_875999] 11% patients.1 Current literature shows lower 
transfusion rate and blood loss  in patients receiving prothrombin complex concentrate ( PCC ) 
when compared to fresh frozen plasma ( FFP) after cardiac surgery .2  
 
Specific Aim:  
 
Determine best practice in management of postcardiopulmonary by [CONTACT_876000]. Our aim is to compare administration of PCC ( Kcentra ) to FFP for patients with post 
by[CONTACT_876001] . Primary 
endpoints for the study will be allogenic blood product transfusion rate and 24 hour 
postoperative blood loss.  
 
 
Hypothesis:  
 
 Patients receiving PCC (Kcentra) will have same or decreased allogenic blood product 
transfusion rate and blood loss after cardiac surgery compared to patients receiving fresh frozen 
plasma.  
 
Significance:  
 
This will be the first prospective randomized controlled clinical trial  directly comparing  PCC to 
FFP for post cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_876002] -mediated coagulopathy.  
 
 
 3 1. Background and Significance:  
 
Post-cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_875998]. Abnormal bleeding necessitating blood 
product transfusion occurs in about 11% of cardiac surgical patients.[ADDRESS_1223457] -cardiopulmonary  by[CONTACT_876003]; however, algorithm based transfusion 
is standard practice at our institution .[ADDRESS_1223458] factor deficiencies . In addition FFP transfusion carries the risk of 
transfusion related lung injury , transfusion related circulatory overload , infectious and allergic 
complications  among others.6  
 
Prothr ombin complex concentrate  use in hemophiliac patients dates back several decades, and 
has recently  become  the treatment of choice for  management of bleeding in patien ts taking 
vitamin K antagonists  (warfarin) .7-9 Current formulations of inactivated PCC available in the 
[LOCATION_002] include Bebulin (Baxter) which contains factors 2, 9, 10, and Kcentra (CSL 
Behring) which contains factors 2, 7, 9, 10. PCC administration in the perioperative setting 
including post-cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_876004] . Studies evaluating the efficacy of PCC’s in this patient population have demonstrated 
faster normalization of INR, lower blood los s, and lower transfusion requirements .2,10,11 
Historically, PCC use in the perioperative setting has been  limited due to fear of thrombotic 
complications. Newer formulations of PCC’s include a variety of anti -coagulants such as 
heparin, protein C & S, and anti -thrombin 3. Such additives are felt to re duce thrombotic risk 
when compared to PCC formulations void of these additives.12 Thromboembolic events remain a 
concern when using any procoagulant including PCC’s , especially formulations with activated 
factors such as FEIBA (Baxter), which contains activated factor [ADDRESS_1223459] not been conducted.  
We hypothesize that PCC  use will show a reduction in allogenic transfusion requirements  in 
cardiac surgical patients with factor mediated postcardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_381165].  
 
2. Specific Aims:   
 
Our aim is to conduct a prospective randomized controlled trial of patients undergoing elective 
cardiac surgery. We plan to preoperatively consent and enroll sufficient patients to reach a goal 
of 200 randomized patients ( 100 patients per arm) that demonst rate clinically significant 
microvascular bleeding and factor mediated coagulopathy after cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476]. 
Randomized patients with clinically significant factor mediated bleeding will receive transfusion 
of PCC  (Kcentra)  (100 patients) or fresh fro zen plasma ( 100 patients). Factor mediated 
coagulopathy will be defined per our current transfusion algorithm as PT >16.6 sec/ INR >1.[ADDRESS_1223460] administration (PCC or 
FFP). 
 
 
Hypothesis:  
 
 PCC  arm will have same or decreased allogenic blood product transfusion rate  and blood loss 
after cardiac surgery compared to patients receiving fresh frozen plasma.  
 
3. Research Design and Methods:  
 
A. Study Overview  
 
All patients enrolled in the study  will have a  perioperative anesthetic care plan standardized as 
much as possible conforming to the current institutional  protocol utilized for  intraoperative  
medication a dministration. Patients will be anticoagulated according  to institutional practice with 
heparin 400 units/kg with goal ACT > 400 prior to initiation of cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476]. After 
cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476], patients will receive protamine at dose 0.01 mg/unit of heparin given 
with target ACT within 10% of baselin e value. If ACT >10% baseline additional protamine will 
be given at the anesthesiologists discretion. Evaluation and determination of excessive 
microvascular bleeding in the surgical field will occur [ADDRESS_1223461] to within 
10% of baseline . Determination for treatment with PCC or FFP will be based off of the current 
algorithm used at our institution.1  Specifically this study will focus on patients with a PT >16.6 
sec/ INR >1.6 sec, or aPTT > [ADDRESS_1223462]:  
 
1. Be ≥ [ADDRESS_1223463] an INR ≤ 1.3 if warfarin was not held for 5 days  
Exclusion Criteria  
All subjects with one of the following are not eligible for enrollment:  
 
1. Are unable to grant informed consent or comply with study procedure  
2. History of hypercoagulable condition (e.g. Factor V Leiden, AT -3 deficiency, 
Prothrombin gene mutation, Anti -phospholipid antibody syndrome, etc.) or previous 
unprovoked thromboembolic complications  
3. Coagulopathic cond itions such as factor deficiencies, factor inhibitors, heparin induced 
thrombocytopenia, or use of intravenous anticoagulants other than heparin at the time of 
cardiovascular surgery  
4. Thromboembolic event with past 3 months  
5. Received oral therapy with ELIQUI S (api[INVESTIGATOR_3822])  or Xarelto (rivaroxaban)  within 3 days 
prior to planned surgical procedure  
6. Received oral therapy with clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745],  prasugrel, or dabigatran within 5 days prior to 
planned surgical procedure  
7. Are undergoing emergency open heart -surgery  
8. Cardiopu lmonary by[CONTACT_876005] <[ADDRESS_1223464] op  
12. Life threatening bleeding necessitating transfusion of hemostatic products (FFP or PCC)  
prior to the study intervention time point  
13. Circumstances for which the safe ty of the patient could be jeopardized by [CONTACT_876006]  
 [ADDRESS_1223465] meet additional criteria in order to receive study treatment:  
Inclusion Criteria  
 
1. Have evidence of excessive microvascular bleeding in the surgical field as determined by 
[CONTACT_27241]  
2. PT >16.6 sec/ INR >1.6 sec, or aPTT > [ADDRESS_1223466] cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_876007]  
1. Fibrinogen < 144 mg/dL on initial post cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_876008]  
 
 C. Enrollment  
 
Subjects wi ll be enrolled at the time of pre -operative visit with cardiothoracic surgery if they 
meet the eligibility criteria. Informed written consent will be obtained and randomization 
performed to one of the two study arms.  
 
We estimate approximately [ADDRESS_1223467] s will be need to consented with intent of having 100 
patients receive treatment (50 patients in each treatment arm). This study will terminate once [ADDRESS_1223468] 
(DSMB) will pro vide oversight and monitoring to the study to ensure the safety of participants 
and validity and intensity of data. The DSMB will consist of 2 physicians and a statistician not 
affiliated with study. They will review data from the study and  meet at the 50% and 75% 
enrollment milestones or every [ADDRESS_1223469] . The 
DSMB will provide aggregated data summaries to the Mayo IRB with explanations of 
seriousness and relatedness of adverse events to the study.  In addition  to the above, the authors 
will inform the National Institute of Health (NIH) of any actions taken by [CONTACT_3016] a result of 
its continuing review.  
 
The primary adverse event of concern in this study would be thromboembolic events.  DSMB 
(anesthesiologist, hematologist, and statistician) will meet quarterly, and review all data from 
each study arm. Thromboembolic complications will be reviewed and clinical judgment will 
used to determine necessity of study termination. No formal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_875987] g iven the 
study size and low incidence of TEE.  
   
 
Early termination of the study will ensue if adverse events in either study arm exceed acceptable 
level.  
 
D. Randomization  and Blinding  
 
Upon consent for study participation enrolled patients will be randomized  via computer -
generated blocks and with stratification according to the surgical procedure to either receive PCC 
or FFP during cardiac surgery should they develop excessive microvascular bleeding in the 
 7 surgical field as determined by [CONTACT_876009] l team in addition to a PT >16.6 sec/ INR >1.[ADDRESS_1223470] received treatment in 
each arm of the study.  Patients will be anticoagulated according to institutional practice with 
heparin 400 units/kg with goal ACT > 400 prior to initiation of cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476]. After 
cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476], patient s will receive protamine at dose 0.01 mg/unit of heparin given 
with target ACT within 10% of baseline value.  After protamine administration the ACT, CBC, 
PT/ INR, and f ibrinogen , will be collected via preexisting arterial access.  If ACT >10% baseline 
addit ional protamine will be given at the anesthesiologists discretion. Evaluation and 
determination of excessive microvascular bleeding in the surgical field will occur [ADDRESS_1223471] to within 10% of baseline.  Patients with clinical evidence o f excessive 
microvascular bleeding in the surgical field as determined by [CONTACT_27241], along with a PT 
>16.6 sec/ INR >1.6 sec will receive randomized treatment with either PCC or FFP.   
 
 
PCC (Kcentra) Dosage:  Patients randomized to the PCC arm with evidence of microvascular 
bleeding and PT >16.6 sec/ INR >1.[ADDRESS_1223472] Kcentra 15 units/kg prepared from pharmacy.  
 
Patients who have received PCC  and continue to demonstrate microvascular bleeding 10 
minutes after  the full PCC  dose has been administered  will undergo repeat laboratory evaluation 
of PT/INR +/ - CBC, and fibrinogen depending on previous lab results and p roduct 
administration other than  PCC. Therapy will ensue following our institutions current transfusion 
algorithm . Patients who receive d full dose PCC and continue to have microvascular bleeding in 
addition to a PT >16.6 sec/ INR >1.6 sec will receive FFP  at a dose of 10 -15 mL/kg rounded up 
to the nearest unit.   
 
FFP dosage : Patients randomized to the FFP arm will co ntinue with standard therapy per our 
institutional algorithm at a dose of 10 -15 mL/kg  rounded up to the nearest unit . Patients who 
have received  FFP by [CONTACT_876010] [ADDRESS_1223473] administration will undergo repeat laboratory 
evaluation of PT/INR +/ - CBC, APTT, and fibrinogen depending on previous lab results a nd 
product administration other than  FFP.   Therapy will ensue following our institutions current 
transfusion algorithm. Patients who receive FFP per randomization and continue to have 
microvascular bleeding  [ADDRESS_1223474] administration in additi on to a PT >16.6 sec/ 
INR >1.6 sec, or aPTT > 57 sec will receive additional FFP.  
 
 8 Transfusion of coagulation products other than PCC or FFP  (e.g. platelets and cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_047])  
will be determined by [CONTACT_876011].  
 
Resolution of microvascular bleeding  within the surgical field as determined by [CONTACT_876012] , not normal ization of coagulation testing. 
Examples of this are as follows:  
1. A patient with an INR of 1.[ADDRESS_1223475] commonly secondary 
to surgically related issues. The extremely rare instance that bleeding pe rsists despi[INVESTIGATOR_875988] 
(thus presumed to be continued microvascular bleeding), the decision to transfuse blood 
component products, PCC, or potentially salvage therapy with  activated PCC will be left 
to the discretion of the anesthesiologist and surgeon caring for the particular patient.  
 
 
Red blood cell transfusion (PRBC) threshold will be a hemoglobin concentration of 8g/dL  (Hct 
24%) for patients enrolled in this study, as this threshold was not inferior to a threshold of 10 
g/dL (Hct 30%) in the TRACS trial.[ADDRESS_1223476]  caring for the patient  in rare 
instances  (e.g. severe surgical bleeding ). Transfusion of PRBC in intensive care setting will also 
target a hemoglobin transfusion thresh old of > 8 g/dL.  Resolution of micr ovascular bleeding is 
the endpoint for necessitation of transfusion , not normal ization of coagulation testing.  
 
Thrombin generation testing  
A blood sample will be collected to analyze thrombin generation  prior to cardiopulmonary 
by[CONTACT_6476], post -cardiopulmona ry by[CONTACT_876013], after transfusion of product 
(either FFP or PCC), [ADDRESS_1223477] labora tory 
tests. Thrombin generation testing is not performed at Mayo Clinic. These samples will be stored 
at -20 degrees Celsius and sent batched to a specialized laboratory for testing. All samples will 
be deidentified and contain no PHI. Study participants w ill not be charged for this testing. No 
genetic analysis or testing other than AT -3 and Thrombin generation testing will occur with these 
samples.  
 
Antithrombin III Level  
AT-3 levels will be drawn at time periods that mirror thrombin generation testing below:  prior to 
cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476] , post-cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_876013], after 
 [ADDRESS_1223478] (either FFP or PCC), 24 hours postoperative, 3 days postoperative, and  5 
days postoperative or day of discharge  . Pati ents will not be charged for this testing. AT -3 levels 
will be collected in the same sample tube as Thrombin generation testing and shipped to a 
facility capable of performing such testing. All samples will be deidentified and contain no PHI. 
No genetic an alysis or testing other than AT -3 and Thrombin generation testing will occur with 
these samples.  
 
Coagulation Factor Levels  
A blood sample will be collected to analyze coagulation factors 1 -12 and protein C & S levels 
prior  to cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476], post -cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_876013], 
and after transfusion of product (either FFP  or PCC). This blood sample will be collected 
through an arterial catheter which is routinely placed as standard practice fo r cardiovascular 
operations. The collected coagulation factor level results will not be available to alter treatment 
in either study arm. Analysis of coagulation factor levels will focus on  changes in factor levels 
resultant  of cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476] , and changes in factor levels resultant of product 
administration (either FFP or PCC).  Study participants will not be charged for coagulation factor 
laboratory analysis.   These samples will be batch shipped to CSL Behring’s central laboratory in 
[LOCATION_013] for tes ting.  All samples will de-identified and contain no PHI ( Protected Health 
Information) .  No genetic analysis or testing other than the factor levels will occur on these 
samples.  
 
 
Current intraoperative transfusion algorithm  
 

 11 patients will be at a nasopharyngeal temperature of >36°C prior to discontinuation of CPB.  
Anticoagulation will be reversed with protamine  as previously described . The patient will be 
transported intubated on a mo nitored cart to the cardiac surgical ICU.   
 
 
   
Postoperative ICU transfusion  
Current postoperative  ICU transfusion  requirements will follow the institutional  algorithm  (see 
ICU transfusion algorithm  below ). Deviation from the protocol in rare circumstances is left to 
the discretion of the ICU consultant and Surgeon. Transfusion of PRBC in intensive care setting 
will aim for a hemoglobin transfusion threshold of > 8 g/dL.

present, and will be monitored closely as an adverse event in both 
treatment arms. The presence of clinically significant 
thromboembolic complications will be diagnosed as per current 
clinical practice in this patient population. It is assumed that

I.  Follow -Up 
 
A telephonic assessment will be made by a study nurse at 30 days  + [ADDRESS_1223480] (Attached 
below).    
 
J. Statistics/Power  Analysis  
 
Power Analysis was determined from a study by [CONTACT_876018] a 
reduction in blood loss in patients receiving PCC over those receiving FFP .[ADDRESS_1223481], a sample -
size of N=50 per group should provide statistical power of >85% to detect a difference of 
this magnitude. Therefore we suggest a sample -size of at least 50 per group . In the paper, 
they also found a dramatic difference in ICU red cell transfusions. If the true difference is as 
large as they observed a sample -size of N=[ADDRESS_1223482] administration, and 24 
hour postoperative b lood loss.  Exploratory endpoints will include rate of serious adverse 
outcomes.  
 
Baseline patient characteristics, including demographics, comorbidities, preoperative laboratory 
values, and cardiovascular variables will be reported and com pared across treatment groups. 
Categorical variables will be reported as counts and percentages, and compared across groups 
using chi -square or Fisher’s exact tests.  Continuous variables will be reported a s median and 
interquartile ranges, and compared across groups using Wilcoxon rank sum tests.   
 
 
K. Feasibility and Time Frame  
 
This study with the combined collaboration of divisions of anesthesiology and cardiovascular 
surgery is quite feasible. Approxim ately [ADDRESS_1223483]. Mary’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Making the conservative estimate that 50% will consent 
1000 patients should be consented within 1 year. Given that approximately 11% of patients 
 16 receive transfusio n; this would result in approximately 100-[ADDRESS_1223484] to get IRB approval within the next one month.  The study and data 
collection will take about 1 year with approximately two months for data analysis.  
 
L. Strengths and Limitations  
 
Strengths: This will be the first prospective randomized controlled trial in the [LOCATION_002] 
directly assessing the effect of PCC compared to FFP in the setting of  postcardiac surgery 
coagulopathy and bleeding in patients under going elective cardiac surgery.  
 
Limitations: If the study demonstrates lower transfusion requirements and blood loss in the PCC 
arm, further studies will need to address optimal dosing requirements. Current PCC dosing is 
based on INR and weight fo r patien ts on warfarin therapy. Should no difference be  found 
between groups, or lower transfusion rate and/or postsurgical blood loss is found in the FFP arm, 
the question as to whether this represents a superior result of FFP or underdosing of the PCC arm 
will r emain.  
 
 
M. Anticipated Results  
 
a. PCC administration will reduce the amount of allogenic blood product transfused and 
amount of postoperative bleeding in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.  
 
b. Adverse event rate will be similar between the 2 treatment  arms , representing the 
known risk associated with cardiovascular surgery . 
 
c. Perioperative transfusion related costs will be similar or lower in patients receiving 
PCC compared with FFP  
 
N. Estimated Co sts 
 
Kcentra will be supplied and funded by [CONTACT_489208] (Melbourne, Australia). FFP if 
administered will be covered by [CONTACT_102]/payer as this treatment is the current practice  
standard. All laboratory testing not routine to this patient population will be funded by [CONTACT_876019].  
 
O.  Research Materials  
  
All data forms will be stored in individual patients study fo lders and handled securely for patient 
confidentiality. This data will be entered into an access database that is password protected.  
 
P.  Human Subjects  
 
We will obtain informed consent from all participants prior to initiation of the study.  Informed 
consent will meet the requirements of  the code of federal regulations 21CFR 50.25 (elements of 
informed consent) and the IRB of this center.  During informed consent for the study cardiac 
 17 surgical patients will be told that the chance of needing a transfusion in the perioperative period 
is around 11%. Should they meet criteria by [CONTACT_876020], 
they would have been randomized to receive either FFP or the study PCC infusion.  A copy of the 
consent form will be placed in the patient’s medical records. The study will be stopped when [ADDRESS_1223485] 
research.   The course is divided into four sections:  
 
• Course introduction and general overview  
• History section which explores examples of unethical behavior in human subject research  
• Review of major human subject protection issues  
• Discussion of the various roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in human subject 
research  
• At the conclusion of the instruction, individuals are required to complete a thirty -question 
assessment.  
 
 
R.  Confidentiality  
 
Every effort will be made  to ensure strict patient confidentiality.  Research records are stored 
securely and are separate from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097].  No patient identifier will be used in any 
publication resulting from this study.  
 
S.  Recruitment  
 
Volunteers will be recruited by [CONTACT_876021]. 
The investigators will review the purpose, the procedures risks and discomforts, benefits 
alternatives, costs, participation and termination, treatment for research related injury and 
confidentiali ty issues of the study in person with all potential volunteers.  Before participation, 
all volunteers are given adequate time to read the consent form before written informed consent 
is obtained.  The original consent form is placed in the subject’s study file.  A copy is provided 
to the participant and sent to HIM scanning to include in the electronic medical record . 
 
T.  Gender/Minority Mix  
 
 [ADDRESS_1223486] the racial/ethnic characteristics of the group to reflect the communities in 
Olmsted County, MN and are anticipated to be 95% white, 3% Asian and 2% other min orities. 
No efforts will be made to alter these characteristics, as there are no data that suggest differences 
in outcomes that we are studying in different genders or ethnic groups.

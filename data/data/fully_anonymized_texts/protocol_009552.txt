1. BACKGROUND, EARLY CHILDHOOD CARIES  
 
Early Childhood Caries (ECC) is a pandemic in the US, particularly within poor minority 
populations where ECC rates are as high as 90%.1 The etiology of this disease is 
thought to include bedtime bottle feeding and vertical transmission of cariogenic bacteria 
(i.e. Strep. Mutans) from mother to child. Man dibular incisors are generally protected 
from the cariogenic bacteria and carbohydrates because of the resting position of the 
tongue over the lingual surfaces of those teeth, leaving maxillary incisors exposed to 
both bacteria and carbohydrates.2 Treatmen t for ECC is expensive, ranging from $1,000 
or more .  In addition,  ECC’s have a large impact on the child’s health like low weight 
gain.3  
 
Historically, stainless steel crowns (SCC) have been the most reliable and predictable in 
longevity . However  for the anterior teeth, it is unattractive because of the display of 
metal.  Demand for more esthetic restorations has been on the rise. A procedure was 
presented  explor ing an open faced crown technique, where the operator cements a 
traditional SSC, opens  a window on the facial aspect of the crown to fill and shape the 
tooth colored resin material. This procedure  demands more chair time and is also 
technique sensitive.4 By [CONTACT_941] 1990’s, pre -veneered stainless steel crowns (PVSSC) had 
been on the market with names such as NuSmile crowns, Kinder Krowns and Cheng 
Crowns. NuSmile crowns have shown success by [CONTACT_695156], parental acceptance of esthetics, and are less technique 
sensitive.5-7 
 
PVSSC are SSC bonded with th ermoplastic composites on the roughened or meshwork 
facial surfaces. It is made from the same SSC used by [CONTACT_695157].  Many 
advantages of these crowns are noted. Parents find the PVSCC’s to be esthetically 
acceptable, hemorrhaging does not aff ect the resistance or retention, or color of the 
crown, and there is less chair time needed when compared with alternative   
restorations .[ADDRESS_943158] and 
comparing bonding strengths of the PVSCC’s composite surface, as well as 
autoclavability of PVSSCs8, clinical success with NuSmile crowns9, and their failure 
strengths.[ADDRESS_943159] of the literature mentioned early in dealing with resistance, 
retention and shear forces of the PVCCs are done on bench top or operator experience

 describing clinical cases. Very few randomized control trials were done on the clinical 
success of PVSCCs  and zirconia ceramic crowns .  
The purpose of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_695148] -surfaced 
affected anterior primary teeth.

 7. STUDY PROCEDURES  
 
7.1 Training  
All research study team members will obtain clinical research and HIPAA training prior to 
start of study.  All pediatric dental (PEDO) clinician team  who work at the Dental Surgery 
Center (DSC) and are willing to participate in this study will train with the NuSmile 
crowns by [CONTACT_695158] f or each crown type in the 
study . Intra and inter -reliability assessment will be obtained (Kappa >0.8). Training and 
calibration will be performed by a  representative from NuSmile and [CONTACT_142041] from the 
Center for Pediatric Dentistry.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_943161] and their parent/guardian, and 
every parent/guardian will provide written consent to participate in this study prior to the 
performance of any study procedures.   
 
7.[ADDRESS_943162] Screening  
All patients at the Center for Pediatric Dentistry that meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria 
will be given the opportunity to participate in this research study. Each subject will be 
screened for compliance with the inclusion/exclusion criteria specified in s ection 6 prior 
to enrollment in this study.  
 
7.4 Treatment Randomization  
Restorations will be randomly allocated to a patient; all teeth in a single patient will be 
randomly allocated to receive one of the restoration treatments: 1) NuSmile   Signature 
[CONTACT_695166] ( thirty  patients in the intervention group  2) NuSmile ZR crowns (thirty  patients in 
the intervention group  and 3)  and composite strip crowns ( thirty  patients in control 
group).  
 
The randomization sequence will be created using STATA 12.0 ( StataCorp, College 
Station, TX) statistical software using random block sizes, which are known only to the 
study statistician. The randomization list will be created and placed in the order 
determined above into opaque sealed envelopes prior to trial start .  The envelopes will 
be kept in a secure place known only to the study coordinator, research assistants, and 
statistician.   
 
Each patient will be assigned a random treatment when they arrive at the treatment 
appointment and after they have been determine d eligible and have signed the consent 
form.  The clinician will be told the treatment assignment immediately prior to the 
treatment appointment.   
 
  7.[ADDRESS_943163]’s parent/guardian has provided informed consent for participat ion in the 
study, patient’s sedated procedure will be accomplished. This study will be executed 
within a comprehensive restorative treatment. A rubber dam will be placed and the 
crowns will be placed following manufacturers’ guidelines, see below.  
 
7.5.[ADDRESS_943164] natural in the child’s 
 
The Center for Pediatric Dentistry, University of Washington – 11/20/ 2014 
 mouth will be selected.  For the NuSmile PVSSC Signature [CONTACT_695166], it is recommended 
to choose one to two sizes smaller than the size of a stainless steel crown (SSC) that 
would be deemed if used.  Downsizing compensates for the additional thickness of the 
esthetic facing.  
 
7.5.2 Preparation of the tooth  
A) For NuS mile PVSCC  Signature  [CONTACT_695167]:  
The tooth should be prepared to fit the crown so that the crown fits the tooth passively 
without using pressure. The incisal length of the tooth is reduced by [CONTACT_3450] 2mm 
with the interproximal contacts opened. A feather -edge margin is created as far 
subgingivally as possible  (approximately 1 -2mm) . The tooth is overall reduced by 
[CONTACT_3450] 25-30%. For preparing the tooth subgingivally, and refining the 
preparation, tapered diamond burs may be used, proceeding from coa rse to fine as the 
preparation is completed.  
 
B) For NuSmile ZR Crowns:  
The tooth should be prepared to fit the crown so that the crown fits the tooth passively 
without using pressure. The incisal length of the tooth is reduced by [CONTACT_3450] 1.5-
2mm wit h the interproximal contacts opened. With a course tapered bur, t he tooth is 
overall reduced supragingivally by [CONTACT_3450] 20-25%, or 0.5 -1.25mm on all planes 
of the tooth .  Reduction should follow the natural contours of the clinical crown and meet 
in a thin, tapered incisal edge.  Carefully extend and refine the preparation margin to a 
feather -edge approximately 1 -2mm subgingivally with a thin tapered diamond bur (green 
stripe 6852 -012).  Check that no subgingival ledges remain.  Round all line angle s and 
point angles of prepared teeth.     
 
C) For Strip Composite Crowns:  
The celluloid crown is selected based on the mesiodistal width of the tooth. The incisal 
length of the tooth is reduced by [CONTACT_3450] 2mm with the interproximal contacts 
opened. A feather -edge margin is created su pra or at gingival level . The tooth is overall 
reduced by [CONTACT_3450] 15-20%. For preparing the tooth, and refining the preparation, 
tapered diamond or tungsten carbide burs may be  used.  
 
 
7.5.3 Crown  Fitting,  Adjustment  and Cementation  
A) For NuSmile PVSCC Signature [CONTACT_695167]:  
In some cases, shortening the crown from the gingival margin may be necessary to 
achieve the desired results. The NuSmile Shortening Bur may be used at low range 
speed with a water spray to  circumferentially reduce and feather the crown margins. 
After shortening, the composite polisher may be used to restore a polished surface to 
the esthetic facing.  
 
A properly fitted crown will have a passive fit and be seated with finger pressure only. A  
“snap fit” is both undesirable and counter -productive as it may result in failure of the 
veneer. If the crown does not fit passively, the preparation must be refined to fit the 
crown.  Crimpi[INVESTIGATOR_417036], but if needed, excessive crimpi[INVESTIGATOR_695150].  
 
Clean the teeth of saliva, blood or debris and control gingival hemorrhage.  NuSmile’s 
Bio-active Resin Modified Glass Ionomer Cement  will be used to cement the crowns  
according to the manufacturer’s directions for use . 
 
The Center for Pediatric Dentistry, University of Washington – 11/20/ [ADDRESS_943165] in centric and excursio n functions. The opposing teeth may be slightly adjusted, 
if needed.  
 
It may be desirable to  trim the ve neer flush with the  incisal edge if the patient 
demonstrates bruxism patterns or end -on occlusion. The distal point angle may be 
rounded to shape the cr own for a right or left anterior.  
 
B) For NuSmile ZR crowns:  
 
Use NuSmile Try-In Crowns to test the fit and to avoid contamination with saliva or blood 
of NuSmile ZR Crown’s prepared internal surface.  If contamination with saliva or blood 
occurs, clean the internal surface of the NuSmile ZR Crown with Ivoclean or sandblast 
with alumi num oxide.   
 
A properly fitted crown will have a passive fit and be seated with finger pressure only. A 
“snap fit” is both undesirable and counter -productive as it may result in f racture of the 
crown . If the crown does not fit passively, the preparation m ust be refined to fit the 
crown.  
 
NuSmile  ZR Crowns should only be adjusted with burs specifically designed for 
adjusting zirconia restorations t aking care to use a light touch and a copi[INVESTIGATOR_695151]. The NuSmile  ZR Adjustment Burs can be used to circumferentially reduce and 
feather the crown mar gins when shortening a crown is necessary. The crown walls are 
very thin and should not be adjusted any more than 0.5mm in the  incisal ½ of the  
proximal area  as necessary.  No other areas of the crowns shoul d be adjusted. If 
adjustments are made, the ZR polishers should be used to restore a smooth surface to 
the crown.  
 
Clean the teeth of saliva, blood or debris and control gingival hemorrhage.  NuSmile’s 
Bio-active Resin Modified Glass Ionomer Cement  will be  used to cement the crowns  
according to the manufacturer’s directions  for use . 
 
C) For Strip Composite Crowns:  
Trim the crown form and pi[INVESTIGATOR_695152] a high -speed 
bur. Etch the enamel for approximately 20 seconds, wash a nd dry without desiccation of 
the dental structures. Apply a thin layer of bonding resin cure for 20 seconds ensuring 
that all surfaces are bonded equally.  Fill celluloid crown with the appropriate shade of 
composite and seat with gentle, even, pressure, allowing excess to exit freely. Light -cure 
each tooth surface (labially, incisally and palatally) equally. Remove celluloid crown 
gently and adjust form and finish with either composite finishing burs or abrasive discs.   
 
  7.5.4 Failure to Fit  
Teeth rand omized for treatment will be included in the study even if they cannot 
accommodate the crown and therefore a composite crown is placed instead (intention -
to-treat principle). The investigator will keep record of the teeth for further adjustment in 
the anal ysis. The reason for the fitting failure will also be recorded (See Appendix 2). If 
the tooth needs to be extracted  (not matching inclusion/exclusion criteria) , it will be 
excluded from the trial.  
 
The Center for Pediatric Dentistry, University of Washington – 11/20/ [ADDRESS_943166] crown placement (baseline); 
and months 3, 6, 12, and 18; and end of study visit occurring in range of 24 to 30 months 
from baseline. Please see Appendix 3 for scoring Criteria for the following:  
• Fit 
• Positioning  
• Proximal Contact  
• Marginal Adaptation  
• Color : Match , staining/color change  
• Gingival Status  
• Retention of the crown  
• Integrity  of the ve neer/composite  
• Secondary Caries  
• History of trauma  
• Clinical pulp pathology  
• Radiographical  pulp pathology  
• Parents’ esthetic satisfaction  
 
 
9. HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTECTION  
Adverse Events (AE) will be documented as to onset, severity, duration, remedy, and 
relatedness to the test device and will be recorded on source documents and on case 
report form s. Any study staff member becoming aware of an AE must bring it to the 
attention of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_91394], and the Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_695153], as needed, to the appropriate agencies 
and th e study sponsor.  AE reporting will follow the Western Institutional Review Board 
(WIRB) guidelines as below.  
 
Adverse Events (AE) are any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human 
subject, including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal phy sical exam or laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in 
the research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s participation in the 
research. Report to WIRB only AE that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_695154], as 
defined:  
• Event is Unexpected  (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the 
research procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such 
as the IRB -approved research protocol and informed consent document, or the 
Investigator Brochure; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being 
studied,  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related 
means there is a reasonable possibility  that the incident, experience, or outcome 
may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and  
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm  
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously 
known or recognized.  
 
 
The Center for Pediatric Dentistry, University of Washington – 11/20/ 2014 
 If the adverse event is clearly not related to the study drug, device, procedures, or 
washout process, it would not represent  a risk to other subjects in the research or a 
“problem” for the study and, therefore, does not have to be reported to WIRB.   
 
 10. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
Clinical Assessments will be done at baseline post crown placement; at months 3, 6, 12 
and 1 8; and end of study visit occurring in range of 24 to 30 months from baseline.

If this was to occur, the patient would be discontinued from study  and the justification 
recorded . 
 
 
  11.0 DATA ANALYSIS  
Descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations, counts, and percentages) will be 
calculat ed for all variables.  To evaluate if the primary efficacy variables differ by [CONTACT_695160] ( NuSmile PVSCC Signature [CONTACT_695167], NuSm ile ZR, and Strip 
composite crowns) , ANOVA or Chi -square tests of association will be performed . 
 
All subjects ev aluated at the [ADDRESS_943167], marginal 
adaptation, color match, gingival status, crown retention, veneer/composite integrity, 
secondary caries, occlusal in tegrity , history of trauma,  clinical pulp pathology , parents’ 
esthetic satisfaction .  Scores for efficacy variables will be summarized and displayed 
using descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations, counts, and percentages). 
 
The Center for Pediatric Dentistry, University of Washington – 11/20/ [ADDRESS_943168] significant differences in the primary efficacy 
variables by [CONTACT_695161] 6, 12, 18, and 24 month follow -up. 
Statistical differences will be calculated using logistic regression models accounting for 
within  cluster variance using generalized estimating equations (GEE).   
  
Safety variables include Adverse Events and Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects. All 
subjects that have had crowns placed will be evaluated for safety. Descriptions of 
occurrences, incide nce, severity and required treatments for  
Adverse Events and Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects Will be summarized and 
tabulated where appropriate.  
 
   
12.0 STUDY TERMINATION/SUBJECT WITHDRAWAL

1. Research Questions(s):    
Does tranexamic acid (TXA) reduce perioperative blood loss and red blood cell (RBC) 
transfusion during high risk spi[INVESTIGATOR_195021]?  
2. Hypotheses:    
We hypothesize that tranexamic acid will reduce perioperative RBC transfusion by [CONTACT_765893][INVESTIGATOR_195021].  
Research significance:  
Background:   
Major spi[INVESTIGATOR_765881]. Operative times frequently last more than 12 -16 hours with estimated 
blood loss ranging between 1200 and 11,500 mL (25 -230% of a patient’s estimated blood volume).1,[ADDRESS_1050170] been 
shown to reduce perioperative blood loss in cardiac surgery, liver transplantation, and major orthopedic 
operations.1,5-7 Furthermore, antifibrinolytics were recently reported to reduce mortality in trauma 
patients in the CRASH II mul tinational randomized controlled trial comparing TXA with placebo.8 The 
lysine analogs including tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid are inexpensive and low risk therapeutic 
options for adjunctive treatment of critical surgical bleeding. TXA is approxima tely 10 fold more potent 
than aminocaproic acid in vitro and has been associated with moderately better clinical results.9 
Tranexamic acid (trans -4-(aminomethyl) cyclohexanecarboxylic acid) is a synthetic derivative of 
the amino acid, lysine. It acts by [CONTACT_765894]. It is also a non -competitive inhibitor of 
plasmin.9-12 The studies reporting TXA use in spi[INVESTIGATOR_765882] a highly vari able patient population

IRB # ___________  with a wide range of blood loss and relatively small sample sizes which leads to conflicting results and 
reduced generalizability.1,9-[ADDRESS_1050171] depending  on the specific surgery, indications and patient 
medical history. The data from this study would be instrumental in the reporting of a clear benefit for 
pharmacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_765883].  
Significance:   
There are con flicting studies in the literature reporting different efficacy outcomes for the use of 
antifibrinolytics in spi[INVESTIGATOR_195021]. Several studies support the successful use of tranexamic acid for 
major orthopedic procedures, but the patient populations st udied for spi[INVESTIGATOR_765884]. If TXA is efficacious in reducing 
not only perioperative blood loss, but RBC transfusion without an increase in thromboembolic events, 
then its use may be justified for patients at risk for major blood transfusion.  
Investigational Plan 
Study design:  
  Double blinded, placebo controlled, block randomized clinical trial  
Methods:  
1. Primary outcome: Total perioperative red blood cells transfused

c. Estimated intraoperative blood loss  
d. Postoperative blood loss for the  first 24 hrs.  
e. Intravenous fluid administration  
f. Incidence of cerebral, cardiac, or renal thromboembolism prior to discharge  
g. Incidence of venous thromboembolism prior to discharge  
4. Patient entry, exclusion and dropout criteria:  
Inclusion Criteria :  Adult pat ients (age ≥ 18 years) undergoing posterior spi[INVESTIGATOR_765887] a ≥ 80% chance of major transfusion (more than 4 units of total RBCs) based on the 
Generalizable Model for Predicting Major Transfusion in Spi[INVESTIGATOR_765888].  
Exclus ion Criteria :  Patients under 18 years of age, non -English speaking patients, pregnancy, 
emergent procedures, surgery for tumor, trauma or infection, severe coronary artery disease, history of 
venous thromboembolism, history of cerebral vascular accident, renal insufficiency with GFR < 40 
ml/min/m2, and known or suspected allergy or intolerance to study drug or its components.  
Dropout Criteria :  Any patient who has an allergic reaction or any patient who is not given the full 
loading dose prior to surgical incision.  
5. Protocol specific methods:    
Enrollment and Randomization  
All qualified patients will be approached by a neuroanesthesiologist and/or neuroanesthesia 
fellow and asked to participate in this study prior to surgery.  After answering all questions a nd 
obtaining consent, the patient will be assigned a study ID number and block randomized in groups of ten 
to receive the study drug infusion (tranexamic acid) or placebo.  
Anesthetic Management  
Anesthetic management will be per routine in accordance with the Northwestern University High 
Risk Spi[INVESTIGATOR_765889].13 
Study Drug Administration  
The study drug will be prepared by [CONTACT_765895]. One of the investigators not directly 
involved in the patient care will blind the study drug or placebo with an opaque bag labeled with the 
study ID number. The study drug consists of tranexamic acid (1gram per 100ml of normal sali ne) 
administered as a loading dose of 10 mg/kg over 20 minutes given 20 -60 minutes prior to incision 
followed by [CONTACT_60801] 1 mg/kg/hr for the duration of surgery discontinued at the end of skin closure. 
The placebo will be an identical [ADDRESS_1050175] and cell saver 
administration, pro -coagulant drug administration, estimated intraoperative blo od loss, and postoperative 
surgical drain output. L. Carabini and N. Moreland will be primarily responsible for data entry and 
management for all patients enrolled in the study.

IRB # ___________  Data Storage  
Data will be stored in a locked cabinet and a unique Study ID Number will be affixed to a 
deidentified database stored on a department server behind a fire wall with limited password 
protected access.  
6. Risks/Benefits:    
The potential benefits to administer ing an infusion of tranexamic acid to a patient undergoing major 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_765890] a possible reduction in perioperative blood loss and red blood cell 
transfusion. There is a small risk of allergic reactions which would be treated immediately, and a n 
extremely rare occurrence of thromboembolic events such as blood clots to the leg or lung, the heart, 
eye, or brain.  
  
There is also a minimal risk of loss of patient confidentiality.  In an effort to minimize this risk and 
protect study subjects, data wi ll be reviewed in a strictly confidential manner with patient records 
stored in a locked cabinet and a unique Study ID Number will be affixed to a de -identified database 
stored on a department server behind a fire wall with limited password protected acces s.  
7. Data collection form:    
Demographic data, relevant past medical history and medications, (obtained from the most recent 
internist or preoperative evaluation in the patient’s chart), surgical procedure specifics (obtained from 
attending surgeons procedu re note), intraoperative procoagulant medications (including DDAVP and 
recombinant activated factor seven), fluid and blood product administration (from the anesthetic record 
and fluid flowsheet), laboratory findings, perioperative blood loss and blood con servation strategies 
(EBL, postoperative drain output, and cell salvage), and specifics of study drug administration including 
total dose, time of loading dose, and completion of infusion.

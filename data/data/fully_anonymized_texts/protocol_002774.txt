Title of study:  A Phase III, Multicenter, Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Subgam-VF in 
Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases (PID) 
Indication:  Primary immunodeficiency diseases 
Study centers:  This will be a multicenter study planned for th e US, but depending upon the availability of suitable subjects 
may be extended into other countries. 
Development phase: III 
Objectives:   
Primary Objective 
 To determine the PK profile of Subgam-VF and compare the AUC (0-) with historical AUC data (all standardized to 
one week at steady state) from Gammaplex 5% IGIV PID studies (G MX01 and GMX04).  
Secondary Objectives 
 To assess the safety of Subgam-VF, including the incidence of a dverse events and site infusion reactions in subjects 
with PID.  
 To refine the dose adjustment coefficient for Subgam-VF  
Exploratory Objective 
 To explore PK modelling for alternative dosing schedules.  
 
Study design:   
This will be a Phase III, multicenter, open-label, non-randomiz ed study. 
 Following a screening period, eligible subjects will commence weekly Subgam-VF treatment; this is a 16% 
subcutaneous IgG product.  
 Subjects will receive Subgam-VF for 26 weeks during which time safety will be assessed. 
 After Week 21, PK sampling will commence to measure AUC (0- ).  
 The patient populations will be as  similar as possible to that of the historical studies (GMX01 and GMX04) as per 
similar inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
 Comparable methods will be used to determine PK concentrations to that of the historical studies and the AUC 
measured will be at steady state.      
 Follow-up visit (one week after the last Subgam-VF infusion, We ek 27). All AEs will be monitored up to [ADDRESS_711143] (Week 30). 
 The initial weekly dose of Subgam-VF administered will be calculated by [CONTACT_544084]’s IGIV dose (should be stable, as in same mg/kg +/- 5%), divided by [CONTACT_544085] (i.e. 3 or 4), multiplied by 1.37, a dose adjustment coefficient based on other licensed subcutaneous IgG products. If the 
subject was already receiving a weekly SCIG IgG there will be n o dose adjustment.  
 Oral and parenteral steroids as concomitant medication are allo wed if the average daily dose is < 0.15 mg of prednisone 
equivalent/kg body weight per day.

 Routine premedication to reduce potential adverse effects assoc iated with SCIG infusions are discouraged.  Exceptions; 
 Premedication will be permitted if a subject has reported syste mic adverse events on two Subgam-VF 
infusions.   
 Local anesthetics (e.g. an analgesic cream) can be used before Subgam-VF infusion to reduce the potential pain 
associated with needle insertion if required. 
 Subgam-VF will be administered subcutaneously using infusion pu mps.  
 Subjects will be given diaries to record adverse event data as well as any infusions administered at home. In addition 
there will be a telephone follow up by [CONTACT_544086] [ADDRESS_711145] working day after Day 
3 as possible. 
 
Screening/Baseline After informed consent/assent (as appropriate): Screening/baseline – subjects receive their usual dose of IGIV/ SCIG and have all safety screening tests performed, including 
biochemistry, hematology, virology, vital signs and serum IgG trough levels.   
 
Treatment Period (Weeks 1 to 26) 
Eligible subjects return 7 days (+/- 1 day) after the Screening/Baseline visit for their first Subgam-VF dose (Week 1 visit).   
Weekly dosing with Subgam-VF will be administered for 26 weeks during which time safety will be assessed.   
Week 21 to Week 22: Subjects will undergo PK sampling between t wo treatment visits to measure AUC
(0- ) (sample taken 
pre dose, then at 1, 2, 3, [ADDRESS_711146] dose, defined as S teady State Day 0, Steady State Day 1, Steady State Day 2, 
Steady State Day 3, Steady State Day 5, Steady State Day 7).  I f the PK sampling cannot be completed at Week 21 (eg. due 
to patients work/vacation schedule) then this can be delayed to  start at Week 22, 23, 24 or 2 5; however, the patient should 
still visit the office/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_544058] 21 infusion and complete the other assessments scheduled for Visit 8, if possib le. 
Week 22 assessments (Visit 9) will normally coincide with the P K sampling Day 7.  However, i f PK sampling is delayed, 
Visit [ADDRESS_711147] is not already receiving IgG via the subcutaneou s route, it is planned that home infusion will begin on Week 3 
(3rd infusion of Subgam-VF), following training by [CONTACT_544087]-VF visits. However, if the subject 
requires further assistance this w ill be provided (i.e. it is n ot mandatory that the infusions are performed at home).   
The subject will return to the clinic every four weeks for a sa fety assessment (haematology, chemistry, pre and post dose 
vital signs and physical exam). Their regular Subgam-VF infusio n will be given whilst the subject is at the clinic and 
additional Subgam-VF vials will b e dispensed.  Trough levels wi ll also be measured at the clinic visits.  
 Follow-up visit  
Final safety assessments will be carried out approximately seve n days after the final study infusion.  All AEs will be 
monitored up to [ADDRESS_711148] party without the written permission of Bio Products Laboratory Ltd. (BPL).  It shall

Name [CONTACT_3261]: Immune Globulin (Human)Protocol Synopsis version and date: Version 6, [ADDRESS_711149] 18 enrolled subjects will be adults (16-75 years) 
and 12 enrolled subjects will be children with a minimum of four enrolled in each of the following age groups: 2-[ADDRESS_711150]  one infusion of Subgam-VF will be included in the safety 
analysis. The total number of subjects (adults plus children) evaluable f or PK analysis will be at least 30. Data will be compared to 
historical data from previous Gammaplex IGIV studies.  Assuming no true difference exists in average exposure compared  with the historical data, 30 evaluable subjects will give 
greater than 98% power of concluding equivalence assuming a bet ween-subject coefficient of variation (CV) of 18.2 % 
(equivalently, a standard deviation of logged data of 0.181).  If there is a true difference of 10%, power drops to 86%. 
 
Study variables  and criteria for evaluation:   
 
Pharmacokinetic Variables The following PK variables for total IgG levels will be determi ned for the PK population:   
 AUC
(0- )- area under the plasma concentration-time curve of the dosing interval; 
 sAUC (0-) - area under the plasma concentration-time curve of the dosing in terval standardized to one week. This 
will be calculated for the historical data only 
 Cmax – maximum concentration in plasma;  
 tmax – time to reach the maximum concentration in plasma;  
 CL– systemic clearance.  
 
The following additional PK variables will also be determined f or the ITT population:   
 Trough serum IgG levels (measured before every infusion adminis tered at the study site); 
 Trough levels of IgG, and IgG subclasses will be measured prior  to certain infusions; 
 Levels of specific antibodies ( Haemophilus influenzae B ,  Streptococcus pneumonia, Measles ) will be measured 
prior to certain infusions; 
 
Safety Variables  
The variables used to assess safety will be the following: numb er and percent of adverse events (AEs); adverse reactions, 
vital signs; clinical laboratory tests and Direct Coombs’ Test;  markers of virus transmission; physical examination. 
 
Statistical Methodology:   
ITT Population: 
All subjects who receive at least one infusion of Subgam-VF wil l be included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population.  The 
ITT population will be used for the safety analysis.  
 
PK Population:  This comprises the Subgam PK population (subset of the ITT popu lation) and Gammaplex PK population (from historical 
Gammaplex 5% IGIV PID studies). In addition, 
the PK Dose-Ad justment population is the subset of the PK population

 Safety:  The number and percent of infusions with at least one adverse e vent (AE), irrespective of causality, that occurs 
during the infusion or within 72 hours after completion of the infusion will be calculated.  A 1-sided 95% upper confidence 
bound for this percent will be derived.  If the upper bound is less than 40%, excluding local infusion site reactions, the 
incidence of infusion-related AEs associated with Subgam-VF will be considered acceptable.  In addition, the number and 
percent of subjects who report any AEs and the number and perce nt of subjects who report any AEs at least possibly related 
to Subgam-VF will be calculated, and the upper bound of the 95% confidence i nterval for the percentages will be presented.  
AEs occurring during the infusio n and within 1, 24, 48 and 72 h ours after the infusion completion will also be summarized. 
   AEs that occur during an infusion will be summarized by [CONTACT_544088].  If necessary, 
infusion rates will be grouped into different levels.  Serious adverse events (SAEs) and suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be summarized with all 
AEs, and separate listings will be provided for SAEs and S[LOCATION_003]Rs .  
 
All other safety assessments will be summarized descriptively f or each treatment group
. 
 
An adverse reaction will be defined as any TEAE (irrespective o f causality) that occurs during the infusion or within [ADDRESS_711153] related or any AE with unknown causality. 
 
 
Pharmacokinetics:   
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of Subgam-VF will be described by [CONTACT_2329] a non-compartmental method.  The trough levels of 
total IgG will be summarized descriptively for all the Intent-t o-Treat (ITT) subjects and compared with historical data for 
Gammaplex 5%.  Pharmacokinetic variables will be summarized descriptively.  The primary PK parameter will be sAUC (0-
).  
 All PK parameters will be calculated based on absolute (uncorre cted) and baseline-adjusted (i.e. trough-adjusted at steady 
state) concentrations. 
 
IgG subclasses and IgG antibodies: 
The trough levels of IgG subclasses and IgG antibodies against specified antigens will be summarized descriptively for all 
the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) subjects.    Primary Statistical Analysis 
Data will be pooled with historical data and a treatment variab le defined (Subgam-VF or Gammaplex IGIV).  Log 
transformed sAUC
(0-),  (AUC (0-) standardized to one week) will be analyzed using a mixed model fitted including treatment, 
and allowing for variability to be different between treatment groups.  The mean difference (Subgam-VF or Gammaplex 
IGIV) between treatments with 90% Confidence Interval (CI) will  be back transformed to give an estimate of the ratio 
(Sub gam-VF/ Gammaplex IGIV) of sAUC (0-). If the resultin g 90% CI for the ratio lies within the equivalence limit of

(0.80, 1.25), it will be concluded that there is equivalence in  sAUC (0-)  and thus the dosing factor of 1.37 for Subgam-VF (in 
addition to the adjustment for dosing interval) gives equivalen t exposure at steady state to Gammaplex IGIV.   
 
Secondary Statistical Analyses 
i. The primary analysis method will be repeated with data derived from baseline-adjusted concentrations. 
ii. A term for dosing interval within treatment will be included in the model described in the primary analysis so that 
ratios with 90% CI can be presented for Subgam-VF relative to b oth the 21 day and 28 day dosing interval 
regimens of Gammaplex. 
iii. The primary analysis model will be extended to include any sign ificant (at the 10% level) covariates or covariate by 
[CONTACT_9900].  Covariates considered for inclusion wi ll include age category, weight, BMI and sex. 
iv. The effect of previous treatment (SCIG or IGIV) on AUC (0-) in the Subgam PK population will be analysed. If the 
resulting 90% CI for the ratio lies within the equivalence limi t of (0.80, 1.25), it will be concluded that the previous 
treatment does not affect exposure at steady state. If this is the case then the refined dose adjustment with 90% CI 
will be presented on the full PK population (in addition to on the PK Dose Adjustment population described below).  
v. In addition, the data from the current study will be restricted  to a PK Dose Adjustment population  and analysed as 
per the primary analysis. A refined dose adjustment will be est imated as 1.37/the ratio (Subgam-VF / Gammaplex 
IGIV) of geometric means for sAUC
(0-)  and presented with 90% CI. 
Exploratory Analysis 
PK modelling will be performed to explore alternative dosing sc hedules.

4.1. Background 
The primary immunodeficiency diseases are a heterogeneous group  o f  d i s o r d e r s  i n  w h i c h  
there is an intrinsic defect in the tissues, cells, and/or prot eins of the immune system resulting 
in immune deficiency. Many of these disorders are characterized  by [CONTACT_544090]/or defective antibody production and, as a consequence, inc reased susceptibility to 
infection. 
 
Replacement therapy with immunoglobulin G (IgG) purified from p ools of plasma from 
multiple donors has been used since the early 1950s.  The initi al products were administered 
intramuscularly, but were of limited efficacy because of the re latively small quantities that 
could be administered by [CONTACT_544091].  Beginning in the 1980s, i ntravenous immunoglobulin 
(IGIV) became available in the [LOCATION_002] (US) and had becom e the main choice of 
treatment in the US3,4,5. 
 
Subgam-VF is a newly developed, highly purified, unmodified hum an immunoglobulin G 
(IgG) product intended for subcutaneous (SC) administration, an d is manufactured by [CONTACT_544092]., (BPL), [LOCATION_006].  The target indication is the treatment of primary 
immunodeficiency states, such as congenital agammaglobulinemia,  common variable 
immunodeficiency, and X-linked agammaglobulinemia. 
 
Subgam-VF is manufactured from plasma from healthy US donors wh o are subjected to 
medical examinations, laboratory  tests, and a review of their medical history before being 
allowed to donate plasma by [CONTACT_16166].  Each donation must be n on-reactive for hepatitis B 
surface antigen (HBsAg), anti-HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies, and anti-HCV antibodies.  Furthermore, plasma minipools (512 donations per pool) undergo nucleic acid amplification 
(NAT) testing for HIV, HBV, HCV,  HAV, and parvovirus B19.  Manu facturing pools are 
tested for HBsAg and HIV antibodi es; HIV, HBV, HCV, HAV and par vovirus B19 are also 
tested using NAT.   
Subgam-VF is a ready-prepared solution for SC administration that contains per mL 0.16 g 
IgG
6. Immunoglobulin G purity reaches 100%, the pH is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 6.6  to 6.8 but in the range 
of 6.4 to 7.2, and osmolality i s not less than 240 mOsmol/kg.  The immunoglobulins present 
are virtually 100% IgG, and the distribution of the four IgG su bclasses is approximately 64% 
IgG 1, 30% IgG 2, 5% IgG 3, and 1% IgG 4.  The content of IgA is lower than 50 µg/mL.  The 
Anti-A, Anti-B and Anti-D content of the final product is monit ored and controlled to 
specification.   
Study Protocol SCIG03, Version 6, [ADDRESS_711161] party without the written permission of Bio Products Laboratory Ltd. (BPL).  It shall 
be used for the sole information of the Investigator’s team and Staff must undertake not to disclose any such information to 
any person not involved in the study.  Subgam-VF was developed from BPL’s SCIG product, Subgam®, and introduces a 20nm 
virus filtration processing stage common to BPL’s IGIV product,  Gammaplex®, which was 
licensed in the [LOCATION_006] and US in 2009.  Subgam® is also licensed in Cyprus since [ADDRESS_711162], Gammaplex, but differs in terms of concentration ( 16% and 5% respectively).  In 
addition Subgam-VF is glycine based compared with Gammaplex whi c h  i s  s o r b i t o l  b a s e d .    
The efficacy of Gammaplex has been investigated in prior studie s therefore a PK and safety 
study will be performed with Subgam-VF and compared with histor ical Gammaplex data, as 
the two products are essentially identical apart from their relative concentrations, excipi[INVESTIGATOR_544059].   
4.2. Clinical trial data 
Subgam
®, the precursor non-virus filtered product to Subgam-VF, has be en evaluated in a 
Phase III efficacy study involving 50 pediatric and adult subje cts with Primary 
Immunodeficiency Disease.  The primary efficacy outcome to achieve target IgG trough levels over a minimum of 12 months was met; 85% of adults/teena gers and 93% of children 
achieved target serum IgG levels at all observation time points.  Subgam
® was safe and well 
tolerated during the study.  There were [ADDRESS_711163]-related adverse events were h eadache (8 reports in 7 
patients), pruritus (7 reports in 2 patients) and vomiting (5 r eports in 3 patients).  There were 
no withdrawals due to adverse events or safety considerations a nd no product-related SAEs6. 
Since licensure in the [LOCATION_006] [ADDRESS_711164]-related adverse events (20 non-serious and 1 4 serious). There have been no 
reports of virus transmission.   
There is no clinical trial data currently available on Subgam-V F. 
 
4.3. Benefit / Risk Statement 
Published data has shown that subcutaneous IgG (SCIG) use in su bjects with PID provides 
protection which is comparable to that found with IGIV therapy7,8,9,10.  
 
Infusions of IgGs given subcutaneously (SCIG) were initially us ed in patients who were 
unable to tolerate IgG administered either through intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) 
routes10. SCIG has the advantage in that it can be self-administered at  a time and location 
more suitable to the individual and without the need for assist ance from a trained professional 
(other than during the initial training period).  This convenience has been associated with an 
improvement in quality of life11,12.  
 This form of infusion requires no venous access.  Unlike IGIV w hich is infused directly into 
the intravascular compartment, SCIG must diffuse first into the lymphatic system and is then

be used for the sole information of the Investigator’s team and Staff must undertake not to disclose any such information to 
any person not involved in the study.  subsequently carried into the blood stream via the thoracic duc t8,13,14,15, therefore with SCIG 
the intravascular concentration of IgG increases more gradually , peaking at 48-72 hours.  The 
rate IgG enters the circulation appears to be the main driver o f systemic tolerability and as 
such the incidence of systemic adverse events appears to be much lower with SCIG therapy13 
than with IV infusion.  Also division of the dose into weekly f ractions produces more 
consistent IgG levels without the peaks and troughs experienced  with monthly IGIV infusions.  
However, with SCIG therapy because some of the IgG is already e quilibrating into the 
extracellular fluid before all of the IgG has entered the blood stream; and also due to binding 
and/or degradation of the IgG in subcutaneous tissue, the maxim um serum concentration of 
IgG can be on average 61% of the level achieved with IGIV16,17,18. 
 
As with any blood product, viral safety is a concern.  Subgam-V F undergoes a stringent multi-
step process, including solvent/detergent treatment, nanofiltra tion, and a terminal low pH 
incubation of the finished product, to reduce the risk of poten tial viral contaminants and 
enhance the safety of the product.   
5. STUDY OBJECTIVES

5.2. Secondary Objectives 
 To assess the safety of Subgam-VF, including the incidence of a dverse events 
and site infusion reactions in subjects with PID.  
 To refine the dose adjustment coefficient for Subgam-VF  
5.3. Exploratory Objective 
 To explore PK modelling for a lternative dosing schedules.

7. STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN 
 
This will be a Phase III, multicenter, open-label, non-randomiz ed study.  Up to [ADDRESS_711169] 18 subjects will be adults1 (aged 16-
75 years) and 12 will be children split between the age groups 2 to 5 years (i.e. not reached 
their 6th birthday), 6 to 11 years (i.e. not reached their 12th birthday) and 12 to 15 years (i.e. 
not reached their 16th birthday), with a minimum of [ADDRESS_711170] one infusion of Subgam-VF wil l be included in the safety 
analysis. Due to the potential for early withdrawals, PK data m ay not be available on all 12 
children and there may be fewer than 12 evaluable children in t he PK analysis. The total 
number of subjects (adults plus children) evaluable for PK anal ysis will be a t least 30.  
 
Subjects will receive 26 infusions (weeks) of Subgam-VF at a we ekly dose equivalent to 1.37 
of their IGIV dose (expressed as mg/kg/week).  If the subject w as already receiving a weekly 
SCIG IgG there will be no dose adjustment.  Pharmacokinetics an d safety of Subgam-VF will 
be assessed.  
All subjects will undergo a pharmacokinetic (PK) profile after the 21
st infusion of Subgam-VF 
( s e e  P K  A s s e s s m e n t  S c h e d u l e ,  T a b l e  3 ) .   W h e r e  a n  a p p r o p r i a t e l y  qualified member of the 
study team is available, arrangements will be made to collect t he PK samples from Steady 
State Day 1 ([ADDRESS_711171]-infusion) onwards at the subject’s h ome to reduce the number of 
visits to the sites. Alternatively a Home Health Agency may be u t i l i z e d  t o  t a k e  t h e  P K  
samples outside of the investigational site. The subject would be required to sign an extra 
IRB/EC approved consent form to permit the site to share the subject’s details with the agency in order for them to collect the sample. 
 
In the case of younger children it is important not to exceed the maximum blood withdrawal 
volumes stated in Appendix V.  Therefore smaller volumes of blo od will be taken.  See the 
Laboratory Manual for details. 
 
 Following a screening period, e ligible subjects will commence w eekly Subgam-VF 
treatment; this is a 16% subcutaneous IgG product.  
 Subjects will receive Subgam-VF for 26 weeks during which time safety will be 
assessed

be used for the sole information of the Investigator’s team and Staff must undertake not to disclose any such information to 
any person not involved in the study.   After Week 21, PK sampling w ill commence to measure AUC (0- ) over 7 days. 
 The patient populations will be as similar as possible to that of the historical studies 
(GMX01 and GMX04) as per similar inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
 Comparable methods will be used to determine PK concentrations to that of the 
historical studies and the AUC measured will be at steady state . 
 Follow-up visit Week 27 (one wee k after the last Subgam-VF infusion).   
 Follow-up telephone call Week 30  (four weeks after the last Sub gam-VF infusion). 
 The initial weekly dose of Subgam-VF administered will be calcu lated by [CONTACT_544093]’s IGIV dose (should be  stable, as in same 
mg/kg +/- 5%), multiplied by 1.37, a dose adjustment coefficien t based on historical 
data for other subcutaneous IgG products.  If the subject was a lready receiving a 
weekly SCIG IgG there will be no dose adjustment.  
 Oral and parenteral steroids as concomitant medication are allo wed if the average 
daily dose is < 0.15 mg prednisone equivalent/kg body weight pe r day.  Short or 
intermittent courses of > 0.15 mg/kg/day are allowed if require d.  
 Routine premedication to reduce potential adverse effects assoc iated with SCIG 
infusion are discouraged.  Exceptions:   
 Premedication will be permitted if a subject has reported syste mic adverse events 
on two Subgam-VF infusions. 
 Local anesthetics (e.g. an analgesic cream) can be used before any Subgam-VF 
infusion to reduce the potential pain associated with needle in sertion if required. 
 Subgam-VF will be administered subcutaneously using infusion pu mps.  
 Subjects will be given diaries to record adverse event data as well as any infusions 
administered at home.  
 
7.1. Study Visits 
For details of which procedure will be performed at any specifi c  v i s i t ,  s e e  t h e  s c h e d u l e  o f  
assessments (Table 2) in Appendix IV. 
 
Screening/Baseline 
After informed consent/a ssent (as appropriate): 
 Screening/baseline – subjects receive their usual dose of IGIV/ SCIG and have all 
safety screening tests performed, including biochemistry, hemat ology, virology, vital 
signs and serum IgG trough levels.   
 
Treatment Period (Weeks 1 to 26) 
 Eligible subjects then return seven days (+/- 1 day) after the Screening/Baseline visit 
for their first Subgam-VF dose (Week 1 visit).  Weekly dosing w ill be administered 
for 26 weeks during which time safety will be assessed.  Site v isits (Weeks 1, 2, 5, 9,

any person not involved in the study.  13, 17, 21, 22 and 26) – subjects will attend the clinic at spe cific points and they will 
receive their Subgam-VF infusion at the clinic.  There will als o be routine safety 
assessments, which will include blood sampling.  After the Week  [ADDRESS_711175] ’s carer is available, 
then arrangements may be made to conduct some of the visits at the subject’s home to 
reduce the number of visits to the sites. Alternatively a Home Health Agency may be 
utilized. The subject would be required to sign an IRB/EC appro ved consent form to 
permit the site to share the subject’s details with the agency in order for them to collect 
the samples/conduc t the assessments. 
 If the subject is not already receiving IgG via the subcutaneou s route, following 
training by [CONTACT_544087]-VF visits it is planned that home 
i n f u s i o n s  w i l l  b e g i n  o n  W e e k  3  ( 3rd infusion of Subgam-VF).  For home infusions, 
subjects (or care givers) will infuse Subgam-VF themselves and will record any 
concomitant medications, date and time of any adverse events (i ncluding inspecting 
the infusion site for reactions) and record details of their Su bgam-VF dose.  If the 
subject requires further assistance this will be provided (i.e.  it is not mandatory that 
these infusions are performed at home).   
 There will be a telephone follow up by [CONTACT_544094] [ADDRESS_711176] working day after Day 3 as p ossible. 
 The subject will return  to the clinic every four weeks for a sa fety assessment 
(hematology, chemistry, pre and post dose vital signs and physi cal exam).  Their 
regular Subgam-VF infusion will be given whilst the subject is at the clinic and 
additional Subgam-VF vials will be dispensed.  IgG trough level s will also be 
measured at the clinic visit every four weeks.  
 PK sampling – This will occur on Week 21 (defined as Steady Sta te Day 0 to 7), and 
will continue over the subsequent seven days to allow calculati on of AUC (see the PK 
schedule, Table 3,  Appendix IV). If the PK sampling cannot be completed at Week 21 
(eg. due to patients work/vacation schedule) then this can be d elayed to start at Week 
22, 23, 24 or 25; however, the patient should still visit the o ffice/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_544060] 21 infusion and complete the other assessments scheduled f or Visit 8, if possible. 
Week 22 assessments (Visit 9) will normally coincide with the P K sampling Day 7.  
However, if PK sampling is delayed, Visit [ADDRESS_711177]’s home could be made,  to help reduce the 
number of visits to the sites. Alternatively a Home Health Agen cy may be utilized to 
take the PK samples outside of the investigational site.

o 3 days (72 hours ± 6 hours) 
o 5 days (120 hours ± 8 hours). 
 
Follow-up visit and end of study 
 Follow-up visit (Week 27) – A fo llow up visit will occur seven days (+/- 1 day) after 
the last Subgam-VF infusion has been completed, to carry out as sessments for 
safety.  Blood samples will be taken at this visit.  This visit must occur prior to 
administration of a new IgG product.  
 Telephone follow-up (Week 30) – 28 days (+/- 1 day) after the l ast Subgam-VF 
infusion the subject will be contact[CONTACT_544095]. 
 
It is expected that any given subject will complete all treatme nts and follow-up assessments 
within approximately 30 weeks, (26 weeks on Subgam-VF, plus four weeks follow-up).  The end of the trial will be after the last subject’s last visit (w hich will be the telephone follow-up 
(Week 30) visit for the last subject).    
 
7.2. Infusions  
Subjects will receive 26 infusions of Subgam-VF subcutaneously on a weekly schedule using 
the supplied infusion pumps.  
Rescheduling of Infusions (visit windows) If absolutely necessary (e.g. because of unavoidable conflicts)  Subgam-VF infusions can be 
rescheduled +/- 1 days.  The reason why this visit was reschedu led should be recorded in the 
eCRF.  If there is a deviation from the scheduled visit/ visit windows, the study monitor 
should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], and the deviation must be documented appro priately.  These 
circumstances must not become routine.  If an infusion is resch eduled the other planned study 
assessments should also be rescheduled so that these are perfor med on the day of infusion. 
 
If the infusion just prior to PK sampling has to be rescheduled , then the PK sampling should 
be postponed to ensure that the PK samples are collected seven days after the last Subgam-VF 
infusion and the sampling times in Table [ADDRESS_711179] party without the written permission of Bio Products Laboratory Ltd. (BPL).  It shall 
be used for the sole information of the Investigator’s team and Staff must undertake not to disclose any such information to 
any person not involved in the study.  7.3. Pharmacokinetics 
All subjects will participate in t he pharmacokinetic (PK) segme nt of the study (if blood 
withdrawal volumes allow), see Appendix IV, Table 3.  In the ca se of younger subjects, 
pediatric blood volumes will need to be taken to ensure the max imum blood withdrawal 
volumes specified in Appendix V are adhered to (see Laboratory Manual for more details).  
 
 
 In exceptional circumstances, an d with prior Sponsor approval, if one of the following PK samples if 
lost, unevaluable, or not taken it may be taken at the same tim epoint during the week following the PK 
assessment, as long as the same dose in mg/kg has been given: 
o 1 day (24 hours ± 2 hours) 
o 2 days (48 hours ± 4 hours) 
o 3 days (72 hours ± 6 hours) 
o 5 days (120 hours ± 8 hours). 
 Where possible, arrangements to collect PK samples at the subje ct’s home, from Steady State 
Day 1 onwards, by a suitably qualified member of the study may be made.  IMPORTANT: If the infusion just prior to PK sampling has to be rescheduled, then the 
PK sampling should be postponed to ensure that the PK samples a re collected seven 
days after the last Subgam-VF infusion and the sampling times i n Table 3 are adhered 
to.   
7.4. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
All blood samples collected for the study will be processed by a central laboratory.  Once the  
results are made available, eligibility should be checked by [CONTACT_3433] e Investigator and eligible 
subjects may be enrolled into the study. 
 Samples for clinical laboratory testing should be taken before certain infusions, unless 
otherwise indicated, as per the Schedule of Assessments (Append ix IV Table 2) and will 
include:  
 Biochemistry –including: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspart ate aminotransferase 
(AST), creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), lactate dehydroge nase (LDH), sodium, 
potassium, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, glucose and g amma-glutamyl 
transpeptidase (GGT).  
 Hematology - Complete Blood Count (CBC) with differential – including: hematocrit, 
hemoglobin, red blood cells (RBC), platelet count and white blo od cells (neutrophils, 
lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils).  
 Tests for hemolysis 
Study Protocol SCIG03, Version 6, [ADDRESS_711180] party without the written permission of Bio Products Laboratory Ltd. (BPL).  It shall 
be used for the sole information of the Investigator’s team and Staff must undertake not to disclose any such information to 
any person not involved in the study.  o Direct Coombs’ Test (Direct Antiglobulin test – DAT) 
o Haptoglobin 
o Plasma free hemoglobin 
o Urine hemosiderin 
Tests for bilirubin and serum LDH in the standard biochemistry panel is also 
considered a test for hemolysis. 
 
 Specific antibody function to test for antibodies against the following antigens: 
o Haemophilus influenzae B 
o Streptococcus pneumoniae.  
o Measles  
 
 Virology testing 
o Serological tests for HBsAg, HCV, HIV 1 & 2 at screening for el igibility and 
at Week 27 Follow up visit  
o Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) for HCV, HIV at Week 27 Follow up on ly  
o Parvovirus B19 NAT and serology at Infusion 1, 2 and Week 27 Fo llow up 
visit.  
 
 Urinalysis – that will inclu de microscopic examination. 
 
 Pregnancy testing - all females of child-bearing potential will  receive a urine-based, 
human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) pregnancy test regardless of  claimed inability to 
conceive (including patients who have undergone surgical steril ization). 
 
7.4.1.  Effects on Hepatic, Renal, and Hematologic Function 
If the results of any blood test demonstrate a rise to 2.[ADDRESS_711181] Coombs’ Test 
B l o o d  s a m p l e s  f o r  D i r e c t  C o o m b s ’  T e s t s  a n d  t e s t s  f o r  h e m o l y s i s  (bilirubin, haptoglobin,

during the study (as detailed in Appendix IV, Table 2).    Test s  f or b il i r u bi n  a nd  LDH  a re 
included in the biochemistry panel. 
In the event that a Direct Coombs’ Test result is positive, the  following procedures should be 
followed:   
 The laboratory will notify the Investigator and the designated CRO within two 
business days of receiving the abnormal result. 
Study Protocol SCIG03, Version 6, [ADDRESS_711182] party without the written permission of Bio Products Laboratory Ltd. (BPL).  It shall 
be used for the sole information of the Investigator’s team and Staff must undertake not to disclose any such information to 
any person not involved in the study.   Subjects with a positive result w ill be flagged by [CONTACT_544096], and those subjects 
wil l have a Direct  Coom bs’ Test and ot her tests for hem ol ysis ( as detailed above)  
before every subsequent infusion given during a clinic visit  a nd at the follow-up 
visit.   
 Upon recei ving a first report of a positive direct Coom bs’ t est  on any subject, the 
Investigator will contact [CONTACT_544097], serum LDH, plasma free hemoglobin bilirubin, and u rine hemosiderin 
as soon as practically possible (generally within three busines s days) and will assess 
the subject in order to determine if there is any clinically si gnificant hemolysis. 
Thereafter, further tests for hemolysis may be done if clinical ly indicated and at the 
discretion of the investigator. 
 All positive Direct Coombs’ tests will be reported as adverse e vents. 
 
 
Other criteria for hemolysis: 
 If the Direct Coombs’ Test is negative, but other hemolysis tes ts are indicative of 
hemolysis, the Investigator should conduct further tests to con firm hemolysis as 
clinically indicated and at the discretion of the Investigator.   This may include repeat 
Direct Coombs’ Test, haptoglobin, serum LDH, plasma free hemoglobin, bilirubin and 
urine hemosiderin. 
 A drop in hemoglobin of 2 g/dL or greater, in conjunction with both a drop in serum 
haptoglobin to below the lower limit of normal and a rise in se rum LDH from 
baseline, would suggest intravascular hemolysis: 
 Investigator should review all results with reference to above criteria, and in 
conjunction with patient medical  history to determine if there is clinically 
significant hemolysis.  Investigator should conduct further tes ts as clinically 
i n d i c a t e d  a n d  a t  t h e  d i s c r e t i o n  o f  t h e  I n v e s t i g a t o r .   T h i s  m a y  include repeat

bilirubin and uri ne hemosiderin. 
 Clinically significant hemolysis should be diagnosed taking int o account the above 
criteria (drop in hemoglobin of 2 g/dL or greater, in conjuncti on with both a drop in 
serum haptoglobin to below the lower limit of normal and a rise  in serum LDH from 
baseline) and any additional tests, as applicable. 
 Clinically significant hemolysis will be reported as an adverse  event.  Subjects with 
clinically significant hemolysis should have a Direct Coombs’ t est and other tests for 
hemolysis (as detailed above) before every subsequent infusion at the clinic. 
 
7.4.3.  Virology Testing 
If the tests for HBV, HCV, HIV, or Parvovirus B19 suggest a cha nge in viral status of the 
subject, the tests will be repeated by [CONTACT_2237].  If a change in viral status is 
confirmed by a second independent test, the reserve sample take n before the first infusion of 
Subgam-VF will be retested in the same laboratory in the same b atch as a retest of the suspect

any person not involved in the study.  sample.  The central laboratory will inform the Sponsor and the  designated CRO within one 
business day of a confirmed report of a change in viral status.  
 
7.4.4.  Reserve Samples 
Reserve plasma and serum samples will be collected at all relev ant time points, for reanalysis 
if needed, e.g. if an original sample is spoiled or if results are discrepant.  Where necessary an 
additional blood sample will be collected; at other time points  plasma or serum aliquots will 
be split so that a reserve plasma  or serum sample can be retain ed at site.  See Appendix IV 
and Laboratory Manual.   
 Reserve samples should be sent to the central laboratory within  one month of collection where 
they will be stored at -70°C for the duration of the study.  Re serve samples may be kept until 
the licence for Subgam-VF is granted by [CONTACT_544098], 
if required, for repeat assays at the request of a regulatory a gency.  For full details, please see 
separate Laboratory Manual.
 
 
Table 4 (Appendix V) displays the suggested maximum blood withd rawal for children.  If the 
volume of blood withdrawn within 30 days is expected to exceed that specified on Table 4, 
then the Sponsor/Contract Research Organization (CRO) should be  contact[CONTACT_544099].  In these cases it will likely be the reserve samples that will not be taken so as to not exceed the maximum blood volumes allowed.   The deviation must be 
documented appropriately on the eCRF.  
7.4.5.  Archive Sample 
A blood sample will be collected from each subject immediately before the first infusion of 
Subgam-VF and at the follow-up (week 27) visit before another I gG product is given and sent 
at the end of the study (after all subjects have completed) to the central laboratory for onward 
dispatch to Cryo-store for long-term storage.  Serum will be st ored in tubes at -70°C for a 
minimum of 15 years after the trial is complete
19.  Samples will be used for serology and NAT 
testing if required in the future.  The handling and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] o f these samples will be 
coordinated by [CONTACT_2237]. 
 
7.5. Informed Consent  
Written informed consent (and assent when appropriate) must be obtained from the subject 
and where appropriate by [CONTACT_423]’s parent/legal guardian an d signed by a suitable qualified 
and trained person, first in the protocol and the legal and eth ical requirements of the study, 
before any study procedures are carried out (see Appendix II, S ection 2).   
 
7.6. Medical History  
A complete medical history of th e subject including demographic s will be taken at Screening 
and an interval medical history (adverse events) will be taken at subsequent clinic visits.  
Study Protocol SCIG03, Version 6, [ADDRESS_711184] party without the written permission of Bio Products Laboratory Ltd. (BPL).  It shall 
be used for the sole information of the Investigator’s team and Staff must undertake not to disclose any such information to 
any person not involved in the study.  Special attention should be paid to any aspect of the medical h istory or any clinical/laboratory 
feature that may serve to exclud e the subject from participatio n.   
 
Chronic infections and conditions that may require intermittent  or continuous treatment during 
the study and/or could potentially change in frequency or sever ity during the study such as: 
cough, chronic bronch itis, chronic sinusitis, and arthritis and  the type and frequency of 
treatment required should also be assessed and recorded so that  symptoms of these conditions 
can be distinguished from treatment emergent adverse events (TE AEs) as the study 
progresses.    
Any elective procedures that are planned for pre-existing condi tions should be recorded. 
 
Previous immunologic data that document the specific immunologi c diagnosis will be 
recorded. 
 
The medical history must include the use of prior IGIV and SCIG  treatments received and 
how they were tolerated if available.  The previous use of an IGIV and SCIG product must be documented in the subject’s eCRF.  
7.7. Physical Examination  
Physical examination will be performed by [CONTACT_544100].  The physical examination is also a safety variable . 
 Elements of the examination should include:   
 General appearance 
 Head, eyes, ears, nose, throat 
 Cardiovascular 
 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] 
 Skin  
Other body systems examined should be specified in the eCRF.   Height will be measured at screening and weight will be measure d at screening and at every 
clinic visit.   Any clinically significant chang e  f r o m  b a s e l i n e  i n  a n y  s y s t e m  w ill be recorded as an AE 
(Appendix I).  
7.8.  Monitoring for thromboembolic events (TEE) 
Monitoring for thromboembolic events (TEE) will be performed at  screening (baseline) and at 
the Week 27 follow up visit (as well as when clinically indicat e d ) ;  t h i s  w i l l  i n c l u d e  
assessment of lower extremities for pain, swelling, tenderness or redness, also a respi[INVESTIGATOR_544061]03, Version 6, [ADDRESS_711185] party without the written permission of Bio Products Laboratory Ltd. (BPL).  It shall

any person not involved in the study.  examination for any sudden onset of shortness of breath and any  associated signs or 
symptoms of pulmonary embolus.   
 Assessment is particularly important in patients at high risk o f TEE including prolonged 
immobilization, hypercoagulable conditions, history of venous o r arterial thrombosis, use of 
estrogens, indwelling central vascular catheters, hyperviscosit y and cardiovascular risk 
factors. 
 
Subjects will be educated about the risk of TEE events and the signs and symptoms that they 
should look out for.  This information will be included in the written instructions for home 
infusions. Subjects will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_544101].  
Any clinically significant change from baseline in any system w ill be recorded as an AE (see 
Appendix I). 
 
7.9. Concomitant Medication  
All concomitant prescription and non-prescription medications received by [CONTACT_544102], eCRF and study diary (when a way from the site).  
 
The following concomitant medications are excluded during the s tudy:  
• Steroids (long term daily, ≥ 0.15 mg of prednisone equivalent/k g/day). Requirement 
for short or intermittent courses of steroids would not exclude  a subject. 
• Immunosuppressive drugs. 
• Immunomodulatory drugs. 
• Vaccination with live attenuated virus vaccines during the tria l (ie. until final follow 
up visit).   
 
7.10. Chest X-Ray  
A baseline chest X-ray (posterior-anterior and lateral) will be  obtained on all subjects unless a 
chest X-ray taken within the previous 12 months is available to  be used as a baseline. 
 
7.11. Vital Signs 
Vital signs assessed by [CONTACT_544103].  The vital signs to be 
observed will be: 
 diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) 
 systolic blood pressure (mmHg)  
 pulse rate (beats/min)  
 respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487] (breaths/min) 
 temperature (°C)

be used for the sole information of the Investigator’s team and Staff must undertake not to disclose any such information to 
any person not involved in the study.  The subject must be in the same position each time vital signs are obtained.  Temperature 
must be recorded using the same method every time e.g. orally, under the arm or via another 
common method.   
 
Any clinically significant changes in vital signs will be repor t e d  a s  A E s  a s  d e s c r i b e d  i n  
Section 10.2.   
 
Clinically significant hypotension and/or anaphylactic reaction s (significant hypotension with 
generalized hives/angioedema or bronchospasm) warrant discontin uation of the infusion and 
administration of appropriate supportive care as deemed necessa ry by [CONTACT_093] (this 
may include: epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], antihistamine, corticosteroids, suppl emental oxygen, expansion of 
the plasma volume as necessary, etc.).  These occurrences must be recorded on the eCRF as 
AEs.  At the discretion of the investigator, the subject may be  withdrawn from the study, but 
will complete the follow-up visits.    
If a subject has been assessed as being dehydrated and is given  intravenous fluids before 
beginning the subcutaneous study infusion, the baseline vital s igns will be taken after the re-
hydration fluids have been given but before infusion of investi gational product. 
 
Vital signs will be r ecorded once du ring the screening and foll ow up visits. 
 
Vital signs will be reco rded during site visits at the followin g times:  
 10 minutes before the start of each Subgam-VF infusion (+/- 5 m inutes) 
 30 minutes after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_544062]-VF infusion (+/- 15 minute s)   
Vital signs are also an important safety variable.  
If any AE of moderate or severe intensity occurs, the rate of t he infusion at which this AE 
occurred will be recorded, and the infusion rate will be reduce d appropriately, depending upon 
the severity of the AE symptoms.  The infusion may then be resu med at a rate tolerated by [CONTACT_1560].  Also see the most current Subgam-VF Investigator Broc h u r e  ( I B )  f o r  a  l i s t  o f

 Before listing changes in vital signs as AEs, each change shoul d be assessed for clinical 
relevance. 
 
7.12. IgG - Blood Levels of the Previous IgG Preparation  
As screening is likely to be performed during the same visit where the subject will receive 
t h e i r  r e g u l a r l y  s c h e d u l e d  i n f u s i o n  o f  a  l i c e n s e d   ( o r  i n v e s t i g a tional stage III, IIIb) IGIV or 
SCIG), the sample to determine trough IgG levels must be drawn before the infusion is 
started.  Trough IgG levels must be documented to demonstrate t hat the subject is in a steady 
state.  The minimum target trough level of IgG is 600 mg/dL.  I n addition, the dose, treatment 
interval, method of administration (IV/SC) and trade name [CONTACT_544143].

be used for the sole information of the Investigator’s team and Staff must undertake not to disclose any such information to 
any person not involved in the study.   
Samples will also be collected as per the Schedule of Assessmen ts (Appendix IV, Table 2), 
and should always be taken before  administration of the product .   
 
7.13. IgG Subclasses-Blood Levels of the Previous IgG Preparation  
Samples will also be collected as per the Schedule of Assessmen ts (Appendix IV, Table 2) to 
determine the survival of the Ig G subclasses during treatment w ith Subgam-VF. Samples 
should always be taken before administration of the product.   
 
7.14. Specific Antibody Function 
A sample will be taken prior to certain infusions (see Appendix  IV, Table 2) to test for 
antibodies against the following antigens: 
 Haemophilus influenzae B (screening and follow up [Week27]) 
 Streptococcus pneumoniae (screening and follow up [Week27]) 
 Measles (follow up [Week27])   
 
7.15. IgA and IgM Levels  
If levels of IgA and IgM in serum measured within the previous 12 months are not available, 
blood samples for IgA and IgM levels will be obtained.  Samples  should be taken at screening 
only.  
7.16. Routine Pre-medications 
Routine premedication to reduce potential adverse effects assoc iated with the SCIG infusion 
are discouraged. Exceptions: 
 Premedication will be permitted if a subject has reported syste mic adverse events on 
two Subgam-VF infusions. 
 If required, local anesthesia (for example Emla cream) is also allowed before any 
infusion to reduce the pain associated with needle insertion.  
 
The routine long-term use of corticosteroids is not allowed.  O ral and parenteral steroids are 
a l l o w e d  i f  t h e  a v e r a g e  d a i l y  d o s e  i s  <  0 . 1 5  m g  p r e d n i s o n e  e q u i v alent/kg/day.  Short or 
intermittent courses of > 0.15 mg/kg/day are allowed if require d. 
 If a subject who previously required premedication before infus ion with a licensed or 
experimental (Phase III or IIIb) IgG product is enrolled, their  previous use of premedication, 
as well as associated side-effects must be recorded on the eCRF .

be used for the sole information of the Investigator’s team and Staff must undertake not to disclose any such information to 
any person not involved in the study.  7.17. Data Recording 
All data from the study collected at site will be entered into the eCRF.  Subjects will record 
the data listed in 7.[ADDRESS_711189] be entered into the subjects’ me dical record before they are 
entered into the eCRF (also see Appendix II, section 12.4).  Su bject diary data will not be 
transcribed but will be used as source data for home infusions, adverse events and 
concomitant medication.  
7.18. Subject Study Diary  
The subject or parent/guardian will complete a study diary dail y between visits, starting after 
the Screening Visit.  The data from the study diary will be rev iewed at each site visit by  
[CONTACT_1746].  The data to be recorded in the study diary are as follows: 
 AEs (including time [24 hour clock] and date of onset/stop date  and any AEs 
following infusion site inspection).   
 Concomitant medication, especially antibiotics 
 Subgam-VF infusion details including:  
o Batch number 
o Date of infusion 
o Start and stop times of the infusion 
o Volume of Subgam-VF infused and number of vials used  
o Infusion rate 
o Infusion sites used and any associated infusion site reactions.   
For children and adolescents the parent/legal guardian is requi red to oversee that the diary is 
completed accurately and legibly.   The study staff will review the data from the subject study dia ry at each visit, to ensure the diary 
is completed correctly. If there is any discrepancies or missin g data this will be d iscussed with the 
subject and then if required corrected by [CONTACT_423]. These di scussions will be documented in the 
subject’s medical notes. 
 
7.19. Subject Withdrawal  
If more than five subjects withdraw prematurely from the study then a sufficient number of 
subjects will be replaced to ensure data for 30 evaluable subje cts.  
 
Subjects can be withdrawn from the study for any of the followi ng reasons: 
 The subject or parent/legal guardian withdraws consent for the study. 
Study Protocol SCIG03, Version 6, [ADDRESS_711190] party without the written permission of Bio Products Laboratory Ltd. (BPL).  It shall 
be used for the sole information of the Investigator’s team and Staff must undertake not to disclose any such information to 
any person not involved in the study.   The subject or parent/legal guardian is uncooperative and non-c ompliant (defined as 
the subject missing two consecutive or three overall study visi ts) with respect to 
provisions of the protocol.  
 The subject misses two scheduled infusions 
 The subject has a serious AE (SAE) while participating in the s tudy and, at the 
discretion of the site investigator, is withdrawn. 
 The subject becomes pregnant while participating in the study ( the pregnancy will 
not be recorded as an SAE, but will be captured on a Pregnancy Report Form and 
followed through until delivery or elective/spontaneous termina tion). 
 The subject requires treatment with any of the medications list ed in the exclusion 
criteria. 
Investigators may withdraw subjects at any time if they feel it  i s  n o t  i n  t h e  s u b j e c t ’ s  b e s t  
interests to continue.  Reasonable efforts will be made to cont act the parent/legal guardian and 
subject.  If the subject is lost to follow-up, this will be doc umented in the subject’s medical 
records.  
In exceptional circumstances relating to safety, the sponsor ma y withdraw subjects at any 
time. 
Data and samples collected up until a subject’s withdrawal from  the study will be used in the 
analysis.  Subjects who have completed the study and subjects w ho have withdrawn cannot 
participate in the study for a second time. 
 
7.19.1.  Evaluations at Early Withdrawal  
If a subject withdraws from the study or is dropped from the st udy for any reason, all tests 
identified for the end of study follow-up visit will be perform e d .   I f  s u bj e c t s  ha v e  s t o p p e d  
Subgam-VF treatment and started another product, this will be t aken into consideration in the 
analysis of the data.   
7.20. Study Termination 
Conditions for early termination are detailed in Appendix II, s ection 8. 
 
8. DESCRIPTION OF TREATMENT ADMINISTERED  
8.1. Investigational Product

8.1.3.  Conditions for Storage and Use 
Subgam-VF should be stored in a r efrigerator in a safe area of limited access or a Pharmacy.  
The product must be protected from light and maintained at a te mperature of 36°F to 46°F 
(2°C to 8°C).  Product that has  been stored out of a fridge for  one period of up to one week at 
temperatures up to 77°F (25°C) may be returned to the fridge wi th no change to the expi[INVESTIGATOR_151273]. Subgam-VF must not be frozen (inadvertently or on purpose ).  A log of daily 
temperatures in the Pharmacy storage area must be maintained to  demonstrate that the product 
has been stored under the specified conditions. 
 Once fully trained, subjects will be issued with Subgam-VF for home use.  The study staff 
will ensure that all subjects and parents/guardians are familia r with the correct storage 
conditions and provided with written storage instructions befor e any product is dispensed. 
 
8.2. Investigational Treatment 
8.2.1.  Dosing Schedule and Rationale 
Subgam-VF is a 16% subcutaneous IgG product. The weekly dose of  Subgam-VF 
administered will be calculated by [CONTACT_544106]’s stable IGIV 
dose, multiplied by 1.37, a dose adjustment coefficient based o n other licensed subcutaneous 
IgG products.  If the subject was already receiving a weekly SCIG IgG there will be no dose adjustment. The Subgam-VF dose should remain the same throughou t the study, if a subject’s 
weight changes by >5% compared with baseline (screening) or the  previous visit, the dose 
should be adjusted accordingly with the aim of maintaining a stable dose in terms of mg/kg.   
If the dosage needs to be increased to achieve the required tro ugh IgG level, then this should 
first be discussed with the CRO Medical Monitor, who will, if n eeded, discuss with the 
Sponsor.  
8.2.2.  Product Preparation 
Before use, all vials must be inspected visually for discolorat ion, particles and fibers; if the 
contents of a vial is cloudy or contain particulate material, t he vial must not be used.  
Subgam-VF is to be infused at room temperature (vial not cold w hen touched).

be used for the sole information of the Investigator’s team and Staff must undertake not to disclose any such information to 
any person not involved in the study.  8.2.3.  Method of Administration 
Subgam-VF should only be infused subcutaneously using an infusi on pump.  Subgam-VF can 
be infused into the following sites: abdomen, thigh, upper arm and/or lateral hip. 
 
The dose of Subgam-VF can be given into multiple infusion sites  (although this should be no 
more than six sites, and eight sites for subjects ≥100 kg).  If  more sites are needed to achieve a 
full dose, then the sites can be used consecutively, but the in fusions should be at least two 
inches apart.   
 
Only one batch of Subgam-VF should be infused during any one in fusion session.  
 
Subgam-VF infusions will be administered in accordance with the  table below, the maximum 
volumes and flow rates may be reduced according to tolerability . 
 
Table 1 – Recommended infusion  flow rates for Subgam-VF  
 
 V o l u m e R a t e
First infusion 20 mL/site 20 mL/hr/site 
Maximum at 
subsequent infusions Up to 30 mL/site Up to 30 mL/hr/site 
 
 Up to six infusion sites can be used simultaneously. Subjects w eighing ≥[ADDRESS_711193] be used 
consecutively (during the same infusion).  
 Any increase in flow rate or number of sites should first be tr ied whilst the subject is in 
the clinic.  However, the infusions must be administered at the  volume and rate 
outlined in Table 1 throughout the entire infusion.  Titration during the infusion is 
not allowed.  
  
 For young children or adults of below average weight lower flow  rates may be used, 
depending on tolerability.  
Details on how to prepare and administer the Subgam-VF infusion  can be found in the Patient 
Medication Guide.  
Full training must be provided to the subject prior to self-adm inistration at home or other 
appropriate setting. It is aimed to start home-therapy at Week 3, however if the subject 
requires further training this will be provided (i.e. it is not  mandatory that the infusions are 
performed at home from Week 3).   
 
Lack of tolerance at any given rate must be recorded as an AE a t that rate.  If a subject has had 
the same treatment related AE at the same rate twice, and those  AEs have been recorded, then 
subsequent infusion rate should be halted at the previously hig hest tolerated rate.

be used for the sole information of the Investigator’s team and Staff must undertake not to disclose any such information to 
any person not involved in the study.   
If any AE(s) occur, these will be documented as detailed in sec tion 10.3.  The infusion may 
then be resumed at a rate tolerated by [CONTACT_423]. 
 
8.2.4.  Product Accountability 
The Investigator is responsible for the accountability of all u sed and unused product utilized 
in the study.  Produ ct accountability must b e maintained as det ailed in the Pharmacy Manual. 
 
An IP accountability log for Subgam-VF must be kept current by [CONTACT_779].  
 
The Pharmacy Manual will contain further information on IP acco untability during the study, 
including disposal.  
 
Subgam-VF must not be used outside of this protocol and must no t be used for subjects who 
are not in this study. 
 
8.3. Treatment Compliance 
Subgam-VF will be administered subcutaneously both at the study  site and also by 
[CONTACT_6270]-administration at home.  Subjects will be required to keep  diaries and records of Subgam-
VF usage.  Site staff will check at each study site visit that the product is being stored 
appropriately, administered corre ctly and safely and the correc t volume infused. 
 
9. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
9.1. Primary Efficacy Variables  
As this is a pharmacokinetic and safety study, no formal effica cy analyses are planned. 
10. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY  
10.1. Safety Variables 
Safety endpoints include assessment of adverse events and adver se drug reactions, significant 
changes in vital signs, safety laboratory parameters (including  kidney and liver function and 
Direct Coombs’ test), virology, physical examination or medical history during the study. 
Study Protocol SCIG03, Version 6, [ADDRESS_711195] party without the written permission of Bio Products Laboratory Ltd. (BPL).  It shall 
be used for the sole information of the Investigator’s team and Staff must undertake not to disclose any such information to 
any person not involved in the study.   
The variables used to assess s afety will be the following: 
 Adverse Events 
 The number and percent of adverse events (AEs) including infusi on site 
reactions. 
 The number and percent of infusions associated with one or more  AEs that begin 
during the infusion, up to one hour, 24 hours, 48 hours or with in 72 hours after 
completion of the infusion.  
 An adverse reaction will be defined as any TEAE (irrespective o f causality) that 
occurs during the infusion or within [ADDRESS_711196] related or any AE with unknown causality.  
 Thrombotic events  
 Nature, severity, and freque ncy of AEs (tolerability) 
 Suspected unexpected serious adve rse reactions (SU SARs), if any 
 Vital signs 
 Clinical laboratory tests including tests for hemolysis 
 Transmission of viruses 
 Physical examination 
 
10.2. Adverse Events 
 The definitions and procedures for reporting AEs is detailed in  Appendix I.    AEs will 
be documented from the date the Informed Consent Form or Assent  F orm  is si gned 
until the follow-up visit and then monitored up to [ADDRESS_711197] working day after Day 3 as possible. 
 
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the A E based on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information.  It is the diagnosis that sh ould be documented as the AE and 
not the individual symptoms . 
 
An adverse reaction will be defined as any TEAE (irrespective o f causality) that occurs during 
the infusion or within [ADDRESS_711198] party without the written permission of Bio Products Laboratory Ltd. (BPL).  It shall

any person not involved in the study.  related or any AE with unknown causality..  Also see the most c urrent Subgam-VF 
Investigator’s Brochure listing common product-related AEs6. 
 
10.3. Infusion Site Reactions  
Infusion site reactions will be assessed during the study site infusion visits by [CONTACT_544107], but also rated by [CONTACT_544108].   
 
Subjects will inspect infusion s ites and record any infusion si te reactions (including date and 
time) into their study diary.  Subjects will use the following criteria to grade all infusion site 
reactions in their study diary: 
 
Mild : no limitation to normal activities 
Moderate : some limitation to normal activities 
Severe:  inability to carry out normal activity.

when the symptoms/signs lead to infusion stop, require concomitant medication, or have an 
impact on the general condition of the subject as judged by [CONTACT_737]. The Investigator 
will also use their judgment to record the severity of the AE a nd may use the subjects diary 
grading to aid that decision. 
11. ASSESSMENT OF PHARMACOKINETICS 
11.1. Pharmacokinetics of Subgam-VF  for Total IgG Levels 
All subjects will undergo a PK assessment (see Appendix IV, Tab le 2 and 3 for the sampling 
time points). 
  
Where possible, samples from Steady State Day 1 (24 hours after  the infusion at Week 21 or 
if delayed, up to Week 25) onwards may be collected at the subj ect’s home by [CONTACT_544109].  Alternativel y a Home Health Agency may 
be utilized to take the PK samples outside of the investigation al site. The subject would be 
required to sign an IRB/EC approved consent form to permit the site to share the subject’s 
details with the agency in order for them to collect the sample . 
 
The following PK variables for t otal IgG levels will be determi ned for the PK population: 
 AUC (0- )  - area under the plasma concentr ation-time curve of the dosing interval.   
 sAUC (0-) - area under the plasma concentration-time curve of the dosing in terval 
standardized to one week. This will be calculated for the histo rical data only. 
Study Protocol SCIG03, Version 6, [ADDRESS_711199] party without the written permission of Bio Products Laboratory Ltd. (BPL).  It shall 
be used for the sole information of the Investigator’s team and Staff must undertake not to disclose any such information to 
any person not involved in the study.   Cmax – maximum concentration in plasma.  
 tmax – time to reach the maximum concentration in plasma.  
 CL– systemic clearance.  
The timing of the collection of blood samples for PK should be a s  p e r  T a b l e  [ADDRESS_711200] ate of Subgam-VF.   
 
A variation of <10% is allowed in the timing for samples as fol lows: 
Steady State Day 1 (24 hours) ± 2 hours,  Steady State Day 2 (48 hours) ± 4 hours  Steady State Day 3 (72 hours) ± 6 hours 
Steady State Day 5 (120 hours) ± 8 hours  
Steady State Day 7 (168 hours) ± 12 hours.    
All PK parameters will be calculated based on absolute (uncorre cted) and baseline-adjusted 
(i.e. trough-adjusted at steady state) concentrations.  
 
Details of the PK methods will be outlined in a PK Analysis Pla n.  The PK Analysis Plan will 
be finalized before database lock. 
 
11.2. Other Pharmacokinetic Parameters 
The following PK parameters will  be listed and summarized descr iptively for the ITT 
population:  
 Trough serum IgG levels (measured before every infusion adminis tered at the study 
site). 
 Trough levels of serum IgG subcl asses will be measured prior to  certain infusions. 
 Levels of specific antibodies ( Haemophilus influenzae  B, Streptococcus pneumoniae, 
Measles ) will be measured prior to certain infusions.  The measles assay is for research 
purposes only and will not be reported to the investigational s ite. 
 
12. INTERIM ANALYSIS 
There is no planned interim analysis for this study, however af ter sufficient adult PK data has 
been collected, a review of the blood sampling schedules for ch ildren will be performed and 
the PK sampling will be optimiz ed and reduced if possible. 
 13. STATISTICAL METHODS  
Details of the statistical methods will be outlined in the Stat istical Analysis Plan.  The 
Statistical Analysis Plan will be finalized before database loc k. 
 
Study Protocol SCIG03, Version 6, [ADDRESS_711201] party without the written permission of Bio Products Laboratory Ltd. (BPL).  It shall 
be used for the sole information of the Investigator’s team and Staff must undertake not to disclose any such information to 
any person not involved in the study.  13.1. Sample Size Determination 
This study will enroll up to 50 subjects to ensure 30 evaluable  s u bje c t s.  A sa m ple  si ze  of  
approximately 18 adults (aged 16-75 years) and 12 children (age d between or equal to 2 and 
15 years), has been decided as recommended by [CONTACT_544110]2.  For 
this study, the children will be enrolled across the age groups of [ADDRESS_711202] one infusion of Subgam-VF will be included in the safety analysis. Due to the potential 
for early withdrawals, PK data may not be available on all 12 c hildren and there may be less 
than 12 evaluable children in the PK analysis. The total number  of subjects (adults plus 
children) evaluable for PK analysis will be at least 30.  
 
 Data will be compared to historical data from previous Gammaplex IGIV studie s.  All the 
subjects will undergo a PK assessment.    
Assuming no true difference exists in average exposure compared  with the historical data, 30 
evaluable subjects will give greater than 98% power of concludi ng equivalence assuming a 
between-subject coefficient of variation (CV) of 18.2 % (equivalently, a standard deviation of 
logged data of 0.181).  If there is a true difference of 10%, p ower drops to 86%. 
 
13.2. Analysis Population 
13.2.1. Intent-to-treat ( ITT) Population 
All subjects who receive at least one infusion of Subgam-VF wil l be included in the intent-to-
treat (ITT) population.  The ITT population will be used for al l safety analyses, summaries of 
demography and the following PK parameters: trough serum IgG le vels, IgG subclasses and 
specific antibodies.  
13.2.2. PK population 
The PK population will comprise of subjects in the Subgam PK po pulation and subjects in the 
Gammaplex PK population as described below.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Subgam PK population 
All subjects in the ITT population who have a pre-dose sample a t steady state and at least four 
post-dose samples at steady state, one of them should be the St eady State Day [ADDRESS_711203] who provides IgG levels at the PK asse ssment but does not meet the 
criteria for inclusion in the Subgam PK population, data will b e listed only. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Gammaplex PK population 
All subjects from Gammaplex 5% IGIV PID studies (GMX01 and GMX0 4) who had an 
evaluable AUC 0-τ.    
 
Study Protocol SCIG03, Version 6, [ADDRESS_711204] party without the written permission of Bio Products Laboratory Ltd. (BPL).  It shall 
be used for the sole information of the Investigator’s team and Staff must undertake not to disclose any such information to 
any person not involved in the study.  [IP_ADDRESS]. PK Dose-Adjustment population 
The PK Dose-Adjustment population is the subset of the PK popul ation which excludes 
subjects in the Subgam PK population who had prior treatment wi th another subcutaneous 
weekly IgG product. Thus the PK Dose-Adjustment population incl udes all the Gammaplex 
PK population and those in the Subgam PK population who had pre vious treatment with 
IGIV. This population is analysed to estimate a refined dose ad justment factor. 
 
13.3. Efficacy Analyses 
As this is a pharmacokinetic and safety study, no formal effica cy analyses are planned. 
 
13.4. Safety Analysis 
13.4.1. Adverse Events 
Summaries of AEs will be based on treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs ), defined as those 
events with onset date between the first infusion date and [ADDRESS_711205] infusion.  
 
The number and percent of infusions associated with one or more  A E s  ( i r r e s p e c t i v e  o f  
causality) that occur during the infusion or within 72 hours af ter completion of the infusion 
will be calculated.  A 1-sided 95% upper confidence bound for t his percent will be derived.  If 
the upper bound is less than 40%, excluding local infusion site  reactions, the incidence of 
infusion-related AEs associated with Subgam-VF will be consider ed acceptable.  In addition, 
the number and percent of subjects who report any AEs and the number and percent of subjects who report any AEs at least possibly related to Subgam -VF will be calculated, and 
the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for the percenta ges will be presented.  AEs 
occurring during the infusion and within 1, 24, [ADDRESS_711206] party without the written permission of Bio Products Laboratory Ltd. (BPL).  It shall 
be used for the sole information of the Investigator’s team and Staff must undertake not to disclose any such information to 
any person not involved in the study.  13.4.2. Other Safety Analyses 
All other safety assessments wil l be summarized descriptively. 
 
13.5. IgG subclasses and IgG antibodies 
The trough levels of IgG subclasses and IgG antibodies against specified antigens will be 
summarized descriptively for all the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) subj ects.  This analysis will be 
conducted for subjects 2 to 5 years of age, 6 to 11 years of ag e, 12 to 15 years of age, all 
pediatric subjects (2 to 15 years of age), all adult subjects ( aged 16 years and over), then for 
all subjects. 
   
13.6. Pharmacokinetic Analyses 
The pharmacokinetics of Subgam-VF will be based on absolute and  baseline-adjusted (trough 
a d j u s t e d  a t  s t e a d y  s t a t e )  v a l u e s  a n d  w i l l  b e  d e s c r i b e d  u s i n g  a  non-compartmental method.  
Actual sample times rather than nominal times will be used to calculate pharmacokinetic 
parameters.    
The following PK parameters will be calculated for the Subgam P K population: The 
maximum observed concentration (C
max), the time at which C max was apparent (t max), the area 
under the concentration versus time curve within a dosing inter val (AUC 0-τ) and the systemic 
clearance (CL). 
 Pharmacokinetic variables will be summarized descriptively.  Th is analysis will be conducted 
for subjects 2 to 5 years of age, 6 to 11 years of age, 12 to 15 years of age, all pediatric 
subjects (2 to 15 years of age), all adult subjects (aged 16 years and over), then for all 
subjects.  
For the Gammaplex PK population, sAUC
0-τ will be calculated as the area under the 
concentration versus time curve within a dosing interval (21 or  28 days), standardized to one 
week i.e. AUC 0- (21 day)/3 or AUC 0- (28 day)/4. For the Subgam PK population, sAUC 0- is 
equivalent to AUC 0- (i.e. no standardization required as dosing is weekly). 
 
All PK data collected on all subjects in the Subgam PK populati on will be listed.  The PK 
population i.e. Subgam PK population combined with the Gammaple x PK population 
(historical data following administration of Gammaplex 5% IGIV)  will be used for the 
primary and secondary statistical PK analyses.  
 
The trough levels of total IgG will be summarized descriptively  for all the subjects in the ITT 
population.  Trough levels in the ITT population will be compar ed with those from the 
Gammaplex PK population.    
Study Protocol SCIG03, Version 6, [ADDRESS_711207] party without the written permission of Bio Products Laboratory Ltd. (BPL).  It shall 
be used for the sole information of the Investigator’s team and Staff must undertake not to disclose any such information to 
any person not involved in the study.  13.6.1. Primary Statistical Analysis 
Data will be pooled with historical data and a treatment variab le defined (Subgam-VF or 
Gammaplex IGIV).  Log transformed sAUC (0-),  (AUC (0-) standardized to one week) will be 
analyzed using a mixed model fitted including treatment, and al lowing for variability to be 
different between treatment groups.  The mean difference (Subga m-VF or Gammaplex IGIV) 
between treatments with 90% Confidence Interval (CI) will be ba ck transformed to give an 
estimate of the ratio (Subgam- VF/ Gammaplex IGIV) of sAUC (0-).  If the resulting 90% CI 
for the ratio lies within the equivalence limit of (0.80, 1.25) , it will be concluded that there is 
equivalence in sAUC (0-)  and thus the dosing factor of 1.37 for Subgam-VF (in addition t o the 
adjustment for dosing interval) gives equivalent exposure at st eady state to  Gammaplex 
IGIV.    
13.6.2. Secondary Statistical Analyses 
i. The primary analysis method will be repeated with data derived from baseline-
adjusted concentrations. 
ii. A term for dosing interval withi n treatment will be included in  the model described 
in the primary analysis so that ratios with 90% CI can be prese nted for Subgam-VF 
relative to both the 21 day and 28 day dosing interval regimens  of Gammaplex. 
iii. The primary analysis model will be extended to include any sign ificant (at the 10% 
level) covariates or covariate by [CONTACT_9900].  Cova riates considered for 
inclusion will include age category, weight, BMI and sex. 
iv. The effect of previous treatment (SCIG or IGIV) on AUC (0-) in the Subgam PK 
population will be analysed. If the resulting 90% CI for the ra tio lies within the 
equivalence limit of (0.80, 1.25), it will be concluded that th e previous treatment 
does not affect exposure at steady state. If this is the case t hen the refined dose 
adjustment with 90% CI will be presented on the full PK populat ion (in addition to 
on the PK Dose Adjustment population described below).  
v. In addition, the data from the current study will be restricted  t o  a  P K  D o s e  
Adjustment population and analysed as per the primary analysis.   A refined dose 
adjustment will be estimated as 1.37/the ratio (Subgam-VF / Gammaplex IGIV) of 
geometric means for sAUC (0-) and presented with 90% CI. 
13.6.3. Exploratory Analysis 
PK modelling will be performed to explore alternative dosing sc hedules. For example; PK 
modelling and simulation will be carried out to compare weekly administration to a biweekly 
schedule at double the weekly dose and assess IgG exposure. 
 
Full details of the PK and associated statistical methods will be described in a PK Analysis 
Plan.

S[LOCATION_003]R Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction 1. Definitions of Adverse Events 
 
1.1 Adverse Events Definition: Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the 
use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
 An adverse event (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavora ble and 
unintended sign (e.g. an abnorma l laboratory finding), symptom,  or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a drug, and does not imply any judgm ent about causality. An 
adverse event can arise with any use of the drug (e.g., off-lab el use, use in combination 
with another drug) and with any route of administration, formul ation, or dose, including 
an overdose.  
All AEs, whether or not considered by [CONTACT_544112] (test 
product, comparator or placebo), must be described and recorded  on the appropriate 
Adverse Event forms in the case report form (CRF)/electronic ca se report form (eCRF). 
Where possible, a diagnosis should be made. Anticipated fluctua tions of preexisting 
conditions, including the disease under study, that do not repr esent a clinically significant 
exacerbation or worsening need not be considered AEs. 
Infusion-Related Adverse Events 
All AEs that occur from the start of the infusion until [ADDRESS_711214] party without the writte n permission of Bio Products Laboratory Ltd. (BPL).  It 
shall be used for the sole information of the Investigator’s team and Staff must undertake not to disclose any such 
information to any person not involved in the study.  Clinical Laboratory and Other Adverse Events 
A laboratory result that is considered by [CONTACT_30386] b e clinically significant or 
have a clinically significant pathological change from baseline  should be recorded as an 
AE. 
 
Other abnormal results (e.g. x-rays, scans, physical examinatio n findings) that worsen 
from baseline and/or are considered clinically significant shou ld also be recorded as AEs. 
The Investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assess ment is clinically 
significant. 
 
Reporting 
Adverse events should be reported and documented in accordance with the procedures 
outlined in this section. All AEs  occurring during the study mu st be documented on the 
relevant CRF/eCRF pages. The following data should be documente d for each AE: 
 
 Description of the symptom event 
 Classification of "serious" or "not serious" 
 Severity 
 Date of first occurrence and date  of resolution (if applicable) 
 Action taken 
 Causal relationship 
 Outcome of event (unknown, recovered, not yet recovered, recove red with 
sequelae, death [with date and cause reported]) 
Pregnancy 
Subjects will be instructed that  a known or suspected pregnancy  occurring during the 
study should be reported to the Investigator. The Investigator should also be notified of a 
pregnancy occurring during the study but confirmed after comple tion of the study. If a 
subject is found to be pregnant after inclusion in the study, the subject must be withdrawn 
from the study. Any pregnancy will be followed to term and the status of mother and 
child will be reported to th e Sponsor after delivery. 
 Full details of any pregnancy will be recorded on the AE page o f the CRF/eCRF, and a 
Pregnancy Report Form will be completed. A copy of the Pregnanc y Report Form must 
be faxed to the CRO within [ADDRESS_711215] party without the writte n permission of Bio Products Laboratory Ltd. (BPL).  It 
shall be used for the sole information of the Investigator’s team and Staff must undertake not to disclose any such 
information to any person not involved in the study.  be advised of the risks of pregnancy in accordance with the rel evant product information 
for their ongoing therapy. 
 
1.2  Suspected Adverse Reaction 
 
Definition: Suspected adverse reaction mean s any adverse event for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND 
safety reporting, ‘reasonabl e possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the ad verse event. A suspecte d adverse reaction 
implies a lesser degree of certainty about ca usality than adverse reaction, which means 
any adverse event caused by a drug. 
 
The following are examples of types of evidence that would sugg est a causal relationship 
between the drug and the adverse event to determine  Reasonable possibility .  
 
 A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to b e strongly 
associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury , Stevens-Johnson 
Syndrome)  
 
 One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associ ated with drug 
exposure, but is otherwise unco mmon in the population exposed t o the drug (e.g. 
tendon rupture)  
 
 An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical  trial (such as 
known consequences of the underlying disease o r condition under  investigation or 
other events that commonly occur in the study population indepe ndent of drug 
therapy) that indicates those events occur more frequently in t he drug treatment 
group than in a concurrent or historical control group  
 
Suspected adverse reactions are the subset of all adverse events for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event. Inherent  in this definition, and in the 
requirement to report suspected adverse reactions, is the need for the Sponsor to evaluate the 
available evidence and make a judgment about the likelihood tha t the drug actually caused 
the adverse event.  
 1.3 Adverse Reaction  
Definition: An adverse reaction means any adverse event caused by a drug. Adverse 
reactions are a subset of all suspected ad verse reactions where there is reason to 
conclude that the drug caused the event.  
 
 1.4 Serious Adverse Event or  Suspected Adv erse Reaction  
Definition: An adverse event or suspected ad verse reaction is considered “serious” if, 
in the view of either the investigator or Sp onsor, it results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
Study Protocol SCIG03, Version 6, [ADDRESS_711216] party without the writte n permission of Bio Products Laboratory Ltd. (BPL).  It 
shall be used for the sole information of the Investigator’s team and Staff must undertake not to disclose any such 
information to any person not involved in the study.   Death,  
 A life-threatening adverse event, [See Section 1.5] 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25411],  
 A persistent or significant incapacity or  substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal li fe functions,  
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surg ical intervention to preve nt one of the outcomes 
listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_544064]-existing 
conditions that did not worsen from baseline)  
 
If either the Sponsor or investigator believes that the event i s serious, the event must be 
considered serious and evaluated by [CONTACT_544113] r eporting.  
 
The following events o f special interest will always be regarde d as serious:: 
 
 Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reaction 
 Myocardial infarction 
 Stroke 
 Pulmonary embolism 
 Any thromboembolic event (TEE) 
 Laboratory documented infection with blood borne virus 
 Acute renal failure 
 Any transmissible spongiform encephalopathy 
 In general, information that might materially affect the risk-benefit assessment of a medicinal product or that would suggest changes in the way it is to be administered or to 
the way a clinical investigation should be conducted should be reported in an expedited 
manner. Examples include the following: 
 
 Single case reports of an expected adverse reaction with an unexpected outcome (e.g. fatal outcome) 
 For an expected serious adverse reaction, an increase in the ra te of occurrence that 
is judged to be clinically important 
 A significant hazard to the patient population, such as lack of  efficacy in treating 
life-threatening diseases or an event which is significant enou gh to lead to

shall be used for the sole information of the Investigator’s team and Staff must undertake not to disclose any such 
information to any person not involved in the study.  important changes in the way a medicine is developed (e.g. chan ge in dose, 
monitoring, consent forms). 
 A major new safety finding from a newly completed animal study 
 An SAE associated with a study procedure that could modify the conduct of the 
trial  
1.5.  Life-Threatening Definition: An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is co nsidered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places 
the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or 
suspected adverse reaction that, had it occu rred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death. 
 
As with the definition of serious, the determination of whether an adverse event is life-
threatening can be based on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_544065]. Thus, if either 
believes that it meets the defin ition of life-threatening, it m ust be considered life-threatening 
for reporting purposes  
 1.6 Unexpected Adverse Event or Suspected Adverse Reaction 
 
Definition: An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity 
that has been observed; or, if an Investigator’s Brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or 
elsewhere in the current application, as amended. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14213]) if the Investigator’s Brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral 
thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_36093]) if the Inve stigator’s Brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. 
"Unexpected," as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected 
adverse reactions that are mentioned in the Investigator’s Brochure as occurring with 
a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under 
investigation.  
1.7 Serious and Unexpected Suspe cted Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R)  
The Sponsor must report any suspected adverse reaction to study  treatment (i.e. including 
active comparators) that is both serious and unexpected.  The S ponsor needs to ensure 
that the event meets all three of the definitions:  
 Suspected adverse reaction  
 Serious  
 Unexpected 
 
Study Protocol SCIG03, Version 6, [ADDRESS_711218] party without the writte n permission of Bio Products Laboratory Ltd. (BPL).  It 
shall be used for the sole information of the Investigator’s team and Staff must undertake not to disclose any such 
information to any person not involved in the study.  The Sponsor (or designated Contract Research Organization [CRO] ) shall ensure that all 
relevant information about a S[LOCATION_003]R is reported to the Competent  Authorities and to the 
independent ethics committees (IECs)/institutional review boards (IRBs) concerned.  2. Detecting Adverse Events  
Subjects will be carefully monitored for adverse events that oc cur after the Informed 
Consent Form (ICF) has been sig ned until the [ADDRESS_711219] infusion of study 
medication. At site visits, the Investigator or delegate will q uestion the subjects about 
AEs using a nonleading question such as “How are you feeling?” The Investigator will 
also record AEs reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_748], including AEs recorded in the patient diary. Clinically significant changes in the findings o f physical examination and 
clinically significant abnormalities in the result of objective tests (e.g. laboratory variables, ECG) should be recorded as AEs.  . 
 
2.1 Causality (Assessment of Relationship) All AEs will be recorded in the CRF/eCRF, whether considered to  be related or unrelated 
to the treatment. The record will include the following: a brief description of event (preferably a diagnosis), date and time started and stopped, se verity, outcome, actions 
taken, and classification of the AE. The Investigator should also evaluate the probability 
of a causal relationship of the AE to the study medication according to the following 
criteria:  
 Unrelated:  Clinical event with an incompatible time relationship to IMP 
administration, or that could be explained by [CONTACT_148542], or is incontroverti bly not related to the IMP 
 Unlikel y: Clinical event whose time relationship to IMP administration  makes a 
causal connection improbable, but that could plausibly be expla ined by 
[CONTACT_91336] 
 Possible: Clinical event with a reasonab le time relationship to IMP 
administration, but that could a lso be explained by [CONTACT_19009] 
 Probable: Clinical event with a reasonable time relationship to IMP 
administration, and is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other 
drugs or chemicals 
 Very likely/certain: Clinical event with plausible time relationship to IMP 
administration and that cannot be explained by [CONTACT_544114] 
a study. 
 
It will be assumed that for all AEs classified as having a “pos sible”, “probable” or “very 
likely/certain” relationship to t he study medication, there is reasonable likelihood that the 
Study Protocol SCIG03, Version 6, [ADDRESS_711220] party without the writte n permission of Bio Products Laboratory Ltd. (BPL).  It 
shall be used for the sole information of the Investigator’s team and Staff must undertake not to disclose any such 
information to any person not involved in the study.  AE was causally related to the product. All such AEs will be regarded as “causally related” to the study medication. 
 
2.2 Outcome of Adverse Events The outcome of the AE should be documented as: 
 
1. Recovered / resolved 
2. Recovering / resolving 
3. Not recovered / not resolved 
4. Recovered / resolved with sequelae 
5. Fatal 
6. Unknown 
 
2.3 Action Taken 
The action taken by [CONTACT_544115] d ocumented as: 
 
1. Drug withdrawn 
2. Dose reduced 
3. Dose increased 
4. Dose not changed 
5. Unknown 
6. Not applicable 
 
2.[ADDRESS_711221].  The severity grading is 
independent of seriousness; in other words, a severe event is n ot necessarily serious. The 
Investigator will make an assessment of severity (e.g. mild, mo derate, severe) for each 
AE and SAE reported during the study in accordance with the fol lowing definitions: 
 
Mild: A non-serious adverse drug experience that is usually tra nsient and requires no 
special treatment or intervention.  The experience does not gen erally interfere with usual 
daily activities.  This includes transient laboratory test alte rations. 
 
Moderate: A non-serious adverse drug experience that is allevia ted with simple 
therapeutic treatments.  The experience impacts usual daily act ivities.  This includes 
laboratory test alte rations indicating injury, but without long -term risk. 
 Severe: A non-serious adverse drug experience that requires the rapeutic intervention.  
The experience interrupts usual daily activities.  If hospi[INVESTIGATOR_544066], it becomes a serious adverse event. 
 
3. Adverse Event Follow-up  
All adverse events will be followed: 
 To resolution; or 
Study Protocol SCIG03, Version 6, [ADDRESS_711222] party without the writte n permission of Bio Products Laboratory Ltd. (BPL).  It 
shall be used for the sole information of the Investigator’s team and Staff must undertake not to disclose any such 
information to any person not involved in the study.   Until an underlying condition has been diagnosed; or 
 Until the patient’s condition has stabilized; or 
 For a period of [ADDRESS_711223] becomes pregnant while participating in the stud y, the pregnancy will not 
be recorded as an SAE, but will be captured on the AE page of t he CRF/eCRF and in a 
Pregnancy Report Form and followed through until delivery or el ective/spontaneous 
termination. Any birth defects will be reported as in the proce dures for SAEs (see 
Sections 1 and 4). 
 
4. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
When an AE occurs that fulfils the definition of serious (see Section 1.3), the Investigator 
must:  
Complete and sign the Serious Adverse Event Form and send it to  the CRO within 
24 hours.The CRO will then inform the Sponsor within 24 hours o f receiving the 
SAE notification.  
SAE FAX    [PHONE_11285] 
 Medical coverage for urgent queries relating to AEs will be pro vided on a 24-hour/7-day 
a week basis by [CONTACT_544116] n umber and the call will be 
routed to the Medical Monitor:  
 
Telephone Number   [PHONE_11286]  
The Investigator is responsible for expedited reporting of all Serious Adverse Events 
immediately to the CRO.  This reporting requirement covers any SAEs that develop at 
any point between the date when a subject provides Informed Con sent and up to [ADDRESS_711224] if he/she judges the SAE to be possibly, probably or very likely/certainly related to the product. 
 
The immediate report should contain the following as a minimum:  
 
1. Suspected investigational medicinal product 
2. Study subject number 
3. Details of the serious adverse event 
4. Classification of SAE 
5. Causality of SAE (if available) 
Study Protocol SCIG03, Version 6, [ADDRESS_711225] party without the writte n permission of Bio Products Laboratory Ltd. (BPL).  It 
shall be used for the sole information of the Investigator’s team and Staff must undertake not to disclose any such 
information to any person not involved in the study.   The immediate SAE form should be followed by a detailed, comple te SAE form as soon 
as possible. The immediate report and follow-up reports shall i dentify subjects by [CONTACT_544117].  
Adverse events and/or laboratory abnormalities identified in the protocol as critical to the 
evaluation of safety must be reported to the designated CRO by [CONTACT_544118]. 
 The Investigator must not wait to receive additional informatio n to document fully the 
event before notification of a SAE, though additional informati on may be requested. 
Where applicable, information from relevant laboratory results,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_544067].  
Instances of death, congenital abnormality or an event that is of such clinical concern as 
to influence the overall assessment of safety, if brought to th e attention of the Investigator 
at any time after cessation of IMP administration and linked by  [CONTACT_544119]/Sponsor. 
 The Sponsor or designated CRO will promptly notify all relevant  Investigators and 
regulatory authorities of findings that could adversely affect the safety of patients, affect 
the conduct of the study, or alter the approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_544068]/IRB. In addition, the Sponsor (or designated CRO) will expe dite the reporting of all 
AEs that are serious, unexpected, and, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_176252], related to the 
IMP to all concerned Investigators, the IEC/IRB, where required , and the regulatory 
authorities.  
The Investigator will comply with local requirements related to  the reporting of SAEs, 
IND Safety Notification Letters, and other safety information r elated to the trial to their 
local IRB.  
For reported deaths of a subject, the Investigator shall supply  BPL or designated CRO and 
the Research Ethics Committee with any additional information r equested. 
 
Completing Serious Adverse Event Forms 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) forms must be completed in a timely  manner and contain 
the following information: 
 
 Subject number, sex, age, study center, trial code 
 Description of event (where possible a diagnosis should be made  rather than just 
listing symptoms) 
 Study drug, indication for use, batch number, dose, route, date  a n d  t i m e  o f  l a s t  
dose 
 Date and time of adverse event

shall be used for the sole information of the Investigator’s team and Staff must undertake not to disclose any such 
information to any person not involved in the study.   All concomitant medication 
 Causal relationship to study medication (as in Section 2.1) 
 Outcome (as in Section 2.2) 
 Action taken and treatment given (as in Section 2.3) 
 Severity (as in Section 2.4) 
 Classification of serious adverse event (as in Section 1.4) 
 
The SAE form must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_544120] t he SAE. The final report 
must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_544069]. 
 5. Sponsor’s Responsibilities 
The Sponsor and/or the designated CRO  will be responsible for reporting all relevant 
safety information (including a listing of all S[LOCATION_003]Rs) to the r egulatory authorities and to 
the IRBs/IECs concerned. Safety reports will be issued in accor dance with local relevant 
procedures (as a minimum on an annual basis).  
The Sponsor and/or the designated CRO will inform the relevant Competent 
Authority(ies), in line with regulatory guidelines, of AEs occu rring during the trial. The 
Investigator retains the right to inform the relevant Competent  Authority(ies) if he/she so 
desires but must inform the Sponsor and/or designated CRO so th at duplicate reports to 
the Competent Authority(ies) can be highlighted.  The Sponsor and/or designated CRO will inform all Investigators  of all S[LOCATION_003]Rs 
occurring during the study or findings that could adversely aff ect the safety of subjects.

result is positive at any visit  
m  PK sampling will begin on Week 21 (prior to 21st infusion of Subgam-VF), with the last sample taken on Week [ADDRESS_711287] before the next (22nd) infusion 
given at the site. Where possible, PK samples and assessments f rom Steady State Day 1 onwards could be conducted at the subjec t’s home by [CONTACT_544109], or a Home Hea lth Agency.  See Table 3 for PK schedule. If the PK sampling cannot be completed at 
Week 21 (eg.. due to patients work/vacation schedule) then this  can be delayed to start at Week 22, 23, 24 or 25; however, the  patient should still visit 
the office/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_544058] 21 infusion and complete the other assessments scheduled for Visit 8, if possible. Week 22 assessments (Visit 9) will 
normally coincide with the PK sampling Day 7.  However, if PK s ampling is delayed, Visit [ADDRESS_711288]’s home.  After the Week [ADDRESS_711289]’s care giver is available, the n arrangements may be made to conduct some of the visits at the  subject’s home to reduce the 
number of visits to the sites. Alternatively a Home Health Agen cy may be utilized. The subject would be required to sign an ex tra IRB/EC approved consent 
form to permit the site to share the subject’s details with the  agency in order for them to col lect the samples/conduct the as sessments.

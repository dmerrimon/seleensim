PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:  Phase 2 
STUDY RATIONALE: 
BMN [ADDRESS_377471] degradation by [CONTACT_308446], 
allowing for a longer half-life. 
The pharmacological activity of BMN 111 was explored in two mou se models of ACH, a severe, 
Fgfr3Y367C/+ (TD) model ( Lorget, 2012 ), and a milder [Ach] /+ (Ach) model. These included studies 
in 7-day old TD mice given BMN 111 daily by [CONTACT_202012] f or up to 20 days and a study in 
3-week old Ach mice given BMN 111 daily by [CONTACT_308447] r 5 weeks. Partial or complete 
reversion of the ACH  phenotype was observed in these mouse mode ls after BMN 111 administration. 
In wild-type mice, and normal ra ts and monkeys, BMN 111 adminis tration resulted in growth plate 
expansion and dose-dependent skeletal growth at hemodynamically  tolerated dose levels 
(Wendt, 2015 ). Additionally, the potential effect of age on BMN [ADDRESS_377472] severe 
complication, cervicomedullary compression (CMC), occurs in a s ubset of subjects with ACH due to 
abnormal endochondral bone growth a nd narrowing of the foramen magnum ( White, 2016 ). CMC has 
been linked to serious respi[INVESTIGATOR_308340], apnea, ataxia, 
developmental delay, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_308341] ( Mukherjee, 2014 ). Foramen 
magnum decompression surgery is c urrently the only treatment fo r this condition.   
Sleep apnea has also been extensi vely described in ACH, and sle ep-disordered breathing may affect up 
to 85% of all children with ACH ( Ireland, 2012 ). This is thought to be due to midface hypoplasia, 
relative adenotonsillar hypertroph y, and potential posterior cr anial fossa compression secondary to 
abnormal endochondral bone growth . Sleep apnea in ACH not only results in the need for surgical 
intervention, but has also been linked to sudden death in rare cases ( Pauli, 1984 ).   
Similarly, the dysregulation of e ndochondral bone growth in ACH  leads to other medical

complications which are prevale nt in this subject population, s uch as the following: 
 Spi[INVESTIGATOR_16078], kyphosis, and lo rdosis (secondary to altered g rowth plate ossification in the 
vertebrae and narrowing of the interpedicular distances) ( Shirley, 2009 ) 
 Developmental delay of gross motor and ambulatory skills (assoc iated with proximal limb 
shortening, macrocephaly, and hypotonia) ( Ireland, 2010 ) 
 Delayed functional skills and increased need for caregiver assi stance (eg, eating, bladder 
management, bowel management, t ransfer to chair, climbing stair s) (Ireland, 2011 ) 
Thus, BMN 111 may provide greater benefit when children begin t reatment at a younger age, as earlier 
initiation of treatment allows a  longer time window to improve growth and potential to improve 
medical complications of achondroplasia. This study (111-206) i s being conducted to assess safety and 
the potential benefit of BMN [ADDRESS_377474] tested in humans in Study 111-101, a Phase 1 double-blinded, placebo-controlled 
clinical trial of the safety and tolerability of BMN 111 in hea lthy adult male volunteers without ACH. 
Part 1 examined a series of si ngle subcutaneous doses (5 µg/kg,  10 µg/kg and 15 µg/kg), and Part 2 
included 10 days of either fixed  dosing or dose escalation (0.5  µg/kg to 8 µg/kg). BMN 111 was 
generally well tolerated at all doses. As expected, mild, trans ient, self-limited hypotension was 
reported (refer to current Investigators Brochure for additiona l information). Following SC 
administration, BMN 111 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_308342] a concentrations achieved in less 
than 30 minutes. BMN 111 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_308343] a mean t 1/2 ranging from 40 to 
55 minutes across dose levels. BMN 111 exposure (C max and AUC 0-t) generally increased greater than 
proportional to the increase in dose across the 2.5-to-15-µg/kg  dose range. Exposure following 
multiple dosing was found to be  similar to exposure following s ingle doses, indicating no apparent 
accumulation or time-dependence with once-daily SC administrati on. 
Study 111-202, the second clinical  trial in humans and the firs t in children with ACH, is an ongoing 
Phase 2, open-label, sequential- cohort, dose-escalation study t hat assesses daily SC BMN 111 in 
pediatric subjects with ACH age d 5-14 years with doses ranging from 2.5 µg/kg to 30 µg/kg. The 
primary objective of Study 111-202 is to evaluate the safety an d tolerability of BMN 111 administered 
for 6 months and up to 24 months; the secondary objectives are to determine change from baseline in 
annualized growth velocity (AGV), growth parameters, body propo rtions, and evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of BMN 111 in children with ACH. 
Analysis of safety data from the 6-month initial phase of Study  111-202 showed that treatment with 
BMN 111 for 6 months at the doses of 2.5, 7.5, 15, and 30 µg/kg  was generally well tolerated (refer to 
current Investigator’s Brochure for specific details). One subj ect (30 µg/kg) in 111-[ADDRESS_377475]: BMN 111

White pattern, which was discovered on a routine day 10-study m onitoring ECG. The most common 
AEs across all cohorts were injection site reactions, asymptoma tic hypotension, headache, and 
nasopharyngitis. Based on previous experience of the ongoing Ph ase 2 clinical trial, including the 
24-month data cut at 15 µg/kg, i njection site reactions have be en identified as risks associated with 
BMN 111 injections. The majority of hypotension events were gra de 1 and reported in the setting of 
routine BP measurement. All reporte d events of hypotension were  transient and resolved without 
medical intervention. For a det ailed summary of risks, please r efer to the current version of the 
Investigator’s Brochure supplied by [CONTACT_189447].  
Analysis of efficacy data from the 6-month initial phase of Stu dy 111-202 showed that subjects treated 
with BMN 111 for 6 months at doses ranging from 2.5-15 µg/kg da ily had a dose-dependent 
improvement in AGV, with ~50% improvement in AGV seen at the 15  µg/kg dose. The data from 
Cohort 4 (30 µg/kg) show an appa rent greater than dose-proporti onal increase in BMN 111 plasma 
exposure (C max and AUC 0-t), with a marginal improvement i n both absolute AGV and change from 
baseline AGV after 6 months of BM N 111 treatment when compared with Cohort 3 (15 µg/kg).    
Study 111-206 is a Phase 2 random ized, double-blind, placebo-co ntrolled clinical trial of BMN 111 in 
infants and younger children with  a diagnosis of ACH who are 0 to < 60 months old. This 52-week 
study will enable assessment of BMN 111 efficacy and safety, to lerability, pharmacodynamics 
biomarkers, and PK in this populat ion. Additional exploratory e ndpoints pertaining to medical 
complications of ACH will also be evaluated.   
Efficacy/toxicity studies have b een conducted in neonatal and v ery young animals (7-day postpartum 
mouse and rat) in both a disease (TD mouse) and non-disease (ra t) model. Given that this is the first 
study in infants and young child ren, an age-based cohort study design is used to assess safety and PK 
in young children (Cohort 1, ≥ 24 to < 60 months) prior to dosi ng toddlers (Cohort 2, ≥ 6 
to < 24 months) and infants (Cohort 3, 0 to < 6 months). PK wil l be monitored and evaluated; Day [ADDRESS_377476] of the cohort to target the observed exposure of t he 15-µg/kg dose group in Study 111-202. 
Safety, efficacy and PK data fro m Study 111-202, a Phase 2 stud y in children with ACH, where a dose 
of 15 µg/kg has been and conti nues to be studied, are expected to be the most relevant, and translatable 
to this study (111-206).

Dose Adjustments 
Analysis of available PK data from studies 111-[ADDRESS_377496] 
body weight did not directly tra nslate to differences in total body clearance of BMN 111.  The same 
weight-based dose in the pediatr ic population of Study 111-202 (5-12 years old) yielded lower 
exposure (C max and AUC) than that characterized in the adult population of St udy 111-101.  Therefore, 
the same weight-based dose in the  young pediatric population in  this study may yield exposure less 
than the target exposure range cha racterized to be safe and eff ective in Study 111-202 at the 15-µg/kg 
dose. Since this is the first experience with BMN 111 in this y oung pediatric population, it is also 
possible the exposure at 15 μg/kg could be greater than the tar get exposure range, and dose adjustment 
may be warranted. Thus, an option for adjustment of the weight- based dose is provided to ensure that 
the appropriate target exposure for safety and efficacy is reac hed for the young subj ects in this study.   
The need for dose adjustment w ill be evaluated as follows: thre e sentinel subjects in Cohort 1 will 
receive an initial dose of 15 µg/kg. After all three sentinel s ubjects reach Day 8, a review will occur to 
evaluate all available safety and PK data (at minimum). If the criteria for dose adjustment are met, the 
three sentinel subjects will be sta rted on the new adjusted dos e at their next scheduled visit, and vital 
signs will be obtained for at least [ADDRESS_377497]: BMN 111

Safety and Efficacy Monitoring 
Each treated subject will have expanded outpatient safety monit oring for a minimum of [ADDRESS_377498]-dosing. Because younger c hildren may not be able to verbalize 
complaints of dizziness or lightheadedness that are potentially  associated with hypotension, study 
personnel and caregivers will be trained to recognize the signs  of hypotension in this population, which 
may include tachycardia, pallor, diaphoresis, lethargy, delayed  capi[INVESTIGATOR_39093], and poor feeding. 
Appropriate rigorous training w ill be required for parents and caregivers prior to daily injections at 
home. Training includes the storage, reconstitution, and admini stration of BMN 111, as well as 
documentation/reporting of AEs and vigilance for signs of hypot ension. 
It is generally expected that after subjects are tolerating the  drug well and specified criteria have been 
met, caregivers will begin administering study drug. Home healt h care is not required at any point but 
may be provided if the caregiver is unable or unavailable to ad minister the study drug. A Home 
Healthcare nurse will train the car egiver(s) if training has no t been completed by [CONTACT_48657] [ADDRESS_377499] can be made via email.   
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_51253], serious AEs ( SAEs), laboratory test results 
(urinalysis, chemistry, and hematology), vital signs, physical examination, ECG and echocardiogram, 
hip clinical assessment, and anti-BMN 111 immunogenicity assess ments.  Clinical laboratory tests, 
PK, immunogenicity and blood bioma rker assessments will be limi ted to the minimum necessary for 
evaluation of safety and efficacy  in order to minimize blood vo lume in the pediatric population. 
Efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_308453]/height Z-score. Exploratory 
assessments will include change fro m baseline in growth paramet ers and body proportions by 
[CONTACT_308454]. X-rays will be performed of the lower extremitie s and spi[INVESTIGATOR_308350], quality, and grow th. An MRI will be performed to assess the effect of BMN [ADDRESS_377500]-certified, f ellowship-trained (or equivale nt) pediatric anesthesiologist will 
administer anesthesia during MRI measurements in the event that  the subject is unable to remain still 
for the duration of the scan. Sl eep studies will be conducted t o evaluate sleep apnea. Additional 
assessments will be conducted to ev aluate changes from baseline  in bone metabolism and BMN111 
pharmacodynamic biomarkers, and de velopmental/functional status .

 Study 111-[ADDRESS_377530] common form 
of dwarfism. 
ACH is a rare disease with a  prevalence of 1/[ZIP_CODE] in the US ( Wynn, 2007)  The average 
adult heights for men and women with ACH are 131 cm and 124 cm,  respectively ( NIH, 
Genetics Home Reference, 2012 ).  Characteristic features i nclude long and narrow trunk, a 
large head with frontal bossing, hypoplasia of the mid-face, bo wed legs and stenosis of the 
foramen and spi[INVESTIGATOR_308363]-threatening. Foramen  magnum stenosis can lead to 
cervicomedullary compression in i nfants with complications incl uding hydrocephalus, 
hypotonia, respi[INVESTIGATOR_308364], apnea, cyanotic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841],  feeding problems, 
quadriparesis, and sudden death.  
There is no approved pharmacologi cal therapy for achondroplasia  in the US or EU. Current 
treatments for achondroplasia are focused on neurosurgical inte rventions for foramen 
magnum stenosis or lumbar stenos is, thoracolumbar braces to hel p ameliorate the kyphosis, 
or limb lengthening requiring multiple operations over 2 to 3 y ears (Shirley, 2009), 
(Horton, 2007 ).  
ACH is caused by a gain-of-functi on mutation in FGFR3, a negati ve regulator of 
chondrocyte proliferation and di fferentiation.  The most common  mutation (98%) in ACH 
patients is a G380R substitution in the transmembrane domain of  FGFR3.  The majority of 
new cases (80%) originate from pa rents with normal stature.   
The extracellular signal-regulat ed kinase (ERK) mitogen-activat ed protein kinase (MAPK) 
pathway mediates part of FGFR 3 inhibition of chondrocyte prolif eration and differentiation 
(Foldynova-Trantirkova, 2012 ).  The ERK MAPK pathway is modulated by [CONTACT_308465], a positive 
regulator of chondrocyte prolif eration and differentiation.  Bi nding of CNP to the Natriuretic 
Peptide-Receptor B (NPR-B) ant agonizes FGFR3 downstream signali ng by [CONTACT_308466] (ERK1/2) pathway at the level of RAF-1 ( Krejci, 2005. ); (Yasoda, 2004. ); 
(Yasoda, 2009 ); (Pejchalova, 2007 ).  This crosstalk was demons trated in a mouse model of 
FGFR3-related chondrodysplasia  (Yasoda, 2004); (Yasoda, 2009).  The dwarfism phenotype 
of mice harboring the FGFR3G380R  mutation was rescued by [CONTACT_308467] (infusion). 
CNP is a member of the natriure tic peptide (NP) family that inc ludes Atrial Natriuretic 
Peptide (ANP) and B-type Natriure tic Peptide (BNP). These pepti des are structurally related 
but are distinct paracr ine/autocrine (CNP) or endocrine (ANP an d BNP) factors that regulate

of ANP (anaritide and carperitide)  and BNP (nesiritide) have be en investigated as potential

BMN 111 is a 39-amino acid CNP a nalogue harboring the 37 amino acids of the human 
CNP53 C-terminal sequence a nd modified by [CONTACT_308468] a mino acids (Pro-Gly) on 
the N-terminus.  It is a recomb inant human peptide fused to hum an transcription factor 
(TAF) and expressed as an i nclusion body in E. coli.  BMN 111 i s liberated and solubilized 
from the TAF-fusion protein by [CONTACT_308469], and purifi ed by [CONTACT_308470] ( Long, 2012 ).  BMN 111 was designed to 1) mi mic CNP activities in terms 
of receptor binding and pharmacological activity and 2) be resi stant to neutral endopeptidase 
(NEP) digestion in order to have  an extended half-life in compa rison to CNP that is 
presumed to increase exposure to the target  growth plate ( Wendt, 2015 ).  
A comprehensive review of BMN 11 1 is contained in the current v ersion of the Investigator’s 
Brochure supplied by [CONTACT_189447].  Inve stigators are required to r eview the Investigator’s 
Brochure prior to ini tiating this study. 
7.1 Nonclinical Studies 
The pharmacological activity of BMN 111 was explored in two mou se models of ACH, a 
severe, Fgfr3Y367C/+ model ( Lorget, 2012 ), and a mild [Ach] /+ m odel.  Partial or complete 
reversion of the ACH phenotype w as observed in these mouse mode ls after BMN 111  
administration.  Additionally, in wild-type mice, and normal ra ts and monkeys, BMN 111 
administration resulted in growt h plate expansion and dose-depe ndent skeletal growth at 
hemodynamically tolerated dose levels (Wendt, 2015).  
BMN 111-related adverse findings  in nonclinical species (mice, rats, cynomolgus monkeys) 
were limited to the known mechan ism of action of CNP on the gro wth plate and vasculature.  
Reversible subcutaneous injecti on site reactions were reported,  including injection site 
discoloration and microscopic fi ndings of perivascular mononucl ear cell infiltrates that were 
seen with slightly higher incid ence and severity in BMN 111-tre ated rats and monkeys 
compared to the vehicle control .  Adverse skeletal changes asso ciated with exaggerated 
growth were seen in normal nonc linical species with open growth  plates, and were dose-, 
exposure- and time-dependent. D ecreases in blood pressure and c ompensatory increases in 
heart rate were detected in monke ys across multiple studies, wi th overt CV-related clinical 
signs observed in some animals at doses ≥ 236 µg/kg. These over t clinical signs consisted of 
transient, short and repeated bouts of sternal or lateral recum bency and/or reduced motor 
 Study 111-[ADDRESS_377531]-dose administration.  Ad ditional detailed information 
about nonclinical studies of BMN  111 is provided in the current  version of the I nvestigator’s

7.2 Previous Clinical Studies 
7.2.1 Study 111-101 
Study 111-101, “A Phase 1, Two Part, Double Blind, Placebo-Cont rolled Study to Evaluate 
the Safety, Tolerability, and P harmacokinetics of Single and Mu ltiple Doses of BMN 111 
Administered to Healthy Adult Vo lunteers,” was a first-in-human  study conducted in 2 parts 
to allow for assessment of the s afety, tolerability, and PK of BMN 111 administered as a 
single dose and as a multiple dose to healthy adult male volunt eers. 
Doses ranging from 5.0 µg/kg to 15. 0 µg/kg were administered as  a single daily SC dose; 
doses ranging from 0.5 µg/kg to 8.0 µg/kg were administered in the multiple ascending dose 
segment of the study. As expected, mild, transient, self-limite d hypotension occurred. 
The majority of these cases w ere asymptomatic and observed upon  assumption of an upright 
posture following recumbence. Hypot ension events were reported in the BMN [ADDRESS_377532] 
dose on Day 1 of the multiple dose study in Part 2. The results  demonstrate that BMN 111 
was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_308366], reaching a mean time to peak con centration (T max) between 
15-26 minutes. After reaching maximal plasma concentrations, BM N 111 levels rapi[INVESTIGATOR_308367], with a t 1/2 of 40-55 minutes. Mean plasma concentration-time profiles indi cate that 
exposure increased with dose fr om 2.5 to 15 µg/kg. The correspo nding increases in plasma 
Cmax and area under the curve (AUC) e xposure parameters were greate r than dose 
proportional. The increase in C max with dose was linear over th e dose range evaluated.  
In Part 2, with multiple dosing at 5 µg/kg for 10 days, the pla sma concentration-time curves 
obtained on each of the three sampling days were nearly superim posable. Comparison of PK 
exposure parameters for AUC and C max indicate that C max is unchanged and AUC is

increased slightly by +33% over Day 1.  Overall the results ind icate that changes in 
BMN [ADDRESS_377533] 6 months 
of growth data are collected.  
Data gathered from this study are  used to characterize baseline  growth data in children or 
infants (defined as children <  2 years of age) who may subseque ntly be enrolled in future 
studies sponsored by [CONTACT_189447], and may also be used to establis h historical control cohort 
for use in other BioMarin-spons ored studies, when appropriate. For that reason, data related 
to ACH symptoms, tests, and i nterventions are collected. 
7.3.[ADDRESS_377534] ration of BMN 111 in pediatric s ubjects with ACH. 
The primary objective of Study 111- 202 is to evaluate the safet y and tolerability of BMN 111 
administered for 6 months and up t o 24 months; the secondary ob jectives are to determine 
change from baseline in annua lized growth velocity (AGV), growt h parameters, body 
proportions, and evaluate the dos e-exposure and PK profiles of BMN 111 in children with 
ACH.  
Analysis of safety data from the  6-month initial phase of Study  111-202 showed that 
treatment with BMN 111 for 6 months at dose cohorts of 2.5, 7.5 , 15, and 30 µg/kg 
(Cohorts 1 to 4, respectively) was  generally well tolerated. Th e most common AEs were mild 
injection site reac tions, asymptomatic hypotension, headache, a nd nasopharyngitis. For a 
detailed summary of risks, pleas e refer to the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure 
supplied by [CONTACT_189447].  
Analysis of efficacy data from th e 6-month initial phase of Stu dy 111-202 demonstrated that 
the mean (standard deviation) c hange from baseline AGV when BMN  111 is administered at 
2.5, 7.5, 15, and 30 µg/kg subcutaneously daily for 6 months is  -0.37 (1.592), 1.28 (1.439), 
2.01 (1.999), and 2.08 (2.137) cm/year , respectively.  Thus, a positive dose-dependent 
response was observed in change  from baseline AGV at doses rang ing from 2.5-15 µg/kg 
daily.

7.3.3 Study 111-205 
Study 111-205 is an ongoing open-labe l, Phase 2 extension study  to assess long-term safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy of BMN 11 1 in children with ACH. Sub jects continue receiving the 
same stable dose of BMN 111 received upon completion of the 111 -202 study (up to 
30 µg/kg daily). This 5-year study allows for long-term assessm ent of the effect of daily 
BMN [ADDRESS_377535] completi ng 2 years of BMN 111 treatment in Study 111-202 (7 years 
total BMN 111 treatment duration) . Additional exploratory endpo ints are being examined to 
determine long-term effects of BMN 111 on bone physiology and t he medical complications 
of ACH. 
7.3.4 Study 111-301 
Study 111-301 is an ongoing Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-cont rolled multicenter study to 
further characterize and conf irm efficacy and safety of BMN 111  at 15 µg/kg in a 58-week 
study (up to 4 weeks of screening, 52  weeks of treatment, plus an additional 2 weeks of 
safety follow up). The study asse sses the effect of daily BMN 1 11 administration on change 
from baseline in AGV, height , and body proportions in subjects treated with BMN 111 
compared with control subjects in the placebo group; and furthe r characterizes safety and 
tolerability of BMN [ADDRESS_377536] degradation by 
[CONTACT_308446], allowing for a longer half-life. 
The pharmacological activity of BMN 111 was explored in two mou se models of ACH, a 
severe, Fgfr3Y367C/+ (TD) model ( Lorget, 2012 ), and a milder [Ach] /+ (Ach) model. These 
included studies in 7-day ol d TD mice given BMN 111 daily by [CONTACT_308471] 
20 days and a study in 3 week old A ch mice given BMN 111 daily by [CONTACT_275269] 
5 weeks. Partial or complete re version of the ACH phenotype was  observed in these mouse 
models after BMN 111 administr ation. In wild-type mice, and nor mal rats and monkeys, 
BMN 111 administration resulted i n growth plate expansion and d ose-dependent skeletal 
growth at hemodynamically tolerated dose levels ( Wendt, 2015 ). Additionally, the potential 
 Study 111-[ADDRESS_377537] 
severe complication, cervicomedu llary compression (CMC), occurs  in a subset of subjects 
with ACH due to abnormal endoc hondral bone growth and narrowing  of the foramen 
magnum ( White, 2016 ). CMC has been linked to seri ous respi[INVESTIGATOR_308368],  apnea, ataxia, developmental  delay, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_308369] ( Mukherjee, 2014 ). Foramen magnum decompression surgery 
is currently the only treat ment for this condition.   
Sleep apnea has also been exten sively described in ACH, and sle ep-disordered breathing may 
affect up to 85% of all children with ACH ( Ireland, 2012 ). This is thought to be due to 
midface hypoplasia, relative adenotonsillar hypertrophy, and po tential posterior cranial fossa 
compression secondary to abnormal endochondral bone growth. Sle ep apnea in ACH not 
only results in the need for sur gical intervention, but has als o been linked to sudden death in 
rare cases ( Pauli, 1984 ).   
Similarly, the dysregulation of e ndochondral bone growth in ACH  leads to other medical 
complications which are prevalen t in this subj ect population, s uch as the following: 
 Spi[INVESTIGATOR_16078], kyphosis, and lor dosis (secondary to altered g rowth plate ossification 
in the vertebrae and na rrowing of the interpe dicular distances)  (Shirley, 2009 ) 
 Developmental delay of gross moto r and ambulatory skills (assoc iated with proximal 
limb shortening, macrocephaly, and hypotonia) ( Ireland, 2010 ) 
 Delayed functional skills and incr eased need for caregiver assi stance (eg, eating, 
bladder management, bowel management, transfer to chair, climbi ng stairs) 
(Ireland, 2011 ) 
Thus, BMN 111 may provide greater benefit when children begin t reatment at a younger age, 
as earlier initiati on of treatment allows  a longer time window to improve growth and 
potential to improve medical com plications of achondroplasia. T his study (111-206) is being 
conducted to assess safety and the  potential benefit of BMN 111  in infants and young 
children.

of change from baseline in AGV, growth parameters, body proport ions, and evaluation of the 
dose-exposure and PK profiles  of BMN 111 in children with ACH.  
Analysis of safety data from the  6-month initial phase of Study  111-202 showed that 
treatment with BMN 111 was genera lly well tolerated at all dose  levels (refer to current 
Investigators Brochure for specific details).  
Analysis of efficacy data fro m Study 111-202 demonstrated that that subjects given 
BMN 111 at the dose of 15 µg/kg daily had an improvement in AGV , with approximately 
~50% increase over baseline see n with treatment for 6 months wh ich was sustained after 
continued treatment for 12 months.  
Subjects treated with 30 µg/kg da ily also showed similar improv ement in mean AGV after 
6 months and their mean changes from baseline in AGV were simil ar to subjects treated with 
15 µg/kg daily. Safety data for the  30-µg/kg daily dose was als o similar to the 15-µg/kg daily 
dose.  Given that no clinically s ignificant difference could be  identified between the 
15-µg/kg and 30-µg/kg daily dose in  the Phase 2, 6-month safety  and efficacy data, the lower 
of the two doses has been chos en for this Phase 2 study.

7.5 Summary of Overall Risks and Benefits 
7.5.1 Summary of Risks from Nonclinical Studies 
Individuals in this study will be exposed to a recombinant anal ogue of human C-type 
natriuretic peptide (C NP). Based on the results of experimentat ion in animals, the most 
relevant potential toxicities r elate to the expected pharmacolo gical effects of exogenous CNP 
administration, including hemodynami c changes, skeletal overgro wth, and injection site 
reactions. Transient and sporad ic decreases in blood pressure a nd compensating increases in 
heart rate occurred within the f irst hour post-dose in cynomolg us monkeys; the effects were 
mainly asymptomatic with a s ubset of animals given doses ≥ 236 µg/kg observed with 
symptomatic effects consisting of  transient, short and repeated  bouts of sternal or lateral 
recumbency and/or reduced motor activity. These hemodynamic eff ects can be monitored, 
but have the potential to be an acute dose-limiting factor in p atients.  Exaggerated 
appendicular bone responses to t he drug included abnormally sha ped femoral head, 
acetabular growth center/plate dys plasia and concomitant articu lar cartilage degeneration 
with clinical manifestations of  restricted use of hips. Adverse  skeletal changes associated 
with exaggerated growth were dos e-, exposure- and time-dependen t. Additional detailed 
information about risks identifie d in nonclinical  studies of BM N 111 is provided in the

Additional sentinels may be adde d to any cohort if needed for a dditional safety and/or PK 
assessment. 
Each treated subject will have e xpanded outpatient safety monit oring for a minimum of 
[ADDRESS_377557]-dosing . Because younger children 
may not be able to verbalize comp laints of dizziness or lighthe adedness that are potentially 
associated with hypotension, study p ersonnel and caregivers wil l be trained to recognize the 
signs of hypotension in this populat ion, which may include tach ycardia, pallor, diaphoresis, 
lethargy, delayed capi[INVESTIGATOR_308370], and poor feeding. Appropria te rigorous training will be 
required for parents and caregiver s prior to daily injections a t home. Traini ng includes the 
storage, reconstitution, and administration of BMN 111, as well  as documentation/reporting 
of AEs and vigilance for signs of hypotension. 
It is generally expected that af ter subjects are tolerating the  drug well and sp ecified criteria 
have been met, caregivers will  begin administering study drug. Home health care is not 
required at any point but may be prov ided if the caregiver is u nable or unavailable to 
administer the study drug. A Home Healthcare nurse will train t he caregiver(s) if training has 
not been completed by [CONTACT_48657] [ADDRESS_377558] can be made via email.   
Duration of the study is 52 weeks  of treatment with a safety fo llow up at Week 56. Following 
completion of the study, subjects  in all treatments groups may be eligible to receive 
BMN 111 in an open-label extensi on study, to assess safety and efficacy of BMN 111 over 
the longer term.  For subjects enrolling into the extension stu dy, safety follow up visit at 
Week 56 will be waived.

post-dose.  
b All blood tests at Screening vis it should be obtained between D ay -[ADDRESS_377559] has ever had; any 
prior or existing medical conditions that might interfere with study participation or safety. 
d Standing height of the particip ant’s biological parents will be  assessed.  Prior to the measurement being taken, each parent i s required to complete an ICF 
specific to parent height assess ment.  The ICF will be signed p rior to the assessment, which can be done at any point in the s tudy.  If biological parent is not 
available during the course of the study to take their standing  height, the parent can provide their stated height instead if consent has been given. 
e If subjects had previous genetic testing, subjects must have a lab certification documenting the specific mutation required fo r the 111-206 study, including the 
identification of FGFR3 mutation (G346E, G375C, G380R, or “othe r”).  
f Complete physical exam includes major body systems, including a ssessment of general appearance; C V; dermatologic; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; 
lymphatic; respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]; gastroint estinal (GI); musculoskeletal;  and neurological/psychological and genitourinary. 
g All treatment visits have pre- dose vital sign assessments.  Vit al signs at pre-dose include: body temperature in degrees Celsi us (°C), heart rate, BP, and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697].  Post-dose measurements include heart rate, B P, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697].

vitals collected that day), vi tal signs should be measured and recorded approximately every 15 minutes (± 5 minutes) for the f irst hour and every 30 minutes (± 5 minutes) 
thereafter until the BP returns to baseline (or within the norm al range for this s ubject as defined by [CONTACT_976]) and signs (if prese nt) resolve.  
7. If the decision is made to adjust the dose, vital signs will be  obtained for at least [ADDRESS_377563]-dose, ECGs w ill be performed pre-dose.  
i Growth measures may be collected  in triplicate approximately th e same time each day (± [ADDRESS_377564] mea surement assessment was 
taken at Screening). Measurements may include but are not limit ed to length, standing height (if able to stand unsupported), c rown-to-rump length, head 
circumference, upper and lower arm and leg, and arm span. Measu rements not taken in the midsagittal plane should be taken on t he right side of the body if 
possible and should always be taken on the same side of the bod y throughout the study.  
j Clinical labs (hematology, chemi stry, and urinalysis) are all p re-dose draws samples and can be drawn anytime during the visit  if there is no drug 
administration. 
k PK plasma samples will be collect ed pre-dose and at 5 (± 2 min) , 15 (± 2 min), 30 (± 5 min), 45 (± 5 min), 60 (± 5 min), 90 (±  5 min), and 120 (± 5 min)

(Month 0) are done on the same d ay, vital signs are taken only once. Please refer to eCRF C ompletion Instructions. 
c A complete physical examination will be performed at Screening at the 3-month visit. Complete physical exam inc ludes major bod y systems, including 
assessment of general appearance; CV; dermatologic; head, eyes,  ears, nose, and throa t; lymphatic; respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]; gastrointestin al (GI); musculoskeletal; and 
neurological/psychological  and genitourinary.

At screening, blood pressure sho uld be taken with  subject in a sitting position, after the subject has been resting for at lea st [ADDRESS_377569] throughout the study. The 
method and site of blood pressure  measurement will be recorded and should be utilized consiste ntly throughout the remainder of  the study. 
e Growth parameters (anthropometri c measurements) may include but  are not limited to height, stand ing height, sitt ing height, we ight, upper and lower arm

ratio, upper leg:lower leg length ratio, and arm span:standing height ratio. Refer to  the Anthropometric M easurement Guideline s for specific instructions 
regarding the collection of growth measurements. All age-approp riate physical measurements will be collected at approximately the same time each visit 
(±2 hours) by a trained study staf f member; every effort will b e made to have the meas urements collected b y the same study sta ff member, if possible,

h Bayley-III is waived for subjects  < 1 month old; ITQOL is waive d for subjects < [ADDRESS_377570] ly translate to differences i n total body clearance of 
BMN 111.  The same weight-based dose in the pediatric populatio n of Study 111-202 
(5-12 years old) yielded lower exposure (C max and AUC) than that char acterized in the adult 
population of Study 111-101.  Therefore , the same weight-based dose in the young pediatric 
population in this study may yield e xposure less than the targe t exposure range characterized 
to be safe and effective i n Study 111-202 at the 15-µg/kg dose.  Since this is the first 
experience with BMN 111 in this young pediatric population, it is also possible the exposure 
at 15 μg/kg could be greater than t he target exposure range, an d dose adjustment may be 
warranted. Thus, an option for adjus tment of the weight-based d ose is provided to ensure that 
the appropriate target exposure for safety and efficacy is reac hed for the young subjects in 
this study.   
The need for dose adjustment will be evaluated as follows: thre e sentinel subjects in Cohort 1 
will receive an initial dose of  15 µg/kg. After all three senti nel subjects reach Day 8, the 
Sponsor will review and evaluate  all available safety and PK da ta (at minimum). If the 
criteria for dose adjustment a re met, the three sentinel subjec ts will be started on the new 
adjusted dose at their next sche duled visit, and vital signs wi ll be obtained for at least [ADDRESS_377571] cohort for potential dose  adjustment. 
Criteria for Dose Adjustment 
The criteria for dose adjustme nt are based on obtaining equival ent exposure characterized to 
be safe and effective wit h the 15-μg/kg dose in Study 111-202 i n each of the age cohorts 
evaluated in this study. BMN 111 dos e may be adjusted if the me an observed AUC 0-120 from 
sentinel subjects is less than the 25th percentile for AUC 0-120 in Cohort 3 (15 μg/kg) of Study 
111-[ADDRESS_377572] body weight will 
be determined using a population PK modelling approach and avai lable data from this study 
 Study 111-206 Page 52 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 6 December 2017 
and Studies 111-202 and 111-101. The  recommended adjusted dose will be determined using 
the following expression: 
  
where WT ref and Dose ref are the typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] (i.e., median)  subject body weight and total d ose, 
respectively, at the 15 μg/kg dos e level in Cohort 3 of Study 1 11-202, and WT ch is the 
anticipated median weight in the  age cohort being studied. As s uch, the recommended 
adjusted dose will target the median AUC 0-120 observed at the 15 μg/kg dose level of Study 
111-202. The recommended adjusted dose, Dose ch, will be normalized by [CONTACT_308475], to provide 
the recommended adjusted weight-b ased dose. The following rules  will be used for dose 
adjustment: 
 A maximum of a 2-fold increase in dose/kg will be permitted bet ween dose 
adjustments regardless of exposure. 
 The total dose will not exceed the  highest total dose administe red in Study 111-202.

9.2 Discussion of Study Design, Inc luding Choice of Control Group 
Study 111-206 is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-co ntrolled clini cal trial of 
BMN 111 in infants and younger children with a diagnosis of ACH  who are age 0 to 
 Study 111-206 Page 54 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 6 December 2017 
< [ADDRESS_377574].  
Additionally, this design provides a framework for interpretati on of any endpoints with a 
subjective component, e.g. HRQOL  and ADL questionnaires and any  subjective assessment 
of safety. 
9.3 Selection of Study Population 
Subjects age 0 months to  < [ADDRESS_377575] meet all  of the following criteria: 
1. Diagnosis of ACH, confirmed by [CONTACT_308479].  If subjects ha d previous genetic 
testing, subjects must have a lab r eport from a certified labor atory with the study 
specific mutation documented. 
2. Age 0 to  < 60 months, at study entry (Day 1) 
3. Cohort [ADDRESS_377576] one 
documented measurement of height /body length a minimum of 6 mon ths 
(+/- 10 days) prior to the scr eening visit for 111-206.  Cohort  [ADDRESS_377577] a 
minimum of 3 months of observati on prior to treatment.  This ob servational period 
can be obtained either (1) via pr ior enrollment in Study 111-90 1 or (2) via enrollment 
in this Study 111 206 for a minimum  of 3 months of non-treatmen t observation prior 
to commencement of treatment.  
4. Parent(s) or guardian(s) (and the  subjects themselves, if requi red by [CONTACT_308480]) are willing and able to provide written, s igned informed consent 
after the nature of the study ha s been explained and prior to p erformance of any

9.4 Treatments 
9.4.1 Treatments Administered 
BioMarin and/or its designee will provide the study site with a  supply of IP sufficient for the 
completion of the study. 
Subjects will be randomized to BMN 111  at a daily dose of 15 µg/kg or placebo for the 
duration of the study. The normal dos ing schedule is a single d aily subcutaneous injection 
given 7 days a week.  If a recent acute illness associated with volume depletion (e.g ., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) 
has not completely resolved prio r to the first dose of BMN 111 or placebo, the dosing will be 
delayed until hydration status ha s improved (up to the maximum period allowed for the visit 
window). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Drug Administration 
During the study, BMN 111 or placebo w ill be administered as a single 15 µg/kg SC 
injection given daily at approximately the same time each day w henever possible.  The same 
injection site should not be use d 2 days in a row, and should be rotated between the 
4 injection sites (upper thigh, uppe r back of arm, abdomen or buttocks). Doses may be 
administered in any of the comm on SC areas (upper arm, thigh, a bdomen, buttocks). 
Following administration of each dose, subjects will be observe d for at least 2 hours after the 
injection for Days 1 to 3, and 30 minutes for all other days of  dose administra tion (longer if 
clinically indicated ) either in the clin ic by [CONTACT_3462], by a home health nurse, or by a 
parent/caregiver. Instructions  for home administration of BMN 1 11 or placebo for subjects

Guide and Injection media. 
9.4.2 Identity of BMN 111 
BMN 111  is cloned into the pJexpress401 v ector, expressed in E. coli an d then purified. 
The drug substance is a modified C NP peptide that retains wild- type activity and specificity. 
The modified CNP sequence is: 
PGQEHPNARKYKGANKKGLSK GCFGLKLDRIGSMSGLGC 
The amino acid sequence is an analogue of the naturally occurri ng tissue-expressed form of 
C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP-53). BMN 111  is a recombinant 39 amino acid peptide that 
includes the 37 C-terminal ami no acids of the human CNP-53 sequ ence, and is engineered to 
include two additional amino acids  (Pro-Gly) on the N-terminus,  which renders the peptide 
more resistant to degradation. It  is a cyclic peptide formed by  [CONTACT_308482]. The molecular weight of the  purified product is 4.1 kDa. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Product Characteristics and Labeling 
The clinical drug product will be supplied in sterile, single-d ose, Type I glass vials with 
coated stopper a nd flip-off aluminum  cap. BMN [ADDRESS_377590] is supplied as a 0.8-mg or 
2-mg lyophilized, preservative-fr ee, white-to-yellow powder for  reconstitution with either a 
sterile diluent or sterile water  for injection. The reconstitut ed solution is colorless to yellow 
and contains 0.8 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL  of BMN 111, as well as citric  acid, sodium citrate, 
trehalose, mannitol, methionine , polysorbate 80, and sterile wa ter for injection. The target pH 
of the reconstituted solution is  5.5. Sterile water for injecti on will be commercially sourced 
and sterile diluent solution cont aining all of the above excipi [INVESTIGATOR_308378]. All reconstitution and dose preparation steps w ill be performed as indicated in 
the BMN [ADDRESS_377591] including commercially sour ced sterile WFI except the d rug substance.

or higher AE that is considere d possibly or probably drug-relat ed, and/or a hypersensitivity 
reaction during the study.   
9.4.5 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
Subjects will be randomized in a  1:1 ratio, i.e., injection wit h placebo:15 µg/kg of BMN 111, 
using IXRS.  An independent third party vendor will develop the  randomization schedule so 
that BioMarin and site personnel ar e blinded to treatment assig nments. 
9.4.6 Selection of Dose and Dosing Schedule Used in the Study 
Study 111-202, the second clinical t rial in humans and the firs t in children with ACH, is an 
ongoing Phase 2, open-label, sequent ial-cohort, dose -escalation  study that assesses daily SC 
BMN 111 in pediatric subjects w ith ACH aged 5-14 years with dos es ranging from 2.5 µg/kg 
to 30 µg/kg.  
Analysis of safety data from the  6-month initial phase of Study  111-202 showed that 
treatment with BMN 111 for 6 months at the doses of 2.5, 7.5, 1 5, and 30 µg/kg was 
generally well tolerated. The m ost common AEs across all cohort s were injection site 
reactions, asymptomatic hypoten sion, headache, and nasopharyngi tis. Based on previous 
experience of the ongoing Phase 2 c linical trial, including the  24-month data cut at 15 µg/kg, 
injection site reacti ons have been identified as risks associat ed with BMN 111 injections. For 
a detailed summary of risks, please refer to the current versio n of the Investigator’s Brochure 
supplied by [CONTACT_189447].  
Analysis of efficacy data from th e 6-month initial phase of Stu dy 111-202 showed that 
subjects treated with BMN 111 for 6 months at doses ranging fro m 2.5 to 15 µg/kg daily had 
a dose-dependent improvement i n AGV, with ~50% improvement in A GV seen at the 
15 µg/kg dose. The data from Cohor t 4 (30 µg/kg) show an appare nt greater than dose-
proportional increase in BMN 111 plasma exposure (C max and AUC 0-t), with a marginal 
improvement in both absolute AGV and change from baseline AGV a fter 6 months of 
BMN 111 treatment when compared with Cohort 3 (15 µg/kg).    
Efficacy/toxicity studies have been conducted in neonatal and v ery young animals (7-day 
postpartum mouse and rat) i n both a disease (TD mouse) and non- disease (rat) model.

Given that this is the firs t study in infants and young childre n, an age-based cohort study 
design is used to assess saf ety and PK in young children (Cohor t 1, ≥ 24 to < 60 months) 
prior to dosing toddlers (Cohort  2, ≥ 6 to < 24 months) and inf ants (Cohort 3, 
0 to  <  6 months). PK will be monitored and evaluated; Day [ADDRESS_377595] of 
the cohort to target the observ ed exposure of the 15-µg/kg dose  group in Study 111-202. 
Safety, efficacy and PK data from Study 111-202, a Phase 2 stud y in children with ACH, 
where a dose of 15 µg/kg has bee n and continues to be studied, are expected to be the most 
relevant, and translatabl e to this study (111-206).   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Selection of Timing of Dose for Each Subject 
9.4.[ADDRESS_377596]-party vendor will develop the randomizatio n schedule so that BioMarin 
and site personnel will not know t reatment assignments. BMN 111  or placebo will be labeled 
with the study number and a unique  identification number. Subje cts and the participating site 
members will be blinded to the t wo study treatments (15 µg/kg B MN 111 or placebo).  
The investigator and other membe rs of staff involved with the s tudy will remain blinded to 
the treatment randomization code  during the assembly procedure.  In the event of an 
emergency medical situation where subject management would be d etermined or 
significantly altered by k nowing the treatment assignment, the investigator may be unblinded 
without prior written approval fr om the Medical Monitor.  Follo wing such an emergency 
unblinding, the investigator will contact [CONTACT_7195] a nd provide written rationale 
according to the unscheduled unblinding procedure set forth in the Study Manual.  
The Medical Monitor will review the rationale, ev aluate whether  there are any additional 
safety considerations that need  to be implemented for the subje ct and/or the study, and 
determine whether the investigat or requires further guidance on  unblinding.  The Medical 
Monitor may also communicate with  the investigator advice on th e care of the subject and 
define the plan for the subject ’s future participation in the s tudy.

To identify and study genetic var iants that may modify achondro plasia, a whole blood 
sample will be collected.  Exploratory genomics will include, b ut are not limited to NPR-B, 
BRAF, and other genes associat ed with CNP signaling.  Explorato ry genomic analysis of 
plasma DNA may inform understa nding of the BMN [ADDRESS_377607] and his/her legally aut horized representative (pare nt or legal guardian).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Sleep Study 
Given that sleep apnea is a f inding in children with ACH ( Waters, 1993 ) and has implications 
on functional and health outcomes , a sleep study will be perfor med in a limited number of 
qualified sleep centers.  A sl eep-testing device will be used t o assess the presence and 
severity of sleep-disordered br eathing by [CONTACT_308488], pulse 
rate, and airflow during overnig ht monitoring. Assessment of ep isodes of sleep apnea will 
include, but may not be limited to, the number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_4101] a pnea and hypopnea per hour 
(Apnea/Hypopnea Index).

[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Outcome Assessments 
Clinical outcome assessments will be administered to assess the  health-related quality of life 
of study subjects. ADL questionn aires will be performed in stud y subjects to assess 
functional performance. Clinical outcome assessments will be pe rformed at the time points 
indicated in the Schedules of Events (Table 9.1.1  and Table 9.1.2). The age ranges for 
clinical outcome a ssessment tools are shown in Figure [IP_ADDRESS]. 1.

In addition to its use for subj ects ranging from 1 to 42 months  old, the Bayley-III assessment 
will be administered to thos e between 42 and 60 months old (Fig ure [IP_ADDRESS].1), as this 
assessment can capture ongoing deve lopmental issues associated with Achondroplasia.  
Bayley-III is waived for  subjects < 1 month old. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Activity of Daily Living and Func tional Independence Measure (W ee-FIM) 
The Wee-FIM instrument is an ADL assessment tool that measures functional performance 
across three domains (self-care, mobility and cognition) ( Ireland, 2011; Ireland, 2012 ). 
The Wee-FIM instrument has been  used in previous research in ch ildren with ACH, and has 
identified ongoing limitations in f unctional performance across  these domains extending 
beyond the age of 7 years (Ireland, 2011). Because the WeeFIM c onsiders the child’s 
performance from a caregiver ’s perspective (Ireland, 2012), thi s tool in turn gives an 
indication of “burden of care” for families and caregivers of c hildren with ACH.  WeeFim is 
waived for children < 6 months old.

The ITQOL is an observer-reporte d outcome tool developed for us e in children from 
2 months to 5 years old that att empts to capture physical, ment al and social well-being. 
The ITQOL adopts the World Healt h Organization’s definition of health as a state of 
complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely  the absence of disease. 
The ITQOL also assesses the qua lity of the parent/guardians lif e.  The 97-item full-length

pre-dose.  If clinically significant abnormalities are noted, t he investigator or designee is 
required to assess whether it is ap propriate for the subject to  continue in the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hip Clinical Assessment 
The hip clinical assessment s hould be completed by [CONTACT_308491][INVESTIGATOR_253730] a physician (MD) i. e., the investigator or the sub -investigator at the time points 
indicated in the Schedule of E vents (Table 9.1.1 and Table 9.1. 2). Medical history will be 
obtained to evaluate for hip, t high, or knee pain, or change in  gait. The physical exam 
(including observation of gait wh en possible) identifies and ev aluates any changes in hip 
function or pain with assessment  of active and passive range of  motion. Changes from 
baseline may trigger further e valuation based on the investigat or’s clinical assessment, which 
may include hip imaging and/or or thopedic consultation. If find ings on clinical hip exam are 
determined to be clinically si gnificant by [CONTACT_308492]’s 
Medical Monitor and orthopedic sp ecialist (if needed), the DMC will be notified of AEs 
resulting from clinically signi ficant abnormal hip monitoring a ssessments. DMC may

[IP_ADDRESS]  HPA Axis Assessments 
To address potential effects  of BMN 111 on activation of the hy pothalamic pi[INVESTIGATOR_80560] 
(HPA) axis, assessment of saliv ary cortisol and serum Prolactin  levels will be analyzed at the 
time points indicated in the Sch edule of Events (Table 9.1.1). Both tests will be done at 
Baseline, Week 26, and Week 52.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Ad Hoc Safety Assessments 
Samples for total IgE and drug-specific IgE testing will be dra wn on Day 1 and in the event 
of a significant hypersensitivity AE, or at the discretion of t he investigator and/or BioMarin. 
A significant hypersensitivity AE is defined as an event that i s grade 3 or higher, requires 
temporary or permanent cessation of BMN 111, or is determined t o be significant at the 
discretion of investigator and/or  BioMarin (exc luding reactions  that are solely a localized 
injection site reaction). If a hypersensitivity AE occurs, an u nscheduled safety visit should 
occur no later than 48 hours of the  start of the reaction, incl uding inspection of the injection 
site and clinical laboratory tests.  
Blood (serum) samples should be c ollected and tested in one or more of the following 
assessments: 
  Drug-specific IgE 
 Total IgE 
 Study 111-206 Page 79 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 6 December 2017 
 Serum tryptase 
If feasible, a sample for drug- specific IgE should be drawn no sooner than 8 hours after the 
event start time or before the ne xt dose. A sample for total Ig E and serum tryptase should 
also be drawn within 1 hour of the  start of the event when poss ible or during the unscheduled 
safety visit.  
A localized injection site reac tion is defined as skin signs or  signs restricted to one affected 
primary location, i.e., hives, wh eals, or swelling or an area o f erythema, redness, induration, 
pain, or itching at or near the s ite of injection. Management o f such localized reactions 
should be determined by [CONTACT_093]’s clinical judgment in  consultation with the 
Sponsor’s Medical Monitor (if warranted). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Unscheduled Safety Visits 
Unforeseen circumstances may a rise in which an unscheduled visi t may be needed. In such a

measurement of protocol-specifi ed vital signs; and other protoc ol-defined events of special 
interest that are deemed critic al to the safety evaluation of t he study drug. 
10.1.1  Adverse Events 
For this protocol, a reportabl e adverse event (AE) is any untow ard medical occurrence 
(e.g., sign, symptom, illness, diseas e or injury) in a subject administered the study drug or 
other protocol-imposed interve ntion, regardless of attribution.  This includes the following: 
 AEs not previously observed in th e subject that emerge during t he course of the 
study. 
 Pre-existing medical conditions j udged by [CONTACT_30386] h ave worsened in 
severity or frequency or change d in character during the study.  
 Complications that occur as a  result of non-drug protocol-impos ed interventions 
(eg, AEs related to screening pr ocedures, medication washout, o r no-treatment 
run-in). 
An adverse drug reaction is any A E for which there is a reasona ble possibility that the 
study-drug caused the AE. “Reas onable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the study-drug and the AE. 
Whenever possible, it is prefera ble to record a diagnosis as th e AE term rather than a series 
of terms relating to a diagnosis. 
10.1.2  Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event (SAE) i s any untoward medical occurrenc e that at any dose meets 
1 or more of the following criteria: 
 Is fatal 
 Is life threatening  
Note: Life-threatening refers to an event that places the subject at  immediate risk of 
death. This definition does not  include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death. 
 Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n for less than 24 hours 
will not be considered to be an SAE.

 Results in persistent or signifi cant disability or incapacity 
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth de fect in the child or fetus o f a subject exposed to IP 
prior to conception or during pregnancy 
 Is an important medical event or reaction – that, based on medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject or requi re intervention to prevent one o f the above 
consequences (e.g. anaphylaxis) 
All adverse events that do not m eet any of the criteria for SAE s should be regarded as 
non-serious AEs.

For subjects enrolled in Cohort 1 (  ≥  24 to <  60 months old) and Cohort 2 (  ≥ 6 to   < 24 months 
old), the study AE reporting period i s as follows: after inform ed consent but prior to initiation 
of study treatment, only SAEs asso ciated with any protocol-impo sed interventions will be 
reported.  After informed consent is obtained and the first adm inistration of study drug, all 
non-serious AEs and SAEs reporti ng period begins and continues until [ADDRESS_377630] administrati on of study drug or the early termi nation visit, whichever is longer 
(refer to Section 12.1.11 ). The criteria for determini ng, and the reporti ng of, SAEs is

 Study 111-[ADDRESS_377632] will assess AEs 
for severity, relationship t o study drug, and seriousness (refe r to Section 10.1.2 for SAE 
definitions).  These assessments should be made by a study clin ician with the training and 
authority to make a diagnosis (e .g., MD/DO, physician’s assista nt, nurse practitioner, or 
DDS). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Seriousness 
The investigator will assess if  an AE should be classified as “ serious” based on the 
seriousness criteria enumerated in Section 10.1.2 .  Seriousness serves as a guide for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Severity 
Severity (as in mild, moderate, or  severe headache) is not equi valent to seriousness, which is 
based on subject/event outcome or  action criteria usually assoc iated with events that pose a 
threat to a subject’s life or  functioning.  The severity of eac h will be assessed using the 
defined categories in  Table [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_377633] a corresponding CTCAE 
term will be assessed according to the general guidelines for g rading used in the CTCAE v4

The investigator’s assessment of  causality for individual AE re ports is part of the study 
documentation process.  Regardless of the Investigator’s assess ment of causality for 
individual AE reports, the Sponsor will promptly evaluate all r eported SAEs against 
cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously com municate possible new 
safety findings to investigators and applicable r egulatory auth orities. 
 Study 111-[ADDRESS_377634] only one diagnosis, sign, or symptom per event field on the AE eCRF (e.g., nausea 
and vomiting should not be recorded in the same entry, but as 2  separate entries). 
In order to classify AEs and diseases, preferred terms will be assigned by [CONTACT_308495] e CRF, using MedDRA (Medical Dicti onary for Regulatory 
Activities) terminology. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms 
Using accepted medical terminology, enter the diagnosis (if kno wn).  If not known, enter 
sign(s) and/or symptom(s).  If a  diagnosis subsequently becomes  available, then this 
diagnosis should be entered on the  AE form, replacing the origi nal entries where appropriate. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events 
In general, AEs occurring seconda ry to other even ts (e.g., casc ade events) should be 
identified by [CONTACT_5252] .  For example, if severe diar rhea is known to have resulted 
in dehydration, it is sufficien t to record only diarrhea as an AE or SAE on the eCRF.  
However, medically important eve nts that may be linked and/or s eparated in time should be 
recorded as independent events  on the eCRF.  For example, if se vere hemorrhage leads to 
renal failure, both events shoul d be recorded separately on the  eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events 
A persistent AE is one that ex tends continuously, without resol ution, between subject 
evaluation time points.  Such a n event should be recorded only once on the eCRF unless its 
severity increases or decreases  (in which case it should be rec orded again on the AE eCRF). 
A recurrent AE is one that occurs  and resolves between subject evaluation time points, but 
then subsequently recurs.  All r ecurrences of the AE should be recorded on the AE eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hypotension 
If an asymptomatic drop in blood pressure meets the protocol de finition of AE per clinical 
judgment of the reporter, repor t the event as “blood pressure d ecreased.”  If the drop in blood 
pressure is associated with signs  or symptoms, complete the sym ptomatic hypotension eCRF 
and use the following guidance to report the corresponding AE e CRF: If a unifying diagnosis 
 Study 111-206 Page 86 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 6 December 2017 
is available to explain the ev ent of hypotension, report the di agnosis as an AE and capture 
signs and symptoms on the symptomatic hypotension eCRF page. If  no other unifying 
diagnosis is available, report “ hypotension” as th e event and c apture signs and symptoms on 
the symptomatic hypotension eCRF page.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Injection Site Reactions 
If an injection site r eaction is associate d with a single sign or symptom, report the event on 
AE eCRF page (e.g., redness at inj ection site, AE is injection site redness). If the injection 
site reaction is associated with multiple signs or symptoms, re port injection site reaction as 
the adverse event on the AE pa ge, and individual  signs and symp toms will be reported on the 
ISR eCRF page (e.g., if the subj ect experiences redness and ind uration, report “Injection site 
reaction” on the AE page, and in t he corresponding Injection eC RF page, report erythema 
and induration).  If the injecti on site reaction a ppears after 24 hours, add “delayed” to the 
term used to describe the event. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Abnormal Laboratory Values 
Laboratory test results will be recorded on the laboratory resu lts pages of the eCRF, or 
appear on electronically produced l aboratory reports submitted directly from the central 
laboratory, if applicable. 
Any laboratory result abnormality f ulfilling the criteria for a  SAE should be reported as such, 
in addition to being recorded a s an AE in the eCRF. 
A clinical laboratory abnorma lity should be documented as AE if  it is not otherwise refuted 
by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality and any one or more of the following conditions 
is met: 
 Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659] 
 Leading to a change in study me dication (e.g. dose modification , interruption or 
permanent discontinuation)  
 Requiring a change in concomitant therapy (e.g. addition of, in terruption of, 
discontinuation of, or any other ch ange in a concomitant medica tion, therapy or 
treatment). 
 The abnormality suggests a dise ase and/or organ toxicity 
 The abnormality is of a degree th at requires active management (e.g., change of dose, 
discontinuation of study drug, mor e frequent follow-up assessme nts, further 
diagnostic investigation, etc.) 
 Study 111-[ADDRESS_377635] dose of study medication t hat falls outside the laboratory 
reference range and meets the clin ical significance criteria. 
This does not apply to any abnormal laboratory result th at falls outside the laborator y 
reference range but that does not  meet the clinical significanc e criteria (these will be 
analyzed and reported as laboratory abnormalities), those that are considered AEs of the type 
explicitly exempted by [CONTACT_60797], or those which are a resul t of an AE that has already 
been reported.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pre-existing Conditions 
A pre-existing condition is one t hat is present at the start of  the study.  Such conditions 
should be recorded as medical hi story on the appropriate eCRF. 
A pre-existing condition should be  recorded as an AE or SAE dur ing the study only if the 
frequency, intensity, or charact er of the condition worsens dur ing the study period.  It is 
important to convey the concept that a pre-existing condition h as changed by [CONTACT_308496] (e .g., more frequent  headaches). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  General Physical Examination Findings 
At screening, any clin ically significant abnormality should be recorded as a  pre-existing 
condition (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).  During the study, any new  clinically significant 
findings and/or abnormalities discovered on physical examinatio n that meet the definition of 
an AE (or an SAE) must be recorded and document as an AE or SAE  on the AE eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged H ospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or Surgery 
Any AE that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_308383] (refer to 
Section 10.1.2 ). 
There are some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] s cenarios that do not require re porting as an SAE when there 
is no occurrence of an AE.  These s cenarios include planned hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_308384]: 
 Perform a protocol-mandated efficacy measurement 
 Undergo a diagnostic or elective surgical procedure for a pre-e xisting medical 
condition that has not changed 
 Receive scheduled therapy (study drug or otherwise) for the stu dy indication

Proprietary and Confidential 6 December 2017 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Deaths 
All deaths that occur during the  AE reporting period (refer to Section 10.2.1 ), regardless of 
attribution, will be recorded on t he AE eCRF and expeditiously reported to the Sponsor as an 
SAE. 
When recording a death, the eve nt or condition that caused or c ontributed to the fatal 
outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the  eCRF.  If the cause of death 
is unknown and cannot be ascertaine d at the time of reporting, record “Unexplained Death” 
or “Death of Unknown Cause” on the  eCRF.  If the death is attri buted to progression of the 
disease or condition being studies, record “-” as the SAE term on the eCRF. 
10.4 Reporting Requirements 
The Sponsor is responsible for identifying, preparing, and repo rting all suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs ) to the relevant competent au thorities, ethics committees, 
and investigators in accordance with requirements identified in  the Clinical Trials 
Regulations.  
10.4.1  Expedited Reporting Requirements 
All SAEs and EOSI, if applicable  that occur during the course o f the AE Reporting Period 
(refer to Section 10.2.1), whether or  not considered related to  study drug, must be reported by 
[CONTACT_308497] w ithin [ADDRESS_377636] information that fully  documents the event before 
notifying BPV of an SAE.  BioMarin may be required to report ce rtain SAEs to regulatory 
authorities within 7 calendar da ys of being notified about the event; therefore, it is important 
that Investigators submit any i nformation requested by [CONTACT_308498]. 
If the electronic data capture ( EDC) is unavailable, all SAEs s hould be reported to BPV by 
[CONTACT_308499] 
[ADDRESS_377637] administration of study drug or study 
discontinuation/terminati on, whichever is longer.  
 Study 111-[ADDRESS_377638] be obtained by [CONTACT_308500]. 
10.5 Follow-up of Subjects after Adverse Events 
The Investigator should follow all unresolved AEs/SAEs until th e events are resolved or have 
stabilized, the subject is los t to follow-up, or it has been de termined that the study treatment 
or participation is not the cause  of the AE/SAE.  Resolution of  AEs and SAEs (with dates) 
should be documented on the AE e CRF and in the subject’s medica l record to facilitate 
source data verification. 
For some SAEs, the Sponsor may follow up by [CONTACT_756], fax, ele ctronic mail, and/or a 
monitoring visit to obtain addi tional case details (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l discharge summary, consultant 
report, or autopsy report) deem ed necessary to appropriately ev aluate the SAE report. 
10.[ADDRESS_377639] to report, to the 
Investigator and/or to BPV dir ectly, any subsequent SAEs that t he subject’s personal 
physician(s) believes might be r elated to prior study treatment . 
The Investigator should no tify the study Sponsor of any death o r SAE occurring at any time 
after a subject has discontinue d or terminated study participat ion, if the Investigator believes 
that the death or SAE may have be en related to prior study trea tment. The Sponsor should 
also be notified if the Investig ator should become aware of the  development of cancer or of a 
congenital anomaly in a subseque ntly conceived offspring of a s ubject who participated in 
this study.  
10.[ADDRESS_377640] the safety of s ubjects, and that the appropriat e regulatory bodies should be 
notified according to their resp ective regulations. According t o the European Union (EU) 
Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/ EC, “…in the light of the circ umstances, notably the 
occurrence of any new event rela ting to the conduct of the tria l or the development of the 
investigational medicinal produc t where that new event is likel y to affect the safety of the 
subjects, the sponsor and the I nvestigator sha ll take appropria te urgent safety measures to 
 Study 111-[ADDRESS_377641]. The sponsor shall forthwith inform the 
competent authorities of those ne w events and the measures take n and shall ensure that the 
IRB/EC/REB is notified at the same time.”  
The Sponsor is responsible fo r identifying, preparing and repor ting all S[LOCATION_003]Rs to the 
relevant competent authorities , ethics committees and investiga tors in accordance with the 
requirements identified in the  Clinical Trials Regulations. 
The reporting period for these eve nts which may require the imp lementation of urgent safety 
measures is the period from the time of signing of the ICF thro ugh the completion of the last 
study visit or at the Early Termi nation Visit (ETV). Investigat ors are required to report any 
events which may require the i mplementation of urgent safety me asures to BioMarin within 
24 hours. 
Examples of situations that may r equire urgent safety measures include discovery of the 
following: 
 Immediate need to revise the IP  administration (eg, modified do se amount or frequency 
not defined in protocol) 
 Lack of study scientific value , or detrimental study conduct or  management 
 Discovery that the quality or saf ety of the IP does not meet es tablished safety 
requirements

14 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE  
14.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans 
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide additional det ails on the planned statistical 
analysis. Unless otherwise stat ed, all analyses will be perform ed using SAS v. 9.4.  
14.1.1  Interim Analyses 
An interim analysis will be carried out to support NDA/MAA fili ng. The report will be 
provided by a third party to assu re that the study team, subjec ts, and investigators have no 
access to the individual subj ect treatment allocation. 
14.1.[ADDRESS_377647] A. The incidence of AEs will b e summarized by [CONTACT_29974], preferred term, rel ationship to stu dy treatment (a s assessed by [CONTACT_1697]), and 
severity. All AEs, including SAE s and AEs that lead to permanen t discontinuation from the 
study and from the study treatment, will be listed. Hypersensit ivity reactions and 
 Study 111-[ADDRESS_377648], descriptive statistics will be provided on bas eline as well as all subsequent 
visits. 
All other safety measures inclu ding laboratory tests, vital sig ns, ECG, echocardiogram, hip 
clinical assessment, and concomitant  medication data will also be summarized descriptively. 
Data summaries will be present ed by [CONTACT_1570] (when appli cable) for each cohort and 
overall. All safety results will be listed. 
14.3 Efficacy Analysis 
Efficacy analysis will be per formed on the efficacy population as defined in Section 14.7.1 . 
Efficacy endpoints include length/ height AGV and length/height standard score (Z-score) at 
Week 52.  
For a given interval [Date1, Dat e2], the AGV is defined as foll ows: 
AGV ൌ	Length/standing	height	at	Day	2െ	Length/standing	height	at	Day	 1
Interval	Length	ሺDaysሻ	ൈ365.25  
 
where the interval length in da ys is calculated as Date2 – Date 1. AGV will be calculated for 
the following visits/intervals: 
 Baseline: [Date of last length/he ight measurement in study [ADDRESS_377649] 6 months prior 
to screening visit in s tudy 206, Date of Day 1] 
 Week 13: [Date of Da y 1, Date of Week 13] 
 Week 26: [Date of Da y 1, Date of Week 26] 
 Week 39: [Date of Da y 1, Date of Week 39] 
 Week 52 (12-month): [Date  of Day 1, Date of Week 52] 
The baseline of the AGV is esta blished in the natural history s tudy of Study111-901, based 
on the standing height measurements  in the last 6 months prior to enrollment to Study 
111-206. AGV will be summarized using descriptive statistics (m ean, SD, median, minimum, 
and maximum). Results will be summarized by [CONTACT_308503]. 
 Study 111-206 Page 105 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 6 December 2017 
The measurement of length/sta nding height will be converted to age-and sex-appropriate 
standard score (SDS), also refe rred to as Z-score, by [CONTACT_308504] n with normal reference 
standards (not ACH). The Z-sco re will be summarized similarly t o growth velocity. 
Comparisons between treatment  groups by [CONTACT_308505]. Statistical c omparisons will be considered d escriptive. Additional details 
regarding efficacy analysis wi ll be provided in the SAP.  
14.4 Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Subjects randomized to receive BMN 111  or placebo will undergo pharmacokinetic testing. 
For subjects randomized to BMN 111, PK parameters generated ove r the course of the study 
will be evaluated and summarize d with descriptive statistical m easures (mean, standard 
deviation, CV%, min, median and max ). Correlative analyses of s ome of the PK parameters 
with efficacy, safety and immunoge nicity measures may be conduc ted. 
14.5 Immunogenicity Analysis 
Immunogenicity will be summarized  as change from baseline as we ll as by [CONTACT_308506] 111 or placebo.  Results will be summarized as 
incidence and titer for all cohorts. Additionally, immunogenici ty may be assessed for 
correlations with measures of safety, PK, and efficacy. 
14.6 Determination of Sample Size 
Approximately 70 subjects age 0 to  < [ADDRESS_377650] level and/or on a cohort le vel per the pre-specified st oppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]. Based on criteria 
outlined in the protocol, the DMC may also make endorsements fo r dose adjustments if 
needed.

not pay for any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], t ests, or treatments for medi cal problems of any sort related 
solely to the study subject’s dis ease. Costs associated with su ch hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], tests, and 
treatments should be billed and col lected in the way that such costs are usually billed and 
collected outside the study. 
The Investigator should contac t BioMarin immediately upon notif ication that a study subject 
has been injured by [CONTACT_308507] a s part of the study. 
Any subject who experiences a st udy-related injury should be in structed by [CONTACT_308508] a pre-specified medical institution if po ssible, or at 
the closest medical treatment facility if necessary. The subjec t should be given the name [CONTACT_4007] a 
person to contact [CONTACT_308509], and assist ance with, treatment for 
study-related injuries. The tre ating physician should bill the subject’s health insurance 
company or other third party paye r for the cost of this medical  treatment. If the cost of the 
medical treatment is not covere d by [CONTACT_308510], then either BioMa rin or the institution may pay fo r reasonable and necessary 
medical services to treat the  injuries caused by [CONTACT_308511]. In some 
jurisdictions, BioMa rin is obligated by [CONTACT_44533]-re lated injuries without prior 
recourse to third party payer billi ng and/or regardless of faul t. If this is the case, BioMarin 
will comply with the law.

response. In compliance with 21 CFR Part 11, the system will re quire the personnel making 
the correction to enter a reas on for changing the value. The do cumented audit trail will 
include the reason for the change , the original value, the new value, the time of the correction 
and the identity of the operator. 
BioMarin’s policy is that st udy data on the eCRFs must be verif iable to the source data, 
which necessitates access to all or iginal recordings, laborator y reports, and subject records. 
In addition, all source data shoul d be attributable (signed and  dated). The Investigator must 
therefore agree to allow direct  access to all source data. Subj ects (or their legally authorized 
representative) must also allow access to their medical records , and subjects will be informed 
of this and will confirm their agreement when giving informed c onsent. If direct source 
document verification of study data  by [CONTACT_308512], then the Investigator must make available facilities  and/or personnel to allow 
GCP-compliant source verificati on to occur. Examples of such me thods include certified 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_308386] i nformation redacted, or other 
GCP-compliant means agreed betwee n the Investigator and the Spo nsor. 
A CRA designated by [CONTACT_308513] 
“Source Data Verified” (SDV). I f an error is di scovered at any time or a clarification is 
needed, the CRA, or designee, wil l create an electronic query o n the associated field. Site

Study Design: Phase [ADDRESS_377665] 
Participation: 60 weeks for Cohorts 1 and 2 (screening, treatment, follow -up). 
Subjects in Cohort 3  who enter the study for a 12 -week 
observational period will participate for approximately 70 weeks 
(screening, observational period, treatment, follow- up) 
Dose:  15 µg/kg BMN [ADDRESS_377666] to adjustment per 
protocol  
Study Population:  Children 0 to < 60 months old with achondroplasia  
Date of Original Protocol:  06 December  2017  
Date of Amendment 1: [ADDRESS_377667] 2018  
1 RATIONALE AND SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
The protocol has been amended to include the following changes:  
1. The lower age range of participating subjects who have a  ≥  6-month period of  
pretreatment growth assessment in Study 111- 901 immediately before study entry has 
been revised from  ≥  3 months to  ≥  6 months [§9.1].  
Rationale: To harmonize the roll- over of subjects from Study 111- 901 to 111- 206 in each 
cohort.  
2. No two sentinel subjects will be dosed on the same day for any cohort  [§9.1] . 
Rationale: To enforce a minimum period of saf ety observation prior to dosing the next 
subject , as in each cohort, the sentinel subjects will be the youngest children to date 
dosed with BMN 111.  
3. Echocardiogram will be performed at the Week 56 Safety Follow -up and Early 
Termination visits [Table 9.1.1; §12.1.10; §12.1.11].  
Rationale: To enable monitoring for any unintended adverse anatomical or functional 
cardiac adverse effects at the time of stud y completion.  
4. Use of residual plasma samples for cGMP PD biomarker assessment in all age groups has 
been added to procedures  [Table 9.1.1; Table [IP_ADDRESS].1; §12.1.2; §12.1.7; §12.1.8; 
§12.1.9].  
Rationale: Use of the residual sample allows for PD assessments in infants without timed 
urine collection.  The infant group assessments can then be compared to all age groups. 
5. An anti -BMN  111 immunogenicity assessment has been added at Week 3  [Table  9.1.1; 
§12.1.5].  
Rationale: Week [ADDRESS_377668] been added at Week 39 [ Table  9.1.1; §12.1.8]  
Rationale: To obtain PD assessments at each visit that PK is collected and to obtain creatinine concentrations for cGMP calculations  
7. The sleep study scheduled at the Week 26 visit has been removed [Table 9.1.1; §12.1.7].  
Rationale:  To minimi ze study burden on the trial participants, families and caregivers , as 
only two polysomnography studies are required to meet the study objectives. One 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377669] 2018  
assessment will be performed at baseline and one at Week 52 (or the Early Termination 
Visit, if the subject leaves the study early).  
8. DXA scans will no longer include tibia s cans [Table 9.1.1; §[IP_ADDRESS]].  
Rationale:  The tibia scan was removed because DXA machines are unable to properly perform the scan.  
9. If the 111- [ADDRESS_377670] enter s Study 111- 206 and the 111 -206 Screening 
visit are on the same day, the procedures common to both visits  will be performed one 
time only [Table 9.1.1 ( footnote b )].  
Rationale: To ensure that duplicate study procedures, includin g blood draws, are not 
repeated unnecessarily in this infant and toddler population.  
10. On days when PK samples are being drawn, ECG will be performed within a 5- minute 
window prior to the 30- minute PK assessment [Table 9.1.1 ( footnote h) ; §[IP_ADDRESS]] . 
Rationa le:  This timing allows for ECG assessment in relation to  BMN 111 C max. 
11. Exclusion cri terion  #6 has been revised from “… as determined by [CONTACT_308516]…) to (… as determined by [CONTACT_308517]…).  T he determination about whether presence of 
cervicomedullary  compression is likely to require surgical intervention will be informed 
by [CONTACT_117145], polysomnography, and MRI  [§9.3.2].  
Rationale :  To clarify that this is a clinical decision to be informed by [CONTACT_23804], symptoms, 
and investigations, and not based solely on abnormal finding in an MRI.  
12. Exclusion criterion  #15 has been revised to include cervicomedullary decompression 
surgery (Cohorts 2 a nd 3 only)  [§9.3.2].  
Rationale:  To clarify that children with prior cervicomedullary decompression surgery 
are not eligible for entry into the study in Cohort [ADDRESS_377671] on the fora men magn um using MRI in children 
at ages where the foramen magnum is still growing rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]. As the synchondroses around the for amen magnum are already closing after the age of two years, subjects with prior 
cervicomedullary decompression surgery may be allowed int o Cohort 1 only after 
discussion and agreement with the Medical Monitor.  
13. Inclusion/exclusion criteria have been added for Cohort 3 subjects enrolling in the 
observational period [§9.3.3; §9.3.4]. 
Rationale:  These criteria are used in our observational stu dy 111- 901 and apply only to 
Cohort 3 subjects who enroll in the 111-206 observation period. 
14. A table of restricted medications, including growth hormone, has been added [§9.3.5].  
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377672] 2018  
Rationale:  T o ensure that growth hormone is not used concomitantly. 
15. In Section [IP_ADDRESS], Genomic Biomarker Analysis, the text  “of plasma DNA” has been 
removed from “ Exploratory genomic analysis of plasma DNA may inform understanding 
of the BMN 111 mechanism of action …” [§[IP_ADDRESS]] .  
Rationale: Genomic analysis implies DNA/RNA analysis, and we are not obtaining DNA 
from plasma.  
16. For subjects enrolled in Cohort 3 (0 to < 6 months old), the collection period for all AEs 
begins after informed consent is obtained [Table 9.1.2 footnote h; §10.2.1] .   
Rationale: to collect and document  all AEs so as to establish robust baseline natural 
history in these subjects prior to study drug administration.  
17. Administrative updates have been made to improve consistency and clarity. 
a. Text has been changed to reflect the age of majority rather than age  18, as the age of 
majority varies  between countries. Section 5.3, Subject Information and Informed 
Consent .  
b. Section 7.3, Ongoing Clinical Studies , has been updated to include a description of 
Study 111- 302 (Section 7.3.5) . 
c. In Section 8, Study Objectives , in the secondary objective addressing evaluation for 
hip, thigh, or knee pain, or change in gait from medical history , the phrase  “…from 
medical history…” has been removed to  clarify  that hip assessments are performed at 
screening, and these measures serv e as a baseline for future assessments.  
d. Error in Section 9.1, Overall Study Design and Plan, description of Cohort [ADDRESS_377673] 17 additional subjects will be randomized.  
e. Clarification about age -appropriate dose adjustment has been added to indicate that 
subjects will be administered the recommended dose appropriate to their current age. Section 9.1, Overall Study Design and Plan, and Section 9.1.1, Dose Adjustments . 
f. The ti me window for the Week 56 safety follow -up visit has been changed from ±  to 
+ [ADDRESS_377674] dose of study drug and the safety follow -up visit.  Table 9.1.1, Section 12.1.10, Week 56 Safety Follow -up.   
g. Clarified that the s creening/baseline hip assessment includes a pelvis x -ray.  
Table  9.1.1, Section 12.1.1, Screening/Baseline Day -30 to Day -1. 
h. Because the definition of ACH -related events differed between sites, capture of 
ACH- related events has been changed to capture all  procedures listed in the Schedule 
of Events to ensure all procedures are collected and analyzed.  Tables 9.1.1 and 9.1.2; Section  [IP_ADDRESS]; Sections  12.1.2- 12.1.11; Sections 12.2.2- 12.2.3. 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377675] 2018  
i. Vital signs instructions now include sitting or supi[INVESTIGATOR_105523] t o account for subjects 
who are too young to sit. The duration of vital signs assessments in Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
and Table [IP_ADDRESS].1 has been extended to align with the assessments presented in the SOE.  Additionally, i f a dose adjustment visit coincides with a visit at which a full PK 
is drawn, vital signs will be obtained for 8 hours, similar to the Day 1,2 schedule.  Table 9.1.1, Vital Sign Assessment Frequency table; Section [IP_ADDRESS], Vital Signs ; 
Table [IP_ADDRESS].1.   
j. In the event that a sentinel subject has an interrupted dose of study drug on Day 1, instructions have been included for a change in the PK collection schedule. Table  9.1.1 footnote L; Section 9.11.5, Pharmacokinetics Variables.  
k. Footnote m i n Table 9.1.1 has been updated to co rrespond to the information in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS], Anti -BMN [ADDRESS_377676] observation following BMN 111 administration at study visits has been revised in Section [IP_ADDRESS], Study Drug Administration, for consistency with Section 9.4.4, Directions for Administration . 
s. Text in Section [IP_ADDRESS], Study Drug Administration now  indicates that study drug 
injections will be administered at age -appropriate sites, determined at the discretion 
of the investigator.  
t. Text has been revised to indicate that in the hour prior to injection, all subjects should be well hydrated and fed .  Secti on 9.4.4, Directions for Administration ; Section 9.6, 
Dietary or Other Protocol Restrictions. 
u. In Section 9.4.5, Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups , a note has been 
added that in Japan, subjects are randomized separately within each cohort.  
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377677] 2018  
v. Section [IP_ADDRESS], Imaging Assessment Procedures, has been corrected by [CONTACT_308518] x -rays, and clarified to state that b ilateral 
lower extremity x -rays, anterior -posterior (AP) view, are done to  assess growth plate 
morphology. Instruction has been added to contact [CONTACT_308519] -radiological methods for assessment  if there are IRBs or IEC s unwilling 
to allow x- rays in Cohort [ADDRESS_377678] s (also, Table 9.1.1, footnote t ). Additionally, the 
list of DXA acquis itions has been clarifie d.   
w. Section [IP_ADDRESS].1, Bayley -III, has been revised to remove reference to the 
Social -Emotional and Adaptive Behavior Scale components because these scales will 
not be used in this study.  Additionally, the durat ion of the assessment has been 
clarified.  
x. In Section [IP_ADDRESS].4, Child Behavior Checklist , the duration of the assessment has 
been clarified.  
y. In Section 10.1.2, the statement that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_164921] 24 hours will not be 
considered an SAE has bee n deleted to make the criterion consistent across all 
BioMarin protocols. Section 10.1.2, Serious Adverse Events.  
z. Error in Table [IP_ADDRESS].1 has been corrected to read “The AE could not  be explained 
by [CONTACT_189578]”

PROTOCOL NUMBER :  111- 206 
STUDY SITES:  Approximately 10-15 sites worldwide 
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:  Phase 2  
STUDY RATIONALE:  
BMN [ADDRESS_377680] degradation by [CONTACT_308446], 
allowing for a longer half -life. 
The pharmacological a ctivity of BMN 111 was explored in two mouse models of ACH, a severe, 
Fgfr3Y367C/+ (TD) model ( Lorget, 2012 ), and a milder [Ach] /+ (Ach) model. These included 
studies in 7 -day old TD mice given  BMN  111 daily by [CONTACT_308520] 20 days and a 
study in 3-week old Ach mice given BMN 111 daily by [CONTACT_275269] 5  weeks. Partial or 
complete reversion of the ACH phenotype was observed in these mouse models after BMN 111 
administration. In wild -type mice, and normal rats and monkeys, BMN 111 adm inistration resulted 
in growth plate expansion and dose -dependent skeletal growth at hemodynamically tolerated dose 
levels ( Wendt,  2015). Additionally, the potential effect of age on BMN [ADDRESS_377681] severe 
complication, cervicomedullary compression (CMC), occurs in a sub set of subjects with ACH due 
to abnormal endochondral bone growth and narrowing of the foramen magnum ( White, 2016 ). CMC 
has been linked to serious respi[INVESTIGATOR_308391], apnea, 
ataxia, developmental delay, and resp iratory arrest associated with sudden death ( Mukherjee, 2014). 
Foramen magnum decompression surgery is currently the only treatment for this condition.   
Sleep apnea has also been extensively described in ACH, and sleep -disordered breathing may affect 
up to 85% of all children with ACH ( Ireland, 2012). This is thought to be due to midface 
hypoplasia, relative adenotonsillar hypertrophy, and potential posterior cranial fossa compression 
secondary to abnormal endochondral bone growth. Sleep apnea in ACH not only results in the need 
for surgical intervention, but has also been linked to sudden death in rare cases ( Pauli, 1984 ).   
Similarly, the dysregulation of endochondral bone growth in ACH leads to other medical 
complications which are prevalent in this subject population, such as the following:

• Spi[INVESTIGATOR_16078], kyphosis, and lordosis (secondary to altered growth plate ossification in the 
vertebrae and narrowing of the interpedicular distances) ( Shirley, 2009 ) 
• Developmental delay of gross motor and ambula tory skills (associated with proximal limb 
shortening, macrocephaly, and hypotonia) ( Ireland, 2010)  
• Delayed functional skills and increased need for caregiver assistance (eg, eating, bladder management, bowel management, transfer to chair, climbing stairs)  (Ireland, 2011)  
Thus, BMN  111 may provide greater benefit when children begin treatment at a younger age, as 
earlier initiation of treatment allows a longer time window to improve growth and potential to improve medical complications of achondroplasia. Th is study (111 -206) is being conducted to 
assess safety and the potential benefit of BMN [ADDRESS_377683] tested in humans in Study 111- 101, a Phase 1 double -blinded, placebo -
controlled clinical trial of the safety and tolerability of BMN 111 in healthy adult male volunteers 
without ACH. Part 1 examined a series of single subcutaneous doses (5 µg/kg, 10 µg/kg and 
15 µg/kg), and Part 2 included 10 days of either fixed dosing or dose escalation (0.5 µg/kg to 
8 µg/kg). BMN 111 was generally well tolerated at all doses.  As expected, mild, transient, self -
limited hypotension was reported (refer to current Investigators Brochure for additional 
information). Following SC administration, BMN  111 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_308392] 30 minutes. BMN 111 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_308393] a mean t
1/2 ranging from 40 to 55 minutes  across dose levels. BMN 111 exposure (C max and 
AUC 0-t) generally increased greater than proportional to the i ncrease in dose across the 2.5 -to-
15-µg/kg dose range. Exposure following multiple dosing was found to be similar to exposure 
following single doses, indicating no apparent accumulation or time -dependence with once -daily SC 
administration.  
Study 111- 202, t he second clinical trial in humans and the first in children with ACH, is an ongoing 
Phase 2, open -label, sequential -cohort, dose -escalation study that assesses daily SC BMN 111 in 
pediatric subjects with ACH aged 5 -14 years with doses ranging from 2.5 µg/kg to 30  µg/kg. The 
primary objective of Study 111 -202 is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BMN 111 
administered for 6  months and up to 24 months; the secondary objectives are to determine change 
from baseline in annualized growth velocity (AGV), growth parameters, body proportions, and evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BMN [ADDRESS_377684]:

Analysis of safety data from the 6 -month initial phase of Study 111 -202 showed that treatment with 
BMN 111 for 6 months at the doses of 2.5, 7.5, 1 5, and 30 µg/kg was generally well tolerated (refer 
to current Investigator ’s Brochure for specific details) . One subject ( 30 µg/kg) in 111-[ADDRESS_377685] common AEs across all cohorts were injection site reactions, asymptomatic hypotension, 
headache, and nasopharyngitis. Based on previous experience of the ongoing Phase 2 c linical trial, 
including the 24-month data cut at 15 µg/kg, injection site reactions have been identified as risks 
associated with  BMN 111 injections. The majority of hypotension events were grade 1 and reported 
in the setting of routine BP measurement. All reported events of hypotension were transient and resolved without medical intervention. For a detailed summary of risks, please refer to the current 
version of the Investigator’s Brochure supplied by [CONTACT_189447].  
Analysis of efficacy data from the 6 -month initial phase of Study 111-202 showed that subjects 
treated with BMN 111 for 6 months at doses ranging from 2.5-15 µg/kg daily ha d a dose -dependent 
improvement in AGV, with ~50% improvement in AGV seen at the 15 µg/kg dose. The data from 
Cohort 4 (30 µg/kg) show an apparent greater than dose -proportional increase in BMN 111 plasma 
exposure (C max and AUC 0-t), with a marginal improvem ent in both absolute AGV and change from 
baseline AGV after 6  months of BMN 111 treatment when compared with Cohort 3 (15 µg/kg).    
Study 111- 206 is a Phase 2 randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of BMN  111 
in infants and younger children with a diagnosis of ACH  who are 0 to <  60 months old. This 52 -
week study will enable assessment of BMN 111 efficacy and safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics 
biomarkers, and PK in this population. Additional exploratory endpoints pertaining to medi cal 
complications of ACH will also be evaluated.   
Efficacy/toxicity studies have been conducted in neonatal and very young animals (7 -day 
postpartum mouse and rat) in both a disease (TD mouse) and non-disease (rat) model. Given that 
this is the first stud y in infants and young children, an age -based cohort study design is used to 
assess safety and PK in young children (Cohort 1, ≥ 24 to < 60 months) prior to dosing toddlers 
(Cohort 2, ≥ 6 to  < 24 months) and infants (Cohort 3, 0 to < 6 months). PK will be monitored and 
evaluated; Day [ADDRESS_377686] of the cohort to target the observed exposure of the 15-µg/kg dose 
group in Study 111-202. Safety, efficacy  and PK data from Study 111-202, a Phase 2 study in 
children with ACH, where a dose of 15 µg/kg has been and continues to be studied,  are expected to 
be the most relevant, and translatable to this study (111 -206).

As subjects age on study, they will be administered the dose determined to be appropriate for their 
current age.  For example, if a subject enr olls into Cohort 2 at age 20 months, they will receive the 
recommended dose for subjects aged ≥ 6 to  < 24 months until they turn 24 months in age.  When 
they turn 24 months in age, they will begin to receive the recommended dose for subjects 
aged  ≥ 24 to  < 60 months.  Duration of the study is 52 weeks of treatment with a safety follow up at 
Week 56. Following completion of the study, subjects in all treatment groups may be eligible to 
receive BMN 111 in an open -label extension study, to assess safety and efficacy of BMN 111 over 
the longer term ; and to study the long-term outcomes on sustained growth, proportionality, bone 
maturation and medical comorbidities .  
For subjects enrolling into the extension study, safety follow up visit at Week 56 will be waive d.

Dose Adjustments  
Analysis of a vailable PK data from studies [ADDRESS_377707] body weight did not directly translate to differences in total body clearance of BMN 111.  
The same weight -based dose in the pediatric population of Study 111-202 (5-12  years old) yielded 
lower exposure (C max and AUC) than that characterized in the adult population of Study 111- 101.  
Therefore, the same weight -based dose in the young pediatric population in this study may yield 
exposure less than the target exposure rang e characterized to be safe and effective in Study  111-202 
at the 15 -µg/kg dose. Since this is the first experience with BMN 111 in this young pediatric 
population, it is also possible the exposure at 15 μg/kg could be greater than the target exposure 
range , and dose adjustment may be warranted. Thus, an option for adjustment of the weight -based 
dose is provided to ensure that the appropriate target exposure for safety and efficacy is reached for 
the young subjects in this study.   
The need for dose adjustme nt will be evaluated as follows: three sentinel subjects in Cohort 1 will 
receive an initial dose of 15 µg/kg. After all three sentinel subjects reach Day 8, a review will occur 
to evaluate all available safety and PK data (at minimum). If the criteria for  dose adjustment are 
met, the three sentinel subjects will be started on the new adjusted dose at their next scheduled visit, 
and vital signs will be obtained for at least [ADDRESS_377708] en rolls into Cohort 2 at age 20 months, they will receive the

Safety and Efficacy Monitoring  
Each treated subject will have expanded outpatient safety monitoring for a minimum of [ADDRESS_377710] -dosing. Because younger children may not be able to 
verbalize complaints of dizziness or lightheadedness that are potentially associated with hypotension, study personnel and caregivers will be trained to recognize the signs of hypoten sion in 
this population, which may include tachycardia, pallor, diaphoresis, lethargy, delayed capi[INVESTIGATOR_39093], and poor feeding. Appropriate rigorous training will be required for parents and caregivers 
prior to daily injections at home. Training include s the storage, reconstitution, and administration of 
BMN  111, as well as documentation/reporting of AEs and vigilance for signs of hypotension.  
It is generally expected that after subjects are tolerating the drug well and specified criteria have been met, caregivers will begin administering study drug. Home health care is not required at any 
point but may be provided if the caregiver is unable or unavailable to administer the study drug. A 
Home Healthcare nurse will train the caregiver(s) if training has not been completed by [CONTACT_48657] [ADDRESS_377711] can be made via email.   
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_51253], serious AEs (SAEs), laboratory test results (urinalysis, chemistry, and hematology), vital signs, physical examination, ECG and 
echocardiogram, hip clinical assessment, and ant i-BMN 111 immunogenicity assessments.  Clinical 
laboratory tests, PK, immunogenicity and blood biomarker assessments will be limited to the 
minimum necessary for evaluation of safety and efficacy in order to minimize blood volume in the 
pediatric populatio n. 
Efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_308523]/height Z-score. Exploratory 
assessments will include change from baseline in growth parameters and body proportions by 
[CONTACT_308454]. X -rays will be performed of the lower extremities a nd spi[INVESTIGATOR_308395], quality, and growth. An MRI will be performed to assess the effect of BMN [ADDRESS_377712]-certified, fe llowship -trained (or equivalent) pediatric anesthesiologist will 
administer anesthesia during MRI measurements in the event that the subject is unable to remain still for the duration of the scan. Sleep studies will be conducted to evaluate sleep apnea. Ad ditional 
assessments will be conducted to evaluate changes from baseline in bone metabolism and BMN111 pharmacodynamic biomarkers, and developmental/functional status.

STATISTICAL METHODS:  
Sample Size Determination: Approximately 7 0 subjects age 0 to < 60 months at study entry will 
participate in this study. No formal sample size calculations were performed. The number of subjects is considered appropriate to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BMN 111 in the target 
population.    
Safety Analysis: All su bjects who receive at least one dose of study treatment or who are 
randomized to the placebo -control group in this study will be included in the safety analysis. The 
safety analysis will be descriptive.  
All AEs will be coded using the most current version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) to assign system organ class and preferred term classification to event and 
disease, based on the original terms entered on the eCRF. The incidence of AEs will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_9313], pr eferred term, relationship to study treatment as assessed by [CONTACT_1275], seriousness, and severity. All AEs, including SAEs and AEs that lead to permanent 
discontinuation from the study and from the study treatment, will be listed. 
All other safety m easures including laboratory tests, vital signs, ECG, echocardiogram, hip clinical 
assessment, and concomitant medication data will also be summarized descriptively. Data 
summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_1570] (when applicable) for each cohort and overall. All 
safety results will be listed.  
Efficacy Analysis:  
All randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study treatment or placebo in the study 
will be included in the efficacy analysis.  
Efficacy variables, including AGV (based on length/ height) and length/ height Z -score according to 
normal reference standards (not ACH), along with their change from baseline will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_308456]. Comparisons between treatment groups by [CONTACT_308527] o ut where appropriate. Statistical comparisons will be considered descriptive. 95% 
CIs will be provided along with p values for treatment group comparisons.

 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377752] common form 
of dwarfism.  
ACH is a rare disease with a prevalence of 1/[ZIP_CODE] in the US ( Wynn, 2007)  The average 
adult heights for men and women with ACH are 131 cm and 124 cm, respectively (NIH,  Genetics Home Reference, 2012 ).  Characteristic features include long and narrow 
trunk, a large head with frontal bossing, hypoplasia of the mid- face, bowed leg s and stenosis 
of the foramen and spi[INVESTIGATOR_308363] -threatening. Foramen magnum stenosis can 
lead to cervicomedullary compression in infants with complications including hydrocephalus, hypotonia, respi[INVESTIGATOR_5448], apnea, cyanotic epis odes, feeding problems, 
quadriparesis, and sudden death.  
There is no approved pharmacological therapy for achondroplasia in the US or EU. Current treatments for achondroplasia are focused on neurosurgical interventions for foramen magnum stenosis or lumba r stenosis, thoracolumbar braces to help ameliorate the kyphosis, 
or limb lengthening requiring multiple operations over 2 to 3 years (Shirley,  2009), 
(Horton, 2007).  
ACH is caused by a gain -of-function mutation in FGFR3, a negative regulator of 
chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation.  The most common mutation (98%) in ACH patients is a G380R substitution in the transmembrane domain of FGFR3.  The majority of 
new cases (80%) originate from parents with normal stature.   
The extracellular signal- regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen -activated protein kinase (MAPK) 
pathway mediates part of FGFR3 inhibition of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation (Foldynova -Trantirkova, 2012).  The ERK MAPK pathway is modulated by [CONTACT_308465], a positive 
regulator of chondroc yte proliferation and differentiation.  Binding of CNP to the Natriuretic 
Peptide -Receptor B (NPR- B) antagonizes FGFR3 downstream signaling by [CONTACT_308466] (ERK1/2) pathway at the level of RAF -1 (Krejci, 2005); (Yasoda, 2004); 
(Yasoda,  2009); (Pejch alova, 2007).  This crosstalk was demonstrated in a mouse model of 
FGFR3 -related chondrodysplasia (Yasoda, 2004); (Yasoda, 2009).  The dwarfism phenotype 
of mice harboring the FGFR3G380R mutation was rescued by [CONTACT_308529] (infusion).  
CNP is a member of the natriuretic peptide (NP) family that includes Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) and B -type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP). These peptides are structurally related 
but are distinct paracrine/autocrin e (CNP) or endocrine (ANP and BNP) factors that regulate 
the cardiovascular (CV), skeletal, nervous, reproductive and other systems. Synthetic analogs 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377753] 2018  
of ANP (anaritide and carperitide) and BNP (nesiritide) have been investigated as potential 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_308401] -related 
diseases.  
BMN 111 is a 39 -amino acid CNP analogue harboring the 37 amino acids of the human 
CNP53 C- terminal sequence and modified by [CONTACT_308530] (Pro -Gly) on 
the N -terminus.  It is a recombinant human peptide fused to human transcription factor 
(TAF) and expressed as an inclusion body in E. coli.  BMN 111 is liberated and solubilized from the TAF -fusion protein by [CONTACT_308531], and purified by [CONTACT_308532] ( Long, 2012).  BMN 111 was designed to 1) mimic CNP activities in terms 
of receptor binding and pharmacological activity and 2) be resistant to neutral endopeptidase (NEP) digestion in order to have an extended half -life in comparison to CNP that is 
presumed to increase exposure to the target growth plate ( Wendt, 2015).  
A comprehensive review of BMN 111 is contained in the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure supplied by [CONTACT_189447].  Investigators are required to review the Investigator’s Brochure prior to initiating this study. 
7.1 Nonclinical Studies  
The pharmacological activity of BMN  111 was explored in two mouse models of ACH, a 
severe, Fgfr3Y367C/+ model ( Lorget, 2012), and a mild [Ach] /+ model.  Partial or complete 
reversion of the ACH phenotype was observed in these mouse models after 
BMN  111 
administration.  Additionally, in wild- type mice, and normal rats and monkeys, BMN 111 
administration resulted in growth plate expansion and dose -dependent skeletal growth at 
hemodynamically tolera ted dose levels ( Wendt, 2015).  
BMN 111- related adverse findings in nonclinical species (mice, rats, cynomolgus monkeys) 
were limited to the known mechanism of action of CNP on the growth plate and vasculature.  
Reversible subcutaneous injection site react ions were reported, including injection site 
discoloration and microscopic findings of perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrates that were seen with slightly higher incidence and severity in BMN 111- treated rats and monkeys 
compared to the vehicle control.  Adverse skeletal changes associated with exaggerated 
growth were seen in normal nonclinical species with open growth plates, and were dose -, 
exposure - and time -dependent. Decreases in blood pressure and compensatory increases in 
heart rate were detected in monkeys across multiple studies, with overt CV -related clinical 
signs observed in some animals at doses ≥ 236 µg/kg. These overt clinical signs consisted of 
transient, short and repeated bouts of sternal or lateral recumbency and/or reduced motor activi ty, typi[INVESTIGATOR_16195] 1- hour post -dose administration.  Additional detailed information 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377754] 2018  
about nonclinical studies of BMN 111 is provided in the current version of the Investigator’s 
Brochure supplied by [CONTACT_189447].   
7.2 Previous Clinical Studies  
7.2.1 Study 111 -101 
Study 111- 101, “A Phase 1, Two Part, Double Blind, Placebo -Controlled Study to Evaluate 
the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Single and Multiple Doses of BMN  111 
Administered to Healthy Adult Volunteers,” was a first- in-human study conducted in 2 parts 
to allow for assessment of the safety, tolerability, and PK of BMN 111 administered as a single dose and as a multiple dose to healthy adult male volunteers.  
Doses ranging from 5.0 µg/kg to 15.0 µg/kg were administered as a single daily SC dose; doses ranging from 0.5 µg/kg to 8.0 µg/kg were administered in the multiple ascending dose segment of the study. As expected, mild, transient, self -limited hypotension occurred. 
The majority of these cases were asymptomatic and observed upon assumption of an  upright 
posture following recumbence. Hypotension events were reported in the BMN [ADDRESS_377755] 
dose on Day 1 of the multiple dose study in Part 2. The results demonstrate that BMN 111 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_308366], reaching a mean time to peak concentration (T
max) between 
15-26 minutes. After reaching maximal plasma concentrations, BMN 111 levels rapi[INVESTIGATOR_308367], with a t 1/2 of 40- 55 minutes. Mean plasma concentration -time profiles indicate that 
exposure increased with dose from 2.5 to 15 µg/kg. The corresponding increases in plasma 
Cmax and area under the curve (AUC) exposure parameters were greater than dose 
proportional. The increase in C max with dose was linear over the dose range evaluated.  
In Part 2, with multiple dosing at 5 µg/kg f or [ADDRESS_377756] 2018  
increased slightly by +33% over Day 1.  Overall the results indicate that changes in 
BMN [ADDRESS_377757] 6 months 
of growth data are collected.  
Data gathered from this study are used to characterize baseline growth data in children or 
infants (defined as children < 2 years of age) who may subsequently be enrolled in future studies sponsored by [CONTACT_189447], and may also be used to establish historical control cohort for use in other BioMarin- sponsored studie s, when appropriate. For that reason, data related 
to ACH symptoms, tests, and interventions are collected.  
7.3.2 Study 111 -202 
Study 111- 202 is an ongoing Phase 2, open- label, sequential cohort, dose escalation study 
that assesses daily SC administration of BMN  111 in pediatric subjects with ACH. 
The primary objective of Study 111- 202 is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BMN 111 
administered for 6  months and up to 24 months; the secondary objectives are to determine 
change from baseline in annualized gr owth velocity (AGV), growth parameters, body 
proportions, and evaluate the dose -exposure and PK profiles of BMN 111 in children with 
ACH.  
Analysis of safety data from the 6 -month initial phase of Study 111- 202 showed that 
treatment with BMN 111 for 6 mont hs at dose cohorts of 2.5, 7.5, 15, and 30 µg/kg 
(Cohorts  1 to 4, respectively) was generally well tolerated. The most common AEs were mild 
injection site reactions, asymptomatic hypotension, headache, and nasopharyngitis. For a detailed summary of risks, please refer to the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure supplied by [CONTACT_189447].  
Analysis of efficacy data from the 6 -month initial phase of Study 111- 202 demonstrated that 
the mean (standard deviation) change from baseline AGV when BMN 111 is adm inistered at 
2.5, 7.5, 15, and 30 µg/kg subcutaneously daily for 6 months is -0.37 (1.592), 1.28 (1.439), 
2.01 (1.999), and 2.08 (2.137) cm/year, respectively.  Thus, a positive dose -dependent 
response was observed in change from baseline AGV at doses rang ing from 2.5- 15 µg/kg 
daily.

For longer term follow up data from the 202 study, please refer to the current Investigator 
Brochure supplied by [CONTACT_189447].  
7.3.3 Study 111 -205 
Study 111- 205 is an ongoing open- label, Phase 2 extension study to assess long- term safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy of BMN  111 in children with ACH. Subjects continue receiving the 
same stable dose of BMN 111 received upon completion of the 111- 202 study (up to 
30 µg/kg daily). This [ADDRESS_377759] completing 2 years of BMN 111 treatment in Study 111- 202 (7 years 
total BMN 111 treatment duration). Additional exploratory endpoints ar e being examined to 
determine long -term effects of BMN 111 on bone physiology and the medical complications 
of ACH.  
7.3.4 Study 111 -301 
Study 111- 301 is an ongoing Phase 3, double -blind, placebo -controlled multicenter study to 
further characterize and confirm ef ficacy and safety of BMN 111 at 15 µg/kg in a 58 -week 
study (up to 4 weeks of screening, 52 weeks of treatment, plus an additional 2 weeks of safety follow up). The study assesses the effect of daily BMN 111 administration on change from baseline in AGV, h eight, and body proportions in subjects treated with BMN 111 
compared with control subjects in the placebo group; and further characterizes safety and tolerability of BMN [ADDRESS_377760] of BMN 111 on bone physiology and to assess quality of 
life and daily function of study subjects.  
7.3.5 Study 111 -302 
Study 111- 302 is an open- label Phase 3 extension study to further evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of BMN 111 either until subj ects reach near -final adult height (defined as evidence of 
growth plate closure and <  1.5 cm/yr annualized growth velocity), or  for 5 years if near -final 
adult height ( NFAH)  occurs prior to the end of the 5- year period.  All subjects will receive 
BMN 111 1 5 µg/kg. This study will allow for long- term assessment of the effect of daily 
BMN [ADDRESS_377761] degradation by 
[CONTACT_308446], allowing for a longer half -life. 
The pharmacological activity of BMN 111 was explored in two mouse models of ACH, a severe, Fgfr3Y367C/+ (TD ) model ( Lorget, 2012), and a milder [Ach] /+ (Ach) model. These 
included studies in 7 -day old TD mice given BMN 111 daily by [CONTACT_308520] 
20 days and a study in 3 week old Ach mice given BMN 111 daily by [CONTACT_275269] 5 weeks. Parti al or complete reversion of the ACH phenotype was observed in these mouse 
models after BMN 111 administration. In wild -type mice, and normal rats and monkeys, 
BMN 111 administration resulted in growth plate expansion and dose -dependent skeletal 
growth at hemodynamically tolerated dose levels ( Wendt, 2015). Additionally, the potential 
effect of age on BMN [ADDRESS_377762] 
severe complication, cervicomedullary compression (CMC), occurs in a subset of subjects 
with ACH due to abnormal endochondral bone growth and narrowing of the for amen 
magnum ( White, 2016 ). CMC has been linked to serious respi[INVESTIGATOR_308368], apnea, ataxia, developmental delay, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_308402] ( Mukherjee, 2014 ). Foramen magnum decompression surgery 
is currently the only treatment for this condition.   
Sleep apnea has also been extensively described in ACH, and sleep -disordered breathing may 
affect up to 85% of all children with ACH ( Ireland, 2012). This is thought to be due to 
midface hypoplasia, relative adenotonsillar hypertrophy, and potential posterior cranial fossa compression secondary to abnormal endochondral bone growth. Sleep apnea in ACH not only results in the need for surgical intervention, but has also been linked to sudden deat h in 
rare cases ( Pauli, 1984 ).   
Similarly, the dysregulation of endochondral bone growth in ACH leads to other medical 
complications which are prevalent in this subject population, such as the following:  
• Spi[INVESTIGATOR_16078], kyphosis, and lordosis (secondary to altered growth plate ossification 
in the vertebrae and narrowing of the interpedicular distances) ( Shirley, 2009)  
• Developmental delay of gross motor and ambulatory skills (associated with proximal 
limb shortening, macrocephaly, and hypotonia) ( Ireland, 2010)  
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377763] 2018  
• Delayed functional skills and increased need for caregiver assistance (eg, eating, 
bladder management, bowel management, transfer to chair, climbing stairs) (Ireland,  2011)  
Thus, BMN 111 may provide greater benefit when children begin treatment at a younger age, 
as earlier initiation of treatment allows a longer time window to improve growth and potential to improve medical complications of achondroplasia. This study (111- 206) is being 
conducted to assess safety and the potential benefit of BMN 111 in  infants and young 
children.   
BioMarin has engineered a CNP analog (BMN 111) that has a longer half -life than 
endogenous CNP, thereby [CONTACT_308472]. Similar to CNP, BMN 111  
activates NPR -B signaling with subsequent inhibition of FGFR3 downstream signaling, 
leading to the promotion of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation and subsequent increased endochondral bone formation. BMN 111 administration has been shown to promote endochondral bone formation at hemodynamically tolerated dose levels in both normal animals and mouse models of ACH reported (refer to current Investigator ’s Brochure 
for additional information).  
Human studies to date have also demonstrated that BMN  111 is generally well tolerated at 
doses that result in improvements in growth velocity approaching that of children of average stature.  
Study 111- 202 is an ongoing Phase 2, open- label, sequential cohort, dose escalation study 
that assesses daily SC administration of BMN  111 in pediatric subjects with ACH, in which 
the primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BMN  111 administered for 
6 months and up to 24 months and includes secondary objectives consisting of determination 
of ch ange from baseline in AGV, growth parameters, body proportions, and evaluation of the 
dose-exposure and PK profiles of BMN  111 in children with ACH.  
Analysis of safety data from the 6 -month initial phase of Study 111- 202 showed that 
treatment with BMN  111 was generally well tolerated at all dose levels (refer to current 
Investigators Brochure for specific details).  
Analysis of efficacy data from Study 111- 202 demonstrated that that subjects given 
BMN 111 at the dose of 15 µg/kg daily had an improvement in AGV, with approximately ~50% increase over baseline seen with treatment for 6 months which was sustained after continued treatment for 12 months.  
Subjects treated with 30 µg/kg daily also showed similar improvement in mean AGV after 
[ADDRESS_377764] 2018  
15 µg/kg daily. Safety data for the 30 -µg/kg daily dose was also similar to the 15 -µg/kg daily 
dose.  Given that no clinically significant difference could be identified between the 
15-µg/kg and 30- µg/kg daily dose in the Phase 2, 6- month safety and efficacy data, the lower 
of the two doses has been chosen for this Phase 2  study.  
Study 111- 206 is a Phase 2 randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled clinical trial of 
BMN 111 in infants and younger children with a diagnosis of ACH who are age 0 to < [ADDRESS_377765]  on efficacy endpoints. Additional exploratory endpoints pertaining to 
medical complications of ACH will also be evaluated.  
7.5 Summary of Overall Risks and Benefits  
7.5.1 Summary of Risks from Nonclinical Studies  
Individuals in this study will be exposed to a reco mbinant analogue of human C -type 
natriuretic peptide (CNP). Based on the results of experimentation in animals, the most relevant potential toxicities relate to the expected pharmacological effects of exogenous CNP 
administration, including hemodynamic cha nges, skeletal overgrowth, and injection site 
reactions. Transient and sporadic decreases in blood pressure and compensating increases in 
heart rate occurred within the first hour post -dose in cynomolgus monkeys; the effects were 
mainly asymptomatic with a  subset of animals given doses ≥ 236 µg/kg observed with 
symptomatic effects consisting of transient, short and repeated bouts of sternal or lateral 
recumbency and/or reduced motor activity. These hemodynamic effects can be monitored, but have the potentia l to be an acute dose -limiting factor in patients.  Exaggerated 
appendicular bone responses to the drug included abnormally shaped femoral head, acetabular growth center/plate dysplasia and concomitant articular cartilage degeneration with clinical manifes tations of restricted use of hips. Adverse skeletal changes associated 
with exaggerated growth were dose -, exposure - and time -dependent. Additional detailed 
information about risks identified in nonclinical studies of BMN 111 is provided in the current ver sion of the Investigator’s Brochure supplied by [CONTACT_189447].   
7.5.2 Summary of Risks from Clinical Studies  
[IP_ADDRESS] Study [ADDRESS_377766] -in-human Phase 1 study of BMN  111 in healthy adult volunteers, 
Study 111- 101, BMN 111 administered SC daily was well tolerated with doses ranging from 
0.5 µg/kg to 15 µg/kg. All AEs were of mild severity, and no SAEs were reported. The most common AE was mild, transient, self -limited orthostatic hypotension, of which the majority 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377767] 2018  
of cases were asymptomatic and observed only upon assumption of an upright posture 
following recumbence. No dose -limiting toxicities were identified outside of these CV 
events.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Ongoing Studies  
Based on analysis of safety data from ongoing phase [ADDRESS_377768] been reported as non -serious, Grade 1 in severity, and transient. Hypotension a nd 
hypersensitivity reactions including development of BMN 111 antibodies are potential risks associated with BMN 111 injections. For a detailed summary of risks, please refer to the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure supplied by [CONTACT_189447].

As subjects age on study, they will be administered the dose de termined to be appropriate for 
their current age.  For example, if a subject enrolls into Cohort 2 at age 20 months, they will 
receive the recommended dose for subjects aged ≥ 6 to  < 24 months until the y turn 24 months 
in age.  When they turn 24 months in age, they will begin to receive the recommended dose 
for subjects aged ≥ 24 to < [ADDRESS_377784] -dosing. Because younger children 
may not be able to verbalize complaints of dizziness or lightheadedness that are potentially associated with hypotension, study personnel and caregivers w ill be trained to recognize the 
signs of hypotension in this population, which may include tachycardia, pallor, diaphoresis, lethargy, delayed capi[INVESTIGATOR_39093], and poor feeding. Appropriate rigorous training will be required for parents and caregivers pri or to daily injections at home. Training includes the 
storage, reconstitution, and administration of BMN 111, as well as documentation/reporting of AEs and vigilance for signs of hypotension.  
It is generally expected that after subjects are tolerating the drug well and specified criteria have been met, caregivers will begin administering study drug. Home health care is not required at any point but may be provided if the caregiver is unable or unavailable to administer the study drug. A Home Healthcare nurs e will train the caregiver(s) if training has

thereafter until the BP returns to baseline (or within the normal range for this subject as defined by [CONTACT_976]) and signs (if pres ent) res olve.  
7. If the decision is made to adjust the dose, vital signs will be obtained for at least [ADDRESS_377794] -dose 
on study day visits at which a dose is given; in addition, on Day 1, ECGs will be performed pre -dose.  On days when PK samples are being drawn, ECGs 
should be performed within a 5- minute window prior to 30- minute PK assessment . 
i Echocardiogram is obtained at the early termination visit only if the previous assessment was done more than 3 months prior to early termin ation . 
j Growth measures may be collected in triplicate approximately the same time each day (± [ADDRESS_377795] measurement assessment was 
taken at Screening). Measurements may include but are not limited to length, standing height (if ab le to stand unsupported), crown- to-rump length, head 
circumference, upper and lower arm and leg, and arm span. Measurements not taken in the midsagittal plane should be taken on the right side of the body if possible and should always be taken on the same side of the body throughout the study.

k Clinical labs (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) are all pre -dose draws samples and can be drawn anytime during the visit if there is no drug 
administration.  
l Plasma samples will be collected pre- dose and at 5 (±  2 min), 15 (± 2 min), 30 (± 5 min), 45 (± 5 min), 60 (± 5 min), 90 (± 5 min), and 120 (± 5 min) minutes 
post-dose. On Day 1, additional PK samples will be collected at 180 (± 5 min) and 240 (± 5 min) minutes. Samples with volume remai ning after 
pharmacoki netic assessment will be used for cGMP pharmacodynamics assessment.   NOTE: In the event of interruption of study drug administration for a 
sentinel patient on Day 1 when PK samples are scheduled, the collection of PK samples should be delayed until the sub sequent day and only performed after 
successful administration of study drug has been completed in a single injection.  
m Antibodies:  Total anti- BMN 111 (TAb) , TAb cross -reacting with endogenous natriuretic peptides,  and neutralizing antibody (NAb) samples ( serum) will be

baseline and  TAb positive samples from subjects weighing ≥  7.0 kg and waived for subjects < 7.0 kg.  Drug -specific IgE will be drawn pre -dose on Day 1 for 
subjects weighing ≥ 7.0 kg and waived for subjects < 7.0 kg to stay within the limits of permitted blood volume collections in infants. Total immunoglobulin E 
(IgE) and drug -specific IgE will be drawn in the event of Grade 3 hypersensitivity adverse event) or at Investigator or Sponsor discretion. If such an event 
occurs, the drug -specific IgE sample should be drawn at least 8 hours after the event start time or before the next dose. A sample f or total IgE and serum 
tryptase should be drawn within an hour of the start of the event when possible or during an unscheduled safety visit.  
n Bone metabolism blood biomarkers will be waived at screening for subjects weighing <  7.[ADDRESS_377797] subjects at this visit. 
Serum samples for bone metabolism biomarkers will be collected pre -dose on the indicated visits. Bone metabolism blood biomarkers include bone -specific 
alkaline phosphatase and collagen type X.  
o Urine biomarkers and urine chemistry (urine creatinine test) should be obtained pre-  and post -dose (approximately 2- 4 hours after study drug administration) 
for subjects when possible at the indicated visits. The time of collection will be recorded. Urine biomarkers includ e cGMP and C -terminal telopeptide of cross -
linked collagen type II (CTX -II). 
p Hip monitoring: this assessment will include medical history of the hip and physical exam to determine changes in hip functio n or pain with hip range of 
motion. Adverse changes fr om baseline will trigger further evaluation.

obtained.  
 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377805] body weight did not directly translate to differences in total body clearance of 
BMN 111.  The same weight -based dose in the pediatric population of Study 111- 202 
(5-12 years old) yielded lower exposure ( Cmax and AUC) than that characterized in the adult 
population of Study 111- 101.  Therefore, the same weight -based dose in the young pediatric 
population in this study may yield exposure less than the target exposure range characterized to be safe and effective in Study 111- 202 at the 15- µg/kg dose. Since this is the first 
experience with BMN 111 in this young pediatric population, it is also possible the exposure at 15 μg/kg could be greater than the target exposure range, and dose adjustment may be warranted. Thus, an option for adjustment of the weight -based dose is provided to ensure that 
the appropriate target exposure for safety and efficacy is reached for the young s ubjects in 
this study.   
The need for dose adjustment will be evaluated as follows: three sentinel subjects in Cohort 1 will receive an initial dose of 15 µg/kg. After all three sentinel subjects reach Day 8, the Sponsor will review and evaluate all available safety and PK data (at minimum). If the 
criteria for dose adjustment are met, the three sentinel subjects will be started on the new adjusted dose at their next scheduled visit, and vital signs will be obtained for at least [ADDRESS_377806] enrolls into Cohort 2 at age 20 months, they will receive the recommended dose for subjects aged 
≥ 6 to  < 24 months until the y turn 24 months 
in age.  When they turn 24 months in age, they will begin to receive the recommended dose for subjects aged 
≥ 24 to < 60 months. 
Criteria for Dose Adjustment  
The criteria for dose adjustment are based on obtaining equi valent exposure characterized to 
be safe and effective with the 15 -μg/kg dose in Study 111- [ADDRESS_377807] 2018  
sentinel subjects is less than the 25th percentile for AUC 0-120 in Cohort 3 (15 μg/kg) of Study 
111-[ADDRESS_377808] body weight will 
be determined us ing a population PK modelling approach and available data from this study 
and Studies 111- 202 and 111- 101. The recommended adjusted dose will be determined using 
the following expression:  
  
where WT ref and Dose ref are the typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] (i.e., median) subject body weight and total dose, 
respectively, at the 15 μg/kg dose level in Cohort 3 of Study 111- 202, and WT ch is the 
anticipated median weight in the age cohort being studied. As such, the recommended adjusted dose will target the median AUC
0-120 observed at t he 15 μg/kg dose level of Study 
111-202. The recommended adjusted dose, Dose ch, will be normalized by [CONTACT_308475], to provide 
the recommended adjusted weight -based dose. The following rules will be used for dose 
adjustment:  
• A maximum of a 2 -fold increase in dose/ kg will be permitted between dose 
adjustments regardless of exposure.  
• The total dose will not exceed the highest total dose administered in Study 111- 202.

9.2 Discussion of Study Design, Including Choice of Control Group 
Study 111- 206 is a Phase 2 randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled clinical trial of 
BMN 111 in infants and younger children with a diagnosis of ACH who are age 0 to 
< [ADDRESS_377812].  Additionally, this design provides a framework for interpretation of any endpoints with a  
subjective component, e.g. HRQO L and ADL questionnaires and any subjective assessment 
of safety.  
9.3 Selection of Study Population  
Subjects age 0 months to
 < [ADDRESS_377813] meet all of the following criteria: 
1. Diagnosis of ACH, confirmed by [CONTACT_21920].  If subjects had previous genetic 
testing, subjects must have a lab report from a certified laboratory with the study

9.3.6 Removal of Subjects from Treatment or Assessment  
Subjects (or their legally authorized representative) may withdraw their consent to participate 
in the study at any time without prejudice. The Investigator must withdraw from the study any subject who requests to be withdrawn. A subject’s participation in the study may be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the Investigator and in accordance with his/her clinical judgment. When possible , the tests and evaluations listed for the termination visit 
should be carried out.  BioMarin must be notified of all subject withdrawals as soon as possible.  
Investigators may discontinue administration of BMN  [ADDRESS_377827] from study treatment include, 
but are not limited to, the following:  
1. Subject experiences a serious or intolerable AE due to BMN [ADDRESS_377828] (or the subject’s legally authorized representative, if appropriate) requesting contact [CONTACT_31387]. This information should be recor ded in the study 
records.  
The Investigator or designee must  explain to each subject, before enrollment into the study, 
that for evaluation of study results, the subject’s protected health information obtained during the study may be shared with the study sponsor, regulatory agencies, and IRB/IEC/REB. It is the Investigator’s (or designee’s) responsibility to obtain written permission to use protected health information per country- specific regulations, such as HIPAA in the US, from each 
subject, or if appr opriate, the subject’s legally authorized representative. If permission to use 
protected health information is withdrawn, it is the Investigator’s responsibility to obtain a written request, to ensure that no further data will be collected from the subject  and the 
subject will be removed from the study. 
It is a priority of the study to maximize study subject retention and adherence to 
study- specific procedures. The completeness of the study data may affect the integrity and 
accuracy of the study results.  T herefore, subjects who discontinue study treatment should be 
encouraged to continue to undergo as many of the protocol -specified procedures and 
assessments as possible for the remainder of the study, as long as such continued 
participation does not detrime ntally affect the health, safety, or welfare of the subject.   
For subjects who discontinue BMN  111 or placebo but remain in the study, PK and 
BMN 111 activity assessments will be waived completely; vital signs and clinical labs/biomarkers will be obtained  only once at each visit subsequent to BMN  [ADDRESS_377829] has 
discontinued dosing and vital sign and clinical lab/biomarkers assessments previously designated as “post -dose” wil l be waived.  All other assessments at each visit should be 
completed if possible and the subject is willing.  Data from the study procedures and assessments may be used to further characterize the natural progression of ACH.  
BioMarin reserves the right t o discontinue the study at any time.  Premature termination of 
the study may occur because of regulatory authority decision, a change in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1100]/IEC/REB, clinical or safety reasons, or at the discretion of the Sponsor.   The Sponsor 
reserves the right to discontinue the development of BMN 111 at any time, or to discontinue participation by [CONTACT_187658].  Any decision to terminate the study will be promptly communicated to Investigators , regulatory authorities, and IRB/IEC/REB.   The Investigator is responsible for 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377830] of 
the study and the participating subjects (and their families).  
9.3.[ADDRESS_377831] occurred following 
completion of dosing. 
Follow -up assessments and procedures should be performed as outlined in the Study 111- 206 
Schedule of Events ( Table  9.1.1 and Table  9.1.2).  
Subjects who discontinue from study treatment will be asked to complete study assessments 
and proc edures for the remainder of the study.  If subjects discontinue from study treatment 
and decline to participate for the remainder of the study, they will be asked to return for a 
final follow -up visit [ADDRESS_377832] dose , and the agreement should be documented.  
Subjects will participate in the study until completion or until one of the following occurs: 
the subject withdraws consent and discontinues from the study, the subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the investigator or BioMarin (upon consultation and in agreement with the investigator) or the study is terminated.  
9.4 Treatments  
9.4.1 Treatments Administered  
BioMarin and/or its designee will provide the study site with a supply of IP sufficient for the 
completion of the study.  
Sentinel subjects will receive BMN 111 at a daily dose of 15  µg/kg ( subject to adjustment 
per protocol). S ubjects will be randomized to BMN  111
 at a daily dose of 15 µg/kg (subject 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377833] 2018  
to adjustment per protocol) or placebo for the duration of the study. The norm al dosing 
schedule is a single daily subcutaneous injection given 7 days a week.  
If a recent acute illness associated with volume depletion (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) 
has not completely resolved prior to the first dose of BMN  111 or placebo, the dosing will be 
delayed until hydration status has improved (up to the maximum period allowed for the visit window). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Drug Administration  
During the study, BMN 111 or placebo will be administered as a single 15 µg/kg SC 
injection given daily at approximately the same time each day whenever possible.  Determination of appropriate injection sites will be left to the discretion of the investigator.  The same injection site should not be used 2 days in a row, and sites should be rotated.  Study drug should be administered at age -appropriate locations (upper thigh, upper back of 
arm, abdomen or buttocks). Doses may be administered in any of the common SC areas (upper arm, thigh, abdomen, buttocks).  Following administration of each dose at clinic visits, subjects should be observed for 8 hours after the injection on Days 1 and 2; 4 hours on 
Days 3 and 8; and 1 hour on subsequent dosing visits. Subjects should be observed for 30 minutes  after every injection that is not administered at the clinic.  Instr uctions for home 
administration of BMN  111 or placebo for subjects who qualify for parent/caregiver 
administration are provided in the Study Drug Injection Guide and Injection media . 
9.4.2 Identity of BMN 111  
BMN 111
 is cloned into the pJexpress401 vector, expre ssed in E. coli and then purified. 
The drug substance is a modified CNP peptide that retains wild -type activity and specificity. 
The modified CNP sequence is:  
PGQEHPNARKYKGANKKGLSKGCFGLKLDRIGSMSGLGC  
The amino acid sequence is an analogue of the naturally occurring tissue -expressed form of 
C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP -53). BMN 111  is a recombinant 39 amino acid peptide that 
includes the 37 C -terminal amino acids of the human CNP -53 sequence, and is engineered to 
include two additional amino acids (Pro- Gly) on the N -terminus, which renders the peptide 
more resistant to degradation. It is a cyclic peptide formed by [CONTACT_308536]. The molecular weight of the purified product is 4.1 kDa. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Product Characteristics and Labeling  
The clinical drug  product will be supplied in sterile, single -dose, Type I glass vials with 
coated stopper and flip -off aluminum cap. BMN [ADDRESS_377834] 2018  
2-mg lyophilized, preservative -free, white -to-yellow powder for reconstitution with either a 
sterile diluent or sterile water for injection. The reconstituted solution is colorless to yellow 
and contains 0.8 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL of BMN 111, as well as citric acid, sodium citrate, trehalose, mannitol, methionine, polysorbate 80, and sterile water for  injection. The target pH 
of the reconstituted solution is 5.5. Sterile water for injection will be commercially sourced and sterile diluent solution containing all of the above excipi[INVESTIGATOR_308408]. All reconstitution and dose preparation steps will be performed as indicated in the BMN [ADDRESS_377835] including commercially sourced sterile WFI except the drug substance.  
The BMN  111
 or placebo kit label includes the following information: the contents, 
directions, lot number, quantity, subject ID, vial ID, investigator, the required storage conditions, a precautionary statement, the expi[INVESTIGATOR_5695], the study number, and BioMarin Pharmaceutical name [CONTACT_225458]. This may vary based on country requirements.  
9.4.[ADDRESS_377836] be stored under the conditions specified in the Investigator’s Brochure in a secure area accessible only to the designated pharmacists and clinical site personnel. All IP must be stored and inventoried a nd the inventories must be carefully and 
accurately documented according to applicable state, federal and local regulations, ICH GCP, and study procedures.  
Specific information for storage and return of BMN  111 or placebo is provided in the 
Pharmacy Binder , Study Drug Injection Guide, and Injection media.  
9.4.4 Directions for Administration  
Refer to the Study Drug Injection Guide for complete BMN  111 or placebo preparation 
instructions.  
The injection will be administered as a daily dose of BMN  111
 15 µg/kg or placebo given as 
a single subcutaneous injection. The dose should be given at approximately the same time 
every day whenever possible.  Following administration of each dose at clinic visits, subjects 
should be observed for 8 hours after the injection on Days 1 and 2;  4 hours on Days 3 and 8;  
and [ADDRESS_377837] been well hydrated and fed in the hour  prior 
to administration of BMN 111  or placebo. 
Caregivers will administer BMN  111 or placebo at home once approved by [CONTACT_308537]. Instructions on how  to complete and document the 
training can be found in the Study Reference Manual.   
A caregiver will be eligible to administer BMN  111 or placebo if he or she meets all of the 
following criteria:  
• The subject has been on a stable dosing regimen for a minim um of 3 days  
• PI [INVESTIGATOR_308379] 111 or placebo by [CONTACT_18629]  
• The caregiver has completed the Administration Training conducted by [CONTACT_308538], a home health nurse 
may administer BMN  [ADDRESS_377838]’s suitability for continued at -home drug administration will be evaluated by [CONTACT_308487]’s Medical Monitor if a subject experiences a CTCAE Grade 3 or higher AE that is considered possibly or probably drug- related, and/or a hypersensitivity 
reaction during the study.   
9.4.5 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1  ratio, i.e., injection with placebo:15 µg/kg of BMN  111, 
using I XRS.  An independent third- party vendor will develop the randomization schedule so 
that BioMarin and site personnel are blinded to treatment assignments.   NOTE: In Japan, 
subjects are randomized separately within each cohort.  
9.4.[ADDRESS_377839] in children with ACH, is an 
ongoing Phase 2, open- label, sequential -cohort, dose -escalation study that assesses daily SC 
BMN 111 in pediatric subjects with ACH aged 5 -14 years with doses rang ing from 2.5 µg/kg 
to 30 µg/kg.  
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377840] 2018  
Analysis of safety data from the 6 -month initial phase of Study 111- 202 showed that 
treatment with BMN 111 for 6 months at the doses of 2.5, 7.5, 15, and 30 µg/kg was 
generally well tolerated. The most common AEs across all  cohorts were injection site 
reactions, asymptomatic hypotension, headache, and nasopharyngitis. Based on previous experience of the ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial, including the 24- month data cut at 15 µg/kg, 
injection site reactions have been identified as risks associated with BMN 111 injections. For a detailed summary of risks, please refer to the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure supplied by [CONTACT_189447].  
Analysis of efficacy data from the 6 -month initial phase of Study 111- 202 showed that 
subjects treated with BMN 111 for 6 months at doses ranging from 2.5 to 15 µg/kg daily had 
a dose -dependent improvement in AGV, with ~50% improvement in AGV seen at the 
15 µg/kg dose. The data from Cohort 4 (30 µg/kg) show an apparent greater than dose -
proportional increase in BMN 111 plasma exposure (C
max and AUC 0-t), with a marginal 
improvement in both absolute AGV and change from baseline AGV after 6 months of 
BMN 111 treatment when compared with Cohort 3 (15 µg/kg). 
Efficacy/toxicity studies have been con ducted in neonatal and very young animals (7- day 
postpartum mouse and rat) in both a disease (TD mouse) and non- disease (rat) model. 
Given  that this is the first study in infants and young children, an age -based cohort study 
design is used to assess safety  and PK in young children (Cohort 1, ≥ 24 to < 60 months) 
prior to dosing toddlers (Cohort 2, ≥ 6 to < 24 months) and infants (Cohort 3, 
0 to  <  6 months). PK will be monitored and evaluated; Day [ADDRESS_377841] of 
the cohort to target the observed exposure of the 15- µg/kg dose group in Study 111- 202. 
Safety, efficacy and PK data from Study 111- 202, a Phase 2 study in children with ACH, 
where a dose of 15 µg/kg has been and continues to be studied, are expected to be the most 
relevant, and translatable to this study (111 -206).   
[IP_ADDRESS] Selection of Timing of Dose for Each Subject  
9.4.[ADDRESS_377842]- party vendor will develop the randomization schedule so that BioMarin 
and site personnel will not know treatment assignments. BMN  111 or placebo will be labeled 
with the study number and a unique identification number. Subjects and the participating site members will be blinded to the  two study treatments ( BMN 111 or placebo).  
The investigator and other members of staff involved with the study will remain blinded to the treatment randomization code during the assembly procedure. In the event of an 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377843] and/or the study, and 
determine whether the investigator requires further guidance on unblinding.  The Medical Monitor may also communicate with the investigator advice on the care of the subject and define the plan for the subject’s future part icipation in the study. 
9.4.8 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
All medications (prescription, over -the-counter [OTC] and herbal), and nutritional 
supplements [ADDRESS_377844] Accountability (BMN  111 or Placebo)  
The Investig ator or designee is responsible for maintaining accurate records (including dates 
and quantities) of IP(s) received, subjects to whom IP is dispensed (subject -by-subject dose 
specific accounting), and IP lost or accidentally or deliberately destroyed. The Investigator or designee must retain all unused or expi[INVESTIGATOR_16744] (on- site 
CRA) has confirmed the accountability data.

explanation for any destroyed or missing BMN  111 or placebo kits/vials.  
Unused BMN  111 or placebo may be destroyed on site, per the site’s standard oper ating 
procedures, but only after BioMarin has granted approval for destruction. The study monitor must account for all BMN 111 or placebo kits/vials in a formal reconciliation process prior to destruction. The site must document all BMN  [ADDRESS_377846], return 
unused BMN  111 or placebo to the BioMarin contra cted facility. The return of all BMN  111 
or placebo kits/vials must also be documented and accounted for per instructions provided by [CONTACT_189447].  
All BMN 111 or placebo and related materials should be stored, inventoried, reconciled, and destroyed or returne d according to applicable state and federal regulations and study 
procedures.  
9.6 Dietary or Other Protocol Restrictions  
BMN 111
 will be administered as a single daily dose of 15  µg/kg SC injection given daily at 
approximately the same time each day whenever possible. Placebo will be administered as a single SC injection given daily at approximately the same time each day whenever p ossible. 
Following administration of each dose, subjects will be observed for at least [ADDRESS_377847] has ever had; any prior or existing medical conditions that might interfere with study participation or safety; and evaluati on for knee, 
thigh, hip or groin pain, or change in gait/activity.   
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377848]’s biological parents may be assessed (optional) via height 
measurement or stated height. Height measurement can be done at any point in the study.  Prior to the measurement being taken, each parent is required to complete an ICF specific to parent height assessment.  The ICF will be signed prior to the assessment, which can be done at any point in the study. If the biologic al parent is not available during the course of the 
study to take his/her standing height, if consented, the biological parent can provide his/her stated height.  
9.9 Physical Examination Findings  
Physical examination will include assessment of general appearance; CV; dermatologic; 
head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; lymphatic; respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]; GI; musculoskeletal; and neurological/psychological and genitourinary. Other body systems may be examined. Screening results will be the baseline values and clinicall y significant changes from baseline 
will be recorded as an AE or SAE and study drug related or unrelated when appropriate based on the investigator’s clinical judgment.

[IP_ADDRESS] Imaging Assessment Procedures (per Schedule of Events)  
Imaging assessment procedures for all visits must be performed using the same instruments.   
Imaging assessments can be conducted either pre -dose or post -dose. 
• Bilateral lower extremity x -rays, anterior -posterior (AP) view , to assess growth plate  
morphology. 
• Hip imaging via pelvis x -ray to identify hip pathology  
• Lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] x -rays to measure changes from baseline in bone morphology and 
pathology.   
• MRI to evaluate the effect of BMN 111 on skull and brain morphology, including 
foramen magnum, ventricular and brain parenchymal dimensions .  
• DXA (BMD and BMC) of whole body [less head], spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] , and forearm (i ncluding 
ultra-distal, mid -distal , and one third radius regions of interest)  to assess bo ne mineral 
density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC). 
Although X -rays are preferable for consistency across the study population, if there are IRBs 
or IEC s unwilling to allow x -rays in C ohort [ADDRESS_377854]’s imaging assessments. Imaging assessments will be collected and interpreted by a central reader. I f clinically significant abnormalities are noted, the investigator or designee is 
required to assess whether it is appropriate to report an AE and if the subject should continue 
in the study. Refer to the vendor Imaging Guidelines for detailed imaging asse ssment 
requirements and procedures.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Exploratory Biomarker Research Sample Analyses  
All samples collected in this study may be used for  on-study exploratory biomarker research 
once the primary use has been completed.  
For each portion of the blood and urine  samples reserved for protocol -specified analyses, 
there may be multiple sample aliquots. Once samples have been successfully analyzed during 
the study, unused sample portions may be used during the study for assay development or other purposes stated in t his section. No exploratory genomic research will be conducted 
without consent from the subject and his/her legally authorized representative (parent or legal guardian).  
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377855] 2018  
[IP_ADDRESS] Genomic Biomarker Analysis  
While the inherited FGFR3 mutations associated with achondr oplasia are well characterized, 
disease phenotype in monogeneic diseases is often modified by [CONTACT_308539]. 
To identify and study genetic variants that may modify achondroplasia, a whole blood 
sample will be collected.  Exploratory genomics will  include, but are not limited to NPR -B, 
BRAF, and other genes associated with CNP signaling.  Exploratory genomic analysis may inform understanding of the BMN [ADDRESS_377856] and his/her legally authorized representative (parent or legal guardian). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Sleep Study  
Given that sleep apnea is a finding in children with ACH ( Waters, 1993)  and has implications 
on functional and health outcomes, a sleep study will be performed in a limited number of qualified sleep centers.  A sleep -testing device will be used to assess the presence and 
severity of sleep -disordered breathing by [CONTACT_308488], pulse 
rate, and airflow during overnight monitoring. Assessment of epi[INVESTIGATOR_308409], but may not be limited to, the number of e pi[INVESTIGATOR_308410] 
(Apnea/Hypopnea Index).   
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Photography 
To document the physical and phenotypic findings of  achondroplasia with and without  
treatment with study drug, clinical photography of the full body, face, spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and ext remities 
will be conducted. This assessment is optional. If the parents/caregivers decline clinical 
photography, the assessment will be waived for the duration of the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Outcome Assessments  
Clinical outcome assessments will be administered to assess the health -related quality of life 
of study subjects. ADL questionnaires will be performed in study subjects to assess functional performance. Clinical outcome assessments will be performed at the time points indicated in the Schedules of Events ( Table  9.1.1  and Table  9.1.2). The age ranges for 
clinical outcome assessment tools are shown in  Figure  [IP_ADDRESS].1.

[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_377858] /child. 
The time required varies from 15 -60 minutes depending on the child’s developmental level 
and cooperation.  
Scales include Cognitive subscale, Receptive and Expressive subscales, and Gross and Fine 
Motor subscales. The two language scales make up a composite Language Scale score and 
the Gross and Fine Motor subscales yield a composite Mot or Scale score.  
The scales have clinical and research utility as a diagnostic assessment for young children with varied disorders and disabilities, and reflect current professional standards for early childhood assessment ( Bayley, 2006).  
In addition to its use for subjects ranging from 1 to 42 months  old, the Bayley- III assessment 
will be administered to  those entering the study between 42 and 60 months  old 
(Figure  [IP_ADDRESS].1)  and for the remainder of the duration of this study, as this assessment can 
capture  ongoing developmental issues  associated with Achondroplasia .  Bayl ey-III is waived 
for subjects 
 < 1 month old. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Activity of Daily Living and Functional Independence Measure (Wee -FIM)  
The Wee- FIM instrument is an ADL assessment tool that measures functional performance 
across three domains (self -care, mobility and cognition) ( Ireland,  2011; Ireland, 2012).  
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377859] 2018  
The Wee- FIM instrument has been used in previous r esearch in children with ACH, and has 
identified ongoing limitations in functional performance across these domains extending 
beyond the age of 7 yea rs (Ireland , 2011).  Because the WeeFIM considers the child’s 
performance from a caregiver’s perspect ive (Ireland, 2012), this tool in turn gives an 
indication of “burden of care” for families and caregivers of children with ACH.  WeeFIM  is 
waived for children < 6 months old.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3 ITQO L 
The ITQOL is an observer -reported outcome tool developed for use in children from  
2 months to 5 years old that attempts to capture physical, mental and social well -being. 
The ITQOL adopts the World Health Organization’s definition of health as a state of 
complete physical, mental and social well -being, and not merely the absence of dis ease. 
The ITQOL also assesses the quality of the parent/guardians life.  The 97 -item full- length 
version (ITQOL) will be used for this study. Completion time varies.   ITQO L is waived for 
subjects < 2 months old.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_377860] (CBCL) is for use in children from 1.5- [ADDRESS_377861] yields scores in the following areas: reactivity, anxiety, depression, somatic compl aints, withdrawal, sleep 
problems, attention problems, and aggressive behavior. CBCL  is waived for 
children  < 18 months old. 
9.11.5 Pharmacokinetics Variables  
PK plasma samples will be collected pre- dose and at 5 (± 2 min), 15 (± 2 min), 30 (± 5 min), 
45 (± 5 min), 60 (± 5 min), 90 (± 5 min), and 120 (± 5 min) minutes post -dose. On Day 1, 
additional PK samples will be collected at 180 (± 5 min) and 240 (± 5 min) minutes.  In the 
event of interruption of s tudy drug administration for a s entinel patient on Day [ADDRESS_377862] 2018  
Whenever possible, the following PK parameters  will be estimated by [CONTACT_105]- compartmental 
analysis:  
• Area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC0 -∞) 
• Area under the plasma concentration -time curve from [ADDRESS_377863] measurable 
concentration (AUC0- t) 
• Cmax 
• tmax 
• Elimination half -life ( t1/2) 
• Apparent clearance of drug (CL/F)  
• Apparent volume of distribution based upon the terminal phase (Vz/F)

9.11.[ADDRESS_377864] results ( urinalysis, 
chemistry, hematology). Additionally, imaging, hip monitoring, biomarker, immunogenicity, cortisol and prolactin levels, and physical measurement data will be utilized for safety -related 
reviews and analysis.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events  
The occurrence of A Es will be assessed continuously from the time the subject receives study 
drug. The determination, evaluation and reporting of AEs will be performed as outlined in 
Section  10.2.1. Assessments of AEs will occur at the time points shown in the Schedule of 
Events ( Table  9.1.1 and Table  9.1.2). Additionally, contact [CONTACT_3265] a study staff member to the 
caregiver will be required every week for [ADDRESS_377865]’s medical record and on the AE 
eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Procedures During the Study  
All procedures/intervention/surgery will be recorded after informed consent is obtained and after the first administration of study drug, until end of study. 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377866] 2018  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
Specific visits for obtaining clinical laboratory assessment samples are provided in 
Table  9.1.1 and Table  9.1.2. The scheduled clinical laboratory tests are listed in 
Table  [IP_ADDRESS].1. Refer to the Study Reference Manual for instructions on obtaining and 
shippi[INVESTIGATOR_128876]. 
Any abnormal test results determined to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_308540] (at the Investigator’s discretion) until the cause of the abnormality is determined, 
the value returns to baseline or to within normal limits, or the Investigator determines that the abnormal value is no longer clinically significant. 
The investigator s hould assess all abnormal clinical results and include a comment on 
whether or not the result is clinically significant. Each clinically significant laboratory result 
should be recorded as an adverse event. 
The diagnosis, if known, associated with abnormal ities in clinical laboratory tests that are 
considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_187669].

[IP_ADDRESS] Other Laboratory Assessments  
Subjects will be asked to provide blood and urine  at the times indicated in the Schedule of 
Events ( Table  9.1.1 and Table  9.1.2).  Blood volume for testing has been reduced to the 
minimum necessary for adequate evaluation of efficacy and safety of BMN 111. For subjects who have not previously had genetic testing confi rming diagnosis of ACH, 
molecular genetic diagnosis to identify the FGFR3 mutation (G346E, G375C, G380R, or 
“other”) will be performed.  If subjects had previous genetic testing, subjects must have a lab 
report from a certified laboratory with the study specific mutation documented.  
Salivary cortisol and serum prolactin will be collected at the times indicated in the Schedule 
of Events ( Table  9.1.1).

[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs, Physical Examinations and Other Observations Related to Safety  
Vital signs assessed pre- dose will include seated or supi[INVESTIGATOR_9219] (SBP) and 
diastolic blood pressure (DBP) measured in mm  Hg, heart rate in beats per minute, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_11808], and temperature in degrees Celsius (°C).  All treatment 
visits have pre- dose vital sign assessments. Post -dose measurements include heart rate and 
BP. For all dosing visits, assessment frequency is detailed in Table  [IP_ADDRESS].1 (Schedule of 
Events, Table  9.1.1 and Table  9.1.2).  
At Screening, after at least [ADDRESS_377869]’s BP is taken in sitting  or supi[INVESTIGATOR_308411]. Vital sign measurements should be repeated and documented [ADDRESS_377870] has signs potentially consistent with hypotension or a decrease in systolic BP of 20 mm Hg or more from pre -dose systolic BP, blood pressure and heart rate (BP/HR) should 
be measured and recorded approximately every [ADDRESS_377871] hour and every 30 minutes thereafter until the systolic BP returns to pre -dose systolic BP (or within the 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377872] as defined by [CONTACT_976]) and signs (if present) resolve.  If the 
hypotension resolves within the first hour a nd returns to the normal range, additional BP 
monitoring as described above is not required. Detailed guidance for blood pressure measurements is provided in the Blood Pressure Instrument and Technique Guidelines.  
Table  [IP_ADDRESS].1:  Vital Sign Assessment Frequency

least [ADDRESS_377875] has a hypotensive event, or signs potentially consistent with hypotension, or a decrease of 20 
mm Hg systolic BP  or more from baseline (defined by [CONTACT_094] -dose vitals collected that day), vital signs 
should be measured and recorded approximately every 15 minutes (± 5 minutes) for the first hour and 
every 30 minutes (± 5 minutes) thereafter until the BP returns to baseli ne (or within the normal range for 
this subject as defined by [CONTACT_976]) and signs (if present) resolve.  
7. If the decision is made to adjust the dose, vital signs will be obtained for at least [ADDRESS_377876] dose at the adjusted dose level, similar to th e Day 3, 8 schedule.  
8. If a dose adjustment visit coincides with a visit at which a full PK is drawn, vital signs will be obtained for 8 hours, similar to the Day 1,2 schedule.
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Mitigating the Risk of Potential Hypotension  
Study personnel and caregivers should be made aware of the potential risk of hypotension 
with BMN [ADDRESS_377877] 2018  
prior to administration of BMN 111  or placebo.  If a recent acute illness associat ed with 
volume depletion (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) has not completely resolved prior to the 
first dose of BMN  111 or placebo, BMN  111 or placebo dosing may be delayed until 
hydration status has improved (up to the maximum period allowed for the sc reening 
window). 
Caregivers should be trained to observe and recognize the signs of dehydration (e.g. from 
fever, vomiting, diarrhea, etc.) and contact [CONTACT_308541] [ADDRESS_377878] lie down supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], elevating the lower extremities, and administe ring fluids. For guidelines on how to report adverse events 
associated with hypotension, refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiography  
A standard 12- lead ECG will include heart rate, rhythm, intervals, axis, conduction defects, 
and anatomic abnormalities. The time of collection will be recorded. ECGs should be 
performed in triplicate with the subject supi[INVESTIGATOR_308412] s (Table  9.1.1 and Table  9.1.2) .  ECGs will be performed post -dose on study day visits 
at which a dose is given; in addition, on Day 1, ECGs will be performed pre -dose.  On days 
when PK samples are being drawn, ECGs should be performed within a 5- minute window 
prior to 30- minute PK assessment.   If clinically significant abnormalities are note d, the 
investigator or designee is required to assess whether it is appropriate for the subject to continue in the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hip Clinical Assessment  
The hip clinical assessment should be completed by a n appropriately qualified physical 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_253730] a physician (MD) i.e., the investigator or the sub -investigator at the time points 
indicated in the Schedule of Events (Table 9.1.1 and Table 9.1.2). Medical history will be obtained to evaluate for hip, thigh, or knee pain, or change in gait. The physical exam (including observation of gait when possible) identifies and evaluates any changes in hip 
function or pain with assessment of active and passive range of motion. Changes from 
baseline may trigger further evaluation based on the  investigator’s clinical assessment, which 
may include hip imaging and/or orthopedic consultation. If findings on clinical hip exam are determined to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_308542]’s Medical Monitor and orthopedic specialist (if needed), the DMC will be notified of AEs resulting from clinically significant abnormal hip monitoring assessments. DMC may 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377879] 2018  
provide recommendations as to if/when BMN  111 or placebo treatment should be 
temporarily or permanently discont inued.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pediatric Blood Volume  
Clinical labs and immunogenicity samples are necessary to perform to adequate safety 
assessment in this study.  The objectives of testing pharmacodynamics biomarkers are to demonstrate biologic activity of BMN  [ADDRESS_377880] of immune 
responses on drug activity; and for blood biomarkers, to investigate the effects of treatment on changes in bone metabolism and endogenous CNP production.  
To minimize blood collection volumes, assay technologies were chosen that  are capable of 
sensitively detecting analytes using the lowest possible volume of blood for analysis.  Additionally, assays capable of detecting analytes in urine rather than blood have been selected where possible.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Anti - BMN 111  Immunogenicity Assessment s and IgE Testing  
Subjects randomized to receive BMN  111  or placebo will undergo immunogenicity testing. 
Blood (serum) samples for immunogenicity assessments will be collected at the time points indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Table  9.1.1) , and testing performed using validated 
assays. Neutralizing antibody (NAb) testing will be performed on Baseline and TAb positive samples drawn from subjects weig hing ≥  7.0 kg and waived for subjects <  7.0 kg.  
Scheduled samples will be tested in one or more of the following assessments:  
• Anti- BMN 111
 total antibody (TAb)  
• Anti-BMN 111  antibody cross -reactive with endogenous CNP, ANP, and BNP (TAb)  
• Anti- BMN 111  NAb  
Testing for the presence of cross- reactive antibodies that bind to endogenous CNP, ANP, or 
BNP and for the presence of BMN 111  NAbs will be performed on baseline samples and 
anti- BMN 111  TAb-positive samples. Baseline NAb sample and cross- reactive TAb sa mple 
testing will be done at any time prior to the end of study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] HPA Axis Assessments 
To address potential effects of BMN 111 on activation of the hypothalamic pi[INVESTIGATOR_80560] 
(HPA) axis, assessment of salivary cortisol and serum Prolactin levels will be analyzed at the time points indicated in the Schedule of Events (Table 9.1.1). Both t ests will be done at 
Baseline, W eek 26, and Week 52.  
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377881] 2018  
[IP_ADDRESS] Ad Hoc Safety Assessments  
Samples for total IgE and drug- specific IgE testing will be drawn on Day 1 and in the event 
of a significant hypersensitivity AE, or at the discretion of the investigator and/o r BioMarin. 
A significant hypersensitivity AE is defined as an event that is grade 3 or higher, requires 
temporary or permanent cessation of BMN 111, or is determined to be significant at the discretion of investigator and/or BioMarin (excluding reactions that are solely a localized injection site reaction). If a hypersensitivity AE occurs, an unscheduled safety visit should occur no later than 48 hours of the start of the reaction, including inspection of the injection site and clinical laboratory tests.  
Blood (serum) samples should be collected and tested in one or more of the following assessments:  
•  Drug -specific IgE  
• Total IgE  
• Serum tryptase  
If feasible, a sample for drug -specific IgE should be drawn no sooner than 8 hours after the 
event start time or b efore the next dose. A sample for total IgE and serum tryptase should 
also be drawn within 1 hour of the start of the event when possible or during the unscheduled safety visit.  
A localized injection site reaction is defined as skin signs or signs restric ted to one affected 
primary location, i.e., hives, wheals, or swelling or an area of erythema, redness, induration, pain, or itching at or near the site of injection. Management of such localized reactions should be determined by [CONTACT_093]’s clinica l judgment in consultation with the 
Sponsor’s Medical Monitor (if warranted).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Unscheduled Safety Visits  
Unforeseen circumstances may arise in which an unscheduled visit may be needed. In such a case, the procedures performed at the unscheduled visit will b e completed on a case -by-case 
basis.  
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377882] of monitoring and recording protocol -defined AEs and SAEs; 
measurement of protocol -specified hematology, clinical chemistry, and  urinalysis variables; 
measurement of protocol -specified vital signs; and other protocol -defined events of special 
interest that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study drug.  
10.1.1 Adverse Events  
For this protocol, a reportable adverse event (A E) is any untoward medical occurrence 
(e.g., sign, symptom, illness, disease or injury) in a subject  administered the study drug or 
other protocol -imposed intervention, regardless of attribution. This includes the following: 
• AEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the course of the 
study.  
• Pre-existing medical conditions judged by [CONTACT_189577]. 
• Complications that occur as a result of non -drug protocol -imposed interventions 
(eg, AEs related to screening procedures, medication washout, or no- treatment 
run-in). 
An adverse drug reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
study- drug caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means t here is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the study -drug and the AE. 
Whenever possible, it is preferable to record a diagnosis as the AE term rather than a series of terms relating to a diagnosis.  
10.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse ev ent (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose meets 
1 or more of the following criteria:  
• Is fatal  
• Is life threatening  
Note: Life -threatening refers to an event that places the subject  at immediate risk of 
death. This definition does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]    
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377883] 2018  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect in the child or fetus of a subject  exposed to IP 
prior to conception or during pregnancy 
• Is an important medical event or reaction – that, based on medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject  or require intervention to prevent one of the above 
consequences (e.g. anaphylaxis)  
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for SAEs should be regarded as 
non-serious AEs.  
10.1.[ADDRESS_377884] (EOSI)  
The following EOSI need to be reported to the Sponsor wi thin 24 hours of site awareness, 
irrespective of seriousness, severity or causality:  
• Fracture  
• Slipped Capi[INVESTIGATOR_308382] (SCFE) 
• Avascular necrosis or Osteonecrosis  
10.2 Methods and Timing for Capturing and Assessing Safety Parameters  
10.2.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period 
For subjects enrolled in Cohort 1 (  ≥  24 to <  60 months old)  and Cohort 2 (  ≥ 6 to   < 24 months  
old), the study AE reporting period is as follows: after informed consent but prior to initiation 
of study treatment, only SAEs associated with an y protocol -imposed interventions will be 
reported.  After informed consent is obtained and the first administration of study drug, all non-serious AEs and SAEs reporting period begins and continues until [ADDRESS_377885] administration of study drug or the early termination visit, whichever is longer (refer to Section 12.1.11 ). The criteria for determining, and the reporting of, SAEs is 
provided in Section 10.1.2.  For subjects enrolled in C ohort 3 (0 to
 <  6 months old) , the 
collection period for all AEs begins after informed consent is obtained.  
10.2.[ADDRESS_377886]’s  medical record and on 
the AE Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  
10.2.[ADDRESS_377887]  will assess AEs 
for severity, relationship to study drug, and seriousness (refer to Section 10.1.[ADDRESS_377888] 2018  
definitions).  These assessments should be made by a study clinician with the training and 
authority to make a diagnosis (e .g., MD/DO, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, or 
DDS).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Seriousness  
The investigator will assess if an AE should be classified as “serious” based on the seriousness criteria enumerated in Section 10.1.2.  Seriousness serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity  
Severity (as in mild, moderate, or severe headache) is not equivalent to seriousness, which is based on subject /event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a 
threat to a subject’s  life or functioning.  The severity of each will be assessed using the 
defined categories in  Table  [IP_ADDRESS].1. 
The Investigator  or qualified designee  will determine the severity of each AE and SAE , and 
EOSI  using the NCI CTCAE v4. Adverse events that do not have a corresponding CTCAE 
term will be assessed according to the general guidelines for grading used in the CTCAE v4 
as stated below.

telephone, managing money.  
b Self-care ADL refer to the following examples: bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding oneself, using the toilet , 
taking medications, not bedridden.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Causality  
The Investigator will determine the relationship of an AE to the study drug and will record it 
on the source documents and AE eCRF.  To ensure consistency of causality assessments, Investigators should apply the guidance in Table  [IP_ADDRESS].1. 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377890] 2018  
Table  [IP_ADDRESS].1:  Causality Attribution Guidance  
Rela tionshipa Description  
Not Related  • Exposure to the IP has not occurred  
OR 
• The administration of the IP and the occurrence of the AE are not 
reasonably related in time  
OR 
• The AE is considered likely to be related to an etiology other than the use 
of the IP; that is, there are no facts, evidence, or arguments to suggest a 
causal relationship to the IP.  
Related  • The administration of the IP and the occurrence of the AE are reasonably 
related in time  
AND  
• The AE could not be explained by [CONTACT_308543] 
 • The administration of IP and the occurrence of the AE are reasonably related in time  
AND  
• The AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_189579].  
 
Factors suggestive of a causal relationship could include (but are not limited to):  
• Plausible temporal relationship  
• Absence of alternative explanations  
• Rarity of event in a given subject  or disease state  
• Absence of event prior  to study drug exposure  
• Consistency with study product pharmacology  
• Known relationship to underlying mechanism of study drug action  
• Similarity to adverse reactions seen with related drug products  
• Abatement of AE with discontinuation of study drug, and/or r ecurrence of AE with 
reintroduction of study drug 
The investigator’s assessment of causality for individual AE reports is part of the study 
documentation process.  Regardless of the Investigator’s assessment of causality for individual AE reports, the Sponsor will promptly evaluate all reported SAEs against 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377891] only one diagnosis, sign, or symptom per event field on the AE eCRF (e .g., nausea 
and vomiting should not be recorded in the same entry, but as 2 separate entries).  
In order to classify AEs and diseases, preferred terms will be assigned by [CONTACT_168974], using MedDRA  (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities) terminology.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms  
Using accepted medical terminology, enter the diagnosis (if known).  If not known, enter sign(s) and/or symptom(s).  If a diagnosis subsequently becomes available, then this diagnosis should be entered on the AE form, replacing the original entries where appropriate.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events 
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events (e .g., cascade events) should be 
ident ified by [CONTACT_5252].  For example, if severe diarrhea is known to have resulted 
in dehydration, it is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE or SAE on the eCRF.  However, medically important events that may be linked and/or separated in time should be 
recorded as independent events on the eCRF.  For example, if severe hemorrhage leads to 
renal failure, both events should be recorded separately on the eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously,  without resolution, between subject  
evaluation time points.  Such an event should be recorded only once on the eCRF unless its severity increases or decreases (in which case it should be recorded again on the AE eCRF).  
A recurrent AE is one that occurs an d resolves between subject  evaluation time points, but 
then subsequently recurs.  All recurrences of the AE should be recorded on the AE eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hypotension  
If an asymptomatic drop in blood pressure meets the protocol definition of AE per clinical judgment of the reporter, report the event as “blood pressure decreased.”  If the drop in blood 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377892] 2018  
pressure is associated with signs or symptoms, complete the symptomatic hypotension eCRF 
and use the following guidance to report the corresponding AE eCRF: If a unifying diagnosis is available to explain the event of hypotension, report the diagnosis as an AE and capture signs and symptoms on the symptomatic hypotension eCRF page. If no other unifying diagnosis is available, report “hypotension” as the event and capture s igns and symptoms on 
the symptomatic hypotension eCRF page.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Injection Site Reactions 
If an injection site reaction is associated with a single sign or symptom, report the event on 
AE eCRF page (e.g., redness at injection site, AE is injection site redness ). If the injection 
site reaction is associated with multiple signs or symptoms, report injection site reaction as the adverse event on the AE page, and individual signs and symptoms will be reported on the ISR eCRF page (e.g., if the subject experiences r edness and induration, report “Injection site 
reaction” on the AE page, and in the corresponding Injection eCRF page, report erythema and induration).  If the injection site reaction appears after 24 hours, add “delayed” to the term used to describe the ev ent. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory Values  
Laboratory test results will be recorded on the laboratory results pages of the eCRF, or appear on electronically produced laboratory reports submitted directly from the central laboratory, if applicable.  
Any laboratory resu lt abnormality fulfilling the criteria for a SAE should be reported as such, 
in addition to being recorded as an AE in the eCRF.  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as AE if it is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality and any  one or more of the following conditions 
is met:  
• Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]  
• Leading to a change in study medication (e.g. dose modification, interruption or 
permanent discontinuation)  
• Requiring a change in concomitant therapy (e.g. a ddition of, interruption of, 
discontinuation of, or any other change in a conc omitant medication, therapy or 
treatment).  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management (e.g., change of dose, discontinuation of study drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further 
diagnostic investigation, etc.)  
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377893] dose of study medication that falls outside the laboratory 
reference range and meets the clinical significance criteria.  
This does not apply to any abnormal laboratory result that falls outside the laboratory 
reference range but that does not meet the clinical sign ificance criteria (these will be 
analyzed and reported as laboratory abnormalities), those that are considered AEs of the type explicitly exempted by [CONTACT_760], or those which are a result of an AE that has already been reported.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pre-existing Condition s 
A pre -existing condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  Such conditions 
should be recorded as medical history on the appropriate eCRF.  
A pre -existing condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE during the study only  if the 
frequency, intensity, or character of the condition worsens during the study period.  It is 
important to convey the concept that a pre -existing condition has changed by [CONTACT_189692] (e .g., more frequent  heada ches).  
[IP_ADDRESS] General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a pre -existing 
condition (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  During the study, any new clinically significant findings and/or abnormalities discovered on physical examination that meet the definition of 
an AE (or an SAE) must be recorded and document as an AE or SAE on the AE eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or Surgery  
Any AE that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_308413] (refer to Section 10.1.2).  
There are some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_189433].  These scenarios include planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216412]:  
• Perform a protocol -mandated efficacy measurement  
• Undergo a diagnostic procedure  
• Elective surgical procedure for a pre -existing medical condition that has not changed  
• Receive scheduled therapy (study drug or otherwise) for the study indication 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377894] 2018  
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths  
All deaths that occur duri ng the AE reporting period (refer to Section 10.2.1), regardless of 
attribution, will be recorded on the AE eCRF and expeditiously reported to the Sponsor as an 
SAE. 
When recording a death, the event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the eCRF.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, record “Unexplained Death” or “Death of Unknown Cause” on the eCRF.  If the death is attributed to progression of the disease or condition being studies, record “ -” as the SAE term on the eCRF.  
10.4 Reporting Requirements  
The Sponsor is responsible for identifying, prepa ring, and reporting all suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) to the relevant competent authorities, ethics committees, and investigators in accordance with requirements identified in the Clinical Trials Regulations.
 
10.4.1 Expedited Reporting R equirements  
All SAEs and EOSI, if applicable that occur during the course of the AE Reporting Period (refer to Sectio n 10.2.1), whether or not considered related to study drug, must be reported by 
[CONTACT_308544] [ADDRESS_377895] information that fully documents the event before 
notifying BPV of an SAE.  BioMarin may be required to report certain SAEs to regulatory authorities within 7 calendar days of being notified about the event; therefore, it is important that Investigators submit any information requested by [CONTACT_189463].  
If the electronic data capture (EDC) is unavailable, all SAEs should be reported to BPV by [CONTACT_308545] 
[ADDRESS_377896] administration of study drug or study 
discontinuation/termination, whichever is longer.  
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377897] be obtained by [CONTACT_189627].  
10.5 Follow -up of Subjects  after Adverse Events 
The Investigator should follow all unresolved AEs/SAEs until the events are resolved or have stabilized, the subject is lost to follow -up, or it has been determined that the study treatment 
or participation is not the cause of the AE/SAE.  Resolution of AEs and SAEs (with dates) should be documented on the AE eCRF and in the subject’s medical record to facilitate source data verification.  
For some SAEs, the Sponsor may follow  up by [CONTACT_756], fax, electronic mail, and/or a 
monitoring visit to obtain additional case details (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458], consultant report, or autopsy report) deemed necessary to appropriately evaluate the SAE report.  
10.[ADDRESS_377898]  to report, to the 
Investigator and/or to BPV dire ctly, any subsequent SAEs that the subject’s personal 
physician(s) believes might be related to prior study treatment.  
The Investigator should notify the study Sponsor of any death or SAE occurring at any time 
after a subject has discontinued or terminated  study participation, if the Investigator believes 
that the death or SAE may have been related to prior study treatment. The Sponsor should also be notified if the Investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject who participated in 
this study.  
10.[ADDRESS_377899] the safety of subjects , and that the appropriate regulatory bodies should be 
notified according to their respective regulations. According to the European Union (EU) Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC, “ …in the light of the circumstances, notably the 
occurrence of any new event relating to the conduct of the trial or the development of the investigational medicinal product where that new event is likely to affect the safety of the subjects , the sponsor and the Investigator shall take appropriate urgent safety measures to 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377900]. The sponsor shall forthwith inform the 
competent authorities of those new events and the measures taken and shall ensure that the 
IRB/EC/ REB is notified at the same time.”  
The Sponsor is responsible for identifying, preparing and reporting all S[LOCATION_003]Rs to the relevant competent authorities, ethics committees and investigators in accordance with the requirements identified in the Clinical Trials Regulations.  
The reporting period for these events which may require the implementation of urgent safety measures is the period from the time of signing of the ICF through the completion of the last study visit or at the Early Termination Visit (ETV). Investigators are required to report any events which may require the implementation of urgent safety measures to BioMarin within 24 hours.  
Examples of situations that may require urgent safety measures include discovery of the following:  
• Immediate need to  revise the IP administration (eg, modified dose amount or frequency 
not defined in protocol)  
• Lack of study scientific value, or detrimental study conduct or management  
• Discovery that the quality or safety of the IP does not meet established safety 
require ments

13 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE 
BioMarin personnel or designees will visit the study site pri or to initiation of the study to 
review with the site personnel information about the IP, protocol and other regulatory 
document requirements, any applicable randomization procedures, source document requirements, eCRFs, monitoring requirements, and procedures for reporting AEs, including SAEs.  
At visits during and after the study, a CRA will monitor the site for compliance with regulatory documentation, with a focus on accurate and complete recording of data on eCRFs from source documents, adherence to pr otocol, randomization (if applicable), SAE reporting 
and drug accountability records.  
Sites will enter study data into eCRFs into the study EDC system.  Data Quality Control will be performed by [CONTACT_308546].  
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377915] 2018  
14 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATI ON OF SAMPLE SIZE  
14.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans  
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide additiona l details on the planned statistical 
analysis. Unless otherwise stated, all analyses will be performed using SAS v. 9.4.  
14.1.1 Interim Analyses  
An interim analysis will be carried out to support NDA/MAA filing. The report will be 
provided by a third party to ass ure that the study team, subjects, and investigators have no 
access to the individual subject treatment allocation.  
14.1.[ADDRESS_377916] current version of MedDRA will be used by [CONTACT_308547], based on the original terms entered on the CRF. 
All AEs will be coded using Me dDRA. The incidence of AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_29974], preferred term, relationship to study treatment (as assessed by [CONTACT_1697]), and 
severity. All AEs, including SAEs and AEs that lead to permanent discontinuation from the study and from  the study treatment, will be listed. Hypersensitivity reactions and 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377917], descriptive statistics will be provided on baseline as well as all subsequent visits.  
All other safety measures including laboratory tests, vital signs, ECG, echocardiogram, hip clinical assessment, and concomitant medication data will also be summarized descriptively. Data summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_1570] (when applicable) for each cohort and overall. All safety results will be liste d. 
14.3 Efficacy Analysis  
Efficacy analysis will be performed on the efficacy population as defined in Section 14.7.1. 
Efficacy endpoints include length/height AGV and l ength/height standard score (Z -score) at 
Week 52.  
For a given interval [Date1, Date2], the AGV is defined as follows:  
AGV = Length /standing  height  at Day  2− Length /standing  height  at Day  1
Interval  Length  (Days ) ×365.25  
 
where the interval length in days is  calculated as Date2 – Date1. AGV will be calculated for 
the following visits/intervals:  
• Baseline: [Date of last length/height measurement in study [ADDRESS_377918] 6 months prior 
to screening visit in study 206, Date of Day 1]  
• Week 13: [Date of Day 1, Date of  Week 13]  
• Week 26: [Date of Day 1, Date of Week 26]  
• Week 39: [Date of Day 1, Date of Week 39]  
• Week 52 (12- month): [Date of Day 1, Date of Week 52]  
The baseline of the AGV is established in the natural history study of Study111- 901, based 
on the standing height measurements in the last 6 months prior to enrollment to Study 
111-206. AGV will be summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, SD, median, minimum, 
and maximum). Results will be summarized by [CONTACT_308456] . 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377919] 2018  
The measurement of length /standing height will be converted to age -and sex -appropriate 
standard score (SDS), also referred to as Z -score, by [CONTACT_308548] (not ACH). The Z -score will be summarized similarly to growth velocity.  
Comparisons between treat ment groups by [CONTACT_308549]. Statistical comparisons will be considered descriptive. Additional details 
regarding efficacy analysis will be provided in the SAP.  
14.4 Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Subjects randomized to receive BMN  111  or placebo will undergo pharmacokinetic testing.  
For subjects randomized to BMN  111, PK parameters generated over the course of the study 
will be evaluated and summarized with descriptive statistical measures (mean, standard 
deviation, CV%, min, median and max). Correlative analyses of some of the PK parameters with efficacy, safety and immunogenicity measures may be conducted.  
14.5 Immunogenicity Analysis  
Immunogenicity will be summarized as change from baseline as well as by [CONTACT_308550] 111 or placebo.  Results will be summarized as incidence and titer for all cohorts. Additionally, immunogenicity may be assessed for correlations with measures of safety, PK, and efficacy.  
14.6 Determination of Sample Size  
Approximately 70 subjects age 0 to
 < [ADDRESS_377920] level and/or on a cohort level per the pre -specified stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]. Based on criteria 
outlined in the protocol, the DMC may also make endorsements for dose adjustments if needed.  
Please see D MC Charter for further details.  
 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377921] INJURY  
There will be no charge to study subjects to be in this study. BioMarin will pay all costs of 
tests, procedures, and treatments that are part of this study. In addition, after IRB/IEC/REB approval, BioMarin may reimburse the reasonable cost of travel for s tudy-related visits in 
accordance with BioMarin’s study -specific travel and reimbursement policy. BioMarin will 
not pay for any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], tests, or treatments for medical problems of any sort related solely to the study subject’s disease. Costs associated with such hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], tests, and treatments should be billed and collected in the way that such costs are usually billed and collected outside the study. 
The Investigator should contact [CONTACT_189584] a study subj ect 
has been injured by [CONTACT_141551]. 
Any subject who experiences a study -related injury should be instructed by [CONTACT_308551] a pre- specified medical institution i f possible, or at 
the closest medical treatment facility if necessary. The subject should be given the name [CONTACT_4007] a person to contact [CONTACT_187696], and assistance with, treatment for 
study- related injuries. The treating physician should bill the subject’s health insurance 
company or other third party payer for the cost of this medical treatment. If the cost of the 
medical treatment is not covered by [CONTACT_187697], then either BioMarin  or the institution may pay for reasonable and necessary 
medical services to treat the injuries caused by [CONTACT_191684]. In some 
jurisdictions, BioMarin is obligated by [CONTACT_44533]- related injuries without prior 
recourse to third party payer billing and/or regardless of fault. If this is the case, BioMarin will comply with the law.  
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377922] be completed using a validated web -based application. Study site personnel will 
be trained on the application and will enter the clinical data from source documentation. Unless explicit ly allowed in the eCRF instructions, blank data fields are not acceptable.  
In the event of an entry error, or if new information becomes available, the value will be corrected by [CONTACT_308552] l 
response. In compliance with 21 CFR Part  11, the system will require the personnel making 
the correction to enter a reason for changing the value. The documented audit trail will include the reason for the change, the original value, the new value, the t ime of the correction 
and the identity of the operator.  
BioMarin’s policy is that study data on the eCRFs must be verifiable to the source data, which necessitates access to all original recordings, laboratory reports, and subject records. In addition, all  source data should be attributable (signed and dated). The Investigator must 
therefore agree to allow direct access to all source data. Subjects (or their legally authorized representative) must also allow access to their medical records, and subjects wil l be informed 
of this and will confirm their agreement when giving informed consent. If direct source document verification of study data by [CONTACT_308553], then the Investigator must make available faci lities and/or personnel to allow 
GCP -compliant source verification to occur. Examples of such methods include certified 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_216406], or other GCP -compliant means agreed between the Investigator and the Sponsor . 
A CRA designated by [CONTACT_308554] “Source Data Verified” (SDV). If an error is disco vered at any time or a clarification is 
needed, the CRA, or designee, will create an electronic query on the associated field. Site personnel will then answer the query by [CONTACT_187701]. 
The CRA will then review the response and determine either to close the query or re–query 
the site if the response does not fully address the question. This process is repeated until all open queries have been answered and closed.  
Before a subject’s eCRF casebook can be locked, data fields must be source data verified and all queries closed. Refer to the Study Monitoring Plan for details on which fields must be source data verified.  The Investigator will then electronically sign the casebook, specifying 
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377923] 2018  
that the information on the eC RFs is accurate and complete. The Data Manager, or designee, 
will then set the status of the forms, visits, and the entire casebook to Locked. Upon 
completion of the CSR, an electronic copy of each site’s casebooks will be copi[INVESTIGATOR_99628] a compact disk (CD) and sent to each site for retention with other study documents.  
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377924] the monitors. The 
Investigator and staff are responsible for being present or available for consultation during routinely scheduled site visits conducted by [CONTACT_189478].  
Members of BioMarin’s GCP Compliance Department or designees may  conduct an audit of 
a clinical site at any time before, during, or after completion of the study. The Investigator will be informed if an audit is to take place and advised as to the scope of the audit. Representatives of the FDA or other Regulatory Agenc ies may also conduct an audit of the 
study. If informed of such an inspection, the Investigator should notify BioMarin immediately. The Investigator will ensure that the auditors have access to the clinical supplies, study site facilities, original source documentation, and all study files.  
 Study 111- 206A1 Page [ADDRESS_377925] notify BioMarin of any change 
in the location, disposition or custody of the study files. The Investigator /institution must take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of essential documents, that is,  
documents that individually and collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of a study and the quality of the data produced, including paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_44460] (e .g., subject charts) 
as well as any original source documents that are electronic as r equired by [CONTACT_44536].  
All study records must be retained for at least [ADDRESS_377926] approval of a marketing application in the US or an ICH region and until (1) there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in the U.S. or an ICH region or (2) at least [ADDRESS_377927] elapsed since 
the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the IP. The Investigator /institution should retain subject identifiers for at least [ADDRESS_377928] with retention should Investigator /institution be unable to continue 
maintenance of subject files for the full 15 years. It is the respo nsibility of BioMarin to 
inform the Investigator /institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.

CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT SUMMARY 
Amendment: 2  
Date: 08 February  2019 
RATIONALE AND SUMMARY OF MAJOR CHANGES  
The protocol has been amended to include the following changes: 
1.The following exploratory objectives have become secondary objectives in
Amendment  2. [§8.0]
•Evaluate the effect of BMN 111 on growth parameters and body proportions,including change from baseline in upper:lower segment ratio.
•Evaluate the effect of BMN  111 on sl eep apnea
•Evaluate the effect of BMN on skull and brain morphology, including foramenmagnum, ventricular and brain parenchymal dimensions
•Describe the incidence of surgical interventions, including cervical decompression,adenotonsellectomy, and typanostomy
Rationale : Because of the importance of clinical  and morbidity outcomes in 
achondrodroplasia (ACH), all outcome endpoints (with the exception of optional 
assessments) have been moved from exploratory to secondary.  
2.The secondary imaging assessment proce dures, excluding the MRI assessment,  have been
moved to the secondary s afety variable s section. The hip imaging assessment has been
removed, the X- ray assessment has been modified  to include long bone growth, and the
DXA assessment will no longer  include the forearm. Also, the paragraph discussing the
possibility of non- radiological methods of assessment for subjects in Cohort 3 has been
deleted. [§ [IP_ADDRESS]]
Rationale: Imaging assessments, excluding MRI, evaluate the safety of BMN -111 by 
[CONTACT_308563], morphologies, BMD, and BMC. The pelvis X- ray assessment 
has been removed to reduce the subjects’ radiation burden, because the femoral head is captured on X -rays of the lower extremities.  DXA of the forearm has also been removed. 
Thus, concerns regarding excess radiological exposure have been addressed.  
3.The MRI assessments remain as a subsection in the Secondary Efficacy Variables
section.  [9.11.2]
Rationale : MRIs evaluate the effect of BMN 111 on skull and brain morphology, an efficacy 
variable.  
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 3 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  8 February 2019  
4. The screening baseline hip assessment with pelvis X -ray has been removed from the 
Schedule of Events [Table 9.1.1]  
Rationale : Eliminating the pelvis X -rays at the screening visit will help  minimize the 
radiation burden on study subject.  
5. Footnot es have been changed to modif y procedures and  to add e arly termination visits  
(ETV) for anthropomorphic measurements, DXA, and X -rays [Table 9.1.1]  
Rationale:  The changes in ETV for have been made to  align 111- [ADDRESS_377989]  has been moved from §[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Outcome 
Assessments to  be a subsection of  §9.12.6 Safety Variables [§[IP_ADDRESS]] . A sentence 
specifying that the CBCL should be given prior to other study assessments was added. 
Rationale: The CBCL checklist addresses symptoms related to issues of safety (eg, sleep 
problems, aggressive behavior) rather than efficacy.  It is thought that the  answers to the 
CLCL, as a Patient Reported Outcome instrument, may be affected by [CONTACT_6078].  
7. The following sentence was added to §9.3.3 and §9.3.4 “After completing the observation 
period, s ubjects must fulfill the general eligibility criteria prior to receiving treatment 
with study drug.”  
Rationale : Cohort [ADDRESS_377990] also fulfil l the 
general eligibility criteria before receiving treatment.  
8. Mention of sterile diluent for reconstitution of BMN 111 has been deleted. [§[IP_ADDRESS]]  
Rationale : Only sterile water for injection is provided for reconstitution of drug produ ct. 
9. The s econdary efficacy variables were updated . [§9.12.3]  
Rationale : The secondary efficacy variables were updated to match the changes in secondary 
endpoints . 
10. Additions and corrections have been made to the PK parameters to be estimated by [CONTACT_105]-compart mental analysis. [§9.12.5]  
Rationale : Clarification th at PK parameters for both sentinels and study subjects will be 
analyzed, as well as the addition of C
max and T max to the PK parameters.  
11. Updates have been made §13 Data Quality Assurance and §17 Case Report Forms and Study Documents . 
Rationale : Language re quired in the current BioMarin protocol template was added.  
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 4 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  8 February 2019  
12. The identity of the medical monitor has been updated to George S. Jeha  [§10.8] . 
13. Administrative changes have been made throughout the amended protocol for 
consistency, accuracy, and clarity .

BMN [ADDRESS_377993] degradation by [CONTACT_308446], 
allowing for a longer half -life. 
The pharmacological activity of BMN 111 was explored in two mouse models of ACH, a severe, 
Fgfr3Y367C/+ (TD) model ( Lorget, 2012 ), and a milder [Ach] /+ (Ach) model. These included 
studies in 7 -day old TD mice given  BMN  111 daily by [CONTACT_308520] 20 days and a 
study in 3 -week old Ach mice given BMN 111 daily by [CONTACT_275269] 5  weeks. Partial or 
complete reversion of the ACH phenotype was ob served in these mouse models after BMN 111 
administration. In wild -type mice, and normal rats and mon keys, BMN 111 administration resulted 
in growth plate expansion and dose -dependent skeletal growth at hemodynamically tolerated dose 
levels ( Wendt,  2015). Additionally, the potential effect of age on BMN [ADDRESS_377994] severe 
complication, cervicomedullary compression (CMC), o ccurs in a subset of subjects with ACH due 
to abnormal endochondral bone growth and narrowing of the foramen magnum ( White, 2016 ). CMC 
has been linked to s erious respi[INVESTIGATOR_308391], apnea, 
ataxia, developmental d elay, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_308402] ( Mukherjee, 2014). 
Foramen magnum decompression surgery is currently the only treatment for this condition.   
Sleep apnea has also been extensively described in ACH, and sleep -disordered breathing m ay affect 
up to 85% of all children with ACH ( Ireland, 2012). This is thought to be due to midface 
hypoplasia, relative adenotonsillar hypertrophy, and pot ential posterior cranial fossa compression 
secondary to abnormal endochondral bone growth. Sleep apne a in ACH not only results in the need 
for surgical intervention, but has also been linked to sudden death in rare cases ( Pauli, 1984 ).   
Similarly, the dys regulation of endochondral bone growth in ACH leads to other medical 
complications which are prevalen t in this subject population, such as the following:

ranging from 40 to 55 minutes across dose levels. BMN 111 exposure (C max and AUC 0-t) generally 
increased greater than proportional to th e increase in dose across the 2.5 -to-15 µg/kg dose range. 
Exposure following multiple dosing was found to be similar to exposure following single doses, indicating no apparent accumulation or time -dependence with once -daily SC administration.  
Study 111- 202, the second clinical trial in humans and the first in children with ACH, is an ongoing 
Phase 2, open -label, sequential -cohort, dose -escalation study that assesses daily SC BMN 111 in 
pediatric subjects with ACH aged 5 -14 years with doses ranging from 2.5 µg/kg to 30 µg/kg. The 
primary objective of Study 111 -202 is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BMN 111 
administered for 6 months and up to 24 months; the secondary objectives are to determine change 
from baseline in annualized growth velocity (AGV ), growth parameters, body proportions, and 
evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BMN [ADDRESS_377997]:

Analysis of safety data from the 6 month initial phase of Study 111 -202 showed that treatment with 
BMN 111 for 6 months at the doses of 2.5, 7.5, 15, and 30 µg/kg was generally well tolerated (refer to current Investigator’s Brochure for specifi c details). One subject (30 µg/kg) in 111-[ADDRESS_377998] common AEs acro ss all cohorts were injection site reactions, asymptomatic hypotension, 
headache, and nasopharyngitis. Based on previous experience of the ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial, including the 24 month data cut at 15 µg/kg, injection site reactions have been ident ified as risks 
associated with BMN 111 injections. The majority of hypotension events were grade 1 and reported 
in the setting of routine BP measurement. A ll reported events of hypotension were transient and 
resolved without medical intervention. For a det ailed summary of risks, please refer to the current 
version of the Investigator’s Brochure supplied by [CONTACT_189447].  
Analysis of efficacy data from the 6 mont h initial phase of Study 111-202 showed that subjects 
treated with BMN 111 for 6 months at doses ranging from 2.5 15 µg/kg daily had a dose -dependent 
improvement in AGV, with ~50% improvement in AGV seen at the 15 µg/kg dose. The data from 
Cohort 4 (30 µg/ kg) show an apparent greater than dose -proportional increase in BMN 111 plasma 
exposure (C max and AUC 0-t), with a marginal improvement in both absolute AGV and change from 
baseline AGV after 6 months of BMN 111 treatment when compared with Cohort 3 (15  µg/kg).    
Study 111- 206 is a Phase 2 randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled clinical tria l of BMN 111 
in infants and younger children with a diagnosis of ACH who are 0 to < 60 months old. This 52-week study will enable assessment of BMN 111 efficacy an d safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics 
biomarkers, and PK in this population. Additional exploratory endpoints pertaining to medical complications of ACH will also be evaluated.   
Efficacy/toxicity studies have been conducted in neonatal and very young a nimals (7 day 
postpartum mouse and rat) in both a disease (TD mouse) and non-disease (rat) mo del. Given that 
this is the first study in infants and young children, an age based cohort study design is used to 
assess safety and PK in young children (Cohort 1, ≥ 24 to < 60 months) prior to dosing toddlers 
(Cohort 2, ≥ 6 to < 24 months) and infants (C ohort 3, 0 to < 6 months). PK will be monitored and 
evaluated; Day [ADDRESS_377999] of the cohort to target the observed exposure of the 15 µg/kg dose 
group in Study 111-202. Safety, efficacy and PK data from Study 111 -202, a Phase 2 study in 
children with ACH, where a dose of 15 µg/kg has been and continues to be studied, are expected to be the most relevant, and translatable to this study (111 -206).

As subjects age on study, they will be administered the dose determined to be appropriate for their 
current age.  For example, if a subject enrolls into Cohort 2 at age 20 months, they will receive the recommended dose for subjects aged ≥ 6 to  < 24 months until they turn 24 months in age.  When 
they turn 24 months in age, they will begin to receive the recommended dose for subjects 
aged 
 ≥ 24 to  < 60 months.  Duration of the study is 52 weeks of treatment with a safety follow up at 
Week 56. Following completion of the study, subjects in all treatment groups may be eligible to 
receive BMN 111 in an open -label extension study, to assess safety and efficacy of BMN 111 over 
the longer term; and to study the long-term outc omes on sustained growth, proportionality, bone 
maturation and medical comorbidities.  
For subjects enrolling into the extension study, safety follow up visit at Week 56 will be waived.  
Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)  
In addition to safety and PK monitori ng by [CONTACT_308448], an independent DMC will act as an

Dose Adjustments  
Analysis of available PK data from studies [ADDRESS_378019] body weight did not directly translate to differences in total body clearance of BMN 111.  
The same weight -based dose in the pediatric population of Study 111-202 (5-12 years old) yielded 
lower exposure (C max and AUC) than that characterized in  the adult population of Study 111- 101.  
Therefore, the same weight -based dose in the young pediatric population in this study may yield 
exposure less than the target exposure range characterized to be safe and effective in Study  111-202 
at the 15 µg/kg dose. Since this is the first experience with BMN 111 in this young pediatric population, it is also pos sible the exposure at 15 µg/kg could be greater than the target exposure 
range, and dose adjustment may be warranted. Thus, an option for adjustment of the weight -based 
dose is provided to ensure that the appropriate target exposure for safety and efficacy  is reached for 
the young subjects in this study.   
The need for dose adjustment will be evaluated as follows: three sentinel subjects in Cohort 1 will 
receive an initial dose of 15 µg/kg. After all three sentinel subjects reach Day 8, a review will occur 
to evaluate all available safety and PK data (at minimum). If the criteria for dose adjustment are 
met, the three sentinel subjects will be started on the new adjusted dose at their next scheduled visit, 
and vital signs will be obtained for at least [ADDRESS_378020] enrolls into Cohort 2 at age 20 months, they will receive the

Safety and Efficacy Monitoring  
Each treated subject will have expan ded outpatient safety monitoring for a minimum of [ADDRESS_378022] -dosing. Because younger children may not be able to 
verbali ze complaints of dizziness or lightheadedness that are potentially associated with 
hypotension, study personnel and caregivers will be trained to recogniz e the signs of hypotension in 
this population, which may include tachycardia, pallor, diaphoresis, lethargy, delayed capi[INVESTIGATOR_308425], and poor feeding. Appropriate rigorous training will be required for parents and caregivers 
prior to daily injections at home. Training includes the storage, reconstitution, and administration of 
BMN  111, as well as documen tation/reporting of AEs and vigilance for signs of hypotension.  
It is generally expected that after subjects are tolerating the drug well and specified cr iteria have 
been met, caregivers will begin administering study drug. Home health care is not required  at any 
point but may be provided if the caregiver is unable or unavailable to administer the study drug. A 
Home Healthcare nurse will train the caregiver (s) if training has not been completed by [CONTACT_48657] [ADDRESS_378023] can be made via email.   
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_51253], serious AE s (SAEs),  X-rays will be performed of 
the entire lower extremities and spi[INVESTIGATOR_308426] i n bone morphology and growth, 
laboratory test results (urinalysis, chemistry, and hematology), vital signs, physical examination, 
ECG and echocardiogram, hip clinical assessment, and anti -BMN 111 immunogenicity assessments.  
Clinical laboratory tests, PK, immunogenicity and blood biomarker assessments will be limited to 
the minimum necessary for evaluation of safety and efficacy in order to minimize blood volume in 
the pediatric population.  
Efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_308523]/height Z- score. Secondary 
assessments will include change from baseline in growth parameters and body proportions by 
[CONTACT_308454]. An MRI will be perfor med to assess the effect of BMN [ADDRESS_378024] -
certified, fellowship -trained (or equivalent) pediatric anesthesiologist will administer anesthesia 
during MRI measurements in the event that the subject is unable to remain still for the duration of 
the scan. Sleep studies will be conducted to evaluate sleep apnea. Additional assessments will be 
conducted to evaluate changes from baseline in bone metabolism an d BMN 111 pharmacodynamic 
biomarkers, and developmental/functional status.

STATISTICAL METHODS:  
Sample Size Determination:  
Approximately 70 subjects age  0 to < 60 months at study entry will participate in this study. No 
formal sample size calculations were performed. The number of subjects is considered appropriate 
to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BMN 111 in the target population.    
Safety Analysis : 
All AE s will be coded using the most current version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) to assign system organ class and preferred term classification to event and 
disease, based on the original terms entered on the eCRF. The incidence of AEs will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, relationship to study treatment as assessed by [CONTACT_1275], seriousness, and severity. All AEs, including SAEs and AEs that lead to permanent 
discontinuation from the study and from the stud y treatment, will be listed. 
All other safety measures including laboratory tests, vital signs, ECG, echocardiogram, hip clinical assessment, and concomitant medication data will also be summarized descriptively. Data 
summaries will be presented by  [CONTACT_1570] (when applicable) for each cohort and overall. All 
safety results will be listed.

7 INTRODUCTION  
BMN 111 is a proposed pharmacologic therapeutic option for achondroplasia  (ACH), the 
most common form of dwarfism.  
ACH is a rare di sease with a prevalence of 1/[ZIP_CODE] in the US ( Wynn, 2007)  The average 
adult heights for men and women with ACH are 131 cm and 124 cm, respectively 
(NIH,  Genetics Home Reference, 2012 ).  Characterist ic features include long and narrow 
trunk, a large head wi th frontal bossing, hypoplasia of the mid- face, bowed legs and stenosis 
of the foramen and spi[INVESTIGATOR_308363] -threatening. Foramen magnum stenosis can 
lead to cervicomedullary compressio n in infants with complications including hydrocephalus, 
hypotonia, respi[INVESTIGATOR_5448], apnea, cyanotic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], feeding problems, quadriparesis, and sudden death.  
There is no approved pharmacological therapy for achondroplasia in the United State s (US) 
or European Union (EU). Current treatments for achondroplasia are focused on neurosurgical interventions for foramen magnum stenosis or lumbar stenosis, thoracolumbar braces to help ameliorate the kyphosis, or limb lengthening requiring multiple ope rations over 2 to 3 years 
(Shirley,  2009), (Horton, 2007).   
ACH is caused by a gain -of-function mutation in fibroblast growth factor (FGF)R3, a 
negative regulator of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation.  The most common mutation (98%) in ACH patients is a G380R substitution in the transmembrane domain of 
FGFR3 (at position 380).  The majority of new cases (80%) originate from parents with 
normal stature.   
The extracellular signal- regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen- activated protein kinase (MAPK) 
pathway mediates part of FGFR3 inhibition of chondrocyte proli feration and differentiation 
(Foldynova -Trantirkova, 2012).  The ERK MAPK pathway is modulated by [CONTACT_308465], a positive 
regulator of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation.  Binding of C NP to the Natriuretic 
Peptide -Receptor B (NPR- B) antagonizes FGFR3 downstream signaling by [CONTACT_308466] (ERK1/2) pathway at the level of RAF -1 (Krejci, 2005); (Yasoda, 2004); 
(Yasoda,  2009); (Pejchalova, 2007).  This crosstalk was demonstrated in a mouse model of 
FGFR3 -related chondrodysplasia ( Yasoda, 2004); ( Yasoda , 2009).  The dwarfism phenotype 
of mice harboring the FGFR3G380R mutation was rescued by [CONTACT_308570] (infusion).  
CNP is a me mber of the natriuretic peptide (NP) family that includes Atrial Natr iuretic 
Peptide (ANP) and B -type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP). These peptides are structurally related 
but are distinct paracrine/autocrine (CNP) or endocrine (ANP and BNP) factors that regu late

the cardiovascular (CV), skeletal, nervous, reproductive and other systems. Synthetic analogs 
of ANP (anaritide and carperitide) and BNP (nesiritide) have been investigated as potential therapi[INVESTIGATOR_308365] -related 
diseases.  
BMN 111 is a 39 -amino acid CNP analogue harboring the 37 amino acids of the human 
CNP53 C- terminal sequence and modified by [CONTACT_308530] (Pro -Gly) on 
the N -terminus.  It is a recombinant human peptide fused to human transcription factor 
(TAF) and expressed as an inclusion body in E. coli.  BMN 111 is liberated and solubilized from the TAF -fusion protein by [CONTACT_308531], and purified by [CONTACT_308470] ( Long, 2012).  BMN 111 was designed to 1) m imic CNP activities in terms 
of receptor binding and pharmacological activity and 2) be resistant to neutral endopeptidase (NEP) digestion in order to have an extended half -life in comparison to CNP that is 
presumed to increase exposure to the target growt h plate ( Wendt, 2015).  
A comprehensive review of BMN 111 is containe d in the current version of the Investigator’s 
Brochure supplied by [CONTACT_189447].  Investigators are required to review the Investigator’s 
Brochure prior to initiating this study. 
7.1 Nonclinical Studies  
The pharmacological activity of BMN  111 was explored in two mouse models of ACH, a 
severe, Fgfr3Y367C/+ model ( Lorget, 2012), and a mild [Ach] /+ model.  Partial or complete 
reversion of the ACH phenotype was observed in these mouse models after 
BMN  111 
administration.  Additionally, in wild- type mice, and normal r ats and monkeys, BMN 111 
administration resulted in growth plate expansion and dose -dependent skeletal growth at 
hemodynamically tolerated dose levels ( Wendt, 2015).  
BMN 111- related adv erse findings in nonclinical species (mice, rats, cynomolgus monkeys) 
were limited to the known mechanism of action of CNP on the growth plate and vasculature.  
Reversible subcutaneous injection site reactions were reported, including injection site discol oration and microscopic findings of perivascular mononuclear cell infi ltrates that were 
seen with slightly higher incidence and severity in BMN 111- treated rats and monkeys 
compared to the vehicle control.  Adverse skeletal changes associated with exaggera ted 
growth were seen in normal nonclinical species with open growth pl ates, and were dose- , 
exposure - and time -dependent. Decreases in blood pressure and compensatory increases in 
heart rate were detected in monkeys across multiple studies, with overt CV -related clinical 
signs observed in some animals at doses ≥ 236 µg/kg. T hese overt clinical signs consisted of 
transient, short and repeated bouts of sternal or lateral recumbency and/or reduced motor 
 Study 111- 206A2 Page [ADDRESS_378060] -dose administratio n.  Additional detailed information 
about nonclinical studies of BMN 111 is provided in the current version of the Investigator’s 
Brochure supplied by [CONTACT_189447].   
7.2 Previous Clinical Studies  
7.2.1 Study 111 -101 
Study 111- 101, “A Phase 1, Two Part, Double Blind, Pl acebo -Controlled Study to Evaluate 
the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Single and Multiple Doses of BMN  111 
Administered to Healthy Adult Volunteers,” was a first- in-human study conducted in 2 parts 
to allow for assessment of the safety, tole rability, and PK of BMN 111 administered as a 
single dose and as a multiple dose to healthy adult male volunteers.  
Doses ranging from 5.0 µg/kg to 15.0 µg/kg were administered as a single subcutaneous (SC) dose; doses ranging from 0.5 µg/kg to 8.0 µg/kg we re administered daily in the multiple 
ascending dose segment of the study. As expected, mild, transient, self -limited hypotension 
occurred. The  majority of these cases were asymptomatic and observed upon assumption of 
an upright posture following recumbenc e. Hypotension events were reported in the BMN 111 
treatment groups with higher frequency compared with placebo. All events were judged to be mild in severity and resolved spontaneously without an intervention. These events occurred across dose ranges.  Du e to the limited number of events at each dose, it is unclear if 
symptomatic hypotension is dose related.  No dose limiting toxicities were identified outside of these cardiovascular events. The only adverse events (AEs) occurring in more than one 
subject receiving BMN  [ADDRESS_378061] AEs in the study were of mild severity, and no serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported. There were no AEs that led to premature discontinuation of study drug.   
The PK parameters for BMN [ADDRESS_378062] 
dose on Day 1 of the multiple dose study in Part 2. The results demonstrate that BMN 111 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_308366], reaching a mean time to peak concentration (T
max) between 
15-26 minutes. After reaching maximal plasma concentrations, BMN 111 levels rapi[INVESTIGATOR_308367], with a t 1/2 of 40- 55 minutes. Mean plasma concentration -time profiles indicate that 
exposure increased with dose from 2.5 to 15 µg/kg. The corresponding increases in plasma C
max and area under the curve (AUC) exposure parameters were greater than dose 
proportional. The increase in C max with dose was linear over the dose range evaluated.  In 
Part 2, with multiple dosing at 5 µg/k g for 10 days, the plasma concentration- time curves 
obtained on each of the three sampling days were nearly superimposable. Comparison of PK 
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 40 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  8 February 2019  
exposure parameters for AUC and C max indicate that C max is unchanged and AUC is 
increased slightly by +33% over Day 1. Overall, the results indicate that changes in 
BMN [ADDRESS_378063] 6 months 
of growth data are collected for Cohorts 1 and 2; and at least 3 months of data for Cohort 3.  
Data gathered from this study are used to characterize baseline growth data in children or infants (defined as children < 2 years of age) who may subsequently be enrolled in future studies sponsored by [CONTACT_189447], and may also be used to establish historical control cohort for use in other BioMarin- sponsored studies, when appropriate. For that reason, data related 
to ACH symptoms, tests, and interventions are collected.  
7.3.2 Study 111 -202 
Study 111- 202 is an ongoing Phase 2, open- label, sequential cohort, dose escalation study 
that assesses daily SC administration of BMN 111 in pediatric subjects with ACH. The primary objective of Study 111- 202 is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BMN 111 
administered for 6  months and up to 24 months; the secondar y objectives are to determine 
change from baseline in annualized growth velocity (AGV), growth parameters, body proportions, and evaluate the dose -exposure and PK profiles of BMN 111 in children with 
ACH.  
Analysis of safety data from the 6 -month initial p hase of Study 111- 202 showed that 
treatment with BMN 111 for 6 months at dose cohorts of 2.5, 7.5, 15, and 30 µg/kg (Cohorts  1 to 4, respectively) was generally well tolerated. The most common AEs were mild 
injection site reactions, asymptomatic hypotension, headache, and nasopharyngitis. For a detailed summary of risks, please refer to the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure supplied by [CONTACT_189447].  
Analysis of efficacy data from the 6 -month initial phase of Study 111- 202 demonstrated that 
the mean (standard deviation) change from baseline AGV when BMN 111 is administered at 
2.5, 7.5, 15, and 30 µg/kg subcutaneously daily for 6 months is -0.37 (1.592), 1.28 (1.439), 
2.01 (1.999), and 2.08 (2.137) cm/year, respectively.  Thus, a positive dose -dependent 
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 41 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  8 February 2019  
response was observed in change from baseline AGV at doses ranging from 2.5- 15 µg/kg 
daily.   
For longer term follow up data from the 202 study, please refer to the current Investigator 
Brochure supplied by [CONTACT_189447].  
7.3.3 Study 111 -205 
Study 111- 205 is an ongoing open- label, Phase 2 extension study to assess long- term safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy of BMN  111 in children with ACH. Subjects continue receiving the 
same stable dose of BMN 111 received upon completion of the 111- 202 study (up to 
30 µg/kg dai ly). This [ADDRESS_378064] completing 2 years of BMN 111 treatment in Study 111- 202 (7 years 
total B MN 111 treatment duration). Additional exploratory endpoints are being examined to 
determine long -term effects of BMN 111 on bone physiology and the medical complications 
of ACH.  
7.3.4 Study 111 -301 
Study 111- 301 is an ongoing Phase 3, double -blind, placebo -controlled multicenter study to 
further characterize and confirm efficacy and safety of BMN 111 at 15 µg/kg in a 58 -week 
study (up to 4 weeks of screening, 52 weeks of treatment, plus an additional 2 weeks of safety follow up). The study assesses the effect of  daily BMN 111 administration on change 
from baseline in AGV, height, and body proportions in subjects treated with BMN 111 
compared with control subjects in the placebo group; and further characterizes safety and 
tolerability of BMN [ADDRESS_378065] of BMN 111 on bone physiology and to assess quality of life and daily function of study subjects.  
7.3.5 Study 111 -302 
Study 111- 302 is an open- label Phase 3 extension study to furthe r evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of BMN 111 either until subjects reach near -final adult height (defined as evidence of 
growth plate closure and <  1.5 cm/yr annualized growth velocity), or for 5 years if near -final 
adult height (NFAH) occurs prior to the  end of the 5- year period.  All subjects will receive 
BMN 111 15 µg/kg. This study will allow for long- term assessment of the effect of daily 
BMN [ADDRESS_378066] degradation by 
[CONTACT_308446], allowing for a longer half -life. 
The pharmacological activity of BMN 111 was explored in two mouse models of ACH, a severe, Fgfr3Y367C/+ (TD) model ( Lorget, 2012), and a milder [Ach] /+ (Ach) model. These 
included studies in 7 -day old TD mice given BMN 111 daily by [CONTACT_308520] 
20 days and a study in 3 week old Ach m ice given BMN 111 daily by [CONTACT_275269] 
5 weeks. Partial or complete reversion of the ACH phenotype was observed in these mouse models after BMN 111 administration. In wild -type mice, and normal rats and monkeys, 
BMN 111 administration res ulted in  growth plate expansion and dose -dependent skeletal 
growth at hemodynamically tolerated dose levels ( Wendt, 2015). Additionally, the potential 
effect of age on BMN [ADDRESS_378067] 
severe complication, cervicomedullary compression (CMC), occurs in a subset of subjects 
with ACH du e to abnormal endochondral bone growth and narrowing of the foramen 
magnum ( White, 2016 ). CMC has been linked to serious respi[INVESTIGATOR_308368], apnea, ataxia, developmental delay, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_308429] w ith sudden death ( Mukherjee, 2014 ). Foramen magnum decompression surgery 
is currently the only treatment for this condition.   
Sleep apnea has also been extensively described in ACH, and sleep -disordered breathing may 
affect up to 85% of all childr en with ACH ( Ireland, 2012). This is thought to be due to 
midface hypoplasia, relative adenotonsillar hypertrophy, and potential posterior cranial fossa compression secondary to abnormal endochondral bone growth. Sleep apnea in ACH not only results in the need for  surgical intervention, but has also been linked to sudden death in 
rare cases ( Pauli, 1984 ).   
Similarly, the dysregulation of endochondral bone growth in ACH leads to other medical 
complications which are prevalent in this subject population, suc h as the  following:  
• Spi[INVESTIGATOR_16078], kyphosis, and lordosis (secondary to altered growth plate ossification 
in the vertebrae and narrowing of the interpedicular distances) ( Shirley, 2009)  
• Developmental delay of gross motor and ambulatory skills (associated with pr oximal 
limb shortening, macrocephaly, and hypotonia) ( Ireland, 2010)  
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 43 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  8 February 2019  
• Delayed functional skills and increased need for caregiver assistance (eg, eating, 
bladder management, bowel management, transfer to chair, climbing stairs) (Ireland,  2011)  
Thus, BMN 111 may provide greater benefit when children begin treatment at a younger age, 
as earlier initiation of treatment allows a longer time window to improve growth and potential to improve medical complications of achondroplasia. This study (111- 206) is being 
conducted to assess safety and the potential benefit of BMN 111 in infants and young children.   
BioMarin has engineered a CNP analog (BMN 111) that has a longer half -life than 
endogenous CNP, thereby [CONTACT_308472]. Similar to CNP, BMN 111  
activates NPR -B signaling with subsequent inhibition of FGFR3 downstream signaling, 
leading to the promotion of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation and subsequent increased endochondral bone formation. BMN 111 administration has been show n to 
promote endochondral bone formation at hemodynamically tolerated dose levels in both normal animals and mouse models of ACH reported (refer to current Investigator’s Brochure for additional information).  
Human studies to date have also demonstrated th at BMN  111 is generally well tolerated at 
doses that result in improvements in growth velocity approaching that of children of average stature ( Section  7.3).  
Study 111- 206 is a Phase 2 randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled clinical trial of 
BMN 111 in infants and younger children with a diagnosis of ACH who are age 0 to < [ADDRESS_378068] on efficacy endpoints. Additional exploratory endpoints pertaining to medical complications of ACH will also be evaluated.  
7.5 Summary of Overall Risks and Benefits  
7.5.1 Summary of Risks from Nonclinical Studies  
Individuals in this study will be exposed to a recombinant analogue of human C -type 
natriuretic peptide (CNP). Based on the results of experimentation in animals, the most relevant potent ial toxicities relate to the expected pharmacological effects of exogeno us CNP 
administration, including hemodynamic changes, skeletal overgrowth, and injection site reactions. Transient and sporadic decreases in blood pressure and compensating increases i n 
heart rate occurred within the first hour post -dose in cynomolgus monkeys; the effects were 
mainly asymptomatic with a subset of animals given doses ≥ 236 µg/kg observed with 
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 44 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  8 February 2019  
symptomatic effects consisting of transient, short and repeated bouts of sterna l or lateral 
recumbency and/or reduced motor activity. These hemodynamic  effects can be monitored, 
but have the potential to be an acute dose -limiting factor in patients. Exaggerated 
appendicular bone responses to the drug included abnormally shaped femora l head, 
acetabular growth center/plate dysplasia and concomitant articul ar cartilage degeneration 
with clinical manifestations of restricted use of hips. Adverse skeletal changes associated 
with exaggerated growth were dose -, exposure - and time -dependent. Additional detailed 
information about risks identified in nonclinical st udies of BMN 111 is provided in the 
current version of the Investigator’s Brochure supplied by [CONTACT_189447].

Study 111- 101, BMN 111 administered SC daily was well tolerated with doses ranging from 
0.5 µg/kg to 15 µg/kg. All AEs were of mild severity, and no SAEs were repor ted. The most 
common AE was mild, transient, self -limited orthostatic hypotension, of which the majority 
of cases were asymptomatic and observed only upon assumption of an upright posture following recumbence. No dose -limiting toxicities were identified ou tside of these CV

9 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a Phase 2 randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled clinical trial of BMN  111 in 
infants and younger children with a diagnosis of ACH.  
Subjects age ≥ 6 months to < [ADDRESS_378073] documented ACH confirmed by 
[CONTACT_308571]; at least a 6 -month period of pretreatment growth assessment in Study 
111-901 immediately before study entry; and who meet the study eligibility criteria, will 
participate. Eligible subjects ranging from 0 months to < [ADDRESS_378074] population. Within Cohorts 1 and 2, subjects will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_654]:  
• Cohort 1 – children aged  ≥ 24 to <  60 months (n ≥  30 total: [ADDRESS_378075] 27 additional subjects randomized 1:1 to treatment or 
placebo control), stratified by [CONTACT_654] (≥ 24 to < 36 months and ≥  36 months to 
< 60 months)   
• Cohort 2 – children aged   ≥  6 to   <  24 months (n ≥  20 total: [ADDRESS_378076] 17 additional subjects randomized 1:1 to treatment or 
placebo control), stratified by [CONTACT_654] (≥  6 months to <  15 months and ≥  15 months to 
< 24 months)  
• Cohort 3 – children age d 0 to  < 6 months (n ≥  20 total: [ADDRESS_378077] 17 additional subjects randomized 1:1 to treatment or placebo control).  Treatment begins at  ≥ 3 months to <  6 months after 3 months of 
observation.  
If subjects who enroll in Cohort 3 are not able to begin treatment by
 < 6 months of age, they 
will continue in the pretreatment period for another 3 months before enrolling in Cohort 2 to 
fulfill the pretreatment requirement for Cohort 2.

Sentinel subjects from each cohort will be enrolled, treated with BMN 111, and studied for 
short -term safety and PK data. No two sentinel subjects will be dosed on the same day for 
any cohort. After the sentinel data are evaluated, additional recruited sub jects will be 
randomized to receive BMN 111 or placebo SC daily (1:1 ratio) for [ADDRESS_378078] of the cohort, and will be the starting dose for the younger cohort sentinel subjects.  Upon review of the clinical and PK data, the remainder of Cohort 1 (≥  27 additional subjects) will be enrolled and randomized to treatment with BMN 
111 or placebo (1:1 ratio).  After the sentinel subjects complete 12 weeks of dosing, a data monitoring committ ee (DMC) review will occur to evaluate all available safety and PK data.  
Upon approval by [CONTACT_1363], the next younger cohort (Cohort  2) will be opened and the [ADDRESS_378079] of the cohort, and will be  the starting dose for the younger cohort sentinel subjects.  
Upon review of the clinical and PK data, the remainder of Cohort 2 (≥  17 additional subjects) 
will be enrolled and randomized to treatment with BMN 111 or placebo (1:1 ratio). After the 
sentinel  subjects complete [ADDRESS_378080] cohort (Cohort 3) 
will be opened and the [ADDRESS_378081] of the cohort, and will be the starting dose for the younger cohort sentinel subjects.

≥ 24 to < [ADDRESS_378084] -dosing. Because younger children 
may not be able to verbalize complaints of dizzine ss or lightheadedness that are potentially 
associated with hypotension, study personnel and caregivers will be trained to recognize the signs of hypotension in this population, which may include tachycardia, pallor, diaphoresis, lethargy, delayed capi[INVESTIGATOR_39093], and poor feeding. Appropriate rigorous training will be required for parents and caregivers prior to daily injections at home. Training includes the storage, reconstitution, and administration of BMN 111, as well as documentation/reporting of AEs and vigilance for signs of hypotension.  
It is generally expected that after subjects are tolerating the drug well and specified criteria have been met, caregivers will begin administering study drug. Home health care is not required at any point but may be  provided if the caregiver is unable or unavailable to 
administer the study drug. A Home Healthcare nurse will train the caregiver(s) if training has not been completed by [CONTACT_48657] [ADDRESS_378085] can be made via email.   
Duration of the study is 52 weeks of treatment with a safety follow up at Week 56. Following completion of the study, subjects in all treatments groups may be eligible to receive BMN 111 in an open- label extension study, to assess safety and efficacy of BMN 111 over 
the longer term.  For subjects enrolling into the extension study, safety follow up visit at 
Week  56 will be waived.

Home health visit  Home health visit is not required at any point but may be provided if the caregiver is unable or 
unavailable to administer the stu dy drug.  
a Clinic visits (except Days 1, 2, 3, and 8) have a ±  7-day window.  Anthropometric measurement and imaging assessments can be conducted either pre -dose 
or post -dose.  
b If the [ADDRESS_378087] enters Study 111 -206 and the 111- 206 Screening visit are on the same day, the procedures common to both visits 
will be performed one time only.  All blood tests at Screening visit should be obtained between Day  − 30 and Day  − 14. 
c Medical history, including growth history and ACH- related history, should elicit all major illnesses, diagnoses, and surgeries that the subject has ever had; 
any prior or existing  medical conditions that might interfere with study participation or safety.  
d Standing height of the participant’s biological parents may be assessed.  Prior to the measurement being taken, each parent is required to complete an ICF 
specific to parent heigh t assessment.  The ICF will be signed prior to the assessment, which can be done at any point in the study.  If biological parent is not 
available during the course of the study to take their standing height, the parent can provide their stated height instead if consent has been given.  
e If subjects had previous genetic testing, subjects must have a lab certification documenting the specific mutation required for the 111- 206 study, including 
the identification of FGFR3 mutation (G346E, G375C, G380R, or “other ”). 
f Complete physical exam includes major body systems, including assessment of general appearance; CV; dermatologic; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; lymphatic; respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]; gastrointestinal (GI); musculoskeletal; and neurological/psychological and ge nitourinary.  
g All treatment visits have pre -dose vital sig n assessments.  Vital signs at pre -dose include: body temperature in degrees Celsius (°C), heart rate, BP, and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697].  Post -dose measurements include heart rate, BP, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697].  
Study 111- 206A2 Page [ADDRESS_378088]’s vital signs are taken, preferably in sitting or supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].  Vital sign measurements should be re peated

Subsequent dosing visits  q 15 min (± 5 min);  
final assessment prior to end of visit 
(if longer than 1 hr) 
1. Vital sign measurements are taken once per time point, preferably in a sitting or supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], after at least [ADDRESS_378090] has a hypotensive event, or signs potentially consistent with hypotension, or a decrease of 20 mm Hg systolic BP or more from baseline (defined by [CONTACT_094] -dose
vitals collected that day), vital signs should be measured and recorded approximately every 15 minutes (± 5  minutes) for the first  hour and every 30 minutes (± 5 minutes)
thereafter until the BP returns to baseline (or within the normal range for this subject as defined by [CONTACT_976]) and signs (if present) resolve.
7. If the decision is made to adjust the dose, vital signs will be obtained for at least [ADDRESS_378091]-
dose on study day visits at which a dose is given; in addition, on Day 1, ECGs will be performed pre -dose.  On days when PK samples are being drawn, 
ECGs should be performed within a 5 -minute window prior  to 30- minute PK assessment.  
i Echocardio gram is obtained at the early termination visit only if the previous assessment was done more than 3 months prior to early te rmination.  
j Growth measures may be collected in triplicate approximately the same time each day (± [ADDRESS_378092] measurement assessment was 
taken at Screening). Measurements may include but are not limited to length, standing height (if able to stand unsupported), crown -to-rump length, head 
circumference, upper and lower arm and leg, and arm span. Measurements not taken in the midsagittal plane should be taken on the right side of the body if 
possible and should always be taken on the same side of the body throughout the study. Anthropometric measurement s will be taken at the ETV  only if 
subject discontinues after Week 6 and if > [ADDRESS_378093] elapsed since the previous assessment.  
Study 111- 206A2 Page 54

k Clinical labs (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) are all pre -dose draws/samples and can be collected anytime during the visit if there is no dru g 
administration.  
l Plasma samples will be collected pre -dose and at 5 (± 2 min), 15 (± 2 min), 30 (± 5 min), 45 (± 5 min), 60 (± 5 min), 90 (± 5 min), and 120 (± 5 min) 
minutes post -dose. On Day 1, additional PK samples will be collected at 180 (± 5 min) an d 240 (± 5 min) minutes. Samples with v olume remaining after 
pharmacokinetic assessment will be used for cGMP pharmacodynamics assessment. NOTE: In the event of interruption of study dru g administration for a 
sentinel patient on Day 1 when PK samples are scheduled, the collection of PK samples should be delayed until the subsequent day and only performed after 
successful administration of study drug has been completed in a single injection.  
m Antibodies:  Total anti -BMN 111 (TAb), TAb cross -reacting with endo genous natriuretic peptides, and neutra lizing antibody (NAb) samples (serum) will be 
drawn pre -dose at each time point listed on the SOE. TAb cross -reacting with endogenous natriuretic peptides and NAb testing will be performed only on 
baseline and TAb pos itive samples from subjects weighing ≥  7.0 kg and waived for subjects < 7.0 kg. Drug -specific IgE will be drawn pre -dose on Day 1 for 
subjects weighing  ≥ 7.0 kg and waived for subjects < 7.0 kg to stay within the limits of permitted blood volume collections in infants. Total immunoglobulin 
E (IgE) and drug -specific IgE will be drawn in the event of Grade 3 hypersensitivity adverse event) or at Investigator or Sponsor discretion. If such an event 
occurs, the drug -specific IgE sample should be drawn at least [ADDRESS_378094] s weighing <  7.[ADDRESS_378095] subjects at this visit. Serum samples for bone metabolism 
biomarkers will be collected pre -dose on the indicated visits. Bone metabolism blood biomarkers includ e bone -specific alkaline phosphata se and collagen 
type X. 
oU rine biomarkers and urine chemistry (urine creatinine test) should be obtained pre - and post -dose (approximately 2 -4 hours after study drug administration)
for subjects when possible at the indicat ed visits. The time of collection will be recorded. Urine biomarkers include cGMP and C -terminal telopeptide of
cross -linked collagen type II (CTX -II).
p Hip monitoring: this assessment will include medical history of the hip and physical exam to determine c hanges in hip function or pain wit h hip range of 
motion. Adverse changes from baseline will trigger further evaluation.  
q MRI is obtained at the early termination visit only if the previous assessment was done more than 3 months prior to early ter mination (u nless additional 
study is recommended by [CONTACT_10670], BioMarin, or DMC). Efforts to obtain a satisfactory image can be discontinued after [ADDRESS_378096] may need to repeat assessment.  Obtained at the  early termination visit only if the previous assessment was done 
more than 3 months prior to early termination (unless additional study is recommended by [CONTACT_10670], BioMarin, or DMC).  
s Wee- FIM is waived for children < 6 months old; CBCL is waived for ch ildren  < [ADDRESS_378097] discontin ues after 9

Study 111- 206A2 Page [ADDRESS_378102] body weight did not directly translate to differences in total body clearance of 
BMN 111.  The same weight-based dose in the pediatric population of Study 111-202 
(5-12 years old) yielded lower exposure (C max and AUC) than that characterized in the adult 
population of Study 111-101.  Therefore, the same weight-based dose in the young pediatric population in this study may yield exposure less than the target exposure range characterized to be safe and effective in Study 111-202 at the 15 µg/kg dose. Since this is the first experience with BMN 111 in this young pediatric population, it is also possible the exposure at 15 µg/kg could be greater than the target exposure range, and dose adjustment may be warranted. Thus, an option for adjustment of the weight-based dose is provided to ensure that the appropriate target exposure for safety and efficacy is reached for the young subjects in this study.   
The need for dose adjustment will be evaluated as follows: three s entinel subjects in Cohort 1 
will receive an initial dose of 15 µg/kg. After all three sentinel subjects reach Day 8, the 
Sponsor will review and evaluate all available safety and PK data (at minimum). If the criteria for dose adjustment are met, the three sentinel subjects will be started on the new adjusted dose at their next scheduled visit, and vital signs will be obtained for at least [ADDRESS_378103] enr olls into Cohort 2 at age 20 months, they will 
receive the recommended dose for subjects aged 
≥ 6 to  < 24 months until they turn 24 months 
in age.  When they turn 24 months in age, they will begin to receive the recommended dose for subjects aged 
≥ 24 to < 60 months. 
Criteria for Dose Adjustment  
The criteria for dose adjustment are based on obtaining equivalent exposure characterized to be safe and effective with the 15 µg/kg dose in Study 111-202 in each of the age cohorts evaluated in this study. BMN 111 dose may be adjusted if the mean observed AUC
0-120 from

Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
sentinel subjects is less than the 25th percentile for AUC 0-120 in Cohort 3 (15 μg/kg) of Study 
111-[ADDRESS_378104] body weight will 
be determined using a population PK  modelling approach and available data from this study 
and Studies 111- 202 and 111- 101. The recommended adjusted dose will be determined using 
the following expression:  
  
where WT ref and Dose ref are the typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] (i.e., median) subject body weight and total  dose, 
respectively, at the 15 μg/kg dose level in Cohort 3 of Study 111- 202, and WT ch is the 
anticipated median weight in the age cohort being studied. As such, the recommended adjusted dose will target the median AUC
0-120 observed at the 15 μg/kg dose le vel of Study 
111-202. The recomm ended adjusted dose, Dose ch, will be nor malized by [CONTACT_308475], to provide 
the recommended adjusted weight -based dose. The following rules will be used for dose 
adjustment:  
• A maximum of a 2 -fold increase in dose/kg will be permitte d between dose 
adjustments regardless of exposure.  
• The total dose will n ot exceed the highest total dose administered in Study 111- 202.

9.3.6 Removal of Subjects from Treatment or Assessment  
Subjects (or their legally authorized representative) may withdraw their consent to participate 
in the study at any time without prejudice. The I nvestigator must withdraw from the study 
any subject who reques ts to be withdrawn. A subject’s participation in the study may be 
discontinued at any time at the discretion of the Investigator and in accordance with his/her clinical judgment. When possible, the tests and evaluations listed for the termination visit 
should be carried out.  BioMarin must be notified of all subject withdrawals as soon as possible.  
Investigators may discontinue administration of BMN  [ADDRESS_378119] from study treatment include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 Study 111- 206A2 Page [ADDRESS_378120] (or the subject’s legally authorized  representative, if appropriate) 
requesting contact [CONTACT_31387]. This information should be recorded in the study 
records.  
The Investigator or designee must  explain to each subject, before enrollment into the study, 
that for evaluation of study results, the subject’s protected health information obtained during 
the study may be shared with the study sponsor, regulatory agencies, and IRB/IEC/REB. It is the Investigator’s (or designee’s) responsibility to obtain written permission to use protected health information per country- specific regulations, such as HI PAA in the US, from each 
subject, or if appropriate, the subject’s legally authorized representative. If permission to use protected health information is withdrawn, it is the Investigator’s re sponsibility to obtain a 
written request, to ensure that no fur ther data will be collected from the subject and the 
subject will be removed from the study. 
It is a priority of the study to maximize study subject retention and adherence to 
study- specific pr ocedures. The completeness of the study data may affect the integrity and 
accuracy of the study results.  Therefore, subjects who discontinue study treatment should be 
encouraged to continue to undergo as many of the protocol -specified procedures and 
assessments as possible for the remainder of the study, as long as such continued 
participation does not detrimentally affect the health, safety, or welfare of the subject, and 
consent remains in place. It is important that following treatment discon tinuation t he original 
visit schedule is strictly adhered to.  
For subjects who discontinue BMN  111 or placebo but remain in the study, PK and 
BMN 111 activity assessments will be waived completely; vital signs and clinical 
labs/biomarkers will be obtained  only once at each visit subsequent to BMN  [ADDRESS_378121] has 
discontinued dosing and vital sign and clinical lab/biomarkers assessments previously 
designated as “post -dose” wil l be waived.  All other assessments at each visit should be 
completed if possible and the subject is willing.  Data from the study procedures and assessments may be used to further characterize the natural progression of ACH.

9.4 Treatments  
9.4.1 Treatments Administered  
BioMarin and/or its designee will provide the study site with a supply of IP sufficient for the 
completion of the study.  
Sentinel subjects will receive BMN 111 at a daily dose of 15  µg/kg (subject to adjustment 
per protocol). Subjects will be randomized to BM N 111 or placebo at a daily dose of 
15 µg/kg (subject to adjustment per protocol) for the duration of the study. The normal 
dosing schedule is a single daily subcutaneous injection given [ADDRESS_378124] etion (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) 
has not completely resolved prior to the first dose of BMN  111 or placebo, the dosing will be 
delayed until hydration status has improved (up to the maximum period allowe d for the visit 
window). [IP_ADDRESS] Study Drug Administr ation  
During the study, BMN 111 or placebo will be administered as a single 15 µg/kg SC 
injection given daily at approximately the same time each day whenever possible. The same 
injection site should not be used 2 days in a row, and sites should be rotated . Study drug 
should be administered at age -appropriate locations (upper thigh, upper back of arm, 
abdomen or buttocks). Determination of appropriate injection sites will be left to the 
discretion of the investig ator. Doses may be administered in any of the  common SC areas 
(upper arm, thigh, abdomen, buttocks).  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Observation Period  
Following administration of each dose at clinic visits, subjects should be observed for 8 hours after the injection on Days 1 and 2; 4 hours on Days 3 and 8; and 1 hour on subsequent dosing visits. Subjects should be observed for 30 minutes after every injection that is not administered at the clinic.  Instructions for home administration of BMN  111 or 
placebo for subjects who qualify for parent/caregiver administration are provided in the 
Study Drug Injection Guide and Injection media .

The amino acid sequence is an analogue of the naturally occurring tissue -expressed form of 
C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP -53). B MN 111  is a recombinant 39 amino acid peptide that 
inclu des the 37 C -terminal amino acids of the human CNP -53 sequence, and is engineered to 
include two additional amino acids (Pro- Gly) on the N -terminus, which renders the peptide 
more resistant to degrada tion. It is a cyclic peptide formed by [CONTACT_308577]. The molecular weight of the purified product is 4.1 kDa. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Product Characteristics and Labeling  
The clinical drug product will be supplied in sterile, single -dose, Type I glass vials wi th

Refer to the Study Drug Injection Guide for complete BMN  111 or placebo preparation 
instructions.  
The injection will be administered as a daily dose of BMN  111  15 µg/kg or placebo given as 
a single subcut aneous injection. The dose should be given at approximately the same time 
every day whenever possible.  Following administration of each dose at clinic visits, subjects

Caregivers will administer BMN  111 or placebo at home once approved by [CONTACT_308537]. Instructions on how to complete and document the training can be found in the Study Reference Manual.   
A caregiver will be eligible  to administer BMN  111 or placebo if he or she meets all of the 
following criteria:  
• The subject has been on a stable dosing regimen for a minimum of 3 days  
• PI [INVESTIGATOR_308379] 111 or placebo by [CONTACT_18629]  
• The caregiver has completed t he Administration Training conducted by [CONTACT_308578] i njections safely

9.4.5 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
Subjects will be randomized using an interactive voice/response system (IXRS) in a 1:1 ratio, 
i.e., injection with placebo:15 µg/kg of BMN  111.  An independent third -party vendor will 
develop the randomization schedule so that BioMarin and site personnel are blinded to 
treatment assignments.  NOTE: In Japan, subjects are randomized separately within each cohort.

ongoing Phase 2, open- label, sequential -cohort, dose -escalation study that assesses daily SC 
BMN 111 in pediatric subjects with ACH aged 5 -14 years with doses ranging f rom 2.5 µg/kg 
to 30 µg/kg.  
Analysis of safety data from the 6 -month initial phase of Study 111- 202 showed that 
treatment with BMN 111 for 6 months at the doses of 2.5, 7.5, 15, and 30 µg/kg was 
generally well tolerated. The most common AEs across all cohorts were injection site reactions, asymptomatic hypotension, headache , and nasopharyngitis. Based on previous 
experience of the ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial, including the 24- month data cut at 15 µg/kg, 
injection site reactions have been identified as risks associated with BMN 111 injections. For a detailed summary of ris ks, please refer to the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure 
supplied by [CONTACT_189447].  
Analysis of efficacy data from the [ADDRESS_378131] s treated with BMN 111 for 6 months at doses ranging from 2.5 to 15 µ g/kg daily had 
a dose -dependent improvement in AGV, with ~50% improvement in AGV seen at the 
15 µg/kg dose. The data from Cohort 4 (30 µg/kg) show an apparent greater than dose -
proportional increase in BMN 111 plasma exposure (C
max and AUC 0-t), with a marginal 
improvement in both absolute AGV and change from baseline AGV after 6 months of BMN 111 treatment when compared with Cohort 3 (15 µg/kg). 
Efficacy/toxicity studies have been conducte d in neonatal and very young animals (7- day 
postpartum mouse and rat) in both a disease (TD mouse) and non- disease (rat) model. 
Given  that this is the first study in infants and young children, an age -based cohort study 
design is used to assess safety and PK in young children (Cohort 1, ≥ 24 to < 60 months) 
prior to dos ing toddlers (Cohort 2, ≥ 6 to < 24 months) and infants (Cohort 3, 
0 to 
 <  6 months). PK will be monitored and evaluated; Day [ADDRESS_378132] of the co hort to target the observed exposure of the 15- µg/kg dose group in Study 111- 202.

members will be blinded to the two study treatments (15 µg/kg BMN 111 or  placebo). The 
investigator and other members of staff involved w ith the study will remain blinded to the 
treatment randomization code during the assembly procedure. In the event of an emergency medical situation where subject management would be determined or significantly altered by [CONTACT_308579], t he investigator may be unblinded without prior written 
approval from the Medical Monitor.  Following such an emergency unblinding, the investigator will contact [CONTACT_308580] e written rationale according to the 
unscheduled unblinding proce dure set forth in the Study Manual.  The  Medical Monitor will 
review the rationale, evaluate whether there are any additional safety considerations that need to be implemented for the subject  and/or the study, and determine whether the investigator 
require s further guidance on unblinding.  The Medical Monitor may also communicate with 
the investigator advice on the care of the subject and define the plan for the subject’s future

of sleep -disordered breathing by [CONTACT_308488], pulse rate, and 
airflow during overnight monitoring. Assessment of epi[INVESTIGATOR_308409], but may not be limited to, the number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_308410] (Apnea/Hypopnea Index).   
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Outcome Assessments  
Clinical out come assessments will be  administered t o asse ss the HRQoL  of study subjects. 
Functional I ndependence will be assessed.   Clinical out come assessments will be  performed 
at the time points indicated in the Schedules of Events (Table 9.1.1 and  Table 9.1.2) and the 
ITQoL  shoul d be administered p rior t o any  other assessments.   The  Wee-FIM and the 
Bayley-I II may be administered at any point deemed convenient during the visit. The age 
ranges for clin ical outcome assessment tools are shown in Figure [IP_ADDRESS].1.  The clinical 
outcome assessments are not  to be considered as source data for  AEs.

[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_378144]/child. 
The time required varies from 15 -60 minutes depending on the child’s developmental level 
and cooperation.  
Scales include Cog nitive subscale, Receptive and Expressive subscales, and Gross and Fine 
Motor subscales. The two language scales make up  a composite Language Scale score and 
the Gross and Fine Motor subscales yield a composite Motor Scale score.  
The scales have clinical and research utility as a diagnostic assessment for young children 
with varied disorders and disabilities, and reflect c urrent professional standards for early 
childhood assessment ( Bayley, 2006).  
In addition to its use for subjects ranging from 1 to 42 months old, the Bayley- III assessment 
will be administered to those entering the study between 42 and 60 months old (Figure [IP_ADDRESS].1) and for the remainder of the duration of this study, as this assessment can 
capture ongoing developmental issues associated with Achondroplasia.  Bayley -III is waived 
for subjects 
 < 1 month old. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Functional Independence Measure (Wee- FIM)  
The Wee- FIM instrument is an assessment tool that measures functional performance across 
three domains (self -care, mobility and cognition) ( Ireland,  2011; Ireland, 2012).  
The Wee-FIM instrument has been used in previous research in children with ACH, and has identified ongoing limitations in functional performance across these domains extending 

 Study 111- 206A2 Page 79 
 
Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
beyond the age of 7 yea rs (Ireland, 2011).  Because the Wee- FIM considers the child’s 
performance from a caregiver’s perspect ive (Ireland, 2012),  this tool in turn gives an 
indicatio n of “burden of care” for families and caregivers of children with ACH.  Wee -FIM 
is waived for children < 6 months old. 
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Infant and Toddler Quality of Life Questionnaire (ITQOL) 
The Infant Toddler Quali ty of Life questionnaire (ITQOL) is an observer -reporte d outcome 
tool developed for use in children from 2 months to 5 years old that attempts to capture 
physical, mental and social well -being. The  ITQOL adopts the World Health Organization’s 
definition of  health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well -being, and not 
merely the absence of disease. The ITQOL also assesses the quality of the parent/guardians 
life.  The 97 -item full -length version (ITQOL) will be used for this study. Completion  time 
varies.  ITQOL is waived for subjects < 2 months old. The ITQOL should be administered 
prior to any other study assessments. 
9.12.4 Exploratory Efficacy Variables  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Photography 
To document the physical and phenotypic findings of  achondroplasia with a nd without 
treatment with study drug, clinical photography of the full body, face, spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and extremities 
will be conducted. This assessment is optional. If the parents/caregivers decline clinical photography, the assessment will be waived for the duration of the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Exploratory Biomarker Research S ample Analyses  
All samples collected in this study may be used for on- study exploratory biomarker research 
once the primary use has been completed.  
For each portion of the blood and urine samples reserved for  protocol -specified analyses, 
there may be mult iple sample aliquots. Once samples have been successfully analyzed during 
the study, unused sample portions may be used during the study for assay development or other purposes stated in this section. No exploratory genomic research will be conducted witho ut consent from the subject and his/her legally authorized representative (parent or legal 
guardian).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Genomic Biomarker Analysis  
While the inherited FGFR3 mutations associated with achondroplasia are well char acterized, 
disease phenotype in monogeneic dise ases is often modified by [CONTACT_308539]. 
Exploratory genomics will include, but are not limited to NPR -B, BRAF, and other genes 
associated with CNP signaling. Exploratory genomic analysis may inform understanding of 
 Study 111- 206A2 Page [ADDRESS_378145] and his/her legally authorized representative (parent or legal guardian).  
9.12.5 Pharmacokinetics Variables  
PK plasma samples will be collected pre- dose and at 5 (± 2 min), 15 (± 2 min), 30 (± 5 min), 
45 (± 5 min), 60 (± 5 min), 90 (± 5 min), and 120 (± 5 min) minutes post -dose. On Day 1, 
additional PK samples will be collected at 180 (± 5 min) and 240 (± 5 min) minutes.  In the event of interruption of study drug adm inistration for a sentinel patient on Day [ADDRESS_378146] ug has been completed in a 
single injection. 
Whenever possible, the following PK parameters for sentinel subjects and for subjects 
randomized to BMN 111 will be estimated by [CONTACT_105]- compartmental analysis:  
• Area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC
0-∞) 
• Area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time [ADDRESS_378147]

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events  
The occurrence of AEs will be assessed continuously from the time the subject receives study 
drug. The determination, evaluation and reporting of AEs will be performed as outlined in 
Section  10.2.1. Assessments of AEs will occur at the time points shown in the Schedule of 
Events ( Table  9.1.1 and Table  9.1.2). Additionally, contact [CONTACT_3265] a study staff member to the 
caregiver will be required every week for [ADDRESS_378149]’s medical record and on the AE eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Procedures During the Study  
All concomitant procedures/ interventions /surgeries will be recorded after informed consent is 
obtained and after the first administration of study drug, until end of study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Imaging Assessment Procedures (per Schedule of Events)  
Imaging assessment procedures  for all visits must be performed using the same instruments.  
Imaging assessments can be conducted either pre -dose or post -dose.  
• Bilateral X -rays of entire lower extremity, anterior- posterior (AP) view, to assess 
long bone growth and pathology a s well as growth plate morphology. 
• Lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] X -rays to measure changes from baseline in bone morphology and 
pathology.   
• DXA of whole body [less head], spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], to assess bone mineral density (BMD) and 
bone mineral content (BMC).  
Additional imaging may be  conducted should there be any issues or concerns with the 
subject’s imaging assessments. Imaging assessments will be collected and interpreted by a 
central reader. If clinically significant abnormalities are noted, the investigator or designee is required to assess whether it is appropriate to report an AE and if the subject should continue in the study. Refer to the vendor Imaging Guidelines for detailed imaging assessment requirements and procedures.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Laboratory Assessments

[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs, Ph ysical Examinations and Other Observations  Related to Safety  
Vital signs assessed pre- dose will inclu de seated or supi[INVESTIGATOR_9219] (SBP) and 
diastolic blood pressure (DBP) measured in mm  Hg, heart rate in beats per minute, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_189425], and temperature in degrees Celsius (°C). All treatment 
visits have pre- dose vita l sign assessments. Post -dose measurements include heart rate and 
BP. For all dosing visits, assessment frequency is detailed in Table  [IP_ADDRESS].1 ( and Schedule 
of Events Tab le 9.1.1 and  Table  9.1.2).  
At Screening, after at least [ADDRESS_378152]’s BP is taken in sitting or supi[INVESTIGATOR_12251]. Vital sign measurements should be repeated and documented [ADDRESS_378153] has signs potentially consistent with hypotension or a decrease in systolic BP of 20 mm Hg or more from pre -dose systolic BP, blood pressure and heart rate (BP/HR) should 
be measured  and recorded approximately every [ADDRESS_378154] hour and every 
30 minutes thereafter until the systolic BP returns to pre -dose systolic BP (or within the 
normal range for this subject as defined by [CONTACT_976]) and signs (if present) resolve.  If the hypotension resolves within the first hour and returns to the normal range, additional BP monitoring as described above is not required. Detailed guidance for blood pressure 
measurements is provided in the Blood Pressure Instrument and Technique Guidelines.

[IP_ADDRESS] Mitigating the Risk of Potential Hypotension  
Study personnel and caregivers should be made aware of the potential risk of hypotension 
with BMN [ADDRESS_378159] be well hydrated and at a minimum be fed 
prior to administration of BMN 111  or placebo.  If a recent  acute illness associated with 
volume depletion (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) has not compl etely resolved prior to the 
first dose of BMN  111 or placebo, BMN  111 or placebo dosing may be delayed until 
hydration status has improved (up to the maximum pe riod allowed for the screening 
window). 
Caregivers should be trained to observe and recognize th e signs of dehydration (e.g. from 
fever, vomiting, diarrhea, etc.) and contact [CONTACT_308541] [ADDRESS_378160] lie down supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], elevating the 
lower ext remities, and administering fluids. For guidelines on how to report adverse events 
associated wi th hypotension, refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiography  
A standard 12- lead ECG will include heart rate, rhythm, intervals, axis, conduction defects, 
and anatomic abnormalities. The time of collection will be recorded. EC Gs sho uld be 
performed in triplicate with the subject supi[INVESTIGATOR_308437] ( Table  9.1.1 and Table  9.1.2).  ECGs will be performed post -dose on study day visits 
at which a dose is given; in addition, on Day 1, ECGs will be performed pre -dose.  On days 
when PK samples are being drawn, ECGs should be performed within a 5- minute window 
prior to 30- minute PK assessment.  If clinically significa nt abnormalities are noted, the 
investigator or designee is required to assess whether it is appropriate for the subject to continue in the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hip Clinical Assessment  
The hip clinical assessment should be completed by [CONTACT_308581] l 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_253730] a physician (MD) i.e., the investigator or the sub -investigator at the time points 
indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Table 9.1.1 and Table 9.1.2). Medical history will be 
obtained to evaluate for hip, thigh, or knee pain, or change in gai t. The physical exam 
(including observation of gait when possible) identifies and evaluates any changes in hip function or pain with as sessment of active and passive range of motion. Changes from 
baseline may trigger further evaluation based on the investi gator’s clinical assessment, which 
may include hip imaging and/or orthopedic consultation. If findings on clinical hip exam are determi ned to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_308542]’s 
Medical Monitor and orthopedic specialist (if needed), the DMC will be notified of AEs resulting from clinically significant abnormal hip monitoring assessments. DMC ma y 
provide recommendations as to if/when BMN  111 or placebo treatment should be 
temporarily or permanently discontinued.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pediatric Blood Volume  
Clinical labs and immunogenicity samples are necessary to perform to adequate safety 
assessment in this study.  The objectives of testing pharmacodynamics biomarkers are to demonstrate biologic activity of BMN  [ADDRESS_378161] of immune 
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 87

responses on drug activity; and for blood biomarkers, to investigate the effects of treatment 
on changes in bone metabolism and endogenous CNP production.  
To minimize blood collection volumes, assay technologies were chosen that are cap able of 
sensitively detecting analytes using the lowest possible volume of blood for analysis.  Additionally, assays capable of detecting analytes in urine rather than blood have been selected where possible.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Anti -BMN [ADDRESS_378162] s randomized to receive BMN  111  or placebo will undergo immunogenicity testing. 
Blood (serum) samples for immunogenicity assessm ents will be collected at the time points 
indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Table  9.1.1), and testing performed using validated 
assays. Neutralizin g antibody (NAb) testing will be performed on Baseline and TAb positive 
samples drawn from subjects weighing ≥  7.0 kg and waived for subjects <  7.0 kg.  
Scheduled samples will be tested in one  or more of the following assessments:  
• Anti- BMN 111  total antib ody (TAb)  
• Anti-BMN 111  antibody cross -reactive with endogenous CNP, ANP, and BNP (TAb)  
• Anti-BMN 111  NAb  
Testing for the presence of cross- reactive antibodies that bind to endogenous CNP, ANP, or 
BNP and for the presence of BMN 111  NAbs will be performed on baseline samples and 
anti- BMN 111  TAb-positive samples. Baseline NAb sample and cross- reactive TAb sample 
testing will be done at any time prior to the end of study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] HPA Axis Assessments 
To address potential effects of BMN 111 on activation of the hypothalamic pi[INVESTIGATOR_80560] 
(HPA) axis, assessment of salivary cortisol and serum Prolactin levels will be analyzed at the 
time points indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Table  9.1.1). Both tests will be done at 
Baseline, Week 26, and Week 52.  
[IP_ADDRESS] IgE Safety Assessments 
Samples for total immunoglobulin E  (IgE) and drug- specific IgE  testing will be drawn on 
Day 1 and in the event of a significant hypersensiti vity AE, or at the discretion of the 
investigator and/or BioMarin. A significant hypersensitivity AE is defined as an event that is 
grade 3 or higher, requires temporary or perma nent cessation of BMN 111, or is determined 
to be significant at the discretio n of investigator and/or BioMarin (excluding reactions that 
are solely a localized injection site reaction). If a hypersensitivity AE occurs, an unscheduled 
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 88 
 
Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
safety visit should occur no later than 48 hours of the start of the reaction, including 
inspection of the injection site and clinical laboratory tests.  
Blood (serum) samples should be collected and tested in one or more of the following assessments:  
•  Drug -specific IgE  
• Total IgE  
• Serum tryptase  
If feasible, a sample for drug -specific IgE should be drawn no sooner than [ADDRESS_378163] ions 
should be determined by [CONTACT_093]’s clinical judgment in consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor (if warranted).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Unscheduled Safety Visits  
Unforeseen circumst ances may arise in which an unscheduled visit may be needed. In such a 
case, t he procedures performed at the unscheduled visit will be completed on a case -by-case 
basis.  
 Study 111- 206A2 Page [ADDRESS_378164] of monitoring and recording protocol -defined AEs and SAEs; 
measurement of  protocol -specified hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis variables; 
measurement of protocol -specified vital signs; and other protocol -defined events of special 
interest that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study drug.  
10.1.1 Adverse Events  
For this protocol, a reportable adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence 
(e.g., sign, symptom, illness, disease or injury) in a subject administered the study drug or other protocol -imposed intervention, regardless of attribution. This includes the following:  
• AEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the course of the 
study.  
• Pre-existing medical conditions judged by [CONTACT_189577]. 
• Complications that occur as a result of non -drug protocol -imposed interventions 
(eg, AEs related to screening procedures, medication washout, or no- treatment 
run-in). 
An adverse dr ug reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
study-drug caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the study -drug and the AE. 
Whenever possible, it is preferable to  record a diagnosis as the AE term rather than a series 
of terms relating to a  diagnosis.  
10.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose meets 
1 or more of the following criteria:  
• Is fatal  
• Is life threatening  
Note: Life -threatening refers to an event that places the subject at immediate risk of 
death. This definition does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]   
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 90 
 
Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect in the child or fetus of a subject exposed to IP 
prior to conception or during pregnancy 
• Is an important medical event or reaction – that, based on medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the above consequences (e.g. anaphylaxis)  
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for SAEs should be regarded as 
non-serious AEs.  
10.1.[ADDRESS_378165] (EOSI)  
The following EOSI need to be reported to the Sponsor withi n 24 hours of site awareness, 
irrespective of seriousness, severity or causality:  
• Fracture  
• Slipped Capi[INVESTIGATOR_308382] (SCFE) 
• Avascular  necrosis or Osteonecrosis  
10.2 Methods and Timing for Capturing and Assessing Safety Parameters  
10.2.1 Adverse Event Reportin g Period  
For subjects enrolled in Cohort 1 (  ≥  24 to <  60 months old) and Cohort 2 (  ≥ 6 to   < 24 months 
old), the study AE reporting period is as follows: after informed consent but prior to initiation of study treatment, only SAEs associated with any protocol -imposed interventions will be 
reporte d.  After informed consent is obtained and the first  administration of study drug, all 
non-serious AEs and SAEs reporting period begins and continues until [ADDRESS_378166] administration of study drug or the early termination visit, which ever is longer 
(refer to Section 12.1.11 ). The criteria for determining, and the reporting of, SAEs is 
provided in Section 10.1.2.  For subjects enrolled in Cohort 3 (0 to
 <  6 months old), the 
collection period for all AEs begins after informed consent is obtained.  
10.2.[ADDRESS_378167]’s medical record and on the AE Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  
10.2.[ADDRESS_378168] will assess AEs for severity, relationship to study drug, and seriousness (refer to Section 10.1.2 for SAE 
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 91 
 
Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
definitions).  These assessments should be made by a study clinician with the training and 
authority to make a diagnosis (e.g., MD/DO, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, or DDS).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Seriousness  
The investigator will assess if an AE should be classified as “serious” based on the seriousness criteria enumerated in Section 10.1.2.  Seriousness ser ves as a guide for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity  
Severity (as in mild, moderate, or severe headache) is not equivalent to seriousness, which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usual ly associated with events that pose a 
threat to a subject’s life or functioning.  The severity of each will be assessed using the defined categories in  Table  [IP_ADDRESS].1. 
The Investigator  or qualified designee will determine the severity of each AE and SAE, and 
EOSI using the NCI CTCAE v4. Adverse events that do not have a corresponding CTCAE term will be assessed according to the general guidelines for grading used in the CTCAE v4 
as stat ed below. 
Table  [IP_ADDRESS].1:  Adverse Event Grading (Severity) Scale  
Grade  Description  
1 Mild: asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
2 Moderate: minimal, local  or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -

[IP_ADDRESS] Causality  
The Investigator will d etermine the relationship of an AE to the study drug and will record it 
on the source documents and AE eCRF.  To ensure consistency of causality assessments, 
Investigators should apply the guidance in Table  [IP_ADDRESS].1. 
Table  [IP_ADDRESS].1:  Causality Attribution Guidance  
Rela tionship  Description  
Not Related  • Exposure to the IP has not occurred  
OR 
• The administration of the IP and the occurrence of the AE are not 
reasonably related in time  
OR 
• The AE is considered likely to be related to an etiology other than the use 
of the IP; that is, there are no facts, evidence, or arguments to suggest a causal relationship to the IP.  
Related  • The administration of the IP and the occurrence of the AE are reasonably 
related in time  
AND  
• The AE could not be explained by [CONTACT_308543] 
 • The administration of IP and the occurrence of the AE ar e reasonably 
related in time  
AND  
• The AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_189626].  
Factors suggestive of a causal relationship could include (but are not limited to):  
• Plausible temporal relationship  
• Absence of alternative explanations  
• Rarity of event in a given subject or disease state  
• Absence of event prior to study drug exposure  
• Consistency wi th study product pharmacology  
• Known relationship to underlying mechanism of study drug action  
• Similarity to adverse reactions seen with related drug products  
• Abatement of AE with discontinuation of study drug, and/or recurrence of AE with 
reintroduction of  study drug

The investigator’s assessment of causality for individual AE reports is part of the study 
documentation process.  Regardless of the Investigator’s assessment of causality for 
individual AE reports, the Sponsor will promptly evaluate all reported SAEs against 
cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously communicate possible new safety findings to investi gators and applicable regulatory authorities.  
10.[ADDRESS_378169] only one diagnosis, sign, or symptom per event field on the AE eCRF (e.g., nausea 
and vomiting should not be recorded in the same entry, but as 2 separate entries).  
In order to classify AEs and diseases, preferred terms will be assigned by [CONTACT_308582], using MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) terminology.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms  
Using accepted medical terminology, enter the diagnosis (if known).  If not known, enter sign(s) and/or  symptom(s).  If a diagnosis subsequently becomes available, then this 
diagnosis should be entered on the AE form, replacing the original entries where appropriate.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events 
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events) should be 
identified by [CONTACT_5252].  For example, if severe diarrhea is known t o have resulted 
in dehydration, it is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE or SAE on the eCRF.  
However, medically important e vents that may be linked and/or separated in time should be 
recorded as independent events on the eCRF.  For example, if severe hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be recorded separately on the eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between subject evaluation time points.  Such an eve nt should be recorded only once on the eCRF unless its 
severity increases or decreases (in which case it should be recorded again on the AE eCRF).  
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between subject evaluation time points, but then subsequently recurs.  All recurrences of the AE should be recorded on the AE eCRF.

Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hypotension  
If an asymptomatic drop in blood pressure meets the  protocol definition of AE per clinical 
judgment of the reporter, report the event as “blood pressure decreased.”  If the drop in blood 
pressure is associated with signs or symptoms, complete the symptomatic hypotension eCRF and use the following guidance to report the corresponding AE eCRF: If a unifying diagnosis is available to explain the event of hypotension, report the d iagnosis as an AE and capture 
signs and symptoms on the symptomatic hypotension eCRF page. If no other unifying diagnosis is availabl e, report “hypotension” as the event and capture signs and symptoms on 
the symptomatic hypotension eCRF page.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Injection Si te Reactions 
If an injection site reaction is associated with a single sign or symptom, report the event on 
AE eCRF page (e.g., redne ss at injection site, AE is injection site redness). If the injection 
site reaction is associated with multiple signs or sy mptoms, report injection site reaction as 
the adverse event on the AE page, and individual signs and symptoms will be reported on the  
ISR eCRF page (e.g., if the subject experiences redness and induration, report “Injection site 
reaction” on the AE page, a nd in the corresponding Injection eCRF page, report erythema 
and induration).  If the injection site reaction appears after 24 hours, add “delayed” to the 
term used to describe the event.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory Values  
Laboratory test results will be recorded on the laboratory results pages of the eCRF, or 
appear on electronically produced laboratory reports submitted directly from the cent ral 
laboratory, if applicable.  
Any laboratory result abnormality fulfilling the criteria for a SAE should be reported as such, 
in addition to being recorded as an AE in the eCRF.  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as AE if it is not oth erwise refuted 
by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality and any  one or more of the following conditions 
is met:  
• Accompan ied by [CONTACT_4659]  
• Leading to a change in study medication (e.g. dose modification, interruption or 
permanent discontinuation)  
• Requiring a change in concomitant therapy (e.g. addition of, interruption of, discontinuation of, or any other change in a concomitant medication, therapy or treatment).  
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 95 
 
Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
• The abnormality is of a degr ee that requires active management (e.g., change of dose, 
discontinuation of study drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further 
diagnostic investigation, etc.)  
This applies to any protocol and non- protocol specified safety and efficacy laboratory res ult 
from tests performed after the first dose of study medication that falls outside the laboratory 
reference ra nge and meets the clinical significance criteria.  
This does not apply to any abnormal laboratory result that falls outside the laboratory 
reference range but that does not meet the clinical significance criteria (these will be analyzed and reported as labo ratory abnormalities), those that are considered AEs of the type 
explicitly exempted by [CONTACT_760], or those which are a result of an AE that has already been reported.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pre-existing Conditions  
A pre -existing condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  Such conditions 
should be recorded as medical history on the appropriate eCRF.  
A pre -existing condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE during the study only  if the 
frequency, intensity, or character of the condition worsens during the study period.  It is 
important to convey the concept that a pre -existing condition has changed by [CONTACT_308583] d escription of the event (e.g., more frequent  headaches).  
[IP_ADDRESS] General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening , any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a pre -existing 
condition (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  Du ring the study, any new clinically significa nt 
findings and/or abnormalities discovered on physical examination that meet the definition of 
an AE (or an SAE) must be recorded and document as an AE or SAE on the AE eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or Surgery 
Any AE that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_308413] (refer to Section 10.1.2).  
There are some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_189433].  These scenarios include planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216412]:  
• Perform a protocol -mandated efficacy measurement 
 Study 111- 206A2 Page 96 
 
Proprietary and Confidential       8 February 2019  
• Undergo a diagnostic procedure  
• Elective surgical procedure for a pre -existing medical condition that has not changed  
• Receive scheduled therapy (study drug or otherwise) for the study indication 
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths  
All deaths that occur during the AE reporting peri od (refer to Section  10.2.1), regardless of 
attribution, will be recorded on the AE eCRF and expeditiously reported to the Sponsor as an 
SAE.  
When recording a death, the event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the eCRF.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, record “Unexplained Death” or “Death of Unknown Cause” on the eCRF.  If the death is attri buted to progression of the 
disease or condition being studies, record “ -” as the SAE term on the eCRF.  
10.4 Reporting Requirements  
The Sponsor is responsible for identifying, preparing, and reporting all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) to the relevant competent authorities, ethics committees, and investigators in accordance with requirements identified in the Clinical Trials Regulations.
 
10.4.1 Expedited Reporting Requirements  
All SAEs and EOSI, if applicable that occur during the course of the  AE Reporting Period 
(refer to Section 10.2.1), whether or not considered related to study drug, must be reported by 
[CONTACT_308544] [ADDRESS_378170] information that fully documents the event before notifying BPV of a n SAE.  BioMarin may be required to report certain SAEs to regulatory 
authorities within 7 c alendar days of being notified about the event; therefore, it is important 
that Investigators submit any information requested by [CONTACT_189463].  
If the electronic data capture (EDC) is unavailable, all SAEs should be reported to BPV by [CONTACT_308545] [ADDRESS_378171] administration of study drug or study 
discontinuation/termination, whichever is longer.  
10.4.[ADDRESS_378172] be obtained by [CONTACT_308584].  
10.5 Follow -up of Subjec ts after Adverse Events 
The Investigator should follow all unresolved AEs/SAEs until the events are resolved or have stabilized, the subject is lost to follow -up, or it has been determined that the study treatment 
or participation is not the cause of the A E/SAE.  Resolution of AEs and SAEs (with dates) 
should be documented on the AE eCRF and in the subject’s medical record to facilitate source data verification.  
For some SAEs, the Sponsor may follow  up by [CONTACT_756], fax, electronic mail, and/or a 
monitoring visit to obtain additional case details (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458], consultant 
report, or autopsy report) deemed necessary to appropriately evaluate the SAE r eport.  
10.[ADDRESS_378173] to report, to the 
Investigator and/or to BPV directly, any subsequent SAEs that the subject’s personal 
physician(s) believes might be related to pri or study treatment.  
The Investigator should notify the study Sponsor of any death or SAE occ urring at any time 
after a subject has discontinued or terminated study participation, if the Investigator believes 
that the death or SAE may have been related to prior study treatment . The Sponsor should 
also be notified if the Investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject who participated in this study.  
10.[ADDRESS_378174] the safety of subjects, and that the appropriate regulatory bodies should be notified according to their respective regulations. According to the EU Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC, “…in the light of the circumstances, notably the occurrence of any 
 Study 111- 206A2 Page [ADDRESS_378175]. The sponsor shall  forthwith inform the competent 
authorities of those new events and the measures taken and shall ensure that the IRB/EC/REB is notified at the same time.”  
The Sponsor is responsible for identifying, preparing and reporting all S[LOCATION_003]Rs to the 
relevant competent authorities, ethics committees and investigators in accordance with  the 
requirements identified in the Clinical Trials Regulations.  
The reporting period for these events which may require the implementation of urgent safety measures is the period from  the time of signing of the ICF through the completion of the last 
study visit or at the Early Termination Visit (ETV). Investigators are required to report any events which may require the implementation of urgent safety measures to BioMarin within 24 hours.  
Examples of situations that may require urgent safety measures inclu de discovery of the 
following:  
• Immediate need to revise the IP administration (eg, modified dose amount or frequency 
not defined in protocol)  
• Lack of study scientific value, or detrimental study conduct or management  
• Discovery that the quality or safety of  the IP does not meet established safety 
requirements

13 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE 
BioMarin personnel  or designees will visit the study site prior to initiation of the study to 
review with the site personnel information about the IP, protocol and other regulatory 
document requirements, any applicable randomization procedures, source document requirements,  eCRFs, monitoring requirements, and procedures f or reporting AEs, including 
SAEs.  
At visits during and after the study, a CRA will monitor the site for compliance with regulatory documentation, with a focus on accurate and complete recording of data on e CRFs 
from source documents, adherence to protocol , randomization (if applicable), SAE reporting 
and drug accountability records.  
Sites will enter study data into eCRFs into the study EDC system.  Data Quality Control will be performed by [CONTACT_308585]. Additional subject -reported study data may be entered into the study EDC 
system via electronic diary.

14 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SI ZE  
14.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans  
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide additional details on the planned statistical 
analysis. Unless otherwise stated, all analyses will be performed using SAS  v. 9.4.  
14.1.1 Interim Analyses  
An interim analysis will be carried out to support NDA/MAA filing. The study team, subjects, and investigators will have no access to the individual subject treatment allocation, and blinded pooled safety outputs will be provided for the randomized subjects.  
14.1.[ADDRESS_378181] current version of MedDRA will be used by [CONTACT_308586], 
based on the original terms entered on the CRF. 
All AEs will be coded using MedDRA. The incidence of AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_29974], preferred term, relationship to study treatment (as assessed by [CONTACT_1697]), and 
severity. All AEs, including SAEs and AEs that lead to permanent discontinuation from the study and from the study treatment, will be listed. Hypersensitivity reactions and 
 Study 111- 206A2 Page [ADDRESS_378182], descriptive statistics will be provided on baseline as well as all subsequent visits.  
All other safety measures including laboratory tes ts, vital signs, ECG, echocardiogram, hip 
clinical assessment, and concomitant medication data will also be summarized descriptively. Data summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_17673] (when applicable) for each cohort and 
overall. All safety results will be listed. 
14.3 Efficacy Analysis  
Efficacy analysis will be performed on the efficacy population as defined in Section 14.7.1. 
Efficacy endpoints include length/height AGV and length/height standard score (Z -score) at 
Week 52.  
For a given interval [Date1, Date2], the AGV is defined as follows:  
AGV = Length /standing  height  at Day  2− Length /standing  height  at Day  1
Interval  Length  (Days ) ×365.25  
 
where the interval length in days is calculated as Date2 – Date1. AGV will be calculated for 
the following visits/intervals:  
• Baseline: [Date of last length/he ight measurement in study [ADDRESS_378183] 6 months prior 
to Day 1 in study 206, Date of Day 1]  
• Week 13: [Date of Day 1, Date of Week 13]  
• Week 26: [Date of Day 1, Date of Week 26]  
• Week 39: [Date of Day 1, Date of Week 39]  
• Week 52 (12- month): [Date of Day 1, Da te of Week 52]  
The baseline of the A GV is established in the natural history study of Study111- 901, based 
on the standing height measurements in the last 6 months prior to enrollment to Study 111-206. AGV will be summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, SD, median, minimum, 
and maximum ). Results will be summarized by [CONTACT_308456] .

The measurement of length/standing height will be converted to age -and sex -appropriate 
standard score (SDS), also referred to as Z -score, by [CONTACT_308548] (not ACH). The Z- score will be summarized similarly to growth velocity.  
Comparisons between treatment groups by [CONTACT_308549]. Statistical comparisons will be considered descriptive . Additional details 
regarding effic acy analysis will be provided in the SAP.  
14.4 Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Subjects randomized to receive BMN 111 or placebo will undergo pharmacokinetic testing.  
For subjects randomized to BMN 111, PK parameters generated over  the course of the study 
will be evaluated and summarized with descriptive statistical measures (mean, standard deviation, CV%, min, median and max). Correlative analyses of some of the PK par ameters 
with efficacy, safety and immunogenicity measures may be conducted.  
14.5 Immunogenicity Analysis  
Immunogenicity will be summarized as change from baseline as well as by [CONTACT_308587] 111 or placebo.  Results will be summarized as incidence and titer for all cohorts. Addition ally, immunogenicity may be assessed for 
correlations with measures of safety, PK, and efficacy.  
14.6 Determination of Sample Size  
Approximately 70 subjects age 0 to
 < [ADDRESS_378184] lev el and/or on a cohort level per the pre -specified stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]. Based on criteria 
outlined in the protocol, the DMC may also make endorsements for dose adjustments if needed.

 Study 111- 206A2 Page [ADDRESS_378185] INJURY  
There will be no charge to study subjects to be in this study. Bi oMarin will pay all costs of 
tests, procedures, and treatments that are part of this study. In addition, after IRB/IEC/REB 
approval, BioMarin may reimburse the reasonable cost of tr avel for study -related visits in 
accordance with BioMarin’s study -specific travel and reimbursement policy. BioMarin will 
not pay for any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], tests, or treatments for medical problems of any sort related solely to the study subject’s disease.  Costs associated with such hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], tests, and 
treatments should be billed and collected in the way that such costs are usually billed and collected outside the study. 
The Investigator should contact [CONTACT_189584] a study subject 
has been injured by [CONTACT_141551]. 
Any subject who experiences a study -related injury should be instructed by [CONTACT_308551] a pre- specified medical institution if possible, or at 
the closest medical treatment facility if necessary. The subject should be given the name [CONTACT_4007] a person to contact [CONTACT_187696], and assistance with, treatment for 
study- related injuries. The treating physicia n should bill the subject’s health insurance 
company or other third party payer for the cost of this medical treatment. If the cost of the 
medical treatment is not covered by [CONTACT_187697], then either BioMarin or the institution may pay for reasonable and necessary medical services to treat the injuries caused by [CONTACT_191684]. In some 
jurisdictions, BioMarin is obligated by [CONTACT_44533]- related injuries without prior 
recourse to third party payer billing and/or regardless of fault. If this is th e case, BioMarin 
will comply with the law.  
 Study 111- 206A2 Page [ADDRESS_378186] -reported data is transmitted directl y into EDC, as 
referenced in the study specific vendor management plan. Unless explicitly allowed in the eCRF instructions, blank data fields are not acceptable.  
In the event of an entry error, or if new information becomes available, the value will be corrected by [CONTACT_216456]. In compliance with 21 CFR Part  11, the system will require the personnel making 
the correction to enter a reason for changing the value. The documented audit  trail will 
include the reason for the change, the original value, the new value, the time of the correction and the identity of the operator.  
BioMarin’s policy is that study data o n the eCRFs must be verifiable to the source data, 
which necessitates acces s to all original recordings, laboratory reports, and subject records. 
In addition, all source data should be attributable (signed and dated). The Investigator must therefore agree to allow direct access to all source data. Subjects (or their legally autho rized 
representative) must also allow access to their medical records, and subjects will be informed 
of this and will confirm their agreement when giving informed consent. If direct  source 
document verification of study data by [CONTACT_308588], then the Investigator must make available facilities and/or personnel to allow GCP -compliant source verification to occur. Examples of such methods include certified 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_308439] b ut sensitive information redacted, or other 
GCP -compliant means agreed between the Investigator and the Sponsor.  
A CRA designated by [CONTACT_308589] l source documents 
at the study site and evaluate them for completeness and  accuracy before designating them as 
“Source Data Verified” (SDV). Electronic Subject -reported data transferred directly into 
EDC will not be SDV’d or queried. If an error is discovered at any time or a clarification is needed, the CRA, or designee, will c reate an electronic query on the associated field. Site 
personnel will then answer the query by [CONTACT_187701]. The CRA will then review the response and determine either to close the query or re–query the site if the  response does not fully address the question. This process is repeated until all 
open queries have been answered and closed.  
 Study 111- 206A2 Page [ADDRESS_378187]’s eCRF casebook can be locked, data f ields must be source data verified and 
all queries closed. Refer to the Stu dy Monitoring Plan for details on which fields must be 
source data verified.  The Investigator will then electronically sign the casebook, specifying 
that the information on the eCR Fs is accurate and complete. The Data Manager, or designee, 
will then set the status of the forms, visits, and the entire casebook to Locked. Upon completion of the CSR, an electronic copy of each site’s casebooks will be copi[INVESTIGATOR_99628] a compact disk (CD) and sent to each site for retention with other study documents.  
 Study 111- 206A2 Page [ADDRESS_378188] the monitors. The 
Investigator and staff are responsible for being present or available for consultation during routinely scheduled site visits conducted by [CONTACT_189478].  
Members of BioMarin’s GCP Compliance Department or designees may conduct an audit of a clinical site at any time before, during, or after co mpletion of the study. The Investigator 
will be informed if an audit is to take place and advised as to the scope of the audit. Representatives of the FDA or other Regulatory Agenci es may also conduct an audit of the 
study. If informed of such an inspection, the Investigator should notify BioMarin immediately. The Investigator will ensure that the auditors have access to the clinical supplies, study site facilities, original source d ocumentation, and all study files.  
 Study 111- 206A2 Page [ADDRESS_378189] notify BioMarin of a ny change 
in the l ocation, disposition or custody of the study files. The Investigator /institution must 
take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of essential documents, that is, documents that individually and collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of a study and the quality of the data produced, including paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_44460] (e.g., subject charts) as well as any original source documents that are electronic as required by [CONTACT_25435].  
All study records must be re tained for at least [ADDRESS_378190] approval of a marketing 
application in the US or an ICH region and until (1) there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in the U.S. or an ICH region or (2) at least [ADDRESS_378191] elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the IP. The Investigator /institution should retain subject identifiers for at least [ADDRESS_378192] with retention should Investigator /institution be unable to continue 
maintenance of subject files for the full 15 years. It is the responsibility of BioMarin to inform the Investigator/institution as to when thes e documents no longer need to be retained.

Section 7.4/Study Rationale Study 111 -202 is an ongoing Phase 2, open -label, seq uential cohort, dose escalation study that assesses daily SC 
administration of BMN 111 in pediatric subjects with ACH, in which the primary objective is to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of BMN 111 administered for 6 months and up to 24 months and includes secondary objectives consisting of 13

Section No./Title  Revision  Rationale  
determination of change from baseline in AGV, growth parameters, body proportions, and  evaluation of the dose -
exposure and PK profiles of BMN 111 in children with ACH. 
Analysis of safety data from the 6 month initial phase of Study 111 -202 showed that treatment with BMN 111 was 
generally well tolerated at all dose levels (refer to current Investigators Brochure for specific details). 
Analysis of efficacy data from Study 111 -202 demonstrated that that subjects given BMN 111 at the dose of 15 µg/kg 
daily had an improvement in AGV, with approximately ~50% increase over baseline seen with treatment for 6 months 
which was sustained after continued treatment for 12 months. 
Subjects treated with 30 µg/kg daily also showed similar improvement in mean AGV after 6 months and their mean 
changes from baseline in AGV were similar to subjects treated wi th 15 µg/kg daily. Safety data for the 30- µg/kg daily 
dose was also similar to the 15 -µg/kg daily dose.  Given that no clinicall y significant difference could be identified 
between the 15 µg/kg and 30 -µg/kg daily dose in the Phase 2, 6 month safety and eff icacy data, the lower of the two 
doses has been chosen for this Phase 2 study.

After completing the observation period, subjects must ful fill the general eligibility criteria prior to receiving treatment 
with study drug.  
Section 
9.3.6/ Removal of 
Subjects from 
Treatment or Assessment Investigators may discontinue administration of BMN [ADDRESS_378210] from study treatment include, but are not limited to, the following:  . . .    
. . . T herefore, subject s who discontinue study treatment should be encouraged to continue to undergo as many of the 
protocol -specified procedures and assessments as possible for the remainder of the study, as long as such continued 
participation does not detrime ntally affect the health, safety, or welfare of the subject, and consent remains in place. It is 
important that following treatment discontinuation the original visit schedule is strictly adhered to .  13 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] /Product 
Characteristics and Labeling ; Synopsis  The c linical drug product will be supplied in sterile, single -dose, Type I glass vials with coated stopper and flip -off 
aluminum cap. BMN [ADDRESS_378211] is supplied as a 0.8 -mg or 2- mg lyophilized, preservative -free, white -to-yellow 
powder for reconstitution with either a sterile diluent or  sterile water for injection (WFI) . The reconstituted solution is 
colorless to yellow and contains 0.8  mg/mL to 2 mg/mL of BMN 111, as well as citric acid, sodium citrate, trehalos e, 
mannitol, methionine, polysorbate 80, and  sterile WFI water for injection . The target pH of the reconstituted solution is 
5.5. Sterile WFI water for injection  will be commercially sourced and sterile diluent solution containing all of the above 
excipi[INVESTIGATOR_308443]. All reconstitution and dose preparation steps will be performed as indicated 
in the BMN 111 Injection Guide and Injection video.  8 
Section 9.4.4/Directions for Administration  The caregiver will be provided with a paper or electronic  study diary and will be a sked to record daily dosing 
information, changes in health status, medications and injection sites used, date and time of the injection, and injection 
site reactions, if any . 13 
Section 
9.4.5/ Method of 
Assigning Subjects 
to Treatment Groups  Subjects will be randomized using an interactive voice/response system  in a 1:1 ratio, i.e., injection with placebo:15 
µg/kg of BMN [ADDRESS_378212] party vendor will develop the randomization schedule so that 
BioMarin and site personnel are blinde d to treatment assignments.  NOTE: In Japan, subjects are randomized separately 
within each cohort.  13 
Section 9.4.7 /Blinding  An independent third -party vendor will develop the randomization schedule so that BioMarin  and site personnel will not 
know treatment assignments. BMN 111 or placebo will be labeled with the study number and a unique identification 13

[IP_ADDRESS] /Imaging 
Assessment 
Procedures  •Bilateral X-rays of entire  lower extremity  x-rays, anterior -posterior (AP) view, to assess growth plate
morphology.
•Hip imaging via pelvis X x-ray to identify hip pathology
•Lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] X x-rays to measure changes from baseline in bone morphology and pathology.
•MRI to evaluate the effect of BMN 111 on skull and brain morphology, including foramen magnum, ve ntricular
and brain parenchymal dimensions.
•DXA  (BMD and BMC)  of whole body [less head], spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and forearm (including ultra -distal, mid -distal, and
one- third radius regions of interest) to assess bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) .13 
Section 
9.12.3/ Secondary 
Efficacy Variables  The secondary efficacy endpoints include change from baseline in AGV (annualized to cm/yr ), biomarker samples to 
evaluate the effect of BMN 111 on bone metabolism, and BMN 111 pharmacodynamic biomarkers, growth parameters and 
body proportions, sleep apnea, skull and brain morphology, and clinical outcome assessments 
(developmental/functional/H RQo L status).  9

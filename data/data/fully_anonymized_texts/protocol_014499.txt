 1. Literature Summary  and Study Rationale  
Multiple factors can lead to a general decline in the physical condition of adults  at any age . Medical 
challenges posed by [CONTACT_554966] a general loss of 
muscle mass, decreased balance, and increase d risk of falling . The Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) states , “As an older adult, regular physical activity is one of the most important 
things you can do for your health. It can prevent many of the health problems that seem to come 
with age. ”[ADDRESS_728687] efforts, illness and injuries occur and often lead to sedentary behavior 
and a general deconditioning  of adults of all ages . Deconditioning is defined as “the loss of muscle 
tone and endurance due to chronic disease, immobility, or loss of function.”2 Falvey et al3 studied 
one group of adults that experienced “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -associated deconditioning” or HAD , defined as 
“marked  deficits in physical function second ary to an acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094]” and stated that “68% of 
patients are discharged from post -acute care settings below their prehospi[INVESTIGATOR_554942]. ” Further, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554943] 61 times more likely to develop disability in 
activities of daily living (ADLs) than those who are not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].[ADDRESS_728688] been admitted to a facility.  
 
3. Study Design  
This is a  single -arm , short term,  safety and feasibility study .

change his/ her mind and may withdraw from the study at any time without prejudicing further 
care. The study inve stigator or designee will give the applicant  an informed consent document to 
read and time to ask questions and think about his/ her decision prior to signing and dating the 
consent form. Further, t he investigator or the investigator’s designee will inform the applicant  that  
as a Participant  in a study, his/her medical records may  be review ed by [CONTACT_554967] , and  that study information will be used during the a nalysis of 
the results of the clinical study, but that the identity  of the Participant  would not be disclosed to any 
reports em anating from this study.  Applicants must sign a consent form before any study -specific 
evaluations or procedures are performed.  
 
Applicant s become enrolled as Participant s in the study upon signing the consent form . The 
original signed consent  form  will be returned to the investi gator and filed in the Participant ’s study 
file. The Participant  will be given a copy of the signed consent to keep.   
 
Treatment will consist of exercise using the EksoGT described below. Dosage (daily or weekly) and 
progression  of settings  (challenge) will be highly individualized due to the heterogeneous 
population to be enrolled in this study.  No par ticipant is expected  to exceed 5 sessions in the 
exoskeleton.  
 
9. Ekso Device Description and Safety Features  
The EksoGT is a powered motorized orthosis intended to enable individuals who are experiencing 
muscular or neurological conditions  affecting their lower extremities  to perform ambulatory 
functions such as gait training. (See Figures 1 and 2.)  It consists of a fitted metal brace that supports 
the legs, feet, and torso. It is adjustable to accommodate different length segements  and dif ferent 
hip widths. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] , a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_554944] e patient’s feet, legs, and tor so into the device. 
When patients become more familiar with the Ekso they may strap themselves in. The straps are 
designed for the patient to easily get in and out o f the device either on their own or with minimal 
assistance. Soft  goods (p ads, spacers, straps, and supports) are available for bracing and adapting to 
various body types. The straps and soft  goods are specifically designed to prevent pressure points 
or ot her skin issues. There is also a link (Don -Doff Link) just below each hip joint, which permits 
abducting the legs while seated to facilitate donning and doffing the device.

Figure 1: The EksoGT in use during gait training 
of an SCI patient.   
 
Figure 2: The EksoGT structure and general 
dimensions.  
 
The EksoGT manipulates the patient’s legs and waist to stand up, walk over level ground, and then 
to sit down. Battery powered motors drive knee and hip joints. The batteries are designed to last 
for approximately three hours of normal use. The patient is required to assist with balance and 
body positioning using a cane, crutch es, or walker , which are  provided with the device. The physical 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_554945]. The device 
is operated in various modes. In some modes, steps are triggered with the attached user interface. 
In other modes, steps are triggered when the machine is in certain target postures. In other modes, 
the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_554946], if the patient has some residual 
strength, the patient performs some of the walking motion with their own muscles.  
 
The EksoGT has a number of features to ensure patient safety. It is equipped with mechanical hard 
stops at the limits of healthy Participant  ranges of motion to prevent powering the joint of the user 
to a position that the joint cannot reach. The actuated range of motion at the hip is -20° to 135° and 
the actuated range for the knee is 0° to 120°. Not all of this range of motion is needed in normal 
walking; however the ranges of these joints were selected to provide for other necessary functions 
such as sta nding and sitting. At the ankle the device is passive, with springs to resist sagittal plane 
motion , and locked in the other degrees of freedom. The range of motion provided at the ankle is 
from -10° to 20° dorsiflexion with hard stops at the limits of thi s range to protect the user and a 
setting to specify the neutral angle.  
 
Redundant position sensing on all of the actuated joints ensures that the motors are always 
controlled using reliable sensor information. In addition, the device has numerous sensor, motor, 
and software monitoring systems.  If any abnormality is detected ( i.e. excess joint speed or force, or 
if redundant sensors do not agree) the device enters a safe mode, which prevents continued 
walking and enables the physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_554947]. The device is also equipped 
with fail -safe brakes on th e actuated knee joints, such that if the device loses power or is shut down 
for any reason the knees will continue to support the patient. Finally, an emergency disable button 
is available to instantly shut down the device for any reason. This is implement ed via hardware, so 
it is effective even during a software malfunction.   
 
The EksoGT is intended to be used under the supervision of a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_554948] [ADDRESS_728691]  options, as well as 
unilateral and 2Free  modes with neutral, high/low assistance , and high/low resistance  options . All 
pre-gait features will be available during this study.  
 
There is no comparator device in this single -arm study.  
 
Inventory control is not applicable in this trial since sites will use their commercially acquired 
devices for this study of a new indication for use.  
 
10. General Rules for Training Sessions  
1. The goal is to have  Participants  train in the EksoGT daily for 30-[ADDRESS_728692] ’s discretion.  
 
To challenge Participant:  
1. In Fixed Assist, lower the swing assist for each leg as appropriate . 
2. In Fixed Assist, stance support may be changed from “Full” to “Flex” as appropriate.  
3. In FreeGait, stance support should begin at an appropriate level. As Participant improves 
stance control, support may be reduced as tolerated and clinically appropriate.  
4. In FreeGait , swing assist should be assessed at “neutral”. If a leg is not able to complete a 
step, “high”/”low assistance” may be provided for more normalized steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. If a leg is 
steppi[INVESTIGATOR_554949], “high”/”low resistance” may be provid ed for 
more normalized steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Progress to a more symmetrical gait.  
5. In FreeGait, set swing support at lower assistace or higher resistance for an appropriate 
clinical challenge.  
 
11. Participant  Assessments  
In-person limited screening procedures are conducte d to assess minimal trial inclusion. Prior to 
initiating physical or psychological screening evaluations, study personnel must obtain a signed 
informed consent. Participant  screening can then proceed to ensure the individual meets 
inclusion/exclusion crite ria.  
 
The following information will be obtained  during screening : 
1. Demographic data including date of birth, gender, date of illness  (self -reported) .  
2. Past and current medical history (from medical records) . 
3. Reason for admission to the facility  (from medical records) . 
4. List of current medications  (from medical records) . 
5. Weight and height  (from medical records) . 
6. Vital signs ( HR, BP, O 2 sat from medical records).  
107159 REV  A -  Clinical Protocol  
 Page 11 of 19 
 7. Written documentation from the patient’s  physician verifying the patient  is medically stable 
and cleared for full weight bearing locomotor training and does not have any conditions 
that would exclude the Participant  (see Inclusion/Exclusion criteria) . 
8. Current practice of standing or walking, lev el of assistance required , assistive devices and 
braces used , and any associated adverse events (self -reported) . 
9. Range of motion for hip flexion/extension, knee flexion/extension/ ankle dorsi/plantar 
flexion . 
10. Upper extremity  MMT to include: shoulder flexion/ext ension/abduction and elbow 
extension . 
11. Skin check of back,  sacrum , shins, and feet  (must be done at each visi t). 
 
The following data will be collected per session : 
1. Any adverse events /complications  noted following prior  to training session and during 
present session . 
2. Assessment of skin integrity of the anterior and posterior torso, anterior tibia, sacral area 
and bilateral feet (before and after training) . 
3. Vital signs  (HR, BP, O 2 sat collected daily) . 
4. Walk time . 
5. Stand /Up time . 
6. Estimated s eated rest time . 
7. Estimated regular overground walking time (outside of EksoGT).  
8. Number of steps total and in each mode  of EksoGT . 
9. Time  spent in each EksoGT  mode .  
 
12. Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical event that occurs to a study Participant  once the 
individual has signed the informed consent form until the study Participant ’s last study visit.   
Examples include:  
• Any sign, symptom, or physical examination finding that worsens in nature, severity or 
frequency  compared to baseline . 
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is one that meets any of the following criteria:  
• Results in death . 
• Is life threatening . 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324] .  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . 
• An important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1838], may be considered a serious adverse event when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, it jeopardizes the Participant  and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
A life -threatening adverse event is defined as any adverse experience that places the Participant , in 
the view of the Investigator, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred, i.e. it does not 
include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. ALL serious 
adverse events must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the knowledge of the event and 
reported to the respective IRB as soon as possible , but no later than ten working days after the 
investigator learns of the event or as required by [CONTACT_1201]. In the event of Participant  death, a copy of 
107159 REV  A -  Clinical Protocol  
 Page 12 of 19 
 death records, medical records pertaining to the events leading up to the death and an autopsy 
report (if  performed) must be sent to the Sponsor as soon as possible. All Participant  identifiers 
other than the Participant  number and initials must be removed from the documents submitted to 
the Sponsor.  
A pre -existing condition is one that is present prior to o r at the start of the study and is to be 
reported as part of the Participant ’s medical history. It should be reported as an adverse event only 
if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during study participation.  
An un anticipa ted adverse event is one not identified in nature, severity, or frequency in the current 
protocol.  
Adverse events (AE) data collection must begin once the Participant  has signed the informed 
consent document. AEs will continue to be collected each visit du ring the entire 12-week training 
period and end at the 6 -month visit. In general , AEs  should be reported and classified by [CONTACT_70167] a diagnosis. The diagnosis should be confirmed through specific signs, symptoms, 
and (if necessary) laboratory tests.  Data to be collected will include the description of the event, 
onset and res olution dates (or whether the event is ongoing), severity, management/treatment, 
outcome, and determination of the relationship to the device used during training. The relationship 
of the event to the device used will be further described as related or unr elated to a specific device. 
If related to a device, the categories will be further described as definitely, probably, or possibly -
related using the following definitions:  
1. Definitely device -related : Any event that is associated with the device by [CONTACT_554968] d 
physiology, and was caused or contributed to by [CONTACT_8121].  
2. Probably device -related : Any event that is associated with the device by [CONTACT_554969], and there is a good chance that it may have been caused or contributed to by [CONTACT_133238].  
3. Possibly device -related : Any event that is associated with the device by [CONTACT_554969], and there is a possibility that it may have been caused or contributed to by [CONTACT_133238].  
 
Severity of the AE will be coded as to the degree of severity as follows:  
A. Mild : Awareness of the event , but easily tolerated.  
B. Moderate : Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity.  
C. Severe : Inability to carry out usual activity . (Not necessarily the same as a Serious Adverse 
Event. Participant s may have a severe flu but not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].)  
 
Treatment for the AE includes all of the commercially approved products or standard procedures 
that are to be administered according to standard medical practice. Investigational products or 
procedures are not to be used as a treatment for an adverse event. All unresolved AEs should be 
followed by [CONTACT_554970], the event is identified as being a chronic 
condition, or the Participant  is lost to follow -up.   
 
The case report form package for  this study includes dedicated adverse event and serious adverse 
event forms. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will assess and adjudicate all 
SAEs and protocol violations.  
 
13. Participant  Termination  
Participant s will be advised that they may voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time and will 
107159 REV  A -  Clinical Protocol  
 Page 13 of 19 
 be instructed to notify the investigator immediately if they choose to withdraw. Participant s may 
choose to withdraw for any reason and are not obligated to reveal the ir reason(s) for withdrawal. 
Should Participant s withdraw prior to study  completion, they will be asked to co mplete the final 
evaluations . In addition, Participant s may be involuntarily withdrawn by [CONTACT_554971] e best interests of the Participant  (e.g., adverse event  that prevents 
further visits ).   
 
When the Participant  is discharged from the facility , the  End of Study CRF must be completed and 
submitted to the data manager as soon as possible.   
 
14. Data Collection , Management,  and Reporting  
Source documents will be used to record demographic  and assessment data  as well as any adverse 
events that may occur d uring the study period . Source document data will be transferred to case 
report forms that will be submitted to the data manager. Reports will be generated by [CONTACT_554972]. Ekso Bionics reserves the right to use a third -party data manager.  
15. Confidentiality o f Data  
All information and data sent to the Sponsor, Contract Research Organizations, DSMB, or the Data 
Manager  concerning Participant s or their participation in this study will be considered confidential. 
All data used in the analysis and reporting of this evaluation will be used in a manner without 
identifiable reference to the Participant . The principal investig ator consents to visits by [CONTACT_554973] s’ medical records including any test or laboratory data that might have 
been recorded on  diagnostic tests media (e.g., X -rays, video, photographs, etc.).  
16. Record Retention  
The study site is required to retain all study records required by [CONTACT_554974] a 
secure and safe facility. The study site must consult with the Sponsor bef ore disposal of any study 
records, and must notify the Sponsor of any change in the location, disposition or custody of the 
study files. The study site must take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of 
essential documents, that is, docum ents that individually and collectively permit evaluation of the 
conduct of a study and the quality of the data produced, including paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_44460] 
(e.g., patient charts) as well as any original source documents that are electronic as require d by 
[CONTACT_25435]. All study records must be retained for at least two years after 
the study is completed. Participant  files and other source data must be kept for the maximum 
period permitted by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_307], institution or private practice, but not less than two years. These 
documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if required by [CONTACT_554975]. The Sponsor must be notified and will assist with retention should the study site be 
unable to continue maintenance of Participant  files for the full two years. It is the responsibility of 
the study site to inform the Sponsor as to when t hese documents no longer need to be retained.  
 
17. Statistical Method s 
This is an observational, feasibility study; therefore, statistical methods will not be employed. Data 
will be reported as a number (n) of adverse events and categories of patient condition s will be 
assembled.

22. Potential Risks to Study Participant s and Mitigation of Risks  
1. The risk of falling: Having experienced therapi[INVESTIGATOR_554950].  
2. Risk of exceeding range of motion: This would be caused if any device moves the Participant  
beyond the normal range of motion, resulting in a strain, sprain or fracture.  For the Ekso 
device, this risk is lessened by [CONTACT_554978] a normal human range of motion even in the event of an electrical or software 
failure.   Software systems are also in place to further reduce range of motion to improve fit 
and comfort during walking.  Participant s will be evaluated by [CONTACT_554979] s from being included in the study if Participan ts cannot meet the required range 
of motion. For all other devices, this risk will be mitigated through proper settings by [CONTACT_242246][INVESTIGATOR_554951] s treatment.  
3. Discomfort, skin pressure/friction, bruising, pain, or unusual swelling caused by [CONTACT_554980]. This risk will be minimized by a thorough skin check performed by 
[CONTACT_554981]. Adjustments to the harness placement and 
additional padding will be assessed to decrease the risk  of skin breakdown as well.  
4. Blood pressure instability or heart arrhythmias related to standing or activity. This risk will 
be reduced by [CONTACT_554982], and as necessary 
during training and after.  
5. Reflex bowel or  bladder activity or autonomic instability during walking. This risk will be 
minimized by [CONTACT_554983] s to relieve bowels and bladder prior to walking.  
6. Spasms triggered by [CONTACT_405954]. This risk will be reduced through 
screening prior to enrollment in the study.  Participant s cannot take part if the Participant ’s 
muscles are too stiff.  
7. Any device used during this study could malfunction. In the event of device malfunction, 
Participant s will be able to safely transfer out of the de vice.  
8. There is a risk of fractures when participating in a therapy program: this will be minimized 
by [CONTACT_554984] s are at risk for severe osteoporosis.  
9. Risk from loss of confidentiality. To minimize this risk, Participant s w ill be assigned a 
unique numeric identifier to be included on test records and test documentation. Research 
information shared with people outside the study center will not include Participant s’ 
name, address, telephone number or any other direct personal identifier unless disclosure 
of the personal identifier is required by [CONTACT_2371]. Records may be viewed by [CONTACT_554985], study monitors and auditors (such as the IRB) who make sure that the 
study is being done properly.  
10. Muscle strains and tendon sprains and swelling due to joint misalignment during steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. 
To minimize this risk, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_554952]. 
The Ekso minimizes this risk by [CONTACT_554986], knee, and ankle only in the 
sagittal plane.  
 
23. Provisions for Research Related Harm/Injury  
[ADDRESS_728693] is unavailable.  
 
24. Non -Significant Risk  Determination .  
 
The EksoGT is a non -significant risk device in the context of this trial. The device is 510(k) cleared 
by [CONTACT_1622] (K161443) for individuals with  stroke or spi[INVESTIGATOR_32692] , and it is expected that this 
population of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554953] s will be less severely disabled than those for whom the 
device is currently intended.  Users must meet functional requirements, including but not limited to 
sufficient upper body strength to control a walking aid such as a walker, crutches, or a cane. Users 
must also obtain physician clearance of health status prior to inclusion. Fu rther, the EksoGT has a 
number of safeguards to minimize risk to patients and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], as outlined below, and is used 
under the supervision of a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_554954] [ADDRESS_728694] stops at the limits of healthy Participant  ranges of 
motion to prevent powering the joint of the user to a position that the joint cannot reach. The 
ranges of these joints were selected to provide for necessary functions such as standing, sitting, and 
walking. Redundant position sensing on all of the actuated joints ensures that the motors are 
always controlled using reliable sensor information. In addition, the device has numerous sensor, 
motor, and software monitoring systems. If an abnormality is detected (i.e. , excess joint speed or 
force, or i f redundant sensors do not agree) then the device will enter a safe mode, which prevents 
continued walking and enables the physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_554947]. The device is 
also equipped with fail -safe brakes on the actuated knee joints, such that if the device loses power 
or is shut down (as in safe mode) for any reason , the knees will continue to support the patient. 
Finally, an emergency disable button is available to instantly shut down the device for any reason. 
This is implemented via har dware, so it is effective even during a software malfunction.   
 
25. Potential Benefits of Participation  
This study affords individuals an opportunity to undergo  physical  training when they may not have 
otherwise done so. Participant s may also make improvement s physiologically, psychologically, as 
well as in physical performance, specifically walking.  
 
26. Monitoring Procedures  
Study monitoring will be performed in accordance with sponsor  procedures, or those approved by 
[CONTACT_3211] . The clinical department will have overall management responsibility for this study. In 
addition , the clinical department will direct regional monitoring staff, and may serve as clinical 
study monitors, study administrators, and/or have oversight responsibility for data review and 
data  integrity. Ekso Bionics  may engage the services of one or more qualified organizations or 
individuals to perform monitoring and data management functions, and provide participating sites 
with relevant contact [CONTACT_3031], as necessary. Study monitors may change periodically over the 
course of this study. All monitors will be qualified to perform their assigned responsibilities, and 
participating investigators/site personnel will be notified of any changes as they occur.  
 
On-site monitoring of all participa ting sites will be frequent enough to assure continued 
acceptability of the data by [CONTACT_554987], adherence to data 
107159 REV  A -  Clinical Protocol  
 Page 17 of 19 
 collection procedures, and maintenance of study records.  Scheduled site visits may  include, but are 
not limited to, the following:  
 
• Site Initiation V isit. An initiation visit will be conducted by [CONTACT_554988] , review the progression strategy  for both groups , undergo an evaluation of 
the site’s training status and refres h as required, and discuss  source document  / CRF 
completion and transmittal procedures. Alternatively, a meeting may be conducted for 
several sites at a common location.  
• Interim Monitoring Site V isit. On-site monitoring visits will be conducted at all sites to 
assess the progress of the study and id entify any concerns that result from review of the 
study records, study management documents, or Participant  informed consent documents.  
To assure the integrity of the data, a representative number of individual Participant  
records and other supporting source documents will be compared to CRFs completed at the 
site to determine that:  
o The study protocol is being followed, and only eligible Participant s are being 
enrolled; variances, if they occur, are recorded and reported as appropriate . 
o Informed consent i s properly documented .  
o Adverse events are being reported appropriately . 
o Information recorded on CRFs is complete, accurate and legible . 
o Missed follow -up visits and multiple attempts to contact [CONTACT_554989] . 
o Participant s failing to complete the clinical study and the reason for failure are 
properly recorded  
 
• Final Monitoring / Close -out Site Visit.  At the close of the study, appropriately trained 
personnel appointed by [CONTACT_220549] a close -out process via the t elephone or 
on-site. The purpose of this visit is to collect all outstanding study data documents, ensure 
that the investigator's files are accurate and complete, review  record retention 
requirements , provide for appropriate disposition of any remaining su pplies, and ensure 
that all applicable requirements are met for the study. The observations and actions made 
during this procedure will be documented and communicated to the investigator.  
 
27. Publication  
Manuscripts, abstracts, posters, or other informational materials may be presented at scientific 
meetings, or published in professional journals . The Sponsor reserves the right to publish the 
results on a smaller  sample size. This study will be listed on clinical trials.gov. Therefore, results 
will be published per FDA requirements.

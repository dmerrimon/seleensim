 1.0 Background  
 
Neurotransmitters are the chemical (compounds) messengers produced by [CONTACT_824825]. The h uman brain has its own 
neurotransmitter systems that  play a crucial role in our cognitive and behavioral functions. 
Thus far, hundreds  of neurotransmitters  have been identified  and more remain 
undiscovered.  Among these, Anandamide (AEA) and Brain -derived neurotrophic factor 
(BDNF)  are two neurotransmitters that  are important in regulating mental mood and 
psychological wellbeing as well as physical health.  
 
Samyama is an intensive eight -day residential program with meditations that provide the 
experiential possibility to free one self from and purify the body -mind  to receive higher 
levels of energy. Samyama presents the potential for participants to reach heightened levels 
of consciousness and experience explosive states of meditativeness in the pre sence of a 
self-realized yogi. Samyama is a state where you reach h eightened level of awareness. 
Many previous participants have reported feelings of bliss, intense joy, and oneness with 
others.  
 
In this program, participants would have gone through other forms of meditation training  
from the same school of yoga. They ar e required to prepare themselves for over sixty days 
prior to comi ng to the 8 -day silence treat. Preparatory steps include dietary regulations such 
as (vegan diet, adding more greens to their food in a stepwise manner), postural (Hatha) 
yoga practices , and  meditation practices. At the silence treat, participants practice one point 
concentration with guidance. In the practice of concentration, which precedes meditation, 
participants  learn how to slow down the thinking proce ss by [CONTACT_824826] a single 
object. The participants also learn to focus and watch their breath in closed eye states. 
Extended per iods of concentration naturally lead to meditation.  The Samyama  program is 
offered once a year and has taken place for over 25 years and is executed under ca reful 
guidance of an advanced yogi.  
 
 
2.0 Rationale and Specific Aims  
 
Samyama  participants often report a state of blissfulness, ecstasy, intense happi[INVESTIGATOR_008], 
inclusive perception or higher states of consciousness during and after the program.  
The positive effects of contemplative practices such as yoga and meditation on mind -body 
wellbeing are well known and reporte d [1, 2] . However, the exact neural mechanisms 
through which each of these practices create these physiological and psychological 
beneficial effects are not completely understood.  
 
The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect s of Samyama  program on blood levels 
of selected neurotransmitters before and after the progra m, and associate with 
corresponding effects on mind/psyche  before and after the program  in adult participants.  
 
 
Version Date 3.6.18  
  
Hypothesis:  
1. The state of higher consciousness and ecstasy resulting from Samyama  result from 
increased levels of Anandamide , an endocannabinoid, and Brain Derived 
Neurotrophic Factor  (BDNF) .  
2. The 60 -day preparatory phase that includes dietary regulation and yogic prac tices 
will reduce the gut inflammation and thereby [CONTACT_824827].   
3. Assessment of the neurophysiological (EEG and MRI) changes with meditative breath 
watching before and after Samyama  
a) Changes in EEG patterns (frequency shift and source ide ntification)  
b) Changes in neuroconnectivity (default mode network activity)  
 
Part A:  
 
Anandamide (AEA)  activates endocannabinoid -1 (eCB1 ) receptors in the central nervous 
system and eCB2 receptors throughout the body and studies have suggested its role in 
regulating mood and behavior, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_824802], memory, pain, immune 
system, fertility and cancer inhibition  [3]. Endogenous a nandamide is mainly active at 
eCB1 receptor, which  is responsible for the experience of blissfulness, ecstasy and the 
elevated mood and wellbeing similar  to psychoactive effec ts reported in cannabis use. 
Anandamide is thought to be related to the experience of “runner’s high” due to intense 
physical activity  [4]. So far, no study has explored the effect of yoga and meditation on 
endogenous levels of anandamide in humans.   However, Anandamide  is very quickly 
catabolized in the human system by [CONTACT_824828] (FAAH)  [5]. So, to 
control for this we propose to use FAAH inhibitor in the sampling tube to preserve  and 
accurately measure  anandamide . 
 
Brain -derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)  is another neurotransmitter found in the 
brain and the rest of the b ody. It helps in survival of existing neurons and growth of new 
neurons. It is involved in regulation of other neurotransmitters, long-term memory, stable 
memory function and cognitive function  [6, 7] . Studies have suggested negative 
correlations between BDNF levels and disease such as depression, schizophrenia, 
obsessive -compulsive disorder, Alzheimer's disease, anorexia and dementia. Studies have 
shown beneficial increase in BDNF levels in human s ubjects because  of yoga and 
meditation practices  [8].  
 
It is also expected that the participants will have varying responses of happi[INVESTIGATOR_824803] , Samyama . 
We hypothesize that the elevated mood and sense of wellbeing reported by [CONTACT_824829]:  
 
1. Increased levels of Anandamide and/ or BDNF  levels in the bloodstream.  
2. Decreased/delayed inhibition of these factors and hence, enhanced/prolonged effect  
(e.g., low levels of endogenous FAAH is associated with higher levels of 
anandamine) . 
Version Date 3.6.18  
 3.  Genetic variations (CB1, FAAH and other genes),  and a ltered gene expression s, 
whic h would influence anandamide and FAAH levels and effects and function of 
CB1 receptors.  
 
We will also explore other bio -markers and gene expressions  (transcriptomics, DNA 
methylation, etc.) that are associated with bliss and oneness feelings of meditation .  
Microbiome analysis:   Participants will also be requested for stool samples prior to , or 
early into  the start of preparatory steps ( approximately  60 days before the scheduled 
program start) , within 2.[ADDRESS_1143811] vegan diet and the preparatory steps along with the Samyama 
meditation program is hypothesized to reduce the gut inflammation and improve the gut 
microbiome.  
 
Gut Inflammation analysis:  We will explore the relatio ns between perceived stress, blood 
cortisol, plasma tryptophan catabolites (i.e., kynureine and quinolinic acid),  and cytokines 
potentially related to UC (GM -CSF, Eotaxin, IFN -α, IP -10, IFN -γ, MCP -1, IL -1β, MIG,

Transcriptome analysis  (RNA sequencing – gene expression analyses): Peripheral 
blood from participants will be collected before and after Samyama in PAXgene Blood 
RNA T ubes (Qiagen) . Upon RNA extraction, RNA quantity will be assessed with 
Nanodrop (Nanodrop Technologies) and quality with the Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent 
Technologies). RNA samples will be cleaned using DNAse I kit according to the Rapid out 
removal DNA ki t instruction (Thermoscientific) and will be converted into cDNA by [CONTACT_824830] 3’ Fwd Library Prep Kit (Lexogen) according to manufacturer's 
instruction to generate compatible library for Illumina sequencing. cDNA libraries will be 
assessed usi ng TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, [LOCATION_003]) before [ADDRESS_1143812] pi[INVESTIGATOR_824804].  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_330082]  (DNA methylation ): DNA from p eripheral blood of participants will 
be examined for integrity by [CONTACT_824831] a double stranded DNA (BR) a ssay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). About 500 ng of the 
sampled DNA will be  analyzed on a Infinium® MethylationEPIC Bead Chip (Illumina, San 
Diego, CA). The hybridized and stained arrays will be  ultimately scanned us ing HiScanSQ 
system (Illumina). Infinium Met hylationEPIC (EPIC) BeadChip from Illumina will 
evaluate over 850,[ADDRESS_1143813] pi[INVESTIGATOR_32042].

Participants who choose to participate in the optional blood draws  will have two blood 
sample s drawn prior to beginning the advance meditation program and two blood draw s 
Version Date 3.6.18  
 after completing the program  (potential total of 4 blood draws) .  Approximately 15 ml of 
blood will be collected each time and s eparated into different sampling tubes for measuring 
blood  levels of HbA1c, lipid profile, C -Reaction Protein, Cortisol, pro -inflammatory 
cytokines, AEA , endocannabinoid metabolites and  BDNF  (2 ml) ; gen otypi[INVESTIGATOR_824809] (3 ml) and the remaining 5 ml for future biomarker measurements. This 
blood sample will be labelled with a code for confidentiality of participants. The biomarker 
samples (AEA, BDNF) will be sent to Indiana University.  Samples may also be sent off 
to other specialty labs for additional analysis  including, but not limited to  labs in Denver, 
Colorado ; Lincoln Memorial University Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_1800]/Metabolomics Laboratory (422, 
Hamilton Math and Science Building, [ADDRESS_1143818], Harrogate, TN);  
Gainesville, [LOCATION_012]; or San Diego, [LOCATION_004] . Genetic and future biomarker samples will 
be stored at the PI’s Indiana University lab facilities.  
 
Pre-preparatory period  or early into the pre -preparatory period,  (approximately 60 days 
before the program) , immediately pre -Samyama (day of to up to 2.5 w eeks prior) and 1-[ADDRESS_1143819] Samyama , different validated happi[INVESTIGATOR_008], anxiety and 
depression scales (please see appendix) will be administered using electronic survey  tools. 
Please see below for the links of surveys.   CES-D, MAAS, PWB,  EDA -SF8a, and 
Happi[INVESTIGATOR_824810]-preparatory, Pre -Samyama and Post -Samyama 
(1-[ADDRESS_1143820] ).  Additional questions regarding the participants’ 
gender, race, diet, yoga practice, bowel movements, allergies, medi cal conditions, 
medications, dietary restrictions and overall health/well -being will be included in the 
surveys.   Those who agree to participate in the stool and/or at home blood draws will be 
asked for their contact [CONTACT_824835].  
 
Optional Stool Samples  
For Microbiome analysis, stool samples will be collected via snail -mailed sample 
containers with stamped envelopes to be returned to the main study center  and/or 
participants may bring the pre -program samples with them to Isha and give to study team 
member , or provide these samples to the phlebotomist drawing blood (if applicable) . An 
instruction sheet will be attached to these boxes. Participation is entir ely voluntary and it 
is not required that all p articipants in other arms of the study should also provide stool 
samples.  
 
Fecal Microbiome Whole Metagenome Sequencing: Whole metagenomic sequencing 
(WMS) will be performed using the MiSeq Illumina platform a s previously described50, 51. 
WMS allows for the identification of archael, fungal, bacteria, viral, and human DNA and 
predicts metabolic functionality.  Although we acknowledge viruses and fungi al so play a 
role in microbial ecology and response to diet, we will initially focus on microbial species 
and functional changes related to metabolite production (i.e., SCFA such as butyrate).  
Sequencing reads will be assembled into contigs with the Ray de novo assembler52.  Reads 
from individual samples will be mapped to >5 kb assembled contigs using Bowtie -253. 
Processing and visualization of mapped reads will be done using An vi’o54 which is a 
multifunctional platform for in -depth processing and exploration of ‘omics datasets, with 
features including metagenomic binning, taxonomic classification, functional annotation, 
gene and metagenomic  bin quantification, and data visualization.  Anvi’o uses well -
Version Date 3.6.18  
 established bioinformatics tools in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_824811]55, HMMer56, and Prodigal57. 
SCFAs:  SCFA will be measured in stool samples by [CONTACT_48577]. Serum 
Metabolomics:  Metabolomics analysis provides a snapshot of an organism’s current 
metabolite profile. Sample preparation and metabolomics analysis will be performed  
according to our previous work58. Briefly, serum samples will be prepared, including 
filtering and pH standardization and then all nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 
experiments performed on a Bruker Advance 600 spec trometer (Bruker Biospin, Milton, 
Canada). Processed spectra will be imported into Chenomx NMR Suite software 
(Edmonton, AB) for metabolite identification and quantification. To describe the 
metabolite changes in the context of other physiological changes,  metabolomics data will 
be integrated with the other biological variables assessed using O2PLS -DA (orthogonal 
partial least squares discriminatory analysis) modeling58,59.  
 
Serum Inflammatory Cytokines : Serum cytokines will be measured using a multiplex 
commercial flow -based 25 cytokine assay (Luminex, Thermo Fisher). Cytokines to be 
measured are GM -CSF, Eotaxin, IFN -α, IP -10, IFN -γ, MCP -1, IL -1β, MIG, IL -1RA, MIP -
1α, IL -2, MIP -1β, IL -2R, RANTE S, IL -4, IL -5, IL -6, IL -7, IL -8, IL -10, IL -12 (p40/p70), 
IL-13, IL -15, IL -17, and TNF -α.

 7.0  Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
 
A participant may withdraw at any time from the study by [CONTACT_824839].  
Participation in  this study is voluntary. Participation in the blood draw part of the study is 
optional  as is the stool sample.   Participants who did not participate in the at home pre - 
blood draw may still choose to take part in the 2 blood draws (before and after Samyam a 
Program) at IIIS.  Only those participants who had pre - at home blood draws will be invited 
to have the post program at home blood draws.  
 
 
8.0 Statistical Considerations  
 
This is a preliminary study on the endocannabinoid system’s changes with meditation.  
Such a study  has not been done previously. We will do descriptive statistics comparing 
before and after Samyama  biomarkers, genetic differences and correlate changes with the 
participants before and after Samyama  questionnaire data. This study ’s data will be used 
to develop additional hypothesis for future larger studies  to objectively show physiological 
and psychological benefits of meditation . 
 
9.0 Privacy/Confidentiality Issues  
 
Blood samples will not have PHI associated with them.  Unique codes will be assi gned to 
de-identify participants and materials that are shared with sources outside of the research 
team involved in the study.   
 
10.[ADDRESS_1143824] -Samyama  electronic  questionnaire follow -ups will be done via email as well.  
 
Records will be maintained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_30496]. De -identified data will be used 
for data analyses, and publications.  
 
 
Part B:  
 
The primary aim of Part B of the study is to study the changes in EEG patterns during breath 
watching associated with the 8 -days Samyama program. fMRI will be used to qualitatively 
describe the anatomical changes and functional changes including the DMN ac tivity 
associated with breath watching before and after the Samyama program.  
 
EEG: Studies have shown that EEG can be used to explore the temporal relation between 
measures of functional connectivity network integration and meditation quality15. van 
Lutterveld et al studied the functional connectivity with the help of Minimum spanning tree 
(MST) and graph measures. It has high temporal resolution of the order of milliseconds.  
 
Version Date 3.6.[ADDRESS_1143825] consistently altered brain regions were the left 
rostrolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior/mid cingulate cort ex, anterior insula, 
primary/secondary somatomotor cortices inferior temporal gyrus, and hippocampus18. Insula 
is consistently linked to interoception -awareness of the body’s internal and visceral states, 
including respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], heart rate, emotional self -awareness, and potentially metacognitive 
awareness19,20. Somatosensory areas are also altered by [CONTACT_213102].  
 
Examine the EEG changes associated with 8 -day advanced meditation, Samyama 
program. This includes,  
 EEG patterns at rest  
 EEG patterns during Meditat ive Breath watching  
 EEG patterns during ‘Shoonya’ meditation  
 
fMRI:  Functional MRI is a useful non -invasive tool to study brain neuronal activity.  
Several resting state functional MRI (rs -fMRI) networks have been described. These 
networks are temporally connected regions of brain activation. One of the major rs -fMRI 
networks is the Default Mode Network (DMN), which has shown changes with meditation 
training21.  
Default -mode network (DMN) r efers to the neural activity in a network of brain areas that 
support self -referential processing22. The group of brain regions that has collectively been 
termed the “default network” includes, most prominently, the medial prefrontal cortex 
(PFC), posterio r cingulate cortex/precuneus region, and the temporoparietal junction23. 
This network has been associated with processes ranging from attentional lapses to anxiety 
to clinical disorders, such as attention -deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 
Alzheimer 's Disease24, 25. Gilbert et al. recently argued that activations in the medial PFC 
part of the default network may reflect stimulus -related thought such as enhanced 
watchfulness toward the external environment that is also likely to occur during highly 
practiced tasks26. We postulate that there will be decrease in the default mode network 
activity after the Samyama program with increase being in the moment experiences.  
 
Examine the qualitative fMRI changes associated with 8 -day advanced meditation, 
Samyama  program. This would specifically examine the resting state neuroconnectivity, 
in particular the ‘default mode network’. Anatomical changes such as grey matter volume 
and insular thickness will also be analyzed. fMRI changes with meditative breath watching  
will also be recorded and analysed.

12.0 Enrollment  
 
Recruitment will occur from the interested subjects of  Indianapolis and nearby [CONTACT_824840] -sciences, 
Tennessee, [LOCATION_003]27. Recruitment will occur via communication modalities (email 
communications to participants and controls through the Isha Foundation that conducts this 
Samyama program) used by [CONTACT_824841].  
Subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_824842].  
When interested subjects contact [CONTACT_3476], the study will be d iscussed and the subject 
will undergo prescreening for eligibility via phone. If the subject meets eligibility criteria, an 
appointment for the first EEG and fMRI will be scheduled.  
 
Study procedures : 
 
Functional brain imaging and EEG studies will be carried out between March 12 and 
March 29, 2018 (before Samyama), and between April 9th and May 9th, 2018 (after 
Samyama)  
 
1) EEG  
Subjects will undergo a resting EEG at baseline. This will occur within a time window of 
2 weeks prior to the Samyama retreat. EEG will again be repeated within a month after the 
8 day retreat.  
 
The EEG recording will occur in 4 phases, with and without ta sk engagements, which will 
occur in alternative sequence. The tasks in this particular study will be slow meditative 
Version Date 3.6.18  
 slow breathing and ‘Shoonya’ meditation. The following sequence will be instructed to the 
study participants during the EEG recording:  
1) [ADDRESS_1143826]  
2) 10 minutes of breath watching as it happens during their Stage 4 Shambhavi 
meditation  
3) [ADDRESS_1143827]  
4) 10 minutes of ‘Shoonya’ meditation (optional as it requires empty stomach 
conditions)  
 
Meditative Slow Breathing is a common practice wi thin yoga and some meditative practice 
traditions; it is known to reduce psychophysiological arousal and stress activation, 
specifically reducing sympathetic drive, enhancing parasympathetic activation, increasing 
heart rate variability, reducing emotional  activity, and improving calmness and well -being. 
‘Shoonya’ meditation is an effortless process of conscious undoing.  
 
The ENOBIO EEG device is an FDA approved  device under US federal law which is a 24 -
bit EEG data reader at the rate of 500 S/s which comes  as a wearable wireless 
electrophysiology sensor system. It includes spectrogram and 3D visualization in real time 
for spectral features. It also collects triaxial acclereometer data. These data are stored in 
microSD offline in Holter mode28. This EEG comm unicates via wireless allowing the 
subjects to be in a comfortable position and also can reduce the effects of electrical 
interference.  
 
2) Functional Brain Imaging ( fMRI)  
 
fMRI Data Acquisition:  
The anatomical and functional imaging will be performed using 3 Tesla Siemens PRISMA 
scanners using a 32 channel head coil.  Imaging, including set up time will be 
approximately 30 min. Imaging sequences are as follows:  
 
MRI images from the scanner will be deidentified and stored in the Center for 
Neuroimaging repository.   Sequence  Parameters

RISKS OF TAKING PART IN THE STUDY  
 
There is a potential risk of loss of confidentiality. We will take precautions to keep the 
information secure.  
 
The MRI  scan is a safe procedure  with minimal risks.  The MRI  scanner  uses a powerful  
magnet  to obtain  pi[INVESTIGATOR_824817] X-rays.  Subjects  will be  asked  questions  
before  the MRI  to ensure that  there  is no reason  to prevent  them  from  having  the scan.  
 
Due to the fields, which are present in the MRI scanner, loose magnetic objects (pocket 
knives key chains, necklaces, earrings, etc.) can fly into the magnet with great force if 
brought into the environment of the MRI scanner. Subjects will be asked to rem ove such 
objects from their clothes and body to prevent such an occurrence. There are some 
individuals who should not have an MRI scan. These include persons with some types of 
metallic implants, such as aneurysm clips or some types of prostheses (fake body parts), or 
persons with electronic implants, such as cardiac pace makers. The magnetic field in the 
scanner can cause displacement or malfunction of these devices.  
 
Women who  are pregnant  should  not participate.  If subject is  a woman  of child­bearing 
potential,  subject  would  be advised  that the risks  of MRI  to a fetus  are possible,  but as yet 
unidentified.  
 
Other potential risks are:  
 
Collision hazard .  The magnetic field near the MR scanner is strong enough to attract 
objects containing iron with great force. Near the magnet, this force can be strong enough 
to pull objects in and cause them to fly down into the magnet. Such objects can become 
projectiles that can cause injury or death. We have e stablished a security zone to prevent 
objects containing iron  from coming into proximity of the magnet.  
 
Radio -wave effects . If metal wires or electrodes, such as electrocardiograph (ECG) 
leads, are attach ed to a person  being  imaged,  the radio -wave  energy  radiated  by [CONTACT_824843] 3.6.[ADDRESS_1143828] experienced minor nerve stimulation effects, such as muscle 
twitches and tingling sensations. There are no know risks associated with these effects. The 
devices used in our research create varying magnetic fields that are within the limits 
specified by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA).  
 
Claust rophobia . The confining  conditions  of the MR scanner  can cause  claustrophobia  
(the feeling of being "closed in") in some people. If subjects  experience claustrophobia 
during the scan, they can request the scan be stopped . 
 
Hearing:  The MRI scanner produces tappi[INVESTIGATOR_173194], which may reach 
objectionable levels. To minimize  any discomfort, subjects will be provided with noise 
reducing disposable earplugs or headphones.  
 
EEG : Noninvasive EEG monitoring is considered a safe procedure. It has no associated 
discomfort, pain or electric shock. In rare instances, EEG can precipi[INVESTIGATOR_824818] a seizure disorder due to flashing of lights or deep breathing. Participants 
with history of seizures in last 3 months will not be recruited to minimize the risk. EEG will 
be performed by [CONTACT_358601] a wearable  wireless electrophysiology sensor 
system . 
 
13.0 Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problems involving Risk to 
Participants or Others  
 
The study interventions are non -invasive and minimal risk. Therefore, we will limit the 
scope of AE monitoring and r eporting to the following:  
 All Serious Adverse Events believed to be related to the study procedures  
 Unexpected, non -serious Adverse Events believed to be related to the study 
procedures  
14.0 Statistical Considerations  
 
a. Sample Size Justification:   Participants and volunteers from IN and nearby [CONTACT_824844]. This 
observational exploratory analysis will include 15 volunteer meditators to study the 
EEG changes. 10 meditators w ho do similar preparatory meditations but not 
participate in Samyama will serve as the control subjects for fMRI studies. fMRI will 
be performed on 15 meditators and 10 controls who meditate similarly but not 
participate in Samyama.  
  
b. Data Analysis : Contin uous data will be reported as means ± standard deviation or 
median (quartile 1, quartile 3) depending on distribution.  Normality will be assessed 
Version Date 3.6.[ADDRESS_1143829].  Categorical data will be reported as frequencies and 
proportions and assessed wi th a chi -square of Fisher’s exact test as appropriate.  SAS 
9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) will be used for all analyses, with two -sided p -
values < 0.05 considered statistically significant.   
 
15.0 Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
 
A participant may withdr aw at any time from the study by [CONTACT_824839]. 
Participation in this study is voluntary.

& Ryan, 2003; Osman, Lamis, Bagge, Freedenthal, & Barnes, 2016) . 
Osman et. al. (2016) find that the 5 -Item (below) is as reliable as the original 
MAAS. The Cronbach’s alpha score of the 5 -item is .88. The 5 -item scale is 
as follows:  
 
How often do you feel the following ways?  
1. It seems I am “running on automatic,” without much awareness of what I’m 
doing.  
2. I rush through activities without being really attentive to them.  
3. I get so focused on the goal I w ant to achieve that I lose touch with what I’m 
doing right now to get there.  
4. I do jobs or tasks automatically, without being aware of what I'm doing.   
5. I find myself doing things without paying attention.

the Self” (Ryan & Frederick, 1997) . Ryan and Frederick (2001)  considers 
vitality as an aspect of eudaimonic well -being and suggests that “as being 
vital and energetic is part of what it means to be fully functioning and 
psychologically well.” Vitality will be measured by [CONTACT_824847] (6 -Item)  (Bostic, Rubio, & Hood, 2000; Ryan & Frederick, 1 997).

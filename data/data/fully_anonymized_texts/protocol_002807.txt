1.01.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
 
Protocol title:  Phase  II trial of Nintedanib  in patients  with advanced  esophagogastric  
cancer  
Study  Objectives:  This is a phase  II study  of Nintedanib  in patients  with metastatic  or 
recurrent  esophagogastric  cancer.  The goal of the study  is to evaluate  
the efficacy  of Nintedanib,  an orally  available  triple  kinase  inhibitor  
targeting  the receptors  of the vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  
(VEGF),  platelet  derived  growth  factor  (PDGF), and  fibroblast growth  
factor (FGF) receptor pathways.  
 
The primary  endpoint  will be to evaluate  the 6-month  progression -free 
survival  (PFS)  of Nintedanib.  With a  total of [ADDRESS_343301]  89% 
power  to detect an improvement  in the 6  month  PFS from a historical  
control of 10% to 28%,  with a type I and II error rate  of 10%.  
Study  population:  Patients  with metastatic  or recurrent esophagogastric  adenocarcinoma  
will be eligible.   Patients  will be allowed  to have  up to a  maximum  of 
one prior chemotherapy  regimen  for metastatic  disease.   Patients  are 
allowed  to have  a maximum  of two prior regimens  if they previously  
received  neoadjuvant/adjuvant  chemotherapy  or chemoradiotherapy  
for their initial localized  disease.  
 
Study  design:  Single  institution,  open  label,  non-randomized,  single  arm phase  II 
 
Number  of patients:  32 
 
Study  drugs:  Nintedanib,  administered  orally  
 
Dose  and regimen:  Nintedanib  200mg  twice  daily administered  continuously.   Patients will 
continue  on treatment until progression  of disease.  Each  cycle  
consists  of 28 days.

2.1 OBJECTIVES AND  SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
 
Primary  objective : 
 
To evaluate  the 6-month  progression -free survival  (PFS) of Nintedanib  in patients  with 
metastatic  or recurrent  esophagogastric  adenocarcinoma.  
 
Secondary  objectives : 
 
1) To evaluate  the objective  response  rate, defined  as both complete response  (CR)  and 
partial  response  (PR), as measured  by [CONTACT_281756].  
 
2) To evaluate  the tolerability  and incidence  adverse  event  profile  of Nintedanib  in this 
patient  population.  
 
3) To perform  an exploratory  correlative  analysis  assessing  the relationship  of FGFR  
amplification  and overexpression  with progression  free survival  and response.  
 
 
 
3.[ADDRESS_343302]  common  cause  of cancer -related  death.1   In the U.S., the incidence          
of adenocarcinoma  of the distal esophagus, GE junction  and gastric  cardia  has increased  4% 
to 10% per year among U.S. men since  [ADDRESS_343303]  patients  with esophagogastric  cancer present  with stage  IV disease,  which  is incurable.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_281747], systemic  chemotherapy  can lead to a decrease  in cancer -related  symptoms and  
prolong survival.4-7 However,  even  with treatment,  for patients  with metastatic  or recurrent  
disease,  chemotherapy  results  in response  rates  in 20-40% of patients and  median  survivals  
of only 8-[ADDRESS_343304] supportive  care (BSC). Thuss -Patience  et al. 
compared  irinotecan  to BSC in the first phase  III trial of second -line therapy  in gastric  cancer.9   
The median  OS was 4mos with irinotecan  compared  to 2.4mos  in the BSC arm (HR 0.46,  
p=0.012)  With irinotecan  treatment, there  was a median  PFS of 2.5 mos (95% CI 1.6 - 3.9mo).  
In a large  Korean  trial, Kang  et al. compared  second -line docetaxel or irinotecan  vs          
BSC and showed  improved  OS with chemotherapy  5.3 mos vs 3.8mos  with BSC (HR 0.66,  
p=0.07);  there  was no survival difference  between  docetaxel  and irinotecan.10 Another trial by 
[CONTACT_281757]#:  14-094 A (5) 
Approved:  27-DEC -[ADDRESS_343305]-line 5FU/platinum.11 There  was no OS  or PFS difference  between  the two 
chemotherapy  agents.  Median  OS was 8.4mo  with irinotecan,  9.5mos  with paclitaxel  
(HR1.13, p=0.38).  The median  PFS for irinotecan  was 2.3 mos and 3.6 mos for paclitaxel.  
(HR1.14, p=0.33).   In this trial the estimated  6 month  PFS was 16% with irinotecan  and 
14.8%  with paclitaxel.   These  trials  have  established  a benefit  of 2nd line chemotherapy  in 
advanced  gastric  cancer  compared  to BSC alone.  
 
There  have  been  two large  trials  evaluating  targeted  agents  in the second  line setting.   The

showed  the 6  month  PFS with placebo  was 4.5%  and with ramucirumab  18%.  There  is an 
unmet need  in patients  with metastatic  and recurrent  EG cancer to discover  new novel  
agents.

as a prognostic  marker  and indicate  the expression  of VEGF  in tumors  correlates  with 
more  advanced  tumor  stage,  the presence  of nodal  and distant  metastasis,  and with a 
poorer  survival  outcome.21,22  In esophageal  adenocarcinoma,  increasing  VEGF  
expression  correlates  with the transition  from Barrett’s  esophagus  to high grade  dysplasia,  
and with the transition  from microinvasive  to locally  advanced  cancer.[ADDRESS_343311]  that angiogenesis  is a viable  target  for therapy  in advanced  esophagogastric  
cancer.  
 
Our group has  previously  performed  a multicenter  phase  II evaluation  of bevacizumab  and 
cisplatin/irinotecan  in patients  with advanced  gastric  and GE junction  adenocarcinoma.  
The addition  of bevacizumab  to cytotoxic  chemotherapy  significantly  improve  the time-to- 
progression  (8.3 months;  95% CI, 5.5 to 9.9 months)  and overall  survival  (12.3  months;  
95% CI, 11.3 to 17.2 months)  of patients  compared  to the historical  time-to-progression  of 
5 months.24 Therapy  was well tolerated,  although  a 6% incidence  of gastric  perforation  or 
near-perforation  and a 2% incidence  of myocardial infarction  were  noted.

serine/threonine  kinases  Raf-1. 
 
In our study  of Sorafenib in 2nd/3rd line setting  in patients  with metastatic  esophagogastric  
cancer,  we met the primary endpoint  of improving  2-month  progression -free survival.  The 
median  PFS was 3.6 mos (95%  CI 1.8 to 3.9 mos)  with a median  overall  survival of 8.8 
mos (95% CI, 5.9 to 11.1 months).  An ongoing  complete response  (44+ months) was 
observed  in a patient  with Stage  IV esophageal  adenocarcinoma  with biopsy  proven  
metastatic  neck  lymphadenopathy  who developed  recurrence  after prior  
chemoradiotherapy  and surgery. This  patient continues  to maintain  a complete  response.  
A second  patient with gastroesophageal  junction  adenocarcinoma  had protracted  stable

disease  in bulky  celiac  node disease  (26+ months).  The majority of tumors  tested  positive  
for phospho -ERK by [CONTACT_9064]  (26/32,  82%).  Twenty  of the 34 evaluable  
patients  (59%)  were  progression  free at 2 months  (p=0.08); with the pre-specified  Type  I 
and II error rates  of 10% and historical  2-month  PFS of 50% without  treatment, this  
regimen  shows  promise  and activity  in gastroesophageal  cancers.

progression.26 Among  the potential compensatory  mechanisms  include  upregulation  of the 
platelet -derived  growth  factor (PDGF) and  fibroblast growth  factor  (FGR)  pathways.27 The 
PDGF  receptor (PDGFR)  has a role in promot ing angiogenesis, tumor  growth  and metastasis  
by [CONTACT_281759]. The FGF receptor (FGFR) has  been  described  as a potential  escape  
mechanism with tumor cells switching  from VEGF  to FGF signaling  to attract  endothelial  
cells.[ADDRESS_343315] growth  factors  (FGFs)  and FGF receptors  (FGFRs) plays  a critical  
role in cell behaviors,  such as  proliferation,  differentiation,  migration and  survival,  and are  
fundamental to  embryonic  development, regulation  of angiogenesis, and skeletal  
development.28 The FGFR  ligands  belong  to the FGF family  comprising  of 18 secreted  
ligands -induced  dimerization  and bind to adap ter proteins.  Subsequent  downstream  
signaling  occurs  through  two main pathways  via the intracellular  receptor  substrates  FGFR  
substrate  2 and  phospholipase  C (PLC ), leading  ultimately to  upregulation  of the Ras- 
dependent  mitogen -activated  protein  kinase  (MAPK)  and Ras-independent  phosphoinositide  
3-kinase  (PI3K) -Akt signaling pathways).[ADDRESS_343316]  been  reported  in up to 7% of gastric  
cancers,  most  of which  are diffuse -type with relatively  poor prognosis.35,36  The presence  of 
FGFR2  gene  amplifications  in gastric  cancer is  associated  with sensitivity  to inhibition  of 
FGFR signaling  by [CONTACT_281760].23 The frequency of  FGFR1  and FGFR2  overexpression  is significantly  larger  than 
the frequency  of amplification in gastric  cancers,  which is reported  up to 41%,37,[ADDRESS_343317]  also been  shown  to

be associated  with high metastatic  potential,  aggressive  tumor  biology,  and poor 
outcomes.31,39 
 
Inhibition  of FGFR2  in gastric  cancers using  a novel multi -kinase  that specifically  targets  
FGFR  may provide  more  potent  inhibition  of the oncogenic pathways  and result  in improved  
therapeutic  efficacy than  seen  with other  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors. Nintedanib  with its 
favorable  toxicity  profile  and multi-kinase  targets  may make  this agent a promising  agent  and 
further development  of this agent  in esophagogastric  malignancies  is clearly  indicated.  
 
 
3.8 Nintedanib  
 
3.8.1  Pre-clinical rationale  
 
Nintedanib  is an orally  available  potent  small  molecule  triple  kinase  inhibitor  inhibiting  
VEGFR  1-3, FGFR  1-3 as well as PDGF  receptor   and ß in the low nanomolar  range.  
VEGFR -2 is considered  the crucial  receptor  involved  in initiation  of the formation  as well 
as the  maintenance  of tumor vasculature.  
 
In vivo experiments  demonstrated  good  anti-tumor  efficacy  at doses  of 50 – [ADDRESS_343318]  range  of differing  human  tumor  types.40 Furthermore,  established  
xenograft  tumors  rapi[INVESTIGATOR_281748].  Histological  examination  
of treated  tumors  showed  a marked  reduction  of tumor  vessel  density  by [CONTACT_3450]  
80%.[ADDRESS_343319]  on those  malignant  cells which  overexpress  PDGFR  and/or  FGFR  (e.g. H1703  
NSCLC  cells).[ADDRESS_343320]  investigated  the maximum  tolerated  dose  (MTD),  
safety,  and pharmacokinetics  (PK) of Nintedanib.32,34   Based  on the Phase  I dose  
escalation  trials with Nintedanib  monotherapy,  the maximum  tolerated  dose  was defined  
to be 250 mg  for twice  daily dosing  in Caucasians  and 200 mg  twice  daily in Japanese  
patients  with a manageable  safety  profile  in advanced  cancer  patients.  The studies  
revealed  that Nintedanib  is generally  well tolerated  with mild to moderate  adverse  effects  
such  as gastrointestinal  symptoms  (nausea,  diarrhea,  vomiting,  abdominal  pain)  and 
reversible  elevations  of liver enzymes.  Initial  signs  of clinical  activity  included  a complete  
response  in a patient  with renal  cell carcinoma,  2 partial  responses  observed  in patients  
with colorectal  and renal  cell carcinoma,  and a disease  stabilisation  seen  in 64% of 
patients for at least 2 treatment  cycles  (Mross  et al) 
 
Nintedanib  has been  studied  in a randomized  phase  II maintenance  trial following  
chemotherapy  in relapsed  ovarian  cancer.48 Patients  were  randomized  to either  
Nintedanib  or placebo  therapy  for 36 weeks.  The 36 week  PFS rates  were  16.3%  in the 
Nintedanib  group  and 5% in the placebo  group  (HR 0.65;  95% CI, 0.42-1.02).   The safety

profile  was similar  to what was reported  in the initial  trials.  The proportion  of patients  with 
any grade  3 or 4 adverse  events  was similar  between  the groups  (34.9%  for Nintedanib  
vs. 27.5%  placebo,  p=0.49).  However,  there  was more  grade  3 or 4 hepatotoxicity  in the 
Nintedanib  group  (51.2%)  compared  to placebo  (7.5%,  p<.001)  This clinical  activity  has 
lead to development  of a phase  III trial in which  Nintedanib  or placebo  in combination  with 
paclitaxel  and carboplatin  in the first line treatment  of ovarian  cancer  is being  evaluated  
(ClinicalTrials.gov  Identifier  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
 
 
3.8.3  Nintedanib in Non-Small -Cell Lung  Cancer  (NSCLC)  
 
The clinical  activity  of Nintedanib  in advanced  non-small  cell lung cancer  (NSCLC)  was 
first demonstrated  in a phase  I trial in combination  with pemetrexed  in patients  previously  
treated  with a platinum -based  regimen.46 In this dose  escalation  study  of continuous  
Nintedanib  with pemetrexed  500mg/m2  given  on day 1 over a 21 day cycle,  the MTD  dose  
was 200mg  BID in combination  with pemetrexed.  1 patient achieved  a complete  response  
44 days  after starting  treatment  and disease  stabilization  seen  in 50% as the best overall  
response.   Median  PFS was 5.4 months  for all patients.  
 
Nintedanib  was also studied  as a monotherapy  in NSCLC  patients  in a phase  II double - 
blind  study.49 In this study,  patients  were  randomized  to either  Nintedanib  250mg  BID or 
Nintedanib  150mg  BID, continuous  dosing  and assessed  at 6 week  intervals  until disease  
progression.  Disease  stabilization  was achieved  in 48% of patients  and there  was one 
confirmed  partial  response  seen  at the Nintedanib  250mg  BID dosing.  Tumour  
stabilisation  was achieved  in 46% of patients  (ECOG  0–1 patients:  59%),  with one 
confirmed  partial response  (250 mg BID).  
 
The most  commonly  reported  drug-related  adverse  events  were  nausea  (57.5%),  diarrhea  
(47.9%),  vomiting  (42.5%),  anorexia  (28.8%),   abdominal  pain (13.7%)   and reversible  
alanine  transaminase  (ALT,  13.7%)  and aspartate   aminotransferase  elevations  (AST,  
9.6%).  The transaminase  elevations  were  only seen  at the higher  dosing  of the 
medication.  
 
Based  on the  promising  phase  I and II results,  there  were  two multicenter phase  III studies  
evaluating  Nintedanib  200mg  BID in combination  with chemotherapy  in advanced  NSCLC:  
the LUME -Lung  [ADDRESS_343321] line therapy  (ClinicalTrials.gov  Identifier  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).50 The Nintedanib  plus docetaxel  group  had a significantly  PFS benefit  
(HR 0.79;  CI: 0.68,  0.92;  p=0.0019;  median  3.4 vs 2.7 months)  compared  to the docetaxel  
alone.  In subset  analysis,  the overall  survival  was increased  in the adenocarcinoma  
histology  (HR 0.83; p=0.0359; median  12.6 vs 10.3 month).  
 
The LUME -Lung  2 trial compared  Nintedanib  plus pemetrexed  compared  to placebo  plus 
pemetrexed  in patients  with advanced  nonsquamous  NSCLC  in the second  line setting

It is clear  that each  new targeted  agent,  with individual  variation  in what specific  targets  
are actually  affected,  needs  to be evaluated  in each  solid tumor.  Other  than Human  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_209839]  (HER2),  there  are no validated  treatment  targets  in 
esophagogastric  cancer.  Nintedanib  is of particular  interest  in esophagogastric  
malignancies  due to its ability  to simultaneously  target  the VEGFR,  PDGF,  and FGFR  
pathways,  which  have  been described  and implicated  in this disease.

7.0 RECRUITMENT  PLAN  
 
This will be a single  institution,  phase  II study.  Patient  with metastatic  or recurrent  
esophageal,  gastric,  and gastroesophageal  (GE) junction  cancer that are eligible  will be 
identified  for enrollment  from MSKCC  clinical practice  and clinic  lists.  No additional  
measures, e.g.  advertisement,  payment  to patients,  will be employed  to recruit  patients.  
Patients  will be accrued  to this study  without  regard  for gender  or minority  status.  
Inclusion  of women  and minorities  
The investigators  take due notice  of the NIH policy concerning  inclusion  of women  and 
minorities  in clinical research  populations.  There  will be no limitations  with regards  to race or 
gender.  
 
Our institutional demographics  for accrual  of patients  on esophageal  and GE junction  cancer  
trials  reflect the national incidence  of this disease.  10-15% of our patients  have  been  
women.   African -American  males  comprise  3-5% of patients  treated  on protocol.  Given  that 
our protocol  accrual  closely  reflects  the national  incidence  of this disease, no specific  
strategy  will be undertaken  to recruit  women  or persons  of color  on this trial. 
 
This protocol does  not include  children  because  the number  of children  with esophageal,  
gastric  and GE junction  cancer  is very small  and because  the majority  are already  accessed  
by a nation -wide pediatric  cancer research  network.  This statement is  based  on exclusion  4b

Involving  Human  Subjects.  
 
8.1 PRETREATMENT  EVALUATION  
 
To be completed  within  2 weeks  of study  entry:  
 
• History and  physical exam  including  vitals,  height,  weight,  performance  status.  
• Evaluation  of concomitant  medications  and toxicity  assessment.  
• Serum pregnancy  test for women  of childbearing  potential (WOCP)  
In addition, all  WOCP should  be instructed  to contact [CONTACT_281763].  
• Laboratory  evaluation  including  a complete  blood  count,  PT/PTT,  comprehensive  
chemistry  panel  (includes  BUN,  creatinine, ALT,  AST, albumin,  glucose, total  protein,  
calcium,  bilirubin,  bicarbonate,  sodium , chloride, potassium,  alkaline  phosphatase).  
 
To be completed  within  4 weeks  of study  entry:  
 
• Electrocardiogram  
• CT scan  or MRI documenting  all measurable  or evaluable  disease.  All measurable  
lesions  used  to define  response  must  be >10mm  in size. The primary tumor  is 
excluded.  Lesions  within  prior radiation  fields  are permitted  as long as these  lesions  
have  documented  progression  in size. 
 
To be completed any  time prior to starting  therapy:  
 
• Histological confirmation  of esophagogastric  adenocarcinoma  prior to study  
enrollment.  
• Available  tumor  tissue (20  unstained  slides  or tumor  block) will be submitted  for future  
molecular  analysis  (SEE  SECTION  10 “Correlative  Studies”)  but not be required  prior 
to registration.  Note:  if tissue  is depleted,  patient  will still be eligible  after discussion  
with the PI. 
 
 
9.1 TREATMENT/ INTERVENTION  PLAN  
 
9.2 Agent  administration  
 
Treatment will be administered  on an  outpatient basis.  Nintedanib  is supplied  as 100mg  and 
150mg  capsules. The  starting  dose  of Nintedanib is  200mg  orally twice  daily for 28 days  
continuously,  unless  interrupted  for intolerable  toxicity.  There  is no planned  interruption  
between  treatment  cycles  unless  clinically  indicated.  The cycle  start date  will coincide  with 
the physician  visit date.  Because  of the potential  need  for physician  visit scheduling  to vary 
(due to both physician  and patient issues), to avoid  violation  of, and deviation  from,  the 
protocol, physician  visits  may vary by [CONTACT_281764]  (1-14) days  from a strict 28 day 
schedule.  
Page  17 of 36 
Memorial Sloan  Kettering  Cancer Center  
IRB#:  14-094 A (5) 
Approved:  27-DEC -2016   
  
Nintedanib  will be taken  on days  1-28 of each  28-day cycle.   Patients will swallow  the soft gel 
capsule  whole  with approximately 250  mL of water  each  morning  and evening  after eating.  
The capsule  cannot  be crushed  or dissolved.  
 
In case  of misdosing,  patients  should  proceed  with the intake  of medication  according  to the 
predefined  schedule  and take the next scheduled  dose  when  it is due.  Patients  with emesis  
should  not take a replacement dose.  A study  diary will be completed  by [CONTACT_281765]  (see Appendix  I). 
 
 
Concomitant  Therapy  
The use of investigational  or anticancer agents  is not allowed  while  patients  are on this 
study.   However,  symptomati c treatment of tumor  associated  symptoms  is allowed;  such as  
radiation  therapy  with palliative  intent  and symptom  control,  provided  that radiation  does not 
affect target  lesions  and the reason  for radiation  does  not reflect progressive  disease.  
Concomitant  medication, or therapy  to provide  adequate  supportive  care, may be given  as 
necessary.  If concomitant therapy  is clinically  indicated,  patients  may temporarily  
discontinue  Nintedanib  therapy  and resume  treatment  following  consultation  with the treating  
physician  and Principal  Investigator.  
 
9.3 Dose  delay/modification  
 
Intrapatient dose  reduction  will be allowed  depending  on the type and severity of toxicity  
encountered  provided  that criteria  for patient  withdrawal  from study  treatment  have  not been  
met. The dose  levels  for Nintedanib  are as described  below:  
 
Starting  dose 0  Nintedanib  200mg  twice  daily 
Dose  level -1 Nintedanib  150mg  twice  daily 
Dose  level -2 Nintedanib  100mg  twice  daily 
If further  dose  reduction  is required, the patient should  be taken  off-protocol.  
 
If the dose  of Nintedanib is  reduced  due to toxicity,  it will stay at the lower  dose  level for the 
entire  time of administration  on protocol.  
 
Patients  who require  a treatment  delay  of ≥21 consecutive  days  should  also be taken  off- 
protocol.

Special warning  and precautions  for use: 
 
During  treatment with Nintedanib,  all study  patients  will be advised  to avoid  sun exposure  or 
artificial UVA/UVB  radiation  in solaria  or tanning  booths. If  exposure  to sunlight cannot be 
avoided,  protective  clothing  and broad  spectrum (UVA/UVB)  sunscreens  should  be used.  
After discontinuation  of Nintedanib  treatment all  protective  measures  should  be continued  for 
at least 2 weeks  
 
11.1 Definitions  of Adverse  Events  
 
Adverse  Event  
An adverse  event  (AE) shall mean  any untoward  medical occurrence,  including  an 
exacerbation  of a pre-existing  condition, in  a patient  or clinical investigation  subject  
administered  a pharmaceutical product. The medical  occurrence  does  not necessarily  have  a 
causal relationship  with the treatment.  
Serious  Adverse  Event  
 
A serious  adverse  event (SAE)  is defined  as any AE which  results  in death,  is immediately  
life-threatening, results  in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  requires  or prolongs  
patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  is a congenital  anomaly/birth  defect;  or based  upon  appropriate  
medical judgment, may jeopardize  the patient  and may require  medical or surgical  
intervention  to prevent  one of the other  outcomes  listed  in the above  definitions.  
 
Severity  of adverse  event  
The severity of adverse  event  should  be classified  and recorded  according  to the Common  
Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events  (CTCAE)  Version  4.[ADDRESS_343357]  be recorded  for each  adverse  event.  
 
Causality  will be reported  as either “Yes” or “No.”  
 
Yes: There  is a reasonable  causal  relationship  between  the investigational  product  
administered  and the AE 
 
No: There  is no  causal  relationship  between  the investigational  product  
administered  and the AE 
 
 
 
11.[ADDRESS_343358] one  of the following  criteria  is me: 
Page  25 of 36 
Memorial Sloan  Kettering  Cancer Center  
IRB#:  14-094 A (5) 
Approved:  27-DEC -2016   
  
• The worsening  of the disease  constitutes  an SAE 
• Additional treatment  is required,  i.e., concomitant medication  is added  or changed  
• An unexpected  deterioration  from baseline  has occurred  in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2339]  
 
11.3 Worsening  of pre-existing  conditions  
 
A pre-existing  condition  present  at baseline,  which  remains  unchanged  during  the trial, does  
not need  to be recorded  as adverse  event.   Any worsening  of any pre-existing  baseline  
condition  should  be recorded  as an adverse  event.  Examples  of worsening  of a pre-existing  
condition  that should  be recorded  as an  AE are given  below:  
 
• Worsening  of condition  meets  the criteria  for an SAE 
• Action  is taken  with the investigational  drug (i.e. dose  is reduced  of treatment is  
discontinued)  
• Treatment is  required  (concomitant medication  is added or changed)  
• The investigator  believes  a patient  has shown  a clear  deterioration  from baseline  
symptoms  
 
11.[ADDRESS_343359]’s  case record  form.  
 
Each  serious  adverse  event (SAE) must  be followed  up until resolution  or stabilization  by 
[CONTACT_281768].  An isolated  laboratory  abnormality  
that is  assigned  grade  4, according  to CTC definition,  is not reportable  as an SAE,  unless  the 
investigator assesses  that the even  meets  the standard  ICH criteria  for an SAE.  CTC grade  
4 baseline  laboratory  abnormalities  that are part of the disease  profile  should  not be reported  
as an  SAE, specifi cally when  they are allowed  or not excluded  by [CONTACT_281769]/exclusion  criteria.  
 
When  required, and  according  to local law and regulations,  serious  adverse  events  must  be 
reported  to the Ethics  Committee  and Regulatory  Authorities.  
 
12.0 CRITERIA  FOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
 
All patients  who receive  at least one week  of Nintedanib  will be evaluable  for toxicity  and 
response.  Patients  who are unable  to complete  one week  of therapy  will not be evaluated  for 
toxicity  or response  and will be replaced  by a new patient.  
12.[ADDRESS_343360]/MRI  assessment  and be re-evaluated  after two cycles,  
i.e., [ADDRESS_343361]/MRI  assessment may be performed  more  
frequently.  The same  imaging  modality  performed  at baseline  (CT or MRI)  will be repeated  at

IRB#:  14-094 A (5) 
Approved:  27-DEC -[ADDRESS_343362]  Response  Evaluation  Criteria  in Solid  Tumors  (RECIST)  criteria, version  1.1.[ADDRESS_343363]  1.1 criteria.  
12.2 Progression -free survival  
 
The primary  endpoint  is to evaluate  the 6-month  progression  free survival  (PFS);  hence  
patients  with evaluable  disease  by [CONTACT_281770]. This is defined  as the 
duration  of time from start of treatment to time of progression  or death  from any cause.  
Patients  who are taken  off-study  because  of drug-related  toxicity  or other  adverse  event  but 
who are alive and have  stable  or responding  disease  at the  time of trial discontinuation  will 
continue  to follow  per protocol,  however,  if they start another therapy, they  will be considered  
as failure  of therapy  at that time  and will be removed  from protocol.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_343364] response  recorded  from 
the start of treatment until  disease  progression/recurrence.  The patient ’s best response  
assignment will depend  on the  achievement  of both measurement  and confirmation  criteria  
by [CONTACT_281771]  (CR),  and partial response  (PR).  
 
The type, frequency,  severity,  timing,  and relationship  of each  adverse  event  will be 
determined  as per the NCI Common  Toxicity  Criteria,  version  3.0. Given  the small  sample  
size, the analysis  of correlative  biomarkers  will be exploratory and  hypothesis  generating.  
 
 
13.1 CRITERIA  FOR REMOVAL  FROM  STUDY  
 
If at any time, the patient develops  progressive  disease  he/she  will be taken  off study  and 
referred  for alternative  therapy.  If at any time the patient  develops  unacceptable  toxicity  that 
fails to resolve  after a maximum  treatment delay  of 4 weeks, he/she will be removed  from 
study.   Before  being  removed  from the study,  patients  will be scanned  to assess  the 
response.  If the off study  scan shows  progression  of disease  then the patient  will be 
considered  as a non-responder,  while  a CR or PR will be considered  as response.   A patient  
will be withdrawn  from the study  treatment  in the following  circumstances:  
 
• Patient  is no longer able  to participate  in the study  (e.g. AE, surgery,  concomitant  
diagnoses,  concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_245338]); in  such  a case  the 
Investigator’s  reason  for patient’s  removal must  be recorded  in CRDB.  
• Patient  withdrawal  of consents  or election  to discontinue  participation  in the trial. 
Page  27 of 36 
Memorial Sloan  Kettering  Cancer Center  
IRB#:  14-094 A (5) 
Approved:  27-DEC -2016   
  
• Significant deviation  from the protocol  or eligibility criteria; such  patients  will be 
considered  protocol  violations  and removed  from study.  
• Non-compliance  with study  or follow -up procedures.  
• Drug  related  AE(s) that have  not resolved  after 3 weeks  of treatment  interruption.  
Exception  to this in patients  who derive  obvious  clinical benefit  according  to the 
investigator’s  judgment could  be considered  upon discussion  with Principal  
Investigator.  The dose  reduction  scheme  provided  should  be followed  in this case.  
• Repeat  epi[INVESTIGATOR_281752]  100mg  
twice  daily dose.  
• Documented  progressive  disease.  
• Patients  who become  pregnant  while  on study.  
 
As soon  as a patient is  withdrawn from the study  treatment, the End of Treatment (EOT)  visit has to 
be performed  (not in  case  patient has  withdrawn  consent).   Every effort should  be made  to follow -up 
patients  in case  an adverse  event  is still ongoing  at the time of withdrawal.  
 
14.0 BIOSTATISTICS  
 
This is a single  institution,  open -label,  non-randomized,  single -arm phase  II evaluation. The primary  
objective  of this study  is to determine  the 6 month  progression  free survival  (PFS)  for patients  with 
advanced  or recurrent EG cancer treated  with Nintedanib  [ADDRESS_343365]  estimated  the 6 months  to be 4.5%  with placebo,  12% with 
everolimus  and 18%  for ramucirumab. Based  on this information,  a 6 month  PFS of 10% or less will 
be considered  unacceptable  while  28% or more  will be considered  promising.  Using  an exact  
binomial single  stage  design  we require  32 patients  to differentiate  between  6-month  PFS of 10% 
and 28% with type I and II error rates  of 10% each.  If [ADDRESS_343366]  89% 
power  to detect an improvement  in the response  rate from  5% to 20% with a one -sided  type I error 
rate of 10%.  We assume  an accrual  rate of 1-2 patients  per month  for study  duration  of 18-35 
months.  
 
 
Secondary endpoints  involve  an assessment  of the overall  response  rate (complete  and partial  
responses), as determined  by [CONTACT_281762].  Toxicities  will also be assessed  and tabulated.  
Correlative  analyses  will be exploratory in  nature.  We will assess  the relationship  between  FGFR  
amplification  (by [CONTACT_4656])  and FGFR  overexpression  (by [CONTACT_4658]) with progression  free survival  using  log- 
rank test.  Fisher’s  exact test will be employed  to assess  these  relationships  with response.

15.3 Randomization  
 
This research  study  does  not require  randomization  procedures.  
 
16.1 DATA  MANAGEMENT  ISSUES  
 
The principal  investigator [INVESTIGATOR_281753] a research  study  assistant  (RSA)  who will be assigned  to the study.  The 
responsibilities  of the RSA include  project compliance,  data collection,  abstraction  and entry,  
data reporting, regulatory  monitoring, problem resolution  and prioritization,  and coordination  
of the activities  of the protocol  study  team.  
 
The data collected  for this study  will be entered  into a secure  database.   Sour ce 
documentation  will be available  to support the computerized  patient record.  
 
16.2 Quality  Assurance  
 
Weekly  registration  reports  will be generated  to monitor  patient accruals  and completeness   
of registration  data.   Routine  data quality  reports  will be generated  to assess  missing  data 
and inconsistencies.  Accrual  rate and accuracy  of evaluations  and follow -up will be 
monitored  periodically  throughout the study  period  and potential problems will be brought to 
the attention  of the study  team.  Random -sample  data quality  and protocol  compliance  audits  
will be conducted  by [CONTACT_2362].  
 
16.3 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data  and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at Memorial Sloan -Kettering  Cancer Center  
were  approved  by [CONTACT_28642] 2001.  The plans  address  the 
new policies  set forth by [CONTACT_28643], “Policy  of the National Cancer  
Institute  for Data  and Safety Monitoring  of Clinical Trials”  which  can be  found  at:  
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html . The DSM  Plans  at MSKCC  were  
established  and are monitored  by [CONTACT_28644].  The MSKCC  Data  and

Safety Monitoring  Plans  can be  found  on the MKSCC  Intranet at:   
http://mskweb2.mkscc.org/irb/index.htm  
 
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by [CONTACT_28645], safety,  
and quality.   There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  protocol  
monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits, therapeutic  response, and  staff 
education  on clinical  research  QA) and departmental  procedures  for quality  control, plus  
there  are two institutional committees  that are  responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our 
clinical trials  programs.  The committees: Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for 
Phase  I and II clinical trials,  and the Data  and Safety Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III 
clinical trials,  report  to the Center’s  Research  Council  and Institutional Review  Board.  
 
During  the protocol  development and  review  process,  each  protocol  will be assessed  for 
level of risk and degree  of monitoring  required.  Every type  of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH sponsored,  
in-house  sponsored, industrial sponsored, NCI cooperative  group, etc.)  will be addressed  
and the monitoring  procedures  will be established  at the  time of protocol  activation.

Nintedanib  will be provided  free of charge.  Correlative  tests  will be performed  without  charge  
to the patient.  The patient  will be responsible  for the cost of standard  medical care and all 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  even  for complications  of treatment.  
 
No incentives  will be offered  to patients/subjects  to participate  in the study.  
 
Inclusion  of women  and minorities  
MSKCC  has file forms  HHS 44 (civil rights),  HHS 641 (handicapped  individual),  HHS 639-A 
(sex discrimination) and  HHS 680 (age discrimination); we also take due notice  of the 
NIH/ADAMHA  policy  concerning inclusion  of women  and minorities  in clinical research  
populations.   Patients of all races,  both males  and females, will be enrolled  into the protocol.  
In the [LOCATION_001] metropolitan  area,  there  are a high proportion  of minority  patients (e.g.  
African -American, Hispanic).  In general,  about  15% of patients  at MSKCC  are members  of 
minority  ethnic  groups.  We will actively  try to recruit minority  patients  to this protocol.  
 
Exclusion  of children  and lactating  or pregnant  women  
Children  are excluded  from this  protocol  because  there  is insufficient data  to determine  the 
safety  of Nintedanib  in children.  In addition, the incidence  of esophagogastric  cancer in  
children  is limited  and because  the majority  are already  access  by a nationwide  pediatric  
cancer research  network.   This statement is  based  on exclusion  4b for the NIH Policy  and 
Guidelines  on the  Inclus ion of Children  as Participants  in Research  Involving  Human

Subjects.   Similarly,  lactating  and pregnant women  are excluded  because  of the potential  
teratogenicity  and embryotoxicity  of Nintedanib.  
 
17.2 Privacy  
 
MSKCC’s  Privacy  Office  may allow  the use  and disclosure  of protected  health  information  
pursuant to a completed  and signed  Research  Authorization  form. The use and disclosure  of 
protected  health  information  will be limited  to the individuals  described  in the Research  
Authorization  form.  A Research  Authorization  form must  be completed  by [CONTACT_11097] [INVESTIGATOR_28611]  (IRB/PB).  
 
17.3 Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  Reporting  
 
Any SAE must  be reported  to the IRB/PB  as soon  as possible  but no later than 5 calendar  
days.  The IRB/PB  requires  a Clinical Research  Database  (CRDB)  SAE report  be submitted  
electronically  to the SAE Office  at [EMAIL_203] . The report  should  contain  the following  
information:  
 
Fields  populated  from CRDB:  
 
• Subject’s  name  (generate  the report with only initials  if it will be sent outside  of 
MSKCC)  
• Medical record  number  
• Disease/histology  (if applicable)  
• Protocol  number and  title 
Data  needing  to be  entered:  
• The date the adverse  event  occurred  
• The adverse  event  
• Relationship  of the adverse  event to the treatment (drug, device,  or intervention)  
• If the AE was expected  
• The severity of the AE 
• The intervention  
• Detailed  text that includes  the following  
o An explanation  of how the AE was handled.  
o A description  of the subject’s  condition . 
o Indication  if the subject remains  on the study.  
o If an amendment will need  to be made  to the protocol  and/or consent form.  
The PI’s signature  [CONTACT_28652].  
For IND/IDE  protocols:  
The CRDB  AE report should  be completed  as above  and the FDA assigned  IND/IDE  number  
written  at the top of the report.  If appropriate,  the report  will be forwarded  to the FDA by [CONTACT_11098].

17.3.1  Adverse  event  and serious  adverse  event  reporting  
 
Upon  inclusion  into a trial, the patient’s  condition  is assessed  (e.g. documentation  of 
history/concomitant diagnoses  and diseases),  and relevant  changes  from baseline  are noted  
subsequently.  
 
All adverse  events,  serious  and non-serious,  occurring  during  the course  of the clinical trial  
(i.e., from signing  the informed  consent  onwards  through  the trial follow -up period  of [ADDRESS_343368] administration  of the drug)  will be collected, documented  and reported  by 
[CONTACT_093].   For each  adverse  event, the investigator will provide  the onset  date, end  
date, intensity, treatment required,  outcome, seriousness, and  action  taken  with the 
investigational  drug.  The investigator  will determine  the relationship  and expectedness  with 
the investigational drug  to all AEs as defined  in the listed  adverse  event section  of 
Boehringer  Ingelheim’  s Investigator  Brochure  for the product.  
 
If not stipulated  differently  in the pharmacovigilance  agreement,  SAEs  are to be reported  to 
BI using  the BI IIS Serious  Adverse  Event  Report Form  including  a documented  causal  
relationship  assessment and  providing  as much  detail  regarding  the SAE as possible.  With 
receipt  of follow -up information, all  remaining  fields  on the SAE form are to be completed  or 
updated.  
 
 
17.3.[ADDRESS_343369]  
The following  events  are considered  as Protocol -specified  events  of special  interests:  
 
Any gastrointestinal - and non -gastrointestinal perforation, leakage, fistula  formation,  
abscess  
In such  case  the following  additional information  need  to be collected,  documented  in the 
respective  comment field  of the CRF page  and the respective  narratives  of the SAE.  That 
has to be forwarded  to Boehringer Ingelheim:  
• Location  of perforation, leakage, fistula, abscess  
• Location/extent of abdominal  tumor manifestations  
• Imaging  & reports  (CT, ultrasound, endoscopy, pathology,  etc.) 
• Prior  surgery (location,  wound  healing  complications)  
• Concomitant diseases  with GI involvement (e.g.,  M Crohn,  vasculitis,  tuberculosis,  
diverticulitis)  
• Thromboembolic  events  (or predisposition)  
 
Drug -induced  liver injury  (DILI)  
 
Drug -induced  liver injury  is under constant surveillance  by [CONTACT_281772]  a protocol -specified  adverse  event  of special interest (AESI). Timely  detection,  
evaluation,  and follow -up of laboratory  alterations  of selected  liver laboratory  parameters  to 
distinguish  an effect  of the investigational  drug from other causes  are important  for patient  
safety  and for the medical and  scientific  interpretation  of the finding.  
 
The following  are considered  as protocol -specified  AESI:  
• An elevation  of ALT and / or AST > 5x ULN without  bilirubin  elevation  measured  in the 
same  blood  draw  sample  
Page  32 of 36 
Memorial Sloan  Kettering  Cancer Center  
IRB#:  14-094 A (5) 
Approved:  27-DEC -2016   
  
• An elevation  of AST and/or  ALT >2.[ADDRESS_343370] combined  with an elevation  of bilirubin  
to >1.[ADDRESS_343371]  been  met and according  to Appendix  II of this clinical trial  
protocol.  
 
Protocol -specified  AESI  are to be  reported  in an expedited  manner similar to Serious  
Adverse  Events,  even  if they do not meet  any of the seriousness  criteria.  
 
17.3.3  Responsibilities  for SAE reporting  
The investigator  shall report all  SAEs,  non-serious  AEs occurring  at the  same  time and/or  
which  are medically  related  to the SAE and AEs of Special Interests  independent from their  
seriousness  to Boehringer Ingelheim  Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In the event  of such  an event,  
the inves tigator should  refer to the Pharmacovigilance  section  of the contract for reporting  
procedures.  
 
 
The investigator  shall report all  SAEs,  non-serious  AEs relevant  to a reported  SAE,  and AEs 
of Special Interest  by [CONTACT_281773]:

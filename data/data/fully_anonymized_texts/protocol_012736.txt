1.0 Objectives
1.1 Study Objectives
Tobacco smoking is the leading preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality in the United 
States [1], and cessation provides immediate and sustained improvement in health and quality of life [2]. Nicotine is the primary addictive substance in cigarettes, and cigarettes smoked in the [LOCATION_002] typi[INVESTIGATOR_264372] 11 mg of nicotine [3-5]. It should be noted that the nicotine content of a cigarette is a different concept than the “nicotine yield” as measured by a smoking machine, and which was previously printed on cigarette packs. It is now known that the main factor affecting the machine-smoked nicotine yield in current commercially available cigarettes is the amount of ventilation in the filter. For example the brands formerly known as “Marlboro Lights” actually contained almost an identical amount of nicotine as regular Marlboro Reds (11mg), but had more ventilation holes in the filter. It is now known that smokers smoke highly ventilated (low nicotine yield) cigarettes differently from regular cigarettes, and end up absorbing almost as much nicotine and toxicants by [CONTACT_264398]. It is partly for this reason that the terms “Light” and “Mild” are no longer allowed. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act [6] gave the FDA jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products, including the nicotine content of cigarettes. Progressive reduction of the nicotine content of cigarettes to very low levels is a potential way to reduce the addictiveness of cigarettes, and may help established smokers to quit smoking [7, 8]. Preliminary studies have found that progressive reduction of nicotine content of cigarettes is feasible and safe in smokers without comorbid psychiatric illness [8-11]. However, it is not known whether progressive nicotine reduction is feasible and safe in the large subgroup of smokers with comorbid psychiatric illness. Smokers with psychiatric illnesses purchase over 40% of cigarettes sold in the US [12], have a higher prevalence of smoking, greater severity of nicotine dependence and lower cessation rates than STUDY000009 11
Approval: 1/11/201 9
Page 3 of 35 (V. 06/19/2014)smokers without comorbid psychiatric illness [12, 13]. Smokers with a prior mood or anxiety disorder 
report more severe nicotine withdrawal symptoms during a cessation attempt [14, 15]. This suggests the possibility of more difficulty switching to very low nicotine content cigarettes, and potentially more compensatory smoking of lower nicotine content cigarettes that could increase exposure to other toxins in tobacco smoke [16, 17]. On the other hand, if smokers with mood and anxiety disorders can safely transition to significantly reduced nicotine content cigarettes, it is plausible that further progression to smoking cessation may be more achievable from a lower level of nicotine dependence. Prior to implementation of progressive nicotine reduction on a national level, it is important to establish the feasibility and safety of this approach in this subgroup of smokers. 
The overall aim of this proposed study is to evaluate the effect of progressive nicotine reduction 
in cigarettes on smoking behavior, toxicant exposure and psychiatric symptoms in smokers with comorbid mood and/or anxiety disorders. To do so, we will randomly assign adult smokers with 
a history of unipolar mood and/or anxiety disorder to smoke research cigarettes that will contain either a) Usual Nicotine Content (UNC):  nicotine content (11.6mg) similar to popular brands of cigarettes; or b) Reduced Nicotine Content (RNC):  the nicotine content per cigarette is progressively reduced from approximately 11.6 mg to 0.2 mg over 5 months. All subjects will participate in lead-in periods prior to randomization to assess normal smoking behavior and to establish ability to tolerate research cigarettes prior to randomization.  It is our hypothesis that nicotine intake, as measured by [CONTACT_264399], will decline as a function of cigarette nicotine content in the RNC group. Further, it is our hypothesis that by [CONTACT_264400], there will not be significant increases in biomarkers of tobacco smoke exposure, severity of nicotine withdrawal symptoms, mood and anxiety symptomatology or protocol non-adherence over time in the experimental group (RNC) as compared with the UNC control group. 
Aims:
1. To assess the effect of switching to gradually reduced nicotine content cigarettes on product 
use patterns and biomarkers of exposure in smokers with mood and/or anxiety disorders. 
Hypothesis 1.a.:   Smokers assigned to the RNC group will have lower plasma cotinine 
concentrations during the last 3 weeks of the randomized phase of the study than those assigned to the UNC group.
Hypothesis 1.b.:  There will be no significant increase  in key markers of tobacco use (e.g. 
cigarette consumption), biomarkers of tobacco smoke exposure (e.g. NNAL, CO), or health effects (e.g. blood pressure) in those assigned to the RNC group vs. those assigned to UNC. 
2. To assess the effect of switching to gradually reduced nicotine content cigarettes on 
psychiatric and nicotine withdrawal symptoms in smokers with unipolar mood and / or anxiety disorders. 
Hypothesis 2:  There will be no significant increase in ratings of psychiatric or nicotine 
withdrawal symptoms in those assigned to the RNC group as compared to those assigned to UNC.
3. To assess the effect of switching to gradually reduced nicotine content cigarettes on self-
perception of tobacco dependence, self-report of intention to quit smoking, and actual smoking cessation.
Hypothesis 3:  Among smokers who complete the  randomized nicotine reduction phase, 
smokers assigned to the RNC group will have lower perceived dependence, be more likely to report intention to quit smoking, and be more likely to make a smoking cessation attempt and achieve cigarette abstinence at visit 12..STUDY000009 11

phase (visit 10).
1.3 Secondary Study Endpoints 
Biomarkers of tobacco smoke exposure (e.g. NNAL, CO), cigarette consumption, health effects 
(e.g. blood pressure) and mental health measures (e.g. nicotine withdrawal, perceived stress, QIDS, Kessler K6).
The proportion of each group making a choice to try to quit smoking will be an endpoint, as will 
the proportion succeeding in quitting successfully during the choice phase.  Intent to treat (ITT) abstinence (based on the assumption that a loss-to-follow-up subject resumes smoking) and completers’ abstinence (based on the assumption that the probability of loss to follow up is independent of smoking status) will be analyzed. Abstinence will be biochemically verified (CO < 10ppm). 
2.0 Background 
2.1 Scientific Background and Gaps
Reducing nicotine content in cigarettes: This approach has the potential to significantly 
reduce the public health harm from tobacco dependence. However, the impact of reduced nicotine cigarettes on smoking behavior, toxicant exposure and cessation needs to be assessed empi[INVESTIGATOR_264373] a national nicotine reduction policy [7].  The primary concern about a progressive nicotine reduction strategy is that it may have the unintended consequence of compensatory increase in tobacco smoke exposure as nicotine content in cigarettes is reduced (if smokers smoke more cigarettes per day, inhale more smoke per cigarette, or both) [16]. It has been postulated that compensatory smoking of reduced nicotine cigarettes may change the way cigarettes are smoked in a manner that results in increased toxicant exposure, even if compensation (with respect to nicotine extraction) is incomplete [17]. This could occur, for example, by [CONTACT_264401].
2.[ADDRESS_321441] been encouraging.  A series of studies by [CONTACT_264402] [9-11] examined the effects of a progressive nicotine reduction strategy in which smokers switched to cigarettes with progressively lower nicotine content (or yield) over 4 weeks or 6 months. In their initial study of 20 smokers, gradual reduction of nicotine content was feasible and did not increase apparent exposure to tobacco smoke toxins [9]. In a follow up study [10], 135 otherwise healthy smokers were randomly assigned to one of two groups: (a) an experimental group that smoked their usual brand followed by [CONTACT_264403] (RNC over five, month-long steps), or (b) a control group that continued smoking their own brand of cigarettes for the entire study period. In the smokers assigned to RNC cigarettes, nicotine intake, as assessed by [CONTACT_264399], declined progressively as the nicotine content of the cigarettes was reduced, while toxin exposure remained stable or, in the case of the carcinogen, NNAL, was reduced. The titration was well tolerated, but smokers assigned to the RNC group reported decreased “vigor” scores and increased “confusion” scores on the Profile of Mood States (POMS) during the time they were smoking 2mg and 1mg nicotine content cigarettes (compared with baseline), and smokers assigned to the RNC group who were adherent to study procedures also had a 2kg increase in body weight during the study period. These effects are consistent with nicotine withdrawal effects [18].  Importantly, significantly more STUDY000009 11
Approval: 1/11/201 9
Page 5 of 35 (V. 06/19/2014)of the RNC group (51%) than the control group (14%), were interested in quitting smoking by 
[CONTACT_264404]. These studies [8-10, 19, 20] demonstrate that a progressive nicotine reduction strategy is feasible, results in reduced nicotine exposure, increases desire to quit smoking and does not result in increased exposure to other toxicants.
These studies have been well conducted, clear in their conclusions and represent a critical first 
step in the process of empi[INVESTIGATOR_264374], intended or unintended, of a policy of progressive nicotine reduction in cigarettes. However, there are some issues regarding generalizability of the results that must be evaluated prior to implementation of such a policy. A large proportion (>40%) of cigarettes sold in the [LOCATION_002] are sold to someone with a current psychiatric illness, and smoking prevalence is demonstrably higher among those groups. However, enrollment in the studies conducted to date has focused on relatively well-educated, otherwise healthy smokers. In the most recent study[10], 35% of those screened were excluded for current drug or alcohol dependence and 20% for other health issues, and those enrolled had an average of [ADDRESS_321442] for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) scores.
Studies of potentially modified risk tobacco products to date have measured a range of 
biomarkers, but have tended to focus on certain reliable key measures of nicotine exposure (e.g. cotinine), smoke exposure (e.g. exhaled carbon monoxide), and carcinogen exposure (e.g. NNAL). These markers have the advantages of being well validated, are relatively specific to tobacco smoking, and change relatively quickly in response to changes in exposure(39). However, tobacco products are a major cause of oxidative stress and evaluation of the potential risks of different tobacco products should include measurement of biomarkers of oxidative stress. Tobacco smoke is an abundant source of free radicals, containing over 10
17 reactive 
oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) per puff and considerable evidence indicates that these agents play fundamental roles in the development of many of the major smoking-caused diseases including cancer, COPD and heart disease (1). Our team has pi[INVESTIGATOR_264375], including demonstrating differences between levels in cigarette smokers and non-smokers (40), and demonstrating relationships between these measures and tobacco-related cancer (41). We therefore propose to extend that line of research, by [CONTACT_264405]. We believe this will be the first time that valid biomarkers of oxidative stress will be assessed in a randomized trial of RNC cigarettes.
2.[ADDRESS_321443] 12 months, compared with less than one in five non-smoking adults [21]. Twenty three percent of adult smokers have a comorbid anxiety disorder and 13% have a comorbid mood disorder [21]. Among nicotine dependent smokers, 22% have a mood disorder and 23% have an anxiety disorder (compared with 7% and 10% of nonsmokers) [22]. Smokers with a comorbid psychiatric illness may be more vulnerable to unintended effects of a progressive nicotine reduction policy at the national level. These smokers, by [CONTACT_264406], experience chronic high levels of psychological distress, and may be more likely to exhibit compensatory smoking behavior in order to maintain systemic nicotine concentrations. Smokers with mental illnesses report wanting to quit smoking, trying to quit smoking, and use of smoking cessation aids at similar rates to people without mental health problems, but may be less likely to succeed when they attempt to quit smoking [21, 23]. 
The reasons for the well-established, high prevalence of comorbid mood and anxiety disorders 
in those with nicotine dependence are complex and not fully understood. One of the most basic reasons may be that nicotine withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety and depression may be harder to cope with for those already suffering related disorders. Many studies have found that STUDY000009 11
Approval: 1/11/201 9
Page 6 of 35 (V. 06/19/2014)smokers with anxiety disorders report elevated nicotine withdrawal symptoms during early 
abstinence, compared to those without [15, 24-26]. Potential mechanisms have been identified but remain uncertain. For example, smokers with a prior major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_264376]-induced brain dopamine release than those without such a history [27]. Non-nicotine constituents in cigarette smoke may also be involved. Monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) is a brain enzyme that modulates mood because it metabolizes monoamines, including dopamine. During tobacco abstinence, heavy smokers experience an increase in brain MAO-A. This effect, which covaries with severity of depression, suggests one possible biological mechanism for worsening of depressed mood during withdrawal from cigarette smoking [28].
For the reasons described above, smokers with mood and anxiety disorders may be particularly 
vulnerable to unintended effects of a policy of progressive nicotine reduction in cigarettes. It is not known if smokers with these conditions are more likely to “oversmoke” reduced nicotine cigarettes and experience increased toxin exposure as a result. It is also possible that smokers with mood and anxiety disorders may experience some exacerbation in their psychiatric symptoms as they gradually withdraw from nicotine under a nicotine reduction policy. On the other hand, if smokers with mood and anxiety disorders can safely transition to significantly reduced nicotine content cigarettes, it is plausible that further progression to smoking cessation may be more achievable from a lower level of nicotine dependence. We therefore propose to examine the effects of switching to reduced nicotine content cigarettes in smokers with current or past anxiety and mood disorders. We see this as a critical test of the feasibility of the RNC regulatory strategy.

Participant withdrawal prior to randomization (Baseline I and II)Baseline Phase I and II have been designed to identify participants who are not able or willing to comply with the full study protocol after randomization. During Baseline I, participants will smoke their own usual brand of cigarettes for 1 week. At Baseline II, all participants will be asked to smoke research cigarettes with a normal amount of nicotine (around 11mg).  Participants who are removed prior randomization will be replaced until a total of [ADDRESS_321445] been randomized (100 at the Hershey site and 100 at Mass. General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
 At any time prior to randomization participants will be withdrawn from the study if:
1.They report using non-cigarette nicotine products at more than one visit.   This 
includes any number of cigars, pi[INVESTIGATOR_27442], snuff, chew, hookah, electronic cigarette, marijuana, or any other illegal smoked substance.
During Baseline II only, participants will be withdrawn from the study if:
1.Participant’s total cigarette consumption includes more than 10% of non-
research cigarettes  in the 6 days prior to visit 4 only (Average cigarettes from day 
15-20,  e.g. 4 or more out of 30 cigarettes in 6 days for a 5 cpd smoker; 18 or more out of 180 cigarettes in 6 days for a 30 cpd smoker).
2.Participant has reduced their cigarette consumption by [CONTACT_726] 50% from 
baseline (when cigarettes per day are averaged over days 15-20).

Baseline I: participants will smoke their own usual brand of cigarettes for 1 week. 
Baseline II : all participants will be asked to smoke research cigarettes containing a 
normal amount of nicotine (11mg) and  matching the flavor (regular or menthol) of their usual brand of cigarettes for 2 weeks. 
2.Randomized Double-Blind Nicotine Reduction Phase (18 weeks) ,  participants who 
complete Baseline II and agree to continue will enter this phase. They will be randomized to 
either (1) continue to smoke the same research cigarettes they smoked in Baseline II for 18 weeks with their usual nicotine content (UNC) or (2) switch to progressively reduced nicotine content (RNC) cigarettes over 18 weeks. 
3. Treatment Choice Phase (12 weeks)
Prior to making their “Treatment Choice”, all participants will receive a copy of the Surgeon General Report, “How Tobacco Causes Disease” and resources they can contact [CONTACT_264415]. Regardless of the participant’s choice, all participants will attend two additional follow up visits 4 weeks (visit 11) and 12 weeks (visit 12) after the end of the randomized phase.
Choices that will be provided to the participant include:
1. Return to their usual brand2. Continue on the research cigarettes for a further 12 weeks (provided at no cost)3. Receive assistance to quit smoking (with counseling and short acting nicotine 
replacement therapy medication provided at no cost) for 11 weeks.

Participants must be capable of understanding the nature of this study, its potential risks, discomforts and benefits before signing consent.  
Measures and Procedures:
The following information will be collected to determine eligibility:
1. NIDA Drug Screener (not eligible if any drugs are used weekly or more)
2. Medical history3. Concomitant medication history to ensure that the participant is not taking any medications 
that may make them ineligible for the study
4. Measure vital signs.  (inclusion systolic <160) 
5. Pregnancy determination:  Obtain Urine and process pregnancy test for women of child 
bearing age (have had a period in the past 12 months) who have not had a hysterectomy
6. Complete the MINI (inclusion=positive current or lifetime diagnosis for mood or anxiety 
disorder), MINI Suicide score is < 9
Procedure for suicide risk at screening:   Scores of > 9 on the MINI Suicide module will 
require an assessment with a licensed clinician to document a clinical plan. Participant with a 
score >8 will not continue in the study unless judged to be stable and not at high risk for suicide.

Description
Participants will be provided with research cigarettes that have a similar nicotine content to 
current commercially available cigarettes (11mg).  Menthol smokers will be provided with menthol research cigarettes if that is their preference.  The following table describes the dosing and schedule for all study participants including the reductions for those randomized to the intervention during the Double-Blind Phase.    
At visit 10 participants enter the Treatment Choice Phase of the study.  At this timepoint, 
participants are given a choice to go back to their own brand of cigarettes, to quit, or to continue receiving research cigarettes for an additional 3 months. If a participant is in the RNC arm and they choose to continue with the research cigarettes for 3 more months, these participants will receive the same dose of cigarettes they received during the previous 3 weeks. 
For those who are in the UNC group and choose to continue on the research cigarettes, they 
will receive either the same dose they received during the previous 3 weeks OR they will receive the Step 1 RNC cigarettes (see table below) depending on supply availability.

This information will be carefully recorded by [CONTACT_264425] (Cigarette Management System), removed from the carton and replaced with a blind code number.  Individual packs do not contain any identifiable information.  Each individual pack will be labeled with the carton blind code.    
7.4.6 Receiving, Storage, Dispensing and Return 
[IP_ADDRESS] Receipt of Test Article 
Experimental cigarettes will be provided free of charge to the investigators via the NIDA Drug 
Supply Program (see Notice: NOT-DA-13-002).  Cartons (10 packs/carton) with packs of 20 cigarettes/pack will be received from the Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina.

At Penn State Hershey, cigarettes will be stored in locked, -[ADDRESS_321457]/Mass General, cigarettes will be stored at room temperature in locked cabinets in a locked office space.  At both sites, menthol cigarettes will be stored separately from regular cigarettes.
[IP_ADDRESS] Preparation and Dispensing
Assignment:   When a new participant is entered into the CMS and is at the study visit where they 
receive cigarettes, the Cigarette Manager will enter the Participant ID, baseline cigarettes per day, and flavor preference into the CMS.  The CMS will provide the Cigarette Manager with the Blind Code numbers for the appropriate cartons of cigarettes (e.g., the correct cigarettes/nicotine level for the corresponding stage for where the participant is in the study).  
Preparation:   Once the cigarettes are received, they will be blinded by [CONTACT_264426].  At the time of dispensation, the CMS will instruct the Cigarette Manager which blind codes should be dispensed to the participant and the Cigarette manager will pull the correct cartons from the cigarette inventory.  The CMS will also tell the Cigarette Manager how many packs of cigarettes to dispense to the participant.  The cigarette manager will prepare a bag of cigarette packs that will be given to the study coordinator for the participant.  
Where:   All receiving, sorting, blinding of the initial study product will be done in IDS pharmacy 
space at Penn State Hershey.  Dispensing of product to study participants will also be done in the IDS pharmacy space at Penn State Hershey.  At Harvard/Mass General, cigarettes will be stored in locked cabinets in a locked research space and blinded cartons will prepared for dispensing in that space.
Dosing:   Dosing of cigarettes will follow the schedule outlined in section 7.4.
Dispensing:   Cigarette packs containing 20 cigarettes will be dispensed to the study coordinator 
during or prior to a participant’s in person visit.  All packs will be given to participants in the original packaging.  Each individual pack of cigarettes will have a label with the participant ID number, the blind code number, the flavor (regular or menthol) and a list of possible nicotine doses the cigarettes may contain. Packs will also be labeled with a color coded sticker that indicates the visit number at which they were dispensed. The coordinator will give the cigarettes to the participant at their visit.  The number of packs dispensed will be determined by [CONTACT_193526]-reported number of cigarettes per day they smoke when they enroll in the trial.  Participants will be provided with 150% of the cigarettes necessary for each week of usual smoking.  Participants will be able to smoke as many or as few cigarettes as they choose and will be required to return all packs at the next visit.  STUDY000009 11

Reconciliation reports will be produced on an ongoing basis.  
Participants will be instructed to return all research cigarette packs at the next visit, regardless of 
whether they are empty, unopened or partially used. Any unused experimental cigarettes that are returned from the participant will be destroyed by [CONTACT_17387].  Harvard/Mass General will follow their site’s drug destruction policy.  We will not ship experimental cigarettes back to the NIDA Drug Supply Program or recycle opened cartons.

Approval: 1/11/201 9
Page 23 of 35 (V. 06/19/2014)the overall Penn State Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science (TCORS) steering committee for review 
and approval.  If the proposal is approved, the investigator will then need to obtain all other regulatory approvals (IRB, departmental scientific committees, etc.) prior to samples being released.  Only de-identified data, as approved in the investigator’s IRB application, will be released to the investigator.  Blood and urine samples will only be released if the participant provided written consent to allow their samples to be used by [CONTACT_127761] (this option is included in the original consent form).  
8.6 Process for returning results
Investigators will be required to provide a written report on their study results to the TCORS steering committee. Individual participants will not be provided with the results of the analyses of their samples.
9.0 Statistical Plan
9.1 Sample size determination
The primary outcome variable is plasma cotinine concentration (measured as ng/ml). The mean value of this continuous measurement will be compared between two groups: the experimental group (RNC cigarettes) and the control group (UNC cigarettes). For plausible effect size and variation, we use results of Benowitz et al (2012)(10), where the mean and standard deviation of plasma cotinine concentration are 240 and 120 for the control group and 113 and 116 for the experimental group at the 22
nd week follow-up visit (end of randomization phase for trial). It is 
expected that the cotinine level in the experimental group will reduce gradually after start of the trial and the mean difference of the cotinine level between these two groups for our study will be smaller than the difference of 127 ng/ml in Benowitz et al (2012). With a sample size of [ADDRESS_321460] the difference in plasma cotinine concentration level between the two groups as small as 58 ng/ml (which could occur on the 8.6mg nicotine content cigarettes) with at least 80% power (and 68 ng/ml with at least 90% power). Allowing for a 30% participant -withdraw rate, we plan to recruit 100 participants for each group (a total of 200). The alpha level used for the power analysis is 0.05.
Additional statistical power analyses were performed based on secondary hypotheses (e.g. 
hypothesis 1.b): to examine the difference in biomarkers of tobacco smoke exposure, nicotine withdrawal, and psychiatric symptomatology, with a sample size of [ADDRESS_321461] size of 0.5 (difference is half of the standard deviation) between the two groups with at least 83% power. Also, with a completing sample size of [ADDRESS_321462] a 15 – 20% difference in the proportion of subjects  willing to quit between these two groups (depending on the proportion in the control group) with about 80% power. If the proportion difference was as large as the value in the Benowitz et al (2012) study (51% of the RNC group versus 14% of the control group) then our statistical power will be as high as 99.8%. It was assumed that both groups have equal drop-out rate (30%) when the sample size was calculated above. However, it is possible that we could have differential drop-out rate in the two groups. Benowitz et al (2012) had 9% dropout in the control group versus 33% in the intervention group. We have 99% statistical power in detecting a difference as large as this.
9.2 Statistical methods
Preliminary Analyses:  Basic baseline statistics including means (SDs), medians (IQR), and 
frequency distributions (percentages) will be reported for demographic characteristics; smoking history and other baseline measures. Ranges for all variables will be obtained to identify possible outliers and coding errors. Where necessary, some characteristics will be reported by [CONTACT_264427]. 
Specific Analyses
Overall analytic plan:  Linear regression models will be  built  for each outcome variables of 
interest. The primary endpoint for these analyses will be the end of the randomized trial phase (Visit 10), while treating Visit 4 as the baseline. Unadjusted regression models will compare the STUDY000009 11
Approval: 1/11/201 9
Page 24 of 35 (V. 06/19/2014)difference between the two trial arms while controlling for the baseline value of the outcome 
measure. Adjusted models will evaluate the randomized treatment effect while adjusting for the covariates that were selected via backward elimination using a significance level of 0.05. These models will be built on data from subjects who completed the randomized nicotine reduction phase (Visit 10).  We will conduct a separate statistical analysis for the subgroup of compliant participants.
Mixed effects regression models will also be used to study the change over the randomized 
nicotine reduction period of many longitudinal outcomes and to assess the difference of the trajectories between the randomized treatment arms. Models will be fit to evaluate the effects of time, group, and time-by-group interaction while adjusting for the baseline value (visit 4) for the corresponding outcome.
  The hypotheses to be tested are as follows:
Hypothesis 1.a.:   Smokers assigned to the RNC group will have lower plasma cotinine 
concentrations during the last 3 weeks (visit 10) of the randomized phase of the study than those assigned to the UNC group.Hypothesis 1.b.:   There will be no significant increase  in key markers of tobacco use (e.g. 
cigarette consumption), biomarkers of tobacco smoke exposure (e.g. NNAL, CO), or health effects (e.g. blood pressure) in those assigned to the RNC group vs. those assigned to UNC. 
Hypothesis 2:  There will be no significant increase in ratings of psychiatric or nicotine 
withdrawal symptoms in those assigned to the RNC group as compared to those assigned to UNC.  
Hypothesis 3:  Smokers assigned to the RNC group will have lower perceived dependence, be 
more likely to report intention to quit smoking at the end of the randomized trial phase, and be more likely to achieve cigarette abstinence at Visit 12.Both ITT abstinence (based on the assumption that a loss-to-follow-up subject resumes smoking) and completers’ abstinence (based on the assumption that the probability of loss to follow up is independent of smoking status and abstinence can only be evaluated if the participant attended Visit 12) will be analyzed. Abstinence will be biochemically verified (CO < 10ppm). 
A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis will be used to compare the time to dropout (from visit 4 date 
to date of droppi[INVESTIGATOR_264389]) between the two treatment groups.  Participants who completed the randomized nicotine reduction phase of the study (visit 10) will be considered as censored records at the time of visit 10. The date of dropout prior to Visit [ADDRESS_321463] provides meaningful research data. The time to dropout will be compared between the two trial arms.

Similar procedures will be instituted at Harvard/Mass General under supervision of [CONTACT_264443] and [CONTACT_264444].  
11.[ADDRESS_321467] Leaders.   The major side effects associated with RNC cigarettes are similar to usual brand cigarettes.  
Additional potential risks include:
•Increased compensatory smoking:  Compensatory smoking may lead to increased levels of 
toxicant exposure.  In prior studies, compensatory smoking was minimal and higher levels of toxicant exposure were generally not observed. Cigarette consumption and exhaled carbon monoxide will be monitored throughout the trial.  Safety rules are in place to identify and remove participants to increase their smoking rate significantly (see section 3.3.1).
•Nicotine withdrawal symptoms:   Decreased nicotine cigarettes may result in nicotine 
withdrawal symptoms (e.g. irritability, anxiety, restlessness, depressed mood, increased appetite, fatigue, insomnia/sleep problems, impatience, headache, difficulty concentrating).  These symptoms will be monitored regularly.
•New pregnancy or intention to become pregnant:   Smoking is known to be harmful to the 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_18081], either from cigarettes or at the recommended therapeutic dose of nicotine replacement therapy.  For this reason women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to STUDY000009 11
Approval: 1/11/201 9
Page 28 of 35 (V. 06/19/2014)study entry and for the standard duration of the study.  Pregnancy status will be confirmed with 
a urinary pregnancy test every 4-8 weeks (see Time and Events Table).
•Risks of standard venipuncture: The discomfort associated with removing blood by 
[CONTACT_48571] (by [CONTACT_127773] a vein) is a slight pi[INVESTIGATOR_264391]. The risks include mild discomfort and/or a black and blue mark at the site of puncture. Less common risks include a small blood clot, infection or bleeding at the puncture site, and on rare occasions fainting during the procedure. There will be only a small amount of blood drawn (about 2 teaspoons) every three weeks.
•Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]:   Risks associated with lung function tests spi[INVESTIGATOR_264392], dizziness or headache while doing the breathing test.  Participants with medical conditions that may place them at increased risk are being excluded.
•Loss of confidentiality:   There is a risk of loss of confidentiality if information is obtained by 
[CONTACT_127774].  Precautions will be taken to prevent this including direct coding of data in REDCap.
•Randomization in clinical trials:   Participants will be assigned to a treatment program by 
[CONTACT_3364].  The treatment they receive may prove to be less effective or to have more side effects than the other research treatment(s) or other available treatments.
•Questionnaires:   It is possible that some of the questions in the questionnaires may make 
participants uncomfortable.  They will be instructed that they are free to skip any questions that make them uncomfortable.
•Use of oral nicotine replacement:   During the Treatment Choice Phase of the study, 
participants will be encouraged to quit smoking and will be offered a 11 week supply of oral nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (lozenge or gum).  NRT (lozenge or gum) is known to be safe and have only mild side effects.  For this reason they are generally sold over the counter.  Excess nicotine can cause mild symptoms such as nausea, dizziness, diarrhea and rapid heartbeat.  Occasionally these (or other rarely occurring symptoms) are more severe.  There is a slight risk that subjects who have progressed to very low nicotine cigarettes and then choose treatment with the NRT will obtain more nicotine than they are used to.  A [ADDRESS_321468] to use NRT will be contact[CONTACT_264430] (see section 7.0 for study procedures during treatment choice phase) to monitor their tolerance.
The use of oral nicotine replacement allows the participant to self-monitor their urges and 
cravings and use only the amount of NRT that they feel is necessary.  A protocol to help the researcher determine the best dose of NRT to recommend to the participant will be used.  Participants will be followed up within 48 hours of starting NRT to assess tolerance. 
13.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects and Others
13.1 Potential Benefits to Subjects
There are minimal benefits to study participants other than the (uncertain) possibility that participation in the study may reduce their nicotine dependence. Participants will receive financial compensation for their time and inconvenience.  Those who complete the study will be offered help to quit smoking including evidence based cessation treatment with nicotine replacement therapy and counseling.

14.0 Sharing Results with SubjectsApproval: 1/11/201 9
Page 29 of 35 (V. 06/19/2014)This study is not designed to diagnose any disease or condition.  However, if during the course of 
conducting clinical procedures (e.g., blood pressure, lung function), a participant is found to have a result outside of clinical norms, the result will be discussed with the participant at the visit where the result is identified (blood pressure, lung function).  The participant will be given a letter indicating what procedure was done and will direct them to contact a medical provider for further evaluation. If a woman tests positive for pregnancy, the results will be shared with the participant and they will be advised to follow up with their doctor for prenatal medical care.  They will not be allowed to participate in the study.  
Abnormal medical results, adverse changes in mental health status, increased toxicant exposure (CO 
and cigarette consumption) and other outcomes of the study will be treated as Adverse Events.  They will be discussed with the participant, documented and the results will be reviewed by [CONTACT_9154].
At the end of the study, after all participants have completed the protocol, the investigators will send via 
email (if possible) or U.S. mail (if we do not have an email) all participants who completed the randomization visit (visit 4), a letter that lets them know to which study group they were randomized (see letter in study materials).

21.2 Recording of Adverse Events
Research subjects will be routinely questioned about adverse events at in person study visits.
All adverse events (serious or non-serious) and abnormal test findings observed or reported to 
study team believed to be associated with the study cigarettes will be followed until the event (or its sequelae) or the abnormal test finding resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the investigator.
An abnormal test finding will be classified as an adverse event if one or more of the following 
criteria are met:
•The test finding is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]
•The test finding necessitates additional diagnostic evaluation(s) or medical/surgical 
intervention; including significant additional concomitant drug treatment or other therapyNote:  Simply repeating a test finding, in the absence of any of the other listed criteria, does 
not constitute an adverse event.

If the investigator’s final determination of causality is “unknown and of questionable relationship 
to the study drug(s) or device(s)”, the adverse event will be classified as associated with the use 
of the study cigarettes  for reporting purposes.  If the investigator’s final determination of

The system was developed by a multi-institutional consortium which includes The Pennsylvania State University and was initiated at Vanderbilt University. The database is hosted at the Penn State Hershey Medical Center and College of Medicine data center, which will be used as a central location for data processing and management. REDCap data collection projects rely on a thorough study-specific data dictionary defined in an iterative self-documenting process by [CONTACT_59881]. This iterative STUDY000009 11
Approval: 1/11/201 9
Page 34 of 35 (V. 06/19/2014)development and testing process results in a well-planned data collection strategy for 
individual studies. 
REDCap is HIPAA compliant. Data are stored on a secure server; data in REDCap are 
encrypted; access to the database requires authentication (a unique username [CONTACT_2383]); data are accessed based on the individual’s role on the project; every interaction with the data is logged, creating an audit trail.
Random data entry checks will be implemented regularly to identify problems with data 
entry.  Data quality tools  included in REDCap will be utilized to identify incorrect data 
types, out of range data and outliers.  In addition, electronic edit checks, and random internal quality and assurance checking will be performed manually.  Data quality will be monitored by [CONTACT_264436]. If necessary, re-training of researchers will be conducted.
The responsibility for data quality and study conduct lies with the PI.  Site visits will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_264437], and IRB policies.  
22.1.2 Safety Monitoring
The DSMB will monitor the safety of study participants. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_264395] (AE) are correctly entered into the AE case report forms by [CONTACT_14676]; be available to answer any questions that the coordinators may have concerning AEs; and will notify the IRB, FDA, sponsor and/or DSMB of all applicable AEs as appropriate. All final assessments of AEs will be made by a licensed medical professional who is an investigator on the research. 
The research coordinator will ensure that AEs are correctly entered into REDCap and 
complete the appropriate report form and logs; assist the PI [INVESTIGATOR_264396], FDA, and/or DSMB of all Unanticipated Problems/SAE’s.
22.2 Auditing and Inspecting
The investigator will permit study-related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_264438](s), IRB, the sponsor, and government regulatory bodies, of all study related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.).  The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study-related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).

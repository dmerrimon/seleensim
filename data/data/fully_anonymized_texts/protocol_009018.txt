HVTN 303 enrolled (vaccinated) its first participant on August 15, 2022, with the goal to enroll 60 
participants in the study. As of Dec 20, 2022, 44 participants were enrolled (no enrollments occurre d 
after this date). Part A ( Groups 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) completed enrollment of [ADDRESS_785180] 15 to October 14, 2022 .  
Part B enrolled 29 participants from November 3 to December 20, 2022: Group 6 enrolled 10 ppts, 
all of whom received 1 vaccin ation; Group 7 enrolled 10 participants, 5 of whom received 2 
vaccinations; Group [ADDRESS_785181] vaccination.  
Over time, the PSRT observed trends in local and systemic reactogen icity (grade 3 fever, grade 3 
injection site erythema, and/or induration/swelling), unsolicited adverse events (urticaria, rash, and 
serum sickness), and temporary increases in absolute eosinophil counts (AECs) post -vaccination. 
Certain of these events res ulted in pauses in all vaccinations, and the PSRT requested the HVTN 
Safety Monitoring Board (SMB) perform an ad hoc review of all safety data. Following this review 
on January 11, 2023, the SMB recommended that all vaccinations in the study  be permanently  
discontinued, and that participants be continued in safety follow -up, and these recommendations 
were implemented.  
On January 13, 2023, a protocol memo was distributed informing the clinical research sites that all 
vaccinations in HVTN [ADDRESS_785182] been informed using “Dear Participant” letters.  
HVTN [ADDRESS_785183] been revised.  
• For participants in Groups 7 and 8 that received two doses of their respective vaccines, 
Leukapheresis or 20 4 ml of blood draw has been added at 10 months +/ - [ADDRESS_785184] v accination to investigate immunological outcomes.   
• The revised study procedures for Part A participants are shown in new Appendix B  and for 
Part B participants are shown in new Appendix D .  
• The revised visit windows for participant s are shown in new  Appendix F . New Appendix H  
and Appendix J  contains addendum s to the sample consent form s for Part A and Part B

HVTN 303  Version 2.0  / September 21, 2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page [ADDRESS_785201] observed and described  (1-5), its 
virologic etiologic agent, HIV -1 (6-8), has continued to be a worldwide threat to 
public health. In 2018 , in the [LOCATION_002] alone, an estimated 37,968 new 
infections occurred, with 1.2 million people living with confirmed infection, and 
15,820 deaths among those diagnosed with HIV  (9). Global statistics reported in 
2019 were even more sobering, with approximately 38 million people living with 
HIV worldwide, including 1.7 million new HIV cases and 690,000 deaths  (9). For 
individuals who received a diagnosis of HIV -1 during the years spanning 1980 
and 1996, median survival was less than a year  (10, 11) . Advances in therapeutic 
drug development have transformed the survi val prognosis to one of an 
essentially normal life span for individuals newly  diagnosed since [ADDRESS_785202] access to effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) (12, 13) . Although the rate 
of new cases of HIV infections is decreasi ng globally, additional widespread 
measures are needed to accelerate the reduction of new infections. Development 
of a protective HIV -1 vaccine thus remains a global health priority to control and 
eliminate the AIDS pandemic (14). 
A central goal of HIV -1 vaccine development remains the elicitation of protective 
antibodies capable of neutralizing diverse tier 2 (neutralization -resistant) isolates 
that typi[INVESTIGATOR_594927] -1 strains. A primary vaccine target has been 
the H IV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env), the sole viral component exposed on the 
virion surface and principal target for neutralizing antibodies. HIV Env is 
synthesized as a gp160 precursor protein, cleaved to gp120 exterior and gp41 
transmembrane subunits by a f urin-family protease, and assembled via 
noncovalent interactions into a trimer of gp120 -gp41 heterodimers (15). To infect 
a target cell, the gp120 subunit binds the primary host CD4 receptor, thereby 
[CONTACT_594981] a co -
receptor, either CCR5 or CXCR4 ch emokine receptor. Co -receptor binding 
induces further Env -conformational rearrangements , including formation of the 
pre hairpin intermediate and insertion of the fusion peptide (FP) at the N -terminus 
of gp41 into the host cell membrane. Subsequent refoldin g of gp41 into a post  
fusion six helical bundle leads to fusion of virion and host cell membranes, and 
entry of HIV -[ADDRESS_785203] cell (16, 17) . Extensive glycos ylation, sequence 
variation, and conformational masking of key neutralizing epi[INVESTIGATOR_594928] , and thus poses 
serious challenges for vaccine development . 
2.[ADDRESS_785204] of vaccination with a well -formed HIV envelope trimer 
in humans, the Vaccine Research Center (VRC) has previously developed BG505 
DS-SOSIP.664 (herein Trimer 4571, VRC -HIVRGP096 -00-VP; IND [ZIP_CODE]) , a 
soluble, cleaved HIV -1 Env trimer derived from the clade A BG505 Env gene. 
HVTN 303  Version 2.0  / September 21, 2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page 16 of 191 The new 201C 433C disulfide mutation (DS) introduced within the gp120 subunit 
of BG505 DS -SOSIP.664 maintains the Env trimer in a prefusion -closed state that 
is resistant to CD4 -induced conformational change (18). In preclinical testing, 
Trimer 4571 exhibited the desired target antigenicity with specific recognition by 
[CONTACT_594982] (bnAbs) but little to weak binding by [CONTACT_105] -
neutralizing antibodies, even in the presence of CD4 (18, 19) . Immunization with 
prefusion -stabilized SOSIP trimers in multiple animal models has been shown to 
elicit neutralizing respo nses against autologous or closely matched heterologous 
HIV-1 viruses, although with limited breadth (20-26). Trimer 4571 was tested in 
the VRC 018 study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), a phase 1 clinical trial in healthy adults.  As 
of June 2020 , the study has been completed, no serious adverse events ( SAEs ) 
were reported, and study data became available in ClinicalTrials.gov. Overall, the 
Trimer 4571 data demonstrated a good phase 1 safety profile and immunogenicity 
in humans, th us indicating it may be useful as a boosting immunogen in HIV -1 
vaccination protocols.  
One vaccine strategy to induce epi[INVESTIGATOR_594929] -focused immunogens as 
priming reagents followe d by [CONTACT_594983], in 
combination with an adjuvant. Recently, the VRC identified the fusion peptide 
(FP) as a vulnerable region targeted by [CONTACT_594984] (27). The FP is a 
hydrophobic stretch of 15 -20 residues at the N -terminus of gp41 that plays an 
essential role in the viral entry process. FP embeds in the target cell membrane 
during the pre  hairpin intermediate step, where it anchors the rearr anging viral 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_594930]. The N -terminal 
portion of FP is recognized by [CONTACT_594985], 
including N123 -VRC34.01 (27), PGT151 (28, 29) , and ACS202 (30, 31) . These 
antibodies are derived from natural infection, and analysis of t heir recognition 
established the exposed N -terminal half of FP as a site of vulnerability for 
antibody -mediated neutralization (27). 
To evaluate the utility of FP -targeting immunogens to  elicit neutralization 
breadth, the VRC created FP -carrier protein conjugates by [CONTACT_594986] 
N-terminal [ADDRESS_785205] prevalent sequence of FP 
(FPv1) with an appended cysteine to lysine residues on the keyhole limpet 
hemocyanin (KLH) carrier protein using a heterobifunctional crosslinker. 
Adjuvanted FP -carrier conjugate immunogens could induce broad neutralizing  
FP-directed immune responses in mice capable of neutralizing up to 31% of a 
cross -clade panel of 208 diverse H IV-1 strains (32). Boosting with Trimer 4571, 
administered with the lecithin -carbomer based adjuvant Adjuplex, was found to 
significantly enhance neutralizing titers , especially in guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_594931], with vaccine -elicited rhesus antibodies obtained after FP -carrier 
priming and stabilized Env -trimer boosting capable of neutralizing up to 59% of 
the 208 -strain panel (33). 
HVTN 303  Version 2.0  / September 21, 2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page [ADDRESS_785206] Trimer 4571 , improved autologous potency and 
elicited earlier cross -clade neutralizing responses in rhesus macaques compared to 
priming with FP -carrier conjugate alone (34). This finding su ggests that priming 
with a n FP-carrier and Trimer [ADDRESS_785207] strategy was recently shown to further 
improve breadth in guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107]. In this study , the animals were given a FP -tetanus 
toxoid carrier (FP8v1 -rTTHC) prime, followed by [CONTACT_594987] 
4571, then Trimer 6931 (a consensus C  trimer engineered with a slightly altered 
FP [see Section 2.9]), and finally boosted with a trimer cocktail (Trimer 4571 + 
Trimer 6931). The consistency, breadth an d potency of neutralization against a 
panel of representative pseudoviruses was further enhanced with this regimen  (34, 
35). 
Overall, these proof -of-concept studies provide substantial evidence that an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230] -focused vaccine approach using an FP -carrier protein conjugate and 
prefusion -closed stabilized Env trimers (Trimer 4571 and Trimer 6931) 
administered with an adjuvant (ie,  Adjuplex) in prime -boost regimens can elicit 
reproducible, neutralizing immune responses against diverse tier -[ADDRESS_785208] FP 
with breadth. Key immunological questions to be addressed include : 1) Will 
somatic hypermutation allow focusing on FP during the priming phase? , 2) What 
is the im pact of FP priming on inducing a cross -reactive HIV -1 neutralizing 
response? , 3) What are the differences in immune responses and types of 
antibodies elicited by [CONTACT_594988], either priming with FP alone or 
FP in combination with a stabilize d Env trimer? , and  4) Will boosting with 
diverse trimers and trimer cocktails induce and expand breadth of neutralization 
responses? This trial continues a project establishing first -in-human data for 
adjuvanted stabilized Env trimers in combination with t he adjuvanted FP vaccine , 
which has already shown promise in animal models. Data from this trial will be 
used in  design of future antigen s and vaccine regimen s to increase breadth and 
potency of FP -directed neutralization as a critical step toward s develop ment of a 
protective HIV -[ADDRESS_785209] manufacturing

HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page 18 of 191 processes, characterization, and quality control. To identify an FP -based 
immunogen suitable for clinical development, the V RC evaluated several FP -
carrier conjugates made with different carrier proteins used in licensed vaccines , 
and found a non -toxic, truncated variant of tetanus toxoid, recombinant tetanus 
toxoid heavy chain  fragment C (rTTHC) (36, 37)  to be a suitable candidate carrier 
protein for inducing FP-directed responses (38). The N -terminal eight amino acids 
of the most prevalent FP sequence (FP8v1: AVGIGAVF) conjugated to rTTHC 
carrier protein (FP8v1 -rTTHC) elicits FP -directed neutralizing responses in 
multiple animal models when used with the Adjuplex adjuvant. Based on thes e 
promising attributes, FP8v1 -rTTHC was advanced as a candidate vaccine 
immunogen for product development and current good manufacturing practice 
(cGMP ) manufacture . 
2.3 Rationale for evaluation of FP8v1 -rTTHC  and Trimer 6931 (ConC -
FP8v2 RnS -3mut -2G-SOSIP.664)  
Priming with the most prevalent N -terminal eight residues of the fusion peptide 
(FP8v1) followed by [CONTACT_594989] 4571 (BG505 DS -SOSIP.664) that 
contains the matching FP8v1 sequence elicits 20 -30% neutralization breadth in 
sera from vaccine -test an imals (32). While the FP -carrier protein priming is 
important for initiating FP -directed responses (33), Env trimer boosts are critical 
for maturing responses to achieve broad neutralization (32, 33) . Additional 
boosting with a heterologous clade C HIV -[ADDRESS_785210] cross -clade neutralizing responses (33), suggesting a vaccine 
strategy that uses sequential boosting with a heterologous trimer can enhance 
cross -clade FP -directed neutralizing responses.  
To evaluate  the utility of a heterologous HIV -[ADDRESS_785211] FP -directed 
responses, the VRC designed Trimer 6931 (ConC -FP8v2 RnS -3mut -2G-
SOSIP.664), a prefusion -closed stabilized trimer with a consensus clade C 
sequence and a different fusion peptide sequence from that found in FP8v1 -
rTTHC and Trimer 4571. Trimer 6931 is based on the ConC_Base0 variant (39) 
and contains additional stabilizing mutations, 302M, 320L , and 329P (3mut) , at 
the trimer apex, two glycine substitutions in gp41 (2G) (40) to further improve 
stability and antigenicity of the trimer in a prefusion -closed form, as well as the 
standard SOSIP substitutions (41) and 7 other stabilizing mutations (39). In 
preclinical studies, Trimer [ADDRESS_785212] regimen, compared to boosting with Trimer 4571  only, 
as discussed in Section 2.9. 
2.4 Rationale for Use of the Adjuplex Adjuvant  
Adjuvants improve the elicited immune response to many vaccines (42). Adjuplex 
is a novel adjuvant based on a purified lecithin and carbomer homopolymer. 
HVTN 303  Version 2.0  / September 21, 2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page 19 of 191 Adjuplex has been established as an effective and well tolerated adjuvant for use 
with dif ferent antigens and immunization regimens in animals (43, 44) . There is 
limited human experience with Adjuplex  (see Section  2.10.2 ). 
In animal studies, soluble influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein administered 
subcutaneously ( SC) or intranasally with Adjuplex adjuvant at 1 -20% by [CONTACT_594990] -specific CD8 + T lymphocytes (CTLs) responses in mice 
(44). Through histological images of the IM and SC injection sites in the 
Ovalbumin -Adjuplex model in mice, significant correlation was observed 
between increasi ng dose of Adjuplex and the extent and cellularity of the 
inflammatory infiltrate at the injection site (44). 
In another study in mice, soluble HA of influenza A virus adjuvanted with 
Adjuplex and admi nistered SC has been shown to elicit robust humoral immunity 
and T -cell responses (43). The optimal dose of Adjup lex for immunogenicity was 
1% by [CONTACT_8544]; HA adjuvanted with 1% of Adjuplex induced high titers of HA -
specific IgG with insignificant weight loss in mice. The vaccine administered with 
the optimal dose of Adjuplex completely protected mice from the lethal i nfluenza 
virus challenge and was comparatively as effective as the adjuvants 
monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and alum in preventing disease. No signs of local 
toxicity or intolerance, assessed by [CONTACT_594991], 
were noted at any Adjuplex dose, suggesting the Adjuplex to be a potent and 
well-tolerated adjuvant for subunit vaccines (43). 
HIV vaccine candidates adjuvanted with the Adjuplex dose of 20% by [CONTACT_594992], neutralizing immune responses against diverse 
tier-[ADDRESS_785213] regimen  (32). Boosting with Trimer 4571 
after FP priming , with Adjuplex adjuvant,  was found to significantly enhance 
neutralizing titers , especially in guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_115529], with vaccine -
elicited rhesus antibodies neutralizing up to 59% of the  208-strain panel (33). 
Adjuplex adjuvant has been shown to enhance immunogenicity of HIV -1 Env 
trimers compared to alum in non -human primates  (45). 
Based on VRC pre -clinical data, using the Adjuplex adjuvant elicited  a 
statistically significant higher neutralizing responses compared to the alum and 
unadjuvanted groups; therefore, Adjuplex was selected for clinical evaluations in 
HVTN [ADDRESS_785214] 
regimens allows for the ability to induce potent HIV -1 broadly neutralizing 
antibodies (bnAb) in animal studies (46). Investigation of different prime -boost 
regimens may inform on the next generation of HIV -1 vaccines and the 
immunization regimens capable of eliciting durable, cross -reactive serum 
neutralizing antibody responses in humans.  The pre -clinical studies provide 
HVTN 303  Version 2.0  / September 21, 2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page 20 of 191 substantial evidence that an epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230] -focused vaccine approach using an FP -carrier 
protein conjugate (FP8v1 -rTTHC) and prefusion -closed stabilized Env trimer(s) 
(Trimer 4571 and Trimer 6931) administered with an adjuvant (i e, Adjuplex) in a 
prime -boost regimen can elicit reproducible, neutralizing immune responses 
against diverse tier -2 primary isolates in animals.  In addition, they indicate that a 
FP-fusion protein + Trimer [ADDRESS_785215] neutralizing response to the FP epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230]. These animal studies provide 
the rationale for Groups 7 and 8 in Part B of this study , which tests the difference 
in the two priming regimens of FP -conjugate alone (Group 7) or FP -conjugate + 
Trimer 4571 cocktail (Group 8). Group [ADDRESS_785216] of FP and FP  + trimer priming. These 
data can confirm whether  the animal study results were predictive, and thus can 
inform future product development . 
Doses  were chosen to ensure safety of new products and to maximize immune 
respons e. The  recombinant tetanus toxoid heavy chain fragment C (rTTHC)  has 
been shown to be safe and effective in multiple vaccines with doses up to at least 
200 mcg (a polysaccharide quadrivalent [A, C, W135, Y ]). Neisseria meningitis  
tetanus toxoid conjugate v accine (47), the FP-conjugate (FP8v1 -RTTHC) , has not 
been used in humans and will be t ested first at 25 mcg (Group 1) , the dose used in 
mice (38) and then at the target dose of 200 mcg (Group 2). Given the proven 
safety track record for tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccines, an intermediate step 
dose is not felt to be necessary for safety, and instead the immunological target 
dose will be tested directly in Group 2. In VRC 018, Trimer [ADDRESS_785217] 
maximum dosing of each respective trimer at 200 mcg each.  
Based on previous VRC experience  (48), product injections will be split and 
completed at 2 injec tion sites, 1 on each arm. Separating injections into 2 sites 
would increase germinal center recruitment and therefore could enhance vaccine 
immunogenicity  (unpublished animal data) .

Trimer 4571 - and Trimer 6931 -specific antibody titers will be measured by 
[CONTACT_106853] (ELICA) using a Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) 
platform. Other exploratory assays to assess humoral and cellular immune 
responses may be performed with stored samples.  
Measurements of a ntibody, B -cell and T -cell responses may be assessed from 
stored samples for timepoints throughout the study as exploratory evaluations. 
This includes a number of high -throughput functional assays and high -throughput 
biophysical profiling tools to comprehe nsively characterize the humoral immune 
response elicited by [CONTACT_594993].  Vaccinations were stopped on January 13, 2023,  resulting in most (33) 
participants receiving only [ADDRESS_785219] vaccination , however  
participants only received 1 or 2 vaccinations . Antibody titers  will be 
measured by  [CONTACT_106853]  (ELICA) using a Meso Scale 
Discovery (MSD) platform  for all participants  with one or two vaccinations  
in Groups 5, 6, [ADDRESS_785220] vaccination for those participants that received 2 vaccinations  for 
exploratory cellular immune response assays.

regimen.  The rationale for performing leukapheresis at these time points  is to

While peripheral blood draws of ~500 m L allow isolation of up to 500 million 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs ), these number of cells are often not 
enough to detect an epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230] -specific response in the periphery . Leukapheresis , 
however,  can provide 6 -10 billion PBMCs without depleting red blood cells or 
other blood componen ts and significantly increase the likelihood of detecting 
antigen -specific B and T cells  outside lymph nodes .

buffered solution filled into single -dose vials. Trimer [ADDRESS_785224]

stabilizing mutations (RnS, 3mut, and 2G) to maintain a closed conformation in 
the presence of CD4, further enhanc ing the likelihood of cross -clade HIV -[ADDRESS_785225] 
demonstrated that boosting with Trimer 4571 significantly enhanced neutralizing 
titers in animals primed with an FP -carrier conjugate (32), and subsequent 
boosting with a diverse HIV -1 Env trimer derived from a clade C strain of donor 
CH505 increased consistency of elicited cross -clade neutralizing responses in 
guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107] (49). To demonstrate FP8v1 -rTTHC immunogenicity and to evaluate 
the utility of Trimer [ADDRESS_785226] FP -directed 
immune responses, guine a pi[INVESTIGATOR_594932] a FP8v1 -rTTHC/Trimer 
[ADDRESS_785227] regimen and then further boosted with either Trimer 4571 or 
Trimer 6931 , with Adjuplex adjuvant (35). Female Hartley guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_594933] (IM) with 25 mcg FP8v1 -rTTHC at weeks 0, 4  and 8 
weeks and immunized with 25 mcg Trimer 4571  at weeks 12 and 16 . One group 
of animals (n = 6 per group) was boosted further with 25 mcg adjuvanted Trimer 
4571 at weeks 20, 24 and 36. A second group  (n = 6 per group) was boosted with 
25 mcg adjuvanted  Trimer 6931 at weeks 20 and 24 and given a final 
immunization of 25 mcg of a trimer cocktail at week 36. At week 38, 2 weeks 
after the final immunization, the group boosted with Trimer 6931 showed higher 
serum -neutralization breadth on a panel of 10 heterologous, cross -clade HIV -1 
pseudoviruses compared to the group boosted only with  HIV-1 Trimer 4571 . 
Overall, this study showed that priming with adjuvanted FP8v1 -rTTHC and 
sequential boosting with Trimer 4571 and Trimer 6931 could induce a broadly

Animals (n = 10 per group) were imm unized using the following vaccine 
regimens: 1) FP8v1 -rTTHC prime followed by [CONTACT_594997] 
4571, Trimer 6931 and a trimer cocktail or 2) co  administration of FP8v1 -rTTHC 
and Trimer 4571 followed by [CONTACT_594989] 6931 and a trimer cocktail. 
Mice were immunized once every 2 weeks and guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_594934], except for a 2 -month interval used between trimer cocktail boosts. For 
both mice and guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], 25 mcg of a single immunogen or 25 mcg of a trimer 
cocktail or 50 mcg  of FP8v1 -rTTHC + Trimer 4571 cocktail were administered 
intramuscularly with Adjuplex adjuvant at a 20% (v/v) dose. The data indicated 
that d evelopment -grade FP8v1 -rTTHC, Trimer 4571 and Trimer 6931 are 
immunogeni c in both mice and guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107]. Priming wi th FP8v1 -rTTHC 
conjugate, either alone or in combination with Trimer 4571, followed by 
[CONTACT_594998] 6931 , elicited consistent, autologous BG505 
neutralizing responses in both mice and guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107]. Moreover, both FP -primed 
and FP  + trimer cocktail -primed vaccine regimens with heterologous Env trimer 
boosts induced cross -clade HIV -1 neutralization in guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107] , and b oosting with 
a cocktail of Env trimers expand ed the breadth and potency of heterologous 
neutralizing responses.  Additional  details for these preclinical immunogenicity 
studies can be found in the IB.  
A repeat -dose toxicity study of Trimer 4571 formulated with alum adjuvant was 
conducted to evaluate the safety of Trimer 4571 vaccine formulated with adjuvant 
in New Zealand white rabbits when administered intramuscularly (IM) or 
subcutaneously (SC) once every 3 weeks for 4 injections ( study days 1, 22, 43, 
and 64).  Treatment with the Trimer 4571 vaccine and adjuvant mixture induced 
appropriate antibody responses  in the rabbits . All study injections were well 
tolerated,  and the study rabbits used in this study survived to the scheduled 
necropsies.  Any findings noted did not result in any adverse or limiting toxicity, 
were considered to be of minimal toxicological significance (e g, noted in only 1 
sex, reversible, transient, no alteration in organ function), and were anticipated 
findings (such as fibrinogen increases and mixed cell infiltration at the injection 
sites) following administration of immunogenic substances.  
A repeat -dose toxicity study to evaluate the safety of the 3 HIV-1 vaccine 
candidates (FP8v1 -r TTHC, HIV -1 Trimer 4571, and HIV -1 Trimer 6931, 200

when administered intramuscularly (IM) ev ery 3 weeks for 3 (FP8v1 -rTTHC with 
or without Trimer 4571) or 4 (Trimers 4571 and 6931) injections was conducted 
in New Zealand white rabbits. Toxicity and reversibility of effects were evaluated 
after acute and recovery time  points. The study was conducted in compliance with

2020. The VRC018 study evaluated Trimer 4571 at doses of 100 mcg or 500 mcg, 
field mixed with 500 mcg of aluminum hydroxide suspension (alum) adjuvant 
prior to injection, and administered via IM or SC injections at day 0, week 8 and

Immunogenicity of Trimer 4571 was evaluated by [CONTACT_595001] -
specific antibody in serum samples by [CONTACT_106853] (ECLIA) using 
a Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) platform at baseline and at [ADDRESS_785237] administration. Trimer 4571 –specific antibody titers were below the 
negative cut off values in all groups at baseline.  All dose groups displayed 
detectable antibody responses at 2 weeks after regimen completion (week 22) 
with the geometric mean AUCs of 674 (95% CI 50 -9011), 924 (95% CI 175 -
4880), 2 ,529 (95% CI 38 7-[ZIP_CODE]), and 1 ,368 (95% CI 551 -3397) for the 100 -mcg 
IM, 100 -mcg SC, 500 -mcg IM, and 500-mcg SC dose groups, respectively.  
Trimer 4571 induced antibodies that were detected by [CONTACT_488] (Ag)/antibody (Ab) 
Combination HIV testing in participants who confirme d to be HIV negative by 
[CONTACT_940] (PCR). This reaction is referred to as vaccine -induced 
seropositivity (VISP). The VRC 018 trial used the VITROS 3600 system Ag/Ab 
detection assay at the NIH Clinical Center for clinical testing. Samples col lected 
from 7 of 16 participants (43.8%) were reactive in the assay , and therefore 
seropositive, but participants were confirmed  as HIV negative by [CONTACT_954]. Of the 7 
participants who were seropositive, 1 was a 100 -mcg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_55050] 6 were 500 -
mcg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. S ix of 7 participants with VISP reverted back to non -reactive on 
later testing. It is unknown whether the remaining 1 participant (500 -mcg 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]) reverted back to non -reactive, as the final follow -up visits were 
conducted by [CONTACT_469823], but blood sam ples were not collected due to the 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) public health emergency stay -at-home

The NETI protocol is a phase 1; randomized, double -blind, dose escalation 
clinical trial to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of vaccination 
with Trimer 4571 in adults living with HIV -1 on suppressive ART. Both grou ps 
are randomized 3:1 Trimer 4571: vaccine control with alum and administered 
study product by [CONTACT_595002]:  
• Group 1 will receive 100 g of Trimer 4571 with 500 mcg of alum (active, 
n=6) or volume matched PBS with 500 g alum (control, n= 2) at we eks 0, 8 
and 20.  
• Group 2 will receive 500 g of Trimer 4571 with 500 mcg of alum (active, 
n=18) or volume matched PBS with 500 g alum (control, n=6) at weeks 0, 8

• Group 2A (n=8) will enroll participants without evidence of precursor broadly 
neutrali zing antibody at screening.  
• Group 2B (n=16) will enroll participants with evidence of precursor broadly 
neutralizing antibody at screening.  
The first participant enrolled and received study product on September 30, 2021. 
As of March 31, 2023, the study is ongoing and [ADDRESS_785246] been 
generally well tolerated with all reported reactogenicity of grade 1 or grade 2 in 
severity.  
Solicited local reactions were reported by 14 of 16 (87.5%) participants including 
injection site tenderness (n=11, 68.8%) and injection s ite pain (n=6, 37.5%). 
Local symptoms were mild in severity with the exception of 1 participant 
reporting moderate tenderness. Solicited systemic reactions were reported by 7 
(43.8%) participants including fatigue (n=5, 31.3%), arthralgia (n=2, 12.5%), 
myalgia (n=3, 18.8%), headache (n=2, 12.5%) and 1 (6.3%) reported instance 
each for chills, malaise, and nausea. One (6.3%) participant reported headache; 
one (6.3%) reported fatigue; and one (6:3%) reported myalgia after both first and 
second dose of study p roduct. Of the 40 solicited events reported, 34 (85.0%)

Adjuplex is currently being tested in the following studies:  
• A Phase 1 clinical study of a mosaic q uadrivalent influenza vaccine 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
• A Phase [ADDRESS_785250] cocaine  
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). A summary of the cocaine vaccine study objectives and

2.10.3  Experience in this study (HVTN 303) to date  
Local and systemic reactogenicity, adverse events, and transient increases in 
abso lute eosinophil counts  
Two participants reported grade [ADDRESS_785251] vaccination that 
resolved the same day (Group 7) or the next day (Group 8).  
Across Groups 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8, there were 6 participants who reported grade 3 
injection site reactions of erythema (4 participants); induration/swelling (1 
participant); or both (1 participant) after first or second vaccination, with onset on 
HVTN 303  Version 2.0  / September 21, 2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page [ADDRESS_785252] -vaccination. A Group 5 participant with grade 3 
erythema and grade 3 indurati on/swelling also reported pain in thumb and knee 
with possible swelling over his right metacarpal joint; however, at the time of 
reporting, possible alternative etiologies for these joint symptoms were 
considered.  
One group [ADDRESS_785253] that was pruritic, bruising above 
the right antecubital fossa, right armpit pain/tender ness, and sore throat. All 
symptoms were resolved after [ADDRESS_785254] 2nd vaccination, the 
participant  reported a nickel -sized area of urticaria/erythema on the right shin that 
was pruritic and blanched slightly with pressure; the rash resolved aft er 8 days.  
A Group 7 participant reported pruritis and slightly area of redness at/near the 
injection sites of both arms, with onset two days post second vaccination. The 
symptoms resolved after 4 days.  
In addition, several participants had a transient increase in absolute eosinophil 
count (AEC) after vaccination. None of the participants with elevated AECs had 
grade 3 erythema, induration or fever; none had symptoms associated with the 
AEC increase; none  required any treatment or medical care. All elevated  values 
returned to within laboratory reference range.  
2.11 Risks and benefits  
2.11.1  Risks of the Vaccines:  
This is the first study in humans of the investigational vaccines FP8v1 -rTTHC 
and Trimer 6931 ; therefore , risks are unknown at the time of study start.  
The signs and symptoms associated with administration of a similar vaccine, 
Trimer 4571, are discussed in Section 2.10.[ADDRESS_785255] of the risks noted are based on risks of vaccines in general. Potential side 
effects resulting from intramuscular injections include stinging, discomfort, 
redness of skin, or mild bruising at vaccine injection site. As with any injection 
procedure,  infection at the site of injection is a possible risk. Signs of infection at 
the injection site include severe pain, redness, swelling, warmth or drainage.  
HVTN 303  Version 2.0  / September 21, 2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page [ADDRESS_785256]. HIV PCR will be used to exclude or 
confirm HIV infection.  
The m ajority of the human population is immune to tetanus toxoid via 
vaccination. Since the fragment used in FP8v1 -rTTHC (FP  conjugate ) vaccine is 
not a complete te tanus toxoid , but rather just the heavy chain it is most likely will 
not be immunogenic. No risks are expected from the tetanus toxoid fragment.  
2.11.2  Risks of Adjuplex  
Adjuplex is a novel adjuvant platform and therefore , risks are broadly unknown at 
the time of  study start. As described in Section  2.8, one of Adjuplex components 
is soy lecithin. Highly purified soy lecithin that is used for Adjuplex preparation 
does not contain soy protein residues that are linked to induction of an allergic 
reaction to soy, and therefore an allergic reaction to the Adjuplex is highly 
unlikely  (50, 51) . 
Based on experience with Adjuplex in animal studies described in Section  2.4, 
potential inflammatory reactions at injection site may be expected, similar to the 
injection site reactions observed with other adjuvants.  
In a single human phase 1 study described in Section  2.10.2  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) , 
injections of either a vaccine adjuvant ed with  Adjuplex or Adjuplex alone have 
been well tolerated, with injection  site pain, soreness and tenderness , and 
occasional fever reported . As of [ADDRESS_785257] been observed after 
administration of Adjuplex -adjuvanted vaccines.

Others may benefit from knowledge gai ned in this study that may aid in the 
development of an HIV vaccine. The investigational vaccine is not expected to 
provide protection from HIV infection.  
Participants may benefit from more frequent counseling, laboratory tests and 
physical exams while enr olled in the study. Participants may also experience 
positive social impacts as a benefit of study participation. When asked, 
participants say that being in a study made them feel good about helpi[INVESTIGATOR_38609], 
increased their knowledge about HIV, and improved  their self -esteem.

HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page 36 of 191 4 Laboratory  strategy  
The laboratory strategy for this protocol will focus on interrogations of the 
humoral and cellular immune  response as it relates to the ability of FP -conjugate 
and Trimer 4571  vaccines to elicit FP -specific binding antibodies. the elicitation 
of broadly neutralizing antibodies. Magnitude, breadth, kinetics and durability of 
serum neutralizing antibodies will be assessed by [CONTACT_595003] -matched and non -
matched (heterologous) tier 2 HIV -1 Env -pseudotyped viruses in the TZM -bl 
assay. Serum antibodi es will be further interrogated by [CONTACT_595004] a specialized set of epi[INVESTIGATOR_594941] -specific antigens . A 
role for T -cell help will be investigated by [CONTACT_595005] -specific CD4+ T 
cells by [CONTACT_595006].  To gain 
further insights into the requirements for broadly neutralizing antibody induction , 
exploratory studies may be conducted to assess antigen -specific B -cell 
frequencies and to interrogate B -cell lineages that give  rise to FP -specific 
antibodies in vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  Serum  neutralizing antibodies  may also be 
assessed in the TZM -bl assay. The detailed laboratory strategy and the technical 
details are described in the Central Assay Plan and will be updated as new 
reagents and techniques are incorporated into assay planning. This document will 
be available on the protocol webpage. Descriptions of the standard HVTN

• Co-enrollment in a study with an investigational research agent (rare 
exceptions allowing for the continuation of vaccinations may be granted with 
the unanimous consent of the HVTN 303  PSRT)  
Participants discontinuing study vaccine for reasons other than HIV infection 
should be encouraged to participate in follow -up visits and procedures per the 
protocol . At the discretion of the CRS clinician and the PSRT ( for composition of 
PSRT see Section 9.3), some clinic procedures and sample collections may be 
modified or discontinued.  
If a participant becomes HIV -infected during the course of the study, no 
additional study vaccine will be administered.  participants will be encouraged to 
continue scheduled study visits for up to [ADDRESS_785275] infection follow -up visits, only samples for 
protocol -specified clinical labs (with the exception of HIV diagnostic testing) will 
be collected. In addition, some clinic procedures may be modified or 
discontinued.

6.1 Accrual and sample size calculations  
Recruitment will target 60  (up to 70) healthy adult participant s 18 to 50 years of 
age. However, due to the early termination, the study enrolled a total of 44 
participants (15 in Part A and 29 in Part B). The primary goal of this study is to 
identify safety concerns that may be associated with the study products.  
Since enrollment is concurre nt with receiving the first study vaccination, all 
enrolled participants will provide some safety data. For immunogenicity analyses,  
the sample calculations are based on the available  samples .

SAE would likely be observed and the true event rate below which no events 
would likely be observed. Specifically, for each vaccine arm of the study (n = 3) 
in Part  A, there is a 90% chance of observing at le ast 1 event if the true rate of 
such an event is 53.6% or more; and there is a 90% chance of observing no events 
if the true rate is 1% or less. For a vaccine arm in Part B (n = 9 or 10), there is a 
90% chance of observing at least 1 event if the true rate  of such an event is 22.6% 
or 20.6% or more; and there is a 90% chance of observing no events if the true 
rate is 1% or less For a combined vaccine arm ( Groups 1 -5 in Part A and Groups 
6-8 in Part B ) of the study (n  = 44), there is a 90% chance of observing at least 1 
event if the true rate of such an event is 5 .1% or more; and there is a 90% chance 
of observing no events if the true rate is 0.2% or less. As a reference, in HVTN 
vaccine trials from April 2008  through March  2018, about 1.7% of partic ipants 
who received placebos experienced an SAE.  
Binomial probabilities of observing 0, 1 or more, and 2 or more events among 
arms of size 3, 9, 10 , and 4 4 are presented in Table 6-1for a range of possible true 
adverse event rates. These calculations provide a more complete pi[INVESTIGATOR_594946] 13, 2023, a protocol memo was distributed informing the clinical

Group s 6-8 in Part B ) are experiencing a safety event , the 95% 2-sided upper 
confidence bound for th e true  rate of such events in the total vaccinated 
population is 56.1% or 2 9.9% or 29.2% , respectively . For the combined vaccine

6.3 Randomization  
In Part A, Group s 1 and 3 will be randomized and will enroll  no more tha n 1 
participant per day for 3 participants per group. Conti ngent on the safety data 
from  Groups 1  and 3, Groups 2, 4, and 5 will be randomized and may enroll 
simultaneously with no more than 1 participant per day for 3 participants  for each 
group . Conti ngent on the safety data from Groups 1 -5 in Part A, Groups 6-8 in 
Part B will be randomized and stratifi ed by [CONTACT_595012]. A maximum of 7 participants per group that 
do NOT consent to leukapheresis coll ection will be enrolled. A participant’s 
randomization assignment will be computer generated and provided to the HVTN 
CRS pharmacist through a Web -based randomization system. At each institution, 
the pharmacist with primary responsibility for dispensing st udy products is 
charged with maintaining security of the treatment assignments (except in 
emergency situations as specified in the HVTN manual of procedures [MOP ]). 
6.4 Blinding  
Participants and site staff will be unblinded  to participant s’ group  assignments. 
Laboratory  program staff will be unblinded to whether  a sample is from Part A or 
Part B but  will remai n blinded  to the treatment assignment wi thin Part A or Part B  
during assay analysis . 
6.5 Statistical analyses  
This section describes the final s tudy analyses, unblinded as to treatment arm 
assignment. All data from enrolled participants will be analyzed according to the 
initial randomization assignment regardless of how many vaccinations they 
received. In the rare instance that a participant recei ves the wrong treatment at a 
specific vaccination time, the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will address how to 
analyze the participant’s safety data. Analyses are modified intent -to-treat in that 
individuals who are randomized but not enrolled do not cont ribute data and hence 
HVTN 303  Version 2.0  / September 21, 2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page 52 of 191 are excluded. Because of the brief length of time between randomization and 
enrollment  (typi[INVESTIGATOR_106742] 4 working days ), very few such individuals are 
expected.  
Analyses for primary endpoints will be performed using statistical  analysis system 
(SAS) and R. All other descriptive and inferential statistical analyses will be 
performed using SAS, StatXact, or R statistical software.  
No formal multiple comparison adjustments will be employed for multiple safety 
endpoints, multiple pr imary immunogenicity endpoints, or secondary endpoints. 
However, multiplicity adjustments will be made for certain immunogenicity 
assays, as discussed below, when the assay endpoint is viewed as a collection of 
hypotheses (eg, testing multiple peptide pool s to determine a positive response).

immunogenicity for primary - and secondary -objective analyses.  
6.5.2  Baseline comparability  
Treatment arms will be compared for baseline participant characteristics using 
descriptive statistics.  
6.5.3  Safety/tolerability analysis  
Since enrollment is concurrent with receiving the first vaccination, all participants 
will have received at least 1 vaccination and therefore will provide some safety 
data.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reactogenicity  
The number and percentage of participants experiencing each type of 
reactogenicity sign or symptom will be tabulated by [CONTACT_595013] A and Part B  and the percentages displayed graphically by [INVESTIGATOR_216]. For a given 
sign or symptom, each part icipant’s reactogenicity will be counted once under the 
maximum severity for all injection visits. In addition, to the individual types of 
events, the maximum severity of local pain or tenderness, induration or erythema, 
and of systemic symptoms will be ca lculated. Kruskal -Wallis tests will be used to 
test for differences in severity across arms and Wilcoxon rank sum test will be 
used to test for difference in severity between 2 arms  in Part B . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  AEs and SAEs  
AEs will be summarized using Medical Dictionary fo r Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA ) System Organ Class and preferred terms. Tables will show by 
[CONTACT_2939] (in Part A and Part B)  the number and percentage of participants

A listing of SAEs reported to the Division of AIDS ( DAIDS ) Regulatory Support 
Center (RSC) Safety Office will provide details of th e events including severity, 
relationship to study product, time between onset and last vaccination, and 
number of vaccinations received.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Local laboratory values  
Box plots of local laboratory values will be generated for baseline values and for 
values mea sured during the course of the study by [CONTACT_2939] (Part A and Part 
B) and visit. Each box plot will show the first quartile, the median, and the third 
quartile. Outliers (values outside the box plot) will also be plotted. If appropriate, 
horizontal lin es representing boundaries for abnormal values will be plotted.  
For each local laboratory measure, summary statistics will be presented by 
[CONTACT_595014], as well as changes from baseline for post  
enrollment values. In addition, the number (p ercentage) of participants with local 
laboratory values recorded as meeting Grade 1 AE criteria or above as specified 
in the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric 
Adverse Events (Section 9.1) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_595015]. Reportable clinical laboratory abnormalities without an 
associated clinical diagnosis will also be included in the tabulation of AEs 
described above.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reasons for vaccination discontinuation and early study termination  
The number and percentage of participants who discontinue vaccination and who 
terminate the study early will be tabulated by [CONTACT_106867]  (Part B). 
6.5.4  Immunogenicity analysis  
[IP_ADDRESS]  General approach  
For the statistical analysis of immunogenicity endpoints, data from enrolled 
participants in Part B will be used according to the initial randomization 
assignment regardless of how many injections the partici pants received. 
Additional analyses may be performed, limited to participants who received all 
scheduled injections per protocol. Assay results from specimens collected outside 
of the visit window, or from HIV -infected participants collected post infection , 
may b e excluded. Since the exact date of HIV infection is unknown, any assay 
data from blood draws 4 weeks prior to an infected participant’s last seronegative 
HVTN 303  Version 2.0  / September 21, 2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page [ADDRESS_785286]  enrollment, then all data from that participant 
may be excluded from the analysis.  
Discrete categorical assay endpoints (eg, response rates) will be analyzed by 
[CONTACT_106868]. Crude 
response rates will be presented with their corresponding 95% CI estimates 
calculated using the score test method (52). Barnar d’s or Fisher’s exact tests, as 
specified in the SAP, will be used to compare the response rates of any 2 vaccine 
arms, with a significant difference declared if the 2 -sided p -value is ≤ 0.05. In 
general , Barnard’s is preferred since , under most circumstan ces, it is more 
powerful than Fisher’s (54). 
In addition to response rate estimates for each timepoint, the probability of 
observing at least 1 positive response by a given timepoi nt and the probability of 
observing more than 1 positive response by a given timepoint will be estimated, 
with corresponding CIs, for each vaccine arm using maximum likelihood -based 
methods (55). 
For quantitative assay data (eg, the vaccine -induced serum neutralizing antibody  
[nAb] as measured  by [CONTACT_280980] -bl assay , HIV -specific serum IgG binding 
magnitude, breadth, and avidity to cross -clade panels of gp120 and V1V2 and to 
V3, CD4i, gp41 and gp41 immunodominant region [IDR] as assessed by [CONTACT_595016]  [BAMA ] or CD4+ T -cell responses to Gag a nd 
Env as assessed by [CONTACT_270052]), graphical and tabular summaries of the distributions by 
[CONTACT_488], treatment arm, and timepoint will be made. For all primary and 
secondary immunogenicity endpoints, box plots and plots of estimated reverse 
cumulative distribution  curves will be used for graphical display of all of the 
study arms. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] , the results will be shown for each vaccine arm.  
The difference between arms at a specific timepoint will be tested with a 
nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test if the data are n ot normally distributed and 
with a [ADDRESS_785287] 
(depending on the normality assumption) will be used to test for  overall 
differences. Secondly, if the overall test is significant at the [ADDRESS_785288] Hodges -Lehmann point  
estimates and 2 -sided (1 -0.05/# of comparisons) × 100% CIs about the differences 
in location centers of the number of comparisons between vaccine arms. If rank -
based tests are used , then the tests will be inverted to construct Hodges -Lehmann 
point estimat es and 2 -sided (1 -0.05/# of comparisons) × 100%  CIs about the 
differences in location centers of the number of comparisons between vaccine 
arms. When all pair -wise comparisons between the multiple vaccine arms are of 
interest, the Tukey procedure (56) will be used. If only specific comparisons 
HVTN 303  Version 2.0  / September 21, 2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page [ADDRESS_785289], the Holm -Bonferroni 
procedure will be used. An appropriate data transformation (eg, log10 
transformation) may be applied to better satisfy assumptions of symmetry and 
homoscedasticity (constant variance). Significance of t he differences between 
pairs will be evaluated using [ADDRESS_785290] based on whether the 
simultaneous 95% CIs exclude zero and secondly , based on whether the nominal 
(unadjusted) 95% CIs exclude zero.  
Some immunologic assays have underlying continuous  or count -type readout that 
are dichotomized into responder/nonresponder categories (eg , nAb, BAMA, ICS). 
If treatment arm differences for these assays are best summarized by a mixture 
model, then either Lachenbruch’s test statistic (57) or an alternative 2-part test 
(58) (as defined in the SAP) will be used to evaluate the composite null 
hypothesis of equal response rates in  the 2 arms and equal response distributions. 
Lachenbruch’s test statistic equals the square of a binomial Z -statistic for 
comparing the response rates plus the square of a Wilcoxon statistic for 
comparing the response distributions in the subgroup of resp onders. A 
permutation procedure is used to obtain a 2 -sided p -value. For estimation, 
differences in response rates between arms will be estimated using the methods 
described above, and in the subgroup of positive responders, differences in 
location paramet ers between arms will be estimated using the methods described 
above.  
More sophisticated analyses employing repeated measures methodology (for 
example, linear mixed models or marginal mean models fit by [CONTACT_106869]  [GEE ]) may be utilized to incorporate immune responses 
over several timepoints and to test for differences over time. However, inference 
from such analyses would be limited by [CONTACT_595017]. All 
statistical tests will be 2 -sided and will b e considered statistically significant if p  
0.05.  
Based upon previous HVTN trials, missing 15% of immunogenicity results for a 
specific assay is common due to study participants terminating from the study 
early, problems in shippi[INVESTIGATOR_36406], or low cel l viability of processed PBMCs. 
To achieve unbiased statistical estimation and inferences with standard methods 
applied in a complete -case manner (only including participants with observed data 
in the analysis), missing data need to be missing completely a t random (MCAR). 
Following the most commonly used definition, MCAR assumes that the 
probability of an observation being missing does not depend on any participant 
characteristics (observed or unobserved). When missing data are minimal 
(specifically if no m ore than 20% of participants are missing any values), then 
standard complete -case methods will be used, because violations of the MCAR 
assumption will have little impact on the estimates and hypothesis tests.  
If a substantial amount of immunogenicity data  are missing for an endpoint (at 
least 1 value missing from more than 20% of participants), then using the methods 
HVTN 303  Version 2.0 / September 21, 2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page 56 of 191 that require the MCAR assumption may give misleading results. In this situation, 
analyses of the immunogenicity endpoints at a specific timep oint will be 
performed using parametric generalized linear models fit by [CONTACT_54683]. 
These methods provide unbiased estimation and inferences under the parametric 
modeling assumptions and the assumption that the missing data are missing at 
random ( MAR). MAR assumes that the probability of an observation being 
missing may depend upon the observed responses and upon observed covariates, 
but not upon any unobserved factors. Generalized linear models for response rates 
will use a binomial error distribu tion and for quantitative endpoints, a normal 
error distribution. For assessing repeated immunogenicity measurement, linear 
mixed effects models will be used. If the immunological outcomes are left - and/or 
right -censored, then the linear mixed effects mode ls of Hughes (59) will be used 
because they accommodate the censoring. In addition, secondary analyses of 
repeated immunogenicity measureme nts may be done using weighted GEE (60) 
methods, which are valid u nder MAR. All of the models described above in this 
paragraph will include as covariates all available baseline predictors of the 
missing outcomes.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Multivariate display of immunogenicity endpoints  
Data -visualization techniques may be used to explore the re lationship among 
immunogenicity readouts. The set of readouts may be based on one of the primary 
endpoints (eg, nAb, BAMA, ICS), on the set of primary endpoints, or on 
immunogenicity endpoints that also include secondary or exploratory endpoints. 
To unders tand the relationship between pairs of readouts, scatter plots may be 
used when the number of readouts is small ; for a larger number of readouts, a 
heatmap showing the degree of correlation between any two pairs  may be used . 
Principal component analysis (P CA) and associated ‘ biplots ’ of the scores and 
loadings are particularly useful to understand associations between readouts, 
especially when readouts are correlated (61). PCA  is a method to reduce the 
dimensionality of the number of readouts to a smaller set of values (principal 
components) that are normalized linear combinations of the readouts in such a 
way that the first principal component accounts for the most variability  in the data 
and subsequent components, while maximizing variability, are uncorrelated with 
each other. A ‘biplot’ displays the first and second principal component scores 
and principal component loadings. The x -axis is the value from the first principal 
component and the y -axis is the second principal component, where each axis 
label includes the percentage of variation in the total set of readouts captured by 
[CONTACT_115612]. The top axis is the first principal component loadings 
and the right axi s is the second principal component loadings. An arrow is drawn 
for each immunogenicity readout (eg, Env -specific CD4+ T cell polyfunctionality 
score  [PFS], Env -specific CD8+ T cell total magnitude) from the origin to the 
point defined by [CONTACT_595018] 2 princ ipal component loadings. The length of the arrow 
represents the amount of total variation of the set of readouts captured by [CONTACT_115613]. The direction of an arrow conveys the extent to which the variation 
of a readout is in the direction of the firs t or second principal component. The 
angle between 2 arrows conveys information about the correlation of the 2 
HVTN 303  Version 2.0  / September 21, 2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page [ADDRESS_785291] correlation and a 90 -degree 
angle denoting no correlation. Each arrow on the biplot is labele d by [CONTACT_115614]. A biplot is annotated with key meta -
information , such as the treatment arm (most common application) or a 
demographic category. Depending on the application, K -means clustering and 
hierarchical clustering may also be applied for multivariate graphical display of 
immunogenicity readouts.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary analyses of neutralization magnitude -breadth curves  
The area -under -the-magnitude -breadth curve (AUC -MB) to non matched 
(heterologous) tier 2 HIV -1 Env -pseudotyped viruse s in the TZM -bl assay  (62) 
will be computed for each participant with evaluable neutr alization data, as 
described in Huang et al, 2009  (63). AUC -MB to a vaccine -matched panel may 
also be computed when the panel consists of at least 3 isolates. Dunnett’s 
procedure will be applied with 2 -sided alpha = 0.05 to determine which of the 3 
vaccine groups (Groups 6 -8 in Part B) have a significantly higher mean AUC -MB 
than that of the pooled baseline  samples from Group s 6-8, as described in Liu et 
al, 1997 (64) (see their formula [1.1]). This procedure will be applied to construct 
95% CIs about the 3 differences in mean AUC -MB for each vaccine regimen 
(Groups 6 -8) versus the pooled  baseline samples  from Groups [ADDRESS_785292] 95% coverage proba bility.  
Select the best vaccine regimen among those passing the tier -[ADDRESS_785293] regimen.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary analyses of neutralization magnitude -breadth curves  
Superiority comparisons of vaccine regimens passing the tier -[ADDRESS_785294] is not 
significant (p -value > 0.05), then the conclusion will be that there were no 
significant differences in mean AUC -MBs among the vaccine regimens that 
advanced. If the F -test is significant, then s imultaneous 95% CIs about the mean -
differences in AUC -MBs will be reported. These CIs are computed as the 
estimated mean -difference plus or minus t N-m,025 multiplied by [CONTACT_432193] -root of 
S2 (1/n i + 1/n j), where t N-m,025 is the 97.5 th percentile of a t -distribution with N – 
m degrees of freedom, where N is the total number of vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_594947] 
(summing over the advanced vaccine regimens) and m is the number of advanced 
vaccine regimens. In addition, S2 is an estimate of the common sample variance 
of the AUC -MB, whereas n i and n j are the sample sizes of evaluable participants 
HVTN 303  Version 2.0  / September 21, 2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page 58 of 191 for vaccine regimens i and j being compared. Following Fisher’s least significant 
difference procedure, the pairs of vaccine regimens with this CI , exclu ding zero , 
are deemed to have a significant difference. Nominal (unadjusted) 95% CIs about 
pairs of vaccine arms will also be reported.  
Omnibus comparison of magnitude -breadth distributions  
The analyses of magnitude -breadth described above are based on the  endpoint 
area-under -the-curve, which is interpreted as the average log 10 half-maximal 
inhibitory concentration ( IC50 ) to the set of isolates in the test panel. Use of this 
endpoint is maximally statistically powerful if [ADDRESS_785295] statistic max|B dG| 
from Huang, et al (63), which is designed to detect general differences in

Similarly, the max|B dG| test statistic will be used to compare the distribution of 
magnitude -breadth curve s between each pair of advanced vaccine regimens. The 
Holm -Bonferroni procedure will be applied to determine the pairs of regimens 
with significant differences in distribution controlling the family -wise false 
positive error rate at no more than 0.05. Nomi nal (unadjusted) 95% CIs about 
pairs of vaccine arms will also be reported.

For each T -cell subset, the positivity call for each peptide pool will include a 
multiple -comparison adjustment for the number of peptide pools used in the 
assay. In general, the Mixture Models for Single -cell Assays (MIMOSA) 
statistical framework (65) and/or the Fisher’s exact test -based positivity criteria 
will be used. Details of the positivity criteria will be discussed in the SAP. The 
magnitude of marginal response will be analyzed as described for quantitative 
data in the general approach section. For each T -cell subset, graphs will be used to 
display the background -subtracted magnitudes for each participant by [CONTACT_109414], 
treatment arm and timepoint. When 3 o r more cytokines are being measured by 
[CONTACT_106877], the polyfunctionality of ICS responses may also be analyzed as an 
exploratory endpoint. Besides descriptive plots of the magnitude of polyfunctional 
responses, the COMPASS (Combinatorial Polyfunctionali ty analysis of Antigen -
Specific T -cell Subsets) statistical framework (66) may also be used to perform 
joint modelling of multiple T -cell subsets of different cytoki ne combinations. For 
example, the functionality score (FS) and the polyfunctionality score (PFS) may 
be used to summarize the multi  parameter ICS responses.  
6.5.5  Analyses prior to end of scheduled follow -up visits  
Any analyses conducted prior to the end of the scheduled follow -up visits should 
not compromise the integrity of the trial in terms of participant retention or safety 
or immunogenicity endpoint assessments. In particular, early unblinded analyses 
by [CONTACT_595023] d should be made 
available on a need -to-know basis only.

approximately every [ADDRESS_785297] (SMB ). 
During the course of the trial,  unblinded analyses of safety data will be prepared

immunogenicity endpoint may b e performed when all participants have 
completed the corresponding primary immunogenicity visit and data are available 
for analysis from at least 80% of these participants. Similarly, an unblinded

secondary or expl oratory immunogenicity endpoint will only take place after at 
least 1 of the primary immunogenicity endpoints of the same class (humoral, cell -
mediated, innate or mucosal) or, if no primary endpoint of the same class, at least

for a study visit can be completed over multiple days . The procedures for 
documenting remote visits and out of window visits are described in the HVTN 
303 SSP. 
8.3 Reactogenicity Assessments  
Pre-Vacci ne Administration:  Medical history and evaluations including vital 
signs and planned injection site evaluation are performed prior to each vaccine  
administration . 
Post-Vaccine  Administration Follow -Up in Clinic : Following each vaccine  
administration, participants will be observed for a minimum of [ADDRESS_785328] 
injection, vital signs will be recorded , the injection site will be inspected for

HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page 77 of 191 evidence of local reaction , and any evidence of systemic symptoms will be 
assessed . Participants will be contact[CONTACT_595025] (Appendix A , Appendix B , Appendix C  
and Appendix D ). 
Post-Clinic Follow -Up: Participants are asked to record symptoms on a daily 
basis using a n electronic  participant diary. Signs and symptoms considered to 
represent reactogenicity from the vaccine include systemic events of increased 
body temperature,  fatigue , generalized myalgia, generalized arthralgia , headache, 
chills, nausea, and local events at the injection site , including pain/tenderness, 
induration , erythema , and bruising . Participant diaries will be reviewed by a 
clinician  and reconciled  for accuracy and completeness.  
Participants will be given a thermometer for oral temperature measurement, a 
ruler , and provid ed access to the electronic diary . Participants  will be encouraged 
to use the preferred electronic diary but will have the option to use a paper diary. 
The paper diary , if used, will be transcribed into the study database and stored in 
the participant  file for monitoring purposes. The participant will use the diary to 
record daily their highest temperature as well as local and systemic signs and 
symptoms for 10 full days following each study vaccination. Participants will be 
provided training on diary completion, proper thermometer usage, and the use of 
the measuring device to measure any injection site induration and/or erythema.  
 
Remote or in -person c ontact between the participant and the site staff should ta ke 
place on the day after each study injection . The reactogenicity assessment period 
is [ADDRESS_785329]  vaccination reaction grade 2 or higher  will be  assessed  by a clinician 
within 48 hours after onset, unless the reaction is improving and/or has 
completely resolved . Additionally, other clinical concerns may prompt a study 
visit based on the judgment of a study clinician.  
Given the first -in-human use of the various adjuvanted study products alone or in 
prime -boost regimens, the HVTN 303 PSRT may recommend that skin biopsies 
be obtained if unusual skin reactions following vaccinations are reported. Sites are In LOA #3 for protocol version 1.0 (di stributed to the sites on Dec 14, 2022) 
the reactogenicity assessment period was increased from [ADDRESS_785330] -vaccine reactogenicity assessment period was n o longer 
applicable and was not implemented. The reactogenicity assessment period of 
the previously vaccinated participants remained 7 days following vaccine 
administration.

HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page [ADDRESS_785331] for this optional study procedure. Refer to 
the HVTN 303 SSP for further details.  
Clinicians or site staff may photograph the skin reactions to document unu sual 
skin findings.  
8.4 Leukapheresis for Part B participants  
Part B  (groups 6 -8) participants who consented to leukapheresis (see Sections 2.7 
and 5.1.3 ) will undergo leukapheresis at [ADDRESS_785332] –last vaccination in order to 
collect blood cells of special interest for research.  This procedure require s 
participants meet ing additional eligibility criteria (see Section  5.1.3 ). Collection 
of PBMC via leukapheresis  will be performed in accordance with the standard 
practices of the participating apheresis center.  Ideally, in this procedure, 
approximately [ADDRESS_785333] the study site if they experience any AEs 
following the procedure.  
8.5 Visit windows and missed visits  
The schedule of visits and evaluations performed at each visit are shown in  
Appendix A , Appendix B , Appendix C  and Appendix D . Visit windows are 
shown in  Appendix E  and Appendix F . The procedures for documenting missed 
visits and out of window visits are described in  the HVTN 303  SSP. If the missed 
visit is one that required safety assessments or local safety labs, HVTN CRS staff 
should attempt to bring the participant in for an interim visit as soon as possible.  
8.6 Monitoring for COVID -19 symptoms  
Participants will be monitored for symptoms of COVID -19 at each study visit (see 
Appendix A , Appendix B , Appendix C  and Appendix D ). Only participant s who received two vaccinations in Part B ( Groups 7 -8) and 
who consent to leukapheresis will undergo leukapheresis at 10 months +/ - [ADDRESS_785334]–last vaccination in order to collect blood cells for research.  
HVTN 303  Version 2.0  / September 21, 2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page 79 of 191 8.7 Monitoring for HIV infection  
Study participants will be tested  for HIV infection periodically throughout the 
study , as indicated in the schedule s included  in Appendix A , Appendix B , 
Appendix C  and Appendix D . The Laboratory Program (or approved diagnostic 
laboratory) will follow the HVTN HIV testing algorithm (see HVTN Laboratory 
Center MOP) , which is able to  distinguish vaccine -induced antibody responses 
from actual HIV infections. Participants will be promptly informed and counseled 
if they become HIV -infected during the study and will be referred for treatment  
(see Section 5.2.2 ). 
Study participants will receive regularly scheduled counseling regarding 
avoidance of HIV infection in accordance with the most recent Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention HIV counseling  guidelines.  
Although the study vaccine will not cause HIV infection, it may induce antibodies 
detect able by [CONTACT_355562]. This is referred to as 
VISP. The following steps will be taken to protect participants from adverse 
consequences associated with VISP:  
• Participants will be counseled to avoid HIV antibody testing outside of the 
HVTN CRS during study participation.  
• Participants can receive HIV diagnostic testing from the CRS following their 
last scheduled visit until they a re told they do not have VISP.  
• Participants with VISP will be periodically offered free-of-charge poststudy 
HIV diagnostic testing (per the HVTN poststudy HIV testing algorithm) as 
medically/socially indicated (approximately every 6 months) unless or until  
HIV antibody testing is no longer standard in clinical settings . 
• Unless participants request that their names be removed, the names of all 
participants in HVTN studies are entered into a secure VISP registry i n order 
to verify that an individual received an HIV vaccine (and therefore has the 
potential for VISP ) and to qualify former participants for post  study HIV 
testing to distinguish between VISP and HIV infection . Information in the 
VISP registry is not used for research.  
8.8 Early termination visit  
If a participant terminates participation in the study early for any reason, the site 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_594950] : end -of-study HIV 
test, CBC with differential, serum chemistry, physical examination,  social impact 
assessment  and, if indicated, a pregnancy test (see Appendix A , Appendix B , 
Appendix C  and Appendix D ). For participants with HIV infection, please see  
HVTN 303  Version 2.0  / September 21,  2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page 80 of 191 Section 5.2.2 . If the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_594951] a termination visit , they 
should consult with the PSRT.

HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page 81 of 191 9 Safety and adverse events  
9.1 Adverse events  
Unsolicited AEs will be collected over a period of 28 days after each vaccination. 
All collected AEs are captured in the clinical database  on the appropriate case 
report form ( CRF ). Clinic staff should evaluate every AE to determine if (1) the 
AE meets the  requirements for expedited reporting (see Section 9.2.1 ), (2) if the 
AE meets the criteria for a safety pause/prompt AE review (see Section 9.5), (3) if 
the AE meets the criteria for an MAAE, and (4) if the AE is a potential immune -
mediated medical condition (PI[INVESTIGATOR_106286])  or an AESI. A sample list of AESI s and 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_106286] s is provided in Appendix M . 
In addition , a limited set of AEs will be collected and reported for 12 months 
following any vaccine  administration . 
• SAEs/EAEs,  
• AESIs,  
• MAAEs (defined as any AEs leading to an unscheduled visit to a healthcare 
professional ), 
• Safety lab -related AEs , 
• AEs leading to early participant withdrawal or early discontinuation of study 
vaccine(s) administration.  
AEs will be graded according to the Divi sion of AIDS (DAIDS) Table for 
Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Corrected Version 
2.1 (https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical -research -sites/daids -adverse -event -grading -
tables) , with the following exceptions : 
• Unintentional Weight Loss is required to be reported as an AE only if it is 
considered to be potentially deleterious to the participant’s health (see HVTN 
303 SSP). 
• Creatinine is required to be reported as an A E only if it is gradable per the 
increase from local lab ULN parameter. Do not grade elevated creatinine 
based on the change from the baseline parameter.  
• Do not grade creatinine clearance or estimated glomerular filtration rate  
(eGFR ) based on the change f rom the baseline parameter . Do not grade on the 
basis of eGFR if there is clinical concern for kidney injury.  
HVTN 303  Version 2.0  / September 21, 2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page 82 of 191 • Injection Site Erythema or Redness and Injection Site Induration or Swelling 
will not consider surface area and interference with usual social and  functional 
activities , such that:  
▪ Grade 1 is: 2.5 to < 5 cm in diameter;  
▪ Grade 2 is: ≥ 5 to < 10 cm in diameter;  
▪ Grade 3 is: ≥ 10 cm in diameter OR Ulceration OR Secondary infection 
OR Phlebitis OR Sterile abscess OR Drainage;  
▪ Grade 4 is: Potentially life -threatening consequences (eg, abscess, 
exfoliative dermatitis, necrosis involving dermis or deeper tissue)  
• For severity grading of the solicited bruising parameter at the product 
administration site, the definitions based on size of the largest diameter a nd 
listed for the “Injection Site Erythema or Redness” will be used.  The severity  
grade definition for “Bruising” provided under the Dermatologic Clinical 
Conditions will be used only for unsolicited AEs involving bruising at other 
body locations.  
9.2 Serious adverse events  
The term “Serious Adverse Event” (SAE) is defined in 21 CFR 312.32 as follows:  
“An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the 
view of either the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the followin g 
outcomes:  
• death,  
• a life -threatening adverse event,  
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
• a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions,  
• congenital anomaly/birth defect , 
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or participant  
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
HVTN 303  Version 2.0  / September 21, 2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page 83 of 191 at home, blood dyscrasias or conv ulsions that do not result in inpatie nt 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.”  
“Life -threatening” refers to an AE that, at occurrence , represents an immediate 
risk of death to the participant . Similarly, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_594952] a n SAE . 
9.2.1  Expedited reporting of adverse events to DAIDS  
Requirements, definitions and methods for expedited reporting of AEs are 
outlined in Version 2.0 (January 2010) of the Manual for Expedited Reporting of 
Adverse Events to DAIDS (DAIDS Expedited Adverse Event  [EAE ] Manual), 
which is available on the RSC website at https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical -
research -sites/manual -expedited -reporting -adverse -events -daids . 
The internet -based DAIDS Adverse Experience  Repor ting System (DAERS) must 
be used for EAE  reporting to DAIDS.  In the event of system outages or technical 
difficulties, EAEs may be submitted using the DAIDS EAE Form. This form is 
available on the DAIDS RSC website at https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical -research -
sites/paper -eae-reporting.  
For questions about DAERS, please contact [CONTACT_50787] 
[EMAIL_946]. Please note that site queries may also be sent from 
within the DAERS application itself . 
The SAE Reporting Category will be used  throughout the study.  All SAEs 
observed in this clinical trial (including PI[INVESTIGATOR_106279]) that are unexpected, and judged 
to be related to the study products, will be reported by [CONTACT_122845]/DAIDS to the 
FDA in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32 (IND Safety Reports) . After completion 
of the  study , the suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction  (S[LOCATION_003]R ) 
reporting category will be used  if clinical staff becomes aware of an event on a 
passive basis.  
The study products for which expedited  reporting are required are:  
• VRC -HIVVCP0108 -00-VP (FP8v1 -rTTHC; FP conjugate vaccine)  with 
Adjuplex  
• VRC -HIVRGP096 -00-VP (Trimer 4571)  with Adjuplex  
• VRC -HIVRGP0106 -00-VP (Trimer 6931)  with Adjuplex  
There is no placebo product  administered in this protocol.  
The NIAID/DAIDS will report all unexpected SAEs related to the study products 
observed in this clinical trial to the FDA in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32 (IND 
Safety Reports).

(https://members.hvtn.org/protocols/hvtn 300). 
9.5.1  Plan for review of pause rules  
For all safety pauses, H VTN Core notifies the HVTN 303  PSRT, HVTN 
Regulatory Affairs, DAIDS Pharmaceutical Affairs Branch ( PAB ), DAIDS 
Regulatory Affairs Branch ( RAB ), DAIDS Safety and Pharmacovigilance Team 
HVTN 303  Version 2.0  / September 21, 2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page 88 of 191 (SPT), and participating HVTN CRSs. When an immediate safety pause is 
triggered, HVTN Core notifies the SMB.  
Once a trial is paused, the HVTN 303  PSRT reviews safety data and decides 
whether the pause can be lifted or permanent discontinuation of vaccination is 
appropriate, consulting the SMB if necessary. HVTN Core notifies the 
participating HVTN CRSs, HVTN Regulatory Affairs, DAIDS PAB, DAIDS 
RAB, and DAIDS SPT of the decision regarding resumption or discontinuation of 
study vaccinations. Base d on the HVTN 303 PSRT assessment, DAIDS RAB 
notifies the FDA as needed.  
If an immediate HVTN 303  PSRT notification or prompt HVTN 303  PSRT AE 
review is triggered, HVTN Core notifies the HVTN 303  PSRT as soon as possible 
during working hours (local time)  or, if the information was received during off 
hours, by [CONTACT_106934]. If a prompt HVTN 303  PSRT AE 
review ca nnot be completed within 72 hours of notification (excluding weekends 
and US federal holidays), an automatic safety pause occurs.  
The HVTN requires that each CRS submit to its IRB/EC and any applicable RE 
protocol -related safety information (such as IND safety reports, notification of 
vaccine holds due to the pause rules, unanticipated problems involving risks to 
participants or others, and notification of other unplanned safety pauses). CRSs 
must also follow all applicable RE reporting requirements .

needs to be performed. The additional blood volume would likely be minimal. 
The total blood volume draw n for each participant will not exceed 500 mL in any 
56-day (8 -week) period , per American Red Cross guidelines for blood donation 
(https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate -blood/how -to-donate/eligibility -
requirements.html ). 
The preferred laboratory specimen tube types for research samples are shown in 
Appendix A , Appendix B , Appendix C  and Appendix D . Alternate tube types 
may be used under certain circumstances  (eg, ACD tube  shortages) upon approval 
of the HVTN Laboratory Center. Refer to the HVTN 303 Specimen Collection 
SSP for more information.  
9.7 Study termination  
This study may be terminated early by [CONTACT_106936] 303  PSRT,

addition, the conduct of this study at an individual HVTN CRS ma y be terminated 
by [CONTACT_106937]/EC and any applicable RE.  
9.[ADDRESS_785343] will be given, but remaining visits and study 
procedures should be com pleted unless medically contraindicated or applicable 
regulations require termination from the study. During follow -up for persons who 
are confirmed pregnant, pregnancy testing is not required unless clinically 
indicated. If the participant terminates from  the study prior to the pregnancy 
outcome, the site should make every effort to keep in touch with the participant in 
order to ascertain the pregnancy outcome. Pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes 
will be reported as described in the HVTN 303  SSP. If the participant is no longer 
pregnant, refer to Section  5.2.2 .

HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page [ADDRESS_785344]  
This res earch study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP)  (the international council for harmonization of technical 
requirements for pharmaceuticals for human use  (ICH) E6 [R2]), HVTN and 
DAIDS policies and procedures as specified in the HVTN Manual of Operations  
and DAIDS Clinical Research Policies and Standard Procedures Documents, and 
all applicable regulatory requirements. These policies and procedures include 
protocol monitori ng (on -site and remote) and compliance. DAIDS and HVTN 
policies and procedures are available for review by [CONTACT_355565]/EC/RE upon request. 
Any policies or procedures that vary from DAIDS and HVTN standards or require 
additional instructions (eg, instructions f or randomization specific to this study) 
will be described in the HVTN [ADDRESS_785345], and follow -up of its research, ensuring that 
locally appropriate cultural and linguistic needs of study populations are met. 
Community Advisory Boards (CAB) are required by [CONTACT_595028] (GPP) and all local and national guidelines.  
10.2 Informed consent  
The sample  informed consent form s (SICFs) describe the investigational vaccine s 
and all aspects involved in study  participation . Documentation of appropriate 
informed consent must be in place prior to conducting study procedures with 
participants. Periodic assessment of participants’ continued understanding of key 
study concepts and informed consent must also be documented.  Study s ites are 
strongly encouraged to have their local CABs review their site -specific consent 
forms. This review should include, but should not be limited to, issues of cultural 
competence, local language considerations, and the SICF’s level of 
comprehensibilit y. 
If any new information is learned that might affect the participants’ decisions to 
stay in the trial, this information will be shared with trial participants. If 
necessary, participants will be asked to sign revised informed consent forms.  
An HVTN CRS m ay employ recruitment efforts prior to the participant 
consenting. For example, some HVTN CRSs use a telephone script to prescreen 
people before they come to the clinic for a full screening visit. Participants must 
sign a screening or protocol -specific con sent before any procedures are performed 
to determine eligibility. HVTN CRSs must submit recruitment and prescreening

10.2.[ADDRESS_785346] approval from their IRB/EC and any applicable RE to 
use a general screening consent form that allows screening for an unspecified HIV 
vaccine trial. In this way, HVTN CRS staff can continually screen potential 
partici pants and, when needed, proceed quickly to obtain protocol -specific 
enrollment consent. Sites conducting general screening or prescreening approved 
by [CONTACT_11577]/EC and any applicable RE may use the results from this screening to 
determine eligibility for t his protocol, provided the tests are conducted within the 
time periods specified in the eligibility criteria.

informed consent form s (see Appendix G , Appendix H , Appendix I  and Appendix 
J) may be performed on samples . 
11.1 Specimen storage and other use of specimens  
The HVTN stores specimens from all study participants indefinitely, unless a 
participant requests that specimens be destroyed or if destruction or a time limit 
for storage is requir ed by [CONTACT_1744]/EC , or RE.  
Other use of specimens is defined as  studies  not covered by [CONTACT_106927] ( see Appendix G , Appendix H , 
Appendix I  and Appendix J ). 
This research may relate to HIV, vaccines, the immune system, and other 
diseases. This could include genetic testing and, potentially, genome -wide studies. 
This research is done only to the extent authorized in each study site’s info rmed 
consent form , or as otherwise authorized under applicable law. Other research  on 
specimens (“other use”) will occur only after review and approval by [CONTACT_106885], 
the IRB/EC of the researcher requesting the specimens, and the IRBs/ECs/REs of 
the CRSs , if required.  
As part of consenting for the study, participants document their initial decision to 
allow or not allow their specimens to be used in other research, and they may 
change their decision at any time. The participant’s initial decision about other 
use of their specimens, and any later change to that decision, is recorded by [CONTACT_106928] a Web -based tool that documents their current decisions for other use of 
their specimens. The HVTN will only allow other research to be done on 
specimens from partic ipants who allow such use.  
CRSs must notify HVTN Regulatory Affairs if institutional or local governmental 
requirements pose a conflict with or impose restrictions on specimen storage or 
other use of specimens .

and throat; neck, lymph nod es; heart; chest; abdomen; extremities; neurological function; and skin. At other visits, a targeted physical exam will be pe rformed as 
needed, based on participant report or indications of illness.  
3 Medical history: A complete history is performed during  screening. At enrollment and subsequently, an interim medical history may be performed.  
4 Concomitant medications, including prescription and non -prescription drugs, vitamins, topi[INVESTIGATOR_49186], alternative/complementary medicines, recreational drugs, 
vaccinations, and allergy shots are recorded during screening, at enrolment, and at each subsequent clinic visit.  
5 Vaccination (in clinic assessments): At least [ADDRESS_785379] vital  signs taken and the 
injection site will be assessed, and systemic symptoms will be assessed.  
6 Reactogenicity diary: Participants will complete a 7-day diary as noted in Section  8.3. If any solicited reactogenicity is unresolved by [CONTACT_2006] 10, it will continue to be 
reviewed with the participant at each visit until resolved.  
[ADDRESS_785380]: Participants will be contact[CONTACT_595033] w hich might not necessarily be within the visit window for 
vaccination.  
[ADDRESS_785381] may b e performed on urine or blood specimens. Persons who are NOT capable of becoming pregnant due to total hysterectomy or bilate ral 
oophorectomy (verified by [CONTACT_30219]), or menopause (no menses for ≥ 1 year) are not required to undergo pregnancy testi ng. For persons who are confirmed 
pregnant, pregnancy testing is not required, unless clinically indicated.  
[ADDRESS_785382]: see Section  5.1.1 . 
12 Research Samples: Blood draw volumes for each tube type shown.  
13 PBMC for assays & storage: To be collected only from participants who received two vaccinations and who will not undergo leukapheresis.  There is a wide visit 
window for thi s collection (see Appendix F ). 
14 Leukapheresis: Will only be collected from participants who received two vaccinations and ha ve agreed to provide this sample type and who have met 
leukapheresis eligibility criteria (see Section  8.4). A pregnancy test must be performed and confirmed negative within 72 hours prior to leukapheresis (see also: 
footnote 8). For participants who received two vaccinations and decide not to provide leukapheresis samples, 204 mL of ACD blood will be collected instead of 
leukapheresis.  There is a wide visit window for this collection (see  Appendix F ).  
15 Skin biopsies will be obtained if unusual skin reactions following vaccinations are reported (see Section  8.3)

Thank you for your interest in our research study. Please read this consent form or 
ask someone to read it to you. If you decide to join the study, we will ask you to 
sign or make your mark on this form. We will offer you a copy to keep. We will 
ask you qu estions to see if we have explained everything clearly. You can also 
ask us questions about the study.  
Key information  
• Being in this research study is voluntary. It is your choice.  
• You are being asked to take part in this study because you are age 18-50, HIV 
negative and healthy.  
• The purpose of the study is to see if the study vaccines are safe to give to 
people and do not make people too uncomfortable.  
• Another purpose of th e study is to  see how a person’s immune system 
responds to the study vaccine s. (You r immune system protects you from 
infections and disease.)  
• You will be in this study for up to 12 months  of clinic visits .  
• Procedures will include blood draws and injections of study vaccine . There is 
also an optional procedure of a skin biopsy that we ma y ask you to have done. 
We will tell you more about this procedure later in this consent form.  
• There are risks from participating . 
▪ The vaccine you receive  has not  been given to people before or  has only 
been given to a small number  of people . We do not know all the risks of 
the vaccines in this study. A few known risks are pain and itching at the 
injection site, muscle pain, swelling, skin redness, soreness, tenderness, 
headache, nausea, fatigue and fever.  
▪ Taking blood and giving injections c an cause bruising, pain, fainting, 
soreness, redness, swelling, itching, a sore and bleeding.  A skin biopsy can 
cause bleeding, pain, bruising, and scarring, and rarely an infection.  
HVTN 303  Version 2.0  / September 21, 202 3 
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page 120 of 191 ▪ We will tell you more information about risks later in this consent form . 
• We do not expect the study vaccine s to benefit you in any way.  
About the study  
The HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) and [Insert site name] are doing a 
study to test 3 HIV vaccine s. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS.  The study 
vaccines are made from two parts: a protein and an adjuvant. Adjuvants are 
substances that help the immune system respond better (Your immune system 
protects you from disease ). In this study we will test 3 diff erent proteins with 1 
adjuvant.  
Up to  70 people will take part in this study  at multiple sites  in the [LOCATION_002] . 
The researcher in charge of this study at this clinic is [Insert name [CONTACT_107002]] . The 
US National Institutes of Health (NIH) is paying for the study.  
The study is divided into [ADDRESS_785438] the study vaccines in different combinations.  You are being 
invited to join Part A  of the study .  
1. We are doing this study to answer several  question s. 
• Are the study vaccine s safe to give to people?  
• Are people able to take the vaccines without becoming too uncomfortable?  
• How do people’s immune systems respond to the study vaccine s? (Your 
immune system protects you from infection s and disease.)   
2. The study vaccines  cannot give you HIV.  
The study vaccines are  not made from HIV. It is impossible for the study vaccines  
to give you HIV. Also, they cannot cause you to give HIV to someone else.  
We do not know if the study vaccines  will decrease, increase, or not change yo ur 
risk of getting HIV if you are exposed to the virus.  
3. These study vaccine s are experimental.  
The study vaccines include two parts. One part is a lab-made pi[INVESTIGATOR_594964] a protein found on the outside of HIV. The second part is an adjuv ant 
called Adjuplex. (An adjuvant is something that helps the immune system respond 
better.) From here on, we will call it “the adjuvant ”.  
HVTN 303  Version 2.0  / September 21, 2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page 121 of 191 We are testing 3 different proteins in this study and each of these will be mixed 
with the adjuvant.  We will use the  term “vaccine” or “study vaccine” to refer to 
the combination of a protein and the adjuvant . The study vaccine s are 
experimental HIV vaccine s. That means we do not know if they will be safe to 
use in people, or if they will work to prevent HIV infection. Th ese study vaccine s 
are used only in research studies.  
The 3 proteins  being tested  are called Fusion Peptide (FP conjugate),  Trimer 4571  
and Trimer 6931 . They are all lab-made small pi[INVESTIGATOR_594965] s that look like 
parts of proteins found in the  HIV virus.  The immune system will be able to see 
the pi[INVESTIGATOR_594966]. 
Researchers hope that the immune system will respond by [CONTACT_595034] . (The body makes antibodies to fight germs after it is exposed to 
them. The antibodies attack germs and keep them from infecting the body’s cells. ) 
Each of the 3 proteins in the study  is made slightly differently to see how the 
immune system will respond to these different structures.  The proteins  were 
developed by [CONTACT_33862] (VRC) at the US National Institutes of 
Health.   
The FP conjugate protein and the Trimer [ADDRESS_785439]  not been given to 
people before. The Trimer 4571 protein  mixed with a different adjuvant has been 
given to a small number of people  in several other studies . 
The Adjuplex adjuvant is being provided for this study by [CONTACT_33807]. The adjuvant 
is mad e of a fatty substance called lecithin and a suspending agent called 
carbomer mixed together in a saline solution. It has been given to 20 people in a 
different study.  
These  combination s of protein and adjuvant ha ve been tested in mice, guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_594967] . The adjuvant has also been tested in studies using mice  and rabbits.  In 
these studies, animals that got these products had symptoms consistent with the 
general risks of other vaccines (as described below).  Even if something looks like 
it is safe or works in animals, it may not be true for people.  
General r isks of vaccines:  
All vaccines can cause fever, chills, rash, aches and pains, nausea, dizziness, and 
feeling tired. Vaccines can also cause stinging, discomfort, redness , mild bruising  
or an infection where you got the injection. Signs of infection at the injection site 
include severe pain, redness, swelling, warmth or drainage. Rarely, people have 
side effects that limit their normal activities or make them go to the doctor.

received a total of 7 injections . The common side effects are mild to moderate 
injection site pain and tenderness, fatigue, joint stiffness and headache.  
Becau se this protein has only been given to a small number of people , we do not 
know all the side effects. T here may be side effects, which may be serious or life 
threatening, that we do not know about yet.  
Risks of the Adjuplex adjuvant:  
The [ADDRESS_785442] had injection site 
pain, soreness, tenderness and occasional fever after getting  this adjuvant.  
Because this adjuvant with a different vaccine has only been given to  a small 
number of people, we do not know all the side effects .  
These are  the side effects we k now about. There may be others that we don’t 
know about. We will tell you if we learn about new sid e effects that could affect 
your willingness to stay in the study.

blood we take out.  
When we do tests , we will review the results with you at your next visi t, or sooner 
if necessary. We will tell you about any results that are important to your health.  
12. If you have an unusual  reaction on your skin due to a study injection, we 
may want to photograph it.  
Taking photographs  may help researchers  learn more about reactions to the study 
products . We will not take photos of your face. Your name [CONTACT_595048]. The photos will only be used to 
research the safety of the study products . 
13. If you have an unusual reaction on your skin to a study injection, we may 
want to do a skin biopsy.  
A skin biopsy collects a small sample of skin cells so they can be examined in a 
lab. This may help researchers better understand your skin reaction and learn 
more abou t the study products.  
We will ask you at the end of this consent form if you agree to the skin biopsy 
procedure. You can change your mind at any time. It is possible that you may not 
be asked to have a skin biopsy, even if you agree to it.  
If we ask you t o have a skin biopsy, this procedure will be done at [site: insert 
location].  
Sites referring  out to another faci lity for the skin biopsy:  
• must obtain copi[INVESTIGATOR_594968].

and sign at the facility. As part of the consent process, you  will be able  to 
discuss  the procedure in more detail with the clinician who will do the 
procedure . The discussion will include  the location, size, de pth and risks of 
the skin biopsy.   
Sites doing the skin biopsy in the clinic and that have their own separate ICF for 
the procedure:  
• must review it and any other educational materials they have about it with the 
potential participant during the study informed consent process.

and sign. As part of the consent process, you will be able to discuss the 
procedure in more detail with the clinician who will do the procedure. The 
discussion will include the location, size, depth and ri sks of the skin biopsy.  
Sites doing the skin biopsy in the clinic and that do not have their own separate 
ICF for the procedure must modify the general information below about skin 
biopsies to provide the details of the procedure & its risks at their clin ic.  
There are several different tools that can be used to do a skin biopsy. The clinician 
doing the procedure will examine the reaction on your skin to determine which 
one to use. They will tell you how the tool works and the general size of the 
sample th ey will take from your skin. They will apply a cleaning solution to your 
skin in the area where the biopsy will be done and numb the area with an injection 
of a local anesthetic. Once the area is numb, the clinician will take a small sample 
of skin.  This p rocedure may require a few  stitches to close the wound . A skin 
biopsy may  cause a scar. This scar will likely fade over time. A skin biopsy 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_241095]  [ADDRESS_785449] your samples to see how your body, including your 
immune system , responds to the study vaccine . 
We will send your samples (without your name [CONTACT_29097]) 
to labs in the [LOCATION_002] approved by [CONTACT_355576]. In rare cas es, 
some of your samples may be sent to labs in other countries for research related to 
this study.  
Researchers may also do genetic testing related to this study on your samples. 
Your genes are passed to you from your birth parents. They affect how you look 
and how your body works. This genetic testing will involve only some of your 
genes, not all of your genes (your genome). The researchers will study only the 
genes related to the immune system and HIV . 
If you get HIV, the researchers may look at all of the genes of the virus found in 
your samples. The researchers will use this information to learn more about HIV 
and how the virus is impacted by [CONTACT_106365] . 
In some cases, researchers may take cells from your samples and grow more of 
them over time, so that they can continue to contribute to this study.  
HVTN 303  Version 2.0  / September 21, 2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page 129 of 191 These tests done on your samples are for research purposes, not to check your 
health. The labs will not give  the results to you or this clinic because their tests 
are not approved for use in making health care decisions. These labs are only 
approved to do research tests.   
When your samples are no longer needed for this study, the HVTN will continue 
to store them . 
16. When samples are no longer needed for this study, the HVTN wants to use 
them in other studies and share them with other researchers.  
The HVTN calls these samples “extra samples”. The HVTN will only allow your 
extra samples to be used in other studies if  you agree to this. You will mark your 
decision at the end of this form. If you have any questions, please ask.  
Do I have to agree? No. You are free to say yes or no, or to change your mind 
after you sign this form. At your request, the HVTN will destroy all extra samples 
that it has. Your decision will not affect your being in this study or have any 
negative consequences here.  
Where are the samples stored?  Extra samples are stored in a secure central place 
called a repository. Your samples will be  stored in the HVTN repository in the 
[LOCATION_002].  
How long will the samples be stored? There is no limit on how long your extra 
samples will be stored. [Site: Revise the previous sentence to insert limits if your 
regulatory authority imposes them.]  
Will I be paid for the use of my samples? No. Also, a researcher may make a new 
scientific discovery or product based on the use of your samples. If this happens, 
there is no plan to share any money with you. The researcher is not likely to ever 
know who you a re. 
Will I benefit from allowing my samples to be used in other studies? Probably not. 
Results from these other studies are not given to you, this clinic, or your doctor. 
They are not part of your medical record. The studies are only being done for 
researc h purposes.  
Will the HVTN sell my samples and information? No, but the HVTN may share 
your samples with HVTN or other researchers. Once the HVTN shares your 
samples and information, it may not be able to get them back.  
How do other researchers get my sampl es and information? When a researcher 
wants to use your samples and information, their research plan must be approved 
by [CONTACT_106885]. Also, the researcher’s institutional review board (IRB) or ethics 
committee (EC) will review their plan. [Site: If review by [CONTACT_106954]’s 
IRB/EC/RE is also required, insert a sentence stating this .] IRBs/ECs protect the

HVTN will send your samples to the researcher’s location.  
What information is shared with HVTN or other researchers? The samples and 
information will be labeled with a code number. The key to the code will stay at 
this clinic. It will not be shared with the HVTN, other researchers, or with anyone 
else who does no t need to know your name.  Your name [CONTACT_107003]. However, some information that the HVTN shares may be personal, 
such as your race, ethnicity, sex, health information from the study, and HIV 
status. The HVTN may share information ab out the study product you received 
and how your body responded to the study product.  
What kind of studies might be done with my extra samples and information? The 
studies will be related to HIV, vaccines, the immune system and other diseases.  
Researchers m ay also do genetic testing on your samples.  
In some cases, researchers may take cells from your samples and grow more of 
them over time, so that they can continue to do research with them.  
If you agree, your samples could also be used for genome -wide studi es. In these 
studies, researchers will look at all of your genes (your genome). The researchers 
compare the genomes of many people, looking for common patterns of genes that 
could help them understand diseases. The researchers may put the information 
from the genome -wide studies into a protected database so that other researchers 
can access it, but your name [CONTACT_107004]. 
Usually, no one would be able to look at your genome and link it to you as a 
person. However, if a nother database exists that also has information on your 
genome and your name, someone might be able to compare the databases and 
identify you. If others found out, it could lead to discrimination or other problems. 
The risk of this is very small. There ma y be other unknown risks.  
Who will have access to my information in studies using my extra samples?  
People who may see your information are:  
• Researchers who use your extra samples and information for other research  
• Government agencies that fund or monitor the research using your extra 
samples and information  
• The researcher’s Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee  
• Any regulatory agency that reviews clinical trials

We may take you out of the study if:  
• you do not follow instructions,  
• we think that staying in the study might harm you, or  
• the study is stopped  for any reason . 
Other Risks  
20. There are other  risks to being in this study.  
In addition to the risks of the study vaccine s and the procedures that were 
described above , this section describes the other risks we know about. There may 
be other risks, even serious ones. We will tell you if we learn anyth ing new that 
may affect your decision to stay in the study.  
Risks of routine medical procedures:  
In this study, we will do some routine medical procedures. These are taking blood 
and giving injections. These procedures can cause bruising, pain, fainting, 
soreness, redness, stinging , swelling, itching, a sore, bleeding, and rarely infection 
where you got the injection. Taking blood can cause a low blood cell count 
(anemia), making you feel tired.  
Risks of skin biopsy:  
A skin biopsy can cause bleeding, pain, bruising, and scarring, and rarely, an  
infection.  The injection of a local anesthetic can cause brief stinging or burning in 
the area of the injection.  
Personal problems/discrimination/testing HIV antibody positive:  
Some people report personal problems or discrimination because they joined an 
HIV vaccine study. Family or friends may worry, get upset, or assume that you 
have HIV. Rarely, someone has lost a job because the study took too much time 
away from work, or bec ause their employer thought they had HIV.  
Most vaccines cause the body to make antibodies to prevent infection. Your body 
may make antibodies to HIV because you received an HIV study vaccine . Those 
HVTN 303  Version 2.0  / Septe mber 21, 2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page [ADDRESS_785452] HIV. This is called vaccine -induced seropositivity (VISP). VISP 
means that after you get the study vaccine , a routine HIV test done outside this 
clinic is likely  to say you have HIV, even if you don’t. For this reason,  you should 
get HIV tests only at this clinic. Our tests can tell the difference between true HIV 
infection and a positive result caused by [CONTACT_106365] . If you have VISP, we 
can arrange free HIV testing for as long as you need it.  
It is unlikely, bu t you could test antibody negative at the end of the study and then 
test positive sometime later, even though you don’t have HIV.  
Site: Modify the following paragraph if applicable.  If someone believes you have 
HIV, you could face discrimination and other  problems. In some countries, you 
could be denied medical or dental care, employment, insurance, a visa, or entry 
into the military. If you have VISP, you will not be able to donate blood or 
organs. Your family and friends may treat you differently. We wil l give you a 
brochure that tells you more about VISP, and how you can avoid some of these 
problems.  
If you become pregnant during or after the study and have VISP, the antibodies 
might be passed to your baby. We know that this happens with some other 
vacci nes. The antibodies are not a danger to the baby [CONTACT_355579], usually in 
about [ADDRESS_785453] 
VISP, we can arr ange this testing for free for as long as it is needed.  
Embarrassment/anxiety:  
You may feel embarrassed when we ask questions about HIV risks, such as 
having sex and using drugs. Also, waiting for HIV test results could make you 
feel anxious. You could fee l worried if test results show that you have HIV. If you 
feel embarrassed or anxious, please tell us and we will try to help you.  
Risks of disclosure of your personal information:  
Although the risk is very low, it is possible that your personal information  could 
be given to someone who should not have it . If that happens, you could face 
discrimination, stress, and embarrassment. We can tell you more about how we 
will protect your personal information.  
Risks of genetic testing:  
HVTN 303  Version 2.0  / September 21, 2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page [ADDRESS_785454] (GINA) helps protect you.  
GINA keeps health insurance companies and employers from seeing results of 
genetic tes ting when deciding about giving you health insurance or offering you 
work. GINA does not help or protect you against discrimination by [CONTACT_355580], disability, or long -term care insurance.  
Unknown risks:  
We do not know if the study vaccine s will increase, decrease, or not change your 
risk of getting HIV if exposed. If you get HIV, we do not know how the study 
vaccine s might affect your HIV infection  or how long it takes to develop AIDS . 
We do not know if getting this study vaccine s will affect how you respond to any 
future approved HIV vaccine.  Currently, no HIV vaccine has been approved for 
use. 
We do not know how the study vaccine s will affect a pregnant participant or a 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_106784].  
Benefits  
21. The study may not benefit you.  
We do not expect the study vaccine to benefit you in any way. However, being in 
the study might still help you in some ways. The counseling that you get as part of 
the study may help you avoid getting HIV. The lab tests and physical exams 
might detect heal th problems you don’t yet know about.  
When asked, most study  participants  say that participating in a study made them 
feel good about helpi[INVESTIGATOR_38609], increased their knowledge about HIV, and 
improved their self -esteem.  
This study may help in the search for  a vaccine to prevent HIV. However, if the 
study vaccine s later become approved for sale, there are no plans to share any 
money with you . 
Your rights and responsibilities  
22. If you join the study, you have rights and responsibilities.  
We list these in the Bill of Rights and Responsibilities  (BRR) for HIV Research . 
We will give you a copy of it .

you get care elsewhere.  
If you become sick or injured in this study, the HVTN has a process to decide if 
this is related to the study vaccine s and/or procedures. If it is, we call it a study -
related injury. There are funds to pay for tr eatment of study -related injuries if 
certain conditions are met.  
The HVTN has limited funds to pay medical costs that it determines are 
reasonable . If the injury is not study related, then you and/or your health 
insurance will be responsible for treatment costs . 
Some injuries are not physical. For example, you might be harmed emotionally by 
[CONTACT_106965]. Or you might lose wages because you cannot go 
to work. However, there are no funds to pay for these kinds of injuries, even if 
they are st udy related.  
You may disagree with the decision about whether your injury is study related. If 
you wish, the HVTN will ask independent experts to review the decision. You 
always have the right to use the court system if you are not satisfied.

Thank you for your interest in our research study. Please read this consent form or 
ask someone to read it to you. If you decide to join the study, we will ask you to 
sign or make your mark on this form. We will offer you a copy to keep. We will 
ask you questions to see if we have explained everything clearly. You can also  
ask us questions about the study.  
Key information  
• Being in this research study is voluntary. It is your choice.  
• You are being asked to take part in this study because you are age 18-50, HIV  
negative and healthy.  
• The purpose of the study is to see if the s tudy vaccines are safe to give to 
people and do not make people too uncomfortable.  
• Another purpose of the study is to see how a person’s immune system 
responds to the study vaccines. (Your immune system protects you from 
infections and disease.)  
• You will b e in this study for up to 25 months of clinic visits .  
• Procedures will include blood draws and injections of study vaccine.  If you 
agree, we may collect white blood cells by a procedure called leukapheresis. 
There is also an optional procedure of a skin bi opsy that we may ask you to 
have done. We will tell you more about these procedures  later in this consent 
form.  
• There are risks from participating.  
▪ The vaccine s you receive ha ve only been given to a small number of 
people. We do not know all the risks of the vaccines in this study. A few 
known risks are pain and itching at the injection site, muscle pain, 
swelling, skin redness, soreness, tenderness,  headache, nausea, fatigue and 
fever.  
HVTN 303  Version 2.0  / September 21, 2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page 145 of 191 ▪ Taking blood and giving inject ions can cause bruising, pain, fainting, 
soreness, redness, swelling, itching, a sore and bleeding.  
▪ Leukapheresis can cause pain, bruising, and rarely an infection.  A skin 
biopsy can cause bleeding, pain, bruising, and scarring, and rarely an 
infection.  
▪ We will tell you more information about risks later in this consent form . 
• We do not expect the study vaccine s to benefit you in any way.  
About the study  
The HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) and [Insert site name] are doing a 
study  to test 3 HIV vaccines.  HIV is the virus that causes AIDS.  The study 
vaccines are made from two parts: a protein and an adjuvant. Adjuvants are 
substances that help the immune system respond better. (Your immune system 
protects you from disease.) In this study we will test 3 different proteins with 1 
adjuvant.  
Up to  70 people will take part in this study  at multiple sites  in the [LOCATION_002] . 
The researcher in charge of this study at this clinic is [Insert name [CONTACT_107002]] . The 
US N ational Institutes of Health (NIH) is paying for the study.  
The study is divided into [ADDRESS_785464] the 3 study vaccines in different combinations.  Up to 50 people will be in Part 
B. You are being invited to join Part B of the study.  
1. We are doing this  study to answer several questions.  
• Are the study vaccines  safe to give to people?  
• Are people able to take the vaccines without becoming too uncomfortable?  
• How do people’s immune systems respond to the study vaccines? (Your 
immune system protects you from infections and disease.)   
2. The study vaccines cannot give you HIV.  
The study vaccines are  not made from HIV. It is impossible for the study vaccines  
to give you HIV. Also,  they cannot cause you to give HIV to someone else.  
We do not know if the study vaccin es will decrease, increase, or not change your 
risk of getting HIV if you are exposed to the virus.  
HVTN 303  Version 2.0  / September 21, 2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page 146 of 191 3. These study vaccine s are experimental.  
The study vaccines include two parts. One part is a lab-made pi[INVESTIGATOR_594969] a protein found on the outside of HIV. The second part is an adjuvant 
called Adjuplex. (An adjuvant is something that helps the immune system respond 
better.) From here on, we will call it “the adjuvant ”.  
We are test ing 3 different proteins in this study and each of these will be mixed 
with the adjuvant.  We will use the term “vaccine” or “study vaccine” to refer to 
the combination of a protein and the adjuvant . The study vaccine s are 
experimental HIV vaccine s. That me ans we do not know if they will be safe to 
use in people, or if they will work to prevent HIV infection. Th ese study vaccine s 
are used only in research studies.  
The 3 proteins being tested are called Fusion Peptide (FP conjugate), Trimer 4571 
and Trimer 69 31. They are all lab-made small pi[INVESTIGATOR_594970] . The immune system will be able to see 
the pi[INVESTIGATOR_594971]. 
Researchers hope that the immune syste m will respond by [CONTACT_595034].  (The body makes antibodies to fight germs after it is exposed to 
them. The antibodies attack germs and keep them from infecting the body’s cells. ) 
Each of the 3 proteins in the study  is made slightl y differently to see how the 
immune system will respond to these different structures.  The proteins were 
developed by [CONTACT_33862] (VRC) at the US National Institutes of 
Health.  
The FP conjugate protein and the Trimer [ADDRESS_785465] been no safety concerns to date in the participants who got these study 
vaccines in Part A  of this study  so we will now give them to participants in Part 
B. 
General r isks of vaccines:  
All vaccines can cause fever, chills, rash, aches and pains, nausea, dizziness, and 
feeling tired. Vaccines can also cause stinging, discomfort, redness, mild bruising  
or an infection where you got the injection. Signs of infection at the injection site 
include severe pain, redness, swelling, warmth or drainage. Rarely, people have 
side effects that limit their normal activities or make them go to the doctor.

Because this adjuvant with a different vaccin e has only been given to a small 
number of people, we do not know all the side effects.  
These are  the side effects we know about. There may be others that we don’t 
know about. We will tell you if we learn about new side effects that could affect 
your will ingness to stay in the study.

HVTN 303  Version 2.0  / September 21, 2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page 156 of 191 When we take blood, the amount will depend on the lab tests w e need to do  at a 
certain visit. It will be some amount between 12 mL and 182 mL (about 1 
tablespoon  to 12 tablespoons ). Your body will make new blood to replace the 
blood we take out.  
When we do tests, w e will review the results with you at your next visit, or sooner  
if necessary. We will tell you about any results that are important to your health.  
12. If you have  an unusual reaction on your skin due to a study injection, we 
may want to photograph it.  
Taking photographs  may help researchers  learn more about reactions to the study 
products . We will not take photos of your face. Your name [CONTACT_595048].  The photos will only be used to 
research the safety of the study products . 
13. If you have an unusual reaction on your skin to a study injection, we may 
want to do a skin biopsy.  
A skin biopsy collects a small sample of skin cells so they can be examined in a 
lab. This may help researchers better understand your skin reaction and learn 
more about the study products.  
We will ask you at the end of this consent form if you agree to the skin biopsy 
procedure. You can change your mind at any time. It is possible that you may not 
be asked to have a skin biopsy, even if you agree to it.  
If we ask you to have a skin biopsy, this procedure will be done at [site: insert 
location].  
Sites referring  out to another faci lity for the skin biopsy:  
• must obtain copi[INVESTIGATOR_594972].  
• include these sentences:  There will be another consent form for you to review 
and sign at the facility. As part of the consent process, you  will be able  to 
discuss  the procedure in more detail with the clinician who will do the 
procedure . The discussion will include  the location, size, de pth and risks of 
the skin biopsy.   
Sites doing the skin biopsy in the clinic and that have their own separate ICF for 
the procedure:  
HVTN 3 03 Version 2.0  / September 21, 2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page 157 of 191 • must review it and any other educational materials they have about it with the 
potential participant during the study informed consent process.  
• Include these sentences : We will give you a separate consent form to review 
and sign. As part of the consent process, you will be able  to discuss the 
procedure in more detail with the clinician who will do the procedure . The 
discussion will include  the location, size, d epth and risks of the skin biopsy.  
Sites doing the skin biopsy in the clinic and that do not have their own separate 
ICF for the procedure must modify the general information below about skin 
biopsies to provide the details of the procedure & its risks at  their clinic.  
There are several different tools that can be used to do a skin biopsy. The clinician 
doing the procedure will examine the reaction on your skin to determine which 
one to use. They will tell you how the tool works and the general size of th e 
sample they will take from your skin. They will apply a cleaning solution to your 
skin in the area where the biopsy will be done and numb the area with an injection 
of a local anesthetic . Once the area is numb, the clinician will take a small sample 
of skin. This procedure may require  a few  stitches to close the wound . A skin 
biopsy may cause a scar. This scar will likely fade over time.  A skin biopsy

around 100 mL  (about 7 tablesp oons), with most of them being well below that.  
To compare, people who donate blood in the US usually donate  500 mL  (1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_594973] 
32 tablespoons ) at a time.   
Leukapheresis may not be available at every clinic participating in the study. 
Some clinics may send their participants to a different facility in t he area to have 
the leukapheresis procedure done.  
Site: Sites must obtain copi[INVESTIGATOR_594974], so that they can be reviewed wit h potential participants during 
the study informed consent process.   
The leukapheresis procedure will be done at [site: insert location] . Your 
eligibility to have this procedure will be decided by [CONTACT_595040]. There will be another consent form for 
you to review and sign at the facility. It will provide additional details about the 
procedure and any risks involved.  
For the procedure, a clinician will insert a sterile needle into a vein in each o f 
your arms. The needles are attached to tubes. Your blood will go out of your body 
through one tube and into a machine that separates the blood and takes out the 
white blood cells. After the white blood cells are taken out, the rest of the blood 
will go b ack into your body through the tube going into your other arm. 
Sometimes the fluid lost during the procedure is replaced by a sterile salt water 
solution, or a solution containing a protein called albumin. This protein is 
normally found in human blood. An anticoagulant may be added to your blood 
during the procedure. Anticoagulants prevent blood from clotting.  
If you notice any symptoms during leukapheresis, please let the nurse know 
immediately. Usually the symptoms can be reversed quickly by [CONTACT_595041]. If there are any problems, the staff will use the 
appropriate medical procedures to treat you. It is normal to feel tired for up to [ADDRESS_785483] your samples to see how y our body, including your 
immune system, responds to the study vaccine s. 
We will send your samples (without your name [CONTACT_29097]) 
to labs in the [LOCATION_002] approved by [CONTACT_355576].  In rare cases, 
HVTN 303  Version 2.0  / September 21, 2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page [ADDRESS_785484] how you look 
and how your body works. This genetic testing will involve only some of your 
genes, not all of your genes (your genome). The researchers will study only the  
genes related to the immune system and HIV.  
If you get HIV, the researchers may look at all of the genes of the virus found in 
your samples. The resea rchers will use this information to learn more about HIV 
and how the virus is impacted by [CONTACT_106365].  
In some cases, researchers may take cells from your samples and grow more of 
them over time, so that they can continue to contribute to this study.  
These tests done on your samples are for research purposes, not to check your 
health. The labs will not give the results to you or this clinic because their tests 
are not approved for use in making health care decisions. These labs are only 
approved  to do research tests.  
When your samples are no longer needed for this study, the HVTN will continue 
to store them.  
17. When samples are no longer needed  for this study, the HVTN wants to use 
them in other studies and share them with other researchers.  
The H VTN calls these samples “extra samples”. The HVTN will only allow your 
extra samples to be used in other studies if you agree to this. You will mark your 
decision at the end of this form. If you have any questions, please ask.  
Do I have to agree? No. You a re free to say yes or no, or to change your mind 
after you sign this form. At your request, the HVTN will destroy all extra samples 
that it has. Your decision will not affect your being in this study or have any 
negative consequences here.  
Where are the sa mples stored?  Extra samples are stored in a secure central place 
called a repository. Your samples will be st ored in the HVTN repository in the 
[LOCATION_002].  
How long will the samples be stored? There is no limit on how long your extra 
samples will be sto red. [Site: Revise the previous sentence to insert limits if your 
regulatory authority imposes them.]  
Will I be paid for the use of my samples? No. Also, a researcher may make a new 
scientific discovery or product based on the use of your samples. If this happens, 
there is no plan to share any money with you. The researcher is not likely to ever 
know who you are.  
HVTN 303  Version 2.0  / September 21, 2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page 160 of 191 Will I benefit from allowing my samples to be used in other studies? Probably not. 
Results from these other studies are not given to you, this cli nic, or your doctor. 
They are not part of your medical record. The studies are only being done for 
research purposes.  
Will the HVTN sell my samples and information? No, but the HVTN may share 
your samples with HVTN or other researchers. Once the HVTN share s your 
samples and information, it may not be able to get them back.  
How do other researchers get my samples and information? When a researcher 
wants to use your samples and information, their research plan must be approved 
by [CONTACT_106885]. Also, the researcher’s institutional review board (IRB) or ethics 
committee (EC) will review their plan. [Site: If review by [CONTACT_106954]’s 
IRB/EC/RE is also required, insert a sentence stating this .] IRBs/ECs protect the 
rights and well -being of people in research. If the research plan is approved, the 
HVTN will send your samples to the researcher’s location.  
What information is shared with HV TN or other researchers? The samples and 
information will be labeled with a code number. The key to the code will stay at 
this clinic. It will not be shared with the HVTN, other researchers, or with anyone 
else who does not need to know your name. Your nam e will not be part of the 
information. However, some information that the HVTN shares may be personal, 
such as your race, ethnicity, sex, health information from the study, and HIV 
status. The HVTN may share information about the study product you received  
and how your body responded to the study product.  
What kind of studies might be done with my extra samples and information? The 
studies will be related to HIV, vaccines, the immune system and other diseases.  
Researchers may also do geneti c testing on your  samples.  
In some cases, researchers may take cells from your samples and grow more of 
them over time, so that they can continue to do research with them.  
If you agree, your samples could also be used for genome -wide studies. In these 
studies, researchers will look at all of your genes (your genome). The researchers 
compare the genomes of many people, looking for common patterns of genes that 
could help them understand diseases. The researchers may put the information 
from the genome -wide studies into a pro tected database so that other researchers 
can access it, but your name [CONTACT_107004]. 
Usually, no one would be able to look at your genome and link it to you as a 
person. However, if another database exists that also h as information on your 
genome and your name, someone might be able to compare the databases and 
identify you. If others found out, it could lead to discrimination or other problems. 
The risk of this is very small. There may be other unknown risks.  
Who will  have access to my information in studies using my extra samples?  
HVTN 303  Version 2.0  / September 21, 2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page 161 of 191 People who may see your information are:

Other Risks  
21. There are other risks to being in this study.  
In addition to the risks of the study vaccines and the procedures that were 
described above, t his section describes the other risks we know about. There may 
HVTN 303  Version 2.0  / September 21, 2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page [ADDRESS_785485] your decision to stay in the study.  
Risks of skin biopsy:  
A skin biopsy can cause bleeding, pain, bruising, and scarring, and rarely, an  
infection.  The injection of a local anesthetic can cause brief stinging or burning in 
the area of the injection.  
Risks of leukapheresis :  
Generally, the risks of leukapheresis include pain, bruising and rarely, infection. 
Rarely, albumin can cause an allergic reacti on. If the leukapheresis procedure has 
to be stopped, it could result in the loss of up to 1 cup of blood. Your body makes 
new blood within 2 weeks.  
Risks of routine medical procedures:  
In this study, we will do some routine medical procedures. These are taking blood 
and giving injections. These procedures  can cause bruising, pain, fainting, 
soreness, redness, stinging, swelling, itching, a sore, bleeding, and rarely infection 
where you got the injection. Taking blood can cause a low blood cell count 
(anem ia), making you feel tired.  
Personal problems/discrimination/testing HIV antibody positive:  
Some people report personal problems or discrimination because they joined an 
HIV vaccine study. Family or friends may worry, get upset, or assume that you 
have HIV . Rarely, someone has lost a job because the study took too much time 
away from work, or because their employer thought they had HIV.  
Most vaccines cause the body to make antibodies to prevent infection. Your body 
may make antibodies to HIV becaus e you rec eived an HIV study vaccine. Those 
antibodies could cause you to test positive on some types of HIV tests, even if you 
do not have HIV. This is called vaccine -induced seropositivity (VISP). VISP 
means that after you get the study vaccine, a routine HIV test  done outside this 
clinic is likely to say you have HIV, even if you don’t. For this reason, you should 
get HIV tests only at this clinic. Our tests can tell the difference between true HIV 
infection and a positive result caused by [CONTACT_106365]. If yo u have VISP, we 
can arrange free HIV testing for as long as you need it.  
It is unlikely, but you  could test antibody negative at the end of the study and then 
test positive sometime later, even though you don’t have HIV.  
Site: Modify the followi ng paragr aph if applicable.  If someone believes you have 
HIV, you could face discrimination and other problems. In some countries, you 
could be denied medical or dental care, employment, insurance, a visa, or entry 
into the military. If you have VISP, you will not be able to donate blood or 
HVTN 303  Version 2.0  / September 21, 2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page [ADDRESS_785486] 
VISP, we can arrange this testing for free for as long as it is needed.  
Embarrassment/anxiety:  
You may feel embarrassed when we ask questions about HIV risks, such as 
having sex an d using drugs. Also, waiting for HIV test results could make you 
feel anxious. You could feel worried if test results show that you have HIV. If you 
feel embarrassed or anxious, please tell us and we will try to help you.  
Risks of disclosure of yo ur person al information:  
Although the risk is very low, it is possible that your personal information could 
be given to someone who should not have it. If that happens, you could face 
discrimination, stress, and embarrassment. We can tell you more about how we 
will protect your personal information.  
Risks  of genetic testing:  
It is possible that genetic tests could show you may be at risk for certain diseases. 
If others found out, it could lead to discr imination or other problems. However, 
genetic test results are not part of your study record, so it is almost impossible for 
anyone to connect them to you personally.  
Even if your genetic information somehow gets linked to your name, a federal law 
called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) helps prote ct you.  
GINA keeps health insurance companies and employers from seeing results of 
genetic testing when deciding about giving you health insurance or offering you 
work. GINA does not help or protect you against discrimination by [CONTACT_355580], d isability, or long -term care insurance.  
Unknown risks:  
HVTN 303  Version 2.0  / September 21, 2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page [ADDRESS_785487] health problems you don’t yet know about.  
When asked, most study  participants  say that participating in a study made them

mL and 225 mL (about 1 tablespoon to 1 5 tablespoons).  
In the consent form you signed when you joined the study, we said that i f you ha d 
an unusual reaction on your skin after a study injection, we may want to do a skin 
biopsy . We did do a skin biopsy on [ADDRESS_785500] a larger blood draw of around 200 mL (about 1 5 tablespoons) 42-[ADDRESS_785501] injection visit.  To compare, people who donate blood in the 
US usually donate  500 mL  (1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_594975] 32 tabl espoons) at a time.   
Some sites may send their participants to a different facility in the area to have the 
leukapheresis procedure done.

normally found in human blood. An anticoagulant may be added to your blood 
during the procedure. Anticoagulants prevent blood from clotting.  
If you notice any symptoms during leukapheresis , please let the nurse know 
immediately. Usually,  the symptoms can be reversed quickly by [CONTACT_595045]. If there are any problems, the staff will use the 
appropriate medical procedures to treat you. It is normal to feel tir ed for up to 24

HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page 180 of 191 Appendix K  Low risk guidelines for US  
The following are intended as guidelines for the investigator to help identify potential 
vaccine trial participants at “low risk” for HIV infection.  These guidelines are based on 
behaviors within the last 6 -12 months prior to enrollment;  however, it may be appropriate to 
consider a person’s behavior over a longer period of time than specified to assess the 
person’s likelihood of maintaining low risk behavior. Some volunteers may not be 
appropriate for enrollment even if they meet these gu idelines.  These guidelines should be 
supplemented and interpreted with local epi[INVESTIGATOR_594976]. The investigator may review the risk level of any 
volunteer with the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or the Protoco l Safety Review Team.  
A volunteer may be appropriate for inclusion if he/she/they meets these guidelines:  
A. For US volunteers NOT on stable Pre -exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)  
1. SEXUAL BEHAVIORS  
In the last 12 months  did not: 
A. Have oral, vaginal or anal intercourse with an HIV -infected partner, or a 
partner who uses injection drugs   
B. Give or receive money, drugs, gifts or services in exchange for oral, vaginal or 
anal sex  
AND  
In the last 6 months  has abstained from penile/anal or penile/vaginal intercourse , OR  
 
In the last 6 months had 4 or fewer partners of the opposite birth sex for vaginal 
and/or anal intercourse, OR  
 
Is a person born male with partner(s) born male (MSM) who, in the last 12 months : 
• Had 2 or fewer MSM partners for anal intercourse and had no unprotected 
anal sex with MSM, OR  
•  Had unprotected anal intercourse with only [ADDRESS_785506] 12 months (during which neither 
partner had any other  partners). If the monogamous relationship ended, the 
volunteer may then have had protected anal intercourse with 1 other MSM 
partner (total [ADDRESS_785507] 12 months), OR  
HVTN 303  Version 2.0  / September 21, 2023  
HVTN303_v2.0_FINAL_21SEP_2023 / Page 181 of 191 • Is a transgender person, regardless of the point on the transition spectrum, 
having sex with men (born male) and/or other transgender persons, who in the  
last 12 months : 
• Had 2 or fewer partners for anal or vaginal interco urse, and had no 
unprotected anal or vaginal sex, OR  
• Had unprotected anal or vaginal inter course sex with [ADDRESS_785508] 12 months (during which neither 
partner had any other partners). If the monogamous relationship ended, may 
then have had protected anal or vaginal sex with 1 other partner (to tal [ADDRESS_785509] 12 months).  
• AND  
Uses or intends to use condoms in situations which may include penile/anal or  
penile/vaginal intercourse with new partners of unknown HIV status, occasional 
partners,  
partners outside a primary relationsh ip, and/or partners known to have other 
partners.  
2. NON -SEXUAL BEHAVIORS  
In the last 12 months  did not: 
• Inject drugs or other substances without a p rescription  
• Use cocaine, methamphetamine, or excessive alcohol, which in the 
investigator’s judgment, rendered the participant at greater than low risk for 
acquiring HIV infection.  
The investigator’s judgment should consider local epi[INVESTIGATOR_355529].  
A volunteer is NOT appropriate for inclusion  if he/she:  
 
Acquired an STI (ie , new infection) in the last 12 months : 
 
• Syphilis  
• Gonorrhea  
• Non-gonococcal urethritis  
• Herpes Simplex Virus type 2 (HSV2)  
• Chlamydia

able to take all your PrEP medications?”  
▪ For people with a vagina having intra -vaginal intercourse: reports 
equal to or greater than 90% when asked the following: “ Thinking 
about the past 4 weeks, how many days per week were you able  to take 
all your PrEP medications?”  
• Commits to maintaining protective PrEP use throughout trial  
Note  that some anti -retroviral medications at certain dose levels may potentially 
interfere with pseudoneutralization immunogenicity assays and could be 
exclus ionary. Sites should consult the PSRT regarding eligible medications prior to 
enrolling persons on PrEP. The PrEP medication names and doses taken during 
screening and the trial should be recorded.  
2. SEXUAL BEHAVIORS  
Persons stably taking PrEP as described above for [ADDRESS_785510] 12 months  did not: 
• Inject drugs or oth er substances without a prescription  
• Use cocaine, methamphetamine, or excessive alcohol, which in the

FINAL 16May2017
3Meth odology:
This is a single -dose, randomized, double -blind, placebo -and active -contro lled, parallel -
group stud y to evaluate the analgesic onset, efficacy, and safet y profile of  
 compared with two commercial products over a four -hour period after third- molar 
extractions. Subjects will undergo dental extraction of three or fo ur third molars. Maxillary  
third molars may  be removed regardless of impaction level. The mandibular extractions 
must meet one of the following scenarios and must not result in a trauma rating of severe on 
a mild, moderate, or severe scale:
two full bony  impactions
two partial bony  impactions
one full bony  impaction in combination with one partial bony  impaction
Subjects who meet the randomization criteria (post -surgical pain of moderate to severe on 
the four -point categorical pain scale, and at least a sco re of 5 on the 11 -point [0 -10] pain 
intensity  numeric al rating scale [PI -NRS] at baseline within 4.[ADDRESS_453185] stitch from 
dental extractions) will be assigned to one of four treatment groups.
Approximately  660subjects will receive a single dose of either , ACM 
1000 mg, IBU 400 mg, or placebo in a 4:4:2:1 allocation ratio, and will be stratified 
according to gender and baseline pain rating (moderate or severe). To maintain the double -
blind nature of the stud y, an independent third party will administer study  drug to 
blindfolded subjects. No less than approximately  30% of randomized subjects will be either 
male or female. In addition, no more than approximately  30% of subjects will be 17 y ears of 
age at the tim e of screening .
Self-reporte d pain intensity  will be collected at baseline (time 0). Pain intensity  and pain 
relief will be collected at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 3, and 4 hours (± 5 minutes) post 
dose as well as at the time of rescue (if applicable) and time of meaningful pa in relief (if 
applicable) . Perceptible pain relief and meaningful pain relief will be collected using two 
separate stopwatches. Subjects who do not experience an y pain relief after dosing will be 
encouraged but not required to wait at least [ADDRESS_453186], with a 0-4 
categorical rating scale: (0) poor, (1) fai r, (2) good, (3) very good, and (4) excellent.

FINAL 16May2017
6Safety:
Safety  will be monitored and assessed by  [CONTACT_363825], evaluation, and anal ysis 
of subject -reported spontaneous adverse events (AEs).
Statistical Methods:
Time to conf irmed perceptible pain relief (TCPR) and time to meaningful pain relief 
(TMPR) will be analy zed using survival data anal ysis. The survival function (cumulative 
proportions of subjects with pain relief at each time point) and the median survival time will 
be estimated b y the Kaplan -Meier method for each treatment. The median survival times for 
the active treatments will be compared using the bootstrap re- sampling method and the 
survival functions of the active treatments will be compared with the survival fu nction of 
placebo using the Wilcoxon test.  The earliest time of separation between  and 
placebo will be established by  [CONTACT_363826] 30 minutes to successive earlier minut es in one minute 
increments, until statistical significance is no longer achieved. The dichotomized response 
will be anal yzed using logistic regression anal ysis.

6. INTRODUCTION
Acetaminophen is a par a-aminophenol derivative with analgesic and antipyretic properties , and 
is thought to produce analgesia by[CONTACT_363834] s ynthesis centrally and elevating the 
pain threshold.  Acetaminophen is available as an ove r-the-counter (OTC) analgesic and 
antipyretic in manyglobal markets. In the US, TYLENO L®is commercial ly available inextra 
strength (500 mg ) and regular strength (325 mg) dosage forms marketed under the Internal 
Analgesic, Antip yretic and Antirheumatic Drug Products for OTC Human Use Tentative Final 
Monograph.  TYLENO L®Regular Strength 325 mg is dosed 2 dosage units every 4 to 6 hours 
and TY LENO L®Extra Strength 500 mg is dosed 2 dosage units every 6 hours. It is labeled for 
the temporary relief of minor aches and pains due to the common cold, headache, backache, 
toothache, premenstrual and menstrual cramps, minor pain of arthritis, muscular aches and f or 
the temporary relief of fever.
The overall purpose of this study is to evalu ate the analgesic onset, efficacy, and safety ofa 
single dose of 1000 mg acetaminophen administered as  tablets 
compared with a single dose of 1000 mg acetaminophen administered as two commercial 
acetaminophen 500 mg caplets ( ACM ), asingle dose of 400 mg ibuprofen administered as two 
commercial ibuprofen 200 mg liquid- filled capsules (IBU), and placebo over 4hours.  
The dental pain model, a validated model of acute pain widely used to
study analgesic efficacy of compounds, will be used in this study  [1, 2].Reference Safet y

If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_54571] r, it is necessary to break the treatment code for safe ty 
reasons and circumstances allow, the Investigator will first contact [CONTACT_363838]. If there is a 
medical emergency and the Investigator deems it necessary to know the subject’s study  
treatment urgent ly for the subject’s proper medical care, the Investigator may  break the 
treatment code immediatel y, and then contact [CONTACT_363839].
In the event of a medical emergency  that necessitates breaking the code, the third- party
person(nel) will be permitted to inform the I nvestigator what study  drug the subject was given.
When the blind is broken, the I nvestigator will notify  the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_453224] 
be documented in the source document. The studysite should take the necessary measures to 
maintain the treatment blind throughout the studyand prevent a ny unintended or premature 
unblindin g.
9.5. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
The randomization schedule will be generated b ythe Sponsor to ens ure treatment blinding. The 
site will keep the randomization schedule in a locked, secured area with access limited to only  

Protocol:CO- [ADDRESS_453225]- partyperson(nel), back -up staff member, and  un- blinded monitor .After 
meeting the appropriate post -surger ycriteria, subjects will be randomized to receive one of 
four treatments (   ACM 1000 mg , IBU 400 mg or placebo ) in a 4:4:2:1 
ratio.  Subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_363840] (moderate or severe). For subjects 
with moderate baseline pain, r andomization numbers will be assigned to subjects in sequential 
order starting with the lowest available number within the appropriate gender stratum. 
Similarl y for subjects with severe baseline pain intensit y, subjects will be assigned in 
sequen tial order starting with the highest available number in the appropriate gender stratum.
9.6. Study Product Storage, Accountability and Disposal
The investigator, or an approved representative, e.g., pharmacist, will ensure that all 
investigational product is stored in a secured area, atroom temperature, 68 ºF to 77 ºF (20ºC to 
25 ºC)and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.
The investigator must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or other 
disposition of the investigational product on the Investigational Product Accountability Log 
supplied by [CONTACT_1034].  The log must identify the investigational product and randomization 
number, and account for its disposition on a subject-by-subject basis, including specific dates
administered and quantities. The logmust besigned by[CONTACT_363841], and copi[INVESTIGATOR_352386] . All Investigational 
Product and Investigational Product L ogs are kept together in a secure, double -locked location 
with access onl y allowed to the third- party person(nel) , back -up staff member and un-blinded 
monitor . At the end of the study, the Sponsor will provide instructions regarding the disposition 
of an y unused and exhausted investigational product.  Thestudysite must maintain accurate 
and adequate records including shipment receipt and return of unused investigational product 
shipments.
9.7. Preparation, Dispensing and Administration of Investigational 
Product
Investigation alproduct prep aration and dispensing will be performed on Day  1, following 
dental surgery . For subjects who meet the randomization criteria, an independent third part y 
dispenser will administer one of the following study  treatments with up to 180 ml of water at 
ambient temperature to blindfolded subjects :

a single 1000 -mg dose of acetaminophen as two commercial ACM 500 mg caplets,
a single 400 -mg dose of ibuprofen as two commercial IBU 200 mg liquid -filled 
capsules, or
a single dose of two placebo caplets .

Protocol:CO- [ADDRESS_453226]’s room. 
The third- party dispenser will prepare study  medication for each subject in a designated 
dispensing room. Study medication will be dispensed at the time that the subject’s pain level is 
determined b y verbal assessment, just prior to the completion of the baseline categorical pain 
severit y scale and the baseline 11-point [0 -10] pain intensity  numerical rating sca le [PI -NRS] .
The study  coordinator will communicate the subject’s pain severity  and gender to the 
dispenser. The dispenser will assign the next available randomization number from the 
appropriate stratum. The dispense r will dispense the appropriate study  treatment from the 
appropriate bulk suppl y containers into an ind ividual dosing cup . The double -blind label with 
the same randomization number will be affixed to the dosing cup and the tear -off portion of the 
label will be attached to the patient ’s source documents. The third- partydispenser will 
complete the study  drug dispensing record .The study  drug dispensing record will remain in a 
secure and locked area, with access limited to the unblinded third- party dispenser ,back -up
staff member , and un- blinded monitor . A second individual, with no other study  involvement, 
will witness the prepa ration and dispensing process. No other study  personnel will be present in 
the designated dispensing room at the time of study  drug dispensing.  The dispenser will ensure 
the dosing cup containing the randomized study  treatment is covered prior to exiting the 
dispensing room. 
The third- partydispenser will inform the blinded study  coordinator once the study  drug is 
dispensed and is read y to b e administered to the subject. Following completion of the baseline 
categorical pain severity  scale and baseline pain intensity  numerical rating scale , the study  
coordinator will blindfold the subject and then exit the subject’s room to inform the dispenser 
that the pain assessments are completed and confirm that the pain severit y has not changed 
from the verbal assessment used to determine the appropriate randomization, and that the pain 
intensity  numerical rating scale score qualifies the subject for randomization. If the baseline 
categorical pain severity  has changed, new study  drug from the corresponding pain stratum will 
be prepared. The dispenser will deliver the study  drug from the designated dispensing room to 
the subject’s room in a covered dosing cup to ensure no other individua l will be able to see the 
study  drug in the bottle .No other study  personnel, other than the third- party witness, will be 
present in the subject’s room at the time of dosing.
After the entering the blindfolded subjec t’s room and while the subject is sittin g up, the 
dispenser willhand the dosing cup containing the study  treatment to the blindfolded subject
and instruct the subject to empty  thecontents of the dosing cup directl y into their mouth and 
then swallow the study  medication immediately with up to [ADDRESS_453227]’s oral cavit y to ensure that the study  
treatment was swallowed .The time at which the subject swallows thestudy  medication will be 
recorded as Time 0. Study  drug will be adminis tered to the subject within [ADDRESS_453228] will not be r e-dosed but will remain in the stud y.

10.3.1. Randomization
After the dental procedure, subjects will be asked to rest quietly at the stud y center until they  
experience both post -surgical pain of at least moderate pain on a categorical scale ranging from 
(0) none to (3) severe and at least a score of 5 on the 11- point (0-10) PI- NRS within 4.[ADDRESS_453232]’s oral 
cavity to ensure that the investigational product was swallowed.
10.3. 2. Postdose Assessments
Two stopwatches labeled asperceptible and as meaningful will be used to measure “perceptible 
pain relief” and “meaningful pain relief”, r espective ly.  The face of each stopwatch will be 
covered to prevent the subject from seeing the running clock. Subjects willonly be given the 
second stopwatch after they stop th e first one.

Protocol:CO- [ADDRESS_453233]: “I would like you to stop the first stopwatch 
(perceptible ) when you first begin to feel an ypain relieving effect whatsoever of the drug, that 
is, when you first feel any pain relief.  This does not necessaril y mean you feel completely
better, although you might, but when youfirstfeelany difference in the pain you have now.  
As soon as y ou stop the stopwatch please press y our call light to notify thestudycoordinator.  I 
would like y ou to stop the second stopwatch ( meaningful ) when you have meaningful pain 
relief, that is , when the relief from the starting pain is meaningful to you. As soon as you stop 
the stopwatch, please press yo ur call light to notify thestudy coordinator.” Upon dosing, the 
investigator or the designated site staff will start both stopwatches at the same time.  Once the 
stopwatch has been stopped, the investigator or designated stu dy staff will retrieve the 
stopwatch and record the time in the source documents and CRF.
Pain relief and pain intensity will be assessed using the NRS (see APPE NDIX1)at 0.25, 0.5,
0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 3, and 4hours (± 5 minutes) after the dos e, at the time of rescue (if 
applicable), and at the time of meaningful relief (if applicable ).
At the end of the 4-hour assessment, at the time of rescue, or at the time of earl y termination if 
a subject is discontinued or withdrawn earlier than four hours after dosing, subjects will be 
asked to report their overall impression of thera py (Subject Global Evaluation) as (0) Poor, (1) 
Fair, (2) Good, (3 ) Very good, or (4) Excellent. Subjects who use rescue thera py will continue
in the study and assess pain and relief through four hours .
10.3. 3. End of Study
End of s tudyis defined as completion of the 4-hour assessments or at the time of ear ly 
terminatio n if a subject is discontinued or withdrawn earlier than four hours after the dose. 
Subjects who rescue are to remain at the stu dy site through the 4- hour assessments, which is 
their time of end of stu dy.

11.2. Safety Assessments
Safety will be monitored via AE reporting.  If an AE is reported , the subject will be asked to 
elaborate on the nature of the event.  The investigator or designated stu dy staff will evaluate 
and record according to the Adve rse Event Reporting section of the protocol.

 
Protocol:CO- [ADDRESS_453243]
FINAL 16May2017
35Normal consequences of dental surgery (e.g., dry-socket, pain, swelling, bruising) are not 
considered AEs unless the investigator believes the condition worsened or was aggravated 
following stu dy drug therap y.
11.3. Vital Signs
Vital signs will be collected at screening and baseline.  All vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and oral body temperature) will be collected after at least [ADDRESS_453244] in a 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_1662] - reclining position in a quiet setting without distractions (e.g., television, cell 
phones). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate measurements will be assessed 
with a completel yautomated device, consisting of an inflatable cuff and an oscillatory
detection system.  All values will be re gistered on an automated recorder so that measurements 
are observer indepe ndent. Manual techniques will be used onl yif an automated device has 
malfunctioned.  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_363819] [ADDRESS_453245] is medically suitable for study  participation.

Protocol:CO- [ADDRESS_453246](s) will be reported as described in the 
following sections.  For all AEs, theInvestigator or medical ly qualified individual 
(MD/DO/Dentist) must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine the outcome 
of the AEand to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a Serious Adverse 
Event (SAE) requiring immediate notification (within 24 hours) to the Sponsor or its 
designated representative.  For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by [CONTACT_363844] (MD/DO/Dentist) totryto determine causalit y.
TheInvestigator / siteis required to assess causalit y.  For AEs with a suspected causal 
relationship to the investigational product, follow-up by [CONTACT_363845] (MD/DO/Dentist) is required until the event or its sequelae r esolve or stabilize at a 
level acceptable to the Investigator, and the Sponsor concurs with that assessment.
12.2. Reporting Period
All AEs, whether serious or non -serious will be recorded on the CRF in the AE section 
beginning from the time the informed consent is signed and dated. Informed consent is 
considered the point at which the subject is p articipating in the clinical study and all events are 
captured even if it is prior to undergoing a ny study-related procedure and/or receiving 
investigational product or investigational devic e. Non-serious - AEs will be reported through 
the subject’s last study visit (or termination if the subject terminates early from thestudy for 
anyreason).  Serious AEs will be reported through and including [ADDRESS_453247]’s last dose or exposure to investigational product.  Serious AEs 
require immediate notification to the Sponsor or its designated representative.  Any SAE 
occurring a ny time after the reporting period must be promptly reported if a causal relationship 
to studyproduct is suspected.
12.3. Definition of an Adverse Eve nt
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation whether or not a subject 
is administered the investigational product ormedical devic e.  The event does not need to have 
a suspected causal relationship with the investigational produ ct or devic e.  An AE can therefore 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign, sy mptom, disease, orinjury  temporally associated 
with the use of an investigational product or device, whether or not related to the 
investigational product or devic e.  Examples of -AEs include but are not limited to:
Abnormal test findings,

An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” for a drug study if, in the view of 
either the Investigator (ph ysician/dentist) or the Sponsor, it r esults in any  of the following 
outcomes:
Results in death,
Is life-threate ning (immediate risk of death),
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],

Emergency room visits (unless the reason for the emergency room visit meets one of 
the other outcomes in the definition of serious), and/or
Same daysurgeries (as outpatient/same da y/ambulator y procedures)

Admission for treat ment of a pr e-existing condition not associated with the 
development of a new AE or with a worsening of the pr e-existing condition (e.g., for
work -up of persistent pr e-treatment lab abnormality ),
Social admission (e.g., subject has no place to sleep),
Administrative admission (e.g., for yearly phy sical exam),
Protocol -specified admission during a clinical study (e.g., for a procedure required by
[CONTACT_363847]),
Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] (e.g., or electiv e 
cosmetic surgery ),
Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures should be noted in the baseline documentation 
for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject.
Diagnostic and therapeutic non -invasive and invasive procedures, such as surger y, 
should not be reported as AEs.  However, the medical condition for which the 
procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For 
example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the AE reporting period should be 
reported as the AE and the resulting appendectom y should be recorded as treatment of 
theAE.
12.7. Resolution
The Investigator will be required to assess the outcome of the AE for investigational product
(drug or device) as one of the following:
Resolved,

Protocol:CO- [ADDRESS_453252]
FINAL 16May2017
40Not Resolved,
Fatal,
Resolved with sequelae,
Resolving, or
Unknown
Anycausal ly-related AEs unresolved upon completion of the last study visit willbefollowed 
up by [CONTACT_363848] a level acceptable to 
theInvestigator and recorded on the CRF.  An event that is assessed as resolved with sequelae 
or resolving indicates that the subject has stabilized to a level acc eptable to the Investigator and 
has concurrence by[CONTACT_92853].
12.8. Severity Assessment
The severi ty of AEs will be assessed by[CONTACT_363849] 
(MD/DO/Dentist) using the following general categori cal descriptors:
MILD:Awareness of symptoms that are easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with subject's usual function or normal everydayactivities
MODERATE: Sufficient discomfort is present to cause interference to some ext ent with 
subject's usual function or normal every dayactivity
SEVERE: Extreme distress, ca using significant impairment of functioning or 
incapacitation; interferes significantl y with subject's usual function; prevents normal everyday
activities
Note the distinction between the severi ty and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
neces sarily a serious event.  For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantl y 
with subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for SAEs, listed above.
12.9. Causality Assessment
The Investig ator’s ormedicall yqualified individual (MD/DO/Dentist) assessment of causalit y
for investigational product (i.e., relationship to investigational product) must be provided for 
all AEs (serious and nonserious).  An Investigator’s causality assessment is t he determination 
of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or 
contributed to an AE.

Protocol:CO- [ADDRESS_453253]
FINAL 16May2017
41Not Related -An AE that isnot related to the use of the drug
Doubtful - An AE for which an alternative explanation is m ore likel y, e.g., concomitant 
drug(s), concomitant disease(s), or the relationship in time suggests that a causal 
relationship to investigational product is unlikely.
Possible - An AE that might be due to the use of the drug.  An alternative explanation,
e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in 
time is reasonable; therefore, the causal relationship to investigational product cannot 
be excluded.
Probable - An AE that might be due to the use of the drug. The relationship in time is 
suggestive (e.g., confirmed by [CONTACT_23827] ) and an alternative explanation is less likely, 
e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s).
Very Likely -An AE that is listed as a possible adverse reaction and cannot be 
reasonab lyexplained by [CONTACT_4867], e.g., concomitant drug(s), 
concomitant disease(s). The relationship in time is very suggestive (e.g., it is confirmed 
by [CONTACT_35719]) for a causal relationship to the drug.
If the Investigator de termines a SAE is associated with study procedures, the Investigator must 
record this suspected causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as appropriate, and 
report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applica ble.
12.10. Exposure In Utero
For investigational products within clinical studies and for marketed products, an exposure in 
utero (EI U)occurs if:
1.   a woman is exposed to the investigational product at an y time between her last menses 
prior to concepti on through the delivery ofthebaby.
2.   There isapossibility of intrauterine exposure to drug via semen from the male partner who 
is taking the investigational product at the time of conception, thereb ypossibly  exposing the 
fetus to the product.
If any study subject or study subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
studysubject’s participation, the Investigator must report the pregn ancyto the Sponsor on a 
Pregnancy Notification Form (to be provided by [CONTACT_363850] e). In addition, the
Investigator must submit information regarding environmental exposure to a Sponsor product 
in a pregnant woman (e.g., a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a
cytotoxic product by  [CONTACT_4691][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) using the Pregnanc yNotification Form.  This must 
be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and notification must occur within 24 
hours of awareness of the pregnanc y. Initial notification via telephone to the Sponsor’s study
team contact [CONTACT_363851]’s awareness of the pregnanc y. 
The Pregnanc y Notification Form must then be sent to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the site’s 

Protocol:CO- [ADDRESS_453254]
FINAL 16May2017
42awareness. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see 
below for information related to induced termination of pregnancy ).
Follow-up is conducted to obtain pregnancy outcome information on all EIU reports.  The 
Investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion or until pregnancy termination (i.e., 
induced abor tion) and then notify the Sponsor of the outcome.  The Investigator will provide 
this information as a follow- up to the initial Drug Exposure during Pregnancy  Collection Form 
A and/or End of Pregnancy Collection Form B (provided by [CONTACT_363852]).  
The reason(s) for an induced abortion should be specified.  An EIU report is not created when 
an ectopic pregnancy report is received since this pregnancy is not usuall yviable.  Rather, a
SAE case is created with the event of ectopic pregnancy.
TheInvestigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs if the outcome of the 
pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as a SAE (i.e., spontaneous abortion, 
stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y[including that in an abor ted fetus, stillbirth, or 
neonatal death]). I n the case of a live birth, the “normalit y” of the newborn can be assessed at 
the time of birth (i.e., no minimum follow -up period of a presumably normal infant is required 
before an End of Pregnancy Collection Form B can be completed).  The “normalit y” of an 
aborted fetus can be assessed by [CONTACT_4692], unless pre- abortion test findings are 
suggestive of a congenital anomaly.
Additional pregnancy outcomes that are classified as SAEs and should be reported as such
include:
“Spontaneous abortion” includes miscarriage and missed abortion.
All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_453255] to causalit y.
Anyinfant death after [ADDRESS_453256] will be questioned abo ut AEs.
12.10.3. Reporting Requirements
Each AE is to be assessed to de termine if it meets the criteria for a SAE. If aSAE occurs, 
expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.

Protocol:CO- [ADDRESS_453257]
FINAL 16May2017
43All AEs will be reported on the AE page(s) of the CRF.  A Clinical Serious Adverse Event 
(SAE) Report Form must also be completed if the event is considered to be serious. It should 
be noted that this Clinical SAE Report Form for collection of SAE information is not the same 
as the AE CRF.  Where the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a 
consistent manner.  For example, the same AE term should be used on both forms.  Adverse 
events should be reported using concise medical terminology on the CRFs as well as on the 
form for collection of SAE information.
[IP_ADDRESS].  Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
If aSAE occurs, the Sponsor is to be initially notified by[CONTACT_363853] y upon 
awareness of the event by [CONTACT_737]’s site. Within 24 hours of the Investigator site’s
awareness of the event, the study site must send the Sponsor the Clinical SAE Report Form. 
This timeframe also applies to additional new information (follo w-up) on previously  forwarded 
SAE reports as well as to the initial and follow- up reporting of EIU cases. Inthe rare event 
that the I nvestigator’s site does not become aware of the occurrence of a SAE immediately
(e.g., if an outpatient study subject initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the I nvestigator’s site is 
to report the event immediately after learning of it as described and document the time of the 
studysite’s first awareness of the adverse event.
For all SAEs, the Investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to the Sponsor in 
accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above. In addition, an Investigator may
berequested by[CONTACT_363854] -up information in an expedited 
fashion.  This information may be more detailed than that captured on the adverse event CRF. 
In general, this will include a description of the A E in sufficient detail to all ow for a complete 
medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality. 
Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant medications and 
illnesses must be provided. In the case of a subject death, a sum mary of available autop sy 
findings (if available) and death certificate should be collected if permission is obtained from 
the subject’s fami ly.  For a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a copyof the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_363822]. If obtained, these docum ents (with subject’s personal identifiers redacted) should 
be submitted as soon as possible to the Sponsor or its designated representative.
Appropriate SAE forms will be provided to the study site at the initiation of the study.  Upon 
notification of an S AE at the study site, the Investigator or designated stud y site staff should 
call and speak to their Sponsor’s study manager contact [CONTACT_363855].
Within 24 hours of awareness of the event, the Investigator or designated study site staff:
complete the Clinical SAE Report Form ([provided by [CONTACT_1034]] with as much 
information as possible, however at a minimum, the subject identification number, 
name [CONTACT_185317], SAE, and name [CONTACT_213022]);
ensures the Inve stigator signs the Clinical SAE Report Form prior to sending to the

The Sponsor will be responsible for the statistical ana lysis o fstudydata.  Detailed 
methodology for the statistical analy sis of the data will be documented in a Statistical Anal ysis 
Plan finalized and approved prior to database lock and release of randomization codes.
13.1. Samp le Size Determination
A simulation [3]was conducted based on the two previ ous dental pain studies 
 to evaluate the sample size and power 
within different effect size range s.  Based on the simulation results, the time to confirmed 
perceptible pain relief (TCPR) is identified as the p rimary  efficacy  endpoint, and the primary  
interest is to compare the median survival times in TCPR between  and ACM. Based 
on the assumption that the median survival time of  will be faster than that of ACM 
within the range of 5.0 –5.5 min utes, a sample size of n=240 for the  and ACM 
groups will provide 90% power. If the median survival time in TCPR of  is assumed 
tobe faster than that of IBU within the range of 6.0 – 6.5 minutes, the sample size of n=240 for 
the  group and n=120 for the IBU group will provide greater than 90%  power.
Based on the above, it is recommended that the eligible subjects will be randomly  assigned in a 
ratio of 4:4:2:[ADDRESS_453260].

Protocol:CO- [ADDRESS_453261] deviation, median and range (min, max).  For categorical variables, the number 
and percent of subjects in each response category will be presented .
13.4. Previous and Concomitant Medica tions
Previous and concomitant medications will be coded.  Previous medications will be those that 
were discontinued before the surgery day.  Concomitant medications will be those continued 
through, or started on, the surgery day. In addition, those medications taken between study end 
and the follow -up interview for an adverse event will be considered concomitant medications .  
Medications taken after EndofStudy (see Section 10.3. 3)and up to the follo w-up call that 
were not taken for an adverse event will no t be collected on the CRF or summarize d. Previous 
medications and concomitant medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_363858].  
Number and percentage of subjects receiving each coded medication will be presented by
[CONTACT_3148]. Additionall y, concomitant medications taken by [CONTACT_55559] 5% of 
subjects in at least one treatment g roup will be presented.
13.5. Efficacy Analysis
Primary efficacy endpoint
 Time to confirmed perceptible pain relief
Secondary efficacy endpoints
Time to m eaningful pain relief ;
Percentage of subjects with confirmed perceptible relief from 30 minutes to 
successivel y earlier minutes in one -minute increments (  versus placebo )
Tertiary efficacy endpoints
Percentage of subjects with meaningful pain relie f at 35, 40, and 45 minutes (

respectivel y.
Besides the primary  hypothesis, the median survival times in TCPR between  and 
IBU will be compared. The median survival times in TMPR will be compared between  
vsACM and between  vs IBU.
The survival functions of the active treatments will be compared with the survival function of 
placebo.
To control the famil y-wise T ype I error rate at 0.05 for primary  and secondary  endpoints, the 
fixed sequence testing with fallback method will be used [4]. Table 5presents the order of the 
tests and the assigned α values for each ordered test. The comparison of  to I BU in 
TMPR is not included in the fixed testing sequence. Testing will commence with an assigned 
alpha = 0.049 and an alpha value of 0.001 will be reserved for the comparison of  
and placebo on the percentage of subjects with confirmed perceptible relief from 30 minutes to 
successivel y earlier minutes in one -minute increments.

13.7. Data Computations and Data Imputations
13.7.1. Time to Confirmed Perceptible and Meaningful Pain Relief
The time to meaningful pain relief is defined as the time (in minutes) elapsed from dosing until 
the subject stopped the second stopwatc h.  Time to confirmed perceptible pain relief is defined 
as the time (in minutes) to perceptible pain relief as indicated on the first stopwatch , provided 
that the subject also stopped the second stopwatch indicating meaningful pain relief.
For these relief variables, subjects who do not have relief by 4hours, who take re scue 
medication before having relief, or who discontinue before having relief will have their time of 
relief set to 4hours and be censored at 4hours.
13.7.2. Endpoints Relating to Pain Intensity and Pain Relief
The pain intensity difference (PID) at each time point will be derived by [CONTACT_363859].  A higher value is indicative of a greater 
improvement.
Time-weighted sum of the pain intensity difference scores (SP ID)willbederived by[CONTACT_363860] b y the time from the previous time point, and adding them together 
for each scheduled time point from 0 -4hours. T ime-weighted total pain relief (TOTPAR) for 
each specified interval will be similarly derived.
Pain intensity and pain relief rat ings provided at times differing from the intended times by  
[CONTACT_726] ± 5 minutes for the scores up to 90 minutes pos t-dose, and by[CONTACT_726] ± [ADDRESS_453264] to the remaining time points; pain relief scores after rescue 
medication will be set to zero. For subjects who discontinue the study early,the same 
imputation approach will be used.

4913.8. Analysis Methods
13.8.1. Time to Confirmed Perceptible and Meaningful Relief
Time to confirmed perceptible pain relief (TCPR) and time to meaningful pain relief (TMPR) 
will be anal yzed using survival data analy sis. The survival function (cumulative proportions of 
subjects with pain relief at each time point) and the median survival time will be estimated by  
[CONTACT_8761]- Meier method for each treatment. The median survival times forthe active 
treatments will be comp ared using the bootstrap re -sampling method ,and the survival 
functions of the active treatments will be compared with the survival function of placebo using 
the Wilcoxon test. The median survival time is chosen as an endpoint for evaluating the effect 
of time to onset, and the bootstrap method is an appropriate method for comparing the median 
survival time when the survival functions are non- proportional.
13.8.2. Earliest Statistically Significant Separation of  and Placebo on
Percentage of Subjects with Confirmed Perceptible Relief
The earliest time of separation between  and placebo will be established by  
[CONTACT_363861] 30 
minutes to successive earlier minutes in on e minute increments, until statistical significance is 
no longer achieved. The dichotomized response will be analyzed using logistic regression 
analysis.
13.8. 3. Percentage of Subjects with Meaningful Pain Relief at 35, 40, and 45 minutes
The percentage of subjects with meaningful pain relief at 35, 40 and 45 minutes will be

Determine the adequacy of the facilities
Discuss with the investigator(s) and other site personnel their responsibilities with 
regard to protocol adherence as well as the stud yand monitoring responsibilities of 
[COMPANY_012] or its representatives.  These responsibiliti es will be documented in 
a Clinical Study Agreement between [COMPANY_012] and the investigator. During
the stud y, a monitor from [COMPANY_012] or representative will have regular 
contacts with the investigational site, for th e following:
Provide inf ormation and support to the investigator(s)
Confirm that facilities remain acceptable
Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurate ly recorded in the CRF , and that investigational product a ccountability checks 
are being performed
Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the case 
report forms with the subject’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and other 
records relevant to the study . This will require direct a ccess to all original records for 
each subject (e.g., clinic charts).

16.1. Case Report Form s/ Electronic Data Record
All data will be collected on source documents first and then recorded in an Electronic Data 
Capture (EDC) sy stem. The EDC s ystem is the database where pertinent study data are 
collected such as demograph y, subject randomization, efficacy assessments, adverse events, 
and subject disposition. EDC CRFs should be completed for each included subject. The 
completed pages of the EDC system are the sole propert y of the Sponsor and should not be 
made available in a nyform to third parties, except for authorized representatives of the 
Sponsor or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from the Sponsor .
It is the Investigator's responsibility to ensure completion and to review and approve all 
inform ation captured in the EDC. The subject ’s data in the EDC s ystem must be electronicall y
signed by [CONTACT_737]. These signatures serve to attest that the information contained in the 
EDC system is true. At all times, the Investigator has final personal responsibility for the 
accuracy and authentici ty of all clinical and labor atory  data entered in the EDC. Subject source 
documents are the Investigator's/p hysician's subject records maintained at the study site. In 
cases where the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31019]'s chart, the information 
collected in the EDC must match those charts. All final data recorded in EDC system will be 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_530] i nto files and kept by [CONTACT_1034] . A co pyof these files will also be kept at the clinical 
site. All data provided in the CRF m ust be supported by  [CONTACT_363865]. For this stud y, the 
Sponsor will provide specific worksheets (NRS scales /Subject Global Evaluation) to serve as 
source document tools to collect pain intensity , pain relief, and global evaluation.
16.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or the Sponsor, the investigator 
agrees to keep records including the identit y of all participating subjects (sufficient information 
to link records, e.g., CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all ori ginal signed informed cons ent forms, 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], SAE report forms, source documents, and detailed rec ords of treatment 
disposition. The records should be retained b ythe investigator according to I CH guidelines, 
local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study  Agree ment, whichever is longer.
If the investigator relocates, retires, or for a ny reason withdraws from the stud y, the Sponsor 
should be prospective ly notified. The study records must be transferred to an acceptable 
designee, such as another investigator, an other i nstitution, or to the Sponsor. The investigator 
must obtain Sponsor's written permission before disposing of an yrecords, even if retent ion 
requirements have been met.

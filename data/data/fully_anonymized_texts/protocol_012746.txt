Version 7.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 6  
This study consists of arms r eceiving ASP7517 monotherapy and arms receiving ASP7517 and 
pembrolizumab combination therapy in phase 1 (dose escalation cohort) and phase 2 (dose 
expansion cohort). Phase 2 monotherapy and combination dose expansion cohorts will be opened 
after the phase  1 dose escalation has been completed  for the monotherapy and the combination 
therapy, independently . 
In this study, 28 days will define each cycle during Cycles 1 to 6.  
Additional cohort may be added by a protocol amendment to further evaluate ASP7517 as  a single 
agent and/or in combination with another anti -cancer agent.  
ASP7517 Monotherapy Arm  
This arm will consist of Screening (up to 28 days); Treatment (up to 6 doses); End of Treatment 
(EOT) visit; Safety follow -up (30, 60 and 90 days); Observation P eriod (up to 48 weeks); and 
Survival follow -up (up to 12 months).  
Participants will receive [ADDRESS_409214] not met any individual treatment discontinuation 
criteria and are receiving clinical benefit (defined as radiological response or stable disease [SD], 
or reduction of disease -related symptoms) will continue further treatment with ASP7517, as 
decided by [CONTACT_093].  
After completing 4  cycles of treatment, participants who achieve confirmed complete response 
(CR) will not continue with ASP7517, and participants who achieve partial response (PR) or SD 
may receive an additional [ADDRESS_409215]. After the EOT visit, participants will complete 30 -day, 60-day and 90 -day safety follow -up 
visits.  
All participants will enter an observation period except those with confirmed disease progression 
by [CONTACT_331026] (iRECIST) (iCPD), unconfirmed disease 
progression disease based on iRECIST (iUPD) (per independent central review or local review) 
and who are not  clinically stable or clinical progression is confirmed by [CONTACT_093]. 
Participants in the Observation Period will be followed for up to [ADDRESS_409216] of Screening (up to 28  days); Treatment period (up to 6 doses of ASP7517 in 
combination with up to 4 doses of pembrolizumab); Observation Period (up to 96 weeks); EOT 
visit; 30-day, 60-day and 90 -day Safety follow -up; and Survival follow -up (up to 12 months). 
Pembrolizumab monotherapy may be extended up to a total of [ADDRESS_409217] not met any individual 
treatment discontinuation criteria and are receiving clinical benefit (defined as ra diological 
response or SD, or reduction of disease -related symptoms)  will continue further treatment with 
ASP7517 and pembrolizumab as decided by [CONTACT_093] . 
Participants who achieve confirmed CR within the first 4 cycles will not receive further treatment 
with ASP7517 at Cycle 5 and Cycle 6  (end of Treatment period) and participants who achieve PR 
or SD after 4  doses may receive additional 2 doses of ASP7517 i n combination with 
pembrolizumab.  
Sponsor: APGD  ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_409218] clinical disease progression per independent central review or local review, 
will enter the Observation Period to monitor treatment response. Participants in the Observation  
Period will be followed for up to 96 weeks until iCPD (confirmed by [CONTACT_331027]), initiation of a new anticancer therapy or meetin g [ADDRESS_409219] 
(IP), all participants will complete an EOT visit, along with [ADDRESS_409220] dose of  IP or prior to the initiation of new anticancer treatment.  
All participants will be followed for survival, subsequent anticancer treatments and treatment 
outcomes following the conclusion of the Observation Period. Survival follow -up will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_317186] 3 months for up to 12 months.  
Phase 1 Dose Escalation   
Both the monotherapy and combination arms will evaluate escalating doses of ASP7517 in 
approximately 9  to 12 participants evaluable for dose limiting toxicit ies (DLTs). In the combination 
therapy arm , a fixed dose of 400 mg pembrolizumab will be evaluated in combination with 
ASP7517 . The starting dose level of ASP7517 is 1 x 107 cells/dose. The dose of ASP7517 may be 
escalated to 1  x 108 cells/dose or de -escalated to 1 x 106 cells/dose based on the assessment of 
safety variables, including the occurrence of DLTs.  
Dose escalation will be guided according the Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design [ Liu & 
Yuan, 2015 ] to determine the next dose level based on DLT occurrence.  
Study enrollment and study treatment will be temporarily interrupted during dose escalation of 
monotherapy or combination therapy arms pending review of the following:  
● Any death that is not related to disease progression occurring within 30 days of receiving IP 
● Occurrence of 2 grade ≥ 4 DLTs in 2 study participants  
● Any grade 4 hypersensitivity reaction/anaphylaxis  
In the Monotherapy Arm Dose Escalation Cohort, the starting dose level is 1 × 107 cells/dose and 
the decision to escalate to the next dose levels (1  × 108 cells/dose) will be made based on the 
assessment of safety variables, including the occurrence of DLTs. Dose level may be de -escalated 
to a lower dose level (1 × 106 cells/dose) based on the occurrence of DLTs.    
The initial dose escalation cohort o f ASP7517 in combination with pembrolizumab will use a dose 
of ASP7517 1 × 107 cells/dose. In the combination treatment arm, a [ADDRESS_409221] 1 hour after the 
completion of  the pembrolizumab infusion.  
The decision to escalate to the next dose level (1 × 108 cells/dose) will be made based on the 
assessment of safety variables, including the occurrence of DLTs. A dose level of ASP7517 may be 
de-escalated to a lower dose level  (1 × 106 cells/dose) based on the occurrence of DLTs.

Version 7.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 6  
Dose Escalation and Safety Committee : 
A Dose Escalation and Safety Committee (DESC) consisting of sponsor representatives and 
investigators will convene once a dose level cohort completes the DLT obs ervation period and data 
are available for review. Additional details regarding responsibilities, membership requirements 
and safety review time points are included in the DESC Charter. The DESC will also review the 
aggregate safety data from the phase 1 d ose escalation and phase 2 expansion cohorts.  
While safety data from the DLT observation period in the escalation cohorts are the minimum 
safety data needed for the DESC meeting, all available safety findings will be considered by [CONTACT_317190]. The DESC will assess whether a longer DLT observation period is warranted based on 
emerging data. Additionally, only when determining the RP2D, the DESC may choose a more 
conservative dosing decision than the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD) selected by [CONTACT_331028], 
based on evaluation of the safety data and other available data.  
The decision on the dose level for the next cohort will be based on the BOIN design. In addition, 
MTD will be determined by [CONTACT_331029] 6 participants. The d ose for phase 2 expansion will 
not be higher than the MTD.  
Participant Replacement during Dose Escalation Cohort  
Participants may be replaced in the dose escalation cohort if:  
● Participant is discovered to have enrolled without fully satisfying eligibility criteria 
● Participant received less than the planned dose in Cycle 1 for reasons other than DLT  
● Participant has no DLT and withdraws from the study before the end of DLT evaluation 
period 
The decision regarding replacement of individual participants will be made by [CONTACT_317187]. Participants  who experience DLTs in the dose escalation 
cohort will not be replaced.  
Dose evaluation and dose escalat ion stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_330965] 0.30 and optimal interval of (0.236, 0.359) are as follows:  
Action Number of Participants Treated at 
Current Dose Level  
3 4 5 6 7 8 
Escalate dose if number of participants with DLT ≤  0 0 1 1 1 1 
Stay at current dose level if number of participants with DLT =  1 1 - 2 2 2 
De-escalate if number of participants with  
DLT = 2 2 2 or 3 3 3 or 4 3 or 4 
Stop if number of participants with DLT ≥  3 3 4 4 5 5 
DLT: dose limiting toxicity  
Dose escalation within individual participants will not be allowed.  
Maximum Tolerated Dose  
The MTD determination will be based on at least 6 evaluable participants at that dose level based 
on the BOIN design. Based on the observed DLT(s) during the DLT observat ion period, the MTD 
is the highest dose for which the isotonic estimate of the DLT rate is closest to, but not over, the 
target DLT rate of 0.[ADDRESS_409222] 6  participants. 
Determination of MTD will be done for monotherapy and combination therapy separately.  
Sponsor: APGD  ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_409223]  6 participants. 
Determination of RP2D will be done for monotherapy and combination therapy separately.  
Phase 2 Monotherapy Arm Dose Expansion Cohort  
Monotherapy dose expansion will be opened after the phase 1 monotherapy arm dose escalation 
has been com pleted and RP2D is established . If confirmed response (PR based on iRECIST [iPR] 
or a CR based on iRECIST [iCR] per independent central review ) is observed in a monotherapy 
arm dose escalation cohort, a tumor -specific dose expansion cohort may be opened in  that tumor 
type after the phase 1 dose escalation has been completed. Additionally, once RP2D is determined, 
melanoma expansion cohort may be opened ( even if no response is observed in the dose escalation 
cohort). Participants with CPI [INVESTIGATOR_330966]. If antitumor activity was observed in dose escalation or 
melanoma dose exp ansion Stage 1, expansion cohorts for CRC and ovarian cancer may be opened. 
Objective response rate per iRECIST (iORR), as confirmed per independent central review, is 
monitored using the Bayesian optimal phase 2 (BOP2) design [ Zhou et al, 2017 ]. In case t he 
enrollment for both the monotherapy arm escalation cohort and combination arm escalation cohort 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_330967], participants will be randomized to either monotherapy or combination 
cohort in 1:1 ratio.  
When escalation and expansion cohorts are  both open for enrollment, enrollment into escalation 
cohorts takes priority such that participants who are eligible for both will be preferentially enrolled 
in the escalation cohorts. Additionally, enrollment in the expansion cohorts may be prematurely 
closed at the discretion of the sponsor.  
UNIQUE to Japan Sites  
Japanese participants will be enrolled in the monotherapy arm of the dose expansion cohort.  
Phase 2 Combination Therapy Arm Dose Expansion Cohort  
The combination therapy arm dose expansion cohor t will be opened after the phase 1 dose 
escalation cohort has been completed and MTD/RP2D of ASP7517 combination therapy  has been 
determined. Metastatic melanoma CPI [INVESTIGATOR_28947]ïve cohort will be opened. If 5 confirmed responses (iPR 
or iCR, per independent central  review) were observed in metastatic melanoma CPI [INVESTIGATOR_28947]ïve 
participants, expansion cohorts for CRC, ovarian cancer and metastatic melanoma CPI [INVESTIGATOR_330968]. In addition, if a confirmed response (iPR or iCR, per independent central review) 
was observed in metastatic melanoma CPI [INVESTIGATOR_330969], an 
expansion cohort for melanoma refractory participants may be opened for combination arm 
therapy, if not yet opened.  
Replacement of Participants in Phase 2 Dose Expansion Coh ort 
If a participant in a phase 2 dose expansion cohort is not response evaluable (defined as the 
response analysis set [RAS]), an additional participant may be enrolled in that cohort based on 
sponsor discretion.

Version 7.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 6 2 INTRODUCTION  
In this study (7517 -CL-1101), ASP7517 is indicated as a single agent and in combina tion 
with pembrolizumab in participants  with advanced solid tumors known to express the Wilms’ 
tumor protein 1 (WT1) antigen.   
Details about ASP7517 are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
Details about pembrolizumab are provided in the summary of product characteristics/package 
insert of this product.  
2.1 Study Rationale  
Accumulating evidence indicates that the WT1 gene plays an oncogenic function in 
leukemogenesis and tumorigenesis. The WT1 gene is highly expressed in leukemia and 
various types of sol id tumors (e.g., melanoma, ovarian cancer and colon cancer) and is listed 
at the top of the ranking of tumor antigen [ Sugiyama, 2010] . In addition, WT1 tumor antigen 
expression plays an important role in the progression of disease and prognosis of human 
malignancies [ Qi, 2015; Sugiyama, 2010] . ASP7517 has effects against WT1 expressing 
tumors by [CONTACT_331034] (innate immunity) and WT1 -specific T 
cell dependent antitumor effects (adaptive immunity). Nonclinical studies were perfo rmed to 
demonstrate that both the innate and adaptive immune systems were activated by [CONTACT_331035] (aAVC). In addition, nonclinical data suggest that ASP7517 is active in 
WT1 expressing tumor as described in Sections [IP_ADDRESS].5, [IP_ADDRESS]. 6 and [IP_ADDRESS].7 of the 
Investigator’s Brochure; therefore, ASP7517 treatment for solid tumors known to express 
WT1 may result in clinical benefit.  
2.2 Background  
The WT1 gene was isolated as the gene responsible for a childhood renal neoplasm, Wilms’ 
tumor, wh ich was thought to arise as a result of inactivation of both alleles of the WT1 gene 
located at chromosome 11p13 [ Gessler et al, 1990 ]. This gene encodes a zinc finger 
transcription factor that plays an important role in cell growth and differentiation [ Sugiyama, 
2001]. 
The WT1 gene is also expressed at high levels in almost all types of solid tumors, with its 
expression level serving as a significant prognostic factor. Cancers over -expressing WT1 
include melanoma, leukemia, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, glioblastoma, soft tissue sarcoma 
and colorectal cancer (CRC) [ Bejrananda et al, 2010; Wagner et al, 2008; Nakatsuka et al, 
2006; Miyoshi et al, 2002; Menssen et al, 2000; Oji et al, 1999; Miwa et al, 1992] . 
In addition to its prognostic role in a variety of cancer types [ Köbel et al, 2008; Sotobori et al, 
2006], WT1 is recognized as a promising target for immunotherapy based on its unique 
features [Dao et al, 2013;  Cheever et al, 2009]. In addition, WT1 tumor antigen expression 
plays an important role in t he disease progression of human malignancies [ Qi, 2015; 
Sugiyama, 2010] .  
Sponsor: APGD  ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_409276] WT1 -expressing tumors by [CONTACT_331036] (NK) 
cell activity (innate immunity) and WT1 -specific T cell -dependent antitumor effects 
(adaptive i mmunity).  
Nonclinical pharmacology studies were performed to demonstrate that both the innate and 
adaptive immune system were activated by [CONTACT_317203]. Activation of innate immunity was 
demonstrated in a mouse lung metastatic cancer model, where NK cell depletion  resulted in 
reduced antitumor effects. Activation of adaptive immunity was demonstrated in a second 
mouse model where mice were inoculated with AML tumor cells that either expressed WT1 
or did not express WT1. In this model, aAVC  (NIH3T3) -WT1 (ASP7517 sur rogate) 
prolonged survival in the mice inoculated with the WT1 -expressing tumor cells. In addition, 
studies of ASP7517 surrogate demonstrated increase of the production of CD8+ T cells 
secreting IFN γ by [CONTACT_317236]1 peptide stimulation. For additional information o n ASP7517 please 
refer to Investigator’s Brochure.  
2.2.[ADDRESS_409277] 2 years in 2017 [ Luke et 
al, 2017]. However, approximately 60% to 70% of patients that receive anti -programmed cell 
death protein 1 (anti -PD-1) therapy do not respond to treatment. Furthermore, acquired 
resistance is common, causing some patients who initially responded to the therapy to later 
experience disease progression. A recent study found that nearly 25% of patients with 
melanoma who initially had received an objective response had disease recurrence at 
follow-up (a median of 21 months) [ Simeone & Ascierto, 2017] . Therefore, there is a hi gh 
unmet need that persists for this patient population.  
2.2.2 Colorectal Cancer  
CRC is one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths worldwide [ Fitzmaurice et al, 
2017]. Nearly 20% of CRC patients have metastasis at diagnosis [Christensen et al, 2018]. 
The treatment is palliative in the majority of these patients and the goal of treatment is to 
increase the quality of life and prolong overall survival (OS) [ Weeks et al, 2012] . Stage 4 
CRC has a poor prognosis, with a less than 10% 5 -year survival rate and a  median survival 
time of approximately 5 months in patients who receive optimal supportive care without 
chemotherapy [ Zacharakis et al, 2010] ; and a 5-year survival rate less than 20% with 
chemotherapy, presenting the need of new therapy to address the hig h unmet need that 
persists for this patient population [ American Cancer Society 2020; Siegel et al, 2014] .  
2.2.3 Ovarian Cancer  
Ovarian cancer is predominantly diagnosed in postmenopausal women, and due to the lack of 
symptoms in early stages, 75% of patients a re diagnosed in advanced stages of the disease 
[Doubeni et al, 2016] . Most patients diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer develop 
platinum resistant/refractory disease [ Matsuo et al, 2010] . The median progression -free 
survival time for recurrent ovarian c ancer is less than 6 months, and median overall survival 
is less than 15 months [Shimokawa et al, 2018] . Recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_330975]: APGD  ISN/Protocol 7517 -CL-1101

Version 7.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 6 generally considered an incurable disease and second -line chemotherapy may be 
administered for palliation of symptoms and extension of survival [ Adams et al, 1998;  
Ozols, 1997].  
Based on the above, the majority of patients with melanoma, CRC and ovarian cancer are not 
cured with available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], underscoring the urgent need for new therapeutic alternatives 
that will improve the clinical outcomes of these patients.  
This study will include participants with locally progressive (unresectable) or metastatic solid 
tumor malignancies known to express WT1 antigen, including but not limited to melanoma, 
ovarian cance r and CRC, who have received all standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (except CPI -naïve 
melanoma in phase 2) . This study may contribute to an unmet medical need.  
2.3 Risk/Benefit Assessment

[IP_ADDRESS] Liver  
Preclinical studies demonstrated that liver could be the target organ of toxicity for ASP7517, 
which is related to  the activation of an innate immune response by [CONTACT_1601] α -GalCer 
linked to CD1d on the surface of ASP7517 to natural killer T (NKT) cells. The activation of 
NKT cells is thought to be responsible for the hepatic injury induced with ASP7517. The 
hepatic findings could be monitored (increased a spartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine 
aminotransferase [ALT] 1 day after administration) and were completely reversed by 28 days 
after ASP7517 administration. The AEs in mice included increased liver weight, AS T and 
ALT elevation, embolus, hepatocyte focal necrosis, mixed inflammatory cell infiltration, 
microgranuloma, granulomatous inflammation, mononuclear cell aggregation and pi[INVESTIGATOR_330977]. Close monitoring of liver function and toxici ties is required 
during clinical studies.

[IP_ADDRESS] Pancreas  
Edema was noted in gross pathology at doses of 1 × 107 cells/kg and higher doses 1 day after 
the sixth dose. This finding fully resolved by 7 or 28 days after the sixth dose. Histological 
assessment showed the presence of focal necrosis at a dose of 1 × 108 cells/kg 7 days after the 
second dose. After the sixth dose, acinar cell necrosis and interstitial edema on 1 day, and 
mononuclear cell infiltration and focal acinar cell necrosis on 7 days, were observed at 
1 × 107 cells/kg and higher doses. No edema or cell necrosis was observed [ADDRESS_409282]-level for the toxicity in the pancreas was 1 × 106 cells/kg. 
These findings were partially or fully resolved 28 days after the second or the sixth dose.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Kidney 
Increased serum creatinine was seen [ADDRESS_409283] monitoring of kidney 
function parameters (creatinine, blood urea nitrogen) is recommended in clinical studies.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Spleen 
Spleen weights were increased  [ADDRESS_409284] hematology testin g is recommended in clinical studies.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion-related Reactions  
In nonclinical studies with ASP7517, IRRs/cytokine -release syndrome (CRS) was not seen. 
However, there are potential toxicities with intravenous infusion immunotherapy and the 
exact mechanism  causing standard infusion reactions is unclear, but most reactions appear to 
arise from cytokine release from immune -mediated mechanisms [ Lee et al, 2014] . 
The symptoms and signs associated with a standard infusion reaction include fever, shaking 
chills, flushing and/or itching, changes in heart rate and blood pressure, shortness of breath or 
chest discomfort, pain in back or abdomen, nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea and skin rash.  
Sponsor: APGD  ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_409285] infusion r eaction, CRS may 
result in neurologic signs and symptoms such as mental status changes, confusion and 
delirium. Renal and hepatic manifestations may include azotemia, elevated transaminases and 
hyperbilirubinemia, respective ly. Coagulation parameters may  also be affected and manifested 
by [CONTACT_60643] D -dimer and hypofibrinogenemia, with or without bleeding. In addition, tumor 
lysis syndrome may also be associated with CRS [Lee et al, 2014] . Participants should be 
closely monitored for IRRs and CRS and appropri ately managed per standard of care.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Allergic Reactions and Anaphylaxis  
Based on the nonclinical data, no signs or symptoms of allergic reaction or anaphylaxis were 
seen following ASP7517 administration. The signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis overlap 
with those of standard infusion reactions. However, certain features are highly suggestive of 
anaphylaxis, such as urticaria, repetitive cough, wheeze, throat tightness and change in voice, 
angioedema (usually of face, eyelids or lip), hypotension, loss of consci ousness, nausea, 
vomiting, abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_317147]. Participants should be monitored closely for any 
signs or symptoms of allergic reaction or anaphylaxis and managed appropriately per 
standard of care.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Other 
AEs reported from solid tumor, early ph ase clinical trials using α -GalCer based 
immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_31430]: fever, headache, fatigue, dizziness, chest pain, lymphopenia, hot 
flash, hyperkalemia, lactate dehydrogenase increase, creatinine increase, anemia,  increased 
cancer pain and hyperbilirubinem ia. In general, these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_330978]  [Kunii et al, 2009;  Motohashi et al, 2009;  Uchida et 
al, 2008; Ishikawa et al, 2005] . 
The AEs reported in early phase WT1 - peptide vaccine clinical studies  in AML and MDS 
patients were mainly grade 1 or 2 events including, fatigue, headache, pruritus, muscular 
weakness, bone pain, pain in extremity, flushing, dry skin, transient local erythema and 
induration, fever, transient erythema nodosum -like lesions an d persistent cough. Also, grade 
3 and 4 AEs reported as lymphocyte count decrease, neutrophil count decrease, white blood 
cell count decrease and platelet count decrease. Overall, the protocol treatments were well 
tolerated and associated only with transie nt local grade 1 or 2 toxicities [ Maslak, 2018; 
Keilholz et al, 2009] . 
In addition, based on the above and the mechanism of action of ASP7517, immune -related 
adverse reactions (e.g., fever, headache, fatigue, hot flashes, diarrhea and muscular and joint 
pain) should be considered and managed as required per standard of care. In addition, the 
study medical monitor should be contact[CONTACT_331037], follow up and study 
treatment management.

Version 7.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 6 Pembrolizumab may cause severe or life -threatening infusion -reactions including severe 
hypersensitivity or anap hylaxis. Signs and symptoms usually develop during or shortly after 
drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion. 
Dose modification and toxicity management guidelines on pembrolizumab associated 
infusion reaction  are provided in [ Section 10.8 Appendix 8: Infusion Reaction Dose  
Modification and Treatment (Guidelines for ASP7517 and Pembrolizumab) ; Section 10.9

Section 10.10 Appendix 10: Dose Modification and Toxicity Management for 
Immune-related AEs; an d Section 10.11 Appendix 11 Dose Modification and Toxicity 
Management of Infusion Reactions Related to Pembrolizumab] . 
Note: There is a potential for an increase of rate and/or frequency on  immune-related adverse 
events (irAEs) due to the overlap of immune therapy.   
2.3.2 Risk Mitigation  
The study population is restricted to participants with advanced/metastatic solid tumors who 
have received, declined or had a contraindication to all therapy with established clinical 
benefit for their malignancy. Strict adherence to the eligibility criter ia is essential to ensure 
investigators select appropriate participants for participation in the study.  
Additionally, the following precautions mitigate risk and protect participant safety:  
● Conservative criteria for interruption and/or discontinuation of study treatment.  
● The Dose Escalation and Safety Committee (DESC) will convene once a dose level 
cohort completes the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period and the data are 
available for review. The committee’s decision on the dose level for the n ext cohort will 
be guided according to the Bayesian optimal interval ( BOIN) Design based on DLTs 
observed in the DLT observation period. While safety data from the DLT observation 
period in the escalation cohorts are the minimum safety data needed for the committee 
meeting, all available safety findings, including those occurring after the designated 
DLT observation period that meet DLT criteria (“delayed DLT”), will be considered by 
[CONTACT_942].  
● The safety in the expansion cohorts will be monitored using  Bayesian logistic model and 
based on all DLT data obtained up to that time from both escalation cohorts and 
expansion cohorts and drug -related treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs) leading 
to death. Safety monitoring with these models will be started when an expansion cohort 
is opened. Enrollment in expansion cohorts may be held based on the  criteria described 
in Section 9.5. 
The potential risk of  irAEs and infusion -related reactions (IRRs) may be mitigated by [CONTACT_331038]’ symptoms, signs and clinical laboratory test results to facilitate early 
identification and management, as per the guidelines in Section 10.8 Appendix 8: Infusion 
Reaction Dose Modification and Treatment (Guidelines for ASP7517 and Pembrolizumab) ;

In the repeated dose toxicity studies with mice, all major findings were reversible and 
monitorable; therefore, ASP7517 may provide benefit of effective and safe treatment in solid 
tumors with limited treatment option upon progression.  
Pembrolizumab is a hu manized monoclonal antibody that targets programmed cell 
death protein 1 (PD-1) receptors on T lymphocytes targeting the negative regulators of the 
immune response rather than the tumor itself; thus, these agents are not specific to any type 
of malignancy therefore it has shown antitumor activity in various tumor types. 
Pembrolizumab has been approved to treat metastatic melanoma, non -small cell lung cancer 
and any unresectable or metastatic solid tumor with microsatellite instability and DNA 
mismatch repair deficiency. Pembrolizumab may improve the effect of ASP7517 since the 
inhibition of the binding of PD -[ADDRESS_409287] the risk.   
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_330979], checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) have side effects that are unique 
compared to traditional chemotherapy. The immune related side effects associated wit h CPIs 
can manifest in a number of organ systems, including gastrointestinal, endocrine, hepatic, and 
skin. With combination therapy of different CPIs, the toxicities are expected to overlap.  
Overall, the risk associated with participation in this clinical  study of ASP7517 as single

4 STUDY DESIGN AND DOS E RATIONALE  
4.1 Overall Study Design  
This study is a phase 1/2, open -label study of ASP7517 as monotherapy and in combination 
with pembrolizumab in selected participants  with advanced solid tumors known to expre ss 
WT1 antigen.  
This study consists of arms receiving ASP7517 monotherapy and arms receiving ASP7517 
and pembrolizumab combination therapy in phase 1 (dose escalation cohort) and phase 2 
(dose expansion cohort).  Japan sites will participate only in the phase 2 monotherapy arm.  
Additional cohort may be added by a protocol amendment to further evaluate ASP7517 as a 
single agent and/or in combination with another anti -cancer agent.   
4.1.1 Study Periods  
For participants  in all arms/phases, the study consists of the following periods:  
● Screening: (up to 28 days)  
● Treatment (up to six 28 -day cycles):  
o ASP7517 Monotherapy Arm: ASP7517 every 28 days  
o ASP7517 and Pembrolizumab Combination Therapy Arm: ASP7517 every 
28 days and pembrolizumab every 6 weeks in combination (up t o 6 doses of 
ASP7517 in combination with up to 4 doses of pembrolizumab);  
● End of Treatment (EOT) Visit: Participants will complete an EOT visit within 
7 days of EOT determination or prior to initiation of new anticancer therapy

period after EOT, except those with iCPD, iUPD (per independent central 
review or local review) and who are not clinically stable or clinical progression 
is confirmed by [CONTACT_093]. The observation period consists of safety 
follow-up visits (30, [ADDRESS_409289] dose administered in the treatment 
period) and visits for only tumor imaging (every 8 weeks for up to 48 weeks).  
o Observation Period for Combination Therapy: Participants will enter an 
observation period [ADDRESS_409290] dose of pembr olizumab in combination 
with ASP7517 (up to 96 weeks and may receive pembrolizumab monotherapy 
up to a total of 17  doses every 6 weeks for qualifying participants).    
● Survival Follow -up: Telephone contact [CONTACT_331040] [ADDRESS_409291] 2 cycles, 
participants who hav e not met any individual treatment discontinuation criteria  and are 
receiving clinical benefit (defined as radiological response or stable disease [SD], or

Participants who achieve confirmed complete response (CR) within the first 4 cycles will not 
receive further treatment with ASP7517, and participants who achieve partial response (PR) 
or SD after [ADDRESS_409292].  
The starting dose level is 1 × 107 cells/dose and the decision to escalate to the next dose level 
(1 × 108 cells/dose) will be made based on the assessment of safety variables, including the 
occurrence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs). Dose level may be de -escalated to a lower dose 
level (1 × 106 cells/dose) based on the occurrence of DLTs.  
After the EOT visit, participants will complete [ADDRESS_409293] dose of ASP7517 or prior to the initiation of new anticancer therapy.  
All participants will enter an observation period except those with confirme d disease

Version 7.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 6 4.1.5 Phase 1 Dose Escalation  
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Requirement for Monotherapy and Combination Therapy Dose 
Escalation  
After dosing with ASP7517, participants  must be observed for safety for a minimum of 
[ADDRESS_409304] of hourly AE 
observations. If new AEs are observed that are ≥  grade 3 during this time, participants should 
continue to be observed at t he investigator’s discretion.  The participant should be followed 
on an outpatient basis on planned visits during the DLT assessment period to closely monitor 
any AEs. 
The following vital sign assessment schedules apply:  
• At C1D1 and any visit when pembroliz umab and ASP7517 are administered together, 
vital signs are obtained predose ( -1 h from start of pembrolizumab infusion), within 
15 min prior to start of the pembrolizumab infusion, 15 min ( -5 to +10 min window) after 
the start of the pembrolizumab infusio n, at the end of the pembrolizumab infusion 
(-5 to +10 min window), 30 min (± 10 min) after completion of the pembrolizumab 
infusion, within 15 min prior to the start of the ASP7517 infusion, every 15 min 
(-5 to +10 min window) during the ASP7517 infusion,  at the end of the ASP7517 
infusion ( -5 to +10 min window), and postdose (+30 min, +1, +2, +3 and +4 h [± 10 min 
window each] from end of the ASP7517 infusion).  
• ASP7517 dosing only: Vital signs will be obtained within 15 min prior to start of the 
ASP7517 i nfusion, every 15 min ( -5 to +10 min window) during the ASP7517 infusion, 
every 15 min ( -5 to +10 min window) during the ASP7517 infusion, at the end of the 
ASP7517 infusion ( -5 to + 10 min window), as well as 30 min (± 5 min), 1 h (± 10 min) 
and 2 h (± 10  min) after completion of the ASP7517 infusion. If participants are still 
available, additional optional vital sign assessments 3 h (± 10 min) and 4 h (± 10 min) 
after completion of the ASP7517 infusion will be obtained.  
• Pembrolizumab dosing only: Vital si gns will be obtained within 15 min prior to start of 
the pembrolizumab infusion, 15 min ( -5 to +10 min window) after the start of the 
pembrolizumab infusion ( -5 to + 10 min window), at the end of the pembrolizumab 
infusion ( -5 to + 10 min window) and at 30  min (± 10 min) after completion of the 
pembrolizumab infusion for participants in the combination therapy.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Phase 1 Dose Escalation Cohort for Monotherapy and Combination Therapy 
Arms 
The monotherapy and combination therapy dose escalation portion will evaluate escalating 
dose levels of ASP7517 in approximately 9  to 12 DLT-evaluable participants.  
Dose escalation will be guided according to the BOIN design [ Liu & Yuan, 2015]  to 
determine the next dose level based on DLT occurrence. After the planned number of 
evaluable participants has completed the DLT observation period for a given dose level, 
safety for that dose level will be assessed. Each dose level in the dose escalation will enro ll 
Sponsor: APGD  ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_409305] be enrolled at the 
dose level used to determine the maximum t olerated dose (MTD) and the recommended 
phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ASP7517.  
Study enrollment and study treatment will be temporarily interrupted during dose escalation 
of monotherapy or combination therapy arms pending review of the following:  
● Any death that i s not related to disease progression occurring within 30 days of 
receiving IP  
● Occurrence of 2 grade ≥ 4 DLTs in 2 study participants  
● Any grade 4 hypersensitivity reaction/anaphylaxis  
Participant Replacement during Dose Escalation Cohort  
Participants may be  replaced in the dose escalation cohort if:  
● Participant is discovered to have enrolled without fully satisfying eligibility criteria  
● Participant received less than the planned dose in Cycle 1 for reasons other than 
DLT 
● Participant has no DLT and withdraws from the study before the end of DLT 
evaluation period  
The decision regarding replacement of individual participants will be made by [CONTACT_331042].  
Participants  who experience DLTs in the dose escalation cohort  will not be replaced.  
Refer to [ Section [IP_ADDRESS] Dose Escalation and Safety Committee ] for details about the 
DESC. 
Maximum Tolerated Dose  
The MTD det ermination will be based on at least 6 evaluable participants at that dose level 
based on the BOIN design. Based on the observed DLT(s) during the DLT observation 
period, the MTD is the highest dose for which the isotonic estimate of the DLT rate is closes t 
to, but not over, the target DLT rate of 0.[ADDRESS_409306] 6 participants. 
Determination of MTD will be done for monotherapy and combination therapy separate ly. 
Recommended Phase 2 Dose  
The sponsor, in conjunction with the DESC, will determine the RP2D of ASP7517 as a single 
agent and in combination with pembrolizumab taking into consideration the safety and 
efficacy data, as well as other available data, such  as pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of ASP7517. The RP2D will not exceed the MTD.

Determination of RP2D will be done for monotherapy and combination therapy separa tely. 
4.1.6 Phase 2 Dose Expansion Cohort  
[IP_ADDRESS] Monotherapy Arm Dose Expansion Cohort  
Monotherapy dose expansion will be opened after the phase 1 monotherapy arm dose 
escalation cohort has been completed  and RP2D is established . If a confirmed response (PR 
based on iRECIST [iPR] or a CR based on iRECIST [iCR], per independent central review) 
is observed  in a monotherapy arm dose escalation cohort, a tumor -specific dose expansion 
cohort may be opened in that tumor type after the phase 1 dose escalation has been 
completed. Once RP2D is determined; the melanoma expansion cohort may be opened ( even 
if no response is observed in the dose escalation cohort). Participants with CPI [INVESTIGATOR_330981] m onotherapy dose escalation or expansion 
cohorts to allow for enrollment of this patient population in the combination arm dose 
expansion cohort. If antitumor activity was observed in dose escalation or melanoma dose 
expansion stage 1, expansion cohorts for  CRC and ovarian cancer may be opened.  
Objective response rate per iRECIST (iORR), as confirmed per independent central review, 
is monitored using the Bayesian optimal phase 2 (BOP2) design [ Zhou et al, 2017] . The 
number of dose levels investigated during  phase 2 will be based upon the data from phase  1. 
Initially, 18  participants will be enrolled in a tumor -specific expansion cohort at each 
designated dose level (stage 1). If the iORR does not meet the optimal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_74239] 
(see table below), then a n additional 25  participants will be enrolled for a total maximum 
sample size of 43 for that tumor type at each dose level (stage 2). Otherwise, the enrollment 
at that dose level will be closed. When the total number of participants reaches the maximum 
sample size of 43, it may be predicted that ASP7517 is efficacious if the number of responses 
is greater than or equal to 8.  
Optimized Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_330982] ≤  
[ADDRESS_409308] newly opened dose levels, w ith the allocation 
ratio based on the number of open slots still available at each dose level. For example, if dose 
level ‘x’ enrolled 3  participants and dose level ‘y’ is newly opened for expansion, the next 
participant would be randomly allocated to dose  level ‘x’ or ‘y’ with the ratio of 15:18.  
In case the enrollment for both the monotherapy arm escalation cohort and combination arm 
escalation cohort therapi[INVESTIGATOR_330967], participants will be randomized to either 
monotherapy or combination cohort in  1:1 ratio. 
When escalation and expansion cohorts are both open for enrollment, enrollment into 
escalation cohorts takes priority such that participants who are eligible for both will be

[IP_ADDRESS] Combination Therapy Arm Dose Expansion Cohort  
The combination therapy arm dose expansion cohort will be opened after the phase 1 dose 
escalation cohort has been com pleted and MTD/RP2D of ASP7517 combination therapy  has 
been determined . The metastatic melanoma CPI [INVESTIGATOR_28947]ïve cohort will be open ed first. If

participants may be opened for combination arm therapy , if not yet opened . 
For metastatic melanoma CPI [INVESTIGATOR_28947]ïve participants, initially 20 participants will be enrolled in 
an expansion cohort at each  designated dose level (stage 1). If the iORR per independent 
central review does not meet the optimal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_74239] (see table below) for metastatic 
melanoma CPI [INVESTIGATOR_28947]ïve participants, then an additional 49 participants will be enrolled for a 
total max imum sample size of 69 at each dose level. When the total number of participants 
reaches the maximum sample size of 69, it may be predicted that the combination therapy 
with ASP7517 and pembrolizumab arm is effective if the number of responses is greater t han 
or equal to 24.

Version 7.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 6 by [CONTACT_317203] (NIH3T3) -WT1. This suggests additive activity of ASP7517 with CPIs like 
pembrolizumab, which are known to restore immune system tumor surveillance, while 
ASP7517 functions by [CONTACT_331043]. Therefore, combination therapy may 
lead to higher rates of response in cancer patients compared to monotherapy. However , the 
combination may also increase the frequency or severity of toxicities, and thus, a dose 
escalation study is the appropriate setting to explore this combination.  
In this study, each participant will receive ASP7517 as monotherapy or in combination wi th 
pembrolizumab every 28 days.  
The design will closely monitor safety while efficiently assessing efficacy of ASP7517 dose 
levels of 1 × 107 cells/dose and 1 × 108 cells/dose as monotherapy and in combination with 
pembrolizumab fixed dose of 400 mg every  6 weeks.  
Tumor-specific expansion cohorts may be triggered by a confirmed response to ASP7517 or 
to the combination with pembrolizumab, or following the determination of RP2D. The types 
of cancer selected for the expansion cohorts were based on expressio n of WT1 in the tumor. 
Expansion will be initiated in melanoma (CPI [INVESTIGATOR_28947]ïve in the combination arm and CPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_330991]). A gated design in the expansion phase is being 
implemented to allow expansion into CRC and ovarian cancer. This gat ed design will allow 
early evaluation of response, avoiding a large number of participants being exposed to 
ineffective treatment. If antitumor activity is observed in dose escalation or melanoma dose 
expansion Stage 1, expansion cohorts for CRC and ovaria n cancer may be opened.  
In the expansion phase of the combination arm, participants with metastatic melanoma are 
excluded if they received prior treatment with CPI. This will establish the efficacy of the 
combination of ASP7517 with pembrolizumab in CPI [INVESTIGATOR_28947] ïve participants. Also , there is no 
eligibility selection criteria for PD1 expression since it is not required per the pembrolizumab 
package insert for the tumor selected for the expansion phase.  
In addition, participants with HIV will be excluded since th e compromised immune system 
may affect the immune response of ASP7517.  
Objective response rate (ORR) is selected as a suitable efficacy primary endpoint in such an 
early phase study because it can generally be assessed early and with a smaller sample size  
compared with survival studies. In addition, it provides an informative presentation of effect 
on tumor attributable to treatment since it is based on objective and quantitative assessment.  
Based on the above, this study is designed appropriately to asse ss safety and efficacy of 
ASP7517 as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab in the selected 
participants.

Version 7.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 6 in the study. The dose of 5 × 102 cells/mouse is calculated as 1.7  × 104 cells/kg (5 × 102 
cells/30 g); therefore , the starting dose is estimated to be 1  × 106 cells/dose (1.7 × 104 cells/kg 
× 60 kg) for the first -in-human 7517 -CL-0101 study, since the toxicology profile observed in 
the nonclinical studies was considered to be acceptable to initiate a clinical study at this dose 
level. In study 7517 -CL-0101, 1 × 106 cells/dose  and 1 × 107 cells/dose  were completed with 
no DLT and determined to be safe by [CONTACT_331044].  To date, 7 participants completed the DLT 
observation phase in the  1 × 108 cells/dose  cohort without experiencing any DLTs, and 
DESC determined this dose level to be tolerable. Currently, additional participants are being 
enrolled in the 1 × 108 cells/dose  cohort to confirm safety and tolerability. T he starting dose 
of ASP7517 for study 75 17-CL-1101 is selected to be 1  × 107 cells/dose  for both 
monotherapy and combination therapy arms to balance protection of participant safety with 
efficient dose escalation . 
The dosing regimen of ASP7517 for this study will be treatments on Day 1 of each 2 8-day 
cycle, which is supported by [CONTACT_331045]. In mice 
immunized with specific antigen expressing aAVC at Day 0 and Day 28, NKT cells and 
T cells were stimulated after each administration, and recovery of toxicities were c onfirmed 
upon 28-day interval. Multiple administrations up to 6 doses are selected due to the 
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment requiring repeated immune system reactivation 
to achieve response.  
4.3.2 Pembrolizumab  
The planned dose of pembrolizumab for t his study is 400 mg every 6 weeks. Recently, the 
manufacturer of pembrolizumab ([COMPANY_006]) has gained regulatory approval for a more 
convenient dosage in adult s across all indications and regardless of tumor: 400 mg every 6 
weeks based on additional pharmacoki netic simulations [ KEYTRUDA prescribing  
information, June 2020] . This schedule has demonstrated to provide equivalent exposure to 
the approved dosage of 200 mg every 3  weeks [Lala et al, 2018; Goldstein et al, 2017]   
The pharmacokinetic simulations study d emonstrated that a dosage of 400 mg every 6 weeks 
provides adequate trough target engagement even for participants  whose weights are higher 
than average, with occupancy of 97% for participants  weighing 100 kg and 96% for those 
weighing 150 kg [ Canadian Age ncy for Drugs and Technologies in Health, CADTH  
technology review, 2019 ].

7 STUDY PROCEDURES AND  ASSESSMENTS  
● Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the schedules of asses sments 
[Table 1 through Table 4]. Adherence to the study design requirements, including those 
specified in the schedule of assessments, is essential and required for study conduct. 
Prospective protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed.  
● Any change, divergence or departure from the study design or procedures identified in 
the protocol is considered a protocol deviation. All deviations from the protocol are to be 
recorded.  
● Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue 
study treatment.  
● All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criter ia. The investigator will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.  
● Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical manageme nt (e.g., 
imaging, blood count) and obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilized for 
screening or baseline purposes provided the procedures met the protocol -specified 
criteria and were performed within the time frame defined in the schedule of 
assessments. 
7.[ADDRESS_409329] criteria as assessed by [CONTACT_331052].  
Tumor assessments will be performed at screening and at eve ry 8 weeks (± 1 week) from 
C1D1 until confirmed disease progression by [CONTACT_19393] (iCPD). Scans will be read on site 
and also submitted in digital format for independent central review. Procedures for 
independent imaging central review will be described in a separate imaging charter. The 
assessment will include tumor measurements for target lesions, non -target lesions, and 
assessment for any new lesions. An overall assessment will be characterized for time point 
evaluation.  
Computed tomography (CT) or magneti c resonance imaging (MRI) scans are preferred for 
this study and to ensure comparability, the same technique (CT/MRI) used at screening 
should be utilized throughout the study. The same method should be employed and assessed 
by [CONTACT_331053], when possible. Imaging should include chest, 
abdomen and pelvis as well as any other anatomical region appropriate for the participant’s 
disease.

7.3 Adverse Events and Other Safety Aspects  
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in [ Sections 10.3.1 and 10.3.2], respectively.  
AEs will be reported by [CONTACT_2299] (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate or the 
participant's legally authorized representative).  
The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting and 
recording events that meet  the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for 
following up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study IP or procedures, or that 
caused the participant to discontinue the IP or procedures and/or study [see  Section 10.3

Version 7.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 6 Appendix 3: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, 
Follow-up and Reporting ].  
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing c ausality of AE and SAE and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in [ Section 10.3 
Appendix 3: Adverse Events: Def initions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, 
Follow-up and Reporting ]. 
7.3.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse Event and Serious Adverse 
Event Information  
All SAEs will be collected from the signing of the ICF until the follow -up visit at th e time 
points specified in the schedule of assessments [ Table 1 through Table 4] and reported on the  
eCRF. 
All AEs will be collected from the signing of the ICF until the follow -up visit at the time 
points specified in the schedule of assessments [ Table 1 through Table 4] and reported on the 
eCRF.  
If the NCI CTCAE grade/grade of an SAE/AE ch anges, the event should be relisted on the 
eCRF with the new NCI CTCAE grade/grade and new onset date.  
If the NCI CTCAE grade/grade  decreases, the SAE/AE should be relisted on the eCRF with 
the new NCI CTCAE grade/grade and new onset date. The exception is  ongoing predose 
events that continue post -dose and improve post -dose. Such events should not be re -listed. 
If the NCI CTCAE grade/grade of an SAE reduces, the details of the AE should be provided 
on the SAE worksheet for the medical assessor to be able to  assess the course of the event.  
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee immediately and under no 
circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in [ Section 10.3 Appendix 3: Adverse 
Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up and Reporting ]. 
The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being 
available. 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE or SAE after conclusion of the study 
participation. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time 
after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she c onsiders the event to be 
reasonably related to the study IP or study participation, the investigator must promptly 
notify the sponsor.   
7.3.2 Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AE s and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE 
occurrences.  
7.3.3 Follow-up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to  proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs (and AEs of special interest [as defined in 
Sponsor: APGD  ISN/Protocol 7517 -CL-1101 
CONFIDENTIAL - Clinical Study Protocol

Version 7.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 6 Section 7.3.6]) will be foll owed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise 
explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in [ Section 8.3]). Further  
information on follow -up procedures is provided in [ Section 10.3 Appendix 3: Adverse 
Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating,  Follow-up and Reporting ]. 
If after the protocol -defined AE collection period (see [ Section 7.3.1 Time Period for 
Collecting Adverse Event and Seri ous Adverse Event Information] ), an AE progresse s to an 
SAE, or the investigator learns of any (S)AE (SAE or AE) including death, where he/she 
considers there is reasonable possibility it is related to the IP or study participation, the 
investigator must p romptly notify the sponsor.  
7.3.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events  
● Prompt notification by [CONTACT_11012] a SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of 
a study IP under clinical investigation are met.  
● The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and 
other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study IP under clinical investigation. The 
sponsor w ill comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safety 
reporting to the regulatory authority, IRB/IEC and investigators.  
● Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and 
forwarded to investigators as necessary.  
● An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other 
specific safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will 
review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the 
IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
7.3.5 Disease-related Events and/or Disease -related Outcomes Not Qualifying as 
Adverse Events or Serious Adve rse Events   
Under this protocol, the following event(s) will not be considered as an  (S)AE: 
● Disease p rogression: events including defined study endpoints that are clearly consistent 
with the expected pattern of progression of the underlying disease are not  to be recorded 
as (S)AEs. These data will be captured as efficacy assessment data as outlined in 
[Section 7.1 Efficacy Assessments] . If there is an y uncertainty as to whether an event is 
due to anticipated disease progression and/or if there is evidence suggesting a causal 
relationship between the IP and the event, it should be reported as an (S)AE. All deaths 
up to [ADDRESS_409339] be reported as an SAE, even if 
attributed to disease progression . 
● Pre-planned and elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinical procedures/interventions or procedures for 
diagnostic, therapeutic, or surgical procedures for a pre -existing condition that did no t 
worsen during the course of the study. For example, admission for treatment of a pre -
existing condition not associated with the development of a new AE or with a worsening 
of the preexisting condition such as transfusion for preexisting anemia, leukopeni a or

Version 7.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 6 thrombocytopenia will not be reported as an SAE. These procedures are collected per the 
eCRF’s completion guidelines.  
7.3.[ADDRESS_409340]. Participants should be evaluated carefully for 
potential IRRs as described in [ Section [IP_ADDRESS] Infusion-related Reactions] . In the event a 
participant is diagnosed with an IRR, then it should be reported as an AE using the diagnosis 
rather than the list of symptoms. Additional information on the AE of IRR will be collected 
on the AE eCRF.  
If the IRR is also classified as serious, they are to be collected via the SAE/Special Situation 
worksheet and reported within 24 hours as described in [ Section 10.3.6 Reporting of Serious 
Adverse Events] . 
7.3.[ADDRESS_409341] administration 
(e.g., wrong dose of IP or background therapy) are reported as protocol deviations and/or 
may require special reporting, as described below. These special situations are not considered 
AEs, but do require to be communicated to Astellas as per the timelines defined below.  
If a special situation is associated with, or results in, an AE, the AE is  to be assessed 
separately from the special situation and captured as an AE on the eCRF. If  the AE meets the 
definition of an SAE, the SAE is to be reported as described in [ Section 10.3.6 Reporting 
Procedures for Serious Adverse Events]  and the details of the associated special situation are 
to be included in the clinical description on the special situation worksheet or pregnancy 
reporting form.   
The special situations are:  
● Pregnancy  
● Lactation  
● Medication error, overdose and use outside protocol  
● Misuse/abuse  
● Occupational exposure  
● (Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884]) Transmission of infectious agent  
● Suspected drug -drug interaction  
Instructions and procedures for reporting s pecial situations are provided in [ Section 10.3.7

7.5 Pharmacodynamics  
Samples for exploratory pharmacodynamics and biomarker analyses of APS7517 will be 
collected according to the schedules of assessments [ Table 1 and Table 3].  
The samples described in [Sections 7.5.1 Blood Samples, 7.5.2 Tumor Tissue Samples and 
7.5.3 Buccal Swab Samples]  may be analyzed for other biomarkers including DNA, RNA 
and protein, to investigate possible associations with mechanisms of resistance or sensitivity 
to study treatment, dynamic changes associated with study treatment (in te rms of dose, 
safety, tolerability and efficacy, etc.) and method development or validation of diagnostic 
assays related to ASP7517.  
The samples may be stored at the study sponsor’s facility or a contract laboratory facility for 
up to [ADDRESS_409342] 
as described  in [Section [IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Exploratory Biomarker(s) ]. Examples of these 
biomarkers include, but are not limited to, anti -WT1 antibodies, cytoki ne expression and 
secretion (e.g., IFN γ), WT1-specific T lymphocytes (e.g., cytotoxic T  lymphocytes), immune 
cell populations (e.g., NKT cells, NK cells, etc.), expression levels of WT1 and mutations in 
genes that may modify treatment effect.  
7.5.2 Tumor Tissue  Samples 
The tumor tissue will be used for biomarker analyses as described in [ Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
Analysis of Exploratory Biomarkers(s)] . Examples of biomarkers include, but are not limited 
to, expression of WT1, expression and mutation of genes that may modify treatment effect, 
tumor mutational burden, changes in the tumor microenvironment  and change s in immune 
related molecules. Examples include, but are not limited to, CD4 T -cells, CD8 T -cells, etc.  
Archival tumor tissue sample : All participants are required to submit (if available) an 
archival tumor tissue sample in the form of a formalin -fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) 
block or unstained slides will be collected. If unstained slides are submitted, a minimum of

Details on sample collection, labeling, and shipment procedures will be provided in a 
separate laboratory manual.   
7.5.3 Buccal Swab Samples  
Buccal swab samples will be used to genotype the huma n leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene 
complex. Knowledge of the specific HLA gene complex in each participant may help 
understand/explain observed differences in efficacy or treatment effect. The buccal swab will 
be used for biomarker analyses as described in [ Section [IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Exploratory 
Biomarker(s)] .  
7.6 Pharmacogenomics  
Pharmacogenomic (PGx) research may be conducted in the future to analyze or de termine 
genes of relevance to clinical response, pharmacokinetics, toxicity/safety, efficacy and/or 
disease. A 4 to 6 mL sample of whole blood for possible banked PGx analysis will be 
collected as indicated in the schedules of assessments [ Table 1 and Table 2] Samples will be 
shipped to a sponsor -designated sample banking contract research organization (CRO).  
Details on sample collection, labeling, storage and shipment procedures will be provided in a

Refer to [ Section 10.1.9 Study and Site Start and Closure ] regarding discontinuation of study 
sites or of the study as a whole.  
8.1 Discontinuation of Individual Participant(s)  from Study Treatment  
A discontinuation from treatment is defined as a participant who enrolled in the study and for 
whom study treatment is permanently discontinued for any reason.  
The participant  is free to withdraw from the study treatment and/or study for any reason and 
at any time without giving reason for doing so and without penalty or prejudice. The 
investigator is also free to discontinue the participant from study treatment or to terminate a 
participant ’s involvement in the study at any time if the participant ’s clinical condition 
warrants it.  
The reason for discontinuation from study treatment must be documented in the participant’s 
medical records.  
A participant must discontinue study treatment for any of the following reasons:  
● Participant requ ests to stop treatment.  
● Any clinical AE, laboratory abnormality or intercurrent illness, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], indicates continued treatment is not in the best interest of the participant.  
● Participant is found to have significantly deviated from any one of the inclusion or 
exclusion criteria after enrollment (participants having clinical benefit and no DLT may 
be kept in the study after discussion with the medical monitor).  
● Participant not achieving response (CR or PR) and the participant is no longer deriving 
clinical benefit, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871].

8.2 Discontinuation of Individual Participant(s) from Study  
All participants who discontinue study treatment will remain in the study and must continue 
to be followed for protocol -specific follow -up procedures as outlined in the schedules of 
assessments [ Table 3 to Table 6]. The only exception to this is when the participant 
specifically withdraws consent for any further contact [CONTACT_35859]/her or persons previously 
authorized by [CONTACT_104140].  
All participants who discont inue study treatment are to be followed for up to [ADDRESS_409345] per the schedules of 
assessments [ Table 3 to Table 4].

9 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
9.1 Statistical Hypotheses  
The hypotheses for th e primary efficacy endpoint for each indication and dose level are given 
as follows:  
Monotherapy Dose Expansion : 
H0:  iORR is 10%, at which the treatment is deemed as unacceptable.  
H1:  iORR is at least 25%, at which the treatment is deemed as acceptable.  
Combination Therapy Dose Expansion : 
Metastatic Melanoma CPI [INVESTIGATOR_227358]ïve  
H0:  iORR is 25%, at which the treatment is deemed as unacceptable.  
H1:  iORR is at least 40%, at which the treatment is deemed as acceptable.

Version 7.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 6 Metastatic Melanoma CPI [CONTACT_179051]  
H0:  iORR is 13%, at which the treatment is deemed as unacceptable.  
H1:  iORR is at least 28%, at which the treatment is deemed as acceptable.  
Ovarian  
H0:  iORR is 15%, at which the treatment is deemed as unacceptable.  
H1:  iORR is at least 30%, at which  the treatment is deemed as acceptable.  
Colorectal Cancer  
H0:  iORR is 18%, at which the treatment is deemed as unacceptable.  
H1:  iORR is at least 33%, at which the treatment is deemed as acceptable.  
9.2 Sample Size Determination  
Phase 1 Dose Escalation : 
The sample size of approximately 24, including 12 from monotherapy and 12 from 
combination therapy, is not based on a statistical power calculation. The number of 
participants enrolled will be dependent on the DLT incidence. The estimated number of 
participan ts should provide adequate information for the dose escalation and safety objectives 
of the study.  
Phase 2 Dose Expansion : 
It is estimated that up to approximately 361 participants may be enrolled in the monotherapy 
and combination therapy arms (approximat ely 129 participants for monotherapy and 
232 participants for combination therapy). The iORR is monitored using the BOP2 design.  
Monotherapy  
For each indication, with assumptions mentioned in the statistical hypotheses sec tion, the 
statistical power would  be approximately 0.80 while controlling the type I error rate at 
0.05 (1-sided).  
Combination Therapy  
For each indication, with assumptions mentioned in the statistical hypotheses sec tion, the 
statistical power would be approximately 0.80 while controllin g the type I error rate at 
0.05 (1-sided).

noncompartmental analysis. For pharmacokinetic parameter, t max, only n, median, minimu m 
and maximum will be calculated.  
Descriptive statistics of pembrolizumab pharmacokinetics may be tabulated.  
9.4.5 Analysis of Pharmacodynamics Activities  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for pharmacodynamics parameters whenever 
applicable. Exploratory an alysis of the relationship between pharmacodynamic measurements 
and pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety profile in participants may be performed.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Exploratory Biomarker(s)  
Associations between biomarkers and clinical results (efficacy, safety or pharmacodynamics) 
may be performed on participants who have the necessary baseline and on -study 
measurements to provide interpretable results for specific parameters of interest. Biomarkers 
may be summarized graphically or descriptively as they relate t o clinical measures, as 
applicable. Summary statistics may be tabulated. Additional post -hoc analyses, such as 
alternative modeling approaches, may be conducted. All analyses described in this section are 
based on availability of the data.  
9.5 Interim Analysi s 
Safety, pharmacokinetic and other clinical data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis to 
determine if the study will proceed on to the next dose level/phase.  
For phase 2, according to the BOP2 design, the futility analysis for efficacy will be 
performed a t the end of stage 1. If the response rate does not meet the optimal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_317150], then stage 2 will be opened.  
The safety in phase 2 will be monitored using Bayesian logistic model based on all DLT data 
obtained at the time of the analysis for both  escalation and expansion cohorts and 
drug-related TEAEs leading to death. Safety monitoring with these models will start when 
phase 2 is opened. Enrollment in phase 2 may be held based on the following 2  criteria: 
1. If the posterior mean of the safety event  rate is higher than 30% as indicated by [CONTACT_331067] a given dose level for monotherapy or

level and at higher dose levels for that  therapy.  
2. Additionally, if the posterior mean of the safety event rate is higher than 30% as 
indicated by [CONTACT_317207] a specific tumor type at a dose level for 
monotherapy or combination therapy, enrollment of that dose level and any higher  
dose-level may be held for that tumor type and that therapy.   
9.6 Additional Conventions  
If the start and stop dates of AEs and concomitant medications are incomplete, imputed dates 
will be used to determine whether an AE is/is not treatment emergent or to allocate a 
concomitant medication to the study period it was taken.  
See the SAP for det ails of the definition for analysis windows to be used for analyses by 
[CONTACT_765]/time point.  
As a general principle, no imputation of missing data will be done. Exceptions are the start 
and stop dates of AEs and concomitant medications if they are missing on d ay of first IP 
administration. The imputed dates will be used to assess if the AEs or concomitant 
medications are treatment emergent or concomitant, respectively. Listings of the AEs and 
concomitant medications will present the actual partial dates; impute d dates will not be

10.1.11 Insurance of Participants and Others ( UNIQUE to Japan ) 
If a participant suffers any study -related injury, the sponsor will compensate the participant 
appropriately according to the severity  and duration of the damage. However, if the injury 
was caused intentionally or was due to gross negligence by [CONTACT_3452], the sponsor will 
consult with the study site about handling the injury, based on the agreed study contract. 
Compensation for the study-related injury is provided by [CONTACT_83236]:  
1. If a participant incurs an injury as a result of participation in the study, the study site 
should provide medical treatment and other necessary measures. The sponsor should be 
notified of the i njury.  
Sponsor: APGD  ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_409359].  
4. The sponsor shall make an arrangement for insurance and take measures necessary to 
ensure the compensation or indemnification mentioned above.  
10.1.12 Quality Assurance  
The sponsor is implementing and maintaining quality assurance (QA) and quality control 
(QC) systems with written SOPs to ensure that studies are conducted and data are generated, 
documented , recorded, and reported in compliance with the protocol, GCP and applicable 
regulatory requirement(s). Where applicable, the QA and QC systems and written SOPs of 
the CRO will be applied.  
The sponsor or sponsor’s designee may arrange to audit the study at  any or all study sites and 
facilities. The audit may include on -site review of regulatory documents, eCRFs and source 
documents. Direct access to these documents will be required by [CONTACT_77811].  
To support quality around participant safety and reliabilit y of study results, quality tolerance 
limits (QTLs) are defined and monitored. QTLs represent the acceptable variation of study 
data, taking into consideration the current state of medical and statistical knowledge about the 
variables to be analyzed, as we ll as the statistical design of the study. It is a level, point, or 
value associated with a parameter that should trigger an evaluation if a deviation is detected 
to determine if there is a possible systematic issue (i.e., a trend has occurred). The QTLs 
defined for this study are provided below.

WOCBP who are eligible for participation in the study, including those who choose complete 
abstinence, must have pregnancy tests as specified in the schedule of assessments. Pregnan cy 
test results must confirm that the participant is not pregnant.  
WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING POTENTIAL DEFINITIONS AND METHODS OF 
CONTRACEPTION DEFINITIONS  
A female is considered fertile (i.e., WOCBP) following menarche and until becoming 
postmenopausal unless  permanently sterile.  
Females in the following categories are not considered WOCBP  
● Premenarchal  
● Premenopausal with 1 of the following (i.e., permanently sterile):  
o Documented hysterectomy  
o Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
o Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
● Postmenopausal  
A postmenopausal state is defined as at least [ADDRESS_409360] menstrual bleeding cannot be clearly determined, confirmation with more 
than one follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) measurement of at least > 40 IU/L (or higher 
per local institutional guidelines) is required.  
Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt 
will be required to use one of the nonestrogen hormonal hig hly effective contraception 
methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must 
discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status by [CONTACT_331073].  
Documentation of any of these  categories can come from the study site personnel’s review of 
the female participant’s medical records, medical examination or medical history interview.  
CONTRACEPTION GUIDANCE FOR FEMALE PARTICIPANTS OF

● Vasectomized partner  
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the 
partner is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been 
confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used.  
● Sexual abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining 
from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of ri sk associated with the test 
product. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the 
duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. It is not 
necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is elected.  
a Local laws and regulations may require use of alternative and/or additional contraception methods.  
b Typi[INVESTIGATOR_35818]. Use should be 
consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants participating 
in clinical studies.

Version 7.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 6 10.3 Appendix 3: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for 
Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up and Reporting  
10.3.1 Definition of Adverse Events  
AE Definition:  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical study partic ipant, 
temporally associated with the use of study IP, whether or not considered related to the study 
IP. 
“Adverse event” means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the 
use of study IP. This includes events related to the comparator and events related to the 
(study) procedures.  
Events Meeting the AE Definition  
● Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments (e.g., ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the 
medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (i.e., not related to progression of 
underlying disease).  
● Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including eit her an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
● New conditions detected or diagnosed after study IP administration even though it may 
have been present before the start of the study.  
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition  
● Any clinically signi ficant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_11009]’s condition.  
● The disease/disorder being studied  or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s 
condition.  
● Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads 
to the procedure i s the AE. 
● Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
● Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study tha t do not worsen.

Version 7.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 6 [IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory Findings  
Any abnormal laboratory test result (e.g., hematology, biochemistry  or urinalysis) or other 
safety assessment (e.g., vital signs , physical examination , ECGs or radiographic scans) , 
including those that worsen from baseline, that is considered to be clinically significant in the 
medical and scientific judgment of the investigator and not related to underlying disease, is to 
be reported as an (S)AE.  
Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal safety assessment , 
which is associated with the underlying disease , does not require reporting as an (S)AE, 
unless judged by [CONTACT_19448] ’s 
condition.  
Repeating an abnormal laboratory test or  other safety assessment, in the absence of any of the 
above criteria, does not constitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an 
error does not require reporting as an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Potential Cases of Drug -induced Liver Injury  
Refer to [Section 10.4 Appendix 4: Liver Safety Monitoring and Assessment]  for detailed 
instructions on drug induced liver injury . Abnormal values in AST and/or ALT  concurrent or 
with abnorm al elevations in TBL  that meet the criteria outlined in [Section 10.4 Appendix 4: 
Liver Safety Monitoring and Assessment] , in the absence of other causes of liver injury, are 
considered potential cases of drug -induced liver injury (potential Hy’s Law cases) and are 
always to be considered important medical events and reported per [ Section 10.3.6 Reporting 
Procedures for  Serious Adverse Events] . 
10.3.[ADDRESS_409361] medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
● Results in death  
● Is life-threatening  
The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, 
which hypothetically might have caused death, if it wer e more severe.  
● Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
o In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19949] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1083]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s 
office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. 
If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], t he 
event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was 
necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen 
from baseline is not considered an AE.

CONFIDENTIAL - Clinical Study Protocol  
10 Feb 2022 Astellas Page 101 of 155 
Version 7.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 6 ● Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
o The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
o This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle), which may interfere with or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
● Is a congenital anomaly/ birth defect  
● Other situations:  
o Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that 
may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi [INVESTIGATOR_330997]. These events should usually 
be considered serious.  
o Examples of such events include invasive o r malignant cancers, intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse.  
If an event is not an AE per definit ion in [Section 10.3.1 Definition of Adverse Events] , then 
it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_208509]/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to progression of disease).   
10.3.3 Assessment of Causality  
● The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study IP and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.  
● A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship con veys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out.  
● The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
● Alternative causes, such as underlying diseas e(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study IP administration will 
be considered and investigated.  
● The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.  
● For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
● There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the  investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the sponsor. However, it is very important 
that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the 
initial transmission of the SAE data to the sponsor .

CONFIDENTIAL - Clinical Study Protocol  
10 Feb 2022 Astellas Page 102 of 155 
Version 7.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 6 ● The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up 
information and send a SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment.  
● The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements.  
Following a review of the relevant data, the causal relationship between the IP and each 
(S)AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_49419] “yes” or “no” to the question “Do you consider that 
there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been ca used by [CONTACT_33249]?”  
When making an assessment of causality, the following factors are to be considered when 
deciding if there is evidence and/or arguments to suggest there is a “reasonable possibility” 
that an (S)AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_33249] (rather than  a relationship cannot be ruled out) 
or if there is evidence to reasonably deny a causal relationship:  
● Has the participant been administered IP?  
● Plausibility (i.e., could the event been caused by [CONTACT_331074]? Consider biologic and/or 
pharmacologic mech anism, half -life, literature evidence, drug class, preclinical and study 
data, etc.)  
● Dechallenge/dose reduction/rechallenge:  
o Dechallenge: Did the (S)AE resolve or improve after only stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_330998]?  
o Dose reducti on: Did the (S)AE resolve or improve after reducing the dose of the 
suspect drug?  
o Rechallenge: Did the (S)AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after 
having been stopped?  
● Laboratory or other test results: a specific lab investigation supports the assessment of 
the relationship between the (S)AE and the IP (e.g., based on values pre -, during and 
post-treatment)  
● Available alternative explanations independent of IP exposure; such as other 
concomitant drugs, past medical history, concurrent or unde rlying disease, risk factors 
including medical and family history, season, location, etc., and strength of the 
alternative explanation  
● Temporal relationship between exposure to the IP and (S)AE onset and/or resolution. 
Did the (S)AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of the 
IP?  
● Finally, judging which are more likely based on all the above contents, factors of 
reasonable possibility or confounding factors, comprehensive judgment of plausible will 
be provided.  
There may be si tuations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the sponsor. While it is very important that the 
investigator always assesses causality for every event before the initial transmission o f the 
SAE data to the sponsor, the initial report should be submitted without delay (i.e., within 
24 hours of awareness). With limited or insufficient information about the event to make an 
informed medical judgment and in absence of any indication or evid ence to establish a causal

CONFIDENTIAL - Clinical Study Protocol  
10 Feb 2022 Astellas Page 103 of 155 
Version 7.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 6 relationship, a causality assessment of “no” is to be considered. In such instance, the 
investigator is expected to obtain additional information regarding the event as soon as 
possible and to re -evaluate the causality upon recei pt of additional information. The 
medically qualified investigator may revise his/her assessment of causality in light of new 
information regarding the SAE and shall send an SAE follow -up report and update the eCRF 
with the new information and updated caus ality assessment.  
10.3.4 Assessment of Severity  
AEs, including abnormal clinical laboratory values, will be graded using the National Cancer 
Institute-common terminology criteria for adverse event (NCI -CTCAE) guidelines, 
version 5.0. The items that are not stip ulated in the NCI -CTCAE, version 5.0 will be assessed 
according to the criteria below and entered into the eCRF :

10.3.5 Recording and Follow -up of AEs and/or SAEs  
AE and SAE Recording  
● When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) 
related to the event.  
● The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the e CRF. 
● It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s medical 
records to the sponsor in lieu of completion of the eCRF. 
● There may be inst ances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_260050]. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the 
participant number, will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_330999]. 
● The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.

10.3.7 Reporting Procedures for Special Situations  
[IP_ADDRESS] Contraceptive Guidance and Collection of Pregnancy Information  
If a female participant becomes pregnant during the study dosing period or within 180 days 
from the discontinuation of dosing, the investigator is to report the information to the sponsor 
according to the timelines in [Section 10.3.6 Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse  
Events] using the SAE worksheet or pregnancy form as a special situation and i n the eCRF .  
The investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any female partner of a 
male participant who becomes pregnant during the study dosing period or within 180 days 
from the discontinuation of dosing and report the information to the sponsor  according to the 
timelines in [Section 10.3.6 Reporting Proce dures for Serious Adverse Event s] using the 
special situation worksheet or pregnancy form.  
The expected date of delivery or expected date of the end of the pregnancy, last menstruation, 
estimated conception date, pregnancy result and neonatal data, etc., should be included in this 
information.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
termination (including elective termination) of a pregnancy is to be reported for a female 
participant as an AE in the eCRF or SAE per [ Section 10.3.6 Reporting Procedures for 
Serious Adverse Events] . Participant pregnancy outcomes listed below are to be reported as 
SAEs: 
● Spontaneous abortion /miscarriage, abortion and missed abortion  
● Death of a newborn or infant within 1 month after birth is to be reported as an SAE 
regardless of its relationship with the IP.  
● If an infant dies more than 1 month after the birth, it is to be  reported if a relationship 
between the death and intrauterine exposure to the IP is judged as “possible ” by [CONTACT_1275].  
● Congenital anomaly (including anomaly in miscarried fetus)  
● Benign hydatidiform mole  
● Blighted ovum  
Unless a congenital anomaly is identified prior to spontaneous abortion or miscarriage, the 
embryo or fetus should be assessed for congenital defects by [CONTACT_224832]. (S)AEs experienced by [CONTACT_224833]/infant should be reported via the 
pregnancy report ing form. Generally, follow up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following 
the estimated delivery date.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Medication Error, Overdose and “Off -label Use”  
If a medication error (defined as an unintended failure in the treatment process that leads to, 
or has the potential to lead to, harm to the participant), overdose or “off -label use” (i.e., use 
outside of the target disease defined in the protocol) is suspected, refer to [ Section 6.7

meets the definition of an SAE, the SAE is also to be reported as described in [ Section 10.3.6 
Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events]  together with the details of the medication 
error, overdose and/or “off -label use.”  
[IP_ADDRESS] Misuse/Abuse  
Definition of misuse: Situations where the IP is/are intentionally and inappropriately used not 
in accordance with the intended use as defined in the protocol.  
Definition of abuse: Persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of medicinal products 
which is accompanied by [CONTACT_331078].  
If misuse or abuse of the IP is suspected, the investigator must forward the special situation 
worksheet to the sponsor by [CONTACT_77787] (within 24  hours of awareness). Any 
associated (S)AEs are to be reported in the eCRF. I f the AE meets the definition of an SAE, 
the SAE is also to be reported as described in [ Section 10.3.6 Reporting Procedures for 
Serious Adverse Ev ents] together with details of the misuse or abuse of the IP.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Occupational Exposure  
If occupational exposure (e.g., inadvertent exposure to the IP of study site personnel while 
preparing it for administration to the participant) to the IP occurs, the investigator must 
forward the special situation worksheet to the sponsor  by [CONTACT_77787] (within 
24 hours of awareness). Any associated (S)AEs occurring to the individual associated with or 
resulting from the special situation are to be reported on the special situations worksheet.  
[IP_ADDRESS] (Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884]) Transmission of Infectious Agent  
If transmission of an infectious agent associated with the IP is suspected, the investigator 
must forward the special situation worksheet to the sponsor by [CONTACT_331079] 
(within 24 hours of awareness) and any associated (S)AEs are to be reported in the eCRF. I f 
the AE meets the definition of an SAE, the SAE is also to be reported as described in 
[Section 10.3.6 Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events]  together with the details of 
the suspected transmission of infectious agent.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Suspected Drug -drug Interaction

the special situation worksheet to the sponsor by [CONTACT_77787] (within 24 hours 
of awareness). Any associated (S)AEs are to be reported in the eCRF. I f the AE meets the 
definition of an SAE, the SAE is also to be reported as described in [ Section 10.3.6 Reporting 
Procedures for Serious Adverse Ev ents] together with details of the suspected drug -drug 
interaction.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Procedures for Product Defect  
When investigator -confirmed death or SAE caused by a defect of a regenerative medicine 
product occurs, or when the investigator judges there is a ri sk that the product defect caused a 
SAE, the (suspected) product defect is to be reported to sponsor.  
Sponsor: APGD  ISN/Protocol [ADDRESS_409365] worksheet containing all 
information that is required by [CONTACT_123356]/or regional regulations to t he sponsor by [CONTACT_106368] (within 24 hours of awareness). The product defect worksheet is to be 
reported as described in [ Section 10.3.6 Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events] . 
10.3.[ADDRESS_409366] of the Study  
When new information becomes available that is necessary for conducting the study properly, 
the sponsor will inform all investigators involved  in the study as well as the appropriate 
regulatory authorities. Investigators should inform the IRB/IEC of such information when 
needed.  
The investigator will also inform the participants, who will be required to sign an updated 
ICF in order to continue in the study.  
UNIQUE to Japan Region:  
1. When information is obtained regarding serious and unexpected adverse drug reactions 
(or other) that are specified in Article [ADDRESS_409367] on Securing Quality, Efficacy and 
Safety of Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices,  Regenerative and Cellular Therapy 
Products, Gene Therapy Products, and Cosmetics , in compliance with Article 80 -2 
Paragraph 6 of the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law, the sponsor should inform all 
investigators involved in the study, head of the study site and appropriate regulatory 
authorities of such information. The head of the study site who receives such information 
will decide whether the study should be continued after hearing the opi[INVESTIGATOR_317157]. 
The investigator will supply the new information to th e participants, in compliance with 
[Section [IP_ADDRESS] Supply of New and Important Information Influencing the Participant’s 
Consent and Revision of t he Written Information] . 
2. In addition, when the head of the study site receives the revisions of the Investigator’s 
Brochure, protocol, written information, information on the matters covering the quality 
of the test product, efficacy and safety, informatio n necessary for conducting the study 
properly or documents to be examined by [CONTACT_1201], these documents should be sent to the 
IRB. 
3. When the sponsor receives a safety issue from any source either Japan or worldwide that 
requires an urgent safety measure (USM)  to be implemented, then the sponsor will report 
that safety information to all study sites in Japan and the rest of the world (within 24 
hours of awareness).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Collection of Defect Information in Stage of Manufacture, Delivery and Storage  
Provision of information from QA to Pharmacovigilance (PV):  
● If QA determines that there is a significant quality issue in the defect information 
collected after shipment of the investigational products, QA will send it to PV. When it 
is judged as a significant quality issue, the impact on the participant is also evaluated by

Version 7.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 6 10.4 Appendix 4: Liver Safety Monitoring and Assessment  
The purpose of this appendix is to provide g uidance for the monitoring of drug -induced liver 
injury during the course of the study. It should be noted that this section does not specify the 
end-of-study analyses of liver enzymes. The end -of-study liver enzymes analyses will be 
described in the SAP. Any participant enrolled in a study with active drug therapy and 
reveals an increase of serum aminotransferases (AT) to > 3 × ULN or bilirubin > 2 × ULN 
should undergo detailed testing for liver enzymes (including at least alkaline phosphatase 
[ALP], ALT, AST and TBL). Testing should be repeated within [ADDRESS_409370]   TBL 
Moderate  > 3 × ULN  or > 2 × ULN 
Severe > 3 × ULN and† > 2 × ULN 
ALT: alanine aminotransferase; AST: aspartate aminotransferase; TBL: total bilirubin; ULN: upper limit of 
normal 
†Samples taken simultaneously or within maximum [ADDRESS_409371] severe hepatic abnormalities for any 
of the following:  
● ALT or AST > 8 × ULN  
● ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks. 
● ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and † TBL > 2 × ULN or international normalized ratio (INR) 
> 1.5 (if INR testing is applicable/evaluated)  
● ALT or AST > 5 × ULN and† (TBL > 2 × ULN in participants with liver metastases)  
● ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance o f fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%)  
† Samples taken simultaneously or within a maximum of 24 hours.  
The investigator may determine that abnormal liver function results, other than as  described 
above, may qualify as moderate or severe abnormalities and require additional monitoring 
and follow -up.  
Follow-up Procedures  
Confirmed moderate and severe abnormalities in hepatic functions should be thoroughly 
characterized by [CONTACT_331081], detailed pertinent history, 
physical examination and clinical laboratory tests. The study site personnel are to complete

Version 7.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 6 the liver abnormality case report form (LA -CRF). Participants with confirmed abnormal liver 
function testin g should be followed as described below.  
Confirmed moderately abnormal liver function tests should be repeated 2 to 3 times weekly, 
and then weekly or less if abnormalities stabilize or the IP has been discontinued and the 
participant is asymptomatic.  
Severe hepatic liver function abnormalities as defined above, in the absence of another 
etiology, may be considered an important medical event and may be reported as a SAE. The 
sponsor should be contact[CONTACT_331082].  
To further assess abnormal hepatic laboratory findings, the investigator is expected to:  
● Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases. Symptoms 
and new-onset diseases are to be recorded as “AEs” within the eCRF. Illnesses and 
conditions such as hypotensive events, and decompensated cardiac disease that may lead 
to secondary liver abnormalities should be noted. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is seen in 
obese hyperlipoproteinemic and/or diabetic participants, and may be associated with 
fluctuating AT levels. The investigator should ensure that the medical history form 
captures any illness that predates study enrollment that may be relevant in assessing 
hepatic function.  
● Obtain a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medication, 
complementary and alternative medications), alcohol use, recreational drug use and 
special diets. Medications are to be entered in the  eCRF. Information on alco hol, other 
substance use and diet should be entered on the LA -CRF or an appropriate document.  
● Obtain a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents.  
● Based on the participant’s history, other testing may be appropriate including:  
o Acute viral hepati tis (A, B, C, D, E or other infectious agents)  
o Ultrasound or other imaging to assess biliary tract disease  
o Other clinical laboratory tests, including INR and direct bilirubin  
● Consider gastroenterology or hepatology consultations.  
● Submit results for any add itional testing and possible etiology on the LA -CRF or an 
appropriate document.  
Study Treatment Discontinuation  
In the absence of an explanation for increased liver function tests, such as viral hepatitis, 
preexisting or acute liver disease, or exposure to  other agents associated with liver injury, the 
participant may be discontinued from study treatment. The investigator may determine that it 
is not in the participant’s best interest to continue study treatment. Discontinuation of study 
treatment should be  considered if:  
● ALT or AST > 8 × ULN  
● ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks  
● ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and†  TBL > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5) (if INR testing is 
applicable/evaluated)

quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%)  
† Samples taken simultaneously or within a maximum of 24 hours.  
In addition, if close monitoring for a p articipant with moderate or severe hepatic laboratory 
tests is not possible, study treatment should be discontinued.  
Hy’s Law definition: Drug -induced jaundice caused by [CONTACT_77813], without a 
significant obstructive component, has a high rate of  bad outcomes, from 10% to 50% 
mortality (or transplant).  
The 2 “requirements” for Hy’s Law are:  
1. Evidence that a drug can cause hepatocellular -type injury, generally shown by [CONTACT_331083] > 3  × ULN (“2 × ULN elevations are too common in t reated and 
untreated participants to be discriminating”).  
2. Cases of increased TBL (at least 2 × ULN) with concurrent AT elevations at least 3 × 
ULN and no evidence of intra - or extra-hepatic bilirubin obstruction (elevated ALP) or 
Gilbert’s syndrome [ Temple, 2006]. 
FDA Guidance for Industry titled, “Drug -induced Liver Injury: Premarketing Clinical 
Evaluation” issued by [CONTACT_317260] 2009:  
1. The drug causes hepatocellular injury, generally shown by a higher incidence of [ADDRESS_409372] than the (nonhepatotoxic) control drug 
or placebo.  
2. Among participants showing such AT elevations, often with ATs much greater than 
3 × ULN, one or more also show elevation of serum TBL to > 2 × ULN, without initial 
findings of cholestasi s (elevated serum ALP).  
3. No other reason can be found to explain the combination of increased AT and TBL, such 
as viral hepatitis A, B, or C; preexisting or acute liver disease; or another drug capable of 
causing the observed injury.

Version 7.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 6 10.7 Appendix 7: Pharmacogenomic Analysis With Banked Sample  
INTRODUCTION  
PGx research aims to provide information regarding how naturally occurring differences in a 
participant’s gene and/or expression of genes based on genetic variation may impact what 
treatment options are best suited for the participant. Through investigation of PGx by 
[CONTACT_317261][INVESTIGATOR_007], gene sequencing, sta tistical genetics and Genome -Wide 
Association studies, the relationship between gene profiles and a drug’s kinetics, efficacy, 
toxicity or disease may be better understood. As many diseases may be influenced by [CONTACT_331084], PGx research may identify which genes are involved in determining 
the way a participant may or may not respond to a drug.  
OBJECTIVES  
The PGx research that may be conducted in the future with acquired blood samples is 
exploratory. The objective of this research will be to analyze  or determine  genes of relevance 
to clinical response, pharmacokinetics and/or toxicity/safety and/or disease.  
By [CONTACT_317262], it may be possible to predict an individual participant’s 
response to treatment in terms of efficacy a nd/or toxicity and/or disease.  
PARTICIPANT PARTICIP ATION 
Participants who have consented to participate in this study will participate in the PGx 
substudy. Participants must provide written consent prior to providing any blood samples that 
may be used at a  later time for PGx analysis.  
SAMPLE COLLECTION AND STORAGE  
Participants who consent to participate in this substudy will provide approximately 4 mL 
sample of whole blood/buccal swab per Astellas’ instructions. Each sample will be identified 
by [CONTACT_331085].  Samples will be shipped to a designated banking CRO as 
directed by [CONTACT_77818].  
PGx ANALYSIS  
Details on the potential PGx analysis cannot be established yet. Astellas may initiate the PGx 
analysis if evidence suggests that genetic variants  may be influencing the drug’s 
pharmacokinetics, efficacy and/or safety and/or disease.  
DISPOSAL OF PGx SAMPLES/DATA  
All PGx samples collected will be stored for a period of up to 15 years following study 
database lock. If there is no requirement for anal ysis, the whole blood sample will be 
destroyed after the planned storage period. The participant has the right to withdraw consent 
at any time. When a participant’s withdraw notification is received, the PGx sample will be 
destroyed. The results of any PGx  analysis conducted on a sample prior to its withdrawal will 
be retained at Astellas indefinitely unless otherwise specified by [CONTACT_1295] .

Version 7.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 6 10.10 Appendix 10: Dose Modification and Toxicity Management for Immune -related AEs  
AEs associated with pembrolizumab exposure may represent an immune -related response. These irAEs may occur shortly after the first dose or se veral 
months after the last dose of pembrolizumab treatment and may affect more than one body system simultaneously. Therefore, ear ly recognition and 
initiation of treatment is critical to reduce complications. Based on existing clinical study data, most i rAEs were reversible and could be managed with 
interruptions of pembrolizumab, administration of corticosteroids and/or other supportive care. For suspected irAEs, ensure a dequate evaluation to 
confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Additional procedure s or tests such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, skin biopsy may be included as part of the 
evaluation. Dose modification and toxicity management guidelines for irAEs associated with pembrolizumab are provided in Table 17. 
Based on the mechanism of action of ASP7517, immune -related adverse reactions (e.g., fever, headache, fatigue, hot flashes, diarrhea and muscular and 
joint pain) should be considered (see [ Section [IP_ADDRESS] Other]) and managed as required per standard of care. In case of such events, ensure adequate 
evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. In addition, the study medical monitor should be c ontacted to discuss event monitoring, follow up 
and study treatment management.  
Table 17 Dose Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines for Immune -related Adverse Events Associated with Pembrolizumab  
General instructions:  
1. Severe and life -threatening  immune-related adverse events ( irAEs) should be treated with intravenous corticosteroids followed by [CONTACT_13215]. Other immunosuppressive 
treatment should begin if the irAEs are not controlled by [CONTACT_13216].  
2. Pembrolizumab must be permanently discontinued if the irAE does not resolve or the corticosteroid dose is not ≤10  mg/day within [ADDRESS_409374] pembrolizumab 
treatment.  
3. The corticosteroid taper should begin when the irAE is ≤ Grade [ADDRESS_409375] 4 weeks.  
4. If pembrolizumab has been withheld, pembrolizumab may resume after the irAE decreased to ≤  Grade 1 after corticosteroid taper.

Version 7.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 6 10.12 Appendix 1 2: Clinical Study Continuity  
INTRODUCTION  
The purpose of this appendix is to provide acceptable alternate methods to assess safety and 
efficacy parameters, as appropriate, in the event the clini cal study is interrupted at the 
country, state, site or participant level during any crisis (e.g.,  natural disaster, pandemic).   
BENEFIT -RISK RATIONALE  
Maintaining the safety of clinical study participants and delivering continuity of care in the 
clinical study setting is paramount during any crisis. The site is expected to follow the 
protocol and associated Schedule of Assessments  (Table 1 to Table 5) unless the site 
principal investigator ( PI) discusses the need with the Astellas medical monitor to implement 
the alternate measures.  
The approach outlined within this appendix defines w hich assessments are required to 
maintain a favorable benefit/risk to the participant, to maintain overall study integrity and to 
provide acceptable alternate methods to complete the study required assessments and 
procedures if study activities are unable to be performed as described in Section 4 due to a 
crisis. 
INFORMED CONSENT  
Participants who need to follow any or all of the alternate measures outlined in this Appe ndix 
will be required to provide informed consent , which explicitl y informs them of the nature of  
and rationale for these changes, and gain their agreement to continue participation in the 
study prior to the implementation of any of these changes. In the e vent the urgency of 
implementing the alternate measures does not allow for the participant to provide written 
consent prior to implementation, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_331007] i s feasible. A separate addendum to 
the study informed consent will be provided to document the participant’s consent of the 
changes. 
PARTICIPANT PROCEDUR ES ASSESSMENT  
Sites with participants who are currently enrolled into this clinical study may consider 
implementing the alternate methods outlined below if one or more of the following 
conditions are met due to the crisis:  
● Regional or local travel has been restricted, inclusive of mandatory shelter in place 
measures, which makes participant travel to/from t he study site nearly impossible  
● Site facilities have been cl osed for clinical study conduct.  
● Site has been restricted to treating participants  with conditions outside of the scope 
of the study .  
● Site personnel have temporarily relocated the conduct of the  study to a location that 
place a burden on the participant with respect to time and travel .  
● Participant(s) have temporarily relocated from the current study site to an alternate 
study site to avoid placing a burden on the participant with respect to trav el.

Version 7.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 6 ● Participant(s) have temporarily relocated from their home location and the new 
distances from the site would cause undue burden with respect to time and travel .  
● Participant has risk factors for which traveling to the site pose an additional risk to 
the participant’s health and safety .  
Adherence to the original protocol as reflected in the Schedule of Assessment s (Section  1.3) 
is expected, where plausible, in the case of a crisis. The alternate measures as noted in  
Table [ADDRESS_409377]  (IMP) and maintaining 
critical safety and efficacy assessments for participants  participating in the study at a time of 
crisis. 
If one or more of the alternate measures noted below is implemented for a participant, the site 
should document in the participant’s source  document the justification for implementing the 
alternate measure and the actual alternate measures that were implemented, along with the 
corresponding time point(s).

If any of the conditions outlined above in the Participants Procedures Assessment are met, the 
following mitigating strategies will be employed, as needed, to ensure continuity of IMP 
supply to the participants:   
● Increase stock of IMP on site to reduce number of shipments required, if site storage 
condition will allow, however each shipment will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_77818].  
DATA COLLECTION REQU IREMENTS  
Additional data may be collected in order to indicate how p articipation in the study may have 
been affected by a crisis and to accommodate data collection resulting from alternate 
measures implemented to manage the conduct of the study and participant safety.  
● Critical assessments for safety and efficacy based on study endpoints to be identified 
as missing or altered (performed virtually, at alternative locations, out of window, or 
other modifications) due to the crisis.

Version 7.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 6 Definition of Key Study Terms  
Terms Definition of Terms 
Baseline  Assessments of participants as they enter a study before they receive any 
treatment.  
Endpoint  Variable that pertains to the efficacy or safety evaluations of a study.  
Note: Not all endpoints are themselves assessments since certain endpoints 
might apply  to populations or emerge from analysis of results. That is, 
endpoints might be facts about assessments (e.g., prolongation of survival).  
Enroll To register or enter a participant into a study. Note: Once a participant has 
received the IP or placebo, the protocol applies to the participant.  
Investigational 
Product The drug, device, therapy or process under investigation in a study that is 
believed to have an effect on outcomes of interest in a study (e.g., health -
related quality of life, efficacy, safety and pharmacoeconomics).  
Investigational 
period Period of time where major interests of protocol objectives are observed, and 
where the test pro duct or comparative drug (sometimes without 
randomization) is given to a participant, and continues until the last 
assessment after completing administration of the test product or 
comparative drug.  
Randomization  The process of assigning participants to t reatment or control groups using an 
element of chance to determine assignments in order to reduce bias.  
NOTE: Unequal randomization is used to allocate participants into groups at 
a differential rate; for example, [ADDRESS_409409] or comparative d rug (sometimes without randomization) is given to 
a participant.  
Study period  Period of time from the first study site initiation date to the last study site 
completing the study.  
Variable Any quantity that varies; any attribute, phenomenon or event tha t can have 
different qualitative or quantitative values.

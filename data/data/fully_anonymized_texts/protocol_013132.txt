Study Title : Easing the Burden of Dementia Caregiving: A Telephone -delivered 
Mindfulness Intervention for Rural, Afr ican American Families  
Objectives  
SPECIFIC AIM 1 : To determine the feasibility and acceptability of a telephone -delivered 
mindfulness training intervention (TMT) in decreasing caregiver burden among rural, 
African American, informal caregiving teams of people with dementia.  
 
SPECIFIC AIM 2: To explore, o n a preliminary basis, the effects of the training on 
caregiver burden and relevant  secondary outcomes for both caregiving team members, 
including (1) emotion  regulation; (2) tolerance of uncertainty; (3) emotional and physical 
health; (4) family conflict within the informal caregiving team; and (5) self -efficacy.  
 
SPECIFIC AIM 3: To explore comfort with and willingness to adopt technologies (e.g.  
telephone -based, web -based) to access mindfulness practices and existing caregiving 
educational resources.  
Design and Outcomes   
The proposed study utilizes a single -group, uncontrolled design to assess the feasibility and 
acceptability of telephone -deliv ered mindfulness training designed to alleviate caregiver 
burden  for rural caregivers of African American individuals with moderate to severe 
dementia , A care partner —the person who provides the most support in additi on to the 
primary caregiver —is included in the intervention. The primary outcome is feasibility as 
assess ed by [CONTACT_1629] 85% retention rate with completion of at least [ADDRESS_959378] -participation interviews will assess acceptabilit y.   
 
At baseline, after obtaining informed consent, study staff will interview primary caregivers 
in their homes (or via a phone call post -COVID)  and will administer a set of questionnaires, 
including the 12 -item Zarit Burden Interview as well as measures  of:  
1) family satisfaction;  
2) tolerance of uncertainty ;  
3) cognitive emotion regulation ;  
4) general self-efficacy;  
5) anxiety and anger;  
6) self-efficacy in managing emotions ;  
7) global physical health ;  
8) family conflict;  
9) social support (emotional, instrumental, informat ional);  
Master Protocol  
Caregiver Grant (R21 AG061728 -01)  Page 9 of 55 version 5.0  
April 12, 2023  
 10) meaning and purpose;  
11) cognitive and affective mindfulness  
Study staff will interview the care partner in person or over the telephone.  After the 8 -week 
intervention, study staff will interview the caregiver  (in the home , or via telephone ), care 
partners (on the telephone) once more,  and administer the questionnaires.  
Interventions and Duration  
The intervention consists of mindfulness training delivered by [CONTACT_705995] 8 
weeks.  The intervention also includes one weekend part-day retreat.. The intervention, 
based on Kabat -Zinn’s mindfulness -based stress reduction (MBSR)  and adapted for this 
study population , emphasize s the following:  1) mindful experiencing, including 
mindfulness of body sensations, feelings , thoughts and emotions ; 2) mindful 
communication, including non -verbal mindfulness, mindful listening, and mindful speaking; 
and 3) mindful compassion for self and others.  
Sample Size and Population  
Planned study participants include [ADDRESS_959379] four hours of care per 
day.  Additional participants include an additional adult, the care partner, who the caregiver 
identifies as another person who helps with the care .  This person may be a blood relative or 
a non -blood relative.   Hence, 32 caregiver -care partner dyads comprise the study 
population.

1 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
1.1 Primary Objective  
SPECIFIC AIM 1: To determine the feasibility and acceptability of a telephone -delivered 
mindfulness training intervention (TMT) in decreasing caregiver burden among rural, informal 
caregiving teams caring for African Americans with dementia . 
 
Hypothesis 1:   TMT will be feasible within the informal caregiving teams. Feasibility is 
established when 85% (95% CI:  72.5, 97.5) of participants in the telephone -delivered 
mindfulness training intervention complete at least six sessions of the intervention.  
 
Hypoth esis 2:  The adapted TMT will be acceptable to informal caregiving teams as evidenced 
by [CONTACT_1629] 85% (95% CI:  72.5, 97.5) endorsement of the program in post -participation interviews.  
1.2 Secondary Objectives  
SPECIFIC AIM 2: To explore, on a preliminary basis, the effects of the training on caregiver 
burden and relevant secondary outcomes for both caregiving team members , including:  
 
Hypothesis 1:  Compared with baseline levels, we hypothesize that mindfulness training will 
reduce caregiver burden (Zarit Burden Inte rview).  
 
Hypothesis 2:  Compared with baseline levels, we hypothesize that mindfulness training will 
improve emotion regulation by [CONTACT_705996][INVESTIGATOR_175812] (acceptance, positive 
refocusing, po sitive reappraisal) and decreasing  negative copi[INVESTIGATOR_705969] (rumination, 
catastrophizing, self -blame) as measured by [CONTACT_705997].  
 
Hypothesis 3:  Compared with baseline levels, we hypothesize that mindfulness training will 
increase tolerance of uncertainty as measured by (an ad apted form of) the Intolerance of 
Uncertainty Scale.  
 
Hypothesis 4:  Compared with baseline levels, we hypothesize that training in mindful 
communication will increase perceived social support among the caregivers (PROMIS Social 
Support short forms).  
 
 Hypothesis 5:  Compared with baseline levels, we hypothesize that training in mindful 
communication reduce family conflict around caregiving (Family Conflict Scale).  
 
Hypothesis 6:  Compared with baseline levels, we hypothesize that mindfulness training will  
reduce anger and anxiety  (PROMIS scales) . 
 
Master Protocol  
Caregiver Grant (R21 AG061728 -01)  Page 13 of 55 version 5.0  
April 12, 2023  
 Hypothesis 7:  Compared with baseline levels, we hypothesize that mindfulness training increase 
global self -perceived physical health (PROMIS short forms).  
 
Hypothesis 8:  Compared with baseline levels, we hypoth esize that mindfulness training increase 
meaning and purpose (PROMIS short form).  
 
Hypothesis 9:  Compared with baseline levels, we hypothesize that mindfulness training along 
with a caregiver resources handbook will increase caregiver general and emotional self-efficacy  
(PROMIS scales) . 
 
Hypothesis 10: Compared with baseline levels, we hypothesize that mindfulness training will 
increase family satisfaction (Family Satisfaction Scale) . 
 
Hypothesis 11:  Compared with baseline levels, we hypothesize that mindfulness training will 
increase  mindfulness (Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale).  
 
SPECIFIC AIM 3: To explore comfort with and willingness to adopt technologies (e.g. 
telephone -based, web -based) to access mindfulness practices and existing caregiving educational 
resources.  
As pa rt of intervention planning, using interviews, we will investigate comfort with a 
smartphone/tablet. We will implement the tablets among  half of the intervention  groups  so that 
we can compar e acceptance  between groups with and without the technology.  
2 BACKG ROUND AND RATIONALE   
2.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus  
The number of individuals and families impacted by [CONTACT_7351]’s disease and related 
dementia (ADRD) is projected to triple by 2050 and many of those impacted will be African  
Americans (AAs).[ADDRESS_959380].1,3–[ADDRESS_959381] families, including AA families, provide dementia care in the home and when 
compared with other caregivers (CGs), dementia CGs experience higher levels of physical, 
financial, and emotional burden, including anxiety and stress as well as higher ra tes of family 
discord.16–19,9 One study reported over 50% of spousal CGs and over 80% of adult children CGs 
endorsed some level of family conflict.[ADDRESS_959382] called dementia ‘the great 
divider’, as caregiving stress tends to accentuate long -standing interpersonal issues between 
family members.[ADDRESS_959383] strongly associated with caregiving 
burden include ineffective communication and difficulties around roles (i.e. distribution of 
caregiving tasks).[ADDRESS_959384] around roles and provision of social support may be particularly 
distressing.14  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_77078], few CG interventions address family relationship 
difficulties.  
Master Protocol  
Caregiver Grant (R21 AG061728 -01)  Page 14 of 55 version 5.0  
April 12, 2023  
 We know that race and cultural experiences, ways of copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and ways of  seeking help often 
differ for AA compare with caregivers of other ethnicities .15–18 Evidence also suggests that, 
contrary to previous findings, AA caregivers, who are likely to be adult children, also experience 
high levels of anxiety and distress.19,20 Therefore, within -group studies of African Americans, 
and other racial minorities, are needed to provide characteristics and processes critical for 
tailored interventions.21   Hence, innovative theory -based programs , culturally and 
geographically tailored to rural AA population s, are needed to ease the burden of dementia -
related caregiving in rural AA populations.  
2.2 Study Rationale  
Pearlin et al.’s Stress Process Model  posits complex relationships between background 
characteristics (demographics), primary stressors (care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_705970]), secondary stressors/outcomes (interpersonal and 
intrapersonal st rain) and caregiver health outcomes (physical and mental health) all mediated by 
[CONTACT_304740][INVESTIGATOR_397844].[ADDRESS_959385] effects on 
negative caregiver (CG) outcomes.[ADDRESS_959386] en and 
negative CG mental and physical health outcomes,10,23 –[ADDRESS_959387] with one another, can 
either promote positive CG outcomes or contribute to CG distress in families caring for someone 
with dementia.26  In addition to these interpersonal strains, intrapersonal stressors such as role 
captivity and poor self -efficacy both result from and contribute to negative health outcomes.22
 
 
Figure 1: Stress process and uncertainty theories informing caregiver mindfulness training  
   
Mishel’s Reconceptualized Uncertainty in Illness Theory (RUIT),27,[ADDRESS_959388].30 Accordingly, in our proposed 
intervention, we hypothesize that mindfulness training could enhance the CG’s shift from a 
resistance to uncertainty to an acceptance of it as a natural part  of life. Similarly, mindfulness

 training can shift emotion regulation strategies from negative (e.g., self -blame) to  positive (e.g., 
planning). Additionally, the proposed focus on improving family conflict should affect perceived 
social support, another m ediator of health outcomes, thereby [CONTACT_705998] -efficacy and 
positive emotions.  
 
Mindfulness -based Stress Reduction for reducing burden in dementia caregivers.  
Mindfulness meditation has been described as “a behavioral technique involving the intentional 
self-regulation of attention to present -moment experience, combined with release of cognitive 
fixation on thoughts (whether simple images or complex storylines) regarding the past or 
future.”31,32 Through training in mindfulness, individuals learn to evoke and sustain a non -
judgmental state of present -moment awareness.31,33 Research has shown that mindfulness 
training programs such as  Mindfulness -based Stress Reduction (MBSR), which also incorporate 
exercises to generate compassion for oneself and others, result in reduced stress, improved 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and a host of improved physical and psychological health outcomes.34,[ADDRESS_959389] been adapted and successfully utilized for a wide range of conditions, 
populations, and cultures including in AAs and in CGs.36–[ADDRESS_959390] incorporated smart -phone or telephone -delivered mindfulness training 
formats.45–48 An additional advantage of distance -based formats for CGs is their flexibility in 
terms of the CG’s often restricted and demanding li festyle. For rural caregivers, a telephone -
delivered mindfulness program would seem to be particularly accessible, useable, and feasible, 
overcoming both distance and infrastructure barriers. Moreover, such a program would easily 
lend itself to facilitatin g communication between CG family members, including those who are 
geographically distant, thereby [CONTACT_705999]’s reach.   
 
 
Developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a Telephone -Delivered Mindfulness Training Intervention (TMT) for Care 
Teams.  In light of the above findings, and relying on [CONTACT_706052]’s extensive experience in 
adapting mindfulness -training programs and [CONTACT_69333]’ extensive experience work ing with 
African American caregivers, we plan to implement a telephone -delivered mindfulness training 
intervention that will incorporate:  
1) Training for primary caregivers (CG) and their caregiving partner (CP) in  an 8-week, 
telephone -based, mindfulness -based stress reduction ( MBSR ) program, which places 
additional emphasis on training in the following:  
a. mindful experiencing, including mindfulness of feelings and body sensations  as 
Master Protocol  
Caregiver Grant (R21 AG061728 -01)  Page 16 of 55 version 5.0  
April 12, 2023  
 well as thoughts and emotions ; 
b. mindful communication, including non -verbal mi ndfulness, mindful listening, and 
mindful speaking; and  
c. mindful compassion for self and others.   
 
2) Groups of up to eight participants (four CG -CP pairs) plus an instructor, on a shared 
telephone line; and  
 
Additionally, homework assignments  for CG  will involve listening to exercise recordings 
via a dial -in telephone line  or computer tablet  and assignme nts for CG -CP dyads (e.g. mindful 
listening and communication practices) as well as CG mindfulness practices in the presence of 
CRs (e.g. mindful e ating, and mindful listening). Based on theory and evidence from previous 
mindfulness studies, we believe tha t this intervention holds promise of making a significant 
impact on reducing burden in AA rural CGs.  
 
The study pi[INVESTIGATOR_48409] a telephone -delivered mindfulness -training intervention (TMT)  for 
caregiving teams (rather than in -person or web -based) aimed at reducing  caregiver burden.  Our 
rationale is that members of rural communities are less likely to have access to the internet, but 
have high likelihood of some form of telephone service, and are limited by [CONTACT_706000]. Currently, the intervention is planned 
for eight weekly, one -hour telephone sessions al ong with one 1.5-hour retreat. Adjustments to 
the format are possible, based on input from key informants and the Advisory Council.   
 
In pre-post studies, mindfulness training in pre -post studies has shown a moderate positive 
effect on clinical outcomes such as depression, anxiety, and physical conditions with a Hedge’s g 
of 0.57 (95% CI 0.5, 0.64).35 A meta -analysis of studies of mindfulness  training for caregivers 
showed consistently positive effects on psychological outcomes.38    
 
Adverse events are rarely reported in mindfulness training studies.  However, the training 
prompts participants to attend to emo tions, thoughts, and physical sensations, some of which 
may be unpleasant.  Hence, emotional discomfort or distress (EDD) may arise for some 
participants.  Usually, EDD resolves quickly with guidance from an experienced instructor and, 
as participants beco me more skilled in mindfulness, they recover from EDD more quickly. 
Mindfulness training has the potential to exacerbate dissociation in susceptible individuals —
therefore, it is important to exclude such individuals unless the program is monitored by [CONTACT_706001] .   
3 STUDY DESIGN  
The proposed study utilizes a single -group, uncontrolled design to assess the feasibility and 
acceptability of telephone -delivered mindfulness training designed to alleviate caregiver burden 
for rural car egivers of African American individuals with moderate to severe dementia . A care 
partner —the person who provides additional help —is included in the intervention. The primary 
outcome is feasibility  of the telephone -delivered mindfulness intervention  as ass essed by [CONTACT_1629] 85% 
retention rate with completion of at least [ADDRESS_959391] -
participation intervi ews will assess acceptability. A diagram of the intervention and assessment 
plan is provided in Figure 2.

SPECIFIC AIM 1: To determine the feasibility and acceptability of a telephone -delivered 
mindfulness training intervention (TMT) in decreasing caregiver burden among informal 
caregiving teams caring for African Americans with dementia . 
 The primary outcomes are feasibility and acceptability  among primary caregivers and also 
among care partners .   
 
SPECIFIC AIM 2: To explore, on a preliminary basis, the effects of the training on caregiver 
burden and relevant secondary outcomes for both caregiving team members .  Secondary 
outcomes include the following:  
1. Pre-post intervention differences in  caregiver burden (Zarit Burden I nterview);  
2. Pre-post intervention differences in copi[INVESTIGATOR_705971] s tyles 
(Cognitive E motion Regulation Questionnaire);  
3. Pre-post intervention differences in tolerance of uncertainty  (Intolerance of Uncertainty 
Scale);  
4. Pre-post int ervention differences in anger, anxiety , and global self -perceived health 
(PROMI S short forms);  
5. Pre-post intervention differences in family satisfaction (Family Satisfaction Scale), 
perceived social support among the caregivers (PROMIS Social Suppo rt short  forms) and 
family conflict around caregiving ( Family Conflict Scale);  
6. Pre-post intervention differences in caregiver self -efficacy;  
7. Pre-post intervention differences in mindfulness (CAMS -R scale) , hopefulness, and 
optimism (Meaning and Purpose Scale).  
 

Master Protocol  
Caregiver Grant (R21 AG061728 -01)  Page 18 of 55 version 5.0  
April 12, 2023  
 SPECIFIC AIM  3: To explore comfort with and willingness to adopt technologies (e.g. 
telephone -based, web -based) to access mindfulness practices and existing caregiving educational 
resources.  
1. In interviews  with both the primary caregivers and the care partne rs, we will investigate 
comfort and experience with internet devices, including smartphones, tablets, and 
computers . For half of the intervention groups, we will ask these questions in post -
participation interviews, including exploring how individuals are currently using or 
would like to use these technologies (e.g., voice activation, use of bookmarks).  
2. For half of the intervention groups, we will ask questions about technology before the 
intervention and will offer each family a tablet loaded with interven tion materials, 
including the contents of the participant binder.  Post-participation interviews will include 
questions about the ease of use and perceived value of the tablets.  
 
The study population will consist of 32 caregivers (CG) of African Americans care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] 
(CR)  with a cognitive or memory  problem severe enough to prevent them from caring for 
themselves without assistance.  Because African Americans with Alzheimer’s disease and related 
dementias (ADRD) are less likely to have a formal diagnosis and because a formal diagnosis 
would not impact the potential value of the intervention for the caregiver, the study  does not  
require a formal diagnosis.  Instead, the study will require a level of disability as perceived by 
[CONTACT_706002] a t least moderate (see Inclusion Criteria).  The study population also includes 
the 32 additional caregivers , care partners (CP)  identified by [CONTACT_706003].   No control group is planned.  
 
Additional p articipants in the study will include approximately  [ADDRESS_959392] of informal caregivers, former caregivers, members of 
the Council on Aging, members of African American sororities affiliated with the Alzheimer’s 
Association of Eastern North Carolina, or African American formal caregivers affiliated with 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_705972] . 
 
Primary caregivers will come from Lenoir County, Wayne County, and surrounding 
counties in rural Eastern North Carolina.  Caregiver assessments will take place in the home , or 
another location of the caregiver’s choice . (During and following the COVID  pand emic , this 
assessment will take place via telephone for all participants.)  Care partners are not restricted 
geographically.  Assessments of Care P artners will take place by [CONTACT_756] (or in a separate 
room in the home if they are present ).    
 
The research  team will work with the individuals and organizations including the 
Alzheimer’s Association of Eastern North Carolina (AAENC), the Study Physician , Research 
Fellows, and local pastors to develop a handbook of relevant caregiving resources for families 
(available both as a hard copy and , in half of the groups,  electronically)  as well as mindfulness 
exercises.  Included in the handbook will be information about additional training for addressing 
CR behavioral problems (e.g., WeCare Advisor), training not covered explicitly by [CONTACT_706004].

The total duration of p articipation includes : 1) a pre -participation assessment up to 6 w eeks 
prior to the intervention; 2) eight weeks of intervention calls plus retreat ; and 3) a post -
participation interview and assessment within four weeks of the last intervention call.  
Interventions will take place over the telephone for the [ADDRESS_959393] either at a community location 
convenient to the majority of the group participants , or online via Zoom,  during and after the 
COVID. .  Please see Table 1 and the intervention handbook for details of the intervention.

4 SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PARTICIPANTS   
4.1 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
Informal caregiving teams will be composed of a primary and secondary informal caregiver, as 
defined as:  
Master Protocol  
Caregiver Grant (R21 AG061728 -01)  Page [ADDRESS_959395] range of assistance for, an older person or an adult with a chronic or disabling 
condition [in this case, Alzheimer’s Disease or a related dementia].   These individuals may be 
primary or secondary caregivers and live with, or separately from, th e person receiving care. 
(Family Caregiver Alliance, www.caregiver.org)  
The primary caregiver (CG) are adults who must:  
• Care for a family member with dementia who identifies as Black or African American  
o Defined: Care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_496701] a diagnosis of dementia (reported  by [CONTACT_84452] ) 
or have a score of at 2 or higher on the AD -8 or a score of 8 or higher on the 
Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ).  
• Provide regular, daily care (at least 4 hours per day) for a family member who has 
dementia  
• Have another adult care partner (CP) who is  willing to  participate; someone who shares 
caregiving or helps make decisions regarding the person with dementia or Alzh eimer's 
disease (may be remote and family member or friend)  
• Have a telephone and be willing to participate in weekly calls  
• Live in rural areas in Eastern N orth Carolina . 
o Defined:  Eastern is defined as east of Wake County NC ; rural is defined as listed 
as rural within the website https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/am -i-rural  
The primary caregiver is excluded if they:  
• Are receiving active treatment for cancer  
• Have been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] [ADDRESS_959396] key 
informant in terviews. Key informants will include local pastors, members of African American 
sororities  affiliated with the AAENC, and members of the local Council on Aging.  Additionally, 
we will plan interviews with African American caregivers of people with dementi a 
 
Advisory Council.  We will also recruit an Advisory C ouncil of 5 -8 individuals. We will 
share the results of feasibility data and qualitative analyses with the Advisory Council and utilize 
their input in refining improving the intervention.   The Advisor y Council may also revie w the 
intervention manual and study logistics and provide recommendations.  
Master Protocol  
Caregiver Grant (R21 AG061728 -01)  Page 21 of 55 version 5.0  
April 12, 2023  
  
    Recruitment, screening and consent . We plan to recruit participants in conjunction with  
local service providers and community organizations in Eastern N C Counties, including  AAENC 
and local pastors.   These counties are chosen for their high AA populations (>30%) and existing 
relationships with UNC researchers.   Should recruitment from these counties be insufficient, we 
will extend the intervention to ne ighboring rural  Eastern NC  counties (e.g., Duplin, Sampson).  
 
 Recruitment partners (AAAENC, affiliated sororities, pastors, Council on Aging) will 
advertise the study to their membership.  We will have a study website where potentially 
interested people can indicate interest.  We will also provide study f lyers to the UNC Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_705974] -sponsored events in the 
counties.  Once COVID pandemic occurred, we also relied on Facebook ads,  radio/newspaper 
ads, NC Brain Registry and Duke family Caregiver Support e -news , and ‘snowballing’ (referrals 
from past participants).    Interested individuals may contact [CONTACT_706005].  Re cruitment partners may 
forward contact [CONTACT_30160] . 
 
After we identify individuals, we will provide details of the intervention and screen CGs 
over the telephone  and pre -screen individuals  with a telephone consent.  We will visit CGs who 
meet the eligibility criteria in their homes to obtain a formal written consent for participation and 
to administer the baseline measures.  (During COVID, these proce dures will be conducted 
completely over the phone, with verbal consent process  and phone assessments.  In addition , staff 
will obtain a verbal consent addendum to allow un encrypted texting and emailing for the main 
purpose of study activities reminders. ) At that time, we wi ll provide a binder with local and 
downloaded caregiver resource s as well as  mindfulness activity instructions.  Participants may 
also access audio files  with recorded mindfulness activities.  In the second half of the program, 
participants  will receive a tablet loaded with all of the contents of the binder as well as 
bookmarked links to ADRD information sites.  
 
The primary caregiver will be asked to invite a care partner to participate in the study and 
will obtain that person’s permission f or us to contact [CONTACT_476].  Once permission is confirmed with 
the caregiver, study staff will contact [CONTACT_706006], describe the study, and obtain 
verbal consent to proceed with assessments  (and unencrypted messaging)  as well as an invitation 
to participate in the intervention .  
5 STUDY INTERVENTIONS   
5.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration  
The study intervention is the mindfulness  training for caregivers and care partners.  The 
mindfulness training is offered in 8 weekly telephone sessions plus one weekend  retreat.  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_705975] .   
5.2 Handling of Study Interventions  
Each pa rticipant will receive a resources handbook ( binder ) containing the following:   
Master Protocol  
Caregiver Grant (R21 AG061728 -01)  Page 22 of 55 version 5.0  
April 12, 2023  
 • Descriptions of each class section and suggested homework exercises;  
• Detailed descriptions of mindfulness practices taught in the class;  
• Instructions for how to access recorde d mindfulness practices;  
• A list of community resources for individuals with ADRD and their caregivers, including 
contact [CONTACT_3031];  
• A list of national resources for individuals with ADRD and their caregivers;  
• Instructions for caregivers based on materia l published by [CONTACT_41314]  (Lathren, 
Kaufer) ; 
• Select downloaded materials from the Alzheimer’s Association of Eastern NC and other 
relevant websites.  
 
Half of the groups  will receive an electronic tablet loaded with the handbook, recordings, and 
links to resources bookmarked. We will program voice -enabled personal assistants on the tablet 
to enable access to bookmarked resources. We will investigate the best way to provid e internet 
service for each participating family for at least 4 months (e.g., cell, DSL, cable).  During the 
baseline (in -home) visit, we will teach CGs how to use the handbook.  CGs who receive the 
tablet will also learn how to use it in the baseline visi t. In follow -up interviews, we will ask to 
what extent CGs used the handbook, tablet (if relevant), and call -in lines. Given it is unclear if 
and how technologies will be used in this population, this aspect of the study will provide insight 
on which compo nents of the intervention will be most useful to include in future iterations.  
Because  half of the groups will receive the tablets, we will be able to examine the difference in 
adherence and engagement between groups with the tablets and without the table ts. 
 
For the intervention, each trained, experienced mindfulness instructor will work from an 
instructor’s manual prepared by [INVESTIGATOR_124].  Gaylord. The instructor’s manual, designed for experienced 
mindfulness instructors, will detail the intervention components, providing tips on teaching the 
material and responding to participant questions.  Consultant Mary Brantley, an expert in 
telephone -delivered mindfulness, will review and edit the i nstructor’s manual.  
5.3.1 Allowed Interventions  
Caregivers and care p artners are not restricted from participating in any care 
recommended by [CONTACT_161009]. We ask that they delay additional mindfulness -based 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_705976] . 
5.3.2 Required Interventions  
No interventions are required outside of the mindfulness training intervention  with the 
accompanying handbook (on paper alone or on paper plus a tablet) . 
5.3.3 Prohibited Interventions  
No interventions are prohibited, but we will ask participants to delay engaging in mindful 
yoga or mindfulness -based therapy until after the intervention, if possible.  
5.3 Adherence Assessment  
Adherence is assessed via a class participation log kept by t he instructor as well as a data -
Master Protocol  
Caregiver Grant (R21 AG061728 -01)  Page [ADDRESS_959397] manager and her staff.  The tracking website documents 
attendance at class sessions , instructions for participants outside of class sessions (if sessions are 
missed), and co mpletion of study  assessments.

details about the study. If they continue to be interested, they will provide a telephone 
consent for review of eligibility and collecti on of demographic information. If they 
are eligible and wish to participate in the intervention, study staff (research assistant 
and/or project manager) will make an appointment for a home visit for enrollment 
and baseline assessments  of the caregiver and/or care partner  (during/post -COVID, 
this changed to a phone appointment) . At that time, study procedures will  be 
reviewed again and the caregiver will provide written informed consent  (verbal 
consent and consent addendum for unencrypted messaging post -COVID).    
 
The caregiver will identify a care partner and, with their permission, provide contact 
[CONTACT_706010]. Because care partners may live in a distant geographic 
location, their consent may be obtained by [CONTACT_706011] . 
Screening and consenting can take place at the same time or in two different calls, at 
the discretion of the care partner.   
 
If cha nges are made in the study that  affect  the risk of the intervention before 
completion of their part of the study, study staff will contact [CONTACT_706012] n to 
review a revised consent. Participants who have completed the study will receive a 
letter explaining the increased risks.  
 
Physical, signed c onsent documents are stored in a consent binder, to be locked in a 
portable file cabinet.  Study staff will upload the consent documen ts into the study 
REDCap site. At intervals, study  staff will transport the consent forms and all paper 
assessments to the project manager to be locked in a file cabinet con trolled by [CONTACT_978] s. 
Once verbal consent processes are in place, verbal consent will be documented on 
consent forms by [CONTACT_706013], and stored using TEAMS.  
 
Screening   
Caregivers must be screened within 5 weeks of the baseline assessment .  It is 
anticipated that class sessions will begin within four weeks of baseline assessments 
for each caregiver and care partner.  
• At the time of the screening call, the caregiver will verify that they provide at 
least 4 hours of care per day to the care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] .  
• The caregiver will also verify that they have a family member or friend who 
assists with care and who is likely to be agreeable to participation in the 
telephone mindfulness sessions.   
Master Protocol  
Caregiver Grant (R21 AG061728 -01)  Page 25 of 55 version 5.0  
April 12, 2023  
 • At the time of the baseline visit, the eligibility criteri a will be reviewed and 
completed via an inclusion/exclusion checklist.   
• The caregiver will obtain permission for contact [CONTACT_706014].  
6.1.2.  Enrollment, Baseline, and/or Randomization  
Enrollment  
The first en rollment date is defined as the date that the primary caregiver reviews and 
signs the writ ten informed consent document. A primary caregiver may still choose to 
withdraw from the intervention prior to the first intervention session. The primary 
caregiver w ill become ineligible for the first intervention session if a care partner 
does not agree to participate. Hence, a second definition of enrollment, akin to the 
point of randomization, is the date of t he first intervention session. Each individual 
who participates in  the first class session will be considered to be a pa rticipant in the 
intervention. The date of enrollment (baseline assessment ) and attendance at the first 
class session are recorded in the secure study database, REDCap.   
 
Baseline Assessments  
At baseline, the caregiver will participate in a pre -participation int erview, lasting 10 -
15 minutes. The purpose of the interview is to assess, qualitatively, the caregiver’s 
knowledge about  mindfulness  or centering prayer, perceived value of t elephone -based 
group classes, and comfort with technology .

many sessions the caregiver attended.  With the research assistant, the caregiver will 
complete the following assessments:  
• Post-participati on interviews will address the caregiver’s attitudes and 
experiences with the program, including:  
o most memorable aspects of program;  
o perceived value and cultural congruence of the mindfulness training;

 o usefulness, challenges, and recommended changes;  
o perceived value for management of stress related to caregiving or family 
conflict;  
o tools that might help maintain practices;  
o unfulfilled expectations of the program;  
o usefulness of the technology components (e.g., call -in lines, tablets), if 
relevant.   
Study staff will complete a similar interview with the care partner over the telephone.  
With permission of the participants, each interview will be audio -recorded and 
transcribed.  
 
• Questionnaires to be completed with the caregiver and care partn er at the final 
visit include all previously administered outcome measures.  
 
If participants withdraw before the end of the intervention, study staff will ask them to 
complete the interview and questionnaires associated with the final visit, i f possible, 
either in person or over the telephone.  Study staff will also inquire about adverse 
events that may have led to discontinuation.  
 
[ADDRESS_959406]. Potential adverse experiences  for participants as a result of the telephone -delivered 
mindfulness intervention include:  
 
• Emotional or psychological discomfort or dis tress, including:  
o Avoidan ce 
o Agitation  
o Anxiety  
o Difficulty focusing  
o Irritability  
o Nervousness  
o Obsessive thoughts  
o Panic  
o Restlessness  
• Physical symptoms associated with emotional/psychologic al discomfort or distress:  
o Body or joint aches (resulting from intervention practices)  
o Headaches (resulting from intervention practices)  
o Heavy sweating (without performing strenuous activity)  
o Hyperventilation or rapid breathing (without performing strenuous activity)  
o Nausea or gastrointestinal problems (outside of sickness)  
o Rapid heart rate (without performing strenuous activity)  
 
Study staff will encourage participants that they do not have to answer any questions that make

Caregiver Grant (R21 AG061728 -01)  Page 29 of 55 version 5.0  
April 12, 2023  
 them feel uncomfortable on study questionnaires. During intervention sessions, participants will 
be encouraged to parti cipate, but can choose not to do an activity that makes them feel 
uncomfortable. Study staff and the intervention instructor will make participants aware of the 
experiences that can occur prior and during their time in the study. Study staff will encourage  
participants to report emotional distress/discomfort and physical symptoms during interven tion 
sessions and through follow -up call s with study staff , which will occur up to 3 times during the 
intervention . Adverse events will be captured using the Periodi c Telephone Administered  
Adverse Event Monitoring Form . 
7.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
Measures used to assess safety for participants include  periodic  telephone check -in with 
participants.  In the check -in, study staff query participants regarding both psychological and 
physical health.  Any event that does not clearly meet the criteria for a mild AE will be 
investigated by [CONTACT_706018] (medical officer).  The 
PIs with the Study Physician will determine the severity of the AE, relatedness to the s tudy, and 
recommended follow -up. Follow -up will include providing the participants with a list of 
resources and , in more acute cases, recommendations to see their primary ca re provider . 
7.2 Methods and Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety Parameters  
Timing for assessing, recording, and analyzing safety and adverse events will be completed 
in the following ways:  
 
• Assessing : instructors will prompt the study staff to follow -up with any participants 
that is endorsing emotional or physical difficulties during the telephone sessions to 
further assess for adverse experiences.  
 
Study staff will contact [CONTACT_554456] 3 times during the intervention to complete 
the Periodic Telephone Administered Adverse Event Monitoring Form  to assess for 
safety and adv erse events  (see Supplementary Materials).  
 
• Recording: study staff will document safety and adverse events in the  Adverse Event 
Reporting Form  (See Supplementary Materials).  
 
• Analyzing: all safety and adverse events will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978], or a designe e to 
assess the severity and level of follow -up needed for each participant. Moderate and 
severe level AEs will also be reviewed by [CONTACT_38234], as needed. All 
reported events will be reported to the Safety Monitoring Committee and IRB for 
review t wice a year and annually, respectively. SAEs will be reported to the Safety  
Monitoring Committee and IRB within 24 hours of the study staff receiving the 
report from a participant.  
7.3 Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Events  
The study team, led by [CONTACT_7676], will monitor all participants for 3 categories of events: 
adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and unanticipated problems 
(UPs). These three categories are defined as follows:  
Master Protocol  
Caregiver Grant (R21 AG061728 -01)  Page 30 of 55 version 5.0  
April 12, 2023  
 Adverse event (AE):  Any unfavorable and unintended change in physical or mental 
health status (i.e. new or worsening physical or mental health signs, symptoms, or 
disease) associated with participation in the study, regardless of whether it is 
considered related to the study . 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  Any AE that:  
 
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening, or places the participant at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred  
• Requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Causes persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in congenital anomalies or birth defects  
Unanticipated problems (UPs)  involving risks to subjects or others to include, in 
general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the 
IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the subject population being  studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” 
means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or 
outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_356512] i nvolved in the research); 
and 
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was 
previously known or  recognized.  
This study uses the following AE grading sca le: 
 
• Mild:  An experience that is transient and requires no special treatment or 
intervention. The experience does not generally interfere with usual 
daily activities. In this study, an example includes mild emotional 
distress that persists after a class session has  ended.  
 
• Moderate:  An experience that is alleviated with simple therapeutic treatments. 
The experience impacts usual daily activities. In this study, an example 
includes moderate emotional distress requiring  counseling.  
 
• Severe:  An experience that requires therapeutic intervention. The experience 
interrupts usual daily activities. In this study, an example includes depressive 
symptoms requiring pharmacological intervention or withdraw from the study. 
If any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ) is required for 
treatment, it becomes an  SAE.  
 
This study uses the following AE attribution scale:  
Master Protocol  
Caregiver Grant (R21 AG061728 -01)  Page 31 of 55 version 5.0  
April 12, 2023  
  
• Not related:  The AE is clearly not related to the study procedures (i.e., another cause of 
the event is most plausible and/or a clinically plausible temporal sequence is inconsistent 
with the onset of the  event).  
• Possibly related:  An event that follows a reasonable te mporal sequence from the initiation 
of study procedures, but that could readily have been produced by a number of other  
factors.  
• Related:  The AE is clearly related to the study procedures. This study uses the following 
AE expectedness  scale:  
o Unexpected : nature or severity of the event is not consistent with information 
about the intervention in the protocol or consent  form  
o Expected : event is known to be associated with the intervention under  study  
7.4 Reporting Procedures  
All reported events will be reported to the Safety Monitoring Committee and IRB for review 
twice a year (after the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth groups) and annually, respectively. SAEs 
will be reported to the Safety Monitoring Committee and IRB within  24 hours of the study staff 
receiving the report from a participant.  
 
7.5 Follow-up for Adverse Events  
Any event that does not clearly meet the criteria for a mild AE will be investigated by [CONTACT_706019] [INVESTIGATOR_9769] (medical o fficer).  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or Study 
Physician will determine the severity of the AE, relatedness to the study, and recommended 
follow -up. Follow -up will include providing the participants with a list of resources (also 
available in the study handbook provided at  enrollment).  Participants may be advised to see their 
primary care provider .  Study staff will check in with the participant weekly to ascertain 
resolution of the AE.  
7.[ADDRESS_959407] . Jessica Barnhill , as needed. If the AE is serious and/or 
unexpected, possibly related to study participation, and suggests increased risk for 
participants, the procedures outlined below will also be followed.  
 
AE reports will be collected by [CONTACT_673318], summarized and 
de-identified. A summary report of all AEs to date will be sent to the PIs at each 
monthly full -team meeting.  
Master Protocol  
Caregiver Grant (R21 AG061728 -01)  Page [ADDRESS_959408] manager or study staff will report all SAEs to the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_705978], after having gathered all necessary 
details. For all deaths  and for any SA E related or possibly related to study participation, the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_705979], including corrective actions already 
taken, within 24 hours  to the SMC chair, UNC IRB and NIA program officer. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_705980], NIA, and/or SMC.  
All other SAEs (not unanticipated or related) will be summarized and reported to the SMC and 
the NIA Program Officer  quarterly.   
Unexpected and Related AEs/UPs with increased risk.  All AEs t hat are deemed 1) 
unexpected; 2) possibly or probably related to study participation; and 3) suggests increased 
risk for study participants will be reported to the UNC IRB, NIA project officer, and the 
SMC chair within 48 hours of study team awareness of the event, using each organizations’ 
respective reporting formats. In these reports, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_705981]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_705982], NIA, and/or SMC.  
 
The SMC will meet in person (or virtually for long -distance members as needed) 
at least 4 times throughout the study to review the Data and Safety Monitoring 
Report: 1) prior to first enrollment; 2) after the first 2 cohorts (2 8 -week sessions ); 
3) after [ADDRESS_959409] completed (6 8 -week sessions); 4) at study completion (8 8 -
week sessions).  
Additional meetings (ad -hoc) will occur as requested by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_705983]. Any recommended changes by [CONTACT_706020].  
7.7  Emergency situations  
Given participation is completely virtual, for any  potential emergency situation that occurs 
while on the phone with participants, the study staff will ask the participant to call  911 or 
their physician as needed. Permission will be obtained at study outset (consent) to contact [CONTACT_706021]. The study physician and key staff will also be informed 
ASAP, and an AE form will be recorded. (Emergency numbers are listed  in TEAMS.)

 8 INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION   
8.1 Discontinuation of Intervention for a Participant  
Participants will be discontinued  if adverse events cause:  
• Cognitive impairment that prevents participant’s understanding or ability to comply with 
study requirements;  or 
• Emotional distress that results in psychosis or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_705984].   
In these situations, study staff will continue to follow -up until participants are under the care of 
their provider.  
Participants may voluntarily wi thdraw their participation in the study at any time and for any 
reason. We anticipate that the family care team may wish to withdraw at the time of the death of 
the care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  Participants will continue to be followed, with their permission, even if 
withdrawal occurs prior to all study activities being completed. All participants that withdraw 
early, but continue to be followed, will receive follow -up calls to complete the Telephone 
Administered Adverse Event Mon itoring Form .  Participants will be asked to complete the Final 
Evaluation  for the study (see Section 6.1.4 ) at the same time point of those in their cohort. If 
participants withdraw s prior to completing all study activities  and refuses to be followed , they 
will be  instructed to connect with their primary care provider for any unresolved adverse events 
and asked to complete the Final Evaluation  for the study (see Section 6.1.4 ) at the time of 
withdrawing from the study.   
If the withdrawal rate is higher than anticipated (see Section 9.3 ), additional cohorts may be 
recruited to reach an adequate sample size.  
[ADDRESS_959410] design will 
assess  the primary outcomes of feasi bility and acceptability.  Eight weekly intervention sessions 
with a retreat is considered the minimum amount of time needed to deliver all components of the 
intervention.  Please see Table 3 for reliability and validity information for each of the scales.  
 
SPECIFIC AIM 1: To determine the feasibility and acceptability of a telephone -delivered 
mindfulness training intervention (TMT) in decreasing caregiver burden among rural, African 
American, informal caregiving teams of people with dementia.  
 
Hypothesis 1 :  TMT will be feasible within the rural, African American, informal caregiving 
teams. Feasibility is established when 85% (95% CI:  72.5, 97.5) of participants in the telephone -
delivered mindfulness training intervention complete at least six sessions of the intervention.

SPECIFIC AIM 2: To explore, on a preliminary basis, the effects of the training on caregiver 
burden and  relevant secondary outcomes for both caregiving team members , including:  
 
Hypothesis 1:  Compared with baseline levels, we hypothesize that mindfulness training will 
reduce caregiver burden (Zarit Burden Interview).  
 
Hypothesis 2:  Compared with baseline levels, we hypothesize that mindfulness training will 
improve emotion regulation by [CONTACT_706022][INVESTIGATOR_175812] (acceptance, positive 
refocusing, positive reappraisal) and decreasing negative copi[INVESTIGATOR_175812] (rumination, 
catastrophizing, self -blame) as measured by [CONTACT_705997].  
 
Hypothesis 3:  Compared with baseline levels, we hypothesize that mindfulness training will 
increase tolerance of uncertainty as measured by (an adapted form of) the Intolerance of 
Unce rtainty Scale.  
 
Hypothesis 4:  Compared with baseline levels, we hypothesize that training in mindful 
communication will increase perceived social support among the caregivers (PROMIS Social 
Support short forms).  
 
 Hypothesis 5:  Compared with baseline le vels, we hypothesize that training in mindful 
communication reduce family conflict around caregiving (Family Conflict Scale).  
 
Hypothesis 6:  Compared with baseline levels, we hypothesize that mindfulness training will 
reduce anger and anxiety  (PROMIS scal es). 
 
Hypothesis 7:  Compared with baseline levels, we hypothesize that mindfulness training increase 
global self -perceived physical health (PROMIS short forms).  
 
Hypothesis 8:  Compared with baseline levels, we hypothesize that mindfulness training increase 
meaning and purpose (PROMIS short form).  
 
Hypothesis 9:  Compared with baseline levels, we hypothesize that mindfulness training along 
with a caregiver resources handbook w ill increase caregiver general and emotional self-efficacy  
(PROMIS scales) . 
 
Hypothesis 10: Compared with baseline levels, we hypothesize that mindfulness training will 
increase family satisfaction (Family Satisfaction Scale) .

 Hypothesis 11: Compared with  baseline levels, we hypothesize that mindfulness training will 
increase  mindfulness (Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale).  
 
 
SPECIFIC AIM 3: To explore comfort with and willingness to adopt technologies (e.g. 
telephone -based, web -based) to access mi ndfulness practices and existing caregiving educational 
resources. As part of intervention planning, using interviews, we will investigate comfort with a 
smartphone/tablet. For half of the groups of participants, we will provide a tablet loaded with the 
handbook and all of the intervention materials.  In this way we can compare engagement and 
program acceptability rates between groups who received the tablets and those who did not.

withdrawal rate of 10-15%.  We anticipate having [ADDRESS_959412] 75-80% power 
to detect a pre -post difference in the ZBI means of 3.3 – 4.[ADDRESS_959413] size is consistent with those reported in other 
mindfulness interventions.  The sample size of 32 with a feasibility of 85% woul d result in a 
95% CI of 72.5 to 97.5.  Similarly, a sample size of 32 with an acceptability of 85% (based on 
interviews with participants) will result in a 95% CI of 72.[ADDRESS_959414] a

Quantitative variables  
For all quantitative questionnaire measures (outcomes 3 -11), the change in the measure 
from baseline to post -participation is the outc ome.  First, we will examine variable distributions 
and missing data patterns. Next, we will conduct exploratory, descriptive analyses to assess 
patterns of change  associated with participation in the programs for each of the vari ables 
including proximal mediating  outcomes , intermediate outcomes ( secondary stressors ), and distal 
health outcomes .  Because all analyses are exploratory , we will next perform bivariat e 
assessments utilizing a paired t -test, analyzing caregivers  and care partners separately.  We do

adult child, other r elative). In this small study (32 dyads), it will not be possible to formerly 
assess subgroups defined by [CONTACT_547].  However, we will produce descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_706029].  
We plan to invoke an intention -to-treat analysis in dealing with mis sing data using multiple 
imputation or full information maximum likelihood methods.   
 
Qualitative variables  
We will collect three types of formal qualitative data: 1) telephone interviews wi th key 
informants; 2) interviews with CG and CP prior to and foll owing each 8 -week class; and 3) 
transcriptions of audio -recorded classes. See key informant topi[INVESTIGATOR_409960]. We will use the 
insights from key informants to adjust the intervention including the content and the logistics as 
needed.  
Pre-participation interview s will address  participant expectations and concerns about the research 
process in general and the intervention in particular.   
Post-participation interviews will address CG/CP’s attitudes and experiences with the 
intervention , including:  
• The most memorab le aspects of the class sessions ;  
• The perceived value and cultural congruence of the mindfulness training;  
• The usefulness, challenges, and recommended changes  in intervention 
components or language ;  
• The perceived value of various intervention components  for management of stress 
related to caregiving or family conflict;  
• Their recommendations for tools that might help maintain practices , if desired ;  
• Their unfulfilled expectations of the intervention ;  
• The usefulness of the technology c omponents (e.g., call -in lines and/or tablets).   
Each interview will be audio -recorded and transcribed. Using transcripts of key informant 
interviews and post -participation interviews, two or more research team members will apply a 
thematic analysis strat egy, coding each transcript and identifying themes within and across 
interviews, with subsequent discussion of themes  among members of the qualitative analysis 
team  and resolution of discrepancies.  The qualitative analysis team , who will include the PIs an d 
[CONTACT_399548], among others on the study team,  will categorize the themes and present them to the 
Advisory Council for further input.  Results will inform improvements  in subsequent iterations  
of the intervention as well as the development of larger -scaled in terventions.

document all  protocol deviation s in the secure online database, REDCap , as they occur.  
The entire study team will discuss deviations at monthly team meetings and report  them 
to the IRB annually .  Corrective action plans will be developed and submitted to the IRB 
as part of the reporting process  
10.3.5  Monitoring  
The data manager (co -investigator) will review REDCap data for protocol compliance 
(including eligibility criteria) and audi t data entry monthly within one month of the 
beginning of the first intervention group.  This will include a biannual review of study 
instruments for range and consistency checks, and descriptive analyses to assess 
distributions of study variables. The pro ject manager will review consent forms for 
completeness and institute remedial training for the research assistant as needed.  The 
project manager is responsible for creating and reviewing the MOPs.  
Quality assurance of qualitative measures (project manager) include 1) maintaining a 
database of scheduled, completed, transcribed, and analyzed classes and group 
evaluations; 2) establishing a transcription template to ensure data are uniform in 
appearance; 3) arranging for secure storage of reco rdings and transcripts; and 4) review 
of recordings to assess accuracy of transcriptions.  
Master Protocol  
Caregiver Grant (R21 AG061728 -01)  Page [ADDRESS_959423] (IRB) Review  
This protocol and the informed consent documents  and any subsequent modifications will  be 
reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_706032] . The IRB application, 
modification and renewal procedures will be adhered to throughout the st udy.    
11.2 Informed Consent Forms  
Interested caregivers meeting the screening criteria for eligibility in the study will be given a 
copy of the informed consent form (ICF) in the presence of the research assistant . The research 
assistant will read the ICF to the potential participant pointing out important aspects in each 
section and answering any questions.  The caregiver may choose to sign the ICF at that time or to 
make another appointment for the research assistant to return. The ICF  will describe the purp ose 
of the study, the procedures to be followed, reasons not to be in the study, the risks and benefits 
of participation, responsibilities of the participant, incentives and remunerations, privacy and 
confidentiality measures, and the names and contact [CONTACT_706033] [INVESTIGATOR_105092]. 
After the caregiver agrees to participate and signs the ICF, the research assistant will sign.  If 
verbal consent, the staff member will indicate verbal consent was given on the consent form. A 
copy will be given to  each caregiver  and this fact will be documented in the participant’s record.  
 
Because care partners may live at some distance from the caregiver, a telephone consenting 
procedure will be implemented.  The procedure will include all of the aspects of the w ritten 
consent, but will enable interested care partners to give their verbal consent  over the telephone .  
Each care partner will receive a copy of the ICF in the mail.  Their verbal consent will be 
documented in their record.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_959424] (HIPAA). Research records arising from this study will be retained at a 
secure UNC -maintained locked site for [ADDRESS_959425] the site will be identified only by a 
participant identification number (Study ID) to maintain confidentiality. All paper records will 
be kept in a locked file cabinet. All computer entry and networking programs will be done using 
Study IDs only. Information will not be released without written permission of the participant, 
except as necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_1744], the FDA, the NIA, and the OHRP.  
11.4 Study Discontinuation  
The study may be discontinued at any time by [CONTACT_1201], the NIA, the OHRP, the FDA, or other 
government agencies as part of their duties to ensure that research participants are protected.

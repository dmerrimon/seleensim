The purpose of this protocol is to serve as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_323678], advanced squamous cell carcinoma.  The primary hypothesis is that cetuximab used in

- 4 -the neoadjuvant setting for locally advanced squamous cell carcinomas is both safe and well 
tolerated and that its use may enhance the treatment of advanced cases of SCCS when delivered 
preoperatively. The overall treatment strategy expressed in the protocol is to treat locally 
advanced/unresectable squamous cell carcinomas with 8 weeks of neoadjuvant cetuximab, and 
monitor patients for disease response, adverse events, and overall safety. Potentially, patients may be 
able to go on to surgical resection if adequate disease response is achieved. The hope is that the data 
derived from this study will lead to a large randomized trial testing the efficacy of this approach in 
this disease, which has few available treatment options. 
1.1 Primary Objective(s)
The co-primary endpoints are to 
a) assess the response rate of cetuximab by [CONTACT_323703], b) 
to assess whether neoadjuvant cetuximab given in this patient population is both safe and feasible. 
1.2 Secondary Objective(s)
1.2.[ADDRESS_399447] a biopsy of the locoregional disease (primary site 
or neck lymph nodes), and of the skin prior to therapy. Patients will also have tissue harvested at 
surgery that will undergo molecular analysis, or a second post treatment biopsy if surgery is not 
feasible. Our goals in the molecular analysis are to explore the following possibilities:
-Analyze the relationship of known DNA mutations in tumor per the FoundationOneTM  
genomic profile, and correlate to clinical endpoints such as clinical benefit and conversion to 
resectability to discover potential markers of response and/or resistance.
-Measure the downstream activation of signaling pathways without a known driver, including the 
EGFR pathway.
-Determine if tumor shrinkage with cetuximab is associated with increased apoptosis as 
evidenced by [CONTACT_323704]-3, in pre- and post- treatment tumor tissues.
-Determine whether cetuximab results in increased ADCC in post-, compared with pre-treatment 
tumor tissues.
 
2. Background and Significance
2.[ADDRESS_399448] common malignancies among Caucasians. 
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin is an increasingly common diagnosis, and is the second 
most common type of skin cancer worldwide (Alam and Ratner 2001). Specifically, results from a 
population based study performed in the [LOCATION_002] using governmental data on skin cancer 
procedures and related office visits estimated the number of new skin cancer diagnoses to be over

- 5 -3.5 million in 2006 (Rogers, Weinstock et al. 2010). Regardless of the true incidence, it is known 
that the number of cases has consistently risen over the past 20 years. This observation can be related 
to improved detection of skin cancer, increased UV and tanning bed exposure, and the aging of the 
U.S. population, since the incidence of SCCS increases dramatically with age (Bauman, Eaton et al. 
2007). It follows, then, that with a 10% decrease in stratospheric ozone annually and the continued 
growth of the aging U.S. population, the number of metastatic squamous cancers arising from a skin 
primary is certain to continue increasing annually for the foreseeable future. These cancers also 
plague patients who are recipi[INVESTIGATOR_171886], historically a difficult population of 
patients for the delivery of cytotoxic systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
It should be noted that SCC and its precursor lesions can carry a significant morbidity 
associated with diagnosis, with an opportunity for recurrence, local or distant metastases, treatment 
related complications, and increased risk for development of secondary cancers (Wassberg, Thorn et 
al. 1999). Most often, these lesions are localized and amenable to surgery.  Larger and more invasive 
lesions often require multimodality care, but relatively little has been done to investigate a 
generalized management plan for these situations (Gaffney, Soyer et al. 2013). As a result, there is a 
lack of high-level data on systemic treatment options for cutaneous SCC unamenable to resection.  A 
10-year cohort study involving 985 patients with SCC found a 3.7% risk of metastasis and 2.1% risk 
of disease-specific death (Schmults, Karia et al. 2013). Published case reports have demonstrated 
responses with platinum-based chemotherapy with occasional complete responses noted in this 
patient population (Lawson, Otto et al. 2008, Nakamura, Okuyama et al. 2013). There are no 
prospective phase III studies available, and only one prospective phase II study regarding the use of 
platinum-based chemotherapy in this population. Cisplatin, either as a single agent or combined with 
5-FU, has occasionally produced useful responses, but again, data supporting efficacy is limited. In 
the only phase II study of biochemotherapy with interferon alfa, cis-retinoic acid and cisplatin, 35 
patients were assessed for response, 11 of which had distant metastases (Shin, Glisson et al. 2002). 
One of the 11 patients experienced a complete response. Twelve patients with only regional lymph 
node metastases were treated and 3 had either a partial (2) or complete (1) response. This lends some 
credence to a cisplatin-based regimen. Other studies are retrospective and most are anecdotal 
(Weinberg, Ogle et al. 2007, Cranmer, Engelhardt et al. 2010). In summary, historically, advanced 
SCCS is incredibly challenging to treat given its presence in a patient population which often has 
multiple comorbidities. In addition, the absence of randomized clinical trials that would provide 
guidelines for therapy further complicates this clinical situation. These facts underscore that this 
population of patients represents an unmet medical need that is likely to grow as the elderly 
U.S. patient population increases and as such, is a ripe area for clinical investigation. 
 One potential novel treatment option includes targeting the epi[INVESTIGATOR_323679], including squamous cell carcinomas of the skin 
(DeConti 2012). The epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) has also been implicated in SCC 
development, specifically, it has been shown to be involved in UV-induced skin carcinogenesis 
(Gaffney, Soyer et al. 2013). Additional evidence in support of a relevant role of EGFR expression 
in these cancers includes a retrospective study, which demonstrated that primary cutaneous SCC of 
the head and neck that subsequently metastasized were more likely to overexpress EGFR than those

- 6 -that did not (Bonner, Harari et al. 2006). Accordingly, the development of anti-EGFR drugs has been 
pursued for use in various malignancies. 
One such new EGFR-directed therapy is cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody that 
competitively inhibits EGFR (Gaffney, Soyer et al. 2013). Its mechanism of action is likely dual, in 
that it competitively inhibits natural EGFR ligands, preventing EGFR phosphorylation and it elicits 
antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Fan, Masui et al. 1993, Lopez-Albaitero and Ferris 
2007). It has been approved in the treatment of SCC of the head and neck, in combination with 
radiation and/or platinum-based chemotherapy (Gaffney, Soyer et al. 2013). A randomized 
controlled trial by [CONTACT_262504]. in advanced oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx SCC of external 
beam radiation therapy + cetuximab versus EBRT alone revealed an improvement in 5 year overall 
survival for the cetuximab arm from 36.4% to 45.6% (Bonner, Harari et al. 2006). Cetuximab has 
also been used in EGFR-expressing, KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancers in combination 
with chemotherapy regimens (Gaffney, Soyer et al. 2013). Additionally, studies demonstrating the 
efficacy of Cetuximab in recurrent squamous cell carcinomas have been promising (Bauman, Eaton 
et al. 2007). Data regarding use of cetuximab in advanced SCCS is scarce and consists of a few case 
series reports and one phase II trial (Nadiminti, Shao et al. 2013). The largest of these studies was 
published by [CONTACT_323705], who reported the use of cetuximab as first line therapy for unresectable 
squamous cell carcinoma of the skin expressing EGFR in a phase II nonrandomized setting.  The 
trial accrued 36 poor-prognosis patients and demonstrated an overall disease control rate of 69% 
(Maubec, Petrow et al. 2011). Additionally, a prospective study looking at cetuximab with or 
without systemic chemotherapy in patients with locally recurrent or unresectable disease 
demonstrated clinical improvement in pain, tumor ulcer, and bleeding compared to pretreatment 
symptoms. Treatment with cetuximab was generally well tolerated with the main side effect being 
skin rash (Nadiminti, Shao et al. 2013). Multiple published case and retrospective reports have 
documented tumor responses in patients with SCCS treated with cetuximab (Bauman, Eaton et al. 
2007, Suen, Bressler et al. 2007, Miller, Sherman et al. 2010, Kim, Eleff et al. 2011, Kalapurakal, 
Malone et al. 2012), with one from our institution demonstrating an impressive complete response in 
an elderly patient with squamous disease (Kim, Eleff et al. 2011) (Figure 1).

CINJ#: [ADDRESS_399449] mechanism of 
action in this disease is not clear. Cetuximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody of the 
immunoglobulin G1 class, which binds with high affinity to the extracellular domain of the human 
EGFR. As the affinity of cetuximab for EGFR is approximately 5 to 10 fold higher than that of the 
endogenous ligands, it blocks the binding of these ligands to the extracellular domain of the receptor 
as well as ligand dimerization, resulting in inhibition of the receptor function and signaling 
(Markovic and Chung 2012). Furthermore, cetuximab induces the internalization of EGFR, which 
can lead to downregulation of EGFR (Figure 2). Binding to EGFR blocks phosphorylation and 
activation of receptor-associated kinases, resulting in inhibition of cell growth leading to apoptosis 
(Kirkwood, Butterfield et al. 2012). However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_323680] 80-90% of head 
and neck cancers, clinical activity remains limited to 10-20%.   In addition, unlike in non small cell 
lung cancer, activating mutations in EGFR are rare in squamous carcinomas arising in the head and 
neck, and in limited analyses done to date, also in squamous carcinomas arising in the skin (Chung, 
Ely et al. 2006).  
It is possible that in squamous cancers of the skin, a tumor type prone to a heavy mutation 
burden given its exposure to and dependence upon UV radiation for initiation, driver mutations may 
play a lesser role in tumor development and maintenance, or are as of yet, undiscovered. In this 
disease, cetuximab may be exerting antitumor activity through other mechanisms. For instance, as a 
chimeric IgG1 type monoclonal antibody, cetuximab may initiate antitumor responses through 
targeting of cytotoxic immune effector cells towards EGFR expressing tumor cells (antibody 
dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity) (Vermorken, Mesia et al. 2008, Martinelli, De Palma et al. 
2009, Srivastava, Lee et al. 2013). This mechanism has recently been implicated in squamous 
malignancies of the head and neck. 
In summary, cetuximab exhibits antitumor activity in advanced cases of squamous carcinoma 
of the skin, a population that represents a major unmet need with few proven treatment options.  Our 
planned study will assess the ability of cetuximab to shrink locally advanced or aggressive tumors 
prior to surgery, measuring tumor response rate as a co-primary endpoint, and will investigate 
whether the delivery of this medication could possibly result in improved surgical reconstructive 
options. This trial will provide a unique window of opportunity to investigate the antitumor activity 
of cetuximab in patients with aggressive or recurrent squamous skin cancers who are candidates for 
neoadjuvant cetuximab. This trial will also allow us to assess the safety and feasibility of cetuximab 
in this patient population, which historically is of greater age and has more comorbid conditions than

- 8 -patients with other advanced squamous tumors, such as locally advanced squamous tumors of the 
head and neck. 
An important strength of this study is the use of serial biopsies to allow us to investigate the 
mechanism of action of cetuximab and to discover potential predictors of response and/or resistance 
that can be validated in future trials.  Our mechanistic studies will focus on 1) apoptosis and 2) 
ADCC as possible mechanisms of cell death. Pre-and post-treatment tissues will be assayed for 
evidence of increased caspase-3 as an indication of apoptosis and for evidence of ADCC.  We will 
also measure changes in protein or mRNA production in response to cetuximab that may lead us to 
discover potential mechanisms of response or resistance. For instance, as we are also investigating in 
protocol CINJ# 031204, there is evidence that EGFR and IGF-1R interact on multiple levels, either 
through a direct association between the two receptors, by [CONTACT_323706], or indirectly, via common interaction partners such as G protein coupled receptors (GPCR) 
or downstream signaling molecules, a cross-talk that may play a role in resistance to EGFR 
inhibitors.  We will be able to explore protein expression of EGFR and IGFR pathway members in 
pre-and –post treatment tumor samples. Finally, we will utilize the FoundationOne genomic profile 
to assess the relationship of known DNA mutations with clinical endpoints such as clinical benefit 
and conversion to resectability.  It is known that mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene are 
very common in SCCs (Brash, Rudolph et al. 1991) and occur early in skin cancer development in 
keratinocytes (Jonason, Kunala et al. 1996, McGregor, Berkhout et al. 1997). Inactivation of 
CDKN2A and activating RAS mutations have also been described (Boukamp 2005). It is not clear, 
however, if these events are the main drivers of tumor initiation and maintenance, or if other 
potentially targetable genomic gains or losses occur which may be responsible. Our analysis will 
provide preliminary information that may shape personalization of treatment for these patients and 
optimize patient selection for therapy in the future. Of great use will also be the banked tumors that 
will be collected and stored as part of this study, an extremely useful resource for testing alternative 
hypotheses as additional information becomes available.

5.6 Study Enrollment Procedures 
A copy of the institution’s IRB-approved informed consent document and written justification for 
any changes made to the informed consent for this protocol must be on file at the Rutgers Cancer 
Institute of New Jersey’s Office of Human Research Services (OHRS) before any participating 
institution may enter patients. The CINJOG institution consent form must be reviewed and approved 
by [CONTACT_323707] (i.e., IRB approved 
documentation, IRB approved consent form, etc.).
To register eligible patients on this study, each site will contact [CONTACT_119361]. Contact [CONTACT_323708]. The signed and dated eligibility checklist, completed signature 
[CONTACT_323723] [CONTACT_323709]. Once OHRS verifies eligibility, a unique patient study number will be issued. The patient 
will not be identified by [CONTACT_2300]. This is the point that the patient is considered on study. Patients must 
not start protocol treatment prior to registration.
If a patient does not receive any protocol therapy, baseline data will be collected and submitted on 
the pre-study and follow-up electronic case report forms (eCRF). The reason for not starting protocol 
therapy will be documented in the “follow-up eCRF”. Case report form completion instructions and 
training will be provided to each participating institution prior to study activation at the participating 
institution.

cetuximab monotherapy in these patients with locally advanced or recurrent SCCS. Once treatment 
response to cetuximab monotherapy is established, the determination of patient tolerance to the 
selected dose and disease response/potential resectability of the lesion will be determined. 
7.2 Sequence of treatment
7.2.1 Prior to neoadjuvant cetuximab
Patients will be staged using imaging to delineate the extent of disease. Initial biopsy 
specimen (preferably a core biopsy as opposed to a FNA) will be procured from the 
primary cutaneous site. If the patient is found to have regional lymph node involvement, 
core biopsy of accessible node will also be obtained.  Samples will be used for 
confirmation of diagnosis as well as DNA and RNA genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. These specimens will be 
flash frozen and brought that same day to the Biospecimen Repository Service (BRS).
7.2.2 Neoadjuvant Cetuximab
Patients who agree and are eligible for this protocol will initially receive 8 weeks of 
neoadjuvant cetuximab. The initial dose of cetuximab will be 400 mg/m2 IV, followed by

versus progressive or stable disease ( Eisenhauer et al. 2009). The RECIST criteria will be 
applied to the combination of primary site and associated neck lymphadenopathy.
RECIST Criteria
Complete Response (CR) Disappearance of all target lesions
Partial Response (PR)
At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum LD.
Progressive Disease (PD)
At least a 20% increase in the sum of the 
LD of target lesions, taking as reference 
the smallest sum LD recorded since the 
treatment started or the appearance of 
one or more new lesions.
Stable disease (SD)
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify 
for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify 
for PD, taking as reference the smallest 
sum LD since the treatment started.
7.2.4 Repeat Bx after neoadjuvant cetuximab. 
After 8 weeks of neoadjuvant cetuximab, tissue will either be harvested at surgery, or if 
the patient is not a surgical candidate, a biopsy specimen (preferably a core biopsy as

the BRS. 
7.3 Study Agent (Cetuximab)
Cetuximab is an anti-EGFR receptor humanized chimeric monoclonal antibody. It is supplied as 100 
mg/50 mL, single-use vial or a 200 mg/100 mL, single-use vial. For more information on this agent, 
refer to the FDA approved Package Insert.
7.3.1 Dose Calculation
Doses will be calculated on day 1 of each cycle using the patient’s actual weight in the 
determination of body surface area. A variance of 10% of the calculated total dose will be allowed.
BSA (m 2) =square root of ((height inches) x (weight lbs) /3131)
7.3.2 Treatment Administration
During neoadjuvant cetuximab, the initial dose is 400 mg/m2 administered as a 120 minute 
intravenous infusion (maximum infusion rate 10 mg/min). The subsequent weekly doses are 250 
mg/m2 infused over 60 minutes (maximum infusion rate 10 mg/min). If a weight change of ≥ 10% 
occurs, the cetuximab dose should be adjusted.
Cetuximab should not be delivered as an intravenous push or bolus. Administer via infusion pump or 
syringe pump. Do not exceed an infusion rate of 10 mg/min. Administer through a low protein 
binding 0.22- micrometer in-line filter. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for 
particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. 
The solution should be clear and colorless and may contain a small amount of easily visible, white, 
amorphous, cetuximab particulates. Do not shake or dilute.
7.3.3 Dose Modifications or Escalations
[IP_ADDRESS] Cetuximab related Folliculitis
Patients will concomitantly be assessed for the presence of cetuximab related folliculitis given the 
published correlation of folliculitis with clinical benefit (Bonner 2006). After MD visits, the patient 
will be assessed for the development of folliculitis characteristic of EGFR inhibition. Though the 
rash associated with EGFR inhibition appears similar to acne vulgaris and is commonly referred to 
as acne, acne-like, or acneiform, these terms are technically inaccurate. EGFR-associated rash is 
dominated by [CONTACT_323711]—the hallmarks of an 
infectious folliculitis. Per Perez-Soler, the typi[INVESTIGATOR_323684] a clinical presentation

Serious infusion reactions occurred with the administration of Cetuximab in approximately 3% of 
patients in clinical trials, with fatal outcome reported in less than 1 in 1000. Reduce the infusion rate 
by 50% for NCI CTCAE Grade 1 or 2 and non-serious NCI CTCAE Grades 3–[ADDRESS_399462] should receive no further cetuximab treatment. 
Immediately and permanently discontinue cetuximab for serious infusion reactions that are life 
threatening and/or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. All patients will be premedicated with diphenhydramine 
hydrochloride, 50 mg, (or an equivalent antihistamine) by i.v. 30-[ADDRESS_399463] obstruction (bronchospasm, stridor, hoarseness), hypotension, shock, loss of 
consciousness, myocardial infarction, and/or cardiac arrest. Severe (NCI CTCAE Grades 3 and 4) 
infusion reactions occurred in 2–5% of 1373 patients in clinical trials, with fatal outcome in 1 
patient. Approximately 90% of severe infusion reactions occurred with the first infusion despi[INVESTIGATOR_323686].
Monitor patients for 1 hour following Cetuximab infusions in a setting with resuscitation equipment 
and other agents necessary to treat anaphylaxis (eg, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], corticosteroids, intravenous 
antihistamines, bronchodilators, and oxygen). Monitor longer to confirm resolution of the event in 
patients requiring treatment for infusion reactions. Immediately and permanently discontinue 
Cetuximab in patients with serious infusion reactions.
Infusion reactions may be managed per the following table:
Adverse Event Grade Treatment Guidelines
Grade 1: 
Transient flushing or rash; drug fever < 38° C 
(< 100° F)For mild infusion reactions manifesting only as 
delayed drug fever, consider administering 
prophylactic antihistamine medications for 
subsequent doses. Maintain the cetuximab 
dose, but slow the infusion rate by 50%. 
Acetaminophen or a non-steroidal anti- 
inflammatory drug (NSAID) may be 
administered prior to subsequent cetuximab 
infusions, if not otherwise contraindicated in 
subjects.

[IP_ADDRESS] Rash management
Patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_323688], and appropriate treatment of these 
symptoms initiated. Below are suggestions for managing cetuximab induced rash:
Antibiotics:  The benefit of routine antibiotics in uncomplicated (uninfected) rash is unclear. 
Some clinicians have used oral minocycline (Minocin), mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190] (Bactroban), or topi[INVESTIGATOR_028] (Cleocin). Rash complicated by [CONTACT_323713].
Antihistamines: Benadryl or Atarax may be helpful to control itching.
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_193573]: The benefit of topi[INVESTIGATOR_193574]. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_323689].
Retinoids: No data to support use. Use is not advised. They will not be used 
prophylactically.
Benzoyl peroxide: Should NOT be usedas it may aggravate rash.
Makeup: Rash can be covered with makeup; this should not make it worse (use a 
dermatologist-approved cover-up, e.g., Dermablend, or any other type of foundation). Remove 
makeup with a skin-friendly liquid cleanser, e.g., Neutrogena, Dove, or Ivory Skin Cleansing Liqui-
Gel.
Moisturizers: Use emollients to prevent and alleviate the skin dryness, e.g., Neutrogena 
Norwegian Formula Hand Cream or Vaseline Intensive Care Advanced Healing Lotion.

- 23 -Sunlight: It is recommended that patients wear sunscreen and hats and limit sun exposure 
while receiving cetuximab as sunlight can exacerbate any skin reactions that may occur.
Over-the-counter medications: Over-the-counter acne vulgaris medications (e.g., benzoyl 
peroxide) are not advised. This rash is not like acne vulgaris and these treatments could make it 
worse.
7.3.6 Adherence/Compliance
Patients will receive weekly cetuximab per their medical oncologist. They should adhere to their 
oncologist’s recommendations (based on the protocol) regarding administration of cetuximab. 
Failure to do so may result in removal from the study.
8. Toxicity Monitoring and Adverse Event Reporting
All patients who receive one dose of protocol therapy will be evaluable for assessment of 
toxicity.  Prior to each cycle the treating physician will fully assess the patient’s condition with 
respect to possible treatment related toxicities.  All adverse events, whether observed by [CONTACT_119376], occurring during the active portion of therapy, or up to [ADDRESS_399467] dose of treatment will be graded by a numerical score according to the NCI’s 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html) and recorded in the patient’s medical record. For the 
purposes of reporting laboratory abnormalities, only Grade 3-4 adverse events will be recorded 
on the adverse event CRF pages.  Grade 1-2 laboratory abnormalities will not be recorded on the 
adverse event CRF pages.  Information entered on the adverse event CRF pages will include: 
Specific type and duration of reaction (i.e., start and stop dates, resolution).
Severity/grade. 
Relationship to study drug (causality, attribution).
Management of the event, if treated with medication and other actions taken to 
alleviate the clinical event.
Whether or not it was considered a SAE. 
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition 
will be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition 
worsens during the study period.
8.1 Adverse Event Reporting Requirements 
An adverse experience is defined as any unintended or abnormal clinical observation that is not 
of benefit to the patient.  Either the condition was not present prior to exposure to the study 
therapy, or it has worsened in intensity or frequency following exposure to the study therapy.

Death
Life-threatening- immediate risk of death from the reaction.
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.
Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Requires intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.
The definition of serious adverse event (experience) also includes important medical events.  
Medical and scientific judgment will be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_79467].  These events 
will usually be considered serious.  Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].
8.3 Definition of Related
There is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse experience.  That is, the event 
is judged by [CONTACT_1010], probably or definitely related to the treatment.

 9. Treatment Evaluation/Criteria for Response
For the purposes of this study, the response to neoadjuvant cetuximab is judged by 1) development 
of cetuximab related folliculitis as below and 2) response at the primary site or involved locoregional 
lymph nodes by [CONTACT_323714].
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the international criteria proposed by 
[CONTACT_8225] (RECIST 1.1) Committee (Eisenhauer et al. 
2009)Changes in only the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are 
used in the RECIST criteria. Note: Lesions are either measurable or non- measurable using the 
criteria provided below. The term “evaluable” in reference to measurability will not be used because 
it does not provide additional meaning or accuracy.
In addition, patients will be evaluated weekly during neoadjuvant cetuximab to assess for grade of 
rash using CTCAE 4.0 criteria.
9.1 Evaluation of folliculitis
Folliculitis will be graded weekly following the initiation of neoadjuvant cetuximab per the criteria

Recist Criteria
Complete Response (CR) Disappearance of all target lesions
Partial Response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum LD.
Progressive Disease (PD) At least a 20% increase in the sum of the 
LD of target lesions, taking as reference 
the smallest sum LD recorded since the 
treatment started or the appearance of

- 26 -one or more new lesions.
Stable disease (SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify 
for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify 
for PD, taking as reference the smallest 
sum LD since the treatment started.
10. Removal of Patients from Study/Off Study Criteria
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue until one of the 
following criteria applies:
a)  Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, 
b)  Patient decides to withdraw from the study, 
c)  Noncompliance with treatment plan, 
d) General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for 
further treatment in the judgment of the investigator,
e) Protocol violation - any patient found to have entered this study in violation of the protocol 
might be discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Principal Investigator. 
11. Laboratory Evaluations and Procedures/Correlative and Pharmacokinetic Studies
11.1 An overview of the possible molecular investigations, and in order or priority include 
1. FoundationOne genomic profile from paraffin embedded tumor samples taken before 
cetuximab, before/at definitive local treatment and after progression
2. Analysis of ADCC and caspase by [CONTACT_4658]
3. RNA sequencing of tumor samples before and after cetuximab
4. RNA sequencing of skin samples before and after cetuximab
5. DNA sequencing of tumor and skin samples before and after cetuximab
6. IHC analysis of EGFR downstream pathways that are illuminated by [CONTACT_323715], ranging from partial DNA sequencing 
(FoundationOne™) in order to check for a battery of known DNA mutations related to cancer, to 
RNA sequencing on fresh tissue, which will shed light on how protein production is altered when the 
tumor is treated with cetuximab. FoundationOne™ is targeted DNA sequencing that is performed on 
paraffin embedded tumor samples. As a pan-cancer test, FoundationOne™ is designed to interrogate 
the entire coding sequence of 236 cancer-related genes (3,769 exons) plus 47 introns from 19 genes 
often rearranged or altered in cancer. These genes are known to be somatically altered in human 
solid cancers based on recent scientific and clinical literature.  ADCC and caspase will be examined

CINJ#: [ADDRESS_399472] and other relevant signaling pathways. In addition, HPV status can be easily 
determined from RNA sequencing. Once the cDNA library is created by [CONTACT_323716] (Curtis Krier and, Emmanuel Zachariah), analysis will be performed by 
[CONTACT_323717]. We will have experience with the procedures necessary to perform these analyses 
that are ongoing in protocol CINJ #091305. In addition, these complementary protocols will allow us 
to conduct parallel investigations in squamous tumors of the skin versus those of the head and neck, 
and to see if similar mechanisms are operative or if in fact these tumors are distinct biologic entities. 
11.[ADDRESS_399473] a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of skin prior to entering into 
this protocol. This diagnosis is typi[INVESTIGATOR_323691] a biopsy from either the primary site or FNA 
from a neck lymph node. However, the scant amount of tissue obtainable from an FNA would not be 
adequate for the molecular biology aspect of this protocol, which include
1. Providing tissue to the pathology department so that they are able to confirm diagnosis of 
SCC in the tissue retrieved, which then will be sent to FoundationOne™ for DNA 
sequencing and analysis of genetic mutations. 
2. Providing frozen tumor to the Cancer Institute Functional Genomics Facility for RNA 
sequencing
3. Providing frozen tumor and skin tissue to be used in Western Blot analysis.
4. Providing FFPE tumor and skin tissue for use in IHC analysis. 
Thus, all patients on the protocol, prior to neoadjuvant cetuximab, will have an incisional/core 
biopsy from the primary site and a skin punch biopsy even though they already have a diagnosis of 
SCC. Incisional biopsy is favored over other types (core biopsy) for this biopsy because incisional 
biopsy has the best chance of supplying an adequate tumor sample. 
After neoadjuvant cetuximab, additional tissue will be obtained at surgery or if the patient is not a 
candidate for surgery, biopsy will be obtained prior to treatment with XRT or with further systemic 
therapy.  This tissue will only be used for RNA sequencing (and not sent to FoundationOne™ for 
DNA analysis), and thus a core biopsy may be employed here instead of incisional biopsy. A skin 
punch skin biopsy will also be performed after neoadjuvant cetuximab, preferably from a similar 
location as the first skin biopsy i.e. obtain two skin biopsies of neck and neck or right upper chest 
and right upper chest. If there is a locoregional/distant recurrence or persistence, a third incisional 
biopsy of locoregional/distant disease if possible and again paraffin-embedded sample will be sent to 
FoundationOne™ for analysis and fresh tissue may be obtained for RNA sequencing.

reactions (including rash, pruritus, and nail changes), headache, diarrhea, and infection. Refer to the 
package insert for a complete list of toxicities.
Drug Interactions: No known drug interactions with cetuximab.
13. Data Collection and Records to be Kept 
13.1 Case Report Forms
A subset of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) CRFs, in electronic format, will be utilized.   
Completion of the electronic CRFs (eCRFs) will be done in accordance with the instructions in a 
study specific data capture plan.  All eCRFs will be completed by [CONTACT_323719]. The eCRFs will be maintained in a confidential format in a secure database.
13.2 Data Submission Timeline and Forms
Completion of eCRFs will occur in accordance with NCI guidelines.  Baseline (pre-study) 
eCRFs (e.g., enrollment, medical history, concomitant medications, disease assessment, etc.) will 
be completed no later than 14 days after the start of treatment.   Treatment eCRFs (e.g., drug 
administration, adverse events, chemistries, etc.) will be completed no later than 14 days 
following each cycle of treatment.  Off-treatment information (e.g., follow-up, best response, 
etc.) will be completed no later than 14 days after the end of protocol treatment.
13.3 Research Charts

- 30 -14. Data and Safety Monitoring
Monitoring of this study will occur in accordance with the Cancer Institute’s NCI approved Data and 
Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP).  An “initiation audit” will be conducted in accordance with the 
DSMP following enrollment of the first two (2) or three (3) patients.  Subsequent audits will occur 
on an annual basis prior to annual IRB continuing review, if the findings from the initiation audit 
were satisfactory.  More frequent audits of patient data and study conduct will occur if necessary.  
Prior audit findings and/or situations that may arise during the course of the study will determine the 
need for more frequent auditing.  All audit findings will be reported to the Cancer Institute’s Human 
Research Oversight Committee and the PI. 
15. Statistical Considerations
15.1 Primary Hypothesis
We hypothesize that the response rate to cetuximab is greater than 10%. 
15.[ADDRESS_399479] the response rate is 30%. 
With [ADDRESS_399480] at a significance level 0.05 (actual Type I error = 
4.32%) will achieve 76.2% power when true response rate is 30%. 
15.3 Methods for Randomization and Stratification
This is a safety/feasibility study. There will be no randomization.
15.[ADDRESS_399481] (categorical vs. categorical) or two sample t-test (categorical 
vs. continuous) or correlation (continuous vs. continuous) will be used depending upon the types of 
variables in comparisson.

16.2 Potential Risks
Potential risks to the patient secondary to cetuximab include the potential for hypersensitivity 
reaction, rash, hypomagnesemia, and pulmonary complications. These will be monitored as detailed 
in Sections 7.3.3. In terms of the individual’s cancer, there is a risk of treatment not being effective. 
Furthermore, if the drug is not effective, there is the possibility of disease progression.

chemotherapy if applicable, therapy, monitoring off therapy, or enrolling in another clinical trial. 
Additionally, the importance of the knowledge gained through this study will be discussed with the 
patient. 
All told, with the combination of employing proper patient selection and study termination criteria, 
close clinical and lab follow-up (both of the cancer as well as other relevant body systems), and with 
the medical knowledge of cetuximab (as an FDA-approved medication, for oncologic medical 
purposes in head and neck and colon cancer) we believe that the potential benefits outweigh the risks 
of the trial..

- 32 -17. Economic/Financial Considerations
There are no standards of care for patients with SCCS due to the lack of randomized studies in this 
population. However, phase II data for the use of cetuximab exist in this patient population and as 
such, this therapy is often widely available. Thus the treatment modalities of this protocol 
(cetuximab, surgery, radiation) will be paid per usual, by [CONTACT_323721] (charity 
care, medicare, Medicaid). Precertification of these modalities will occur prior to treatment on 
protocol. Funding will be sought for the pretreatment biopsies that are a mandatory part of this study. 
The additional investigational aspects of the study including, IHC, PCR, and RNA sequencing will 
be performed as funds allow, possibly financed through the Precision Medicine Group, or other 
grants. 
19. Publication of Research Findings
The policies and procedures of Rutgers Cancer Institute legal department (see: Investigator’s 
Handbook) will govern publication of the trial. It is expected that the results of this trial will be 
submitted for publication in a timely manner following the conclusion. The PI, and all co-authors 
prior to submission or use, must review any abstract or manuscript.

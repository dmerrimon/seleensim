For a new manufacturing scale, if treatment is not interrupted, PK sample collection will take

If a PK or IgG sample collection for the planned introduction of drug product from Process C( ) 
was erroneously taken, the future sample collection will be adjusted to the blood volume per each

aPatients from DFI13803 are to follow th e pediatric schedule of events in the LTS13632  study.  The pediatric schedule of events is based on pediatric patients receiving 64 weeks of treatment 
in the prior DFI13803 study. The adult sch edule of events is based on adult patients  receiving 26 weeks of treatment in the pri or DFI13412 study. Patients will receive olipudase alfa every 
2 weeks (±3 days). Quarterly visits will occur at the site If the site visit is not possible during a regional or national emer gency declared by a governmental agency such as the COVID-19 
pandemic due to site closure or extenuating  circumstances that prevent an in-person site visit and home infusion is already app roved for the eligible patient, quarterly visits will be done at 
home. Quarterly visit specific assessments that need a site visit  will not be done at that ti me and will be done as unscheduled  as soon as site visits become available. In such a case, some of 
the quarterly visit assessments may be done  by [CONTACT_282137] (eg, lab sampling) and by [CONTACT_282138] (eg, Health-rela ted quality of life instruments). Telehealth visits are an 
acceptable alternative to site visits if the site visit is no t possible during a regional or na tional emergency declared by a g overnmental agency such as the COVID-[ADDRESS_343950] a visit 2 weeks (±7 days) after the last dose of study trea tment.

For both adult and pediatric patients, PK testing will only occur yearly (up to 5 y ears) and upon 
the introduction of a drug product from Process C( ) or Process C( ) at any time during the 
study.  For Process C( ), if treatment is not interrupted, PK collection will take place at the 
patient’s last infusion under the current manufact uring scale and at the first infusion Process 
C( ). For introduction of drug product from Proc ess C( ), if treatment is not interrupted, PK 
sample collection will take place at the sec ond infusion under the Process C( ).  In case 
reintroduction of olipu dase alfa coincides with introducti on of drug product from Process C( ) or 
Process C( ), PK samples will be collected at th e infusion at which patients receive their usual 
dose of olipudase alfa under the new proc ess. For introduction of drug product fro m Process 
C( ), if treatment is not interrupted, PK sample collection will take place at the second infusion 
under Process C( ). 
If a PK sample collection for the planned introduction of drug product from an updated 
manufacturing process was erroneously taken, the future sample collection will be adjusted 
according to the blood volume allowed per each age cohort in order to avoid excessive blood 
withdrawal . For specific details, please refer to Study Manual.

4.1 INTRODUCTION
Human acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) is a serious, rare, life threatening lysosomal 
storage disorder for which only palliative treatmen t exists. Patients with ASMD are unable to 
metabolize sphingomyelin properly due to mu tations in SMPD1, the gene encoding acid 
sphingomyelinase (ASM), whose transcription and translation results in a defective (ASM) enzyme. Inactivity of ASM leads to the lysosomal accumulation of sphingomyelin and, secondarily, increases in cholesterol and other related lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], mostly in the organs, such as the 
spleen, liver, lung, and bone marrow.
Historically, ASMD has been diagnosed as Nieman n-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_206308] (NPD) and of either Type A or
Type B disease. Type A (NPD A) is characterized as the early-onset and acute neuropathic form of (NPD) and results in failure to thrive, hepa tosplenomegaly, rapi[INVESTIGATOR_282102], and death, usually before the age of 3 years ( 1). Niemann-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_282103] B
(NPD B) is a milder disease with little or no neurological involvement that may already have 
manifestations in childhood.  The most common di sease manifestation is hepatosplenomegaly. 
Other more variable features include liver dys function, pulmonary disease, retinal stigmata, and 
growth retardation.  Niemann-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_282104] B is usually diagnosed in childhood after 
organomegaly is observed, typi[INVESTIGATOR_282105] [ADDRESS_344008] been reported. Patien ts with this intermediate form (NPD A/B) may 
develop neurologic symptoms during childhood a nd have a chronic neurodegenerative disease 
course.
[COMPANY_011] Genzyme is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a potential enzyme replacement therapy for ASMD with olipudase 
alfa, a recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase, for the treatment of the non-neurological 
manifestations of ASMD.  This recombinantly-derived enzyme is expressed in Chinese hamster 
ovarian cells transfected with olipudase alfa  complementary DNA that encodes a 627-residue 
peptide chain.  The resulting gene product retains the enzymatic activity and lysosomal targeting of the native protein.
Proof of concept for olipudase alfa therapy has been demonstrated in the acid sphingomyelinase 
knock-out (ASMKO) mouse ( 2), which exhibits both systemic and neurological features of 
ASMD.  Repeat intravenous (IV) bolus administ ration of olipudase alfa to ASMKO mice led to 
dose-dependent reductions of sphingomyelin in viscer al organs and in the lungs to a lesser extent, 
but was unable to prevent neurologic decline and prolong survival ( 3,4). However, chronic 
dosing in the ASMKO animal model is limited because the mice succumb to the neurologic disease resulting from the natural progression of complete ASMD in approximately 6 to 8 months.
Pharmacodynamic (PD), pharmacokinetic (PK), and toxicological studies conducted in the 
ASMKO mouse found significant reductions of sphingomyelin in the liver, lung, kidney, and spleen at olipudase alfa doses ranging from  0.1 to 5.0 mg/kg in a time-dependent manner;

Amended Clinical Trial Protocol No. 07 15-Apr-2022
LTS13632 -olipudase alfa Version number: 1
Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group -strictly confidential Page 72however, toxicity was observed in ASMKO mice given single high -dose boluses of olipudase alfa 
(≥10mg/kg).  The same single, high doses did not cause toxic effects in normal mice, Sprague 
Dawley rats, or cynomolgus monkeys, suggesting that catabolites of sphingomyelin, and not 
olipudase alfa itself, were the cause of the toxic effects.  Subsequent “ debulking” studies in 
ASMKO mice demonstrated that a slow reduction in the sphingomyelin load over time using 
multiple low doses of olipudase alfa (4 doses of 3.0 mg/kg of olipudase alfa administered over 
8days) followed by a high dose (20 mg/kg 3 days la ter) prevented the toxicity associated with the 
single initial high doses.  These findings suggest that the observed toxicity is related to the rate of 
substrate degradation and that step -wise removal of substrate likely mitigates toxicity. 
Furthermore, re peat high doses of olipudase alfa (30 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 7 doses) 
administered after a 7 -day debulking period (3 mg/kg on Days 1,3,5,and7) also did not cause 
toxicity.
During clinical development of olipudase alfa, in cremental changes were made to the olipudase 
alfa manufacturing process. The different processes are referred to as Process B, C( ) and C( ). 
In a completed Phase 1 study ( 5), the safety, PK, and PD profiles of single, ascending doses of 
olipudase alfa were evaluated. Single doses of 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0 mg/kg of olipudase alfa 
were in fused sequentially by [CONTACT_282141] 11 adult patients with ASMD. Study results found 
dose-related increases in ceramide, bilirubin, high -sensitivity C -reactive protein (hsCRP), and 
other acute phase reactants in patients that peaked 24 to 48 hours postdos e and resolved by 
[CONTACT_2006] 14.  Reported adverse events (AE s) involving constitutional symptoms (pain, fever, nausea, 
and vomiting) were consistent with first -dose-related toxicity and occurred in a dose -dependent 
fashion as was previously observed in the ASMKO mouse.  Serious adverse events (SAE s) related 
to olipudase alfa treatment we re not reported. The sponsor terminated the study subsequent to 
asingle patie nt dosed at 1.0 mg/kg of olipudase alfa presenting with hyperbilirubinemia and 
anacute -phase reaction (APR) with clinical symptoms. Of note, this patient was subsequently 
confirmed to have Gilbert’s syndrome. Because there were no other signs of liver tox icity or 
hemolysis, the observed hyperbilirubinemia may have been secondary to specific inhibition of 
bilirubin uptake into hepatocytes and/or glucuronide  conjugation of bilirubin within hepatocytes.
In a completed Phase 1b, open -label, multicenter ascendi ng-dose study in 5 adult patients with 
ASMD, the safety and tolerability of olipudase alfa were evaluated during a 26 -week treatment 
period ( 6). Patients received an initial IV dose of 0.1 mg/kg of olipudase alfa, then the dose was 
escalated in a stepwise manner to a final target IV dose of 3.0 mg/kg.  All patients remained at 
3.0mg/kg for the remainder of the treatment period. Upon completion of the study, all patients 
enrolled into an open -label, long -term treatment study. Results from this trial demonstrated that 
the progressive, within -patient olipudase alfa dose escalation re gimen was well tolerated in adult 
ASMD patients. No serious or sev ere AEs or deaths were reported in the study.  Related AEs 
consisted predominantly of infusion -associated reactions (IAR s), most of which were mild in 
severity with all patients recovering witho ut sequelae. At the end of the 6 -month treatment period, 
apositive response to treatment with olipudase alfa was observed in several individual efficacy 
parameters. This included mean decreases in spleen and liver volumes by 25.3% and 17.1%, 
respectively; decreased interstitial lung disease (ILD) scores; increased percent predicted diffusing 
capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DL CO); reduction in serum chitotriosid ase, chemokine

4.2 STUDY RATIONALE
Cumulative data from preclinical and human stud ies conducted to date with olipudase alfa 
demonstrate both the safety and tolerability of re peat dosing of olipudase alfa.  This study will 
provide long-term data on oli pudase alfa in pediatric and adult patients with ASMD.
This study is being conducted to allow patients with ASMD to continue the olipudase alfa 
treatment they were receiving at the end of th eir primary study after that study is completed. 
Individual dose adjustments are allowed in this study, but may also be recommended based on results from completed or ongoing studies of olipudase alfa. The primary objective of this study is to obtain safety data in pediatric and adult pa tients with ASMD who are exposed to long-term 
treatment with olipudase alfa. Secondary objecti ves are to obtain efficacy, PK, and PD data.
Treatment Period
x The current study is an open-label, long-term treatment study planned for 9 years, or until
olipudase alfa becomes commercially accessi ble (see maximum duration below), whichever 
comes first, unless the patient decides to enter an other olipudase alfa clinical trial within the 
9-year period prior to when olipuda se alfa is commercially accessible.
x The term “commercially accessible” is defined as when olipudase alfa is commercially 
accessible to each patient on an individual ba sis (eg, reimbursement being in place). The 
duration of study treatment with olipudase al fa between local Regulatory approval and 
commercial accessibility should not exceed [ADDRESS_344009] 3 years to comply with the agreed PIP. 
x The patient can switch immediately after the e nd of study treatment to commercial treatment 
without any gap in order to ensure conti nuity of treatment with olipudase alfa.

Patients experiencing symptoms suggestive of hy persensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic 
or anaphylactoid reactions, during olipudase alfa  infusion should be managed according to the 
general standards of care consistent with the trea tment of such reactions. If anaphylaxis or other 
severe allergic reactions occ ur, immediate discontinuation of the infusion should be considered, 
and appropriate medical treatment should be initia ted.  Because of the potential for severe IARs, 
appropriate medical personnel and equipment to perf orm resuscitation must be readily available in 
the event of a hypersensitivity reaction.

The physician's global assessment of the patient’s progress will be evaluated prior to infusion at 
the time points specified in the study flow chart in Section 1.1 through Section 1.5 .
The investigator will evaluate the patient’s current clinical status compared to baseline in the 
first study before the patient received the first dose of olipudase alfa by [CONTACT_112536] 1 of the following 7 categories: marked improvement, moderate improvement, mild improvement, no change, mild worsening, moderate worsening, or marked worsening.
9.3.2 Cognitive and adaptive function (for  pediatric patients who performed the 
assessments in the DFI13803 study)
Cognitive function will be evaluated using the DP -3 assessment tool.  Adaptive function will be 
evaluated using the ABAS. These assessments will be performed only for pediatric patients who performed the assessments in DFI13803.  Completi on of these assessments may depend on patient 
age or cooperation, or both.
Assessment time points are specified in Section 1.3 and Section 1.4 . Refer to the study operations 
manual for further details.
9.3.3 Cycle ergometry
Cycle ergometry will be performed at the time points specified in Section 1.1 .  Completion of the 
assessment may depend upon patient cooperation.
Cardiopulmonary status will be assessed using a stationary 1-wheeled cycle as an ergometer to 
measure a person's work output under controlled condi tions.  Patients will be asked to ride the 
cycle at increasing workload levels until they  can no longer proceed.  Patients will breathe 
through a tube connected to a 1-way valve for continuous measurements of oxygen (O 2) uptake, 
carbon dioxide (CO 2) output, and tidal volume throughout the test.  Heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], 
and digital O 2saturation will also be continuously monitored.  Steady-state levels for each 
workload will be calculated for O 2uptake, CO 2output, tidal volume, ventilation, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_63760].  The maximum workload achieved will be recorded and expressed as percent predicted.  In addition, percent predicted maximum will be calculated for O
2uptake, heart rate, 
and tidal volume. Note that cycle ergometry asse ssments must occur at the same time for each 
assessment (ie, ±[ADDRESS_344054] assessment).
Procedures for cycle ergometry assessments are detailed in the corresponding manual.

Source data includes all information in original records  and certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_2149], observations, or other activities  necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation 
of the trial.  Source data are contained in source documents.
Source documents are original documents, data and records (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and 
office charts, laboratory reports and notes, memoranda, patient diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_282117] a nd complete, microfiches, photographic negatives, 
microfilm or magnetic media, X-rays, patient files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medical-technical departments) involved in the clinical study. Source documentation must be maintained to  support information provided in the CRF.
All protocol-required information collected during th e study must be recorded by [CONTACT_282158]. The source documentation will be used to enter the protocol-required information into the CRF. No data should therefore be directly entered into the CRF.
10.4 HANDLING OF PATIENT TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT TREATMENT 
DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DISCONTINUATION
The IMP should be continued whenever possibl e. In case the IMP is stopped, it should be 
determined whether the stop can be made temporar ily; permanent IMP discontinuation should be 
a last resort.  Any IMP discontinuation should be fully documented in the source and CRF.  In any 
case, the patient should remain in the study as long as possible.
Pregnancy will lead to treatment discontinuation in  all cases.  Sexually active female patients of

the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/study site. If the site visit is not possible due to site closure or extenuating circumstances that prevent an in-person si te visit (eg, during COVID-19 pandemic), 
reintroduction may be done via home infusion. 
The investigator, in consultation with the sponsor, will determine whether the patient will be 
redosed.  Reintroducing patients to  olipudase alfa treatment will take into account the patient’s 
usual dose, the number of missed infusions, and the patient’s abi lity to tolerate the dose.
Upon reintroduction of treatment, certain asse ssments will be repeated at infusions 
(Section 8.1.5 ). The investigator will decide if additional specific assessments may be required 
before the patient can begin the reintroduction regimen.
Olipudase alfa reintroduction guidance is described in Section 8.1.1 . Reintroduction of olipudase 
alfa treatment will be done with appropriate monitoring at the discretion of the investigator and confirmation that the patient still meets the study criteria ( Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 ).
The duration of all temporary treatment discontinuati ons should be recorded by [CONTACT_282159].

Patients may withdraw from treatment at any time and irrespective of the reason.  The investigator 
may also decide to withdraw a patient from treatment.
Patients should discontinue the IMP for the following reasons:
xUnacceptable toxicity.
xThe need for intervention or therapy precl uded by [CONTACT_990], and determination by [CONTACT_206377].
xThe patient was unable to comply with the requirements of the protocol.
xThe patient wishes to be withdrawn from treatment.
xThe patient was erroneously included in the study (failed to satisfy all study criteria in

medical record.
10.4.5 Procedure and consequence fo r patient withdrawal from study
Patients may withdraw from the study before study c ompletion if they decide to do so, at any time 
and irrespective of the reason.  Preferably the patient should withdraw consent in writing and, if the patient refuses or is physically unavailable, the site should document and sign the reason for 
the patie nt’s failure to withdraw consent in writing.
The reason for withdrawal should be captured.  Patients who withdraw should be explicitly asked 
about the contribution of possible AEs to their decision to withdraw consent, and any AE 
information elicited should be documented.
Patients who withdraw should be asked to come back for the end of study visit and will receive 
the safety follow phone call.
For patients who fail to return to the site, the investigator should make th e best effort to contact 
[CONTACT_102] (eg, contact[CONTACT_12531]’s family or private physician, reviewing available registries or 
health care databases), and to determine his/her health  status, including at least his/her vital status.

10.5 OBLIGATION OF THE INVESTIGATOR REGARDING SAFETY REPORTING
The investigator is the primary person responsible for making all clinically relevant decisions on safety issues.
Any abnormal findings that meet the definition of an AE per Section 10.5.1 will be recorded on 
the CRF.  The investigator will continue to m onitor the patient until the parameter returns to 
baseline or until the investigator determines th at follow-up is no longer medically necessary.
All AEs (as described in Section 10.5.1 ) regardless of seriousness or relationship to study 
treatment will be collected from the time of wr itten informed consent until the patient completes 
participation in the study as defined in Section 6.3.1 .  Adverse events that started during the 
previous study which are ongoing at the time the patient signs the written informed consent should be reported in this study.
All SAEs (as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) and any AESI requiring immediate notification 
(as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 ) including those ongoing at the time of study completion) will 
be monitored until resolution, stabilization of the condition, or until it is mutually agreed upon by [CONTACT_282160].
If, at any time after the patient has completed participation in the study (as defined in 
Section 6.3.1 ), the investigator or study staff becomes aware of an SAE that they believe is 
possibly related or related to IMP, then the event and any known details should be reported promptly to the sponsor.  Follow the reporting instructions in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
All AEs diagnosed by [CONTACT_282161].  
Definitions for AEs, SAEs, AESI; and instructions  for AE monitoring and reporting, are provided 
inSection 10.5 through Section 10.8 . All AEs will be coded using the version of Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) currently in effect at the time of the considered database lock.
The investigator is responsible for reviewing and signing all laboratory reports. Any abnormal 
findings that meet the definition of an AE per Section 10.5.1 will be recorded on the CRF. The 
investigator will continue to monitor the patient until the parameter returns to baseline or until the 
investigator determines that follow-up is no longer medically necessary.

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical o ccurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
patient administered a pharmaceutical product an d which does not necessarily have to have 
a causal relationship with this treatment.
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious adverse event
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
xResults in death, or
xIs life-threatening ( Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers 
to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe), or
xRequires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or
xResults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or
xIs a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
xIs a medically important event.
Medical and scientific judgment should be exerci sed in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the patient or may require 
intervention (ie, specific measures or corrective treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes 
listed in the definition above.
Note: The following list of medically important events is intended to serve as a guideline for 
determining which conditions have to be consider ed as medically important events.  The list is not 
intended to be exhaustive:
xIntensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for:
- Allergic bronchospasm,- Blood dyscrasias (ie, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, bone marrow aplasia,

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event of special interest
An AESI is an AE (serious or nonserious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by [CONTACT_81516].  Such events may require further investigation inorder to characterize and understand them.  Adverse events of special interest may be added or 
removed during a study by [CONTACT_12548].  Reporting guidelines and follow-up instructions 
are provided below.
AESIs include pregnancy, IARs (hypersensitivity reactions, APRs, and CRSs).
[IP_ADDRESS].1Pregnancy
Pregnancy of a female patient entered in the study,  and pregnancy occurring in a female partner of 
a male patient entered in this study.  See Section [IP_ADDRESS] for details.
[IP_ADDRESS].2Infusion-associated reactions
Some AEs may be manifestations of IARs, including hypersensitivity reaction, APR, and CRS.  
However, original signs and symptoms must be reported as AEs.  In the CRF, investigators are 
asked to identify whether a specific AE represents a clinical manifestation of the IAR.
Infusion-associated reactions are defined as AEs that occur during the infusion or within up to 
24 hours after the start of infusion and are considered as related or possibly related to the studytreatment by [CONTACT_8893].  An event occurring ≥24hours after the start of 
an infusion may be judged an IAR at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor.  For this study of olipudase alfa, IARs may present as different types of reactions, such as hypersensitivity reactions, APRs, and CRS.
[IP_ADDRESS].2.1 Hypersensitivity reactions
Infusion-associated hypersensitivity reactions seen with other enzyme replacement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_282118]-mediated (IgG/IgE) and occur after sensitization. After subsequent 
exposure to the antigen typi[INVESTIGATOR_206331], a “sensitized” patient may 
experience a broad range of allergic reactions that can be mild to severe or life-threatening.  Anaphylaxis (or anaphylactic reaction) is a serious,  IgE mediated allergic reaction that is rapid in 
onset, and may cause death ( 22). Anaphylactoid, or non-immunologic anaphylaxis, reactions may 
present with similar serious clinical manifestations as anaphylaxis, but without prior exposure to the drug and are due to nonimmunologic-med iated mast cell degranulation.  Although 
mechanistically different, anaphylactic and an aphylactoid reactions are treated similarly.

include urticaria, rash, dyspnea, and less frequently, angioedema. Other symptoms of hypersensitivity IARs, APRs, and CRS include fever, hypotension, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, 
pain, and headache.
There were no IARs suggestive of hypersensitivity in the Phase 1b trial ( 6).
[IP_ADDRESS].2.2 Acute phase reactions
Acute phase reactions are considered a type of IAR.  Acute phase reactions were observed in the 
Phase 1 single-dose study ( 5) and the Phase 1b repeat-dose study ( 6) in 2 patients during dose 
escalation.  The patients successfully completed the trial.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], APRs occurred within 12 to
72 hours after olipudase alfa infusion and were in dicative of an inflammatory response as they 
were associated with elevations in hsCRP and changes acute phase reactants including, but not 
limited to, neutrophils, iron, ferritin, fibrinogen, D-dimer, transferrin, albumin, prothrombin time,and partial thromboplastin time. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_282119], but were not limited to, pyrexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and pain; and were concurrent with the changes in specific laboratory paramete rs. Accordingly, APRs will be  determined based on combined 
significant laboratory findings and clinical symptoms.
[IP_ADDRESS].2.[ADDRESS_344091] suggested the possibility of CRS.  There were no events characterized as cytokine 
release syndrome in either the Phase 1 single- or the Phase 1b repeat-dose trials with olipudase alfa ( 5,6). The Phase 1 single-dose study demonstrated increases in IL-8 and IL-6; macrophage 
inflammatory protein 1, alpha component (MIP- 1α); macrophage inflammatory protein 1, beta 
component (MIP- 1β); and other cytokines and biomarkers (based Myriad Rules -Based Medicine 
Human Multi-Analyte Profile
®antigen panel) after a single dose of ≥0.3 mg/kg of olipudase alfa 
(5). In the Phase 1b trial, increases in mean IL-[ADDRESS_344092] administrations of olipudase alfa at doses 0.6 mg/kg through 2.0 mg/kg and tended to be concurrent with acute phase responses ( 6). Unlike immunoglobulin-mediated hypersensitivity 
reactions, no prior antigen exposure is required for the development of CRS.  Symptoms of CRS develop soon after exposure, and range from mild  to severe.  Although CRS shares some 
symptoms with other IARs (ie, hypersensitivity reactions and APRs), symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_206332], nausea, vomiting, fatigue, pain, myalgia, and in severe cases, multiorgan system 
dysfunction or failure, severe headache, and pulmonary edema.  Cytokine release syndrome will 
be determined based on combined significant laboratory findings and clinical symptoms.
[IP_ADDRESS].3Symptomatic overdose (serious or nonserious) of study drug
An overdose (accidental or intentional) of study drug is defined as an increase of at least 30% of the dose to be administered in the specified duration or if the dose is administered in less than half

xAny increase in ALT or AST >3x the ULN combined with an increase in ALT or 
AST >2x baseline (prior to olipudase alfa ther apy) with symptoms of fatigue, nausea, 
vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, or eosinophilia (> ULN).
[IP_ADDRESS].5Other significant events
Any AE that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26335], raises significant concern regarding the safety of olipudase alfa at the administered dose will be considered an AESI.
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions for cr iteria of adverse events
[IP_ADDRESS].1Relationship to study treatment
Assessment of the association between the AE and study exposure is important for regulatory 
reporting.  This assessment is to be made in blinded studies and also for known comparators.  For each AE/SAE the investigator is to determine whether there is a reasonable possibility demonstrated by [CONTACT_206383] a causal relationship between the study treatment and the AE according to the categories below:
xNot related: There is no suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] a cau sal relationship between exposure and the AE.
xUnlikely related: There is no evidence for a causal relationship between exposure and the 
AE; however, such a relationship cannot be ruled out.
xPossibly related: There is some evidence supporting the possibility of a causal relationship 
between exposure and the AE.
xRelated: There is strong evidence that there is a causal relationship between exposure and 
the AE.
A relationship to the investigational product must be assigned for each AE/SAE recorded, even if 
there is only limited information at the time. The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_1095]-up information, amending the AE/SAE report accordingly.

Female patients will be instructed to notify the investigator immediately if they discover they are 
pregnant.  Pregnant female patients will be discontinued from the study.
Male patients will be instructed to notify the investigator immediately if they discover that their 
sexual partner is pregnant.
If the investigator learns of a report of pregnancy at any time after signing the informed consent, 
the investigator should follow the instructions in Section [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_344095] be fo llowed until the outcome of the pregnancy is 
known (ie, delivery, elective termination, or spontan eous abortion).  If the pregnancy results in the 
birth of a child, additional follow-up information may be requested.
The investigator will be asked to obtain follow-up information no later than 2 months after the 
gestational period to obtain maternal/fetal/neonatal outcome and any other relevant information.  
Follow-up information may be requested at additional time points.  All study-related visits/contacts involving a known pregnancy shou ld include pregnancy status assessment until 
pregnancy outcome is known.
Please note that pregnancy is an AESI, not an AE or SAE.  All information received will be 
assessed for any AEs and SAEs and processed per st udy guidelines.  If the patient is discontinued 
because of pregnancy, pregnancy will be documented as the reason for study discontinuation.  Spontaneous abortions and stillbirths are reported as SAEs.

The Protocol Amendment Summary of Changes Table for the current amendment is located 
directly before the Clinical Trial Summary.
17.2.1 Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 06 ( 29-Jan-2021 )
This amended protocol (0 6) is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in 
Article 10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the
European Union.
OVERALL RATIONALE FOR THE AMENDMENT
The primary reasons for this amendment are described below:
1. During a regional or national emergency declar ed by a governmental agency such as the 
COVID -[ADDRESS_344115] to additional options for monitoring 
techniques in compliance with applicable country -specific regulations.
2. During a regional or national emergency declar ed by a governmental agency such as the 
COVID -19 pandemic that can lead to site closure or e xtenuating circumstances that prevent an in -
person site visit, for the switch from Proc ess C( ) investigationa l medicinal product (IMP) to the 
updated manufacturing Process C( ) IMP, ad ding the possibility to perform the first infusion at 
home for eligible patients in agreement between the Sponsor and the Investigator and in 
compliance with applicable country -specific regulations. 
3. Liver function test (LFT) monitoring after infusion i s already included in this protocol. 
However, review of the interim data from th e clinical development program has identified 
"Transient elevation in transamina ses associated with ceramide release during the dose escalation 
phase with olipudase alfa" as an important identified risk. There fore, additional recommendations 
for the management of transaminase elevation during dose escalation have been added to the 
protocol. 
Other important changes include:
1. In the context of this long -term study, the assess ments have been streamlined to reduce patient 
burden. Assessments to ensure patient safety will be preserved. This change will be implemented

clinical trial protocol.  This change was made to adhere to 
[COMPANY_011] policy. 
17.2.4 Amended protocol 03  based on Protocol Amendment 03 (25 April 2018)
REASON FOR AMENDMENT:
1. Extend the study treatment period from 5 years to 9 years
In section(s): Clinical Trial Summary: Study Design, Duration of Study Period; 1 Study Flow 
charts (1.1 through 1.6 [former protocol amendment 2 sections 1.1 through 1.4]); 4.2 Study 
Rational; 6 Study Design; 6.1.1 Treatment Pe riod; 6.3 Duration of Study Participation
Rationale:
LTS13632 was set to follow patients rolling over from previous adult study (Phase 1b) and 
Pediatric study (Phase 1/2). The objective is to assess long term safety and efficacy for [ADDRESS_344139]. The treatment period will change from 5 years to 9 years to allow for better treatm ent options for patients at the end of treatment. 
It is also included in this change that if marketing approval was not available, extension of follow 
up beyond 9 years would be considered with sponsor’s approva l.
Specific schedules of assessment for both adults and children populations in this extension period 
have been proposed.
2. Remove a redundant exclusion criterion

Criteria); 7.2.2 Exclusion criteria related to the current knowledge of the compound and condition

Amended Clinical Trial Protocol No. 07 15-Apr-2022
LTS13632 - olipudase alfa Version number: 1
Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 160Rationale:
The exclusion criterion number E 06 states that “T he patient has an alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >250 IU/L or total bilirubin >1.5 mg/dL”.
However, patients enter the study by [CONTACT_282190] r from previous studies (adult Phase 1b and 
pediatric Phase 1/2) without any screening assess ment before rolling over after end of treatment of 
the previous study. 
Moreover, Liver Functions are strictly followed in previous studies and this extension study via 
Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) and Dose Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_282127] (DMC). 
Based on the above, EC 06 is redundant and this amendment proposes to remove.
3. Remove the option of another liver bi opsy after 5 years treatment in adult 
patients
In section(s): 1.1 Flow Chart for Adults; 9.1.12 Liver biopsy for sphingomyelin in liver tissue 
(only patients who previously participated in the DFI13412 study)Rationale:
In the current protocol (Protocol Amendment 2) it is indicated that an additional biopsy may take 
place at 5 years in the study, but only if necessary based on analysis of the 3 year biopsy for the group of adult patients.
The 3 year biopsy analysis of the adult patients did not show evidence suggestive of a progressive 
worsening of fibrosis to cirrhosis in patients treated with olipudase alfa. Hence it was decided that further biopsies after 5 years treatment is not needed.
4. Update the target number of patients to be approximately 25 instead of 17 
In section(s): Clinical Trial Summary: Total Expected Number of Patients; Statistical 
Considerations, sample Size Determination; 6 Study Design; 11.2 Determination of the Sample 
Size
Rationale:
All adult patients were recruited. This change serves to update the target number of patients 
according to Phase 1/2 pediatric (DFI13803) study amendment 4 (dated 21-Aug-2017), which 
plans to enroll approximately [ADDRESS_344140]

Amended Clinical Trial Protocol No. 07 15-Apr-2022
LTS13632 - olipudase alfa Version number: 1
Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 161Rationale:
Remove cycle ergometry in pediatric patients. The assessment has not provided any benefit to 
follow activities in children due to the difficult applicability and low compliance.
Remove Angiotensin Converting Enzyme measure ment in both adult and pediatric populations. 
The assessment does not provide any benefit to follow efficacy or safety.
6. Add option to conduct a future additional questionnaire about home infusion 
experience to patients who received home infusion treatment 
In section(s): 9.1.2 Secondary endpoints (e fficacy); [IP_ADDRESS] Additional questionnaires; 
10.2.1 Home infusions
Rationale:
This is a provision in the protocol of the option to conduct future additional short and one-time 
questionnaire about home infusion experience to pati ents who received home infusion treatment.
7. Add Differential liver DNA methylation densities of PPAR ɣgene promoter in 
plasma ccfDNA
In section(s): Clinical Trial Summary (End Points), (Other endpoints); 9.1.3 Other endpoints; 
9.3.10 Differential liver DNA methylation densities of PPAR ɣgene promoter in plasma
Rationale:
Differential liver DNA methylation of peroxis ome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 
(PPARɣ) gene promoter has recently been shown to stratify patients in terms of fibrosis severity. 
Plasma DNA methylation signatures reflect the mo lecular pathology associated with fibrosis liver 
disease. Remarkably, PPAR ɣhypermethylation correlated with progression to cirrhosis in 
alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and with specific stages of liver fibrosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). DNA methylation markers at the human PPAR ɣpromoter detectable in 
circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) display differential methylation densities and could potentially be used to non-invasively stratify liver fibrosis severity in patients with NAFLD.
(Hardy T, et al. Gut 2016;0:1-8. doi:10.1136/gutjnl-2016-311526 [downloaded Apr 11, 2016]  and 
Yi.it.B, et.al. Gut Epub ahead of print: doi:10.1136/ gutjnl-2017-315668 [downloaded Feb 26, 2018])
In order to assess this potential biomarker in ASMD patients, it would be clinically useful to 
compare the differential methylation densities of the adult patients participating in the LTS13632 study to base differential methylation densities while they were participating in the Phase 1b(DFI13412) study.
Whenever possible, and if enough volume of left-over plasma is available at all time points of 
interest, plasma samples that were obtained at th e same time of the liver biopsy performed at Year 
3 study visit will be used to assess ccfDNA differ ential methylation densities. These densities will

Phase 1b (DFI13412) study, to detect change in fibrosis differentiation using this biomarker. In this way, there will be no additional bl ood draws or procedures added to the protocol.
8. Clarify language of collection of blood samples (beyond 5 years) and 
pharmacokinetics sample and analysis
In section(s): 1.6 (former protocol amendment 2 section 1.4) Study Flowchart: Pharmacokinetic 
sampling; 9.3.8 Pharmacokinetics; [IP_ADDRESS].1 Sampling time in adults; [IP_ADDRESS].1 Sampling time in 
pediatric patients; 9.5 Sampled Blood Volume
Rationale:
Clarify and update language to address stud y extension and clarify other procedures.
9. Clarify reporting guidelines of Adverse Events of Special Interest

17.2.5 Amended protocol 02 based on Prot ocol Amendment 02 (25 April 2017)
REASON FOR AMENDMENT:
1. Change in assessments that will not be repeated at end of study/early discontinuation

In section(s): 1.1, 1.3
Rationale:
Correction of error in previous section.
2. Dose calculation based on weight in site and home infusion visits
In section(s): 1.1, 1.2, 1.3
Rationale:
Weight change between visits is insignificant, therefore dose calculation using weight from 
previous site visit is allowed. In home infusion visit, the last weight taken on site will be used.

17.2.6 Amended protocol 01  based on Protocol Amendment 01 (23 March 2016)
REASON FOR AMENDMENT:
Changes listed in this section are regarded as “substantial” because they have a significant impact 
on:
xThe safety or physical or mental integrity of the patients,
xThe scientific values of the trial; or,
xThe conduct or management of the trial.
1.Change expected number of patients from “65 -70 patients” to “up to 17 pat ients.
In sections: Clinical trial summary (Study population, Total expected number of 
patients), 6.Rationale: This trial allows current patients to continue treatment.  Based on the number of 
patients in this trial and the DFI13803 pediatric trial, the maximum number of patients is 
already known to be 17.
2. Provide option for home infusions.
In sections: Clinical trial summary (Dose regimen), 8.1.1, 10.2.
Rationale: Patients are on stable doses that th ey have been tolerating well.  This provision 
eases the travel and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_282129].

Amended Clinical Trial Protocol No. 07 15-Apr-2022
LTS13632 - olipudase alfa Version number: 1
Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 1653.Provide specific guidelines on treatment “r eintroduction” defined as management of 
patients who have missed 1 or more olipudase alfa doses.
In sections: Clinical trial summary (Dose regimen), 8.1.1, 8.1.5.
Rationale: Issue was not addressed in previous version.
4. Remove the requirement that the sponso r must be consulted to determine the 
appropriate dose of olipudase alfa for dose  adjustments or if a patient misses 1 or 
more doses.
In section: Clinical trial summary (Dose regimen), 8.1.1, 8.1.4.
Rationale: Guidance on how to restart treatmen t when patients have missed consecutive 
doses is provided in Section 8.1.1 of the protocol.
5. Remove continuous heart rate monitoring as an endpoint.
In sections: Clinical trial summary (Endpoints,  Primary endpoints, Data pertaining to the 
safety and tolerability of olipudase alfa), 1.1, 9.1.1, 9.2.
Rationale: Patients in the LTS13632 trial have  all completed the dose escalation regimen. 
As such, they are outside the period where fluc tuations of ceramide could lead to more 
severe adverse events. The results of conti nuous ECG monitoring to date from studies 
DFI13412 and LTS13412 have not revealed any cl inically significant changes. Moreover, 
enzyme therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], as a class effect, are not known to detrimentally effect cardiac function. 
As such, continuous ECG monitoring was removed.
6. Add these endpoints.
In sections: Clinical trial summary (Endpoints,  Primary endpoints, Data pertaining to the 
safety and tolerability of oli pudase alfa), 9.1, [IP_ADDRESS], [IP_ADDRESS], 9.2.7, 9.2.8, 9.2.9, 9.3, 9.3.7, 
9.3.8, 9.3.9, 9.4.2, 9.4.7, [IP_ADDRESS].
xPrimary:
-Extended neurologic examinations in adults and pediatric patients,
-Doppler echocardiography,
-Liver biopsy (original adult patients),
-Liver ultrasound with Doppler (pediatric patients).
xSecondary:
-Hand X-ray for bone age and bone maturation (pediatric patients),
-Tanner staging (pediatric patients),
-Linear patient growth by [CONTACT_201098] Z--score (pediatric patients).
xOther endpoints:
-Cognitive and adaptive function (pediatric patients only, until age 6 years),
-Bone biomarkers,

Amended Clinical Trial Protocol No. 07 15-Apr-2022
LTS13632 - olipudase alfa Version number: 1
Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 166-Photographs (optional).
Rationale: These are relevant clin ical endpoints for pediatric patients entering the trial, 
which were part of the primary pediatric study, and for continued evaluation of adult 
patients (eg, liver biopsy).
7.Specify that, “The term ‘pediatric patients only’ means pat ients coming from the 
original pediatric trial, DFI13803.  Some of  these patients will reach adult age 
[18 years old] while in this study.  They wi ll continue the assessments schedule they 
were on in the original trial.  These patients will be adults by [CONTACT_654], but they will remain part of the “pediatric patient” co hort.” They will not follow the adult 
procedures in this study (eg, liver biopsy).
In sections: Clinical trial summary (Assessment schedule), 1.1, 9, [IP_ADDRESS].
Rationale: Pediatric patients will not have some baseline assessments for comparison 
(eg, liver biopsy, DXA of femurs and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]).  This statement is intended to clarify to site 
personnel which assessments pertain to adults and which to pediatric patients.
8. Add that for patients who mi ssed 3 infusions or more in fusions between trials, some 
assessments may be repeated at study entry after discussion between the sponsor and 
the investigator.
In sections: Clinical trial summary (Assessment schedule), 1.1.
Rationale: Since the rate at which sphingomyelin reaccumulates when olipudase alfa is 
interrupted, it may be necessary to repeat some efficacy assessments in case of prolonged 
investigational product suspension.
9.Add: “If a patient has missed 3 or more doses ≥0.6 mg/kg, reintroduction of 
olipudase alfa for patients receiving infusions at home should occur at the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/study site.  If a patient misses 2 or fewer doses, the investigator can decide 
whether reintroduction for patients receiv ing infusions at home should occur at the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/study site.”
In sections: Clinical trial summary (Dose regimen), 1.1, 8.1.1, 8.1.5.
Rationale: To ensure patient’s safety.
10. Add assessments for patients who require dose reintroduction.
xPatients who require dose reintroduction  will have these assessments at each 
infusion until reaching their usual dose of olipudase alfa:
-Before infusion: vital signs, liver function tests, hematology, ECG, and safety 
biomarkers,
-Immediately after infusion: vital signs and ECG,
-24 hours: vital signs, liver function tests, and safety biomarkers,

Amended Clinical Trial Protocol No. 07 15-Apr-2022
LTS13632 - olipudase alfa Version number: 1
Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 167-48 hours: vital signs, liver function tests, hematology, ECG, and safety 
biomarkers.
In sections: Clinical trial summary (Assessment schedule), 1.1, 8.1.5.
Rationale: To monitor patient safety during reintroduction.
11. Add that PK testing will only occur yearly and upon the introduction of a new 
manufacturing scale.
In sections: 1.2, 9.4.8.
Rationale: Provide appropriate and continuous monitoring, in particular for manufacturing 
scale changes.
12. Add that for a new manufacturing scale, if treatment is not interrupted, PK sample 
collection will take place at the patient’s last infusion under the current manufacturing scale and at the first infusion under the new manufacturing scale.
In sections: 1.1, 1.2, 9.4.8.
Rationale: To provide patients’ data on drug comparability.
13. Add that if a manufacturing scale change occurs, immune response assessments will 
be monthly for the first 6 months after starting the new scale, and quarterly after that.
In sections: 1.1, 1.2, 9.4.8.
Rationale: Per FDA request.
14. Add that in case reintroduction of olipudase alfa coincides with a manufacturing 
scale change, PK samples will be collecte d at the infusion at which patients receive 
their usual dose of olipudase alfa under the new manufacturing scale. 
In sections: 1.2, 9.3.8.
Rationale: To provide patients’ data on drug comparability.
15. Added PK sampling times, number of samples, and parameters in adults and 
pediatric patients.
In sections: 1.2, [IP_ADDRESS].
Rationale: Clarify the number of samples for a dults and pediatric patients and when they 
will be obtained.
16. Added PK sampling time point at 96 hours for adults and pediatric patients.
In section: 1.2.

Amended Clinical Trial Protocol No. 07 15-Apr-2022
LTS13632 - olipudase alfa Version number: 1
Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 168Rationale: Allow comparison of PK in adults and pediatric patients.
17. Added PK total blood volumes for pediatric patients.
In sections: 1.2, 9.5.
Rationale: Specify maximum blood volume f or blood samples per health authority 
requirement.
18. Add that the patients must be willing and able to avoid certain medications and 
herbal supplements for 10 days before and 3 days after liver biopsies.
In sections: 7.2.1, 8.6.
Rationale: Decrease the risk of bleeding from liver biopsies and to avoid liver toxicity.
19. Clarify patient stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418].
In section: 8.1.7
Rationale: The role of the DMC in an emergenc y is to review safety data and recommend
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_282130].  However, this does not limit the 
ability of investigators to make an immediate decision to discontinue dosing in an individual patient due to any AE that raises significant concern regarding the safety of olipudase alfa, as described in Section 8.1.6 of the protocol.
20. Remove O
2saturation from vital signs.
In section: 9.2.4.
Rationale: As part of this amendment to the protocol, dose escalation is not part of the 
trial.  Patients are on stable doses, and therefore monitoring without measuring 
O2 saturation is appropriate.
21. Change safety biomarker test from multiplex immunoassay to specific biomarkers 
including, but not limited to, hsCRP, iron, ferr itin, cardiac tropon in I, IL-6, IL-8,
plasma ceramide and calcitonin.
In sections: 9.2.5, 9.2.10.
Rationale: Given current know ledge about the study drug, broad immunoassay can be 
replaced by [CONTACT_282187].
22.Change the definition of overdose from “at least twice the intended dose within the 
intended therapeutic interval” to “an increa se of at least 30% of the dose to be 
administered in the specified duration, or if  the dose is administered in less than half 
the recommended duration of administration.”
In section: [IP_ADDRESS].1.
Rationale: To align with the investig ator brochure and the [COMPANY_011] template

Comparing Effectiveness of CSE Versus DPE for Labor Analgesia  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] 
3/22/2024
After obtaining written informed consent, parturients are randomis ed in a 1:1 ratio by [CONTACT_22123]-
generated random sequence to CSE or DPE arms , stratified by [CONTACT_147681] (nulliparous versus 
multiparous)  and class of obesity (BMI <40 vs. 40-50 kg .m-2). Allocation is  concealed in sequentially 
numbered opaque envelopes. Patients, obstetricians, nurses, and anesthesia providers involved in 
follow -up of labou r analgesia and data collection are blinded to group allocation. The an esthesia 
provider placing the neuraxial block and the supervising attending anesthesiologist  are not involved 
in data collection or in follow up of labo ur analgesia .  
 
Before neuraxial placement, all patients  have  an intravenous catheter placed with automated non -
invasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry, and external tocodynamometry monitors applied . All 
women receive  a [ADDRESS_245316] s of intrathecal 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 2  mg (0.8  ml) and 10  μg (0.2 ml) 
fentanyl in the CSE group . Subsequently, the spi[INVESTIGATOR_205711] 
(19-gauge Duraflex wire -reinforced multiport catheter (Smith Medical, [LOCATION_003] )) is advanced 5 cm into 
the epi[INVESTIGATOR_205712] , using Tegaderm 
clear occlusive dressing (3M, [LOCATION_003]) . In the DPE group, after confirmation of free flow of CSF , the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_205713] [ADDRESS_245317] s of 20 ml of 0.1% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_205714] 2 μg.ml-1 (premixed) administered in divided do ses of 5 ml every 2 min. In both groups, 
analgesia is  maintained using programmed intermitte nt epi[INVESTIGATOR_205715] 8 ml of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 
0.1% with fentanyl 2 μg.ml-1 every 45 min starting 30 min after the initial spi[INVESTIGATOR_205716], with patient -controlled epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187] (PCEA)  of 10  ml, a lockout of 10 min and maximum 
dose of 50 ml per hour . 
 
If analgesia is inadequate (defined as a patient request for supplemental analgesia beyond self -
administered PCEA boluses), an an esthesia provider blinded to group assignment assesse s and, if 
warranted, administer s top-up doses according to a predefined algorithm .  
 
The e nd time of administration of the loading dose (end of spi[INVESTIGATOR_205717]) is designated time 0 (t = 0) . A blinded 
investigator collect s data at 15 and 30 min and subsequently at 2- h intervals from time zero until 
delivery. Analgesia is evaluated at all time points using the verbal numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) 
for the last contraction (0=no pai n, 10=worst possible pain) . The upper and lower s ensory levels are 
evaluated at 15 and 30 min using temperature discrimination to ice. M otor blockade is  assessed at 
all time points using the modified Bromage score.  
 
The following additional data are recorded every 2 h until delivery: presence of p ruritus ; nausea;  
hypotension (defined as systolic blood pressure ≤ 20% from the patient ’s admission  blood 
pressure) ; need for physician top -up; catheter adjustment and catheter replacement. We also 
assess  for the presence of asymmetric blockade , defined as a difference > [ADDRESS_245318] uterine contraction and fetal heart rate  monitoring patterns in 10 -min epochs, for 1 h 
before and 1 h after the initial spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304] (CSE group) or epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873] (DPE group) dosing . On the ﬁrst 
postpartum day, we assessed for postdural puncture headache and satisfaction with labo ur 
analgesia (0 -10, 0= very dissatisﬁed, 10=very satisﬁed)  
 The primary outcome of th e study is the quality of labo ur analgesia , which is defined by a 
composite of five components: asymmetric block after 30 min of initiation (difference in sensory 
level of more than two dermatomes) ; epi[INVESTIGATOR_205718]-up interventions ; catheter adjustment ; catheter  
replacement ; failed conversion to neuraxial an esthesia for c esarean delivery , requiring general 
anesthesia or replacement of the neuraxial block.  
 
Secondary outcomes  include : pain scores ; Bromage scores ; sensory levels at 15 and 30 min ; 
adverse events (hypotension, nausea, pruritus, postdural puncture headache , fetal heart rate  
changes) ; duration of second stage of labo r; mode of delivery ; total an esthetic dose ; PCEA use ; and  
overall satisfaction with analgesia.  
 
Based on the study by [CONTACT_205719]  a sample size of 50 patients per group had an 80% power at alpha 
0.[ADDRESS_245319] a reduction in the composite primary outcome from 50% in the CSE group to 22.5 % 
in the DPE group. To account for dropouts, we aim  to enrol  up to [ADDRESS_245320] 
complete data on 100 subjects.  
 
Descriptive statistics for patient characteristics and outcomes are calculated and reported as 
median (IQR [range ]) or number ( proportion ) as appropriate. The primary composite outcome is 
compared between exposure groups using a chi -squared test and an ekect size is reported as a 
risk ratio.  Secondary outcomes are assessed using chi-squared or Fisher exact tests  as 
appropriate,  with associated risk ratios for categorical measures and univariate log -linear 
regression with mean ratios for continuous measures. All p values for the secondary outcomes are 
adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni -Holm method to control family -wise error 
rate and adjusted p values are reported.  Only p  values and adjusted p values < 0.05 are considered 
statistically signiﬁcant. Analysis is performed using R  version  4.3.1, with the power calculation 
performed using NQuery.

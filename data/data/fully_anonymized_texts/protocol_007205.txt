Statistical Analyses:  
 
We will use a DID approach1,[ADDRESS_608111] of the E4 transition via changes in outcomes.  Time will be anchored at the month 
prior to the transition  (e.g., index time is set to the month prior to the transition) for the E4 group. Each 
of the E4 transition members will be matched to two controls via propensity score methods. Non -E4 
transition members will be  assigned to an index date corresponding to their E4 transition match. We will 
not adjust for the matching in  our models3.   
To match controls to E4 members, we will mode l the propensity score based on covariates we believe 
may be related to exposure: Gender, ACS Population Size, ACS Household Income in past 12 months, 
ACS Percent 25 years and older with a Bachel or's degree, ACS Percent White, and Year of birth. Then, we 
will obtain the log odds (logit) of the fitted values (e.g., estimates) of the propensity score for everyone 
(both E4 and possible controls) and order the log odds of the treatment (E4) group from  largest to 
smallest (in decreasing order). For each E4 member, we will find  the two nearest neighbor controls, e.g., 
the controls with the closest propensity score to that of the E4 individual with 12 months of continuous 
prior enrollment at the E4 individual's index date. After completing matching, we  will check for covariate 
balance across groups based on the standardized mean differences and Kolmogorov –Smirnov statistic .  
 
To address the zero -inflated and right skewed nature of the outcomes, we will use a two part -model. In 
the first stage of the two -part model, we will estimat e the probability of the response being greater than 
zero and in the second stage we will model the non -zero portion. We will choose the most appropriate 
mean -variance relationship by [CONTACT_474545] -of-fit tests (Pearson’s correlation, Pregibon link, 
modified Park, and modified Hosmer -Lemeshow tests)4,5 on the outcome s. We will assume  
independence in the mean modeling to estimate the area under the curve change at 1 (primary), [ADDRESS_608112] errors that account for repeated 
measurements within an individual (clustering on the individual level) . We will adjust for individual -level 
(age, gender, and Elixhauser comorbidity score) and census ZIP -code level characteristics (educational 
attainment, median household income, race/ethnicity and urban residence) in all models.  
 
Model:  
 
Denote spending for member i at time t as 𝑦𝑖𝑡, with 𝑖∈{1,…,𝑁}, 𝑡∈{− 23,…,0,…,36}, and N the

Model:  
 
Denote spending for member i at time t as 𝑦𝑖𝑡, with 𝑖∈{1,…,𝑁}, 𝑡∈{− 23,…,0,…,36}, and N the 
number of members. Let M be the number of covariates included in the model and 𝑥𝑚,𝑖𝑡 denote the 
𝑚thcovariate for member i at month t. 
 
Then the two -stage model is:  
𝑝𝑖𝑡∼𝐵𝑒𝑟𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑙𝑙𝑖  (𝜃𝑖𝑡), 
logit (𝜃𝑖𝑡)=𝛼0+ ∑ 𝛼𝑚𝑀
𝑚=1𝑥𝑚,𝑖𝑡,  
(𝑦𝑖𝑡 | 𝑦𝑖𝑡>0)∼𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑜𝑛  (𝜇𝑖𝑡), and 
𝜇𝑖𝑡= 𝐸(𝑦𝑖𝑡 | 𝑦𝑖𝑡>0,𝑋𝑖), 
where  𝑋𝑖 is the matrix for all observed covariates for member i. We model the mean, 𝜇𝑖𝑡, as 
log (𝜇𝑖𝑡)=𝛽0+ ∑ 𝛽𝑚𝑀
𝑚=1𝑥𝑚,𝑖𝑡.

1.0 Background  
 
Catacholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmia syndrome 
characterized by [CONTACT_14759] -induced ventricular arrhythmias in patients with s tructurally normal hearts. It is 
associated with a high rate of sudden cardiac death in affected patients and has  a prevalence  in the general 
population of ~1:10,000. It is caused by [CONTACT_620023] (SR) calcium release channel (RyR2) or RyR2 -binding proteins 
(Casq2, triadin, calmodulin). Exercise causes ventricular ectopy by [CONTACT_620024] -adrenergic stimulation  and therefore enhanced Ca leak via the RyR2 
channels. Diastolic calcium leak causes delayed after depolarizations (DADs), which are a common mechanism 
for fatal ventricular arrhythmias.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_824604]  breakthrough 
arrhythmias on beta -blocker therapy may also undergo placement of an implantable  cardioverter  defibrillator 
(ICD), but ICD’s do not provide complete protection against sudden cardiac death in CPVT patients due to the 
potential for fatal ICD s torm (repeated ICDs shocks due to recurrent ventricular arrhythmias) . Taken together, 
current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_620006] d. 
 
Recently, experimental evidence from mouse models of CPVT have demonstrated that mutations 
causing RyR2 dysfunction also promote sinus node dysfunction in the form of resting sinus bradycardia and/or 
chronotropic incompetence (an inappropriately slow s inus node rate during peak exercise). This finding is 
supported by [CONTACT_620025]. While it m ay seem that a slow heart rate would be  protective 
for patients with CPVT because they have an exerci se-induced arrhythmia, we present evidence  below (section 
3.0) from mouse models and human observations to support the idea that a slow sinus node rate during 
exercise (when catecholamine levels are high) creates an unfavorably long diastolic interval that promote s 
occurrence of DADs.  By [CONTACT_620026], the diastolic interval can be shortened 
which has been found to reduce the occurrence of DADs (and ventricular ectopy) in mice. Therefore, we aim 
to test the following hypothesis in humans:  
 
Specific Aim : To test the  hypothesis that increas ing the sinus node rate with atropi[INVESTIGATOR_620007] -triggered ventricular ectopy 
compared to baseline in patients with CPVT.  
 
 
3.[ADDRESS_824605], peak exercise (although decreased), and recovery.  In the second study, researchers evaluated 
parasympathetic effects on cardiac electrophysiology  during rest, exercise, and recovery using NIPS and 
atropi[INVESTIGATOR_105683] [ADDRESS_824606] SA or AV node (preferably both), and a dual chamber 
device (ICD or PM). Through a series of four sessions, a significant parasympathetic effect on si nus cycle 
Protocol Version  #: 7  4 
Protocol Date:  6/28/[ADDRESS_824607] study, parasympat hetic effects were evaluated in 5 patients with LV dysfunction (EF 30 -40%) and 
dual chamber devices (ICD or PM) capable of NIPS. The study design was similar to the second, and the 
results showed that parasympathetic effects on sinus cycle length and AV bl ock are measurable during 
exercise and recovery. Heart disease and ventricular dysfunction decreased the parasympathetic effect on 
ventricular refractoriness during exercise and recovery compared to normal controls. Thus, it was concluded 
that parasympathe tic tone does persist through exercise and recovery, and diminished parasympathetic effect 
on ventricular refractoriness during exercise and recovery may be responsible for the increased risk of sudden 
death noted during exercise and recovery.  [1,2] 
 
More recent studies by [CONTACT_620027]. suggest that decreased parasympathetic tone and accelerated 
sinus rhythm may prevent CPVT in both mice and patients. In order to test the hypothesis that CPVT is 
suppressed by [CONTACT_620028], in a randomized crossover design, two CPVT mouse 
models (Casq2 -/- and RyR2R4496 +/-) underwent pretreatment with either distilled water or atropi[INVESTIGATOR_620008]. Of the Casq2 -/- mice, 86% had significantly reduced ventric ular 
arrhythmia when treated with atropi[INVESTIGATOR_620009]. The hypothesis was 
again tested using atrial overdrive pacing instead of atropi[INVESTIGATOR_620010] (ISO for Casq2 -
/- mice, ISO + caffeine in RyR2R4496  +/-mice).The atrial pacing was set to match the peak sinus rate with 
catecholamine challenge alone.  Atrial overdrive pacing completely prevented ventricular arrhythmia in 84% of 
Casq2 -/- mice and 88% of RyR2R4496 +/- mice during catecholamine challenge  with ventricular premature 
beats significantly reduced in both.  In single myocyte studies, ventricular myocytes isolated from Casq2 -/- 
mice were loaded with FURa -2 AM for intracellular calcium measurements. Myocytes were then stimulated at 
increasing pa cing rates after addin ISO. Higher pacing frequencies reduced the diastolic interval and 
progressively reduced the incidence of SCWs. [3] 
 
Finally, a CPVT registry of patients with RyR2 mutation was screened for antiarrhythmic -naïve individuals 
who underwe nt exercise stress testing.  Of the 42 drug -naïve patients with ventricular arrhythmia on exercise 
testing, 18 patients reached 85% of maximum predicted HR during exercise testing and exercised beyond 
onset of ventricular arrhythmia. These patients were in cluded in the study. All 18 patients in the analysis 
developed ventricular arrhythmia by a heart rate 87% of maximum predicted heart rate. In 6 of the 18 
patients, ventricular arrhythmia subsided as the sinus HR reached 89 -99% of maximum predicted HR. This  
suggests that in a portion of CPVT patients, ventricular arrhythmia is suppressed with increasing sinus 
tachycardia. These studies suggest that in patients with CPVT, ventricular arrhythmia may be paradoxically 
suppressed by [CONTACT_393987]. [3,4]

6.0 Study Procedures  
 
General Approach: This is a prospec tive cross -over trial that will enroll eligible patients with CPVT and 
perform a baseline treadmill exercise tolerance test (ETT) followed by a repeat treadmill ETT with I.V. atropi[INVESTIGATOR_620014]. Atropi[INVESTIGATOR_53553] a parasympatheti c blocker and results in sinus 
tachycardia, which is expected to reduce the diastolic interval thereby [CONTACT_620029]. Both ETTs will be performed on the same day with two hours  of 
rest sc heduled between ETTs. The primary analysis will be a paired comparison of  the number of ventricular 
ectopic beats record ed during exercise (and recovery ) at baseline and following pre -treatment with atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  
Secondary endpoints will include the presence o f ventricular ectopy (yes/no), complex ventricular ectop y 
(couplets or greater, yes/no), and the number of runs of complex ventricular ectopy.

End of 
Study   
+4:[ADDRESS_824613]  (ETT ) 
 
The ETT protocol is adapted from the clinical protocol used at the Vanderbilt Heart and Vascular 
Institute . The participant will be asked to not eat or drink for 4 hours prior to each session, except for a small 
amount of water used to take necessary me ds. He/she will be instructed to take all medication as prescribed 
prior to the test. Participants will be instructed to wear clothing and shoes appropriate for exercising on a 
treadmill . An IV will be placed in order to deliver me dication during the testi ng. For a patient with an ICD, the  
patient’s ICD will be interrogated, and reprogrammed if necessary. Electrodes will be placed for ETT.  
 
The patient will be instructed to stand on the treadmill, and will be asked to begin walking on the 
treadmill using B ruce protocol.  The patient will be encouraged to maintain a minimum heart rate of 85% of 
his/her age predicted maximum. He/She will be encouraged to walk/run until the end of their comfort zone 
unless the supervising professional terminates the test befor e then. The exercise portion of the study is 
planned to last a maximum of 21 minutes per session.  The two sessions will be separated by a 20 minute 
Protocol Version  #: 7  7 
Protocol Date:  6/28/[ADDRESS_824614] period where the patient will be asked to rem ain 
at the CRC. After the second exercise session, a 4+ hour observation period will begin. For a patient with an 
ICD, a ny changes to ICD settings will be reprogrammed to previous settings. The patient will be disconnected 
from monitors and electrodes, and  the peripheral IV will be removed. In total, the total time commitment is 
approximately [ADDRESS_824615] under the following circumstances:  
- Inability to exercise  
- Marked exercise -induced hypotension  (Decrease in Systolic Blood Pressure >10 mmHg despi[INVESTIGATOR_620015])  
- Hypertensive response  (Systolic Blood Pressure >230 mmHg and/or Diastolic Blood Pressure > 115 
mmHg).  
- Sustained ventricular tachycardia  
- Development of LBBB or intraventricular conduction delay that cannot be distinguished from ventricular 
tachycardia  
- ST segment depression > [ADDRESS_824616] elevation >1 mm in leads without diagnostic Q waves (except  
leads V1 or aVR)  
- Moderate to severe angina pectoris  
- Marked dyspnea or fatigue  
- Ataxia, dizziness, or near syncope  
- Signs of poor perfusion  
- Technical difficulties in monitoring the ECG or systolic blood pressure  
 
 
At the end of the exercise protocol, the rec overy phase will begin. The first phase of recovery is a cool -
down phase with the patient walking on the treadmill. The patient will be stopped after 2 minutes, and the 
patient will be asked to lay supi[INVESTIGATOR_620016].  
 
Blood p ressure, HR, and EKG tracings will be recorded throughout the exercise and recovery period, with 
patient either walking/running or laying in supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].  
 
Each patient will be tested individually. There will be no videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_620017].  
 
 
7.0 Risks  
 
The primary endpoint of our study is measurement of ventricular arrhythmias (ectopy). This is an 
expected outcome of our exercise protocol. Risk of adverse clinical consequences of increased ventricular 
arrhythmias will be reduced by [CONTACT_620031] ’s medical therapy of AV nodal blockers (Beta -
blockers or calcium channel blockers).  Patients  with CPVT frequently undergo exercise stress testing as part of 
routine monitoring. All patients included in our study have successfully complet ed a min imum of two  exercise 
stress tests with no adverse events. Unexpected findings are cardiac arrest, ICD shock, or death and other 
unanticipated risks could exist.  
 
Risks associated with Atropi[INVESTIGATOR_620018], however, based on our preliminary data we 
expect a tropi[INVESTIGATOR_620019]. To manage the risk of 
proarrhythmia, participants will be observed with continuous cardiac monitoring for 20 minutes following ETT, 
or until ventricular ectopy has re turned to baseline (whichever is longer).

Protocol Date:  6/28/2016  8.0 Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problems involving Risk to Participants or 
Others  
 
Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problems involving Risk to Participants or Others : 
 
Definitions of ad verse events: an adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient 
or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with the treatment or study protocol.  
 
Adverse events include:  
o Worsening (change in nature, severity or frequency) of conditions present at the onset of the trial  
o Patient / subject deterioration due to the primary illness  
o Intercurrent illnesses  
o Drug interactions  
o Events related or possibly related to concomitant medications  
o Abnormal laboratory values or changes of vital signs, as well as significant shifts from baseline within  
the range of normal, which the Investigator considers clinically significant.  
 
Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction: an unexpect ed Adverse Drug Reaction is an adverse reaction, the  
nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product information. Definitions of serious 
adverse events or serious adverse drug reaction: during clinical investigations, adverse even ts may occur 
which, if suspected to be drug -related (adverse drug reactions), must be significant enough to lead to important 
changes in the way the medicinal product is developed (e.g., change in dose, population, needed monitoring, 
consent forms). This i s particularly true for reactions, which, in their most severe forms, threaten life or 
function.  
 
A serious adverse event/experience (SAE) or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
 
1. results in death  
2. is life -threatening  
3. requires inpatient hospit alization or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
4. results in persistent or significant disability/ incapacity (as per reporter’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649])  
5. is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
6. is another medically important condition  
7. The term "life -threatening" in the d efinition of "serious" refers to an event in which the patient is at risk 
of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused 
death  if it were more severe.  
 
Important medical conditions that may not resul t in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_620020], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or 
may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition above. Examples of such events 
are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
Definition of severity of a dverse events:  
 
Mild:   Causing no limitation of usual activities; the subject / patient may experience slight discomfort.  
 
Moderate:  Causing some limitation of usual activities; the subject / patient may experience annoying 
discomfort.  
 
Severe:  Causing i nability to carry out usual activities; the subject / patient may experience intolerable 
comfort or pain.  
 
Protocol Version  #: 7  9 
Protocol Date:  6/28/2016  Definition of adverse event causality:  
 
The Investigator will determine causality of each adverse event by [CONTACT_593812]: 
unlikel y, likely, or not assessable.  
 
Unlikely:  The AE is considered by [CONTACT_404854] a pre -existing condition, a known 
manifestation of the target disease, a recurrent condition, or is likely explained by [CONTACT_620032] f actors or was pre -existing and did not deteriorate.  
 
Likely:  The AE occurred during or after administration of the study treatment or a pre -existing event 
worsened within an appropriate period of time, and at least one of the following criteria is 
applicab le:  
o the event could not be explained by [CONTACT_404856], 
environmental or  toxic factors, or other diagnostic or therapeutic measure;  
o was an expected ADR associated with study treatment or a class -labeled drug effect;  
o AE su bsided or disappeared after withdrawal or dose reduction of study treatment; or  
o AE recurred after re -exposure to study treatment.  
 
Not assessable:  There is insufficient or conflicting evidence for classifying the causality of the AE as likely or 
unlikely. Lack of information may apply for this situation.  
 
Note: AEs with causality 'likely' or 'not assessable' are considered to be 'possibly drug -related.'  
 
Adverse event reporting  
 
Any adverse events (AEs) will be reported  to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] 72 hours of notifica tion of the  event. The PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_620021]. Any unanticipated problems involving risk to the participants or 
others will be discussed with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_32397]. Non-serious AEs and incidences of noncompliance with the 
protocol will  be reported to the IRB at the time of annual review.  
 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be reported according to the following procedure:  
 
The occurrence of serious adverse events will be reported to the Investigator within [ADDRESS_824617] 
within 7 days of the Investigator’s notification  of the event.  
 
In an unanticipated event of prolonged side effect, requiring prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], p atients will 
be retained in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_593795]. For minor side effects, where inpatient care is 
deemed  unnecessary, follow - up will be maintained via phone or as outpatient if necessary. Patient and their 
families  will be given the PI’s contact [CONTACT_593814].  
 
Any new ly discovered  information which may affect the subject or their caregiver’s decision to continue 
to participate in the study will be  passed on to them as soon  as possible. This may also result in a change to 
the consent form and review by  [CONTACT_1201].  
 
9.0 Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
 
 Participants may withdraw from the study at any time by [CONTACT_593815]. If 
an individual withdra ws their consent, we will withdraw the participant. Contact [CONTACT_71722] [INVESTIGATOR_620022].  Any remaining 
biological samples and data will be destroyed. Any data or biological samples that have been used for 
research prior to their withdrawal request will not be withdrawn and destroyed.  
A participant may be withdrawn from the study by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_593797]:  
Protocol Version  #: 7  10 
Protocol Date:  6/28/2016  i. A procedural complication occurs prior to com pletion of the study protocol that requires the study  
procedure to be aborted, or precludes collection of study data.  
ii. The patient becomes hemodynamically unstable for any other reason that requires the study procedure  to 
be cancelled prior to completion of  the study protocol, or precludes the collection of study data  
iii. The primary operator determines it is in the patient’s best interest to forego completion of the study 
protocol  
 
10.0  Statistical Considerations  
 
Baseline clinical characteristics will be described  using frequency and percentage for dichotomous 
variables and median with interquartile range for continuous variables. The design of this study is a crossover 
trial between “no treatment” and “atropi[INVESTIGATOR_99646]” . The primary outcome variable is a continu ous variable 
measuring the number of beats of ventricular ectopy. The null hypothesis is that no difference exists between 
the “no treatment” and “atropi[INVESTIGATOR_99646]” interventions in the number of beats of ventricular ectopy. The 
primary analysis will use  a Wilcoxon -signed ranked test. A P -value <0.[ADDRESS_824618] the null 
hypothesis. A secondary outcome will be measurement of complex ventricular ectopy defined as couplets or 
greater. Comparisons will be made between the “no treatment” and “atrop ine treatment” groups using: 1) the 
number of runs of complex ventricular ectopy (continuous variable) using the Wilcoxon -signed ranked test; 
and 2) the presence of complex ventricular ectopy (yes/no) using McNemar’s test. As a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we may be 
under powered to detect our primary analysis, but valuable data regarding the effect size and confidence 
intervals will be obtained to provide sample size estimations for subsequent larger scale clinical trials.

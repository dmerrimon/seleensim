EX-MKTG -149 TIGER  Protocol v 3.0 31 may2023  9 2 INTRODUCTION  
It is anticipated that more than 40% of contact [CONTACT_512379] a contact [CONTACT_528709] , but this target is not reached in most countries .[ADDRESS_686309] to the performance of established products. The goal of this study is to compare the performance of Biofinity toric  (Lens 
A), a silicone hydrogel monthly replacement  lens from CooperVision Inc., which has successfully 
been established on the market with TOTAL30 for astigmatism  (Lens B), a SiHy monthly 
replacement lens recently launched by [CONTACT_516154].  
3 OBJECTIVES  
To compare the clinical performance of Biofinity toric ver sus Total 30 for astigmatism in habitual 
lens wearers, when worn for 1 -month each.  
The prim ary outcome variable: 
• Ease of handling for  lens removal  (0 - 100) reflecting a typi[INVESTIGATOR_528702], 
collected at the 1- month in- office visits   
The secondary outcome variable:  
• Distance Visual Acuity (Snellen converted to logMAR) for study lenses determined at the 1-month in- office visits   
Other  outcome variables :  
o Lens fit: centration, lens orientation, post blink movement at 1-month follow -up 
o Subjective ratings : 
 At- home questionnaires  [collected on Days 7, 14 and 27 (study CL) ] 
 In-office experience ratings - after lens insertion [collected at lens dispense 
visit (study CL) ] 
 In-office experience ratings  – a typi[INVESTIGATOR_528703]  [collected at 
screening (habitual CL)  and 1- month follow -up visits (study CL) ] 
 In-office satisfaction ratings – a typi[INVESTIGATOR_528703]  [collected at 
screening (habitual CL) and 1- month follow -up visits (study CL) ] 
 In-office agreement ratings – a typi[INVESTIGATOR_528703]  [collected at 
screening (habitual CL) and 1- month follow -up visits (study CL) ] 
 In-office preference ratings collected at exit visit  (study CL)

month for each p articipant . Participants  will be randomized immediately prior to their first lens 
dispense.  
This randomization schedule will be generated for each site using a web- based program: 
(www.randomization.com ). The  lens type that will be worn during the first month  is called “ Lens 
type #1”, the lens type dispended for the second month  is called “ Lens type #2”. The final study 
randomization schedule will be generated by [CONTACT_94648]’s  Database Administrator  and provided to the 
research assistants at each site .  
5.1.3 MASKING  
At the fitting visit, only the participant will be masked of the lens type, the investigator will know 
which type is fit to  make changes to the lens at this visit  if needed . Strongly adhesive stickers will 
be placed on the packages/foils to mask the participant to the lens brand. At both dispense 
visits, participants will be masked to the lens type dispensed.  The study personnel will determine 
the lens order according to the r andomization schedule and will over -labeled the l ens 
packages/f oils prior to dispense. 
EX-MKTG -149 TIGER  Protocol v 3.0 31 may2023  11 5.2 INVESTIGATIONAL  SITES  
5.2.1 NUMBER OF S ITES  
This study will be conducted  at approximately 5 optometry  practice sites within the [LOCATION_002]  
and Canada.   
 
5.2.2 IN VESTIGATOR RECRUI TMENT  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_94620]:  
• Is a l icensed Optometrist with at least two years of contact [CONTACT_305760]. 
• Can demonstrate training in Good Clinical Practice (GCP). 
• Accepts responsibility for the conduct of the study at their site.  
• Has in- office email and document scanning capabilities.  
• Will scan and send all study visit documents to CORE, ideally the same day* as the 
visit or at most within 2 days of the study visit.  
• Is willing  to follow the study protocol and to co- operate with the study monitors  at 
CORE . 
* Study documents are required as soon as possible because this allows for timely data review, 
query and entry.  
5.3 STUDY POPULATION 
5.3.1 SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION  
The sample size calculation was based on a recent study comparing Biofinity sphere and Total30 
sphere; the data for subjective responses for ease lens handling for lens removal when reflecting 
in a typi[INVESTIGATOR_5707], collected at the 1- month visits: standard deviation of 2.0 ( 0 - 10 scale) was 
transformed to a standard deviation of 20 for using a 0 - 100 scale for this study. 90% power is 
achieved with a minimum sample size of [ADDRESS_686311] about 
research has been provided. There will also be general  advertising materials ( e.g. posters, social 
media posts ) and all these, including email scripts, will be approved by [CONTACT_516155]. 
All initial individual- targeted recruitment activities, such as any direct mailing of recruitment scripts, 
will be conducted by [CONTACT_234988]. This 
separation will reduce any undue influence of the optometrist -patient relationship. This process 
will also eliminate opportunity for the investigator to access personal health information before any consent for disclosure is provided by [CONTACT_52764].   
It is anticipated that up to [ADDRESS_686312] 44 
completing the study. Each site will dispense study products to approximately 10 participants.

^These recommended percentages are reasonable estimates of market shares in the U.S.  Exceptions 
may be permitted after discussion with the study monitor or sponsor  to target the anticipated habitual lens 
distribution across all si tes. 
*For the purposes of this study, active ocular disease is defined as infection or inflammation which 
requires therapeutic treatment. Mild (i.e. not considered clinically relevant) lid abnormalities  (blepharit is, 
meibomian gland dysfunction, papi[INVESTIGATOR_1257]), corneal and conjunctival staining and dry eye are not considered 
active ocular disease.  Neovascularization and corneal scars  are the result of previous hypoxia, infection or 
inflammation and are therefore not act ive. 
#Pregnant and lactating women are not being excluded from the study due to safety concerns but due to 
fluctuations in refractive error, accommodation and/ or visual acuity that occur secondary to systemic 
hormonal changes  and water retention. It has further been shown that pregnancy could impact tear 
production, which could impact dry eye symptoms. Such fl uctuations could affect the secondary outcome 
data, thereby [CONTACT_512385].  
5.4 STUDY MATERIALS  
Sites will be provided (if needed) with a trial kit  of Lens A and will source their own trial kit  or order 
trial lenses in the required parameters  of Lens B. The sites will use these trial kits /lenses  to fit Lens 
A and Lens B lenses  to determine the optimal lens power . The final lens prescription has to be 
tested on eye and commercial boxes of Lens A and B will be ordered through the site’s normal 
commercial route  (Lenses from the fitting sets will not be used for dispensing). In case, the same 
prescription is worn on both eyes, a single 6- pack will be ordered to be split between both eyes.  
Reimbursement to practice sites for study product expenses will be provided by [CONTACT_528710], 
after CORE has reconciled the invoices and the  product accountability and dispensing logs. 
CORE will provide all sites with the study paperwork. This  will include participant informed consent 
letters and study data collection forms, product accountability logs and the participant dispensing logs. CORE  will train site personnel to complete the forms correctly and provide continued support 
to answer queries on correct form completion.

6 MONITORING PROTOCOL ADHERENCE  
Adherence to study visit windows, lens wearing schedule, and time windows around other data 
collection points (i.e. subjective ratings) will be monitored by [CONTACT_94648]. Deviations from the study 
plan as  described in the protocol will be reported in the study report. As described in Section 13.4, 

EX-MKTG -[ADDRESS_686323]

[ADDRESS_686324] lenses and/or different lens care products at no 
cost to them. The contact [CONTACT_512387]. This study will investigate participants’ wearing schedule intended for daily wear (NOT extended wear) , similar to the average wearing time of 10 -16 hours for daily wear lenses.  
All lenses used in this study are IDE exempt under 21 CFR 812.2(c)2. The two study contact [CONTACT_528715]; on a daily wear  basis with monthly replacement.  
When contact [CONTACT_512389] a daily wear basis there is a small risk of an adverse event compared to not wearing contact [CONTACT_13276]. When contact [CONTACT_512390], there is a significantly increased risk of an adverse reaction compared with wearing contact 
[CONTACT_35491] a daily wear basis.  
Adverse events and/ or complications in daily wear of  soft contact [CONTACT_94652]  (e.g.: 
inflammation and infection).  Complications that may occur during the wearing of contact [CONTACT_94653], dryness, aching or itching eyes, excessive tearing, discharge, hyperemia and 
variable or blurred vision.  More serious risks may include pain, photophobia, iritis, corneal edema or eye infection. Although contact [CONTACT_13293] -related infections are very infrequent, the possibility does 
exist.  The incidence of infection due to day -wear soft lenses is 0.035%. Almost always an infection 
will occur only in one eye.  This risk is assumed by 35- million Americans who currently wear 
contact [CONTACT_528716].  
A dye (fluorescein) normally used for eye examinations is being used in this study. Although rare, it is possible to have an allergic reaction to the dye. Participants will be asked if they  have  a 
known allergy or sensitivity to fluorescein. 
The assessments conducted in this study are r outine clinical procedures  and they includ e auto-
refraction, auto -keratometry, visual acuity, anterior ocular health assessment, and contact [CONTACT_94654]. In addition, high magnification imaging of the lens fit may be made using [ADDRESS_686325] ions from their 
investigator regarding early symptoms and signs of adverse events.  
8 ADVERSE EVENTS  
See CORE SOP012 for a description of all adverse events, including management and reporting . 
An ‘adverse event’ refers to any undesirable clinical occurrence in a participant, whether it is 
considered to be device- related or not. Adverse events (AE) may be classified as ‘unanticipated 
adverse device effects,’ ‘serious adverse events,’ ‘significant adverse events,’ or ‘non- significant 
adverse events,’  as defined below , Table 5.  
A number of conditions may result in temporary suspension until resolution. These include corneal infiltrates, corneal staining, limbal injection, bulbar injection or tarsal conjunctival abnormalities.  
Table 4 : Classification of types of adverse event  
AE classification, coding (for reporting to the sponsor) and reporting details, plus examples , are 
provided in Table 6.

Significant 
Adverse Event  Those non- s erious adverse events that occur with contact [CONTACT_528718] -threatening but are usually symptomatic and may warrant therapeutic 
management and /or temporary or permanent discontinuation of contact [CONTACT_13279].  
Non- Significant 
Adverse Events  Those less severe non- s erious adverse events that occur with contact [CONTACT_528719] -threatening, may or may not be symptomatic and may warrant palliative 
management, such as ocular lubricants or temporary interruption of contact [CONTACT_13279].  
Unanticipated 
Adverse Device 
Effect  Adverse events in a study that were not previously identified in the protocol in terms of nat

9 DISCONTINUATION FROM THE STUDY  
Participants may be discontinued at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor in consideration 
of participant safety or protocol compliance, or at discretion of the participant.  Participants 
discontinued from a study will be reimbursed for their active involvement in the study (including the initial screening visit  and all lens fitting visits ) as per the information on the consent letter .  
Upon discontinuing, a participant will be offered the option of their data being withdrawn from future statistical analysis. The following is a list of possible reasons for discontinuation from the study:  
• Screening failure: Part icipants will be discontinued if  they do not meet the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria outlined in section 5.2.3. 
• Unacceptable performance with products to be used in study: Participants may be discontinued if they are unable to achieve acceptable comfort and /or vision with the study products.  
• Positive slit lamp finding: Participants may be permanently discontinued from the study 
depending on the severity of the condition and on the judgement of the investigator.   
• Adverse event: If a participant experiences an adverse event during the study,  they may 
be discontinued based on the clinical judgement of the investigator.  

EX-MKTG -149 TIGER  Protocol v 3.0 31 may2023  33 • Symptoms : If the participant has persistent symptoms,  they may be discontinued based 
on the clinical judgement of the investigator.  
• Disinterest, relocation or illness: The participant may choose to discontinue due to 
reasons within or beyond their control.  
• Violation of protocol or non- compliance:  The participant will be discontinued if they are 
unable or unwilling to follow the protocol specified visit schedules  and/or study 
procedures . 
• Instillation of topi[INVESTIGATOR_94625]:  The participant will be discontinued if they elect to use a topi[INVESTIGATOR_528707] a limited duration (less than two weeks)  to treat a transient condition; in 
this case  the participant may remain an active participant (at the discretion of the 
investigator) after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_94627]).  
• Lost to follow -up:  The participant will be discontinued if they cannot be contact[CONTACT_234990], and if the investigator has made a reasonable 
effort to contact [CONTACT_94656] a final study visit.  
• Premature termination of the study by [CONTACT_456], CORE  or Sterling IRB . 
A discontinuation form , stating the reason for discontinuation will be completed, which requires 
the signatures of both the participant and the investigator except where the participant is lost to 
follow- up in which case only the signature [CONTACT_94669] .   
When a participant chose to discontinue from the study,  they will be given the opportunity to 
withdraw their data from the statistical analysis. This choice will be captured on the discontinuation form.  
All discontinuations including their reasons will be included in the final report.  
[ADDRESS_686329]  and approved consent letter . 
12 S TATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND DATA MANAGEMENT  
12.1 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
All data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_94657].  Unmasked data analysis will be 
conducted using Statistica 14.0 , Statsoft or other suitable softwar e.  Descriptive statistics will be 
provided on demographic data  (age, gender, refractive error distribution, etc.).  Table [ADDRESS_686330] will be used to analyze the results for the count data of 
subjective preferences and experience responses. Where relevant, the number of “ no 
preference” responses will be evenly distributed to the two options on the basis they would be equally likely to choose either.  
For assessments conducted for each eye separately, the right eye will be  used for analysis. If a 
general difference is found (paired t -test / Wilcoxon matched pairs) between OD and OS, a 
comment will be  provided. 
Where appropriate, data may be presented as both mean  or median  and as counts by ‘bucket’ 
groups.

13 PROTOCOL & OTHER TRAINING  
All study personnel will be required to complete training prior to their involvement in the study. Records of training will be kept at CORE . This will include train ing by [CONTACT_94660] , study procedures, informed consent procedures, and on the randomization and 
participant masking procedures , as well as training for Good Clinical Practice.   
All site Principal Investigators and co-investigators will provide a scan of their curriculum vitae, 
license to practice optometry and evidence of professional indemnity insurance.  
14 STUDY MONITORING  
Each site will provide regular  status reports to CORE . Status r eports will include:  
• The number of participants screened, enrolled, and randomized (i.e. assigned a study ID number), discontinued and completed.  
• Details of all protocol deviations, adverse events, device malfunctions . 
• Reports of unintended events.  
CORE will collate the site updates and regular  status reports to the study sponsor.  
Study monitoring visits to the sites may be conducted by [CONTACT_94648], the sponsor, or sponsor’s 
designate,  throughout the study and will be scheduled in conjunction with t he Princip al 
Investigator at each site. In addition, study records may be inspected by [CONTACT_456], the 
sponsor's designate, Sterling Institutional Review Board, and by [CONTACT_234993], namely Health Canada and the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug 
EX-MKTG -149 TIGER  Protocol v 3.0 31 may2023  37 Administration (FDA); however, they will not be permitted to take away any records containing 
identifiable personal information.  
Study data review and data monitoring will be conducted by [CONTACT_94662]. To improve data integrity,  data entry will be conducted by [CONTACT_94663] a second person will visually compare 
the data entry to the source documents.  Data queries will be reported to the site within 5 working 
days of receipt of initial data. A response resolving the query will be expected from the site within 
5 working days of receipt of the query.  
All adverse events and protocol deviations will be reviewed by [CONTACT_94664]  [INVESTIGATOR_528708]. All serious adverse events and major protocol deviations will be reviewed by [CONTACT_94665]’s Lead Co -ordinator before reporting to the 
sponsor and to Sterling Institutional Review Board as per their policies .

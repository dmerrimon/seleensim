FailuresAdded the following text:
Individuals for whom screen failure is 
related to failing the disease severity 
(including extent of disease) inclusion 
criterion and who subsequently 
experience worsening AD, which in 
the investigator’s judgement would 
make them eligible for participation, 
may be considered for re -screening. 
Such cases should be discussed w ith 
the [COMPANY_007] Medical Monitor (or 
designee) to determine if re- screening 
is appropriate.Section was updated to clarify circumstance s 
under which rescreening may be permitted.

•Intercurrent event: All data collected will be utilized;
•Population-level summary: Mean fold-change from baseline within each treatment 
group.
Overall Design:
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, Phase 2a study to investigate the mechanism of action of abrocitinib by [CONTACT_914151] ≥[ADDRESS_1284401] dose of study intervention to confirm study eligibility. A total of approximately 51 participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive abrocitinib 200 mg once daily (QD), abrocitinib [ADDRESS_1284402] from Baseline/Day 1 to Week 12. Lesional skin 
biopsy (punch biopsy) collections are required at Baseline/Day 1 (Week 0), Day 29 (Week 4), and Day 85 (Week 12), with an optional lesional skin biopsy collection at Day 15 (Week 2). Non-lesional skin biopsy collection is required at Baseline/Day 1 (Week 0), with an optional non-lesional skin biopsy collection at Day 85 (Week 12).
The skin biopsy samples will be analyzed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and gene 
expression by [CONTACT_914152] (qRT-PCR), including Taqman Low Density Array (TLDA) PCR, for 48 genes including 2 housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_8582] (18S and ribosomal protein lateral stalk subunit P0 [RPLP0]), as well as single gene PCR for a few genes that are often below detection level on TLDA.  
Blood for analyses of changes in inflammatory and cardiovascular markers will be collected 
at various time points.
 
Red 
Blood Cell and platelets derive from a common progenitor. Blood for platelet and red blood cell (RBC) counts will be collected and analyzed at all scheduled time points to characterize the potential mechanism by [CONTACT_914153] a dose-dependent and self-limited manner after abrocitinib administration. OLINK proteomics will be used to analyze biomarkers in serum, including [ADDRESS_1284403] the option to enter 
the long-term extension (LTE) Study B7451015. Participants discontinuing early from this study will undergo a 4-week off-treatment follow-up period.CCI

Page 332.INTRODUCTION
Abrocitinib is aJanus kinase 1(JAK1) inhibitor that is being investigated as a treatment for 
patients with moderate -to-severe AD. 
The Janus kinase (JAK) family , including JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and ty rosine kinase 2
(TYK2), is a group of cy toplasmic ty rosine kinases that mediate signal transduction via 
interactions with Ty pe1 and Ty pe2 cytokine receptors critical for leukocy te activation, 
proliferation, survival, and function. Cytokine receptors demonstrate restric ted association 
with JAKs such that different receptors or receptor classes preferentially  utilize a given JAK 
dimer combination to transduce their signal. JAK1 pairs with JAK3 to mediate  -common 
cytokine signaling and also with JAK2 or TYK2 to transmit t he signals of additional 
cytokines important in inflammation and immune responses, including interleukin (IL) -4, 
IL-5, IL -6, IL -13, IL -21, IL -31, interferon -gamma (IFN -), and IFN -alpha (IFN -).JAK2 
homodimers are critical for the signaling of hematopoietic cy tokines and hormones, 
including thrombopoietin (TPO), ery thropoietin (EPO), IL -3, granulocy te-macrophage 
colony -stimulating factor, and prolactin. IL-12, EPO, and IL -23 are dependent on TYK2 and 
JAK2 for transmitting their signals.
Followi ng cy tokine activation, receptor -associated JAKs are phosphory lated and in turn 
phosphory late specific sites on the receptor intracellular domain. Phosphorylation of specific 
sites on the intracellular domain of the receptor allows for the recruitment of s ignal 
transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) that can subsequently  be phosphory lated 
by [CONTACT_74061]. Phosphory lated STAT molecules are released from the receptor, translocate to the 
nucleus where they  bind to specific sites on deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA), and regulate gene 
transcription. 
The inflammatory  skin disorder AD is characterized by  [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_214221] d ysfunction and 
active AD lesions are accompanied by  [CONTACT_914154].1,2,3Skin lesions have 
shown increased infiltration by  T cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and eosinophils; increased 
production of cy tokines and chemokines; and reactive epi[INVESTIGATOR_3915] h yperplasia, in which 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_914135] (ie, filaggrin and loricrin) are highly  suppressed.4,5,6
Although AD has been classified as a Th2 -dominated disease, other T-cell subsets (eg, Th22, 
Th17, and Th1 cells) might also contribute to pathoge nesis.2,3Key cytokines implicated in 
the pathophy siology of AD include IL-4,IL-5,IL-13,IL-31, and IFN -.These cy tokines 
require JAK1 for signal transduction suggesting that selective JAK1 inhibitors, which 
modulate the activity ofthese cytokines, represent a compelling approach to the treatment of
inflammatory skin diseases such as AD.7
Data from a Phase 2b proof of concept (POC) study  (B7451006) that evaluated participants 
with moderate -to-severe AD showed positive efficacy  with the JAK1 inhibitor abrocitinib, as 
well as an acceptable safety profile, sufficient to support further clinica l development in a 
larger Phase 3 program. Abrocitinib is an orally  bioavailable small molecule that selectivel y 
inhibits JAK1 by  [CONTACT_74055] (ATP) binding site. Abrocitinib has a 
high degree of selectivit y in vitro against other ki nases: 28 -fold selectivity  over JAK2, 
>340 -fold over JAK3 and 43 -fold over TYK2, as well as a good selectivity profile over the 
broader range of human kinases.

In Stud y B7451006 there were dose -dependent decreases in mean platelet counts in the 
abrocitinib 200 mg once daily  (QD) and 100 mg QD doses with a nadir at Week 4 (200 mg 
QD: -29.84%; 100 mg QD: -11.42%). Platelet counts resolved on treatment and returned to 
baseline b y 4 weeks after end of treatment. The maj ority  of participants maintained platelet 
counts within the normal range. No participant had an AE related to sequelae from 
thrombocy topenia (ie, bleeding or bruising). In addition, changes in total reticulocy tes
(absolute) were observed in all treatment g roups , but were generally  not clinically  relevant.
The abrocitinib [ADDRESS_1284417] be tightly  regulated to avoid spontaneous bleeding or 
arterial occlusion and organ damage. Multifaceted and complex mechanisms control platelet 
removal and production in phy siological and pathological conditions. Production of red 
blood cells (RBCs) is a highly regulated process; however, the time of RBCs in circulation is 
longer (approximately  120 days) than that of platelets (8-9 days).Reticulocy tes (immature 
RBCs that mature to RBCs in 2-3 days) ha ve a shorter time, and as such, may  be a more 
sensitive indicator of JAK inhibition on RBC production. Both platelets and RBC derive 
from the same progenitor. Hence, changes in one compartment can affect the other.
The Ashwell -Morrell receptor (AMR) recogn izes senescent, desialy lated platelets under 
steady -state conditions.8Desialy lated platelets and the AMR are the ph ysiological ligand -
receptor pair regulating hepatic TPO messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) production, 
resolving the longstanding question of stead y-state TPO regulation. The AMR -mediated 
removal of desial ylated platelets regulates TPO s ynthesis in the liver by [CONTACT_914155]2 and

AMR -JAK2 signaling cascade could additionally  contribute to thrombocy topenia associated 
with JAK1/2 treatment.
2.1.Study Rationale
Abrocitinib is being developed as an oral treatment for patients with moderate -to-severe AD 
based on the clinical results obtained in Phase 1 and Phase 2studies. Additional information 
for the Phase 1 and Phase 2 study  results previously  completed may  be found in the 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB) .Phase 3 studies are ongoing to evaluate abrocitinib as 
monotherap y or when co -administered with background med icated topi[INVESTIGATOR_52201] y in adults 
or adolescents with AD.
This study  (B7451037) is designed specifically  to evaluate abrocitinib monotherapy  in adults 
with AD to characterize the mechanism of action of abrocitinib and assess the effects of 
abrocitinib on the molecular signature [CONTACT_914177]1 inhibition in lesional and non- lesional skin 
and its correlation to clinical efficacy  outcomes. The JAK1 AD Study  B7451006 showed 
dose-dependent, self- limited decrease in platelet counts, but did not provide any  mechanistic

9,10AD is one of the most common, 
chronic, relapsing childhood dermatoses, impacting 15-30% of all children in the US and many have disease that persists into adulthood. Earlier reports indicated that, in up to 70% of cases, the disease greatly improved or resolved by [CONTACT_74054], however more recent findings suggest that disease activity remains manifest for a prolonged period of time.

Non-medicated topi[INVESTIGATOR_420900].

severe adverse effects and require careful monitoring; therefore, the use of these agents is 
limited to short courses or intermittent therap y.Furthermore, the globally  approved dosing 
for dupi[INVESTIGATOR_74020] 2 × 300 mg subcutaneous injection followed by  300 mg 
every  other week injections may  limit the desirability  of this route of treatment.
Of the currentl y available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], none offers a cure; therefore, the main aims of existing 
treatments are to reduce the occurrence of acute flares, to increase the time between relapses, 
and to reduce pruritus and the resulting sleep disturbance.16,17
Abrocitinib is an orally  active JAK1 inhibitor that has demonstrated clinical efficacy  in the 
Phase 2 Study  B7451006. As mentioned above, a variet y of pro -inflam matory  cytokines such 
as IL -4, IL -5, IL -13, thymic stromal ly mphopoietin (TSL P), IL -31 and IFN -, have been 
suggested to have a role in the pathogenesis of AD. Many  of these pathogenic cy tokines use 
JAK1 for signaling. Therefore, JAK1 is an attractive ther apeutic target for AD. However, a 
dose-dependent platelet decrease has been observed during the JAK1 development program, 
and the mechanism causing this is poorly  understood. Data from this study  will describe the 
molecular signature [CONTACT_914177]1 inhibition in healthy and AD lesional skin, as well as 
investigating the mechanism by  [CONTACT_914156]- to-severe AD.
2.2.1. Non-Clinical and Phase 1 Data
Data from nonclinical and Phase 1 programs supports the planned clinical trials with 
abrocitinib and further information is in the current version of the IB.
2.2.2. Phase 2b in AD (B7451006)
B7451006 was a Phase 2b proof-of- concept trial in 269 adults (ages 18-75) with 
moderate -to-severe AD investigating doses of 10, 30, 100, and 200 mg abrocitinib or placebo 
taken once daily  for up to 12 weeks. The primary  endpoint was the proportion of participants 
achieving an Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score of clear (0), or almost clear (1), 
and a 2-point improvement from baseline at Week 12. The baseline was defined as the IGA 
score on Day 1 pre -dose. 
At Week 12, IGA response rates of the abrocitinib 200 mg and 100 mg dose groups were 
significantl y greater than the placebo group, 44.5%, 27.8% and 6.3%, respectivel y.As a 
result, the estimated differences from placebo in the 200 mg and 100 mg groups were 38.2% 
(P=0.0032) and 21.5% (P=0.0184), respectivel y.The percent change from baseline in 
Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) scores at Week 12 were significantly  higher for 
both the 200 mg and 100 mg groups compared to placebo, 63.7%, 41.6%, and 15.6% 
respectivel y.At Week 12, the proportion of participants achieving EASI -75 response was 
15.6% in the placebo group, 63.7% in the 200 mg group and 41.6% in the 100 mg gro up.As 
a result, the difference from placebo was 41.8% (P<0.0001) for the 200 mg group and 26.0% 
(P=0.0043) in the 100 mg group. Response rates at Week 12 for the 10 mg and 30 mg groups 
were not significantly different from placebo.

Page 37At Day 15, the proporti on of response based on achieving Peak Pruritus numerical rating 
scale 4 points improvement from baseline (NRS4) of abrocitinib 100 mg and 200 mg dose 
groups was greater than placebo. The estimated proportion of Peak Pruritus NRS4 responses 
at Day 15 were 69.8%, 41.1% and 15.7% for [ADDRESS_1284422] through 
12 w eeks of treatment. A key  differentiating feature for the JAK1 inhibitor is rapid resolution 
of itch associated with AD. Significant separation from placebo was achieved for the Peak 
Pruritus numerical rating scale (NRS) score as early  as 2 day s after initi ation of treatment for 
the 200 mg dose group.
Overall, the results demonstrated dose dependent increases in responses at Week 12 for key  
efficacy  endpoints (IGA, EASI  and Peak Pruritus NRS).
Abrocitinib was generally  safe and well tolerated in this study .Overall, adverse events (AEs) 
and serious AEs (SAEs) were numericall y higher in participants receiving abrocitinib 
compared to placebo, but did not appear to increase with dose. The most common AEs were 
in the I nfections and infestations, skin and subcutan eous tissue disorders and Gastrointestinal 
disorders s ystem organ class, and the majorit y of the AEs were mild. There were 2 cases of 
herpes zoster, one in the 10 mg group (not treatment-related), and one in the 30 mg group 
(treatment -related). In the AD P hase 2 Stud y B7451006, there were dose -dependent 
decreases in mean platelet counts in the 200 mg QD and 100 mg QD doses with a nadir at 
Week 4 (200 mg QD: -29.84%; 100 mg QD: - 11.42%). Platelet counts were resolving on 
treatment and returned to baseline b y 4weeks after end of treatment. Further details of the 
clinical Phase 2 development program can be found in the IB.
2.2.3. Summary of Abrocitinib Clinical Pharmacokinetics
Abrocitinib was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_2478] y absorbed following single dose oral solution/suspension 
administra tion over the dose range 3 mg to 200 mg with time to maximum absorption (T max) 
ranging between 0.55 to 0.77 hours (B7451001). Median T maxat doses of 400 mg and 
800mg was 1.5 and 3.9 hours, respectively , which indicated slower absorption compared to 
lower doses. Abrocitinib showed a monophasic decline at dose <100 mg with biphasic 
profiles at doses ≥100 mg. Observed abrocitinib maximum plasma concentrations (C max) 
following the single dose administration generall y increased in proportion to the dose from 
3mg to [ADDRESS_1284423], both area under the plasma concentration -time profile from time 
zero extrapolated to infinite time (AUC inf) and area under the plasma concentration -time 
profile from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration ( AUC last) were dose 
proportional in the range of 3 mg to 200 mg, while a greater than proportional increase was 
observed at doses of 400 and 800 mg.The arithmetic mean terminal phase half -life (t ½) was 
1.9 to 4.9 hours.
Following QD administration over the dose range 30 mg to 400 mg and 100 mg and 
200mgtwice a day  (BID) for 10 days, median T maxranged between 0.50 to 0.77 hours 
(B7451001). After attainment of C max, the disposition of abrocitinib was consistent with that 
Abrocitinib
B7451037
Protocol Amendment 3, [ADDRESS_1284424] dose and an arithmetic mean terminal phase t ½between 2.8 to 5.0 hours. The 
observed accumulation ratio (R ac) for area under the curve over dosing interval tau (AUC tau) 
and C maxfollowing QD dosing was minimal (between 1.1 and 1.5), consistent with the 
prediction from t ½.Urinary  recovery  of abrocitinib was low, with <5% of the dose recovered 
unchanged in urine across all doses and regimens in all cohorts.
At a single 800 mg dose, the geome tric mean percent coefficient of variation (%CV) C max
(ng/mL) was similar in Western (n=5; 3819 [26]) and Japanese participants (n=10; 3660 
[48]). However, geometric mean AUC inf(ng*hr/mL) was 26% higher in Western participants 
(n=5; [ZIP_CODE] [35]) than that observed in Japanese participants (n=9; [ZIP_CODE] [43]) (B7451001).
Geometric mean (%CV) C maxand AUC taufollowing multiple dose administration of 200 mg 
BID were 17% and 56% higher , respectivel y, in the Western participants (n=5) than in 
Japanese participants (n=6). 
Co-administration of 400 mg with food resulted in equivalent geometric mean AUC inf
between fasted and fed conditions and a small mean decrease (<5%) in C max.Overall, 
abrocitinib can be administered with or without food.
Plasma profiling from the [14C] abrocitinib human mass balance stud y (B7451008) indicated 
parent as the most prevalent circulating species (26%), with 3 major and more polar mono -
hydroxylated metabolites identified: PF -06471658 (3- hydroxyprop yl, 11%), PF -07055087 
(2-hydroxyprop yl, 12%), and PF -07054874 (p yrrolidinone py rimidine, 14%).
2.2.4. Populatio nPharmacokinetics
Population pharmacokinetics (PK) anal ysis was conducted by  [CONTACT_420983] 1 
studi es (B7451001, first -in-human study , and B7451004, relative bioavailability  study ) in 
healthy  volunteers and the proof -of-concept study  (B7451006) in AD patients. A total of 
[ADDRESS_1284425] -order absorption. The estimates of 
systemic clearance/fraction of dose absorbed (CL/F) and volume of distribution/fraction 
absorbed (V/F) were 44.8 L/hr and 147 L with inter individual variability  (IIV) values 
of63% and 35% (expressed as %CV), respectively .Apparent clearance (CL/F) of AD 
patients was estimated to be ~38% lower than that of healthy  participants; residual variability  
was estimated to be higher in AD patients compared to the value in h ealthy participants (66% 
vs. 36% CV). Baseline body  weight, race, age and sex were tested as covariates on clearance 
and did not appear to impact the PK of abrocitinib.
2.3.Benefit/Risk Assessment
There was clinicall y meaningful benefit demonstrated fo r abrocitinib 200 mg QD and 
100 mg QD in the Phase 2b POC study  in adult participants with moderate -to-severe AD.
The potential risks of treatment include those that were noted in Phase 2b and/or those based 
on the known pharmacology  of other well studied JAK inhibitors (such as tofacitinib) and 
include viral reactivation, serious and opportunistic infections, hematopoietic effects 
(including decreases in platelet counts), malignancy  and immunoproliferative disorders.

4.1. Overall Design
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, Phase 2a study to 
investigate the mechanism of action of abrocitinib by [CONTACT_914157] ≥[ADDRESS_1284426] dose of study intervention to confirm study eligibility. A total of approximately 51 participants will be randomized in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_1284427] the option to enter the long-term extension (LTE) study B7451015. Participants discontinuing early from this study will undergo a 4-week off-treatment follow-up.
Participants who have chronic moderate-to-severe AD as defined per the inclusion criteria 
will be enrolled in this study. Eligible participants must have a documented history, within [ADDRESS_1284428] been washed out prior to Day 1 (see Section 5.2). Participants who continue to meet eligibility 
criteria at baseline will undergo Baseline/ Day 1 assessments and will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive abrocitinib 200 mg (N=17) or abrocitinib 100 mg QD (N=17) or matching placebo QD (N=17) from Day 1. 
The double-blind treatment period will last from Baseline/Day 1 to Week 12. For all 
participants, one 4.5 mm skin biopsy (punch biopsy) will be collected from each target 
treatment area at the specified time points. Lesional skin biopsies will be collected at Baseline/Day 1 (Week 0), Day 29 (Week 4), and Day 85 (Week 12), with an optional lesional skin biopsy collection at Day 15 (Week 2). A non-lesional skin biopsy will be collected at Baseline/Day 1 (Week 0), with an optional non-lesional skin biopsy collection at Day 85 (Week 12).

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis will be performed for cellular infiltrates, Keratin 16 
(K16) staining, and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining.
Many of the genes to be analyzed in this study are considered key biomarkers associated with 
AD pathways. For this study, the following biomarkers were selected for the primary endpoint: general inflammation (MMP12), hyperplasia (K16), Th2 immune response (CCL17, CCL18, CCL26), and Th22 immune response (S100A8, S100A9, S100A12).
 
The efficacy outcomes (eg, IGA, EASI, % body surface area [%BSA], and peak pruritus 
numerical rating scale [PP-NRS]) are collected so that any associations between biomarker changes and these efficacy outcomes may be evaluated. The clinical improvement will be correlated with the suppression of individual immune pathways, cellular infiltrates, and changes in epi[INVESTIGATOR_914137]. Differences between groups and changes from baseline will be estimated. Tests of hypotheses for differences between treatment groups will not be performed.
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_750624], standard laboratory testing, and collection of AEs.Refer to the Schedule of Activities for a complete list of assessments to be performed during

4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design
This study is part of the global clinical development program for abrocitinib investigating the 
safety and efficacy of doses of 200 mg QD and 100 mg QD. This study is designed to specifically evaluate the mechanism of action of abrocitinib in adults with AD. 
4.3. Justification for Dose
Dose selection for Phase 3 was based on efficacy and safety of abrocitinib from a 
dose-ranging Phase 2b study, B7451006 that evaluated a 20-fold dose range (10 mg to 200 mg QD) in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. 
Specifically for this study, both doses used in the Phase 3 program (100 mg QD and 200 mg 
QD) were selected based on the observed efficacy and the separation observed between doses CCI

markers of hemostasis, platelet counts, and other cell ty pes.
In Stud y B7451006, both the abrocitinib 200 mg QD and 100 mgQD doses demonstrated 
acceptable safet y and tolerability. A dose -dependent decrease in the mean platelet count from 
baseline was observed with a nadir at Week 4 (Figure 1). At Week 4, the mean platelet count 
and the 90% confidence interval (CI) were within the normal reference range for the 100 mg 
dose and 200 mg dose. The mean platelet counts increased towards baseline after Week 4. In 
addition, there was a decrease in mean reticulocy te count i n the 200 mg QD group with a 
nadir at Week 2 ( -14.73%). The mean reticulocy te count returned to baseline on treatment by  
[CONTACT_10585] 8. Leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocy topenia were reported by  1participant in 
the 200 mg group, all of which were moderate an d treatment -related. The platelet level in this 
participant was less than 0.5 × lower limit of normal. There were no reported adverse clinical 
effects (eg, bleeding events) potentially  associated with reduced platelet counts observed in 
Study  B7451006. Fur ther details are available in the IB.

Page 565.4.Screen Failures
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study  but 
are not subsequently  entered in the study . A minimal set of screen failure information is 
required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants to meet the 
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to 
respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes demography , 
screen fail ure details, eligibility  criteria, and any  serious adverse event (SAE).
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study  (screen failure) may  be 
rescreened once after discussion with [COMPANY_007] if they fail the screening evaluation for reasons 
related to incidental transitory  conditions. Individuals for whom screen failure is related to 
failing the disease severity  (including extent of disease) inclusion criterion and who 
subsequently  experience worsening AD, which in the investigator’s judgement would make 
them eligible for participation, may be considered for re -screening. Such cases should be 
discussed with the [COMPANY_007] Medical Monitor (or designee) to determine if re -screening is 
appropriate.
6.STUDY INTERVENTION
Study  intervention is defined as an y investigational intervention(s), marketed product(s), 
placebo, or medical device(s) intended to be administered to a study  participant according to 
the study  protocol.
The interventions are abrocitinib (also known as PF -04965842) and placebo. Abrocitinib will

been maintained during transit for all study  intervention received and any  
discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the study  intervention.
2.Only  participants enrolled in the study  may  receive study  intervention and only  
authorized site staff may  supply  or administer study  intervention. All study  
intervention must be stored in a secure, environmentally  controlled, and monitored 
(manual or automated) area in accordance w ith the labeled storage conditions with 
access limited to the investigator and authorized site staff.
3.The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) 
is responsible for stud y intervention accountability, reconciliat ion, and record 
maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records).
4.Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study  
interventions are provided in the I nvestigational Product (IP) Manual.
6.3.Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding
Blinded study  
using central 
randomization 
via IRT s ystem.Participants will be randomized into the study  on Day [ADDRESS_1284455] met all inclusion 
and none of the exclusion criteria for participation in the study  at 
screening and Day 1. A computer -generated randomization schedule 
will be used to assign participants to the treatment groups using a n 
Interactive Response Technology (IRT).
The site personnel (stud y coordinator or specified designee) will be 
required to enter or select information including but not limited to the 
user’s identification (ID) and password, protocol number, the 
participant number and the date of birth of the participant. The site 
personnel will then be provided with a treatment assignment and 
dispensable unit (DU) or container number when abrocitinib / placebo 
study  intervention is being supplied via the IRT. Treatment 
assignment will be based on a central randomization list consisting of

the site’s files. 
There is a [ADDRESS_1284457] information and further details on the use of the 
IRT. 
Note: The IRT is the source of the participant number. The IRT 
system will provide the participant number at the end of the first IRT 
participant transaction.
Blind Break (I RT) Investigators, participants and the sponsor study  team will be 
blinded as to treatment group. The study  will be participant 
(including caregiver) and investigator blinded. At all times, 
treatment and randomization information will be kept confidential 
and will not be released to the investigator, the study  staff, or the 
sponsor’s study  team until follo wing the conclusion of the study , 
with the exception described in this section. 
At the initiation of the study , the study  site will be instructed on 
procedures for breaking the blind. Blinding codes should only  be 
broken in emergency situations for reason s of participant safet y. The 
method will be an electronic process. When the blind for a 
participant has been broken, the reason must be fully  documented 
and entered on the Case Report Form (CRF). Whenever possible, 
the investigator should contact [CONTACT_914158]. If 
the blind is broken, the investigator should promptly  inform the 
[COMPANY_007] Clinician. The participant for whom the blind has been 
broken will be discontinued from the stud y and undergo the earl y 
termination (ET) procedures.
6.4. Study Intervention Compliance
Participant compliance with study  intervention will be assessed at each visit. Deviation(s) 
from the prescribed dosage regimen should be recorded in the electronic case report form 
(eCRF) .
For self -administration of abrocitinib / placebo at home, compliance will be recorded b y the 
participant.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 59When study  intervention is administered at the study  site (Weeks 4 and 12 to accommodate 
PK analy sis), it will be administered under the supervision of study  personnel.
Complia nce with the dosing of stud y intervention will be monitored and verified b y 
delegated site personnel through a combination of the accounting of unused study  
intervention returned b y the participant at the study visits, review of the dosing diary , and 
discussion with the participant which will be documented in the source documents.
Study  intervention should be taken in the morning. Participants should be instructed that if a 
dose is inadvertentl y missed then it should be taken as soon as remembered, but not within 
12 hours of the next scheduled dose. 
The fol lowing compliance cases will be considered medication errors and will be discussed 
with the sponsor for possible withdrawal from the study :
Participants interrupting study  intervention for more than 4 consecutive days or for a 
total of more than 7 days between visits; 
Participants administering >8 tablets in one day  or administering 4tablets/day  for 
4consecutive day s; 
Participants who have an overall compliance of <80% or >120% between visits.
Any deviation from protocol specified dosing should be recorded as a protocol deviation and 
the investigator or designee is to counsel the participant and ensure steps are taken to 
improve compliance. In addition, if the compliance deviation reaches the threshold s defined 
above it should also be recorded as a medication error (see Section 8.3.10 ).
6.5.Concomitant Therapy
Any medication or vacci ne (including over -the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, 
and/or herbal supplements) that the participant is receiving at the time of enrollment or 
receives during the study must be recorded along with:
Dates of administration including start and end dates
Dosage information including dose and frequency
The [COMPANY_007] clinician should be contact[CONTACT_710274] y.
Participants must abstain from taking new prescription or nonprescription drugs (including 
vitamins and dietary  or herbal supplements) within 7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is 
longer) before the start of study  intervention until completion of the follow- up visit (see 
Appendix 7for washout periods for CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 inhibitors and inducers ), unless, 
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_110409], the medication will not interfere with the

Section 6.5.2 and Appendix 7, of the protocol. Medications that are taken in the 
Screening/Washout period (after informed consent is obtained and before the first dos e of 
study  intervention) will be documented as prior medications. Medications taken after the first 
dose of study  intervention has been administered will be documented as concomitant 
medications. All concomitant medications taken during the study  must be r ecorded in stud y 
records with indication (if AD), reference to an y associated adverse event, dose, and start and 
stop dates of administration. Participants will be queried about concomitant medication 
(including topi[INVESTIGATOR_74030], over- the-counter and prescription medications 
and treatments, and vaccinations) at each study  visit. Any  new concomitant medications or 
dose changes to current concomitant medications should be evaluated for potential new or 
worsening adverse events.
6.5.1. Permitted Concomitant Treatments
The following concomitant AD standard -of-care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_914143]:
Oral antihistamines;
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_15385]- medicated emollient.

DISCONTINUATION/WITH DRAWAL
     
7.1.Discontinuation of Study Intervention
In certain instances, it may  be necessary  for a participant to permanentl y discontinue study  
intervention (ie, study  treatment). If study  intervention is permanently discontinued, the 
participant will remain in the study  to be evaluated for EOT assessments (per Schedule of 
Activities). 
Note that discontinuation of study treatment does not represent withdrawal from the study . 
Refer to Appendix 10for discontinuation crite ria.     
See the Schedule of Activities for data to be collected at the time of intervention 
discontinuation and follow- up and for an y further evaluations that need to be completed.
7.1.1. Temporary Discontinuation
Temporary  interruption to dosing is not allowed in this study , except when specified in the 
protocol for participant safet y.
7.2.Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study
A participant may  withdraw from the study  at an y time at his/her own reques t. Reasons for 
discontinuation from the study  include the following:
Refused further follow -up;
Lost to follow -up;
Death;
Study  terminated by  [CONTACT_3211];
At the time of discontinuing from the stud y, if possible, an earl y discontinuation visit should 
be conducted .See the Schedule of Activities for assessments to be collected at the time of 
study  discontinuation and follow -up and for an y further evaluations that need to be 
completed.
The early  discontinuation vi sit applies only  to participants who are enrolled/randomized and 
then are prematurely  withdrawn from the study . Participants should be questioned regarding 
their reason for withdrawal
If a participant withdraws from the study , he/she may  request destruction of an y remaining 
samples taken and not tested , and the investigator must document any  such requests in the 
site study  records and notify  the sponsor accordingly .

Page 63If the participant withdraws from the study  and also withdraws consent (see Section 7.2.1) 
for disclosure of future information, no further evaluations should be performed and no 
additional data should be collected. The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data 
collected before such withdrawal of consent.
Lack of completion of all or an y of the withdrawal/earl y termination procedures will not be 
viewed as protocol deviations so long as the participant’s safet y was preserved.
7.2.1. Withdrawal of Consent 
Participants who request to discontinue receipt of study  intervention will remain in the study  
andmust continue to be followed for protocol -specified follow -up procedures. The onl y 
exception to this is when a participant specificall y withdraws consent for any further contact 
[CONTACT_78258]. Participants should notify  the investigator in writing of the decision to withdraw 
consent from future follow -up, whenever possible. The w ithdrawal of consent should be 
explained in detail in the medical records b y the investigator, as to whether the withdrawal is 
only from further receipt of study  intervention or also from study  procedures and/or 
posttreatment study  follow -up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page. In the event that 
vital status (whether the participant is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly  available 
information should be used to determine vital status only  as appropriatel y directed in 
accordance with local law.
7.3.Lost to Follow up
A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedl y fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] b y the study  site.
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study  visit:
The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_288949]/or 
should continue in the study .
Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must 
make every  effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 telephone 
calls and, if necessary , a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing 
address or local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_14316]’s medical record.
Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study. 
Discontinuation of specific sites or of the study  as a whole are handled as part of 
Appendix 1.

Page 648.STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
Study  procedures and their timing are summarized in the Schedule of Activities. 
Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed.
Immediate safety  concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately  upon 
occur rence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or 
discontinue study  intervention.
Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the 
Schedule of Activities, is essenti al and required for study  conduct. 
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility  criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening 
log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility  or record 
reasons for screening failure, as applicable. Participants will be screened (Visit 1) 
within 28 days prior to administration of the study  intervention to confirm that they  
meet the participant selection criteria for th e study . The investigator (or an 
appropriate delegate at the investigator site) will obtain informed consent from each 
participant, in accordance with the procedures described in Section 10.1.3 . 
Procedures cond ucted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, 
blood count) and obtained before signing of the ICF may  be utilized for screening or 
baseline purposes provided the procedures met the protocol -specified criteria and 
were performed within the time frame defined in the Schedule of Activities.
Screening laboratory  tests with abnormal results may  be repeated once to confirm 
abnormal results; the last value will be used to determine eligibility . If re sults return 
to normal within the 4 -week screening period, the participant may  enter the study .
Due to possible need for [COMPANY_003] testing and chest radiograph, screening procedures 
may be performed over more than 1 visit in the 28 days prior to the Day 1 visit.
Visit windows are based on Day 1 visit. To assure consistency  and reduce 
variability , all study  visits should occur in the morning whenever possible. On day s 
of study  visits, participants will receive their dose at the clinic during the visit. 
Participant s are required to fast for at least 8 hours prior to all visits that include 
lipid profile panel testing (Day 1 and Week 12). During the fasting period, 
participant s should refrain from all food and liquids (water and permitted non -study  
medications are allowed). 
Urine pregnancy  test must be performed prior to dosing with the study  intervention 
for WOCBP through the EOT/EOS visit specified in the Schedule of Activities.
Prior to attending a stud y visit, participant s are allowed to shower and bathe but 
should not moisturize or apply  emollient.

(board certified or equivalent). An experienced and qualified non- dermatologist phy sician or 
experienced medical professional with experience in the conduct of dermatology  clinical 
trials may be permitted to perform the clinical evaluations of AD when designated b y the 
primary  site Invest igator. The evaluator must receive and document protocol specific and 
applicable efficacy  assessment scales training prior to performing these evaluations. To 
assure consistency and reduce variability, the same evaluator must assess all 
dermatological clin ical evaluations for any individual participant throughout the study 
whenever possible ; a back -up experienced and qualified, protocol- trained evaluator will 
only be allowed and documented in case of emergency orspecial situations when the 
designated evalu ator is unable to perform the evaluation.
8.1.2. Skin Biopsies
One 4.5 mm skin biopsy  (punch biopsy ) will be collected from each target lesional skin at 
Baseline/Day 1 (Week 0), Day 29 (Week 4), and Day 85 (Week 12), with an optional 
collection on Day 15 (Week 2). The target lesional skin to be used for skin biopsy  should be 
selected pre -dose at the Baseline/Day 1 visit. An area of non -lesional skin anatomically  
similar in location to the target lesional skin should also be selected for biopsy  on Day 1, 
with optio nal collection on Day 85. Biopsies at all time points following the visit at 
Baseline/Day [ADDRESS_1284462] s be collected from the same area, even if the target treatment area 
has cleared, in order to assess molecular clearance.
Ideally, a single target, approx imately  the size of the palm of the participant’s hand, should 
be identified and the location and borders noted in the clinic chart; anatomical markers 
should be used as needed to describe the target skin location. A photograph of the lesional 
and non- lesional site(s) will also be taken (see Section 8.1.5 ). The target skin should be of 
sufficient size to accommodate the required number of biopsies specified in the protocol 
(eg,3biopsies) while not interfering with the clinical evaluation of the lesion; the potential 
biopsy  sites should be pre -selected. 
The biopsies after Day 1 will be collected in the vicinity  of the torso (upper and mid back, 
chest), abdomen, bu ttocks, upper arms and upper legs, but at least 1 cm distant from where 
the biopsies were collected at Day 1, even if the target lesion has cleared. Target lesions may  
not be located on the head, face, neck, elbows, knees, lower arms, lower legs, genital a rea 
and inguinal area, intertriginous areas, and lower back. 
Each biops y will be cut in half. One half will be used to perform reverse transcriptase 
polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR) and gene array  and the other half will be used for 
immunohistochemistry analy sis.
Details of the biopsies sampling and handling will be described in a separate manual.

8.1.7. Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)
The EASI quantifies the severit y of a participant’s AD based on both severity of lesion 
clinical signs and the percent of BSA affected. EASI  is a composite scoring by  [CONTACT_914161], induration/papulation, excoriation, and 
lichenification (each scored separatel y) for each of four bod y regions, with adjustment for the 
percent of BSA involved for each bod y region and for the proportion of the body region to 
the whole bod y. Assessments will be collected at various time poin ts as described in the 
Schedule of Activities.
Lesion Severity by [CONTACT_74092]: The basic characteristics of AD lesions —erythema, 
induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification—provide a means for assessing the

BSA Efficacy will be derived from the sum of the BSA in handprints across 4 body regions 
assessed as part of the EASI assessment ( Table 4 ). Handprint refers to that of each individual 
participant for their own measurement. The BSA Efficacy ranges from 0 to 100%, with higher values representing greater severity of AD. Assessments will be collected at various time points as described in the Schedule of Activities .
 
 
8.1.9. Patient-reported Outcomes (PROs)
Participants will complete the PROs at the clinic prior to other clinical activities and study 
intervention administration. The PROs should be checked for completeness by [CONTACT_914163]. Compliance with scheduled PROs activities will be monitored. Delegated site staff will oversee the administration of PROs at site visits to ensure protocol compliance. Participants are given a diary to complete the Peak Pruritus NRS and Night Time Itch Scale on a daily basis. Delegated site staff will review compliance at each visit and counsel as appropriate. If a participant has repeated non-compliance, the participant should be re-trained. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)
The severity of itch (pruritus) due to AD will be assessed using the Peak Pruritus NRS, a 
validated horizontal NRS.
21,22Participants will be asked to assess their worst itching due to 
AD over the past 24 hours on an NRS anchored by [CONTACT_80209] “no itch” (0) and “worst itch imaginable” (10). This item will be administered to all participants. Participants will enter Peak Pruritus NRS assessment into a diary.

At the time of screening, all participants will undergo tuberculosis (TB) testing unless 
performed within [ADDRESS_1284473] X -ray (or other 
appropriate diagnostic image (see Section 8.2.3) is recommended.
QFT -G test is an in vitro diagnostic test using a peptide cocktail simulating earl y secretory 
antigen 6 (ESAT -6), cell filtrate protein 10 (CFP -10),and TB 7.7 proteins to stimulate cells 
in heparinized whole blood. Detection of interferon -by [CONTACT_384191]-Linked Immunosorbent 
Assay  (ELISA) is used to identi fy in vitro responses to these peptide antigens that are 
associated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. QFT -G is an indirect test for 
M.tuberculosis infection (including disease) and is intended for use in conjunction with risk 
assessment, radiogra phy and other medical and diagnostic evaluations.
A blood sample (approximately  3mL) will be collected at screening for QTF -G testing. 
Following sample processing, the sample will be shipped to the sponsor’s designated 
reference laboratory  for testing. Th e procedure for processing and preparing the sample for 
shipment is described fully  in the laboratory  manual, which will be provided to investigators.
Should the [COMPANY_003] test be required, the test must be administered and evaluated by  a health care 
professiona l 48to [ADDRESS_1284474] should be performed according to local standards with induration of <5 mm required 
for inclusion.
8.2.5. Special Safety Assessment
In the event of a suspected opportunistic infection, effort should be made to identify  the 
pathogen utilizing laboratory  or other methods appropriate to the clinical situation. 
In case of a suspected viral skin infection (eg, herpes zoster, herpes simplex or eczema 
herpeticum), a specimen for viral DNA may  be analy zed locally  for confirmation and results 
provided to the adjudication committee to support evaluation. 
For participa nts with a past history  of oral or genital herpes simplex virus infection and a 
presentation consistent to prior infections, further laboratory  anal ysis may  be performed at 
the discretion of the investigator.

Screening/Baseline visits and assess the participant’s eligibility  based on the answers. The C -
SSRS will also be administered at post -baseline visits to determine whether it is safe for the 
participant to continue in the trial. Refer to Section 8.2.9 for information on using this tool in 
SIB risk monitoring. When there is a positive response to any  question on the C- SSRS, the 
investigator shou ld determine whether an adverse event has occurred.

The PHQ -8 is a participant -reported questionnaire consisting of 8 items to assess the 
participant’s depression level.27Site staff is to administer the PHQ -[ADDRESS_1284480] 25 mIU/mL will be 
performed at Screening. A urine pregnancy  test will be performed at various time points 
described in the Schedule of Activities to confirm the participant has not become pregnant 
during the stud y. Serum and urine pregnancy test kits will b e provided by  [CONTACT_914164].
A negative pregnancy  test result is required at the Baseline visit before the participant may  
receive the stud y intervention. Pregnancy  tests will also be done whenever 1 menstrual cy cle 
is missed (or when potential pregnancy  is otherwise suspected). Pregnancy tests may  also be 
repeated if requested b y institutional review boards (I RBs)/ethics committees (ECs) or if 
required b y local regulations.
Partici pants who have missed a menstrual period or who show an indeterminate or positive 
result on the urine test may  not progress further in the study until pregnancy is ruled out 
using further diagnostic testing (eg, a negative quantitative serum pregnancy  test conducted 
at a certified laboratory  with a sensitivity of at least 25 mI U/mL).
In the case of a positive confirmed pregnancy , the participant will be withdrawn from 
administration of the study  intervention but may  remain in the study .
8.3.Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 3.
AE will be reported b y the participant (or, when appropriate, b y a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
participant's legall y authorized representative).
The investigator and an y qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible to pursue 
and obtain adequate information both to determine the o utcome and to assess whether it 
meets the criteria for classification as an SAE, or that caused the participant to discontinue 
the study  intervention (see Section 7.1).
In addition, the investigator may  be requested by  [CONTACT_19989] y to obtain specific follow -up 
information in an expedited fashion. 
8.3.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE In formation
The time period for actively  eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection 
period”) for each participant begins from the time the participant provides informed consent, 
which is obtained before the participant’s participation in the s tudy (ie, before undergoing 
any study -related procedure and/or receiving study  intervention), through and including a 
minimum of 28 calendar days; except as indicated below after the last administration of the 
study  intervention.

Page 79Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about 
AEoccurrences.
8.3.3. Follow -up of AEs and SAEs
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each 
participant at subse quent visits/contacts. For each event, the investigator must pursue and 
obtain adequate information until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, 
or the participant is lost to follow- up (as defined in Section 7.3).
In general, follow -up information will include a description of the event in sufficient detail to 
allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of 
possible causality . Any information relevant to the event, such as concomitant medications 
and illnesses, must be provided. In the case of a participant death, a summary  of available 
autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible to [COMPANY_007] Safety . 
Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 3.
8.3.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs
Prompt notification by  [CONTACT_11012] a SAE is essential so that 
legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of participants and 
the safet y of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met.
The sponsor has a legal responsibility  to notify  both the local regulatory  authority  
and other regulatory  agencies about the safet y of a study intervention under clinical 
investigation. The sponsor will comply  with country -specific regulatory  
requirements relating to safet y reporting to the regulatory authority, IRB/ECs, and 
investigators.
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for S[LOCATION_003]Rs according to local 
regulatory  requirements and sponsor policy  and forwarded to investigators as 
necessary .
An investigator who receives S[LOCATION_003]Rs or other specific safet y information (eg, 
summary  or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with 
the SRSD (s) for th e study and will notify  the IRB/EC, if appropriate according to 
local requirements.
8.3.5. Exposure During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and Occupational Exposure

An EDP occurs if: 
A female participant is found to be pregnant while receiving or after discontinuing 
study  intervention.
Afemale is found to be pregnant while being exposed or having been exposed to 
study  intervention due to environmental exposure. Below are examples of 
environmental exposure during pregnancy : 
A female family  member or healthcare provider reports that she is pregnant after 
having been exposed to the study  intervention by  [CONTACT_914166] 24 hours of the investigator’s 
awareness, irrespective of whether an SAE has occurred. The initial information submitted 
should include the anti cipated date of delivery (see below for information related to 
termination of pregnancy). 
If EDP occurs in a participant or a participant’s partner, the investigator must report 
this information to [COMPANY_007] Safety on the CT SAE Report Form and an EDP 
Supple mental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred. Details of the 
pregnancy  will be collected after the start of stud y intervention and until [ADDRESS_1284484] dose.
If EDP occurs in the setting of environmental exposure, the investigator must re port 
information to [COMPANY_007] Safety  using the CT SAE Report Form and EDP Supplemental 
Form. Since the exposure information does not pertain to the participant enrolled in 
the study , the information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy  of the 
completed C T SAE Report Form is maintained in the investigator site file.
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome. The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (o r until pregnancy  termination) and notify  [COMPANY_007] Safet y of the outcome as a 
follow -up to the initial EDP Supplemental Form. In the case of a live birth, the structural 
integrit y of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termina tion, the 
reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically  possible, the structural 
integrit y of the terminated fetus should be assessed by [CONTACT_4692] (unless 
pre-procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are 
reported).
Abnormal pregnancy  outcomes are considered SAEs. If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets 
the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal 
demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y ina live -born bab y, a terminated fetus, an 
intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death), the investigator should follow the procedures

SAEs when the inve stigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly  related to 
exposure to the study  intervention. 
Additional information regarding the EDP may  be requested by  [CONTACT_456]. Further 
follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on 
preterm infants to identify developmental delay s). In the case of paternal exposure, the 
investigator will provide the participant with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information 
Form to deliver to his partner. The investigator must document in the source documents that 
the participant was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his 
partner.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Breastfeeding
Anexposure during breastfeeding occurs if: 
A female participant is found to be breastfee ding while receiving or after 
discontinuing study  intervention.
A female is found to be breastfeeding while being exposed or having been exposed to 
study  intervention (ie, environmental exposure). An example of environmental 
exposure during breastfeeding i s a female family  member or healthcare provider who 
reports that she is breastfeeding after having been exposed to the study  intervention 
by [CONTACT_19991]. 
The investigator must report exposure during breastfeeding to [COMPANY_007] Safety  within 24 hours 
of the investigator’s awareness, irrespective of whether an SAE has occurred. The 
information must be reported using the CT SAE Report Form. When exposure during 
breastfeeding occurs in the setting of environmental exposure, the exposure information does 
not pertain to the participant enrolled in the study , so the information is not recorded on a 
CRF. However, a cop y of the completed CT SAE Report Form is maintained in the 
investigator site file.
An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a [COMPANY_007] drug specificall y 
approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in accord with 
authorized use. However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such a drug, the 
SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding.

9.1.Estimands and Statistical Hypotheses
9.1.1. Estimands
The p rimary  objective of this study  is to assess the effects of abrocitinib on lesional and non-
lesional skin biomarkers of adult participants with moderate- to-severe AD. The following 
estimand attributes will be considered:
Population: Participants with moderate -to-severe AD as defined by  [CONTACT_181244];
Variable: Fold- change from baseline in the biomarkers for general inflammation 
(MMP12), hy perplasia (K16), Th2 immune response (CCL 17, CCL18, CCL26), and 
Th22 immune response (S100A8, S100A9, S100 A12);
Intercurrent event: All data collected will be utilized;
Participants need to have a baseline and week 12 assessment to be included in the 
analysis.
Population -level summary: Mean fold -change from baseline within each treatment 
group .
9.2.Sample Size D etermination
The sample size of this study  is based on the objective to evaluate changes in key  AD 
biomarkers in skin lesions, including biomarkers for general inflammation (MMP12), 
hyperplasia (K16), Th2 (CCL17, CCL 18, CCL26), and Th22 (S100A8, S100A9, S100A12) 
with abrocitinib 200 mg QD, abrocitinib 100 mg QD, and placebo.
A total sample of approximately  51participants, with 17 participants randomized to 
abrocitinib 200mg QD, 17 participants randomized to abrocitinib 100mg QD, 
17participants randomi zed to matching placebo (1:1:1 randomization) is planned.
A sample size of 17 participants per treatment group would provide about 92% chance that 
the 95% CI for the mean fold -change (post -baseline relative to baseline) has a half- width of 
no more than 3.2 (which is within 64% of an assumed maximal standard deviation of 5 for 
the fold-change, as based on published data).28Calculations are based on the assumption of a 
chi-square distribution for the estimated sample variance so that the width of the estimated 
confidence interval is a random quantity .

violation as determined by  [CONTACT_914169]. Participants will be anal yzed according to the 
intervention they  are randomized to.
Safety  Anal ysis Set 
(SAS)All participants who take at least 1 dose of stud y intervention. 
Participants will be analyzed according to the intervention 
they actuall y received. 
9.4. Statistical Analyses
Detailed methodology  for summary  and statistical anal yses of the data collec ted in this study  
is outlined here and further detailed in a statistical anal ysis plan (SAP), which will be 
maintained by  [CONTACT_456]. The SAP may  modify  what is outlined in the protocol where 
appropriate.
The SAP will be developed and finalized before database lock and will describe the 
participant populations to be included in the analy ses, for all endpoints listed in Section 3, 
and procedures for accounting fo r missing data. This section is a summary  of the planned 
statistical analy ses of the primary  and secondary  endpoints.
9.4.1. Analysis of the Primary Endpoint
The population for the primary  anal ysis will be all participants in the FAS having valid 
biomarker data a t baseline and Week 12. 
The primary  endpoints in this study  include mean fold -changes for the following biomarkers: 
General inflammation (MMP12); 
Hyperplasia (K16);

Page 90Th2 (CCL 17, CCL 18, CCL 26); 
Th22 (S100A8, S100A9, S100A12).
In each participant, expression levels from RT- PCR will be normalized to the housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_914145] P0 (validated in other studies) by  [CONTACT_914170] –dCt, 
obtaining an equivalent to log2 scale expression values (reporting unit: log2 
[Expression/RPL P0]). The expression values below detection will be estimated for each gene 
as the 20% of the minimum of unlogged values across all samples (which is equivalent to 
subtracting 2.321928 from the –dCt minimum value). The expression levels below detection 
may provide i mportant information about some markers that significantly  change with 
treatment (eg, the expression may  decrease below the level of detection after treatment), 
therefore this imputation is an important step in the anal ysis. 
RT-PCR expression data in log2 scale will be modeled using a mixed effect model with 
Treatment, Time Point, and Tissue Ty pe as a fixed effect and a random intercept for each 
participant. This model will y ield unbiased estimates and valid inferences in the presence of a 
missing data mec hanism that is missing at random (MAR).29This approach introduces less 
bias than restricting the analy sis for participants with complete observati ons and is consistent 
with estimation of a hy pothetical estimand. Contrasts will be used to estimate the log2 fold -
changes for each treatment group. Fold- changes will be computed by  [CONTACT_914171]2 fold -changes. Point estimates and 95% confid ence intervals (CIs) will be obtained for 
the fold-change from baseline in the biomarker values for each treatment group based on this 
model.
Correlation anal yses will be performed to assess if the fold -change from baseline in 
biomarkers correlates with ch ange (from baseline) in the clinical efficacy  endpoints such as 
IGA, EASI, and Peak Pruritus NRS.
Supportive analy ses for the primary  endpoint will also be performed using the PPAS. 
While statistical tests of hy potheses will not be performed to compare the fold -change from 
baseline in the abrocitinib groups versus placebo, the point estimates and 95% CI s for the 
two abrocitinib dose groups will be assessed in relation to those from the placebo group. A 
fold- change from baseline observed in the abrocitinib groups alone (and correlated with 
efficacy ) but not in the placebo group is likel y due to the mechanism of action of abrocitinib.

If a participant withdraws from the study, then this participant will be considered a 
non-responder after withdrawal for any binary valued clinical efficacy endpoint.
9.4.3. Safety Analyses
All safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Population. The Safety population will 
include any participant receiving ≥[ADDRESS_1284490].
All safety data will be summarized using descriptive statistics. No imputation will be made 
for missing safety data.
All safety data will be summarized descriptively through appropriate data tabulations, 
descriptive statistics, categorical summaries, and graphical presentations. Safety endpoints for the study include:
•Treatment-emergent AEs and SAEs;
•Withdrawals from active treatment due to AEs;
•Serious infections, defined as any infection (viral, bacterial, and fungal) requiring

9.5. Interim Analyses
After the first [ADDRESS_1284491] completed the study, there will be an interim analysis to 
examine platelet values. A longitudinal analysis will be conducted to determine if there is a change from baseline in platelet values. The data will remain blinded so that no one will know the participants’ assigned treatment and thus the analysis will not analyse for any treatment differences. Correlation analyses may also be conducted to look for potential relationships between platelet values . There will not be any decision rules associated with this interim analysis, so there will be no changes to the conduct or continuation of the trial based on these analyses.
9.5.1. Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)
This study will use an E-DMC. The E-DMC is independent of the study team and includes 
only external members. The E-DMC will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the safety of participants in the study according to the charter. 
The recommendations made by [CONTACT_941] E-DMC to alter the conduct of the study will be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_007] for final decision. [COMPANY_007] will forward such decisions, which may include summaries of aggregate analyses of endpoint events and of safety data that are not endpoints, to regulatory authorities, as appropriate. Composition of the E-DMC and processes under which the E-DMC operates will be documented in the E-DMC charter.CCI

participant, temporall y associated with the use of stud y intervention, whether or not 
considered related to the study  intervention.
NOTE: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) 
temporally  associated with the use of stud y intervention.
Events Meeting the AE Definition
Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) 
or other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital sign measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinicall y significant in the 
medical and scientific judgment of the investigator . Any abnormal laboratory test 
results that meet an y of the conditions below must be recorded as an AE:
Is associated with accompany ing s ymptoms;
Requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention;
Leads to a change in study  dosing (outside of any  protocol -specified dose 
adjustments) or discontinuation from the study , significant addition al 
concomitant drug treatment, or other therap y.
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition including either an 
increase in frequency  and/or intensity  of the condition.
New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y intervention administration even 
though it may  have been present before the start of the study .
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  
interventio n or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as 
an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible 
suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of 
sequelae.
Thesigns, s ymptoms, and/or cl inical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy  will be 
reported as an AE or SAE if they  fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE and meet the 
Abrocitinib

Protocol Amendment 3, 11 November 2020
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 106requirements as per Section [IP_ADDRESS] . Also, “lack of efficacy ” or “failure of expected 
pharmacological action” does not constitute an AE or SAE.
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition
Any clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  findings or other abnormal safet y 
assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by  [CONTACT_11009]’s condition.
The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of 
the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the 
participant’s condition.
Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscop y, appendectom y): the condition that 
leads to the procedure is the AE.
Situations in which an untoward medi cal occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) 
present or detected at the start of the study  that do not worsen.
10.3.2. Definition of SAE
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious 
conditions are met (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1080]/symptoms of the disease under study , death 
due to progression of disease).
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:
a.Results in death
b.Is life -threatening
The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically  might have caused death, if it were more severe.
c.Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22770], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19949] (usually 
involving at least an over night stay ) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19950]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the ph ysician’s office or 
outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a 
complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_388333], the event is 
serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary , the AE 
should be considered serious.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre- existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE.

Page 107d.Results in persistent disability/incapacity
The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to conduct 
normal life functions.
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may  interfere with or 
prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
f.Other situations:
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that 
may not be immediatel y life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_402880]. These events 
should usually  be considered serious.
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment 
in an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug 
dependency  or drug abuse.
Suspected transmission via a [COMPANY_007] product of an infectious agent, pathogenic or 
non-pathogenic, is considered serious. The event may  be suspected from clinical 
symptoms or laboratory  findings indicating an infection in a patient exposed to a 
[COMPANY_007] product. The terms “suspected transmission” and “transmission” are 
considered s ynon ymous. These cases are considered unexpected and handled as 
serious expedited cases by [CONTACT_20020]. Such cases are also 
considered for reporting as produc t defects, if appropriate.
10.3.3. Recording/Reporting and Follow -Up of AE and/or SAE
AE and SAE Recording/Reporting
The table below summarizes the requirements for recording adverse events on the CRF 
and for reporting serious adverse events on the CT SAE Report Form to [COMPANY_007] Safet y. 
These requirements are delineated for 3 ty pes of events: (1) SAEs; (2) non- serious adve rse 
events (AEs); and (3) exposure to the study  intervention under study  during pregnancy  or 
breastfeeding, and occupational exposure. 
It should be noted that the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information is not 
the same as the AE page of the CR F. When the same data are collected, the forms must be 
completed in a consistent manner. AEs should be recorded using concise medical

When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility  of the investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory  reports, and diagnostics 
reports) related to the event.
The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF.
It is notacceptable for the investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s 
medical records to [COMPANY_007] Safety  in lieu of completion of the CT SAE Report 
Form/ AE/SAE CRF page.
There may  be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_19952] b y [COMPANY_007] Safety. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the 
exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_19953] .
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not 
the individual signs/sy mptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE .
Assessment of Intensity
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported 
during the stud y and assign it to 1 of the following categories:
Mild: An event that is easily  tolerated by  [CONTACT_2299], causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with every day activities.
Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal 
every day activities.
Abrocitinib
B7451037
Protocol Amendment 3, 11 November 2020
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 109Severe: An event that prevents normal every day activities. An AE that is 
assessed as severe shoul d not be confused with a SAE. Severe is a category  utilized 
for rating the intensit y of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as 
severe.
An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.
Assessment of Causality
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y intervention 
and each occurrence of each AE/SAE.
A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, 
and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot 
be ruled out.
The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.
Alternative causes, such as underl ying disease(s), conc omitant therap y, and other 
risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study  intervention 
administration will be considered and investigated.
The investigator will also consult the IB and/or Product Information, for marketed 
products , in his/her assessment.
For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she 
has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality .
There may  be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has 
minimal information to include in the initial report to the sponsor. However, it is 
very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality 
for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to the sponsor.
The investigator ma y change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_19954] -up 
information and send a SAE follow- up report with the updated causality  
assessment.
The causality  assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory  
reporting requirements.
If the i nvestigator does not know whether or not the study  intervention caused the 
event, then the event will be handled as “related to study  intervention” for reporting 
purposes, as defined b y the sponsor. In addition, if the investigator determines that 
an SAE i s associated with study  procedures, the investigator must record this 
causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, and report such an 
assessment in the dedicated section of the CT SAE Report Form and in accordance 
with the SAE reporting requirement s.

New or updated information will be recorded in the originally  completed CRF.
The investigator will submit any  updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours 
of recei pt of the information.
10.3.4. Reporting of SAEs
SAE Reporting to [COMPANY_007] Safety via an Electronic Data Collection Tool
The primary  mechanism for reporting an SAE to [COMPANY_007] Safety  will be the 
electronic data collection tool.
If the electronic s ystem is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE data 
collection tool (see next section) in order to report the event within 24 hours.
The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic sy stem as soon as the data 
become available.
After the stud y is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will 
be taken off -line to prevent the entry  of new data or changes to existing data.
If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study  participant or receives updated 
data on a previously  reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been 
taken off -line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see 
next section) or to [COMPANY_007] Safety  by [CONTACT_756].
SAE Reporting to [COMPANY_007] Safety via CT SAE Report Form
Facsimile transmission of the CT SAE Report Form is the preferred method to 
transmit this information to [COMPANY_007] Safety .

Definitions:
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
For this study , a female participant is considered fertile (ie WOCBP) starting at 12 y ears of 
age (regardless of whether they  have experienced/reported menarche) unless permanentl y 
sterile (see below).
Women with one of the following are not considered WOCBP
Documented h ysterectomy
Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]
Documented bilateral oophorectom y
For individuals with permanent infertility  due to an alt ernate medical cause other than 
the above, (eg, Müllerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity ), investigator discretion 
should be applied to determining study  entry .
Note: Documentation for any  of the above conditions can come from the site 
personnel’s review of the participant’s medical records, medical examination, or 
medical history  interview. The method of documentation should be recorded in the 
participant’s medical record for the stud y.
Contraception Guidance:
All female participants who are considered W OCBP and who are, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], sexually  active and at risk for pregnancy  with their partner(s) must agree to use 
a highl y effective method of contraception consistently  and correctl y for the duration of the 
active treatment period an d for at least [ADDRESS_1284499] of contraception methods (see below) and will confirm 
that the participant has been instructed in its consistent and correct use. At time points 
indicated in the Sched ule of Activities, the investigator or designee will inform the 
participant of the need to use highl y effective contraception consistentl y and correctly and 
document the conversation and the participant’s affirmation in the participant’s chart 
(participant s need to affirm their consistent and correct use of at least 1 of the selected 
methods of contraception). In addition, the investigator or designee will instruct the 
participant to call immediately  if the selected contraception method is discontinued or i f 
pregnancy  is known or suspected in the participant. 

Abrocitinib

Protocol Amendment 3, 11 November 2020
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 113Highl y effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently  and correctly  (ie, perfect use) and 
include the following:
1.Established use of hormonal methods of contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation (eg, oral, inserted, injected, implanted, transdermal) provided the 
participant plans to remain on the same treatment throughout the entire study and has 
been using that hormonal contraceptive for an adequate period of time to ensure 
effectiveness.
2.Correctly placed copper -containing intrauterine device (IUD). 
NOTE: Sexual abstinence, defined as completel y and persistently  refraining from all 
heter osexual intercourse (including during the entire period of risk associated with the study  
treatments) may  obviate the need for contraception ONLY if this is the preferred and usual 
lifesty le of the participant.
The contraception check is an opportunity  to confirm that contraception, if assigned, is used 
consistently  and correctly . It also facilitates continual reassessment of child- bearing potential 
in women. This allows for implementing necessary changes to contraception; for example, 
investigators may  need to ensure alternative contraceptive methods if new concomitant 
disease contraindicates a selected method of contraception, or if a participant is demonstrably  
no longer of child- bearing status (as per protocol) then they  will no longer require 
contracept ion. Continual reassessment of contraceptive needs is imperative.
Collection of Pregnancy Information:
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during 
pregnancy  (EDP) occurs if:
A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the study  
intervention; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing 
and/or being exposed to the study  intervention;
An e xample of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct 
contact [CONTACT_4490] a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she 
is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatm ent or environmental exposure) to 
the study  intervention prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed 
during his partner’s pregnancy . 
If a participant or participant’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
participant’s trea tment with the study  intervention, the investigator must report this 
information to [COMPANY_007] Safety  on the CT SAE Report Form and an EDP supplemental form, 
regardless of whether an SAE has occurred. In addition, the investigator must submit 
Abrocitinib
B7451037
Protocol Amendment 3, [ADDRESS_1284500] in a pregnant woman (eg, a 
participant reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cytotoxic product b y 
inhalation or spi[INVESTIGATOR_4598]) to [COMPANY_007] Safety  using the EDP supplemental form. This must be done 
irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the 
exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see 
below for information related to termination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome. The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  [COMPANY_007] Safet y of the outcome as a 
follow -up to the initial EDP supplemental form. In the case of a live birth, the structural 
integrit y of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the 
reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically  possible, the structural 
integrit y of the terminated fetus should be assessed by [CONTACT_4692] (unless pre -
procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly  and the findings are 
reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for a n SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live-born bab y, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedure s for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are reported to [COMPANY_007] Safet y as SAEs 
follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;
Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_1284501] to causalit y, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be 
reported as SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or 
possibly  related to exposure to the study  intervention.
Additional information regardin g the EDP may  be requested by  [CONTACT_456]. Further follow-
up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case -by-case basis (eg, follow -up on preterm 
infants to identify  developmental delay s). In the case of paternal exposure, the investigator 
will provide the participant with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to deliver 
to his partner. The investigator must document in the source documents that the participant 
was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his partner.

Page [ZIP_CODE].6. Appendix 6: Liver Safety: Suggested Actions and Follow-up Assessments 
Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury  (as determined by  [CONTACT_20023]) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury , but adapt 
are termed “adaptors.” In some participants, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a 
more serious potential outcome. These participants fail to adapt and therefore are 
"susceptible" to progressive and serious liver injury, commonl y referred to as drug -induced 
liver in jury (DILI). Participants who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 times the 
upper limit of normal (× ULN) should be monitored more frequentl y to determine if they  are 
an “adaptor” or are “susceptible.”
In the majority  of DILI cases, elevations in a spartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) precede total bilirubin (TBili) elevations (>2 × ULN) b y several 
days or weeks. The increase in TBili ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y occurs while AST/ALT is/are still elevated 
above 3 × ULN (ie, AST/AL T and TBili values will be elevated within the same lab sample). 
In rare instances, b y the time TBili elevations are detected, AST/ALT values might have 
decreased. This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI. Therefore, abnormal 
elevations in either AS T OR AL T in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below 
are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy ’s law criteria) cases and should alway s be 
considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury 
have be en excluded.
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the 
participant’s individual baseline values and underlying conditions. Participants who present 
with the following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated fur ther as potential DILI 
(Hy’s law) cases to definitively  determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory  values:
oParticipants with AST/ALT and TBili baseline values within the normal range 
who subsequently  present with AST OR AL T values >3 × ULN AND a TBi li 
value >2 × ULN with no evidence of hemol ysis and an alkaline phosphatase value 
<2×ULN or not available;
oFor participants with baseline AST OR ALT OR TBili values above the ULN, the 
following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, 
depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline:
Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or 
ALT values >2 times the baseline values AND >3 × ULN; or >8 ×ULN 
(whichever is smaller).
Preexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from 
baseline value b y an amount of at least 1 × ULN or if the value reaches >3 × 
ULN (whichever is smaller).
Rises in AST/AL T and TBili separated b y more than a few weeks should be assessed 
individually  based on clinical judgment; an y case where uncertainty  remains as to whether it 
represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the Sponsor. The participant 
should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, preferabl y wit hin 
Abrocitinib
B7451037
Protocol Amendment 3, [ADDRESS_1284502] and AL T and TBili for suspected cases of 
Hy’s Law, additional lab oratory  tests should include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), direct 
and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutam yl transferase (GGT), prothrombin time 
(PT)/international normalized ratio (I NR), total bile acids, and alkaline phosphatase. 
Consideration should also b e given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an 
anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous 
analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology . A detailed 
history , incl uding relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (either b y 
itself or as a coformulated product in prescription or over -the-counter medications), 
recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family  history , sexual history , 
travel history , history  of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, surgery , blood transfusion, history  
of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be 
collected. Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E inf ection and liver imaging 
(eg, biliary  tract) and collection of serum sample for acetaminophen drug and/or protein 
adduct levels may  be warranted.
All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria of AST/AL T and 
TBili elevation def ined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases if no 
other reason for the liver function test (LFT) abnormalities has y et been found. Such 
potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availability 
of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT 
abnormalities.
A potential DILI (Hy ’s law) case becomes a confirmed case onl y after all results of 
reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternative etiol ogy.

inhibitors or inducers. The longest half- life should be used to calculate the period necessary  
to washout a medication prior to the first dose of study  intervention . For example, fluoxetine 
and its metabolite norfluoxetine are both inhibitors of CYP2C19. The terminal half -life of 
fluoxetine is up to 6 day s. However, norfluoxetine has a longer half -life, up to 16 days. 
Therefore, the washout period should be calculate d based on the 5 times the half -life of

Page [ZIP_CODE].10. Appendix 10: Monitoring and Discontinuation Criteria
Monitoring Criteria 
The following laboratory abnormalities require prompt retesting:
Neutrophil counts <1000 neutrophils/mm3; confirmed promptly  by [CONTACT_15013], 
ideally  within 3 -5days; 
Platelet counts <75,000 platelets/mm3; confirmed promptly  by [CONTACT_15013], ideally  
within 3 -5days; 
Any single hemoglobin value <9.0 g/dL or one that drops  2g/dL below baseline; 
confirmed promptl y by [CONTACT_15013], ideall y within 3-5 day s; 
Any single AST and/or AL T elevation >3 times the upper limit of normal regardless 
of accompan ying symptoms or the total bilirubin should prompt repeat testing. This 
should also prompt review of Appendix 6(Liver Safety ); additional investigations 
must be conducted.
Temporary Interruption to Dosing
Temporary  interruption to dosing is not allowed in this study , except when specified in the 
protocol for participant safet y.
Discontinuation Criteria
Participants must b e permanently  discontinued from treatment if they  meet any  of the 
following criteria at an y point in the study :
Marked prolongation of the QTcF interval to >500 ms or >60 ms change from 
screening ECG. 
Serious infection (see definition for Serious Adverse Events in Section 10.3.2 ) must 
result in temporary  interruption of study  intervention. Study  intervention cann ot be 
restarted until the serious infection has resolved, and this has been discussed and 
agreed with the [COMPANY_007] medical monitor. If the participant cannot be restarted on study  
intervention within [ADDRESS_1284510] be permanently  discontinued from study  intervention. 
Any bleeding event thought to be associated with a platelet count reduction per the 
judgement of the investigator ( or, if necessary /desired, following discussion with 
sponsor) .
Adverse event, per judgment of the investigator, requiring discontinuation from 
treatment (or, if necessary/desired, following discussion with sponsor).

Page 126NOTE: an y initial lab value below must be retested within 48 hours.
Two sequential platelet counts <50,000/mm3. If the participant has a platelet count 
<25,000/mm3, study  intervention should be temporarily  withheld pending the 
confirmatory  retest.
Two sequential neutrophil cou nts <500/mm3.
Two sequential l ymphocy te counts <500/mm3.
Two sequential hemoglobin assessments <8.0 g/dL and / or a decrease of >30% from 
baseline value .
Any of the following :
Two sequential AST or AL T elevations >[ADDRESS_1284511] one total bilirubin value >2 times the upper limit of normal.
Two sequential AST or AL T elevations >3 times the upper limit of normal with 
an abnormal international normalized ratio (INR).
Two sequential AST or AL T elevations >3 times the upper limit of normal 
accompanied b y symptoms consistent with hepatic injury .
Two sequential AST or AL T elevations >5 times the upper limit of normal, 
regardless of total bilirubin or accompan ying symptoms.
NOTE: An y of the above findings should prompt review of “The Potential Cases of 
Drug -Induced Liver Injury,” Appendix 6forwhich additional investigations must be 
conducted.
Two sequential increases in serum creatinine that are >50% over the average of 
screening and baseline va lues AND an absolute increase in serum creatinine 
0.5mg/dL. At the time of study  completion or discontinuation, if a participant 
should exhibit elevations in serum creatinine 33% above the average of screening 
and baseline values, they will be re- tested every  1 to 2 weeks until the serum 
creatinine elevation is fully  reversed to within 10% of the average of screening and 
baseline values or has stabilized.
Having met Discontinuation Criteria, the participant must be permanentl y withdrawn from 
treatment, h ave their end of treatment visit, and will then enter the 4- week follow -up period. 
Additional individual participant safet y monitoring, including laboratory testing or 
unscheduled stud y visits, in addition to these guidelines is at the discretion of the i nvestigator 
and dependent on an y perceived safet y concerns. Unscheduled laboratory testing through the 
central laboratory  may  be obtained at an y time during the stud y to assess such concerns.

Page 127If a participant has a clinically  significant, treatment emerge nt, abnormality at the time of 
withdrawal from the study, the [COMPANY_007] clinician (or designee) should be notified and every  
effort should be made to arrange follow- up evaluations at appropriate intervals to document 
the course of the abnormality . All abnorma l laboratory  events of clinical significance should 
be followed until the laboratory  values have returned to normal or baseline levels or are 
deemed clinicall y stable. Follow -up for abnormal laboratory  findings and adverse events by  
[CONTACT_914174] a level 
acceptable to the investigator, and [COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.

Thealternative study  measures described in this section areto be followed during public 
emergencies, including the COVID -19 pandemic. This appendix applies for theduration of 
the COVID -19 pandemic globall y or specific location(s) and will b ecome effective for other 
public emergencies onl y upon written notification from [COMPANY_007]. 
Use of these alternative study  measures are expected to cease upon the return of business as 
usual circumstances (including the lifting of an y quarantines and travel bans/advisories). 
10.13.1. Telehealth Visits
In the event that in-clinic study  visits cannot be conducted, every  effort should be made to 
follow up on the safet y ofstudy participants at scheduled visits per the Schedule of 
Activities or unscheduled visits. Telehealth visits may  be used to continue t o assess 
participant safety  and collect data points. Telehealth includes the exchange of healthcare 
information and services via telecommunication technologies (e.g., audio, video, video -
conferencing software) remotely , allowing the participant and the inv estigator to 
communicate on aspects of clinical care, including medical advice, reminders, education, and 
safet y monitoring. The following assessments must be performed during a telehealth visit: 
Review and record stud y intervention(s), including complian ce and missed doses.
Review and record an y AEs and SAEs since the last contact. Refer to Section 8.3.
Review and record an y new c oncomitant medications or changes in concomitant 
medications since the last contact.
Review and record contraceptive method and results of pregnancy testing. Confirm that 
the participant is adhering to the contraception method(s) required in the protocol. Refer 
to Appendix 4 and Section 8.2.10 of this appendix regarding pregnancy  tests.
Review Patient- Reported Outcomes (PROs) and C -SSRS.
Study  participants must be reminded to promptl ynotify site staff about an y change in their 
health status.
10.13.2. Alternative Facilities for Safety Assessments
[IP_ADDRESS]. Laboratory Testing
If a stud y participant is una ble to visit the site for protocol- specified safety  laboratory  
evaluations, testing may beconducted at a local laboratory  if permitted by [CONTACT_13125]. The local laboratory  may  be a standalone institution or within a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. All 
safet y laboratory tests required per protocol could be done at local labs with an exception of 
hs-CRP test to avoid the risk of potential unblinding.
If a local laboratory  is used, qualified stud y site personnel must order, receive, and review 
results. Site staff must collect thelocal laboratory  reference ranges and certifications/ 

Abrocitinib
B7451037
Protocol Amendment 3, [ADDRESS_1284512] results are to be provided to the site staff 
as soon as possible.  The local laboratory  reports should be filed in the participant’s source 
documents/medical records. Relevant data from the local laboratory  report should 
be recorded on the CRF.  
If a participant requiring pregnancy  testing cannot visit a local laboratory  for pregnancy  
testing, a home urine pregnancy  testing kit with a sensitivity  of at least 25 mI U/mL may  be 
used by  [CONTACT_22860], if compliant with local regulatory  
requirements. The pregnancy  test outcome should be documented in the participant’s source 
documents/medical records and relevant data r ecorded on the CRF. Confirm that the 
participant is adhering to the contraception method(s) required in the protocol. 
10.13.3. Study Intervention
If the safet y of a trial participant is at risk because they cannot complete required evaluations 
or adhere to criti cal mitigation steps, then discontinuing that participant from study  
intervention must be considered.
Study  intervention may beshipped by [CONTACT_914175]. [COMPANY_007] does not permit the shipment of study  intervention by [CONTACT_2319]. The tracking 
record of shipments and the chain of custody  ofstudy  intervention must be kept in the 
participant’s source documents/medical records. 
10.13.4. H ome Health Visits
A home health care visit may beperformed to facilitate scheduled visits per the Schedule of 
Activities. Home health visits include a healthcare provider conducting an in -person study  
visit at the participant’s location, rather than an i n-person stud y visit at the site. The 
following may  be performed during a home health visit:
Review and record stud y intervention(s), including compliance and missed doses.
Review and record an y AEs and SAEs since the last contact. Refer to Section 8.3.
Review and record an y new concomitant medications or changes in concomitant 
medications since the last contact.
Physical exam and targeted phy sical exam.
Clinical AD assessments.
Vital sign measurements.
Review and record contraceptive method and results of pregnancy testing. Confirm that 
the participant is adhering to the contraception method(s) required in the protocol. Refer 
to Appendix 4 and Section 8.2.10 of this appendix regarding pregnancy  tests.

10.13.5. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
If a participant has COVID-19 during the study, this should be reported as an adverse event 
(AE) or serious adverse events (SAE) and appropriate medical intervention provided. Temporary discontinuation of the study intervention may be medically appropriate until the participant has recovered from COVID-19. 
It is recommended that the investigator discuss temporary or permanent discontinuation of 
study intervention with the study medical monitor. 
10.13.6. Efficacy Assessments
The IGA and EASI efficacy assessments may be assessed by a qualified rater as part of a 
home health care visit, but cannot be completed as part of a TeleHealth visit. 
PROs may be completed as part of a home health care visit or a TeleHeath visit.10.13.7. Independent Oversight Committees
The Data Monitoring Committee will be informed of considerations during Public Health
Emergencies such as COVID-[ADDRESS_1284513] participant participation, participant safety,or study operations.CCI

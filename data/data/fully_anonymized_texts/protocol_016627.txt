VV-SUB -066638  – 1.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Dose Adjustment Parameters : 
Individual doses may be adjusted based on AEs and IGF -1 SDS as 
outlined in Figure  3 and Figure  4 (Section  9.6.1 ) and according to the 
dose levels indicated in Table  3 and Table  4.  
Dose Reduction and Possible Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] :  
The investigator may stop or reduce t he dose of the study drug for an 
individual subject as per the dosing algorithms shown in Figure  3 and 
Figure  4, as well as at any time during the trial for the following 
reasons:  
• HbA 1c levels:  
− Subjects without diabetes diagnosis at trial start: In case the 
HbA1c level is > 6.5 % and / or has an absol ute increase of 
0.8 % from the prior visit HbA1c: Confirmation of HbA1c 
level is required. Once confirmed, the study drug  dose 
(lonapegsomatropin /placebo or  daily somatropin product ) 
may be decreased to the next lower dose level (see Table  3 
and Table  4) or a diet / nutritional counseling and / or 
diabetes medication may be added per investigator 
judgement. If appropriate follow -up monitoring shows 
progressively worsening glucose intolerance,  additional 
lonapegsomatropin dose adjustments may be appropriate  
− Subjects with diabetes diagnosis at trial start: additional 
diabetes medication may be added as considered appropriate 
by [CONTACT_093]  
− Severe hGH -related AEs  
Required Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_221383]:  
• Evidence of severe hypersensitivity to  the study drug  
• Confirmed neutralizing anti -hGH antibodies  
• Evidence of tumor growth or new onset malignancy  
• Evidence of progression or new onset retinopathy  
• Pregnancy  
If in any case treatment should be discontinued, all subsequent visits 
and assessments should continue as planned. If the only option for the 
subject is to drop -out of the trial, t he subject may also be offered to 
only attend the final Visit 7.  
For subjects who discontinue the study drug for reasons related to 
safety, unblinding of the treatment assignment for the subject may 
occur if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_13637] a pot ential safety 
signal or by [CONTACT_221428].

VV-SUB -066638  – 1.[ADDRESS_266006]  Name: [CONTACT_221490] . 
Lonapegsomatropin is a long-acting prodrug of somatropin, such that 
the growth hormone released maintains the same mode of action, 
including receptor -binding affinity, as daily GH; the difference is that 
it delivers a pharmacodynamically optimized hGH exposure profile 
over the c ourse of a week.  
Lonapegsomatropin consists of a parent drug, somatropin, that is 
transiently bound to a methoxypolyethylene glycol carrier (4 x 10 
kDa mPEG) via a proprietary TransCon Linker. The carrier extends 
the duration of somatropin in the systemic circulation through a 
shielding effect that minimizes renal excretion and receptor -mediated 
clearance. At physiologic pH and temperature, lonapegsomatropin 
releases fully active, unmodified somatropin via autocleavage of the 
TransCon Linker in a controlled  manner that follows first -order 
kinetics.  
Lonapegsomatropin  will be provided as a lyophilized powder in 
single -use glass vials requiring reconstitution with 1 mL sterile water 
for injection (sWFI) and administered by [CONTACT_6567] (SC) injection 
via syring e and needle.  
Lonapegsomatropin  will be supplied in 2 vial presentations that, after 
reconstitution, will result in 2 solutions  with two concentrations : 
1. 12.1 mg hGH/vial ( mg hGH/mL after reconstitution) .  
2. 24.2 mg hGH/vial ( mg hGH/mL after reconstitution) . 
REFERENCE 
PRODUCT(S)  Placebo  for Lonapegsomatropin  drug product, weekly

The placebo  for lonapegsomatropin  drug product will contain the 
same excipi[INVESTIGATOR_221384]. It will be provided in vials . 
TREATMENT 
REGIMENS  Due to the different hGH dose requirements, depending on subject’s 
age and concomitant use of oral estrogen, this trial will have three 
dosing groups per arm.  
Subjects will  be initiated  on a low dose , and the dose will slowly be 
increase d to avoid adverse reactions as much as possible (Dose 
Titration Period ) until the  target  maintenance  dose is reached (Dose 
Maintenance Period ).  
All treatments will be administered by [CONTACT_221429], or subject. The 
relevant  dosing regimens for o nce-weekly  treatment arms 
(lonapegsomatropin and placebo)  and for daily somatropin treatment 
arm are displayed in the tables below .

algorithm will be provided by [CONTACT_221430] .  
Blinding of a weekly study drug ( lonapegsomatropin  or placebo ) 
versus daily comparator (daily somatropin product)  is no t considered 
feasible . However, critical assessors ( selected Sponsor  team 
member s, central vendors and other personnel as appropriate  and 
feasible ) will be kept blinded  to all treatment assignment s to 
minimize bias  prior to database lock and trial unblinding . The central 
reader for DXA scans will be blinded to the treatment arm throughout 
the trial.   
TRIAL  AND 
TREATMENT 
DURATION  The total duration of the trial for an individual subject is up to 
approximately 48 weeks (up to 6  weeks for screening + 12 weeks 
dose titration + 26 weeks stable treatment  + 4 weeks of follow -up 
treatment free period ; The timelines may include approx. 1 week 
between screening and treatment period to allow for logistics and 
shipments).  The t reatment free f ollow -up period is not applicable for 
subjects continuing into the extension trial.  
End of trial is defined as the last subject last visit.  
STATISTICAL 
METHODS  The efficacy analyses will be conducted using an Intent -To-Treat 
population defined as all randomized subjects who have received any 
amount of the study drug and subjects will be analyzed by [CONTACT_221431].  
The Safety Analysis Set will include  all randomized subjects who 
have receive d at least one dose of  the study dr ug, subjects will be 
analyzed by [CONTACT_221432] . 
The PK/PD Analysis set will include all randomized subjects who 
have received at least one dose of the study drug and have post-
randomization  PK/PD data, subjects will be analyzed by [CONTACT_221433].  
In general, data from clinical assessments will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics.

The ANCOVA model will include treatment arm and dose group as 
factor s, baseline trunk percent fat as a covariate and additional factors 
that may include  region (Japan vs.  all regions except Japan ), baseline 
age group,  sex, concomitant oral estrogen at screening (yes vs. no), 
diabetes m ellitus (yes vs . no), and AGHD onset (adult vs . childhood). 
The daily somatropin product arm will be included in the ANCOVA 
model , but no formal statistical testing will be performed on this arm.  
The 95% confidence  intervals will be calculated for the mean  
treatment difference s between lonapegsomatropin vs. placebo  and 
lonapegsomatropin vs. daily somatropin . 
Similar ANCOVA models  with multiple imputation  will be applied 
to analyze secondary efficacy endpoints, with corresponding baseline 
value as a covariate . 
To control familywise error rate at level of 0.05, the secondary 
endpoints will be  adjusted by  [CONTACT_221434] (lonapegsomatropin vs. placebo)  is statistically

Reporting of the safety da ta will be descriptive. The safety 
parameters include AEs, clinical laboratory, immunogenicity data, 
vital sign s, ECG parameters , and other safety parameters.  
Details of statistical methods will be provided in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan ( SAP).  
SAMPLE  SIZE 
DETERMINATION  This trial is powered for the efficacy comparison of 
lonapegsomatropin  versus placebo . The daily somatropin product arm 
is included as a calibration arm and not powered for formal  
comparison.  
Approximately 240 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_266010].   
A sample size of 80 subjects per arm in the lonapegsomatropin  and 
placebo  arms will provide 90% power to detect a treatment d ifference 
of 1.9% between once -weekly lonapegsomatropin  and placebo  for the 
primary endpoint of change from baseline in trunk percent fat at 
Week 38 at the 2  sided 5%  significance  level, with the assumption of 
a common SD of 3.7%.

5.1. ADULT GROWTH HORMONE  DEFICIENCY   
Growth hormone (GH; somatotropin) is a product of endocrine secretion of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_221385]  (via IGF -1) 
effects . In adipose tissue, GH is lipolytic and protects against hypoglycemia, and opposes the 
effects of IGF -1 (lipogenesis and reduced blood sugar). Growth hormone also has direct effects 
and indirect effect s on bone metabolism, including on  osteoblast proliferation and bone mineral 
density/bone accumulation  (Olney  2003 ). New research continues to reveal other potential roles 
of GH, including regulation of cardiac and immune function, mental agility, and aging.  
Adult growth hormone deficiency  (AGHD) results from insufficient GH secretion from the 
anterior pi[INVESTIGATOR_221386] a continuation of childhood -onset GHD or GHD 
acquired during adulthood. The primary etiology  for adult -onset GHD is damage to the 
hypothalamic -pi[INVESTIGATOR_221387] (Yuen  2019 ). 
Severe GHD has also been reported following treatment for acromeg aly (Ronchi  2009 ) or 
Cushing’s disease (Hughes  1999 ). 
Clinically, AGHD is associated with central adiposity, diminished lean muscle mass, de creased 
bone mass, and reduced quality of life (Melmed  2019 ). Additional clinical features of untreated 
GHD include dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis, which predispose this 
patient population to metabolic syndrome (Attanasio  2010 ) and significantly increase their 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (Gazzaruso  2014).  
GH replacement therapy represents standard of care treatment that addresses multiple aspects of 
the condition (Ho 2007 , Molitch  2011 , Japan  Endocrine  Society  2019 , Yuen  2019 , Kim 2020 ). In 
particular, the lipolytic a nd anabolic actions of GH have been shown to confer beneficial effects 
on body composition across multiple trials (Møller  2009 , Newman  2015 ). GH has also 
demonstrated important effects on bone mineral density (Snyder  2007 ) in longer term studies. 
Finally, quality of life improvements have been noted by [CONTACT_1962]’ partners following initi ation of 
GH therapy (Burman  1995 ).  
Compliance with daily somatropin products in adults with GHD has been reported to be 
suboptimal. Based on survey data for 158 adults with GHD, the rate of non -compliance with GH 
therapy has been estimated to be 65% (Rosenfeld  2008 ). 
5.2. LONAPEGSOMATROPIN   
Lonapegsomatropin (ACP -011, TransCon hGH) is a long -acting prodrug  of somatropin (hGH) , 
designed to maintain the same mode of action and distribution as daily somatropin products , but 
with a once -weekly injection. Lonapegsomatropin consists of a parent drug, somatropin , that is 
transiently conjugated  to a methoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG) carrier (4   10 kDa mPEG) via 
a proprietary TransCon Linker ( Figure  1). The car rier has a shielding effect that minimizes renal 
excretion and receptor -mediated clearance  of lonapegsomatropin . At physiologic pH and 
temperature, lonapegsomatropin releases fully active, unmodified hGH via autocleavage of the 
TransCon Linker in a control led manner that follows first -order kinetics.

VV-SUB -066638  – 1.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Figure  1: Structure of Lonapegsomatropin (ACP -011) 
 
Abbreviations: PEG10 -OMe: 10 kDa methoxypolyethylene chain . 
Human GH released from lonapegsomatropin has the same mode  of action, volume of 
distribution, and cellular signaling as endogenous GH.  The advantage of lonapegsomatropin in 
comparison to daily hGH, is the sustained exposure to hGH during the weekly dosing interval, 
which enhances delivery of hGH into target tissu es and  is important for optimal efficacy . Upon 
linker cleavage and release of hGH, a small molecular weight molecule, 
, is also liberated but has shown to be  rapi[INVESTIGATOR_221388]. After relea se of hGH, the remainder of the linker remains 
covalently bound to mPEG and is cleared from the body primarily through renal clearance, as 
known for other high molecular weight molecules.   
A predecessor molecule to lonapegsomatropin, ACP -001, contained a 4  x 20 kDa branched -chain 
mPEG moiety as the inactive carrier in the prodrug. Early clinical (Phase 1 and Phase 2) trials 
have been completed with this predecessor molecule. Subsequently, a change in the molecular 
weight (decrease) of the inactive branched -chain mPEG carrier molecule was introduced to 
generate lonapegsomatropin (ACP -011), the current version in development. This molecule 
contains the same hGH and TransCon Linker moieties as those incorporated into ACP -001. The 
only difference between the mol ecules is limited to the molecular weight of the inactive 
branched -chain mPEG carrier molecule, which is [ADDRESS_266026]; an extensive noncli nical and clinical program demonstrated biologic comparability  of 
ACP -001 and lonapegsomatropin.

VV-SUB -066638  – 1.[ADDRESS_266027] been conducted to support the clinical 
development program involving weekly subcutaneously administration of lonapegsomatropin  
(ACP -011) in adults  with growth hormone deficiency.  All pi[INVESTIGATOR_221389] (GLP) 
and the program as a whole follow ed recommendations provided by [CONTACT_221435]. The nonclinical pr ogram has assessed both the parent 
prodrug and the products of autocleavage (hGH, the remainder mPEG -linker, and  as 
well as IGF -1, a biomarker for hGH.  
Please refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure for detailed information pertaining to the 
nonclinical program supporting conduct of this clinical trial.  
5.4. CLINICAL EXPERIENCE   
The clinical development program for lonapegsomatropin and its predecessor molecule, 
ACP -001, incl udes a total of 8 completed clinical trials: four Phase 1 trials, two Phase 2 trials, 
and two Phase 3 trials. The Phase 3 trials (TransCon hGH CT -301, TransCon hGH CT -301EXT, 
TransCon hGH CT -302) evaluated lonapegsomatropin for pediatric GHD . Please refer to the 
current Investigator’s Brochure for detailed information pertaining to these trials.  
In adults with GHD, a Phase 2, randomized, open -label, active -controlled trial of three different 
doses (ACP -001 0.02 mg hGH/kg, 0.04  mg hGH/kg and 0.08 mg hGH/kg)  of 
ACP -001 administered weekly was compared to a daily hGH (Omnitrope 0.04 mg hGH/kg/week 
divided into 7 equal daily doses ) over a period of 4 weeks. A total of 37 subjects were 
randomized and dosed. ACP -001 was safe and well -tolerated at all 3 doses administered during 
the study. There was no marked difference in the number of AEs (AEs)  and injection site 
reactions experience d by [CONTACT_221436] -001 compared to those reported by [CONTACT_221437], including no reported lipoatrophy or nodule formation at the 
injection  site. Additionally, once -weekly administration of ACP -001 over a period of 4 weeks 
stimulated a dose -proportional response of IGF -1 at all 3 dose levels investigated in this study. 
Finally, treatment with ACP -001 0.04 mg hGH/kg/week, stimulated a similar IGF -1 response 
(AUEC) after 4 weeks of treatment to the corresponding dose of daily hGH (Omnitrope) given in 
this study, indicating that ACP -001 is as potent as daily hGH on corresponding weekly dose 
levels.  Additional results for this trial may be found in the Investigator’s Brochure and  have been  
published (Höybye  2017 ). 
In healthy adults, two Phase 1 clinical trials (ACP -[ADDRESS_266028]-102) 
have been completed  with lona pegsomatropin . ACP -[ADDRESS_266029]-102, lonapegsomatropin was 
bioequivalent in terms of hGH PK (C max and AUC) and IGF -1 PD (E max and AUEC) response 
when administered via GH A uto-Injector vs . syringe and needle.  
In children with GHD, two Phase [ADDRESS_266030] been completed  with lonapegsomatropin . 
The pi[INVESTIGATOR_53881] 3 trial ( TransCon hGH CT -301, heiGHt ) in treatment -naïve prepubertal 
children with GHD demonstrated once -weekly lonapegsomatropin (0.24  mg hGH/kg/week) was 
superior to daily hGH  (Genotropin 0.24 mg hGH/kg /week divided into 7 equal daily doses) for 
the primary endpoint of annualized height velocity (AHV)  at 52  weeks.

TCH -306, Version  4.0, 02 Jun  2022   Page 34 of 106 
VV-SUB -066638  – 1.0  CONFIDENTIAL  No serious adverse event ( SAEs ) related to study drug were observed in either arm. No 
treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) leading to di scontinuation of study drug were 
observed in either arm. A low incidence of low -titer non -neutralizing antibodies w as observed , 
comparable to that seen with daily somatropin therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
The single -arm Phase 3 trial ( TransCon hGH CT -302, fliGHt ) in predominantly 
treatment -experienced prepubertal children with GHD demonstrated safety and efficacy when 
switching from a daily hGH product to once -weekly lonapegsomatropin  (0.24 mg 
hGH/kg/week) . No drug -related discontinuations or drug -related SAEs were ob served. A low 
incidence of low -titer non -neutralizing antibodies was observed. For both TransCon hGH  
CT-[ADDRESS_266031]-302, the AE profile of lonapegsomatropin was similar to the 
published safety profile of daily GH therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   
The open -label, sin gle-arm Phase 3 extension trial (TransCon hGH CT -301EXT, enliGHten) is 
investigating the long -term safety and efficacy in children from the Phase [ADDRESS_266032] 
been detected to date. The study is ongoing.  
Overall Clinical Summary:  
Across lonapegsomatropin and ACP -[ADDRESS_266033] been  no AEs that led to discontinuation of the study drug,  no suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]RS), and no  neutralizing anti -hGH antibodies  detected . The general 
safety and tolerability profile have  been consistent with that seen with daily -administered 
somatropin  products. Injection site reactions  have generally been mild and transient and have 
been observed at a rate similar to that for daily somatropin . Maximum hGH serum  
concentration s have been  comparable between equivalent weekly hGH doses of 
lonapegsomatropin  and daily somatropin .  
5.5. TRIAL RATIO NALE   
The primary objective of this  trial is to assess the efficacy  of once -weekly lonapegsomatropin  
compared to placebo  in adults  with GHD.  The daily somatropin product arm is included to 
provide a concurrent assessment of standard of care in this patient population. GHD in adults is 
associated with central adiposity, diminished lean muscle mass, decreased bone mass, and 
reduced quality of lif e (Melmed  2019 ), and GH replacement therapy represents standard of care 
treatment that addresses multiple aspects of the condition (Ho 2007 , Molitch  2011 , 
Japan  Endocrine  Society  2019 , Yuen  2019 , Kim 2020 ). Changes in body composition are 
therefore an objective and sensitive endpoint that reflects biologic activity of GH  and clinical 
efficacy . In similar placebo -controlled trials reporting tru nk percent fat over a six -month period 
in patients with AGHD, the observed treatment effect for somatropin products has varied 
from -1.53% to -3.50%  (Norditropin  US PI, Saizen  US PI, Zomacton  US PI, Omnitrope  US PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_221390]). Although there is no consensus guideline to suggest a minimally 
important reduction for trunk percent  fat (Hamdy  2006 ), a change from baseline in trunk percent 
fat of 1.9% will be cl inically meaningful as it represents a significant reduction in the  key 
visceral adipose compartment  that is metabolically important .

TCH -306, Version  4.0, 02 Jun  2022   Page 35 of 106 
VV-SUB -066638  – 1.0  CONFIDENTIAL  In addition to assessing  efficacy, a  treatment  duration of approx. 9  months is considered adequate 
to assess safety and i s supported by [CONTACT_65357] -characterized safety of daily somatropin products 
for AGHD  and extensive clinical experience for lonapegsomatropin for pediatric GHD  at higher 
doses (approximately  2-6 fold based on weight ) than used in AGHD . 
To assess long -term safe ty and efficacy, an open -label extension trial is planned. During the 
extension trial, all subjects will receive lonapegsomatropin . 
5.6. POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS   
Lonapegsomatropin  is an investigational medicinal  hGH prodrug product with a proposed 
once -weekly dosing regimen designed to overcome the inconvenience and suboptimal 
compliance of daily hGH injections . The safety and efficacy profile are anticipated to be 
comparable to currently approved daily hGH products, while maintaining exposure (C max and 
AUC) in the optimal therapeutic range . Moreover, the  exposure to hGH during the weekly 
dosing interval is anticipated to enhance delivery of hGH into target tissues and optimize 
efficacy . Obviating the need for daily injections should increase compliance and therefore 
long-term efficacy, which would be of great benefit to adult  patients with GHD .  
The safety of the subjects will be monitored by [CONTACT_221438]. 
Stop rules have been defined in the protocol. There are no high risk procedures required and the 
measurement of the endpoint by [CONTACT_751] -x-ray-absorptiometry (DXA) can be considered standard of 
care and is only associated with very low x -ray expos ure. 
In conclusion, the risk -benefit assessment for this trial is considered to be acceptable based on 
nonclinical, already gained clinical experience and safety data in the pediatric populations, the 
fact that no harming study procedures are implemented, and the fact that somatropin has been 
approved and used for over [ADDRESS_266034] timeframe for this being 6 months maintenance 
(final stable dose) treatment which is commonly considered ac ceptable and follows similar 
recent clinical development programs. In addition, a double -blinded study can only be conducted 
using weekly administered placebo/comparator as lonapegsomatropin is administered weekly.  
AGHD is caused by [CONTACT_221439]. The reasons for this insufficient 
production of GH include and are not limited to  structural, infiltrative or degenerative disease in 
the hypothalamus / pi[INVESTIGATOR_304], hypothalamic -pi[INVESTIGATOR_221370], radiation after brain tumor, 
geneti c disorder or traumatic brain injury  (TBI) . AGHD is not an acute condition, and in contrast 
to cortisol and thyroid hormone deficiencies not life threatening. Symptoms of AGHD are 
nonspecific (e.g. decrease in lean body mass and bone mineral density), metabolism and quality 
of life are negatively affected and establishing the diagnosis is challenging and complex.  
Standard treatment of AGHD is replacement therapy (substitution) with GH, injected on a daily 
basis. Depending on the underlying cause, treatm ent mostly starts with quite some distance from 
the “event” (e.g. TBI, surgery, or radiation) and diagnosis to ensure stable replacement of other 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_221391].

VV-SUB -066638  – 1.[ADDRESS_266035] discontinued GH treatment for reason s unrelated to the study can be enrolled.  
The up to 48-week treatment -free period ( up to 6  weeks screening , 38 weeks treatment on 
placebo , and 4 weeks follow -up) is not considered to be harmful for the patients or causing 
significant deterioration of the c ondition or affecting effects of future GH treatment. The clinical 
manifestations of GHD are mainly of a metabolic nature: increased fat mass, decrease in muscle 
mass and bone mineral density, decrease in muscle strength, hypercholesterolemia, decrease in 
basal metabolic rate , sleep disturbances, and psychological disturbances. These clinical 
manifestations do not affect patient safety and are reversible under GH treatment, hence not 
considered causing any longer -term harm for patients. This was also conclu ded in a recently 
published study by [CONTACT_221440]  (Postma  2020) .  
Furthermore, during the study, the patients will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_221441].  
All patients completing  this study will be offered to participate in a n open -label extension study 
on once -weekly lonapegsomatropin treatment.  
In conclusion, the placebo arm is needed and justified to conduct a double -blind ed study and to 
demonstrate a robust treatment effect fo r lonapegsomatropin. The p lacebo arm is considered 
standard in AGHD studies without causing long -term harm to patients, diminishing future GH 
treatment effects, or posing a safety risk. None of the subjects are supposed to discontinue GH 
treatment as the s tudy only includes subjects not treated with GH for the last 12 months or newly 
diagnosed with AGHD.  
5.6.2.  Risks Associated with the COVID -19 Pandemic   
Lonapegsomatropin is a long-acting prodrug that liberates somatropin and is believed not to 
cause immunosuppression. Therefore, the risk of subjects be ing exposed to SARS‑CoV‑2 or 
suffer ing from COVID‑[ADDRESS_266036] will be based on the risk 
assessment performed by [CONTACT_1034]. The risk assessment will, as applicable , include a risk 
assessment of each individual trial particip ant. In case of local COVID -19 outbreaks several 
mitigating actions can be applied to ensure patient safety and data integrity: Recruitment and 
randomization can be postponed. For subjects already included in the study, site visits can be 
replaced by [CONTACT_221442] e contacts as phone calls or virtual meetings, safety lab and assessments can be 
done locally, and study medication can be sent directly to the home of the subjects.

7.1.2.  Measures Taken to Minimize Bias   
Once all data and results determining the subject eligibility are available and reviewed by [CONTACT_159857], the subject will be centrally randomized  to 1 of 3 treatment 
arms : either once -weekly l onapegsomatropin,  (N = 80), once -weekly  placebo  (N = 80)  or daily 
somatropin product  (N = 80), in a 1:1:1 ratio. In all region s except Japan , the following 
stratifications will be applied:  
1. Dosing group . 
2. In the “≥30 to ≤60 years old (no oral estrogen)” dosing group, randomization will be further 
stratified by s ex. 
3. Diabetes mellitus status . 
In Japan, randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_221426].  
All subjects ’ visits should be performed in the morning to ensure fasting status . Also, DXA 
assessments should be performed in a similar setting  (time and hydrat ion status)  at each visit , 
using the same approved  DXA machine  throughout the trial .  
Additionally, all efforts will be made to keep missing data to a minimum, including the 
following:  
1. Investigators will be trained about the importance of subject retention .  
2. Investigators will be instructed to encourage subjects to complete all trial visits, until they 
complete the trial .

4. The Informed Consent Form (ICF) will include a s tatement educating subjects  about the 
scientific importance of their data , even if they discontinue study drug. 
5. Special efforts will be made to provide assistance to subjects who might discontinue due to 
travel or cost barriers, such as offers of transport ation to the clinic . 
6. Visit windows allow flexibility for clinic attendance (see  Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  and 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
7. Every effort will be made to contact [CONTACT_1766] /caregivers  or other  family members to maintain 
contact [CONTACT_194671] . 
Subjects will be identified by a Subject Number (allocated at screening) consisting of [ADDRESS_266040].  
For more details on risk -based monitoring, please refer to Section  15.5.1 . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Blinding  and Emergency Unblinding   
The once -weekly lonapegsomatropin and once -weekly placebo treatment arms will be 
double -blinded, whereas the daily somatropin product treatment arm will be open -label.  
In case of medical emergency where knowledge of the  actual treatment could influence treatment 
of the subject, the investigator will have direct access to unblinding of treatment assignment 
through the  interactive response technology  (IRT). 
To maintain the double -blind  between  the once -weekly  lonapegsomatr opin and once -weekly  
placebo  treatment arms, subjects  in the once -weekly placebo treatment arm will receive the same 
dose volume as if they would have been randomized to once -weekly lonapegsomatropin . The 
placebo  will look similar to lonapegsomatropin : the same vials, cap color and diluent will be 
used, and a blinding shell cover the glass vial.  
For dose adjustment s due to IGF -[ADDRESS_266041]  in the placebo arm in a pattern t hat follows the dose 
modifications of the lonape gsomatropin arm . In case of high IGF -1 values, a dose 
titration/reduction recommendation based on a predetermined algorithm will be provided by [CONTACT_221443] . 
Blinding of a weekly study drug ( lonapegsomatropin  or placebo ) versus daily somatropin 
product   is not considered feasible . However, critical assessors ( selected Sponsor team member s, 
central vendors and other personnel as appropriate  and feasible ) will be kept blinded  to all 
treatment as signment s to minimize bias  prior to database lock and trial unblinding . 
The central reader for DXA scans will be blinded to the treatment arm throughout the trial.  
7.2. TRIAL SITES   
The trial will be conducted at approximately 120 sites in North America, Europe, Asia, including 
Japan, and Oceania . All centers will be experienced endocrinology  centers .

Fixed , non-weight -based  dosing will be used for the trial, hence not titration to a certain IGF -1 
response. The starting doses, titration doses, and target doses for each treatment arm are shown 
in Table  1, Table  2, Table  3, and  Table  4. Dose adjustments are described in Section  9.6.

TCH -306, Version  4.0, 02 Jun  2022   Page 51 of 106 
VV-SUB -066638  – 1.0  CONFIDENTIAL  The relationship between ACP -001 dose and IGF -1 generation in adults with GHD has been 
preliminarily characterized in a 4 -week Phase 2 trial (ACP -001 CT -002). Dosed at the same 
weekly hGH dose (weight -based dosing; mg hGH/kg/week), ACP -[ADDRESS_266061] (Omnitrope, trademark owned 
by [CONTACT_221451]). Therefore, to allow for maximal comparability between the clinical effects of 
lonapegsomatropin and the daily somatropin product, this trial will use the same fixed dose 
schedule for lonapegsomatropin and the da ily somatropin product in terms of mg  hGH /week.  
Doses  for this trial  were selected based on clinical practice guidelines  and published literature . 
Starting doses of 0.2 -0.3 mg hGH/day are generally recommended for younger subjects, whereas 
lower doses (0.1 -0.2 mg hGH/day) are recommended for older subjects  (Ho 2007 , Molitch  2011 , 
Fleser iu 2016 , Yuen  2019 ). Additionally, there is evidence showing that the GH requirements for 
subjects on concomitant oral estrogen and/or for those aged <30  years old may be higher 
(Cook  1999 , Underwood  2003 ); these subjects have been grouped together in the interest of a 
simplified dosing table that can be implemented in a global registration trial.  
Titration at 4 -week intervals  ensures stabilization of IGF-1 levels prior to each dose increase. A 
12-week Titration Period was selected to allow a sufficiently gradual increase in dose . Dose 
levels were selected to align with the Sponsor’s plans to use the GH Auto -Injector with 
fixed -dose DCCs at the time of lonapegsomatropin commercialization. Target maintenance  doses 
were selected to ensure subjects would receive adequate dosing for efficacy based on age and 
concomitant oral estrogen intake , with the knowledge that dose reductions or a delay in dose 
escalation would be permitted in case of persistent AEs or othe r safety parameters attributable to 
GH effects, or in the event of elevated IGF -1 levels .  
9.6. DOSE ADJUSTMENTS   
9.6.1.  Dose Adjustment Parameters   
Any time during the trial, the study drug dose may be adjusted based on:  
• Study drug tolerability  (ie treatment related AEs) as assessed by [CONTACT_093] , or 
• IGF-1 SDS  (average  value over the course of a week for lonapegsomatropin ) as measured by 
[CONTACT_221452]  – For all three treatment arms, IGF -1 results will be blinded to investigators /sites  
and blinded team member s. There will be an unblinded team member to assess the 
IGF-1 results and report to the sites whether a dose titration is warranted. IGF -1 SDS 
>2.[ADDRESS_266062] exceeded the normal range 
of -2.0 to +2.0 SDS.  For lonapegsomatropin, average IGF -1 level  over the course of the week  
will be used to determine if dose adjustment is required. If the sample  was drawn at a time 
corresponding to average IGF -1 level ([ADDRESS_266063] -dose +/ - 3 h; V2, V3, V4), the central 
laboratory value will be used  for potential dose adjustment assessment . If the blood sample 
was drawn at a time corresponding to non -average IGF -1 level (at V5, V6 and potential 
Unscheduled Visits), a table based on a modeled PD curve will support the unblinded team 
member’s decision making. For sub jects in the arm with daily somatropin  administration , 
central laboratory IGF -1 value s  will be used  to determine if dose adjustment is required .

For each dosing group, the dose may not exceed the dose shown for Weeks 13 -38 in Table  1 and 
Table  2 at any time during the trial.  In addition, during the Dose Maintenance Period , the dose 
may not exceed the dose assigned at V4 , which  may differ from dosing tables ( Table  1, Table  2) 
taking into consideration potential dose reductions during Titration Period due  to tolerability or

back -up solution in case there are access issues or other issues with the  IRT.  
The investigator or delegated site staff will be responsible for accountability and reconciliation 
of the study drug.  
The s ite staff will provide the training on a proper storage and the study drug administration to 
each subject  at Visit 1.  This training will include a review of the IFU and on -site administration 
of the first dose of the study drug .  A copy of the IFU will be provided to the subject s to take

NOTE : Under no circumstances will the investigator allow study drugs to be used other 
than a s directed by [CONTACT_3181].  
See IMP Manual and IFU for further details.  
9.8. TREATMENT COMPLIANCE   
Treatment compliance will be assessed based on drug accountability and review of the  Subject 
Diary. If a subject did not enter all doses in the diary, the investigator will include dose 
information in source data based on verbal information from the subject. These doses will be 
transcribed to the CRF. The investigator will reinforce the importance of upd ating the diary after 
each dose. Subjects will be instructed to return all used study drug at all trial visits after Visit  1. 
The completed Subject Diary should be re viewed  at each site visit. All study drug s, used and 
unused, shall be returned if they are  expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697] , or at the end of the subject’s participation in the

into the extension trial also appro ximately at least [ADDRESS_266107] study drug dose. For 
ADA samples, the planned analysis is that all collected samples except for the placebo treated  
and screen failures  will be analyzed for anti -hGH antibodies.  Pre-treatment samples from each 
cohort may be applied for cut point assessments. In addition, ADA samples from 
lonapegsomatropin treated subjects will be analyzed for anti -PEG and anti -lonapegsomatropin 
antibodies . 
11.12.  DXA SCAN   
To ensure consistency, a central reader will evaluate the DXA scans on an ongoing basis.  
It is recommended that DXA assessments  are performed in a similar setting (time and hy dration 
status) at each visit, using the same approved DXA machine throughout the trial. Sites should be 
following the DXA manufacturer’s guideline for maintenance, calibration, and quality control, as 
well as the trial -specific guidelines as provided by t he central reader in trial manuals.

12.1. ADVERSE EVENTS   
12.1.1.  Definition  of Adverse Event (AE)   
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with the treatm ent. An AE can arise with any use (eg, in combination with another drug), route 
of administration, formulation, or dose, in cluding an overdose. An AE can therefore be any of 
the following :   
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, 
or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, 
whether or not related to that product.  

Clinical Trial Protocol   Ascendis Pharma  
TCH -306, Version  4.0, 02 Jun  2022   Page 71 of 106 
VV-SUB -066638  – 1.0  CONFIDENTIAL  • AEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the protocol -specified AE 
reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with G HD that were not present 
prior to the AE reporting period.  
• Complications th at occur as a result of protocol -mandated interventions (e.g . invasive 
procedures , blood sampling ).  
• If applicable, AEs that occur prior to assignment of study treatment associated with 
medication washout, no treatment run in, or other protocol -mandated intervention s.  
• Preexisting medical conditions (other than the condition being studied) judged by [CONTACT_13655] -specified AE reporting period.  
Based on the nonclinical  and clinical program to date, t he risks associated with the use of  
lonapegsomatropin are anticipated to be the same as those seen with daily somatropin products. 
Possible AEs associated with somatropin therapy are listed in the current Investigator Brochu re 
which will serve as the reference for safety information for lonapegsomatropin   
For complete information regarding clinical safety of the daily somatropin products, please refer 
to the Product Prescribing Information.  
Clinically significant treatment -emergent abnormal findings from physical examination , 
laboratory abnormalities , and worsening of pre-treatment  conditions may be recorded as AEs.  
12.1.2.  Definition of Serious Adverse Event   
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that meets  any of the following criteria:  
• It results in death (i.e., the AE  cause  or leads to death).   
• It is life threatening (i.e., the AE, in the view of the investigator, places the subject at 
imme diate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form 
or was allowed to continue, might have caused death).   
• It requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (see Section  12.3.3 ). 
• It results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE results in substantial 
disruption of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
• It results in a c ongenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
the study drug.  (This  applies if a subject exposed to an investigational product gives birth to a 
child with a congenital anomaly or birth defect.)  
• It is considered a significan t medical event by [CONTACT_13656] 
(e.g., may jeopardize the subject or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed above).  
The terms "severe" and "serious" are not synonymous. Severity refers to the intensity of an AE 
(e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ); the event itself may be of relatively 
minor medical significance (such as severe headache without any further findings).  
Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each AE recorded on the eCRF.  
Clinical Trial Protocol   Ascendis Pharma  
TCH -306, Version  4.0, 02 Jun  2022   Page 72 of 106 
VV-SUB -066638  – 1.0  CONFIDENTIAL  SAEs  are required to be reported by [CONTACT_13657] (i.e., no more  
than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 12.4.2  for reporting instructions).  
12.1.3.  Definition of Special Situation   
Special situations are non -standard medical conditions that provide valuable information 
(e.g. clinical, safety) about a medicinal product, even when they do not occur in association with 
an adverse even t or medical condition. Examples of special situations include and should all be 
captured in the  study database : 
• Pregnancy  
• Breastfeeding  
• Overdose  
• Drug abuse  
• Misuse  
• Medication error  
12.1.4.  Important Identified Risk Associated with Lonapegsomat ropin   
There have been reports of hypersensitivity and/or anaphylaxis in clinical trials and the 
post-marketing setting with patients who have been exposed to lonapegsomatropin with/wi thout 
previous exposure to growth hormone therapy. The reported events resolved after treatment with 
corticosteroids, antihistamine and /or epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (see section Appendix  4, Anaphylaxis 
Precautions) . 
12.2. METHODS AND TIMING FO R ASSESSING AND RECORDING OF ADVERSE 
EVENTS   
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs including  SAEs that are observed or 
reported during the study are collected and reported to  the Sponsor, in accordance with FDA 
CFR 312.32 (IND Safety Reports) and ICH E6 . 
Confirmed SARs -CoV -[ADDRESS_266108] and /or any study related procedures.   
The r eporting period begins from the time when the informed consent is obtained and ends 
[ADDRESS_266109] administration of study treatment or study 
discontinuation/termination, whichever is earlier. After this period, investigators should only 
report SAEs that are attributed to prior study treatment.   
If the EDC system is not available, the investigator should report these events directly to the 
sponsor as outlined in Section  12.4.2 .

VV-SUB -066638  – 1.0  CONFIDENTIAL  12.2.2.  Severity, Causality, and Outcome Assessment   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Severity Rating   
The following guideline should  be used by [CONTACT_221464]:  
Table  6 provides guidance for assessing adverse event severity.  
Table  6: Adverse Event Severity Grading Scale   
Severity  Description  
Mild  Discomfort noticed, but no disruption of normal daily activity  
Moderate  Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity  
Severe  Incapacitating with inability to work or to perform normal daily activity  
Note: Regardless of severity, some events may also meet seriousness criteria. Refer to definition of a 
serious adverse event (see Section 12.1.2 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Causality Rating   
All AEs , including  SAEs , whether volunteered by [CONTACT_423], discovered by [CONTACT_13661], or detected through physical examination, laboratory test, or other means 
must be reported appropriately.  
Each reported AE or SAE must be described by [CONTACT_13662] (i.e. , start and end dates), seriousness 
criteria if applicable, suspected relationship to the IMP (see following guidance), and actions 
taken.  To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, investigators should apply 
the following general guideline : 
Related (Yes)  – There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and 
administration of the IMP. The AE cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, 
intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  The AE follows a kno wn pattern of response to the 
IMP or with similar treatments  and/or the AE abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the IMP 
or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re -challenge.  
Not Related (No)  – Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the IMP 
(e.g.,  preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant 
medication).  The AE has no plausible temporal relationship to IMP administration (e.g., cancer 
diagnosed [ADDRESS_266110] dose of study drug ). 
Expected AEs are those AEs that are listed or characterized in the current Investigator’s 
Brochure ( IB). 
Unexpected AEs are those not listed in the current IB. This includes AEs for which the 
specificity or severity is not consistent with the descriptio n in the IB . (For example, under this 
definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected if the IB only referred to elevated hepatic 
enzymes or hepatitis).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Outcome  Assessment   
One of five outcomes listed below must be recorded:  
Recovered/Resolved  – The event has stopped. The stop date of the event must be recorded.  
Clinical Trial Protocol   Ascendis Pharma  
TCH -306, Version  4.0, 02 Jun  2022   Page 74 of 106 
VV-SUB -066638  – 1.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Recovering/Resolving  – The subject is clearly recovering from an event. The event is not yet 
completely resolved.  
Not Recovered/Not Resolved  – The event is still ongoing.  (Could include stable and  
commensurate with ongoing disease processes).  
Recovered/Resolved with sequelae  – The event has reached a state where no further changes 
are expected, and the residual symptoms are assumed to persist. An example is hemiparesis after 
stroke.  
The stop date of the event must be recorded. In case of SAE, the sequelae should be specified.  
Fatal – The subject has died as a consequen ce of the event. Date of death is recorded as stop da te 
for the AE.  
Unknown  – Unknown to the investigator, e.g. subject lost to follow -up. 
AE follow ups should be conducted in accordance with section Section  13. 
12.3. PROCEDURES  FOR ELICITING, RECOR DING AND REPORTING A DVERSE 
EVENTS   
12.3.1.  Eliciting Adverse Events   
A consistent methodology for eliciting AEs at all subject evaluation time points should be 
adopted.  Examples of non -directive questions include:  
• “How have you felt since your last clinical visit?”  
• “Have you had any new or changed health problems since yo u were last here?”   
12.3.2.  Recording Procedures for All Adverse Events   
All AEs will be documented in response to question s about the subject’s well -being and whether 
any possible change s in well -being have occurred since the previous visit. Additionally, at each 
visit, site staff will review subject diary data with the subjec t, to determine if diary entries reflect 
any AEs.  
AEs, including SAEs, will be documented  through the end of the subject’s participation in the 
trial or Early Termination visit. . All AEs must be recorded on the appropriate CRF.  AEs either 
observed by [CONTACT_221465].  
The following attributes must b e documented for each reported AE: 
• Subject ID  
• AE Term  
• Description  (for SAEs)  
• Onset date  (if AE was present on Day 1, include whether onset was prior to or after the first 
dose of the study drug)  
• Resolution date, if applicable  
• Severity  
Clinical Trial Protocol   Ascendis Pharma  
TCH -306, Version  4.0, 02 Jun  2022   Page 75 of 106 
VV-SUB -066638  – 1.0  CONFIDENTIAL  • Causality (relationsh ip to the study drug)  
• Outcome  
• Action taken  
• Determination of “serious ness criteria ” (whether serious or  not serious ) 
Any medical history condition, signs, symptoms, and illnesses active  during the Screening 
Period  will be captured  as baseline (pre-existing) events, if appropriate, to assure that any 
change(s) in these experiences  during the trial also are recorded as an AE and a complete safety 
profile is obtained.  An event that occurs after signing of ICF but prior to the first study drug 
admi nistration will be documented as medical history unless the event is trial procedure –related, 
in which case it will be reported as a non –treatment -emergent AE. Any new or worsening 
pretreatment event that occurs from the time of the first study drug admini stration until the last 
visit will be recorded as an AE.  
Routine titration of chronic, concomitant medications w ill not be considered to meet the criteria 
for AEs. In addition, increased IGF -1 level s requiring study drug dose decrease ( ie, IGF-1 SDS 
> 2.0) will not be considered as AE . However, occurrence of clinically significant  
symptoms/condition s associated with  increased IGF -[ADDRESS_266111] medical terminology/concepts when reporting AEs or SAEs. 
Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviation (e.g., hypertension for elevated blood pressure that 
persists and requires chronic treatment and follow -up, or increased blood p ressure for elevated 
blood pressure that occurs for a limited time and does not persist or require ongoing treatment).  
AEs will be documented at the maximum intensity experienced. If a previously recorded and 
closed AE or condition recorded as part of medi cal history increases in severity or frequency, it 
will be recorded as a new AE.  
All AEs will be considered ongoing until they have completely resolved or  are deemed stable or 
commensurate with ongoing disease processes by [CONTACT_093].  At study comple tion or the 
Early Termination Visit, all AEs should have a stateme nt regarding resolution , see also 
Section  10.2.[ADDRESS_266112](s) monitored. Since accidental overdoses with the study drug could 
have serious clinica l consequences and/or represent a compliance issue, they should be reported 
to the  Medical Monitor  immediately and evaluated by [CONTACT_1034].  See Section  12.1.[ADDRESS_266113] be reported as 
an AE if it meets any of the following criteria:  
• Is accompanied by [CONTACT_221466] -306, Version  4.0, 02 Jun  2022   Page 76 of 106 
VV-SUB -066638  – 1.0  CONFIDENTIAL  • Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification or titration, treatment 
interruption, or t reatment discontinuation) Note : Increased IGF -1 levels (blinded to 
investigators in this study) requiring study drug dose decrease (ie, IGF -1 SDS > 2.0) will not 
be considered as AE. However, occurrence of clinically significant symptoms/conditions 
associa ted with increased IGF -1 levels will be considered as AE.  
• Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) or a 
change in concomitant therapy  
• Is clinically significant in the investigator's judgment  
It is the investigato r's responsibility to review all available laboratory findings. Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory abnormality 
should be classified as an AE. 
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g.,  alkaline 
phosphatase and bilirubin 5   ULN associated with cholestasis), only the diagnosis 
(i.e., cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a  sign of a disease or syndrome, the 
abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor 
indicating whether the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g.,  "elevated potassium," 
as opposed to "abnormal potassiu m"). If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a 
precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the AE.  
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should 
only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
Abnormal Vital Sign Values  
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an AE. A vital sign result must be reported as an 
AE if it meets any of the following criteria:  
• Is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]  
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or 
treatment discontinuation)  
• Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy  
• Is clinically significant in the investigator's judgment . 
It is the investigator's responsibility to review all vital sign findings. Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should be 
classified as an AE. 
If a clinically significant vital sign abno rmality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g.,  high 
blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e.,  hypertension) should be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  
Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit should 
only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF.

VV-SUB -066638  – 1.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Diagnosis vs. Signs and Symptoms  
If known at the time of reporting, a diagnosis should be reported rather than individual signs and 
symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice , asterixis, and elevated 
transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically 
characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, it is acceptable to report 
the information that is currently availa ble as separate AEs. If a diagnosis is subsequently 
established, it should be reported as follow -up information.  
Injection Site Reaction  (ISR)   
Local signs or symptoms at the site of study drug administration are deemed to be adverse 
events.   The reported AEs should include ‘injection site’’ in the reported term such as injection 
site erythema, injection site induration etc.  The diagnosis is at the discretion of the investigator.  
Deaths  
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE reporting perio d, regardless of attribution, 
will be reported to the appropriate parties. When recording a death, the event or condition that 
caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be reported as the single medical concept. If 
the cause of death is unknown and  cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, report 
“Unexplained Death”.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_221406]. If a subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9615] a medical or surgical procedure as a 
result of an AE, the event responsible for the procedure, not the procedure itself, should be 
reported as the SAE.  
For example, if a subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15428] , record the heart 
condition that necessitated the by[CONTACT_13664].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_221407]:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_201727]-existing conditio ns  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_201728]  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13591] . 
Pre-existing Medical Conditions  
A pre -existing medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study. Such conditions 
should be reported as medical and prior procedures . A pre -existing medical condition should be 
re-assessed throughout the trial and reported as an AE or SAE only i f the frequency, severity, or 
character of the condition worsens during the study. When reporting such events, it is important 
to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_13665] (e.g., worsening type 2 diab etes mellitus ).

Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous, should always be classified as serious, 
and expeditiously reported as an SAE. Similarly, any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child 
born to a female subject expo sed to the study drug  should be expeditiously reported as an SAE.  
Product Complaints  
A Product Complaint is defined as any written or oral information received from a complainant 
that alleges deficiencies related to identity, quality, safety, strength, p urity, reliability, durability, 
effectiveness, or performance of a product after it has been released and distributed to the 
commercial market or clinical trial.  
The investigator should document as much information as possible including the product batch 
number and forward the information to the Sponsor immediately (refer to the pharmacy /IMP  
manual for further details). If the product complaint results in an adverse event to the study 
patient, the event must be reported on the AE eCRF and submitted. If the event is serious, the AE 
eCRF must be completed immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), as 
outlined in Section  Section  12.4.2 . 
12.4. SAFETY REPORTING REQ UIREMENTS   
12.4.1.  Non-Serious A dverse Events Leading to Discontinuation   
If situation permits, non -serious events (including laboratory abnormalities ) and special 
situations  (e.g.pregnancies ) that may require permanent discontinuation of study drug should be 
discussed with the Medical Monitor  prior to making any final decision.  
12.4.2.  Reporting   
All initial and follow -up information regarding SAEs and Special Situations reporting must 
be reported by [CONTACT_13666] 24  hours of 
discovery /awareness , including those related to protocol -mandated procedures and regardless of 
suspected causality.  
For each AE recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will make an 
assessment of seriousness (see Section  12.1.2  for seriousness criteria), severity (see Section  
[IP_ADDRESS] ), and causality (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
Reporting must not be delayed by [CONTACT_13667]. The minimum information

14.4. STATISTICAL ANALYSES   
In general, data from clinical assessments will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  
Categorical data will be presented using counts and percentages of subjects. Continuous 
variables will be presented using number of subjects, mean, standard deviation (SD), standard 
error (SE),  median, minimum , and maximum.  
14.4.1.  Definition of the Estimand and Estimator for Primary Analysis   
Population: the treatment effect is to be estimated for the Intent -To-Treat population of adult 
subjects with GHD as defined by [CONTACT_39719]/exclusion criteria.  
Primar y endpoint: efficacy is to be measured using the primary endpoint of change from baseline 
in trunk percent fat (as assessed by [CONTACT_11324]) at Week 38.  
Handling missing data/Intercurrent events (ICEs) missing reasons will be taken into 
considerations into multiple  imputation . The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method  will 
be used to impute the missing data, under the multivariate normality assumption to impute the 
missing data by [CONTACT_221472]. Details will be provided in the SAP.   
The difference in change from baseline at Week 38 in trunk percent fat will be estimated by [CONTACT_221473], with multiple imputation for missing data. The ANCOVA 
model will include treatment arm, dose group , diabetes mellitus , and region (Japan vs.  all regions 
except Japan ) as factor s, and baseline trunk percent fat as a covariate . Additiona l factors may 
include , baseline  age group, sex, concomitant oral estrogen at screening (yes vs . no), and AGHD 
onset (adult vs . childhood). The daily somatropin product arm will be included in the ANCOVA 
model , but no formal statistical testing will be performed on this arm .  
Subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoin t will be performed to determine whether 
treatment effect s are consistent across clinically meaningful subgroups. The difference in change 
from baseline at Week 38 in trunk percent fat and their 95% confidence intervals will be 
displayed in a forest plot. Subgroups will include but not limited to the following : region,  age 
group, gender  and diabete s mellitus status.   
Details on the analyses including derivation, handling of missing data, statistical method, 
sensitivity analyses  including per -protocol analysis and subgroups will be provided in the SAP. 
14.4.2.  Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Analyses   
For the endpoints evaluating the change from baseline in trunk fat mass and total body lean mass 
at Week 38, the analysis method used for the primary e ndpoint will be applied . And similar 
by-visit ANCOVA models with multiple imputation will also be applied with corresponding 
baseline value as a covariate .

designee to evaluate eligibility and to perform central monitoring of safety data. Subsequent to 
data entry, a study monitor will perform source data verification within the EDC system. 
Original entries as well as any changes to data fields will be stored in the audit trail of the 
system. Prior to database lock, the investigator wi ll use his/her log in credentials to confirm that 
the forms have been reviewed, and that the entries accurately reflect the information in the 
source documents. The eCRF captures the data required per the protocol schedule of events and 
procedures. System -generated or manual queries will be issued to the investigative site staff as 
data discrepancies are identified by [CONTACT_221474], who routinely review the data for 
completeness, correctness, and consistency. The site is responsible for responding to the queries 
in a timely manner, within the system, either by [CONTACT_221475], and by [CONTACT_13678] ( eg, data entry error). At the conclusion 
of the trial, Sponsor will provide the site with a read -only archive copy of the data entered by

15.5.1.  Monitoring Procedures   
The Sponsor and/or its representative will periodically review the trial data to ensure that data 
are being appropriately  collected and reported. Queries and corrections will be made as needed.  
Risk-based monitoring including reduced source data verification, triggered monitoring, 
centralized monitoring, and targeted monitoring will be conducted (EMA  Reflection  Paper  2013 , 
FDA  Guidance  for Industry  2013 , EMA  Guidance  2020 , FDA  Guidance  2020 ). All critical data 
will require source verification by [CONTACT_221476], to 
ensure subject’s  safety and the reliability of trial results. The extent and details of moni toring 
including source data verification will be described in the Clinical and Central Monitoring Plans .  
The trial site must not enroll any subject before the initiation was performed and a final 
eligibility of the site is confirmed by [CONTACT_221477] r. Depending on the COVID -19 
pandemic situation at the trial site, a site qualification and SIVs may be performed remote ly. 
During the trial, regular monitoring visits will be performed according to ICH GCP, the 
Sponsor’s designee’s or local CRO’s standard  operating procedures  (SOP) , and local regulations. 
The frequency and type of monitoring visits will depend amongst other factors on the trial site’s 
recruitment rate and current pandemic situation in each country and trial  site. 
Physical monitoring visits  at the  trial sites may not be feasible or may be restricted for some time 
due to COVID -19 pandemic situation, and either a combined remote and on -site monitoring or 
full remote monitoring visit will be conducted during these periods. The Sponsor authorize s the 
designated local CROs to include remote monitoring visits according to the applicable guidelines 
and regulations into the monitoring activities. In line with local laws and regulations , remote 
source data verification might be part of the remote moni toring visits and if so, it has to be 
agreed between the Sponsor designee, the investigator and additional investigational staff at each  
trial site . The relevant trial documents ( eg, monitoring plan) will be adjusted to reflect these 
activities that will b e held during the period when standard monitoring visits are not  feasible . 
Prior to site activation, the CRA will ensure a procedure is agreed with each investigational site 
to ensure remote source data verification in case of SARS -COV -2 crisis.

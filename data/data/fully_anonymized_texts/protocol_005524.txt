Version 9 12/13/17   9 IV. ASSESSING STUDY ELIGIBILITY AND PARTICIPANT ENROLLMENT  
 
A. Beginning the Screening Process  
 
For the purposes of this study, a screened patient will be defined as one who 
was identified based on gestational age and procedure type (D&E), as being 
potentially eligible for the study and who was approached about study 
participation.   
 
B. Assessing interest in study participation  
 
Once staff have identified a patient who might be eligible, based on patient age, 
gestational age and procedure type, for study participation, study staff should 
approach the patient to gauge interest in participating in the study. Research staff 
should assess the patient’s interest in study participation by [CONTACT_870536]. This study description is also printed on the 
Recrui tment Script Form.  Please adapt as needed.  
 
Digoxin RCT Recruitment Script  
 
Digoxin RCT Recruitment Script  
 
Hi my name [CONTACT_832] ___________ and I am a researcher. I am working on a study 
that you are eligible for, is it okay if I tell you a little bit about it? It is totally 
optional, so after you hear about it, it will be up to you to decide if you’re 
interested in b eing in the study.  
The study is on a medication called digoxin. Digoxin is FDA approved to 
treat heart conditions, but it is often used before abortions to stop the fetal 
heart from beating. In some clinics, all women who are having an abortion 
after 20 w eeks of gestation receive digoxin, and in some clinics they don’t 
use this medication at all. Some doctors think that using digoxin helps to 
make the abortion procedure faster and easier, but we don’t know this for 
sure. That is why we’re studying digoxin;  we want to know if using digoxin 
makes the abortion faster, easier and safer.  
If you decide to be in the study it will involve some things today and some 
tomorrow. I will ask you some questions to make sure it’s ok for you to be 
in the study, and then I would ask you a few questions about how you’re 
feeling today. Today you will be having dilators placed, and if you are in the 
study, you will also receive an injection in your abdomen. The injection will 
either be digoxin, which is the medication that we’r e studying, or a placebo, 
which is salt water and doesn’t do anything. The study drug will be injected 
into the fetus. After the injection, you would answer a few more questions. 
Then tomorrow we will give you a quick survey before your procedure, 
Standard Operating Procedure - Intrafetal digoxin as an adjuvant for dilation and evacuation at 20 to 24 
weeks’ gestation: a placebo-controlled, double- blinded randomized controlled trial.  
Version 9 12/13/[ADDRESS_1215407] some information during your procedure, and give you another 
quick survey while you’re in the recovery room after your procedure.  
You will be paid $[ADDRESS_1215408]. You will/will not receive a digoxin injection today. ( RA will tell 
them whether they will or will not receive digoxin depending on where they 
are having their abortion. SFGH: WILL NOT, FPAWH: WILL, Lovejoy: MAY 
OR MAY NOT depending on provider).   
 
For patients who are interested in participating, they should proceed to eligibility 
screening ( Form 1) and consenting.  
  
For patients who were approached based on being recommended by [CONTACT_870537], their reason for 
declining should be recorded on Form 1 ( Item 2 ) and logged in the Recruitment 
Log under the tab “Declined”.  
 
C. Assessing Inclusion Criteria  
 
Once staff have identified a patient who might be eligible  and is interested in 
study participation, study staff should use Items 3 -17 of Form 1 as a guide to 
assess inclusion  and exclusion criteria.  
Inclusion criteria:  (Items 3-7) 
- Female  
- 18 years and older  
- English -speaking

gestation  
o Assessed via Biparietal Diameter on Day  1 between 4.61  and 5.88 
mm by [CONTACT_870538].  
- Medically eligib le for outpatient Dilation & Evacuation procedure at clinical 
site 
- Requiring only one day of dilators prior to D&E  
- Able to give informed consent  
If a patient meets all inclusion criteria on Form [ADDRESS_1215409] Operating Procedure - Intrafetal digoxin as an adjuvant for dilation and evacuation at 20 to 24 
weeks’ gestation: a placebo-controlled, double- blinded randomized controlled trial.  
Version 9 12/13/17   11  
Exclusion Criteria: ( Items 8 -17 Form 1 )

>100.4°F)  
 
Eligibility must be confirmed by a clinician or physician and must be documented 
using Form 1: Eligibility Screening and Baseline Data, Day 1.  Detailed 
instructions for completing Form [ADDRESS_1215410] meet ALL eligibility (both inclusion and exclusion) criteria to be 
considered eligible for this study. If a woman does not meet eligibility criteria she 
cannot participate in this study.  
 
If a wo man does meet ALL eligibility criteria (both inclusion and exclusion) and 
wishes to participate in the study , she is ready to be consented. However, inform 
the patient that her eligibility is only confirmed when she sees the clinician, so 
there is the poss ibility of her being consented and later found ineligible for the 
study based on the clinician’s recommendations.  
 
E. Administering study informed consent  
 
The study Informed Consent Form (ICF)  and HIPAA Consent Form (HCF)  must 
be completed for all study participants. These forms  must be signed and dated 
by [CONTACT_870539].

appropriate response.  
 
i. NOTE: if the patient expresses suicid ality and/or scores very 
highly on the PHQ9, please ensure that she has talked to 
another clinic staff member (counselor, RN, NP, MD) about 
this so that she can be referred to adequate resources.  
 
23.  Ask the patient to assess her pain currently on a scale o f 0-10. Show her 
the 0- [ADDRESS_1215426] the appropriate box on the scale. Mark an “X” in the 
appropriate box, based on her response.

appropriate response. If the patient is unable to answer the question, tick 
“Don’t know”.  
 
25.  Ask the patient if she is experiencing any nausea right now. If she is not 
experienci ng nausea currently, circle “None” on the corresponding line. If 
she is experiencing nausea, ask her if it was mild, moderate, or severe 
and circle her response. If the woman would like the study staff to define 
mild, moderate or severe, read her the definitions below. These definitions 
are also printed directly on Form 1:

Thus the patient interview is compl eted after Item 27 is completed, unless the Mild:  Symptoms were annoying but did not get in the way of your usual 
activities.  
 
Moderate: Symptoms got in the way as you tried to do your usual activities 
but you were still able to do most of the things you needed to.  
 
Severe: Symptoms stopped you from being able to do your usual 
activities.

Version 9 12/13/17   21 IRB-approved study staff is unable to access the patient’s chart, in which case 
the staff can refer to the clinician or physician to complete items 28- 37.  
 
28. Record the patient’s age in years.  
 
29. Record the patient’ s BMI  
 
30. Record the patient’s Biparietal Diameter (BPD) as assessed by [CONTACT_870546]’s appointment on Day 1. 
Record the BPD in cm to two decimal places.   
 
31. Record the patient’s GA as charted in the clinic in weeks and days. Use 
the main gestational age that the clinic uses when documenting this 
patient.   
 
32. Participants will be divided into two study groups based on gestational 
age. For participants whose BPD is measuring 4.61- 5.24cm check “Group 
1”. For participants whos e BPD measures 5.25- 5.88cm, check “Group 2”.  
 
a. Note that FPA Women’s Health locations in Los Angeles and Long 
Beach will only be recruiting patients for Group 1. Thus  all patients 
enrolled in these sites should have BPD within 4.61- 5.24cm, and 
should all be checked for Group 1.  
 
33.  This question assesses the patient’s reason f or her current abortion. This 
question should be completed in consultation  with a counselor or  with a 
clinician or physician. If the patient is having her abortion for a fetal 
anomaly or a pregnancy com plication check “Anomaly/comp.”.  If the 
patient is having her abortion for any other reason, check “Other”.  
 
a. Patients with cranial defects must be between 20w0d and 24w0d 
by [CONTACT_870541]. If cranial defects preclude BPD measurement, use 
the best composite sonographic dating criteria available to ensure 
the patient is between 20w0d and 24w0d. I f accurate dating is 
unable to be obtained,  the patient is not eligible for the study.  
b. Other  kinds of  fetal anomalies (non- cranial defects, see above a.) 
are otherwise eligible for the study.  
 
34. Record the total number of times the patient has been pregnant,  
regardless of outcome. A multi -gestational pregnancy is [ADDRESS_1215427] Operating Procedure - Intrafetal digoxin as an adjuvant for dilation and evacuation at 20 to 24

of a multi -gestational pregnancy is 1 delivery. Vaginal deliveries are 
considered deliveries occurring >20wks.  
 
36. Record the total number of c -section deliveries this patient has had. 
Delivery of a multi -gestational pregnancy is [ADDRESS_1215429] the number of mi scarriages the patient has had.  
 
39. Check any of the medical conditions listed that the patient has recorded in 
her chart. If there is a medical condition that the patient has or previousl y 
had that is not listed, check “Other” and write in the medical condition as 
it’s listed in her chart.  
 
a. NOTE: anxiety that is listed in the chart as a chronic condition (i.e. 
has been diagnosed by a healthcare professional and/or uses 
medication to manag e) then this should be considered “psychiatric 
disease”. If the chart notes that the patient is generally feeling 
anxious (for example, is feeling anxious about the abortion 
procedure), this does not need to be noted.  
 
This is the end of Form 1: Eligibility Screening and Baseline Data, Day 1 .

Version 9 12/13/17   23 B. Form 2: Dilator and Injection Data, Day 1   
 
Form 2 Overview  
 
Form 2 is used to document the injection of the study medication and dilator  
placement . It also assesses the pain felt by [CONTACT_870547].  This form will be completed by [CONTACT_1744] -approved study staff 
before and after the injection and during dilator placement. The staff member will 
survey both the provider and the participant while completing .  
 
Injection and dilator order will vary by [CONTACT_3725]. LOVEJOY: Injection will happen first, 
followed by [CONTACT_870548]. FPAWH: Dilators will be placed first, followed by 
[CONTACT_17838]. SFGH: Order may vary.  
 
The In jection Questionnaire and the Dilators Questionnaire should be asked and 
answered about the specific event to which they refer (injection or dilator 
placement). Please perform the questionnaires DIRECTLY after each event and 
clarify for the participant that the questions are referring to that event only.  
 
Form 2 Detailed Instructions  
 
Injection data on Form 2:  
 
Write the participants Randomization ID in the box provided. The randomization 
ID contains the group assignment code 1 or 2 followed by [CONTACT_870549] (1 for 
SF, 2 for LJ, 3 for LA, 4 for LB) and the patient -specific number (01, 02, 03). For

1-[ADDRESS_1215432] Operating Procedure - Intrafetal digoxin as an adjuvant for dilation and evacuation at 20 to 24 
weeks’ gestation: a placebo-controlled, double- blinded randomized controlled trial.  
Version 9 12/13/17   24 For FPA Women’s Health locations, only participants in the first gestational age 
group 1 (BPD 4.6 1-5.24) are being recruited. Thus all randomization numbers will 
begin with “1- “.  
 
Blinded injection preparation and placement  
Injection drug preparation and randomization protocol vary by [CONTACT_3725]. See below for 
the protocols of each site:  
 
SF: Women’s Options Center   
WHO draws up study medication:  
- The RA will fax down a Pharmacy Order form to the ZSFG Pharmacy 
once the patient is enrolled.  
- A pharmacist who is not involved with any other study procedures will 
draw up the study drug (digoxin or placebo) based on the randomization 
scheme.  
- The pharmacist will then tube the labeled syringe (containing either 
digoxin or placebo) up to 6G.  
 
Randomization protocol : 
- The pharmacist will use the subject ID number located on the faxed 
Pharmacy Order form to look at the randomization guide to determine 
whether the patient will receive active drug (digoxin) or placebo.  
- Once the injection  is administered, the participant is considered 
randomized. Any participant who withdraws from the study prior to the 
injection  is not randomized and the randomization number can be reused. 
The unused syringe will be disposed.   
 
Drug Preparation  
- Once the pharmacist determines whether the patie nt will receive digoxin 
or placebo he/she will do the following:  
o If digoxin, the pharmacist will retrieve two ampules digoxin (500 
mcg/2 mL concentration) from study bin der in IVAC  
o If placebo, the pharmacist will retrieve a 10 ml vial of 0.9% sodium 
chlori de (use general IVAC stock)  
- The pharmacist will aseptically draw up [ADDRESS_1215433] -from-light bag.  
 
LJ: Lovejoy Surgicenter  
 WHO draws up study medication:  
- A Lovejoy Surgicenter nurse (RN) from the upstairs section of the center 
(clinical section) who is not part of the patient’s further care will draw up 
after the patient is enrolled.  
Standard Operating Procedure - Intrafetal digoxin as an adjuvant for dilation and evacuation at 20 to 24 
weeks’ gestation: a placebo-controlled, double- blinded randomized controlled trial.  
Version 9 12/13/17   25 - The RA is responsible for informing the nurse of the patient and 
coordinating with the nurse so he/she can prepare the drug prior to the 
injection.  
- The nurse who is responsible for drawing up the medication may change 
per participant as each nurse is assig ned certain patients and not involved 
in the care of others. The nurse will be recruited to draw up medication 
only of the patients he/ she is not otherwise caring for. If he/ she is caring 
for a study participant, he/she may draw up the drug for another study 
participant but not for his/ her participant patient.  
 
Randomization protocol : 
- Prior to the study starting, the coordinating center (UCSF) will send a 
randomization list that is developed to be consistent with the 
randomization schemes of the other sites .  
- Using this randomization list, research assistants who are not otherwise 
related to the study (research assistants known to the clinic but in different 
departments or on different studies) will create envelopes that correspond 
to each randomization ID.  
- Each envelope will be labeled with only a Randomization ID and inside the 
sealed envelope will be the drug randomization: “Placebo” or “Digoxin”  
- This envelope is opened only  by [CONTACT_870550].  
- Once the envelope is opened, the participant is considered randomized. 
Any participant who withdraws from the study prior to envelope opening is 
not randomized and the envelope is replaced in the cabinet to be reused. 
Any envelope that is open is discarded even if the participant does not 
ultimately received the injection and that randomization ID is not reusable.  
- Thus it is important that the envelope be opened, and study drug drawn, 
as close to the injection as possible.  
- Envelopes will be kept in a locked box in the clinic  
 
Drug Preparation  
- Once they have opened the envelope, the nurse responsible for drawing 
up the medication should prepare the injection syringe out of view of any 
other research or clinic staff. The drug may be prepared downstairs, 
where staff are not involved in clinical care, or anywhere that is not in the 
presence of any one else caring for the study participant.  
- No drug containers other than the syringe containing the prepared 
medication should be brought into the procedure room during the injection 
to ensure blinding.  
 
FPAWH  – LA and LB sites :  
WHO draws up study medication:  
- A FPAWH  medical assistant (MA)  who is not part of the patient’s medical 
care will draw up the study medication (digoxin or placebo) after the 
patient is enrolled.  
Standard Operating Procedure - Intrafetal digoxin as an adjuvant for dilation and evacuation at 20 to 24 
weeks’ gestation: a placebo-controlled, double- blinded randomized controlled trial.  
Version 9 12/13/17   26 - When the study medication is prepared, the MA will deliver the syringe on 
a tray to the nurse who is performing the injection.  
 
Randomization protocol : 
- Prior to the study starting, the coordinating center (UCSF) will send a 
randomization list that is developed to be consistent with the 
randomization schemes of the other sites.  
- Once a patient is enrolled, the RA will inform the MA of the patient’s 
randomi zation number and the MA will use the randomization list 
(contained in an envelope) to determine if placebo or digoxin should be 
drawn up. The MA who draws up the study drug is the only one who has 
access to this envelope.  
- Once the injection  is administered , the participant is considered 
randomized. Any participant who withdraws from the study prior to the 
injection  is not randomized and the randomization number can be reused. 
The unused syringe will be disposed.   
 
Drug Preparation  
- Once the randomization l ist is viewed, the MA  responsible for drawing up 
the medication should prepare the injection syringe out of view of any 
other research or clinic staff. The drug is usually prepared in the recovery 
room , where staff are not involved in clinical care, or any where that is not 
in the presence of any one else caring for the study participant.  
- No drug containers other than the syringe containing the prepared 
medication should be brought into the procedure room during the injection 
to ensure blinding.

weeks’ gestation: a placebo-controlled, double- blinded randomized controlled trial.  
Version 9 12/13/17   33 D. Form 4: Intra -operative Data, Day 2  
 
Form 4  Overview  
 
Form 4 is used to document the initial pre- operative setup, procedure time, and 
details of the D&E procedure. Form 4 will also include the operating physician’s 
assessment of procedure difficulty and his or her guess as to the study drug 
assignment. Questi ons from Form [ADDRESS_1215444] be listed on the Delegation of 
Authority Log as approved to perform the D&E .  
 
Form [ADDRESS_1215445] today’s date. Dates should be  recorded as month/day/year 
(MM/DD/YYYY).  
 
2. Print the last name [CONTACT_870569] D&E  on the 
line provided.  
 
3. Record what anesthesia the patient received during their abortion 
procedure by [CONTACT_870552].  
 
a. Moderate sedation is defined as  “a drug -induced depression of 
consciousness during whic h patients respond purposefully  to verbal 
commands, either alone or accompanied by [CONTACT_870553]. 
No interventions are required to maintain a patent airway, and 
spontaneous ventilation is adequate. Cardiovascular function is 
usually maintained” per ASA guidelines  
4. Prior to the MD placing their speculum and starting to the procedure, the 
RN assisting with ultrasound during the procedure will check for fetal 
presentation and cardiac activity using the ultrasound. The MD is blinded 
and CANNOT know whether or not cardiac activity is present. The 
study RA must remain blinded to cardiac activity as well.  The MD 
must be turned around and not looking at the ultrasound. The RN may 
inform the MD about fetal presentation but will not say whether or not 
there was cardiac activity aloud.  
 
A separate log, the Cardiac Activity Log, will be used to record 
cardiac activity. RN will record the subject’s enrollment ID, the date, 
cardiac activity (yes, no, or unsure) and initials. The Cardiac Activity Log 
will be kept in an opaque folder, and the research assistant will remain 
blinded to the cardiac activity.

weeks’ gestation: a placebo-controlled, double- blinded randomized controlled trial.  
Version 9 12/13/[ADDRESS_1215446] the 
fetal presentation by [CONTACT_13158] “Cephalic”, “Breech” or “Transverse”. If the 
fetal presentation is not listed in the response choices, tick “Other” and 
write in the fetal presentation on t he line provided.  
 
After the RN is done viewing cardiac activity, it may be necessary for the clinician 
to view the ultrasound during the procedure. This is acceptable as necessary for 
the procedure, however the physician should avoid intentionally searching for 
cardiac activity to the degree that is possible.  
 
6. Using a clock, record the time when the speculum is first placed in the 
vagina. Record the time as standard time (12hr format) hh:mm . Circle AM

Bierers or  ring forceps. Record which instrument the clinician uses 
to measure cervical dilation by [CONTACT_870554] “ring forceps” or 
“Bierer forceps”. (Preference is ring forceps ) 
b. The cli nician will place the Bierers or ring forceps into the internal 
os of the cervix and open them as far as possible. The research 
assistant will use a paper ruler to measure the distance between 
the handles and will record the distance in millimeters  in the spot 
marked “distance between handles”.   
c. LATER when the clinician has finished using the instrument that 
was used to check the dilation (Bierers or  ring forceps), the 
research assistant will open them to the same distance (using the 
ruler to match the distance between the handles to the original 
distance between the handles in mm) and keepi[INVESTIGATOR_870521], will record the distance between the tips of the 
instrument in millimeters  in the spot marked “distance between 
tips”. This should be done after the procedure is over when the 
clinician is no longer using this instrument.  
 
8. Record the time on the stopwatch when the first instrument  enters the 
uterus. Record the time as seen on the stopwatch, hh:mm:ss. Do not reset

email the updated R&E log to the coordinating site every week . The title of the 
R&E document should be changed to reflect the appropriate week before it is 
sent to the coordinating site (e.g. Enrollment Log_LJ_12.7.16 - > Enrollment 
Log_LJ_12.14.16).  
 
Recruitment Log  
The Recruitment log is used to record the total number of possible participants at 
each clinic and the number who were actually approached. It also monitors their 
reason for declining participation and ineligibility. In the first column, Column A, 
the weeks are listed. Each row corresponds to a single recruitment day, or Day 1. 
Record the dat e of that Day 1 in Column B next to the week.  
• Based on the clinic schedule, which differs per site, periodically update the 
recruitment log with the number of patients who come to clinic for D&E as 
the day goes on.   
o Recruitment days  (Day 1)  are as follows : 
 SF: Tuesdays, Thursdays  
 LB: Mondays  
 LA: Wednesdays , (possibly Fridays)  
 LJ: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday  
 
• Not approached : Based off of how many patients present to the clinic by 
[CONTACT_870557], record how many were not approached 
under “NOT Approached”. In the next column, record the reason they 
were not approached for the study. Reasons for not approaching include:  
o Being found ineligible prior to approaching: wrong gestational age 
(BPD <4.61 or >5.88; also at FPAWH if they were >5.24); under 18 
years old, non- English or Spanish speaking; if it was a multiple 
gestation pregnancy; if they’re incarcerated; per clinical judgment, 
when a nurse, physician or other clinic staff requests that the 
patient not be approached (i.e. mentally unstable, emotional, etc) 
though reason may not always be provided.  
 For LJ  and both FPAWH  sites: Spanish- speaking patients 
are not being recruited so indicate this a n appropriate 
reason.  
o Missed the opportunity to approach the patient: RA was not 
available/w ith another participant; clinic flow was too busy.  
o Recruitment limits: maximum number of participants were enrolled 
for the day so no further patients approached; for SF or LJ, RA was 
only recruiting for one of the two gestational age groups and the

recruited that day.  
o Other: please write in parentheses what the reason for not 
approaching the patient.  
 
• Approached: record the number  of participants that you approached. Each 
patient approached s hould have a corresponding data Form 1. Verify at 
the end of each day that the number of Form 1’s completed matches the 
number “approached” recorded.  
 
• Declined : record the number  of patients who declined to participate after 
you approached them about the s tudy. For each participant that declines, 
ask the patient why they do not wish to participate. Record the reason(s) 
they provide for declining in the following column, separating each reason 
by a comma (ex: “don’t want extra injection, don’t want to spend extra time 
on study”). This response should also be documented on Form 1.  
 
• Determined ineligible after being approached: Based on their responses to 
Form [ADDRESS_1215455] the reason(s) the participant was found ineligible after 
being approached. These should also be recorded on Form 1. Ask the 
participant all of the eligibility questions  regardless of eligibility status.

a participant was enrolled but not randomized (i.e. if # Enrolled ≠ # 
Randomized for the week) record the reason(s) for  not being randomized, 
with each reason being separated by [CONTACT_870558]. The reason for not being 
randomized should also be recorded on Form 2. Reasons for not being 
randomized include ROM with dilator placement; patient withdrew from 
study before randomization;  physician unable to complete injection;

record their response.  
 
B. Protocol deviations log  
Proto col deviations are any deviation from the IRB -approved protocol that are not 
approved prospectively by [CONTACT_1201]. Major protocol deviations are deviations from 
the protocol that have the potential to negatively impact subject safety, the 
integrity of study data, or a subject’s willingness to participate in the study. Minor 
protocol deviations are deviations that do not have the potential to negatively 
impact subjects, their willingness to participate or data integrity.  
 
All protocol deviations must be reported to the coordinating  center within [ADDRESS_1215456] be recorded on the Protocol Deviations Logs as follows:  
• Record the Site ID (SF, LJ, LA, LB) in the designated s pace at the top of 
each page of the Protocol Deviations Log  
 
• Enrollment  ID: Record the patient’s assigned Enrollment ID

D. Adverse events log  
Adverse events are any illness, pain or complication that occurred within the 
duration of the study. These may be expected (listed in Section VIII) or 
unexpected and may or may not related to the study participation. Each Adverse 
Event should be recorded on its own line even if it is related to another event 
(e.g. nausea & vomiting are two distinct AE’s and should be recorded 
individually). For each adverse event record:  
• Enrollment ID : Record the patient’s assigned Enrollment ID  
o If the same AE occurs for different patients (e.g. two patients both 
experience nausea) record this as two different AE’s.

complication. Whenever possible include a medical diagnosis if available.  
 
• Date Onset : Record the date the adverse event was first noticed  
 
• Date Resolved:  Record the date the AE resolved. If the AE is ongoing, 
write “Ongoing”  
 
• SAE:  Report whether the AE reported is considered a SAE (criteria for 
SAE’s covered in Section VIII) by [CONTACT_62262] “Yes” or “No”. If checked “Yes” 
follow SAE reporting protocol elaborat ed in Section VIII of this SOP.  
 
• AE Severity : Report the severity of the AE using the following numerical 
code: Mild=1, Moderate=2, Severe=3. Definitions for each are provided 
below:  
• AE Outcome : Record the outcom e of the AE by [CONTACT_565] “1” if the AE 
recovered/resolved, “2” if the AE is ongoing, “3” if the AE resulted in the 
death of the participant, and “4” if the AE outcome is unknown.  
 
• Relation to Study Drug : Record whether the study clinician believes that 
the A E is related to the study drug by [CONTACT_44745] “1” if the clinician believes 
the event to be unrelated, “2” if it is unlikely related, “3” if it is possibly 
related, “4” if it is probably related, or “5” if it is definitely related.  
 
• Treatment Needed:  Record whether any treatment was required for the 
AE by [CONTACT_565] “1” for no treatment, “2” for medication treatment and “3” for 
Non-drug treatment. Specify the medication or non- drug treatment on the 
lines provided on the AE log below the chart.  
 
E. Participant log  Mild:  Symptoms were annoying but did not get in the way of your usual 
activities.  
 
Moderate: Symptoms got in the way as you tried to do your usual activities but 
you were still able to do most of the things you needed to.

- In order to scan the forms please email them to:  Chiara.corbetta-
rastelli@ucsf .edu 
 
B. Queries  
 
The coordinating center will send data queries to the site study coordinators at 
each site as needed, with an average response time of 14 days following data 
collection forms being sent . These queries will be based on submitted data 
collection forms. Queries will be sent  via email. Site study coordinators should 
ensure that queries are addressed appropriately and responses are sent to the 
coordinating center in a timely manner. Responses should be sent from the site 
to the coordinating center via email.  
 
C. Sending Logs to the Coordinating Center  
 
Study sites should send the following Logs to the coordinating center in the time 
frame indicated:  
- Adverse Events Log : Send a copy to the coordinating center on a weekly 
basis . This log can be scanned/emailed ( chiara.corbetta-
[EMAIL_16499]) . If no adverse events have occurred during that week, 
site study staff should email chiara.corbetta- [EMAIL_16499]  to report 
that no adverse events occurred during the preceding week.  
 
D. Protocol Updates  
Protocol updates will be emailed to site investigators by [CONTACT_458] 
[INVESTIGATOR_870529]. A copy of each update should be 
printed and placed in the site’s Study Binder. The coordinating center will keep a 
Master Protocol Updates Log of every update that is issued. A copy of this log 
can be requested at any time by a site as well.

Version 9 12/13/[ADDRESS_1215460]’s participation in the research, whether or not it is considered 
related to the subject’s participation in the research.  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that:  
Is life threatening  
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_870530] a permanent or serious disability  
Results in a congenital abnormality  
Results in death  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life-
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in 
this definition. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an Emergency 
Room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias, or convulsions 
that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.  
 
Reporting SAEs  
 
All SAEs, whether or  not there is a probable relationship with the study drug or 
with the stud y procedures, must be reported by [CONTACT_870564] 24hrs of his/her becoming aw are of the 
SAE. Coordinating center staff will re port SAEs promptly to NEIRB and the 
IDMC. Sites using their own IRB must additionally report the SAE to their IRB  
(FPAWH in Long Beach and Los Angeles should report any SAE’s to the 
Coordinating center. Lovejoy clinic should report any SAE’s to both the 
Coordinating Center and their own IRB).  Site investigators must also report all 
SAEs  occurring  up to two weeks after the participant is discharged from the study 
IF the event is thought  to be related or possibly/probably related to the study.  
 
Reporting of a SAE can be done by [CONTACT_61529]. When reporting a SAE to the 
coordinating center, the site investigator should refer to the subject by [CONTACT_870565]. Sites will work with the coordinating 
center to complet e the Serious Adv erse Event Reporting Form after this initial 
contact [CONTACT_870566].

Assessing AEs  
 
Monitoring for and documentation of adverse events related to the cervical 
dilation, medication injection and/or D&E of s tudy participants, whether 
anticipated or unanticipated, is the responsibility of the site investigator, who will 
maintain oversight of the site’s adverse events, but she may delegate collection 
of information related to this function to the site’s researc h coordinator.   
 
Possible adverse events related to the medication injection include those below.  
- Injection site pain or bruising  
- Nausea and vomiting  
o Only report in AE log if patient reports severe nausea or vomiting, 
patient treated with more than one anti -emetic agent (ex. Zofran 
and Compazine), or patient treated with multiple doses of  anti-
emetic agent (ex. Patient given 3 doses of Zofran for nausea).  
- Out of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_870532]  
- Bradycardia 
- Endometritis, sepsis  
 
Possible adverse events related to the D&E include those below. None of the 
risks listed below would be solely due to the study procedures but are rather 
potential adverse events that may be related to standard D&E or 
anesthesia/analgesia/uterotonic agents that accompany the D&E.  
 
- Hemorrhage  
o Requiring intrauterine tamponade (with Foley, Bakri, packing)  
o Requiring transfusion  
o Requiring embolization  
- Uterine re- evacuation (for retained tissue, hem atometra, bleeding)  
- Endometritis, sepsis  
- Cervical laceration requiring stitches  
- Uterine perforation  
- Abdominal surgery (laparoscopy, laparotomy, hysterectomy)  
Standard Operating Procedure - Intrafetal digoxin as an adjuvant for dilation and evacuation at 20 to 24 
weeks’ gestation: a placebo-controlled, double- blinded randomized controlled trial.  
Version 9 12/13/17   52 - Transfer to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_870533] (even if the subject is not 
admitted)  
- Allergic reactio n/hypersensitivity /anaphylactic shock  
- Vasovagal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]  
- Syncope  
- Anesthesia complications  
- Cardiopulmonary arrest  
 
These adverse events should be documented on Form #2 if they occur on Day 1 
and Form #4 if they occur on Day 2 for acute events and Form #5 for  delayed 
events and on the Adverse Event Log. The Adverse Event Log will include an 
assessment of whether the adverse event is unrelated, possibly/probably related, 
or related to the study medications. A copy of the Adverse Event Log should be 
sent from each site to the coordinating on a weekly  basis. Any adverse events 
that is unexpected (not on list above) and related or possibly/probably related 
must be reported to the coordinati ng center within [ADDRESS_1215461] Operating Procedure - Intrafetal digoxin as an adjuvant for dilation and evacuation at 20 to 24 
weeks’ gestation: a placebo-controlled, double- blinded randomized controlled trial.  
Version 9 12/13/17   53 IX. Detailed Data Analysis Plan  
 
Efficacy endpoints  
Primary endpoint : comparison of D&E operative time between two study arms 
(digoxin injection vs placebo injection)  
Secondary endpoints : comparison of ease of procedure, achievement of fetal 
demise, and procedure complications between two study arms (digoxin injection 
vs placebo injection).  
 
Safety end points  
The Data and Safety Monitoring Board will provide recommendations about 
starting, continuing and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098].  Safety evaluations will monitor for 
statistically significant higher complication rates than complication rates for clinic 
in procedures of same gestational duration and for adverse events.  The DSMB 
will meet to determine criteria for interim analysis and for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356].  
 
Statistical analysis 
For primary outcome analysis, we will use an intention- to-treat analysis and 
compare median procedure time using a paired t test. To control for site, we will 
conduct a regression with site as the single factor. In the event that any potential 
confounders are not balanced by [CONTACT_17628], we will control for those in the 
analysis. Control ling for site will not necessitate an increase in our sample size. 
We will do descriptive analyses of secondary outcomes using chi -square 
and t tests where appropriate.  
 
Sample size  
Sample size was calculated for the primary outcome of procedure time. In order 
to detect at least a 3- minute difference in procedure time between groups with 
80% power and alpha of 0.05 (using a 2- way test), we would need [ADDRESS_1215462] was randomized, 
received the i njection and dilators, then failed to return for her procedure. In order 
to account for this rare but possible situation, we intend to enroll  a total sample of 
N=180 subjects .

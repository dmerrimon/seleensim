2.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
Human papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] (HPV) infection, which is sexually transmitted, leads to a wide range of 
conditions in women from genital warts and precancerous cervical dysplasia to cancers of the genital tract 
and elsewhere. Globally, 9 million cases of precancerous high-grade “cervical intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_28601] 
(CIN 2/3) are detected annually through cervical cancer screening programs; 330,000 in the U.S. alone.1 
Persistent infection with oncogenic (“high-risk”) HPV types is one of the most important risk factors for 
development of CIN 2/[ADDRESS_1284917] medical costs in the U.S. associated with 
both screening for and treating HPV-associated diseases is estimated to be $8.0 billion dollars, over 80% 
of which is for routine cervical cancer screening and follow-up.[ADDRESS_1284918] in patients 
with pre-existing HPV-associated cervical lesions.6-8 Treatment options for CIN 2-3 involve a variety of 
destructive or excisional procedures, although in the U.S. excision is generally favored in these women at 
higher risk of invasive cervical cancer as it allows for pathologic evaluation of the specimen for diagnosis 
and for evaluation of surgical margins. Ablation techniques typi[INVESTIGATOR_914450], electrosurgery or laser. 
A major concern with the destructive or excisional treatment modalities currently available for 
CIN 2-3 include future obstetric risk (pregnancy loss, preterm premature rupture of membranes, and 
preterm delivery) and cervical stenosis, or narrowing of the cervical canal, which can result from scarring 
after treatment. The risk of cervical stenosis after an excision procedure was shown to be 7% in one study 
and this can have several negative outcomes including difficulty with normal cervical dilation during 
labor, difficulty with common office procedures (e.g., endometrial biopsy), and might impede normal 
menstrual flow.[ADDRESS_1284919] a preterm delivery and had a significantly higher 
risk of a late abortion (< 24 weeks gestation) compared with women who gave birth prior to the surgical 
excision.[ADDRESS_1284920] 
been unsuccessful.11,12 We believe that one of the problems in current therapeutic vaccine approaches is 
the lack of effector T cell migration to the sites of infection. Although systemic memory T cells can gain 
entry to certain organs, other anatomic locations including the vagina are immunologically restrictive and 
prevent entry of memory T cells.13 Inflammation or infection is often needed to permit entry of 
systemically circulating activated T cells into restrictive tissues to establish tissue-resident memory T 
cells.14-17 
Our group has recently reported a highly effective vaccination strategy (“prime and pull”) to 
establish tissue-resident memory T cells in the genital tract.18 An initial systemic T cell response is 
triggered (“prime”) by [CONTACT_914489]. Activated T cells are then recruited into the genital 
mucosa (“pull”) through the application of specific chemokines to the restrictive genital tract and then 
establish a long-term tissue-resident memory T cell (T RM) pool and mediate protective immunity.14 In

Imiquimod, a topi[INVESTIGATOR_914451], has antiviral and antitumor activity, induces 
cytokines including interferon, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukins 1, 6, and 8, and activates T cells 
triggering an immune response associated with HPV clearance.19,20 Imiquimod is approved for treatment 
of genital warts, 90% of which are caused by [CONTACT_105]-oncogenic HPV types 6 and 11.21,22 One group has 
studied the use of imiquimod in the weeks prior to a planned surgical cervical excision procedure as a 
potential method for reducing recurrence of disease.23 They found application of imiquimod to the cervix 
to be safe and tolerable. Only one prior study has evaluated the efficacy of imiquimod for therapeutic 
purposes in high grade cervical dysplasia. This Austrian study on the efficacy of imiquimod for treatment 
of CIN 2/3, found significantly higher rates of histologic regression (73% vs 39%) and complete remission 
(47% vs 14%) in the imiquimod group.24 We are not aware, however, of any published study evaluating 
a “prime and pull” vaccination strategy for the potential treatment of CIN 2/3 in women. In the case of 
imiquimod treatment alone, this relies on the ability of T cell responses to endogenous antigens to elicit 
clearance of the HPV infected cells. 
We believe that “prime and pull” will provide further protection to imiquimod treatment alone, by 
[CONTACT_914491] T cell responses that can be pulled into the genital mucosa using chemokines induced by 
[CONTACT_914492]. Currently, a 9-valent prophylactic HPV vaccine (9vHPV) is commercially 
available and provides protection against 7 high-risk HPV types that cause 90% of all cervical cancers 
(and protects against 2 additional HPV types that cause 90% of all genital warts).22 9vHPV is a sub-unit 
protein vaccine; vectors expressing the papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] L1 gene have been used to generate virus like 
particles (VLPs) that mimic the wild type virus capsid morphologically and antigenically but contain no

neutralizing antibody response which prevents incident infection.25,[ADDRESS_1284922] that a “prime and pull” vaccination strategy may provide

5.3 Exploratory Objectives 
5.3.1  In the translational research component of this study we are planning to systematically evaluate 
and compare T cell infiltration into the cervical dysplasia and correlate with clinical response. The 
ultimate goal being to determine if the prime and pull strategy of Imiquimod + HPV vaccine leads to the 
establishment of T RM cells and if this correlates to clinical regression of high-grade cervical dysplasia. 
The pre- and post-treatment cervical biopsies will be examined to determine the frequencies and 
anatomical distributions of CD4 and CD8 T cells within the CIN. We will stain paraffin embedded tissue 
sections with antibodies to CD4 and CD8. These sections will be costained with well-established markers 
of human T RM (CD69, CD103).31 The comparison of T RM frequencies and distributions will be conducted 
both within the individual (pre and post prime and pull) as well as amongst the groups at the relevant 
time points. We will assess possible correlation between T RM and viral clearance and clinical outcomes. 
Because the biopsy sample is quite limited in size, we will also collect cells from the endocervical 
cytobrush to analyze the local T cell populations. The protocol for isolating and analyzing T cells from 
cytobrush is well established.[ADDRESS_1284939] to their

Additional components of visit outline by [CONTACT_2060]:
(1) Control group: Observation at specified study timepoints. 
(2) Imiquimod only: At the baseline visit, this group will receive instruction on imiquimod self 
application (16 week course) using a 6.[ADDRESS_1284948] vaginal suppository 
application and side effects will be recorded per NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE 4.0). Imiquimod self-application regimen will be similar to one previously 
described24 and is as follows:
Treatment weeks 1 and 2:  Subjects apply one vaginal suppository per week
Treatment weeks 3 and 4: Subjects apply two vaginal suppositories per week
Treatment weeks 5 to 16: Subjects apply three vaginal suppositories per week
Vaginal suppositories will be self-applied by [CONTACT_914502]. 
Subjects will be advised not to have sexual intercourse during the nights in which they applied 
vaginal suppositories and to perform a vaginal douche in the morning. Subjects will be instructed 
to suspend the application of vaginal suppositories during the first 3 days of their menses. Subjects 
will be advised to keep the study medication refrigerated. In case of persistent side effects in 
subjects of the imiquimod group, the dose of the study medication will be modified and participants 
will receive vaginal suppositories containing only 50% of the original imiquimod dose (vaginal 
suppositories containing 3.125 mg imiquimod).
Missed doses of imiquimod can be made up the following day. Otherwise, the dose must be 
skipped and subjects should take the next scheduled dose at the usual time. 
Imiquimod will be dispensed in boxes containing 18 vaginal suppositories (treatment weeks 1-8) 
at the beginning of the treatment course. During follow up visit at week 8 (see below), subjects 
will be provided a new box of 24 vaginal suppositories to complete treatment course for weeks 9-
16. Study drug will be prescribed by [CONTACT_914503].

7.2 Management of adverse events, concomitant therapy, restrictions and rescue treatment
7.2.1 Rescue medication, emergency procedures, and additional treatment(s)
[IP_ADDRESS] Rescue medication
Rescue medications to reverse the actions of imiquimod are not available. There is no specific antidote 
for overdosage. Potential adverse events should be treated symptomatically. Common adverse events of 
treatment with imiquimod with specified management recommendations and/or requirements include 
local inflammatory reactions with site itching or burning or localized edema and occasionally 
accompanied by [CONTACT_914505], respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], or infectious symptoms. To improve tolerability and the 
probability of clinical benefit, subjects should receive prompt and appropriate supportive care at the first 
signs of symptoms. Suggested treatments for AEs are described below.
[IP_ADDRESS] Concomitant treatment(s)
Concomitant medications or therapy to provide adequate supportive care may be given as clinically 
necessary. 
All concomitant therapy, including anaesthetic agents, vitamins, homeopathic/herbal remedies, nutritional 
supplements, must be recorded in the (e)CRF during the screening and treatment period, starting from the 
date of signature [CONTACT_43998], and ending at the EOT visit. After the EOT visit, only concomitant 
therapy indicated for treatment of an AE has to be reported.

In case of major surgery (as judged by [CONTACT_093]), it is recommended to stop treatment with 
imiquimod around one week prior to the surgery, and to restart treatment after surgery (unless surgery 
involves genitourinary or anogenital tracts in which case treatment should be suspended until complete 
wound healing achieved). If imiquimod is interrupted for more than [ADDRESS_1284955] infection or flu-like symptoms. Treatment of these side-effects should be proactive

[IP_ADDRESS] Management of dermatologic and local inflammatory adverse events following 
treatment with imiquimod
Dermatologic adverse events including localized erythema, xeroderma, crusted skin, erosion or ulceration, 
edema, vulvar pain or pruritus can occur after a few applications of imiquimod. Although usually mild to 
moderate, dermatologic reactions can cause significant discomfort (Table [IP_ADDRESS]: 2).

[IP_ADDRESS] Restrictions on diet and life style
Subjects should be advised there are no dietary restrictions.
To prevent skin related adverse events it is recommended to avoid intense irradiation with UV light and 
harsh detergents. In addition, subjects will be advised not to have sexual intercourse during the nights in 
which they applied vaginal suppositories and to perform a vaginal douche in the morning. Subjects will 
be instructed to suspend the application of vaginal suppositories during the first 3 days of their menses
[IP_ADDRESS] Women of Child-Bearing Potential and Pregnancy Prevention
Subjects who are not of childbearing potential due to being postmenopausal (1 year without menstruation) 
or surgical sterilisation (bilateral oophorectomy and/or tubal ligation) do not need to use contraception to 
be eligible for the trial.
All other subjects are considered to have childbearing potential and must use adequate contraception 
throughout the trial (from screening until end of trial participation).
Acceptable methods of contraception include surgical sterilisation and double barrier method, and must 
be in accordance with local regulations where applicable. Double barrier method of contraception is 
defined as two barrier methods used simultaneously each time the subject has intercourse. Accepted 
barrier methods include diaphragm, female condom, cervical cap, male condom and intrauterine device 
(IUD) (the diaphragm and cervical cap must be used in conjunction with spermicidal jelly/cream). Those 
using hormonal contraceptives, or with partners using hormonal contraceptives, must also be using an 
additional approved method of contraception (as described above).  Partner vasectomy, natural "rhythm" 
and spermicidal jelly/cream are not acceptable methods of contraception.

setting of treatment related toxicities. Subjects experiencing allergic reactions as described in table below 
will not receive additional doses of the HPV vaccine per FDA and CDC guidelines. Subjects experiencing 
local, self-limited site reactions will be eligible to receive additional doses of the vaccine.

8.2 Management of adverse events, concomitant therapy, restrictions and rescue treatment
8.2.1 Rescue medication, emergency procedures, and additional treatment(s)
[IP_ADDRESS] Rescue medication
Rescue medications to reverse the actions of 9-valent HPV vaccine are not available.  Potential adverse 
events should be treated symptomatically. Common adverse events of vaccination with 9-valent HPV 
vaccine with specified management recommendations and/or requirements include local reactions with 
pain, swelling or erythema at injection site and occasionally headaches or syncope. Rare events include 
anaphylactoid/hypersensitivity reactions which should serve as contraindication to administration of 
additional doses of 9-valent HPV vaccine as described above. To improve tolerability and the probability 
of clinical benefit, subjects should receive prompt and appropriate supportive care at the first signs of 
symptoms. Suggested treatments for AEs are described below.
[IP_ADDRESS] Concomitant treatment(s)
Concomitant medications or therapy to provide adequate supportive care may be given as clinically 
necessary. 
All concomitant therapy, including anaesthetic agents, vitamins, homeopathic/herbal remedies, nutritional 
supplements, must be recorded in the (e)CRF during the screening and treatment period, starting from the 
date of signature [CONTACT_43998], and ending at the EOT visit. After the EOT visit, only concomitant 
therapy indicated for treatment of an AE has to be reported. 
If vaccination is delayed by [CONTACT_726] 21 days, the decision to continue will be made by [CONTACT_093].
[IP_ADDRESS] Emergency procedures
Careful management and assessment of all subjects with syncope should be performed to prevent serious 
secondary injuries (skull fracture, cerebral haemorrhage). Procedures will be in place to avoid injuries 
from falling and to restore cerebral perfusion if syncope occurs. 
Subjects who develop anaphylactoid/hypersensitivity symptoms (symptomatic bronchospasm with or 
without urticarial, angioedema, hypotension) should receive immediate treatment including epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 
1:1000. If anaphylactoid/hypersensitivity reaction to 9-valent HPV is suspected, additional doses of the 
vaccine should be discontinued.

10.0 EVALUATION CRITERIA
10.1  Objective Response
The major parameters of response to be assessed include treatment efficacy defined as 
histologic regression of cervical dysplasia to CIN 1 or less 12 to 16 weeks after the end of 
imiquimod treatment, HPV clearance and treatment tolerance.
10.11 Histologic regression: Only subjects with histologically confirmed CIN 2,[ADDRESS_1284967] areas of residual disease. Included in the 
evaluations are the following criteria:  
Histologic regression (HR): Histologic regression of all index lesions to CIN 1 
or less at 12 to 16 weeks after end of imiquimod treatment period.
Histologic remission (HM):  Complete regression of cervical dysplasia at all 
index biopsy sites at 12 to 16 weeks after end of imiquimod treatment period.
 
Persistent Disease (PR):  One or more index lesions persists with CIN 
2,3 high grade dysplasia or new lesions are identified colposcopi[INVESTIGATOR_914468] 2,3.
Progressive Disease (PD): Worsening histology of an index lesion.
10.12 HPV Clearance: HPV clearance will be measured by [CONTACT_914507] 14 high risk HPV types as well as HPV 16/18 genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_914469]. 
10.13 Treatment Tolerance: The grade level of the various toxicities will be classified using 
the Common Toxicity Criteria, version 4 (CTC, v.4) guidelines. Acute toxicities 
will be scored if occurring </= 30 days from treatment completion, and chronic if 
> 30 days. Frequency and duration of treatment interruptions due to the treatment 
toxicity will be assessed.

12.0 STUDY MONITORING AND REPORTING PROCEDURES 
12.1 Personnel responsible for the safety review and its frequency:
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_22413], assuring protocol compliance, and 
conducting the safety reviews at the specified frequency which must be conducted at a minimum of every 
6 months (including when re-approval of the protocol is sought).  During the review process, the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_22420], require modification/amendment, 
or close to enrollment. Either the principal investigator, the IRB or the Yale Cancer Center Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC) have the authority to stop or suspend the study or require modifications.
12.2 The risks associated with the current study are deemed moderate for the following reasons: 
1. The risk of progression of CIN 2,[ADDRESS_1284969] assessed the proposed study as one of moderate risk, the potential exists for anticipated 
and/or unanticipated adverse events, serious or otherwise, to occur since it is not possible to predict with 
certainty the absolute risk in any given individual or in advance of first-hand experience with the proposed 
study methods. Therefore, we provide a plan for monitoring the data and safety of the proposed study as 
follows:
12.3 Attribution of Adverse Events:
Adverse events will be monitored for each subject participating in the study and attributed to the study 
procedures / design by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Alessandro Santin, according to the following

d.) Unlikely: Adverse event is likely not to be related to the investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
e.) Unrelated: Adverse event is clearly not related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
12.4 Plan for Grading Adverse Events:
The following scale will be used in grading the severity of adverse events noted during the study:
1. Mild adverse event
2. Moderate adverse event
3. Severe 
12.5 Plan for Determining Seriousness of Adverse Events:
An adverse event may be graded as severe but still not meet the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event.  
Similarly, an adverse event may be graded as moderate but still meet the criteria for an SAE.  It is 
important for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_22415] “seriousness” when determining 
whether reporting to the IRB is necessary.
Refer to Section 13.0 of the protocol for guidelines
12.6 Plan for reporting Reportable Adverse Events and other unanticipated problems involving 
risks to subjects or others to the IRB
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_22416]: a) adverse events that are 
serious or life-threatening AND unanticipated (or anticipated but occurring with a greater frequency than 
expected) AND possibly, probably or definitely related to the drug/device/intervention; and b) other 
unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others.
These adverse events or unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others will be reported to 
the IRB in accordance with IRB Policy 710, using the appropriate forms found on the website. This 
information is discussed in Section 13.0 of the protocol.
12.7 Plan for reporting adverse events to co-investigators on the study, as appropriate the protocol’s 
research monitor(s), e.g., Yale Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), 
Protocol Review Committee (PRC), DSMBs, study sponsors, funding and regulatory agencies, and

in case of 9-valent HPV vaccine, reappears upon re-challenge.
No
Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than imiquimod or 9-vvalent HPV 
vaccine (e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or 
concomitant medication); and/or the AE has no plausible temporal relationship to 
imiquimod or 9-valent HPV vaccine administration (e.g., cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_1284974] dose of study drug).
Expected adverse events are those adverse events that are listed or characterized in the Package Insert or 
current Investigator Brochure. 
Unexpected adverse events are those not listed in the Package Insert (P.I.) or current Investigator 
Brochure (I.B.) or not identified.  This includes adverse events for which the specificity or severity is not 
consistent with the description in the P.I. or I.B.  For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis 
would be unexpected if the P.I. or I.B. only referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Refer to 
Section 13.[ADDRESS_1284975] evaluation time points should be adopted.

a. Diagnosis vs. Signs and Symptoms
If known at the time of reporting, a diagnosis should be reported rather than individual signs and 
symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated 
transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically 
characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, it is ok to report the 
information that is currently available.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it should be 
reported as follow-up information.
b. Deaths
All deaths that occur during the conduct of the research must be reported to the Yale Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_886302] (if possible) to ensure that all 
over site committees are properly informed.  All information will be entered into Oncore Clinical 
Trials Management System and updated appropriately.  Further determination regarding the need 
to submit to the subjects local IRB, Yale University HHRP following IRB Policy 710 for reporting 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects will be reviewed. Specific information is 
outlined in section 13.0 of the protocol. 
When recording a death, the event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome 
should be reported as the single medical concept.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be 
ascertained at the time of reporting, report “Unexplained Death”.
c. Preexisting Medical Conditions
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  Such conditions 
should be reported as medical and surgical history.
A preexisting medical condition should be re-assessed throughout the trial and reported as an AE 
or SAE only if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  
When reporting such events, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition 
has changed by [CONTACT_9672] (e.g., “more frequent headaches”).

e. Pregnancy
If a female subject becomes pregnant while receiving imiquimod or 9-valent HPV vaccine series 
or within [ADDRESS_1284978] receiving Imiquimod, whether accidental, therapeutic, 
or spontaneous, should always be classified as serious, and expeditiously reported as an SAE.  
Similarly, any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female subject exposed to 
imiquimod or 9-valent HPV vaccine should be reported as an SAE.
f. Post-Study Adverse Events
The investigator should expeditiously report any SAE occurring after a subject has completed or 
discontinued study participation if attributed to prior Imiquimod or 9-valent HPV vaccine 
exposure.
If the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or a congenital anomaly in 
a subsequently conceived offspring of a female subject who participated in the study, this should 
be reported as an SAE.

15.0   DATA ANALYSIS / STATISTICAL METHODS 
The analyses and methods described in this section, for this randomized, Phase II, single-blinded,  3-arm 
clinical trial, apply to the primary, secondary, and exploratory/correlative objectives provided in Sections 
1.1 to 1.3.  
15.1 General Statistical Considerations
Type I error for hypothesis testing will be α = 0.05, and 95% confidence intervals will be used for 
parameter estimation, unless otherwise specified.  Type II error will be based on β = 0.10, unless 
otherwise specified.  Only the primary analysis will use an adjustment for multiple comparisons.
Summary statistics for continuous variables will include (but may not be limited to) the number of 
observations, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median and maximum. For categorical 
variables, summary statistics will include (but may not be limited to) counts, percentages, and 
cross-tabulation tables.
Standard diagnostics will be performed to assess whether the assumptions for specific parametric 
statistical methods are adequately supported by [CONTACT_26739].  Should parametric methods be 
inappropriate, the analogous non-parametric methods will be used and only these results will be 
reported.
Imputation of missing values will not be applied.
No interim analyses for efficacy or futility are planned, although the trial may be stopped early 
based on observations from continual safety monitoring.
Data analysis will be conducted using SAS® v9.4 (or later).

The primary outcome is histologic regression (yes/no) after completion of the 12 to 16 weeks imiquimod 
course. The full definition of histologic regression and how it is determined is described in Section 5.1. 
The co-primary hypothesis tests are: 
{H01: p1 - p0 = 0  versus H 11: p1 - p0 > 0}  
and
{H02: p2 - p0 = 0  versus H 12: p2 - p0 > 0}
p0, p1, and p [ADDRESS_1284985] histologically regressed.  Fisher’s Exact Test will be used to assess if the data support rejecting the

adjustment for multiple comparisons with one-sided α = (0.05)/2 = 0.[ADDRESS_1284986] 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for p 1 - p 0 and for   p2 - p 0.  
Confidence intervals for ‘risk ratios’ (p 1/p0, p2/p0) in addition to ‘risk differences’ (p 1 - p0, p2 - p0)  may 
also be estimated.  The main analysis will use the modified ITT analysis set.  Sensitivity analyses for the

to characterize treatment safety and tolerability using descriptive statistics (safety analysis set)
15.7  Exploratory/Correlative Objectives
To characterize the association of  T cell infiltration  into the cervical dysplasia (i.e. frequencies and 
anatomical distributions of CD4 and CD8 T cells within the CIN)  and pre- and post-immune therapy 
responses to  HPV16/[ADDRESS_1284989] peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and serum with 
clinical outcomes (histologic regression/remission) and viral clearance . TRM frequencies ,distributions 
and responses will be measured within subjects (pre and post ‘prime and pull’), and changes from baseline 
will be compared between the treatment groups at relevant time points. Descriptive summary statistics 
will be used to evaluate associations and ANOVA will be the used to test the statistical significance of 
associations. The main analysis will use the modified ITT analysis set.  Sensitivity analyses for the same 
statistical method using the modified ITT completers and/or per protocol analysis sets may also be 
provided.
15.8 Sample Size Justification
Anticipated annual accrual is approximately 40-45 subjects. 
Our general philosophy regarding Phase II trials of new drug combinations is to facilitate the prompt 
discovery of inactive agents, yet allow for a reasonable estimate of the response rates for those regimens 
demonstrating some degree of activity. However, excessive accrual to inactive study regimens to 
document precise response rates is to be avoided. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the activity and 
potential toxicity of the combination therapy of Imiquimod + HPV vaccine in subjects with untreated 
high-grade CIN 2,[ADDRESS_1284990] of Imiquimod + HPV vaccine compared to observation as 
well as Imiquimod alone compared to observation. 
Based on published literature for the primary outcome,38 we assume a 28% spontaneous histological 
regression rate in CIN 2-3 lesions with observation alone (control group). From Grimm et al.’s efficacy

Protocol version 11.0
Version date: December 20, [ADDRESS_1284991] a 35% 
absolute increase in rate of histologic regression in the imiquimod only arm compared to control. Based 
on this data, we consider a conservative effect size estimate also of an absolute 35% higher rate of 
histologic regression in the imiquimod + HPV vaccine intervention arm compared with the control arm. 
We therefore aim to recruit a total sample size of 114 subjects (38 in each arm). Calculations based on 
Fisher’s Exact Test indicate we will have ≥ 90% power to detect a treatment effect of ≥ 29% in both 
treatment arms independently compared to the observation arm (α = 0.025 for each comparison to control). 
In addition, with n = [ADDRESS_1284992] 80% power to detect a treatment effect size of ≥ 
25% in one treatment arm compared to placebo (while maintaining 90% power to detect the treatment 
effect size of ≥ 29% in the other arm). Assuming a subject dropout rate of 20%, a total sample size of 138 
(n = 46 per arm) subjects is calculated which will be recruited over 5 years.

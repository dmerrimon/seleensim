1.0 Background and Significance 
Version 2.0  
Date: 6.21.2011 -

1.1 Background 
 
 In the [LOCATION_003] and Western Europe, nas opharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) accounts for 
less than 1% of malignancies.  The average incidence increases 80-f old in endemic areas 
such as Southern China.  NPC is a neopla sm that differs from other squamous cell 
carcinomas of the head and neck with regard to epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], histologic features, 
treatment strategies, and treatment respons e.  Due to the anatomical location, 
nasopharyngeal cancers are considered un resectable.  The c onventional treatment 
approach has been radiation.  Local control rates with conventional once daily radiation are 
75% or higher for Stage I and II diseases but  decrease to 20 - 70 % for Stage III and IV 
diseases.  For patients with advanced NPC (sta ge III - IV) treated with radiation alone, the 
5-year survival rates are only 10 - 40% (1 - 7).    
 The predominant patterns of failure for locally advanced NPC are local recurrence 
and distant metastasis.  In a retrospective analysis of 1301 patients with NPC, locoregional recurrence was shown to be  an independent prognostic indicator of 
subsequent distant metastases (8).  Achieving local control is therefore important in the 
treatment of nasopha ryngeal carcinoma. 
 
1.[ADDRESS_186307] of care of treatment in the [LOCATION_002] is concurrent chemoradiation followed by [CONTACT_72625], based on the results of the Intergroup study (SWOG/RTOG/ECOG), which showed improved progression-free and 
overall survival with chemoradiation compared  with radiation alon e (9).  The study 
compared radiotherapy (70 Gy) alone to chemotherapy concurrent with radiotherapy followed by [CONTACT_160598].  This revealed a statistically significant increase in 3-year progression-free survival (69% versus 24%) and 
3-year overall survival (76% versus 46%) in fa vor of the chemoradiotherapy arm.  Lin et Al 
recently reported increased progression-free and overall survival rates in patients who received 2 cycles of continuous cisplatin an d fluorouracil chemotherapy during radiotherapy 
compared to radiotherapy alone in patie nts with locally advanced nasopharyngeal 
carcinoma in endemic areas (10).  Chan et al in a randomized trial of 350 patients, showed that patients who received week ly cisplatin of 40 mg/m² du ring radiation had a prolonged 
progression-free survival compared to patients who received radiation alone (11).  These studies suggest that concurrent chemoradiation with or without adjuvant chemotherapy is 
superior to radiotherapy alone in patients with locally advanced NPC in edemic and non-
edemic areas.  
 
1.3 Rationale of using proton radiotherapy  
  
 In the Intergroup randomized study, only 63% of patients received all three courses 
of concurrent cisplatin and 55% received all three courses of adjuvant chemotherapy.  
Version 2.0  
Date: 6.21.2011 -  
 6Twenty-eight percent of patients in the radi otherapy alone arm experienced grade 3 and 4 
mucositis compared to 37% in the chemoradiation arm.  Two percent of patients in the radiotherapy arm experienced severe (grade 4) mucositis compared to 12% in the chemoradiation arm (9).  In the randomized tr ial of concurrent weekly cisplatin with 
radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone by [CONTACT_160599], the progression-free survival was not 
statistically significant between the two arms (11).  The percentage of patients completing at least four cycles of chemotherapy during external radiotherapy was 78%.  This number 
dropped to 60% and 44% for five and six cy cles, respectively.  In this study, mucos itis 
was the most common reason of  discontinuing chemotherapy.  These data suggest that if 
one can reduce acute treatment toxicity from concurrent ch emoradiation, one may increase 
treatment compliance and theref ore treatment outcome.   
  Because of the anatomic location of the nasopharynx, radiation treatment with 
and without chemotherapy is a ssociated with significant trea tment-related toxicity such 
as brain necrosis, audio-visual toxicity, ra diation encephalopathy, radiation myelitis, and 
cranial nerve paralysis.  Xerostomia a nd swallowing dysfunction are also the major 
complaints in patients who have undergone c onventional external be am radiation therapy 
to the nasopharynx.  Protons are charged partic les, with similar biological effect as X-
rays.  The advantage of protons lies in their physical do se distribution.  Due to the 
defined range of protons (i.e. Bragg peak),  dose distribution can be designed that 
conforms more closely to the tumor volume ( 12).  This superior physical property of 
proton allowed less radiation to the normal surrounding tissu es, therefore expected to 
result in decreased acute and late toxicities.    
 The goal of using proton therapy is ther efore to: 1) test the hypothesis that 
reduction of radiation dose to normal tissu e can reduce acute toxicity and increase 
treatment compliance to the combined modality treatment and 2) to decrease late toxicity 
and improve health relate d quality-of-life outcomes. 
 
1.4 Preliminary experience of proton radiotherapy for T4 nasopharyngeal carcinoma   
  
 At the [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], proton beam radiotherapy has been used 
to treat locally advanced nasopharyngeal  carcinoma.  Between 1990 and 2002, 17 
patients with newly diagnosed T4 N0-3 na sopharyngeal carcinoma received combined 
conformal proton and photon radiotherapy.  Seventy-one percenta ge of patients had 
World Health Organization type 2 - 3 histology  The median prescribed dose to the gross 
target volume  was 73.6 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent (CGE) (range 69 - 76.8).  Eleven 
patients received accelerated  hyperfractionated radiotherapy.  Ten patients received 
induction or concurrent chemotherapy.  All patients except one completed the planned 
concurrent radiation and chemotherapy treat ments.  With a median follow-up of 43 
months, 1 and 2 patients developed local and systemic failures, respectively. There was no neck recurrence. The locoregional control and relapse-free surviv al rates at 3 years 
were 92% and 79%, respectively.   For patients who receiv ed chemotherapy, the 3-year 
Version 2.0  
Date: 6.21.2011 -  
 7relapse-free survival rate was 91% compared  to 50% for those without chemotherapy (p 
= 0.09).  The 3-year overall survival rate was 74%.  For patients who received 
chemotherapy, the 3-year overall survival  rate was 91% compared to 40% for those 
without chemotherapy (p = 0.01).  This prel iminary experience suggests that combined 
use of chemotherapy with proton radiotherapy results in  improved disease-free and 
overall survivals in patients with T4 nasopharyngeal carcinoma (13).  
       
2.0  Objectives 
 
 2.1 Primary Objectives   
(1) To test the hypothesis that reduction of radiation dose to normal tissue can 
reduce acute toxicity and increase treatment compliance to combined 
 modality treatment.   
(2) To assess health related quality-of- life outcomes after pr oton radiotherapy 
for nasopharyngeal carcinoma using objective measurements and validated quality-of-life instruments.

be required to define gross target vol ume and clinical target volume.  The 
treatment planning CT scan  should be acquired w ith the patient in the 
same position and using the same immobilization device as for treatment.  All tissues to be irradiated must be  included in the CT scan. CT scan 
thickness should be [ADDRESS_186318] be within 21 da ys of start of radiation.   
6.1.3 MRI scans (with gadolinium unless contraindicated) are required in 
assisting the delineation of the trea tment volume on planning CT scans.  
6.1.[ADDRESS_186319].  GTV and CTV are defined in section 6.2.1. 
 
6.2 Volume and ICRU Reference Point Definitions  
 The definition of volumes will be in accordance with the 1993 ICRU Report #50: 
Prescribing, Recording, and Re porting Photon Beam Therapy. 
6.2.1 The Gross Tumor Volume (GTV )
 is defined as all known gross disease 
determined from CT, MRI, clini cal information, and/or endoscopic 
findings.  Grossly positive lymph nodes are defined as any lymph nodes greater than 1 cm or nodes  with a necrotic center. 
6.2.2 The Clinical Target Volume (CTV
) is defined as the GTV plus areas that 
are considered to contain potential mi croscopic disease.  Three different 
CTVs will be defined, namely CTV 60 for the tumor in the primary site and 
the high risk nodal regions and CTV 50-54 for the low risk nodal regions.  
Please note that there is no set margin between each GTV and its CTV. 
Version 2.0  
Date: 6.21.2011 -  
 116.2.3 The Planning Target Volume (PTV)  will provide a margin of 3 mm 
around each CTV (namely PTV 70, PTV 60, PTV 50-54) to compensate for the 
variabilities of treatment set up and internal organ motion.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_186320], optic nerves, chiasm, retina, eyes, temporal lobes, and frontal lobes should be outlined in all 
cases. Parotid glands, submandibular  glands, oral cavity, cochleas, 
temporomandibular joints, mandibles, pi[INVESTIGATOR_160587], hypothalamus, and 
lacrimal glands should also be outlined.  
  
6.4 Treatment Planning
 
 The treatment plan used for each patient  will be based on an analysis of the 
volumetric dose, including dose-volume histogram (DVH ) analyses of the PTV 
and critical normal structures.  
6.4.1  Dose Specifications  
[IP_ADDRESS] The gross primary tumor and lymph node metastasis of greater 
than 2 cm, PTV 70, will receive 70 CGE in 35 fractions at 2 CGE 
per fraction.  An additional of boos t of 6 CGE in 3 fractions to the 
primary gross tumor volume for patients with large primary tumors is at the discretion of the physician. 
[IP_ADDRESS] The lymph node metastasis of 1 - 2 cm, PTV
66, will receive 66 
 CGE in 33 fractions at 2 CGE per fraction. 
[IP_ADDRESS] The primary subclinical and the high risk nodal region (PTV 60) 
will receive 30 fractions of 2.0 CG E per fraction, total 60 CGE.  
[IP_ADDRESS] The low neck (including) supraclavicular field will be treated with 
conventional AP field or AP/PA fields at the discretion of the physician, and will receive  25 - 27 fractions of 2.0 CGE/fraction to a total  50 - 54 CGE unless th ere are gross nodes in which all 
the gross nodes should receive the same dose as the PTV
66-70.  
[IP_ADDRESS] PTV 70 and PTV 60 of the upper field will be treated with a 
combination of proton beam and photon radiation.  The low neck 
will be treated with photon only.   
Version 2.0  
Date: 6.21.2011 -  
 [IP_ADDRESS] The prescription dose is the isodose surface that encompasses at 
least 95% of the planning target volume (PTV).  No more than 
20% of any PTV 70 will receive >  110% of the pres cribed dose.  
No more than 1% of any PTV 70 and any PTV 60 will receive <  93% 
of the prescribed dose.  No more than 1% or 1 cc of the tissue outside the PTVs will receive >
 110% of the dose prescribed to 
the PTV 70.

although protein and RNA synthesis are also inhibited. Plasma levels of cisplatin decay in a bipha sic mode with an initial half-life 
of 25 to 49 minutes, and a secondary phase ranging from 58 to 73 hours. This prolonged phase is due to protein binding which 
exceeds 90% of the radioactivity in the second phase. Urinary excretion is incomplete with only 27 to 45% of the radioactivity excreted in the first five days. The initial fractions of radioactivity are largely unchanged drugs. Althou gh this drug seems to act as an 
alkylating agent, there are data to indicate that its m ode and sites of 
action are different from thos e of nitrogen mustard and the 
standard alkylating agents. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Formulation: Cisplatin is availa ble as a liquid (concentration 1 
mg/ml) in a 100 ml vial. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Preparation:  Aluminum reacts w ith cisplatin causing precipi[INVESTIGATOR_160589]; ther efore, needles or intravenous 
sets containing aluminum parts that  may come in contact [CONTACT_160602]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Storage:  Cisplatin should be kept at room temperature to avoid precipi[INVESTIGATOR_332].  The solution may be  further diluted in a chloride-
containing vehicle such as D5NS , NS, or D51/2NS (precipi[INVESTIGATOR_160590] D5W).  Cisplatin has b een shown to react with aluminum 
needles, producing a black pr ecipi[INVESTIGATOR_160591] 30 minutes. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Administration: Cisplatin shoul d be given imme diately after 
preparation as a slow intravenous infusion. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Effects: Incidence rates of  adverse events associated with 
cisplatin are provided in the produc t package insert. The following 
events are expected with the administration of cisplatin: 
Version 2.0  
Date: 6.21.2011 -  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Nephrotoxicity: Dose-related and cu mulative renal insufficiency is 
the major dose-limiting toxicity of  cisplatin. Renal toxicity has 
been noted in 28 - 36% of patient s treated with a single dose of 50 
mg/m2. It is first noted in the second week after a dose and is 
manifested as elevated BUN, creatinine, and serum uric acid, or as a decrease in creatinine clearance.  Because renal toxicity becomes 
more prolonged and severe with repeated courses of cisplatin, renal function must return to norm al before anothe r dose can be 
given. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Ototoxicity: Ototoxicity has been observed in up to 31% of 
patients treated with a single dose of cisplatin 50 mg/m
2. It is 
manifested by [CONTACT_30547]/or he aring loss in the high frequency 
range.  Deafness has been reported rarely. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hematologic Toxicity: Myelosuppression occurs in  25 - 30% of 
patients treated with cisplatin. Nadirs in circulating platelets and leukocytes occur between Days [ADDRESS_186325] patients recovering by [CONTACT_2006] 39 or sooner.  Thrombocytopenia, anemia, 
neutropenia, and fever are also  possible adverse events. The 
occurrence of acute leukemia has been reported rarely in patients 
treated with anthracy cline/alkylator comb ination chemotherapy. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Gastrointestinal Toxicity: Marked nausea and vomiting 
occur in almost all patients treat ed with cisplatin. Diarrhea and 
anorexia have also been reported. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Neurotoxicity: Neurotoxicity, usually characterized by 
[CONTACT_160603], has b een reported. Neuropathy usually 
occurs after prolonged therapy (4 to 7 months); however, 
symptoms have been reported afte r a single dose. Muscle cramps, 
loss of taste, seizures, aut onomic neuropathy, dorsal column 
myelopathy, and Lhermitte’s sign have also been reported. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Ocular Toxicity: Optic neuri tis, papi[INVESTIGATOR_044], and cerebral 
blindness have been reported infr equently in patients receiving 
standard recommended doses of cisplatin. Blurred vision and altered color perception have been reported after the use of 
regimens with higher doses of ci splatin or greater dose frequency 
than those recommended in the package insert.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Anaphylactic-like Reactions: Anaphylactic-like reactions 
have occasionally been reported in  patients previously exposed to

and hypotension. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatotoxicity: Transient elevations in liver enzymes, 
especially SGOT (AST) , and bilirubin, have been reported. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Other Toxicities: Other infreque nt toxicities th at have been 
reported include cardiac abnormalities, hiccups, elevated serum amylase, rash, alopecia, malaise, and asthenia. Rare cases of local 
soft tissue toxicity have occurred.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Supplier: Commercially available. 
 
6.5.2 Fluorouracil
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Mechanism of action : Synthesis of 5-fluo rouracil was first 
described by [CONTACT_160604] [ADDRESS_186326] 
primarily as an inhibitor of thymidylate synthetase. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatotoxicity: Transient elevations  in liver enzymes, especially 
SGOT (AST) , and bilirubin, have been reported. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Formulation: 5-FU is commercially available in a liquid (concentration 50 mg/ml) in a 100 ml vi al.  It is stable if protected 
from light.  If a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_160592], it is to be gently heated to no greater than 140°F in a water ba th. In aqueous solution it is 
colorless to faint yellow, and is pH  adjusted with sodium hydroxide 
to 8.6-9.0. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Preparation: An infusion pump s hould be used to control the 
infusion flow rate. The volume of diluent is dependent upon the 
particular type of pump used. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Storage: 5-FU should be stored at room temperature and protected 
from light. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Administration: continuous intravenous infusion. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Effects: Toxicities associated with the systemic administration of 5-FU include anorexia, nausea and vomiting, stomatitis, mucositis, phlebitis, diarrhea, myelosuppression, alopecia, rash, photosensitivity, maculopapular eruptions, hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], fingernail changes, neurologic symptoms,

and MgSO4 (2 gm/L).  An oral equivalent dose of KCl is an acceptable 
option. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Cisplatin in [ADDRESS_186327].  
Ensure there is adequate urine output prior to cisplatin infusion.  Mannitol 
of 12.5 gm may be given immediatel y before the administration of 
cisplatin or it can be given in cispla tin infusion.  Furosemide 10 mg may 
be given as an intravenous bolus befo re cisplatin infusion.  For adjuvant 
therapy after radiation, the cisplatin dose is 80 mg/m2. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients should receive at least [ADDRESS_186328] (i.e. granisetro n 750 mcg IV or 1 - 2 mg 
orally, or ondansetron 8 - 24 mg IV or orally). Additional antiemetics may include, but are not limited to, lorazepam, aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], metoclopramide and/or prochl orperazine.

6.5.6 Cisplatin Dose Adjustments  
[IP_ADDRESS] Neutropenia 
Treatment can be delayed for up to 2 weeks until ANC is ≥ 1500/mm3. 
However, if the counts have not recove red in [ADDRESS_186330] remain < 500/mm3 for > 5 days 
before a dose reduction is made. If the results of the scheduled weekly 
complete blood count documents an ANC of < 500/mm3, repeat counts 
are to be obtained every other day until the ANC recovers to a level of > 500/mm3.  If chemotherapy must be withheld due to neutropenia, 
complete blood count should be obtained weekly until the counts reach the lower limits for treatment as outlined.

Chemotherapy must not be admi nistered until platelets are >  100,000.  If 
chemotherapy must be withheld due to  thrombocytopenia, platelet counts 
should be obtained weekly until th e counts reach the lower limits for

the study and then once every cycle and when the patient goes off chemotherapy. In case of symptoms or  signs experienced by [CONTACT_102], 
more frequent examinations should be performed and dose modification 
will be as follows: 
Grade 0 - 1: no change  Grade ≥ 2:  Decrease cisplatin dose by 50% .  Carboplatin at an AUC of 6 
may be substituted for cisplatin  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Otoxicity  
Cisplatin is known to cause high freque ncy hearing loss.  If grade 1 or 2 
hearing loss occurs, the risk of additional hearing loss versus the potential 
benefit of continuing cisplatin chemot herapy should be made.  If cisplatin 
is to be continued in the presence of  grade 1 or 2 hearing loss, the dose of 
cisplatin should be decreased by 50%.  Grade 3 and 4 hearing loss is an 
indication to discontinue the drug.  In case of grade 3 or 4 toxicity, 
carboplatin (at dosage of AUC 6) may be used to replace cisplatin in the remaining chemotherapy cycles. The dose of carboplatin AUC 6 will be calculated based on the Calvert formula (table 9). 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Nephrotoxicity 
 
If, despi[INVESTIGATOR_160593], serum creatinine increases to ≥ grade 1 (> 
1.[ADDRESS_186333]), creatinine clearance should be recalculated before the next 
cycle and subsequent dose reductions will be considered as follows:

 If creatinine clearance recovers, the dos e of cisplatin for the following cycle 
should be re-escalated to the previous dose level. 
 
6.5.7 Carboplatin Adminstrati on and Dose Adjustments  
Carboplatin may be substituted for cisplatin  if a patient develops 1) grade 3 or 
higher ototoxicity, 2) grad e 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy, or 3) an 
unacceptable cisplatin-associated nausea and vomiting after receiving 1 or 2 doses 
of cisplatin.  In the ev ent of carboplatin-induced ≥ [ADDRESS_186334] pharmacy operating procedures. 
 Carboplatin will be infused over 1 to 2 hour s.  Carboplatin dosage (mg) will be 
calculated for a target AUC 6 using the Calvert formula (table 9).  Creatinine clearance (CrCl) will be calculated using the Cockroft-Gault equation (table 10).   
 For females, use 85% of the calculated Cr Cl value.  The actual body weight in 
kilograms will be utilized in the Cockroft -Gault formula (table 10).  However, if 
the calculated creatinine cl earance exceeds an upper limit for creatinine clearance, 
as specified below, then this ceiling value for creatinine clearance, rather than the 
calculated creatinine clearance, will be used  in the Calvert formula to calculate the 
dose of carboplatin.  The maximum creatinine for both male and female patients is 125ml/min. Alternatively, at the treating physician’s discretion, a measured 24-
hour creatinine clearance can be obtained.  In this case, the m easured creatinine 
clearance can be used to calculate the carboplatin do se in the Calvert formula 
(table 9).

In case of grade 3 mucositis lasting more than 96 hours or grade 4 mucositis, 5-fluorouracil dose will be reduced by 20% from 1000 to 800 mg/m2/day.  A mouth rinse should always be allowed.    In case of grade 3 mucositis lasti ng more than 120 hours as a second 
occurrence or grade 4 mucositis as a second occurrence, the dose of 5-
fluorouracil will be reduced to 800 mg/m2/day for 3 days. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Diarrhea 
 
In the case of severe diarrhea, octr eotide is recommended.  If the patient 
has a significant diarrhea occurrence again (> 3 loose stools/24 hr), the patient should be treated  prophylactically in the s ubsequent cycles with 2 
tablets of loperamide or diphenoxylate in addition to 1 or  2 tablets after 
each loose stool. The maximum daily dose of loperamide is 16mg and 
diphenoxylate is 20mg/day.  For grade 4 diarrhea, or grade 3 di arrhea lasting > 7 days despi[INVESTIGATOR_160594], 5-fluorouracil will be reduced by 10% per day 
from 1000 mg/m²/day to 900 mg/m ²/day for subsequent cycles. 
Appropriate symptomatic treatment with loperamide or diphenoxylate 
hydrochloride with atropi[INVESTIGATOR_160595]. 
 If despi[INVESTIGATOR_37104], grade 4 dia rrhea or grade 3 di arrhea lasting > 7

 258.1 Self-assessment of quality-of-life 
 
  The validated 35-item EORTC-QLQ-H&N questionnaire along with the EORTC 
QLQ-C30 which measures general quality of life will be used (Appendix IV and V).  These self-administrated questionnaires  will be given pre-radiation treatment, 
at approximately 1.5, 3, 6, 12, and [ADDRESS_186337] difficulty maintaining their weights will be referred to the nutritional service;  gastrostomy tube for feeding will be 
placed if indicated.  Patients with dental problems will be evaluated by [CONTACT_160605].  For patients with difficulties with body image and social interactions, they will be offered to meet with a social worker to discuss their problems.  Psychiatric evaluation will be  referred if indicated. 
  
8.2 Objective assessment of swallowing function  
 
Improved locoregional control of adva nced head and neck cancer has been 
reported using concurrent radiothe rapy and chemotherapy.  Concurrent 
chemoradiation can result in increased acute and long-term dysphagia compared 
with radiation alone.  Late dyshpagia and fibrosis are major factors limiting the intensity of therapeutic regimens for head and neck cancer.   
Videofluoroscopic swallowing study (V FSS) (Appendix X) will be used to 
evaluate swallowing function.  VFSS is a validated method of objective 
assessment of swallowing, allowing viewi ng and recording of the structures and 
dynamics of the swallowing process.  Each subject will be asked to swallow 
multiple trials of various food consistencies in varying amounts. The consistencies 
included thin liquid barium (diluted with water) followed with non-diluted 
barium, followed with a puree, soft food (f ruit mixed with barium), and a solid 
(shortbread cookie) coated with barium . The examinations are recorded, and 
analysis of the three phases of swallowing - oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal – is subsequently completed. Assessment will be focused on bolus manipulation and 
control and bolus passage, includi ng cohesion, motility, and timing.   
Evaluation of swallowing function will be performed pre-therapy and at approximately 3, 12, and 24 months after therapy.

approximately 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after the completion of radiation. 
 8.3.1 Unstimulated Whole Saliva:  Patients  should refrain from eating, drinking 
or dental hygiene for at least 60  minutes before collection. During 
collections, patients should be seated and instructed to minimize orofacial 
movements and not to attempt to influence salivary flow (such as by [CONTACT_160606]).  Just before the collection, the patient should be instructed to swallow.  He/she should then be instructed to allow saliva to 
accumulate in the floor of mouth fo r 60 seconds without swallowing. The 
accumulated saliva should be collected into a pre-weighted container. The 
patient should repeat this procedure four more times for a total collection time of five minutes. Subjects should be  instructed not to swallow during 
the entire collection procedure. 
8.3.2 Stimulated Whole Saliva: After the collection of unstimulated saliva, 
patients will have 2% citrate solu tion applied with cotton tipped 
applicators to the lateral tongue bila terally five times over a two minute 
period (0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 seconds).  The mouth should then be emptied of retained citrate solution.  Saliva should then be collected for five minutes, using the same met hod as for unstimulated saliva. 
  
8.4      Speech Assessment/Head and Neck Health Status Assessment Inventory 
(HNHSAI) 
Patient self-assessment of speech outcome is an important element in quality-of-life measurements after chemoradiation.  Speech assessment questionnaires are from the Head and neck health status assessment inventory (HNHSAI) (14).  Nine 
functional and five attitudinal speech items  will be used. The patients’ responses 
to the HNHSAI will be recorded so that th e lowest value of [ADDRESS_186339] valu e of 5 represents normal or optimal 
function.  “Not applicable” responses are c onsidered appropriate.  If the patient 
responded to the query about problems talking at work with th e “not applicable” 
response (i.e. “I’m not currently employe d”), the response will be treated as 
missing.  The speech assessment will be c onducted within 14 days of initiation of 
radiation treatment and at 1.5, 3, 6, 12, a nd 24 months after treatment completion. 
  
8.5  ChemoSensory Questionnaire (CSQ) 
Treatments for head and neck cancer commonly results in smell and taste 
dysfunction which then can lead to qual ity-of-life changes.  Smell and taste 
dysfunction can also have a major negativ e impact on patients’ nutrition status.  
Version 2.0  
Date: 6.21.2011 -  
 27The Chemosensory Questionnaire (CSQ) deve loped by [CONTACT_160607] (15) will be 
used.  Four questions each on smell and ta ste will be used.  A minimum score of [ADDRESS_186340] after conventional radiation therapy for na sopharyngeal carcinoma.  Radiotherapy 
involving the structures of the temporoma ndibular joint or muscles of mastication 
could result in trimus.  The degree of tris mus will be measured by [CONTACT_160608]-incisal distance in the vertical opening, right  lateral, and left 
lateral jaw movements.  The trismus asse ssment will be conducted within 14 days 
of initiation of radiation treatment and at 1.5, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after 
treatment completion.  
 
8.7 Patient Swallowing Diary 
Besides the objective assessment of swa llowing function by [CONTACT_160609], patient self-assessment of sw allowing function is also important.  
Subjective swallowing dysfunction has been shown to be common after conventional radiation therapy for nasopha ryngeal carcinoma (16).  In the patient 
swallowing diary, patients will be ask about  their swallowing function with solids 
and liquids before radiation begins, each  day during radiation treatment, and at 
1.5, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after treatment completion.

11.0 Modality Review 
  Local Recurrence
 
Local recurrence is defined as: eviden ce of tumor growth/regrowth in any 
direction beyond that present on the pr e-treatment imaging studies or the 
appearance of tumor in tissues previously sc ored as sites of sub-clinical disease.  
The imaging studies are to be comparable in  technical factors. S ite of failure will 
be related to treatment volumes PTV1, 2, and 3. 
 
Nodal Recurrence  
 Recurrence in regional draining lymph nodes 
 
 Compliance to therapy  
 Defined as the number of co urses of concurrent and adju vant chemothera py received, 
as well as the time required to complete the radiotherapy. 
 
Distant Recurrence  
Defined as appearance of tumor at sites beyond regional nodal and marginal sites. 
 
Progression-Free an d Overall Survival  
Measured from the date of registration to the date of progressive disease or death. 
 
  12.0 Biostatistical Considerations 
   The rationale of using protons in th e combined modality treatment of locally 
advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma is the potential to improve patient outcome if the treatment compliance were improved by [CONTACT_160610].  In  particular, better 
tolerance of systemic chemothe rapy is expected with the greater degree of normal tissue 
sparing by [CONTACT_160611].  Only 55% of the patients on the Intergroup Study completed 
all 3 concurrent and 3 adjuvant cycles of ch emotherapy (9), using the same regimen as in 
the present protocol.  A sample size of 25 patients will provide 80% power to determine an increase in the chemotherapy completion rate to at least 77% at a one-sided significance level of 6%.  The error rates correspond to a decision rule that requires a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_186343] common reason for discontinuing chemotherapy in the 
Intergroup study, with 37% of patients expe riencing grade 3 or 4 events on the 
chemoradiation arm.  If grade 3 or 4 mucositis were observed among no more than 5 of the 25 patients treated by [CONTACT_160612], 80% power will be av ailable to detect a 
decrease in the rate to 16%.  The decision rule is associated with a one-sided significance 
Version 2.0  
Date: 6.21.2011 -  
 31level of 6% under the null hypoth esis assuming no difference from the Intergroup data.  
In general, 25 patients will provide 90% confid ence interval widths that are no more than 
35% for estimating the rate of acute and late effects. As all other toxicities are expected to be less common than mucositis, interval widths will be much narrower in practice. 
   A secondary objective will investigate the rate and pattern of loco-regional 
recurrence.  In addition to progression-free survival, the rate of loco-regional failure first will be estimated by [CONTACT_160613].  The subgroup sample size will be  limited for each of the T1-T2 and T3-T4 
tumor categories, especially as the patient distribution cannot be projected definitively 
for the accrual of only 25 patients with a ra re cancer.  Thus the goal will be mainly to 
show the null hypothesis cannot be  rejected, that is, the lo cal control rate in tumor 
subgroups will not be lower than that obser ved using conventional radiotherapy in 
combined modality treatment.  The accrual go al of 25 patients is anticipated to be 
reached in about 3 years.  The referral pa ttern of tumor stage to proton treatment 
suggests the expected accrual distribution will  be approximately 6 patients with T1 - 
2 tumors and 18 patients with T3 - 4 tumo rs. Assuming the local- regional control rate 
was 70% for T1-T2 tumors at 3 years base d on conventional radiotherapy regimens, the 
probability is 7% for at least [ADDRESS_186344] experienced local-
regional failure within 3 years. If the local- regional control rate of T3 - 4 tumors using 
protons were the same as the historical 50% rate using conventional radiotherapy, the probability is 5% for [ADDRESS_186345] failed locally or in the regional 
lymph nodes.

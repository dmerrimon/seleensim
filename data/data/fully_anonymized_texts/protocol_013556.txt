to a new hearing aid and to maximize the benefits they receive from wearing one. 
In turn, by [CONTACT_839275], they experience easier and more successful 
communication patterns. They enhance their ability to engage in everyday 
conversati ons and will be able to become more socially involved with their family 
and friends. In this study we will try to determine the extent to which web -based 
clEAR auditory brain training, with concomitant support from a clEAR in -house 
audiologist, affects sat isfaction with new hearing aids and increases daily use 
time. Thirty adults over the age of [ADDRESS_1166279] time. After an adjustment period, half will complete clEAR’s auditory brain 
training program right away and the  other half will complete it after a delay 
period, and both will complete a control condition. To establish the level of 
feasibility and clinical utility we will measure hearing aid satisfaction, benefit 
ratings, and hearing aid use time.  
A2 Primary Hypothesi s 
Use of the  web-based clEAR auditory brain training system with concomitant 
support from a clEAR in -house audiologist improves  satisfaction  with new 
hearing aids and increases daily use time.  
A3 Purpose of the Study Protocol  
Determine the extent to which web -based clEAR auditory brain training with 
concomitant support from a clEAR in -house audiologist affects satisfaction   
with new hearing aids and increases daily use time.

[ADDRESS_1166280] during training. Barcroft et al. (2011; see also 
Tye-Murray  et al., 2017) showed that computerized, game -like auditory training is 
beneficial for older adults (mean age=66 years, SD=16) who have hearing loss 
by [CONTACT_14664] a [ADDRESS_1166281] of training regardless of the 
talker. In a second study, Adults with hearing loss completed the clEAR program 
and were placed in a group that trained on either multiple talkers or a single 
talker (Barcroft et al., 2016). A control group also completed 12 hours of training 
in American Sign Language. The experimental group’s training  included a [ADDRESS_1166282]. The assessment 
phase included the same 4 -Improvement on 4 -choice discrimination was

 6 observed in the experimental group as compared with the control group. Gains 
were (a) highest wh en the task and talker were the same between training and 
assessment; (b) second highest when the task was the same but the talker only 
partially so; and (c) third highest when task and talker were different. The findings 
support applications of transfer -appropriate processing to auditory training and 
favor tailoring programs toward the specific needs of the individuals being trained 
for tasks, talkers, and perhaps, for stimuli, in addition to other factors.   
 
Auditory brain training has been shown to reduc e perceptual effort. Sommers et 
al. (2015) assessed the extent to which engaging in gamified auditory training 
would reduce perceptual or listening effort. As the name [CONTACT_55474], perceptual effort 
pertains to the cognitive resources that must be allocated to  recognizing speech. 
Perceptual effort was assessed using an n -back memory task. Eighty -three 
participants heard lists of words presented without background noise and were 
asked to continually update their memory of the three most recently presented 
words.  Perceptual effort was gauged by [CONTACT_839276] -back 
position immediately before, immediately after, and 3 months after participants 
completed 12 sessions (approximately 8 hours) of the clEAR auditory brain 
training games. Immediate post -training measures of perceptual effort indicated 
that participants could remember approximately one additional word compared to 
pre-training. Moreover, some training gains were retained at the [ADDRESS_1166283]. A significant correlation was found between 
gains in intelligibility and gains in perceptual effort.   
 
Auditory brain training enhances recognition of familiar voices. Tye -Murray et al. 
(2016) conducted a study to determine whether auditory training with the speech 
of an adult’s spouse would lead to enhanced recognition of that person’s speech. 
Ten older participants (mean age=73 years, SD=6) completed 6 weeks (12 
hours) of training. Their sp ouses recorded the stimuli and each participant 
(partner with hearing loss) completed auditory training that presented the 
recordings. Training led participants to better discriminate their spouse’s speech, 
as indicated by [CONTACT_941] 4 -AFC. Subjectively, response s on a questionnaire indicated 
that training reduced participants’ communication difficulties. Couples had been 
married an average of 14 years showed that providing training with a formerly 
unfamiliar talker led to significant gains in participants’ abilit y to recognize the 
speech of the talker, and that gains were seen for the speech of untrained 
talkers, although not to the same extent.   
 
Patients want regular contact [CONTACT_839277]. In a study of 93 adults (mean 
age=66 years, SD=17), we asked the qu estion, what did you like best about the 
auditory training (Tye -Murray et al., 2012). One of the three top answers was 
“regular contact [CONTACT_839277]”. The other two were “the games were fun to 
play” and “training gave me empowerment over my hearing loss.” By [CONTACT_839278], participants also reported increased confidence to engage 
in everyday conversations.

C3 Rationale for the Selection of Outcome Measures  
1. Primary o utcome measures are questionnaires used in hearing clinics to assess 
hearing aid satisfaction.   
2. Hearing aids log use time.  This information will also be collected to determine 
the average daily use time for each participant.

E1 Overview  or De sign Summary  
 
All qualified participants will first be fitted with one hearing aid using manufacturer 
recommended settings. The settings will be verified using real -ear measurements 
and any initial adjustments to the hearing aid will be made at the time of  fitting. 
The participants will return again in [ADDRESS_1166285] (SPIN) and the 
NU-6.  
Half of the participants will be assigned to the Early Group and receive 8 hours of 
clEAR auditory brain training in 20 minute intervals spread over four weeks. The 
other half will be assigned to the Late  Group and receive the clEAR training after 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 8 a four week control period. The Early Group will do the control period after their 
training period.   
For the control period, participants will be given a choice of three audio books 
stored on Amazon Kindle (a mys tery, a biography, or a popular fiction) to ensure 
that the book will engage a participant’s interest and that they will be motivated to 
follow the training schedule. They will be provided with a formal schedule that 
parallels the training schedule for the  clEAR training, and will receive [ADDRESS_1166286] a tablet for reading, they will provided  with a loaner tablet which allow 
access to Kindle books. A final period will be four weeks after either type of 
intervention.   
At the end of each period participants will receive the speech perception battery 
(SPIN and NU -6) and the subjective assessment battery. The subjective 
assessment battery includes questionnaires and scales commonly used to 
assess hearing aid satisfaction and changes in listening challenges. The battery 
will include three subjective measures, The SADL (Satisfaction with Amplificatio n 
in Daily Life), the IOI -HA (The International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids, 
and the COSI (Client Oriented Scale of Improvement). Finally, at the end of the 
clEAR training period participants will complete a questionnaire designed to gain 
feedback a bout the games, participants will also complete a questionnaire about 
their clEAR experience, indicating what they did and did not like about the 
system.  
 
E2 Subject Selection and Withdrawal  
 
2.a Inclusion Criteria  
All participants have the same inclusion/exclu sion criteria but be assigned to one 
of two groups that differ only in the schedule, this will allow participants will act as 
their own control group.   
 
All participants will:   
1. Be over [ADDRESS_1166287] 20/[ADDRESS_1166288] language of the participant  
Participants mus t pass a dementia screener (MMSE)  
Must have the manual dexterity to manipulate and insert a hearing aid  
Must have an email address and access to the internet  
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 [ADDRESS_1166289] based on conditions not noted in the 
inclusion/exclusio n criteria.  
2.c Subject Recruitment Plans and Consent Process  
Lists of potential participants will be obtained from multiple sources including the 
Washington University’s Volunteers for Health program and from an extensive 
database maintained in the Tye -Murray  lab. Potential participants will hear about 
the study and complete a health and hearing screening questionnaire over the 
telephone. If they pass the telephone screening, they will be asked to come to 
the hearing lab for the hearing and vision assessment. The hearing screening will 
include pure -tone threshold testing and speech perception testing at comfortable 
levels.  
To be enrolled in the study potential participants will have bilateral mild to severe 
sensori -neural hearing loss, and have never used hear ing aids. They will also 
require the basic skills for wearing and maintaining a hearing aid including the 
manual dexterity to insert the aid and the anatomy required to wear the aid. They 
will also have corrected static visual acuity of 20/40 or better. Th ey will be 
required to pass a dementia screener (MMSE). If they qualify for the study and 
wish to continue they will be consented after completing the assessments. Those 
that do not qualify will be paid for their time and any collected data destroyed.   
2.d Randomization Method and Blinding  
Because participa nts act as their own control  per se, they will not be randomized and no 
blinding will occur.  
2.e Risks and Benefits  
There are no foreseeable risks to the participant beyond the basic risks associated with 
hearing  aid fitting.  These risks are rare but include possible skin irritation from the 
device or the occasional uncomfortably loud sound.  Hearing aids are equipped with 
safety mechanisms that are supposed to reduce the possibility that a very uncomfortable 
level is produced.  
The participant will participate in a study that provides amplification and auditory 
training. These devices and procedures are designed to be of benefit to 
individuals with hearing loss. The participants will also be providing feedback on 
their experiences. This feedback may improve the procedures and methods 
currently used in online auditory training practices, this may benefit society.  
2.f Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
Participants that have not completed the study but can no longer participa te will be 
aske d to return the hearing aid.  They will be reimbursed for their time at 10$/hour.  
2.g When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
If it is deemed that they can no longer fulfill the needs of the study because they are not 
training or coming to the in -clinic assessments participants will be notified by [CONTACT_839279].

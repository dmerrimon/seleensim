1.0 Objectives  
Purpose: To determine if LB plus bupi[INVESTIGATOR_554625].  
 
2.0 Background  
Significance of Research Question/Purpose:  Liposomal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (LB) has not 
been adequately studied in peripheral nerve blocks and has yet to be studied for use in interscalene blocks for Total Shoulder Arthroplasty (TSA) patients.  It has 
been studied in Rotator Cuff Repairs (RCR) surgery and showed superior 
analgesia compared to bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].   
Preliminary Data: It is our standard of care to use this medication in an 
interscalene block at the U of MN for patients undergoing TSA.  A retrospective study performed showed superior analgesia and less opi[INVESTIGATOR_554626].  
Existing Literature: Vandepi[INVESTIGATOR_554627] (both RCR and TSA).   
 
3.0 Study Endpoints/Events/Outcomes  
Primary Endpoint/Event/Outcome: To determine if LB plus bupi[INVESTIGATOR_554628] 72 hours compared to bupi[INVESTIGATOR_554629].  
Secondary Endpoint(s)/Event(s)/Outcome(s):  
• To determine if LB plus bupi[INVESTIGATOR_554630] 72 hours as compared to bupi[INVESTIGATOR_554631].  Assessed via total pain scores (Use of Vi sual 
Analog Scale)  
 
• To determine if LB plus bupi[INVESTIGATOR_554632] (Quality of Recovery) QOR at 72 hours and 14 days as compared to bupi[INVESTIGATOR_554631].  Assessed via QOR 15 patient survey.

4.0 Study Interventions/Investigational Agent(s)  
Description: LB is a long acting local anesthetic.  It is liposome encapsulate d 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_283130] a 72-hour period.  Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_14072] a medium acting local anesthetic which provides between [ADDRESS_728513]  of care for use in interscalene blocks here at the U of 
MN. Acetaminophen is a medication used to treat pain, gabapentin is a gabapentinoid which is used to treat postoperative pain, and Celebrex is a selective COX -2 inhibitor also used to treat pain.   
Drug/Device Handling:  The LB will be stored in a locked pyxis fridge in a box 
labeled Liposomal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].  The anesthesiologists in charge of regional anesthesia the day the procedure will be informed will write the order for dispensing the medication and the block per standard of care.  It will be retrieved by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_9814] I’s for use in the interscalene blocks.  
Biosafety:   Per standard of care  
Stem Cells: N/A  
 
5.0 Procedures Involved  
Study Design:  Level I randomized prospective outcomes study comparing t wo 
groups of patients. Patients will be assigned either to Liposomal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_554634].   
Study Procedures:  After consenting to the study (either in clinic or the PAC 
clinic) and completion of the preoperative process (per standard of care), a randomization scheme from a random number generator will be followed to ensure equal likelihood of group assignment. T he patient will be placed in the 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_554635] [ADDRESS_728514] ASA monitors applied.  Sedation will be provided with midazolam 0-2mg and propofol 0-50 mg. The interscalene groove will be identified with the ultrasound. Using sterile technique, a 21g Nerve block needle will then be inserted and advanced under ultrasound guidance until it is in the interscalene groove.  Once in the interscalene groove, 20 mL of local anesthetic will be injected, with 10mL deposited at the top of the brachial plexus and 10mL at the bottom.  In the study group, 5 mL of each 0.5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_283134].  
PROTOCOL TITLE: Prospective Randomized controlled trial comparing liposomal 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_554621]: 7 6/3/2020 
 Page 9 of 19  Revised : 9/28/[ADDRESS_728515] 20mL of 0.5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_283135]. Patients would be required to take a dose of acetaminophen 975 mg oral, gabapentin 300 mg oral, and Celebrex 400 mg oral prior to surgery (per standard of care). The patient will be monitored (vital signs, respi[INVESTIGATOR_554636]) in the preoperative area until he/she is brought into the operatin g room for their procedure.  A working block prior to surgery will be 
confirmed via sensory testing of the shoulder.   All patients will undergo a standard induction with propofol 1.5-3.0 mg/kg, lidocaine 60-100 mg, ondansetron 4 mg, dexamethasone 10 mg and ketamine 0.25 mg/kg.  An LMA or ETT will be placed and an opi[INVESTIGATOR_283136].  Standardized maintenance will be a propofol infusion without neuromuscular blockers.  25-50 mcg of IV Fentanyl will be utilized for increases in heart rate gr eater than 20% or increases in systolic blood pressure above 
baseline.   
 Once in the operating room the surgeon will use 10 mL of 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_283137], subcutaneous, and intraarticular injection.   When the operation is complete, the patient will be  brought to the post-operative 
care unit (PACU).  The patient will receive IV fentanyl for a pain score of greater than 5 on the visual analog scale.  If more than 200 mcg of fentanyl is given and pain still remains above a 5 then IV hydromorphone will be used.  A dose of 5-10 mg of oral oxycodone (or 2-4 mg of oral hydromorphone) will be given as soon as the patient is able to tolerate oral medication per standard protocol:  If their pain score is 4 -6 (on the Visual Analog Scale) then 5mg oral oxycodone (2 mg 
hydromorphone) can be administered, if their pain is between 7 to 10 then 10 mg of oxycodone (or 4 mg of hydromorphone) can be administered.   The patient will either be discharged to a  hotel or brought to the ward where each day a member of the research team will evaluate (if in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) or call (if discharged to hotel) the patient for signs of complications and ask the patient their maximum pain score, total opi[INVESTIGATOR_173671]-opi[INVESTIGATOR_554637], and length of stay.  If patients have met criteria for discharge to home including pain <4/10, independence of intravenous analgesia, and medical stability for discharge but are awaiting placement, the time of discharge for the purposes of the study will be the day they have met such criteria as op posed to the actual time of discharge as this 
can vary depending on patient placement.  
 Once the patient meets discharge criteria, they will be discharged home where each day they will fill out a pain diary.  Additionally, a member of the research team will call the patient for signs of complications and ask the patient their current pain sco re, total opi[INVESTIGATOR_283138]-opi[INVESTIGATOR_554638]: Prospective Randomized controlled trial comparing liposomal 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_554621]: 7 6/3/2020 
 Page 10 of 19  Revised : 9/28/2017  at 24, 48, and 72 hours postoperatively.  Additionally, they will perform a Quality of Recovery Score survey at 72 hours, and 14 days postoperatively.  
While in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_554639] a standardized multimodal pain medication regimen.  Acetaminophen 975 mg q6 hours, ibuprofen 600mg q6 hours and prn oxycodone 5-10 mg q4 hours or 2-4 mg hydromorphone oral every 4 hours. All patients will be discharged with 30 -40 pi[INVESTIGATOR_156930] 5 mg oxycodone or 30-40 pi[INVESTIGATOR_554640] 
2 mg with instructions to take 5 -10 mg oxycodone for severe pain every 4 hours as 
needed or 2-4 mg every 4 hours hydromorphone as needed for severe pain. Patients will be instructed to start with the lower dose, but can repeat the dose if needed up to 10mg oxycodone or 4mg hydromorphone every 4 hours if needed.  
Assessments:  Post-operatively patients will be evaluated at [ADDRESS_728516]-
operatively by a blinded research staff.  This person will not be aware of the patient’s mode of analgesia. The patients will be contact[CONTACT_554646] 24, 48, and 72 hours +/- [ADDRESS_728517]-injection if they would undergo an interscal ene block with their medication again or if they would choose a different 
form of pain management (ex: higher doses of pain medications). Patients will fill out a Quality of Recovery Survey at 72 hours and 14 days, and be assessed for block related complic ations at this time. As part of the research, patients also will 
undergo diagnostic ultrasound of their diaphragm on POD 1.  All complications will be recorded including:  
• Failure of the block  
• Wound infections 
• Subsequent procedures 
• Complications related to  placement of the interscalene block including 
nerve injury, prolonged sensory loss greater than three days, prolonged arm weakness greater than three days  
• Opi[INVESTIGATOR_283140]/or vomiting 
• Local anesthetic toxicity as evidenced by [CONTACT_554647].  Data collection will continue until POD #14.  At that t ime study participation will be terminated.  Should 
patients be re-admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_283141] (Up to POD 30) for pain, a notation will be made in study records.  An analysis of the total cost of analgesics will be tabulated at the concl usion of 
the study to determine the most cost effective treatment option as this will be

Local Number of Participants to be consented: [ADDRESS_728522] a drop out 
or loss to follow up of 20%. 
 
11.0 Local Recruitment Methods  
Recruitment Process:  Patients will be recruited from the group of adult surgical 
patients at the University of Minnesota undergoing TSA and receiving an interscalene block. Patients will be approached at the preoperative assessment clinic at the Clinic and Surgery Center if p ossible by a research staff member to 
determine their interest in participation.  If they decide to be a participant they will be consented and given a copy of their consent form for their records and a consent will be scanned and placed into EPIC. If they need additional time to consider enrollment, they will be asked if we can reach out to them by [CONTACT_554648].  If the patient is unable to be consented prior to day of surgery, the research staff will approach them in the preoperative surgical area.  These patients will have significant time to review the study with research staff as well as the physicians performing the procedure due to the fact they arrive several hours pr ior 
to their scheduled surgery.  All subjects will have enough time to ask questions about the study and the potential risks involved regardless of which venue they

bupi[INVESTIGATOR_554621]: 7 6/3/2020 
 Page 13 of 19  Revised : 9/28/[ADDRESS_728523] to avoid duplicate attempts to recruit them. 
Identification of Potential Participants: P atients will be identified by [CONTACT_554649]’s clinic, pre -assessment clinic, or 
preoperative area. Patients who have opted out of research will not be asked to participate in the study. Patients will be approached to consent for the study by a surgeon, anesthesiologist, or member of the research team. Patients who agree to participate in the study will sign both a study consent and HIPAA authorization allowing the use of specified information contained in medical records for research purposes.  
Recruitment Materials: N/A  
Payment: No payment will be provided to patients.   
 
12.0 Withdrawal of Participants  
Withdrawal Circumstances:.  Subjects who have consented prior to the day of 
surgery and for some reason choose not to participate will be withdrawn and a notation will be made in the study records and these people will be considered screen failures.  The surgeon may choose to withdraw the patient from the study prior to surgery for any medical reason or if they suffer a major life threatening  adverse event.   
Withdrawal Procedures:  If the patient is withdrawn from study prior to the 
procedure, they will be noted in study records as screen failures. If they undergo the procedure and they decide they no longer want to be a part of the study or withdrawn by [CONTACT_099], they will be withdrawn and no further data will be collected.  This will also be noted in the study documentation. 
Termination Procedures:  If the study is terminated for any reason, or there is 
more than 5 % maj or adverse events the data that is already collected will be 
stored in a secure location only accessible to research personnel on this study. No further data will be collected if the study is terminated.

14.0 Potential Benefits to Participants  
Potential Benefits: The potential benefits of participating in this study include 
reduced pain following shoulder surgery and shortened hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].   
15.0 Statistical Considerations  
Data Analysis Plan: We plan to collect our data using excel, which will be 
maintained in box.  When the study is completed and ready for statistical analysis the data will be shared with our staff statistician.  
Power Analysis:  Following the pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] 30 patients, it was determined that 
40 additional patients ( for a total of 70 patients, 35 per group) would need to be 
enrolled to reach 80% power.  
Statistical Analysis: This study will be analyzed by [CONTACT_140309].  The 
data will be deidentified and shared with him in box.  The statistician will be provided the protocol so they are able to analyze for primary and secondary objectives.  
Data Integrity:  All patients will be assigned a unique patient identifier. The data 
that will be sent to the statistician will be deidentified.   
 
16.0 Confidentiality  
Data Security:  All paper documents and consent forms will be stored in a locked 
cabinet in the anesthesia research office in B573 Mayo. All study data will be stored electronically in Box and only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_248631].

data stored in the University’s Box storage system. All the research assistants have experience collecting pain scores and other relevant study information. The 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_554644]. 
Data Safety Monitoring:  The Department of Anesthesiology has established a 
Data and Safety Monitoring Committee consisting of several staff anesthesiologists which include persons who are board certified as pain specialists. Data will be transmitted in box to persons on the board on a monthly basis for review.  If there are patterns of adverse events, the board will meet as needed and provide recommendations. 
All safety data will be collected on a case report form and transferred into an excel spread sheet that will be stored in box. Also, all phone call data will be collected on a case report form and transferred into excel in box.     
All data will be collected by [CONTACT_223408] a daily basis.  
Subjects are monitored at several intervals on day of surgery and daily up to 72 hours.  If the patient is discharged prior to 72 hours they will Who will review the data.  
The data will be reviewed on a regular basis (weekly) by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_27235].  If there are consistent complications noted a meeting will be convened by [CONTACT_140310].  
The statistical tests for analyzing the safety data to determine whether 
harm is occurring. 
The statistician uses R or SAS for analysis.  Most likely  a regression 
analysis will be performed to see which event is most likely th e 
contributor for the complications  Also a chi- square analysis can be 
performed.  All is very dependent on data variability.

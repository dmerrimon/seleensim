 1  INTRODUCTION  
This document is a protocol for a clinical research study sponsored by [CONTACT_138479]. The study will be conducted in 
compliance with stipulations of this protocol, the conditions of IRB approval, ISO -[ZIP_CODE] , and International Conference on 
Harmonizatio n Good Clinical Practice guidelines ICH E6 GCP . 
1.1 Background  and Rationale  
Statement of the Problem:  
Many critically ill patients in the ICU present with significant anemia due to blood loss and body compartment fluid shifts 
after major surgery, trauma, coagulopathic bleeding, pathologic bleeding, or chronic disease. Maintaining euvolemia and 
preventing anemia by [CONTACT_450581] (PRBC) transfusion management in these patients 
can be a daunting task. Studies in critical ly ill adult patients have shown that both anemia and blood transfusion can be 
associated with increased morbidity and mortality (1 -4).  Additionally, both hypo and hypervolemia may deleteriously affect 
organ function. (5 -8). Therefore, maintaining patient s within a target hemoglobin (Hb) range and rendering euvolemia could 
result in improved patient outcomes.    
Another challenge in the ICU is weaning ventilated patients so they can be eventually extubated or keepi[INVESTIGATOR_450574] h ave tenuous respi[INVESTIGATOR_82219]. The pulse oximeter and abg are currently used for these objectives . 
When desaturation is noted on a pulse oximeter it is often a late sign  and hence limits salvage maneuvers . One of the key lab 
values to allow weaning of the  ventilator and to know that a tenuous patient is adequately oxygenating is PaO2 from an ABG. 
Unfortunately getting an ABG is invasive. Also even if an arterial line is present the desire to do multiple checks is limite d by 
[CONTACT_187287] (respi[INVESTIGATOR_450575], nurse’s  availability to draw samples and time delay in obtaining results.)  
Background Information:  
Previous studies have shown that anemia in critically ill adult patients with nadir Hb less than 9 g/dl and baseline Hb  less 
than 10 g/dl is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, even though many healthy patients can tolerate Hb as low 
as 5 without evidence of inadequate oxygenation (1,2). ICU patients have been shown to safely tolerate Hb levels in the range  
of 7-9 g/dl with decreased mortality compared to patients who are transfused to keep Hb between 10 -12 g/dl.  Except in 
patients with cardiovascular disease, such as unstable angina or myocardial infarction, there is little evidence to support 
transfusion o f patients to Hb greater than 10 g/dl (3,9,10).   
Blood transfusion carries a significant risk and critically ill patients who receive transfusions have an increased mortality  
versus those who do not.  Additionally, there is a positive correlation between an increased ICU/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_450576] (1,4,9).   Blood transfusion also carries a risk of infection and immune mediated 
transfusion reactions.  This creates the potential for unnecessary harm to patients if a blood transfusion is administered 
without a clear medical indication. Currently, blood loss is measured through monitoring drainage catheter outputs and visual  
inspection of blood on dressings. The patient’s Hb can also be measured intermittently by [CONTACT_450582] s means such as arterial 
blood gas (ABG) analysis, or blood samples sent to the lab, which has to be done multiple times in a patient at risk and whic h 
also on its own leads occasionally to significant blood loss.  The FDA has recently approved a device fo r use in adults that 
provides continuous noninvasive measurement of Hb from pulse oximetry sensors (Masimo Rainbow Co -Oximetry, Masimo 
Corp, Irvine, CA). This measurement is referred to as pulse hemoglobin (SpHb). The device utilizes more than 7 wavelength s 
of light with processed algorithms to quantify Hb species. This technology is both sensitive (84.3%) and specific (84.6%) 
with a precision of 1.12 g/dl .  Currently there are no studies demonstrating the utility of SpHb as a guide for transfusion 
manageme nt or its validity in the critically ill ICU patient. We have evaluated this hemoglobin monitoring system extensively 
under a related IRB protocol in the operating room (IRB ID: 494171 -8: Prospective observational study characterizing 
noninvasive hemoglobi n (SpHb) measured with Pulse CO -Oximetry technology in a variety of surgical cases).

 It may be that continuous Hb assessment could allow more accurate titration of blood transfusion to maintain Hb levels in a 
target range. This may result in limiting the total number of units transfused to a patient, the amount of time a patient’s Hb 
level is above or below the target range, and the amount of blood draws for Hb lab checks.  
Information obtainable from the additional wavelengths has also been shown to corre late with paO2 values in the moderately 
hyperoxic region (11).   This information can be characterized as the Oxygen Reserve Index (ORI).  This index is presented 
on a unit -less scale between [ADDRESS_574340] arterial hemoglobin saturation monitoring.  (12) Preliminary studies have evaluated 
the relationship between ORI and paO2 in the general surgical population. (11) In addition, the ORI has be en demonstrated to 
provide a clinically useful advanced warning of impending arterial hemoglobin desaturation in pediatric patients. (13) The 
relationship between ORI and standard saturation monitoring is characterized by [CONTACT_450583] r eferenced 
whitepaper : 
 
Oxygen Reserve Index (ORI) is an index measured noninvasively and continuously to provide an earlier indication of 
impending hypoxia by [CONTACT_364626] -oximetry to the moderate hyperoxic (100 -200 mmHg) regions.   
The device  also has the capability to continuously measure the plethysmography variability index (PVI).  PVI is calculated 
automatically and represents the variation in amplitude of the pulse oximeter waveform with respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (22 -24).  PVI is 
analogous to stroke volume variation (SVV), which may be derived from arterial waveform, pulmonary artery catheter, 
esophageal Doppler, echocardiography or other device measured variations with respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] .  At LLUMC, SVV can be 
continuously measured using an approv ed pulse contour waveform analysis device (Vigileo/Flotrac System, Edwards Labs, 
Irvine, CA).  Of course use of this device requires an arterial catheter be placed.  Multiple studies have demonstrated that 
SVV is a valuable tool in predicting fluid responsi veness in mechanically ventilated patients. When SVV is elevated, patients 
are more likely to respond with increased stroke volume and cardiac output when fluid is administered. The threshold SVV of

 12% has been defined in several studies as the best cutof f value for predicting an increase in stroke volume index greater than 
5% (25 -32).   
SVV is not the only arterial waveform derived variable that can be used to predict fluid responsiveness. Pulse Pressure 
Variation (PPV), which is a pressure -based dynamic variable, has been shown to correlate well with SVV in terms of 
predicting fluid responsiveness (9). Recently, PVI has also been shown to predict fluid responsiveness and to correlate with 
SVV and PPV (9).   The advantage of PVI, however, is its ability to  predict fluid responsiveness by [CONTACT_105] -invasive means (22 -
24).  Improper intraoperative fluid administration has consequences for patients such as tissue hypoperfusion, increased 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577], and increased morbidity (18 -21).  Using PVI as an addi tional tool to guide fluid management may 
therefore have a positive impact on patient outcomes.   
It is logical that Hb determination should be more accurate when the patient has near -normal intravascular volume. As stated 
previously, an SVV value of 12% or  greater is associated with fluid responsiveness, identifying patients who have 
abnormally low intravascular volume.  These patients ma y need either blood products or other fluids, as guided typi[INVESTIGATOR_450577]. W hen the SVV is 5% or less, t he patient is considered to be normovolemic or possibly 
hypervolemic.  The range of SVV between 6 -11%, however, is less clearly defined with regards to fluid status. Recent 
attempts to delineate whether patients in this range would benefit from fluid admin istration have been successfully 
demonstrated in both animal and human studies.  The temporary addition of PEEP to the ventilation settings and monitoring 
the effect on SVV can be used to show “near -hypovolemia” in mechanically ventilated patients.  The ad dition of PEEP 
results in a decrease in venous return to the right heart and a subsequent decrease in left ventricular stroke volume, which 
may have significant physiologic effects in a borderline hypovolemic patient.  When SVV increases to greater than 12 % as a 
result of the addition of PEEP, the patient is likely hypovolemic and would benefit from a fluid bolus (Y -AA).  Again, as PVI 
is analogous to SVV and PPV, fluid therapy has the potential to be guided by [CONTACT_105] -invasive measurements and may respond 
similarly to SVV when PEEP is added to patients who are nearly hypovolemic.  
In addition, dynamic parameter measurements like the SVV, PVI etc, can be measured by [CONTACT_450584] 1 below.

These measurements are affected by [CONTACT_450585], although to varying degrees depending 
on the measurement site. Any measurement of volume status changes or vasomotor ton e changes is made difficult because of 
the challenges in isolating the exact cause of the signal waveform attribute changes.  For example the finger -tip pulse -
oximeter is affected the most by [CONTACT_450586] -oximeter is more effected by [CONTACT_450587]. This study hypothesizes to compare the fluid status measurements obtained 
from various sources and measurement sites.

 RAM sensors are FDA 510(k) approved  for noninvasive respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] r ate monitoring, but are being used in this study for 
investigating potential uses for the PVI parameter , which changes with respi[INVESTIGATOR_1520] .  The sensors will be placed according to 
their approved intended use, and present no additional risks to subjects.  
1.2 Study  Device s 
The Masimo Radical -7 is a noninvasive monitor that measures arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), pulse rate (PR), and 
perfusion index (PI), along with optional measurements of hemoglobin (SpHb), carboxyhemoglobin (SpCO®), total oxygen 
content ( SpOC), methemoglobin (SpMet), Pleth Variability Index (PVI®), Oxygen Reserve Index (ORI™), Acoustic 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_26452] (RRa®), and Pleth Respi[INVESTIGATOR_26452] (RRp). Masimo SET® technology is clinically proven to satisfy all 
sensitivity and specificity requiremen ts for pulse oximetry. Masimo rainbow® technology uses 7+ wavelengths of light to  
continuously and noninvasively measure carboxyhemoglobin (SpCO), methemoglobin (SpMet), and total hemoglobin 
(SpHb®), as well as providing a more reliable probe -off detection. Total oxygen content (SpOC) provides a calculated 
measurement of the amount of oxygen in arterial blood, which may provide useful information about oxygen both dissolved 
in plasma and combined with hemoglobin. Perfusion Index (PI) with trending capability indicates arterial pulse signal 
strength and may be used as a diagnostic tool during low perfusion. Pleth Variability Index (PVI) may show changes that 
reflect physiologic factors such as vascular tone, circulating blood volume, and intrathoraci c pressure excursions. [The utility 
of PVI is unknown at this time and requires further clinical studies. Technical factors that may affect PVI include probe 
malposition and patient motion.] Oxygen Reserve Index (ORI) is an index measured noninvasively and  continuously to

FastSat® tracks rapid changes in arterial O2. A detailed description of the Masimo Radical -7 can be found in the attached 
manual . 
Masim o Rainbow sensors: a finger probe that consists of a series of light emitting diodes (LEDs) and photodetectors. First, 
light is emitted through a capi[INVESTIGATOR_99996]; then, the sensors detect the transmitted light. The signals from the sensor are 
processed and u sed to quantify hemoglobin levels  noninvasively .     
Masimo RAM sensors: single -patient use sensor with an adhesive strip for the purpose of acoustic waveform data collection . 
Data acquisition system: consists of a hardware component connected to a l aptop with data collection software used to 
capture wavelength data . 
1.3 Risk/Benefits  
The major risks to the patient are related to the surgical procedure, prolonged intubation or initial reason for ICU admissio n  
(bleeding, infection, pain, etc). Participation in this protocol places the patient at minimal if any additional risk. Additional 
blood sampling with each ABG analysis or CBC represents only 0.1% of the estimated blood volume of a [ADDRESS_574341] (40 mL) 
represents approximately 3.4% of the estimated blood volume of a [ADDRESS_574342]’s fingers from the device including potential mild allergic react ion to sensor material and 
adhesives, temporary skin irritation or discomfort associated with exposure to the sensor.   
There are no direct benefits to the subject from participation in this protocol. Possible future benefits to society or other  
patients ma y occur if the system is shown to be accurate enough to be used in place of invasive determination of Hb or PaO2 
in critically ill adult patients.

2 STUDY DESIGN  
This is a sponsored, prospective, nonrandomized, sequential data collection study to be performed in anemic adult patients 
who are admitted into the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU/8100), Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit (CTICU/7100) or 
Neuro -Multidis ciplinary Critical Care Services (NMCCS 8100 or 9100). Noninvasive pulse oximetry -determined SpHb will 
be compared to ABG co -oximetry and research lab equipment -determined Hb values, Oxygen Reserve Index (ORI) will be 
correlated with paO2 via ABG, PVI  and acoustic waveform data  will be compared to the arterial waveform extracted SVV or 
PPV values. The study goal is to establish the correlation of Hb values determined by [CONTACT_450589], use ORI to correlate wit h paO2 in the moderate hyperoxic regions and correlation of PVI with 
SVV or PPV values .

  All Se rious Adverse Events will be also reported to the IRB per IRB reporting requirements.  These reports may 
include, but will not be limited to: date of onset; brief description of the events; their treatment; whether they 
resulted in death, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1916], severe or permanent disability or were life threatening; their relationship 
to the study device; and resolution.  
Deviations from the study protocol  
Deviations from the protocol must receive both Sponsor and the investigator’s IRB approval before  they are initiated. Any 
protocol deviations initiated without Sponsor and the investigator’s IRB approval that may affect the scientific soundness of 
the study, or affect the rights, safety, or welfare of study subjects, must be reported to the Sponsor an d to the investigator’s 
IRB as soon as a possible, but no later than 5 working days of the protocol deviation.  
Withdrawal of IRB approval  
An investigator shall report to the sponsor a withdrawal of approval by [CONTACT_093]’s  reviewing IRB as soon as a 
possible, but no later than [ADDRESS_574357] original completed and signed CRFs at the end of the study. A copy of the completed and signed CRFs will remain on 
site. 
8.3 Data Collection, Transfer and Storag e 
Device data will be captured through data capture software (PulseOx Automated Data Collection)  and stored on a laptop. 
Device data, including  arterial waveforms,  along wit h electronic copi[INVESTIGATOR_450580].  
Only authorized sponsor personnel will have access to transferred data. Once data has been transferred via FTP, they are 
moved from FTP server to a secure and backed drive. Device data and  CRF will be checked for completeness. If there are 
inconsistent or missing data points, a data query list will be generated and submitted to the site for correction.

 9 MONITORING PLAN  
9.1 As the sponsor of this clinical investigation, Masimo Corporation is required by 21  CFR, Part 812, of the Food and 
Drug Administration regulations to monitor and oversee the progress of the investigation.  The monitor(s) assigned 
by [CONTACT_108579] a direct employee from the Clinical Research department trained on  
departmental SOPs on conduct and monitoring of sponsored studies.  
9.[ADDRESS_574359] three scheduled monitoring visits to 
ensure overall regulatory compliance of the study:  
 An initiation visit, prior to any subject enrollment to confirm site readiness, and to document  training on the 
study protocol and procedures, and use of equipment.  
 At least one monitoring visit during enrollment , when about 10 -15% done and/or every year .  
 A final close out vi sit after the last patient had finished the study.  
9.[ADDRESS_574360] access to all source 
documents needed to verify the entries in the CRFs and other GCP -related documents (IRB ap provals, IRB 
correspondences, and ICFs) provided that subject confidentiality is maintained in agreement with HIPAA 
regulations.  
9.4 It will be the monitor's responsibility to inspect the CRFs at regular intervals throughout the study, to verify the 
adherence  to the CIP and the completeness, consistency and accuracy of the data being entered on them.  
9.5 During each visit, the monitor will also verify presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, and documentation of SAEs/SADEs and protocol deviations/violations, and check CRF against source 
documentation.  
9.6 After each visit, the monitor will provide a monitoring report to the investigator within 4 weeks of visit completion. 
The monitoring report will detail findings and open action it ems observed during the visit. It is the responsibility of 
the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_52695](s) to respond to the findings of the monitoring report, and complete 
any open action items as soon as possible but no later than 60 days of receivin g the monitoring report. Any open 
action items not completed within the time allowed may be sufficient grounds for study site suspension or 
termination; it will be up to the sponsor to determine whether any incomplete action items are sufficient grounds fo r 
suspension or termination. See Section 16 for details on suspension and termination.  
9.7 Depending on the quality of the data and/or changes to factors affecting patient safety, additional monitoring visits 
may be necessary according at the sponsor’s discre tion. 
[ADDRESS_574361] procedures for biological materials.  Data will be retained for up  
to 2 years following completion of the f inal analysis .  
10.2 Protocol Amendments  
Any changes made to the clinical investigational plan/study protocol will be documented by [CONTACT_108582]. Before 
submitting protocol amendment to the IRB, the protocol amendment must be agreed upon and signed by [CONTACT_450592] a pulse oximetry based hemoglobin measurement system. Comparison of plethysmographic  variability

 investigator and the sponsor. The protocol amendment will be submitted to the IRB for approval. At a minimum, a redline 
version and a clean version of the new protocol amendment will be kept on file by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_11305]. Protocol 
amen dments will need to be version controlled. Both PI [INVESTIGATOR_364623].  
10.3 Suspension or Termination of Study Site  
The sponsor can suspend or prematurely terminate the PI’s and study site’s participation in the study, particularly if sponsor 
finds serious non -compliance by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_108559], and if such non -compliance was not resolved in a timely manner. The sponsor 
will document the decision to suspend or terminate the investig ation in writing. A suspended study site cannot enroll new 
subjects.  
If the sponsor determine s that the study site’s compliance to be inadequate at any point during the study, and sponsor move s 
to suspend or terminate the study site, the sponsor will prov ide notification in writing to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_329819]. The study site is eligible for reinstatement upon correction of any findings and any open action items prior to th e 
suspension, and upon provision of  a written guarantee that t he same non -compliance will not reoccur in the future. Site can 
only resume patient enrollment upon receiving written notification of reinstatement from the sponsor.  
If for any GCP and r egulatory non -compliance reasons the study site is prematurely termin ated by [CONTACT_456], then the study 
site is not eligible for reinstatement under the same Clinical Investigational Plan/Study Protocol. The sponsor may resume the 
terminated clinical investigation with prior IRB approval if the device is non -significant ri sk. 
10.4 Termination of Clinical Investigation/Study due to UADE  
The clinical investigation may be terminated if sponsor determines that an unanticipated adverse device effect presents an 
unreasonable risk to the subjects. Termination shall occur not later than  [ADDRESS_574362] ICE

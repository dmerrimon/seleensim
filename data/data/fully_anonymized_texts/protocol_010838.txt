SYNOPSIS
Clinical Protocol CA209647
Protocol Title :A Phase 2, Open -label, Single -arm, Two-cohort Study of Nivolumab in Relapsed/Refractory Primary 
Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL) or Relapsed/Refractory Primary Testicular Lymphoma (PTL)
(CheckMate 647: CHECKpoint pathway and nivoluMAB clinical Trial Evaluation 647)
Investigational Product(s), Dose and Mode of Administration, Duration of Treatment with Investigational 
Product(s): Nivolumab (BMS -936558) monotherapy administered intravenously (IV) 240 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W )
for 8 cycles, followed by  480 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W ) for a total treatment duration of 2 years , or until progressive 
disease (PD), unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent .
Study Phase: 2
Research Hypothesis: Treatment with nivolumab will demonstrate clinically meaningful efficacy in subjects with 
relapsed/refra ctory PCNSL or PTL.
Objectives : 
Primary Objectives:
To assess the clinical benefit of nivolumab in subjects with relapsed/refractory PCNSL orrelapsed/refractory PTL as 
measured by [CONTACT_34426] ( ORR )by [CONTACT_327642] (BICR). 
Secondary Objectives:
To assess progression -free survival ( PFS) based on BICR assessment for PCNSL orPTL, respectively
To assess ORR and duration of response (DOR )based on investigator assessment for PCNSL orPTL, respectively
To assess overall survival (OS) for PCNSL orPTL, respectively
.
Study Design : This is a Phase 2 open -label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nivolumab in subjects with 
relapsed/refractory PCNSL or PTL (Figure 1) . Subjects should receive nivolumab at a dose of 240 mg as a 30 -minute 
infusion on Day  1 of each treatment cycle for 8 cycle. Beginning with Cycle 9, subjects should receive nivolumab at 
a dose of 480mg as a 30- minute infusion every 4 weeks (+/- 3days),for a total of 2 years of treatment , or until 
progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent .Subjects should begin study treatment within 3 
calendar days of tre atment assignment.

including the following:
Inclusion criteria:
a)Men and women, age 18 years old at the time of screening
b)Subjects with pathologically confirmed PCNSL orPTL who progressed after or did not respond to at 
least 1 line of systemic therapy (PCNSL priortherapy  may include :  high-dose methotrexate [ HD-MTX] , 
HD-MTX based regimen, high dose cytarabine, radiatio n therapy  alone as treatment or as part of 
consolidation therapy , high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplant as part of consolidation 
therapy , and/or intraocular MTX alone or as part of consolidation therapy ; PTL prior therapy  may 
include : chemoimmunotherapy such as CHOP -R or any other regimens, with/without prophylactic 
radiation to contralateral testis or orchiectomy or intrathecal che motherapy )
c)Radiologically m easurable disease within [ADDRESS_404159] dose
d)Karnofsky performance status of 70 or higher
Exclusion criteria:

f)Known history  of positive test for human immunodeficiency virus or known acquired immunodeficiency 
syndrome
g)Prior treatment with an anti -programmed death ligand (PD) -1, anti -PD-L1, anti -PD-L2, anti -CD137, or 
anti-CTLA -4 antibody, or any other antib ody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or

Study Assessments :The primary  endpoint is BICR-assessed ORR, and will be analy zed 6months after last patient 
first treatment ineach cohort. All treated subjects will be evaluated. The BICR -assessed objective response will be 
further characterized by  [CONTACT_327643]. DOR is defined as the time from first response ( partial response [PR ]or compl ete 
response [ CR]) to the date of initial objectively documented progression as determined using the International Primary 
CNS Ly mphoma Collaborative Group (IPCG )criteria for PCNSL and Lugano [ADDRESS_404160] 2safety follow -up visits. 
Revised Protocol No.: 04
Date: 29-Nov-[ADDRESS_404161]’s status are acceptable .
Statistical Considerations :
Sample Size:
The planned sample size for this study will be approximately 65 treated subjects, placed into 2cohorts of subjects: 
PCNSL (N= 45) , and PTL (N= 20) .
In addition, Table 2summarizes the 95% exact confidence interval ( CI)for the target ORRs ranging from 28.9% to 
60% with sample size of 20 and 45. At observed ORR 28.9% with 45 PCNSL subjects, the lower bound of the 95% 
CI excludes the historical response rates in of 14% in recurrent primary central nervous system lymphoma . At 
observed ORR ≥ 40% with 20 PTL subjects, the lower bound of the 95% CI excludes the response rate of 14%.
The sample size for the PCNSL cohort was empi[INVESTIGATOR_327615] -
riskprofile of n ivolumab in PCNSL through observation of less common safety events. In particular, administration 
of nivolumab to 45 subjects provides 90% probability of observing at least 1occurrence of any adverse event that 
would occur with 5% incidence i n the population from which the sample is drawn.
Table 2: Observed ORR with Exact 95 % CI
N ORR 95% Exact CI
20 30% [11.9% -54.3%]
35% [15.4% -59.2%]

40.0% [25.7% -55.7%]
51.1% [35.8% -66.3%]
60% [44.3% -74.3%]
Endpoints:
The primary  objective will be measu red by  [CONTACT_327644]-assessed ORR. It is defined as the number 
of subjects with a BOR of CR or PR, based on the IPCG criteria for PCNSL ,and Lugano Classification [ADDRESS_404162].
Investigator -assessed ORR and DOR are defined similarly as described for ORR and DOR per BICR assessment 
above, but will be assessed per investigator.
Analyses:
All analyses will be performed separately for each cohort. 
The analy sis of the primary endpoint in each cohort will occur at least 6months after last patient first treatment of 
each cohort.

analy sis per BICR, but based on investigator assessment.
DOR based on BICR assessment will be summarized for subjects who achieve PR or CR using the Kaplan -Meier 
product -limit method. Median values of DO R along with 2 -sided 95% CIs and range will also be calculated. The same 
analy sis will be performed for the duration of CR.
PFS based on BICR assessment and OS will be summarized by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier product -limit method. Median 
values along with two -sided 95% CIs based on the log -log transformation, will be calculated. The PFS rate at 6, 12 ,

3.1 Study Design and Duration
CA209 647is a Phase 2, open -label, single -arm, 2-cohort study to estimate the safet y and efficacy 
of nivolumab in subjects with relapsed/ refractory PCNSL orPTL. Nivolumab 240 mg will be 
given every  2 weeks for 8 cycles . Beginning with Cycle 9, nivolumab 480 mg will be given every 
4 weeks for a total therapy  durati on of 2years , or unt il progressive disease, unacceptable toxicit y, 
or withdrawal of consent . Nivo lumab will be administered as a 30-minute infusio n.A finite

Females treated with hormone replacement therapy  (HRT) are likely to have artificially  suppressed 
FSH levels and may requi re a washout period in order to obtain a physi ologic FSH level. The 
durati on of the washout period is a funct ion of the type o f HRT used. The duration o f the washout 
period below are suggested guidelines and the investigators shoul d use their judgeme nt in checking 
serum  FSH levels:
1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)
4 week minimum for transdermal products
8 week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long as 6 mo nths. If the serum FSH level 
is > 40 mIU/ml at any time during the washout period, the wom an can be considered 
postm enopausal.
3.3.[ADDRESS_404190] igators may obtain additional follow-up MRI scans as medically indicated. For 
other locally  performed imaging, it is the local imaging facilit y’s responsibili ty to determine, based 
on subject attributes (eg, allergy  history, diabetic history ,and renal status), the appropriate imaging 
modality,and contrast regimen for each subject. Imaging contraindications and contrast risks 
shoul d be considered in this assessment. Subjects with renal insufficiency should be assessed as to 
whether or not they should receive contrast, and if so, what type and dose of contrast is appropriate. 
Specific to MRI, subjects with severe renal insuffici ency (ie,estimated glomerular filtration rate
< 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) are at increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. MRI contrast should 
not be given to this subject popul ation, who shoul d be excluded from the study . In addit ion, 
subjects with surgically implanted devices (pacemaker, deep brain stimulator, metallic implants, 
etc.) incompat ible with MRI shoul d not undergo such imaging techniques. The local imaging 
facilit y and invest igator should determine the appropriate precautions or guideli nes that should be 
instituted for subjects with tattoos, body  pi[INVESTIGATOR_2982] ,or other body  art.
The ultimate decisio n to perform MRI in an individual subject in this study  rests with the site

inflammat ion (treatm ent effect) and not disease progressi on.61A similar pheno menon has been 
observed in various tumors when treated with immunotherapeutic agents, in which transient 
enlargement of lesions or appearance of new lesions is attributab le to the influx of immune cells. 
These potential  immune treatm ent effects complicate the evaluat ion of response and may lead to 
prem ature discont inuat ion of therapy. Furtherm ore, the time period to pseudoprogression or tumor 
flare with different immune therapi[INVESTIGATOR_327617]. See Appendix [ADDRESS_404211] igator, as long as they meet the fo llowing cri teria:
Invest igator -assessed clinical benefit
Tolerance of study  drug
Treatment beyond progressi on will not delay an imminent intervent ion to prevent serious 
complicat ions of disease progressi on (eg, CNS m etastases or fro m ma ss effect )
Subject provides written informed consent prior to receiving a dditional nivolumab treatment
All other elements of the main consent including descript ion of reasonably  foreseeable risks or 
discomforts, or other alternat ive treatment options will still apply .
A radiographic assessment/ scan shoul d be performed within 8weeks of initial 
investigator -assessed progression to determine whether there has been a decrease in the tumor size 
or continued PD. The assessment of clinical benefit should be balanced by [CONTACT_327655].
If the investigator considers that the nivolumab subject continue s to achieve clinical benefit by 
[CONTACT_43893], the subject shoul d remain on the trial and cont inue to receive monitoring 
according to the time and events schedule in Section 5.1.

4.5.7 Management Algorithms for Immuno -Oncology Agents
Immuno-oncol ogy (I-O) agents are associated with AEs that can differ in severit y and durati on 
than AEs caused by [CONTACT_53970] c classes. Nivo lumab is considered an I-Oagent in this 
protocol . Early recogni tion and management of AEs associ ated with I-O agents may mitigate 
severe toxicity. Man agement algorithms have been devel oped to assi st invest igators in assessing 
and managing the following groups of AEs:
Gastrointestinal
Renal
Pulmo nary
Hepati c
Endocrinopathy
Skin
Neurol ogical
The above algorithms are found in the nivolumab Investigator Brochure64and Appendix 5of this 
protocol .
4.5.[ADDRESS_404213] ions should be graded a ccording to National  Cancer 
Institute(NCI) CTCAE v4.03guidelines.
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modified based on local treatment 
standards and guidelines, as appropriate:
For Grade 1 symptom s(mild reacti on; infusio n interrupti on not indicated; intervent ion not 
indicated):
Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery  from symptom s. The following 
prophylact ic prem edicat ions are recommended for future infusio ns: diphenhydramine 50 mg 
(or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/pa racetam ol [ADDRESS_404214] 30 minutes before 
additional nivo lumab administrations.
For Grade 2 symptoms (moderate reaction required therapy or in fusion interruption but responded
promptly to symptomat ic treatm ent [eg, antihistamines, non-steroi dal anti-inflammatory drugs, 
narcoti cs, corticostero ids, bronchodilators, IV fluids] ; prophylact ic med ications indicated for

Stop the nivo lumab infusio n, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the subject with 
diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamo l 325 to 
1000 mg; remain at bedside and monitor subj ect until  resol ution of symptom s. Corti costeroi d 
and/or bronchodilator therapy  may also be administered as appropriate. If the infusio n is 
interrupted, then restart the infusio n at 50% of the original infusio n rate when symptoms 
resolve; if no further co mplications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% 
of the original infusio n rate. Monitor subject closely . If symptom s recur, then no further 
nivolumab will be administered at that visit.
For future infusio ns, the following prophylacti c prem edicat ions are recommended: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamo l [ADDRESS_404215] 30 minute s before nivolumab infusio ns. If necessary , 
corticosteroi ds (up to 25 m g ofhydrocorti sone or equivalent) may be used.
For Grade 3 or 4 symp toms (Grade 3: severe reacti on,prolonged [ie, not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_53892]/or brief interruption of  infusio n],recurrence of symptom s following 
initial improvement, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_327620] [eg, renal impairment,

Immediatel y discont inue infusio n of nivolumab. Begin an IV infusio n of normal saline and 
treat the subject as follows: Reco mmend bronchodilators, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 0.2 to 1 mg of a 
1:1000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a  1:10,000 solution 
injected slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with 
methylpredniso lone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Subject shoul d be monitored until 
the invest igator is comfortable that the symptoms will not recur. Nivolumab will be 
perm anently discont inued. Invest igators should follow their institutional guidelines for the 
treatm ent of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery of the 
symptoms.
In case of late-occurring hypersensit ivity symptoms (eg, appearance of a localized or generalized 
pruri tus within 1 week after treatm ent), symptomat ic treatment may be given (eg, oral

Baseline Staging 
PCNSL
All PCNSL subjects will undergo gadolinium -enhanced MRI of the brain (and of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_327622] s)at the timepoints specified in Table 5.1-1and Table 5.1-2for 
baseline assessment and on study  response assessment purposes. Invest igators may obtain more 
frequent follow-up MRI scans as medically indicated. Local radiologic assessment of tumor 
measurements will be used for clinical management and investigator- assessed clinical endpo ints.
Subjects who are unable (due to existent medical condition, ie, pacemaker or implantable 
cardi overter -defibrillator device) or unwilling to have a brain MRI at baseline are excluded from 
the study (Section 3.3.4 ). Subj ects who becom e unable to undergo MRI imaging after enrollment  
may continue in the study for assessment of OSas long as there is no safet y issue which would 
requi re monitoring by  [CONTACT_9268]. 
Study  sites will  retain l ocal access to the imaging results for safet y and efficacy reading purposes. 
The study invest igator will review the local MRI result s as clinically appropriate to ensure that any 
potenti ally emergent clinical situations are addressed in a timely fashio n. Clinically  significant

nodes will be categorized as measurable or non -measurable.
Measurable Lesions 
Focal  uptake in nodal  and extranodal  sites that i s in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_327624], according to the 
distribut ion and/or CT characteristics, is considered involvement with lympho ma, including 
spleen, liver, bone, thy roid, and so on. 
Measured dominant lesions: Upto [ADDRESS_404242] dominant nodes, nodal masses, and 
extranodal lesio ns selected to be clearly measurable in 2 diameters. 
Nodes shoul d pref erably  be from disparate regi ons of  the body  and shoul d include, where 
applicable, mediast inal and retroperi tonealareas. A measurable node must have a longest  
diameter (LDi) >1.5 cm. 
Non-nodal  lesions include those in solid organs (eg, liver, spleen, kidneys, lungs), GI 
involvement, cutaneous lesions, or those noted on palpati on. A measurable extranodal 
lesion must have a LDi > 1.0 cmand may be included in the 6 representative, measured 
lesions ( eg, hepatic nodules).
A sum o f the product of the diameters (SPD) will be calculated for all target lesio ns(CNS and 
non-CNS) and recorded as the baseline SPD. The baseline SPD will be used as reference to 
further characterize any object ive tumor regression in the measurable dimensio n of the disease.
CT Measurements
For subjects staged with CT, up to [ADDRESS_404243] target nodes, nodal masses, or other 
lympho matous lesions that are measurable in 2 diam eters (LDi and shortest diameter) shoul d be 
ident ified from different body regions representative of the patient’s overall disease burden and 
include mediast inal and retroperi toneal  disease, if involved. A measurable node m ust have a LDi 
greater than 1.5 cm. Measurable extranodal disease (eg, hepatic nodules) may be included in the [ADDRESS_404244] b e greater than 
1.0 cm . All other lesio ns (including nodal, extrano dal, and assessable disease) should be fo llowed 
as non-measured disease (eg, cutaneous, GI, bone, spleen, liver, kidneys, pleural  or pericardial 
effusio ns, ascites) .

Non-Measurable Lesions
Besides small lymph nodes (longest diameter < 10 mm), truly non- measurable lesio ns include: 
leptom eningeal disease, ascites, pleural  or pericardial effusi on, inflammatory  breast disease, 
lymphangit ic involvement of skin or lung, or abdominal masses/abdo minal organom egaly 
ident ified by [CONTACT_327664].
Any disease not selected as measured, dominant disease andtruly  assessable disease shoul d be 
considered not measured. These sites include any nodes, nodal  masses, and extranodal  sites not 
selected as dominant or measurable or that do not meet the requirements for measurabilit y but are 
still considered abnormal, as well as truly assessable disease, which is any site of suspected disease 
that would be difficult to follow quant itatively with measurement, including pleural effusi ons, 
ascites, bone lesions, leptom eningeal  disease, abdominal masses, and other l esions that cannot be 
confirmed and followed b y imaging. In Waldeyer’s ring or in extranodal  sites (eg, GI tract, liver, 
bone marrow), FDG uptake may be greater than in the mediast inum with complete metabolic 
response, but should be no higher than surrounding norm al physiologic uptake (eg , with marrow 
activat ion as a result of chemotherapy  or myel oid growth factors).
All other lesions (or si tes of  disease) includin g non -measurable lymph nodes should be identified 
as non -target l esions and shoul d also be recorded at baseline. Measurem ents are not requi red and 
these lesions shoul d be fo llowed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progressio n’. 
In addit ion, it is possible to record mult iple non -target lesio ns invo lving the same organ as a single 
item on the CRF ( eg, ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or mult iple liver nodules’) .

routi ne PKand immunogenicit ysamples . Blood s amples shoul d be drawn from asite other than 
the infusio n site (ie, contral ateral  arm) on days of the infusio n. All samples collected predose 
shoul d be taken just prior to nivolumab administratio n, and end -of-infusion (EOI) samples should 
be taken as close to EOI as possible (pref erably 2 m inutes prior to EOI) on the contral ateral  arm 
(ie, the arm  not for the infusi on). All on-treatm ent PK time points are intended to align wi th days 
on which nivolumab is administered . If it is known that a dose is going to be delayed, then the 
predose sample shoul d be collected just prior to the delayed dose. However, if a predose sample 
is collected but the dose is subsequent ly delayed, an addit ional predose sample shoul d not be 
collected. Table 5.5-2lists the sampling schedule to be fo llowed for paired  blood samples. 
For those patients who are on-study  prior to Revised Protocol 04, sampling shoul d begin wit h the 
cycle thepatients are on, according to Table 5.5-2. Further details of blood collect ion,

significant problem in both PCNSL, where neurotoxicit y has been attributed to cognitive 
dysfunct ion, and in PTL, where patient age has reduced tolerance to aggressive chem otherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
The importance of capturing patient-reported outcom es data has beco me critically important as

The instrument’s 30 items are divided among 5 functional scales (physical, role, cogni tive, 
emotional, and social), 9symptom  scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomit ing, dyspnea, insomnia, 
appeti te loss, constipat ion, diarrhea, and financial difficult ies), and a global healt h/qualit y of life 
scale. With the except ion of 2items included in the global health/qualit y of life scale, for whic h 
responses range from 1 (Very  poor) to 7 (Excellent), item responses range from 1 (Not at all) to 4 
(Very  much). Reduced cognit ivefunction has been recognized as a significant problem in pat ients 
treated for PCNSL, and previ ous research has supported the validi ty of the cogni tive funct ioning 
scale of the QLQ -C30 in a variet yof populati ons. The EORTC QLQ -BN2069is a validated 
measure of concerns and symptom s specific to b rain neoplasms. The questi onnaire’s 20 i tems are

motor dysfunct ion (3 items), and communicat ion deficits (3  items),as well as single- item 
measures of problems wit h headaches, seizures, drowsiness, itchy  skin, hair l oss, l ower extremit y 
weakness, and bladder control . Each of the questio nnaire’s items uses a 4-point response scale 
ranging from 1 (Not at all) to 4 (Very  much). Raw scores for the QLQ -C30 and QLQ-BN20 are 
transformed to a 0-[ADDRESS_404251] ion5.1.
5.7.2 EQ-5D 3L
The EQ-5D-3L70is a generic multi-attribute heal th-state cl assificat ion system by [CONTACT_327667] 5 dimensi ons: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/disco mfort, and 
anxiet y/depressi on. Each dimensio n is evaluated using 3 levels: no problems, so me problems, and 
severe probl ems. Responses to these 5 dimensio ns are converted into 1 of 243 unique EQ-5D 
healt h state descriptions, which range between no problems on all 5 dimensio ns ([ZIP_CODE]) to 
severe/extreme probl ems on all 5 dimensio ns ([ZIP_CODE]). Using appropriate country -specific value 
weighting algorithms, a respondent’s self-described healt h state can be converted into a utility 
represent ing the so cietal desirabilit y of his/her own healt h. In addition, the EQ-5D includes a visua l

assessment or to fo llow up on suspected immunogenicit y related AE).
6 ADVERSE EVE NTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexist ing medical condi tion in aclinical invest igation subject administered study  drug and that 
does notnecessarily have a causal  relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unint ended sign (such asan abnorm allaboratory  finding ), symptom , or disease 
temporally  associ ated with the use of study  drug, whether or not considered related to the study 
drug.
The causal relat ionship to study drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess all 
AEs.The ca usal relati onship can be 1of the f ollowing:
Related: There is a reasonable causal  relationship between study  drug administration and 
the AE.
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal  relationship between study  drug 
administration and the AE.
The term "reasonable causal relat ionship" means there is evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship.
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended quest ioning, 
examinat ion, or evaluat ion of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
Immune-mediated adverse events (IMAEs) are AEs consis tent with an immune -mediated 
mechanism or immune -mediated component for which non-inflammatory  etiologies (eg,infect ion 
or tum or progressi on) have been ruled out. IMAEs can include events with an al ternate etiology 
which were exacerbated by [CONTACT_186756] y. Informat ion supporting the assessment 
will be co llected on the subject’s CRF .
BMS will be reporting AEs to regulatory  authoriti es and ethics committees according to local 
applicable laws including European Direct ive 2001/20/EC and FDA Code of Federal Regulat ions 
21 CFR Parts 312 and 320.

6.1 Serious Adverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose : 
Results in death
Is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at ri sk ofdeath at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothet ically might have caused death if it were 
more severe)
Requires inpat ient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_327628] (see 
NOTE below)
Results in persistent or significant di sabili ty/incapaci ty
Is a congenital ano maly/birth defect 
Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event[s] that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3092], based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardi ze the subject or may requi re intervent ion [eg, medical, 
surgi cal] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definit ion above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limi ted to, intensive treatm ent in an em ergency room  or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not result in 
hospi [INVESTIGATOR_28689].) Potential drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 6.6for the definit ion of potenti al DILI.)
Admissio n for administration of anticancer therapy  in the absence of any other SAEs (see 
NOTE below) 
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study  drug 
is an SAE .
Although pregnanc y,overdose , cancer ,and potenti al DILI are not always serious by [CONTACT_327668], these events must be handled as SAE s.(See Section 6.1.1 for reporti ng pregnancies .)
Any component of a study endpo int that is consider ed related to study therapy (eg, death is an 
endpo int, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be reported) shoul d be reported 
as SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details ).
NOTE : 
The fo llowing hospi [INVESTIGATOR_327629]: 
Avisit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours, that does not result 
in admissio n (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)
Elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
Admissi ons as pe r protocol  for a pl anned m edical/surgi cal procedure
Routine healt h assessment requiring admissio n for baseline/trending of health status 
(eg,routine co lonoscopy )
Medical/surgical admissio n other than to remedy  ill healt h and planned pri or to entry  into 
the study . Appropri ate docum entati on is requi red in these cases.

must be collected that occur during the screening period and within [ADDRESS_404254] be collected 
that rel ate to any  later protocol -specified procedure (eg, a fo llow-up bi opsy). 
The investigator mustreport any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed to 
be related to study  drug or pr otocol -specified procedure. 
An SAE report mustbe completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness. 
If the invest igator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related to the 
condi tions of the study  (such as withdrawal of previous therapy  or a complicat ion of a  study 
procedure), the relat ionship mustbe specified in the narrative section o f the SAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether related or not related to study  drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS 
(ordesignee) within [ADDRESS_404255] be recorded on the SAE Report 
Form; pregnancies on a Pregnancy Surveillance Form  (electroni c or paper forms). The preferred 
method for SAE data reporting collection is through the eCRF. The paper SAE/pregnancy 
surveillance forms are only intended as a back -up option when the eCRF system is not functioning.
In this case, the paper forms are to be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) 
transmissio n to:
SAE Email Address: Refer to Conta ctInformat ion list.
SAE Facsimile Number : Refer to Contact [CONTACT_327669].
For studi es capturing SAEs through electroni c data capture, el ectronic submissio n is the requi red 
method for reporting. In the event the electroni c system  is unavailable for transmissio n, paper 
forms must be used and submitted immediately. When paper forms are used, the original paper 
forms are to rem ain on site.
SAE Telephone Contact (required forSAE and pregnancy reporting) :Refer to Contact
[CONTACT_147656].
If only limite d informat ion is initially available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Foll ow-up

6.6 Potential Drug Induced Li ver Injury (DILI)
Wherever possible, timely confi rmation of initial liver-related laboratory  abnormalit ies shoul d 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meet ing 
the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 6.1.1 for reporti ng details).
Potenti al drug induced liver injury  is defined as: 
1.AT(ALT or AST) elevation > 3xULN
AND
2.Total  bilirubin > 2xULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase),
AND
3.No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevat ion and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limi ted to, vi ral hepatitis, pre-exist ing chronic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.

7 BLINDED INDEPENDENT CENTRAL REVIEW
A blinded independent central review will be conducted of the images and relevant clinical data in 
this study . The activi ties and processes regarding the independent read will be outlined in the 
CA209 -647 Im aging Review Charter.
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
8.1 Sample Size Determination
The planned sample size for this study  will be approximately  65 treated subjects, placed into 
2cohorts of subjects: PCNSL (N= 45) , and PTL (N= 20) .
In addition,Table 8.1-1summarizes the 95% exact confidence interval (CI)for the target ORRs 
ranging from 28.9% to 60% with sample size of 20 and 45. At observed ORR 28.9% with 
45PCNSL subjects, the lower bound of the 95% CI excludes thehistorical response rates in of 
14% in recurrent primary  central  nervous system  lymphom a41. At observed ORR ≥ 40% wi th 20 
PTL subjects, the lower bound of the 95% CI excludes the response rate of 14%. 
The sample size for the PCNSL cohort was empi[INVESTIGATOR_327630] -risk profile of nivo lumab in PCNSL through observation of less commo n 
safet y events. In parti cular, administrati on of  nivolumab to 45 subj ects provi des 90% probabili ty

10 GLOSSARY OF TERMS
Term Definition
Complete AbstinenceComplete Abstinence is defined as complete avoidance of heterosexual 
intercourse and is an acceptable form of contraception for all study drugs. 
This also means that abstinence is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
patient. This does not mean periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal, pr ofession of abstinence for entry into a clinical trial, 
post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal, which are not accep table 
methods of contraception. Women must co ntinue to have pregnancy tests.
Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception’s must be 
discussed in the event that the subject chooses to forego complete 
abstinence.

below:
HIGHLY EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION
Highly effect ive methods of contraception have a failure rate of < 1% when used consistent ly and 
correctly . WOCBP and female partners of male subjects, who are WOCBP, are expected to use 
one of the highly effective methods of contraception listed below. Male subj ects m ust inform their 
female partners who are WOCBP of the contraceptive requi rements of the protocol  and are 
expected to adhere to using contracepti on with their partner. Contraception methods are as follows:
1)Progestogen only  hormonal contracepti on assoc iated wi th inhibit ion of ovulation.
2)Horm onal methods of contracepti on including oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_122351] + progesterone, vaginal ring, injectables, implants and intrauterine devices (IUDs) 
such as Mirena 
3)Nonhorm onal IUDs, such as ParaGard
4)Bilateral tubal occlusio n
5)Vasectomised partner with documented azoospermia 90 days after procedure
Vasectomised partner is a highly effect ive birth control  method provi ded that partner 
is the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP trial participan t and that the vasectomised 
partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success.
6)Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS).
7)Com plete abstinence
Com plete abst inence is defined as the com plete avoi dance of heterosexual intercourse 
(refer to Glo ssary  of Terms)
Com plete abstinence is an acceptable form of contraception for all study  drugs and 
must be used throughout the duration of the study treatment (plus approximately  [ADDRESS_404286] igational drug plus 30 days).
It is not necessary t o use any  other m ethod of contraception when complete abstinence 
is elected.
Subjects who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy tests, as 
specified in Section 5.1.
Acceptable alternate methods of highly  effective contraception must be discussed in 
the event that the subject chooses to forego complete abstinence.
The reliabilit y of sexual abst inence needs to be evaluated in relat ion to the durati on of 
the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifest yle of the subject.
UNACCEPTABLE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION
1)Periodic abst inence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods)
2)Withdrawal (co itus interruptus)

Com plete Response (CR): 
Com plete di sappearance of all enhancing abnormalities on gadolinium -enhanced MRI.
No evidence of active ocular lympho ma as defined by [CONTACT_327675] c nerve infiltrates. Chronic changes of 
the retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_327635] a prior retinal or optic nerve infiltrate does not 
precl ude the definit ion of a  C R. Detailed ophth almo logic examinat ion with dilated fundus 
examinat ion, slit-lamp examinat ion and color photography  of the posteri or pole, and lumbar 
puncture for cytology  are requi red only if these studi es were initially positive or became 
positive during treatment and if clinically  indicated by  [CONTACT_327676] s or si gns.
Lumbar puncture for CSF cytology is necessary to confirm cyto logic response observed in the 
ventri cular CSF. 
At the time a CR is determined, the patient should have discont inued corticosteroids for at least 
2weeks. 
Residual lesio ns (other than lesio ns < 10 mm) if presum ed to be non-malignant shoul d be 
further invest igated (eg, by [CONTACT_327677]) before CR can be accepted. 
If there was evidence of PET abnorm ality suspi[INVESTIGATOR_327636] b e

All subjects who appear to achieve CR require the fo llowing:
Confirmation scan at 8 weeks
Repeat CSF cy tology, bone marrow biopsy  and aspi [INVESTIGATOR_337], and oph thalmo logic examinat ion 
if involved at baseline 
Unconfirmed CR (CRu): Any patient who fulfills all criteria for CR but continues to require 
corticosteroi d therapy  at any dose shoul d be considered an unconfirmed CR. Subjects with a 
persistent minor abnorm ality on follow-up ophthalmo logic examinat ion (persistent non- malignant 
cells in the vitreous, alteration of the retina/optic nerve that is not consistent with tumor infiltration) 
may be considered a CRu if this abnormalit y is unlikely  to represent ocul ar lympho ma.
Parti al response (PR) requires all o f the following:
A 50% decrease in the contrast -enhancing lesion seen on MRI as compared with baseline 
imaging.
Corti costeroi d dose i s irrelevant to the determinat ion of PR.
Ophthalmo logic examinat ion should show a decrease in the vitreous cell count or re tinal/opti c 
nerve cellular infiltrate but may continue to show persistent malignant or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_327637]. 
Color photos of the posteri or pol e of the eye should be obtained to docum ent improvement in 
retinal/optic nerve infiltrates.
CSF cytologic examinat ion may be negat ive or continue to show persistent malignant or 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_327638] a 50% decrease in the primary brain lesio n. 
No new sites of disease. In the setting of primary  leptom eningeal  lympho ma, PR is not 
recogni zed; all subjects shou ld be categori zed as CR, CRu, stable disease, or progressive 
disease.
Stabl e disease (SD) is defined as less than a PR but is not progressive disease (PD).
Progressive disease requi res the fo llowing:
A more than 25% increase in the contrast -enhancing lesion seen on MRI as compared with 
baseline or best response (comparison should be made to the smallest of mult iple lesio ns).
Progression of ocular disease as indicated by [CONTACT_327678].
Appearance of any new lesion or site of disease (ocul ar, leptomeningeal or systemic) during 
or at the end of therapy .
Relapsed disease (only applicable to subjects with a prior CR, CRu) requires the following:
Appearance of any new lesio n.

Response Evaluation for systemic lesions in PTL : 
CR (Complete Remission)
The designat ion of CR requires all of the fo llowing be m et:
1)Com plete di sappearance of all detectable clinical evidence o f disease .
a)PET-CT-based response: A score of 3 is considered to represent complete metabolic 
response .
b)CT based response: Target node/nodal masses must regress to 1.5 cm in LDi, with no 
extralymphat ic sites of disease
2)Organ invo lvement : Absence of organomegaly 
3)Bone marrow: No evidence of FDG- avid disease in marrow. If there was evidence of 
involvement of bone marrow with lympho ma at screening/baseline and a biopsy was 
perform ed (PTCL), a bone marrow biopsy  will be requi red to confirm CR.
4)The presence of residual symptom s in the absence of detectabl e disease by [CONTACT_327679].
PR (Partial Remission)
The designat ion of PR requires all o f the following:
1)PET-CT based response: Score of [ADDRESS_404290] Scan.

lesions
3)Splenic and hepat ic nodul es must regress by  50% in length beyo nd norm al.
4)Bone marrow : reduced uptake com pared wi th baseline. If there is evidence of nodal  response 
but persi stent f ocal changes in the m arrow consider further evaluat ion 
SD (Stable Disease)
SD is defined as the fo llowing:
1)PET-CT based response: no metabolic response, score of 4 or 5with no significant changes 
from baseline.
2) CT based response: < 50% decrease fro m baseline, absence of new lesio ns  
3)Bone m arrow: no change from baseline.
PD: Relapsed Disease (after CR)/Progressive Disease (after PR, SD)
1)PET-CT based response: Score of 4 or 5 with increase in int ensity from baseline or interim 
scan/ or any  new FDG avi d focus consistent wi th malignant lympho ma 
2)CT based response: New node, new or recurrent spleno megaly, progression of exist ing lesio ns

APPENDIX 6 TUMOR FLARE
Tumor Flare in CNS tumors :
Tumor flare (TF) : Immunomodulatory agents, such asimmune checkpoint inhibitors, may be
associated withclinical andimaging findings during treatment ,suggestive of progressive disease
(PD) despi[INVESTIGATOR_327639] (tumor flareorpseudo -progression) .1,2This
pheno menonhasbeen well described withcheckpoint blockade therapy insolidtumors,with an 
incidence of 10% in melanoma and 3% in lung cancer.3Furthermore, this has also been reported 
anecdotally inlympho mas.4Pseudoprogression appears as tumor progression or radiographic 
progression wit h target lesio n size increase. Often it may be associated with mixed responses, 
which include good response (i.e., shrinkage) but increased tumor size or even new lesio n 
appeara nce elsewhere. The pati ent m ay or m ay not present wi th deteri oration in clinical 
symptoms. Considering this finding as PDcouldlead to patientsbeing prematurely removed
from atreatment fromwhich theyactually stand to benefit. Therefore it is important to remain 
cognizant of this effect during treatment. 
Few important characteristics observed with TFare outlined below:
Tumor inflammat ion is the intended effect of ant i-tumor immune therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , so tumor 
flare is consistent with eventual benefit. As it is important not to abandon immunotherapy 
prem aturely , these observat ions have led to development of immune -related response 
criteria.1,4
TFmay be m ore cl inically evident , i.e. lead to early development of symptoms, in CNS 
tumors than in tumors of  other sites due to their intracranial location . 
TF is indist inguishable fro m disease progression (thus so metimes called 
‘pseudoprogression’), and thus presents a majo r clinical challenge .
It is ordinarily not possible to determine whether increased neurol ogic symptom s and/or 
radiographic findings represent tum or progression or transi ent TF. Observation, so metimes 
prolonged, isrequi red to m ake this determinat ion.
In some setti ngs, m oreover, adverse effects of other concomitant treatment (such as RT) 
may be equally as likely. 
Less frequent ly adverse effects of immunotherapy on normal brain t issues may be 
possible.
In other Central Nervous Sy stem trials o f nivolumab (al one or wi th ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]), clinical 
findings of TF have been highly variable, based on the location of the lesio n, including 
confusio n, aphasia, hemiplegia, seizure, etc. Because of this neuro logic heterogeneit y, we have 
used the overall diagnostic t erm “Tum or Flare” in order to capture it system atically in our 
adverse event database.

Treatment strategies during TF :
Corti costeroi ds (e.g. dexamethasone 4- 8 mg/day) are generally fairly effect ive in 
reversing neurologic dysfunct ion, perhaps more effect ive than might be seen with disease 
progression. They may  be tapered as quickly as tolerated (in contrast to systemic IMAEs 
such as pneumo nitis, for which very  slow tapering is advised). If acute or severe 
neuro logic deteri oration, dexamethasone bo lus of 10- 20 m g intravenously  or 
corticosteroi d equivalent, once ,can be considered, fo llowed by a smaller dose for 
maintenance such as 2 -4mg daily, to be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_327640] s 
improve.
If symptoms are moderate to severe, delay of immune treatment is appropriate. 
Generalized effects of increased pressure, including midline shift, hydrocephalus, 
obliteration o f sulci, etc. have also been noted, but are non -specific. 
Imaging changes are s ometimes m ore stri king than clinical AEs; if radiographic findings 
are not associated with clinical deterioration, immune treatment need not be delayed. 
Cerebral edema on imaging by [CONTACT_327680] a criteria for drug discont inuat ion.
Invest igations on potenti al radi ographic features which could assist in discriminat ing TF
from disease progression are in progress.
If surgically accessible, a diagnostic biopsy may  be feasible. 
As al ways, there is concern that a representative sample be obtained. 
A predo minance of necrosis, and inflammat ion is consistent with TF, and very  helpful  in 
allaying the concern generated by  [CONTACT_327681]. Unfortunately , of course, 
a biopsy may  confi rm tumor progressi on.
In such cases, we would encourage that the im mune treatment be resumed. 
Every  patient is different ;consultat ion with the Medi cal Monitor and review of the imaging is 
often useful .

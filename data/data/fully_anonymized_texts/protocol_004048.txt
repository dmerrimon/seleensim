 Background, Rationale, and Context  
Young adults have the highest prevalence of waterpi[INVESTIGATOR_342490] (WTS) of any age group in the U.S. Extensive evidence shows that they consistently misperceive WTS as less harmful and less addictive than 
cigarette smoking, and these misperceptions are positively associated with WTS. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_637046], WTS is associated with serious acute and chronic harms, even among infrequent users. In addition, WTS is prospectively associated with cigarette smoking initiation  putting young adults at greater risk 
for cancer . Considerable evidence shows that  cigarette warnings  effectively convey  health information to 
consumers, resulting in increased motivation to quit and quit attempts.  Waterpi[INVESTIGATOR_637047] , but the currently mandated text warning, 
focused solely on nicotine addiction, is likely to have limited impact. The goal of this project is to develo p 
warnings to promote greater understanding of harms and to reduce WTS behavior  among young adults . We 
will use a systematic, evidence- driven , rigorous  approach to develop waterpi[INVESTIGATOR_637048]: (1) on waterpi[INVESTIGATOR_637049]; and (2) in an ecologically valid 
waterpi[INVESTIGATOR_637050]é setting. In Aim 1, we developed text and pi[INVESTIGATOR_236097] (text plus image) waterpi[INVESTIGATOR_637051] a broad range of health harms.  We dev eloped 29 text warning 
statements across a variety of health harms (e.g., cardiovascular, cancer, addiction) . We  tested these 
warning statements and the mandated nicotine warning statement in a national survey to determine the five 
most effective text warnings (IRB00062703). We then paired the five most effective text warning statements 
and the mandated nicotine warning statement  with three investigator -selected images to determine the 
most promising image for each text warning statement. The resulting six text and six corresponding pi[INVESTIGATOR_637052].  
 
Objective(s)  
The primary objective of the survey is assess the effectiveness of package warning type (text -only, pi[INVESTIGATOR_236097] 
[text plus image], no warning control) on intentions to smoke waterpi[INVESTIGATOR_637053]. The 
secondary objective is to assess the impact of text and pi[INVESTIGATOR_637054], creating generalizable knowledge about text and pi[INVESTIGATOR_637055]. The tertiary objective is to identify the most effective individual

the warnings’ impact on behavior in a real -world setting.  
 
Study Roles  
 
Wake Forest  University  Health Sciences  
The Wake Forest team’s role in this study will be to develop the study stimuli and survey questionnaire, oversee survey administration, maintain the study data, conduct analyses, and disseminate findings.  
 
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and [LOCATION_011] University  
Collaborators at UNC and BU will assist in developi[INVESTIGATOR_637056], and will assist 
with interpretation and dissemination of data.  
 
NORC at the University of Chicago  
NORC will program the survey, recruit participants, administer the survey, compensate participants, and assist with data quality review.  
 Design  
We will contract with NORC at the Univ ersity of Chicago to recruit 1,230 young adults (aged 18- 29) from a 
combination of their AmeriSpeak panel (approximately N=1000) and a third- party opt -in panel (remainder). 
NORC will recruit participants, program the survey, administer the survey to eligible participants, and 
provide the Wake Forest team with a final dataset, where participants are weighted to create a nationally 
representative sample. Participants who complete the survey will receive a small incentive, as agreed up by 
[CONTACT_637075], generally worth a few dollars. Participant s will complete demographics and tobacco use 
measures and then will be randomized to one of three conditions . One- third (about 410 participants ) will be 
randomized to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_637057], 410 to the text -only warning intervention group, and 
410 to the no- warning control group. The two intervention groups will see six respective warnings on 
sample packaging, one at a time. The control group will see the sample packaging once, without a warning. Intervention group participants will respond to measures designed to assess their warning reactions 
(emotional and cognitive reactions, perceived message effectiveness), and appeal of each package. 
Control group participants  will complete items on package appeal. After viewing all warnings, participants 
will complete items on behavioral intentions, perceived risks  of waterpi[INVESTIGATOR_342473], and knowledge of risks. 
After completing the study, participants will be provided with a link  to the CDC fact sheet about  waterpi[INVESTIGATOR_637058] d the tobacco quit line number.  
 
Setting Participants will complete the survey on a computer, tablet, or phone at  a location of their choosing.  
 
Subject Selection Criteria 
We will conduct an online national probability -based survey with a sample of 1, 230 US young adults (18- 29 
years old) using the AmeriSpeak panel at NORC and a third- party non- probability sample, weighted with 
the AmeriSpeak sample to be nationally representative. 
 
NORC will send the screener to all panelists who are aged 18- [ADDRESS_851595] year but are susceptible to future use (using a 5- item measure) will be routed to the consent form 
WTW Aim 2 TVPS – Protocol   Version 4 ( 2/20/2024)

 for the full survey. If they agree to complete the survey, they will be randomized to one of the three 
conditions and will begin the full survey.  
 
Inclusion Criteria  
• Aged 18-29, inclusive  
• US resident  
• Satisfies one of the following categories:  
1. Has used waterpi[INVESTIGATOR_637059]  
2. Has not used waterpi[INVESTIGATOR_637060]  
• Under the age of 18 or above 29  
• Not a  resident  of the [LOCATION_002]  
• Has not used waterpi[INVESTIGATOR_637061]: 1,230  
 
Interventions and Interactions  
We will measure waterpi[INVESTIGATOR_637062] s (ever use and use in the past year)  and susceptibility to 
future use with a five -item scale . We anticipate that 30% of young adults aged 18- 29 will be current 
waterpi[INVESTIGATOR_482635] 42 % will be susceptible non- users , based on a waterpi[INVESTIGATOR_637063]. Given the young adult sampling frame available and estimated response rate from NORC, we 
anticipate recruiting 512 current waterpi[INVESTIGATOR_482635] 718 susceptible non- users.  AmeriSpeak participants 
will receive points, worth approximately $5, for complet ing the survey. Third- party participants will receive 
compensation as agreed upon with their panel.  
 
Participants will be randomized to one of three conditions: text -only warnings, pi[INVESTIGATOR_637064], no 
warning control.  Participants in the two intervention conditions  will be shown six  waterpi[INVESTIGATOR_637065] , each 
with a different warning corresponding to their condition, in random order , and will complete items on 
package appeal and warning perceptions. Participants in the control condition will be shown one waterpi[INVESTIGATOR_637066]. The waterpi[INVESTIGATOR_637067] a 
fictitious brand created by [CONTACT_8713] a separate study. All elements of the waterpi[INVESTIGATOR_637068].

6. If you smoke hookah, how much would you worry about becoming addicted?  
Response scale: (1) Not at all / (2) A little / (3) Somewhat /  (4) A lot  
 Motivation to quit.  We will use a [ADDRESS_851597] the differences in warnings format on WTS intentions, 
we will fit a linear regression model using PROC MIXED  in SAS to account for the sampling design features 
(e.g., sample weights , repeated measures ). We will then examine experimental condition as a fixed effect with 
and without adjustment for potential confounders (e.g. sex, race/ethnicity, age, SES, WTS, use of other 
tobacco products). All test s will be two -sided. For a sample of [ADDRESS_851598] 80% 
power to detect differences  between the text only and pi[INVESTIGATOR_637071]  0.24 or 
greater  (corresponding to an effect size 0.16)  in a design with [ADDRESS_851599] deviation is 1.5 , based on Lipkus & Mays (2018) . For 
comparisons between the text or pi[INVESTIGATOR_637072] (which does not have repeated measures), we will have 80% power to detect differences of 0.[ADDRESS_851600] four  coordinating warnings from each condition 
(same text in both), with the highest PME scores for use in Aim 3. We will assess the rank or der of warnings 
based on PME scores for the sample as a whole and for subgroups, based on sex, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and WTS behavior to determine whether the rankings remain consistent. Ultimately, we will select 
four text and four  pi[INVESTIGATOR_637064] (that match) and are consistently ranked high on PME across subgroups.

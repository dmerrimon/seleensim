1.  INTRODUCTION  
This manual gives detailed instructions on procedures for the Mifepristone for Labor Induction 
(MiLI) Trial. It is meant to serve as a reference guide for study staff, including investigators, 
coordinators, study nurses, and data managers.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_1094983] Maternal Fetal Medicine Division, Labor and Delivery, and 
the Clinical Translational and Research Unit site.  
 
1.1.1 Steering Committee (SC)  
 A Maternal -Fetal Medicine Clinical Review Unit (CRU) and the study team that brings together 
the multi-disciplinary will oversee implementation including: finalizing the clinical protocol, 
training and certification, monitoring recruitment, data coordination and quality control, and 
IRB-related issues. The SC will also make final decisions about data analysis and interpretation, secondary analyses, presentation at scientific meetings and publications.  
 
1.1.2 Responsibilities  
 
The responsibilities of these individuals are described briefly here:   PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -PIs are responsible for ensuring the proper conduct of the study clinic site including 
recruitment as specified in the protocol and accurate collection of the data.  
Other specific duties include:   
a.  Obtaining and maintaining IRB approval and training for study personnel  
b.  Obtaining sufficient study areas for study personnel to interview patients and perform study procedures, including storage of study medication and other study supplies.  
c.  Participate in study - related meetings or conference calls  
d.  Familiarity and training for REDCap based data entry system by [CONTACT_32414].  
e.  Screen potential participants for eligibility and consent them. It is important to ensure 
the patient’s primary obstetric provider agrees to follow the study treatment protocol 
during the intrapartum course.   f.  Randomize per protocol to intervention arms – both arms to receive medication  
g.  Follow participants during the intrapartum period, delivery and 24 hours postpartum: with a patient satisfaction survey to evaluate medication side effects and overall satisfaction associated with treatment 
h.  Trained research staff will conduct research data abstraction from patient  and neonatal  
medical records, and other direct participant contact [CONTACT_794084].  
i.  Investigators will participate in blinded review of outcomes in order to confirm the 
primary and other key outcomes.  j. The LPCH pharmacy will be responsible for randomizing the medication  
k.  All newborn outcomes will also be ascertained through birth hospi[INVESTIGATOR_794070].  
l.  Data collection forms for maternal outcomes, newborn outcomes, NICU outcomes, and 
postpartum patient satisfaction outcomes  will be completed by [CONTACT_3462]. These 
forms will be used to enter the clinical data into the study data base.  
 
The Study Coordinator will be responsible for the day-to -day operations of the study at the 
clinical center, including recruitment and data collection processes. This responsibility includes the following:  
a.  Establishing a method of training and monitoring to ensure primary obstetric providers 
are following the study treatment protocol during the intrapartum period . 
b.  Establishing a method to ensure that all potential participants receive medications and 
appropriate randomization  
c. Establishing a method that for screening participants  who are potentially eligible for 
the study e.g. review of scheduled term inductions at LPCH   
d.  Assures that study drug is available at all times by [CONTACT_794085].  
e. Meeting with Stanford Investigational Drug Pharmacist pharmacy if necessary, to 
understand center specific drug request procedures.  
f. Arranging for the ordering and storage of study supplies.  
g.  Collecting maternal and neonatal information necessary to complete all study forms.  h.  Will abstract information related to primary and other key outcomes, and assure that 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_32397] (if required by [CONTACT_14189]) is notified of any primary outcome events and 
adverse events.  i. Training additional staff as needed in data collection, forms completion and data entry.  
j. Coordinating data entry, including controlling access to the REDCap and study unit as 
applicable, and assuring that required back-up security and confidentiality procedures are maintained.  
k. Organizing and maintaining records, including the protocol, data forms, reports and correspondence  
 
 
1.2 Procedures for Participant Confidentiality  
 
 The REDCAP database will contain PHI linked to the patient’s clinical data. The MFM 
Research team members are the only people  who will be able to access this database. A 
study/screening number will be used to identify each participant. Site will maintain a log of participant names and medical record numbers.  
 
1.3 Training and Site Initiation  
 
A training session for study coordinators will be held before recruitment starts. The purpose of the training workshop is to review the study design, objectives, procedures, data collection forms 
and a demonstration of the REDCap data base. The coordinators, in turn, are responsible for 
training any additional staff assigned to this study. Clinical site initiation to enroll and randomize participants is dependent upon completion of a series of preliminary tasks. These include 
completion of appropriate regul atory approvals (IRBs).  
 
Site staff training, certification, and receipt of all study supplies including medications will need 
to be completed as well as the development of a site recruitment plan. Fulfillment of the 
following are requirements before start of study:  
 1. Review of the final version of the study protocol, data forms and manual, and study 
medications.  
2. IRB approval and consent forms on file at Stanford. Due to COVID, also consider e -consent 
process.  
3. Completion of training and data entry of forms.  
 1.4 IRB approval

2.  STUDY INFORMATION  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1094985] Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(LPCH), specifically, approximately 37% of all spontaneous vaginal deliveries follow labor induction. Several methods of cervical preparation have been implemented to expedite a 
successful labor induction and vaginal delivery.
1-5 However, due to a rising incidence of 
induction of labor (IOL), particularly induction with an unfavorable cervix (Bishop score <6) requirin g cervical preparation, the average time a patient occupi[INVESTIGATOR_014] a room on Labor and Delivery 
(L&D) has increased, negatively impacting bed availability and healthcare costs.
[ADDRESS_1094986] of care for term IOL in both inpatient and outpatient settings. This is a randomized 
control trial (RCT) of nulliparous patients ages 18 to 45 years who are at 37 – 42 weeks 
gestational age induced with a transcervical (Cook) balloon, comparing perinatal outcomes 
among patients randomized to receive misoprostol vers us mifepristone in the inpatient setting.  
 
2.2 Background  
Approximately 29% of US births follow induction of labor (IOL), more than doubling since 
1990.
18 In 2018, a national multicenter randomized trial, Labor Induction versus Expectant 
Management in Low -Risk Nulliparous Women (ARRIVE), supported that elective induction 
after 39 weeks decreases cesarean delivery (CD) and morbidity.19 Since the ARRIVE trial, the 
incidence of IOL has increased nationally and institutionally.6 At LPCH, approximately 37% of 
vaginal deliveries currently follow IOL, with an average of 20 hours from admission time to 
delivery, compared to an average of 12-18 hours among those in spontaneous labor.4,5 As the 
number of patients electing IOL increases, L&D beds are occupi[CONTACT_5365] a longer duration with a subsequent increase in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_794071] a decrease in bed availability.
6 IOL frequently begins 
with cervical preparation when the cervix is not dilated.1 At LPCH cervical preparation typi[INVESTIGATOR_794072] (misoprostol and dinoprostone), 12-hours of transcervical (Cook) 
balloon placement, or misoprostol and Cook balloon used concurrently. Several studies have 
compared the cervical preparation methods that achieve the safest, most efficacious, and fastest 
method that led to spontaneous vaginal delivery.1-[ADDRESS_1094987] trimester pregnancy loss due to its 
efficacy as a cervical preparation agent.7,8 Based on the clinical trials in the second trimester, 
mifepristone reduces the time to delivery 40- 50% while decreasing overall maternal 
morbidity.9,[ADDRESS_1094988] a favorable cervix (Bishop score >6) at [ADDRESS_1094989] of 
maternal levels. Maximum fetal plasma concentrations of mifepristone occur 4 hours after treatment with a subsequent decrease at 24 and 48 hours.
11,13 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_794073], there were no signs of peripheral cortisol deprivation in the neonates  
or differences in the above neonatal outcomes.13 
Based on previous studies and pharmacokinetics, we hypothesize that mifepristone 
prepares the cervix for IOL without causing increased uterine contractions or fetal heart rate abnormalities, compared to misoprostol.
11-19 This pi[INVESTIGATOR_794074] L&D and 
improve perinatal outcomes as the incidence of IOL increases.  
2.3 Risk/Benefit Assessment  
 Mifepristone 200mg, oral use  
 
2.3.[ADDRESS_1094990] that has been used off -label for second -
trimester induction of labor. It has been shown to reduce the time to delivery 40-50% while 
decreasing overall morbidity in second-trimester induction.9,[ADDRESS_1094991] common adverse reactions (>15%) are nausea, weakness, fever/chills, vomiting, headache, 
diarrhea, and dizziness.  
It is contraindicated to use this medication among patients  who have a confirmed/suspected 
ectopic pregnancy  (not applicable to term pregnancies) , chronic adrenal failure, concurrent long-
term corticosteroid therapy, history of allergy to mifepristone, misoprostol, or other 
prostaglandins, hemorrhagic disorders or concurrent anticoagulant therapy, inherited porphyria, or an intrauterine device (IUD) in place.   
When taken with misoprostol, risk of fetal malformations in ongoing pregnancy (if not 
terminated) is unknown. However, mifepristone will be administered to term pregnant participants and will be far outside of the window of organogenesis (fetal development), thus risk 
for teratogenicity is nullified by [CONTACT_794087].  
As with other pregnancies, cases of serious bacterial infection, including very rare cases of fatal septic shock, have been reported following the use of mifepristone. No causal relationship 
between mifepristone  and misoprostol use and an increased risk of infection or death has been 
established.  
Mifepristone is present in human milk. Limited data demonstrate undetectable to low levels of the drug in human milk.  
Animal studies:  
Mifepristone has been shown to induce labor in rats,
20 through opposition to progesterone‐
induced suppression of oxytocin receptors, and enhanced synthesis of prostaglandins. 
Mifepristone has also been shown to induce preterm birth in mice, associated with a rise in 
prostaglandins and cytokines.21 A randomized‐controlled trial in beef heifers found a mean time 
to delivery of 43 hours after mifepristone administration, compared to 182 hours in placebo treated controls .
22 In a primate model (the macaque), mifepristone administration induced 
prostaglandin F2 alpha production by [CONTACT_794088], but not prostaglandin E2 production by [CONTACT_794089].23 
The FDA Mifeprex (mifepristone) information describes teratology studies in mice, rats and 
rabbits at doses of 0.25 to 4.0 mg/kg (less than 1/100 to approximately 1/3 the human exposure based on body surface area) , stating that because  of the antiprogest erone  activity of mifepristone,  
fetal losses were much higher than in control animals. Skull deformities  were detected in rabbit 
studies at approximately 1/[ADDRESS_1094992] likely due to the 
mechanical effects of uterine contractions resulting from inhibition of progesterone action.  As 
stated above, mifepristone will be administered to term pregnant participants and will be far outside of the window of organogenesis (fetal development), thus risk for teratogenicity is 
nullified by [CONTACT_794090].  
 Safety measures for this study include the following:  
- Obtain VITALS  (blood pressure, mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697])  
throughout labor induction, every [ADDRESS_1094993] 4 hours of the induction process. (see table below for 
reference range in pregnancy ). In addition, oral temperature will be taken per standard 
protocol  
- Pregnant patients  in this study may receive up to a maximum dose of 200 mg 
mifepristone only; this is the max dose per course as outlined by [CONTACT_32420]. Each dose will be given as 200 mg orally, once at the induction initiation  
- Monitor patients for adverse symptoms of mifepristone  
- All patients  will undergo continuous electronic fetal heart rate monitoring and tocometry 
until the time of delivery

Vital signs which suggest hemodynamic instability or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_794075]  
- Oral Temperature <36 °C (96.8 °F) or >38°C  (100.4°F)    
- Heart rate > 110 beats per minute  or <50 beats per minute  
- MAP <65 mm Hg  
- Respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]  > 24 breaths per minute  or less than < [ADDRESS_1094994] of care, antibiotics are started, and an 
infectious workup is initiated. If the patient has a fever with abnormal vital signs per CMQCC guidelines (see below), assessment for infection is initiated per standard of care.  

 
2.3.3 Risk Benefit/Ratio  
 
As the incidence of labor induction increases, the average time a patient is occupying a room on 
Labor & Delivery increases, impacting bed availability and cost. There is an urgent need for new methods and models to decrease the labor induction times. Studies have determined maternal and neonatal safety when using mifepristone as a cervical preparation agent. Assessment of outcomes in this study will determine how treatment can improve maternal and neonatal outcomes.  
 

Any serious adverse event or unanticipated problem will be reported to the Stanford IRB. The 
study team  encompasses the responsibility to monitor all aspects of the study and monitor data 
and oversee participant safety.  
 
We satisfy all requirements for this to be IND exempt.   
 
Misoprostol [ADDRESS_1094995] of care for labor induction internationally.
1-5 
 
According to ACOG, misoprostol, a synthetic PGE 1 analogue, can be administered 
intravaginally, orally, or sublingually and is used for both cervical ripening and induction of 
labor. It currently is available in a 100-mcg (unscored) or a 200- mcg tablet, and can be broken to 
provide 25-mcg or 50- mcg dos es. There is extensive clinical experience with this agent and a 
large body of published reports supporting its safety and efficacy when used appropriately.1 
  2.3.5 Assessment of potential risks  
 
No studies indicate that intrapartum exposure to misoprostol (or other prostaglandin cervical 
ripening agents) has any long-term adverse health consequences to the fetus in the absence of 
fetal distress, nor is there a plausible biologic basis for such a concern. Although misoprostol 
currently is approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the prevention of 
peptic ulcers, the FDA in [ADDRESS_1094996] of the obstetrical use of misoprostol  is 
hyperstimulation of the uterus which may progress to uterine tetany. There is an increase in  
uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy, and/or salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936]-oophorectomy)  among 
patients with a known history of a previous uterine surgery.  
 
There may be an increased risk of uterine tachysystole, meconium passage, meconium staining 
of amniotic fluid, and Cesarean delivery due to uterine hyperstimulation with the use of higher 
doses of misoprostol. In this study, the standard dose of [ADDRESS_1094997] been reported as adverse events in subjects receiving misoprostol : 
Gastrointestinal: In subjects receiving misoprostol  [ADDRESS_1094998] frequent gastrointestinal adverse events were diarrhea and abdominal pain. The incidence 
of diarrhea at 800 mcg in controlled trials in patients on NSAIDs ranged from 14-40% and in all studies (over 5,000 patients) averaged 13%. Abdominal pain occurred in 13- 20% of patients in 
NSAID trials and about 7% in all studies, but there was no consistent difference from placebo.  
However, patients will not receive doses greater than 100 micrograms, minimizing the risk for gastrointestinal side effects.  
 
Due to potential risks of misoprostol, the same safety guidelines as stated in 2.3.2 will remain in this study group.  
 2.3.6 Risk Benefit/Ratio  
 
As stated above, the incidence of labor induction increases, the average time a patient is 
occupying a room on Labor & Delivery increases, impacting bed availability and cost. There is 
an urgent need for new methods and models to decrease the labor induction times. Studies  have 
determined maternal and neonatal safety when using misoprostol  as a cervical preparation agent. 
Misoprostol is among one of the most common medications used for labor induction at LPCH and internationally. The benefits of improving labor induction success and decreasing rates of cesarean birth outweigh the potential of uterine tachysystole with conti nuous external fetal 
monitoring. Our study population excludes patients with uterine scars, including cesarean birth, and this mitigates the risk of uterine rupture.  
 Any serious adverse event or unanticipated problem will be reported to the Stanford IRB. The 
study team  encompasses the responsibility to monitor all aspects of the study and monitor data 
and oversee participant safety.  
  
 3. OBJECTIVES

 4.  STUDY DESIGN  
 
4.[ADDRESS_1095000] neonate . 
 4.2 Justification for Dose  
The FDA has approved mifepristone in a regimen with misoprostol, for the medical termination 
of intrauterine pregnancy through 70 days gestation. Historically mifepristone 600 mg followed 
by a prostaglandin were used, however, preferred dosing of mifepristone 200 mg is the current FDA approved dose due to its equal efficacy and safety as compared to 600 mg (Poppema, 1999 and Raymond, 2013).
 
 Mifepristone [ADDRESS_1095001] dose among 
studies of inducing labor at term.
11,12 However, one study compared mifepristone 50 mg, 100 mg, 
200 mg, 400 mg, and 600 mg and found no difference in maternal or neonatal outcomes among 
dosing.13 
 
The recommended FDA approved adult oral dose of misoprostol for reducing the risk for NSAID-induced gastritis is 200 mcg four times daily, however, the dose varies for labor 
induction.  
 
According to ACOG, o ne quarter of an unscored 100-mcg tablet (ie, approximately 25 mcg) of 
misoprostol should be considered as the initial dose for cervical ripening and labor induction. 
However, this is based on a vaginal route. The standard of care at LPCH is 50 mcg orally, based 
on previous literature that suggests stepwise oral misoprostol (50 mg followed by 100 mg) appears to be as effective as vaginal misoprostol (25 mg) for cervical ripening with a low 
incidence of hyperstimulation, no increase in si de effects, a high rate of patient satisfaction, and 
is associated with a lower cesarean section rate.
5 
 
The frequency of administration should not be more than every 3– [ADDRESS_1095002] misoprostol dose. 
Misoprostol in higher doses (50 mcg every 6 hours) may be appropriate in some situations, 
although higher doses are associated with an increased risk of complications, including uterine 
tachysystole with FHR decelerations.  
 
4.3  End of Study Definition  
 The study will be complete once enrollment has been completed. The goal is 30 patients with 15 
in each arm.  
 4.4  Sample Size  
 
We plan to recruit 15 patients  per group (30 total)  based  on the “rule  of 12” that is recommended  
for pi[INVESTIGATOR_794076],24 and to 
accommodate  an estimated  25% intrapartum  cesarean  rate. Based  on 80% power,  a two-sided  
alpha  of 0.05,  and prior  data,  we estimate  that this sample  size would enable  us to detect  a 
difference of at least 25 uterine  contractions  between  the two study groups  (140-150  on average 
during labor  for patients  induced  with misoprostol  and Cook  balloon).  The analysis plan and 
sample size calculation were developed in consultation with Maternal -Fetal Medicine Senior 
Biostatistician, Stephanie Leonard, PhD (Co -I).

5.  STUDY POPULATION  
 
(see  Study Design Figure below)  
 
5.1. Screening and Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria   
General Screening guidelines   
I. We will recruit patients receiving prenatal care at San Mateo County Health Clinics, 
LPCH, and private practices who deliver at LPCH at LPCH OB clinic and Labor and 
Delivery  
a. Patients will be eligible for the study if they are scheduled  for or admitted  for 
induction of  labor at LPCH  
b. All other eligibility criteria must me bet to be included in the study  
c. Among those screened and meeting eligibility  at LPCH OB clinic, will require 
rescreen ing once admitted for labor induction to confirm the participant meets all 
study eligibility criteria  
d. Gestational age must be validated prior to enrollment using the latest ACOG 
criteria that compares LMP derived gestational age with ultrasound parameters. 
The ACOG criteria for gestational age determination based on ultrasound is as follows:

II. Patients admitted for schedule d labor induction or admitted from Labor and Delivery 
triage will be screened by [CONTACT_14716]  
a. Patients will need to  be scheduled  or admitted  for a term labor induction at LPCH  
b. Review of electronic medical record will  include pregnancy dating information 
using the initial ultrasound, and medical history information taken at the prenatal 
visits  or time of admission . Baseline information, including contact [CONTACT_3031], 
vitals, demographic s, pregnancy history information, and maternal and neonatal 
medical information will be reviewed to assess eligibility  for study participation.  
c. Patients will undergo a fetal non-stress test  at time of admission  as part of 
standard of care . The O B provider or PI’s will review  the non-stress test . 
Category [ADDRESS_1095004] number of patients screened, eligible, and 
approached in the REDCap database.  
 5.2  Inclusion Criteria  
 
Nulliparous patients age d 18 to 45 years, with singleton live pregnancies of gestational age 37 
weeks 0 days – [ADDRESS_1095005] 
membranes with no contraindication for vaginal delivery, misoprostol  or mifepristone, and a 
Bishop score <[ADDRESS_1095006]  <3 hours  prior to  the time of 
randomization , without  prior  cervical preparation . 
 For patients who meet the above inclusion criteria 1-10 and who those who decline 
randomization will be offered enrollment for chart review only.  
 
5.3  Exclusion Criteria  
 
If the basic screening criteria are met, the next step is to review the exclusion criteria. Those without exclusions should be approached for study participation.  
 Assess the following exclusions:  
1. Significant cardiac, renal, or hepatic maternal comorbidities, severe gestational hypertension or preeclampsia with severe features  
2. Pregnancies complicated by [CONTACT_794080]  
3. Patients with a uterine scar  
4. Pregnancies complicated by [CONTACT_761444] (e stimated fetal weight <10%)  
5. Pregnancies complicated by [CONTACT_794082]  
6. Fetuses with an estimated fetal weight >4500 gm by [CONTACT_794083]’s exam on 
admission

10. Any indication for scheduled CD 
11. Hypersensitivity to oxytocin  
12. Uterine contractions ≥  [ADDRESS_1095007] exclusion criteria may be approached for 
the informed consent process.  
 
5.4 Screening/Re -screening  
 Patients may be included in the study up to [ADDRESS_1095008] recent ACOG criteria (see table in Section 5.1) 
with ultrasound required prior to randomization. If no ultrasound examination has been 
performed previously, one will be performed before the patient is randomized. Only pregnant patients  with gestational age > 37 0/[ADDRESS_1095009] at each participating center. Any person 
who is potentially eligible will be told about the study and asked if they  are willing to participate. 
The point in the screening process at which a signed informed consent is required will be prior to 
randomization. The study personnel conducting the informed consent process should emphasize the following study criteria during the informed consent process:   
• Randomization to a treatment arm with mifepristone for a cervical  preparation agent , 
with 50% chance to be assigned to either arm:  
o One group will receive mifepristone  
o One group will receive misoprostol   
• Participants to sign medical release  
• American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommends cervical preparation for 
labor induction, including the use of a transcervical (Cook) balloon  
• Follow up to occur through a numerical rating  scale patient satisfaction survey on 
postpartum day one to e valuate medication side effects  and overall satisfaction  associated 
with treatment 
 
Patients who did not give informed consent for randomization but meet eligibility criteria 1 -10, 
or who are unable to receive a Cook balloon based on their initial exam  will be offered 
enrollment for  chart review only . Patients undergoing induction with a Cook balloon alone will 
be offered enrollment  for chart review . These patients will consent to chart review without 
participating in the study’s randomization, they will receive standard of care at LPCH.  
 Due to a large proportion of Spanish speaking patients at LPCH,  we will also have consents and 
short form consents available in Spanish, and  translators will be available for the consent 
process. A short form consent may also be used depending on the participant’s preferred language.  
 
All patients  who are considered for participation in the study (consent  for randomization, consent 
for chart review,  decline or ineligible) should have a data entry form and entered into the 
electronic data system even if not randomized. Patients  who do not meet criteria at the LPCH OB 
clinic  screenin g, may be re-screened at the labor induction.  
 5.7 Requesting Medical Release Forms   
In order to obtain medical records from participants, each participant should sign a “Release of 
Medical Information” form. A signed Release of Medical Information form should be obtained at the time of, and preferably before, randomization. Clinical Site staff will be able to answer any 
questions about the procedure at the very beginning of their participation in the study. Also, 
reluctance to supply medical records may serve as a potential “red flag” that a potential participant may be an adherence or ret ention risk.  
If a participant refuses to sign a Medical Release Form, probe for reasons for the refusal. Explain the importance of the records for the study and why they are needed. Some participants may be willing to sign a release that is specific to information need ed for a particular outcome. If the 
participant continues to refuse, note the refusal in the participant’s chart and continue to follow them according to the protocol if they consent to the study at labor induction admission.  
6. RANDOMIZATION  
 
Randomization will occur at the time of labor induction admission.  
Randomization may occur upon confirmation that all exclusion/inclusion criteria are satisfied , 
after verification of participant consent and HIPAA authorization, and a transcervical balloon is placed by [CONTACT_941] O B provider . Of particular importance, careful consideration will be given  to the 
patient’s history and fetal status  to determine final eligibility . Study staff will also verify 
participant contact [CONTACT_794091] a Release of Information.  
 
The MFM Research team will review the following before randomization:  
• Complete review of all exclusion and inclusion criteria  
• Informed consent obtained  
• Fetal status and cervical exam  to confirm eligibility  
• Verification by O B provider that transcervical balloon is in place  
 Pharmacy  randomization:  
 
• The LPCH pharmacy will randomize the study medication and dispense to the Labor and Delivery medication dispense system, Pyxis.  
• The L&D nurse caring for the participant will p rovide the medication and instructions  
 
The LPCH pharmacy will attain records of randomization.  
 Both groups,  will undergo continuous external fetal monitoring and tocometry throughout the 
entirety of labor induction per standard of care.  
 The categories of patients randomized:  
 
Patients consenting to the study will be randomized in 1:1 blocks to two treatment groups  
 
Group 1: Patients randomized to the mifepristone  group will receive  mifepristone 200 mg po 
treatment . 
Group 2: Patients randomized to the misoprostol  group will receive misoprostol [ADDRESS_1095010]

6.1 Informed Consent  
 
No study activities will be conducted until an IRB approval is obtained. Potential participants 
who may be eligible will be approached by [CONTACT_16133]. The research staff will only introduce the study with the patients after a member of the clinical care team acquires permission from the potential participant that they ca n be approached for a study. If interested, the research 
staff will discuss the study and obtain an informed consent from the participant.  
 Sufficient time will be given to participants to read the consent form, and to ask questions to ensure understanding.  
 
An IRB-approved study brochure may be given to potential participants to provide more 
information about the study and the procedures involved.  
 
6.2 Induction of Labor: Study Groups  
 
At LPCH cervical preparation typi[INVESTIGATOR_794077] (misoprostol and 
dinoprostone), 12-hours of transcervical (Cook) balloon placement, or misoprostol and Cook 
balloon used concurrently. For the purposes of our study,  all patients  will receive the standard of 
care for labor induction at LPCH , starting with mechanical induction of labor with the 
transcervical (Cook) balloon. The Cook balloon will remain in place for a maximum of 12 hours. 
After 12 hours of Cook balloon placement, the O B provider will deflate the Cook balloon and 
perform a cervi cal exam. If the balloon spontaneously expels prior to 12 hours, the time will be 
noted and a cervical exam performed.  The balloon will be removed at any point in the setting of 
spontaneous rupture of membranes (SROM) per standard of care , to minimize risk of 
intraamniotic infection.  After a balloon expulsion, balloon removal in the setting of SROM  or 
after [ADDRESS_1095011] of care practice, including using up-titration  of oxytocin, amniotomy when 
deemed safe and appropriate, and transitioning to cesarean or operative birth if deemed necessary 
by [CONTACT_13917].  Patients who receive misoprostol will be eligible to receive additional doses of 
misoprostol 50 – [ADDRESS_1095012] of care, oxytocin is indicated when a modified Bishop score of 8 or greater is 
observed or if spontaneous rupture of membranes occurs during the ripening process. Intravenous oxytocin will begin at 1 milliunits per minute about 12 hours after mifepristone  
dispense and will be titrated per LPCH protocol. Amniotomy will performed at the discretion of 
the provider.  
 Maternal pulse and blood pressure will be recorded during the ripening process to assess for the 
incidence of maternal blood pressure or maternal heart rate changes; mean arterial pressures and 
pulse measurements will  be recorded every [ADDRESS_1095013] of care work up will 
be initiated. (See section 2.3.2) Abnormal vital signs include Heart rate > 110 beats per minute or 
<50 beats per minute, systolic blood pressure (mm Hg) > 160 or < 45 or diastolic blood pressure 
> 110 or < 85 or  MAP <[ADDRESS_1095014] dose among 
studies of inducing labor at term.
11,12 However, one study compared mifepristone 50 mg, 100 mg, 
200 mg, 400 mg, and 600 mg and found no difference in maternal or neonatal outcomes among 
dosing.13 
 
According to ACOG, o ne quarter of an unscored misoprostol 100-mcg tablet (ie , approximately 
25 mcg) of misoprostol should be considered as the initial dose for cervical ripening and labor 
induction. However, this is based on a vaginal route. The standard of care at LPCH is 50 mcg 
orally, based on previous literature that suggests stepwise oral misoprostol (50 mg followed by 100 mg) appears to be as effective as vaginal misoprostol (25 mg) for cervical ripening with a 
low incidence of hyperstimulation, no increase in side effects, a high rate of patient satisfaction, and is associated with a lower cesarean section rate.
[ADDRESS_1095015] Randomization Patient Satisfaction Survey  
All patients will complete a numerical rating  scale patient satisfaction survey after balloon 
removal and on postpartum day one to evaluate medication side effects and overall satisfaction 
associated with treatment.   
 7.2 Management of patient’s intolerance to study intervention  
  
Most common adverse reactions (>15%) to mifepristone include nausea, weakness, fever/chills, 
vomiting, headache, diarrhea, and dizziness.   
If the patient experiences side effects, the standard of care medications will be used for the 
patients : .  
 
For nausea and vomiting the patient will be offered Zofran [ADDRESS_1095016] of care, antibiotics are started, and an 
infectious workup is initiated. If the patient has a fever with abnormal vital signs per CMQCC 
guidelines (see 2.3.2), assessment for infection is initiated per standard of care.  
 
 
7.[ADDRESS_1095017]’s investigational pharmacy will dispense either mifepristone or to LPCH pharmacy. 
LPCH pharmacy will dispense/administer study drug to research participant’s nurse  via the 
Pyxis . The nurse will dispense the medication to the participant.

9.  PROCEDURES FOR INACTIVE/ LOST/ REFUSED PARTICIPANTS AND MISSED 
VISITS  
 
9.[ADDRESS_1095019] of the study.  
 
The goals to avoid drop- out and accomplish drop-out recovery include the following:  
1. to ensure that participants are not pushed to the point that they refuse to participate further  
2. to continue to engage participants through some form of contact (e.g., phone, e -mail) and 
allow an opportunity to determine participants’ concerns and problem -solve for solutions to 
concerns and barriers to participation,  
3. to foster some form of continued participation  
 The general approach to drop-out recovery will involve contact [CONTACT_32443]:  
1. identify barriers to participation  2. problem -solve for solutions to overcome identified barriers  
3. apply motivational enhancement methods  
 In situations where a participant’s behavior suggests that they do not  wish to participate, the 
participant can be removed from the study.  
 9.2 Definition of Participant Status.  
 
 For purposes of the study, we define the following terms related to trial participation status:  
 
 • Active status – active if medication therapy is managed according to the study algorithm. The 
participant continues labor induction per study protocol, which is the standard of care at LPCH.  
 
• Inactive status – participant consents to chart review for study purposes, but does not consent 
to randomization.   
 
• Lost status – lost-to -follow -up if the participant does not arrive for planned labor induction and 
cannot be contact[CONTACT_794092] (e.g., home phone, cell phone, mail, email, fax, etc.), 
clinic staff does not know the participant’s whereabouts, a nd alternative contacts either do not 
know where the participant is or cannot be contact[CONTACT_32445].  
 
• Withdrawn/Refused status – participant is considered to be withdrawn if they have withdrawn 
consent to participate in the study and refuses further contact [CONTACT_794093]. 
 
10. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
Serious adverse events that meet any of the following criteria:  
• fatal or life -threatening  
• result in significant or persistent disability,  
• require or prolong hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  
• neonatal death,  
• are important medical events that investigators judge to represent significant hazards or harm to research participants.  
 
Specifically, any AE that meets any of these criteria (maternal death, ICU admission stroke, 
myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, fetal death or neonatal death) will be documented and reported as a SAE.  
In addition, any unexpected event/ unanticipated problems which the investigator identifies will be reported.  
10.[ADDRESS_1095020] IRB. A Data Safety Monitoring Plan  (DSMP ) will be established  to guide  all aspects of the study and oversee 
participant safety. DSM P participants include the research team. The DSM P will be implemented 
to monitor safety, to advise on study progress and performance, protocol modification, or 
whether there should be early termination.  
The outcome of reviews will be relayed to the IRB and protocol director.  
10.2 Reporting of Adverse Events  
In addition, the following maternal  or neonatal  events are examples of adverse events to be 
reported:   
• Maternal or perinatal allergic reaction  
• Angioedema, anaphylaxis or generalized skin rash  
• Transfer to Chronic Care facility (neonatal)  
• Maternal arrhythmia (especially QT prolongation) or congestive cardiac failure 
(EF<45%)  
• Neonatal arrhythmia (especially QT prolongation)  
• Any adverse event leading to discontinuation of study medication or suspected to be due to the medication  
• Maternal pulmonary thromboembolism  
• Maternal admission to ICU  
• Neonatal IVH Grade III or IV  
• Prolonged maternal or term neonatal hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]  
11.  QUALITY CONTROL  
Quality control and assurance are the responsibility of every member of the MiLI  trial.  
 
All clinic personnel are responsible for understanding the protocol procedures.  
 
Research Staff responsibilities:  
 
• Maintaining the integrity of the protocol and regulatory document binder.  
• Developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a data entry system that incorporates real -time data quality assurance 
features, such as range and logic checks   
• Monitoring site initiation requirements.  
• Monitoring the screening and randomization processes to ensure randomization of 
eligible participants and appropriate randomization allocation of participants.  
• Generating timely web -based reports describing clinic and study performance, including 
but not limited to: a) recruitment b) visit adherence and visit completeness c) study intervention) data entry e) data completeness f) outcomes documentation  
• Monitoring documentation of 100% of potential outcomes  
  
12.  STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
  
12.1 Statistical Considerations  
 Efficacy Endpoint(s): The primary outcomes include generation of preliminary data comparing 
obstetric and neonatal outcomes among patients randomized to misoprostol 50 mcg versus 
mifepristone 200 mg a) obstetric outcomes : number of uterine contractions – with and without 
fetal heart rate decelerations  in labor , uterine tachysystole (more than 5 contractions in 10 
minutes with and without fetal heart rate decelerations) or hypertonus (a single contraction 
lasting more than 2 minutes) during the time the foley is in place. We will also be assessing time 
to complete dilation and delivery, total time on L&D,  rate of cesarean delivery, number of 
patients able to achieve active labor, and severe maternal morbidity - composite of 21 indicators, 
such as hysterectomy, eclampsia, seps is, and blood products transfusion and b) neonatal 
outcomes: neonatal cord gases (arterial pH), neonatal Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes, and a 
composite of serious neonatal morbidity up to 7 days of life defined as need for respi[INVESTIGATOR_794069] 72 hours after birth, hypoxic -ischemic encephalopathy, seizure, i nfection, 
meconium aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1518], intracranial or subgaleal hemorrhage, hypotension requiring vasopressor support, admission to neonatal intensive care unit.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s): The secondary outcomes are to examine recruitment feasibility, 
willingness of participants to be randomized to guide recruitment periods for future studies, and 
to assess medication tolerability through participant experience surveys.  
 
12.2  Sample size determination  
 
We plan to recruit 15 patients  per group (30 total)  based  on the “rule  of 12” that is recommended  
for pi[INVESTIGATOR_794076],24 and to 
accommodate  an estimated  25% intrapartum  cesarean  rate. Based  on 80% power,  a two-sided  
alpha  of 0.05,  and prior  data,  we estimate  that this sample  size would enable  us to detect  a 
difference of at least 25 uterine  contractions  between  the two study groups  (140-150  on average 
during labor  for patients  induced  with misoprostol  and Cook  balloon).  
 There were approximately 800 inductions among nulliparous patients at LPCH in 2020. We 
anticipate excluding ~[ADDRESS_1095021] 50% of patients to be approached for enrollment based on our experience and approximately 50% of patients who are approached to agree to 
participate in research study. This will result in approximately [ADDRESS_1095022], PhD (Co -I).  
 12.[ADDRESS_1095023] and will use Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. Differences will be 
considered statistically significant using two -sided tests (P<0.05).  
 
13. POTENTIAL CONTINGENCY PLANS  
 
There may be slower than expected enrollment in the study, thus we plan to seek approval to 
advertise in all practices delivering at LPCH. We plan to recruit additional research staff support 
to assist in recruitment in the case of slower than expected enr ollment.

 PROTOCOL ADAPTATIONS RELATED TO COVID -19 PANDEMIC  
The intervention initially had been designed to span 12 months as described in the ‘ original protocol ’ (v 1.0, 
May 13, 2019). The original protocol was used for the first [ADDRESS_200547] of in- person research activities. In response  to the pandemic, several modifications were made to 
the protocol —including reducing the length of the intervention to 6 months— both to ensure the safety of study 
participants and research staff as well as to compensate for a temporary pause in enrollment due to pandemic -
related restrictions on recruitment activities (‘adapted protocol’). Differences between the two protocols are 
summarized in Appendix [ADDRESS_200548] struggled to deliver relevant, effective, and sustainable support for at -
risk adults with diabetes to improve key diabetes self- management  behaviors, become more activated participants in 
healthcare and reduce diabetes complications. One largely untapped resource for this support is patients’ family and friends. Three out of four adults with diabetes reach out to an unpaid family member or friend (a ‘Support Person’) for 
ongoing help with diabetes management.  
However, diabetes management interventions to date lack structured and effective approaches to directly engage patients’ family members in supporting successful diabetes management. The long -term goal of this research is to 
produce structured and evidenc e-based approaches that engage Support Persons  (SPs) in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_25577] -risk adults initiate 
and sustain effective diabetes management behaviors. The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a novel program —Family Support for Health Action (FAM -ACT) —to more traditional, individual patient -focused diabetes 
self- management education and support  (I-DSMES ). FAM -ACT uses three innovative approaches to enhance the 
impact of family support on diabetes management: 1) provide family members core behavioral strategies directed at specific roles in supporting diabetes medical and lifestyle management, 2) teach fa mily members how to deliver 
support in  ways that support  patient  autonomy, and 3) teach SPs  ways to boost patients’ activated participation in 
healt hcare. Community Health Workers (CHW s) will deliver FAM -ACT to patient- SP dyads at an urban federally 
qualified health center  using in -person meetings, phone/video call, or video conferencing via a HIPAA- compliant 
application, as appropriate . [ADDRESS_200549] or I- DSMES intervention  over 6 months.  The specific aims of this study are to 1) 
Determine the effect of FAM -ACT on patients’ diabetes health o utcomes compared to  I-DSMES , and 2) Determine the 
effect of FAM -ACT on patient health behaviors and perceived support compared to I- DSMES . The main diabetes health 
outcome is change from baseline to 6 months  in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) . Patient behavioral outcomes will include 
diabetes self- management behaviors and perceived social support and autonomy support from family.  
This project is significant because it builds on prior CHW and peer support models to help at -risk diabetes patients 
with few resources achieve and sustain core health behaviors that underlie successful management of multiple risk 
factors for diabetes comp lications. Ultimately, this study will have a positive impact by [CONTACT_133239] a novel, scalable, 
evidence- based protocol and tools that leverage family support to help patients improve and sustain diabetes self -
management behaviors.  
Our long -term goal is to produce structured and evidence -based approaches that engage SPs  in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_25577] -risk adults 
initiate and sustain effective diabetes management behaviors.

outcome is change in patient HbA1c from baseline to [ADDRESS_200551] of hypothesized moderators and mediators of improved self -management behavior (e.g.  self-efficacy).  
Aim 3. Examine the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic and associated social distancing guidelines on patients' ability to 
participate in the FAM -ACT program as well as on their ability to manage their diabetes.

OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN  
The study will be a single -site parallel arm randomized controlled superiority trial with dyads consisting of an adult 
with type 2 diabetes (‘patient’) and a selected family supporter (‘support person’). Dyads will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_200552] protocol that all participants will follow; dotted lines

FAM -ACT Study Protocol   v2.2.[ADDRESS_200553]  
Patients recruited by 'warm handoff' at the FQHC ( FQHC  clinical provider asks CHW  or RA  to meet with patient in -
person in clinic to describe the study) will receive study information in person at the FQHC  by [CONTACT_171241]. 
Patients recruited from the recruitment flyer hanging in the FQHC , handed out at community health- related events, 
and posted on the FQHC Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram sites will contact [CONTACT_171242].  
Patients identified by [CONTACT_171243] a study recruitment letter. They 
will have the opportunity to opt -out of the study by [CONTACT_171244]. If they do not opt out within [ADDRESS_200554] the informed consent and HIPAA authorization  (patients only)  process, as this is a minimal risk 
study. The staff will undergo extensive training with the PI, including online training in the process of conducting the 
informed consent process, in -person training and observation by [CONTACT_978]/Investigators, and role -play with 
PI/Investigators. The first two times any FQHC  RA conducts an informed consent this will be observed by [CONTACT_171245], who will continue observing informed consents conducted by [CONTACT_171246]. 
Informed consent documentation will be monitored and periodically audited by [CONTACT_171247], Principal 
Investigator, and the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_171211] (CCDC).  
SP screening and consent  
If a potential patient  is eligible and interested in participating, the RA (RA) will then mail a recruitment letter and study 
information sheet to the potential SP2, using the contact [CONTACT_171248].  
The SP will have the opportunity to opt -out of the study by [CONTACT_171244]. If they do not opt out 
within three days of mailing the letter, t he FQHC  RA or project coordinator will call the potential SP  to obtain verbal 
consent. The FQHC  RA or project coordinator will go over all points in the mailed materials about the FAM -ACT study, 
assess understanding, and encourage questions prior to requesting verbal consent. If the SP  requires additional time 
to think over participation, the time will be given and the FQHC  RA or project coordinator will call back or speak with 
them at a later time as to encourage sufficient time to decide to participate. Consented SPs will complete a baseline 
survey  either by [CONTACT_14379]- person at the FQHC  prior to the patient’s enrollment .  
Patient informed consent and enrollment  
Once the SP is deemed eligible and is consented, an in- person enrollment visit will be scheduled with the patient. 
After the patient  has read the consent form, they can request to take time to consider the information and schedule a 
2nd visit to complete enrollment if they choose. During the informed consent process the RA will ask the patient 
questions to make sure they understand what is involved with the study. The patient will be allowed to think about 
sections in the consent and take time to digest the  information. If they choose not to enroll at that time, they will be 
asked whether the team can contact [CONTACT_171249] a newly -qualifying HbA1c at a later date.  If the patient 
feels comfortable with what was presented to them in the consent and they are still interested in enrolling, the 
patient will be asked to sign the consent form, and a copy will be given to them for their  records. If the patient 
consents to participate, a baseline survey and physiologic measurements (blood pressure, weight, fingerstick HbA1c).

INTERVENTION ARMS  
PROGRAM A : INDIVIDUAL PATIENT -FOCUSED DSMES  (I-DSMES) 
The I-DSMES  intervention will focus on the FQHC  patient only. The SP  of patients assigned to this arm will not be 
invited to the sessions or care management contacts with the patient and CHW. They will be allowed to attend the 
diabetes self- management education sessions if they choose, however, the sessions will not be family -focused.  
FQHC  patients assigned to this arm will:  
1. Take part in a one -hour introductory session designed to provide an overview of diabetes complications, how 
to set goals, and prepare for/participate in primary care appointments. During this session, the patient’s diabetes complication risk profile will b e discussed . 
2. Be invited to 4 -6 group diabetes self -management education sessions to be held at the FQHC  or online using 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887]’s HIPAA -compliant Zoom environment. In -person sessions at the FQHC will last approximately 1.[ADDRESS_200558] approximately 45 minutes. American Diabetes Association -
approved 'Conversation Maps' will be used as a tool for patient education when feasible.  
3. Complete an additional survey assessment and lab measures (blood pressure, weight  and fingerstick blood 
HbA1c) with the study RA 6 -months after enrollment. The SP will only complete one additional survey 
assessment 6 months after enrollment
4. (Some patient s in both arms  may be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] 12- [ADDRESS_200559] -
enrollment to complete an additional assessment  if the study still is active  at the time that  assessment 
window opens .) 
4. Receive care management contacts with a CHW every 2 -4 weeks either in person or remotely (when 
necessary) . The CHW will talk with the patient for approximately [ADDRESS_200560] 2020 will be contact[CONTACT_171251], optional "FAM -ACT COVID" survey. The purpose of this survey is to determine how the events of the COVID -
[ADDRESS_200561] affected patient s' ability to participate in the intervention, and to care for their diabetes  
PROGRAM B : SP -FOCUSED  DSMES (FAM -ACT)  
The FAM -ACT intervention will include patients and their SP  together as much as possible. In this arm, the enrolled 
FQHC  Patient and their SP  (referred to as a dyad) will:  
1. Take part in a one -hour introductory session designed to provide an overview of diabetes complications, 
ways the SP  and patient can work together positively, and ways to set "SMART" health goals. During this 
session, results of a diabetes complication risk profile are discussed with the patient and support person and the dyad learns how to set goals together . 
2. Be invited to 4 -6 family -focused, group diabetes self -management education sessions to be held at the FQHC  
or online using Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887]’s HIPAA- compliant Zoom environment. In -person sessions at FQHC  will last approximately 
[ADDRESS_200562] approximately 1 hour. American Diabetes Association -approved "Conversation Maps" will be used as a tool for providing patient education when

 feasible. Additional family -focused topi[INVESTIGATOR_171212], such as patient -SP communication and SP  roles in 
helpi[INVESTIGATOR_171213] . 
3. Complete additional  survey  assessments  and lab measures  (blood  pressure,  weight,  fingerstick A1c, and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]) 
with the study RA 6 -months after enrollment. The SP  will only complete one additional survey assessment 6-
months after  enrollment.  
4. Receive care management contacts with a CHW every 2 -4 weeks either in person or remotely (when 
necessary) . The CHW will talk with the dyad for approximately [ADDRESS_200564] 2020 will be contact[CONTACT_171251], optional "FAM -
ACT COVID" survey. The purpose of this survey is to determine how the events of the COVID -[ADDRESS_200565] affected participants' ability to participate in the intervention, and to care for their diabetes  
Additionally, the patient will have their FQHC  electronic chart reviewed for diabetes -related visit, lab, and medication 
information for the period from 12 months prior to 24 months following their study enrollment date.  
INTERVENTION PROCEDURES CONDUCTED IN BOTH STUDY ARMS  
A trained and supervised CHW , CHW  Manager, and/or RA at the FQHC will conduct all research participant contacts. 
Contacts at the FQHC  will be supervised by [CONTACT_171252] . In-person diabetes self- management 
education group sessions will take place in a large conference room with other FQHC patients present . Online group 
sessions will be attended by [CONTACT_171253](s) . A study RA also may be present to assist with 
technical issues . Participant  assessments will be completed in a pr ivate location at the FQHC  or remotely via 
phone/video call or Zoom . 
STUDY MEASURES  
PATIENT MEASURES  
Hemoglobin A1c  (HbA1c)  
To test HbA1c, two drops of blood will be removed by [CONTACT_171254] (fingerprick  with a sterile lancet) at each time points 
This is the standard method used to obtain blood for this laboratory test at the recruitment clinic site. FQHC Research 
Assistants (RAs) will be trained by [CONTACT_171255] [INVESTIGATOR_171214], and will be 
provided all necessary safety equipment (e.g. , gloves, hand sanitizer).  
In the event that study staff are unable to meet in person with patient s to conduct laboratory and vital sign 
assessments, either of the following two methods will be used to conduct the assessments: 
a) If the patient  is due to receive an HbA1c test, blood pressure measurement, or weight measurement as part 
of their routine clinical care within the approved study window for their baseline  or 6-month assessment, the 
results of the test may be recorded from the patient’s electronic health record rather than obtained via a study- staff conducted assessment. When appropriate, CHWs may contact [CONTACT_171256] 
a time for their provider -ordered clinical assessment or labs on a day that would ensure it occurs within the 
study assessment window . At that time, the CHW will remind the patient that they or their insurance may be 
billed for the clinic visit or blood draw because it is indicated as a part of their clinical care.  
b) If the method described in (a) is not practical, patient s will be sent supplies so that they can perform the 
fingerstick at home . If feasible, participants also will be asked to test their HbA1c themselves using a home-
testing device (e.g. A1cNow Self Check, pts Diagnostics) .

 Systolic blood pressure (SBP)  
Patient blood pressure will be measured by a trained staff member using an oscillometric upper arm blood pressure 
monitor and following American Heart Association guidelines5. Two readings will be taken [ADDRESS_200566] their FQHC electronic chart reviewed for diabetes -related visit, lab, and medication 
information for the period from 12 months prior to 24 months following their study enrollment date.  This information 
will be used to follow -up on possible missing data, and to offer future extended studies to this cohort.  
Health behaviors and psychosocial behavior determinants   
Health behaviors and psychosocial behavior determinants will be measured via self -report survey instruments. 
Surveys will be read aloud by a study RA in the participant’s preferred language either in -person or by [CONTACT_648], and 
responses will be recorded by [CONTACT_21118]. Select patient survey measures are presented in  Table 1. All Spanish -language 
surveys were professionally translated.

RISKS  
POTENTIAL RISKS INVOLVED IN THIS STUDY  
• Questionnaire assessments and collection of medical record information pose a risk for breach of  
confidentiality . 
• Audiotapi[INVESTIGATOR_171216]: it is possible that some participants may find being interviewed or audiotaped is stressful, and there is also a risk for breach of  confidentiality.  
• Fingersticks for HbA1c ( FQHC  Patients)  
o Patients may find these tests are uncomfortable, but the pain is typi[INVESTIGATOR_171217].  
o In about 10% of the cases, a small amount of bleeding under the skin will produce a bruise (hematoma). In rare cases, a small scar may persist for several  weeks.  
o The risk of local infection is less than [ADDRESS_200571] Study Protocol   v2.2.1 0622 22 
14 of 27 
 • Research assessments pose a small risk that patients will regret sharing certain medical or personal information 
with their SP . Rare risk of breach of confidentiality by [CONTACT_102]'s medical providers beyond what the patient  
authorized.  
• If patients choose to set goals to monitor blood pressure levels more frequently or adhere to prescribed blood 
pressure medication regimens more stringently, there is a small risk of symptomatic  hypertension (high  blood  
pressure).  High  blood  pressure  symptoms  can include: headaches, blurry vision, increased fatigue, chest pain, 
irregular heartbeat, and blurry vision . 
• If patients choose to set goals to monitor blood pressure levels more frequently or adhere to prescribed blood pressure medication regimens more stringently, there is a small risk of symptomatic hypotension (low blood pressure). Low blood pressure symptoms  can include: temporarily at levels that are too low, feeling light -headed, 
dizzy, sweaty, and rarely have minor confusion.  
• If patients choose to monitor blood sugar levels more frequently, adhere to prescribed diabetes medication regimens more stringently, or make changes to eating or activity habits, there is  a small risk of symptomatic 
hyperglycemia (high blood sugars). High blood sugars symptoms can include: headaches, blurry vision, increased fatigue, chest pain, difficulty breathing and irregular heartbeat.  
• If patients choose to set goals to monitor blood sugar levels more frequently, adhere to prescribed diabetes 
medication regimens more stringently, or make changes to eating or  activity habits, there is a small risk of 
symptomatic hypoglycemia (low blood sugars). Low blood sugar symptoms can include: feeling lightheaded, 
dizzy, sweaty, and rarely have minor confusion.  
STEPS THAT WILL BE TAKEN TO PREVENT OR TO MINIMIZE THE SEVERITY OF THE POTENTIAL RISKS  
Breach of confidentiality  
The study team will follow all Data Safety and Monitoring procedures in place at the FQHC  and within the University 
of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_171218]. Data will be monitored by [CONTACT_32928][INVESTIGATOR_171219].  
Fingerstick testing risks  
FQHC . RAs (RAs) will be thoroughly trained in the procedure and will use appropriate safety equipment available for 
this level of blood testing (gloves, sterile lancets, use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_171220]’s skin, biohazard box, etc.). Any unexpected events related to fingersticks that do occur will be reported first to clinicians at the local site and then to the study Principal Investigator. Patients who have had an HbA1c test performed at their local site as part of routine care in a two -week window prior to a study assessment will not be asked to repeat it for the assessment.  
Home testing . Patients will receive an information sheet along with their home testing supplies that includes 
instructions on how to perform the home -testing and what safety measure should be taken. The RA will remind 
patient s to use proper precautions to reduce risk of infection while walking them through the testing procedure.  
Survey and interview assessment burden  
FQHC  patient s and SP  will be informed as part of their informed consent process and immediately prior to each 
interview that they can drop out of the study at any time and that they can refuse to answer any of the individual questions in the assessments.  
Most of our assessment procedures have been pre- tested and validated by [CONTACT_29091], which suggests that 
they are well tolerated by [CONTACT_170496]. Moreover, we have pre- tested almost every item through previous large 
trials involving patients with diab etes or heart disease, some with SP s. 
 
 
FAM -ACT Study Protocol   v2.2.[ADDRESS_200572] to minimize the risk of breach of confidentiality. The rigorous privacy steps to maintain privacy and confidentiality are described in detail  below:  
It will be made clear to participants that no information gathered through study assessments will be shared with 
participants’ clinicians unless the patient appears to be in danger (in cases of suicidality, for example) and [CONTACT_171274] 
(PI) or [CONTACT_171275]  (Site -PI) deems it necessary to contact [CONTACT_2299]’s physician. Electronic assessment data and 
analytic files will be maintained on secure servers that are protected in accordance with the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_171221]. Only approved research personnel will have access to study files. Research data will be 
presented in aggregate statistics only. Throughout the study, IRB and HIPAA guidelines will be followed to ensure the 
privacy and integrity of the informa tion we collect. All study personnel will complete training in maintaining patient 
confidentiality and will sign a written statement indicating that they will preserve the confidentiality of patient records as a condition of their employment. Any breach of  confidentiality will be immediately reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_171222]. In addition, any complaints or concerns expressed to the study staff by [CONTACT_4317], providers, or anyone else 
affected by [CONTACT_171257] [INVESTIGATOR_171223].  
All surveys and interviews will be conducted in -person or from a private office with a closed door. To minimize the risk 
of loss of confidentiality, there will be no personally identifying data on survey assessments. Paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_171224] a locked filing cabinet at the FQHC . We will create a secure electronic tracking file that 
maps the subject’s identifying information to the arbitrary study identifier, which will serve as the participant’s primary 
identifier for all analytic fi les. Survey assessments will be conducted in person for all patient s and responses will be 
entered into the database thru tablets as the interview is being conducted. The SP  surveys may be done over the 
telephone or in -person, depending on the SP 's needs. All survey assessments will be available on paper as a backup in 
case electronic systems are not accessible or need to be completed over the telephone. If a paper survey assessment is 
used, it will contain the participant 's study ID but no identifying info rmation, and be stored in a locked filing cabinet 
until the data is double entered into the electronic study database.  
After the required data retention period, all personal identifiers will be removed from the data and linkage codes will 
be destroyed. The resulting de -identified data will be maintained in secure University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_171225].  
Patient -SP relationship   
We will reduce the risk of patient -SP conflicts through several strategies. These include the following: We specifically 
structure the SP ’s role as assistive to the patient. This is conveyed repeatedly in study contacts. For example, SP s are 
instructed to discuss any concerns with patients in a non- judgmental manner and to offer choices. They are instructed 
to encourage the patient to be the main contact [CONTACT_171258]’s health care providers whenever possible. Our 
 
6 Enrolled FQHC patients will be asked about ways family members and friends help or hinder their health management in general.  
Enrolled FQHC patients will be asked for more detailed information about the SP who is also a consented and enrolled study 
partic ipant. The participant's descriptions of how third parties interact with the participant around diabetes and health 
management will be collected and recorded. The third parties will not be identified by [CONTACT_2300].  
FAM -ACT Study Protocol   v2.2.[ADDRESS_200573] that under these arrangements, patients welcome the supporter person's 
instrumental and emotional support.  
Clear and redundant presentation through printed participant guidelines for patients and support people to structure 
their roles encourage effective communication. This information is repeated in smaller chunks throughout the study 
timeline, both per the schedule and in response to study events.  
FQHC  CHWs will be trained to detect possible sign s of conflict during their contacts with participants and their scripts 
will include a range of responses and guidance on selecting the appropriate response. All participants can also 
spontaneously report a concern by [CONTACT_171259].  
Conflict resolution strategies range in intensity from tailored CHW messages to the involvement of a site clinical health psychologist, and to termination of participation if necessary to protect participants from distress.
 
FQHC  patient s’ willingness to share their health information with their SP  will be explicitly confirmed in their written 
consent. We will thoroughly explain to patients the type of information that will be included in CHW contacts with SP s. 
To minimize the risk of patient regret oversharing health information, we are stipulating that the SP  should be 
someone who is already regularly involved in the patient’s health care. No information will be shared with a SP  before 
it is shared directly with the patient. In addition, only information that is directly related to diabetes management and 
management of risk of diabetes complications will be included in written or oral communications with the SP s. Thus, 
information shared with the SP s will exclude information on potentially sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], such as psychiatric care or 
sexual health. The FQHC  CHW will be thoroughly trained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_171226] -relevant data 
from the medical record prior to each phone call to a patient. The review process will be tested prior to intervention 
start and monitored by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_171227] a random sample of documents (sampled more 
frequently at the beginning of the study). Patients and SP s will be reminded at every study contact [CONTACT_171260]’s participation in care at any time.  
SP caregiving burden  
Prior studies involving chronically ill patients and already -involved supporters show that caregiver burden does 
not increase, and often decreases, following this type of intervention. We will include reminders in SP  contacts 
that they can call the FQHC  study staff  they are experiencing increased careg iving related stress or burden.  
Hypoglycemia or hypotension  
Alternatives: Patients may choose not to take steps that will lower their sugar or blood pressure levels. Precautions: 
Patients will be advised to make small changes in their self -care regimens over time and not large changes at once. 
They will also be advised to discuss any changes in medication regimen or physical activity routines with their 
healthcare providers before proceed ing. All those participating in intervention sessions will be trained on how to 
recognize common symptoms of hypoglycemia and hypo tension, and how to self -treat minor epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. We expect 
that SPs in Program B  (Family -Focused) will become more skilled at recognizing and managing hypoglycemia and 
hypotension. Safeguards: Participants will be advised to notify their healthcare providers if experiencing these 
effects more than once, and they will be advised to seek emergency care for severe symptoms.  
Hyperglycemia or hypertension  
Alternatives: Patients may choose not to take steps that increase their sugar or blood pressure levels. Precautions: 
Patients will be advised to make small changes in their self -care regimens over time and not large changes at once. 
They will also be advised to discuss any changes in medication regimen or physical activity routines with their site 
healthcare providers before pr oceeding. All those participating in intervention sessions will be trained  on how to 
recognize common symptoms of hyperglycemia and hypertension and how to self -treat minor  epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. We expect 
that SPs (FAM- ACT) will become more skilled at recognizing and managing hyperglycemia and hypertension. 
Safeguards: Participants will be advised to notify their health care providers if experiencing these effects more than 
once, and they will be advised to seek emergency care for severe symptoms.  
FAM -ACT Study Protocol   v2.2.[ADDRESS_200574] of the study include the following.  
• The study Principal Investigator ([CONTACT_171276]- Marie Rosla nd), Pi[INVESTIGATOR_171228], FQHC  Site PI ([CONTACT_171277]), and the FQHC  Site Coordinator /CHW Manager will be notified.  
• FQHC  patient s will be referred to their healthcare provider at their local site, or to emergency medical 
services, if appropriate. FQHC  study staff will offer to directly contact [CONTACT_2299]'s local healthcare 
providers with the patient's permission.  
• SPs will be advised to contact [CONTACT_171261], or referred to emergency medical services if 
appropriate.  
If a SP shows/expresses signs of suicide, the FQHC  research team will follow the FAM -ACT SP Suicide Protocol attached 
in the appendices and supporting documents. This protocol is a clinically significant plan for an unexpected condition.  
Individuals may choose to not be in the study and continue their current/usual FQHC care for diabetes . 
Specific endpoints or other circumstances that will result in discontinuing a subject’s participation  
If study participants experience a significantly disabling health event (e.g. disabling stroke that makes continued 
participation difficult) they may be removed from active participation in the intervention but, if the participant does not elect to complet ely withdraw, they will still be retained in the study and contact[CONTACT_171262]. If FQHC patient -participants experience a significant separation in 
relationship with their SP  (e.g. divorce from a spouse) the SP  may be removed from active participation in the 
intervention, but, if the participants do not elect to completely end the SP ’s participation, the SP will be retained in the 
study and contact[CONTACT_171263].  
Any participant will be discontinued from study participation if they exhibit violent, threatening, or harassing behavior 
towards study or FQHC  site staff. Any participant will be discontinued from study participation if they experience 
incarceration or are placed on parole during their participation period. 
Female patient s who become pregnant during study participation may be discontinued from the study and will be 
advised to seek medical advice regarding diabetes management during pregnancy with their usual healthcare provider 
as soon as possible.  
BENEFITS  
Participants may experience direct benefits from participation in this study. All patient and SP s may learn new 
information about diabetes symptoms, healthy behaviors, and self -care. In addition, FAM -ACT assigned participants 
may learn how SP s can effectively support healthy behaviors and health care. This may improve the quality of patient s’ 
diabetes management and outcomes and may improve SP s’ healthy behaviors and lower the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_171229] (if the SP  also has diabete s). 
Because diabetes is prevalent in this community and results in substantial morbidity, health care utilization, and costs, we feel the study's potential benefits outweigh the low risk of minimal harm to participants.  
Participants will be mailed a layperson -friendly summary of trial results from the trial after all main analyses have 
been completed.  
DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN  
Standardized clinical data collection protocols will be in place for the clinical trial as documented in study procedures documents. The PI, in collaboration with the Clinical Trials Coordinating Center (CCDC) at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], will ensure t hat the study is conducted according to the protocol and will be responsible for carrying out the Data 
Safety and Monitoring Plan ( DSMP ).  
FAM -ACT Study Protocol   v2.2.1 0622 22 
18 of 27 
 Weekly study team meetings, monthly data review, and periodic site visits (approx imately  4 per year) will be used to 
review that all data quality and IRB policies and procedures are being followed. This will include ensuring that (1) all 
participants understand, agree to, and sign a written consent form before participating; (2) strict adhere nce is 
maintained to communication regarding the participants’ right to withdraw or refuse to answer questions; (3) staff maintain confidentiality both by [CONTACT_171264]-copy and electronic data collection forms and by [CONTACT_171265]; (4) consent forms and identifying information are kept separately from study related information about patients’ sociodemographic s, clinical characteristics, disease self -
care, service use, and outcomes; (5) all identifying information is kept locked at all times and sensitive computer files are maintained on a secured server; (6) coding of  ambiguous responses is handled in a way that is consistent and clear 
across data collectors and over time; and (7) participants are informed in writing how to contact [CONTACT_9154], study project coordinators ( FQHC  & University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]), and relevant IRB office with any questions or concerns.  
The CCDC will use a web -based data entry and tracking system with password protection layers that will be used to 
restrict access to certain staff. The CCDC will incorporate clinical, data management, and statistical expertise in the 
creation of the data e ntry and tracking system, especially as it relates to the development of the case report forms. 
Key features of the  data management and web design plan we will implement are described in subsequent sections . 
DATA COLLECTION AND FORM DEVELOPMENT  
Each case report form (CRF) will be developed by [CONTACT_171266]. In order to make 
sure that important study forms are not overlooked, CRFs will be considered across the following categories: 1) screening & baseline information; 2) follow up visits, tests, and procedures; 3) adherence to study treatment; 4) 
adverse experiences; 5) concomitant medications; 6) clinical endpoints; and 7) subject treatment, follow up, and vita l 
status. This allows initial discussions on CRF development to center around each of the categories, and prevents 
particular forms from being missed.  
The tracking system will generate a schedule of data collection for each participant and automatically send reminders to the clinical study coordinators when a data collection visit or call is due. The study staff will log into the data entry 
and tracking system, enter the participant’s study ID, then choose the visit to be viewed; the appropriate set of forms 
will be generated for that participant based on the visit number. To minimize missing data, all of the study forms will have certain key fields that are required before form submission. Pop -up windows will also be used to remind the 
study coordinator or data entry personnel that particular fields are empty upon form submission and give reasons as to why incomplete data was submitted. Each CRF will be made available on the study website for review and download by [CONTACT_133331].  
A subset of the CRFs will include the ability for the investigators to electronically “sign off” on the submitted information. These CRFs include those that are deemed critical (i.e. adverse events).  
DATA ENTRY AT CLINICAL SITE  
Data will be entered electronically via a password -protected Web -based data entry system, but paper versions of 
forms will be provided for manual entry in case of technical issues. The system will be created using ASP.NET programming, with the data stored using MS SQL Server. When the study coordinator logs in and enters the participant study ID for which data are being entered, the screens generated will match the paper form(s) most recently created for that study ID. The study staff will not be able to enter data for forms not generated for that study 
ID or visit. Similarly, the Web -based data entry screens will have out -of-range and other limits that will not permit the 
entry of inappropriate data.  
PARTICIPANT ELIGIBILITY, & RANDOMIZATION  
The data entry process will begin during the online participant enrollment into the clinical trial. The clinical site will 
have the ability to generate a participant ID upon initiation, which will unlock screening forms that will be completed 
to assess the  study inclusion and exclusion criteria detailed in the protocol. The CCDC will utilize an “eligibility 
checklist” which is pre -populated with information from all questions that directly relate to inclusion and exclusion 
criteria. By [CONTACT_171267] a separate  form with checkboxes for each criterion, this will prevent any data entry errors which 
may result in ineligible randomizations.  
FAM -ACT Study Protocol   v2.2.[ADDRESS_200575], 
and the Web- based system will return the participant’s study arm assignment ( I-DSMES  or FAM -ACT). Any information 
collected that identifies the participant will be deleted from the study database immediately after being reviewed by 
[CONTACT_171268].  
STUDY DESIGN TRACKING  
The CCDC tracking and reporting systems are integrated within the web- based data management. The tracking system 
will include programmed follow -up time periods to ascertain which subjects are due for what milestone visit or 
contact. In addition, a calendar  will be created to facilitate scheduling of follow -up visits. The customized tracking 
system will be used to generate reports to monitor study progress and for presentation at Investigator meetings. These reports will include detailed recruitment numbers,  serious adverse events ( SAEs ), and outstanding forms.  
DATA QUALITY CONTROL  
The CCDC has several systems programmers and data managers who will design and maintain the data entry/checking 
programs as well as maintain the databases, generate reports, and provide long -distance support for data entry 
personnel. In addition, appropriate documentation and other training materials will be made available on the study 
website for data entry personnel. If necessary, a system programmer will visit study personnel in person to resolve problems not easily addressed on the phone or via remote monitoring methods.  
During data entry, a number of strategies will be employed to ensure quality of data: use of standard methods of data 
collection and recording already specified in study protocols, careful programming of the data management system, 
detailed documentation of computer operations and data editing procedures, and regular meetings with project staff to review any changes in procedure. The CCDC will verify all data, program out -of-range data checks into data entry 
fields, and evaluate the full data process within and across forms. A typi[INVESTIGATOR_171230]: impossible values (e.g., negative blood pressure) and suspi[INVESTIGATOR_171231] (e.g., SBP > 300). The former will be coded into the data entry system, restricting such values f rom being entered. CCDC personnel will check 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_171232] -cleaning phase, at which point logical checks 
will be performed, and outliers will be analyzed. The CCDC will also utilize centralized statistical monitoring, which provides an efficient and cost -effect alternative to on -site visits.  
Audit logs track changes to information previously submitted and recorded on electronic forms and will be used to ensure data integrity. Information on the person responsible for the change, the date of the change, the previous entry in the data field, the  new entry in the data field, and the reason for the change are recorded and displayed in the 
electronic forms audit trail.  
DATA & SAFETY MONITORING  
The CCDC will work with the clinical investigators to develop and formalize a data & safety monitoring plan for the study which will include specifics for a site initiation visit, interim monitoring visits, for -cause visits (if necessary), and 
close -out vi sit. Due to the nature of the intervention, we anticipate this can be done remotely rather than on- site. Our 
risk-based monitoring plan will focus on:  
• Eligibility confirmation: The FQHC  RA, FQHC  CHW, or FQHC  Site Coordinator will review all screening- related 
CRFs and confirm eligibility with electronic signature [INVESTIGATOR_83106]. 
• Consent monitoring: the clinical site will be able to upload signed participant consents to a secure repository, 
where the CCDC coordinator will be able to monitor them in real time.  
• Complete ascertainment of primary and key secondary outcomes: The CCDC coordinator will be notified in 
real time if there are instances of missing outcomes, which will allow the coordinator to query the clinical site and resolve the issue.  
• Serious adverse events and protocol violations: The CCDC coordinator is notified of all SAEs and protocol violations as they occur.  
FAM -ACT Study Protocol   v2.2.1 0622 22 
20 of 27 
 The FQHC  clinic Site Coordinator  will be able to upload source data to the study website, where a CCDC coordinator 
will be able to complete a full review of source data verification of critical elements as well as regulatory documents; 
and participant informed consents. At the conclusion of the audit, a summary of the site visit findings will be discussed 
with the PI , the Site PI  [INVESTIGATOR_89560]. A detailed summary report will document the audit findings and can be 
supplied to the Study Investigators, NIDDK program staff, and the study personnel. This information will also be kept 
in the electronic regulatory management system.  
Protocol alerts  
In addition, the CCDC will work with the clinical team to define “protocol alerts” for the study. This would include 
email notifications for the following situations: a participant meeting enrollment criteria, a form or set of forms that need to be electro nically signed by [CONTACT_7910] , submission of SAEs , submission of protocol deviations, and other safety 
issues such as death. In addition, alert values for blood pressures and symptoms will be established. The study staff 
will notify the Site Coordinator, t he subject, and, for FQHC  patient s the subject’s physician whenever there are results 
outside of these values because of the clinical implications of a value substantially out of normal range. Outstanding 
protocol alerts will be reviewed on a monthly basis with the PI . 
Serious adverse events  
FQHC  RAs conducting assessments and the FQHC  CHWs implementing the intervention will follow a strict protocol 
that includes immediate reporting of adverse events and potential problems. Additionally, a section of the informed 
consent document that will be given to each participant will provide conta ct information for both the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_171233] -report of adverse events . The CCDC will notify the 
appropriate entities (i.e., Pi[INVESTIGATOR_68348], NIDDK) regarding all study -related serious adverse events within reporting 
guidelines listed in the study protocol. The CCDC will categorize all SAEs according to the NCIs Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). A designated safety monitor (the PI [INVESTIGATOR_171234]- PI) will be tasked with adjudicating a ll 
SAEs with the aid of discharge summaries uploaded to the web -based data management system. On a monthly basis, 
SAEs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_079]. In addition, we will compi[INVESTIGATOR_5829] a comprehensive annual report detailing all study -wide serio us adverse events, including those events that are study related and those unrelated to 
study participation. Additionally, site -specific SAE summary reports will be created for each site’s local IRB annual 
renewal submission, which will also be included on the electronic regulatory management system.  
Should new information become available during the course of this research that may indicate that the risks of harm 
to participants have significantly increased, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_171235], so they may reconsider their willingness to stay in the study.  
Data management, security, and confidentiality  
The EWI (Enterprise Web Infrastructure) is backed up with the Symantec NetBackup system. The backup images are 
processed through an IBM ProtectTier appliance and stored on IBM DS8870 storage arrays. All EWI servers get a daily 
operating system backup in th e form of a full or differential backup. The backup schedule has daily differential and bi -
weekly full backups for all EWI servers. The backup images have a retention period of [ADDRESS_200576] selection. Audit trails will be implemented to log date, time, individual, changed 
values, and rationale for all data changes.  
PARTICIPANT PRIVACY  
It will be made clear to participants that no information gathered through study assessments will be shared with participants’ healthcare providers unless the patient appears to be in danger (in cases of suicidality, for example) and [CONTACT_171274] (PI) or [CONTACT_171275] (Site -PI) deems it necessary to contact [CONTACT_2299]’s physician. Electronic 
assessment data and analytic files will be maintained on secure servers that are protected in accordance with the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_171236]. Only approved research personnel will have access to study files. Research data will be presented in aggregate statistics only.  
Throughout the study, IRB and HIPAA guidelines will be followed to ensure the privacy and integrity of the 
information we collect. All study personnel will complete training in maintaining patient confidentiality and will sign a 
written statement indicatin g that they will preserve the confidentiality of patient records as a condition of their 
employment. Any breach of confidentiality will be immediately reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_171237]. In addition, any complaints or concerns expressed to the study staff by [CONTACT_4317], providers, or anyone else affected by [CONTACT_171257] [INVESTIGATOR_171238].  
All surveys and interviews will be conducted in -person or from a private office with a closed door. To minimize 
the risk of loss of confidentiality, there will be no personally identifying data on survey assessments.  
CONFIDENTIALITY AND ACCESS TO DATA  
Access to the study data include s authorized representatives of the sponsor of the study, National Institutes of 
Health or authorized representatives that they delegate, such as representatives from monitoring or auditing 
companies. Investigators will have access to data/samples for purposes of conducting this research study. De -
identified data may be shared with investigators conducting other research.  
After the required data retention period, all personal identifiers will be removed from the data and linkage codes 
will destroyed. The resulting de -identified data will be maintained in the secure University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_171239].  
STUDY WITHDRAWAL  
No additional data will be collected on participants who provide informed consent but are later determined to be ineligible to participate, or on participants who withdraw from the study. A coded identifier will be added to a “do not contact” list maintain ed only for the duration of the recruitment phase in order to prevent such individuals 
from being re- solicited. Any research data already collected while the participant was a consented participant will 
be maintained according to overall study guidelines u nless the participant requests that the data be removed and 
destroyed.  
COMPENSATION/PARTICIPANT PAYMENT  
FQHC  patient s will receive a $ 50 incentive for each completed assessment, and SP s will receive a $25 incentive for 
each completed assessment.  Patients who complete a 12 -month assessment will receive an additional $30.  There will 
not be a partial payment offered for partially completed assessments. All research study participants must complete the assessment to their fullest ability to receive their full payment at that time point.

 APPENDICES & SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION  
APPENDIX [ADDRESS_200579] during the COVID -19 pandemic.  For additional detail on these adaptations see our 
2022 publication in Trials : 
Deverts DJ, Heisler M, Kieffer EC, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_171202], Valbuena F, Yabes JG, Guajardo C, Ilarraza- Montalvo D, Palmisano G, 
Koerbel G, Rosland AM. Comparing the effectiveness of Family Support for Health Action (FAM -ACT) with traditional 
community health worker -led i nterventions to improve adult diabetes management and outcomes: study protocol for a 
randomized controlled trial. Trials. 2022 Dec;23(1):1- 22. 
ORIGINAL PROTOCOL  ADAPTED PROTOCOL  
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA    
The s tudy planned to examine 5 -year diabetes -specific 
cardiac risk ([LOCATION_006] Prospective Diabetes Study [[LOCATION_006]PDS] 
score) as a secondary outcome. Thus , adults with 
diabetes were eligible to participate if (a) their most 
recent HbA1c is > 8.0% and/or (b) ha ve poor blood 
pressure control  (SBP >150mm Hg ), recorded in the 
FQHC EMR at least twice in the past [ADDRESS_200580] recent SBP being >150mm Hg.  Because [LOCATION_006]PDS score was dropped as an outcome (see 
Outcomes/ Secondary outcomes), poor blood pressure 
control no longer is being used as an inclusion criterion, 
thus requiring all patient participants to qualify based on 
their HbA1c. Eliminating the blood pressure criterion 
effectively reduces the size of our eligib le patient pool. 
To compensate for this limitation, the HbA1c criterion 
has been lowered to > 7.5%.   
LENGTH OF INTERVENTION PROTOCOL    
Both the FAM -ACT and I -DSMES interventions were 
designed to last [ADDRESS_200581] 6 months of the 12 -
month period.  The intervention has been condensed to 6 months to 
compensate for (a) the several -month pandemic -related 
pause in research recruitment and (b) the additional 
time needed to make substantial changes to the study 
and intervention. The shorter protocol permit s full 
sample recruitment, with time to complete the protocol, 
within the timeframe of study funding.  
INTRODUCTORY AND DSME SESSION DELIVERY    
Intervention sessions were designed to be delivered in -
person at the FQHC, with each session lasting 1.5 to 2 
hours. Conducting the group sessions in- person enables 
the CHW to use the ADA -approved DSMES Conversation 
Maps® and other visual aids. This hands -on approach is 
designed to encourage participant engagement with the 
material a nd give participants  an opportunity to interact 
with other patients with diabetes. The face -to-face 
setting also facilitates communication and relationship -
building between part icipant s and the CHW.  To accommodate restrictions on in -person and group 
contact [CONTACT_171269], introductory 
sessions and DSMES  sessions for both interventions have 
been redesigned for  virtual platform  delivery  (Zoom). 
Several changes were made to both the structure and 
content of the sessions, including reducing the duration 
of the sessions to 45 -60 minutes, replacing the DSME S 
Conversation Maps® with online PowerPoint slides and 
creating revised facilitator guides that are better suited 
to virtual delivery of the DSMES intervention.  
BIWEEKLY CARE MANAGEMENT CONTACTS    
CHW contacts were designed to be delivered 
predominantly by [CONTACT_171270], but also in-
person at the FQHC during clinical visits, or at the 
participant’s home if necessary.  To accommodate social distancing guidelines and 
participant and CHW health precautions, in- person care 
management contacts have been eliminated.  
FAM -ACT Study Protocol   v2.2.[ADDRESS_200582] only : If the patient and 
SP live  together , the patient  also is given the SP’s 
materials. If they live separately, the RA will mail the SP 
their materials.  
OUTCOMES    
Primary outcome:  The original primary outcome was 
change in patient HbA1c from baseline to [ADDRESS_200583] -baseline, reflecting the original intervention length 
of 12 months.  Primary outcome:  The primary outcome was revised to 
change in HbA1c from baseline to 6 months, reflecting 
the adapted intervention length of 6 months.  
Secondary outcomes:  The original analysis plan included 
6-month and 12 -month change in patient [LOCATION_006]PDS score 
as a secondary outcome. The calculation of [LOCATION_006]PDS score 
is based on HbA1c, SBP , cholesterol levels, and smoking 
status.  Secondary outcomes:  Change in [LOCATION_006]PDS score has been 
dropped as a secondary outcome because patient 
cholesterol can not be measured reliably without in -
person assessment. A substantial number of first wave 
patients  became eligible for their [ADDRESS_200584].  
SAMPLE SIZE    
See analysis plan   
DATA COLLECTION    
HbA1c:  Per the original protocol, patients were to have 
their HbA1c assessed at 3 time points: baseline, [ADDRESS_200585] -
baseline. All assessments were to be conducted by [CONTACT_171271].   HbA1c:  To accommodate pandemic -related restrictions 
on in -person research activities, [ADDRESS_200586] been incorporated into the 
protocol.  
Clinic measures . Tests unable to be obtained in- person 
during the assessment window will be recorded from 
patient s’ EMRs rather than obtained via a study staff -
conducted assessment.  
Home testing. Patients may be offered the option to self-
test their HbA1c using a fingerstick device (e.g. A1cNow® 
Self Check, pts Diagnostics) sent to their home.  
Survey assessments:  As part of the original protocol, SPs 
were to be assessed by [CONTACT_171272] 2 timepoints: baseline 
and [ADDRESS_200587] -baseline.  Survey assessments:  Because the duration of the study 
protocol was decreased from [ADDRESS_200588] -
baseline.

FAM -ACT Study Protocol   v2.2.[ADDRESS_200589] STUDY GUIDE TO SUICIDAL PARTICIPANTS 
Suicidal Ideation:  If a FAM -ACT participant volunteers information about suicidal ideation, like:  
• I’d rather not be alive anymore  
• I want to sleep and never wake up 
• I can’t take it anymore  
• I don’t know what I might  do 
The FQHC  research study team member will complete the Participant Suicide Risk Screening Questions  on the next 
page, and follow the instructions for the correct action step.

 Action Step 1:  
In-Person or on the telephone : 
If the respondent reports NO active suicidal thoughts, plans, or intent, reply to the patients with the following bullets, and 
continue the study:  
• Thank you for your responses. I am glad that you are not thinking of harming yourself. Any thoughts that you would 
be better off dead are worrisome and I strongly suggest that you talk with your regular mental health professional or doctor about this  soon.  
• I would like to give you this list of Mental Health providers in case you may have these thoughts  again.  
• I would also like to give you the toll- free National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1 -800- 273- 8255. The National Suicide 
Prevention Lifeline is a national network of local crisis centers that provides free and confidential emotional support to people in suicidal crisis or emotional distress 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We're committed to improving cris is 
services and advancing suicide prevention by [CONTACT_171273], advancing professional best practices, and building  awareness  
Action Step 2:  
In-Person or on the telephone : 
If the respondent reports ANY active suicidal thoughts or plan but indicates that he/she has NO intent to act on those thoughts 
within the next few days, provide him/her with the same information provided in Action Step 1.  
Action Step 3:  
On-Site at FQHC : 
If the respondent reports that it is either “somewhat likely” or “likely” that he or she will “harm himself (or herself) or e nd his 
(or her) life over the next few days,” or engaged in suicidal or high -risk behavior, provide him/her with the following 
information:  
• I am very concerned about your thoughts of harming yourself (or high- risk behavior) and I think it is very important 
that you speak with a mental health professional about these thoughts right away. What I would like for you to do now is talk with the FQHC  mental health specialist currently  here.  
On the Telephone with the Participant or Off -Site: 
If the respondent reports that it is either “somewhat likely” or “likely” that he or she will “harm himself (or herself) or e nd his 
(or her) life over the next few days,” or engaged in suicidal or high -risk behavior, provide him/her with the following 
information:  
Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline n umber together with the participant immediately: Lifeline: 1 -800- 273- 8255

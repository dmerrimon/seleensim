Study Title:  An Open -Label, Phase 1 Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability 
of Subcutaneous Elamipretide in Subjects with Intermediate Age -Related 
Macular Degeneration  
Study Number:  SPI[CONTACT_162702] -101 
Study Phase:  Phase 1  
Study Objectives:  The primary objective of this study is:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability  of subcutaneous (SC) injections of 
elamipretide in subjects with intermediate age -related macular 
degeneration  (AMD)  
The secondary objectives of this study are:  
• To evaluate the feasibility of administration of SC injections of 
elamipretide in subjects with intermediate  AMD  
• To evaluate the changes from baseline in physical/ophthalmic 
examinations  
Study Design:  This is an open -label, Phase [ADDRESS_1007117] 1 eye with intermediate AMD, including a high - 
risk drusen without geographic atrophy (GA) cohort and a noncentral GA 
cohort.  
Cohort 1: High -risk drusen is defined as the presence of at least 1 large  
(≥ 125 μm) druse or multiple medium -size (between 63 and 124 μm) drusen.  
Cohort 2: Noncentral GA is defined as evidence of GA with cumulative area  
≥1.27 mm2 (approximately 0.5 disc area [DA]) by [CONTACT_737259] 
(FAF), which spares the fovea (defined as retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_737228] -optical coherence tomography [SD - 
OCT]).  
The study eye of eligible subjects must fall into one of the two cohorts, as 
defined above, cannot have choroidal neovascular (CNV) AMD or advanced 
central GA, and may not have previously received antiangiogenic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (in 
addition to meeting other spec ified inclusion/exclusion criteria). The AMD 
disease status of the fellow eye is not restricted: the fellow eye may have 
intermediate AMD with high -risk drusen, advanced central GA, or CNV 
AMD, and the fellow eye is allowed to receive antiangiogenic therap ies. 
Written informed consent will be obtained from all subjects before the 
Screening visit.  
The screening examination will be performed no more than 14 days before the 
Baseline visit. Data to be collected from the screening examination will 
include signif icant and/or ongoing medical and ocular history, vital sign 
measurements, physical examination, routine blood samples for hematology, 
chemistry, and urinalysis, ECG, manifest refraction, measurement of  
best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) using the Early Tr eatment Diabetic 
Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale completed twice, intraocular pressure 
measurement, slit -lamp examination, dilated fundus examination, fundus 
photography, spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD -OCT), FAF, 
fluorescein angiography*,  best-corrected low -luminance (LL) visual acuity 
completed twice, mesopic microperimetry, dark adaptometry, and Low - 
Luminance Questionnaire.  Women of childbearing potential will have a 
serum pregnancy test.  *Fluorescein angiography assessments done as  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPI[CONTACT_162702] -[ADDRESS_1007118] of care and completed within 90 days prior to dosing are allowed to 
be used for screening purposes.  
After the screening examination, relevant data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_737229]. Eligible subjects will return for the 
Baseline (Day 0) visit, at which time qualified subjects will be assigned to 
study treatment. Each sub ject will be assigned into [ADDRESS_1007119]’s disease state in the Screening 
Period. Elamipretide will be supplied as 40 mg/1 mL of sterile solution for SC 
injection. The dose of elamipretide will be 40 m g administered as a once daily  
1.0 mL SC injection.  
At the time of initial study drug administration, training on the proper SC 
administration of the study drug solution (by [CONTACT_423], regular caregiver, or 
his/her appropriate designee) will occur. Subjects will be trained using a 
standard script explaini ng the importance of proper administration of study 
drug on a daily basis for the [ADDRESS_1007120] and provided, as 
needed.  
Safety and tolerability will be measured throughout the Study Treatment 
Period, while exploratory anatomical and physiologic endpoints will be 
measured at time points as specified in the Schedule of Events. Visits will 
occur at: Day 7 (± 3 days), Week 4 (± 7 days), Week 8 (± 7 days), Week 12 (±  
7 days), Week 16 (± 7 days), Week 20 (± 7 days), and Week 24 (± 7 days), 
with phone calls to collect safe ty information completed at Week 2 (± 4 days), 
Week 6 (± 4 days), Week 10 (± 4 days), Week 14 (± 4 days), Week 18 (± 4 
days), and Week 22 (± 4 days).  
Ocular imaging will be read by [CONTACT_737260] (EDC) system on a regular basis 
throughout the study.  
After completion of the [ADDRESS_1007121]-study drug follow -up visit is scheduled at We ek 28 (± 7 days).  
Study procedures, their timing, and additional details are found in the 
Schedule of Events ( Table 3 ). 
Investigational Product, Dose 
and Mode of Administration:  Elamipretide will be supplied as 40 mg/[ADDRESS_1007122] ered at approximately the 
same time each day by [CONTACT_497605] (rotating clockwise 
around the 4 abdominal quadrants), and may be administered by [CONTACT_737261]: the clinical site staff, designated caregiver, or the 
subject. R efer to dosing instructions document for more details.

Sample Size and Statistical 
Methods:  For this Phase 1 study, the sample size of 40 evaluable subjects is reasonably 
sized for demonstrating clinical safety and tolerability. An equal enrollment 
(1:1) of approximately 20 subjects per cohort (cohort 1: 20 and cohort 2:  20) 
is targeted, but sub ject availability may dictate the actual enrollment ratio 
between the cohorts.  
General Methods:  
Continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_9086] (sample 
size, mean, standard deviation, median, and minimum and maximum).  
Discrete variables w ill be summarized by [CONTACT_22977]. All 
study data are to be displayed in the data listings. Importantly, tabulated data 
will be presented for each Cohort as well as the Total Sample (i.e., data from 
both cohorts pooled together).  
All data ar e to be displayed in the data listings, sorted by [CONTACT_3598], or 
where appropriate. Each listing will have indication of which cohort each 
subject was assigned to.  
Analysis Populations:  
All subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_1007127] disposition summaries will include the 
number of subjects treated (i.e., in the Safety population). The number and 
percentage of subjects who compl ete or discontinue from the study will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_48933]. Subject’s age, sex, weight, and other demographic 
characteristics will be recorded and summarized. Medical history will be 
listed.  
Safety Analyses:  
Adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_6657], 
presenting the number and percentage of subjects having adverse events.  
Adverse Events attributed to an individual eye or both eyes will be  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPI[CONTACT_162702] -101 Clinical Protocol Version 7.0, 20Jun17  
Confidential and Proprietary  Page 9 of 88   
  
 characterized by [CONTACT_737266]. Severity and relationship to study drug 
will be listed as appropriate.  
Efficacy Analyses:  
Changes in endpoints will be presented by [CONTACT_737267]. For continuous data of the by -cohort o utcomes, a mixed model for 
repeated measures (MMRM) will be used, with fixed effects for cohort, 
baseline covariate, study visit, the cohort -by-visit interaction, and random 
effects for subject. For continuous data for the pooled outcomes, an MMRM 
with fix ed effects for baseline covariate and study visit, and random effects  for 
subject will be used. Plots of the Least Square Mean (LSMean) values over 
time will be presented for each  endpoint.  
Interim Analysis  
This is an open -label study, and thus monitoring of data outcomes over the 
course of the study may be performed. In addition, an interim analysis may be 
performed on partial or all data when the first [ADDRESS_1007128] completed 
through 24 weeks of treatment.  
The interim analysis may be performed by [CONTACT_941] S ponsor or their 
designee. Assessments of both safety and efficacy endpoints will be 
performed utilizing similar methods as are planned for the final analysis. 
Additional details of all statistical analyses will be included in a separate 
statistical analysi s plan.

Mitochondria are organelles responsible for generating adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by a series 
of redox reactions through the electron transport chain (ETC) and ATP synthase. Mitochondria 
normally produce a small amount of reactive oxygen species including superoxide anions and 
hydrogen peroxide as physiological by[CONTACT_737268]. Under 
conditions of metabolic or genetic stress, mitochondria can become a ma jor endogenous source 
of reactive oxygen species such as superoxide anions, peroxynitrite, and hydroxyl radicals.  
Increased oxidative damage to the inner membrane of the mitochondria leads to imbalances in 
the electron transport chain, resulting in further  increased superoxide and hydrogen peroxide 
production, which in turn can initiate a vicious cycle of further damage to membrane and 
mitochondrial proteins and mitochondrial DNA. Excess production of oxidants can damage 
mitochondrial proteins and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_86152]  a point that triggers mitochondria to activate signaling 
pathways that mediate nonlethal cellular injury. 2 The biology of nonlethal injury at the retinal 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_1836] (RPE) includes cytosolic actin aggregate formation , cell membrane blebbing 
at the basal aspect of the RPE, vimentin upregulation, decreased matrix metalloproteinase 
(MMP) -2 activity, and other mediators of sub -RPE deposit formation that are relevant to the 
pathobiology of drusen formation, the hallmark fe ature of early age -related macular  degeneration 
(AMD). [ADDRESS_1007137] photodetection and phototransduction by [CONTACT_737269]. This can result in diminished visual acuity, 
particularly in low -luminance (LL) conditions, where efficiency of photon capture is necessary 
for optimal visual  function.  
 
4.1. Disease  Background  
4.1.1.  Age-related Macular  Degeneration  
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive degenerative disorder of the retina 
affecting 30% of people over age [ADDRESS_1007138] common cause of blindness in the elderly in 
the developed world.4 Early and intermediate stages of dry AMD are characterized by [CONTACT_737270] -lipid-rich deposits under the RPE .5,6 No treatments are currently available to regress 
druse n or to prevent drusen progression into geographic atrophy (GA). Dry AMD/drusen 
pathogenesis is multifactorial, and requires aging7 plus interaction among genetic,8-11 systemic 
health,12 and environmental risk factors (dietary fats, smoking).13,[ADDRESS_1007139]

Bruch’s membrane, complement activation, and formation of toxic by[CONTACT_737271].  
 
4.1.2.  Age-Related Macular Degeneration With Mitochondrial  Abnormalities  
Emerging evidence suggests an association between mitochondrial dysfunction and dry AMD 
pathobiology. Patients with inherited mitochondrial diseases develop maculopathy similar in 
appearance to dry AMD. In histopathology specimens, mitochondria are located along the basal 
aspect of RPE, often near drusen, and specifically, mitochondria in RPE with drusen are reduced 
approximately 50% as compared to age -matched controls and exhibit pathologic m orphology, 
especially vacuolization. Moreover, RPE mitochondrial DNA in AMD eyes exhibit more 
oxidative damage as compared with aged control eyes without AMD. Taken together, these 
findings raise the possibility that mitochondrial dysfunction may play a pa thologic role in dry 
AMD.  
 
4.1.3.  Age-Related Macular Degeneration Trigger Factors Causing Mitochondrial 
Dysfunction  
Cigarette smoke and hydroquinone, a potent toxicant in cigarette smoke, have been 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_737236], and in preclinical mo dels, both have been identified 
as biochemical triggers of RPE cellular injury related to dry AMD. Hydroquinone mediates RPE 
injury by [CONTACT_737272], producing mitochondrial dysfunction.15 Emerging 
evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction may also be associated with other established 
triggers of dry AMD. Abnormal lipid metabolism can alter fatty acid and cholesterol content of 
the mitochondrial inner membrane, compromising ETC function.16,17 Disruption of 
phagolysosomes (i.e., by [CONTACT_737273]) can promote accumulation of damaged 
mitochondria since normal phagolysosomal function is required for clearance of dysfunctional 
mitochondria (mitophagy).18,[ADDRESS_1007140] been suggested as a source of reactive oxidants in AMD ,21-25 
mitochondrial dysfunction is not oxidant overproduction alone; it also includes loss of ATP, 
calcium flux dysregulation, and other changes, which have been overlooked as pathogenic 
mechanisms in AMD. Preclinical studies  suggest that many AMD triggers induce mitochondrial 
dysfunction (decreased ATP, calcium flux dysregulation, loss of mitochondrial membrane 
potential [∆Ψ m], superoxide overproduction), leading to activation of specific signaling 
molecules (ASK1 → p38 MAPK → pHSP25, or pERK and pJNK), followed by [CONTACT_737274] (cytoskeleton disruption, actin aggregates, loss of ZO -1, 
blebbing, decreased MMP -14, decreased MMP -2, increased collagen IV, increased expression of 
vimentin), all of whi ch will precede and contribute to sub -RPE deposits (as degraded  blebs

contributing phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], cytosolic proteins and degraded organelles, collagen accumulation 
and vimentin accumulation). It is hypothesized that prevention or reversal of  mitochondrial 
dysfunction by [CONTACT_737275] -targeting molecules may prevent and perhaps reverse 
pre-existing deposit biochemistry at the RPE, restoring physiologic function of the RPE and 
promoting clearance of drusen deposits in dry AMD. In turn, mitochondria -targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_737237] -threatening AMD disease, neovascular AMD and GA.  
 
4.1.5.  Visual Dysfunction and Deficit in Low -Luminance Activities of Daily  Living  
It is often assumed, incorrectly, that patients with early AMD, characterized by [CONTACT_737276], are not visually impaired because they retain good high -contrast (best -corrected) visual 
acuity and activities of daily living (ADLs) in photopic (bright -light) conditions. However, many 
drusen patients manifest severely reduced LL vision, defined both as loss of visual function 
under LL conditions and poor scores on inventories of LL ADLs.26-29 For example, 50% of 
patients with large drusen demonstrate loss of > 10 letters of visual acuity when measured under 
LL conditions (reading black letters on dark gray background)30. Studies have also shown that 
drusen patie nts experience decreased foveal sensitivity to dim light and delayed dark 
adaptation.31,32 These deficits translate into impaired LL ADLs: loss of reading in imperfect 
lighting, reduced mobili ty in dimly lit areas, impaired night driving, increased sensitivity to 
glare, and reduced night -time socialization. Because parafoveal rods in AMD eyes with drusen 
can die,[ADDRESS_1007141] likely 
represent physiologic cone dysfunction rather than anatomic cone loss.  
 
4.1.6.  Low -Luminance Deficit – Photoreceptor Mitochondrial Dysfunction and 
Rationale for Mitochondria -targeted  Drugs  
Photoreceptor mitochondria may become susceptible to dysfunction in the setting of RPE injury 
and subRPE deposit formation, as a result of compromised RPE metabolism. ATP is crucial for 
outer segment membrane biogenesis and for transport of structural prote ins.34,35 Mitochondria 
also regulate local calcium flux. Accordingly, the ellipsoid has high mitochondria density. The 
presynaptic terminal also has high mitochondria density. This is not surprising: ATP is required 
for glutamate endocytosis  and vesicle localization, which is crucially related to the graded 
glutamate release for vision .36 Also, ATP is required to maintain calcium balance by  
[CONTACT_533950] -dependent ion pumps. Thus, photoreceptor mitochondrial dysfunction,  induced by  [CONTACT_737277], may contribute to LL 
acuity deficit because of deficient ATP and abnormal calcium flux regulation required for (a) 
outer segment function and (b) presynaptic ne urotransmitter vesicle dynamics. Therefore, 
mitochondria -targeted drugs that reverse mitochondrial dysfunction in retinal photoreceptors 
may improve visual function by [CONTACT_737278], impr oving LL acuity  deficit.

4.1.7.  Elamipretide – a Novel Mitochondria -targeted  Drug  
Elamipretide is a novel tetrapeptide drug that accumulates within mitochondria and facilitates 
restoration of normal mitochondrial function.37-39 Cardiolipin is a specialized phospholipid found 
in mitochondria that is a vital component of the inner mitochondrial membrane, maintaining the 
structural integrity of the ETC .40 In doing so, cardiolipin maintains the efficiency of the redox 
reactions essential for generating the transmembrane potential and proton -motive force for 
production of ATP. In the setting of excess oxidant generation, cardiolipin is susceptible to 
peroxidati on; peroxidized cardiolipin is ineffective at maintaining the structural integrity of the 
ETC. As a result, the ETC is much less efficient, accumulation of free electrons leads to a 
vicious cycle of oxidant generation, transmembrane potential is decreased,  ATP production 
diminishes, and calcium flux is perturbed. Elamipretide binds to peroxidized CL,[ADDRESS_1007142] an acceptable safety profile; sufficient data has been accumulated to 
support subcutaneous (SC) administration of up to 40 mg dosage of elamipretide.  
 
4.1.8.  Elamipretide in Preclinical Models of Dry Age -related Mitochondrial 
Degeneration  
In in vitro studies of RPE cell culture, elamipretide has been found to reverse mitochondrial 
dysfunction, and prevent activation of signaling cascades that activate biochemical mediators of 
deposit formation. Elamipretide has also been recently studied in 2 relevant mouse models of dry 
AMD: an acute model of subRPE deposit formation after repetitive exposure to periocular 
hydroquinone in young C57BL6J wild -type mice and a chronic model of subRPE deposit 
formation in aged (> 16 months) apolipoprotein E (APOE) 4 transge nic mice fed a high fat plus 
cholate diet. Both models are characterized by [CONTACT_737279], evidence of 
photoreceptor mitochondrial dysfunction, RPE cellular injury evident by [CONTACT_737280], loss of ZO -1 junctions, incr eased vimentin expression, basal cell  membrane 
blebbing, and decreased MMP -2 activity, all of which mediate formation of subRPE deposits 
Presence of deposits is also associated with RPE mitochondrial dysmorphology (i.e., 
vacuolization). The APOE4 mouse mod el is also characterized by [CONTACT_737281], which is evident by a diminished a -wave (photoreceptor activation) as well 
as diminished b -wave (photoreceptor – bipolar cell synapse) by [CONTACT_396554] (ERG). In 
both models, systemic (i.e., SC) daily treatment of mice with elamipretide reversed 
mitochondrial dysfunction, downregulated biochemical mediators, and promoted regression of 
subRPE deposits (unpublished preclinical data). Moreover, elamipretide treatment  reversed  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPI[CONTACT_162702] -[ADDRESS_1007143] observed reversal of established 
retinal dysfunction in the APOE4 transgenic mouse model.  
Taken together, the profound unmet need to identify a treatment for dry AMD, a disease without 
any known effective therapy, the strong rationale for mitochondrial -targeted drugs in dry AMD, 
the well -established mechanism of action and clinical safety profile for the novel tetrapetide drug 
elamipretide, and notably the profound beneficial effects of elamipretide treatment to reverse 
subRPE deposit formation and restore retinal function in mouse models of dry AMD, 
collectively provide compelling evidence to supp ort the clinical development of elamipretide for 
the treatment of patients with intermediate (early dry)  AMD.  
 
4.2. Elamipretide Risk/Benefit  Assessment  
4.2.1.  Potential Risks and  Benefits  
Major metabolites of elamipretide, M1 and M2, have been qualified in toxicology  studies in both 
rat and dog. M1 and M2 have been demonstrated to be pharmacologically inactive in a model of 
mitochondrial dysfunction in reperfusion injury where elamipretide demonstrates statistically 
significant reduction in damage.  
In previous clinica l studies of elamipretide, the most frequent treatment emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) reported are injection site reactions, headache, nausea, and eosinophilia, as reported in 
both placebo and elamipretide -treated groups. All TEAEs should be treated by [CONTACT_3433] e Principal 
Investigator (PI) per standard of care. Monthly lab collections will be used to monitor for signs 
of eosinophilia. Specifically, collection of blood for hematology, chemistry, Immunoglobulin E 
(IgE), and Interleukin 5 (IL5) testing and urine fo r urinalysis.  
In a preclinical fertility study, elamipretide, administered by [CONTACT_737282], through mating and implantation at doses of 2, 6, and 20 mg/kg, had no adverse 
effects on fertility in male and female rats. In a preclini cal gestational study, daily intravenous  
(IV) infusion of elamipretide to mated female rats and rabbits was associated with maternal 
toxicity characterized by [CONTACT_737283]. In rat s, the maternal no -observed -adverse -effect -level (NOAEL) was 
3 mg/kg/day, and the developmental NOAEL was 10 mg/kg/day. In rabbits, the  maternal  
NOAEL was 5 mg/kg/day, and the developmental NOAEL was 50 mg/kg/day. As a precaution 
against any potential reproductive risks, this study mandates pregnancy testing for women of 
childbearing potential and the use of effective contraception for all particip ants of childbearing 
potential or having partners with childbearing potential during trial participation. Subjects 
enrolled in the study will be required to follow the contraceptive restrictions described in  
Section 9.8.44.  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding are excluded from study participation. 
It is possible that this drug may cause harm to a fetus or embryo. Furthermore, the safety of 
receiving elamipretide during breastfeeding is not  known.

Elamipreti de was not associated with any end organ toxicity and all clinical findings were 
reversible. No significant toxicity was observed at 3 mg/kg/hour in rats and dogs, infused 
continuously for 12 hours with elamipretide or after 90 days dosing of elamipretide by [CONTACT_33265] (6mg/day in rat; 20 mg/day in dog).  
In animal studies, evidence of drug -induced histamine release syndrome was seen with 
cutaneous vasodilation, redness of the face, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_737238] s in plasma histamine. Mild and moderate histaminergic -like reactions 
occurred at elamipretide time to maximum plasma concentration (T max), where maximum plasma 
concentration (C max) was > 16,500 ng/mL in rat [30 mg/kg/day] and > 3500  ng/mL  
[10 mg/kg/day] i n dog and resolved spontaneously after approximately [ADDRESS_1007144] characterized in the cardiovascular dog study where minimal decreases in 
blood pressure and a reflex increase in heart rate and peripheral vasodilation were cl early 
associated with increases in plasma histamine at doses of elamipretide > 10 mg/kg/day. At SC 
doses > 300 mg/kg/day in the rat or > 40 mg/kg in the dog, convulsions were observed when 
Cmax plasma concentrations of elamipretide were approximately 200,0 00 ng/mL and 
approximately 60,000 ng/mL in the rat and dog, respectively.  
In human volunteers, [ADDRESS_1007145] assessed the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
elamipretide. At doses of up to 80 mg/day administered as a SC injection for up to [ADDRESS_1007146] experienced symptoms of histamine release. Plasma concentrations reached time to T max 
at approximately 0.75 hours postdose and mean C max at 80 mg/day on Day 7 was 1643 ng/mL. 
The daily dosage level for this study (40 mg) is below the dosage range utilized in these prior 
safety studies. Nonetheless, close monitoring of study subjects receiving elamipretide for clinical 
signs related to a histaminergic response, including local i njection site reactions, is warranted.  
Antihistamines should be considered if clinically significant histaminergic -like reactions occur.  
In rats, dose levels above 100 mg/kg/day were associated with metabolic acidosis, electrolyte 
loss, hypocalcaemia, and hypophosphatemia. In human subjects, early clinical data suggested a 
treatment -related lowering in serum sodium levels. Expansion of the clinical study population 
has not demonstrated hyponatremia; however, close monitoring of study subjects receiving 
elam ipretide for clinical and laboratory signs of hyponatremia will be conducted. Treatment for 
the condition is fluid restriction.  
Elamipretide and its [ADDRESS_1007147] higher exposure to the drug and its metabolites. A 
clinical study conducted in subjects with varying degrees of renal function (normal renal 
function and mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment) assessed the safety and PK of 
elamipretide and metab olites after IV administration of elamipretide (0.25 mg/kg/hour for  
1 hour) for 7 days. As expected, PK variables were impacted by [CONTACT_737284] a proportional 
manner; exposure (as the area under the plasma concentration -time curve from 0 to 24 hours 
[AUC 0-24h]) to elamipretide in the severe renal impairment group was approximately 2.3 times 
higher than in the normal renal function group, while C max was 1.08 times higher. Elamipretide,

Safety and tolerability of elamipretide was not affected by [CONTACT_254488]. Subjects with 
glomerular filtration rates < 30 mL/minute will be excluded from the study and anticipated 
plasma PK of the active compound or inactive metabolites are expected to re main within 
mandated toxicity margins.  
Generally, injection of SC elamipretide resulted in mild or moderate injection site reactions 
(ISRs), frequently characterized by [CONTACT_93489], induration, bruising, pruritus, pain, and/or 
urticaria. Injection site reacti ons were reported intermittently across multiple studies with 
elamipretide, with most subjects experiencing ISRs beginning upon first administration of 
elamipretide and continuing throughout treatment, with resolution of the ISRs typi[INVESTIGATOR_737239] y of last elamipretide administration. The resolution of ISRs, however, has occurred as late 
as [ADDRESS_1007148] -in-any-class treatment for patients with dry AMD, the 
overall risk benefit balance is therefore considered to be acceptable.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Safety Studies - Non-clinical  Studies  
Toxicology studies in rats and dogs showed that elamipretide has an acceptable profile that 
permits clinical investigations in humans for the proposed duration of the study.  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPI[CONTACT_162702] -[ADDRESS_1007149] been mediated by [CONTACT_224705] -like reactions. Effects were associated 
with maximum elamipretide C max and were rapi[INVESTIGATOR_737240]. Dose administration was not associated with any adverse 
effects on cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], or central nervous system function; off -target non -adverse 
effects were limited to a transient decrease of blood pressure and hear t rate, which is thought to 
be consistent with histaminergic -like reactions. In all studies, the severity of the effects was 
proportional to C max for elamipretide; thus, the safety margin is estimated based on C max, and not 
area under the plasma concentrat ion-time curve (AUC). The plasma elamipretide threshold 
concentration for clinically relevant adverse effects appears to be approximately 20,000 ng/mL 
in both rats and dogs, which is more than [ADDRESS_1007150] been performed. As a tetrapeptide, the immunogenic 
potential of the drug is expected to be low.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Human  Safety  
To date, [ADDRESS_1007151] been completed with parenteral elamipretide, including 14  clinical 
studies with the IV formulation and 3 studies with the SC formulation. In 11 clinical 
pharmacology trials completed, the primary objective was not to treat a disease state (9 trials 
with the IV formulation and 2 trials with the SC  formulation).  
Eight of the 11 clinical pharmacology trials evaluated single doses of IV or SC elamipretide, and 
three trials evaluated multiple doses of IV and SC elamipretide (SPIS C-101 and SPI[INVESTIGATOR_224680] -102 
evaluated both single and multiple dose SC elamipretide). Parenteral administration of 
elamipretide was assessed following single and multiple IV and SC doses in approximately 200 
healthy subjects in 11 completed clinical pharmacology s tudies. Single IV doses ranged from  
0.005 mg/kg/hour to 0.25 mg/kg/hr, typi[INVESTIGATOR_224675] 4 hours, while 0.25 mg/kg/hr 
administered over [ADDRESS_1007152] been identified with administration of IV or SC elamipretide for up to 
seven days. In these studies, the only systemic adverse event reported in over 5% of subjects was 
headache (7.3%).  Nausea and hyponatraemia were each reported in 3.0% of the subjects. All  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPI[CONTACT_162702] -101 Clinical Protocol Version 7.0, 20Jun17

other events were reported with incidence of <2.0%. The ma jority of TEAEs were assessed by 
[CONTACT_224706], resolved without sequelae and did not require 
intervention. There were no significant findings for group mean clinical laboratory, vital sign, 
ECG, or physical examination parameters  within or across trials.  
The SC formulation of elamipretide has been studied in both single - and multiple -dose trials in 
healthy volunteers and patient populations. Generally, injection of SC elamipretide resulted in 
mild or moderate injection site reacti ons, frequently characterized by [CONTACT_93489], induration, 
bruising, pruritus, pain, and/or urticaria. Injection site reactions were reported intermittently 
across dosing with elamipretide, with most subjects experiencing ISRs beginning upon first 
administrati on of elamipretide and continuing throughout treatment, with resolution of the ISRs 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_224676]. The resolution of ISRs, however, 
has occurred as late as [ADDRESS_1007153].  
In subjects with renal impairment, exposure, as measured by [CONTACT_12265], to elamipretide and both of 
its metabolites (M1 and M2) increased proportionally to the degree of renal impairment.  
However, there was no evidence of increased toxicity as a con sequence of impaired renal 
function. Similarly, in the Drug -Drug Interaction (DDI) studies carried out to date, co - 
administration of elamipretide with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], with clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], or with unfractionated heparin 
(UFH) did not indicate a change in the nature,  severity or frequency of AEs to the safety profile 
of either elamipretide or the comparator.  
Elamipretide, administered by [CONTACT_224707], was also assessed in completed studies in 
multiple patient populations including subjects with stable congestive heart failure (CHF), acute 
coronary syndrome (ACS) subjects who were undergoing primary percut aneous coronary 
intervention (PCI) and stenting for ST -segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), 
subjects with acute kidney injury (AKI) undergoing percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty 
(PTRA), subjects with genetically confirmed mitochondrial  disease with signs and symptoms of 
mitochondrial myopathy and/or exercise intolerance, and subjects over 60 years of age with 
evidence of skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction. Single and multiple IV and SC doses of 
elamipretide were assessed with gen erally no notable differences between the elamipretide and 
placebo arms in the frequency or severity of adverse events, except for ISRs with SC 
elamipretide administration. Additionally, eosinophilia was reported as an adverse event and 
laboratory data dem onstrated elevations (>0.45 cells x109/L) in eosinophils beginning at 
approximately [ADDRESS_1007154] to other clinical lab oratory results, physical 
examinations, vital signs, ECG data between the elamipretide and placebo. In general, the safety 
profile of systemic elamipretide was consistent with the pre -existing, comorbid medical 
conditions.  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPI[CONTACT_162702] -[ADDRESS_1007155] been no exposures during lactation, no overdoses, and no abuses or misuses reported.

• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SC injections of elamipretide in subjects with 
intermediate  AMD  
 
5.2. Secondary  Objectives

6. INVESTIGATIONA L PLAN  
6.1. Summary of Study  Design  
This is an open -label, Phase 1, single -center study in a total of approximately [ADDRESS_1007156] either: 1 eye with intermediate AMD - high-risk drusen without GA or 1 eye 
with intermediate AMD with noncentral G A. The study will thus include two predefined study 
disease cohorts: high -risk drusen cohort and noncentral GA cohort.  
The disease cohort high -risk drusen, is defined as presence of either at least 1 large (≥ 125 μm)  
druse or multiple medium -size (between 63 and 124 μm) drusen.  
The disease cohort noncentral GA, is defined as evidence of GA with cumulative area  
≥ 1.27 mm2 (approximately 0.5 disc area [DA]) by [CONTACT_737286] (FAF), which spares 
the fovea (defined as retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_737241] -OCT).  
Eligible subjects may have intermediate AMD with either high -risk drusen or noncentral GA in 
the study eye but without CNV AMD in the study eye. The fellow eye (not the study eye) is 
allowed to receive antiangiogenic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_737242], advanced 
central GA, or CNV AMD, and the fellow eye is allowed to receive antiangiogenetic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. .

Eligible subjects identified during the screening process will return for the Baseline (Day 0) visit, 
at which time they will be enr olled into the study and will begin receiving the 40 mg dose of 
elamipretide administrated subcutaneously once daily.  
Written informed consent will be obtained from all subjects before the Screening visit.  
The screening examination will be performed no mor e than 14 days before the Baseline visit.

of the retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_737243] 14 days of 
Day 0 and at every visit with the exception of Day 7, and at Early Termination (for subjects who 
withdraw early from the study).  
Fluorescein angiography (FA) will be used to examine the circulation of the retina and choroid 
using fluorescein dye and a specialized camera to trace the dye. Subjects will receive an IV 
inject ion of fluorescein dye in order to highlight the blood vessels in the back of the eye. During 
the procedure, subjects should be observed for any adverse reactions to the dye. FA will be 
obtained within [ADDRESS_1007171]’s reading difficulty and reading performance, a reading speed  test will be 
administered under standard lighting conditions and under low luminance conditions at Day 0, 
Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, Week 20, Week 24, Week 28, and at the Early 
Termination visit (for subjects who withdraw early from the study).

7.3. Discontinuation  
7.3.1.  Discontinuation of  Subje cts 
Subjects may be discontinued for the following reasons:  
• Investigator  decision  
o The Investigator decides that the subject should be discontinued from the study  for 
any reason.  
• Subject  decision  
o The subject requests to be withdrawn from the  study.  
o Subjects who withdraw should be explicitly asked about the contribution of 
possible AEs to their decision to withdraw consent, and any AE information 
elicited should be  documented.  
o Preferably the subject should withdraw consent in writing and, if the subje ct 
refuses or is physically unavailable, the site should document and sign the 
reason for the subject’s failure to withdraw consent in  writing.  
o The subject is lost to follow -up after a reasonable number of attempts to contact [CONTACT_1560] (including documen ted phone calls and/or emails, and a certified letter) have 
been  completed.  
• Sponsor  decision  
o The Sponsor or its designee stops the study or stops the subject’s participation in the 
study for medical, safety, regulatory, or other reasons consistent with applicable laws, 
regulations, and GCP  guidelines.  
• Adverse  event  
o If the Investigator decides that  the subject should be withdrawn because of an AE or 
because of a clinically significant laboratory value, the investigational product is to be 
discontinued and appropriate measures are to be taken. The Sponsor or its designee is 
to be alerted  immediately.  
Any subject withdrawing from the study will be asked to complete the Early Termination visit 
assessments (see Table 3 ).

Confidential and Proprietary  Page 41 of 88   
  
7.3.2.  Discontinuation of Study  Sites  
Study site (research center) participation may be discontinued if the Sponsor or its designee, the 
Investigator, or the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the study site judges it necessary for 
medical, safety, regulatory, or other reasons consistent with  applicable laws, regulations, and 
GCP guidelines.  
 
7.3.3.  Discontinuation of the  Study  
The study will be discontinued if the Sponsor or its designee judges it necessary for medical, 
safety, regulatory, or other reasons consistent with applicable laws, regulation s, and GCP 
guidelines.  
 
7.4. Replacement of  Subjects  
In order to ensure that a sufficient number of subjects are available for assessment of primary 
and secondary endpoints, subjects that are not able to be compliant, i.e. less than 80% 
compliance, with adminis tration of the IP will be replaced. Replacement of subjects will be 
assessed and confirmed on a case by [CONTACT_737294].  
 
7.5. Other Medications and  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
7.5.1.  Prohibited  Medications  
The use of any other investigational drug except elamipretide is proh ibited during the conduct of 
the current trial.  
Prohibited medications include:  
• Medications known to be toxic to the lens, retina, or optic nerve. Examples include 
deferoxamine, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil®), tamoxifen, phenothiazines, 
ethambutol, and  aminoglycosides.  
• Any ophthalmic topi[INVESTIGATOR_737247]. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_737248], 
including for ongoing / intermittent application of artificial tears / lubricating ointments 
for the treatment of mild ocular surfac e disease / dry  eye. 
• Systemic medications (prescription or non -prescription) for the treatment of ocular 
conditions may be used if deemed safe and appropriate by [CONTACT_737295].  
 
7.5.2.  Concomitant  Medications  
All medications, including over -the-counter treatments,  vitamins, or supplements, must have 
been unchanged and constant for at least 1 month before the Baseline (Day 0) visit. All 
concomitant medications will be recorded in the source data and the eCRF. Changes in dosages  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPI[CONTACT_162702] -[ADDRESS_1007179]’s abdomen (rotating clockwise around the four abdominal  quadrants) by a caregiver 
or the subject.  
Study drug injection will occur at the study site on Day 0. Subjects will be trained on the 
procedure for administration of study drug. The first dose may be given by a qualified member 
of the study team, by [CONTACT_941] s ubject, or caregiver at the PIs discretion, a designated, trained 
caregiver is also able to administer the study drug. The subject will be instructed to administer 
study drug on a daily basis at approximately the same time each day. The option of a visitin g 
nurse to oversee the study drug administration will be discussed with the subject and provided, as 
needed.  
 
8.2. Materials and  Supplies  
Study drug elamipretide will be dispensed, stored, and administered according to the Manual of 
Procedures. Subjects will be  provided with syringes and any other supplies necessary for 
injection.  
 
8.2.1.  Elamipretide  
Elamipretide drug product will be provided as a sterile solution for administration by [CONTACT_33265]. Each single -use vial is filled with [ADDRESS_1007180] containing t he equivalent of 
40 mg elamipretide (added as MTP -131 acetate) in an isotonic, unpreserved, clear, colorless 
solution.  
Elamipretide should be store in the refrigerator at a temperature of 2 to 8°C or 35.6 to 46.6°F.  
A Manual of Procedures will be provided to the study center sites detailing dispensing directions, 
training materials for subjects, and Subject Diary. IP accountability will be documented in the 
study EDC system.  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPI[CONTACT_162702] -[ADDRESS_1007181] be able to 
account for all used and unused vials of study drug. These records should contain the dates, 
quantity, and study drug:  
• Received at  site 
• Dispensed to each  subject,  
• Returned from each subject,  and 
• Disposed of at the site or returned to the Sponsor or  designee  
The clinical monitor responsible for the study site will provide written approval for the 
destruction or return of used and unused study drug vials fol lowing reconciliation of all clinical 
supplies.  
 
8.4. Study Drug  Compliance  
During the Study Treatment Period, study drug will be administered by [CONTACT_32596]. 
Subjects will be instructed to return all used and unused vials of study drug to the clinic at each 
visit.  
 
8.5. Method of Assigning Study  Drug  
At Day 0, after eligibility criteria have been confirmed, a treatment cohort will be assigned to 
each subject. This is an open label non -comparative study and not randomized.  
Subjects will be dispensed study drug at each study site visit. Each kit will be labeled with 
information including the following:  
• Protocol  number  
• Sponsor  name  
• Storage  conditions  
• Directions for  use 
• Investigational caution  statement  
 
8.6. Rationale for Dose  Selection  
The dose and route of administration (i.e., 40 mg in 1.0 mL by [CONTACT_10530] ) for the current study 
has previously been tested in a clinical trial involving healthy subjects. The dose for the current 
study was chosen based on the systemic exposure profile, as well as the safety observed in 
previous clinical trials.  
The plasma elam ipretide threshold concentration for clinically relevant adverse effects appears to 
be approximately 20,000 ng/mL in both rats and dogs, which is more than 10 -fold higher than  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPI[CONTACT_162702] -101 Clinical Protocol Version 7.0, 20 Jun17  
Confidential and Proprietary  Page 44 of 88   
  
the maximum anticipated human exposures for the selected dosage in this study. In healthy 
human adults, systemic exposure (in terms of mean AUC 0-24 on Day 7) to elamipretide after 
repeat SC injection at 40 mg in 1 mL was 3810 ng.hour/mL, while mean C max on Day 7 was 
1320 ng/mL. No accumulation of elamipretide was seen after repeat dosing for 7 consecutive 
days. Neither metabolite of elamipretide (M1 and M2) is active or implicated in toxicology.  
In a completed Phase 1 trial (SPI[INVESTIGATOR_224680] -101), elamipretide given s ubcutaneously to healthy subjects 
at doses up to [ADDRESS_1007182]  
Elamipretide will not be made available to subjects at the conclusion of their participation in the 
study.  
 
9. EFFICACY, SAFETY EVALUA TIONS, SAMPLE COLLECTION 
AND TESTING, AND APPROPRIATENESS OF  MEASURES  
9.1. Primary Safety  Measures  
The primary safety and tolerability endpoints for the study are:  
• The incidence and severity of  AEs 
• Changes from baseline in vital sign  measurements  
• Changes from baseline in  ECGs  
• Changes from baseline in clinical  evaluations  
• Changes from baseline in clinical laboratory  evaluations  
The safety profile of elamipretide will be assessed through the recording, reporting, and 
analyzing of AEs, clinical evaluations, and laboratory tests.  
 
9.2. Secondary Efficacy  Measures  
Secondary efficacy measures include:  
Both Noncentral GA and High risk druse n without GA:  
• Compliance of administration of SC  elamipretide  
• Number of home health visits for subject or caregiver to learn how to inject  elamipretide  
• Change in fundus  hyperautofluorescence  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPI[CONTACT_162702] -101 Clinical Protocol Version 7.0, 20 Jun17

• Change from baseline in LL visual  acuity  
• Change from baseline in mesopic light sensitivity by  [CONTACT_486690]  
• Change in dark  adaptometry  
• Change in drusen volume (“RPE – drusen complex”, as measured by  [CONTACT_737296]) by  [CONTACT_66309]-OCT  
• 
• Change in  BCVA  
• Change in reading speed at standard  light 
• Change in reading speed at low  light 
• Change in LL visual function by [CONTACT_737297]  
• Change in NEI VFQ -39 score  
• Change in fundus  photography  
High Risk Drusen Without GA:  
• Change in drusen volume (“RPE – drusen complex”, as measured by  [CONTACT_737296]) by  [CONTACT_66309]-OCT  
 
9.3. Safety  Evaluations  
Investigators are responsible for monitoring the safety of subjects who have entered this study 
and for alerting Sponsor or its designee t o any event that seems unusual, even if this event may 
be considered an unanticipated benefit to the subject.  
The Investigator is responsible for facilitating the appropriate medical care of subjects during the 
study, in the event of adverse event (AE).  
The Investigator remains responsible for following, through an appropriate health care option, of 
AEs that are serious, considered related to the study drug or the study, or that caused the subject 
to discontinue before completing the study. The subject shou ld be followed until the event is 
resolved or explained.  
Comprehensive assessment of any apparent toxicity experienced by [CONTACT_737298], from the date of the subject’s signature [CONTACT_86220]. Stu dy site personnel will report any AE, whether observed by [CONTACT_737299]. The reporting period for AEs is described in Section 9.8.2 . 
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPI[CONTACT_162702] -[ADDRESS_1007183] (IMP), regardless of causal relationship.  
Adverse Events may include the following:  
• Suspected adverse drug reactions: side effects known or suspected to be caused by [CONTACT_737300].  
• Other medical experiences, regardless of their relationship with the study drug, such as 
injury, surgery, accidents, extensions of symptoms or apparently unrelated illnesses, and 
significant abnormalities in clinical laboratory values, psychological testin g, or physical 
examination  findings.  
• Events occurring as a result of protocol interventions (pre - or post -IMP administration)  
• Reactions from study drug overdose, abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity, or toxicity. The 
Sponsor has standards for reporting AEs that are to be followed regardless of  applicable 
regulatory requirements that may be less  stringent.  
 
9.4. Pre-study Drug  Events  
Untoward events and/or incidental diagnoses that occur prior to study drug administration are by 
[CONTACT_108], unrelated to the study drug.  Pre-study drug events or incidental diagnoses will be 
recorded on the past medical history eCRF. However, if a pre -study drug event is assessed by [CONTACT_737301] a study procedure and/or meets seriousness criteria, it will be recorded 
as an AE on the AE eCRF and followed as per protocol guidelines noted in Section 9.[ADDRESS_1007184]/investigation, that worsen in 
severity or frequency during the study will be recorded and reported as AEs.  
 
9.6. Abnormal Laboratory and Other Abnormal Investigational  Findings  
Abnormal laboratory findings and other objective measurements should NOT be routinely 
captured and reported as AEs. However, abnormal laboratory findings or other objective 
measurements should be reported on the AE pages of the eCRF that:  
• Meet the criteria for a  SAE  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPI[CONTACT_162702] -101 Clinical Protocol Version 7.0, 20 Jun17  
Confidential and Proprietary  Page 47 of 88   
  
• Result in discontinuation of the  IMP 
• Require medical intervention  or 
• Are judged by [CONTACT_737302] a n abnormal laboratory finding on the AE pages of the eCRF, a  clinical  
diagnosis should be recorded rather than the abnormal value itself (for example, “anemia” rather 
than “decreased red blood cell count” or “hemoglobin = 10.5 g/dL”.)  
 
9.7. Serious Adverse  Events  
An SAE is any AE from this study that:  
• Results in death. In case of a death, the cause of death is used as the AE term, and the 
fatality is considered as the  OUTCOME.  
• Is life threatening. The term “life threatening” refers to a SAE in which the subject is  at 
risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer  to an event that hypothetically 
might cause death if it were more  severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10909].  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or  incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth  defec t 
• Is otherwise considered medically  important.  
Important medical events may be considered as SAEs when, based upon medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in th is definition.  
Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or dr ug abuse.  
For the purposes of reporting, any suspected transmission of an infectious agent via an IMP is 
also considered a SAE and all such cases should be reported in an expedited manner as described 
in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
 
9.7.1.  Events that Do Not Meet the Definition of a Serious Adverse  Event  
Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8609]. However, all events leading to unplanned 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (not documented prior to ICF signing) or unplanned prolongation of an elec tive 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (e.g., undesirable effects of any administered medication) must be documented 
and reported as SAEs.  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPI[CONTACT_162702] -101 Clinical Protocol Version 7.0, 20 Jun17  
Confidential and Proprietary  Page 48 of 88   
  
9.8. Recording of Adverse  Events  
Complete, accurate, and consistent data on all AEs experienced for the duration of the repor ting 
period (defined in Section 9.8.2 ) will be recorded on an ongoing basis in the appropriate section 
of the eCRF. Among these AEs, all SAEs must be additionally documented and reported using 
the study specific SAE Report Fo rm. 
It is important that each AE report include a description of the event along with the duration 
(onset and resolution dates), severity, relationship to study drug, potential causal factors, 
treatment given or other action taken (including dose modificat ion or discontinuation of the 
IMP), and the outcome.  
As the quality and precision of acquired AE data are critical, Investigators should use the AE 
definitions provided and should observe the following guidelines when completing the AE pages 
of the eCRF:  
Whenever possible, recognized medical terms should be used to describe AEs rather than lay 
terms (for example, “influenza” rather than “flu”), and abbreviations should be avoided.  
Adverse events should be described using a specific clinical diagnosis, if a vailable, rather than a 
list of signs or symptoms (for example, “congestive heart failure” rather than “dyspnea, rales, 
and cyanosis”). However, signs and symptoms that are not associated with an identified disease 
or syndrome, or for which an overall diag nosis is not yet available, should be reported as 
individual AEs.  
Provisional diagnoses (e.g., “suspected myocardial infarction”) are acceptable, but should be 
followed up with a definitive diagnosis if later available. Similarly, a fatal event with an 
unknown cause should be recorded as “death of unknown cause.”  
In cases of surgical or diagnostic procedures, the condition or illness leading to the procedure is 
considered the AE rather than the procedure itself.  
Adverse events occurring secondary to other events (e.g., sequelae or complications) should be 
identifie d by [CONTACT_86187]. A primary AE, if clearly identifiable, generally represents the 
most accurate clinical term to record in the eCRF.  
 
9.8.1.  Investigator  Assessments  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Severity/Intensity  
Investigators must assess the severity/intensity of AEs according to th e following qualitative 
toxicity scale:  
 
Mild:  The subject is aware of the event or symptom, but the event or symptom  is easily 
tolerated.  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPI[CONTACT_162702] -101 Clinical Protocol Version 7.0, 20 Jun17  
Confidential and Proprietary  Page 49 of 88   
  
Moderate:  The subject experiences sufficient discomfort to interfere with or reduce  his or 
her usual l evel of  activity.  
Severe:  Significant impairment of functioning: the subject is unable to carry  out usual 
activities.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Relationship to the Investigational Medicinal Product  (IMP)  
Investigators must systematically assess the causal relationship of AEs to the study drug using 
the following definitions (the decisive factor being the temporal relationship between the AE and 
administration of the study drug):  
Probable:  A causal relation ship is clinically/biologically highly plausible, there  is a 
plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and administration of the study 
drug, and there is a reasonable response on  withdrawal.  
Possible:  A causal relationship is clinically/biologically plausible and there is  a plausible 
time sequence between onset of the AE and administration of the study  drug.  
Unlikely:  A causal relationship is improbable and another documented cause of the  AE is 
most  plausible.  
Unrelated:  A causal relationship can be excluded and another documented cause of  the AE 
is most  plausible.  
 
9.8.2.  Adverse Event Reporting  Period  
The AE reporting period begins when the subject signs the ICF and continues through the 
clinical study’s post study drug follow -up period, defined as 28 (± 7 days) days after last 
administration of study drug.  
Note that AEs that occur between the time subj ect signs the ICF and the time the subject is  dosed 
with study drug will be summarized in the medical history eCRF and not as an AE unless the 
event meets the definition of a SAE. All AEs which occur following first administration of study 
drug either new events or events that were pre -existing but changed in frequency or severity will 
be recorded on the AE CRF page until the last subject visit required by [CONTACT_760]. A last batch 
of queries will be sent after last study visit if remaining ongoing/unknown  outcomes of reported 
AEs are pending. After the last batch of queries has been resolved, the CRFs and database will 
no longer be updated and the data considered final. However, SAEs and ongoing/unknown 
outcome AEs will be followed -up until resolution or s tabilization by [CONTACT_737303]. Beyond this defined reporting period, any new SAE considered 
causally related to study drug should be immediately reported to the sponsor using the SAE 
report form provided.  Additional SAE informa tion obtained after database lock will reside 
solely in the safety  database.  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPI[CONTACT_162702] -[ADDRESS_1007185] -to follow -up, ongoing/unknown outcome AEs will not be 
followed -up. 
For screening failure subjects, new AEs and updates must be recorded in the CRFs until the date 
the subject was determined to be a screen failure. Beyon d that date, only SAEs and medically 
relevant AEs will be followed -up by [CONTACT_1034]’s Pharmacovigilance group and all data will be 
housed within the safety database.  
 
9.8.3.  Serious Adverse Event Expedited  Reporting  
In the event a SAE occurs during the reporting  period, the Investigator must immediately  (within 
a maximum of 24 hours after becoming aware of the event) inform the Sponsor as detailed in the 
Clinical Trial Pharmacovigilance Procedural  Manual.  
For any SAE, the following minimum information is required  as initial notification:  
• Investigator/Reporter with full contact  [CONTACT_3031]  
• Subject identification details (study number, site number, subject  number)  
• Study drug administration details (dose and  dates)  
• Event verbatim terms, a brief description of signs/symptoms/diagnosis and the date  of 
onset  
• Seriousness criteria(ion)  met 
• Relationship of the event to the study drug (e.g., the causality according to the 
Investigator)  
Reporting procedures and timelines are the same for any new follow -up information on a 
previously reported SAE.  
All SAE reports must be completed as described i n the eCRF completion guidelines and 
submitted through the electronic data capture system of the clinical database. Other relevant 
information from the clinical database (including demographic data, medical history, 
concomitant drug and study drug dosing i nformation) will automatically be sent via the 
electronic data capture system when the SAE form is submitted.  
The names, addresses, telephone and fax numbers for SAE back -up reporting (paper), are 
included in the Safety Reporting Plan.  
The Investigator/Rep orter must respond to any request for follow -up information (e.g., additional 
information, outcome and final evaluation, specific records where needed) or to any question the 
Sponsor may have on the AE within the same timelines as described for initial rep orts. This is 
necessary to permit a prompt assessment of the event by [CONTACT_1052] (as applicable) to allow  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPI[CONTACT_162702] -[ADDRESS_1007186] dose of study drug:  
• Abstinence, when it is in line with the preferr ed and usual lifestyle of the subject. Subject 
agrees to use an acceptable method of contraception should they become sexually  active.  
• Maintenance of a monogamous relationship with a male partner who has been surgically 
sterilized by [CONTACT_43406] (the vasecto my procedure must have been conducted at  least 
60 days before the Screening visit or confirmed via sperm analysis).  
• Barrier method (e.g., condom or occlusive cap) with spermicidal  foam/gel/film/cream 
AND either hormonal contraception (oral, implanted, or i njectable) or an intrauterine 
device or  system.  
Non-childbearing potential is defined as surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral oophorectomy, 
hysterectomy, or tubal ligation) or postmenopausal (defined as permanent cessation of 
menstruation for at least 1 2 consecutive months prior to the Screening visit).  
For male subjects with female partners of child -bearing potential, highly effective methods of 
contraception must be adhered to from the date of informed consent and for at least 3 months 
(i.e. 90 days) a fter last dose of study drug. Highly effective methods of contraception are defined 
as the usage by [CONTACT_224719] -uterine device 
(which should be established prior to the start of the study) plus usage by  [CONTACT_737304] -containing barrier method of contraception. Male subjects with 
pregnant partners must use a condom with spermicide from the start of study drug until at least [ADDRESS_1007187] dose of study drug. Sper m or egg donation by [CONTACT_737305] 3 months after the study drug was  administered.  
Only pregnancies considered by [CONTACT_331590] (e.g., resulting from an 
interaction between study drug and a contraceptive drug) are considered AEs unto themselves. 
However, all pregnancies with an estimated conception date that o ccurred during the AE 
reporting period, as defined in Section 9.8.[ADDRESS_1007188] actively follow up, documen t, and 
report on the outcome of all pregnancies.  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPI[CONTACT_162702] -[ADDRESS_1007189] be  reported in an expedited manner as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , while normal outcomes 
must be reported within [ADDRESS_1007190] of the study, or alter the 
IRB’s approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_43932]. In particular, and in line with respective 
regulations, the Sponsor will inform the Investigator of AEs that are both serious and  unexpected 
and are considered to be related to the administered product (suspected unexpected s erious 
adverse reaction [S[LOCATION_003]Rs]). The Investigator should place copi[INVESTIGATOR_737249]. 
When specifically required by [CONTACT_43973], the Sponsor will provide appropriate 
safety reports to the CRO for distri bution to the site and will maintain records of these 
notifications. The Investigator will be responsible for promptly notifying the concerned 
independent IRB of any safety reports provided by [CONTACT_737306][INVESTIGATOR_737250].  
 
9.9. Appropriateness of  Measurements

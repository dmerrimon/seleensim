The Finetech -Brindley SARS system is an FDA -approved device (Humanitarian Use Device) 
and we have received an IDE for testing this device at [ADDRESS_1280152] 600 Hz stimulation to determine whether 
this results in reduced sphincter contraction (Aim 1). The Finetech -Brindley device can also 
be programmed to achieve bowel emptying and  return of bowel control is an extremely high 
priority for individuals with SCI [7]. Therefore, we will leverage the opportunity of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_911354] 600 Hz sacral root stimulation also has the potential to improve bowel 
emptying by [CONTACT_911362] ( Aim 2).  Participants will be asked to participate 
in experiments for both Aim 1 and Aim 2. Study participants who are Veterans will be 
consented and tested at the Cleveland VA Medical Center. Participants who are not Veterans 
will be consented and tested at the MetroHealth Medical Center. An IRB protocol for this 
study has already been approved at the MetroHealth Medical Center.

• Number of potential participating sites : [ADDRESS_1280154] injury (SCI) leads to neurogenic bladder dysfunctions, and often includes 
difficulty  with emptying the bladder due to detrusor -sphincter dyssynergia (DSD). 
Current bladder  management  strategies include catheterization, pharmaceuticals, 
and/or surgery, but these interventions insufficiently meet  individuals’ needs. The 
neurogenic bladder can be emptied using sacral anterior root stimulation (SARS) with  
electrodes implanted on the sacral nerves to produce bladder contractions. However, 
this emptying can be  impeded by [CONTACT_911363]. The 
sacral sensory roots are typi[INVESTIGATOR_911356]  (rhizotomy) to reduce these reflex 
contractions, but this rhizotomy also impairs desirable reflexes ( e.g., sexual  function) 
and sacral sensation if present. Experiments in animals have shown that sacral root 
stimulation at  [ADDRESS_1280155] the potential effectiveness of 600 Hz sacral root 
stimulation to limit urethral sphincter activity in individuals with neurogenic bladder 
dysfunction  (Aim 1) . We hypothesize that sacral root stimulation at [ADDRESS_1280156] if this 
stimulation similarly limits anal sphincter activity (Aim 2). Individuals will already have 
received an implanted SARS device and will have also received a rhizotomy.

with SCI – restoration of bladder function - and help to address some of the 
biggest costs and health risks associated with managing neurogenic bladder by 
[CONTACT_911364]. There is a 
high potential for clinical translation because this approach takes advantage of 
existing technologies.  
 
If this project demonstrates evidence of urethral sphincter pressure reduction in 
response to [ADDRESS_1280159], we plan to achieve efficient, catheter -free, on -demand bladder emptying 
using sacral root stimulation without the need for a posterior rhizotomy.

5.[ADDRESS_1280165] clinical urodynamics methods for data collection. We will 
use a n FDA -approved  modified external  controller to communicate with the 
already -implanted components of the system, so no new surgeries or other  
procedures are required. The device has been modified to achieve frequencies 
up to 600 Hz and this modification was approved by [CONTACT_911366]. We will 
document their normal daily usage device settings for reference, including  
stimulation amplitude, pulse width, frequency, and on/off cycle duration.  
 
Clinical Urodynamics and Anorectal Manometry Procedure : A standard catheter 
will be inserted into the  bladder via the urethra and the bladder will be emptied. 
This catheter will be removed and then a second  catheter, which can measure 
bladder and urethral pressures , will be  inserted. This catheter will also have a 
lumen for filling the bladder with sterile saline. A balloon  catheter inserted in the 
rectum will be used to reflect abdominal pressure and distinguish bladder 
pressures  due to detrusor contraction versus bladder pressures due to 
abdominal activity. This balloon catheter will  measure rectal pressure. It will also 
have pressure transducers at the anal sphincter to measure anal sphincter  
pressure. Surface electromyogram (EMG) electrodes will be applied to the anal 
sphincter to monitor pelvic floor  muscle contractions. Infused volumes will be 
controlled via an infusion pump. EMG and pressure signals will  be monitored on 
a clinical urodynamic system. The participant’s bladder will be infused with  sterile  
saline while  measuring bladder, urethral sphincter, and rectal pressures.   
 
Sacral Anterior Root Stimulation : We will set the stimulation parameters for the 
implanted stimulator, including  stimulation amplitude and frequency, using a 
modified Finetech -Brindley external controller unit. The frequency  will be set 
either to 600 Hz or to the low  frequency that the participant typi[INVESTIGATOR_911357], which  is usually 20 Hz. We will use the  participant’s own 
power transmission  coil. The receiver coil and electrodes  will already have been 
implanted. The  pulse width will not be changed from  the participant’s normal 
setting.  
 
Aim 1: Determine if [ADDRESS_1280166] administer SARS using  the 
stimulation parameters ( i.e., frequency, pulse width, and amplitude)  that the 
study participant typi[INVESTIGATOR_911358]. 
The purpose is to characterize the usual level of urethral sphincter and bladder 
pressure during their bladder emptying routines and collect these baseline data. 
[Protocol V 2 Feb2023 ]  VAIRRS  Protocol Template – version 10/15/[ADDRESS_1280167] evoke a brief 
(~1-2 second) onset respond and then the urethral pressure is expected to return 
to baseline. The stimulation amplitude will be set to [ADDRESS_1280168] between stimuli. Once this recruitment curve is established, we will 
repeat stimulation at threshold, 50% maximal recruitment, and 90% maximal 
recruitment for up to 30 seconds to measure reduction of urethral sphincter 
pressures.  
 
Aim 2: Determine if [ADDRESS_1280169] between stimuli. Once this recruitment curve is established, we will 
repeat stimulation at threshold, 50% maximal recruitment, and 90% maximal 
recruitment for up to 30 seconds to measure reduction of anal sphincter 
pressures.  
 
 
[Protocol V 2 Feb2023 ]  VAIRRS  Protocol Template – version 10/15/[ADDRESS_1280170] tested kilohertz frequency sinusoidal 
waveforms extensively preclinically to block nerve  
conduction. This could be another alternative to the rhizotomy, but it would 
require development and regulatory  approval of a new implantable stimulation 
system that can safely deliver stimulation in the kilohertz frequency  range for 
human testing [14] – [18]. 
 
We do not expect to experience significant technical challenges because (1) we 
are using a SARS system  that study participants have been successfully using 
for years and (2) we are using research methods that we  have successfully used 
for years to collect these data [19], [20]. We may find that the external controller 
does  not deliver sufficient charge to achieve sphincter reduction at elevated 
stimulation frequencies. This is unlikely  because the amplitude required to avoid 
contraction at 600Hz frequencies is not significantly higher than the amplitude to 
achieve activation at lower amplitudes.  
 
5.7 Withdrawal of Subjects  
There may be instances that would require investigators to terminate a 
participant’s participation in this study. Investigators will stop the experiment if the 
participant demonstrate s any unresolved physical or psychological discomfort.  
 
6.0 Risks   
 
Tissue Damage  – rare. There is a small risk that the neural tissue may be 
damaged by [CONTACT_911367]. This risk will be minimized 
by [CONTACT_911368].  
 
Urinary tract infection : This risk is uncommon. There is a risk of less than 10% 
that a subject  will develop a urinary tract infection (UTI) following urodynamics in 
this study. This risk will be minimized by [CONTACT_911369] 
[Protocol V 2 Feb2023 ]  VAIRRS  Protocol Template – version 10/15/[ADDRESS_1280171] experience s signs or symptoms of a UTI (such as blood 
in the urine, frequency, urgency, increased spasms, fever, chills, and/or pain in 
the lower back) after the study, please contact a member of the study team. 
Subjects  will be advised on how to proceed for medical treatment.  
 
Urethral trauma : This risk is uncommon. There is a small risk, which we estimate 
at approximately 2%, that a subject will experience mild trauma to the urethra as 
a result of catheterization for this study. Such trauma might result in a small 
amount of bleeding from the surface of the urethra, similar to that seen from the 
gums on vigorous tooth -brushing. This risk will be minimized by [CONTACT_911370] -soluble gel and by [CONTACT_911371].  
 
Discomfort during urodynamic testing : Subjects  may experience some discomfort 
from lying down for up to four hours at a time during these procedures. If so, the 
investigators will assist subjects  in changing position to become more 
comfortable. The investigators will assist subjects  in changing position at least 
every [ADDRESS_1280172] that long, to reduce the risk of pressure 
injuries .

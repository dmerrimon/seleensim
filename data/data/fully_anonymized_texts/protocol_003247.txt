This statistical analysis plan (SAP) contains definitions of the analysis population(s), derived 
variables and statistical methods for Study  54767414 L UC2001.
1.1. Trial Objectives
Primary Objective
The primary objective of this study is to compare theoverall response rate(ORR) in subjects 
treated with daratumumab in combination with atezolizumab versus atezolizumab alone.
Secondary Objectives
To assess the safet y of the combination of daratumumab and atezolizumab
To compare the duration of response (DoR) in subjects treated with daratumumab in
combination with atezolizumab versus atezolizumab alone
To compare the clinical benefit rate (CBR) in subjects treated with daratumumab in
combination with atezolizumab versus a tezolizumab alone
To compare progression- free survival (PFS) in subjects treated with daratumumab in
combination with atezolizumab versus atezolizumab alone
To compare overall survival (OS) in subjects treated with daratumumab in combination with      
atezolizumab versus atezolizumab alone
To evaluate the pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity  profile of daratumumab when given       
in combination with atezolizumab
To evaluate the pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity  profile of atezolizumab when given in      
combination with daratumumab
Exploratory Objectives
To compare ORR evaluated by [CONTACT_596219] -Related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors (irR ECIST)
To explore biomarkers predictive of response to therap y
To evaluate potential pharmacod ynamic bioma rkers in response to therap y
To explore the relationships between pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, adverse event
profiles, and clinical activity  of daratumumab given in combination with atezolizumab in
subjects with previously  treated advanced or metast atic NSCL C
To explore the benefit of daratumumab and atezolizumab treatment in subjects who had 
confirmed disease progression on atezolizumab monotherapy
1.2. Trial Design
The study  begins with a 6-subject safety  run-in cohort to be evaluated by [CONTACT_596220] (SET). After evaluation, if SET has determined that the combination therap y of 
daratumumab and atezolizumab are safe and tolerable, the study  will proceed to the 
randomization phase in which [ADDRESS_787198] sare randomized into the two treatment arms

squamous), and number ofprevious lines of therapy received (1or>1): 
Arm A: atezolizumab; Arm B: atezolizumab + daratumum ab.
Subjects in Arm A (treated with atezolizumab monotherapy ) who have confirmed disease 
progression based on RECI ST 1.1 may cross over to Arm B and receive daratumumab and 
atezolizumab after crossover eligibility  criteria are met.
An internal Janssen Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), independent of the study  team, will be 
established to review the efficacy  and safet y data in the randomization phase. The DMC will 
review the totality  of data after approximately  40, 60, and [ADDRESS_787199] 
additional ad -hoc reviews as data accumulate.
For subjects in Arm A, Atezolizumab will beadministered at1200 mg I V on Day 1 of every 
21-day cycle.For subjects in the safet y run-in cohort and in Arm B,Daratumumab will b e
administered intravenous ly(IV)at16 mg/kg week ly on Days 1, 8,and15, forthefirst [ADDRESS_787200]-infusion medication isadministered toreduce therisk
ofdelay edinfusion reactions in all subj ects.
The combination therap y and the monotherap y will continue until treatment discontinuation due 
to disease progression, unacceptable toxicity , or other protocol -defined treatment discontinuation    
criteria. Subjects enter the Follow -up phase after the End- of-Treatment visit, or 30 (+7) days 
after the discontinuation of the study  drugs. Subjects will be followed for survival every  [ADDRESS_787201] hasbeen enrolled
(last subject in)orwhen thelastsubject hasthelastassessment inthisstudy (eg, lastsurvival
follow- up forthelastsubject), whichever occurs first, and the study  may be extended to allow 
for further treatment and follow -up of subjects.

1.3. Statistical Hy pothesis for the Primary  Objective
Theprimary  hypothesis isthat the combination therap y ofatezolizumab with daratumumab will 
significantl y improve ORR compared to atezolizumab monotherapy  in subjects with NSC LC.
1.4. Sample Size Determination
A 6-subject safet y run-in cohort will be evaluated by [CONTACT_301186] y Evaluation Team to determine 
the safet y and tolerability  of atezolizumab administered incombination with daratumumab 
before proceeding with the randomized phase of the study .
For the randomization part, assuming that the ORR for atezolizumab monotherap y is 
approximately 20%, and the addition of daratumumab would improve ORR by 20% to 40%, [ADDRESS_787202] s need to be randomized with a 1:1ratio in order to achieve 80% power to detect this 
difference with a one-sided alpha of 0.10. If benefit from the combination is not observed across 
the overall study  population, targeted enrollment of subgroups, based on tumor PD-L1 
expression level, may be implemented , based on DMC recommendations. As such, 
approximately  50 additional subjects in the TC2/TC3 subgroups may be enrolled to preliminarily 
evaluate the treatment effect. If the ORR is 25% for atezolizumab monotherap y and 50% for the

90% CI for the difference in ORR would exclude 0 (i.e., a positive signal in favor of the 
combination).
1.5. Randomization and Blinding
Central randomization will be implemented following the   safety  run-in evaluation. Subjects will 
be randoml y assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms based on a computer -generated randomization 
schedule prepared before the study by [CONTACT_43754]. The 
randomization will be balanced by [CONTACT_596221] y determined PD-L1 expression status (TC0 and IC0 vs. others), histology  (squamous vs. 
non-squamous), a nd number of prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (1 vs >1).

Duration of response (DoR)is measured from date of first documented disease response todate 
of first objectivel y documented evidence of recurrence orprogressive disease or death , 
whichever occurred first. DoR will be evaluated insubjects who have achieve dresponse of PR 
or better . Duration of response is calculated in months as follows: 
DoR= (date of PD or censoring – date of first disease response + 1) / (365.25/12),
Deaths due to disease progression will be treated as an even t on the date of death, unless disease 
progression is documented before death. Subjects who start Subsequent anti-cancer treatment for 
NSCL Cwill be censored at the last disease assessment no later than the start of Subsequent anti-
cancer treatment s Subjects, who are lost to follow -up, withdraw consent, withdraw from study  
without disease progression, or die due to causes other than disease progression will be censored 
at the last disease assessment date.

Definition
Progression- free survival (PFS) is measured from randomization until the first documented
disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. PFS will be censored on the date of last 
tumor assessment documenting absence of tumor progression for subjects who have no 
documented progression and are still alive prior to data cutoff, dropout, lost to follow -upor the 
initiation ofSubsequent anti-cancer treatment . Subjects with no tumor assessments after 
randomization their PFS will be censored on the date of randomization.  PFS is calculated in 
months as follows: 
PFS = (date of PD/death or censoring – date of randomization + 1) / (365.25/12).
Analysis Methods
The number and percentage of subjects who had a PFS event or were censored will be reported. 
The Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the distribution of overall PFS for each 
treatment group, and the median PFS with 95% CI will be provided. In addition, the Kapla n-
Meier PFS curve will also be presented b y treatment group. 
Hazard ratio (Arm B vs. Arm A) and its 95% confidence interval will be presented. In addition,

be censored on the date the subjects were last known to be alive. Overall survival is calculated in 
months as follows: 
OS = ( date of death or censoring – date of randomization + 1) / (365.25/12).
Analysis Methods
The number and percentage of subjects who were died or still alive will be reported. The Kaplan-
Meier method will be used to estimate the distribution of OSfor each treatment group, and the 
median OSwith 95% CI will be provided. In addition, the Kaplan -Meier PFS curve will also be 
presented b y treatment group. 
Hazard ratio (Arm B vs. Arm A) and its 95% confidence interval will be presented. In addition, 
3, 6, 12 -months of OSrate with 95% CI  will be estimated by  [CONTACT_5263]-Meier method and reported 
for each treatment group.

 _____________________________________________________________________________________________  9 PROTOCOL SUMMARY Title: Efficacy of Antibiotics in Children with Acute Sinusitis: Which Subgroups Benefit? Phase: III Objectives:  Primary • To determine whether the effect of antimicrobial treatment differs in predefined subgroups of children with acute sinusitis (i.e., to test for treatment subgroup interactions). Subgroups will be defined by [CONTACT_941] (1) presence vs. absence of nasopharyngeal (NP) colonization with respi[INVESTIGATOR_13531] (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis), and (2) presence vs. absence of colored (yellow or green) nasal discharge. Secondary • To determine whether antimicrobial therapy is superior to placebo (i.e., to test for the overall effect).  Tertiary • To evaluate compliance with study product. • To assess adverse events associated with use of amoxicillin clavulanate, including the development of bacterial resistance.  • To compare resource utilization according to treatment strategy.  Population: 688 children aged 2 to 12 years, who meet the current AAP criteria for sinusitis. Inclusion Criteria: 2 -12 years of age (before 12th birthday);Persistent sinusitis: URI symptoms present for >10 days without improvement (11-30 days); Worsening sinusitis: URI symptoms worsening after a period of improvement (6-10 days); baseline score ≥9 on the Pediatric Rhinosinusitis Symptom Scale (PRSS), ≥2 doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or appropriate for age. Exclusion Criteria: Sinusitis with severe presentation (≥3 days of colored nasal discharge and fever ≥39˚ C); asthma/allergic rhinitis explains symptoms; allergy to amoxicillin-clavulanate; immotile cilia syndrome; cystic fibrosis; immunodeficiency; parental/legal guardian inability to read/write English or Spanish; other concurrent infection (e.g., pneumonia, acute otitis media, streptococcal pharyngitis); systemic toxicity; wheezing on exam; antibiotic use within 15 days; prior sinus surgery;  Number of Sites: 5 sites (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_698859] 388 children, and Bardstown, and Madison will enroll 100 children each).. At each site, patients will be enrolled from primary care clinics. Availability of Subjects: Based on the preliminary data presented, we will be able to recruit at least [ADDRESS_948884] 25 patients per year during the course of the study. Consent Process: Parents/legal guardians of children who meet criteria for persistent or worsening presentations of acute sinusitis will be approached for informed consent. Assent will be sought from older children who are believed to be developmentally capable.

 _____________________________________________________________________________________________  10 Retention and Follow-up: In a preliminary study, our retention rate was 94%. In this study, we have built in additional measures to improve retention (electronic daily diary, phone calls to patients with missing data, reimbursement for completing the diary, and home visits). We anticipate no changes in the approaches for retention during the course of the trial. Study Duration: [ADDRESS_948885] Duration: 12 to 18 days Description of Agent and Rationale: Amoxicillin-clavulanate (90/6.4 mg/kg/d in 2 divided doses for 10 days) or matching placebo will be used. Amoxicillin-clavulanate was chosen because of the increasing prevalence of H. influenzae in nasopharyngeal specimens of children with bacterial respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073], and because it is the most effective available orally administered antimicrobial drug against the respi[INVESTIGATOR_698860]. A high dose of amoxicillin will minimize the number of children experiencing treatment failure in the active treatment group. The use of an agent with suboptimal antibacterial coverage would also make it more difficult to determine whether treatment effect heterogeneity exists. Ten days was chosen because this is the duration most frequently used in practice. Description of Study Design: Design: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial Stratification variables: presence/absence of colored (yellow or green) nasal discharge and site of enrollment Duration of treatment: 10 days Primary outcome measure: Pediatric Rhinosinusitis Symptom Scale (PRSS). The PRSS will be administered every evening as an electronic diary. PRSS scores on Days 1 to 11 will be the primary analysis variable (i.e., repeated measures over time will be used to measure disease burden). Secondary efficacy outcome measures: 1) Treatment failure will be defined as follows: a. Worsening at any time–PRSS score increased by >20% from entry. b. No change by 48 hours–PRSS score decreased by <2 points from entry (Day 1) to Day 3. c. Failure to improve significantly by 72 hours–PRSS score decreased by <20% from entry (Day 1) to Day 4. d. PRSS decreased by <20% from enrollment on 2 consecutive occasions on Days 5-11 e. Still symptomatic (PRSS score ≥50% of entry score) at the time of the end-of-study follow-up visit (Days 12 to 18). 2) Development of AOM on Days 1 to 11. 3) Receipt of a systemic antibiotic on Days 1 to 11 for any indication. Tertiary outcome measures:

 _____________________________________________________________________________________________  11 1) Proportion with adverse events (including emergence of bacterial resistance). 2) Proportion who are compliant with study product (took ≥70% of the doses). Flow of patients: We will review each child’s PRSS scores every morning and will contact [CONTACT_3654]/legal guardians of children whose PRSS scores are not improving at the expected rate (see definition of treatment failure above). These children will be seen by [CONTACT_698913], as clinically indicated and without breaking the blind, but they will be continued to be followed in the same way (electronic daily diary and routine end-of-study follow-up visit). Statistical methods:  The primary efficacy analyses will be: • To determine whether the effect of treatment differs in children with and without nasopharyngeal colonization with respi[INVESTIGATOR_13531] (i.e., we will test for interaction). • To determine whether the effect of treatment differs in children with and without colored nasal discharge (i.e., we will test for interaction). Generalized estimating equations will be used for these analyses. The primary analysis will be based on the intention-to-treat principle and will use two-sided tests. The variables chosen to define the subgroups were based on extensive preliminary data indicating likely heterogeneity of treatment effect in subpopulations defined by [CONTACT_207028]/absence of these variables. This sample size will allow us to test these 2 hypotheses simultaneously. Laboratory Tests: A nasopharyngeal swab (or mid-turbinate nasal swab if a nasalpharyngeal swab is unable to be obtained)will be obtained at the baseline and final visit from all participants, when possible We will use the presence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_698861]. These swabs will be shipped to the Microbiology Lab at the Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21815] (CHP) on ice within [ADDRESS_948886] microbiological techniques. Data Management and Monitoring Plan: Data will be electronically captured using (21 CFR Part 11-compliant) electronic case report forms designed by [CONTACT_32928][INVESTIGATOR_698862] (CRHC). Data will be saved on the secured CRHC servers which are backed-up daily and archived weekly. Quality and completeness of data collection will be monitored on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_698914]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21815] (DMSU). Independent clinical study site monitoring will be conducted as detailed in the clinical monitoring plan. Monitoring visits will include, but are not limited to review of regulatory files, accountability records, eCRFs, informed consent forms, medical and laboratory reports, and protocol compliance.  Time to Complete Enrollment: 4.5 years

 _____________________________________________________________________________________________  15 2 BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE 2.1 Background Information 2.1.1 Sinusitis The current clinical practice guideline from the American Academy of Pediatrics for the Diagnosis and Management of Acute Bacterial Sinusitis recommends that the diagnosis of acute sinusitis is made when symptoms of an upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416] (URI) persist beyond 10 days without showing signs of improvement (persistent presentation), when symptoms appear to worsen (on the 6th to 10th day) after a period of improvement (worsening presentation), or when both high fever and purulent nasal discharge are present concurrently for at least 3 consecutive days (severe presentation).1 In studies to date, children with persistent and worsening presentations comprise >95% of cases.[ADDRESS_948895] symptoms (which are both common and non-specific). Accordingly, it seems likely that many children currently being diagnosed as having acute sinusitis actually have an uncomplicated URI. This is important because acute sinusitis is one of the most common diagnoses for which antimicrobials are prescribed for children in the US, accounting for 7.[ADDRESS_948896] infection (URI) and acute sinusitis, current criteria are insufficiently specific to identify children most likely to have bacterial disease.  2.1.3 Preliminary studies In preparation for this trial, we prospectively enrolled 276 consecutive children aged 2 to 12 years with persistent or worsening presentations of acute sinusitis from 6 outpatient clinics in Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109] (NIH R21AI076677, N. Shaikh, PI). The aims of this observational study were to (1) develop and validate a symptom severity scale; (2) identify important prognostic factors that could be used to define subgroups in the present study; and (3) determine signs and symptoms associated with likely bacterial sinusitis, which could then be used to define subgroups for the present study. We screened 2023 children with URI symptoms for eligibility. A total of 355 (18%) 
DMID 15-0048 Version 11.0 Efficacy of Antibiotics in Children with Acute Sinusitis: Which Subgroups Benefit? 2 November 2021   
 _____________________________________________________________________________________________  16 children met clinical criteria for the diagnosis of persistent or worsening presentations of acute sinusitis, and parents/legal guardians of 276 children agreed to enroll their children in our observational study. The mean age (standard deviation) of children enrolled was 6.4 (2.9) years. Almost all children (n=267) had sinus radiographs performed on the day of diagnosis and most (n=204) had a nasopharyngeal swab collected for bacterial culture (for reasons explained below). A large majority of children received antimicrobial therapy (n=227). Seventy six percent of children had abnormal sinus radiographs and 49% had pathogens (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, or M. catarrhalis) isolated from their nasopharynx.25-27            Development and validation of the Pediatric Rhinosinusitis Scale (PRSS). Development of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_698864]-established methods of scale development.28-30 Detailed semi-structured interviews with children with acute sinusitis and their parents/legal guardians guided us in the selection of items most important to them. Based on these data, we selected, from a larger pool of items, 10 items for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_698865]. Each item on the pi[INVESTIGATOR_698866] a 3-point Likert scale (none = 0, a little = 1, a lot = 2) and the total score was obtained by [CONTACT_698915] 10 equally-weighted questions. The 276 parents/legal guardians of children enrolled in the preliminary study were asked to complete the pi[INVESTIGATOR_698867] a once-a-day paper diary (in the evening) for 8 to 10 days (i.e., from enrollment to the end-of-study follow-up visit). Two items (headache, fever) in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_698868]. Table 1 summarizes the psychometric properties of the remaining 8-item scale. These data support the validity and responsiveness of the PRSS; the scale appears to effectively measure severity of symptoms and overall functional status in young children with acute sinusitis. Changes in score over the first few days of illness were substantial and generally matched the assessments both of parents/legal guardians and of clinicians.   Table 1.

In particular, we were concerned about the possibility of a ceiling effect; patients with entering “a lot” of a certain symptom (the most severe response option available) would not be able to use the scale to indicate worsening. Accordingly we modified the PRSS by 
[CONTACT_122830] 15-0048 Version 11.0 Efficacy of Antibiotics in Children with Acute Sinusitis: Which Subgroups Benefit? 2 November 2021   
 _____________________________________________________________________________________________  17 increasing the number of response options from 3 to 6 (from “None”, “A Little”, “A lot” to “None”, “Almost None”, “A little”, “Some”, “A lot”, and “An Extreme Amount”) and administered it as an electronic diary to 65 children with acute sinusitis diagnosed at the Primary Care Center in Pi[INVESTIGATOR_698869] 2014-2015 respi[INVESTIGATOR_431883]. Before administering the scale, however, we performed in-depth cognitive interviews with 75 patients regarding the wording of the individual questions, the new response options, the instructions, and modified the wording of some of the questions on the PRSS (see Supplement B below). The psychometric properties of the modified version of the PRSS (version 2.0) improved significantly. Specifically, (1) the proportion of child at the ceiling value was reduced by [CONTACT_698916] (e.g., 64% vs. 35% at ceiling for night time cough), (2) the responsiveness of the scale improved from 2.07 to 2.48, and (3) the test-reliability of the scale improved from 0.52 to 0.82. The MID of the scale remained stable at 20%. The modification of the scale does not change the sample size estimates; the new version has finer ratings for each of the eight items comprising the score (total maximum score increased from 16 to 40). Assuming these two discrete scales divide the underlying continuous scale into equal intervals, the standard deviation and the mean on the new scale should differ from those on the old scale by a factor of 2.5, which in fact they do (the baseline score and the average standard deviation across treatment and time both increased by 2.5). Because the new version of the scale appears to result in primary summary statistics that are a multiple of those resulting from the old scale, and the tests being used are scale invariant, the original sample size estimates can be used.  Identification of important prognostic factors We compared median time to resolution of symptoms (defined as reaching a score of ≤ 2 on the PRSS on two successive occasions) according to the levels of the potential prognostic factors (variables measured at baseline) using a proportional-hazards model in children receiving antimicrobial therapy for acute sinusitis. The only variable that remained independently associated with time to resolution after adjustment for baseline severity of symptoms was nasopharyngeal colonization with pathogens (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis) at baseline. Median time to symptom resolution in those with and without nasopharyngeal colonization with pathogens was 7.5 and 8.5 days, respectively (p=.008). In contrast, in two previous studies of children with URI who were not receiving antimicrobial therapy, the presence of pathogens predicted slower resolution of symptoms.[ADDRESS_948898] that in this trial, children who are colonized with pathogens will respond differently to treatment than those who are not colonized with pathogens (i.e., heterogeneity of treatment effect). Our preliminary data, which are similar to the data from Kaiser,19,[ADDRESS_948899] for S. pneumoniae is commercially available, can be performed at the bedside, and has good accuracy (sensitivity 88 to 92%, specificity 95 to 97%).41,[ADDRESS_948900] that this was due to the smaller number of children colonized with H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. The ability of the PRSS scale to discern differences in time to resolution according to the presence or absence of pathogens in the nasopharynx further supporting its utility and validity. In summary, our preliminary study supports using the presence of pathogens 
DMID 15-0048 Version 11.0 Efficacy of Antibiotics in Children with Acute Sinusitis: Which Subgroups Benefit? [ADDRESS_948901] are frequently positive in children with URI, normal radiographs are very unlikely in children with significant sinusitis.43 Thus, we reasoned that use of both tests together could be used to divide children into two groups: those with “likely URI” (negative NP swabs OR negative X-rays) vs. those with “possible bacterial sinusitis” (positive NP swabs AND positive X-rays). This approach is admittedly less accurate than sinus aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]; some children with a positive swab and a positive X-ray will have viral URI (because the positive predictive value of these findings is low). Nevertheless, because our goal is restricting antibiotic use, not perfect prediction, using these 2 tests could serve as a reasonable “silver standard” against which the accuracy of signs and symptoms commonly attributed to sinusitis could be assessed. Although all children enrolled in our preliminary study met the diagnostic criteria set forth in the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines, only 79/204 (39%) were classified as having “possible bacterial sinusitis”. Of the signs and symptoms investigated, colored nasal discharge, was the only finding associated with “possible bacterial sinusitis”. Colored discharge was independently associated with the presence of NP pathogens (p<.003) and with abnormal sinus radiographs (p<.001) even after controlling for other variables (e.g., age). Thus, our results support using colored discharge to define the subgroups in this trial.  Survey of current practice supports equipoise. Genuine uncertainty exists among practicing clinicians regarding the need for routine antimicrobial treatment of children with acute sinusitis. In a survey of 68 community pediatricians affiliated with Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_270534] (response rate 86%), only 56% and 32%, respectively, reported routinely prescribing antibiotics for children meeting criteria for persistent and worsening presentations of acute sinusitis. The AAP sinusitis guideline committee was divided between those who favored immediate antimicrobial treatment and those who favored initial observation for children with persistent symptoms. Thus, in recognition of the substantial rate of spontaneous resolution among children diagnosed as having acute sinusitis,6 the guideline1 includes an option for initial observation for children with persistent symptoms (who constitute at least 85% of all children diagnosed with acute sinusitis).2 Given the current uncertainty among practicing pediatricians and the observation-only option offered by [CONTACT_698917], a placebo-controlled trial is appropriate and warranted.

 _____________________________________________________________________________________________  19 2.2 Scientific Rationale 2.2.1 Rationale for the trial [IP_ADDRESS] Inadequate data on efficacy of antibiotics Despi[INVESTIGATOR_698870], surprisingly little evidence exists to support antibiotic treatment. Only [ADDRESS_948902] assessed the benefit of antimicrobial therapy for acute sinusitis (Table 2). A fourth study was excluded from the discussion below because no minimum duration of symptoms was required for inclusion;[ADDRESS_948903] infections (URIs). The numbers of children enrolled in these trials were relatively small (111 children received placebo in the three trials combined),2,6,[ADDRESS_948904] children for enrollment, thus its results are not directly applicable. The results of the two more recent trials2,6 were contradictory: the smaller trial supported antimicrobial treatment whereas the larger trial supported observation only. It seems questionable to recommend antimicrobial treatment based on the results of a trial in which only 28 children received placebo in light of a previous study twice as large that had contrary results. Similarly, it seems questionable to routinely recommend observation when clear evidence exists that some children improve more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_698871]. Accordingly, the 3 randomized controlled trials conducted to date do not allow meaningful conclusions to be reached about the efficacy of antimicrobials. This is reflected in the contradictory recommendations proposed by [CONTACT_698918].1,8-10 A critical need exists for a placebo-controlled trial large enough to determine not only whether antimicrobial therapy is beneficial overall, but also whether there are definable subgroups of children for whom antibiotics are, or are not, sufficiently beneficial to justify their use. By [CONTACT_698919], this study will provide data regarding the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy in children with acute sinusitis.   Table 2.

 _____________________________________________________________________________________________  20 • Excluded children with normal radiographs or with history of asthma  • Analysis not per intention-to-treat principle • Dose of amoxicillin likely not effective for children with resistant S. pneumoniae • Not powered to detect whether treatment effect differed in children with the 3 included presentations  • Fewer children enrolled than expected • Adequate doses of an effective antibiotic will be used • Analysis per intention-to-treat principle • Power calculation based on reliable preliminary data  [IP_ADDRESS] Deficient methods used in previous trials 1) None of the previous trials tracked symptoms on a daily basis. Instead symptoms were assessed by [CONTACT_698920]. Comparing symptoms on any given day is likely to be less sensitive than comparison of the burden of disease over time. 2) The primary outcome in all 3 studies to date was assessed on day 10 or 14. Because symptoms of sinusitis resolve spontaneously over time, comparison of symptoms this late in the course of disease is not ideal. 3) None of the previous trials used a properly validated symptom severity scale to measure response to therapy. The scale developed by [CONTACT_396296].[ADDRESS_948905] validity appears questionable because no data were reported regarding the scale’s correlation with other measures of functional status or with measures of sinusitis severity. Furthermore, parents/legal guardians/children did not provide any input regarding the importance of the items included in the scale. The questionnaire developed by [CONTACT_698921].2 was not psychometrically evaluated.  [IP_ADDRESS] Current diagnostic criteria lack specificity for bacterial disease The current conventional approach in the US is to diagnose acute sinusitis in children with a URI whose clinical course is atypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], characterized by [CONTACT_698922]/or worsening symptoms. Although this approach has had some success in reducing the number of children treated inappropriately with antibiotics, it needs to be refined for several reasons. First, because persistent or worsening upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_698872] (e.g., closely spaced sequential viral infections, asthma, allergic rhinitis). And second, because some uncomplicated viral infections may nonetheless be persistent or biphasic. A recent meta-analysis of studies of children with URI reported that 50% of children were still symptomatic at [ADDRESS_948906] residual respi[INVESTIGATOR_698873]/legal guardians or physicians. All of these factors may lead to the over diagnosis of sinusitis and to the prescription of unnecessary antibiotics. Accordingly, it is likely that many children diagnosed with acute sinusitis using the current criteria actually derive no benefit from antimicrobial therapy.  [IP_ADDRESS] This trial may allow us to make diagnostic criteria more specific for bacterial disease. Development of accurate diagnostic criteria would ideally require a cohort of children with clinically suspected sinusitis to undergo aspi[INVESTIGATOR_698874]. Signs and symptoms associated with the recovery of bacteria from the sinus could then be used to accurately identify those with bacterial disease. Unfortunately, sinus aspi[INVESTIGATOR_698875], often requires sedation, is technically difficult, and is recommended only for children who have severe disease, are 
DMID 15-0048 Version 11.0 Efficacy of Antibiotics in Children with Acute Sinusitis: Which Subgroups Benefit? [ADDRESS_948907] infections that are unresponsive to antibiotic treatment. Accordingly, by [CONTACT_100827], the current diagnostic criteria were developed on the basis of clinical observations of the course of typi[INVESTIGATOR_698876], with acute sinusitis assumed when the duration or quality of children’s symptoms differed significantly from the typi[INVESTIGATOR_31790]. To our knowledge, no other infectious disease for which antibiotics are so frequently prescribed is diagnosed based simply on the duration or course of symptoms; diagnosis usually rests upon reliable findings on examination (as in acute otitis media) or direct testing for presence of bacteria (as in streptococcal pharyngitis). Because of the inaccuracies inherent in the current criteria, refinements are needed that would make the criteria more specific for bacterial disease. Instead of using sinus aspi[INVESTIGATOR_698877], we will use differential response to antibiotic therapy as a means of identifying children with bacterial disease. In other words, examination of response to treatment in various subgroups (defined a priori) in this large randomized, placebo-controlled trial represents a unique and innovative approach to refining the diagnostic criteria for acute bacterial sinusitis in children.  2.2.2 Rationale for using NP colonization to identify the subgroups [IP_ADDRESS] Bacterial superinfection more likely when pathogens present Like Acute Otitis Media (AOM), acute bacterial sinusitis is a superinfection that originates from bacteria in the nasopharynx. The negative predictive value of a nasopharyngeal culture for isolating the same organism from the middle ear is consistently >90%.14-[ADDRESS_948908] for acute sinusitis, presumably because sinus aspi[INVESTIGATOR_698878]. Nevertheless, sinusitis and otitis are similar conditions. It seems reasonable to suppose that acute bacterial sinusitis will also be highly unlikely when no pathogens are present in the nasopharynx. Even if the negative predictive value of the NP culture is in the 75-90% range, it may nonetheless prove useful in practice because unlike AOM, where the diagnosis can be readily and accurately accomplished through direct–i.e. otoscopic–examination, the diagnosis of sinusitis cannot.  [IP_ADDRESS] Children with pathogens in NP benefit more from antimicrobials In two trials comparing antibiotics to placebo, Kaiser compared the resolution of symptoms in adults with URI or sinusitis according to the presence of pathogens in the nasopharynx.19,20 In patients with no pathogen recovered from the nasopharynx, there was no difference between treatment arms in terms of symptom resolution (i.e., no benefit of therapy). In contrast, in those with pathogens recovered from their nasopharynx, symptoms resolved significantly more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_698879]. This study in adults suggests that the presence of pathogens in the nasopharynx holds promise also as a method of selecting children who are likely to benefit from antimicrobial therapy.   2.2.[ADDRESS_948909] association between the presence of nasopharyngeal pathogens and the presence of colored (green/yellow) nasal discharge (P<.003, see below). 
DMID 15-0048 Version 11.0 Efficacy of Antibiotics in Children with Acute Sinusitis: Which Subgroups Benefit? 2 November 2021   
 _____________________________________________________________________________________________  22 Colored nasal discharge has been associated with response to antibiotics in adults with sinusitis; a recent individual patient data meta-analysis compared the number to the needed to treat (NNT) in the subgroup of adults with visible purulent discharge in the pharynx with the NNT for the overall group with acute rhinosinusitis. Compared to the overall group, those with visible discharge were more likely to benefit from antimicrobial therapy (NNT 8 and 15, respectively).[ADDRESS_948910] (86%) pediatricians in the US consider the presence of colored nasal discharge as “very important” or “moderately important” in their decision to diagnose acute sinusitis, and second in importance only to duration of symptoms.24 Thus, it appears necessary to establish whether or not this finding is useful in selecting children who may benefit from antimicrobial therapy. Assessing for colored nasal discharge as a proxy for bacterial disease is appealing because it does not require microbiologic testing. 2.2.4 Rationale for placebo  A placebo arm is necessary to identify subgroups of children who do not require treatment. This will also help establish the natural history of the disease. A comparative trial comparing one antibiotic with another or a short vs. long course of an antibiotic would be premature at this time.  2.2.5 Rationale for the use of clavulanate In our preliminary data, 48% of H. influenzae isolates and 100% of M. catarrhalis isolates produced ß-lactamase. Furthermore, the incidence of disease caused by H. influenzae may be increasing secondary to routine vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.14,[ADDRESS_948911] recent guideline from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommends amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium as the preferred agent for sinusitis in children.[ADDRESS_948912]-line agent.1  2.2.6 Rationale for using the high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium In our preliminary study, 23% of the S. pneumoniae isolates were penicillin-nonsusceptible. In addition, 6% of the non ß-lactamase producing H. influenzae isolates were ampi[INVESTIGATOR_10312]-nonsusceptible. A higher dose of amoxicillin would be needed to treat these ampi[INVESTIGATOR_10312]/penicillin-resistant isolates of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. Furthermore, data collected after widespread use of Pneumococcal Conjugate 13-valent vaccine (PCV-13) indicate46 that many of the emerging serotypes appear to be resistant to penicillin. The rates of diarrhea are no higher when using the high-dose formulation of amoxicillin-clavulanate (because it contains relatively less clavulanate).47,48

 _____________________________________________________________________________________________  23 2.3 Potential Risks and Benefits 2.3.1 Potential Risks 1)    Amoxicillin clavulanate potassium - The most common side effect of amoxicillin clavulanate is diarrhea. Diarrhea is reported by [CONTACT_698923]. Infrequently, children may develop vomiting, nausea, diaper rash, or abdominal pain. Rarely, anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) may occur. The use of antibiotics has been linked to the development of resistant bacteria, both in the child receiving antibiotics and in the community at large. Finally, there is a risk that the child will not respond to amoxicillin clavulanate, and thus require a different treatment. Most of the reported side effects of amoxicillin clavulanate are mild to moderate and resolve when the medication is stopped.   2)    Placebo - There is a theoretical risk that children receiving placebo may be symptomatic for a longer period of time or have more complications than children receiving antibiotics. None of the studies to date, however, have borne this out. The largest study to date found no difference in the time-to-resolution of symptoms in children on antibiotics. Similarly, there is no evidence that immediate treatment with antibiotics is more effective at preventing complications of sinusitis. Most complications of sinusitis seem to occur in older children (who are not included in this study) and occur during the first few days of an upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (before sinusitis is usually diagnosed). Placebo contains no active medications and an allergic reaction is very rare.  3)    Nasopharyngeal swab - The NP swab may cause minor transient discomfort.  4)    Loss of confidentiality - There is a rare risk of breach of confidentiality. Subjects will be asked to provide personal health information (PHI).  All attempts will be made to keep this PHI confidential within the limits of the law.  However, there is a chance that unauthorized persons will see the subjects’ PHI.  All records will be kept in a locked file cabinet or maintained in a locked room at the participating clinical study sites.  Electronic files will be password protected.  Only people who are involved in the conduct, oversight, monitoring, or auditing of this study will be allowed access to the PHI that is collected.  Any publications from this study will not use information that will identify subjects by [CONTACT_2300].  Organizations that may inspect and/or copy research records maintained at the participating clinical study sites for quality assurance and data analysis include groups, such as the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A description of this clinical trial will be available on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov, as required by [CONTACT_122797].  This web site will not include information that can identify subjects.  At most, this web site will include a summary of the results.  5) Internet Communication/Text Messaging- Although every reasonable effort has been taken, confidentiality during Internet communication activities cannot be guaranteed and it is possible that additional information beyond that collected for research purposes may be captured and used by [CONTACT_370703]. Text message are not

Text messages could be intercepted and used by [CONTACT_370703].   6) Mid-Turbinate Nasal Swab. The mid-turbinate (MT) nasal swab may cause some discomfort.   The risk to children receiving placebo will be negligible for several reasons. First, in the context of this trial, placebo is not equivalent to “no treatment”. We will be monitoring changes in the PRSS score on a daily basis and those whose scores are worsening or not improving as expected will be evaluated without delay and treated with rescue antibiotics, as clinically indicated. Parents/legal guardians without reliable phone service will not be enrolled. In addition, parents/legal guardians will have 24-hour access to the study physicians who will arrange a study visit, usually within 24 hours, if indicated. Close follow-up and early treatment of children who appear to be worsening–the strategy proposed here–may be equally or more effective at preventing suppurative complications than routine prescription of antibiotics with no planned active follow-up, which is the standard of care. As such, our study will be similar to a study comparing immediate antimicrobial treatment with delayed prescription, the only difference being that parents/legal guardians and children can be more easily blinded using the design proposed here. We have an excellent track record of ensuring the safety of children in placebo-controlled trials. We recently completed a placebo-controlled trial in which we followed 147 children under 2 years of age with AOM who had been randomized to receive placebo.49 Children in this study will be relatively less vulnerable because they will be older and many will be verbal. Second, we are excluding children at risk for complications of sinusitis (i.e., those with a severe presentation, systemic toxicity, immunodeficiency, and comorbid conditions). Most children enrolled will be well-appearing. In our preliminary dataset, only 3% of children had a temperature ≥38˚C at presentation. Third, suppurative complications of acute sinusitis are rare,[ADDRESS_948913] often in adolescents51 (whom we are excluding), and often occur unexpectedly within the first few days of the onset of URI symptoms,[ADDRESS_948914] been made. The routine use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is likely to further reduce the incidence of complications. Finally, although the rationale for antimicrobial therapy is faster resolution of symptoms, we do not believe that children receiving placebo will experience disproportionate suffering; no differences in time-to-resolution of symptoms was found in studies to date.6 On the other hand, the potential harms associated with antimicrobial therapy (diarrhea, diaper dermatitis, risk of hypersensitivity reaction, potential to induce resistance) are well-documented and quite prevalent. Including children with “worsening” symptoms poses no undue risk to their safety; in our preliminary study, these children were no more likely than children with persistent symptoms to have either nasopharyngeal colonization with respi[INVESTIGATOR_13531] (45% vs 48%, p=0.85) or positive radiographs (p=78% vs 80%, p=0.75). Further, only 32% of pediatricians surveyed treat children with this presentation routinely. Accordingly, for children with the “worsening” presentation, the risks of withholding antibiotics, if any, would be lower in this trial than in usual practice.  There may be other unknown risks, discomforts, or side effects. 2.3.2 Known Potential Benefits  
DMID 15-0048 Version 11.0 Efficacy of Antibiotics in Children with Acute Sinusitis: Which Subgroups Benefit? 2 November 2021   
 _____________________________________________________________________________________________  25 Children receiving placebo may benefit from participation in this trial because they will not be exposed to the side effects of antimicrobial therapy (diarrhea, diaper rash, development of resistant bacteria, anaphylaxis). This trial will also generate generalizable knowledge about the treatment of acute sinusitis in children. 
DMID 15-0048 Version 11.0 Efficacy of Antibiotics in Children with Acute Sinusitis: Which Subgroups Benefit? 2 November 2021   
 _____________________________________________________________________________________________  26 3 OBJECTIVES 3.1 Study Objectives  Primary • To determine whether the effect of antimicrobial treatment differs in predefined subgroups of children with acute sinusitis (i.e., to test for treatment subgroup interactions). Subgroups will be defined by [CONTACT_941] (1) presence vs. absence of nasopharyngeal (NP) colonization with respi[INVESTIGATOR_13531] (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis), and (2) presence vs. absence of colored (yellow or green) nasal discharge. Secondary • To determine whether antimicrobial therapy is superior to placebo (i.e., to test for the overall effect)  Tertiary • To evaluate compliance with study product • To assess adverse events associated with use of amoxicillin clavulanate, including the development of bacterial resistance • To compare resource utilization according to treatment strategy 3.2 Study Outcome Measures 3.2.1 Primary Outcome Measures  The PRSS scale (Supplement B) will be completed on a daily basis (in the evenings) from the day of enrollment (Day 1) to Day 11. PRSS scores over the first 10 days of therapy will be the primary outcome variable (i.e., repeated measures over time will be used to measure disease burden). 3.2.2 Secondary Outcome Measures  Secondary Efficacy Outcomes  1) Treatment failure – Children who are not improving at the expected rate will be identified through daily monitoring of PRSS scores. These children will be seen by [CONTACT_698924]. We will define treatment failure as follows: a. Worsening at any time–PRSS score increased by >20% from entry. b. No change by 48 hours–PRSS score decreased by <2 points from entry (Day 1) to Day 3. c. Failure to improve significantly by 72 hours–PRSS score decreased by <20% from entry (Day 1) to Day 4. d. PRSS decreased by <20% from enrollment on 2 consecutive occasions Days 5-11 e. Still symptomatic (PRSS score ≥50% of entry score) at the time of the end-of-study follow-up visit (Days 12 to 18).  
DMID 15-0048 Version 11.0 Efficacy of Antibiotics in Children with Acute Sinusitis: Which Subgroups Benefit? [ADDRESS_948915] (>90%) treatment failures are expected to occur around that time.2 A 20% change was chosen because this represents the smallest change that appears to be clinically meaningful (see Table 1). Using these definitions, we estimate, based on our preliminary data and on the failure rates observed in previous studies using the same antibiotic,2,7,49,53 that the rate of treatment failure in the antibiotic arm will be approximately 15%. 2) Development of AOM (acute symptoms and a bulging tympanic membrane) on Days 1 to 11. 3) Receipt of an antibiotic (other than the assigned study medication) on Days 1 to 11 for any indication. 3.2.3 Tertiary outcomes  Safety Outcomes 1) Adverse events - The proportions of children experiencing adverse events will be compared. We will also track the duration of each reported adverse event. This will include a comparison of the number of children at the follow-up visit who have resistance organisms. Diarrhea will be defined as the occurrence of ≥3 watery stools in 1 day or 2 watery stools per day for 2 consecutive days, and will be tracked in the daily diary. 2) Compliance - In the daily diary, we will ask parents/legal guardians to record whether they administered the doses of study product. Administration of ≥70% of the doses will be considered compliant.  Other outcomes 1) Resource utilization a. Direct medical costs (costs of visits to healthcare providers plus cost of medications). At the end-of-study follow-up visit, we will ask parents/legal guardians about the number and type of encounters with healthcare providers since enrollment. Similarly the number and types of medication used will be ascertained. b. Indirect costs: At the end-of-study follow-up visit, information will be collected on the indirect costs associated with the diagnosis of acute sinusitis, including travel expenses, alternate child care expenses for the patient and/or siblings, as well as time costs (e.g., for missed work).

 _____________________________________________________________________________________________  28 4 STUDY DESIGN This is a large, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial comparing antimicrobial treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium with matching placebo in children aged 2 years through 12 years of age, who meet the current AAP criteria for sinusitis. (See Schematic of Study Design).  Participants will be recruited from the primary care clinics at 5 sites: (1) Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_698880] (PBRN), CCP South Hills Pediatric Associates and CCP HealthQuest Hampton, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109] (Site PI [INVESTIGATOR_698881]-PI: [INVESTIGATOR_698882]); (2) Kentucky Pediatric and Adult Research, Bardstown, KY (Site PI: [INVESTIGATOR_698883]); (3) University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI (Site PI [INVESTIGATOR_698884]-PI: [INVESTIGATOR_698885]) and (4) Cyn3rgy Research (Site PI: [INVESTIGATOR_698886]).  Children will be randomized 1:1 to receive treatment for 10 days with either twice daily amoxicillin-clavulanate or matching placebo. Randomization will occur in blocks of 4 and study participants and study personnel (except the research pharmacist) will be masked to treatment allocation. Stratification will be based on the presence/absence of colored (yellow or green) nasal discharge and site of enrollment. Randomization codes will not be broken until completion of the trial unless there is a medical emergency that necessitates unmasking. A total of 688 children (approximately 344 in each treatment group), who meet the current AAP criteria for sinusitis will be enrolled over a 5-year period. Each participant will be followed for [ADDRESS_948916] of amoxicillin-clavulanate suspension, 90 mg/kg/day divided into two equal doses. The placebo will be nearly identical in color, taste, and consistency to amoxicillin clavulanate. Amoxicillin clavulanate suspension will be purchased (Augmentin® Pediatric Suspension from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.) and rebottled by [CONTACT_32928][INVESTIGATOR_593623] (IDS). Both Amoxicillin clavulanate and placebo will be similarly labeled with a code number that masks site investigators, site staff, parents/legal guardians and children to the formulation. Study medication will be distributed to clinical sites by [CONTACT_17387].  Treatment effect will be measured primarily using the validated Pediatric Rhinosinusitis Symptom Scale (PRSS) which will be administered every evening as an electronic diary. Once a day, we will send parents/legal guardians a text message and/or an email with a link to a secure website where they will be able to complete the PRSS. Versions for both a personal computer and a smart phone will be available. We will ensure that parents/legal guardians understand the process of completing the diary by [CONTACT_468102] a mock entry either on their personal cell phones or on the research personal computer (PC) or tablet at the enrollment visit. We will reimburse parents/legal guardians $5 for every diary entry completed on the day the alert was sent. Parents/guardians, who complete all diary entries, will be reimbursed an additional $30. Parents/legal guardians who do not have access to the internet will be loaned a tablet (with limited functionality) which they can use to complete the entries. We will design the electronic diary so as to prohibit incomplete forms from being submitted. If the parent/legal guardian does not complete the diary for a given day, we will call or text them the next morning to collect this information and to encourage them to complete the diaries for the following days.  Every morning (including weekends), we will call or text parents/legal guardians whose evening PRSS score is missing. If the PRSS score is missing, this information will be collected over the

If a child’s PRSS score is not improving as expected, an interim evaluation will be scheduled, usually on the same day. A study team member will be available 24 hours/day, 7 days/week via cellular phone. Children failing study product will be treated with clindamycin plus cefixime, amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium, or levofloxacin, or a similar antibiotic, as clinically indicated and without breaking the blind. The results of the nasopharyngeal (NP) culture (growth of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and/or M. catarhallis) may be used to guide therapy. Although growth of Group A. Streptococcus will be ascertained, this will not be used for patient management (because the absence of pharyngitis on exam indicates that the patient is a carrier, which does not require intervention).  An end-of-study follow-up clinic visit will be held once during Days 12 to 18. If the parent/legal guardian is unable or unwilling to return for the end-of-study follow-up visit, we will offer to visit the patient’s home. 
DMID 15-0048 Version 11.0 Efficacy of Antibiotics in Children with Acute Sinusitis: Which Subgroups Benefit? [ADDRESS_948917] AAP guideline,1 will be included. Persistent symptoms will be defined as 11 to 30 days of nasal symptoms and/or cough (not exclusively nocturnal), that is not improving. Worsening symptoms will be defined as worsening nasal symptoms or worsening daytime cough or a  new fever in children who were apparently recovering from a viral URI. These two presentations constitute a large majority of children with sinusitis (>95%).2 Because resolution of symptoms (as measured by [CONTACT_698925]) is our primary outcome, a score of ≥[ADDRESS_948918] not acutely worsened.

The subjects and parents/legal guardians of study subjects will also be masked to treatment group assignment. Randomization codes will not be broken until completion of the trial. Only in the event of a medical emergency and if unmasking would change the selection of treatment, will subject treatment assignment be revealed. The ISM or PI [INVESTIGATOR_698887] a subject by [CONTACT_698926]. Unmasked subjects will complete any remaining protocol assessments (diaries and routine end-of-study follow-up visit). When considering unmasking treatment for a subject, the investigator should consider whether knowing the identity of the treatment would change the selection of treatment. If knowledge of the subjects’ treatment assignment would not affect treatment decisions, unmasking will not occur. 5.3.[ADDRESS_948921]: • Parents/legal guardians request; subjects are free to withdraw from participating in the study at any time upon request. • Parents/legal guardians who do fail to complete any of the diaries during the first 4 days of the study will be withdrawn for non-compliance. 5.3.3 Handling of Withdrawals If a parent/legal guardian is unwilling to continue follow-up through scheduled study visits, the subject will be referred back to their primary care provider (PCP) for continued antibiotic treatment and follow-up. Subjects withdrawn due to non-compliance will be replaced.

 _____________________________________________________________________________________________  33 6 STUDY INTERVENTION/INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT 6.[ADDRESS_948923] Description 6.1.1 Acquisition The amoxicillin-clavulanate used in this study is amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium suspension, administered at a dosage of 90/6.4 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses for 10 days, manufactured by [CONTACT_532029]. This drug is currently licensed for use in children with sinusitis (see Other Attachments section for product insert). It will be rebottled centrally at the IDS and reconstituted at each site.  The placebo used in this study, administered in 2 divided doses for 10 days, will be developed by [CONTACT_698927] a formula which has been extensively tested to ensure similarity of taste, thickness (texture), odor and appearance (color) with the active product. It will be prepared centrally at the IDS and will be reconstituted at each site. The IDS at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_698888] (for amoxicillin/clavulanate) for our multicenter NIAID-sponsored AOM study (BAA-NIAID-DMID-NIHAI2009058). 6.1.[ADDRESS_948924] (whether active treatment or placebo) will be presented in identical prescription bottles with safety caps. Further details regarding formulation, packaging and labeling are included in the protocol-specific Manual of Procedures. 6.1.[ADDRESS_948925] is stored in a secured (locked) area at a temperature of 15-30°C (monitored on a daily basis). At the participating clinical study sites, study product will be stored at this temperature in a dedicated locked storage area with logs to track temperature stability. The temperature will be recorded once daily when the study nurse is working. When the nurse is not working (weekends, holidays, vacation, sick days, etc.) the temperature will be recorded in a minimum/maximum style. In the event of documentation of ambient temperature outside the above range, study product will not be administered and the participating clinical study site investigator or coordinator will contact [CONTACT_698928]. No stability studies on the un-reconstituted active or placebo are necessary or will be conducted after transfer to the study bottles. The active product will not be changed in any way. Study product will be given a one-year expi[INVESTIGATOR_698889] (or earlier if the product has an earlier expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]). 6.2 Dosage, Preparation and Administration of Study Intervention/Investigational Product See the protocol-specific MOP for detailed information regarding the reconstitution of study product. 
DMID 15-0048 Version 11.0 Efficacy of Antibiotics in Children with Acute Sinusitis: Which Subgroups Benefit?

Parents/legal guardians will be instructed to record each dose of study product given to the subject in the daily electronic diary. Parents/legal guardians will be instructed on proper measurement and handling and storage of reconstituted study product. Suggested times for administration of study product will be 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM with a meal or a snack. Subjects enrolled prior to 1:[ADDRESS_948927] at the time of enrollment and a second dose at 7:00 PM that day. Subjects enrolled in the afternoon (after 1:00 PM) will receive the first dose at the time of enrollment and the second dose the next morning. Subsequently, some children will receive the final dose of study production in the morning of Day 11. 6.3 Modification of Study Intervention/Investigational Product for a Participant Children failing study product and children in whom study product is discontinued because of adverse events will be treated with clindamycin plus cefixime, amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium, or levofloxacin, or a similar antibiotic, as clinically indicated and without breaking the blind. The results of the NP culture may be used to guide therapy. 6.4 Accountability Procedures for the Study Intervention/Investigational Product(s) Study product will be supplied by [CONTACT_698929]. The SPA at each site will inventory, record and acknowledge receipt of all shipments of the study product. All study product will be accounted for in the electronic case report form and study product accountability inventory forms. The randomization assignment system will be generated by [CONTACT_698930]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21815]. For each subject, the SPA will document the specific bottle number and volume of study product to be administered per day in the Investigational Product Accountability Log. Parents/legal guardians will be required to return the bottle containing study product to the investigator. Returned study product will be destroyed by [CONTACT_698931] (SOP) once its return has been documented. The study monitor will periodically check the amount of study product held by [CONTACT_698932], or unused. 
DMID 15-0048 Version 11.0 Efficacy of Antibiotics in Children with Acute Sinusitis: Which Subgroups Benefit? [ADDRESS_948928] Compliance with Study Intervention/Investigational Product  Parents/legal guardians will be instructed to track and record study product administration on the electronic diary and to return the study product bottle at the end-of-study follow-up visit. Subjects will be considered to have been compliant with study product if they have taken 70% of the intended regimen. 6.6 Concomitant Medications/Treatments Medication history will be obtained by [CONTACT_698933]/legal guardians. We will ask about previous antihistamines, decongestant, albuterol, or corticosteroid use during the past [ADDRESS_948929] oral or nasal concomitant medications (antihistamines, decongestants, albuterol, antibiotics, corticosteroids, and analgesics) taken by [CONTACT_698934]-of-study follow-up visit or early termination, whichever occurs first, will be ascertained by [CONTACT_7078]/legal guardian interview at the end-of-study follow-up visit or early termination, whichever occurs first. Receipt of a systemic antibiotic while taking study medication will be recorded as this constitutes a secondary endpoint of the study. Medications that might interfere with the evaluation of the investigational product should not be used unless absolutely necessary. Medications in this category include: systemic corticosteroids, nasally administered decongestants or corticosteroids, and systemic medications containing decongestants, antihistamines, or corticosteroids. During participation in this study, subjects should not participate in any other clinical trial and should not receive any investigational drug or vaccine. The use of ibuprofen and acetaminophen is permitted. In the event of an allergic reaction to the assigned study product, subjects will be treated with clindamycin plus cefixime, or levofloxacin or a similar antibiotic, as clinically indicated using the results of the NP culture to guide therapy and without breaking the blind.

 _____________________________________________________________________________________________  36 7 STUDY SCHEDULE See Supplement A for the Schedule of Events table. 7.1 Screening – Day 1 Parents/legal guardians of children presenting to a participating center with URI symptoms will be introduced to study staff by [CONTACT_698935]. The research staff will question the parent regarding the presence and characteristics of their child’s symptoms [duration of symptoms, course of symptoms (e.g., improving, staying the same, worsening), severity of symptoms (PRSS), history of allergic rhinitis, history of asthma]. If the provider’s clinical assessment does not then reveal another etiology that would exclude the child from participating (e.g., AOM, pneumonia, streptococcal pharyngitis, wheezing) informed consent will be sought from the parent/legal guardian. We will attempt to enroll consecutive children meeting eligibility criteria. We will maintain logs of eligible children who are not enrolled. 7.2 Enrollment/Baseline Visit (Entry Visit) – Day 1 After obtaining written informed consent from the parent/legal guardian, we will gather information on the following potential predictors and confounders: demographic characteristics, risk factors (day care attendance, previous systemic antimicrobial use, exposure to household cigarette smoke), symptoms (type and duration, including some symptoms not included on the PRSS), past medical history (sinusitis, AOM, allergic rhinitis, asthma, pneumococcal vaccination), temperature and weight measurement (if not already taken for clinical care), and concomitant medications. Temperature will be measured using appropriate method according to the child’s age and parental preference (oral, rectal, axially, temporal, or tympanic). We will assess the nose and throat for facial tenderness and swelling. A nasopharyngeal swab will be obtained, when possible, and placed in transport media and sent to the Microbiology Laboratory-CHP for processing. In the event a nasopharyngeal swab is unable to be obtained, the study team will attempt to obtain a mid-turbinate nasal swab.When possible,the first dose of the study product will be given at the time of enrollment following randomization and monitoring of adverse events will begin. This will reduce variability due to delay in the initiation of therapy. We will ask parents/legal guardians to refrain from administering intranasal medications (e.g., corticosteroids, decongestants), and systemic medications containing antihistamines, decongestants or corticosteroids to their child for the duration of the study. We will assess whether the nasal discharge is colored. In our preliminary study (n=276), we showed that asking parents/legal guardians directly about the color of the nasal discharge (In the last 24 hours, was your child’s nasal discharge (mucus) yellow or green?) yielded information that was predictive of both the bacteria cultured from the nasopharynx (p=.006) and the findings of sinus radiographs (p=.003). Parental/legal guardian report of “white” discharge or physician examination of the anterior nares or nasal turbinates for colored discharge was not similarly informative. As an additional method of assessing color, we will utilize a color chart (with 4 colors: green, yellow, white, clear) and ask parents/legal guardians to identify the color that most closely resembles their child’s nasal discharge. Nevertheless, based on our strong preliminary data, and based on the fact that the assessment of nasal discharge using a color chart is unlikely to be practical in a busy clinical practice, asking parents/legal guardians whether their 
DMID 15-0048 Version 11.0 Efficacy of Antibiotics in Children with Acute Sinusitis: Which Subgroups Benefit? 2 November 2021   
 _____________________________________________________________________________________________  37 child’s nasal discharge was yellow or green will remain the primary method of defining “colored nasal discharge”. 7.3 Follow-up eVisits – Days 2-11 Diary – Parents/legal guardians will be asked to complete the PRSS electronically once daily–at the time of the evening dose of the study product and when their child is able to provide active input–from the day of enrollment (Day 1) to Day 11. Parents/legal guardians will be instructed to record each dose of study product given to the subject in the daily electronic diary. Suggested times for administration of study product will be 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM with a meal or a snack. Parents/legal guardians will be instructed on proper measurement and handling and storage of reconstituted study product. Once a day, we will send parents/legal guardians a text message or an email with a link to a secure website where they will be able to complete the PRSS. Versions for both a personal computer and a smart phone or tablet will be available. We will ensure that parents/legal guardians understand the process of completing the diary by [CONTACT_468102] a mock entry either on their personal cell phones or on the research PC or tablet at the enrollment visit. We will reimburse parents/legal guardians $5 for every diary entry completed on the day the alert was sent ($55 total).Parents/guardians, who complete all diary entries, will be reimbursed an additional $30. Parents/legal guardians who do not have access to the internet will be loaned a phone or tablet (with limited functionality) which they can use to complete the entries. We will reimburse parents/legal guardians $50 at the time of the end-of-study follow-up visit and to encourage the return of the study phone or tablet if one was loaned The diary will also ask about medication compliance (adherence assessment), adverse events, and the overall degree of change from the previous day (on a 7-point scale) (symptom assessment). In a survey of 108 parents/legal guardians attending our inner-city clinic, 85% reported having a cell phone with a data plan. The proportion of parents/legal guardians with access to the internet will likely be higher at the other study sites. Phone calls – Every morning (including weekends), we will call or text parents/legal guardians whose evening PRSS score is missing. If the PRSS score is missing, this information will be collected over the phone or the parents/legal guardians will be provided a text with a link to complete the missing diary entry.  7.4 Final Study Visit (End-of-Study Follow-up Visit) – Days 12 to 18 Parents/legal guardians and their children will be asked to return once during Days 12 to 18 for a routine follow-up evaluation. At this visit, the PRSS will be completed and parents will be questioned regarding the child quality of life. A nasopharyngeal swab will be  obtained,when possible, and placed in transport media and sent to the Microbiology Laboratory-CHP for processing. In the event a nasopharyngeal swab is unable to be obtained, the study team will obtain a mid-turbinate nasal swab. We will ask about adverse events, interim medical history including visits to other health care providers, and concomitant medications. A phone call, email or text message will be sent 1 to 2 days before the end-of-study follow-up visit to confirm the time of the appointment. If the patient is unable to come to the end-of-study follow-up visit, a visit to the home will be offered. If this is not possible, we will, to the extent possible, obtain information that was to be gathered at the Final Study Visit by [CONTACT_61529].  
DMID 15-0048 Version 11.0 Efficacy of Antibiotics in Children with Acute Sinusitis: Which Subgroups Benefit? 2 November 2021   
 _____________________________________________________________________________________________  38 7.5 Unscheduled Visit (Interim (Sick) Visit) If a child’s PRSS score is not improving as expected, or if a parent is concerned about their child, an interim evaluation will be scheduled, usually on the same day. If the parent/legal guardian is unable to come to the office, a home visit may be offered. If the child cannot be seen and assessment of the child’s symptoms by [CONTACT_698936], an antibiotic may be started without an evaluation. A study team member will be available 24 hours/day, 7 days/week via cellular phone. Children failing study product will be treated with clindamycin plus cefixime, amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium, levofloxacin, or a similar antibiotic, as clinically indicated and without breaking the blind. The results of the nasopharyngeal culture may be used to guide therapy. The following procedures may be performed at this visit: interim medical history including visits to other health care providers and concomitant medications collection, temperature measurement, face/nose assessment, PRSS score, and adverse events monitoring. Temperature will be measured using appropriate method according to the child’s age and parental preference (oral, rectal, axially, temporal, or tympanic).

 _____________________________________________________________________________________________  39 8 STUDY PROCEDURES/EVALUATIONS 8.1 Clinical Evaluations Medical History: Will be obtained by [CONTACT_698933]/legal guardians. Parents/legal guardians will be queried regarding demographic characteristics, risk factors (day care attendance, exposure to smokers in the house), symptoms (type and duration, including some symptoms not included on the PRSS), and past medical history since birth (sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, asthma, and medications used to treat these) at the baseline visit. We will also ask parents/legal guardians to assess the severity of their child’s symptoms using a visual analog scale anchored at “very mild” and “very severe”. At the final end-of-study follow-up visit, we will ask parents to complete the PRSS, to answer question about visits to other providers, missed work, quality of life, and the need to make alternate daycare arrangements, and about adverse events. Medication History: Will be obtained by [CONTACT_698933]/legal guardians. We will ask about previous antihistamines, decongestant, albuterol, or corticosteroid use during the past [ADDRESS_948930]. Receipt of a systemic antibiotic while taking study medication will be recorded as this constitutes a secondary endpoint of the study. The use of these medications will be ascertained by [CONTACT_7078]/legal guardian interview at the end-of-study follow-up visit or early termination, whichever occurs first. Vital Signs: Temperature and weight will be measured at enrollment/baseline visit and the interim (sick) visit (if not already taken for clinical care). Temperature will be measured using appropriate method according to the child’s age and parental preference (oral, rectal, axially, temporal, or tympanic). Limited assessment of face and nose: At the baseline and unscheduled interim (sick) visit, a targeted assessment of the face and nose using standardized methods will be performed by [CONTACT_108897]. Diary: The PRSS will be administered by [CONTACT_3654]/legal guardians every evening as an electronic diary. In addition to the PRSS score, the diary will track compliance with study product, the frequency and the consistency of bowel movements, and a global assessment of health. The critical data for symptom resolution is during days 2-11, but we have given parents the opportunity to record the information from day 1 in order to establish the habit of recording in the diary. 8.2 Laboratory Evaluations 8.2.1 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations At the enrollment/baseline and final study visit, a nasopharyngeal sample may be obtained from one nostril using a sterile, flexible, thin, flocked swab. Compared to Dacron swabs, flocked swabs are better tolerated and have a higher yield for bacteria54,55 and viruses.56-58 The tip of the nose

If any obstruction is encountered, the sample will be taken from the other nostril. All investigators will be trained on this procedure before to the onset of the study (see protocol-specific Manual of Procedures). We will cut the tip of the swab with a pair of sterile scissors into a cryovial containing RLT and this will be stored for future studies of RNA expression. The remainder of the swab will be placed into Amies and will be refrigerated (2-8˚ C) until it can be transported (on ice) to the Microbiology Laboratory at Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21815] (within 48 hours). Two types of culture plates will be used initially: trypticase soy 5% sheep blood agar and chocolate agar.  Cultures will be incubated overnight at 37°C with 5% CO2. If no growth is present after overnight incubation, the culture will be re-incubated for an additional [ADDRESS_948931] current guidelines from the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Microdilutional broth susceptibility testing will be performed on all penicillin non susceptible isolates. All pneumococcal isolates will be typed using gene-based typi[INVESTIGATOR_63980]. 8.2.2 Special Assays or Procedures Not applicable. 8.2.3 Specimen Preparation, Handling, and Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] [IP_ADDRESS] Instructions for Specimen Preparation, Handling, and Storage All clinical microbiological samples (NP swab  and MT swab specimens) obtained from all study participants enrolled at all participating clinical study sites will be processed at CHP according to guidelines established by [CONTACT_698937]. This laboratory will identify all organisms cultured from the samples. Instructions for specimen preparation, handling, and storage are included in the Laboratory Plan. [IP_ADDRESS] Specimen Shipment NP swab (or MT swab) specimens may be collected at the entry visit (Day 1) and the follow-up visit (Day 12-18).

[ADDRESS_948933] [i.e., Protocol-Defined Diarrhea (PDD), generalized rash, and bacterial resistance], any adverse event, which requires more than minimal medical intervention (see below for definitions), and all serious adverse events. Because the study product is approved for use for children with sinusitis, we will only track 1) common or important adverse events linked with the study product (PDD, generalized rash), 2) severe adverse event (AEs which require more than minimal medical intervention, Table 4, below), and 3) serious adverse events (see section 9.2.3). PDD will be defined by [CONTACT_698938] [ADDRESS_948934] study intervention, Day 1 (enrollment), through the end-of-study follow-up visit. 9.2 Methods and Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety Parameters 9.2.1 Adverse Events Adverse Event (AE): ICH E6 defines an AE as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product regardless of its causal relationship to the study treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of medicinal (investigational) product. The occurrence of an AE may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study recipi[INVESTIGATOR_12189], or upon review by a study monitor. FDA defines an AE as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. AEs not meeting the protocol-defined criteria for SAEs will be captured on the appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF).  Information to be collected for non-serious AEs includes event description, date of onset, licensed study physician’s assessment of severity and relationship to study product and alternate etiology (if not related to study product) (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis and listed on the Form FDA 1572 as the site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_11637]-investigator), date of resolution of the event, seriousness and outcome.  AEs occurring during the collection and reporting period will be documented appropriately regardless of their relationship to the study product. All recorded AEs will be followed to adequate resolution. Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject is screened will be considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the severity of any pre-existing medical condition increases at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE. AEs must be graded for severity and assessed for relationship to study product (see definitions below).  Adverse events characterized as intermittent require 
DMID 15-0048 Version 11.0 Efficacy of Antibiotics in Children with Acute Sinusitis: Which Subgroups Benefit? 2 November 2021   
 _____________________________________________________________________________________________  43 documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  The start and stop date of each reported AE will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. Bacterial resistance will be reported based on the report from the laboratory.  Severity of Event:  AEs will be assessed by a licensed study physician listed on the Form FDA 1572 as the site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_29353]-investigator.  The severity of non-serious AEs will be assessed according to the scale below: • Mild: events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the subject’s daily activities. • Moderate: events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning. • Severe: events interrupt a subject’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually incapacitating. Examples of the types of non-serious AEs that will be collected (contained within the heavy lines) and AEs that will not be collected (gray font and marked by [CONTACT_61140]) are shown in the Table below.

Factors to consider in determining a causal relationship include whether: (1) the event is described in the product insert; (2) a temporal relationship exists between the event and administration of study product; (3) a possible alternative etiology has been identified; and (4) it is biologically plausible that the event may be related to the product. If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported. In a clinical trial, the study product must always be suspect.  The relationship to study product must be assessed for AEs using the terms: related or not related.  The following guidelines will be used in this assessment: • Related – There is a reasonable possibility that the study product caused the adverse event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study product and the adverse event. • Not Related – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study product caused the event. 9.2.2 Reactogenicity Not applicable. 9.2.3 Serious Adverse Events Serious Adverse Event (SAE): An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if it results in any of the following outcomes: • Death, • a life-threatening adverse event*, • inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], • a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or • a congenital anomaly/birth defect. • Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12190], based upon appropriate medical judgment they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. * Life-threatening adverse event.  An adverse event is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_10157], its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.

At any time after completion of the trial, if the investigator becomes aware of an SAE that is suspected to be related to study product, the investigator will report the event to the DMID Pharmacovigilance Group. 9.3.[ADDRESS_948939] a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. The principal investigators will notify FDA and all participating site principal investigators (i.e., all principal investigators to whom the sponsor is providing drug under its IND(s) or under any principal investigator’s IND(s)) in an IND safety report of potential serious risks from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting as specified in 21 CFR Part 312.32. The principal investigators will also notify FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible, but in no case later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.  Relevant follow up information to an IND safety report will be submitted as soon as the information is available. Upon request from FDA, the principal investigators will submit to FDA any additional data or information that the agency deems necessary, as soon as possible, but in no case later than [ADDRESS_948940]. All serious events designated as “not related” to study product, will be reported to the FDA at least annually in a summary format. 9.3.3 Reporting of Pregnancy Not applicable.

 _____________________________________________________________________________________________  47 9.4 Type and Duration of Follow-up of Subjects after Adverse Events AEs will be collected, assessed, and followed through resolution throughout the study-reporting period. SAEs will be collected, assessed, and followed through resolution even if this extends beyond the study-reporting period. Resolution of an AE/SAE is defined as the return to pretreatment status or stabilization of the condition with the expectation that it will remain chronic. Follow-up procedures, evaluations, and outcomes will be recorded on the appropriate form and/or eCRF. 9.[ADDRESS_948941] administration will be halted for DSMB review/recommendation if any of the following are reported: • Any death occurs following study product administration that was not the result of trauma or accident. • Any subject develops brain abscess or bacterial meningitis. • Two subjects develop complications of sinusitis (e.g., orbital cellulitis, frontal bone subperiosteal abscess). If any of the halting rules are met following any subject receipt of study product, the trial will not proceed with the remaining enrollments or study product administration without a review by [CONTACT_421260]. The University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], IRBs and DMID retain the authority to suspend enrollment and/or study product administration during the entire trial, as applicable. 9.6 Safety Oversight (ISM plus DSMB) Safety oversight will be conducted by [CONTACT_62052], which is an independent group of experts that reviews study data, monitors subject safety and advises DMID and the principal investigators. The DSMB will consist of at least three voting members with appropriate expertise to contribute to the interpretation of the data from this trial including a biostatistician experienced in statistical methods for clinical trials and a clinician with relevant expertise. The DSMB members will be separate and independent of study personnel participating in this trial and should not have scientific, financial or other conflict of interest related to this trial. To avoid any appearance of conflict of interest, it is critical that DSMB members not be involved in the study, have no vested interest in its outcome, have no ties to the study investigators and have no financial ties to any commercial concerns likely to be affected by [CONTACT_1758]'s outcome. 
DMID 15-0048 Version 11.0 Efficacy of Antibiotics in Children with Acute Sinusitis: Which Subgroups Benefit? 2 November 2021   
 _____________________________________________________________________________________________  48 The DSMB will review study progress and participant, clinical, efficacy, laboratory, and safety data at the following time points: • At specified times during the course of this trial as defined in the DSMB Charter. • At the time of the interim analysis (conducted after [ADDRESS_948942] been enrolled and completed follow-up). • Ad hoc when a halting rule is met, for immediate concerns regarding observations during this trial, or as needed. The DSMB will meet regularly to monitor the cumulative safety data during the period when participants are receiving study product and during the participant follow-up period. The DSMB will monitor the study according to the guidelines specified in the study protocol and the charter established at their initial meeting, unless the DSMB determines during the course of the trial that modification of the guidelines is in the best interest of this trial and its participants. Such a decision may be based on new information that emerges during the course of this trial (e.g., publication of the results of a similar trial), realization of inappropriate initial study assumptions, or the occurrence of an unanticipated scenario. The DSMB will operate under the rules of a DMID-approved charter that will be written at the organizational meeting of the DSMB. At this time, each data element that the DSMB needs to assess will be clearly defined. Procedures for DSMB reviews and meetings will be defined in the charter. Procedural issues include: the board’s meeting frequency; the types and formats of reports it will receive from the DMSU, the policy on whether and how the members may be unblinded; what interim data (if any) may be released to the study investigators (e.g., overall AE rate); and how minutes will be taken and distributed. Before initiation of this trial, the DSMB will review the study protocol (particularly the specific outcome definitions), halting rules, the interim and final analysis plan, the procedures for recording and reporting SAEs, and the data and safety monitoring plan (including draft shells of safety reports and tables). The informed consent document/process also will be inspected to ensure that all required elements have been included in language understandable to parents/legal guardians of children to be enrolled in this trial. Study data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_698939]. The DSMB will review applicable data to include but not limited to study progress, enrollment, demographic, clinical, efficacy outcomes, laboratory and safety data which includes AE/SAEs, medical history, physical assessments, concomitant medications, compliance, and laboratory results (NP cultures). Interim statistical reports will be generated when 50% of patients have completed the study. Comparative results are presented to the DSMB in closed sessions attended only by [CONTACT_698940] a representative of DMID. Additional data may be requested by [CONTACT_4318], and additional interim statistical reports may be generated as deemed necessary and appropriate by [CONTACT_122830].  The DSMB may receive data in aggregate and presented by [CONTACT_19313].  The DSMB may also be provided with expected and observed rates of the expected AEs in an unblinded fashion, and may request treatment assignment be unblinded for an individual subject if required for safety assessment.  The DSMB will review grouped and unblinded data in the closed session only. As an outcome of each review or meeting, the DSMB

DMID or the DSMB chair may convene the DSMB on an ad hoc basis according to protocol criteria or if there are immediate concerns regarding observations during the course of this trial. The DMID Medical Monitor is empowered to stop study enrollment and study product administration if adverse events that meet the halting criteria are reported. The DMID Medical Monitor and the ISM will be responsible for reviewing SAEs in real time.  The DSMB will review SAEs on a regular basis and ad hoc during this trial. Independent Safety Monitor (ISM) ISMs are physicians with relevant pediatric expertise and whose primary responsibility is to provide timely independent safety monitoring. The ISM (one for each site) will not be directly involved in the trial, will not be under the investigators’ supervision, and will have no financial, intellectual, proprietary or professional interest in the outcome of the trial. An ISM with relevant sinusitis and/or pediatric infectious diseases expertise is assigned to each participating clinical study site, is in close proximity to the site and has the authority to readily access study participant records. The ISM reviews any SAE in real time and other AEs as needed and provides an independent assessment to the investigators and DMID. The ISM will not contact [CONTACT_698941].

Independent clinical study site monitoring will be conducted as detailed in the clinical monitoring plan. This will include on-site monitoring visits at standard intervals, or more frequently as necessary, throughout the study to oversee data collection, review source documentation, ensure GCP, protocol and regulatory compliance, and resolve data queries. Monitoring visits will include, but are not limited to review of regulatory files, accountability records, eCRFs, informed consent forms, medical and laboratory reports, and protocol compliance. The monitor’s Clinical Research Associates (CRAs) will have reasonable access to the participating clinical study sites, study personnel, and all study documentation. CRAs will meet with participating clinical study site investigators to discuss any problems and actions to be taken and document visit finding and discussions. Clinical monitoring reports will be submitted to the principal investigators and DMID.

 _____________________________________________________________________________________________  51 11 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 11.1 Study Hypotheses  Hypothesis 1: Children not colonized with respi[INVESTIGATOR_698892]. Hypothesis 2: Children without colored nasal discharge are unlikely to benefit from antimicrobial therapy. 11.2 Primary and Secondary Analyses  Primary • To determine whether the effect of antimicrobial treatment differs in predefined subgroups of children with acute sinusitis (i.e., to test for treatment subgroup interactions). Subgroups will be defined by [CONTACT_941] (1) presence vs. absence of nasopharyngeal (NP) colonization with respi[INVESTIGATOR_13531] (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis), and (2) presence vs. absence of colored (yellow or green) nasal discharge. Secondary • To determine whether antimicrobial therapy is superior to placebo (i.e., to test for the overall effect) Tertiary • To evaluate compliance with study product • To assess adverse events associated with use of amoxicillin clavulanate, including the development of bacterial resistance • To compare resource utilization according to treatment strategy 11.3 Analysis Populations  11.3.1  Intent-to-Treat Population (ITT)  The ITT population will consist of all eligible randomized children with at least 1 diary entry. This population will form the basis for the primary and secondary efficacy analyses of study data as well as for the safety analyses. 11.3.2        Per Protocol Population  Children who receive 70% of the prescribed doses of study product (whether antibiotics or placebo) will comprise the per protocol population. This population will form the basis of secondary, supportive analyses of the efficacy and safety endpoints. 11.4 Efficacy Assessments  
DMID 15-0048 Version 11.0 Efficacy of Antibiotics in Children with Acute Sinusitis: Which Subgroups Benefit? [ADDRESS_948945] 10 days of therapy (Day 1 to 11) will be recorded by [CONTACT_3654]/legal guardians using an electronic tablet or a personal computer, a cell phone, or a tablet every evening. A routine end-of-study follow-up clinic visit will be held once during Days [ADDRESS_948946] relevant. Clinicians prescribe antimicrobials for children with acute sinusitis under the assumption that it hastens the resolution of symptoms. Thus, to assess the degree of improvement and/or deterioration we chose a validated symptom score to serve as the primary efficacy variable.  The PRSS (See Supplement B) consists of eight discrete items: runny nose, stuffy nose, daytime cough, nighttime cough, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_317293], trouble breathing through the nose, irritability, and being tired. Parents/legal guardians are asked to rate these symptoms, as “none”, “almost none”, “a little”, “some”, “a lot”, or “an extreme amount” with corresponding scores of 0 to 5. PRSS scores may thus range from 0 to 40. 11.4.2 Secondary Efficacy Variables The secondary efficacy variables include: 1) Treatment failure - Children who are not improving at the expected rate will be identified through daily monitoring of the PRSS scores by [CONTACT_5984]. These children will be seen by [CONTACT_698913], as clinically indicated. We will define treatment failure if any of the following conditions are met: a. Worsening at any time–total PRSS score increased by >20% from entry. b. No change by 48 hours–total PRSS score decreased by <2 points from entry (Day 1) to Day 3. c. Failure to improve significantly by 72 hours–total PRSS score decreased by <20% from entry (Day 1) to Day 4. d. PRSS decreased by <20% from enrollment on 2 consecutive occasions on Days 5-11 e. Still symptomatic (total PRSS score ≥50% of entry score) at the time of the end-of-study follow-up visit (Days 12 to 18). 2) Development of AOM (acute symptoms and a bulging tympanic membrane) on Days 1 to 11. 3) Receipt of an antibiotic (other than the assigned study product) for any indication on Days 1 to 11. 11.5 Safety and Tolerability Assessments Safety and tolerability assessments include: 1) Adverse events - The proportions of children experiencing certain adverse events will be compared. We will also track the duration of these adverse events. Diarrhea will be

 _____________________________________________________________________________________________  53 defined as the occurrence of ≥3 watery stools in 1 day or 2 watery stools per day for 2 consecutive days. This will be tracked in the daily diary. Changes in bacterial resistance from baseline to follow-up will be tabulated. 2) Compliance - In the daily diary, we will ask parents/legal guardians to record whether they administered the doses of study product. Administration of ≥70% of the doses will be considered compliant. 11.6 Statistical Analyses 11.6.1 General Considerations Study data will be monitored on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_698930]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21815]. Final cleaning and editing of the study database will be carried out after the last patient completes follow-up. Unblinding of treatment assignments will not be performed until the study data are cleaned, queries resolved, and database lock achieved. All changes to the study database will be documented. A permanent archive of the database will be maintained by [CONTACT_698942].  A 2x2 factorial design, adjusted for multiple testing, will be used to detect interactions for the longitudinal outcome, where Factor A will be antibiotic-treated vs. placebo and Factor B will be either colored nasal discharge (yellow or green vs. clear) or nasopharyngeal colonization (positive vs. negative).  All statistical tests will be two-tailed and conducted at global significance level of 0.05. For the primary efficacy analysis, the significance level for the final analysis will take into account the interim analysis. Sites with few children randomized may be pooled. Pooling of study sites will occur prior to unblinding. All programs used in the statistical analysis will be documented, tested, and archived. Archiving of statistical analyses at the DMSU includes the original written specifications for the analyses, any subsequent modifications, the computer program file, and the log, list and other output files produced by [CONTACT_78311]. The DMSU will use the most current version of SAS®. 11.6.[ADDRESS_948947] completed this trial. Type I error will be controlled using the method of Fleming, Harrington and O’Brien59 and testing will be conducted at significance levels of 0.[ADDRESS_948948] one of the tests for interaction is significant (i.e., if there is unequivocal evidence of treatment effect heterogeneity), the DSMB may consider recommending stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_698893]. 11.6.[ADDRESS_948949] Disposition The number of patients screened, randomized, withdrawn, and included in each analysis population (ITT, Per Protocol) will be reported by [CONTACT_698943]. In addition, the number of patients completing this trial and the reasons for patient withdrawal will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1570]. These data will be used to prepare a CONSORT diagram.

 _____________________________________________________________________________________________  54 11.6.4 Baseline (Pre-Treatment) Analyses  Demographic and baseline clinical characteristics will be presented by [CONTACT_698944]. For categorical variables we will report frequencies and percentages. For continuous variables we will report means and standard deviations. 11.6.[ADDRESS_948950] in subpopulations defined by [CONTACT_698945] (i.e., to test for interaction between treatment and subgroup effects).  Interactions between treatment group and each subgroupi[INVESTIGATOR_698894]. A Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) model will be fit by [CONTACT_698946] (adjusted for the baseline PRSS score) using the ITT dataset (see Section 6.8 for detailed multiple testing procedure).66 The regression analysis will be adjusted for clinical site as a potential confounding factor.  Assumptions required for the validity of GEE will be assessed. These will include (i) the marginal mean of the response depends on a link function, (ii) the marginal variance depends on the marginal mean, and (iii) the correlation within subject depends on the marginal mean and other parameters. Therefore an appropriate link function will be chosen for the primary outcome and the goodness of fit of the model will be assessed. 11.7.[ADDRESS_948951] in the subgroups we are considering is heterogeneous. GEE will be used to compare the marginal means adjusted for the baseline PRSS score and stratification variables using the ITT population.  In addition, we will explore whether heterogeneous response to treatment is observed for other baseline variables, including worsening presentation, age, history of allergic rhinitis, and individual pathogens. We consider this investigation of the additional variables to be only 
DMID 15-0048 Version 11.0 Efficacy of Antibiotics in Children with Acute Sinusitis: Which Subgroups Benefit? [ADDRESS_948952] for baseline covariates and other prognostic variables. 11.8 Missing Data  For children with missing values for the primary endpoint (no diary data available for a particular day), we will use only the days with non-missing values, which can be accommodated by [CONTACT_698947]. Children with no diary entries will be excluded from the analysis. If a patient has missing data for a dichotomous secondary outcome variable, we will perform a sensitivity analysis first assuming that all such patients had the deleterious outcome (for instance, treatment failure) and then assuming that all such patients had a favorable outcome.  The proportion of patients with missing data for each outcome variable will also be compared between treatment groups and the sensitivity to the missing data will be examined by [CONTACT_698948]-missing data. However, we are confident that the amount of missing data will be negligible because study procedures have been put in place to minimize missing data. 11.[ADDRESS_948953] 1 diary entry will be included in the intent-to-treat analysis population. 11.10 Safety and Tolerability Analyses 11.10.1 Compliance  Compliance will be assessed by [CONTACT_7079]/legal guardians report on the daily diary. Compliance with study product will be defined as receipt of at least 70% of the expected doses. The proportion of patients who are compliant will be reported by [CONTACT_1570]. Treatment group differences in compliance will be assessed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by [CONTACT_3885]. 11.10.2 Adverse Events  
DMID 15-0048 Version 11.0 Efficacy of Antibiotics in Children with Acute Sinusitis: Which Subgroups Benefit? [ADDRESS_948954] intensity will be presented in the tables. For summary tables, adverse events will be grouped by [CONTACT_34565]. We will also track the duration of each reported adverse event. Diarrhea, a key and expected adverse event, will be defined as the occurrence of ≥3 watery stools in 1 day or 2 watery stools per day for 2 consecutive days, and will be tracked in the daily diary. The incidence of serious adverse events and study medication discontinuation due to adverse events will also be compared using Fisher’s exact test.[ADDRESS_948955] costs (i.e., costs of visits to healthcare providers plus cost of medications) and indirect costs (e.g., travel costs). For direct costs, we will ask parents/legal guardians about the number and type of encounters with healthcare providers since enrollment. Similarly the types and duration of medication used will be ascertained. For indirect costs, we will ask parents/legal guardians about travel expenses, alternate child care expenses (for the patient and/or siblings), as well as time costs (e.g., for missed work). These assessments will be conducted at the time of the end-of-study follow-up visit. 11.[ADDRESS_948956] correlation and grand variance from our preliminary data of children diagnosed with acute sinusitis. Because two simultaneous tests for interactions are being conducted, we used a two-sided significance level of 0.025 (50:50 split of the overall significance level of 0.05 for Bonferroni adjustment).  Assuming an α of 0.025 (two-sided test), 344 evaluable children per treatment group will provide statistical power of 80% to detect an interaction effect size of 2.5 points in the mean symptom score (as measured by [CONTACT_698925]) over the 10-day period assuming, as per results presented in Leon and Heo,[ADDRESS_948957] statistics.72 Under the Simes’ procedure, the null hypothesis associated with the smallest p-value will be rejected if the p-value is smaller than or equal to and one associated with the second smallest p-value will be rejected if the p-value is smaller than or equal to. Here is the appropriate significance level for the interim or definitive analysis. Specifically, the (ordered) observed p-values will be compared using 0.0025 and 0.005 for the interim analysis and using 0.024 and 0.048 for the definitive analysis. /2a/2a/2a

Emergency medical treatment for injuries solely and directly related to participation in this research study will be provided to participants. The insurance provider may be billed for the costs of this emergency treatment, but none of those costs will be charged directly to the participant. If the research-related injury requires medical care beyond this emergency treatment, parents/legal guardians will be responsible for the costs of this follow-up care. No plan exists for any additional financial compensation. 14.7 Study Discontinuation In the event that this trial is discontinued, enrolled subjects will continue to be followed until the end-of-study follow-up visit. Subjects with ongoing medical issues that require further follow-up will be referred to their physician. No further study products will be administered. 14.8 Future Use of Stored Specimens  Subjects or parent(s)/legal guardian(s) will have agreed to allow their NP sample and the organisms isolated from it to be used for future research studies including studies of bacterial genomics in the consent form. Samples will be stored indefinitely in the Microbiology Laboratory or at a central clinical storage facility and may be shared with investigators at the participating clinical study site and other investigators at other institutions.  The samples will not be sold or used directly for production of any commercial product. No human genetic tests will be performed on samples.  Each sample will be encoded (labeled) with a unique tracking number to protect subject confidentiality.  There are no benefits to subjects in the collection, storage and subsequent research use of specimens. Reports about future research done with subjects’ samples will NOT be kept in their health records.

The eCRF incorporates automatic edit checks that serve to prevent errors and substantially reduce time to clean data. Data obtained during the study visits will be entered directly into the eCRF which makes the eDMS the source document for this information. These data include clinical data (including AE/SAEs, concomitant medications, physical assessments, and diaries) and laboratory data (NP results). These data will be entered into a [ADDRESS_948971] protection, automatic time/date stamp and internal quality checks, such as automatic range checks that occur in real time to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete or inaccurate. This will allow for ongoing and rapid query resolution and locking of the database at the close of the trial. Some limited additional information may need to be gathered from the EHR, in particular, as it relates to children who are seen by [CONTACT_105]-study providers and prescribed antibiotics while receiving study product. Clinical data from the off-site visits e.g., emergency department visits, participant primary care visit, etc., will be entered directly from the source documents. In this circumstance, the paper documents received from the provider will be considered the source documents.Types of Data Data for this study will include clinical, efficacy, safety, and laboratory data gathered in the eCRF. We will also obtain records of medical encounters at other facilities (if needed to document reasons for subject receiving another antibiotic during the study). 15.3 Timing/Reports Study data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_698965]. Safety summary reports may be generated for this purpose. An Interim Report for DSMB review will be prepared by [CONTACT_698966] [ADDRESS_948972] of two parts, corresponding to the open and closed sessions of the DSMB meeting, and include an assessment of the progress of the trial, including recommendations on whether it should continue or be terminated or modified. Only the DSMB members (and designated representatives from DMID) will receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_698903]. The reports will be sent by [CONTACT_698967] 14 business days prior to a scheduled meeting. Safety and efficacy results will be presented by [CONTACT_698968]-assigned labels for the two treatment groups. The Clinical Study Report will be completed when all primary and secondary endpoint data are available.

The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) member journals have adopted a trials-registration policy as a condition for publication.  This policy requires that all clinical trials be registered in a public trials registry such as ClinicalTrials.gov* (http://clinicaltrials.gov/), which is sponsored by [CONTACT_1055]. Other biomedical journals are considering adopting similar policies. The ICMJE defines a clinical trial as any research project that prospectively assigns human subjects to intervention or comparison groups to study the cause-and-effect relationship between a medical intervention and a health outcome. Studies designed for other purposes, such as to study pharmacokinetics or major toxicity (e.g., Phase I trials), would be exempt from this policy. For trials in which DMID is not the IND/IDE sponsor, or there is no IND/IDE, and DMID does not provide data management services, it is the responsibility of the investigator to register the trial and post results in compliance with Public Law 110-85, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA). Any clinical trial starting enrollment after [ADDRESS_948977] enrollment. For trials that began enrollment prior to this date, the ICMJE member journals will require registration by 13 September 2005, before considering the results of the trial for publication.

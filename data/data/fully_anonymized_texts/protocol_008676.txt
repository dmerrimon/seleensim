1.0 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
 
Summary  
 
Metastatic  prostate  cancer  is predominantly  bone -tropic,  and bone  metastases  result  in blood  
dyscrasias,  cord compression,  fracture,  pain,  neurologic  compromise,  and death.  New therapi[INVESTIGATOR_589772],  and many  novel  targeted  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  androgen  receptor (AR) -targeted  
treatmen ts, chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  vaccines,  immunologic  drugs  and immunotoxins  are currently  being  
tested.  Unfortunately,  drug development  and clinical  care for these  patients  is significantly  
hampered  by [CONTACT_589797],  which  is embedded  in the marrow  of the axial skeleton.  
 
Bone  scintigraphy  demonstrates reactive  bone  deposition  only and not the cancer itself.  Bone  
lesions  shown  on computerized  tomography  (CT) and plain radiographs  generally  only appear  as 
sclerotic  lesions  that bear no relation  to active  tumor size, nor can  these  methods distinguish  
between  the healing  effects  of successful  therapy  vs. the osteoblastic  response  of bone  to a 
tumor that  is continuing  to progress  on therapy.  
 
The lack of good  imaging  methods  hampers  decision  making  in terms  of when  to apply  or modify  
conventional  treatment  methods  as well as limiting  new drug development.   Accurate  imaging  
modalities  are particularly  needed  in the age of targeted  or biologic  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  where  effective  
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_589773] -specific  antigen  (PSA)  
declines.  In such  cases,  molecular  imaging  may be the only means  by [CONTACT_589798] a new drug may be detectable  in a Phase  I or Phase  II study.  Furthermore  when  targeted  
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_589774]  
“hit” or downregulated.  Many examples  of this target  selection  and monitoring  approach  exist.  
Examples  include  bone  scan  for selection  of radionuclide  therapy  with Sm-[ADDRESS_776920]  patients  for I-131 MIBG  therapy  or In-111/Ga -[ADDRESS_776921]  patients  for Y-90/Lu -177 Somatostatin  receptor therapy.  
 
The Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer Center (MSKCC)  Genitourinary  (GU) Oncology  Service   
has long collaborated  with the Nuclear  Medicine  Service  and the Department  of Radiology  to 
develop  novel  imaging  modalities for prostate  cancer.  Using  the MSKCC  clinical  states  model  
(Scher and  Heller  2000 ) as a template  for radiologic  investigations  as well as clinical  
investigations,  we have  established  a methodology  for exploring  positron  emission  tomography  
(PET)  in prostate  cancer  that controls  for clinical  state,  disease  progression,  scanning  algorithm,  
method  of interpretation,  data collection,  and data analysis.  Using  these  techniques,  we have  
demonstrated  that fluorine -18-fluorodeoxyglucose  (FDG)  PET can be used  to detect  disease  and 
demonstrate  treatment  effects  and that fluorinated  dihydrotestosterone  (FDHT)  PET can be used  
to detect  disease  and demonstrate  pharmacodynamic  effects  of AR-targeted  agents ( Morris,  
Akhurst  et al. 2002 ; Larson,  Morris  et al. 2004 ; Zanzonico,  Finn et al. 2004 ; Morris,  Akhurst  et al. 
2005 ). Furthermore  we have  collaborated  on imaging  and therapy  based  antibody  approaches  
targeting  Prostate  Specific  Membrane  Antigen  (PSMA).  These  approaches  have  shown  the 
feasibility  of using  an antibody to target  prostate  cancer  (Bander,  Trabulsi  et al. 2003 ; Nanus,  
Milowsky  et al. 2003 ; Milowsky,  Nanus  et al. 2004 ; Bander,  Milowsky  et al. 2005 ; Morris,  Divgi  et 
al. 2005 ; Morris,  Pandit -Taskar  et al. 2007 ; Pandit -Taskar,  Morris  et al. 2008 ). Currently  in 
collaboration with the chemistry  core we have  been  developi[INVESTIGATOR_589775] -89 (89Zr) , a positron - 
emitting  radionuclide,  labeled  to J591  has been  approved  by [CONTACT_1201] (protocol  #11-126) and [ADDRESS_776922]  been  accrued  thus far (up to 4-28-2012)  without  dose  limiting  toxicity.  J591  is an 
antibody  that recognizes  the external  domain  of prostate -specific  membrane  antigen.  Furthermore

 we have  prepared  clinical  grade  89Zr trastuzumab  and a protocol  is being  written.  Thus  we have  in 
place the technology  to develop  89Zr labeling  of antibodies  of interest.  
 
Six-transmembrane  epi[INVESTIGATOR_589776] -1 (STEAP1)   is a multi -transmembrane,  
cell-surface  antigen  of unknown  function  that is overexpressed  in 8 5% of human  epi[INVESTIGATOR_589777].  Genentech  has developed  an antibody,  MSTP2109A  that binds  to STEAP1.  
They  have  developed  an antibody  drug conjugate  (ADC)  DSTP3086S   that contains  the 
humanized  lgG1  anti-STEAP1  monoclonal  antibody  MSTP2109A  and a potent  anti-mitotic  
agent,  monomethyl  auristatin  E (MMAE),  linked  through  a protease -labile   linker,  
maleimidocaproyl -valine -citrulline -p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl  (MC-VC-PAB).  This reagent  is 
currently  in a phase  I therapeutic  multicenter  trial in which  MSKCC  is participating  (PI [INVESTIGATOR_589778],  MSKCC  11-016).  Therefore  it is desirable  to develop  an imaging  reagent that  
identifies  the presence  and intensity  of the target  by [CONTACT_589799].  In addition,  if the tracer  
appears  to identify  prostate  cancer metastases  effectively,  then it may further  be developed  as an 
imaging  biomarker for prostate  cancer  even  independent  of the specific  STEAP1 -targeted  
therapy.  
 
 
Schema  
 
Cohort  1A and 1B will each  have  the same  clinical  characteristics  and inclusion  criteria  
requirements.   Both sets of patients  will undergo  serial  pharmacokinetics  and serial  imaging  
exams  post 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  injection.  
 
Upon  the completion  of pharmacokinetics  and serial  imaging  (post  Cohort  1A), patients  will 
proceed  accordingly  based  upon tumor  detection  observed,  and whether  there  is suggestio n of 
antigen  sink or rapid  clearance  that affects  tumor imaging.  The difference  between  the 2  cohorts  
will be that 1A will receive  10 mg total of DFO -MSTP2109A  and if cohort  1B is necessary,  
because  criteria  described  above  of suboptimal  imaging  or pharmacokinetics,  patients  will receive  
20 mg total of DFO -MSTP2109A.    From   cohort  1A (10mg)   or 1B (20 mg), we will decide  what 
antibody  amount  (10 or 20 mg) is best and the optimal  time of image  acquisition.   Cohort [ADDRESS_776923] dose  determined  from cohort  1A or   
1B (10 or 20mg).  Furthermore,  they will not undergo  pharmacokinetics  and rather than serial  
imaging,  the patients will only have  one scan  at an optimal  time post injection  of antibody  
determined  from serial  imaging  of Cohort  1A and 1B.

3.0 BACKGROUND  AND  RATIONALE  
 
3.1 The Problem  Being  Addressed:  Limitations  of Conventional  Imaging  
Modalities  for Prostate  Cancer  Metastases  
 
Progressive  prostate  cancer  spreads  to bone  more  commonly  than to any other site,  yet 
monitoring  bone  metastases  to quantify  cancer regression  and progression  remains  
inconsistent  at best.  In addition,  a significant  percentage  of patients  have  soft tissue,  
predominant  nodal  disease.  The standard  Phase  II response  criteria  for solid tumors  do 
not apply,  and despi[INVESTIGATOR_589779],  
visualizing  of tumor spread  to bone  is still in the early stages  of development.  For 
example,  as seen  on plain radiographs,  when  prostate  cancer  spreads  to bone,  tumor  
growth  in the marrow  results  in osteoblastic  changes,  which,  in the end stage,  result  in the 
complete  replacement  of the marrow  space.  While  most  physicians  accept  that sclerotic  
healing  of a lytic lesion  constitutes  tumor regression,  sequential  monitoring  of lesions  that 
are initially sclerotic  is problematic  because  the bone  architecture  rarely  reverts  
histologically  back  to normal.  Even  if all tumor cells  are destroyed,  there  may be no visible  
changes  on standard  scans.  In these  cases,  only a direct  biopsy  can determine  if viable  
tumor  cells are present.  Other  imaging  modalities  have  significant  limitations  in identifying  
viable  tumor  as described  below.   Immunotherapy,  radioimmunotherapy  or antibody  drug 
conjugate  (ADC)  related  therapy are  dependent  on targeted  antigen  concentration.  While  
patients  may be selected  based  on antigen  expression  based  on tumor  biopsy,  this is an 
invasive  technique  and is limited  by [CONTACT_589800].  In contrast,  
using  a radiolabeled  antibody  approach  allows  one to non invasively select  patients  based  
on antigen  content  and allows  assessment  of multiple  tumor sites.

Imaging  modalities  in prostate  cancer  
 
3.1.[ADDRESS_776924]  measure  of cancer activity,  it reflects  
the reaction  of bone  to the surrounding  cancer.  In addition,  the common  occurrence  of 
the flare phenomenon  (a paradoxical  increase  in intensity  after successful  therapy)  
complicates  the interpretation  of scans  on a serial  basis.  
 
 
3.1.[ADDRESS_776925], magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI),  and the emerging  technology  of 
magnetic  resonance  spectroscopy  (MRS).  The utility  of each  of these  modalities  varies  
according  to the stage  of disease.  At present,  no modality  can distinguish  viable  
disease  from necrotic  or nonmalignant  tissue.  
 
CT is well suited  for detecting  soft tissue  disease,  but has limited  utility  in assessing  
early  changes  in bone.  CT is not sensitive  enough  to detect  small  volume  nodal  
disease  or tumor in  non enlarged  lymph  nodes.  CT also does  not effectively  evaluate  
disease  that is confined  to the prostate  and adjacent  area.  
 
MRI:  To provide  the most  accurate  assessment  in the region  of the prostate,  
neurovascular  bundles,  and seminal  vesicles,  MRI is considered  the modality  of 
choice.  In addition,  MRI can detect  soft tissue  disease  and is most  useful  to 
corroborate  bone  scintigraphy findings  (particularly  when  the earliest  involvement  is 
thought  to be present  in the bone  marrow).  MRI is most  sensitive  in the axial skeleton  
and pelvis,  and is less effective  in the ribs, chest  wall, and skull.  
 
 
3.2 Positron  Emission  Tomography  (PET)  
 
PET has advantages  over conventional  imaging  methods  because  it quantitatively  
assesses  biologic  processes  in vivo and can assess  different  processes  using  specific  
radiotracers.  Processes  that can be analyzed  with currently  available  reagents  include  
glucose  and amino  acid metabolism and  proliferation,  blood  flow, and receptor status  (i.e., 
androgen  receptor).  Most  studies  have focused  on the accumulation  of FDG.  
 
 
3.2.1  PET scanning  with fluorine -18-fluorodeoxyglucose  (FDG)  
 
During  the past decade,  investigators  at MSKCC  have  shown  that PET imaging  in 
prostate  cancer can  be tested  prospectively  using  rigorous,  carefully  controlled  
standard  clinical  trial designs  traditionally  reserved  for therapeutics  (Morris,  Akhurst  et 
al. 2002 ; Morris,  Akhurst  et al. 2005 ). The method  has been  to enroll  patients  
registered  in therapeutic  clinical  trials to the imaging  trials to undergo  imaging  in 
conjunction  with their treatment.

[IP_ADDRESS]  FDG  PET and bone  metastases  
 
Previous  studies  found  that the sensitivity  of FDG PET for detecting  metastases  
was poor.  However,  these  were  not prospective,  and the populations  studied  were  
not controlled  for progression,  clinical  state,  or type  of treatment  (Apolo,  Pandit - 
Taskar  et al. 2008 ). These  trials demonstrated  the need  for rigorous  controls  in 
prostate  cancer clinical  trials  of new tracers.  To that end, we examined  a uniform  
cohort  of patients  with progressive  metastatic  prostate  cancer.  We tracked  each  
bone  lesion  from inception  to progression,  starting  with 1 scan  before  baseline  and 
2 follow -up scans  after baseline,  if feasible.  FDG PET was sensitive  enough  to 
identify  active  disease  and distinguish  it from quiescent  or noncancerous  lesions  
(Morris,  Akhurst  et al. 2002 ). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  FDG  PET and evaluation  of treatment  effect  
 
In our prospective  study,  FDG  PET captured,  in a single  imaging  modality,  the 
information  usually  captured  by [CONTACT_589801],  
bone  scintigraphy,  and soft tissue  imaging.  Twenty -two patients  with castrate  
metastatic  prostate  cancer  registered  to clinical  trials  of anti-microtubule  
chemotherapy also  participated  in our imaging  study.  We followed  them to  either  
progression  or death.  After 4 weeks  of chemotherapy,  FDG  PET and PSA were  in 
agreement  in 86% of cases;  in 91% of cases,  FDG PET correctly  identified  
whether  the patient’s  disease  was progressing.  After  [ADDRESS_776926]  imaging  were  compared.  PET correctly  identified  the 
clinical  status  in 94% of cases.  These  data suggest  that FDG  PET,  when  studied  
prospectively  in a population  rigorously  controlled  for clinical  state  and disease  
progression,  can effectively  demonstrate  treatment  effects (Morris,  Akhurst  et al. 
2005 ). FDG  PET can demonstrate  marked  posttreatment  changes  in response  to 
chemothera py similar to PSA,  furnishes  information  regarding  tumor  metabolism,  
and demonstrates  antitumor effects  on a lesional  basis.  By [CONTACT_22242],  simultaneous  
bone  scintigraphy  demonstrates  no such  effects  and is nearly  useless  in 
demonstrating  post-treatment  changes.  
 
 
3.2.2  STEAP1  antigen  and MSTP2109A  antibody  
 
Six-transmembrane  epi[INVESTIGATOR_589776] -1 (STEAP1)   is a multi - 
transmembrane,  cell-surface  antigen  of unknown  function  that is overexpressed  
in  85%  of human  epi[INVESTIGATOR_589780],  and low and restricted  expression  
only in normal  prostate  tissue  (Hubert,  Vivanco  et al. 1999 ; Challita -Eid, Morrison  
et al. 2007 ). 
 
Genentech  has developed  a humanized  anti-STEAP1  monoclonal  lgG1  
antibody  MSTP2109A  that recognizes  this antigen.  An anti-mitotic  agent  
monome thyl auristatin  E (MMAE)  based  ADC  DSTP3086S  has been  developed  
by [CONTACT_8229],  and is currently  under clinical  evaluation  in a multicenter clinical  
trial in which  MSKCC  is participating.  The ADC  as a therapy  takes  advantage  of 
the targeting  capability  of the antibody  and the cytotoxic  activity  of MMAE,

 released  intracellularly,   resulting  in inhibition  of cell division  and growth,  and 
culminating  in cell death  (Doronina,  Toki et al. 2003 ; Francisco,  Cerveny et al. 
2003 ). It is anticipated  that presence  of the antigen  is a prerequisite  for tumor  
targeting  and delivery of  the toxic pay load.   We believe  that it would  be useful  to 
evaluate  a radiolabeled anti-STEAP1  antibody  to determine  the presence  and 
intensity  of target  antigen  on prostate  tumors,  in vivo. 
 
Both the anti-STEAP1  antibody,  MSTP2109A,  and its ADC  showed  similar  and 
high binding  activity (low nanomolar) to human  and cynomolgus  monkey  STEAP1  
but no binding  to rat or mouse  STEAP1  orthologues. The pharmacokinetics  and 
disposition   of unconjugated  antibody  and its ADC  are driven  mainly  by [CONTACT_237438]-STEAP1  antibody  component  and expected  to be similar  between  
antibody  and ADC.  
 
The pharmacokinetics  of anti-STEAP1  antibody,  MSTP2109A  and its conjugate  
DSTP3086A  were  linear  in both rats and non-tumor  bearing  mice,  as expected  for 
non-binding  species.  DSTP3086A  also demonstrated  linearity  in cynomolgus  
monkeys   (a binding  species)  over the tested  dose  range  i.e., 0.3-5.0 mg/kg),  
which  is expected  given  the non-detectable  level of STEAP1  expression   in normal  
tissues.  
 
MSTP2109A  has been  used  in humans  as the targeting  moiety  of an antibody  drug 
conjugate  (ADC  DSPT3086S)  that is being  used  in a Phase  [ADDRESS_776927]  antibody  MSTP2109A   has not been  used  in humans.  Safety  
data in non-human  primates  and rodent  are available for both the antibody  
MSTP2109A  and the antibody drug conjugate  DSPT3086S.   Anti-STEAP1  antibody  
MSTP2109A  was included  in non-GLP toxicity  studies  in both Sprague -Dawley rats 
and in cynomolgus  monkeys.  Single  doses  of 60 mg/kg  MSTP2109A  in rats and 2 
doses  every  3 weeks  of 24 mg/kg  MSTP2109A  exhibited  no toxicologically  
significant  changes compared  to vehicle  control.  
 
The primary  safety  signal  identified  for the anti-STEAP1  ADC  DSTP3086S  in 
cynomolgus  monkeys  and rats was bone  marrow  toxicity,  specifically  dose - 
dependent,  reversible  neutropenia.  The toxicity  findings  with the ADC  were  
consistent  with the mechanism   of action  (microtubule  inhibition)  of the cytotoxic  
component  (MMAE)  of DSTP3086S,  and were  considered  to be MMAE  specific  
and independent  of STEAP1  target.  
 
A toxicity  study  in mice  using  our DFO -MSTP2109A formulation  at 50 mg/kg  did not 
show  toxicity  ( no observable  effect  level).  
 
The drug conjugate  DSTP3086S  has been  used  in 26 patients  as of 08/22/2012  as 
part of an ongoing Phase  I multi -center  clinical  trial - MSKCC  protocol 11 -016. 
Currently,  enrollment  is occurring at 2.8 mg/kg.  Only  two DLT have  been  observed  
consisting  of transaminitis  at the 2.25 mg/kg,  and elevated liver  enzymes  in a 
patient  treated  at a dose  level  of 2.8 mg/kg.  Reversible liver  toxicity  was observed  
in pre-clinical assessments  with DSTP3086A and  likely  represents  toxicity  
attributable  to the drug conjugate  Otherwise,  treatments  have  been very  well 
tolerated  with very  mild side effects  possibly  related  to treatment  such  as Gr1 
hypotension  constipation  or diarrhea.  Other  89Zr-labeled  antibodies  have  been  used  
in patients  with good  tumor  localization  and tolerated  well (Borjesson,  Jauw  et al. 
2006 ; Borjesson,  Jauw  et al. 2009 ; Dijkers,  Munnink  et al. 2010 ). As of date, the  
protocol  conti nues  to accrue.

[IP_ADDRESS]  89Zirconium  
89Zr is an attractive  metallo -radionuclide  for use in immuno -PET due to favorable  
decay  characteristics.  It has a 78.4h  half life and a 22.7%  positron  yield.  
 
Standardized  methods  for the routine  production  and isolation  of high-purity  and 
high-specific -activity  89Zr using  a small  cyclotron are  reported.  Optimized  cyclotron  
conditions  reveal  high average  yields  of 1.52 ± 0.11 mCi/muA*h  at a proton  beam  
energy  of 15 MeV and current  of 15 muA using  a solid,  commercially available  89Y- 
foil target  (0.1 mm, 100%  natural  abundance).  89Zr was isolated  in high 
radionuclidic  and radiochemical  purity  (>99.99%)  as (89Zr)Zr -oxalate  by [CONTACT_2329]  a 
solid-phase  hydroxamate  resin  with >99.5% recovery of the radioactivity.  The 
effective specific  activity  of 89Zr was found  to be in  the range  of 5.28 −13.43  
mCi/microg  (470 −1195  Ci/mmol)  of zirconium.  
 
New methods  for the facile  production  of (89Zr) Zr-chloride  are reported.  
Radiolabeling  studies  using  the trihydroxamate  ligand  desferrioxamine  B (DFO)  
gave  100% radiochemical  yields  in <15 min at room temperature,  and in vitro

 (Divgi,  Pandit -Taskar et  al. 2007 ). The pharmacokinetic  analysis  in a clinical  trial that 
used  2, 5, 10, 25 and 50 mg of I-131 cG250  showed  that at the 2  mg dose  levels  there  
was faster clearance  but at all other  levels  there  was no dose  response  with a median  
T1/2 of 68.5 h. When doses  of 25 and 50 mg of cG250  were  administered  there  was 
less tumor uptake  than at the 10 mg dose  (Steffens,  Boerman  et al. 1997 ). Humanized  
antibody  hPAM4  specifically  binds  a mucin  glycoprotein  expressed  in pancreatic  
adenocarcinomas.  A clinical  trial using  In-111 hPAM4   showed  good targeti ng and 
similar  pharmacokinetics  of doses  ranging  from < 10 mg compared  to 100 mg (Gulec,  
Cohen  et al. 2011 ) with T1/2 of 91.2h.  An ongoing  clinical  trial using  I-124 GC33  
humanized  antibody  in patients  with hepatocellular  carcinoma,  being  perfor med at 
MSKCC  by [CONTACT_589802] -Alfa and Jorge  A. Carrasquillo  has shown  good  targeting  at 
doses  of 10 mg (unpublished  observation).  In contrast,  at considerably  higher  doses  of 
GC33  (390 mg) tumor uptake  was significantly  blocked,  down  to 1/3 of that seen  with 
the 10 mg dose  (SUV  21versus  7). Therefore  it is expected  that antibodies that have  
little cross  reactivity  with normal  tissue  will exhibit  favorable  pharmacokinetic  for tumor  
imaging  with mass  amount  of approximately [ADDRESS_776932]  pi[INVESTIGATOR_589783] 89Zr  labeled  antibodies  and its successful  use in patients  
has been  reported  (Borjesson,  Jauw  et al. 2006 ; Dijkers,  Munnink  et al. 2010 ). It is well 
known  that for antibodies  that internalize  there  is significant  improved  retention  of radio  
metals  compared  to Iodinated  antibodies  (Naruki,  Carrasquillo  et al.  1990 ). 89Zr has an 
ideal  half-life that is well matched  to the half life of intact  IgG. Correlating  STEAP1  
tumor targeting  with the response  to DSTP3086S may allow  for optimal  patient  
selection.  Furthermore  from this  study  we will determine  the ability  of 89Zr-DFO - 
MSTP2109A  to identify  metastatic  castrate  resistant  prostate  cancer.  This may allow  us 
to perform future  studies  to phenotype  the cancer (FDG,  PSMA,  STEAP1  and

reactivity  with normal  tissues  in vivo (Divgi,  Pandit -Taskar et  al. 2007 ; Carrasquillo,  Pandit - 
Taskar  et al. 2011 ). Nonetheless,  since  no pharmacokinetic  or imagi ng studies  have  been  
performed  with 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A,  initial  studies  must  determine  an acceptable  mass  
for imaging.  In order to streamline  antibody  mass  selection,  initial  Cohort  1A patients  (up  
to 6 in cohort) will receive  10 mg of 89Zr  -DFO -MSTP2109A  and will undergo  
pharmacokinetics  and serial  imaging.  Decision  of whether  to study  a second  cohort,   
Cohort  1B,  at a higher  dose  (20 mg) will be based  predominantly  on the basis  of whether  
adequate  tumor targeting  is observed  (tumor detection  in >75% of STEAP1  positive  
patients).  As secondary  measure  we will evaluate  for unexpected  normal  organ  
accumulation,  based  on PET imaging  and evidence  of rapid  plasma  clearance  based  on 
pharmacokinetic  parameters  and tumor targeting.  If adequate  tumor targeting  is achieved  
we will use the starting  dose  of 10 mg in patients  enrolled  in Cohort  2. The absence  of 
antigen  sink may be confirmed  if pharmacokinetics  show  Vd of less than 3 times  plasma  
volume,  T1/2 is greater  than 50 h and if visually  there  is no binding  to normal  tissues above  
that expected  from blood  pool.   If there  is suggestion  of antigen  sink, and           
inadequate  tumor  targeting,  we will evaluate  an additional  6 patients  who will receive  total 
dose  of 20 mg (Cohort  1B). The patients  in Cohort  1B also will undergo  pharmacokinetics,  
imaging  and whole  body  measurements  as outlined for the 10 mg cohort  in section  9.0.

will have  serial  blood  samples  drawn.   Blood  samples  will be obtained  in green  top tube:  
• Just prior to injection of 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  (baseline)  
• Approximately 5 ± 2, 15 ± 5, 30 ± 9, 60 ± 19, and 120 to 240 minutes  after 
injection  of the tracer.  
• One sample  at the time of each  subsequent  day of imaging  (24 + 8h, ~48-96h 
and ~[ADDRESS_776945] injection).  
 
 
These  data are used  to determine  the time-activity  curves  for plasma  (% injected  
dose/liter).   Blood  is centrifuged,  and the plasma pi[INVESTIGATOR_589785].   Samples may be 
tested  for breakdown  products  by [CONTACT_589809].  Blood  will also be aliquoted  for 
sampling,  if in the first 3 patients  no binding  is observed  to blood  elements  only plasma  
sampling  will be counted  in subsequent  patients.  
 
For each  blood  sample,  4-6 mL of blood  will be drawn  in green  top tubes.  
 
Patients  in Cohort  2 will undergo  injection  and 1 imaging  session,  but no pharmacokinetics  
will be performed.

89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  
Radiolabeling  of 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A:  The DFO -MSTP2109A  will be labeled  in 
accordance  with the MSKCC  investigator sponsored IND.  The study  will be performed  
under  an FDA approved  IND for 89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A,  no studies  will be performed  until 
the IND is approved.   The final product  will contain  up to [ADDRESS_776946]  been  brought  
up to desired  total antibody  quantity  (e.g. 10 or 20  mg) of DFO -MSTP2109A  by [CONTACT_589810]-MSTP2109A  as outlined  in the design  section.   The product  will have  met 
the release  criteria  specified  in the IND. Immunoreactivity   and sterility  assays  will be 
performed  post release.  
 
The investigational  product  label  will include  the patient  name,  MRN  and the calibration  
date and time.  The investigational  product  is to be used  within  8 hours  of manufacturing.  
 
PET scanning:  In order to provide  reproducible  clinical  data,  we will acquire  all 89Zr-DFO - 
MSTP2109A  PET scans  on the GE PET-CT scanner  DSTE  at MSKCC  or the same  or a 
newer  generation  scanner.  Once  a study  is begun  in one scanner,  it will be continued  on 
the same  scanner unless  malfunction/emergency  issues  prevent  this.  Intravenous  
injection  of 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A (maximum  of 5 mCi ± 10%) will be given  over 5-15 
minutes.   Initially  we will start with ~ 5 mCi of 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A;  the activity may be 
adjusted  downward  based  on visual  review  of image  quality.   A PET-CT scan  extending  
from top of skull to mid thighs  will be performed  to determine  the biodistribution.  The low 
dose  CT portion  of the 89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A  on the first day will utilize  80 mA (low mA) 
and on subsequent  days,  we will use [ADDRESS_776947]  5 other  lesions  are not identified  
in the torso.  
 
Active  lesions   will be identified  (Nuclear Medicine  investigator  and MM) based  on 
conventional  images  and those  thought  to represent  active  disease  based  on review of the 
patients  conventional  images  and treatment  history  (ie external  radiation)  will be 
considered  as lesions  for determination  of antibody  localization.  A lesion   will be 
considered  present  if there  is greater  localization  than that expected  based  on blood  pool 
distribution  of the tracer.   Given  that at present  we do not know  the heterogeneity  of the 
antigen  between  lesions or  between  primary  and metastatic  disease  a patient  will be 
considered positive  if any  of the active  lesions  are identified  with the 89Zr-DFO - 
MSTP2109A  . We will, nonetheless  tabulate  the number of lesions  and their status  based  
on 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A.  When  pathologic  material  that has been evaluated  for the 
presence  of STEAP1  is available  for any specific  lesion,  we will correlate  the presence  of 
STEAP1  with imaging  results.  
 
Patients  in Cohort  1A (and if performed  Cohort  1B) will also have  imaging  at [ADDRESS_776948]-injection  to allow  for selection  of optimal  imaging  time and dosimetry  determination.  
For these  patients,  top of skull to mid thigh  scans will be acquired:  
 
• Within  one to four hours  following  injection  of tracer  on Day 1 
• ~24 ± 8hours  post-injection  (Day  2) 
• ~48−[ADDRESS_776949]-injection  (once  during  Days  3−5) 
• ~120 −[ADDRESS_776950] injection  (once  during  Days  6−8)

11.0 TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
Risks  
 
89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  PET/CT  Scans  
As part of this scan  there  is radiation  delivered from the 89Zr and from the  low dose  CT scan  that 
are performed  as part of the CT for attenuation  correction  and co-registration.  Although  any 
exposure  to ionizing  radiation  has the potential  to cause  some  harm to tissue,  the radiation  
exposures  in this study  are comparable  to the low-level exposures  associated  with common  
diagnostic  procedures  such  as CT scanning.  There  remains  a low theoretical  risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  a 
cancer  at some  point  later in life as a result  of the radiation  exposure  received  in this study.  This 
risk is particularly  low for adults  given  the fact that the radiation  from the scans  will be over 
several  weeks.  Participants  should  not father a baby [CONTACT_120175].  Acceptable  birth control  
methods  include  abstinence,  double  barrier method,  surgically  sterilized  patient  or partner.  This 
risk is much  smaller that  the clinical  risks posed  by [CONTACT_102]’s  current  cancer.  
 
DFO -MSTP2109A  
 
Potential  risks associated  with DFO -MSTP2109A  are similar to those  of other  humanized  
antibody  and include  allergic  reactions,  characterized  by [CONTACT_411],  chills,  and sometimes  rashes  or 
hives.   Less  likely  shortness  of breath  can occur.  Rare  allergic  reactions  can present  as shock  or 
death  or swelling  of the throat.  Such  reactions  are usually  addressed  by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_589788],  administering  steroids,  acetaminophen  and/or diphenhydramine,  and 
restarting  the drug at a slower  rate if the reaction  is not severe.  
 
There  is a very small  risk of infection.  This could  cause  itching  or redness  at the area on the 
patient’s  arm where  the IV was placed.  89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  tracer

 Radiation  Dosimetry  
 
Normal -organ  radiation  absorbed  doses  and the effective dose  for 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  in 
human  were  estimated  based  on measured  time-activity  data in mice.  The time-activity  data 
(percent  of the injected  dose  per gram (%ID/gm)  versus  time (t) post -administration)  for each  
organ  were fit to an exponential  functions  and the resulting  function  were  analytically integrated  
(incorporating  the radioactive  decay  of 89Zr) to yield the residence  time (cumulated  activity)  of 89Zr 
in each  organ.  The mouse organ  89Zr residence  times  were  converted  to 89Zr residence  times  in 
human  organs  (for the 70-kg Standard  Man anatomic  model)  by [CONTACT_589811].  The resulting  human  residence  times  were  
then entered  into the OLINDA/EXM  radionuclide  dosimetry  program,  which  implements  the MIRD  
(Medical  Internal  Radionuclide  Dosimetry)  algorithm,  to yield the normal -organ  radiation  absorbed  
doses  (in rad) and effective  dose  (in rem) for 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A in  man.   Assuming  a 5-mCi 
administered  activity  of 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  and a low-dose  (80 mA) and three  very-low-dose  
(10-mA) CT scans  are to be performed,  with approximate  CT effective  doses  of 0.[ADDRESS_776972]  (OLINDA)

12.0 CRITERIA  FOR  THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
 
Positive lesions  on 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  will be defined  visually as a focus  of  accumulation  of 
radioactivity  that is deemed  to not be physiologic  and is higher than  adjacent  or contralateral  
background.   Antibody  scan  will be read blinded from clinical  history  and conventional  imaging  
modalities. Two  different  experienced,  blinded  readers  will visually analyze  the 89Zr-DFO - 
MSTP2109A  scans,  and SUVmax/mean  will be determined  in lesions  identified  and in normal  
organs  and blood  pool.  To study  the accumulation  and biodistribution  of 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  in 
patients  with progressive  prostate  cancer,  the accumulation of 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  will be 
assessed  for each  site and compared  with the baseline  radionuclide  bone scan,  FDG PET/CT,  
CT, and/or  MRI imaging.  The definition  of a positive  lesion  will be a lesion  identified  by [CONTACT_589812]/MRI,  bone  scan,  and/or  FDG  scan  consistent  
with metastatic  disease,  as is currently  done  clinically.   Lesions  on 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  or 
conventional  imaging  will be read in a scale  of 1 to 5, 1= negative,  2 = probably negative,  3= not  
sure,  4= probably  positive  and 5= definitively  positive.  Once  this is done,  a consensus  master  list 
of lesions  will be created  that compares  all imaging  conventional  imaging  modalities(CT/MRI,  
FDG  PET,  bone  scan),  only those  lesions  that are conspi[INVESTIGATOR_589789]  (i.e., “4 or 5”) by  
[CONTACT_589813] a positive  site of disease.  Discrepant  findings  between  findings  on 
conventional imaging  and 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  modalities  will be considered  false  positive  or 
false  negative.   Although  it would  be ideal  to biopsy  any site that is considered  abnormal  this is 
not logistically  feasible  or ethically  acceptable.  Successful  imaging  will be considered  a sensitivity  
of detection  of > 75% of patients  that are STEAP1  positive.   One or 2 non-blinded  readers  
(access  to clinical,  laboratory  and imaging  data) will identify  “positive  lesions” .

lesion  by [CONTACT_240765].  Sensitivity  and specificity  of the imaging  modalities  will be compared  in those  
patients  receiving  the better/”adequate”  antibody  mass.  The “better/adequate” dose  is defined  as 
that which  will allow  us to visualize  the targeted  number of lesions  defined  and will consist  of 
either  10 or 20  mg of DFO -MSTP2109A  antibody.  
 
12.1 Bone  Scan  
 
Each  lesion  will be evaluated  using  the same  5-point  scale.  These  findings  will be 
compared  with that of 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  PET scanning.  
 
Any discrepant  reading  of the antibody  images  or conventional   images  will require  review  
of the images  by [CONTACT_589814]  a consensus,  if a consensus  
cannot  be reached  the finding  shall be considered  “not sure” and  categorized  as negative.

imaging tool  to compare  to results  of 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A PET scanning.  Sensitivity  of 
89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A PET scanning  to detect  lesions  will be compared  with routine  
imaging  including  CT, MRI, FDG  PET,  and bone  scans.  Furthermore  soft tissue  lesions  
greater  than [ADDRESS_776978]  inform  the investigator immediately.  In 
addition,  the investigator  has the right to terminate  participation  of any patient  at any time if it is 
deemed  in the patient’s  best interest.  The reason and  circumstances  for premature  
discontinuation  will be documented  in the patient’s  medical  records.  Possible  examples for 
reasons  of premature  study withdrawal  include  withdrawal  of consent,  SAE or intolerable  AE, or 
any other medical  illness  at investigator’s  discretion.  
 
14.1 BIOSTATISTICS  
 
14.2 Primary  Objective  
 
The primary  objective  of this protocol  is to determine  the feasibility,  safety  and tolerability  
of single  dose  administration of 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  antibody.  
A patient  with STEAP1  positive  tumor will be considered  antibody -imaging -positive  if 20% 
or more  of the active  lesions  are detectable  (STEAP1  positivity  is an eligibility  criterion  for 
protocol  11-016 which forms  the basis  of eligibility  for this protocol;  see section  6 for 
details).  Active  lesion  means  any lesion  that was identified  by [CONTACT_589815].  We have  selected  a low threshold  of  20% for this 
first imaging  study  for 3 reasons:  1) we do not know  what the heterogeneity  of antigen  
expression  is within  a number of lesions  in the same  patient;  2) we will consider  positive  
any lesion  based  on conventional  clinical  imaging  criteria,  in which  case  some  lesions  
considered  positive  may be false positive  and more  importantly  3) our main  emphasis  is to 
evaluate whether  patients  whose  tumor  images  are positive  with 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  
are more  likely  to have  a response  to the antibody  based  drug conjugate  used  under  
MEMORIAL  SLOAN -KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER

Amended:  09/02/[ADDRESS_776979]  this agent  if we can use it as a 
theranostic  (defined as  an agent  that is integrated  into the drug development  process  so 
as to guide  patient  selection  and drug development)  for the development  of the antibody  
base  drug conjugate  being  used  under  protocol  11-016. Nonethe  less, we intend  to 
evaluate   treatment  response  of all available  lesions  in this way we will maximize  our 
ability  to determine  the relationship  between  uptake  of antibody  and response.  
 
If, for any patient,  there  is evidence  of an “antigen  sink” based  on rapid  clearance  < 50 h or Vd>3  
times  plasma  volume,  we will consider  a patient  antibody -imaging -positive  if 20% or more  of the 
active  lesions  are visualized.  The presence  of an “antigen  sink” may  bind a significant  amount  of 
antibody  and make  less available  for binding  to tumor.  
 
Antibody  imaging  will be considered  feasible  if 75% of the patients  are antibody -imaging -positive  
as defined  above..We  will enroll  6 patients  (cohort  1A) at the 10mg  dose  level for an initial  decision  
on feasibility.  If [ADDRESS_776980]  20% or  more  of their active  lesions  detectable    
by 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  then we will consider the agent  feasible  for imaging,                  
otherwise  we will proceed  to cohort  1B. If the true feasibility  rate is 40%,  this rule will affords  more  
than 82% chance  that cohort  1B will be opened  for enrollment;  this probability is less than 17% if 
the true feasibility  is 75%.  We will also require  that none  of these  patients  experience  dose  severe  
toxicity  attributable  to the initial  [ADDRESS_776981]  (grade  3 or 4 CTCAE)  is observed  in any cohort  we will review  with 
MSKCC -DSMC  and IRB before  continuing  with accrual.  If  3 patients  in cohort  1A do no not show  
acceptable  imaging,  as described  above,  we will proceed  to cohort  1B. 
 
In cohort  1B, 6 more  patients  will be enrolled  at a higher dose  (20mg)  for safety  and 
pharmacokinetic  evaluation.   Serial  blood  draws  will be used  to estimate  the pharmacokinetic  
profile of the 10 and 20mg  89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  in this  patient  population.  Pharmacokinetic  
analysis  will be performed  using  a non-compartmental  analysis;  standard  parameters  such  as 
AUC,  clearance,  volume of  distribution,  and Co will be reported.  Descriptive  statistics  will be 
tabulated.  If [ADDRESS_776982] imaging  dose

Based  on pharmacokinetic  analysis  from cohorts  1A and 1B an optimal  time point  (based  visually  
on optimal  image  quality  for tumor detection  and clinically/logistically  feasible)  will be determined  
for imaging  and cohort  [ADDRESS_776983]  tumors  will be estimated  from this cohort using  the proportion  
of antibody -imaging -positive  patients (within  +/-22% if the true detection  rate is 75%).  
 
This study  does  not intend  to find the maximal  tolerated  dose  of DFO-MSTP2109A.  This is a 
diagnostic  agent  that is expected  to have  low incidence  of adverse  events.   Patients  will be 
monitored  closely  looking  for evidence  of adverse  events.   Because  patients  will likely  start new

following  primary  safety  outcome  measures:  Incidence  and nature  of incidence,  nature,  and 
severity  of adverse  events;  and change  in vital signs  and clinical  laboratory  results.  Incidence  and

16.3 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The data and safety  monitoring  (DSM)  plans  at MSKCC  were  approved  by [CONTACT_589816] 2001.  The plans  address  the policies  set forth by [CONTACT_589817] , which  can be found  at  
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/clinicaltrials . The DSM  plans  at MSKCC  were  established  
and are monitored  by [CONTACT_40138].  The MSKCC  DSM  plans  can be 
found  on the MSKCC  Intranet  at: http://mskweb5.mskcc.org/intranet/html/[ZIP_CODE].cfm . 
 
There  are severa l different  mechanisms  by [CONTACT_46463],  
safety,  and quality.  There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  
protocol  monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits,  therapeutic  response,  and 
staff education  on clinical  research  quality  assurance)  and departmental  procedures  for 
quality  control,  and there  are two institutional  committees  that are responsible  for 
monitoring  the activities  of our clinical  trials programs.  The committees:  Data  and Safety  
Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for Phase  I and II clinical  trials,  and the Data and Safety  
Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III clinical  trials,  report  to the MSKCC  Research  
Council  and Institutional  Review  Board.  
 
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each  protocol  will be assessed  for 
its level of risk and degree  of monitoring  required.  Every  type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH 
sponsored,  in-house  sponsored,  industrial  sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) will be 
addressed,  and the monitoring  procedures  will be established  at the time of protocol  
activation.  
 
For this  protocol,  we will use the following  patient  safety  monitoring  plan and monitoring   
for adverse  events,  in terms  of the test performed  and their timing  relative  to injection  (see 
Table  1 and 2).  Patient  will be observed  closely  during  infusion  and serial  vital signs  will 
be monitored  every  half hour for at least  2 h or later if the patient  remains  in the 
department.  Patients  will be queried  for adverse  events  up to 6-8 days after infusion.  
 
Safety  reviews  will be performed  by [CONTACT_331127] -DSMC  with yearly review  by [CONTACT_1201].

17.1 PROTECTION  OF HUMAN  SUBJECTS  
 
This study  will be conducted  in compliance  with the protocol,  GCP  guidelines  established  by [CONTACT_589818],  and the ethical  standards  set forth in the Declaration  of 
Helsinki  2004  (available  at: www.laakariliitto.fi/e/ethics/helsinki.html ). 
 
A limited  waiver  of authorization  will be utilized  to effectively  screen  and track  patients  in screening,  
however  the recruitment  process  outlined  presents  no more  than minimal  risk to the privacy  of the 
patients  who are screened  and minimal  protected  health  information  (PHI)  will be maintained  as part  
of a screening  log. 
 
This protocol  does  not have  therapeutic  intent  and does  not offer patients  therapeutic  benefit.  This 
will be clearly  conveyed  to patients  when  communicating  the potential  toxicities/side  effects  of 
participating  in this trial. Participation  in the trial is voluntary  and there  will be no financial  benefit  (or 
burden)  for the patients.  Participants  will not be charged  for 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  PET scans,  
whole  body  probe  counts,  radiotracer  drugs,  extra  blood  draws  (to measure  radiotracer activity),  and 
optional  biopsies.  
 
17.2 Privacy  
 
MSKCC’s  Privacy  Office  may allow  the use and disclosure  of protected  health  information  
pursuant  to a completed  and signed  Research  Authorization  form.  The use and disclosure  of

exposures,  given  the number of clinical  studies  (CT, bone  scan,  FDG  scan)  and that 
many  of these  patients  will have  had primary  radiation  to their prostate  or external  beam  
radiation  to bone.  
 
When  accounting  for many  tests  per year,  the radiation  doses  (on the order  of 10 rem) lie 
well within  the “low-dose”  range —well below  the threshold  doses  (typi[INVESTIGATOR_589793] 
100 rem or greater)  for any known  deterministic  effects.  A detailed  description  of the 
expected dosimetry  from the 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  is included  (Table 3).  The dose  of 
89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A per administration  (~5mCi)  gives  the lowest  amount  that would  be 
consistent  with the research  goal,  namely,  biodistribution,  metabolism,  and 
pharmacokinetics  of the compound.  
 
17.3.2  Grading  Severity  
 
All adverse  events  will be graded  for intensity  on a scale  of 0 to 5. Severity grades  will be 
recorded  and based  on the  CTCAE  v4.0.

The investigator  will evaluate  the potential  relationship  between  all clinical  AEs,  abnormal  
laboratory  values,  and the 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A,  and categorize  the relationship  
according  to the descriptions  in Table  5. Abnormal  laboratory  values  of clinical  
significance  that were  present  at baseline  and did not change  in either severity  or 
frequency  during  the experimental  therapy  or intervention  and/or that  can obviously be 
attributed  to the underlying  disease  will be evaluated  by [CONTACT_589820] “unrelated”  category.

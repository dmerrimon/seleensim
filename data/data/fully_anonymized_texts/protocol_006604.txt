Four dime nsional compute d tomogr aphic imag ing (4DCT ) will be used to determine  lung 
tissue elasticity , as required for venti lation . Lung tissue ela sticity maps at 3 months after 
RT will be compared to those prior to RT , and used to quantify the change in the lung 
elasticity maps . Reduced lung tissue elasticity is defined in this study as a >6% reduction 
in expansion when compar ed to the baseline; the  amount of lung tissue showing a >6% 
reduction is the metric for our primary endpoint, and will be tested for a signif icant 
difference betwee n the two arms.  
1.2. Secondary Objectives  
1. Characterize and correlate temporal changes in lung tis sue elasticity with deliv ered 
radiation doses to anatomical and functional regions within the thorax .  
2. Quantify global changes following radi ation therapy  (RT)  for lung c ancer, including 
those observed from Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) and inflammation markers in 
blood plasma for subjects who voluntary consent to provide their blood. These too 
will be correlated with the delivered radiation doses to anatomical and fu nctional 
regions within the thorax, and with the maps of post-radiation therapy changes in lung 
tissue elasticit y. 
3. Quantify the repeatability of 4DCT based measures of lung tissue elasticity to demonstrate the changes following ra diation therapy are gre ater than the expected 
variation from the procedure itself and determine the expected variance in 
longitudinal studie s. 
2. BACKGROUND  
2.1. Lung Cancer and Current Therapy  
In the year 2015, over 221,200 new cases of lung cancer were diagnosed and 158,040 
deaths wer e attr ibuted to this disease. [1] Of these, approximate ly 13% are  small cell lung 
cancer s with the remainder being non- small cell lung cancer. [1] Treatm ent can involve 
combina tions of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy (both conventional and 
hypo- fractionation) .[2] 
Radiation thera py is typi[INVESTIGATOR_793961] 45 and 70 Gy. This depends upon the extent of disease, t he number of 
fractions, and the daily delivery technique (once daily versus twice daily).  Small cell 
cancers, ho wever, represent the minority  of treatments for lung cancer  and employ 
different treatment schema.  
Radiation  therapy f or non- small cell lung cancer  is dependent upon operative status of the 
patient. Those patients treated primarily w ith surgery have radiat ion and chemotherapy 
post- operatively as determined by [CONTACT_793981]. [2] 
Those with slightly more advanced disease are treated with neoadjuvant concomitant 
chemoradiotherapy. The pre -operative radi ation dose is typi[INVESTIGATOR_793962] [ADDRESS_1094807] limited disease but 
poor pulmonary function (limiting the ir operative status). These patients are being treated 
with stereotactic radiosurgery (ge nerally 3 -5 fractions and t otal dose from 36-60 Gy).  
This same approach is being used for a number of other patients with recurren t lung 
cancer or metastatic disease in the lung.  
In conclusion, a majority of patients receive radiation therapy as a component of their 
lung cance r management and the tolerance to this irradiation is limited by [CONTACT_793982] (o r its pote ntial) on lung function. W hile tolerance of lung to 
radiation is generally considered to be [ADDRESS_1094808] of radiation therapy across lung function globally that takes i nto account the 
biomechanical principles that are critical for lung function.  
 
Radiation Side Effects  
Radiat ion to the  tumor and nodal target s (commonl y hilar and mediastinal) is complicated 
by [CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_64947]. This requires a larger area of normal lung and mediastinal tissue to 
be treated to ensure that these targets are within the treatment beams used to deliver the 
dose. Additionally, lung t umors require radiation doses far in excess of the tolerance of 
normal lung tissue. Common toxicities include ra diation pneumonitis, radiation fibrosis, 
and ultimately altered respi[INVESTIGATOR_14008]. Dose escalation studie s show a clear increase 
in tumor con trol with increasing radiation dose for primary lung tumors, but that toxicity 
also increased with dose. Quantif ication of lung function after radiotherapy has been 
limited although recognition of its significance is app arent. Spi [INVESTIGATOR_793963] h ave been shown to be altered following radiotherapy.  
In particular, radiation pneumonitis has been loose ly correlated to the fraction of the 
volume of lung irradiated[3] to doses of 10 – 50 Gy.[4 -7] The volume of lung receiving 
20 Gy or more has a good correlatio n with radiation pneumonit is in some studies, [3, 5, 8]  
but not in others.[9, 10]  The mean radiation dose to the lung has also provided conflicting 
results, showin g good[3, 7, 11]  and poor correlation between a mean dose > 20 Gy and 
radiation pne umonitis. [6, 12]  All of these analyses ignore two factors we believe to be 
important: 1) the spatia l distribution of pulmonar y function within the lung is unlikely to 
be uniform, so the spatial location of the radiation dose matters, and 2) the changes in 
lung function may be caused by [CONTACT_793983], where 
changes occur in regions of the lung rec eiving what is currently believed to be “sub 
toxic” doses due to toxic doses in neighboring tissues. Fundamentally,  we do not know 
the cause of this indirectly produced reduced lung function.  
2.2. Preliminary Study and Rational e 
The relationship between radiat ion dose and normal lung tissue toxicity has been 
thoroughly investigated since CT based planning became commonplac e over a decade 
ago,[6] yet the clear indicators for toxicity remain elusive .[7, 13-20] It has been broadly 
accepted that radiation dose has a direct effect on treated lung tis sue and the lung in the 
treatment field shows radiographic changes consistent with fibros is.[21] It is largely 
 
[ADDRESS_1094809] dose/volume relationships 
with treated lung.[6, 16, 22, 23] 
The present treatment -planning dosi metry constraints for the lung are based on studies 
that assume lung tissue is homogeneous in its response to toxicity, irrespective of its 
location or underlying function. Furthermore, it is well known lung function is not  
distributed uniformly, especiall y in diseased lungs.[24, 25]  Because most patients with 
lung cancer have a history of smoking or other lung disease it is clear that a majority of patients will have other underlying lung issues such as chronic obs tructive pulmonary 
disease. This will further exacerbate this anatomically relevant heterogeneity of lung 
function. 
No human studies have investigated the relationships between local lung function, spatial 
radiation dose distribution, and radiati on induced lung function changes. However, rat 
studies are investigating changes in pulmonary function based on irradiation of different regions of rat lung. Luijk et al. showed structural changes in rat lung were only correlated with changes in breathing rate when irradiating lateral lung regions (shielding the 
mediastinum), [26] and then that greater lung damage was observed when irradiating the 
heart [27] while holding mean lung dose and volume of lung irradiated constant. They’ve 
also shown irradiation of larger volumes to smaller doses c auses greater toxicity than 
treating smaller volumes to larger doses, [28] a result confirmed by [CONTACT_2312].[29] A com mon 
yet unspecified thread in the rat studies is radiation treatments including the mediastinum caused a greater change in pulmonary function. The reasons for these findings is 
mechanistically undefined.  
 
Our preliminary d ata is a 
retrospective analysis o f 
in human subjects 
(University of Iowa IRB 
200805754 from the 
University of Iowa ). 
Using 4DCT and image 
registration, we examined 
the amount of lung expansion (function) in 
irradiated and non -
irradiated lung tissue. 
What b egan as a study to 
evaluate whether we 
might be able to avoid the most well -functioning 
lung tissue became something far more exciting once our first set 
of retrospective data 
analysis began. F igure [ADDRESS_1094810] studies: the 
 
Figure 1.  Planned radiation dose distribution (middle) and pulmonary 
function image before (left) and after (right) radiation therapy .  All 
images are for the same patient.  The top row is a  transvers e cut, the 
bottom row is a coronal cut.  The tumor is located in the left lung on the 
pre-treatment pulmonary function image and the computed dose 
distribution image, but absent in the post -treatment images.  Post 
treatment images show a reduction of pulmonary function in the 
treatment location, when compared to the pre- treatment image.  
 
[ADDRESS_1094811] row is an axial imaging and the second row is a coronal image. T he middle 
image shows t he radiati on dose distribution (represented by [CONTACT_793984]) while the first 
and third image show pulmonary function images. The pulmonary function images are color- coded: green and blue indicate normally functioning (expanding) lung tissue with a 
value > 1.1, while orange and red regions show decreased lung function with a value < 
0.95.  
The right lung, which was un- treated, shows minimal changes in lung function, while the 
treated region in the left lung changes from significant e xpansion (green before RT) to 
little to no expansion (orange to red after RT). The functional changes observed in the 
lung appear to correlate well spatially with the delivered radiation dose distribution. A 
second example is shown in Figure 2, where the t op three images show th e computed  
dose distribution and the bottom images show the pulmonary function images. In this 
case the only pulmonary function images shown are after RT. An extremely interesting 
and unexpected finding is shown in Figure 2, where regions of decreased pulm onary 
function extend outside of the applied therapeutic radiation dose. In this case the 
therapeutic radiation dose is delivered to the tumor in the left lung, but also extends over the mediastinum just 1- [ADDRESS_1094812] clinical case shown above. 
The numerical value of pulmonary function in a 2x2x2cm volume within the “ streak” is 
0.96 ± 0.04, while the value in the normal lung is 1.25 ± 0.02. In a third patient (not 
shown) the pulmonary function values prior to RT were 1.29 ± 0.08 and 1.26 ± 0.01 in 
the lower lobe and 1.07 ± 0.01 and 1.05 ± 0.[ADDRESS_1094813] indices for 
tracking pulmonary 
toxicity are highly 
subjective and, predicting RT-quantitative 
 
Figure 2. Planned radiation dose distribution (top) and pulmonary 
function image after radiation therapy (bottom) .  Both rows of images 
display a transverse, sagital, and  coronal cut.   The tumor is located in the 
left lung.  Post treatment lung function images show a reduction of 
pulmonary function in the treatment location, and an additional “streak” 
of function reduction across the right lung beyond the treated volume.  
This observat ion is consistent with non- spatial functional tests in the rat 
model an d never before shown spatially in humans . 
 
[ADDRESS_1094814] common approaches rely on subjective and ambiguous endpoints: 
shortness of breath, pulmonary function tests, blood gases, exercise capacity, and 
radiographic abnormalities. Functional imaging is being recognized as having the 
potential to provide biomark ers as obj ective endpoints. A nearly two decades of research 
in this area is based on single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) perfusion 
scans to quantify functional lung by [CONTACT_793985].[13, 25, 30-38] Other investigators are pursuing pulmonary function 
measurement using novel MRI  techniques[38-40] including hyperpolarized helium -3 
detected MRI.[38, 40- 45] These approaches are challenged by [CONTACT_793986], 
motion correction, and accurate image registration with treatment planning CT scans. We 
have chosen to utilize CT based image -registratio n methods to compute local lung 
expansion from respi[INVESTIGATOR_793964] 4DCT, and have shown its correlation with 
ventilation.[46] Others have investigated 4DCT based pulmonary function assessment 
also finding  favorable results. [47-54] CT has several practical advantages over SPECT 
and MRI as a tool to measure regional lung injury. CT is more readily available, more directly quantitative , has higher spatial and temporal  resolution, is easier to perform with 
RT positioning devices, faster, and less expensive.  
Scores of investigators have worked to establish a relationship between radiation dose -
volume parameters and pneumonitis .[14, 36, 37, 48, 50-76]   The most substantial datasets 
used to establish the correlation of radiation dose with pulmonary toxicity are from 
Washington University in Saint Louis a nd RTOG trial 9311. The  statistical model 
derived from the combined datasets identified greater risk for mean lung dose (MLD), 
and irradiation of the inferior lung. Unfortunately, two lessons from these results are 
unused in clinical practice: high doses to normal lung and the anatomic di stribution of 
dose within the lung are relevant. Instead, the clinical RT paradigm for pulmonary 
toxicity modeling is driven by [CONTACT_121287]-volume relationship of lung volume treated.  
This proposed clinical trial will elucida te the complex inter- relationship  between RT 
treatment and the resultant changes in pulmonary function . While other groups have 
hypothesized the value of dose rearrangement to limit lung toxicity, we will carefully 
apply this information systematically in this prospective clinic al trial t o demonstrate its 
impact.

5.3. 4-Dimensional Computed Tomography (4DCT) I maging 
4DCT imaging is performed  at simulation  (treatment planning)  in all patie nts. This first 
4DCT  is clinically indicate d for radi ation simulation as a standard procedure. This  
clinical imaging data will also be used for research in this protocol to evaluate the 
biomechanical tissue elasticity of the lungs. Lung tissue elasticity is being used as a 
surrogate for ventilation , which in turn is a component of pulmonary function.  B ecause 
the goal of the research arm is to reduce pulmonary function damage, c hanges in lung 
tissue elasticity will be quantified using 4DCT and it’s essential the changes observed be 
distinguished fro m random changes in our measurement.  Consequently, each subject will 
receive two 4DCT scans at each time point in order to quantify the repeatability of the 
measure of tissue elasticity and to demonstrate the changes following RT are greater than 
the expe cted varia tion from the procedure itself.  The results f rom both 4DCT scans will

two scans at each of the [ADDRESS_1094820]- radiation therapy time points ( 3, 6, and 12 months ). Each 
4DCT scan delivers  approximately 75 mSv, which is the average value observed over 10 
patients in our clinic using the newly installed Siemens  Edge scan ner.  The Background 
Equivalent Radiation Time  (BERT) is  [ADDRESS_1094821]  scans (0.53 
Gy) represents less than 1% of the radiation dose the patient will receive from their 
radiation therapy treatments.  In an effort to make the radiation doses from the 4DCT 
scans “as low as reasonably achievable,” t he radiation dose subjects receive for each 
4DCT scan has recently been redu ced by 2- [ADDRESS_1094822] scanner  in Radiation Oncology.  If further dose reduc tion can be 
accomplished by [CONTACT_793989], these too will be 
implemented.  
5.4. Localization 
Either portal imaging, daily cone beam , and/or optical surface tracking is acceptable for 
this study according to standard ca re. If con e beam imaging is prescribed by [CONTACT_681563], the cone beam images will be utilized for correlative studies.  
5.5. Radiation Therapy   
The criteria and specifications below in sections 5.5.[ADDRESS_1094823]  of care arm ( Arm 1 ) and the research arm (Arm  2), while those in 
section 5.5.[ADDRESS_1094824] fractionation  
(1.8- 2.0 Gy/fx) and stereotactic body radia tion thera py (SBRT) hypof ractionation 
schemes used at UWHCC will be utilized.  60 subjects of each fractionation type 
(standard and hypofr actionation) will be included.  Treatment volumes will be at the 
discretion of the treating radiation oncologist  and should foll ow standard of care at 
UWHC. 
5.5.2. Treatment planning and target volumes . The critical structures will be in 
accordance with RTOG  0617. 
5.5.3. Radiation dose limits for c ritical structures . Normal anatomy to be outlined on 
each CT image will include the lungs  (right an d left done separately), heart, skin, 
esophagus and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]. Normal tissue constraints shall be prioritized in the following order for treatment planning: 1=spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], 2=lungs, 3=esophagus, 4=brachial plexus, and 5=heart  
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_35406]:  The sp inal cord dose limitation is the highest priority dose c onstraint 
and thus must be met irrespective of other constraints. Total “dire ct” plus “scatter” 
dose to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_192453] 50.[ADDRESS_1094825] fractionation.  Doses for 
hypofractionation will follow recommendations in RTOG 0618, 0813, or 0915 based 
on fraction size.  
Lungs : The dose -volume constraint to the lungs is th e second highest priority and 
must be met, except if it conflicts with the cord dose constraints. For standard 
 
9 fractionatio n, the volume of both lungs that receive more than 20 Gy (the V20) 
should not exceed 37% of the total. Alternatively, the mean lung dose should 
optimally be ≤ 20 Gy. (By [CONTACT_192483]).  
Doses for hypofractionation will follo w recommendations in RTOG 0618, 0813, or 
0915 based on fraction size. 
Brachial Plexus : Brachial plexus doses should be kept  <[ADDRESS_1094826] 
fractionation.  Doses for hypofractionation will follow recommendations in RTOG 
0618, 0813, or 0915 based on fra ction size.  
Esophagus : The mean dose to the esophagus is optimally kept below 34 Gy.[47] This 
is not an absolute requireme nt, but is strongly recommended unless other, more 
critical constraints force the situation. The V60 (% volume of esophagus  exceeding  
60 Gy) should be calculated for each patient for standard fractionation.  Doses for hypofractionation will follow recommen dations in RTOG 0618, 0813, or 0915 based 
on fraction size.  
Heart : The following limits are recommended: 60 Gy to <1/3, 45 Gy to <2/3, and 40 
Gy to <100% of the heart for standard  fractionation.  Doses for hypofractionation will 
follow recommendations in R TOG 0618, 0813, or 0915 based on fraction size. 
5.5.4. Research Arm (Arm 2) Only  - Planning strategy to reduce pulmonary function 
damage.  
Subjects in the second arm will also receive tr eatment plans that meet all the criteria 
of the first arm, but their treatment plans will include strategies to reduce pulmonary 
function damage following radiation therapy.  The strategy to reduce pulmonary function damage, described below, will be implemented during treatment planning.  
In brief, radiation dose distributions will  be designed to “redistribute” the radiation 
dose away from lung regions with high tissue elasticity.  Lung tissue elastici ty is 
calculated from measures of tissue expansion that occurs during respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  
Specifically, the Jacobian determinant of the tra nsformation matrix between the CT 
scan acquired when the subject has reached the end of exhale and the scan acquired 
when t he subject  has reached the end of inhale.  These images, which are extracted 
from the 4DCT data, allow the creation of lung tissue el asticity maps like the ones 
shown in Figure [ADDRESS_1094827] reduction in pulmonary function if da maged.  For example, to treat the tumor in the 
images above (slightly medial to the dashed blue lines), circumferential radiation beams restricted to the lower lobes of the lung (green regions) would be chosen over 
beams that enter or exit the higher tissu e expansion regions of the right middle lobe or 
right upper lobe (blue & purple regions).  
Pre-radiation therapy 4DCT images (Section 5.3.1) will be used to identify regions -
of-interest (ROI) uniquely  utilized in this planning strategy.  These ROIs includi ng 
anatomical regions (airway tree, pulmonary vasculature, heart, and lobar r egions of 
the lung) and functional regions (regions of the lung discretized by [CONTACT_793990]). Although tissue expansion is 
determi ned at a 1mm
3 resolution, the ROIs will be grouped in 0.05 bins of expansion 
(typi[INVESTIGATOR_158810] 1.05 up to 1.5). Airway tree branches and pulmonary vasculature 
supporting lung regions of high tissue expansion will  be preferentially avoided as 
well.  Radiation  therapy treatment planning will be calculated using an inverse 
optimization technique, relying on dose objectives specified for each ROI.  The 
penalty or “cost function” for failing to meet the specified dose objective will 
increase linearly with radiatio n dose, while the weight for each cost function will be 
determined from the s lope of the dose response curve for each ROI. The inverse 
optimization algorithm will minimize the sum of the cost function s for all dose 
objectives created in the treatment plan.   These dose objectives will be added to the 
dose objectives utilized in the conventional arm of this study (Sections 5.5.1 – 5.5.3).  
5.6. Chemotherapy  
Chemotherapy is at the discretion of the treating ph ysician an d will follow standard of 
care.  The chemotherapeutic agents, dosing and the number of cycles during and after RT 
will be recorded .

4DCT will be acquired at this time  point. 
5.7.2. Pulmonary functi on tests . The subject will be sent to the pulmonary function lab for 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] , and DLCO. The pulmonary function tests may be done on the same day, 
but must be completed before the subject receives the first fraction of radiation 
therapy.  
5.7.3. Dosimetric plan ning. Performed according to standard of care. 
5.7.4. Treatment . Subjects will be treated once  daily or every other day if receivi ng SBRT . 
The respi[INVESTIGATOR_793965].  
5.7.5. Post-treatment 4DCT s. Three more  4DCT imaging set s will be obtained, at [ADDRESS_1094829] radiation treatment (10 week win dow: 
– 2 weeks/+8weeks) . These 4DCT must be performed on the Radiation Oncolo gy 
Siemens Edge . These are research -designated 4DCT s and will not be used for clinical 
care.   
5.7.6. Post-treatment PFT.  Subjects will undergo PFT at the [ADDRESS_1094830]  year, every 4 months for year two, and every 6 months for 
years 3 -5. Follow -up mirrors that of RTOG -0117, enabling time-point comparisons. 
Data to be collected are outlined in section 11 (measurement of effect). The follow -up 
time points are consistent with standard of care post radiation dise ase monitoring.

Thera py will consist of 60-[ADDRESS_1094831] study -defined follow-up appointme nt will 
be 3 months (10 week window: – 2 weeks to +8weeks) after completing radiation 
therapy. With approval of PI, subject s can miss this follow -up appointment and continue 
on the study.

5.12.2. Patient self -assessment  will be documented using a modi fied Borg scale, which has 
a history of use in pulmonary labs, with a scale of 1 (resting comfortably in a chair 
with no effort) to 10 (the most exertion and difficult breathing ever experienced). 
5.12.3. Pulmonary Function Tests  will include FEV1, FVC, DLCO measurements

tissue, spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], heart, and bone (Appendix C). Evaluation by [CONTACT_793991] 6 month follow-up and beyond. 
5.12.6. Cons titutionalassessment : quantify nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and other symptoms 
and any medications used for these symptoms. Done weekly during chemoradiatio n 
and at follow -up appointments.  
6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
Not applicable. If radiation dose needs to be modified or delayed, this is per standard of care and 
beyond the scope of this study. A note wi ll be made in the study chart regarding any changes to 
radiation dose and any breaks in radiation therapy. 
 
7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  
 
The risks of harm for those subjects randomized to the research arm (arm 2) is equivalent to the 
control arm:  optimized treatment pl ans in the research arm will be designed to me et the same 
dose specifications to organs- at-risk. In other words, when comparing the control and research 
arm: 
· the same radiation doses will be delivered to the tumors  
· the same radiation dose limits will b e achieved for all normal tissues  
 
There are m inimal additional risks associated with the research procedures of 4DCT and P FT’s.   
The most significant risk from 4DCT is the increased radiation exposure which will be less than 
1% of the dose received from the prescribed radiation therapy. Subjects may experience 
 
[ADDRESS_1094833] the scans.  
 
PFT’s have the following associated risks : the test require s subjects to breathe in an d out quickly, 
which may cause them to feel dizzy or faint. The test may increase the risk of asthma attack in 
those with asthma. In very rare cases, PFTs may cause a collapsed lung.   
  
Patients will receive standard of care therapeutic radi ation therapy dosing as part of this study.  
Toxicities associated with therapeutic radiation include: Reversible or permanent alopecia, bone 
marrow toxicity , skin reactions, and esophagitis are expected  side effects of radiation therapy. 
Radiation -induced myocarditis or  transver se myelitis rarely occur at doses lower than [ADDRESS_1094834] 6-12 months after initiation of treatment.   
Acute (within [ADDRESS_1094835] RT comple tion) and late radiation toxicities  ( > then [ADDRESS_1094836] RT 
completion) will be recorded with special attention to the toxicities listed in appendix B and C.   
Any treatment interruption will be based on treating physician judgement and be documented as 
part of the study toxicity assessments . 
7.1. Adverse Events Characteristics   
This trial will be focused on the radiation toxicities experie nced by [CONTACT_793992] “optimized” treatment planning thus the 
toxicities recorded in this protocol will focus only on toxicities that can be at least 
possibly attributed to the radiation treatment.  
RTOG (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) has developed both acute and late radiation toxicities that occur in lung canc er patients.  These toxicities and grading criteria are 
outlined in appendix B ( acute toxicities ) and Appendix C (late radiation toxicities). 
In addition, 15% subjects who undergo chest ra diation experience rib fractures.  We will 
track rib fractures using  the CTACAE 4.03 term “fracture ” to ensure that “optimized"  or 
experimental arm patients frequency  and severity of fractures don’t exceed cont rol arm 
subjects or historical frequency.   
 
Changes in Pulmonary function tests  
We will utilize the criteria used in RTOG08 [ADDRESS_1094837] some deg ree of impaired pulmonary 
function as measured  by [CONTACT_83503] (PFTs), including Forced Expi[INVESTIGATOR_568928] 1 second (FEV1), Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), and Diffusing Capacity for 
Carbon Monoxide (DLCO). The Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE), v. 4 includes 
specified criteria for grading a dverse events related to these PFT parameters under the 
system organ  class of  Investigations. The grading criteria for these PFT changes use the 
“percent predicted” values from 0 -100% which are recorded on the patient’s PFT report. 
A percent predicted of 9 0% conveys that the patient is able to perform the PFT test to a 
 
14 result that is 90% of what would be expected for the normal general population of the 
same height, age, and sex. The CTCAE version [ADDRESS_1094838] defined a propor tional decline from the baseline. 
Grade 1 toxi city will be a decline from baseline to a level 0.90 times the basel ine, grade 2 
will be a decline to a level 0.75 of baseline, grade 3 will be a decline to a level 0.5 of baseline, grade 4 will be a decline to  a level 0.25 of baseline, and grade 5 will be death. 
This scheme is depi[INVESTIGATOR_793966] r epresented in the figure 
below. See appendix D  As an example, a patient who enters the study with a percent predicted DLCO of 55% who experie nces a post treatment decline to a percent predicted DLCO of 40% would 
have a grade 3 event in the original CTCAE version 4 criteria; however, under this modified PFT toxicity classification for patients with abnormal baseline, his decline would constitute a decrease to 0.72 of the baseline value which is between 0.75 and 0.5 or a grade 2 event.  
    
 
‘Expectednes s
 ’: AEs can b e ‘Unexpected’ or ‘Expected’ for expedited reporting 
purposes only. 
Attribution of the AE : 
• Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
• Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
• Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
• Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
• Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study t reatment.  
 
Adverse Event Reporting 
Adverse eve nts (AE s) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be recorded in stud y 
databas e. All  SAEs will be reported to the lung DOWG, UWCCC, and UW HS -IRB 
per policy. Reporting criteria are summarized in Table 1.  
An AE i s an undesirable medical occurrence (sign, sym ptom, or diagnosis) or 
worsening of a pre -existing medical condition  (diabete s, congestive heart failure, 
rheumatoid arthritis) that occurs after initiation of the investigational product whether 
or not it is c onsidered to be investigational product related.  A worsening of an 
existing medical condition is one that was pre sent at baseline (e.g., cancer, diabetes, 
migraine headaches, gout) and became more severe, more frequent, or increased in duration during investigational product treatment. = 
Expected events - Expected events are those that have been previously identified as 
resul ting from treatment of lung cancer with radiation. These are defined above for 
 
15 acute and  late toxicities (section 8, appendix B and C). For purposes of this study, 
reporting requi rements are determined by [CONTACT_793993] c haracteristics: the type or nature of the  event; the severity (grade); the 
relationship to the study therapy (unrelated, not likely, poss ibly, likely, or definitely 
related), and whet her the event is expected or unexpected.  
Recommended assessment step s include : 
• Identification of adverse event. 
• Determine whether the adverse event is expected or unexpected.  
• Grading the severity of the adverse event using the appropriate set of criteria; 
CTCAE v.4.03 (General, unexpected). 
• Determination as to whether the adverse event is related to the study therapy 
using the following categories: Unrelated, Possible, Probable, and Definite 
 
For the purpose of this study acute radiation adverse event infor mation will be 
collecte d through 90 day (3 month) post radiation vis it.  Afte r the 90 day (3 month 
visit)  visit only events specific late radiation treatment effects will be collected  ( 
appendix C ) and any adv erse events that result from the 4DCT and PFT’s.  
 
An SAE is defined by [CONTACT_98755] a significa nt hazard or 
side effect, regardless of the investigator or sponsor’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_793967].  This includes, but may not be limited to, any event that (at 
any dose): 
• Is fatal  
• Is life threatening (places the subject  at immediate risk of death)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Is a persistent or significant dis ability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/bir th defect  
• Any event that does not exactly meet this definition yet, in the in vestigator’s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_98735] a significant hazard can be assigned the “other significant 
hazard” regulatory reporting serious criteria  
• Additionally, important medical events that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_793968], or result in 
urgent inve stigation, may be considered serious.  Example s include allergic 
bronchospasm, convulsions, and blood dyscrasias. 
 
Note: Al l deaths on treatment require both routine and expedited reporting regardless 
of causality. Attribution to treatment or other cause must be provided. “On treatment” 
is defined beg ins with the radiation simulation planning session and ends [ADDRESS_1094839]  RT AND

8. CORRELATIVE/SPECIAL STUDIES : CLOSED TO ADDITIONAL SAMPLE 
COLLECTIONS  
8.1. Correlative Objective  
Changes in i nflamm ation blood markers at 3, 6, 9 and 12 mon ths aft er radiation therapy 
when compared to baseline.  Plasma TGF -β1 will be measured by [CONTACT_793994] (ELISA). The levels of plasma cytokines will 
be measured by [CONTACT_793995] r the concentrations of [ADDRESS_1094842] es 
will be drawn within 2 weeks prior to radiation therapy and then drawn 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after radiation therapy.   
Platelet -poo
r plasma  will be obtaine d for cyto kine assays; serum samples will  be use d 
for, cell death assays and other markers as ind icated; buffy coat will be used for genomic 
studies including methylation analysis. Plasma TGF -β1 will be measured by [CONTACT_793996] S andwich Assay (ELISA). The levels of plasma 
cytokines will be measured by [CONTACT_793997], such as LINCOplex (microsphere- based 
sandwich immunoassay) for the concentrations of 29 proinflammatory cytokines, 
including G -CSF, IL- 1α, IL -1β, IL -1ra, IL -6, IL -8, IP -10, MCP -1, MIP -1, TGF -α, and 
TNF -α. RILT will be diagnosed and graded based on CTCAE 4.  For genomic studies, 
we will focus our efforts on (but not limited to) global SNP and DNA methylation as well as SNP and methylation analysis of TGFβ1, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and 
angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE), which are associated with radia tion-induced 
thoracic toxicity such as radiation induced lung injury. Genetic variations within 
functional locus of these genes will be assessed for in each patient by [CONTACT_793998]. Such SNP studies will be performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and allele specific primers.   Genome wide methylation profiling will be 
performed using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array which 
examines the methylation status of 485,577 CpG sites distributed throughout the whole genome, covering 96% of CpG islands and 99% of RefSeq genes.  Methylation status of 
select genes of interests will also be validated using pyrosequencing.  Bioinfomatic 
methodology may be applied for data analysis.  Blood markers (cytokine and genomics)  
 
18 during early course of treatment will be correlated to clinical outcome including tumor 
control.  
Blood ( whole blood, plasma and serum) will be processed by [CONTACT_793999] 
(Translational Science BioCore). 30 ml peripheral blood (two [ADDRESS_1094843] tube) will be taken from each patient at each time point. 
Blood—Plasma: 10 ml of blood will be collected in one EDTA (purple top) tube tw
ice. Blood will be inverted [ADDRESS_1094844] clinical centrifuge at 
3000g at 4°C for 10 minutes. If the interval between specimen collection and 
processing is anticipated to be greater than one hour, the specimens are kept on ice until centrifuging can begin.  Samples will be carefully pi[INVESTIGATOR_793970] 1.5 ml 
cryovials as 1.0 ml aliquots of plasma. Care will be taken to avoid pi[INVESTIGATOR_793971] (red/white blood cells). Plasma samples will be labeled and cryovials will be stored at -80°C.  
Blood–Serum: [ADDRESS_1094845] (red top) tube. Blood will sit at room temperature for [ADDRESS_1094846] clinical centrifuge at 3000g at 4°Cfor 10 minutes. Samples 
will be transferred into up to ten 1.5 ml cryovials as ~1ml aliquots of separated 
serum. Serum samples will be labeled and cryovials will be stored at -80°C. 
Blood—Whole Blood: 10 ml of blood will be collected in one EDTA (purple top) 
tube. Blood will be inverted 6- 7 times to ensure adequate mixing with anticoagulant 
and then carefully pi[INVESTIGATOR_793972] 1.5 ml cryovials  as 0.5 ml aliquots of 
whole blood. Samples will be labeled and cryovials will be stored at -80°C. 
Initial collected specimens will be labeled with the patient name, date, time and time 
point collected. A completed specimen collection flow sheet will accompany each specimen.  
In an effort to protect the patient’s identity in the laboratory, the stored frozen samples will be identified  by a code that can be linked back to the patient by [CONTACT_4520], but not other laboratory personnel. 
Blood collections will be scheduled at baseline, which will be within 2 weeks of 
radiation therapy beginning, and then 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months 
after the completion of radiation therapy.  
8.3. Correlation with daily localization imaging  
Images acquired for daily localization may show changes in lung tissue that occur during therapy.  These images may also be investigated as described in secondary endpoints

10. MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
The aims of this proposal are to use quantitative imaging to characteriz e pulmonary 
biomechanics, improve pulmonary function following RT by [CONTACT_794000] -RT pulmonary 
function data to avoid regions of the lung with high function, and gather outcomes data to further 
refine our radiation dose response model. The primary endpoint is changes in pulmonary 
function, based on changes in tissue elasticity measured from 4DCT.  Secondarily we will evaluate global measures of change using routine pulmonary function tests. 
10.1. Primary endpoint  
Lung tissue elasticity changes. The primary endpoint of this study will be the ratio of the 
tissue elasticity map following RT to the elasticity map before RT (i.e., the Jacobian ratio 
of (post RT /pre RT)) calculated from 4DCT at [ADDRESS_1094848]- RT.  Based on the 
randomness of our measurement technique, diminished expansion (i.e. substantial 
change) is defined as a Jacobian ratio <0.94 (i.e., less than 94% of the pre-RT value ). 
10.2. Se condary endpoints   
10.2.1. Lung tissue e lasticity changes  
Temporal changes in reduced elasticity. Since the differences in expansion may 
increase with time, we will investigate these same chang es during therapy (using 
localization images acquired per 5.4) and at [ADDRESS_1094849]- RT. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Temporal changes in increased elastic ity. At 3, [ADDRESS_1094850] -RT 
we will determine the volume of lung where expansion is improved (Jacobian 
ratio (post- RT/pre -RT) > 1.06)  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Temporal changes in fraction of expanding lung. At 3, [ADDRESS_1094851]- RT we will  determine the volume of lung where “meaningful” expansion 
occurs (Jacobian post -RT > 1.1).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Validation of dose response model. Validation in consistency of tissue 
elasticity changes measured with values predicted based on existing radiation dose response curves.  
 
20 10.2.2. Global measures of change 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pulmonary Function Tests.  Changes in patient self -assessment, forced 
vital capacity (FVC), forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_793973] (FEV1), and 
diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxi de (DLCO).  All metrics will be 
evaluated at 3, 6, and [ADDRESS_1094852]-RT in comparison to values pre- RT. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Infla mmation.  Plasma TGF -β1 will be measured by [CONTACT_793994] (ELISA). The levels of plasma 
cytokines will be  measured by [CONTACT_794001] [ADDRESS_1094853] based measures of lung tissue elasticity  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Variation of the  tissue elasticity calculated between scan [ADDRESS_1094854]-radiation.  
11. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
11.1. Study Design/Endpoints  
The primary endpoint of this study will be the  ratio of the tissue elasticity map following 
RT to the elasticity map before RT (i.e., the Jacobian ratio of (post RT /pre RT)) 
calculated from 4DCT at [ADDRESS_1094855] -RT.  Based on the randomness of our 
measurement technique, diminished expansion is define d as a Jacobian ratio <0.94 (i.e., 
less than 94% of the pre -RT value). Data for the analysis will consist of the voxel -
specific ratios of tissue elasticity  measures from scans being compared. The primary and 
secondary endpoints at 3, 6, and [ADDRESS_1094856] -RT include: (i) the volume of lung 
where diminished expansion occurs (Jacobian ratio (post RT /pre RT)<0.94), (ii) the volume of lung where expansion is improved (Jacobian ratio (post RT /pre RT)>1.06),  
(iii) the volume of lung where “meaningful” exp ansio n occurs (Jacobian post -RT > 1.1), 
and (iv) clinically observed pulmonary toxicity determined by [CONTACT_794002], and (v) 
changes in inflammation as  determined from blood serum.  
 
[ADDRESS_1094857] multiple sites of disease treated within the thorax.   Sin ce these 
subjects will be treated at all sites with either the control (Arm 1) or experimental (Arm 
2) treatment plan, and since the primary endpoint of the study is the assessment of normal 
lung tissue response to delivered radiation, these subjects repre sent a single sample 
within our analysis.  
Power analysis shows t he planned enrollment of 60 subjects per cohort will ensure 90% 
power to detect mean difference of 4% in the lung tissue elasticity (percentage of the lung 
with a Jacobian ratio post -RT/p re RT  < 0.94), based on 6.3% deviation in this measure 
from 13 subjects in our preliminary data. If the normality assumptions of ANOVA are not satisfied, nonparametric rank -based tests will be used instead. All statistical tests will 
be two -sided and assessed f or significance at the 5% level , and will b e performed by [CONTACT_794003]-Madison  Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics . 
 
Update as of 2/3/2021:  The statistics are based on [ADDRESS_1094858] those subjects and to 
allow an addtional 5 subjects to ensure we complete the protocol and meet the study 
objectives.

APPENDIX F: UWCCC DATA SAFETY MONITORING PLAN  
 
Oversight And Monitoring Plan  
The UWCCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is responsible for the regular review 
and moni toring of all ongoing clinical research in the UWCCC. A summary of DSMC activities are 
as follows:  
• Reviews all clinical trials conducted at the UWCCC for subject safety, protocol compliance, and 
data integrity.  
• Reviews all Serious Adverse Events (SAE) re quiring expedited reporting, as defined in the 
protocol, for all clinica l trials conducted at the UWCCC, and studies conducted at external sites 
for which UWCCC acts as an oversight body.  
• Reviews all reports generated through the UWCCC DSMS  elements (Inte rnal Audits, Quality 
Assurance Reviews, Response Reviews, Compliance Rev iews, and Protocol Summary Reports)  
• Notifies the protocol Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_164360], if applicable, any 
requirements for corrective action related to  data or safety  issues.  
• Notifies the CRC of DSMC decisions and any correspondence from the DSMC to the protocol 
Principal Investigator.  
• Works in conjunction with the UW Health Sciences IRB in the review of relevant safety 
information as well as protocol deviations, non-compliance, and unanticipated problems reported 
by [CONTACT_15266].  
• Ensures that notification is of SAEs requiring expedited reporting is provided to external sites 
participating in multi -institutional clinical trials coordinated by [CONTACT_135262].  
 
Monitoring And Reporting Guidelines  
UWCCC quality assurance and monitoring activities are determined by [CONTACT_794005]. All protocols (including Intervention Trials, Non-Intervention Trials, Behavioral and Nutritional Studies, and trials conducted under a Training Gr ant) are 
evaluated by [CONTACT_15269]. UWCC monitoring requirements for trials 
without an acceptable external DSMB are as follows:  
Intermediate Monitoring Pr
 otocols subject to intermediate monitoring generally include UW 
Institutional Phase I/II and Phase II Trials.  These protocols undergo review of subject safety at 
regularly scheduled DOWG meetings where the results of each subject’s treatment are discussed 
and the discussion is documented in the DOWG meeting minutes.  The discussion includes the number of subjects enrolled, significant toxicities, dose adjustments, and responses observed.  
Protocol Summary Reports are submitted on a semi -annual basis by [CONTACT_941] s tudy team for review by 
[CONTACT_6802].  
 
R
eview and Oversight Requirements 
Serious Adverse Events requiring reporting within 24 hours (as described in the protocol) must also be 
re
ported to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) Chair via  an email to 
[EMAIL_259] within one business day. The OnCore SAE Detai ls Report must be 
submitted along with other report materials as appropriate (NCI AdEERS form or FDA Medwatch Form #3500 and/or any other documentation available at that time of initial reporting). The DSMC Chair will 
review the information and determin e if immediate action is required. Within [ADDRESS_1094866] be submitted electronically along with a 24 hour follow-
 
33 up SAE De tails Report an d a completed UWCCC SAE Routing Form to

and determine if further action is required. All informa tion is entered and tracked in the UWCCC 
database. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_357335], the 
IRB, the sponsor, and the funding agency and provides documentation of these notifications to the 
DSMC. If th e SAE occurs on a clinical trial in which the UW PI [INVESTIGATOR_15152] -investigator, the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_793976]. For a multiple -institutional c linical trial the PI [INVESTIGATOR_793977].  
 
Sponsor-Investigator Respons ibilities for SAE Review  
In the event the UWCCC Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_15155]-Invest igator (i.e., the PI [INVESTIGATOR_793978]), the PI [INVESTIGATOR_15157] 21 CFR 312.32. 
In this capacity, the UWCCC PI [INVESTIGATOR_793979] a determination of 1) suspectedness (i.e., 
whether there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused the AE); and 2) unexpectedness in the 
context of theis study.  SAE with suspected causality to study intervention deemed unexpected are reported as IND safety Reports by [CONTACT_15272] [INVESTIGATOR_15159], all participating investigators on the study, within [ADDRESS_1094867] suspected 
causality to the study intervention wi ll be reported by [CONTACT_15272] [INVESTIGATOR_15159], all participating 
investigators on the study within 7 calendar days. 
 
Study Progress Review 
Protocol Summary Reports (PSR) are required to be submitted to the DSMC in the timeframe 
determined by [CONTACT_15273] (quar terly; semi-annually; or annually). The PSR provides a 
cumulative report of SAEs, as well as instances of non -compliance, protocol deviations, and 
unanticipated problems, toxicities and responses that have occurred on the protocol in the tim eframe 
specified. PSRs for those protocols scheduled for review are reviewed at each DSMC meeting. 
 Protocol Summary Reports enable DSMC committee members to assess whether significant benefits or 
risks are occurring that would warrant study suspension or closure. This information is evaluated by [CONTACT_15274] (e.g., reports from Internal 
Audits, Quality Assurance Reviews, etc.) occurring since the prior review of the protocol by [CONTACT_6802]. 
Additio nally, the DSMC requires the study team to submit external DSMB or DSMC reports, external 
 
34 monitoring findings for industry-sponsored studies, and any other pertinent study- related information.  
 
In the event that there is significant risk warranting study s uspension or cl osure, the DSMC will notify 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_15160] (e.g., suspension 
or closure). The DSMC ensures that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_15161] a clinical trial to the sponsor  (e.g., NCI Program Director, Industry Sponsor Medical Monitor, Cooperative Group 
Study Chair, etc.) and other appropriate agencies. DSMC findings and requirements for follow- up action 
are submitted to the CRC 
 
Expedited Reporting Of Serious  Adverse Events  
Depending on the nature, severity, and attribution of the serious adverse event an SAE report will be 
phoned in, submitted in writing, or both according to Table  below. All serious adverse events must also 
be reported to the UWCCC Data and  Safety Monitor ing Committee Chair. All serious adverse events 
must also be reported to the UW IRB (if applicable), and any sponsor/funding agency not already 
included in the list. Determine the reporting time line for the SAE in question by [CONTACT_236944]. Then refer to sections A and B below if the SAE occurred at the UWCCC or sections C and D if 
the SAE occurred at 1 South Park, Johnson Creek, or a WON Site.

FDA Reporting Requirements for Serious Ad verse Events (21 CRF Part 312) 
NOTE: Investigators MUST immediately report to the PI, UWCCC and UW IRB per policy ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether or not they are considered related to the investigat ional 
agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64). FDA Med W atch (3500A) will be submitted for grade 4 
and 5 events at the discretion of the sponsor- investigator.  
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY of the following outcomes:  
• Death.  
• A life-threatening adverse event. 
• An adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9959] ≥ 24 hours.  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions.  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
Important Medic al Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed in this definition (FDA, 21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).

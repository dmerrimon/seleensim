I. Study Overview   
 
OVERALL OBJECTIVE 
The goal of this study is to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics and activity of atorvastatin in 
children with acute Kawasaki disease (KD) and coronary artery abnormalities . The goal will be to find a 
treatment that could prevent  or attenuat e coronary artery damage in acute KD . 
 
HYPOTHESIS  
We postulate that atorvastatin will be safe in children ≥ 2 years old with acute KD.  
 
STUDY TYPE  
This is a Phase I/IIa dose escalation study

Children ≥[ADDRESS_530671] a Z- score ≥ 2.5 or a neurysm (≥ 1.5 x  the 
adjacent segment) of one of the coronary arteries.

2. Activity of atorvastatin  
a. Biomarkers and measures of inflammation  
b. Echocardiographic assessment of coronary artery abnormalities  
 
II. Background & Significance  
IIA. Significance:  
KD, the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children in Western developed countries and 
Asia, is a systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology. In the [LOCATION_002], there are 5- 6,000 new cases 
each year [ 1]. However, without a specific diagnostic test, the true burden of disease is unknown. At 
Rady Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_59303], we cared for over 90 new KD cases in 2010 and follow over 1,200 
families in our outpatient KD Clinic (350 outpatient visits /yr.), of whom 9% developed aneurysms and 
25% developed dilated coronary arteries. In Japan, the country of highest incidence (>215/100,000 children < 5 yrs), there are more than 12,000 new cases each year and rates continue to rise [ 2]. KD 
causes both a myocarditis and a vasculitis that damages the coronary arteries and other medium -sized 
muscular arteries  [3, 4]. The major sequelae of aneurysms include thrombosis, late coronary artery 
stenosis, myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarcti on, and death [ 5, 6]. Clea rly, aneurysm prevention 
is a primary goal of treatment during the acute phase of the disease, which leads us to focus on treatment of patients with early signs of coronary artery abnormalities (CAAs) in this 
application.  
 
Intravenous immunoglobulin (I VIG) in combination with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_420652].  The major acute risk of aneurysm 
formation is thrombosis, which can be prevented with systemic anti -coagulation with warfarin or 
enox aparin in addition to antiplatelet therapy with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_420653] 
(>6 mm). However, there is no recommended therapy to halt the progression of arterial wall destruction 
and prevent aneurysm formation.  In KD, CD8+ T -cells infiltrate the arterial wall and data from the 
Franco lab suggest that T -cell regulation is a key factor in reducing the acute inflamma tion[7, 8] The 
proposed studies will determine if atorvastatin  is safe to use in young children and has 
demonstrable anti -inflammatory activity at a well -tolerated dose so that future studies can 
address the efficacy of atorvastatin  in attenuating vascular wall damage and preventing 
aneurysms in KD patients.  
 
IIB. Importance of the problem  
Once aneurysms have formed, there is no way to turn back the biologic clock and undo them. The 
transmural inflammation destroys the normal architecture and even in children who remodel the 
aneurysm to form a more normal lumen, the vessel is never functionally normal again. The remodeled 
segment cannot dilate normally during increased myocardial oxygen demand and thus serves as a 
functional stenosis. It has been estimated that there are currently over 24,000 young adults in the 
[LOCATION_002] with a history o f KD, including over 8,000 with a history o f coronary artery abnormalities. 
Without a new therapeutic approach  this number is expected to grow by 1,400 individuals each year [6]. 
A recent st udy found that over 5% of all young adults (<40 years) evaluated by [CONTACT_420655] [9]. 
 
IIC. Validity of the approach 
A Phase I/II a trial will generate sufficient data to determine if a full -scale Phase III trial is warranted. The 
trial will also establish if the anti -inflammatory effects of statins can be measured in children with an 
acute vasculitis.  
 IID. Critical barriers to improving care  
Barrier s to improving treatment for children with KD include the lack of a validated predictive score to 
identify those children at highest risk of aneurysm formation and lack of a therapeutic intervention that 
can prevent progression of CAAs once they have been detected.  
 
 
IIE. Potential to effect change in clinical practice 
The current clinical practice is to give every patient the same standard therapy (IVIG 2g/kg with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 80-100mg/kg) and to monitor for CAA. The mechanism of action of this immunomo dulatory therapy 
remains unknown, but is being addressed by [CONTACT_420656] [INVESTIGATOR_420654]. Franco 
(RO1 HL103536 and RO1 FD003514). In the unfortunate child who carries the genetic risk for CAA, no 
intervention to modify vessel wall inflammation is currently recommended  [10].  
 In a recent article entitled “Mining for therapeutic gold”, Director of the NIH, [CONTACT_179405], stated 
that “drug repurposing” should be a strategy “to translate research into clinically useful products” [11]  . 
Our goal is to translate our findings on the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), T -cells, and 
myofibroblasts in KD aneurysm formation and “repurpose” the drug atorvastatin to test the hypothesis 
that the pleiotropic anti -inflammatory properties of this drug will prevent or attenuate coronary artery 
aneurysms in children with KD.  
 
IV. Specfic Aims  
Specific Aim [ADDRESS_530672] the hypothesis that a 6- week course of atorvastatin will be safe and well -
tolerated in children with KD and early CAAs.   
The safety of atorvastatin will be assessed . A dose escalation design will be used to find a dose in 
subjects that is tolerated with limited side effects.

5. Background and rationale for study  
 
5.1 Background  
Multidrug resistant (MDR) bacterial infections  are a leading cause of morbidity, death, and 
healthcare -associated costs.1-3  Nowhere is this more important than in the intensive care unit 
(ICU),  where over half of all infections are MDR4 and where sepsis from MDR bacteria confers 
10-20% absolute increased mortality.5-[ADDRESS_640465] low levels of 
butyrate and other short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) which are derived from dietary fiber by 
[CONTACT_498096] a (e.g., Faecalibacterium 
prausnitzii ).  SCFAs moderate colonic inflammation,16 enlarge the pool of regulatory T cells,17 and 
Inulin in the ICU  
Protocol Version 5  – February  24, [ADDRESS_640466] MDROs.  SCFAs cannot be easily given to humans due to oral 
intolerability and rapid metabolism,19,20 but inulin promotes growth of SCFA producers to raise 
SCFA levels.  In animals, inulin -type fibers improve survival after pathogen challenge21,22 even in 
the face of antibiotics.18,23 -25  In a randomized tri al of 30 outpatients, inulin increased fecal levels 
of SCFA producers by 35 -90%, with a 3 -fold decrease of serum markers of bacterial translocation 
(e.g., lipopolysaccharide)  relative to placebo.26  Inulin is safe in ambulatory patients27-35 with 
biologic effects seen at 16 g/day.[ADDRESS_640467] been given up to 36 g/day 
without adverse events36  and in our ICU cohort we have observed 30 g/day dietary fiber without 
intolerance.  This trial will test whether  inulin supplementation has similar effects in the ICU  as it 
does in animal models and as it appears to in healthy volunteers:  will it result  in higher levels of 
SCFA -producing Clostridia, decreased gastrointestinal antibiotic resistance an d lower risk for 
MDR infections?  
 
5.2 Trial purpose and design  
The pur pose of this Phase 2 trial is to determine the feasibility and safety of inulin for the 
prevention of antibiotic resistant infections or colonization in critically ill patients.  We will perform 
a double -blind, randomized controlled trial of inulin in the ICU with three arms (placebo, inulin 8 g 
twice daily, and inulin 16 g twice daily).  Subjects will be treated with inulin or placebo for [ADDRESS_640468] pathogen colonization and infection in the ICU.   
 
 Cohort #1 .40  A single rectal swab was performed on medical ICU admission for consecutive 
patients .  Swabs were cultured for VRE and residual DNA was extracted for 16S rRNA gene 
sequencing; patients were then followed for up to 30 days for death or culture -proven 
infections.  In 9 months , 301 patients  were enrolled of whom 91 (30%) were VRE colonized.  
Thirty -day mortality  was 25% and an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 21% patients dev eloped culture -proven 
MDR infections.  
 
Cohort #[ADDRESS_640469] always associated with subsequent organ ism-specific infection, even after adjusting for

 acute severity illness as captured by [CONTACT_498097] -3 (SAPS -3)41,42 and other 
relevant clinical variables .  This was true for VRE 
(aHR 5.85, 95% CI 2.25 -15.2, 16 infections), C. 
difficile  (aHR 19.0, 95% CI 4.40 -81.8, 9 infections), 
Pseudomonas  (aHR 2.37, 95% CI 1.04 -5.43, 28 
infections), and Klebsiella spp . (aHR 3.81, 95% CI 
1.10-13.2, 28 infections).  To interrogate the process 
by [CONTACT_498098], 
we also examined MDRO domination defined as 
≥30% 16S reads corresponding to a potential 
pathogen.43,[ADDRESS_640470] 
colonized by [CONTACT_498099].  Enterococcus  domination (15% 
of the cohort) and VRE colonization (30%) both 
predicted all-cause  infection ( Figure 1 ).  When 30 -day mortality was examined as a stand -alone 
outcome, VRE colonization/domination predicted 40% increased mortality, after adjusti ng for 
SAPS -[ADDRESS_640471] the ability to assess coloni zation with o ther MDROs using culture (e.g., Gram negative 
bacteria ).  Based on the 16S sequencing results, SCFA producers were classified as absent 
(<.01% relative abundance), low (.01% to 1%), or high (>1%) after Haak et al.45  High levels of 
SCFA producers were associated with lower prevalence of VRE colonization based on culture : 
40% when SCFA producers were absent, 27% when they were low, and 22% when they were 
high (p<.01).  Results were similar for Enterococcus  domination . 
 
 Cohort #2 .37,39  This cohort was designed to exa mine dynamic  changes in the ICU 
microbiome, focusing on SCFA producers and MDROs.  Swabs were performed in duplicate 
at ICU admission and 72 hours later (±4 hours).  Swabs were 
then (1 ) cultured for MRSA, VR E, and MDR Gram negatives 
and (2 ) 16S sequenced .  In [ADDRESS_640472] been enrolled with 126 sequenced to date.  
 
Cohort #2 demonstrated that SCFA -producing bacteria associate 
with preserved colonization resistance .  Within  cohort #[ADDRESS_640473] withi n individuals , comparing their 
admission and Day 3 samples.  14 taxa were identified as having 
significantly chang ed at a false -discovery adjusted p<.[ADDRESS_640474] 72 hours of which 6 were SCFA 
producers .  These changes were substantial in magnitude (e.g., 
8-fold for  F. prausnitzii ). 
 
We wanted to know how SCFA producers associated with MDRO 
colon ization .  SCFA  producer s were again classified as absent, 
low, or high  based on sequencing .  MDROs were classified as 
present vs absent based on culture results.  At both ICU 
admission and 72 hou rs later, there was a stepwise relationship Figure  1.  VRE colonization/domination was 
associated with death or culture -proven 
infection in the ICU .  VRE colonization or 
domination was assessed at the time of ICU 
admission and patients were followed for all -cause 
culture -proven infection.

and 72 hours later .  Lines are  95% 
confidence estimates.

Page 8 of 37  
 where higher SCFA producers was associated with  
decreased MDRO colonization ( Figure 2 , previous 
page ).  Comparing high to absent SCFA levels, the 
difference in rates of MDRO colonization was over 
25%.  
 
Last, we sought to retrospectively assess th e impact 
of dietary fiber on SCFA producers and MDROs.  
Observed fiber intake was low overall with a mean 
of 13.4 g  over 72 hours, but some patients did 
receive large amounts of fiber (maximum 30 g/24 
hours).  There was no intolerance of fiber  based on 
documentation of abdominal distension, diarrhea, or 
nausea/vomiting.  Fiber intake was classified into 
tertiles and SCFA producers were examined as a 
continuous measure based on 16S sequencing.  At 
ICU admission, baseline relative abundance of 
SCFA producers was similar across fiber intake 
groups.  After 72 hours, higher fiber intake was 
associated with higher levels of SCFA producers 
(Figure 3 ).  Higher fiber was also associated with 
less Enterococcus  (median abundance .08% high 
fiber vs .35% no fiber, p=.03) .  This data is observational so there were baseline patient 
differences between those who did and did not receive high dietary fiber.  To account for this, we 
built a multivariable model adjusted for acute severity of illness, receipt of antibiotics, and total 
caloric intake.  In this model, t here was a 0.30% median increase in SCFA producers after 72 
hours per additional 10g of fiber intake (p<0.01).   This suggests that dietary fiber has the potential 
to impact levels of SCFA producers, even during critic al illness and with receipt of  broad -spectrum  
antibiotics (78% of the cohort).  
 
6.2 Inulin in animal models  
Animal models show  protective effects of inulin or similar compounds , which appear to be 
mediated by [CONTACT_498100] .47,48  Importantly, these studies demonstrate that 
inulin is likely to be effective even when given concurrently with antibiotics.  Animal models include 
cecal ligation and puncture (CLP),21 lipopolysaccharide (L PS) injection,[ADDRESS_640475] their strengths and weaknesses, so it 
is remarkable that results align well across them.  Inulin and similar fructo -oligosaccharides (FOS) 
seem to confer protective effects through multiple mechanisms  all of which likely depend on SCFA 
fermenters .  First, they maintain the protective colon ic mucus layer.  Inulin fermenters activate 
carbohydrate metabolism pathways and switch fuel utilization from dietary fiber to colonic mucus 
when inulin -like fibers are unavailable, causing  thinning of the colonic mucus layer.18,[ADDRESS_640476] immunity.  When  
SCFA -producing anaerobe levels increase  during sepsis , there is induction of T regulatory cells 
(Tregs), reduction in activated dendritic cells, and downstream decreased DNA binding of NF -kB 
for a n overall  reduction in pro -inflammatory cytokines and reduced T cell anergy.[ADDRESS_640477] is large, with dramatic differences in outcomes including 
weight loss, colitis severity, and mortality.

6.4 Inulin -like fibers in the ICU  
Inulin has not been studied in the ICU but data can be extrapolated from ICU trials of similar 
fructo -oligosaccharides (FOS) .  To date, there are no reports of serious adverse effects or major 
intolerance with over 1,[ADDRESS_640482] been used up to 36 g/day for [ADDRESS_640483] enough that consideration of supplemental fiber has

Data on the effects of inulin -like FOS on infections in the 
ICU is scarce but promising.  Three double -blind, 
randomized ICU trials tested a commercial synbiotic 
containing Lactobacillus spp . and mixed soluble prebiotic 
fiber including some  inulin (up to 20 g/day total) .57-59  In 
these studies, the overall rates of ICU -acquired infections 
were 16 -27% lower in the group receiving prebiotic fiber,

This will be a double -blind, randomized, placebo -
controlled trial  with two doses . 
 
9. Intervention  
Block randomization (blocks of six) will be performed with 
1:1:1 random computer allocation of subjects into the 
three study arms.  In the two inulin arms, chicory root -
derived inulin (Cargill Inc., Wayzata, MN) will be diluted in 
250 ml of sterile water a nd given at 8 or 16 g twice daily 
(Figure 4 ).  The placebo arm will receive the same 
volume of sterile water twice daily, with the intervention 
given for [ADDRESS_640486] that these doses are likely to be safe and 
sufficient to confer benefit,26,36 even in the setting of 
critical illness.57,58,63,65  Subjects, investigators, and the 
treating ICU team will be blinded to the i ntervention arm, 
with blinding managed by [CONTACT_498101], de -identified, semi -opaque 
fluid bags containing inulin/placebo  in accordance with 
the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations governing labelling 
of new investigational drugs (21CFR 312.6) .  The intervention will be taken orally or given with 
enteric feeding by [CONTACT_498102], with the first dose a dministered within 
6 hours of ICU admission.  The time course for the intervention and remaining study assessments

assessment will be made on the day of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498074] 14.   
 
9.2.2. Rationale for dose .  In the ambulatory setting, inulin impacts SCFA producer levels at doses 
of 12 to 16 g/day, with biologic effects relevant for ICU patients (e.g., decreases in serum LPS 
and CRP).26,66  Approximately 16 g/day therefore represents the minimum dose at which an effect 
might  be seen; this was selected for the low dose arm of the study.  However, patients in these 
ambulatory studies were n ot critically ill and did not receive antibiotics.  It is possible that inulin 
will have lesser effects in the ICU compared to the ambulatory setting, and logical to test higher 
doses.  To select a maximum study dose, we referenced our own experience with dietary fiber in 
the prospective cohort and published tolerability data from ICU studies of inulin -like prebiotic fiber.  
In our prospective ICU cohort, 30 g/day was the maximum observed dose of dietary fiber, and 
was not associated with any intolerance.  In published literature, O’Keefe et al. reported tolerance 
up to a maximum of 36 g/day wheat dextran in the ICU.[ADDRESS_640493] ed 32 g/day for the 
high dose study arm because it lies between these values and is exactly double a dose with 
proven biologic activity.

The study team will work with the treating ICU team to ensure that the study drug is delivered in 
a timely manner.  The time and dose of each medication administration will be documented at 
each study assessment by [CONTACT_498104] 5  – February  24, [ADDRESS_640494] (EMR) .  Patients will be enrolled with a goal of adminis tering the 
intervention within [ADDRESS_640495] for differences between groups that may be 
slower to emerge (e.g., baseline vs Day 7 comparisons).  
 
10.1. Primary outcome : Relative abundance of SCFA producers through  ICU Day 3 .  The within -
individual change in the relative abundance of SCFA producers will be determined by 16S rRNA 
gene sequencing of rectal swabs and compared between intervention groups.  From extracted 
rectal swab DNA,  polymerase chain reaction (PCR) will be pe rformed on a Bio -Rad T100 Thermal 
Cycler (Bio -Rad, Hercules, CA) to amplify the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S ribosomal RNA 
gene with primers derived from Klindworth et al .67 appended with overhang sequences for 
compatibility with Illumina index and sequencing adapters ( Illumina , San Diego , CA).  The relative 
abundance of SCFA producers levels will be determined as the sum total across the bacterial 
species known to ferment the SCFA butyrate  and subtracted within each individual to obtain the 
change (Day 3 minus baseline) .39,45,68 -70   
 
10.2. Secondary outcome : MDRO colonization status on ICU Day 3 .  MDRO colonization status 
will be based on Day 3 rectal swab cultures, classified categorically and compared between 
intervention groups.  MDROs will be defined as methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus  
(MRSA), vancomycin -resistant Enterococcus  (VRE ), and MDR Gram negative bacteria71 (defined 
as Gram negatives with in vitro  non-susceptibility for third -generation ce phalosporins).72  Based 
on culture results, Day 3 MDRO colonization status will be classified categorically and compared 
between groups.   
 
10.3. Additional outcomes : 
10.3.1. Feasibility .  Descriptive demographic and clinical data will be compared across study 
groups to assess adequacy of randomization.  Summary statistics (count data) will be 
recorded for patients across all 3 intervention arms to assess feasibility as (1) the enrollment  
rate (enrolled)/(enrolled+refusals) over each 12 month period; (2) protocol adherence 
(proportion of randomized subjects who receive 1 or more doses of the allocated intervention); 
and (3) fidelity of the intervention (defined as the proportion of high/lo w inulin allocated vs 
received and also categorically as receipt of 90% or more allocated doses of inulin across 
groups).  Feasibility goals are as stated in Aim 1 . 
 
10.3.2. Rates of pre -specified AEs .  There  will be active ascertainment of AEs in the 
following categories, which will be compared between intervention gr oups.  This will be done 
through the end of the intervention period (ICU Day 7) and also through Day 30/discharge to 
assess for delayed AEs.  
 
 Stool frequency, measured by [CONTACT_498105] r eport by [CONTACT_498106] 24 hours preceding each assessment;  
 
 Stool consistency, measured by [CONTACT_498107] (0 -4) 
over the 24 hours preceding each assessment;

  Abdominal bloating, measured by [CONTACT_498108] (0 -3) 
over the 24 hours preceding each assessment.  
 
 Electrolyte abnormalities, measured by [CONTACT_498109], 
minimum/maximum values, and proportions of values outside the normal range.  This 
will be done for glucose, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, potassium, and sodium.  
 
 Nausea, vomiting, obstruction, and abdominal pain.  These will be recorded as present 
or absent based on bedside assessment of the subject or based on the nursing 
impres sion.  
 
 Culture -proven infections, which will be considered both an AE and an outcome (see 
10.3.4).  
 
10.3.3. Antibiotic resistance gene fraction on ICU Day 3 .  DNA will be extracted from rectal 
swabs (MoBio PowerFecal, Carlsbad, CA) and assessed using multi plex quantitative PCR 
(Qiagen Cat. No. 330261, Valencia, CA) for 87 common antibiotic resistance genes.73  Within -
individual differences in multiplex qPCR results will be compared from baseline to Day 3 both 
as summed changes and within relevant gene categories (e.g., β -lactamase resistance 
genes)  and compared between intervention groups . 
 
10.3.4. Culture -proven MDR infections through ICU Day 30 .  Antibiotic -resistant infections will 
be defined as those showing all of the following : (1) site -specific symptoms or signs of 
infection, (2) initiation of targeted antimicrobials by [CONTACT_498110], and (3) molecular 
diagnostics or cultures showing an MDRO as adapted from the CDC and NHSN74 and 
previously used by [CONTACT_27156]  (Table 4 ).[ADDRESS_640496]  period s: the intervention period

 11. Study p opulation  
 
11.1. Study setting  
Patients will be enrolled from medical ICUs affiliated with  Columbia University Medical Center.  
These ICUs include but are not limited to the following locations, all of which are in the general 
vicinity of Columbia University’s medical campus:   
ICU short 
designation  Full name  [CONTACT_23189][INVESTIGATOR_359879], 
floor location  Street address  
MICU -A Medical ICU -A Milstein, 4th floor [ADDRESS_640500] with a final t arget enrollment 
of 30:30:30 patients who complete a minimum of 3 days of assessments.  Specific inclusion and 
exclusion criteria  are as follows : 
 
11.2. Inclusion  criteria  
 
 Medical ICU .  Subjects will be newly a dmitted to one of two CUMC medical ICUs during the 
study enrollment  period;  
 
 Age.  Subjects will be e ighteen  or more  years old at the time of ICU admission ; 
 
 Sepsis .  Subjects will meet criteria for sepsis with life -threatening organ dysfunction caused 
by [CONTACT_80601] (Sepsis -[ADDRESS_640501] international consensu s definition , 2016) .81  According to  this 
definition,  life-threatening organ dysfunction is operationalized as an increase in the 
Sequential [Sepsis -Related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)82 score of ≥[ADDRESS_640502] a known or suspected infection, 
defined as sampling of blood or any other body fluid for infection with concurrent 
administration of approp riate antibiotics (see Table 4 );81    
 
 Appropriate  antibiotics .  Subjects will receive appropriate antibiotics, which will be 
operationalized as (1) among subjects with positive culture data, the antibiotics within classes 
where the organism is susceptible based on standard Clinical and Laboratory Standards 
Institute (CLSI) cut -offs72; or (2) among subjects receiving empi[INVESTIGATOR_126342]  (i.e., with 
negative cultures) , antibiotics within classes with significant anaerobic activity.  This will 
include β-lactam/β -lactamase inhibitor combin ation antibiotics, cephalosporins (generation 2  
or greater ), fluoroquinolones,  lincosamides (clindamycin), metronidazole , and monobactams 
(a.g., meropenem) .  Vancomycin monotherapy is intentionally excluded.  Antibiotic s must be 
received within 24  hours before ICU admission or be actively ordered at the time of bedside 
screening;    
 
Inulin in the ICU  
Protocol Version 5  – February  24, 2020  
Page 17 of 37  
  Prompt intervention .  Subjects will complete study enrollment within [ADDRESS_640503] set of 
recorded ICU vital signs will  define the time of ICU admission.   
 
11.3. Exclusion criteria  
 Inability to receive oral or enteric fluids .  Patients  will be excluded if they are nil per os  or are 
unable to take fluid by [CONTACT_498111] ; 
 
 Inulin a llergy .  Patients  will be excluded for safety reasons if they have a known chicory allergy.  
Serious chicory allergies are exceedingly rare a lthough mild respi[INVESTIGATOR_498079] -
mediated fo od allergies have been reported;83 
 
 Hyponatremia .  Patients  will be excluded for hyponatremia with serum sod ium ≤ 128 mEq/L 
because the intervention will be delivered in 500 ml of free water daily.   If subjects  develop 
hyponatremia (serum sodium serum sodium 125 -128 mEq/L) after enrollment and 
randomization  which persists at the time the subject is due to receive the study intervention , 
the study team will confer with the treating ICU team regarding whether the intervention should 
be deferred or further concentrated  in order to minimize free water.   If subjects develop severe  
hyponatremia (serum sodium serum sodium ≤124 mEq/L) after enrollment and randomization, 
the intervention will be withheld  until 2 consecuti ve serum sodium values are within normal 
limits ; 
 
 Immunosuppression .  Patients will be excluded if they have immunosuppression, as CD4 
count <200 or absolute neutrophil count <500 or reasonable expectation of either during the 
study intervention period .  We believe that the inulin works by [CONTACT_498112] .  
Excluding patients who lack the ability to mount an immune response improves trial 
homogeneity ; 
 
 Surgery involving the intestinal lumen .  Patients will be excluded for surgeries involving the  
intestinal lumen within [ADDRESS_640504] risk for such  symptoms  and 
will therefore be excluded;  
 
 DNR or DNI status .  Such patients have limited treatment goals and will be exc luded to 
minimize heterogeneity;  
 
 No LAR .  Patients  will be excluded if they lack capacity for consent and have no appropriate 
Legally Authorized Representative (LAR)  to act as surrogate decision -maker . 
  
12. Enrollment strategy  
Patients will be identified at the time of ICU bed allocation and screened for inclusion/ exclusion 
criteria.  After consultation with the treating ICU team,  subjects who meet screening criteria will 
have the eligibility evaluation completed at the ICU bedside .  This will be done  after first obtaining 
agreement from the m edical ICU attending of record that the patient/surrogate can be approached 
for the study .  We anticipate  that >50% of patients will lack decision -making capacity and will 
accept consent from a surrogate in these situations , as previously described by [CONTACT_27156] .37  
Issues related to altered capacity, privacy and time for decision -making, consent of LARs, and 
ongoing consent are discussed in detail in the Human Subjects and Recruitment and Safety 
Inulin in the ICU

at the time of ICU admission.  
 
Compliance statement regarding consent  
This research will meet the requirements of 10 U.S. Code 980  for experimental human subjects 
research that “(1) the informed consent of the subject is obtained in advance; or (2) in the case of 
research intended to be beneficial to the subject, the informed consent may be obtained from a 
legal representative of the  subject.”  
 
Retention  
Potential loss of patients after randomization will be from death/discharge prior to ICU Day 3, or 
withdrawal of consent (e.g., after initial surrogate consent).  In our ongoing ICU cohort studies , 
there has been  11.3% mortality withi n 3 days and a 0% Day [ADDRESS_640506] through a secure, web -based system managed by 
[CONTACT_498113] (DCC)  headed by [CONTACT_498114].  This password -
protected system  is based on the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) platform.  The 
Research Nurse will use paper clinical research forms (CRFs) to document the initial screening 
process.  When this information is entered into REDCap, the sy stem will automatically generate 
a subject identifier and randomization code using 1:1:1 randomization in randomly permuted 
blocks of 6.  This randomization code will be electronically communicated to the research 
pharmacy along with a separate key which w ill allow them to identify the random assignment.  
The Columbia Research Pharmacy will prepare the study intervention in indistinguishable  semi -
opaque fluid bags .  Although inulin is readily soluble at the study doses, the opacity of these bags 
will elimin ate any possibility that a small amount of precipi[INVESTIGATOR_498080].  Five drops of non -caloric flavoring syrup 
(McKesson Supply, Yonkers, NY, Product #570727) will be placed into the reconstituted 
inulin/placebo to prevent any possibility of accidental unblinding based on taste  in patients who 
are alert .  The patient, treating ICU team  including the ICU nurse , and study team will remain 
blinded to each assignment until the completion of th e trial, with the DCC preparing unblinded 
safety reports for the DSMO at pre -specified intervals.    
 
12.1.1. Clinical need for unblinding  
It seems  unlikely that clinical need for unblinding will arise.  If this occurs, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_498081] t o facilitate unblinding for the treating ICU team.  In any case of unblinding, data 
collection and follow -up will be maintained and the patient analyzed per -protocol.     
 
12.2. Delivery of the intervention  
The treating medical team will order the study intervention as a non -formulary medication to be 
delivered by [CONTACT_338460], as they would  any other medication , and the study team will work to 
ensure prompt delivery of the intervention with a goal of having it  delivered within 24  hours from 
Inulin in the ICU  
Protocol Version 5  – February  24, [ADDRESS_640507] to drink the liquid formulation or, in 
subjects who are not taking or al medications, by [CONTACT_498115]’s oral or 
nasogastric tube.  The time of dosing will be recorded electronically within the patient EMR and 
documented by [CONTACT_498116].   
 
12.3. Premature cessation of  the intervention  
Efforts will be made to ensure that all subjects who are randomized receive the study intervention.  
The initial medication order will specify that the study intervention is to be given q12h for a total 
of 14 doses.  The study interventio n will be stopped under the following conditions:  
 
 Death;  
 
 Discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307];  
 
 Request to withdraw from the study by [CONTACT_498117].  This request can be made 
at any time, without providing a reason.  Consent to continue data collection  and retain 
samples already collected will be sought in these situations;  
 
 Definite clinical indication or contraindication becomes apparent.  If the treating ICU team 
feels  at any time that the patient needs  or should not have fiber supplementation, the 
intervention will be immediately halted.  The patients will remain in the study for follow -up 
and the intervention will be held as long as the indi cation/contraindication remains.  I n 
general, i f the in dication/contraindication resolves  within the 7 day timeframe of the 
intervention, the intervention will be resumed .  If the intervention is withheld for 
hyponatremia, the intervention will be resumed only once 2 consecutive serum sodium 
values are within normal limits ; 
 
 Adverse or serious adverse event  related to the study intervention.  Such events will 
constitute unanticipated problems.  The patient will remain in the study for follow -up, but 
no further interventions will be administered.  
 
13. Study assessments  
The total study duration will be no more  than [ADDRESS_640508] recorded set of ICU vital signs . 
Samples will be gathered and bedside assessments made at the following intervals after ICU 
admission or unt il hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] /death : baseline, 3 days , 7 days, 14 days, and 30 days.  
During study assessments, data will be combined  from the following sources: (1) samples 
collected by [CONTACT_3476],  (2) bedside assessments, and (3) data from the EMR . 
 
13.1 Sample collection  and storage  
Sample collection is focused around rectal swabs  because the timing of swabs (as opposed to 
whole stools) can be precisely dictated and because rectal colonization with MDR bacteria best 
reflects overall MDR colonization status84-88 and risk for subsequent infection.89  Samples are 
described below.  
 
 Rectal swabs .  At each study assessment, deep flocked nylon swabs of the rectum will be 
performed in duplicate to allow independent processing of swabs for 16S rRNA gene 
sequencing/multiplex qPCR and for bacterial culture of MDROs.  Swabs will be inserted 5 cm 
rectally with patients in the left lateral decubitus position and rotated 5 times, with adequate 
Inulin in the ICU  
Protocol Version 5  – February  24, 2020  
Page 20 of 37  
 sampling verified by [CONTACT_498118].  Swabs to be sequenced will be flash -frozen at 
-80ºC for long -term cold storage90 and batched extraction;91 swabs to be cultured will be 
transported on soy broth with 20% glycerol (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) for culture 
or, when culture cannot be perform ed immediately, for storage overnight at 4º C and culture 
the following morning.92 
 
 Whole stools .  Nursing staff will collect the first spontaneous whole stool subsequent  to each 
study assessment.  4 x 8 ml aliquots of stool will be flash -frozen and stored at -80 º C.  
 
 Oral swabs .  Two cotton -tipped oral swabs will be used to gather a composite of the oral flora 
by [CONTACT_498119] x 10 each: left cheek, right cheek, hard palate, 
tongue, floor of the mouth, and maxillary gingivae (same as the Human Microbiome Project).93  
Swabs will be flash frozen at -80 º C.  
 
 Urine .  ICU nurses will withdraw [ADDRESS_640509] technique from the urinary 
catheter sampling port.  In patients who lack a urinary catheter, clean catch urine samples will 
be accepted and aliquoted as above.  
 
 Blood .  Residual blood from clinical samples drawn immediately prior to each study 
assessment will be retrieved by  [CONTACT_3476].  For each subject, one 6 mL serum -separator 
and one 8 mL EDTA tube will be retrieved.  Buffy coat will be separated by [CONTACT_498120] 1 -2 mL aliquots generated for plasma/buffy coat and stored at -[ADDRESS_640510] s the need for an additional blood draw.   
 
Oral swabs, urine, and blood will be stored for future testing.  The rationale for collecting these 
additional samples is that they are non -invasive, can be easily collected, and will provide 
opportunities for fu ture studies seeking to explore additional markers or mechanisms (e.g., urinary 
3-indoxyl sulfate for gut microbiome disruption94 or micro -RNAs in sepsis).95  All sample storage 
will be in the PI’s -80ºC freezer unit (P&S -8) except for the fresh rectal swab used for culture 
which will be stored within the Uhlemann lab (P&S -9).  Assays performed from  rectal s wabs and 
whole stools (SCFAs) are  described below.  
 
13.2. Sample a ssays  
The assays described below will be performed from rectal swabs or whole stools (for fecal SCFA 
levels ).  Residual sample material will be retained in -80ºC storage for the duration of the study.  
 
 16S rRNA gene sequencing .  16S rRNA gene sequencing will be performed to determine 
the primary outcome .  From extracted rectal swab DNA,  polymerase chain reactio n 
(PCR) will be performed on a Bio -Rad T100 Thermal Cycler (Bio -Rad, Hercules, CA) to 
amplify the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene with primers derived 
from Klindworth et al.67 appended with overhang sequences for compatibility with Illumina 
index and sequencing adapters ( Illumina , San Diego , CA).  Samples will be purified with 
Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Jersey City, NY) and quantified using 
the Quant -iT broad range dsDNA Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ). 
Libraries will be normalized, pooled, and denatured in p reparation for cluster generation 
and sequencing, which will be performed  on the Illumina  MiSeq  300PE.  
 
 Bacterial culture .  Aerobic culture will be performed to determine the secondary outcome .  
Culture has been selected for the primary outcome because cu lture identifies viable 
bacteria, remains the most common clinical method for testing for MDRO colonization in 
Inulin in the ICU  
Protocol Version 5  – February  24, [ADDRESS_640511] Gram negatives, which cause 94% of all MDR bacterial infections 
in the ICU.6  Rectal swabs will be gently vortexed to dissociate DNA from the swabs into 
the broth media.  Media will then be split into  equal aliquots and plated under a laminar 
flow hood for MRSA (Spectra -MRSA, Remel), VRE (Spectra -VRE, Remel), and ESBL or 
Klebsiella pneumonia  carbapenemase (KPC) -producing bacteria (Uhlemann lab).  In 
addition, we will plate cultures on Gram -negative selective agar (MacConkey II agar, 
Becton Dickinson) directly and at three serial dilutions for semi -quantitation (10-2, 10-4, and 
10-6).  While t he main  analysis will be based on a categorical classification of MDROs 
(present vs absent), an exploratory analysis will be conducted using semi -quantitative 
culture data.  Preliminary data show that these dilutions will yield a countable number of 
coloni es.  After 18 -24 hours of aerobic growth, selective plates will be classified as positive 
vs negative for growth according to the media characteristics.  The colony -forming units 
(CFUs) on the non -selective plates for Gram positives/negatives will be count ed to provide 
relative quantification of each MDRO based on the total CFU counts from the non -
selective plates.  If multiple non -selective plates show growth, the plate with 10 -100 
colonies will be used for CFU counting with results normalized to the 10-2 plate.  From 
these plates, organisms will be identified using the VITEK 2 system (bioMerieux) and AST -
N010/020 cards with confirmatory testing as needed.  Resistant isolates will be stored for 
whole genome sequencing analyses.  
 
 Quantitative PCR .  Quantitat ive PCR for resistan ce genes will be performed as an 
additional outcome.  DNA will be extracted from rectal swabs (MoBio PowerFecal, 
Carlsbad, CA) and assessed using multiplex quantitative PCR (Qiagen Cat. No. 330261, 
Valencia, CA) for 87 common antibiotic  resistance genes.73  In this assay, 250 ng of 
template genomic DNA will be added to each reaction on a 96 -well plate which will be run 
on a StepOnePLus RT -PCR machine using the following cycling conditions: initial 
denaturation for [ADDRESS_640512] the presence of bacterial DNA, 
PCR inhibitors and background (no template control (NTC)).  PCR cycle thresholds (C T) 
of <35 w ill be considered positive for the presence of any given gene.  Adequate reactions 
will be determined by C T values of  <29 for pan -bacterial reference genes (e.g., 16S rRNA , 
gyrA, recA, rpoB )100 and positive PCR controls (PPC) C T values of  <24.  Linearity and 
sensitivity for this PCR have been determined using synthetic templates over a 6 -log serial 
dilution ranging from 1 to 1 million copi[INVESTIGATOR_014], with results verified across multiple an tibiotic 
resistance genes using pyrosequencing.73 
 
 Fecal SCFA levels .  Fecal SCFAs levels will be assayed as an additional outcome .  Whole 
stools will be aliquoted and diluted with 80% ethanol to be agitated at 4°C.  After 
centrifugation, 20 µl of supernatant from the homogenized samples will be mixed with 20 
µl of 200 mM N -(3-Dimethylaminopropyl) -N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (1 -EDC HCl) 
in 5% pyridine and 40 uL of 100 mM 2 -Nitrophenylhydrazine (2 -NPH) in 80% acetonitr ile 
(ACN) with 50 mM HCl.  After a brief incubation, ACN will be added to the solution which 
will be injected onto a 6490 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Agilent, Santa Clara, 
CA) and tested for concentrations of the SCFAs butyrate, acetate, and propi [INVESTIGATOR_16847].  
 
13.3. Bedside assessments  including data gathered from the EMR    
During each study assessment, a study -specific Case Report Form (CRF) will be used to record 
the following data: origin for admission (classified as from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13334], operating  room, 
emergency room, or outside ICU transfer based on the most recent location prior to CUMC ICU 
Inulin in the ICU  
Protocol Version 5  – February  24, 2020  
Page 22 of 37  
 admission ); the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS);101 the use of life support (classified as present vs 
absent) including the use of mechanical ventilation, hemodialysis, or additional life -support 
devices such  as extra -corporeal membrane oxygen (ECMO) or an intra -atrial balloon pump 
(IABP); and the presence or absence of intravenous lines or catheters including a central venous 
catheter, urinary catheter, arterial catheter, nasal or oral gastric tube, or rectal  tube.  Using 
duplicate data entry, anonymized CRF  data will be transferred into the  secure REDCap database.  
Additional clinical variables will be entered directly into REDCap from the EMR.  These variables 
will include laboratory analyses, all of  the com ponent variables of the Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (SOFA) score ,82 measures re lated to nutritional intake, and ICU interventions 
including administration of vasopressors, proton pump inhibitors, and antibiotics (with the n ame 
of the antibiotic and route of administration recorded) . 
 
13.3.1. Tolerability  
Patients who are alert  will be asked regarding abdominal bloating which will be graded on a 4 -
point Likert scale (0=none, 1=a little, 2=a moderate amount, 3=a lot/severe).  When patients are 
not alert, this will be graded as “unable.”  ICU n urses will be asked to grade  the average 
consistency of stools within each preceding 24 hours on a 5 -point scale (0=like water, 1=like 
porridge, 2=loose but with chunks, 3=formed, soft, 4= formed, hard).  This information will also be 
recorded from the EMR into REDCap as a separate entry.  When subjects have no stools within 
the preceding 24 hours, this will be recorded as “no stools.”  The frequency of stools within the 
preceding 24 hours w ill be recorded as an integer at each study assessment.   Again, this will be 
done based both on the nurse’s in -person report and separately based on EMR documentation.  
 
ICU nurses will be additionally asked re garding the presence or  absence of the followin g 
symptoms during the 24 hour period prior to each study assessment: nausea, vomiting, bowel 
obstruction, and abdominal pain.  This data will be recorded categorically on the CRFs/REDCap 
and will appear on DSMO reports.  
 
13.3.2. Nutriti onal intake  
Information related to nutritional intake will be gathered from the EMR including goal calories, 
actual calories consumed, and the amount of dietary fiber consumed in grams.  All ICU patients 
at our institution receive a complete clinical nutritional asses sment with calculation of goal calories 
based on the Penn State Equation102 with the modified equation used for individuals >60 years 
old or those with BMI >30 as described by [CONTACT_498121]. in 2009.103,104  Actual calories and 
grams of fiber consumed will be based on the specific components of the tube feeds received or, 
among patients on an ad lib diet, the food consumed.  The nutritional components of all CUMC 
diets are completely specified in terms of calories, fat, protein, carbohydrate, and fiber content.  
To calculate calories and fiber consumed, the study team will refer to the proportion of  each meal 
consumed as recorded by [CONTACT_498122].  In those receiving tube feedings, the interval number of tube feeding 
interruptions will be recorded at each assessment or recorde d as 0 in those receiving ad lib  diets.  
 
13.3.3. Long -term telephone follow -up 
Telephone interviews will be conducted with subjects or their surrogates 3 months after ICU 
admission and again 6 months after ICU admission.  In the event that subjects are still 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], these interviews will be conducted at the bedside.  Vital stat us will be ascertained 
and, to minimize loss of follow -up information, we will interview subjects or surrogates to 
determine  (1) discharge location type (classified as home, short -term rehabilitation, or long -term 
rehabilitation including skilled care faci lities), (2) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498082] -CUMC facilities after 
ICU discharge, (3) physician office visits after ICU discharge, and (4) infections or other adverse 
events after ICU discharge.  If there are non -CUMC hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498083] 5  – February  24, 2020  
Page 23 of 37  
 interactions, permission will be requested to obtain relevant records to determine the nature of 
infections and to assess for potential medium - to long -term AEs related to the study intervention.  
Among surviving subjects, the EQ-5D-5L (EuroQol 2009) will be u sed to determine health status 
across the domains of mobility, self -care, activity levels, pain, and anxiety/depression.76,[ADDRESS_640513] -ICU 
assessment of overall well -being after a three -round modified Delphi process involving clinical 
researchers from over 16 countries, patients/caregivers, clinicians, and research funders.[ADDRESS_640514] -ICU disability using 
Katz’ Index of Independence in ADLs  (Activities of Daily Living).79  Altho ugh focused on functional 
status rather than well -being, Katz’ ADLs has been validated as an important patient -centered 
outcome across dozens of populations and unlike the EQ -5D-5L has high agreement between 
patients and caregivers.[ADDRESS_640515] bedside data, while rea dily available selected electronic data (e.g., 
laboratory values) will either be directly “pulled” from Columbia clinical servers and merged into 
the REDCap database or manually entered into REDCap .  REDCap ‘Events’ will be specified 
corresponding to the study assessment timepoints: baseline, Days 3, 7, 14, 30 , 3 months, and 6 
months.  D ata of each type will be associated in the system with the appropriate time period.  
REDCap “Anytime”  functionality will be used to capture adverse events and other incidents  that 
can occur at any time, i.e. events that are not associated with fixed time periods.  The REDCap 
system has built -in data verification aspects that will be utilized for the trial including minimum and 
maximum ranges and other logical checks, and autom atic checks for completion of individual 
items and forms.  
 
14.1. Data security within REDCap  
The servers on which DCC REDCap project data are stored are located in a physically and 
electronically secure environment maintained by [CONTACT_498123].  The 
DCC confirms project data access privileges on a monthly basis, and REDC ap requires strong 
passwords, which must be changed periodically.  In this trial, to ensure data security, explicit 
identifiers needed for recruitment and scheduling (names, addresses, phone numbers, email 
addresses, medical record numbers) will be maintai ned separately and will not be stored in the 
REDCap database . 
 
14.2. Record retention  
All electronic and paper records will be retained for a minimum of [ADDRESS_640516] retention will be prolonged 
beyond 6 years as necessary if required by [CONTACT_498124].  
 
15. Safety and adverse events  (AEs)  
Inulin in the ICU  
Protocol Version 5  – February  24, 2020  
Page 24 of 37  
 Adverse health events, laboratory irregularities, and even death are expected in ICU patients  with 
sepsis  and it would be difficult or impossible to accurate ly document and label all  adverse health 
events .  This is a common problem faced by [CONTACT_498125].  The solution recommended by [CONTACT_498126] (e.g., Cook et al .) is to pre -specify AEs of interest for careful 
monitoring .  In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_498084], this study will produce d etailed  reports of these AEs 
for the DSMC  at standard intervals while only unanticipated problems  that also meet criteria for 
serious adverse events (SAEs) will be  reported to the DSMC in real time .[ADDRESS_640517] received one or more doses of the intervention.  This study has pre -
specified  AEs in the following categories.  
 
 Bloating : graded 0 -3 based on patient report: patient mean and maximum values will be 
reported;  
 
 Stool consistency and frequency : graded 0 -4 for consistency and with an integer denoting 
frequency over 24 hours based on nursing report.  For each patient, m ean and maximum 
values will be reported;  
 
 Electrolyte imbalances : For each patient , the minimum and maximum values for serum 
calcium, magnesium, phosphate, potassium, and sodium will be reported .  This will be 
done for the 7 days of the intervention per iod and separately from Day 7 through Day 
30/discharge;  
 
 Gastrointestinal AEs : the gastrointestinal AEs of nausea, vomiting, bowel obstruction, and 
abdominal pain will be recorded as present or absent for each assessment and separated 
from other AEs to improve early pattern recognition  by [CONTACT_498127] ;   
 
 Infection s: Infections are both an AE and an outcome and will be adjudicated as previously 
described.  For each infection, the date of the infection, suspected site, organism, an d 
antibiotics received will be recorded.  Infections will be further classified as MDR vs non -
MDR  using the criteria previously described ; 
 
 Death : death will be gathered from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_36843], which inerfaces with the social 
security death index . 
 
15.1. Serious adverse events  
Federal Regulation [ADDRESS_640518]. 7, 1997 defines SAEs as those events occurring at any dose which:  
 
 Result in death;  
 
 Are life -threatening, meaning the patient was at risk for death at the time of the event;  
 
 Require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498085];  
 
 Results in significant disability or incapacity;  
 
 Is a congenital abnormality/birth defect;  
 
 Or does not meet these criteria but is thought by [CONTACT_498128].  
 
Inulin in the ICU  
Protocol Version 5  – February  24, 2020  
Page 25 of 37  
 SAEs in this trial will be AEs  meeting the above Fed. Reg. 62 definition.  
 
15.2. Adjudicating and reporting adverse events  as unanticipated problems  
Unanticip ated problems (UP s) will be any unforeseen medical event thought likely related to the 
study intervention.  Such events will be monitored for in real time .  UPs  that do not meet criteria 
for seriousness (same as SAE criteria) will be reported to the DSMO and IRB at pre -specified 
intervals.  UPs that meet criteria for seriousness will be reported within 24 hours from our 
notificatio n of the event .  This reporting will include:  
 
 Contact [CONTACT_498129];  
 
 Contact [CONTACT_498130];  
 
 Fax or email scan containing when the event  occurred, the name [CONTACT_225982], callback 
information, the protocol number, and a description of the event ; 
 
 Availability of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_498086] -up information regarding the event . 
 
The proposed research is pending review by [CONTACT_498131] (IRB #AAA S2576 ) and 
will be reviewed by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command ([LOCATION_003]MRMC) Offic e 
of Research Protections (ORP), Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) prior to 
implementation.  Prior to initiation of research, the study will be regi stered on clinicaltrials.gov .    
 
Safety and adverse effects will be overseen  by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_498087] (DSMO) .  Daniel Brodie , the Director of the Medical Intensive Care Units at 
our institution will serve as the trial D SMO and will convene an appropriate Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC) to oversee interim study results .  The primary responsibility of the 
DSMC will be to review interim data in terms of safety and make recommendations whether the 
study should be ch anged, halted, or terminated.  Full details of the DSMC procedures and 
processes as well as additional details regarding AE and SAE reporting are  in the DSMP.  
 
15.2.1. Compliance statement regarding research monitoring  
The DSMB under [CONTACT_498138]  will functi on as a Research Monitor  and is responsible to oversee 
the safety of the research and report observations/findings to the IRB or a designated institutional 
official. The Research Monitor will review all unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or  
others associated with the protocol and provide an independent report of the event to the IRB. 
The Research Monitor may discuss the research protocol with the investigators; shall have 
authority to stop a research protocol in progress, remove individual h uman subjects from a 
research protocol, and take whatever steps are necessary to protect the safety and well -being of 
human subjects until the IRB can assess the monitor’s report; and shall have the responsibility to 
promptly report their observations and findings to the IRB or other designated official and the 
HRPO . 
 
15.3. Unblinding for adverse events  
All possible efforts will be made to retain blinding for the duration of the trial.  However, if a treating 
clinician feels that blinding must be removed in  order to assess a possible adverse reaction quickly 
and correctly, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_498088].  
 
16. Study termination and completion  
Inulin in the ICU  
Protocol Version 5  – February  24, [ADDRESS_640519] complete ac cess both to 
the raw data and to the analytic code used by [CONTACT_498132] a qualified 
monitor who will review this work for rigor.  Once this is complete, the primary and secondary 
outcomes will be finalized.  At this point, the lock ed data will be made available to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_498089].  For all analyses, alpha <0.05 will be considered statistically 
significant and two -sided testing will be performed.  When death is a competing risk, Fine and 
Gray re gression analyses will be performed.  
 
17.2. Determination of the primary and secondary outcomes  
 
Primary outcome: within -individual change in relative abundance of SCFA producers .  16S rRNA 
gene sequencing data will be processed using the QIIME platform with appropriate rarification 
and filtering .107  The primary analysis will be intent -to-treat, restricted to the subjects who complete 
the Day 3 assessment and contribute data .  Within -individual change in SCFA producers will be 
calculated as Day 3  minus baseline relative abundance and an  ANOVA or Kruskal -Wallis (KW) 
test (if skewed data) will be used to assess for differences across the three groups .  If there is no 
significant difference be tween the low - and high -dose inulin arms, these arms will be combined 
for comparison against placebo in the final analysis using a two -sample t -test or rank -sum test.  
Although the primary analysis will be with the Day 3 samples, unadjusted and adjusted 
longitudinal data analysis will be performed using the generalized estimating equation approach 
with working independence correlation structure.  
 
Secondary outcome: MDRO colonization .  Subjects who culture positive from rectal swabs from 
Day [ADDRESS_640520] or Fisher’s test.  For this analysis, patients 
in the inulin arms will be combined if testing s hows no significant difference between these inulin  
arms.  Because baseline colonization status is likely to be an important predictor of Day [ADDRESS_640521] whether baseline MDRO colonization rates differ between 
intervention groups.  If such a difference is observed, we will reanalyze  Day 3 MDRO colonization 
with stratification according to baseline MDRO colonization (baseline MDR O colonized vs not 
colonized).  Exploratory analyses will examine Day [ADDRESS_640522] size estimate for future trials.    
 
17.3. Power calculation and sample size  
 
Inulin in the ICU  
Protocol Version 5  – February  24, 2020  
Page 27 of 37  
 Primary outcome: within -individual change in relative abundance of SCFA producers .  The study 
is powered to detect a difference in SCFA producer levels that is equal to or greater than the 
observed difference in SCFA producer levels from our prospective cohort (6.6% for high vs 3.7% 
low dietary fiber).  The rationale for this is that inul in must be at least as impactful as mixed dietary 
fiber to be a viable therapeutic.  The proposed sample size of 30:30:30 will yield 80% power to 
detect a minimum difference of 0.[ADDRESS_640523] deviations (SD) comparing any one inulin arm to 
the placebo arm u sing a two -sided t -test with 0.[ADDRESS_640524] 80% power to detect a minimum 0.[ADDRESS_640525] 80% power to detect 0.[ADDRESS_640526] at the .05 significance 
level.  
 
Secondary outcome: MDRO colonization .  Power calculations were performed using the observed 
42% rate of MDRO colonization in our prospective ICU cohort and 1:1:[ADDRESS_640527] based on the binomial distribution.  Under these 
assumptions, a sample size of 90 patients will yield 80% power to detect a 20.4% or less rate of 
MDRO colonization on Day 7 with inulin, assuming that the two inulin arms are combined.  If the 
inulin arms are not combined, there will be 80% power for a 17.3% or less rate of Day 7 MDRO 
colonization comparing any one inulin intervention arm vs placebo.  The two -sided 95% 
confidence interval for the effect size estimate within the combined inulin arms would be 7.1 to 
26.6% for an estimate centered on 15% and 10.8 to 32.3% for an estimate centered on 20%.  
 
17.4. Interim analyses  
Interim analyses will be performed for safety, and the DSMC will have the ability to halt the trial 
at any time.  Full DSMP reports will be produced after 10, 20, 30, and [ADDRESS_640528] approach and targeting an excess rate of toxic death of no 
more than 5%.  Toxicity will be monitored for each arm at the same [ADDRESS_640529] 0.05 when the dose -
limiting toxicity is equal to 0.05.  Toxic death will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_6802] .  There are no plans 
for futility monitoring because of the re latively small size of the proposed trial, non -invasiveness 
of the samples collected, and the potential for longitudinal study results to add significant 
mechanistic understanding to MDRO colonization in the ICU.  
 
18. Publication policy  
Study results will be disseminated  as widely as possible by [CONTACT_498133].  The PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_498090].  Funding sources will be 
recognized.

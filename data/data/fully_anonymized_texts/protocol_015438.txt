Version date: August 14 2014   1 BACKGROUND and SIGNIFICANCE  
1.1 ExAblate MR Guided Focused Ultrasound Treatments  
ExAblate MR Guided Focused Ultrasound is an  attractive modality for non -invasive 
thermal ablation of soft tissue tumors [1-6].  Treatment begins by [CONTACT_35947] a series of 
MR images of the target tissue. The physician then reviews the images on the ExAblate 
system workstation, identifies a target volume on the MR image s, delineates the 
treatment contours on the images, and reviews the treatment plan. Therapy planning 
software calculates the parameters required to effectively treat the defined region. During 
the treatment, an ultrasound transducer generates a point of fo cused ultrasound energy, 
called a sonication .  The sonication raises the tissue temperature within a well -defined 
region, causing a thermal coagulation effect. MR images acquired during sonication 
provide a quantitative, real -time temperature map of the en tire field -of-view around the 
target area to confirm the location of the sonication and the size of the coagulated region. 
The sonication process is repeated at multiple adjacent points to cover the entire 
prescribed treatment volume.  
1.2 Movement Disorders  
Stereotactic radiofrequency lesioning and deep brain stimulation (DBS) have been used 
to treat a number of neurological and psychiatric diseases. Today, DBS is more 
commonly used to treat movement disorders, predominantly Parkinson's disease (PD), 
essential  tremor (ET), and dystonia.  In this study, the investigation will be limited to 
treatment of movement disorders [7] as related  to ET patients.  
1.2.[ADDRESS_457965] common movement disorder with an estimated prevalence 
between 0.3% and 5.55% [8-12].  Recent epi[INVESTIGATOR_147709]1 indicate that prevalence 
across 19 countries (pooled ) was 0.9%, but increased  to 4.6% among those 65 years and as 
high as  21.7% in those aged 95 and older .  The condition is a genetically inherited disorder 
with a child of an ET person having a 50% chance of inheriting a gene causing the 
condition.  Approximately 50 -70% of people diagnosed with ET have a positive family 
history for the condition.  Caucasians ar e 5 times more likely to report physician diagnoses 
of ET than are African Americans ; Hispanics have  a rate between them .  Gender 
predisposition as reported in various articles is variable depending upon the author’s 
population . 
ET is a slowly progressive neurological disorder characterized by a tremor of the arms or 
hands that occurs during voluntary movements (intentio n tremor), such as eating/drinking 
and writing.  The tremor may also present in the head (neck) and jaw and may affect 
voice.  The disease may present in the teens or in the 40 -50 age range.  Generally, tremor

types of tremor may also present, including postural tremor of the outstretched arms, and 
intentional tremor (below 5 Hz) and rest tremor of the arms.  The amplitude of an 
intention tremor increases as an extremity approaches the  endpoint of deliberate and 
visually guided movement (hence the name [CONTACT_147727]). An intention tremor is 
usually perpendicular to the direction of movement. An intention tremor causes the 
person to overshoots or un dershoots their target, ( dysmetria).   
ET is commonly viewed as a pure movement disorder with a relatively benign clinical 
course, but specialists familiar with movement disorders recognize its associated features 
and disabling aspects [13].  Gait abnormalities and ataxia may accompany severe ET [14, 
15], and patients may progress to develop head tremor [11] that results in more postural 
instability [16].  Cognitive deficits with v erbal fluency, naming, and verbal memory have 
also been demonstrated during neuropsychological testing in patients with ET [17].  
While tremor is not medically dangerous, it is very disabling and affects mental status as 
well as functioning at home and in the work place [18].  In fact, Lorenz et. al . have 
demonstrated that patients with ET suffer more from the mental effects on quality of life 
measures than from the actual physical symptom [18].  Patients with ET may have lower 
perceived health status [19], and some suffer significantly from social phobias [20], and 
depression [21].   The degree of tremor does not always correlate with the severity of 
disability resulting from ET [22], and so it is not surprising that the number of ET 
patients wh o may benefit from treatment is likely underestimated [21].  
Up to 30% of tremor patients do not respond to first -line medical therapy, and thus may 
consider surgical treatment options [23].  It has long been known that stereotactic 
lesioning of the thalamus controls tremor, but the original targets were controversial [24].  
Improved imaging with MRI and refined electrophysiological lo calization over the past 
two decades have revealed that the Vim nucleus of the thalamus is the most effective 
target, integrating the inflow of cerebellothalamic projections with proprioceptive and 
kinesthetic sensory information.  Furthermore, an abundanc e of tremor cells which fire 
synchronously with the peripheral tremor can be recorded in this region [25].  With 
electr ophysiological confirmation and identification of these cells, very small volumes of 
Vim (~40 mm3) can be targeted for effective treatment [26].  
Both stereotactic RF -thalamotomy and DBS targeted to the Vim have proven effective 
for the treatment of ET and other tremors [27].  Numerous studies of Vim ablation and 
stimulation have demonstrated dramatic improvements of appendicular tremors in ET, 
and prospective and retrospective comparisons of the two report s similar control rates of 
tremor with 69 -90% improvement in appendicular symptoms [28, 29] .  Qualitative and 
quantitative measures  have been used to depi[INVESTIGATOR_366339] [30].  Axial tremors also improve with Vim stimulation [31, 32]  
including those tremors that extend to the voice [33].  Most importantly, quality of life in 
ET improves with unilateral and bilateral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_366340] [34-36].    
A long term study of RF -thalamotomy, however, revealed that nearly 12% of treated 
patients experienced tremor recurrence when followed for a mean of 8.6 years [37].  DBS 
is now much more widely accept ed because the therapy is reversible and adjustable.  
InSightec  
 
InSightec Confidential  Page 8 of 86 
Version date: August 14 2014   Thalamic DBS is associated with long term tremor benefits [38], but tolerance to 
thala mic stimulation can occur in up to 30% of cases [38-41].  Furthermore, DBS has its 
own inherent hardware -related complications, infection, expense, maintenance demands 
and other risks mentioned above.  
The non -invasive high -intensity focused ultrasound has been coupled with high 
resolution MRI to provide precise, consistent treatments tha t can be monitored in real -
time.  The development of phased array transducers allows for tightly focused treatment 
volumes and for the ability to compensate for distortions by [CONTACT_147716] [42-44].  
The landmark advance in the ExAblate Tc MRgFUS for neurosurgeons occurred as the 
ability to sonicate through the intact cranium was achieved with phased array transducers 
and acoustic modeling using CT reconstructions of the skull [39, 42 -45].  By [CONTACT_366385],  the ExAblate system allows  detailed treatment 
plans  to be performed and real time intra-procedure monitoring [5].  Standard MR 
sequences have been shown to reliably predict tissue damage during thermal lesioning 
with ultrasound [5, 46] .   The precision of the technology has already been demonstrated 
in animal models [47] and is currently being investigated in humans with brain tumors 
[48] and neuropathic pain synd romes [49].   Unlike stereotactic radiosurgery, the 
treatment can be monitored co ntinuously in real time with MRI and MR -thermography 
[4, 50 -55].  We anticipate that the ExAblate Tc MRgFUS non -invasive thermal lesioning 
is similarly as safe as DBS (or other current procedure and will provide  several years of 
benefit through reduction of contralateral motor symptoms and potential medication side 
effects in ET, while still permitting subsequent treatment with DBS should that become 
clinically desirable [56].   
1.[ADDRESS_457966] midline shift of the brain [57]. In adults, 
blood velocity in the basal arteries may be monitored through the intact temporal bone 
using the Doppl er effect [58]. In fact, since the 1950's, the ability of focused ultrasound 
to produce focal thermal lesions deep in the brain has been shown in several studies. 
Animal studies and early clinical studies provided encouraging results, showing well -
defined tissue coagulation at the focal zone [59-62]. Fry et al. showed that a low 
frequency (around 0.5 MHz) beam could be focused through the skull [63, 64] .  Their 
work produced thermal lesions in animal brains through a pi[INVESTIGATOR_366341] (bone temperature was not monitored).   
However, ultrasound is strongly attenuated by [CONTACT_4210] [65].  For this reason, a consensus 
was reached that therapeutic ultrasound cannot be delivered through an intact skull due to 
the deflecting effect of the bone; the variable thickness of the skull affects the wave 
propagation so much that the focal spot is lo st [66].  
➢ high temperatures that are generated in the bone, due to energy absorption, could 
damage the scalp, bone and adjacent brain tissue.

Version date: August [ADDRESS_457967] involved 
removal of the skull (i.e. craniotomy) for the sonication pathway [60, 67]  resulting in an 
invasive procedure with additional risk and costs.  
The device used in this study, namely the ExAblate transcranial system (see below), 
addresses the above limitations by [CONTACT_366386] a large phased array, active water -cooling, 
acoustic aberration correction algorithm, and patient specific CT data of the skull 
thickness registration.  
Large Phased Array Transducer.  The system utilizes a large phased array 
transducer that utilizes n umerous transducer elements (current system has 1000 
elements).  InSightec numerous clinical studies has indeed shown that large 
hemispherical phased arrays can deliver adequate energy through human skulls to 
coagulate brain tissue in vivo without excessiv e temperature elevation on the skull 
surface [68, 69]  (see Sections [IP_ADDRESS]  for clinical experience with ExAblate 
transcranial system) . 
Active water -cooling . The interface between th e subject head and the transducer 
is filled with degassed water, which provides the acoustic coupling path. The 
system includes a chiller (refrigerating unit with degassing capabilities) that keeps 
the degassed water chilled at constant temperature so that  the skull -bone 
temperature remains within safety limits.  
Acoustic aberration correction algorithm.  Acoustic aberration is created mostly 
by [CONTACT_366387]. The degree of compensation 
necessary for each transducer elemen t is based on predicting the aberration along 
the acoustic path from that element to the target and calculating the relative phase 
and amplitude correction necessary for that element. The result of this 
compensation is that the acoustic energy contribution  from each element will 
arrive at the focal point in phase.  
CT data analysis.  The phase/amplitude correction algorithm, based on ray 
acoustics methods, relies on an input that provides the bone density profile along 
a ray cast between each acoustic elemen t and the target point. This information is 
extracted from a three dimensional CT image of the skull [45].  This is done for 
each patient eligible for ExAblate treatment.  
InSightec has now conducted severa l clinical studies with the ExAblate Transcranial 
system both in the [LOCATION_002] under Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) FDA 
approvals, and outside the United Sates under all applica ble regulatory approvals.  To 
date, the clinical data shows a ver y favorable safety and effectiveness profiles of the 
ExAblate transcranial MRgFUS thalamotomy procedure as well as the initial safety and 
effectiveness in terms of ability to ablate a targeted brain tissue (see  Section -[IP_ADDRESS] ). 
1.3.1 ExAblate Transcranial MRgFUS System.  
The ExAblate transcranial system combines a focused ultrasound surgery [70] delivery 
system and a conventional diagnostic 3T MRI scanner. This ExAblate transcranial system 
provides real -time therapy planning algorithm, thermal dosimetry, and closed -loop 
InSightec  
 
InSightec Confidential  Page 10 of 86 
Version date: August 14 2014   therapy control. The latter is achieved by [CONTACT_366388].  
The treatment p rocess concept of this ExAblate transcranial system is not different from 
the ExAblate body system which is currently in clinical use for some soft tissue 
applications (see Section 1.4).  The treatment begins with a series of standard diagnostic 
MR images to identify the location and shape of tumor/target to be treated. The ExAblate 
computer uses the physician's designation of the target volume to plan the best way to 
cover the target volume with small spots called "sonications." These treatment spots are 
cylinder shaped.  Their size depends on sonication power and duration.  During the 
treatment, a specific MR scan, which can be processed to identify changes in tissue 
temperature, provides a thermal map of the treatment volume to confirm the therapeutic 
effect [71]. The thermal map is used to monitor the treatment in progress, and confirm 
that the ablation is proceeding according to plan, thus closing the therapy loop.  
The ExAblate transcranial operates a helmet -shaped transducer (currently utilizing 1000 -
element  phased array transducer) positioned above the subject head. The ExAblate 
transcranial system also includes means to immobilize the subject head, cool the interface 
water, and software for CT analysis and phase correction computation.  
1.3.2 Rationale for ExAblat e Transcranial MRgFUS Thalamotomy for the 
Treatment of the Essential Tremor  
Both stereotactic radiofrequency (RF) lesions and deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeted 
to the Vim have proven effective for the treatment of ET and other tremors [27].  
Ablation and stimulation have demonstrated equivalent dramatic improvements of 
tremors, with prospective and retrospective comparisons reporting 69 -90% improvement 
in appendicular tremors [28, 29] .  Stereotactic  radiosurgery using the gamma knife (GK) 
is a third technique directed to the Vim thalamus to control tremor.  The GK 
thalamotomy does not require an incision or bur hole, and has been reported to have 
efficacy equal to other lesion methods.  Unlike the fi rst two stereotactic techniques, the 
effects of the GK thalamotomy operation may require 6 months or more to develop.   
Niranjan et al. [72] compared results of 15 gamma knife thalamotomies, 13 RF 
thalamotomies, and 11 thalamic  DBS implants.  They reported all three to be safe and 
effective, with each approach having advantages and disadvantages.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Risks associated with the current standard of practice in stereotactic surgery.   
Hemorrhagic surgical complications  
Stereotaxy uses  modern, computer -assisted, volumetric imaging techniques to identify 
targets deep in brain in order to advance an electrode to the target.  Both of these 
stereotactic procedures require a scalp incision, bur hole drilled through the skull, and 
then penetr ation of the brain with an electrode to reach the target location.  In any open 
stereotactic procedure, there is a risk of hemorrhage associated with insertion of the 
electrode.  The overall risk of hemorrhagic complications is about 2% per electrode 
inser tion, with a risk of permanent neurologic deficit of about 1%.  Intraventricular 
hemorrhages occur in 5% of cases when the electrode traverses the lateral ventricular 
InSightec  
 
InSightec Confidential  Page 11 of 86 
Version date: August 14 2014   system.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_94954] a stereotactic procedure, the majority of surgical complications ar e 
associated with traversal of overlying structures such as the cortex or cerebral ventricles 
[73].   
Placement error  
Target identification in stereotaxy is derived from preoperative CT or MR scans taken 
with the patient in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547] [74].  The stereotactic surgery is often performed 
with the patient in a semi -recumbent position to minimize the loss of cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872].  
Problems can arise under some circumstances [75] such that the brain moves relative to 
the preoperative scan and the calculated coordinates.  This represents a potential source 
of error in electrode placement.  Any deviation in the mechanic al geometry of the 
electrode or the stereotactic apparatus will also contribute error which can have a 
considerable impact on the safet y/efficacy of the treatment.   
Risk from RF ablation  
The electrode used for RF ablations has an RF heated tip.  The peak temperature and the 
time it is maintained define the ultimate size of the lesion.  Temperature drops off 
smoothly with distance from the heated tip, and there is a fairly wide zone of thermal 
injury that extends for several mm around the necrotic core of t he lesion.  The damaged 
tissue will rapi[INVESTIGATOR_366342].  The risk of 
perioperative hemorrhage after RF ablation is higher than after DBS implant [76].  This 
may be the result of damage to blood vessels within the perimeter of the lesion, in areas 
hot enough to damag e the vessel but not hot enough to coagulate it.  Mechanical strains 
on the damaged vessel can develop as the necrotic tissue contracts and injured tissue 
swells, leading to a rupture and intracranial hemorrhage.  The ability to produce very 
sharp temperat ure gradients at the margins of the planned lesion would provide a more 
homogenous lesion and reduce the extent of potentially dangerous adjacent edematous 
regions.  
Risk from DBS  
DBS therapy has a lower risk of acute perioperative complications than does R F ablation 
[76].  It is also programmable and able to a dapt to some degree to the typi[INVESTIGATOR_366343].  However, DBS requires the permanent implantation of at least one multi -contact 
[CONTACT_335044], a lead extension and an implanted pulse generator (IPG).  The DBS system will 
likely be in place for the life o f the patient.  This means the patient will need to be seen in 
follow -up for device management several times per year, and undergo replacement of the 
IPG every 3 to 5 years.  Furthermore, DBS devices produce electromagnetic interference 
and are sensitive t o high energy electrical fields which can switch them off or even cause 
a "factory reset" of the device.   
As an implantable device, the DBS hardware problems are not uncommon.  Some reports 
suggest that upwards of 10% of DBS patients experience some form of hardware failure, 
and this number is likely to rise as the existing implants age.  Hardware failures can lead 
to a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_181942], unexpected (and possibly dangerous) loss of efficacy and invariably 
require surgical intervention to replace one or more comp onents.  Subjects receiving DBS 
InSightec  
 
InSightec Confidential  Page 12 of 86 
Version date: August [ADDRESS_457968] to the same safety events and 
complications that are typi[INVESTIGATOR_366344], dysarthria, and balance [77].   
Implanted DBS hardware is associated with higher risks of infection and skin 
complications than lesioning procedures.  The rate of postoperative infection with DBS 
surgery has been estimated between 3 -10%, and such infections typi[INVESTIGATOR_366345].  Such a scenario leaves the 
patient without treatment.  Wound dehiscence can also occur over the implanted 
hardware leading to infection as well.  
Even though the DBS technology continues to gain acceptability, its technology remains 
very expensive.  A bilateral Vim implant will incur an institutional cost nearing $100,000 
for hardware and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Additionally, expensive pulse generator replacements 
are required every three to five years.    
An intervention to inactivate the Vim thalamus without requiring the use of implanted 
hardware would be much more economical and would avoid the considerable risks 
associated with chronic implants.  ExAblate TcMRgFUS  lesioning can be repeated 
should sym ptoms progress or recur.  There is no reason why DBS could not be 
implemented should ExAblate lesioning be ineffective.   
Risk from gamma knife thalamotomy  
The GK uses ionizing radiation to denature cellular DNA and ultimately cause cell death 
within the a rea defined by [CONTACT_941] 50% isodose margins around the target.  It requires a long 
time (median several months) [72, 78, 79] , for the lesion to develop.  This means that the 
procedure is performed without intraoperative testing to verify the target and confir m the 
absence of side effects.  In fact, it has been reported that the lesions eventually observed 
on MR after 3 months are variable in volume and distribution, although the clinical 
effects seem consistent [79].   
Because of a lack of intraoperative feedback and a small risk of radiation -induced 
neoplasia, GK thalamotomy remains very uncommon, restricted to patients with 
advanced age or medical conditions (e.g. a nticoagulant therapy) perceived to be high risk 
for open stereotactic surgery such as DBS or RF lesioning.  Because "delayed 
complications have been reported, and clinical improvement may take weeks to months 
to occur," the American Academy of Neurology co ncluded in 2005 that "There is 
insufficient evidence to make recommendations regarding the use of gamma knife

phase tuning with ExAblate , precise and small (2x2x3mm) lesions have been produced in 
thalamus while real -time thermal monitoring is available to observe the heating caused 
with each sonication [5].  Standard MR sequences have been shown to reliably predict 
the precise locus of tissue damage during thermal lesioning with the ExAblate system [5, 
46]. The precision of the ExAblate technology has already been demonstrated in animal 
models [47] and in clinical trials for neuropathic pain syndromes [49], in treatment of 
essential tremor (IDE # G100169), and is currently being investigated in humans with 
brain  tumors (IDE # G020182)  as well as in humans with medication -refractory tremor 
dominant idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (IDE # G120017) .    
[IP_ADDRESS]  Potential advantages of ExAblate TcMRgFUS Vim thalamotomy as a 
treatment for Essential tremor.  
As a non -invasive, non -ionized MR guided procedure with real time imaging and thermal 
feedback, ExAblate TcMRgFUS VIM thalamotomy has several advantages for the 
treatment of Essential tremor:  
➢ The treatment can be monitored in real -time with MRI and MR -thermography 
[56-62].  Th is allows for immediate confirmation of the targeting process.   
➢ Thermal lesioning can be performed discreetly and accurately, and can be 
evaluated immediately.   
➢ Unlike stereotactic radiosurgery, ExAblate TcMRgFUS does not use ionizing 
radiation and does not carry a risk of radiation -induced tumorigenesis.   
➢ Because th e ExAblate TcMRgFUS procedure is non -invasive, there is no 
scalp incision, no bur hole, and no electrode penetrating the brain.  The risk of 
hemorrhagic complication should be reduced, and this noninvasive procedure 
should eliminate the risk of infectious complications.    
➢ Unlike DBS treatment, there is no implanted hardware, no concern of 
interference with external sources of electromagnetic noise, no need for 
extensive follow -up for programming, and no need for periodic battery 
replacement.  This represen ts a much simpler treatment plan for a patient 
suffering from ET.  There will be hours of clinic time that is saved from DBS 
device management and replacement.  Additionally, health care costs will be 
greatly reduced.   
➢ As with other surgical treatments, i t will be possible to re -treat a patient who 
develops a recurrence of tremor if the disease progresses.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Potential risks of ExAblate TcMRgFUS  Vim thalamotomy.  
The full risks of the ExAblate TcMRgFUS thalamotomy in the treatment of Essential

Version date: August [ADDRESS_457970] also been identified and implemented ( see Attachment – B3 
of this submission ) in similar fashion as in the feasibility study (IDE # G100169) .   Here 
are two (2) potential risks, which are unique to the ExAblate system:   
A- Mis-registration of the CT skull model with the MR volume.   
If the CT and MR volumes are not well aligned the tuning of the ultrasonic 
elements will be suboptimal and distortion will make it difficult to achieve a crisp 
volume of heating   
Risk Mitigation - The software protocols for image fusion are well -establish ed and 
will be visually confirmed by [CONTACT_366390].  
Observation of the location, size and pattern of areas heated by [CONTACT_64247] -power 
sonication trials will provide direct confirmation of the accuracy of the ExAblate 
TcMRgF US focus.   MR thermography allows for confirmation of accuracy 
before the process of therapeutic sonications begins.  
B- Skull heating may be sufficient to damage the bone and/or adjacent soft 
tissues.   
Risk Mitigation - The sonication times are calculated  to keep skull temperatures 
below dangerous levels, and the minimum ten minutes allotted for skull cooling 
will provide time for the skull to return to normal temperature before any 
additional heating can take place.  The small target of Vim thalamus will not 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_366346], so 
cumulative effects will be minimized.  Additionally, the patient will be awake, 
alert, and in constant communication with the investigators; so that any clinically 
significan t heating of the scalp or skull can be immediately reported and the 
procedure suspended.  
The safety profile of the ET001 feasibility study that was conducted under the FDA IDE 
# G100169 for the ExAblate TcMRgFUS treatment of subjects with medication 
refra ctory essential tremor was very favorable  (see Attachment -B2 of this submission ) . 
Summary  
Based on published animal and human studies, InSightec animal study, as well as the 
various clinical studies performed with the ExAblate system, the ExAblate TcMRgFU S 
Vim thalamotomy safety and effectiveness are very favorable, and compare favorably to 
other surgical treatments within the currently accepted standard of care including RF 
lesioning and DBS.  A single ExAblate lesion targeted to the VIM nucleus should 
provide reduction of contralateral tremor symptoms in ET (as demonstrated during the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (IDE # G100169), while still permitting subsequent treatment should that 
becomes clinically desirable.  The ExAblate technology has several potential advantages 
over current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_334997] a 
InSightec  
 
InSightec Confidential  Page 15 of 86 
Version date: August 14 2014   precise manner with continuous clinical and radiographic monitoring.  If the potential of 
the ExAblate TcMRgFUS thalamotomy can be realized, it may supplant other 
thalamotomy procedures (such as GK thalamotomy and RF thalamotomy), providing a 
viable alternative procedure for patients unable or unwilling to undergo an invasive and 
uncomfortable DBS procedure while still cost effective.

[IP_ADDRESS]  ExAblate Body System for the treatment of Breast Cancer  
InSightec conducted FDA approved clinical trials under IDE # G990184 and G990201 to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of the ExAblate system in the treatment of breast 
carcinomas [81-83].  Both of these studies are no w closed.  Currently, InSightec has an 
FDA conditional approval for a new breast cancer phase -2 study (IDE # G060023).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  ExAblate Ablation of Breast Fibroadenoma  
InSightec conducted a feasibility FDA approved clinical trials under IDE # G930140 to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of the ExAblate system in the ablation of breast 
fibroadenoma [2].  Under this study, a total of 11 subjects were treated.  The results of 
this study showed that 8 of the 11 subjects  who had ablations were either partially 
(>50%) or completely (>90%) successful. No adverse effects were reported, except for 
one case of transient edema in the pectoralis muscle two days after therapy.

[IP_ADDRESS]  ExAblate Body System for the treatment of Prostate Studies – Investigation al 
Feasibility Studies  
Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the [LOCATION_002].  
Most prostate cancers grow slowly with a high survival rate past 10 years if it is still 
confined to the prostate.  The current treatment metho ds (surgical, external beam 
radiation therapy and male hormone suppression therapy) have significant side effects, 
such as impotence, incontinence, post -radiation colitis, etc.  Because prostate cancer is 
usually slow growing, active surveillance at 6 mont h intervals using a prostate cancer 
marker (PSA – prostate -specific antigen) has been a primary treatment option.  A focal 
treatment that could destroy the cancerous cells without harming the neurovascular 
bundle could provide a more palatable treatment wi th fewer side effects and extend life 
expectancy from prostate cancer causes.  
Feasibility studies have been performed outside the [LOCATION_002] to demonstrate the 
ability of the ExAblate to successfully target the prostate gland and ablate it (Total Gland 
Ablation – TGA).  Additionally studies are now underway using focal therapy to ablate 
only cancerous foci within the prostate and leave the remainder of the gland intact.  The 
difficulty here is in the methods available to identify the cancerous foci.  The se cancerous 
foci are generally not visible on MRI or CT, so careful, methodical biopsy mappi[INVESTIGATOR_366348] (minimum of 12 cores, commonly 16 cores for larger glands) must be

[IP_ADDRESS].1    Bone Feasibility Study IDE# G050177  
The objective of this trial was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of using ExAblate 
as a treatment for pain palliation in subjects with metastatic bone tumors.  This study was 
designed as a prospective, one arm, non -randomized study.  Ten subjects w ere enrolled at 
two sites.  Nine subjects completed the study; one subject could not complete treatment 
due to limited device accessibility to the lesion.   
Only 3 mild AEs were reported in the study with no device -related deaths, life -
threatening injuries  or permanent injuries, nor serious adverse events.  There were 2 
events of mild sonication -induced pain; both resolved the day that sonications ended.  In 
addition, there was 1 event of a mild shivering reaction to conscious sedation lasting only 
a few mi nutes during the procedure with subsequent resolution.  All of these events were 
anticipated side effects that were identified in the study protocol as possible treatment -
related complications.  
As noted above, effectiveness was measured by [CONTACT_366391] n relief (as measured by 
[CONTACT_8298]), decrease in analgesics/opi[INVESTIGATOR_335001], and improved quality of life (as 
measured by [CONTACT_67307] -36).  Prior to ExAblate treatment, the mean pain score was 5.6 ± 1.2 
(N=10, score range: 4 -7).  A very rapid and sustained relief  response was observed in 
subjects’ pain relief.  At 3 months, the mean score had dropped to 0.4 ± 0.6 (a 93% 
decrease from baseline).  With respect to medication usage, all subjects maintained or 
decreased their medication usage.   
Overall, these results demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of using ExAblate as a 
treatment for pain palliation in subjects with metastatic bone tumors.

option.  Consistent with prior correspondence between the company and FDA, InSightec 
has conducted an interim analysis of study data, providing for a statistical penalt y 
addressing the early look at the data, in order to initiate PMA approval for this indication.  
This interim analysis has been performed under the interim statistical analysis plan 
previously submitted to and approved by [CONTACT_8415] (G070022/S54).  The study obje ctive is to 
evaluate the safety and effectiveness of an ExAblate thermal ablation treatment as 
compared to a sham treatment (where no energy is delivered) to reduce/relieve the pain of 
metastatic or multiple Myeloma bone tumors in subjects who are not suit able candidates 
for radiation therapy. The submission is under review at the Agency (PMA # P110039).  
1.4.2 ExAblate Transcranial System  
InSightec has two ExAblate Transcranial systems: mid (650 KHz) and low frequency (200 
KHz).  These 2 systems (medium and low range frequency) have two different 
characteristics:  
1. Mid frequency: functional discrete lesioning for deep central locations; focal 
thermal lesions  
2. Low frequency: tumor ablation and has wide treatment envelope  
These differences are summarized in the foll owing table:

Standard sonication delivers the required energy in a continuous fashion to the target  
Burst Sonication: delivers the energy in a series of burst (high amplitude short duration

is the way it is deliv ered to the target . 
 
For the proposed study, the same mid -frequency ExAblate  Transcranial system that was 
investigated for the treatment of Essential Tremor subjects (under IDE # G100169) will 
be used; it should be noted this same system is utilized for the FDA approved study for 
tremor in Parkinson’s disease subjects.  The system  uses the same transducer, ALL 
clinical features and tools of this FDA ET IDE approved system version, subject interface 
and coupling, etc.  There is no change to the thermal modeling, energy delivery, beam 
forming, nor treatment parameters and guidelines,  and mitigating steps.  Furthermore, the 
manufacturing process, device risk analysis, SW and HW verification and validation have 
also remained unchanged.

In 2002, the FDA approved an IDE for a feasibility clinical study for the ExAblate 
Transcranial system in the treatment of brain tumors [48]. The purpose of this study is to 
evaluate the safety of MRI -guided focused ultrasound thermal ablation of brain tumors 
performed through intact human skull using the ExAblate  system.  Specifically, the 
objectives of this non -randomized study are:  
a) To evaluate the safety of FUS delivered through intact human skull to the brain, 
during the treatment, and during the follow -up period of 3 months.  
b) To evaluate the effect of thermal a blation in the target tumor with contrast MR 
imaging to identify viable tumor, and non -viable thermally ablated tissue

Utilizing the burst sonication regime, the designated tumor was completely ablated.  This 
was consistent with our overall plan to achieve the efficacy needed.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_366352], this tumor subject died of an intracerebral 
hemorrhage five days after ExAblate. The Study Safety Committee determined the cause 
of the hemorrhage to be unknown but possibly multi -factorial. It was related to the 
propensity of glioblastoma s to bleed, exacerbated by [CONTACT_114658], medications and an 
underlying coagulopathy.  The latter was suggested by [CONTACT_366392] a hemorrhage at the biopsy site long before ExAblate, skin bruising, and a peri -
orbital hematoma tha t worsened dramatically at the time of his demise.  
The neuropathologic findings raised the possibility that pre -existing changes in the 
vessels, such as mineralization and wall thickening, may have rendered those vessels 
more susceptible to damage by [CONTACT_366393].  The Study 
Safety Committee recommended protocol changes in the exclusion criteria (tumors with a 
known tendency to bleed, subjects with abnormal clotting studies or on drugs known to 
affect coagulation) and in clari fication of the imaging criteria (target volume maximum 
size requirement < 2.5 cm diameter, or an 8 cc volume - the tumor volume may be larger, 
as long as true midline shift is < [ADDRESS_457975] is not clinically compromised; 
definition of midline shi ft > 5 mm – does not include tumor growth across midline).  
With these provisos, the Safety Committee recommended continuation of the study.  The

[IP_ADDRESS].2.1  Study for Neurop athic Pain Outside the [LOCATION_002]   
The original study was an investigator initiated and sponsored study (Study number 
BZ001) in the treatment of neuropathic pain that was conducted at the University 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_274930] (Zurich Switzerland) using the InSigh tec ExAblate Transcranial (650 
KHz) system.  The study was approved by [CONTACT_366394].  At the conclusion of this 
study, an InSightec sponsored study was conducted  under Swissmedic (Reference # : 
2011 -MD-0001)  and local IRB approvals.  This study (NP001) included subjects with 
Neuropathic pain, Essential tremor, and those subjects with Parkinson’s disease induced 
tremor.   
To date, more than thirty -five (35) subjects  underwent selective central lateral 
thalamotomy (CLT) using the ExAblate Transcranial treatment. For all subjects, the 
treatment was well tolerated and did not result in any side effects or neurological deficits.  
The safety profile of these procedures wa s no different from those known to occur in any 
thalamotomy procedure such as DBS or RF ablation.  To be specific, all the reported 
adverse events observed in these studies were all non -significant and anticipated events 
already identified as potential eve nts in the study protocol.  These were headaches, 
nausea, and vomiting.  All resolved on the same day as treatment.  The only significant 
event reported to date from these two (2) studies an event of neurological deficit (Subject 
BZ001 -12), i.e. “dysmetria  (dyscoordination) of the right hand, dysarthria, motor neglect 
and gait disorder” .  This event , originally reported as part of IDE # G100169 , was 
reported immediately following the last sonication.  All symptoms improved significantly 
1-hour post treatmen t.  By 24 hours, 70 -80% of the motor symptoms had abated and with 
time all dysmetric symptoms cleared except when the subject tried to write or speak (see 
Jeanmonod et al paper2).   
As it was shown in the brain tumor study under IDE G020281, for these studies there was 
no clinically significant heating at the skull -brain interface.  The mean brain surface 
temperature was approximately 39° C.   
Other than a couple of subjects, all Neur opathic pain treated subjects (N=19) experienced 
some level of pain relief during the procedure, and at 48 hours after the treatment, 
subjects reported pain relief ranging from 32 to 100% (mean ≈ 65%).  Partial results of 
this study were published in the Annals of Neurology Journal  3

of Events  Incidenta l 
Events  Sinusitus  [ADDRESS_457978], 76 % (62/82) 
were Mild events, and the remainder 24% (20/82) were Moderate.  Most of these events 
resolved either the same day (49% of the total events) or within 2 weeks of treatme nt (26% 
of the total events).  Hence, 61 events (i.e. 74%) resolved within [ADDRESS_457979] procedure, 14 out of 82 
events (17%) resolved in more than 2 weeks (not counting the i ncidental sinusitis (n=1)), 
and 7 events (9%) were reported as ongoing.   
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Overall summary of ExAblate TcMRgFUS safety profile  
The safety events reported in all these studies present a favorable safety profile for brain 
surgery using the ExAblate TcMRgFUS f or ablative therapy.  The majority of all events 
are mild and transient.  They generally fall into the pattern of other techniques indicating 
that these are generally the result of stereotactic device use (e.g., headache) and 
thalamotomy in general, regard less of the mechanism of therapy, due to brain tissue insult 
or due to heating of tissue locally surrounding the lesion target.  The overall effectiveness 
profile was also shown to be very favorable.

Version date: August 14 2014   2 OBJECTIVES  
The objective of this prospective, random ized, double -blind (to subjects , local site and  
Tremor Core Lab assessor s), crossover, multi -site, two -arm study  (ExAblate treated arm 
Vs ExAblate Sham treated control arm) is to test the efficacy of treatment using the 
ExAblate Transcranial System and to further demonstrate safety in medication -refractory 
tremor in  subjects with essential tremor (ET).   
Safety : To evaluate the incidence and severity of adverse events (AE/AEs) 
associated with ExAblate Transcranial MRgFUS treatment of medication -
refractory ET 
Effectiveness : To determine the effectiveness of the ExAblate Transcranial 
MRgFUS treatment of medication -refractory tremor  (i.e. ET).  Efficacy will be 
determined utilizing the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST) in ET  from 
examinations at baseline and 3-Months post -ExAblate treatment.   
• This study is designed as a p rospective, randomized, double -blind (to subjects 
and Tr emor Core Lab assessor), crossover, multi -site, two -arm study (ExAblate 
treated arm Vs ExAblate Sham treated control arm) . 
Assessments  of primary efficacy endpoints  will compare the three months after ExAblate 
treatment to Baseline measurements for clinical symptom relief .  Safety of  ExAblate  in 
the treatment of ET  will be collected for one year after ExAblate Sham  or active 
treatment.   Relative Safety will be evaluated using a common description of Significant 
Clinical C omplications for patients treated in this study. This study will be performed on 
the 3T MR scanners.  
Note:  
It should be noted that the pre -market submission to the FDA will be performed 
following the completion of the [ADDRESS_457980].  This pre -market submission will be performed in full consultation with 
and approval of the FDA.   However, per FDA order , all participating subjects 
will be consented for a total of 5 years .  
2.1 Primary Endpoints  
2.1.1 Safety  
Safety of ExAblate will be determined by [CONTACT_147718] / treatment related complications from the first treatment day 
visit through ALL study follow ups.  Adverse events (type, frequency, severity) are 
expected to be similar t o those of previous studies using ExAblate TcMRgFUS for 
Thalamotomy  
InSightec  
 
InSightec Confidential  Page 26 of 86 
Version date: August 14 2014   All AEs will be reported and categorized by [CONTACT_147719], probably, possibly, 
or unrelated to the device  or procedure  and categorized by [CONTACT_1570] / treatment 
arm.  
2.1.2 Effectiveness    
Primary effectiveness will be evaluated using a validated, tremor rating scale: the Clinical 
Rating Scale for Tremors (CRST) for ET subjects, based upon subjects in whom 
unilateral ExAblate lesioning is attempted (i.e., Intent -to-Treat analys is).  The specific 
study hypothesis is as follows:   
At 3-months post -treatment, the treated (contralateral) upper limb  CRST 
subscore  (CRST Part -A & B  applicable to upper limb ) in the ExAblate -treated 
group will be statistically  lower compared to  that in  the ExAblate sham -
treated control group.  
Clinical assessments will be made at the following time points:  screening, baseline  with 
subjects on confirmed stable medication  (at 1-months post screening) , and post -treatment 
at 1 week , 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months .   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Efficacy Assessments  
Tremor will be assessed for each treated ET patient using the CRST  [85] at baseline 
following the medications observation period  (i.e.: subjects on confirmed stable 
medication)  but before treatment and at post -treatment interva ls: [ADDRESS_457981] (e.g.: neurosurgeon, or neurologist or physical therapy 
specialist  in movement disorder).  The primary measure utilized in this protocol will be a 
reduction in the treated ( contralateral ) upper extremity  CRST  applicable subscore s.  
Additionally, a tota l/overall tremor score (out of  160 points) will be obtained for each ET 
patient at each time interval by  [CONTACT_366395].    
Quality of life will be evaluated using the QUEST assessment.  The QUEST is an ET 
specific assessment of quality of life changes associated with ET.  Tröster et al., 2005, 
developed QUEST as a clinical tool for correlat ing changes in [ADDRESS_457982] of ET on the patients’ quality of life.  
2.2 Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints of the study are as follows:  
1. Quality life claims: Questionnaire for Essential Tremor (QUEST) outcome  (upper 
extremity quest ions)  at Months  3 change from Baseline. as compared between

patients suffering from medication -refractory ET, using the ExAblat e transcranial system  
compared to a sham control.  
➢ For ET Patients: a unilateral  thermal lesion will be created in the ventralis 
intermedius  nucleus of the thalamus [54] 
2.3.1 The Hypotheses Tested  
➢ At 3-months post -treatment, the treated (contralateral) upper limb CRST  
applicable  subscore s of Part -A & B  in the ExAblate -treated group will be 
statistically lower compared to the ExAblate sham -treated limb in the sham -
treated group.

4 INVESTIGATION PLAN  
4.1 Study Design  Points  
4.1.1  Computer Algorithm for Randomization  
Randomization will be accomplished  using a central computerized system  (see also 
Section 5.5 below)  with secure access from the study sites.  The investigator will be 
assigned a password to access th e randomization and the site will be trained to 
maintain the blind.  For example, InSightec currently uses randomization routines 
provided by [CONTACT_366402] (Internet Security and Accele ration).  These systems are maintained 
at InSightec’s main office in Haifa, Israel.   
It should be noted that:  
1 - The Core lab assessor and the participating sites will be blinded from each 
other ’s databases.   
➢ Tremor Core Lab A ssessor w ill review all videotaped assess ments 
Baseline through Month 12 and will remain blinded to treatment 
assignment at all visits.  They will be asked if they can guess 
treatment group assignment at each recording they score in order to 
assess maintenance of blinding.  
➢ Additi onally, the sites will have a designated individual qualified by 
[CONTACT_366403] 3 
(e.g., Site Blinded Assessor) .  They will be asked if they can guess 
InSightec  
 
InSightec Confidential  Page 32 of 86 
Version date: August 14 2014   treatment group assignment at each recording through Month 3 in 
order to assess maintenance of blinding.  
➢ Subjects and site personnel (with the exception of the treating 
physician) will not be exposed to subject treatment assignment until 
al the Month 3 assessments are completed.  At  Month 3 , all subjects 
will be unblinded.  At each visit through Month 3, subj ects will be 
asked if they can guess treatment group assignment in order to assess 
maintenance of blinding.  
2 - This randomization procedure and routines are similar  to those used for 
the PMA P110039 that is currently under review (ExAblate body system for  
the palliation of painful bone metastases ).

Version date: August 14 2014   4.1.4  Movement Disorders Central Lab Assessments  
For this study, the primary efficacy endpoint assessment from Baseline (i.e.  immediately 
post medication observation/stability) through the Month 12 follow up  visit will be 
performed by a central laboratory (Lab).  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_366357] a fully trained 
physician specializing in movement disorders. Core Lab will not be made aware of the 
study subject’s treatment assignment at any time during  the course of the study. The 
purpose of the Tremor Core Lab review is to provide a uniform scoring across  all sites . 
For this study, each subject’s tremor assessment  (CRST)  will be videotaped at Baseline as 
well as at each post treatment study visit so that they can be assessed by a blinded central 
Tremor Core L ab Assessor.  The videotapes/Memory cards (e.g.: SD Card) will be de -
identified and carefully labeled with the corr esponding subject study ID number and sent 
to InSightec to catalogue and forward to the core lab for scoring.  The primary endpoint 
(mean change from Baseline) at Month 3 will utilize the Central Lab Blinded Assessor’s 
scoring.    
4.1.[ADDRESS_457993] assessments will be videotaped at all visits  Baseline through Month 12; Routine 
Screening CRST video assessments may be obtained and used by [CONTACT_366404] a quality 
assurance check for videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_366358].  
Screening CRST assessments will not be used in determination of pi[INVESTIGATOR_366359] .  
The goal of the videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_366360] a uniform format to enable the Core Lab 
assessor to score all subjects utilizing the same filming proce dure.  This procedure is NOT 
meant to train assessors how to perform tremor assessment.  The CRST assessment  will be 
done by [CONTACT_366405].

scoring  utilizing the same sequences .  The videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_366363]  a suggested 
sequence grouped by [CONTACT_366406].  Additionally, the items are grouped by [CONTACT_366407].    
4.1.[ADDRESS_457994] (DSMB) will be used to review all AEs on the study. 
Their role is to evaluate all AE's tha t occur throughout the study and provide their 
assessment of the study safety profile as well as their recommendations for the study 
continuation .  The DSMB recommendations will be communicat ed to the FDA as part of 
the annual  reporting for this proposed I DE study.   
All adverse events will be assessed for their relationship to the study device or procedure.  
Standard Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) definitions for SAEs and UADEs will be 
used in assessment of adverse events  (see Section -6.5).

2. The diagnosis of ET will be confirmed by a neurosurgeon or neurologist 
specializing in movement disorders, where a comprehensive neurologic 
examination will be performed, including the screening CRST   
3. Medicatio n refractoriness will be defined when tremor persists despi[INVESTIGATOR_366364].  At least one of the 
medications trialed should be a first line agent, namely propranolol or primidone.  
The other medication tr ialed should be a class B agent as defined by [CONTACT_366408] 
(2005 and 2011 references).  Adequate trial ( daily ) dosages are noted below or 
occur if dose -limiting side effects occur:  
First line (class A) tremor therapy :  
• Primidone 250 mg  
• Propranolol 240 mg  
• Propranolol LA 240 mg  
Second line (class B) tremor therapy : 
• Gabapentin  
• Topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] 400 mg  
• Other Beta blockers: Atenolol or Sotalol  
Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_366365]: Alprazolam or Clonazepam  
CT Imaging : 
For the  purpose of this study, the CT e xam should be an Axial scan with  bone filter, an 
image resolution of 512x512, and image thickness of 1mm with zero (0) spacing .  This CT 
imaging will be utilized to compute the Skull Density ratio, and as part of the treatment 
planning should the subject qualifies for the study.  
During t his one month “medication observation” phase, the current regimen of 
medications will be maintained to ensure tremor stability.  Screening laboratory and 
imaging studies will be obtained to complete the enrollment process.    
4. A complete medical history wil l be obtained to determine subject’s general health 
status; including blood analyses (for PT, PTT, CBC, platelets, and creatinine), and 
pregnancy urine test for women of childbearing age.  Positive test will exclude 
subjects from study.   In the event the pregnancy test is negative, she will be asked 
to use an acceptable form of contraception throughout entire course of study.

Version date: August 14 2014   5. PHQ -9 depression will be obtained.  All subjects who score ≥ [ADDRESS_457996] will 
be excluded from the study.   
6. Medication  stability and baseline measurements:  
In this study, all subjects will be tested again at the one month time point (±7days) post 
screening date.  At this visit, the following will be performed:  
• Medication stability: subjects will be asked to report any changes in 
medication taken for tremor c onsumed over the preceding month.   
o If the subjects do not show stability on mediations at 30 days, a 
second stabilization period may be initiated.   
• All those subjects on antidepressants must be on the same antidepressant 
medication at the same dose for t he prior 3 months to be eligible.  
• Once the medication stability is confirmed, then all other baseline assessments  
will be performed;  
o CRST must be performed by a site blinded assessor  (SBA)  who is 
proficient in movement disorders.   The CRST  evaluation mus t be 
videotaped  for the Central Lab Assessment.  
o QUEST and imaging will also be performed  after medication 
stability has been demonstrated.   
 
7. If at this point it is determined that the subjects does not  meet all Inclusion and 
Exclusion criteria and cannot be treated, the subjects will be removed from the 
study.  These subjects will be considered screening failures, and will not be 
included in any of the safety or efficacy endpoint analyses.   
8. If the subj ect meets all the pre-imaging criteria, then the subjects will be 
scheduled for the MR .   
➢ MR Imaging :  For the purpose of this study, the following MR Exams will be 
performed.   
1. The pre -contrast MR Imaging should include the following:  
a) T2 Weighted imaging exam along these 2 axes: Axial and Sagittal  
8. A second physician specializing in movement disorders will review all the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and verify that the subject meets the study screening 
criteria prior to randomization.  
9. Subjects who have been verified as meeting all study criteria may  be scheduled 
for randomization to either the ExAblate Test Arm or ExAblate Sham Arm.  The

Version date: August 14 2014   4.2.1 Treatment Procedures  
WARNING:  
In this study, subject participation is necessary during the course of the 
ablation procedures.  USE OF SEDATIVE MEDICATION MAY IMPAIR 
COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS OF THE SUBJECT.  
However, to alleviate subject anxiety that can develop during a lengthy 
procedure inside the MR scanner, low dose sedatives like benzodiazepi [INVESTIGATOR_366367].  Subjects MUST always remain 
responsive  to physician instructions.  
Any subject who is not appropriately responsive will not be allowed to 
continue on with any further treatment procedures until it is deemed 
clinically safe by [CONTACT_77310].  Sedation reversal with flumazenil or 
equivalent may be utilized if excessive sedation occurs.  If a subject cannot 
participate in the treatment after receiving sedation, the procedure will be 
aborted , and the subject will be considered as screen failure       
The following procedure steps would be common  to all subjects.  Hence, the overall 
treatment procedure steps will be performed as follows:  
Subjects will present to the ExAblate TcMRgFUS treatment center on the morning 
of surgery “ off” medication.   
1. An IV line of saline will be positioned for the delivery of fluids and any 
medications required during the procedure. Some of the subjects may require a 
urinary catheter to keep the bladder empty during treatment.  Noninvasive 
monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure, systemic oxygen saturation, 
electro cardiogram, and end -tidal CO [ADDRESS_457997] ’s overall well being.  Their maj or role is to 
monitor and control of blood pressure to prevent hypertension during the 
procedure.  Subjects must be able to communicate during the entire 
procedure, and must be able to operate the stop sonication button.  
o To address emergency situations sho uld they occur, a standard ventilator 
should  be available in close proximity to the MR scanning room; per local 
site clinical standards.   
2. The subject’s head will be carefully shaved and examined for pre -existing scalp  
scars or any other scalp lesions.  
3. Graduated compression stockings will be worn to prevent deep venous thrombosis 
in the lower limbs.

TcMRgFUS treatment.  
5. Subject will be positioned supi[INVESTIGATOR_335013]/ExAblate therapy table.   
6. The half -spherical helmet containing the elements of  ExAblate transducer will be 
positioned around the subject's head in the treatment position.  This should be 
done according to measurements taken from the pre -operative/imaging session(s).  
7. An elastic membrane  will be attached to the Subject's head and to the transducer 
to create the acoustic coupling system between the ultrasound transd ucer and the 
scalp.  
8. The immobilization system will be secured over the subject head to maintain a 
constant relationship between the target and the transducer.  
9. A baseline assessment of symptoms of tremor will be obtained before the ablation 
procedure begin s 
10. The interface between the scalp and the transducer (within the elastic membrane)  
will then be filled with degassed water.  This volume will be completely filled 
with care to avoid air bubbles between the face of the transducer and the scalp. 
Through act ive circulation and cooling system, the water will be maintained 
chilled throughout the procedure to avoid undesired heating of the scalp and skull.  
11. A 3D localizer MR scan will be obtained to allow further refinement of the 
position of the ExAblate  transdu cer focal point with respect to the targeted zone.  
12. A series of MR images will be acquired to identify the target area, and plan the 
actual treatment   
o T2 Weighted imaging exam along at  least 2 axes: Axial and Sagittal  
13. The pre -therapy MRI and CT image dat asets will be registered to the T2 weighted 
MR images that were just acquired. This image fusion of pre -operative MR assists 
in the accurate delineation of the target area and determination of a safe 
sonication pathway  
o The fusion of the CT data is required  for the computation of phase 
correction values to correct for skull aberration, and identification of 
intracranial calcifications  
o Scars of the scalp will be designated to ensure the ultrasound beam avoids 
these specific areas  
14. The treatment volume and pla n will be defined by [CONTACT_335061] . The 
ExAblate TcMRgFUS system will automatically compute the number of 
sonications, and the (per sonication spot) phase and amplitude corrections 
necessary for the system to produce a focal spot at each of the desired locations.

[IP_ADDRESS]  ExAblate Arm Treatment Procedures  
The following will be performed  for all ExAblate Arm randomized subjects:  
1. A central point in the targeted area will be targeted with a low dose, sub -lethal 
energy level sonication to confirm the targeting accuracy on the MR images.  
Focal point position and/or transducer location will be adjusted as necessary.  
WARNING:  
The subject MUST be examined by  [CONTACT_366409].  
2. To enhance the procedure safety and mitigate some of the inherent risks of thermal 
lesioning of brain tissue:  
a) The ExAblate Transcranial Thalamoto my will be performed as a series of 
sonications with increments in power within the designated target volume in 
the awake subject.  
b) The subject will be examined by [CONTACT_366410] & after each 
sonication for neurologic signs and symptoms, and ev idence of tremor 
suppression.  The subject assessor and subject are in direct communication 
with the neurosurgeon and treatment team at all times from within the MR 
suite.  
c) The series of sonications will start with low energy prior to permanent 
thermal abla tion.  This is to ensure the planned sonication to be centered on 
the Vim nucleus of the Thalamus.  Low energy sonication will non -
destructively warm the target.  The warming will be captured by [CONTACT_366411] d in real time to the 
treating physician.  The neurosurgeon will then verify that the warming is 
centered on the prescribed anatomic target.  This will allow the centering of 
the eventual permanent thermal lesion in the planned location.  
 
d) The titration of escalating focal sonications will continue up to full ablation 
of the targeted planned area for ablation.  This would be performed by 
[CONTACT_366412].   
 
For this study, ONLY a u nilateral lesioning/ablation will be performed using the 
ExAblate TcMRgFUS system in the absence of clinical side effect.

[IP_ADDRESS]  ExAblate Sham Arm Treatment Procedures  
The followin g will be performed for all ExAblate Sham  Arm randomized subjects:  
To perform the  sham treatment, the sonication will be performed with energy output 
disabled.   
For ethical reasons, the sham procedure should not exceed 45 -min of sonication time 
and table time of no more than 1h 30min.  However, when possible the treating 
physician may  determine a sonication (treatment) time for sham subject s to be similar 
to that which is occurring in the ExAblate Test A rm to maintain consistency between 
treatment arms.   It should be noted that a ll treatment times of both treatment arms will 
be capture d in the study CRF.  
WARNING:  
The ExAblate Sham subject MUST be examined by [CONTACT_366413] a n 
ExAblate Test Arm subject.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Patient Management during Treatment  
 The following treatment procedure instructions are  applicable to all subjects  in both 
treatment groups : 
• The ExAblate TcMRgFUS system is equipped with Stop Sonication Buttons:  
one for the subject to utilize, one for the nurse/anesthesiologist (subject 
moni tor), and one for the treating physician to use.  Hence, in the event of 
discomfort or pain, the subject will have the ability to abort the sonication at 
any time by [CONTACT_335066].  Once this button is 
activated, the system will ins tantly stop the energy delivery.  The same thing 
will happen in the event that the treating physician or the subject monitor 
activate s their button.  After addressing the subject concerns or discomfort, the 
procedure may continue without further delay.  Al l adverse events that may be 
caused by [CONTACT_366414](s) of the Stop Sonication Button will be 
captured on the CRFs.  
• After the treatment, a series of MR images will be acquired to assess the 
treatment effects:   
a. T2 Weighted sequences to assess  for peri -lesional edema, while the 
patient is still in treatment position  
Note: In the event new neurological deficits or seizures are observed, other 
imaging modalities (including CT) should be performed immediately per 
standard of care of local site for  similar events.  These are in addition to 
neurological and physical examinations.

InSightec Confidential  Page 40 of 86 
Version date: August 14 2014   • Once the treatment is complete or otherwise terminated:  
a. Remove the subject from the ExAblate table and remove all 
monitoring equipment, elastic membrane , and stereotactic fr ame.  
b. Document neurological and physical examinations.  
• Following treatment subjects will complete a blinding form asking if they 
believe they received the test treatment or the sham treatment.  This will be 
used to evaluate the effectiveness of maintaining the blind.   
• Subject should be imaged again using the MR head Coil on the regular 
imaging scanner table.  This is to provide clinical quality imaging for analyses 
and comparison to baseline imaging:  
o T2 weighted sequence along the main axis.   
To make this additional imaging session more confortable  to the subject, 
this may be performed within 24h of the completion of the treatment.  
• The subject will be transferred to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_366368] a 
timely fashion immediately following their acquisition and properly 
anonymized from all subject identifiers.

5.2 Efficacy  
Primary effecti veness will be evaluated using validated scores ; the Clinical Rating Scale 
for Tremors (CRST) for the ET patients, based upon patients where unilateral ExAblate 
thalamotomy was attempted (i.e., Intent -to-Treat analysis) .   Efficacy is defined as a 
reduction in contralateral tremor of ET at 3-months post -treatment.    
5.[ADDRESS_458010] Health Status  
The results from the physical and neurological exams will be recorded in the CRFs and 
will be analyzed.  
5.4 Statistical Considerations an d Sample Size  
The study will include a total of a minimum of 72 and a maximum of 80  randomized 
subjects in a 3 :1 (treated: sham control ) ratio at up to 8  sites. This sample size provides a 
20% increase due to potential subject dropout from the below rationa le for 60 evaluable 
subjects.  
➢ The rational for this sample size is based upon the observation from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_366371] a sample size of 15 of a 78% drop in Total CRST from a mean of 20.4 to 4.7 
while the untreated sample dropped 4%. Based upon these data , the power to detect 
a change in the treated vs sham control is greater than 99%  with a sample size of 
60 subjects . In the crossover paired comparison , the power also is greater than 99%.  
➢ In order to detect the occurrence of side effects with at least a 5% frequency , the 
sample size was selected. With the proposed study design a total of [ADDRESS_458011] safety data. With 45 subjects the probability of observing an event rate of 5% 
is 0.95 for the 60 subjects total, 0.90 for 45 subjects (treated vs cont rol arm) and is 
0.52 for the 15 subjects in the crossover arm. The probability of observing an event 
rate of 0.01 is 45% with 60 subjects.  
➢ The additional [ADDRESS_458012] undergone the extensive screening and baseline evaluations

The randomization of subjects, i.e., the actual treatment assignments, will be p erformed by 
[CONTACT_366416].  The randomization in a ratio of 3:1 ( treated : sham control ) will be 
performed .  The randomization plan will be known only to the Database M anager and the 
Clinical Project Manager in order to protect the blinding.  
5.[ADDRESS_458013] on the general 
applicability of the results obtained. Potential confounders asse ssed will include:  
• Study Center  
• Lesion location  
• Demographic characteristics such as Sex and Age  
• Baseline CRST Score  
A number of these potential confounders are categorical variables with a large number of 
categories (e.g., Study Center, Lesion Location). Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_366372], in some cases yield small subgroups and substantially reduce power to evaluate 
potential confounders. To address this, categories will be combined by [CONTACT_366417][INVESTIGATOR_366373] a single cat egory (as is typi[INVESTIGATOR_366374]) 
or in a clinically meaningful manner. Groupi[INVESTIGATOR_366375] (SAP) prior to data analysis.  
We will assess the effects of covariates (confounders)  via logistic regression in which the 
dependent variable is Subject Success  (Yes/No)  and explanatory variables include 
Treatment and the covariate of interest. Each covariate will be tested separately.  
Assessing the effect of a potential confounder on treatment will be done by [CONTACT_366418]. Weakening or strengthening of the Treatment Effect in the presen ce of a 
covariate will be interpreted using both clinical and statistical considerations (e.g. 
examination of models that include interactions and including additional covariates in a 
single model). It is important to note that these interpretations must b e done with care, as 
we can expect meaningful effects to occur by [CONTACT_366419]

characteristics of subject drop -outs or withdrawals will also be performed to evaluate the 
presence of a drop -out bias .

[ADDRESS_458016] been performed to date with the MR guided FUS 
ExAblate body system.  Risk analysis for InSightec ExAblate  systems/clinical 
investigations has been conducted as part of previously approved FDA IDE submissions 
(G930140, G990151, G990184, G990201, G000203, G010225, G020001, G020182,

subsequent supplements, and P110039).  This data has been re -examined by [CONTACT_147724].  The key consideration here is the fact that this proposed 
study is conducted with an ExAblate transcranial system that is completely different from 
the body system. This is system is referred to internally as the Brain system.  However, in 
principle, the body and brain systems have the same purpose namel y to coagulate soft tissue 
within the body by [CONTACT_147725].  Additional 
risks, new and unique to this study are presented in Section -6.2. 
The potential risks described below will be explained to the subject in the informed consent 
process.  
6.1 General Procedure Related Risks  
6.1.1 Risk of Magnetic Resonance Scanners:  
MRI has no known deleterious biological effects in su bjects with no contraindications. The 
incidence of claustrophobia during MRI examinations is approximately 10 -15%.  All 
subjects exhibiting claustrophobia will be exited from the study.  
6.1.2 Risk of Intravenous (IV) Catheter:  
There is a potential risk from the IV catheter used during the procedure. Participants can 
expect a small amount of pain and/or bleeding/bruising at the IV site.  There is a small risk 
of infection.  This procedure will follow the ‘standard of care’ at the study site.  
InSightec  
 
InSightec Confidential  Page 48 of 67 
Version date: August 14 2014   6.1.3 Risk of Urinary Cathet er:   
There is a potential risk if a urinary catheter is used during the treatment.  Participant may 
expect varying levels of Urinary Tract Infection due to the use of the urinary catheter.  In 
a different study for the ExAblate treatment of uterine fibroi d (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_335018] 
G020001 that lead to PMA approval under PMA # P040003), the incidence of this risk was 
found not to exceed 3.7%.  This procedure will follow the “standard of care” at the study 
site. 
6.1.4 Risk of Stereotaxic Head  Frame :   
In this stud y, the Integra Radionics frame will be used for all treatments.   The main part 
of this frame is a metal based ring that serves as a base for the rest of the fixation 
components.   This frame comes with non -metallic posts mounts.   Into the non -metallic 
post mounts, accompanying nylon encapsulated screws with a metallic tip are fitted 
through the posts.   Only the metal tip of the screw is in contact [CONTACT_10970].   The risk 
of any skin event at or in the vicinity of the metallic tips is mitigated by [CONTACT_366420] t that the 
screws outer shell are out of nylon, and therefore eliminates any electrical conductivity to 
the skin.   This is further mitigated by [CONTACT_366421] -
metallic posts that links them to the metallic ring.   Hence, t he Integra frame is actually 
manufactured and sold with built in mitigating steps aimed at reducing / eliminating skin 
event risks. When the full set up is completed, the metallic ring is NOT in contact [CONTACT_10972].   
6.1.[ADDRESS_458017] medium 
for MRI.  The package insert notes that there are no known contraindications.   
Adverse reactions include : headache (incidence 8.7%), localized pain, vomiting, 
paresthes ia, and dizziness and localized warmth (incidence less than 2%).  Additional AEs 
listed on the package insert occur with an incidence of less than 1%.  
Precautions should be exercised for subjects with a history of grand mal seizures, severely 
impaired rena l function, or hemolytic anemia.   The very unlikely possibility of a reaction, 
including anaphylactic or cardiovascular reactions, should be considered especially for 
subjects with a known sensitivity to gadolinium or history of asthma.    
Nephrogenic Syste mic Fibrosis or Nephrogenic Fibrosing Dermopathy (NFD), kidney 
disorders, may occur in subjects with moderate to end -stage kidney disease after they have 
had an MRI scan with gadolinium -based contrast agent.  NSF causes fibrosis of the skin 
and connective tissues throughout the body.  Subjects develop skin thickening that may 
prevent bending and extending joints, resulting in decreased mobility of joints.  NSF 
usually starts in the lower extremities.  Fibrosis can also develop in the diaphragm, muscles 
in the thigh and lower abdomen, and lung vessels.   
6.1.[ADDRESS_458018] of deep venous thrombosis from lying in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_31774] 3 to 4 hours, but this risk is substantially mitigated by [CONTACT_366422] 49 of 67 
Version date: August [ADDRESS_458019] from lying still for this trea tment should be no greater 
than that of lying still for any other reason.  Subjects will be provided compression 
stockings, as described above (Section 4.3), for use during treatment and are able to move 
their lower extremities during the treatment.  DVT s creening will be performed at the 
discretion of the primary treatment team for any subject deemed to be at a high risk for 
thrombosis.   
There is a risk that the subject may experience a sore neck or back, or discomfort / fatigue 
from lying in the same pos ition for a long time during the treatment.   
6.1.[ADDRESS_458020] for all procedures:  
1. The procedure is performed i n the MR scanner. During the treatment MR images will 
be acquired. Using specific scanning sequences and a rapid post -processing program, 
changes in temperature can be detected, and a thermal map of the brain generated. 
This thermal map will reveal any pot entially dangerous elevations in temperature.  
2. Study personnel can regularly assess cognitive and motor function throughout the 
procedure (i.e.: after each sonication) as well as general neurological function. This 
will help to reveal any indication that ti ssue damage may be occurring along the beam 
paths.  
3. Subjects are asked to relay all sensations (i.e., disorientation/dizziness, pain, 
numbness, etc) occurring during the procedure to the circulating staff so that 
adjustments can be made to accommodate modif ications to the treatment plan or 
extend time between sonications.  
4. MR-compatible pulse oximeter, blood pressure cuff, and EKG monitor will be 
monitored throughout the procedure. This information will permit detection of tissue 
damage, edema, or bleeding, i f brain or blood vessels along the beam paths are 
injured by [CONTACT_10388].  
5. The subject, Subject Monitor and Assessor, and the neurosurgeon will each have a 
stop sonication button that can instantaneously interrupt the energy delivery at any 
time. The subject is gi ven a stop sonication button in case aberrant tissue heating 
causes any compromise to speech, word finding, or other communication difficulties. 
The subject will be instructed prior to the proceeding that they should use the stop 
sonication button any time  they feel excessive pain, discomfort, disorientation or any 
other unusual sensation. The neurosurgeon, Subject Monitor and Assessor, have stop 
sonication buttons so that if there is any sign of neurological change, the energy 
delivery can be immediately s topped and the subject carefully evaluated. Temporary 
interruption of energy delivery will in no way compromise the potential for 
therapeutic benefit to the subject. Following subject evaluation treatment can resume 
without delay   
InSightec  
 
InSightec Confidential  Page 50 of 67 
Version date: August 14 2014   The following risks may be associated with the ExAblate Transcranial thermal ablation 
procedure:  
1. Pain and/or discomfort  – There is a risk of discomfort to the subject caused by 
[CONTACT_366423].  Focused ultrasound therapy involves precisely controlled pulses 
of thermal energy r esulting in tissue coagulation (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 55 -65°C for several 
seconds) in small tissue volumes. This induces thermal coagulation of the targeted 
soft tissue.  The energy intensity at the level of the skin away from the pin sites is 
quite low and sonication  through scar tissue should be avoided..  The subject may 
experience both a cold sensation from the active cooling circulation of water 
within the rubber diaphragm as well as a rise in temperature in the skull which 
should be kept to below pain level by [CONTACT_3433] e active cooling. Because the focal point 
of the beam will be > 2.[ADDRESS_458021] also has the ability to 
abort the sonication at any time by [CONTACT_17906] a handheld cut off circuit (i.e., stop 
sonication button).  
See also Risk 9c regarding heating of the dura mater and the meninges.  
2. Headache  – The subject may experience a headache during or after the procedure 
whic h may be related to the pin site, slight swelling around the ablated brain 
tissue, or a reaction to the contrast media and should be transient.  
3. Disorientation, light -headedness, dizziness, unsteadiness, nausea/vomiting:  There 
is a potential risk that the subject will have sensations of light -headedness, 
dizziness, unsteadiness or even nausea/vomiting.  Based on the current data, these 
events should be transient and resolve within a day or so.  
4. Occurrences of transient numbness, tingling, eye twitch, hyperesthesia and/or 
paresthesia of the scalp, face and upper extremity have been reported in subjects 
undergoing Vim ablation for essential tremor.  These generally are transient are 
resolved within  minutes to one day.  One paresthesia lasted for 4 days;  one scalp 
numbness lasted 2.5 months.   
5. BBB disruption, edema, swelling, hemorrhage or stroke:  There is a potential risk 
of hemorrhage during ExAblate procedure  
a. At the focal point or targeted area -  In ExAblate thermal ablation, the high 
temperature at the focal point results in immediate protein denaturation 
and coagulative necrosis. This should be expected to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_366377].  
InSightec  
 
InSightec Confidential  Page 51 of 67 
Version date: August 14 2014   b. Outside and remote to the targeted area .. Alternatively, there could be a 
disruption of the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) which would allow blood to 
seep out of the cranial blood vessels into the brain tissue.  These events 
may theoretically occur due to heati ng effects (i.e. secondary hot spots) 
and or to the pressure wave of the ultrasound beam.  To address the risks 
due to pressure waves of the ultrasound beam path, the system has been 
designed to be well below the “pressure wave threshold” that may trigger 
events of this nature.   
In all cases, thermal and regular imaging will be continuously assessed during the 
procedure.  Furthermore, at the end of the ExAblate procedure, a contrast (Gadolinium) 
enhanced MR scan is performed to assess the blood flow within  the treated area and 
adjacent tissue.  This exam constitutes an independent treatment assessment tool that 
provides further information on blood flow and can serve as final check of the overall 
tissue status and alert the physician to any significant edem a, hemorrhage, and any 
other significant BBB disruption effect(s).  Finally, the subject(s) is continuously 
monitored during the ablation procedure for any change in condition.  
6. Imprecise focal point and ablation of tissue outside of target . There is a risk  of 
imprecise targeting of the focal point, and ablation of an area of tissue outside the 
planned treatment volume. If this occurred it is possible that serious neurological 
deficit or even death could result. To limit the risk of this occurring, the treat ment 
process includes a mandatory verification  step that requires the operator to first 
check the alignment of the subject anatomy, the focal point of the transducer and 
the MR imaging system.  This procedure, done while the subject is in position for 
treatment, uses a very low energy sonication to confirm of the alignment of the 
focal point and the targeted treatment point in all three axes. For each sonication 
delivered during treatment, the operator gets continuous feedback on the position 
of the intende d treatment point superimposed on the thermal dosimetry image and 
can make corrections where required.  
At any point in the treatment process this low -power verification of the localization 
may be repeated prior to full power sonication.  
7. Subject movement d uring the procedure that causes focal point to move/change 
location  – There is a risk associated with subject motion during a sonication or 
between sonications. This could cause a movement of the tissue relative to the 
planned treatment volume on the syste m, and in extreme cases could result in the 
treatment of a point outside the planned treatment volume.  Also, because the 
skull functions as a defocusing lens, the phase correction map computed for the 
target spot will become ineffective if the subject mov es.  To prevent or minimize 
this risk, there are several precautions taken to prevent motion, and to detect it, if 
it occurs:   
a. During subject positioning every effort will be made to make the subject 
comfortable and the subject will be educated as to the importance of 
maintaining their position during the treatment.  
InSightec  
 
InSightec Confidential  Page 52 of 67 
Version date: August [ADDRESS_458022] motion and will abort a sonication if 
motion occurs during the son ication and will indicate that motion has been 
detected prior to the next sonication being performed.  
d. One or more members of the medical team will be in the room throughout 
the sonication to monitor the subjects' medical status and comfort.  Hence, 
subject  motion will also be monitored.  
8. Risk of cavitation  - There is a risk of cavitation in the tissue at the focal point. 
Cavitation is the collapse of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_366378]. This rapi d collapse could cause high 
pressure, shock waves, and high temperatures. However, we believe that through 
proper system design and careful selection of system operation envelope, there is 
a very minimal risk that cavitation could occur during a treatment,  even in the 
event of user error. We have developed an automated treatment planner that takes 
as its input the targeted ablation area depth in tissue, focal volume and tissue 
absorption, and based on pre -set safe operating limits selects sonication 
paramet ers that will keep the intensity of ultrasound excitation well below the 
intensity levels that could cause cavitation.  
9. Risk related to sonication pathway  - There is the risk that the tissue along the path 
to the target (scalp, skull, dura, brain, etc) coul d become heated to the point where 
tissue -damage might occur which could result in significant neurological damage 
or even death.  This heating could be caused by [CONTACT_366424], irregularities on the skin surface (e.g.: scars), treatm ent of a volume of 
tissue too close to the skin or bone, energy absorption by [CONTACT_335077], or the 
conduction of sufficient heat to cause a burn. The heating in the energy pass zone 
is always monitored and an additional cooling time can be administered when 
elevated temperatures are detected.   Below are some possible risks related to the 
sonication pathway through different tissues in the head:.  
a. . Skin burn  is a potential risk due to improper acoustic coupling. There 
have been no cases of skin burn in all ExAbl ate transcranial treatments to 
date.  The treatment set -up process includes filling the gap between the 
ultrasound transducer and the skull with a water -filled membrane to 
provide acoustic coupling. There is a possibility of small air bubbles 
remaining att ached to the skin.  These could cause a small focal hot spot 
and cause local pain or a burn to the scalp. The active cooling mechanism 
unique to this system is designed to reduce the risk of skin burns and 
InSightec  
 
InSightec Confidential  Page 53 of 67 
Version date: August [ADDRESS_458023] 
caused burns of the skin using the ExAblate Body system. To minimize 
this risk, the scalp will be carefully shaved, and scars or other irregularities 
(e.g. eczema) will be kept outside the treatment pathway. Subjects with 
remarkable a trophy and poor healing capacity of the scalp (> 30% of the 
skull area traversed by [CONTACT_335078]) will be excluded from this 
study  
The subject will be in constant verbal contact [CONTACT_366425] a subject does experience 
pain discomfort. Remedies could involve lowering energy levels, or 
increasing the time interval between consecutive treatment pulses. The 
subject also has the ability to abort the sonication at any time by [CONTACT_17906] 
a han dheld cut off circuit (i.e., stop sonication button).  
b. Skull and air -filled spaces:  In the treatment planning, air -filled spaces 
(frontal, ethmoid, sphenoid sinus, mastoid) inside the skull are identified 
in bone window CT images and kept outside the pathwa y.  Should the 
operator not identify all air filled cavities on the treatment path, sonication 
through these areas could cause heating and result in burn of the tissue 
lining the cavity.  Operators are trained to avoid these sonication pathways 
by [CONTACT_335080].  
Other irregularities of the skull, which might scatter the acoustic energy, are 
compensated for in the system. Skull may become heated by [CONTACT_366426]. The skull cannot sense pain 
but the overlying soft tissues may sense pain if the bone becomes heated. 
MRI thermometry at 1.[ADDRESS_458024] changes of  ±3 Celsius in soft 
tissues  [86]. Possible heat transfer from the skull bone to the brain by 
[CONTACT_366427]. The sonication duration and energy levels, and the cooling 
times between the sonications are adjusted so that  the focus in the target 
tissue is heated while allowing other tissue to cool down between 
sonications. Local bone damage is unlikely because the active cooling 
mechanism system is designed to keep the bone temperature below a 
temperature that can damage i t.  Based on the data acquired to date and 
reviewed by [CONTACT_179937] G020182/S04, the average temperature rise at the 
skull level ranges between 1° to 5° Celsius.  Hence, this active cooling 
strategy should continue to provide the safety needed.  
c. Dura, meningeal arteries and venous sinuses:  The dura adjacent to the 
skull may absorb heat if the bone becomes heated. Dura itself may sense 
pain and the main branches of the arteries are sensitive to heat. The 
meningeal arteries can generally be avoided in the  treatment planning as 
their grooves in the skull are visible in 3D -CT. Local necrosis of the dura 
is unlikely, and were it to happen, it would not cause cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_366379] 54 of 67 
Version date: August [ADDRESS_458025] due to their proximity to the skull b ase and cranial 
nerves, respectively.  
d. Subarachnoid space:  Cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_366380].  There is no specific risk to the CSF itself becoming heated .   
Because it can flow within the subarachnoid space, this can serve as 
another mechanism to prevent local hot spots next to the skull.  
e. Cortex:  In previous studies, ExAblate thermal ablation of deep foci in the 
rabbit brain there was no detectable heatin g of the cortex on MRI or 
evidence of opening of the blood -brain -barrier elsewhere than at the focus 
of the beam.  Elevated temperature in the eloquent cortical areas (motor, 
sensory, visual, auditory, speech) might cause neurological deficits or 
seizures Temperatures in the eloquent areas will be monitored by [CONTACT_366428].  
f. Brain, cranial nerves and cerebral arteries:  In this study the trea tment 
path will avoid cranial nerves and major cerebral arteries.  Operators are 
trained to mark them on the MR for the purpose of avoidance during 
sonication.  
g. Target ablation and the adjacent brain tissue:   Thermal lesioning for 
the treatment of tremor th rough thalamotomy may carry some risks in 
particular to the internal capsule, ventral posterolateral nucleus of the 
thalamus.  To mitigate these risks, the ExAblate treatment will be 
performed in small incremental sonications within the designated target 
volume in the un -anesthetized subject.. The subject will be examined by 
[CONTACT_366429].  The titration of escalating focal 
sonications will start from well before eviden ce of thermal heat is detect 
by [CONTACT_366430]. 
This procedure will allow re -adjusting the targeting based on real time 
feedback from intra -procedure examination.  This process is designed to 
enhance the  procedure safety and minimize the potential adverse events 
that may be encountered in this study.  
h. Micro -calcification :  The subject population of this study may have some 
level of micro -calcification present in the brain tissue.  Given calcium’s 
higher a bsorption of ultrasound energy, its presence may create additional 
heating effect along the beam path.  This risk is mitigated by [CONTACT_366431] 55 of 67 
Version date: August [ADDRESS_458026] data (to localize the calcified areas) and the various tools of the 
ExAblate system to delineate these areas so that the beam is blocked from 
passing through these calcified areas.   
i. Secondary Hot Spots :  Theoretically speaking, there is a potential risk 
due to secondary hot spots that may occur along the beam path outside the 
focus.  This has been reported in th e literature for different types of 
transducer configurations using similar frequencies.  The ExAblate 
system, with its unique, highly focused transducer configuration, was 
tested extensively using advanced simulations.  The results of this work 
showed no evidence of significant hot spots away from the focal area.  In 
any case, the real time thermal imaging feedback samples the entire field 
of view around the targeted tumor.  These thermal images are displayed 
during the course of the energy delivery and th erefore if any evidence of a 
secondary hot spot is observed, the treating physician will be able to 
utilize the ExAblate system “real -time” stop sonication button that 
instantaneously halts energy delivery.  Importantly, the system is well 
equipped to hand le it in real time and prior to incurring any tissue damage 
by [CONTACT_366432] a Stop Sonication button 
being depressed..  
10. Neurological risks  Thermal “lesioning” in the brain may lead to heat transfer to 
immediately surrounding brain tissue or to hemorrhage. For a short period of time 
following the treatment, the surrounding tissue may be affected by [CONTACT_335089]. The length of the period cannot be predicted, but would be expected to 
resolve in 2 -3 weeks based on our pri or experience with sequential imaging in 
focused ultrasound thalamotomy for ET. These mechanisms may cause transient 
local neurological deficits or symptoms. These complications are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_366381]. If these symptoms are detected, medical managemen t with 
dexamethasone and/or mannitol might be effective.  In severe cases, a craniotomy 
can be performed to relieve increased intracranial pressure, and permanent 
neurological deficits or death could possibly result.  
No benefit  – The subject may receive n o benefit from this procedure.  While ablation of 
the Vim has generally been shown to be effective in tremor reduction, there is the chance 
that it will not be effective for the subject, or that the effect may not be permanent.   
6.2 Anticipated Treatment Side  Effects from ExAblate  
All adverse events will be reported in the Case Report Forms (CRFs) and analyzed for their 
relationship to the treatment device, the procedure, and disease progression. Based on 
previous treatment experience, the following anticipate d side effects have been identified 
as possible treatment related complications of ExAblate treatment.  These can be classified 
into Non -significant and Significant Anticipated Treatment Side Effects based on their 
medical severity, additional treatment re quired, and long -term consequences for the 
subject.  
InSightec  
 
InSightec Confidential  Page 56 of 67 
Version date: August 14 2014   Non-significant Anticipated Treatment Side Effects of ExAblate treatment are those that 
normally resolve without sequelae within 1 -14 days of the treatment:  
➢ minor pain from subject positioning or system interface (i.e. back pain, soreness 
in neck).  
➢ transient fever: oral temperature >100.4oF/38oC, lasting less than 24 hours  
➢ minor (1o or 2o) skin burns less than 2 cm in diameter  
➢ bruising of the skin along the treatment path  
➢ increase in edema surrounding th e treatment area as shown on MRI.  
➢ Headache  
➢ Dizziness, nausea or vomiting  
Significant Anticipated Treatment Side Effects of ExAblate are those which may require 
medical treatment, may have sequelae, and for which time of resolution is not defined. The 
following side effects are thought to be improbable but their relative risk remains to be 
defined:  
Scalp in the sonication pathway : 
➢ skin burns (>2o) with ulceration of the skin  
➢ scar formation  
➢ Loss of sensation  
➢ atrophy  
Bone in the sonication pathway : 
➢ bone necrosis  
Dura, venous sinuses, and cortical veins  
➢ subdural bleeding  
➢ vein thrombosis  
➢ Cortex  
➢ seizures  
➢ symptoms from disturbances of eloquent cortical areas (motor, sensory, auditory, 
visual, speech)  
Other brain tissue  
➢ necrosis of normal tissue due to incorre ct targeting  
➢ thermal damage to adjacent functional brain tissue (e.g.: optical tract)  
➢ bleeding in the treated area  
➢ cerebral infarction  
➢ neurological deficits  
➢ moderate or severe increase in cerebral edema as shown by [CONTACT_366433] 57 of 67 
Version date: August 14 2014   ➢ symptomatic increase of intracr anial pressure  
➢ death  
Cerebral arteries  
➢ bleeding  
➢ coagulation thrombosis  
➢ vasospasm  
➢ death  
The experience of Significant Anticipated Treatment Side Effects in ExAblate  treatment in 
the breast and uterus have been less than 5% as shown in prior clinical experience. In brain 
treatments there is limited prior experience with the ExAblate Transcranial system and the 
probability of an adverse effect is unknown.  It is the pu rpose of this study to gain 
experience that will allow us to evaluate the safety of ExAblate Transcranial system of 
TDPD (See also Section -6.1.7 .d). 
6.[ADDRESS_458027] during the procedure and the importance 
of immediately communicating any problems, unusual symptoms, or discomfort, to the 
investigator during the treatment and throu ghout the follow -up period. Subjects will also 
be educated as to what sensations or perceptions could indicate that neurological damage 
may be starting to occur. They will be told to use their handheld stop sonication button if 
they perceive anything unusu al may be happening so that they can be neurologically 
assessed. All adverse reactions occurring in this study will be recorded in the Case Report 
Forms.  Each AE will be assessed for its cause (i.e., categorized as definitely, probably, 
possibly, or unrel ated to the device, procedure or disease progression).  Alternative 
treatments resulting from post -surgical changes in neurological status will be captured and 
reported.

➢ continued noncompliance with the protocol or study visits,  
➢ severe illness or disability during the study for non -study issues,  
➢ pursuit of subsequent alternative tr eatment for the same condition, or  
➢ development of intolerable side effects where continued follow -up becomes too 
burdensome.   
In addition, a subject may also chose to exit the study at any time, but will be strongly 
encouraged to participate in the follow -up visits for safety reasons (continued monitoring 
of subject safety).

device harm.  Either of the following scenarios would create cause for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_366382]:  
➢ Any death that is deemed to be caused by [CONTACT_335091]  
➢ 2 or more events of intracran ial hemorrhage deemed to be caused by [CONTACT_366434]  
➢ Any other serious, related Unanticipated event that causes significant disability/ 
harm to the subject that is deemed to be the result of the ExAblate device.  
Investigator(s) shall promptly report the occurrence of any such events to the Sponsor (i.e. 
InSightec) and the Sponsor shall promptly initiate review by [CONTACT_366435](s) to the FDA.  Once the DSMB has had an initial assessment o f an event of 
this type, it may recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_366383].   This will be communicated to FDA and all IRBs and sites.   With full 
cooperation of the treating investigator and the Sponsor, the DSMB  will evaluate the 
circumstances of the event, determine relation of these events to the ExAblate, and whether 
any modifications to the protocol or the device must be made to improve safety.   The 
Sponsor will keep FDA informed of the results of the DSMB ev aluation and of any 
potential actions taken by [CONTACT_1034].  Once the review is completed and any mitigations 
are in place, and the DSMB recommends re -opening the study with concurrence by [CONTACT_1556], then then InSightec will communicate this with all sites a nd their IRBs to begin to 
re-open and continue the study.  
6.6 Adverse Event Reporting  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AE’s occurring during the course 
of the study.  At each visit, the investigator will evaluate AE’s. AE’s not prev iously 
documented in the study will be recorded on the Adverse Event Log within the CRF. The 
nature of each event, date and time (when appropriate) of onset, outcome, frequency, 
maximum intensity, action taken, expectedness, and causal relationship will be  recorded. 
AEs already documented in the CRF (i.e., at a previous assessment) and designated as 
‘ongoing’, should be reviewed at subsequent visits as necessary. If these have resolved, the 
documentation in the CRF should be completed including an end date for the event.  
Standard Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) definitions for Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
will be used for evaluation of adverse events.   
SAE  [§803.3(aa)(1)] is an injury or illness that:  
• causes death  
InSightec  
 
InSightec Confidential  Page 59 of 67 
Version date: August 14 2014   • is life threatening, even if temporary in nature;  
• results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage 
to a body structure; or  
• necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment 
of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure.  
All AEs ( related or unrelated) meeting the criteria for an SAE require notification of the 
sponsor and the reviewing IRB as soon as possible, with subsequent completion of 
additional paperwork provided by [CONTACT_95599], 
all treatments, and final outcome.  Initial reporting of an SAE should be made to the sponsor 
no later than two (2) working days after the PI [INVESTIGATOR_95549].  AE’s that do not 
affect the safety or overall well being of the subject, are mild/moderate in nature, are 
estimated to be temporary in duration even though the exact end date may not be 
determined a priori  (e.g., eye twitch increased from baseline) may be presented and 
discussed with DSMB to determine their final classification status as a serious or non -
serious adverse event.  
Standard Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) definitions for Unanticipated Adverse Device 
Effects (UADEs) will be used for evaluation of this type of adverse event.  
UADE  [§812.3(s)] means any serious adverse event on health or sa fety or any life -
threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, 
problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence 
in the investigational plan or application (including a suppl ementary plan or application), 
or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the 
rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
Any UADEs will be reported to the Sponsor and to the reviewing IRB as soon as possible. 
However, in no event must this report be made later than two (2) working days after the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_95549].  
6.[ADDRESS_458030] will be used to review all AE’s on the study. Their role 
is to evaluate all AE's that occ ur throughout the study and determine if they are in fact 
related to the ExAblate, or some other cause.  Investigators will monitor all treatments for 
any AE's, and consider the following questions for AEs in the Test Arm:  
- Was the adverse event serious?  
- Was the adverse event life -threatening,  caused a disability,  required or prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or caused death?  
- Was the adverse event device related?  
- Was the adverse event unexpected?  
- Is there an unreasonable risk in continuing the trial?

7 POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
There may or may not be any benefit to participating in this study.  This technique is still 
being investigated.  It may provide some therapeutic value for subjects with few or no other 
options due to the great risk that would be involved in open resection. The symptoms may 
decrease and/or the quality of life of the subject may improve due to relief of symptoms.  
However, there is no guarantee that this p rocedure will reduce, eliminate symptoms, or 
otherwise treat the underlying disorder.  Other subjects may benefit from this procedure in 
the future, if further trials prove it to be a safe and effective therapy.   
[ADDRESS_458032] of this study. The Clinical 
Monitor’s responsibilities include maintaining regular contact [CONTACT_366436] -site visits, to ensure that:  
➢ The trial is conducted according to FDA and GCP requirements;  
➢ The trial is conducted according to InSightec internal SOPs  
➢ The Investigational Plan is followed;  
➢ Complete, timely, and accurate data are su bmitted;  
➢ Problems with inconsistent or incomplete data are addressed;  
➢ Complications and unanticipated adverse effects are reported to the Sponsor and 
the IRB;  
➢ The site facilities will be monitored to stay adequate to meet the requirements of 
the study.  
The Clinical Monitor will initiate the Study during an on -site visit and will continue to 
perform on -site monitoring visits as frequently as deemed necessary. The first monitoring 
visit will usually be made as soon as possible after enrollment has been in itiated. At this 
visit and all monitoring visits, the Clinical Monitor will compare the data entered onto the 
InSightec

be available to substantiate proper informed consent proc edures, adherence to protocol 
procedures, adequate reporting and follow -up of AEs, and device procedure information. 
Findings from the review of CRFs and source documents during a monitoring visit will be 
discussed with the PI. Completed paper or electroni c CRFs will be reviewed prior to data 
closure at each visit. The dates of the monitoring visits will be recorded in a Log to be kept 
at the clinical site. During monitoring visits, the Sponsor expects that the study coordinator 
and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_5915] , the source documentation will be available, and a suitable 
environment will be provided for review of Study related documents.   
Sites should make every effort to contact [CONTACT_95602] -up to encourage visit 
compliance.  Sites should keep a log of dates of attempted contact [CONTACT_95603]. After [ADDRESS_458033] (e.g., by [CONTACT_19381]) and sending [ADDRESS_458034] to follow -up.    
Monitoring procedures  will follow the Sponsor SOPs.  
8.1 Electronic Data Capture (EDC)  
Electronic CRFs (eCRFs) will be to capture protocol -specific information during the 
conduct of this study.  This electronic data capture of the eCRFs is based on the Oracle 
Software system, and is designed, run and hosted by [CONTACT_2728] (Haifa, Israel).   
9 INVESTIGATOR RESPONSIBILITIES  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_147713].  All

Version date: August 13, [ADDRESS_458058] common movement disorder with an estimated prevalence 
between 0.3% and 5.6 %  [1-5].  Recent epi[INVESTIGATOR_147709]4 indicate that prevalence 
across 19 countries (pooled ) was 0.9%, but increased  to 4.6% among those 65 years and as 
high as  21.7% in those aged 95 and older .  The condition is a genetically inherited disorder 
with a child of an ET person having a 50% chance of inheriting a gene causing the 
condition.  Approximately 50 -70% of people diagnosed with ET have a positive family 
history for the condition.  Caucasians  are 5 times more likely to report physician diagnoses 
of ET than are African Americans ; Hispanics have  a rate between them .  Gender 
predisposition as reported in various articles is variable depending upon the author’s 
population . 
ET is a slowly progressi ve neurological disorder characterized by a tremor of the arms or 
hands that occurs during voluntary movements (intentio n tremor), such as eating/drinking 
and writing.  The tremor may also present in the head (neck) and jaw and may affect voice.  
The disease may present in the teens or in the 40 -50 age range.  Generally, tremor begins 
in the arms and then spreads to these other region s in selected patients.  Other types of 
tremor may also present, including postural tremor of the outstretched arms, and intentional 
tremor (below 5 Hz) and rest tremor of the arms.  The amplitude of an intention tremor 
increases as an extremity approaches  the endpoint of deliberate and visually guided 
movement (hence the name [CONTACT_147727]). An intention tremor is usually perpendicular 
to the direction of movement. An intention tremor  causes the person to overshoot  or 
undershoot  their target  (dysmetria) .   
11.2 ExAblate Neuro  System.  
The non -invasive high -intensity focused ultrasound has been coupled with high resolution 
MRI to provide precise, consistent treatments that can be monitored in real -time.  The 
development of phased array transducers allows for ti ghtly focused treatment volumes and 
for the ability to compensate for distortions by [CONTACT_147716] [6-8].  The landmark 
advance in the ExAblate transcranial MR guided focused ultrasound for neurosurgeons 
occurred as the ability to sonicate through the intact cranium was achieved with phased 
array transducers and acoustic modeling using CT reconstructions of the skull [6-10].  By  
[CONTACT_366438] f ocused ultrasound technology with MRI, the ExAblate system allows detailed 
treatment plans to be performed and real time intra -procedure monitoring [11].  Standard 
MR sequences have been shown to reliably predict tissue damage during t hermal lesioning 
with ultrasound [11, 12] .  We anticipate that the ExAblate Neuro non-invasive thermal 
lesioning is safe and will provide several years of benefit through reduction of contralateral 
motor symptoms and potential medication side effects in ET  subjects .

Version date: August 13, 2017   12 OBJECTIVES  
The objective of this clinical trial is to follow , observationally,  the medication -refractory 
Essential T remor subjects who underwent ExAblate Neuro thalamotomy under IDE# 
G120246  to capture  long-term safety and effectiveness  out to Year 5 .  
Safety : To evaluate long-term incidence and severity of adverse e vents (AE/AEs) 
associated with ExAblate Neuro  treatment of medication -refractory ET 
Effectiveness : To collect long term effectiveness and quality of life of the 
ExAblate Neuro  treatment of medication -refractory Essential Tremor  (ET).  
This study is designed as a long-term prospective, observational clinical trial to follow 
device related safety , and long term effec tiveness (CRST) and quality of life (QUEST)  for 
subjects previously treated with ExAblate Neuro under IDE#120246 . 
The purpos e of this protocol is to set the follow -up schedule for all IDE #G [ADDRESS_458059] approval conditions . 
12.1 Primary Endpoints  
12.1.1  Safety  
Safety of ExAblate will be determined by [CONTACT_147718] / treatment related complications from the treatment day visit 
through ALL study follow ups  through Year 5 .  Adverse events (type, frequency, 
severity) are expected to be similar to those of previous studies using ExAblate 
Neuro for Thalamotomy  
Recorded adverse events  will be reported and categorized by [CONTACT_147719], 
probably, possibly, or unrelated to the device  or procedure. Events which are not 
considered to be possibly or probably caused by [CONTACT_366439] t o be reported 
here.  
12.1.[ADDRESS_458060] quality of life patient 
outcomes questionnaire.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Efficacy Assessments  
Tremor symptom severity will be assessed using the  CRST as scored by [CONTACT_366440] -up visit .  The CRST is a validated clinical instrument used to 
assess tremor symptom severity.  
 
Quality of life will be evaluated using the  QUEST assessment  to assess durability (as 
measured by [CONTACT_147722]) of the procedure.   The QUEST is 
an ET specific assessment of quality of life changes associated with ET.  Tröster et al.,

1.  To enable subject(s) retention in the Long Term Follow -up study as well as to 
ensure patient welfare and safety (in full compliance  with all applicable patient 
consent regulation(s) and their corresponding IRB approvals), all p articipating 
sites  should ma ke every effort to  maintain frequent  contact  [CONTACT_108804]  (at 
least 3 to 4 times a year) to encourage visit compliance and keep them engaged 
for patient retention.   
In the event a patient miss their scheduled visit to complete the study visit requirements , 
sites should at the very least inquire with subject to provide an overall assessment of their 
safety and of their tremor in full compliance with all applicable patient consent regulations 
and rights, and or schedule another clinical visit even if it is o utside the visit window.

Version date: August 13, 2017   ‘ongoing’, should be reviewed at subsequent visits as necessary. If these have resolved, the 
documentation in the CRF should be completed including an end date for the event.  
Standard Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) definitions for Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
will be used for evaluation of adverse events.   
SAE  [§803.3(aa)(1)] is an injury or illness that:  
• causes death  
• is life threatening, even if temporary in nature;  
• results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage  
to a body structure; or  
• necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment 
of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure.  
All AEs (related or unrelated) meeting the criteria for an SAE require notification of the 
sponsor and the reviewing IRB as soon as possible, with subsequent completion of 
additional paperwork provided by [CONTACT_95599], 
all treatments, and final outcome.  Initial reporting of an SAE should be made to the s ponsor 
no later than two (2) working days after the PI [INVESTIGATOR_95549].  AE’s that do not 
affect the safety or overall well-being  of the subject, are mild/moderate in nature, are 
estimated to be temporary in duration even though the exact end date may not be 
determined a priori  (e.g., eye twitch increased from baseline) may be presented and 
discussed with DSMB to determine their fin al classification status as a serious or non -
serious adverse event.  
Standard Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) definitions for Unanticipated Adverse Device 
Effects (UADEs) will be used for evaluation of this type of adverse event.  
UADE  [§812.3(s)] means any  serious adverse event on health or safety or any life -
threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, 
problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence 
in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), 
or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the 
rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
Any UADEs will be reported to the Sponsor and to the review ing IRB as soon as possible. 
However, in no event must this report be made later than two (2) working days after the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_95549].  
15.[ADDRESS_458070] will be used to review all AE’s on the study. Their  role 
is to evaluate all AE's that occur throughout the study and determine if they are in fact 
related to the ExAblate, or some other cause.  Investigators will monitor all treatments for 
any AE's, and consider the following questions for AEs in the Test A rm: 
- Was the adverse event serious?  
InSightec  
 
InSightec Confidential   Page 12 of 19 
Version date: August 13, 2017   - Was the adverse event life -threatening,  caused a disability,  required or prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or caused death?  
- Was the adverse event device related?  
- Was the adverse event unexpected?  
- Is there an unreasonable risk in continuing the trial?  
Adverse Events meeting all the above conditions would require reporting to the FDA, 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_147710], and FDA approval to re -
start the study.   
All adverse events wil l be assessed for their relationship to the study device or procedure.  
Standard Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) definitions for SAEs and UADEs will be used 
in assessment of adverse events.

The results from the physical exams will be recorded in the CRFs and wil l be presented .  
15.5 Statistical Considerations and Sample Size  
There is no statistical consideration or sample size for this study.  All ExAblate treated 
subjects who were treated under  ET002 or ET002 -CA will be included in this study , 
starting at the next sc heduled study visit date ; ET002 -CA was FDA approved under IDE 
Supplement G120246/S07.  
15.[ADDRESS_458072] (LOCF) where data for mis sing visits is 
assigned the value of the previous visit.    
NOTE:   
All Demographic, Screening, Baseline, Treatment and some amount of Follow -up 
data are collected under ET002 or ET002 -CA and these data will be used in 
coordination with that collected under this protocol.  
15.7 Statistical Analysis Plan.   
The analy sis will be performed based upon the Statistical Analysis Plan (“SAP”) 
procedures as de fined for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397]  (FDA Approval of SAP under IDE 
InSightec  
 
InSightec Confidential   Page 13 of 19 
Version date: August 13, 2017   Supplement G120246/S06 ).  Please note, ho wever, that for the PAS, all analyses will be 
performed using the site assessor data only.

16 PMA P150038 Specific Questions  
What serious or unexpected adverse events may occur in the long -term (up to 5 
years) after receiving treatment for the proposed indication?  
No known device -related SAEs/UADEs are expected over the follow -up of subjects 
through Year 5 based on historical literature on thalamotomies as published in the 
literature.  The ExAblate procedure is a one -time procedure.  However, per this study 
protocol, safety data will be collected through Year -5 as planned.  The full safety data 
will be reported to the Agency as required.  
 
In the long -term (5 years), will favorable Composite Tremor/Motor Function scores 
compared to the baseline be sustainable among the patient s who have received the 
treatment?  
Based on historical outcomes as published in the literature, it is reasonable to believe that 
the Composite Tremor/Motor Function improvement will be maintained through follow -
up.  However, because this cohort of subjects  is the first group of subjects to be treated 
using the ExAblate [ADDRESS_458074] hands -on 
experience in using the device, it is reasonable to anticipate that there may be some 
patients who do not sustain their imp rovement over the duration of this study.  With the 
accumulation of user expertise in using the ExAblate 4000, it is expected that the 
composite Tremor/Motor score outcomes will be sustainable over long durations.  It is 
the purpose of this long -term follo w-up protocol to capture the very long term data  of the 
composite Tremor/Motor scores for this cohort of subjects.  
[ADDRESS_458075] been performed to date with the MR guided FUS 
ExAblate body system.  Risk analysis for  InSightec ExAblate systems/clinical 
investigations has been conducted as part of previously approved FDA IDE submissions

conducted with an ExAblate Neuro system that is completely different from the body 
system. This is system is referred to internally as the Neuro system.  How ever, in principle, 
the body and neuro systems have the same purpose , namely to coagulate soft tissue within 
the body by [CONTACT_147725].   
There are no additional new risks anticipated under this study.  All the risks were described 
under the original treatment protocol and are still active for this protocol.  No new 
treatments are performed here as this is strictly a long -term observational study.  
17.[ADDRESS_458076], such as,  
➢ continued noncompliance with the protocol or study visits,  
➢ severe illness or disability during the study for non -study issues,  
➢ pursuit of subsequent al ternative treatment for the same condition, or  
➢ development of intolerable side effects where continued follow -up becomes too 
burdensome.   
In addition, a subject may also chose to exit the study at any time, but will be strongly 
encouraged to participate i n the follow -up visits for safety reasons (continued monitoring 
of subject safety).  Sites should make every effort to contact [CONTACT_95602] -
up to encourage visit compliance.  Sites should keep a log of dates of attempted contact 
[CONTACT_366442] s. After [ADDRESS_458077] (e.g., by [CONTACT_19381]) and 
sending [ADDRESS_458078] related to the original ExAblate  procedure , or some other cause.  
Investigators will capture all adverse events , and consider the following questions:  
- Was the adverse event serious?  
- Was the adverse event life -threatening,  caused a disability,  required or prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or caused death?

- Is there an unreasonable risk in continuing the trial?  
Adverse Events meeting all the above conditions would require reporting to the FDA, 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_147710], and FDA approval to re -
start the study.  Following the DSMB review of the event, and if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1101] t he 
DSMB, a modification of the study protocol were necessary to provide adequate protection 
to future study participants, the modification would be implemented prior to reinitiating 
the investigation.  Any such amendment would be reported to the IRB and FD A for their 
respective approvals to re -start the study as it is required by [CONTACT_1729].  
All recorded adverse events will be assessed for their relationship to the study device or 
procedure.  Standard Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) definitions for SAEs and UADEs 
will be used in assessment of adverse events.

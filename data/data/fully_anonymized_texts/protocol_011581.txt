2.1 Background and Rationale
Why Is This Study Being Conducted
Uterine fibroids (leiomyomata) are the most common benign tumors in women and occur in up to 80% 
of women of reproductive age.[ADDRESS_1127725] 
common reason for hysterectomy in the [LOCATION_002] (US).1,[ADDRESS_1127726] of symptomatic 
uterine fibroids exceeds $2 billion per year in the US.4
The growth of uterine fibroids is highly dependent on both estrogen and progesterone.5
Although often asymptomatic, fibroids may cause symptoms severe enough to warrant therapy in 20% to 50% of women.
[ADDRESS_1127727] common reason for hysterectomy in 
women with uterine fibroids is heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding.  Non-bleeding symptoms, such as pelvic pain, are also a common reason for hysterectomy.
While there are numerous surgical options available to manage heavy bleeding or other symptoms due 
to uterine fibroids, until recently there was no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved long-term medical treatment for symptomatic uterine fibroids.
Elagolix sodium (hereinafter "elagolix," also referred to as ABT-620) is a novel, oral, short-acting, 
nonpeptide, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist that competitively inhibits the GnRH receptors in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_304].  Elagolix, unlike injectable GnRH analogs, produces a dose-dependent suppression of pi[INVESTIGATOR_112697], i.e., from partial ovarian suppression at lower doses to nearly full suppression at higher doses.  To support long-term therapy with elagolix at higher doses, hormonal add-back therapy would be required to mitigate changes in bone mineral density (BMD) and minimize other hypoestrogenic adverse effects of estradiol (E2) suppression (e.g., hot flush).  A detailed discussion of the preclinical toxicology, metabolism, pharmacology, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of elagolix in humans and a summary of clinical studies can be found in the Investigator's Brochure.

This study is being conducted to provide an option of elagolix 150 mg once daily (QD) for premenopausal women with HMB associated with uterine fibroids who are not suitable for or prefer not to use hormonal add-back therapy and/or desire an option of once a day dosing.
Clinical Hypothesis
Elagolix 150 mg QD will be effective in reducing HMB compared to placebo in premenopausal women with uterine fibroids.
2.2 Benefits and Risks to Subjects
Elagolix (Oriahnn®) capsules 300 mg with 1.0 mg E2 and 0.5 mg Norethindrone acetate (NETA) has been approved by [CONTACT_3557] 29 May 2020 for the management of HMB associated with uterine fibroids.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Completed Phase 2 studies and preliminary results from the Phase 3 studies of elagolix for the 
management of HMB associated with uterine fibroids show reduction in HMB in women with uterine 
fibroids compared with placebo.  The overall safety profile from Phase 2 showed elagolix is well 
tolerated.  Safety results for the Phase 3 studies in uterine fibroids are consistent with the Phase 2 safety results.  Elagolix 150 mg is approved for the management of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis.
7  Thus, the benefit/risk profile for the study is favorable.
For further details, please see findings from completed studies, including safety data in the elagolix Investigator's Brochure.

3 STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS
3.1 Objectives
To assess the safety and efficacy of elagolix 150 mg QD compared to placebo in reducing HMB associated with uterine fibroids in premenopausal women.  The primary hypothesis is that elagolix 150 mg QD, compared to placebo, reduces HMB associated with uterine fibroids in premenopausal women.   
3.2 Primary Endpoint
The primary endpoint will be the proportion of subjects meeting the following conditions:
!Menstrual blood loss (MBL) volume < 80 mL at the Final Month (the last 28 days of treatment), 
and
!≥50% reduction in MBL volume from Baseline to the Final Month (the last 28 days of 
treatment).
3.3 Additional Endpoints
!Proportion of subjects with suppression of bleeding at the Final Month and each month during 
the Treatment Period
!Proportion of subjects with amenorrhea at the Final Month and each month during the Treatment Period
!Change and percent change from Baseline in MBL volume at the Final Month and each month during the Treatment Period
!Change and percent change from Baseline in hemoglobin concentration at each month during the Treatment Period 
!Patient Global Impression of Change – Menstrual Bleeding (PGIC-MB) at each month during the Treatment Period
!Change from Baseline in Uterine Fibroid Symptoms Quality of Life (UFS-QoL) at each scheduled assessment

No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].3.4 Safety Endpoints
The safety endpoints will be based on the following evaluations: physical examinations, vital signs
measurements, electrocardiogram (ECG) variables, clinical laboratory testing (including hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, and lipid panel), and adverse event (AE) monitoring.
3.5 Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Endpoints
Pharmacokinetic Endpoints
Exposures of elagolix will be summarized, and elagolix concentrations may be combined with other studies and used to develop a population PK model.  Additional parameters may be calculated if useful for the interpretation of the data.
Pharmacodynamic Endpoint
Serum E2 concentrations will be determined at designated visits throughout the study and summarized.  Additional pharmacodynamic parameters may be calculated if useful in the interpretation of the data.  Estradiol data may be combined with data from other studies and used for exposure-response analysis.
3.6 Biomarker Research Samples
Optional samples (whole blood, serum, and plasma) will be collected at specified time points ( Appendix 
D) throughout the study to evaluate known and/or novel disease-related or drug-related biomarkers.  
Types of biomarkers may include nucleic acids, proteins, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], and/or metabolites. The objective of research is to analyze samples for biomarkers that will help in the understanding of uterine fibroids, related conditions, response to treatment with elagolix (or similar compounds), and changes in BMD.  Research may also include changes in epi[INVESTIGATOR_7009], gene expression, and proteomics that may be associated with uterine fibroids, related conditions, or the subject's response to treatment.  This research is exploratory in nature and the results may not be included with the clinical study report.  Biomarker samples will be collected only from subjects who consent to the optional exploratory analyses, unless precluded by [CONTACT_318019].
4 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
4.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
This is a Phase 4, randomized, double-blind, 6-month placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study.  Premenopausal women 18 to 51 years of age with uterine fibroids and HMB, as evidenced by [CONTACT_112729] > 80 mL during 1 menses in Screening as measured by [CONTACT_112744], will be selected for this study.  See Section 5.1for information regarding eligibility criteria.
Once eligibility is established during the Screening Period, eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in the double-blind period at the baseline visit to receive either elagolix 150 mg QD or placebo in a 2:[ADDRESS_1127728]-

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Treatment Follow-Up (PTFU) Period.  The study will be conducted in approximately 45 sites in the US 
(including Puerto Rico).
Total study duration can be up to 9 months (Screening Period of approximately 1.5 to 2.5 months prior 
to Study Day 1 [Baseline]).  The study consists of the following 4 study periods:
!Washout Period:  up to 10 months prior to Screening (only applicable if subject is taking exclusionary medication at the time of consent); duration is based on the excluded medication(Table 1 ).
!Screening Period:  approximately 1.5 to 2.5 months prior to Study Day 1 (Baseline).  Screening-related procedures to assess for eligibility must be conducted within first 1.5- to 2.5-monthduration.  However, in the event the cycle or product collection is not complete within 2.5 months during the Screening Period, the Screening Period may be extended with prior approval from [COMPANY_013] therapeutic area medical director (TA MD) and would result in a longer duration of participation for the subject than outlined.
!Treatment Period:  duration of 6 months (double-blind).  For all subjects who meet eligibility criteria during the Screening Period, each subsequent visit during the Treatment Period should be scheduled based on the date of the Day 1 (randomization) visit.
!PTFU Period:  One month following the last dose of study drug.  All subjects are expected to enter the 1-month PTFU after completing Treatment Month [ADDRESS_1127729] prematurely discontinues from the treatment period.  
The schematic of the study is shown in Figure 1 .  Further details regarding study procedures are located 
in Appendix F , Operations Manual.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Rescreening
Subjects who screen fail for this study (Study M16-824) may be rescreened with the TA MD's approval.  
The TA MD will determine which procedures need to be repeated if the subject was a screen failure for 
this study.  The subject must re-consent and meet all eligibility criteria at the time of re-screening to 
qualify for the study.
Choice of Control Group
The control group consists of subjects randomly assigned to receive placebo.  
Appropriateness of Measurements
Standard statistical, clinical, and laboratory procedures will be utilized in this study.  All clinical and laboratory procedures in this study are standard and generally accepted.
For efficacy assessments, validated questionnaires will be used to query study subjects about symptoms 
that occur commonly in patients with uterine fibroids or how uterine fibroids affects daily tasks and activities.
Suitability of Subject Population
Premenopausal women [ADDRESS_1127730] HMB (> 80 mL during 1menses in Screening) are selected for this study.  The lower age limit (18 years) was chosen based on the relative paucity of adolescent females with symptomatic uterine fibroids before 18 years of age; the upper age limit (51 years) is included to reduce the risk of subjects becoming menopausal during the study.  No studies in females outside of the reproductive years are necessary for this proposed indication.
Selection of Doses in the Study
The dose of elagolix 150 mg QD was selected to provide optimum efficacy while maintaining an acceptable safety profile in women with HMB and uterine fibroids not suitable for or prefer not to receive hormonal add-back therapy and/or desire an option of once a day dosing for HMB with uterine fibroids.
Based on preliminary integrated PK exposure-response analysis for efficacy from Phase 2 studies in 
women with HMB and uterine fibroids  
, elagolix 150 mg QD is predicted to provide clinically meaningful efficacy in reduction of 
HMB.  Elagolix has been evaluated extensively in women with HMB and uterine fibroids in Phase 2 studies.  No safety signals were observed in Phase 2a and 2b studies, and safety results from Phase 2 
and Phase 3 studies show that elagolix is generally well tolerated.  Refer to the elagolix Investigator's 
Brochure for further details.

Treatment Interruption
[COMPANY_013] or the investigator may request that a subject temporarily discontinue study drug administration, which will be referred to as a "treatment interruption."  The following are examples for reasons of treatment interruption (not all inclusive):
!AE that, based on clinical judgment, requires temporary suspension of treatment or prevents a subject from taking study drug
!Malfunction of barrier contraception or unprotected intercourse
!After a positive urine pregnancy test, while waiting for results of the serum test
!Clinical laboratory findings that require repeating or confirmation of a clinically significant value (e.g., may necessitate discontinuation from the study).
!Subject forgets to take study drug, lost study drug, etc.
Page 21 of 86
STUDY M16-824  |  Version 4.[ADDRESS_1127754] may withdraw consent for optional biomarker research at any time and remain in the clinical study.  Data generated from clinical study and/or optional biomarker research, before subject withdrawal of consent, will remain part of the study results.
Study Discontinuation
[COMPANY_013] may terminate this study prematurely, either in its entirety or at any site. The investigator may also stop the study at his/her site if he/she has safety concerns.  If [COMPANY_013] terminates the study for safety reasons, [COMPANY_013] will promptly notify the investigator.
5.[ADDRESS_1127755] Withdrawal from Study
To minimize missing data for efficacy and safety assessments, subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment should complete the procedures outlined for the Premature Discontinuation visit (PD visit) as soon as possible, preferably within [ADDRESS_1127756] an onsite PTFU visit 30 days after study drug discontinuation to ensure all treatment-emergent AEs/serious adverse events (SAE) have been resolved.
All subjects who prematurely discontinue will enter the 1-month PTFU Period unless the subject decides 
to discontinue the study participation entirely (withdrawal of informed consent).
All attempts must be made to determine the date of the last study drug dose and the primary reason for 
discontinuation of study drug and/or study participation.  The information will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page.  However, these procedures should not interfere with the initiation of any new treatments or therapeutic modalities that the investigator considers necessary to treat the subject's 
condition.  Following discontinuation of study drug, the subject will be treated in accordance with the 
investigator's best clinical judgment, irrespective of whether or not the subject decides to continue participation in the study.
5.7 Study Drug
Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive elagolix 150 mg QD or placebo for the 6-month double-blind Treatment Period.  The treatment administration is presented in Table 3 .

5.8 Randomization/Drug Assignment
All subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either elagolix 150 mg QD or placebo centrally using an interactive response technology (IRT).  Before the study is initiated, contact [CONTACT_814764] 23 of 86
STUDY M16-824  |  Version 4.[ADDRESS_1127758]'s eligibility has been confirmed and prior to the Day 1 (randomization) dose, a unique 
randomization number will be provided via IRT.  Subjects will be randomly assigned by [CONTACT_112784] 5.7upon entry into the Day [ADDRESS_1127759]'s conditions (e.g., antidote is available).  [COMPANY_013] must then be notified within [ADDRESS_1127760] to study subjects.  If a protocol deviation occurs (or is identified), the investigator is responsible for notifying IEC/IRB, regulatory authorities (as applicable), and [COMPANY_013].

Page 24 of 86
STUDY M16-824  |  Version 4.[ADDRESS_1127762] or to the 
medical device component(s).
For a product this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or packaging, product 
appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling discrepancies/inadequacies in the labeling/instructions (e.g., printing illegible), missing components/product, device not working properly, or packaging issues.
Product complaints concerning the investigational product and/or device must be reported to [COMPANY_013] 
within 1 business day of the study site's knowledge of the event.  Product complaints occurring during the study will be followed up to a satisfactory conclusion.
Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE, therefore, can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the 
product.  Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be AEs only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the investigator considers them to be AEs.
The investigators will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of AEs on a routine basis 
throughout the study.  All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an AE if the 
surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been pre planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an AE.
If an AE, whether associated with study drug or not, meets any of the following criteria, it is to be 
reported to [COMPANY_013] clinical pharmacovigilance as an SAE within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the SAE (refer to Section 4.3 of the Operations Manual ( Appendix F ), for reporting details and contact 
[CONTACT_3031]):
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would have resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been taken.  This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26182]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in 
fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical Event 
Requiring Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to Prevent Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life-
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based on 
medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.
Serious adverse events and protocol-related nonserious AEs will be collected beginning when the subject signs the study-specific informed consent.  From the time of study drug administration until PTFU Month [ADDRESS_1127763] (AESIs), and SAEs will be collected whether solicited or spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_423].  
[COMPANY_013] will be responsible for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) reporting for 
the investigational medicinal product (IMP) in accordance with global and local requirements.
AEs will be monitored throughout the study to identify any of special interest that may indicate a trend 
or risk to subjects.
Adverse Events of Special Interest
The following AESIs will be monitored during the study:
!Bone fractures
!Mood and depression-related events
!Hepatic transaminase elevations
During the study, [COMPANY_013] may require additional information on AEs, SAEs, and/or AESIs to be collected and recorded in the eCRF.

STUDY M16-824  |  Version 4.0
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Adverse Event Severity and Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each AE:
Mild The AE is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].
Moderate The AE causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject's usual 
activities.
Severe The AE causes considerable interference with the subject's usual activities and may be incapacitating or life threatening.
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the AE to the use of study drug:
Reasonable PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
No Reasonable PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
Pregnancy
While not an AE, pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within [ADDRESS_1127764] be discontinued (Section 5.5).  A positive 
urine pregnancy test result must be confirmed with a quantitative serum pregnancy test.  If the subject 
has a positive serum pregnancy test during the Treatment Period, no additional study procedures will be 
conducted; however, an ultrasound examination will be performed (and read locally) as early as possible during the first trimester of pregnancy to assess the gestational age and document an intrauterine pregnancy.
Pregnancies identified during the Treatment Period, although not AEs, will be monitored for fetus, 
pregnancy, and infant outcomes.  The pregnancy outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or congenital anomaly is considered an SAE and must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within 24 hours of the site's being made aware of the event.  For live infant births, information on the health of the infant will be collected from the first post-delivery pediatrician visit and at 6 to 12 months after delivery.
7 STATISTICAL METHODS & DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
There will be only 1 database lock and 1 analysis after all subjects complete or prematurely discontinue 
from the study.  The statistical methods provided in this protocol will be focused on primary efficacy 
analysis.  Complete and specific details of the statistical analysis will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
Page 27 of 86
STUDY M16-824  |  Version 4.0
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].7.2 Definition for Analysis Populations
The full analysis set (FAS) is composed of all randomized subjects who have received at least [ADDRESS_1127765] will be analyzed in the safety analysis set as taking the treatment to which she is randomized.  All safety analyses will be performed based on Safety Analysis Set.
7.3 Statistical Analyses for Efficacy
Primary Efficacy Analysis
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the FAS, and the primary endpoint will be the proportion of responders meeting the following conditions:
!MBL volume < 80 mL at the Final Month (the last 28 days of treatment)
!≥50% reduction in MBL volume from Baseline to Final Month (the last 28 days of treatment)
Subjects whose primary reason for prematurely discontinuing study drug is "lack of efficacy," or "requires surgery or invasive intervention for treatment of uterine fibroids" will be considered as non-responders.
The primary endpoint will be analyzed using a logistic regression model including treatment as the main 
effect and baseline MBL volume as a covariate.  Missing Final Month MBL volume will be imputed using multiple imputation.  For subjects who prematurely discontinue the Treatment Period prior to Month 6, 
the Final Month (the last [ADDRESS_1127766] dose date) will be used in the primary 
analysis.
Additional Efficacy Analyses
Details on other efficacy analyses are provided in the SAP.
7.4 Statistical Analyses for Safety
Analysis of safety parameters will include the following:
!The number and percentage of subjects with AEs
!A summary of laboratory values
The full list of safety endpoints and corresponding analyses will be presented in the SAP.

STUDY M16-824  |  Version 4.0
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].7.5 Statistical Analyses for Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics
Plasma concentrations of elagolix and serum concentrations of estradiol will be listed for each subject by 
[CONTACT_112799], as applicable.  Pharmacokinetic data may be combined with data from other studies in women and exposure-response analyses may be conducted as appropriate.  For example, if PK exposures are estimated, analyses may be conducted to assess the relationship between PK parameters 
or estradiol concentrations and efficacy and safety responses.  Additional analyses will be performed if 
useful and appropriate.
7.6 Overall Type I Error Control
No multiplicity adjustment is needed for this study as there is only 1 endpoint being analyzed and there is only 1 analysis of this endpoint.
7.7 Sample Size Determination 
Approximately 48 subjects will be randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) to receive either elagolix 150 mg QD (N = 32) or placebo (N = 16).  The sample size will provide at least 80% power to detect a difference between the elagolix 150 mg QD group and the placebo group in the percentage of subjects meeting the primary endpoint on MBL at the Final Month of the placebo-controlled Treatment Period, with a final volume < 80 mL and an improvement of ≥ 50% from Baseline, assuming response rates of 10% for the 
placebo group and 55% for the elagolix 150 mg QD group with a 2-sided α = 0.05.  The above sample size 
was calculated using nQuery Advanced 8.1.

Version 3.0 17 October 2019
Administrative Change 1 11 May 2020
The purpose of this version is to truncate assessments in a clinically appropriate manner, as this will now 
become an exploratory study to evaluate the effectiveness of the 150 mg elagolix alone dose to reduce 
HMB associated with uterine fibroids.  Other administrative revisions and minor clerical errors were 
corrected for consistency throughout the protocol in addition to the following:
!Removal of dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan from all timepoints in the study.  Monitoring of BMD in the study will not be included as part of protocol-specified procedures.   
Rationale: This study evaluates the low dose regimen of 150 mg QD for uterine fibroids 
administered for 6 months.  There is sufficient safety data for BMD at the 150 mg QD dose. 
!Removal of the Day 1 and Month 6 pelvic ultrasound (TAU and TVU).  
Rationale:   Pelvic ultrasound will only be used to determine eligibility.  Fibroid and uterine 
volume are no longer endpoints in the study.
!The PTFU Period was shortened from 12 months to 1 month.  Rationale:   An extended PTFU period is no longer necessary due to removal of DXA/BMD 
assessment. 
!Removal of secondary endpoints in the study Rationale:  Study changed to exploratory study.
!Reduction of sample size from 150 to 48Rationale:  Study changed to exploratory study.
!Additional directions for protocol modifications related to the Coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) pandemic were added to Operations Manual Section 2.2, Section 3.7, Section 3.8, Section 3.11, Section 3.22, Section 3.24, and Section 6.1.  
Rationale:  T o describe alternative processes that may be needed because of the COVID-19 
pandemic.

The gynecological/obstetrical and uterine fibroid history will be reviewed and should be updated if needed prior to dosing on Day 1 (randomization) and will serve as the Baseline for clinical assessment.
3.5 Adverse Event Assessment
Please refer to Section 6 of the study protocol.
3.6 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
Prior and concomitant medications will be assessed at the time points specified in Section 2and as 
described in the protocol.
3.7 Patient-Reported Outcomes and Rating Scales
Prior to the start of the study, [COMPANY_013] and/or its designee will provide detailed instructions and training for study site staff administering these scales.  The objective of this training is to establish uniformity across sites in administration of these rating instruments.  The subjects and/or the investigator or site 
staff will complete the following questionnaires as appropriate at the time points indicated in Section 2; 
the questionnaires should be administered before any other study procedures are performed at that 
visit.  Subjects and site staff will be asked to record their responses electronically (which will then be entered into the electronic case report form (eCRF), as applicable).
In the event that a subject or study personnel cannot come to the site because of the COVID-19 
pandemic, patient-reported outcome entries may be administered by [CONTACT_814766] (source) and transcribed into EDC or entered by [CONTACT_814767].  [COMPANY_013] should be notified.
Uterine Fibroid Symptoms Quality of Life (UFS-QoL) (4-Week Recall)
The UFS-QoL1is a disease-specific self-administered questionnaire used to measure health-related 
quality of life in women with symptomatic uterine fibroids.  At the times specified in Section 2, each 
Page [ADDRESS_1127788] will be asked to complete a modified (4-week recall) UFS-QoL Questionnaire to report fibroid-
related symptoms experienced during the previous 4 weeks.
Reason for Study Participation Questionnaire
In order to better understand the reason why a study participant has decided to enroll in this study, subjects will complete the single-question Reason for Study Participation Questionnaire at the Day 1 Visit ( Appendix A of the Operations Manual).
Physician Surgery Questionnaire (PSQ)
Each physician will be asked to complete the PSQ to evaluate the likelihood that the physician would consider surgery or a surgical procedure as one of the treatment options related to uterine fibroids for the subject ( Appendix B of the Operations Manual).  
Uterine Bleeding Questionnaire (UBQ)
Subjects who did not return a sanitary product collection keg (for alkaline hematin menstrual blood loss analysis) at applicable on-site visits (scheduled on-site visit, Product Collection Visit, Unscheduled, or the PD visit) during the study will be asked to indicate whether they had any uterine bleeding or spotting since their last study visit.  If the subject did not have uterine bleeding or spotting the site staff will indicate "No" on the UBQ.  If the subject did have bleeding or spotting, the subject will be asked the reason why they did not return sanitary product collection keg at the on-site visit.  This response will be 
recorded on the UBQ by [CONTACT_7893].  Subjects who did not return the keg will be retrained on product 
collection.
Patient Global Impression of Change – Menstrual Bleeding (PGIC-MB)
Subjects will use the PGIC-MB to assess the change in their severity of menstrual bleeding (from very much improved to very much worse) since initiation of study drug.
Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)
The C-SSRS2is a systematically administered instrument developed to track suicidal adverse events 
across a treatment study.  The instrument is designed to assess suicidal behavior and ideation and to track and assess all suicidal events, as well as the lethality of attempts.  Additional features assessed 
include frequency, duration, controllability, reason for ideation, and deterrents.  Site staff will 
administer the Screening/Baseline C-SSRS questionnaire in Screening and on Day 1.  During the Treatment Period, site staff will administer the C-SSRS Since Last Visit questionnaire at the time points specified in Section 2.2.  The C-SSRS administered at the Day [ADDRESS_1127789] year, either via answering "yes" to question 4 and/or question [ADDRESS_1127790] history of any suicide attempts "ever" on C-SSRS or via clinical interview, is not eligible for randomization.  If the subject expresses suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior on the C-SSRS or via clinical interview at any time during the study, the investigator should take appropriate action to protect the subject (including possible discontinuation from the study and referral for appropriate psychiatric care) and then notify the [COMPANY_013] TA MD.

Laboratory samples will be assessed using a certified central laboratory selected for this study.  The 
central laboratory will provide instructions regarding the collection (including any fasting requirements), processing, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_26172].  Blood draws should be performed after vital signs and 12-lead ECG recording are conducted at a visit.  
In the event that the central laboratory cannot be used to test samples because of the COVID-[ADDRESS_1127791] 
results.  Screening laboratory tests may be repeated one time prior to Day 1; however, results must satisfy entry criteria prior to randomization.  Subjects will not be randomized on Day [ADDRESS_1127792] results obtained prior to Day 1 will serve as the Baseline for clinical assessment.
The central laboratory will provide the laboratory results to the investigative site where they will be 
reviewed, signed, and dated by [CONTACT_093].  The investigator will receive sponsor-defined alerts from the central laboratory.  For any value outside of the reference range and/or sponsor-defined alerts, 
the investigator will review and indicate on the report if the result is clinically significant or not clinically 
significant.  The investigator will evaluate clinically significant laboratory values per standard of care, which may include repeating the test to verify the out-of-range value.  Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities after randomization may be documented as AEs if they require discontinuation or at the discretion of the investigator (see protocol).
Samples will be obtained for the laboratory tests listed in Table 1 at the time points specified in 
Section 2.

Clinical chemistry and lipid panel samples should be obtained in the morning following an overnight fast 
(minimum of 8 hours); however, there may be circumstances when the sample is obtained later in the day and/or not under fasting conditions.  If the sample was obtained with less than 8 hours of fasting, the source documents and the lab requisition should be marked to indicate that the sample was obtained under nonfasting conditions.
Pregnancy Tests (Serum and Urine)
Urine pregnancy tests will be performed at the time points specified in Section 2, in all subjects 
regardless of sexual activity status or method of contraception, including subjects who are surgically sterilized.  
Page [ADDRESS_1127793] result at any visit during the Treatment Periods (including Day 1 result).  The site will immediately 
inform the subject to discontinue study drug temporarily while the subject waits for the results of the 
serum pregnancy test.  If a serum pregnancy test result is positive, the subject will be prematurely discontinued from the study drug.  The site should instruct the subject to complete a Premature Discontinuation visit within [ADDRESS_1127794]'s fetus, pregnancy, and infant outcomes.
Urine Test for Gonorrhea and Chlamydia (Optional)
Gonorrhea and chlamydia testing can be ordered at the investigator's discretion to test for active gonorrhea or chlamydia before the endometrial biopsy is performed.  These samples will be sent to the central laboratory for analysis.  If the investigator determines that an abnormal test result can be treated, treatment will be outside of the protocol.  Follow-up gonorrhea/chlamydia testing (per instructions from the central laboratory) can be performed after treatment at the investigator's discretion.
3.9 Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Sampling
Blood samples for assay of elagolix, also known as pharmacokinetic samples, will be collected by [CONTACT_112777] 3-mL evacuated K
2-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (K 2EDTA)-containing collection 
tubes at the time points specified in Section 2.  Samples will be collected regardless of the time of last 
dose.  Sufficient blood will be collected to provide approximately 1 mL of plasma from each sample. 
Blood samples for assay of estradiol, also known as pharmacodynamic samples, will be collected by 
[CONTACT_112777] 4-mL evacuated collection tubes without anticoagulant (red cap, no gel separators to be used) at the time points specified in Section 2.  On Day 1, estradiol samples will be collected prior to 
dosing.  Samples collected at all visits other than Day 1 will be drawn at any time during the visit.  Sufficient blood volume will be collected to provide approximately 1.6 mL of serum from each sample. 
The date and time of blood collections will be recorded on the Central Laboratory Requisition Form (see 
Section 5.[ADDRESS_1127795] 4 doses prior to study visit).

handling/processing, and shipment.
The Bioanalysis Department at [COMPANY_013] will use validated assays to determine plasma concentrations of 
elagolix and serum concentrations of estradiol.
3.10 Biomarker Research Sampling
Optional biospecimens (whole blood, serum, and plasma) for biomarker research will be collected at the time points specified in Section 2.  All biomarker samples should be collected, labeled, and shipped as 
outlined in the study-specific lab manual.
[COMPANY_013] (or people or companies working with [COMPANY_013]) will store the biomarker samples and data in a 
secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  The samples may be retained while research on elagolix (or drugs of this class) or uterine fibroids and related conditions continues, but for no longer than 20 years after study completion, or per local requirement.
3.11 Contraception Counseling/Dispense Contraceptives
The sponsor will train investigators and study staff on the importance of contraception in this clinical trial.  The investigator or designated study staff will counsel subjects (excluding those who have had a bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral tubal occlusion) at every on-site visit throughout study participation 
on the importance of pregnancy prevention and the use of appropriate and effective methods of 
contraception.  
Subjects must agree to use at least 2 forms of nonhormonal contraception (dual contraception) as 
indicated in the protocol.  If a subject has used LNG-IUS at least [ADDRESS_1127796] to confirm in writing 
(via signature) her full awareness that the potential risks of study drug on the unborn child are 
unknown, and therefore, she must not get pregnant during the entire time of study 
participation, and that she agrees to consistently use protocol-required nonhormonal 
contraception throughout her study participation.
2. The investigator or designated study staff will counsel the subject that the study drug is not 
contraceptive, that ovulation may occur even though the study drug may have altered menstrual cycle patterns, and that fetal abnormalities have been reported in women who have received elagolix in clinical studies; however, it is unknown whether these abnormalities were the result of taking elagolix.

protocol-allowed contraception methods, their effectiveness, and proper use.
!The sponsor will provide all investigative sites with a supply of materials to promote 
pregnancy prevention, including contraceptives (e.g., condoms and spermicides) to provide to subjects at no charge.  
!Subjects should only use the pregnancy prevention materials provided by [CONTACT_814768].
!Subjects will be allowed to choose an acceptable contraception method of their choice from the contraceptives provided by [CONTACT_814769].  The site will assess the subject's basic understanding 
of the proper contraceptive use through discussion and demonstration of proper 
techniques, if needed, including proper diaphragm use.
!The site will provide contraceptives and other supplies (e.g., lubricants) to subjects at the time points specified in Section 2, as necessary.  
!The source documents will capture the date that initial contraception counseling was performed, whether the subject meets protocol criteria for not requiring use of dual contraception, and the type of contraceptive provided to the subject (as applicable).  At subsequent study visits, the source documents will capture any change in contraceptive method, use of a non-study supply brand, and whether additional contraceptives were provided to the subject.
!The subject will be asked to attest by [CONTACT_112756], and subsequently in a stand-alone attestation form at all on-site study visits that allowable methods of contraception, as described during the pregnancy prevention counseling, are being practiced.
!For subjects who have had a bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral tubal occlusion, (including Essure®) or LNG-IUS, attestation is only required to be collected once during the study prior to randomization, ideally at the time of consent.  Additionally, these subjects do not require contraception counseling at any study visit or the associated documentation of that counseling.
4. Monthly study contacts are used to promote frequent interaction with site staff and 
opportunities for continued education.
5. At each Treatment Period visit (on-site), the proper use of contraception will be reinforced to 
address possible ineffective use and the risk of unexpected pregnancy due to unprotected sexual activity.
3.12 Height and Weight
Height and body weight will be measured at Screening (Section 2.1).  The subject will wear lightweight 
clothing and no shoes during weighing.  The weight measurement at Screening will serve as the Baseline for clinical assessment.

Vital sign determinations of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, and body temperature will 
be obtained at the time points specified in Section 2.  The blood pressure and heart rate measurements 
should be taken prior to scheduled blood collections (if applicable).  Subjects should be seated for a minimum of 5 minutes before vital signs are taken; subjects are to remain seated when vital signs are taken.  Measurements should be assessed consistently throughout the study and will be recorded in the source documents and eCRF.
The vital signs measurements obtained prior to dosing on Day [ADDRESS_1127797]'s medical history, will be captured on the appropriate eCRF page.
3.15 Gynecological (Pelvic and Breast) Examination
A complete breast and pelvic examination, including external genitalia, will be performed at the time 
points specified in Section 2.  The complete breast and pelvic examination completed during Screening 
will serve as the Baseline for clinical assessment.
3.[ADDRESS_1127798] will be performed in Subjects > [ADDRESS_1127799] will be performed using the Thin Prep® Pap Test™ provided and analyzed by [CONTACT_2237].  If the subject is experiencing uterine bleeding that precludes the performance of the Pap test, this procedure should be performed as soon as possible after the uterine bleeding has ended.  In the case of an unsatisfactory sample, the Pap test can be repeated.  The repeat Pap test should also be performed 
when the subject is not experiencing uterine bleeding.  In order to be enrolled in the study, the Pap test 
must meet eligibility requirements as outlined in Figure [ADDRESS_1127800] Eligibility.
Subjects who are 25 to 51 years of age, with the Pap diagnosis of atypi[INVESTIGATOR_138960] (ASC-US), or low grade squamous intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_112716] (LSIL) and those

with or without high-risk HPV will be screen failed and may undergo additional evaluation/colposcopy outside of the protocol per local guidelines or standard of care.
If a Subject has a colposcopy performed outside of the study, they may be rescreened if they have no 
other exclusionary criteria and has had an adequate colposcopy with a negative endocervical sample 
post colposcopy.  If biopsies are performed, they must show a histological diagnosis of cervical intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_28601] (CIN) [ADDRESS_1127801] colposcopy. 
Subjects with the cytology screening result of high-grade squamous intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_112716] (HSIL), atypi[INVESTIGATOR_642421] (ASC-H), atypi[INVESTIGATOR_138955] (AGC), or atypi[INVESTIGATOR_642422].
Subjects should continue with recommended Pap testing outside of the protocol per standard of care 
and local guidelines during the study.

Instructions on endometrial biopsy collection and processing procedures for shippi[INVESTIGATOR_642424].  Sites can either use the endometrial biopsy instruments provided by [CONTACT_642444].
Pre-medication for the endometrial biopsy procedure is allowable and should be recorded in source 
documents and on the appropriate eCRF.  At the investigator's discretion, misoprostol for cervical dilatation is allowable.  
If the endometrial biopsy is performed on the same day as the Pap smear or pelvic ultrasound, the 
endometrial biopsy should be performed after the Pap smear and pelvic ultrasound, including SIS.
The investigator must obtain and review biopsy results from the central laboratory to ensure that 
eligibility criteria are met before the subject can be randomized on Day 1.  In case of an insufficient sample, the biopsy may be repeated; however, results must be available prior to randomization.  If there is a need for an office hysteroscopy to obtain the endometrial biopsy sample, the [COMPANY_013] TA MD (Section 1) should be consulted.  If biopsy needs to be repeated and SIS is pending or repeat SIS is 
requested by [CONTACT_39582], it is recommended that both procedures be planned together; the endometrial biopsy should be performed immediately after SIS.  Subjects must have an adequate endometrial biopsy, (i.e., results show no endometrial pathology) to be eligible for randomization.
If an abnormal finding such as endometritis, hyperplasia (with or without atypia), or endometrial cancer 
is reported, subjects will not be eligible for randomization into the study.  If the investigator determines that an abnormal finding can be treated outside of the protocol, the subject will be considered a screen failure, but may be rescreened after treatment per rescreening guidelines in the protocol.
3.18 12-Lead Electrocardiogram
12-lead ECG will be performed at the designated study visits as specified in Section 2.1.  The ECG should 
be performed prior to blood collection.
The ECGs will be evaluated by [CONTACT_41596] ("local reader").  The local 
reader from the site will sign and date all ECG tracings and will provide his/her global interpretation as a written comment on the tracing using the following categories:
!Normal ECG
!Abnormal ECG – not clinically significant

3.19 Mammogram
A mammogram will be obtained during Screening (only for subjects who will be 40 years of age or older at the time of consent) unless the subject had a mammogram performed within [ADDRESS_1127803]'s interpretation will be used to determine 
if a subject meets eligibility criteria.
!Subjects with normal or benign findings or Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) Classifications 1, 2, or 3 (via mammogram or other mode of imaging) will be eligible for the study.  
!Subjects with an abnormal mammogram or BI-RADS 4, 5, or [ADDRESS_1127804] imaging results indicate further testing is required (e.g., breast biopsy) to rule out any potential exclusionary findings, the subject is not eligible for the study.  Any further imaging or testing will be performed outside of the protocol and should follow standard of care.  
!If a subject's mammogram results are incomplete ([BI-RADS] 0) and need to be repeated, the [COMPANY_013] TA MD does not need to be contact[CONTACT_814770] (e.g., ultrasound, spot compression) is conducted.  If results meet entry requirements, the subject will be allowed to continue in Screening.  
Subjects should continue with recommended mammography testing outside of the protocol per local guidelines and standard of care during the study.
3.20 Central Imaging Procedures
Pelvic Ultrasound:  TAU and TVU
The pelvic ultrasound (TAU, TVU, SIS) will be performed by [CONTACT_112761]' or affiliated radiology 
department.  If magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is requested by [CONTACT_814771]' or affiliated radiology department.  The ultrasonographer at each investigative site will be required to acquire the ultrasound, SIS, and MRI (if applicable) images according to the Imaging Acquisition Guidelines provided by [CONTACT_9251].  Images (still images and video clips as requested) should be transmitted to the central reader to determine eligibility for entry into the study.

that there be short turnaround time for local read. 
The investigator or designee is responsible for review of local ultrasound, SIS reports, and/or MRI 
images for subject safety.  Any abnormal findings that are clinically significant and that requires medical intervention should be reported as AE.  The interpretation of the local report and/or images will be filed 
or recorded in the subject's source documents.  Data and/or local interpretation from the local 
ultrasound and SIS images will not be recorded in the eCRF.
Central Reader assessments for the pelvic ultrasound include, but are not limited to the following:
!Endometrial thickness
!Presence of abnormal endometrial appearance or endometrial pathology
!Presence of uterine fibroids
!Volume of largest fibroid at Baseline in cubic centimeters
!Uterine volume in cubic centimeters
!Presence of ovarian cysts:  Number; size (cm); location (right/left ovary); simple/complex/corpus 
luteum
!Endometrioma > 3.[ADDRESS_1127805] diameter
!Solid ovarian lesions > 1.[ADDRESS_1127806] diameter
Saline Infusion Sonohysterography (SIS)
In addition to the pelvic ultrasound, an SIS will also be performed in all subjects during the Screening 
Period, to assess eligibility criteria based on the presence of focal intracavitary lesions including:
!Large endometrial polyp ( ≥1 cm)
!Intracavitary submucosal pedunculated fibroid (FIGO Type 0)
Subjects should have a negative urine pregnancy test within 24 hours before undergoing the SIS.  It is recommended that video clips be captured during SIS (see Imaging Acquisition Guidelines). 
The SIS should be performed as early as possible during the Screening Period to rule out any 
exclusionary findings.  For subjects entering Washout, a SIS will not be performed until the subject enters the Screening Period to limit the number of invasive procedures before her eligibility is fully determined.
If a subject has an endometrial polyp ≥ [ADDRESS_1127807] the polyp removed outside of the study 
(before entering Screening), the subject must have a negative pathology report and return to 
one normal menses prior to Screening.  
Subjects who have qualifying uterine fibroids and/or uterine volume as assessed by [CONTACT_814772], SIS may be repeated.  Alternatively, an MRI may be performed in lieu of SIS if SIS cannot be performed (e.g., due to location or

3.23 Randomization/Drug Assignment
The site will contact [CONTACT_185686] (IRT) during the Washout or Screening Period to obtain a subject (Screening) number after the subject has signed the informed consent.  Consecutive and unique subject numbers will be assigned and used to identify each subject throughout the study.  The registration of the first Screening Visit will trigger shipment of clinical drug supplies to the study site.  
Subjects will be randomly assigned by [CONTACT_807421] 150 mg QD or placebo on Day 1; a 
unique randomization number will be provided via IRT.  
Page [ADDRESS_1127814].  Sites will register subjects as "Completed" or "Discontinued" (if the subject prematurely discontinues) at the end of the Treatment Period and will also indicate whether the subject will enter the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period.

5 COUNTRY-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
5.1 S[LOCATION_003]R Reporting
[COMPANY_013] will be responsible for S[LOCATION_003]R reporting for the IMP in accordance with global and local guidelines and Appendix A of the investigator brochure will serve as the Reference Safety Information 
(RSI).  The RSI in effect at the start of a DSUR reporting period serves as the RSI during the reporting 
period.  For follow-up reports, the RSI in place at the time of occurrence of the "suspected" serious adverse reaction will be used to assess expectedness.
6 STUDY DRUG
6.1 Treatments Administered
Subjects will be centrally randomly assigned using an IRT.  Subjects randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio to receive elagolix 150 mg film-coated tablet or respective matching placebo tablet by [CONTACT_814776] 6 months in the Double-Blind Treatment Period.
The study drug will be dispensed in the form of tablets at the visits listed in Section 2.2.  Study drug 
should be taken with approximately 8 oz. (240 mL) of water without regard to food and should be taken 
at approximately the same time each morning to promote compliance.  Subjects will be instructed to return all study drug kits (used/unused/unopened) to the study site staff at study visits throughout the Treatment Period or Premature Discontinuation visit (if applicable).
Study drug must not be dispensed without contact[CONTACT_112785].  Study drug may only be dispensed to subjects 
enrolled in the study according to kit numbers provided by [CONTACT_6606].  Sites should not contact [CONTACT_814777] a subject is onsite for the visit and urine pregnancy test is negative.  In the event that a

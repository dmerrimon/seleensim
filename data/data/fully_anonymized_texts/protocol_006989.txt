A participant may withdraw from the study at any time.  The Sponsor will be notified of withdrawal.  Data obtained up until withdrawal may be used. A participant may be asked to or the study team may  terminate participation if they cannot comply with the procedures outlined in the Protocol.     1.18 Criteria for Study Termination  The Sponsor and the investigators reserve the right to terminate the study or participation in the study, respectively, at any time. Both parties will arrange discontinuation procedures. In terminating the study, the Sponsor and the investigators will assure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the subjects’ interests.   The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time for medical or administrative reasons. When feasible, a 30-day written notification will be given. The entire study will be stopped if:  • Evidence has emerged that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_115477](s), makes the continuation of the study unnecessary or unethical. • The stated objectives of the study are achieved. • The development of the study device is discontinued. • Determined appropriate per Sponsor’s discretion.  Regardless of the reason for termination, all data available for subjects at the time of discontinuation of follow up must be recorded on the eCRF. All reasons for discontinuation of treatment study participation must be documented.  2. Introduction  2.1. Background  Hearing loss is the third most common chronic health condition, affecting nearly a quarter of Americans [4,5]. Age-related hearing loss is the most common cause and progresses over years from mild (26-40 dB hearing level [HL]) to, in increasing disability categories by 20 dB steps, profound (81 dB HL or greater) 
  
Page 14 of 36 [1,4,5]. The majority of those affected have mild hearing loss, though individuals with normal range hearing, and those with unilateral hearing losses with normal hearing in their better ear, may also experience hearing problems [1,5]. Hearing loss is associated with significant comorbidities, including loneliness and social isolation [6]. Untreated hearing loss is associated with greater incident morbidity than no hearing loss across a range of health conditions, including dementia, depression, falls, and cardiovascular disease [7,8].  These comorbidities may occur many years before intervention for hearing loss, including in the mild -to -moderate hearing loss range where disability may be perceived as subtle [9]. This delay in intervention may be related in part to an access issue, as current standard is referral to an audiology clinic for testing and subsequent fitting for a hearing aid, which may occur over many months at significant cost in most regions of the [LOCATION_002] [9]. This is related in-part to limited availability of audiologists and high volume of referrals. This supply and demand ratio is expected to negatively compound with the recent CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) recommendation for annual hearing screen for all adults with diabetes (11.3% of the US population) [10,11].  2.2. Rationale  Most who would benefit from aided hearing do not seek intervention, in part due to challenges with hearing aids after discovery. Hearing aid adoption rate is poor at approximately 33%, with a reported range of [ADDRESS_157837] hearing aid fitting [9,12]. Reasons for this delay in care may include cost, stigma, and ease of use [9]. Delays in hearing aid may contribute to the comorbidities associated with the condition. The Aging and Cognitive Health Evaluation in Elders (ACHIEVE) trial was designed to assess for cognitive benefit in hearing loss intervention in an elderly population; findings are expected in 2023. In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_138886], mental activity engagement increased in the hearing intervention group and decreased in the successful aging education intervention group that did not focus on improving hearing [13].  There is need for earlier and more efficient screening and intervention options with lower user barrier for adults with hearing problems. Here we propose a study to support decreased burden for hearing aid by [CONTACT_138904].  2.3. Study Objectives  2.3.1. Primary Objective  Primary Objective Procedure Measures Assess subjective non-inferiority in user -perceived benefit between a Self-Fitted (tuned) hearing assist settings group and a Professionally-Fitted (tuned) hearing assist settings group in participants with perceived or measured mild to moderate hearing loss.  Clinic Visit 1  Following enrollment, participants will be randomly assigned into 2 independent groups (SF or PF). The software enabled hearing aid algorithm will be used in SF group, and the audiologist best practice algorithm will direct baseline hearing aid settings in PF group.   
  
Page 15 of 36  Home Interval 1 During daily activities, participants will observe strengths and weaknesses of their hearing aid settings to guide/inform subsequent fine-tuning in clinic. Participants have the option to make setting adjustments during this interval for listening needs and/or to avoid discomfort.  Clinic Visit 2 Real Ear measures will follow fine-tuning in both groups. Specifically, a probe microphone will be placed in the ear canal by [CONTACT_138905]. These measurements assess the frequency-level dependent gain that a given ear receives relative to the acoustic targets defined for a chosen fitting formula (i.e., NAL-NL2 [National Acoustic Laboratories for prescribing nonlinear gain]).  Participants in both groups will have baseline unaided Speech-In-Noise (SIN) objective assessment to gauge independent ability in these primary aspects of hearing.  Home Interval [ADDRESS_157838] final Real Ear measures with headphones in situ to assess changes after field adjustments, and participate in aided SIN testing.  2.3.2. Exploratory Objectives  Exploratory Objectives Procedure Measures Assess objective improvement in hearing between a SF (tuned) hearing assist settings See Primary Objective (Section 2.3.1) for detailed Participant variables. The outcome measures

Study Design  3.1. Overview  This is a prospective intervention-based study that will involve data collection from individuals with measured or perceived mild-to-moderate hearing loss. This study is deemed to meet the qualifications of a research study with non-significant risk. The study includes in-clinic data collection, and data collected in a participant’s- home environment or when completing daily activities. After a screening visit, the study will involve at least three clinic visits to obtain a smartphone and wireless headphones, in-clinic assessment and measures, survey data, and two home intervals for optimization of hearing assist settings.  3.1.1. The Sub-Study Cohort  Preceding the start of the clinical validation study, a smaller group of participants will be enrolled into a sub-study . These participants will follow similar study procedures outlined in this protocol. After the completion of the sub-study, the clinical validation study will commence at a later date. This sub-study is intended to provide assurance that all of the data collection, evaluation, and data transfer tools are performing as intended prior to the start of the clinical validation study or reveal unanticipated aspects of the study. As such, these participants are a separate cohort and will not be included in any of the endpoint analyses for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397].  
  
Page [ADDRESS_157839] a screening visit and up to three scheduled clinic visits interspersed by [CONTACT_138906]. The participants enrolled into the sub-study cohort will follow similar study procedures: • Screening Visit (~2 hours): informed consent, potential Pure Tone Audiometry (air conduction audiometry), medical history, and brief physical exam of the ears conducted by [CONTACT_138907]; time from Screening Visit to Clinic Visit 1 will be no longer than 3 weeks • Clinic Visit 1 (~1.5 hour): examination of the ears by [CONTACT_138908], bone conduction audiometry, tympanometry, Pure Tone Audiometry (air conduction audiometry), enrollment, and baseline hearing assist software settings • Home Interval 1 (3-8 days; begins on same day as Clinic Visit 1): observations of baseline hearing assist software settings during participant’s daily activities, Participants have the option to make setting adjustments during this interval for listening needs and/or to avoid discomfort, regular charging of study devices, and encouraged daily use of devices. Participants who have no evidence of at least daily use for several days will be contact[CONTACT_138909]. Minimum expected wear time is at least [ADDRESS_157840] 3 days during this interval. • Clinic Visit 2 (~1.5 hours): examination of the ears by [CONTACT_138910], hearing assist software setting fine-tuning, Real Ear measures, and SIN objective hearing test • Home Interval 2 (14-22 days; begins on same day as Clinic Visit 2): fine-tuning of hearing aid settings during participant’s daily activities, regular charging of study devices, and encouraged daily use of devices. Participants who have no evidence of at least daily use for several days will be contact[CONTACT_138909]. Minimum expected wear time is at least [ADDRESS_157841] 14 days during this interval. • Clinic Visit 3 (~1-2 hours): examination of the ears by [CONTACT_138910], IOI-HA survey, Real Ear measures, SIN objective hearing test, and end of study items • Participants may be asked to complete additional study procedures due to unforeseen circumstances such as replacing study equipment due to loss, theft, or damage.  4.

Despi[INVESTIGATOR_138887], it is not possible to guarantee that COVID-19 will not be spread during the Study through the equipment provided to participants or at the Study site (as applicable).  4.6. Recruitment Timeline and Recruitment Method Recruitment for the study will begin prior to the first scheduled screening visit to allow adequate time to support screening throughput. Potential participants will be provided a general description of the study, basic study eligibility criteria, and the Study Staff’s contact [CONTACT_3031]. Interested participants will contact [CONTACT_138914].  
  
Page 20 of 36 4.7. Participant Enrollment Before any study specific procedures are performed, informed consent will be obtained from each potential study participant: Each participant who is screened for the research study will be assigned a unique participant identifier. Randomization: • Following the enrollment process, participants will be randomized into either SF or PF groups, so that approximately half of the useable datasets will derive from each group.  4.8. Participant Discontinuation A participant may voluntarily withdraw from the study for any reason, at any time. A participant may be discontinued from the study in any of the following circumstances: • Any adverse event (AE) that renders the participant ineligible or in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_14371] (PI), makes it not in the best interest of the participant to continue participation. • After enrollment, if a participant does not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the study (either newly developed or not previously recognized). • Protocol violation that renders data to be unusable or of questionable accuracy, in accordance with the Data Management and Quality Plan. • Lost-to-follow up; unable to contact [CONTACT_3445]. • Termination of the study by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_27362]. • Withdrawal of consent: a research participant may withdraw from participation for any reason at any time. • Loss of two study-provided devices (smartphone and/or wireless headphone(s) or case). • PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106]. A participant who develops active ear disease (e.g., otitis media; otitis externa; acute tinnitus), even if unilateral, may be withdrawn per PI [INVESTIGATOR_138888]. If a participant reports loud environmental sound exposure (e.g., concert; construction site; fireworks) during participation, this should be recorded as it may contextualize setting changes by [CONTACT_2299]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1461](s) will advise the discontinuation of any participant. Participants who discontinue or are discontinued should be compensated for the study visits they have completed, according to the compensation information in the Informed Consent Form (ICF). In the event of a participant withdrawal, coded participant data that was previously recorded may be retained and used in accordance with the protocol and ICF. Participants who withdraw from the study must return certain study equipment and materials. The reason for participant withdrawal from the study will be documented in the relevant tracking database(s). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1461](s) will inform the participant of the reason for withdrawal, as well as recommend steps for seeking additional care from their physician, when applicable. 
  
Page [ADDRESS_157844] the participant after 3 failed attempts for study assessments. Participants who do not complete study visits during the assessment windows will be handled on a case-by-case basis. The following actions will be taken if a participant fails to respond to the Study Staff to schedule a required study visit: • The Study Staff will attempt to contact [CONTACT_2299], reschedule the missed visit, counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule, and ascertain if the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study. • Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1461](s) will make reasonable effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, telephone calls/emails). These contact [CONTACT_138915](s). • Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow-up. 4.10. Participant Operational Definitions  A Screened Participant is one who has signed an ICF.

 7. Participant Safety   7.1. Anticipated Risks to Participants Participants may have risks or discomforts while in this study. Precautions will be taken to minimize risks, and the participant will be encouraged to talk to the Study Staff if he/she experiences any injuries, side effects, or discomfort during this study. Potential risks and discomforts may include: • Previously unknown hearing loss: Participants may experience symptoms of stress and anxiety related to objective finding of hearing loss. They will have access to the study Audiologist who can address frequently asked questions. • Discomfort or injury with ear exam and ear wax removal: Clinic visits include examination of the ears by [CONTACT_138917]. Some participants may experience discomfort with ear exams. Removal of ear wax is 

  
Page [ADDRESS_157846] potential risks of eardrum perforation, a laceration in the ear canal, dizziness, and/or inability to remove ear wax.  • Discomfort with headphone wear: Some participants may find it uncomfortable to wear the wireless headphones in Home Interval 1 and in Home Interval 2. If comfort prohibits a participant from this wireless headphone wear, they will be withdrawn from the study. • Loss of confidentiality due to study data breach: To minimize this risk, the Study Staff will adhere to rigorous standards to protect the data. All data collected from participants will be coded and separated from any directly identifiable information (DII). Although the Study Staff will take precautions to protect the participant’s identity, such as keepi[INVESTIGATOR_138889] a secure location with restricted access and removing information traditionally used to identify participants when their study data is shared, we cannot guarantee that their identity will never become known to the Study Sponsor. It is possible that there could be unauthorized access to, or security breaches of, the systems used to store information, and there may be other privacy risks that are not foreseen. • Loss of confidentiality related to storing health data on an app: Participants will be reminded not to share their mobile device login information with others and receive training on best practices on preventing the infiltration of DII into the study app. Only the Study Staff will have access to the primary study crosswalk. • Provided device configuration changes: Participants may make changes to the provided smartphone, either intentionally or inadvertently, that compromises the ability of the study software to function properly. The Study Staff will be available to handle usability issues participants experience during the course of their participation. If the Study Staff notice a gap in the data, they may attempt to contact [CONTACT_138918](s). • Discomfort associated with being asked personal questions about health history and the completion of questionnaires: (Infrequent likelihood of risk) Any participant who becomes distressed while completing questionnaires will be encouraged to seek clarification of any questions that he/she find to be unclear or troubling. The participant may skip any question which he/she finds distressing and will be told that he/she do not have to tell us why he/she are not answering question(s). 7.2. Study Risk Assessment  The devices utilized in this study do not meet the definition of an SR device under 21 CFR 812.3(m) included in device Section 5.1. Therefore, this study can be classified as a Non-Significant Risk device study. 7.3. Adverse Events  7.3.1. Adverse Event Definitions  Adverse Event (AE) Any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the study procedures. 
  
Page 26 of 36 An AE can therefore be any clinically significant sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the study procedures, whether or not considered related to the study procedures. Any abnormal laboratory findings, abnormal safety assessments, or anticipated day-to-day fluctuations which are associated with a pre-existing disease or condition, are not considered an AE, unless judged by [CONTACT_115511]. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE that is fatal, life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability, requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage, or results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Any SAE, including death, due to any cause (related or unrelated to the study or a study device) will be documented on the AE form and will be reported immediately (within 24 hours of learning of the event) by [CONTACT_138919]. 7.3.2. Categorization of Adverse Events  The severity of an AE will be categorized as follows: Mild: The event is transient, easily tolerated by [CONTACT_2299], and does not affect the participant’s daily activities. Moderate: The event causes the participant discomfort and interrupts the participant’s usual daily activities. May require treatment but not extended hospi[INVESTIGATOR_138890]. Severe: The event is incapacitating, causing inability to do work or usual activities; signs and symptoms may require medical evaluation and/or treatment, and may require additional prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  7.3.3. Causal Relationship Assessment  The assessment of causal relationship to study procedures is required for the purposes of reporting AEs. When determining the relationship of study procedures to an AE, to promote consistency, the following guidelines should be taken into consideration, along with good clinical and scientific judgment: The relationship of each AE to study procedure(s) will be assessed using the following categories: 
  
Page 27 of 36 Probably Related: There is a strong temporal relationship to the study or device, and an alternative etiology for the AE is unlikely. Possibly Related: The event is not readily explained by [CONTACT_2299]’s medical condition, concomitant therapy, or other causes, and there is a plausible temporal relationship between the event and participation in study procedures. Probably Not Related: An event for which an alternative explanation is more likely (e.g., concomitant medications or ongoing medical conditions) or the temporal relationship to study procedures and/or exposure suggests that a causal relationship is unlikely. Not Related: An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from participating in study procedures and/or that can reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_1604], such as underlying diseases, complications, concomitant drugs, and concurrent treatments.  7.3.4. Anticipated Adverse Device Effects  There are no Anticipated Adverse Device Effects from the provided smartphone or wireless headphones.  The following occurrences are not to be regarded as AEs: • Hearing symptoms or diseases (including tinnitus) • Cerumen impaction • Abnormal audiogram findings • Complaint about smartphone or comfort of headphones • Discomfort or injury with ear exams and/or with removal of ear wax • Study app functionality issues  7.3.5. Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects  An Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect is defined as any serious adverse device effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by [CONTACT_138920], severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan (including the protocol, the ICF, the PI’s brochure, or other study-related documents). 7.4. Reporting  7.4.1. Adverse Events  Throughout the entire study period, once participants have signed the ICF, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or designee(s) will evaluate participants at each study visit, record all AEs (whether or not they are considered to be related to the study procedures), and determine if any AEs are device- or study-related. Signs and symptoms of each AE should be described in detail and include approximate onset time and date, approximate offset time and date, description of event, severity, relationship to study procedures, action taken, outcome, 
  
Page 28 of 36 and (if applicable) the PI’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_138891]. AEs will be collected as reported by [CONTACT_138921]. All AEs will be documented on the AE form and will be reported within [ADDRESS_157847] (IRB).  7.4.2. Serious Adverse Events  The IRB will be notified of SAEs as soon as possible and according to current applicable regulations and specific IRB requirements, but in no event later than [ADDRESS_157848] learns of the event. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_138892] a separate SAE reporting form, in addition to the information in the source documentation. The site study staff should report all SAEs to the Sponsor as soon as possible but no later than 24 hours of becoming aware of the event.  7.4.3. Pregnancy Pregnancy is not reported as an AE and is not an exclusion event even if pregnancy is reported while enrolled in the study. 7.4.4. Follow-up  A participant experiencing an AE will be monitored until the symptoms subside, resolve, or stabilize to a pre-existing condition; the PI [INVESTIGATOR_138893]-up is not necessary; or the participant is lost to follow-up. In the event a participant does not return to a study visit, the outcome of this event will be recorded as lost at follow up. A participant experiencing an SAE will be monitored until there is a resolution for the symptoms; permanent outcome of the event; or the PI [INVESTIGATOR_138893]-up is not necessary. The timelines and procedure for follow-up reports are the same as those for the initial AE report. 7.4.5. Actions Taken  Action taken will be defined as: • None; • Study procedures interrupted; • Study procedures stopped. 7.4.6. Outcomes  Outcome will be defined as: • Resolved; • Ongoing or stabilized and followed by [CONTACT_138922]; • Lost to follow up. 
  
Page 29 of 36 7.5. Safety Assessment Plan  The Study Staff are responsible for the ongoing safety and well-being of the participants while they are enrolled in the study. In the case of an emergency, the local 911 system will be activated. The management of all medical complications that arise during the course of each study visit will be managed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1461](s), as deemed appropriate. In addition: • The Study Staff will be trained to identify potential AEs and follow-up immediately with participants. • AE information will be collected and documented at every time point. • PI [INVESTIGATOR_1461](s) will follow-up with participants and/or refer participants to their primary care provider, as necessary. • Participants who are diagnosed with tinnitus during their participation in the study may be withdrawn per PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106]. 8. Device Handling and Management Plan  Both subjective and objective data will be acquired from several instruments for this study. Participant data will be confidentially acquired and managed at all times throughout the study. All data will be collected and maintained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_138894](s) and secured against unauthorized access and stored in a secure, access-controlled location Each participant screened will be assigned a unique participant ID at the time of consent. The unique participant IDs will be associated with study data for all data storage, transfer, processing, analyses, and presentation by [CONTACT_1034]. An encrypted primary list of participant names with their respective IDs (cross-walk) will be maintained by [CONTACT_138923] [INVESTIGATOR_138894](s). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_138894](s) will have access to the cross-walk for the purposes of contact[CONTACT_138924] (e.g. the occurrence of incidental findings) or administrative tasks. Additionally, all signed ICFs will be stored in a secure, access-controlled location.  All collected data types are outlined in Section 8.1. 8.1. Data Types  Data types to be collected as part of the study include: 8.1.1. Contact/Demographic Data  Contact [CONTACT_3031] (name, phone number, physical address, and email address) and demographic information will be collected as a part of recruitment and screening. Select Study Staff (PI [INVESTIGATOR_138894](s)) will use participant names and email addresses to execute administrative tasks, such as scheduling and troubleshooting. Only those Study Staff who require access to such contact [CONTACT_138925]. Each participant screened will be assigned a unique participant ID number at the time of consent, which will not be based on any information about the individual. The unique, single-use identifiers will be associated with study data for all data processing, analysis and presentation. An encrypted primary list of participant names and contact [CONTACT_2997], with their participant IDs, will be kept on a secure server that is accessible only by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_138894](s). The PI 
  
[CONTACT_3490] [ADDRESS_157849] for the purposes of contact[CONTACT_138924] (e.g. with the occurrence of incidental findings or poor adherence to procedures). Participant names or other DII will be stored securely on a data server separate from the coded data. 8.1.2. Study App Data  Study app data is focused on participant fitting including estimated wear time and settings changes during the home intervals.   8.1.3. Sensitive/Other Health Information  Health information collected during this study may include ear exam findings (otoscopy, tympanometry), hearing ability assessment (PTA, bone conduction audiometry, SIN, software enabled hearing test results), device settings (as tuned by [CONTACT_138926]/or audiologist and as assessed by [CONTACT_138927]), and questionnaires/self-assessment about hearing experience. All collected data, regardless of collection method, will be stored on a secure server or cloud-based solution. 8.1.4. Data Collected Outside of the Study App  [IP_ADDRESS]. Otoscopy Findings A healthcare provider will assess general ear health at the Screening Visit by [CONTACT_138928], and record findings.  [IP_ADDRESS]. Tympanometry A healthcare provider will oversee tympanometry at the Clinic Visit #[ADDRESS_157850] result classification and any relevant comments.  [IP_ADDRESS].

Page 31 of 36    8.2. Data Collection, Storage, and Transfer  Data will be assessed for completeness and format by [CONTACT_138929]/queries on the database. This will enable the Study Staff to ensure proper functionality and connectivity of the study devices and general participant compliance with study procedures. Any issues, if observed, will be communicated to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_138895]. If necessary, appropriate corrective actions will be taken. 8.3. Study Record Retention  All data collected or derived from this research study will remain the property of the Sponsor. Participant contact [CONTACT_138930] a participant asks for it to be removed. All other collected study data will be retained in coded form for [ADDRESS_157854], data, and documentation and completion. Quality control (QC) procedures will be implemented as follows: Informed Consent: The Study Staff will review both the documentation of the consenting process as well as a percentage of the completed consent documents. This review will evaluate compliance with GCP (Good Clinical Practices), accuracy, and completeness. Source Documents and the Electronic Data: Data will be initially captured either in the study app and uploaded via phone network/Wi-Fi or documented by [CONTACT_138931] a study-specific computer. To ensure accuracy, study site staff will compare a representative sample of source data against the database, targeting key data points in that review. Protocol Deviations: The Study Staff will review protocol deviations on an ongoing basis and will implement corrective actions when the quantity or nature of deviations are deemed to be at a level of concern. 9. Statistical Methods  9.1. Statistical Hypothesis The primary endpoint hypothesis for the clinical validation study is as follows:  H0: Mean(IOI-HAPro-Fit) - Mean(IOI-HASelf-Fit) > 3 H1: Mean(IOI-HAPro-Fit) - Mean(IOI-HASelf-Fit) < 3  where Mean(IOI-HAPro-Fit) and Mean(IOI-HASelf-Fit) are the average follow-up (i.e., clinic visit 3) total IOI-HA scores for the Pro-Fit and Self-Fit groups, respectively. 
  
Page 32 of 36  9.2. Data Analysis In general, descriptive statistics (e.g., N, Mean, Std. Dev., Min, Max) for continuous data types and frequencies for categorical data types will be displayed.  All analyses will be performed with SAS and/or R . Analysis results will be presented separately for each of the two randomized groups and overall as appropriate.  Subject accountability (number of enrolled, withdrawn (and reasons), and complete), demographic and baseline characteristics (i.e., age, sex at birth, race, ethnicity, height, weight, BMI, etc.) and medical history will all be summarized using the Full Analysis Set.  Baseline ear measures (i.e., PTA, bone conduction, and  tympanometry) will be summarized separately for each ear.  All adverse events will be summarized in terms of event type, severity, and relationship to device/study procedures. Serious adverse events will also be summarized. The overall incidence (number of study participants and number of events) will be presented as both frequency counts and percentages.  Details of the efficacy analyses including the primary endpoint and additional exploratory analyses are presented below.  The full analysis set will be used as the pi[INVESTIGATOR_138896].  The methodology and missing data mechanism assumptions will be described in the study Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The null hypothesis, H0, will be rejected and the Self-Fit group will be considered non-inferior to the Pro-Fit group if the one-sided p-value for this test is p<0.025 or equivalently, if the one-sided upper 97.5% confidence bound for the difference (Pro-Fit – Self-Fit) of the two group means is no more than 3. The primary endpoint analysis will also be performed on the Per Protocol and Complete Cases Analysis Sets as supportive analyses.  To assess the exploratory objectives, the Speech in Noise (SIN) test scores will be summarized descriptively for each assessment visit (baseline and final) for each of the two randomized groups (Self-Fit and Pro-Fit) along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the means based on the t-distribution. Additionally, a two-sided 95% confidence interval for the mean difference between groups of the within-subject differences will be reported. For the real ear measures testing, the REM output values (dB SPL) will be summarized descriptively from all available ears at each frequency and averaged across all frequencies separately for each of the two study arms (Self-Fit and Pro-Fit).  The mean absolute difference (MAD) between the Self-Fit and NAL-NL2 targets and the MAD between the Pro-Fit and NAL-NL2 targets will also be computed at each frequency and averaged across all frequencies using all available ears.   9.3. Participant Population for Analysis Full Analysis Set: All subjects who sign informed consent, meet eligibility criteria, and are enrolled and randomized into the study. This analysis set will be used for the primary endpoint analysis and to summarize subject accountability, demographic and baseline characteristics, and adverse event data. Subjects in this analysis set will be analyzed “as randomized”.   Per Protocol Analysis Set: All subjects who meet predetermined data usability criteria and who do not have any major protocol deviations that would necessitate exclusion from analysis. Subjects in this 
  
Page 33 of 36 analysis set will be analyzed “as treated”. This analysis set will be used as a supportive analysis of the primary endpoint.  Complete Cases Analysis Set:  All subjects who have complete data for the efficacy endpoints of IOI-HA, QuickSIN, or Real Ear Measures.     9.4. Sample Size Determination The approach to sample size determination is based on a two-sample independent t-test comparing group means assuming equal variances between groups. a total of N=112 (56 per group) will be enrolled in this study.  9.5. Randomization and Blinding Eligible subjects will be randomized (1:1) to either the Self-Fit or the Pro-Fit groups using a single pre-determined block randomization schedule. The randomization will not incorporate any pre-stratification. Subjects will not be blinded to their randomly assigned group.  Additional details of the randomization schedule (e.g., block size, etc.) may be found in the study Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  9.6. Significance Level The primary hypothesis tests will use a one-sided significance level of 0.025. Analyses of the exploratory objectives will use 95% confidence intervals. Multiple comparison corrections will not be used.  9.7. Interim Analyses There are no interim analyses planned for this study. 10. Ethical Considerations  10.1. Ethical Review and Approval Before the study (including participant screening) commences, this research study will be submitted to a duly constituted IRB for ethical review and approval.

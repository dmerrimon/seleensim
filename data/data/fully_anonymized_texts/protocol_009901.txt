sign if nonparametric test is desired), with a one -sided type I error 
rate (α) of 0.025.  A sample size of [ADDRESS_1226787] ages to be enr olled.  Statistical power for a sample 
size of 60 exceeds 99 %. 
 
The primary hypotheses of this study are:  
H0: Mean intra -operative blood loss = 31 mL 
HA: Mean intra -operative blood loss < 31 mL  
 
The performance goal of 31 mL  derives from a meta -analysis 
comparing modern technology to conventional techniques (i.e. 
electrocautery and cold steel) (Alexiou et al . 2011).  This paper 
included a total of [ADDRESS_1226788]™ is 
expected to be low. The expected mean value for the BiZact™ device 
is a conservative estimate derived from data for LigaSure™ and other 
vessel sealing systems in the  Alexiou meta -analysis. The expected 
standard deviation is the average of the standard deviation values for 
all studies that reported blood loss in the meta -analysis.   
 
Expected mean for BiZact™: [ADDRESS_1226789] deviation: 15.1 mL  
 Additionally, descriptive statistics for blood loss will be reported for different age groups (ages 2 -5 and ages 6-12 ) as well as for different 
sites, surgeons, and countries.  
 Secondary endpoints will be evaluated with descriptive statistics. For continuous variables, the mean, median, and standard deviation will be reported, along with a 95% confidence interval for the mean 
wher e appropriate.  
 
For categorical data, proportions will be reported, along with 95% 
confidence intervals where appropriate.  
  
  
BiZact™ Pediatric Clinical Study Protocol    
MDT17024BZP  Version  5.0 (18 MAR 2019)  Page [ADDRESS_1226790] frequently performed otorhinolaryngologic procedures. Aside from 
the conventional technique of cold steel and electrocautery dissection, the introduction of numerous energy based tools a nd techniques allow s for the simultaneous dissection and sealing of vessels, 
potentially improving safety and reducing the complications of the procedure (1 -3). Generally thought 
of as safe and effective, energy based devices such as laser, Shaw scalpel, electrosurgical devices 
(needle, scissor, or knife), radiofrequency needle ablation device, thermal welding, and Coblator ™, use 
heat energy to denature protein, leading to vascular tamponade and hemostasis (arrest of bleeding). Unfortunately, a by[CONTACT_878062], which can damage adjacent structures, delay wound healing, increase post -operative pain, and 
increase the subject’s time to return to normal diet and activity (4).  
 
In order to address these concerns, Medtronic has developed BiZact™, a bipolar  electrosurgical 
instrument intended for use in open surgical procedures, such as tonsillectomies, where ligation and 
division of vessels, tissue bundles,  and lymphatics is desired. BiZact ™ is designed as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_878043] (RF) sealer/dissector for use with vessels up to and including 3mm. Compatible with the 
already in use Valleylab™ (LS10 , FT10, ForceTriad ™) energy platform s, BiZact™ employs bipolar 
electrosurgical RF energy and pressure to ligate vessels interposed between its jaws which can then be transected using the built -in knife deployed by [CONTACT_878063]. Based off of Ligasure™ technology, 
bipolar electrosurgical devices have demonstrated utility for  tonsillectomy pr ocedures, providing 
hemostasis while minimizing postoperative pain (5, 6 , 8, 9 ).  
 
4.1.2. BiZact
TM Device  
Animal model studies have found BiZact™ to be able to  achieve hemostasis and minimize lateral 
thermal spread potentially resulting in reduced post -operative pain. Details of preclinical testing  can be 
found within the BiZact™  instructions for use ( IFU) and in the Investigator’s Brochure. Additionally , the 
performance of the BiZactTM device is also being evaluated in an adult tonsillectomy pi[INVESTIGATOR_878044]  (Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]) .   
 
4.2. Purpose 
The purpose of this study is t o assess safety and performance of the BiZact ™ device  in tonsillectomy 
procedures in children .  Sixty ( 60) pediatric subjects (ages 2-12 inclusive) will be  treated for 
tonsillectomy with BiZact™ enrolled at a minimum of  2 clinical sites across the [LOCATION_003]  with enrollment and 
completion of the tonsillectomy procedure with the study device  not to exceed 36 subjects per site. 
The study will be considered a success if the mean intra -operative blood loss is less than the mean 
intra -operative blood loss associated with conventional tonsillectomy in a large meta -analysis (7) . At 
the conclusion of the study, data will be submitted to the FDA for  consideration for  a pedia tric 
indication and for publication.

Patient Diary during the return to clinic on day 28 ( +7). Please see section [ADDRESS_1226794]™ (BZ4212) on a pediatric population, 
Medtronic is performing a prospective, multi -center, single arm study of BiZact™ on children  (2-12 
years of age at the time of the procedure, inclusive) undergoing tonsillec tomy. Intra -operative blood 
loss will be assessed as well as p ost-operative pain and other quality of life aspects for 28  (+7) days 
following the procedure. Pre -clinical testing has found BiZact™ to satisfactorily  achieve hemostasis and 
currently a multice nter adult tonsillectomy study is underway in the US and Europe. As a study with no 
comparator, this study does not utilize any randomization or blinding. The BiZact™ device will only be 
used during the course of the tonsillectomy procedure and subjects wi ll be followed for 28 (+7) days to 
monitor bleeding, pain and return to normal diet and activity. If any adverse events are identified they 
will be assessed, reported and documented  in the eCRF .

which may be considered as source. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_166657](s) must ensure the accuracy and completeness of the recorded  data and then provide his/her electronic signature [CONTACT_878094].  The Investigator’s electronic signature [CONTACT_878095] .  Changes to data previously submitted to  the 
sponsor will require a new electronic signature [CONTACT_3265] [CONTACT_197086]/approve the 
changes.  
 
9.9. Deviation Handling  
A study deviation is an event where the Investigator or site personnel did not conduct the clinical study according to the Clin ical Investigational Plan or Clinical Investigation Agreement. The Investigator is not 
allowed to deviate from the above-mentioned documents except under emergency circumstances to protect the rights, safety and well -being of human subjects.  
No changes to the protocol will be permitted without the written approval from Medtronic, the IRB/EC and applicable Competent Authority. The investigator must notify Medtronic and the reviewing IRB/EC 
of any deviation from the Investigational Plan when specific to the p rotection of the life or physical 
well-being of a subject in an emergency. The deviation will be recorded in the eCRF and s uch notice 
must be given as soon as possible, but in no event later than five ( 5) working days after the emergency 
has occurred. Exce pt in such an emergency, prior written approval by [CONTACT_878076]. If these changes or deviations affect the scientific soundness of the Plan or the rights, safety, or welfare of human subjects the IRB/EC w ill also be notified. All other deviations 
will be reported per the site’s IRB/EC standard operating procedures. Should any deviations from the 
Investigational Plan occur, these will be reviewed by [CONTACT_878077] t o the protocol . Repetitive or serious investigator compliance issues may result in the need 
to initiate a corrective action plan, and in some cases , freeze enrolment or ultimately terminate the 
Investigator’s participation in the clinical study.

If any M edtronic representative discovers that an investigator is not complying with the signed 
Investigator Agreement, the investigational plan, applicable laws, or any conditions of approval imposed by [CONTACT_3488]/EC, they  will report to the clinical study  manager  and take such steps 
necessary to promptly secure compliance.  If compliance cannot be secured, device shipments to the investigator may be discontinued and the investigator’s participation in the investigation terminated. Medtronic  shall also require such an investigator to dispose of or return the device, unless this action 
would jeopardize the rights, safety, or welfare of a subject.  
 
9.10. Subject Status 
9.10.1. Screened Subjects  
Subjects who are being evaluated for eligibility in the study are considered scr eened or being screen ed. 
 
9.10.2. Screen Failures  
Subjects who se LAR(s)  provide study consent, but then are determined to be ineligible  to participate 
prior to the procedure will be considered screening failures and will not require additional study follow-up visits. The reason for the screening failure will be clearly delineated on the applicable CRFs.  If a 
subject is being screened to p articipate and the cohort closes during the screening period (see section 
9.10.1), the subject should be withdrawn by [CONTACT_093], and he/she will not receive the  surgery 
with the device . 
 
9.10.3. Enrolled Subjects  
A subject is considered enrolled in the study when the subject ’s LAR  signs the consent. Data will not be 
captured  until the  subject is determined to be eligible  and the tonsillectomy has begun (Day 0).  As 
soon as the tonsillectomy surgical procedure has begun  and the BiZact
TM device has been in contact 
[CONTACT_1155],  the subject must be followed. Subjects who are enrolled, but discontinue the study 
for any reason prior to the start of the tonsillectomy procedure  or usage of the study device, will not be 
followed unless  they  are later able to complete the tonsillectomy , See section [ADDRESS_1226820] enrollment for the study, nor towards the site enrollment 
maximum ( 36). In all subject cases where the device was in contact [CONTACT_878078]- to-treat (ITT)  population.  The per -protocol population will consist of subjects in the ITT 
population that did not have a major protocol deviation.  
9.10.4. Subject Withdrawal or Discontinuation  
Subjects for whom consent  has been obtained and are deemed eligible, but later consent is withdrawn 
will be withdrawn from the study , and their enrollment will not count toward the study enrollment, nor 
the maximum site enrollment ( 36).  In the event the subject /subject’s LAR withdraws consent , the date 
of withdrawal will be documented.   
 
Subjects whose tonsillectomy has been rescheduled, but still wish to participate may participate if the dates of consent and screening are within 30 days of the new planned tonsillectomy date. If  the new 
tonsillectomy date is more than 30 days after date of screening and/or consent , subjects / LAR(s) who 
wish to participate should be re- consented and re -screened. In this circumstance, this would be 
considered a new subject, and the previous consen t and screening materials will be considered as a 
“withdrawn” subject .

maximum number of subjects per site or the total of sixty (60) subjects for the final analysis  (section 
13.3 Analysis Population) .  Only procedures where the investigational medical device  has come in 
contact [CONTACT_878079] (see section s 9.10.3 and 13.3  ITT 
population) .  If the tonsillectomy procedure has begun, but the investigational device is  not used (e.g. 
generator failure), the subject will be removed from the study, and the reason will be document, including any device deficiencies.  
 The reason for study exit will be documented on the applicable electronic case report form (eCRF).  If 
the Study Investigator voluntarily removes a subject from further study participation  prior to the 
surgery , supporting documentation must be in place for the rationale and date of removal. Follow-up 
of subjects withdrawn or discontinued after the surgical procedure will be determined by [CONTACT_7995] , but 
will respect the rights and wishes of the subject . Every attempt will be made to contact [CONTACT_878080].  Subjects will be considered lost to follow -up once the 
following steps have been taken:  
• Two phone calls should be made to the subject/LAR(s) .  Each attempt should be clearly 
documented in the source documents and the response or lack thereof should be captured.   
• If there is no response to the phone calls, then an official, certified letter should be written to 
the subject / LAR(s) .  A copy of the letter and return or delivery receipts should be retained in 
the subject’s source document.  
• Additionally, the site should attempt to reach out to the primary care practitioner to determine the status of the subject and document this in the eCRF . 
• When all due diligence attempts to contact [CONTACT_232413], after a period of two (2) weeks, the subject will be considered Lost to Follow -up.  The Sponsor should be notified and the End 
of Stud y (EOS) form should be completed.   
 
9.11. Selection of Investigators  
Surgeons who are qualified by [CONTACT_45437] (board certified in otolaryngology in accordance with USand hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48799]), education, and relevant experience appropriate to the use of the product and 
associated procedures will be considered for participation as investigators in this study. 
Investigators/sites must have adequate time and resources to conduct the study throughout the duration of the study and have access to an adequate number  of eligible subjects. Investigators/sites 
must be able to comply with applicable Institutional Review Board (IRB) and regulatory requirements. 
Investigator must  not be debarred, disqualified, or working under sanctions in applicable regions. 
Qualifications are verified through valid CV and current licensing and maintained with study documentation.   
   
 
 
BiZact™ Pediatric Clinical Study Protocol    
MDT17024BZP  Version  5.0 (18 MAR 2019)  Page [ADDRESS_1226822] tonsillectomy procedure include but are not limited to: 
reaction to anesthesia, swelling, bleeding, infection  (including fever), nausea, vomiting,  dehydration, 
velopharyngeal incompetence, and pain.    
The potential risks associated with BiZact™ include: unintended cutting , bruising, tearing,  thermal 
burns,  or other damage to tissue, arcing, pi[INVESTIGATOR_38633], inadequate/no seal, pain, bleeding, nausea, 
vomiting, and headache. There is also a risk of electroma gnetic interference if the patient has an 
implantable electronic device. 
 In the event of unacceptable bleeding, investigators may use alternate means to achieve acceptable 
hemostasis, just as they would in a typi[INVESTIGATOR_878050]. Subjects in th e study will be given 
instruction as to what to do in the event of post -operative bleeding in order to minimize an y adverse 
effects.  
 
The risk analysis is based on the operation of BiZact™ by [CONTACT_21724].  The overall residual risk 
after design risk  mitigation strategies and/or design control was deemed acceptable for the BiZact™ 
system.  
 The instructions for use (IFU) provide instructions  on proper use of the device along with warnings and 
precautions to mitigate risk  of misuse  and notify the surgeon of potential risks . Surgeons will undergo 
training on the device prior to participation in the study.   
 Reproductive and developmental toxicology studies in animals to evaluate the potential for AEs on reproductive ability and effects on the embryo/fetus have not been conducted.  As with any device, 
there is always a risk of a rare or previously unknown side effect developi[INVESTIGATOR_878051] . 
 
10.2. Potential Benefits  
The potential benefits associated with BiZact™ device usage include, but are not limited to: reduction in pain , blood loss,  time to return to normal diet, and activity post tonsillectomy procedure  as compared 
to conventional tonsillectomy; however , there may be no benefits at all . 
 
10.3. Risk Benefit Rationa le 
Post -operative pain and delayed time to normal diet and activity are common challenges after 
tonsillectomy procedures. Aside from conventional cold steel and electrocautery dissection, the 
introduction of numerous energy based tools and techniques allow  for the simultaneous dissection and 
sealing of vessels significantly improving safety and reducing the complications of the procedure (1-3). 
In most cases however, these energy based devices use heat to establish hemostasis (arrest of bleeding), which can  lead to lateral heating and damage to adjacent structures delaying wound healing 
and increasing post-operative pain  (4). Thus, the use of the investigational medical  device for

Medtronic Confidential  
This document is electronically controlled   056-F275, v3.0 Clinical Investigation Plan Template tonsillectomy presents a similar risk profile and minimal if any increase in risk over other commonly 
used devices.  
 A positive risk/benefit ratio has been demonstrated with BiZact™ as evidenced by [CONTACT_232414],  and a multicenter adult tonsillectomy is currently underway. T here were no 
apparent adverse systemic or local effects in any of the preclinical studies  using animal models . BiZact™ 
is based off Ligasure™ technology which historically has been shown to be safe and effective for 
tonsillectomy procedures providing adequate hemostasis (arrest of bleed ing) while minimizing 
postoperative pain.  
 
The product design, as well as the results of internal studies, support BiZact™ as a class 2 FDA  cleared 
for use in adult patients. It is CE -mark and Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) Licensed product  
for use  in adult and pediatric patients . There are currently no known interactions between the BiZact™ 
device and concurrent medical interventions.  
11. Adverse Events and Device Deficiencies  
 
Adverse event (AE) definitions used in this study are based on ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011 (Clinical Investigation of 
Medical Devices for Human Subjects -- Good Clinical Practice).   
 All AEs and Device Deficiencies will be collected and documented a and  Day 0 (after c ommencement of 
surgery with BiZact™  to 28 (+7) days follow-up . Device Deficiencies not related to an adverse event 
(e.g. damaged out of the box) will be collected from when they are first noticed, regardless of usage in a case . 
 
11.1. Definitions and Classificat ions  
11.1.1. Adverse Event (AE)  
In alignment with ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011 (Section 3.2), an Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or other persons, whether or not relat ed to the investigational medical device.  
 This definition includes events related to the investigational medical device  and the procedures 
involved. For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to investigational medical  devices.  
 Adverse Events may include but are not limited to  bleeding, tissue injury, and t hermal  burns.  
 
For study purposes, the following occurrences are considered to be expected observations following 
surgical procedures (primarily associated with anesthesia) and will not be considered reportable AEs, as long as the event is not associated with significant sequelae, does not prolong hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and responds to standard medical therapy:  
• Postoperative transient nausea determined to be procedure related within the first 24 postoperative hours.  
• Postoperative transient emesis determined to be procedure related within the first [ADDRESS_1226823]™ Pediatric Clinical Study Protocol    
MDT17024BZP  Version  5.0 (18 MAR 2019)  Page 31 of 47  
 
Medtronic Confidential  
This document is electronically controlled   056-F275, v3.0 Clinical Investigation Plan Template • Postoperative constipation, determined to be procedure and/or medication related for the 
duration of medication administration for management of pain.  
• Postoperative pain that the Investigator considers common and within normal limits for the 
procedure and is well -managed with medication.  Pain that the Investigator considers outside 
normal, or is not well- man aged with medication, as well as pain that severe (score 7 or higher) 
and ongoing at the end of the study will be captured as an adverse event.  
 Additionally, the following should not be considered an AE:  
• A condition requiring a preplanned procedure unless  the condition worsened since enrollment  
• A preexisting condition found as a result of screening, unless the condition has worsened since enrollment. 
All responses to the above events that require treatment beyond the institution’s standard procedures 
will be reported as AEs.  
 
All AEs observed during the course of this study, regardless of severity or relationship to the device will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. Adverse events regar dless of relatedness will be treated per 
standard of care at each institution. For example, the management of pain or bleeding will be at the 
discretion of the treating physician, as he or she is monitoring the patient’s condition.  
 
11.1.2. Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
In alignment with ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011 (Section 3.37), a serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE that has:  
• led to death,  
• led to serious deterioration in the health of the subject that either resulted in  
o a life-threatening illness or injury, or  
o a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or  
o in-patient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or  
o medical or surgical intervention to prevent life threatening illness or injury or 
permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function, or  
• led to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
NOTE: Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre-existing condition or a procedure required by [CONTACT_5745], without serious deterioration in health, is not considered an SAE.  
 
11.1.3. Adverse Device Effect (ADE)  
In alignment with ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011 (Section 3.1), an Adverse Device Effect is an adverse event related to the use of an investigational medical device.  
 This definition includes adverse events resulting from insufficient or inade quate instructions for use, 
deployment, implantation, installation, or operation, or any malfunction of the investigational medical 
device. 
 This definition includes any event resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the investigational medic al device.  
 
Adverse Device Effects will be reported by [CONTACT_737](s). If escalation is required  (due to the 
potential need for reporting) ADEs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_232416] . Both confirmed and

This document is electronically controlled   056-F275, v3.0 Clinical Investigation Plan Template possible device related events will be included in the study report. ADE(s) may be anticipated or 
unanticipated (UADE).  
 
Examples of adverse device effects include but are not limited to: unintended cutting, unintended electrical path, or arc ing.  
 
11.1.4. Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE)  
In alignmen t with ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011 (Section 3.36), a Serious Adverse Device Effect is an adverse device 
effect that has resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event.  
 
11.1.5. Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect ([LOCATION_003]DE)  
In alignment with  ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011 (Section 3.42), an Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect is a 
serious adverse device effect which by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity, or outcome has not been identified in the current version of the risk analysis report.  
 NOTE: Anticipated serious adverse device effect (ASADE) is an effect which by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity or outcome has been identified in the risk analysis report . 
 
11.1.6. Adverse Event Severity Classification  
Severity w ill be d efined according to the  follow ing criteria: 
Mild Awareness of event, but ea sily tolerated 
Moderate Discomfort enough to cause some interferen ce with activities of 
daily living (ADL) 
Severe Incapacitating, with an inab ility to perform ADL 
Death  Death related to AE  
An AE can be cla ssified a s severe and not deemed an SAE . Similar ly, an SAE is not a utom atically severe 
in nature. 
 
11.1.7. Adverse Event Relationship Classification  
Causality assessments define the relationship between the use of the medical device (including the medical -surgical  procedure) and the occurrence of each adverse event, according to MEDDEV 
(Guidelines on Medical Devices, Clinical Investigations: Serious Adverse Event Reporting). The presence 
of confounding factors, such as concomitant medication/treatment, the natural history of the 
underlying disease, other concurrent illness or risk factors shall also be considered.  
 
Each AE will be classified according to five different levels of causality. The sponsor and the 
investigators will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the serious adverse event to 
the investigational medical device or procedures: 
Not related:  relationship to the device or procedures can be excluded when:  
1. the event is not a known side effect of the product category the device belong s to or of similar 
devices and procedures  
2. the event has no temporal relationship with the use of the device or the procedures; 
3. the serious event does not follow a known response pattern to the medical device (if the response pattern is previously known) an d is biologically implausible;

activation/exposure - when clinically feasible – and reintroduction of its use (or increase of the 
level of activation/exposure), do not impact on the serious event;  
5. the event involves a body- site or an organ not expected to be affected by [CONTACT_10398];  
6. the serious event can be attributed to another cause (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/ clinical condition, an effect of another device, drug, treatment or other risk factors); 
7. the event does not depend on a false result given by [CONTACT_132621], when applicable;  
8. harms to the subject are not clearly due to use error;  
9. In order to establish the non -relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be met at the 
same time, depending on the type of device/procedures and the serious event. 
 
Unlikely : the relationship with the use of the device seems not relevant and/or the event can be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_5748], but additional information may be obtained.  
Possible :  the relationship with the use of the device is weak but cannot be ruled out completely. 
Alternative causes are also possible (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/ clinical condition or/and an effect of another device, drug or treatment). Cases were relatedness cannot be assessed or no 
information has been obtained should also be classified as possible.  
Probable :  the relationship with the use of the device seems relevant and/or the event can not be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_5748], but additional information may be obtained.  
Causal relationship: the serious event is associated with the device or with procedures beyond 
reasonable doubt when:  
1. the event is a known side effect of the product category the device belongs to or of similar devices and procedures;  
2. the event has a temporal relationship with device use/application or procedures;  
3. the event involves a body- site or organ that  
a. the device or procedures are applied to; 
b. the device or procedures have an effect on;  
4. the serious event follows a known response pattern to the medical device (if the response pattern is previously known);  
5. the discontinuation of medical device application (or reduction of the level of activation/exposure) and reintroduction of its use (or increase of the level of activation/exposure), impact on the serious event (when clinically feasible);  
6. other possible causes (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/ clinical condition or/and an effect of another device, drug or treatment) have been adequately ruled out;  
7. harm to the subject is due to error in use;  
8. the event depends on a false result given by [CONTACT_132621], when applicable;  
9. In order to establish the relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might  be met at the same 
time, depending on the type of device/procedures and the serious event.  
 
The Sponsor and the Investigators will distinguish between the serious adverse events related to the 
device and those related to the procedures (any procedure spec ific to the clinical investigation). An 
adverse event can be related both to procedures and the device. Complications of procedures are considered not related if the said procedures would have been applied to the subjects also in the absence of device use/ application.

This document is electronically controlled   056-F275, v3.0 Clinical Investigation Plan Template  
In some particular cases , the event may be not adequately assessed because information is insufficient 
or contradictory and/or the data cannot be verified or supplemented. The sponsor and the Investigators will make the maximum effort to define and categorize the event and avoid these situations. Where the sponsor remains uncertain about classifying the serious event, it should not exclude the relatedness and classify the event as “possible”.   
Particular attention shall be given to the causal ity evaluation of unanticipated serious adverse (device) 
events. The occurrence of unanticipated events related to the use of the device ([LOCATION_003]DE) could suggest 
that the clinical investigation places subjects at increased risk of harm than was to be expected beforehand.  
 
11.1.8. Adverse Event Outcome Classification  
Outcome  of the eve nt will be  defined according  to the following: 
• Fatal : This event is d etermine d to be  the cause of dea th.  
• Not Recovering/Not Resolved : The event has retained p athologica l conditions resulting fr om the  
prior dis ease or injury. 
• Recovered/Resol ved: The eve nt has fully resolve d at the  end of the study. 
• Recovering/Resolving : The event is on going at the  end of  the study. 
• Unknown: The event has been unclassified at the end of the study.  
 
11.2. Reporting of Adverse Events  
The following events are generally considered reportable during the course of this study and should be reported to the sponsor:  
• any ADE, SADE, SAE, or [LOCATION_003]DE  
• any Device Deficiency that might have led to an SADE if  
o suitable action had not been taken or  
o intervention had not been made or  
o circumstances had been less fortunate  
• new findings/updates in relation to already reported events.  
 Events will be reviewed by [CONTACT_878081]/ECs.

This document is electronically controlled   056-F275, v3.0 Clinical Investigation Plan Template 11.3. Adverse Event Recording  
All observed adverse events (ADEs, UADEs and SAEs) will be collected and documented at the time of 
surgery   to 28 (+7) days follow-up. If the adverse event is recorded at the last subject visit  and 
considered serious and device -related, the event should  be followed for resolution for up to seven (7 ) 
days, or until the resolution of the event, whichever is earliest, even if this falls outside the 28 (+7) day 
visit window. To ensure consistency of data collection no new events will be recorded after the 28 (+ 7) 
day visit window, even if the subject is being followed for resolution of another event.  If the adverse 
event is ongoing at the end of the study, and exceeds the follow up time frame, the patient will continue to receive standard care with their normal physician, and the event will be listed as ongoing.  
 Assessment of the occurrence of an AE will be based on changes in the subject’s physical examination, laboratory results and/or signs and symptoms. Adverse events will be monitored until a subject 
comple tes the study unless the Investigator determines the event is related to the device, in which case 
they will be monitored until resolution if possible. Medical care will be provided, as defined in the 
informed consent, for any AE related to study participa tion. Adverse events will be collected on an AE 
eCRF and applicable source documentation. To the extent possible, the event to be recorded and reported is the event diagnosis as opposed to event symptoms (e.g., fever, chills, nausea and vomiting in 
the presence of a clinically diagnosed infection is to be reported as infection only). For the purposes of 
this protocol, only those AEs occurring after enrollment  and the commencement of the tonsillectomy 
with the study device will be recorded.

MDT17024BZP  Version  5.0 (18 MAR 2019)  Page [ADDRESS_1226828]™ device deficiencies will be documented on the Device Malfunction eCRF and the device 
should be returned to Medtronic for analysis, if possible. Instructions for returning the device will be 
provided.  Device deficiencies should also be documented in the subject’s medical record.  
 
Device deficiencies are NOT to be reported as AEs.  However, if there is an AE that results from a devic e 
deficiency, that specific event would be recorded on the eCRF.  
 
12. Data Review Committees  
 There will be no use of data review committees in this study.  Instead, a steering committee and a safety review committee will monitor the trial’s progress including  trends of data over time and 
scientific relevance of the data collected. Please see section 15.10. These groups will provide oversight 
in terms of scientific validity and the safe conduct of the study.  
 
By [CONTACT_6073],  this study’s focus is about the amount of  intraoperative bleeding, which is expected to be 
low due to the nature of the procedure and the currently available date. Additionally, this is  a study of 
3 sites and 60 subjects, with no planned interim analysis, and as such , has a l ower burden in terms of 
severity of implications, and degree of data review and analysis compared to  a larger study with interim 
data review needs  or a study focusing on severe complications or mortality. Per FDA guidance (OMB 
Control No 0910-0581 “The Establishment and Operat ion of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees 
for Clinical Trial Sponsors” DMCs are “generally recommended for any controlled trial of any size that 
will compare rates of mortality or major morbidity,  but a DMC is not required or recommended for 
most cl inical studies.” The guidance goes on to list conditions wherein a DMC may offer additional 
protections to study participants. Apart from the use in pediatric population, this study does not meet any of the criteria listed wherein a DMC would provide added benefit. Even within this population, the 
study is small and of short planned duration,  so it is unlikely that a DMC would be able to provide 
added or more rapid benefit than the steering committee or safety review mechanisms.  
   
13. Statistical Design and Me thods  
 
13.1. Statistical Test Methods  
Continuous variables will be summarized using counts, means, standard deviations, medians, minimum 
and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized using frequencies and percentages. Changes to 
the planned statistical analysis as defined in the protocol will be documented in the statistical analysis plan and clinical study report.  
13.2. Sample Size Determination  
The analysis technique will be a [ADDRESS_1226829] (or Wilcoxon ranked sign if nonparametric test is 
desired), with a one-sided type I error rate (α) of 0.025.  A sample size of [ADDRESS_1226830] ages to be enrolled.  Statistical power for a sample size of 60 subjects exceeds 99%.

Medtronic Confidential  
This document is electronically controlled   056-F275, v3.0 Clinical Investigation Plan Template 13.3. Analysis Population  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all enrolled subjects in the study who have undergone 
tonsillectomy and had contact [CONTACT_878084]™ device. The endpoint analyses based on the ITT 
population will be considered the principal analyses.    
The per -protocol (PP) population will consist of all patients in the ITT population who do not have a major 
protocol violation. Analyses on the PP population  will provide supporting evidence to the primary results.  
 
13.4. Statistical Analysis Endpoints  
13.4.1. Primary Endpoint  
The primary hypotheses of this study are:  
H0: Mean intra -operative blood loss = 31 mL  
HA: Mean intra -operative blood loss < [ADDRESS_1226831], with a one -sided type I error rate (α) of 0.025.  If intra -
operative blood loss data appear to be non -normally distributed (as evidenced by p < 0.[ADDRESS_1226832]), a Wilcoxon signed rank test will also be conducted.  
 
The performance goal of 31 mL derives from a meta -analysi s comparing modern technology -assisted  to 
conventional tonsillectomy (i.e. electrocautery and cold steel) (7).  This paper included a total of 3,[ADDRESS_1226833]™ is expected to be low. The expected mean 
value for the BiZact™ device is a conservative estimate derived from data for LigaSure™ and other 
vessel sealing systems in the Alexiou meta -analysis (7). The expected standard deviation is the average 
of the standard deviation values for all studies that reported blood loss in the meta -analysis.   
Expected mean intra -operative blood loss for BiZact™: [ADDRESS_1226834] deviation: 15.1 mL  
 Additionally, descriptive statistics for blood loss will be repo rted for different age groups (ages 2 -5 and 
ages 6-12) as well as for different sites, surgeons, and countries.  
 
13.4.2. Secondary Endpoint  
Secondary endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics. In addition, 95% confidence intervals will be provided, unless otherwise noted. For continuous variables, the mean, median, and 
standard deviation will be reported.  For categorical data, proportions will be reported. No hypothesis 
tests are planned  
 
13.5. Statistical Analysis of Safety Endpoints  
The safety endpoints will be analyzed using the ITT population. Proportions of the following events will 
be reported for the study:  
• Post -operative hemorrhage

Medtronic Confidential  
This document is electronically controlled   056-F275, v3.0 Clinical Investigation Plan Template o Any primary ( ≦24 h ours ) requiring medical intervention and/or secondary ( >24 hours ) 
bleeding requiring medical inter vention (e.g., cautery, admission for observation, or re -
operation)  
• Post -operative readmission  
• Evidence of glossopharyngeal nerve damage as diagnosed by [CONTACT_878085] (e.g., prolonged pain or difficulty swallowing)  
• Localized Infection  
o Infection confined to a single organ or tissue 
• Other serious device -related adverse events  
 
13.6. Handling of Missing Data 
No data imputation will be performed for missing data.  All practical monitoring and follow -up steps 
will be taken to ensure complete and accurate data collection. Since primary endpoints are assessed intra -operatively, it is anticipated that there will be minimal missing data for these endpoints.  
 
13.7. Interim Analysis  
Currently no interim analysis is planned for this study. Should th e need arise for an interim analysis , the 
protocol will be revised, and statistical plan will be updated accordingly.  Periodic data extractions may 
need to occur in order to provide ongoing feedback for regulatory purposes (e.g. for annual reports), to prepare information for periodic reviews of safety information (e.g. counts of adverse events) or to assist in the ongoing internal review of data to ensure consistency and validity of data. This is considered part of ongoing study management activities, and the endpoints of the study will not be 
formally analyzed.  
 
13.8.  Poolability of Results  
Poolability of blood loss data will be assessed for each of the participating investigational sites.  
Descriptive statistics will be reported separately by [CONTACT_3725].  A one -way ANOVA will test whether there is 
evidence of a difference in mean blood loss between sites.  If this test does not suggest a difference (p-
value  ≥ 0.15), data will be pooled across sites for inference (i.e., for the primary hypothesis test and 
95% confidence interval for mean blood loss).  If there is evidence of a difference (p < 0.[ADDRESS_1226835] ANOVA), confidence  intervals will be presented separately for each site, and p-values from the 
hypothesis test in Section 8.4.1 will also be calculated separately for each site.   For full details on the 
planned analysis and poolability, see Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
 
14. Ethics  
 
14.1. Statement(s) of Compliance  
This clinical investigation will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their 
origin in the Declaration of Helsinki,  and any regional or national regulations such as FDA regulations 
(US),  and ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011 (except conditions specifically excluded as adverse events in Section 11.1.1)  
as appropriate. All principles of the Declaration of Helsinki have been implemented in this clinical study by [CONTACT_232421], IRB/EC approval, clinical study training, clinical 
study registration, publication policy.

Additionally, the results of this study will be offered for publication at the conclusion of the study, if 
participating investigators believe the data warrants publication i n an appropriate journal.  
 
 
15. Study Administration  
 
15.1. Monitoring  
Site visits will be conducted by [CONTACT_232422], conduct site initiation, ensure compliance, assess informed consent process, monitor study data, 
subjects’ medical records, eCRFs, device accountability, device use and storage, IRB/EC submissions, regulatory binder in accordance with current protocol, applicable regulations and standards,  and the 
respective local and national regulations and guidelines (if applicable). The Study Investigator and the investigating site will permit authorized clinical research personnel and clinical monitors from Medtronic or contracted by [CONTACT_878086], IRB/EC decisions, and Investigator and clinical site records at regular intervals throughout the study as well as permit study -related 
monitoring, audits, EC/IRB review, and regulatory inspection(s) by [CONTACT_169293]/documents. Additionally, subject charts and clinical records will be requested and reviewed so 
that protocol adherence and source documentation can be verified. In instances where data protection regulations prohibit the direct examination of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_232384](s), the Investigator will cooperate in a system of source data verification with the Sponsor.  Monitoring may be performed with in person visits or remotely, when applicable.  
 To ensure the rights, safety, and welfare of study subjects are being maintained, the monitor wi ll 
maintain assurance that all study staff are trained on the study protocol and use of the investigational medical  devices.  If the monitor discovers that an investigator is not complying with the signed 
Investigator Agreement, the investigational plan, a pplicable laws, or any conditions of approval 
imposed by [CONTACT_3488]/EC, the monitor will report to the Sponsor and take such steps necessary to promptly secure compliance.  If compliance cannot be secured, device shipments to the investigator may be  discontinued and the investigator’s participation in the investigation terminated. The monitor 
shall also require such an investigator to dispose of or return the device, unless this action would jeopardize the rights, safety, or welfare of a subject.  
 
15.2. Data Management  
Visual and/or computer data review will be performed to identify possible data discrepancies.  In regions where applicable, the investigator will clearly mark or provide a sign/data within clinical record 
to indicate that the subject is enrol led in this clinical investigation. Where copi[INVESTIGATOR_878052], these shall be signed and dated by a member of the investigation site team with a statement that it  is a true

BiZact™ Pediatric Clinical Study Protocol    
MDT17024BZP  Version  5.0 (18 MAR 2019)  Page [ADDRESS_1226837] Retention  
The investigator and the sponsor will maintain the records of the study including all pertinent 
correspondence, the study protocol with any/all amendments, all correspondence with and approval 
from the IRB/EC, the clinical trial agreement, the Investigator Agreement, device accountability records, individual subject records, and signed informed consent forms. Subject files, other source data 
and essential documentation kept in the Investigator study files, must be kept for a period of no less than 2 years after the latter of the following two dates: the date on which this investigation is 
terminated or completed, or the date that the records are no longer required for purposes of 
supporting a premarket application ; Medtronic will also  retain the study records according to 
Medtronic policy, whichever prevailing policy or regulation may be longer. Records may need to be maintained by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_8178] a longer duration if national regulations require or if agreed to in writing with Medtronic. All data and documents should be made available if requested by [CONTACT_878087].  
 
15.8. Publication and Use of Information  
The Medtronic Publication a nd Authorship Policy is aligned with the International Committee of 
Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) recommendations (www.icmje.org). Medtronic will seek to publish, in 
appropriate peer -reviewed journals and scientific conferences, results of clinical studies where human 
subjects are involved, regardless of outcome. While study results are owned by [CONTACT_13735], all data on 
which a publication is based will be made available to all authors as required for their participation in the publication process. Furthermore, data may be published or used by [CONTACT_878088], the Medtronic Publication and 
Authorship Policy, and the Clinical Investigation Agreement. Investigators must submit a copy  of all 
manuscripts and/or abstracts to Medtronic for review and comment 30 days prior to planned 
submission. Medtronic acknowledges that its right to review and comment shall relate solely to the proprietary, licensing, and/or confidential rights Medtronic may have in such proposed publication, rather than whether such results and/or opi[INVESTIGATOR_232386].  
 The publication of post -hoc analyses, regional results, or single -center experiences based on 
multicenter clinical studies should not pre cede that of the primary multicenter publication, and should 
cite the primary publication whenever possible, as required by [CONTACT_232425].  
 Medtronic involvement in a publication (e.g., funding of the study; sponsor of  the study; collection, 
analysis, and interpretation of data; professional writing assistance) must be disclosed according to journal -specific policies, submission requirements, and prevailing editorial standards, in addition to 
those specified by [CONTACT_231016]. Authors must ensure that an 
acknowledgement/disclosure statement is included in the body of the manuscript for Medtronic to 
review for accuracy. All authors must also disclose financial or personal affiliations t hat could be 
considered conflicts of interest as per journal/conference requirements.  
 To enable health care providers, payers, and subjects access to the wealth of Medtronic’s research, 
Medtronic will report its scientific data in accordance with the prin ciples outlined in the Guidance 
Document on Registration and Reporting Results of Company -Sponsored Clinical Trials Under FDAAA 
2007 (Title VIII).

15.9. Suspension or Early Termination  
Medtronic or appropriate regulatory authorities reserve the right to suspend or discontinue the study 
at any stage, with written notice to all investigators, all institutions, all reviewing IRBs (US), any investigator(s) in communication with the EC ( Australia) , all subjects and subjects’ personal physicians 
and any applica ble regulatory agencies. Similarly, investigators may withdraw from the study at any 
time, subject to providing written notification to Medtronic [ADDRESS_1226838] -certified otolaryngology surgeon that is not affiliated with an investigative  center.  
 
Throughout the course of the study and d uring the review of adverse events, the Independent Medical 
Monitor will be blinded to the investigational site  and Investigator(s)  and shall make decisions about 
relatedness, severity, etc. independent of  Medtronic personnel.  Adverse events will be provided to the 
independent medical monitor, at minimum, on a monthly basis to adjudicate.  
 In alignment with current Medtronic safety policies, the most conservative assessment of the event 
between the site inv estigator and the medical monitor will be document ed and acted upon  as 
appropriate ( i.e. if the medical monitor evaluates an event as not related but the site has considered 
the event possibly related, the event will remain categorized as possibly related), and reported as such  
both internally to the internal safety data review committee, to post -market vigilance, and to external 
agencies as needed .  
 The medical monitor may be contact[CONTACT_878089].  
 
15.10.2.  Steering Committee  
The Steering Committee will consist of Investigators participating in this study, as well as relevant members of Medtronic Clinical and Medical Affairs  in supportive roles . As noted, investigators for the 
studies are  qualified as part of site qualification procedures  and are board -certified otolaryngology 
surgeons . The role of the Steering Committee is to make recommendations on the design and conduct 
of the study, the analysis of data, and the communication of results in alignment with the Medtronic 
Publication and Authorship Policy. The Steering Committee will als o be presented with aggregate 
adverse event data  during typi[INVESTIGATOR_878053] , as described in the Steering 
Committee Charter ; this review will aid in the interpretation of the meaning of the collective data  and 
BiZact™ Pediatric Clinical Study Protocol    
MDT17024BZP  Version  5.0 (18 MAR 2019)  Page [ADDRESS_1226839] and definitions  if additional clarity is needed (e. g. definition of a 
type of adverse event for consistency across study sites).  Because this committee is comprised of 
investigators from the study, it will not be considered fully impartial, but can make recommendations 
to the internal safety review team and the internal study team.  
 
15.10.3.  Internal Safety Data Review  
Internal safety data reviews will consist of a  representative of the safety team (registered nurs e), an 
internally employed Medtronic physicia n, a statistician, the project manager or designee as 
representative from the study, a member of clinical research leadership for research decision escalation and support as well as representative of quality or post -market vigilance reviews.  The 
independe nt medical monitor may be consulted if there is a need for clarification of event reviews, for 
additional expertise is needed for decision making around the conduct of the study, or for additional 
interpretation of aggregated adverse event information .  
 
The function of this group  will be to review  safety trends on a periodic basis during the study, as well as 
any trends or events on an ad hoc basis (e .g. should any unexpected events occur), to monitor subject 
safety, and to provide guidance regarding the continued safety of enrolled subjects. These meetings 
are held at least on a quarterly basis during study enrollment, but are also more frequent if necessary (e.g. due to more rapid enrollment ), and conducted as urgently  as possible in the event of an 
unex pected frequency or type of adverse event.   As this team will have the access to aggregate 
information on the severity, relatedness, and expectedness of adverse events for the overall study, and between study sites, a s well as post -market vigilance data  for the product where it is commercially 
available, this team will have the necessary data and the ultimate responsibility to make decisions regarding holding enrollment at a site or for  the entire study or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/terminating a study site or the 
entire stu dy. The procedure by [CONTACT_878090], is detailed in the Clinical Safety Management and Potential Complaint Plan.

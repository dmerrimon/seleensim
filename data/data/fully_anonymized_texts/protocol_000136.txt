Background and Significance  
During pregnancy, women often experience musculoskeletal pain, specifically in their low back 
and/or pelvic girdle. Pelvic girdle pain (PGP) is defined as pain between the posterior iliac crest 
and gluteal fold, particularly in the region of the sacroiliac joint (SIJ)1. Although it is often 
referred to as “sciatica”. PGP in pregnancy is common with prevalence estimates of 45%2. 
Previous studies have found that one third of patients will rate their PGP intensity as severe, leading to functional impairments. Functional disabilities include sitting, walking, and standing; 
thus, significantly impacting the ability of patients to perform routine daily activities. This pain 
has been reported to develop as early as 17-19 weeks’ gestation, lasting up to 3 months 
postpartum; with a peak incidence of 24-[ADDRESS_146630] found benefit in short term use (3-6 weeks) of maternity belts, 
providing women with improved pain and functi on compared to exercise or no intervention7. 
Pelvic belts are a cost-effective option to treating PGP, and more specifically SIJ pain, yet studies are limited regarding the effect they have on SIJ mobility and pain reduction
[ADDRESS_146631] originally des cribed by [CONTACT_129828] (cite). 
Anecdotally, our clinical team has observed that women who benefit from compression during 
the second part of the test, seem to benefit most from the use of an SIJ belt. Having a simple 
test for obstetric providers to perform in pregnant women with pain would be informative in determining who might benefit most from an SIJ belt. Hence our study seeks to investigate the 
following aims:   
 
Study Aims:   
Aim 1.  To determine if the Active Straight Leg Raise (ASLR) severity score is immediately 
reduced by [CONTACT_38658] a sacroiliac (S IJ) belt in women with PGP during pregnancy 
Hypothesis : The application of an SIJ belt will reduce the score of the ASLR by 2 points. 
 
Aim 2.  To determine if the initial ASLR score change predicts pain reduction with use of an SIJ 
belt in women with PGP during pregnancy Hypothesis:  PGP NRS score will be reduced by 2 points. 
 
Study Design: a prospective observational cohort study.

Study Procedures: 
 
Patients will be approached in their second or third trimester regarding the study in the 
Obstetrics or Rehabilitation clinics if they have PGP. If interested in participating, they will either proceed to study visit 1 (baseline), if time permits, or set up a separate time for study visit [ADDRESS_146632]. This study will require 2 study visits total, study visit 1 will be at the time of consent, study 
visit 2 will be 4 weeks after baseline. Study duration is 4 weeks per patient. At study visit 1, patients will undergo a physical examination of the external musculoskeletal pelvis and will 
complete the NRS for ‘worst pain’ and ‘mean pain’ during the latest [ADDRESS_146633] medical history, 
activity level and restrictions and disability as measured by [CONTACT_129829] 
(PGQ).   
Standard physical examination maneuvers validated for the assessment of pregnancy related 
PGP will be performed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Fitzgerald and include pelvic pain provocation tests and functional stability testing. It will be noted with each maneuver whether the test was positive or 
negative. They will include: 
 
a. Patrick’s Faber test :  With the patient in supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], the patient’s leg is flexed, abducted and 
externally rotated so that the heel rests on the opposite kneecap. This test is positive with 
production of pain in the sacroiliac joint.  
b. Posterior Pelvic Pain Provocation (P4) test: with the patient supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], the femur is flexed to be 
perpendicular with the table at [ADDRESS_146634] is positive when the 
 
 
 5 
patient experiences pain in the gluteal region of that leg.  
c. Long Dorsal Sacroiliac Ligament (LDL) palpation test : The subject lies on her side with slight 
flexion in both hip and knee  joints. Specifically, the LDL is palpated directly caudomedially from 
the posterior iliac spi[INVESTIGATOR_129820]’s  hand, it is recorded as pain. If the pain 
disappears within five seconds, it is  recorded as tenderness. When the identical pain is felt 
directly in the vicinity, but outside the borders of the ligament, the test is not deemed as positive.  
d. Pubic Symphysis palpation test : Examiners will palpate the subject’s pubic symphysis joint 
while the patient is lying supi[INVESTIGATOR_129821]. If palpation  causes pain that persists five 
seconds after removal of the examiner’s  hand, it is recorded as pain. If the pain disappears 
within five seconds, it is  recorded as tenderness. 
e. Modified Trendelenburg’s test : The standing woman stands on one leg and flexes the other at 
90° (hip and knee). The test is considered positive if pain is experienced in the symphysis.  f. Active Straight Leg Raise (ASLR)  test: performed with the patient supi[INVESTIGATOR_129822] 20 cm apart.  The patient raises each leg one at a time 20 cm above the table without bending the knee.  A) The test is positive when the patient describes a heaviness 
or difficulty in performing the task.  B) In the second part of the maneuver, posterior compression is applied and the patient is then asked to actively perform a straight leg raise.  If 
there is greater ease in lifting the leg this is considered a positive test.  The patient will be asked 
to score impairment (scoring inadequacy to raise the legs but not pain) on a 6-point scale: not difficult at all = 0, minimally difficult = 1, somewhat difficult = 2, fairly difficult = 3, very difficult = 
4, unable to do = 5, the scores of both sides will be added so that the summed score can range 
from 0-10. Impairment is considered severe if the summed bilateral score is at least 4.   
Personal Health Information to be collected:   The personal health information (PHI) items 
that will be collected during pregnancy will includ e:  name, phone number; date of birth; BMI; 
 
 
 6 
height; age; race; education level; income level; number of previous pregnancies; number of 
previous deliveries; types of previous deliveries, past abdominal surgeries if any, current 
medications; history of other pain diagnoses, hi story of depression; history of neurological 
disease; history of anxiety; history of sexual abuse; previous low back injury; previous low back 
or pelvic pain; history of smoking; history of infertility; history of urinary or fecal incontinence; 
history of interstitial cystitis; history of arthritic conditions (osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis,

Consent process 
Patients will be identified when they arrive for a scheduled MD appointment at any point during 
their second or third trimester. If the patient meets eligibility criteria, a consent form will be read to them describing the nature of the study and potential associated minimal risks and benefits.  
They will be informed that neither participation nor refusal will influence the care received at 
Loyola University Medical Center. They will be asked a few questions afterwards to verify comprehension and then sign the consent form documenting their agreement to participate.  A 
copy of the consent form will be given to them.  Participation is completely voluntary and they 
may discontinue participation in the study at any time.  Patients will complete the informed 
consent process at study visit 1.  A study coordinator (Mary Tulke) or the PI ([CONTACT_129833]) will 
consent all patients. The patients who consent to participate will be given a set of questionnaires at that time and asked to complete them during study visit 1. Consenting patients 
will undergo systematic examination procedures. These procedures will be performed by [CONTACT_978]. 
Patients will receive free SIJ belts.

Follow-up 
All patients will be asked to participate in a study visit 2 follow-up in person. Questionnaires 
(NRS, pain diagram, PGII, PGQ and personal health history information along with estimated 
belt wear time and other pain interventions (Physical therapy, medications, ice, heat) will be collected. Only one repeat physical examination maneuver the ASLR will be done.  
Adverse event reporting: 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_129823]. [CONTACT_129834], 
division chief Loyola Maternal Fetal Medicine will also be available for any patient adverse 
reactions. If any unanticipated adverse event occurs, this will also be immediately reported to the IRB. 
Confidentiality 
Following HIPPA guidelines, patient identifiable data will be coded to protect each patient’s identity.  The data obtained from the patients wi ll be entered onto electronic forms and imported 
into a REDCap database. We are familiar with using this technology from other studies. It is efficient to complete in a clinical setting and minimizes data entry errors. The data will be 
presented in peer reviewed manuscripts and other public presentations at the group level only. 
No individual patients will be identified.

Sample size; 
 
In this study, patients will complete a baseline active straight leg rise (ASLR) evaluation, which is a functioning assessment performed on each leg using a scale from 0 to 5.  For this 
assessment, the summed score for both legs will be recorded where higher values indicate 
greater impairment.  Patients who receive a summ ed value of 2 or higher will continue in the 
study and will receive belt therapy for 4 weeks (described above).  At the end of these [ADDRESS_146636] the null hypothesis that the mean difference (or 
change) in patients’ active straight leg rise score from baseline to [ADDRESS_146637] this null hypothesis and assumes that the population from which the sample 
will be drawn has a mean decline of 2.0 SLR points (with a standard deviation of 5.0 SLR 
points).  This observed value will be tested against the theoretical value (constant) of [ADDRESS_146638] completed the study. With the 
proposed sample size of 52 pairs (i.e., 52 patients with both a baseline and 4 week SLR measurement), the study will have power of 80.8% to yield a statistically significant result. This 
computation assumes the criterion for significance (alpha) has been set at 0.[ADDRESS_146639] would not be of clinical or substantive 
significance. 
 
Analysis In this study, the primary alternative hypothesis is that the mean difference in patients’ total 
straight leg rise (ASLR) score from baseline to [ADDRESS_146640] the hypothesis. 
 
Assuming the parametric assumptions of linearity, normality, and homogeneity are satisfied, this study will also use a linear mixed effects model to estimate the adjusted mean difference in 
ASLR after controlling for other important covariat es collected during this study.  For example, 
one goal will be to estimate the mean difference in ASLR score after controlling for patients’ age, BMI, past abdominal surgeries, and number of pr ior deliveries, all of which are known to 
affect active straight leg rise scores.  In this model, random intercepts will be allowed for each 
patient to account for their repeated ASLR scores (i.e., within subject correlation). 
 
Regarding the secondary aim, the alternative hypothesis is that any change in patients’ pain from baseline to 4 weeks is a function of their mean ASLR difference score.  For this aim, a 
linear mixed effects model will be used to estimate the mean change in pain for each one unit 
decrease in the ASLR change score.  As before, this model may control for other important covariates collected during the study, including  patients’ age, BMI, past abdominal surgeries, 
and number of prior deliveries.  Due to the use of repeated pain assessments as well as 
 
 
 [ADDRESS_146641] correlation. 
 All analyses will be completed by [CONTACT_129832] 9.4 (Cary, NC). 
 
Risks and Benefits: 
Fetal Risk and Benefit 
There is no benefit or risk in this study to the fetus aside from the potential long term 
benefit of better maternal pain control in the postpartum period that would influence maternal-child bonding and childcare.  
Maternal Risk and Benefit:  
 
The risk to the mother is also minimal. Mothers with moderate to severe pain have 
significant disability that affects current and future quality of life. The potential benefit of the pain 
treatment outweighs the minimal risk. All patients will be offered standard of care physical 
therapy (cost covered by [CONTACT_38279]), a proven treatment for pregnancy related pelvic girdle 
pain.  
The benefits of the intervention include the possibility of superior pain relief and 
improved mobility with use of SIJ belt. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or study physician will evaluate (1) The expected relationship of the event with the study intervention and (2) Whether 
any action should be taken regarding the study intervention following an adverse event.  
Anticipated findings and use of the data: 
The findings from this project may result in pain reduction and improved mobility in pregnant 
women   Subject compensation: 
Subjects will receive the SIJ belt free and parking sticker at follow-up visit.

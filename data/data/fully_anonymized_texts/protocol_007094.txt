2.0 STUDY SUMMARY
Name [CONTACT_790](s): 
Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.Compound: 
Vedolizumab IV
Title of Protocol: A Randomized, Double -Blind, 
Placebo -Controlled, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the 
Efficacy and Safety of Vedolizumab in the Prophylaxis of 
Intestinal Acute Graft -Versus -Host Disease in Subjec ts 
Undergoing Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell 
TransplantationEudraCT No.: 2018 -002141 -11
Study Number: Vedolizumab -3035 Phase: 3
Study Design:
This is a phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
vedolizumab compared to placebo as prophylaxis for intestinal acute graft -versus -host disease (aGvHD) in subjects
undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo -HSCT) for the treatment of hematological 
malignancies or myeloproliferative disorder . 
Subjects will be randomized into 2 arms at 1:1 ratio, vedolizumab v ersus placebo. Randomization will be stratified by
[CONTACT_654](≥18 years or adolescents aged 12 to <18 years ),human leukocyte antigen (HLA) match (8/8 or 7/8), conditioning 
regimen (myeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning), and with or without antithymocyte globulin (ATG) 
(antithy mocyte globulin -Fresenius [ATG -F] or thymoglobulin). Subjects will subsequently be followed and evaluated 
for development of intestinal aGvHD for the first [ADDRESS_1074192] day of cell infusio n, which will be Day 0. Pretransplant procedure days are designated with 
negative numbers (eg, Day -1), whereas posttransplant procedure days are designated with positive numbers (eg, Day 
+13).
The study  consists of a 30-day screening period, 155-day treatment period, and a follow -up period for safety 
assessments and survival for up to [ADDRESS_1074193]. Subjects randomized tothe vedolizumab treatment arm
will receive vedolizumab intravenously (IV) at a [ADDRESS_1074194] and then on Day +13, Day +41, Day +69, Day +97, Day +125, and Day +153. Subjects randomized in the 
placebo treatment arm will receive placebo IV on Day -1, Day +13, Day +41, Day +69, Day +97, Day +125, and 
Day +153.
The vedolizumab [ADDRESS_1074195] disease (GvHD) 
Vedolizumab-1015 phase 1b study, and the dose and schedule of vedolizumab in this study is similar to the approved 
dose and schedule of vedolizumab administered to subjects with ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease .
All subjects will receive a background GvHD prophylaxis regimen consisting of a combination of a calcineurin 
inhibito r (CNI, cyclosporine [CYS] or tacrolimus [TAC] ) with metho trexate (MTX) (Appendix B). ATG (ATG -F or 
thymoglobulin) may  be included in prophylaxis therapy per institutional practice and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 
may be used in place of MTX at the discretion of the investigator. TAC and CYS will be administered IV or orally 
during conditioning and subsequent dosing should be adjusted according to whole blood concentration and toxicity, 
per institutional practice. The recommend ed targeted whole blood concentration for CNI s and tapering schedule is 
provided (Appendix B).
Assessment of Intestinal aGvHD
Subjects will be followed and evaluated for development of intestinal aGvHD according to the Bone Marrow 
Transplant Clinical Trials Network modified International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry index summarized in 
Appendix F.

combinatio n CNI (CYS or TAC) and MTX (MMF may be used in place of MTX at the discretion of the investigator). 
When considered part of standard prophylactic treatment for GvHD, ATG (ATG -F or thymoglobulin) may be used at 
the discretion of the treating physician; however, the proportion of subjects receiving ATG shall comprise no more 
than approximately 25% of the total number of subjects enrol led into the study. 
At the time of allo -HSCT, eligible status of underlying disease stage (hematologic malignancy or myeloproliferative 
disorder), as defined on the basis of the specific malignancy, is as follows: 
a.for subjects with acute leukemia or chro nic myelogenous leukemia, no circulating blasts and <5% blasts in the 
bone marrow; 
b.for subjects with myelodysplasia, no circulating blasts and 10% blasts in the bone marrow; 
c.for subjects with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma, chemosensitive disease 
(partial response or complete response to last salvage therapy) at time of transplantation; 
d.for subjects with other non-Hodgkin lymphoma or Hodgkin lymphoma, a response to last salvage therapy or chemo -sensitive disease per institut ional guidelines; and 
e.for subjects with myelofibrosis and other myeloproliferative disorders, <5% blasts in the blood and bone marrow. 
Performance status must be assessed as 2 using Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status for
subjects aged ≥18 years at randomization or as ≥60% using the Karnofsky performance status for adolescent subjects
aged ≥16years at randomization and Lansky performance status foradolescent subjects aged 12 to <16 years at 
randomization.
Main Criteria for Exclusion:
Subjects who have received prior allogeneic transplants or who are planned to undergo umbilical cord blood 
transplant .
Subjects who are planned to receive ex vivo Tcell-depleted hematopoietic stem cells , in vivo T cell-depleting 
antibodies (wi th the exception of ATG -F or thymoglobulin), or posttransplant cyclophosphamide .
Subjects with anyactive cerebral/meningeal disease (including central nervous system involvement of the primary 
disease) or signs and symptoms of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) or any history of PML. 
Subjects who are planned to undergo allo -HSCT for a nonmalignant hematological disorder (eg, aplastic anemia, 
sickle cell anemia, thalassemias, Fanconi anemia or immunodeficiency ).
Subjects with clinically acti ve systemic infection during screening. 
Excluded Concomitant Medications:
Any therapy for GvHD prophylaxi s, including approved, investigational or Tcell-depleting agents other than ATG
(ATG-F or thymoglobulin), and other than that specified in the inclusion criteria .
Main Criteria for Evaluation and Analyses:
The primary endpoint for this study is intestinal aGvHD -free survival by [CONTACT_2006] 180in subjects after allo -HSCT for 
treatment of primary malignancy or myeloproliferative disorders. The study wil l also determine the number and 
percentage of subjects who experience tre atment -emergent adverse events or serious adverse events from the 
administration of the first dose of study drug through [ADDRESS_1074203] dose of study  drug . 
Secondary endpoints for this study are to determine: intestinal aGvHD -free,relapse -free ( of underlying malignancy)

4.0 INTRODUCTION
4.1 Background
4.1.1 Disease to be Treated
Allogeneic hematopoiet ic stem cell transplantation (allo -HSCT) i s an important and potentially
curative therapy  for m any hematol ogic malignancies, but its use is limited by  [CONTACT_781440] -versus -host di sease (GvHD) [1,2]. GvHD is a commo n complication of 
allo-HSCT and a major cause of morbidit y and mortalit y.Acute GvHD result s from the activatio n 
of alloreactive donor lymphocy tes by  [CONTACT_781441] y antigens on host antigen- present ing cells 
(APCs) [3,4].The risk o f GvHD and its severit y depends on several factors including recipi[INVESTIGATOR_781384], cell source, donor characterist ics, degree of histocompatibilit y between the donor and 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], the condit ioning regimen used, and the GvHD prophylaxis strategy used [1,5-7]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_781385], approximately 40% to 70% of all allo -HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (inclusive of pediatric 
and adult subjects) develop Grade 2 to 4 acute GvHD (aGvHD) [5,6,8-11]. Approximately 45% to 
56% of pediatric allo -HSCT (ranging from<1 to 20 years of age) from unrelated donors will 
develop Grade 2 to 4 a GvHD ,and nonrelapse morta lity (NRM) appears to be greater in those 
pediatric patien ts with intest inal invo lvement [12-14]. Classical aGvHD occurs around the time o f 
engraft ment (~[ADDRESS_1074218] infusio n) up to Day  100 [15] and late aGvHD occurs 
greater than [ADDRESS_1074219] [16,17] .
aGvHD most commo nly involves the skin, liver, and gut and results fro m an act ivation of 
alloreact ive donor lymphocy tes by  [CONTACT_781441] y antigens on host APCs [3,4]. 
Immunocom petent donor T cells migrate to lymphoid tissues soon after infusio n, recognize host 
alloant igens, and become activated upon interaction with host APCs [18]. Homing of these 
alloreact ive donor T cells to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which is dependent on the expressio n of 
the integrin α4β7 mo lecule on the donor T cells, is fundamental to th e pathogenesis o f intestinal 
aGvHD [19-21] . Data from the Center for International Blood & Marrow Transplant Research 
showed that 76% of Grade II to IV aGvHD cases in [ADDRESS_1074220] inal invo lvement [22]. 
Intestinal aGvHD is the most serious form and may be less responsive than liver and skin GvHD to 
first-line corticosteroids, and corticosteroid resistance develops in 73% of subjects with severe 
intestinal GvHD (stage 3- 4) [23,24] . 
Given the high level o f immunosuppressio n, the risk of opportunist ic infect ions is increased in 
subjects who develop intestinal aGvHD [25,26] and overall survival (OS) for stage 3 to 4 intestinal 
aGvHD has been reported as 25 in a study  from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center [24]. 
GvHD prophylaxis is emplo yed for all subjects undergoing allo -HSCT and routine prophylaxis 
commo nly consists of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) in combination with a short course 
methotrexate (MTX) or mycopheno late mo fetil (MMF) [6,8,9,11 ,27]. CNI (cyclo sporine [CYS] or

relapse [27]. 
Reducing the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_781391] n has the potent ial to 
improve overall outcomes in allo -HSCT and possibly  extend and/or save lives fro m this rare 
disease.
4.1.2 Vedolizumab IV
Vedolizumab (also called MLN0002) is a humanized immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal 
antibody  (mAb) di rected against the human lymphocy te integrin 4β7. The 4β7 integrin 
mediates lymphocy te trafficking to GI mucosa and gut- associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) 
through adhesive interaction wit h ant imucosal  addressin cell adhesio n mo lecule -1 (MAdCAM -1), 
which is expressed on the endothelium of mesenteric lymph nodes and GI mucosa [28-31] . 
Vedolizumab specifically binds the 4β7 integrin, select ively an tagonizing its adherence to 
MAdCAM -1 and as such, impairs the migration of gut homing leukocy tes into GI m ucosa. As a 
resul t, vedolizumab acts as a gut- selective immunomodulator [32]. Vedolizumab has been 
developed as a treatment for ulcerat ive colit is (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD), which are 
characterized by  [CONTACT_260219].
Vedolizumab IV ( also known as ENTYVIO; KYNTELES; Ved olizumab for Inject ion, for 
Intravenous Use; Vedo lizumab Powder for Concentrate for Solut ion for Infusion; or MLN0002 
IV) is a ly ophilized solid which after appropriate reconst itution and dilut ion is intended for 
intravenous (IV) infusio n that has been gra nted marketing approval in several regio ns, including 
the US and EU. Vedolizumab IV is approved for the treatment of adults with moderately to 
severely act ive UC or CD who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were 
intolerant to a tum or necrosis factor -alpha blocker or immuno modulator; or had an inadequate 
response with, were intolerant to, or demonstrated dependence on corticosteroids. The approved 
dosing and administration regimen foradults consists of 300 mg vedo lizumab infused IV o ver 
approximately  30minutes at Weeks 0, 2, and 6, then once every 8 weeks (Q8W) thereafter. 
Vedolizumab dosing every 4 weeks (Q4W) is also approved in most parts of the world. Previously 
conducted clinical studies in healthy subjects and subjects with UC and CD have characterized the 
efficacy , safety, tolerabili ty, pharmacokinet ic (PK), pharmacodynamic, and immunogenicit y of
vedo lizumab.
The ongoing clinical devel opment program ofvedolizumab IV includes clinical studies in 
pediatric subjects (aged 2 -17 years) with UC or CD that are summarized in the current edition of 
the invest igator’s brochure (IB).
[IP_ADDRESS] Nonclinical
Several published key nonclinical studi es support the use of vedo lizumab for the prevent ion of 
GvHD . Nonclinical pharmaco logy studies in murine models of aGvHD suggest that the prevent ion 
of Tcell trafficking to GALT, via interruption of the α4β7/MAdCAM- 1 interaction, may  prevent 
GvHD [33-35] .Ina mouse m odel of GvHD, when using donor cells sorted and purified based on

the presence or absence of α4β7, the absence of α4β7+ cells great ly delayed and re duced the 
presence of GvHD [19]. Like these results, α4β7 expressi on on donor Tcells has been shown to be 
important in the induct ion of GvHD [20].By [CONTACT_781442],
vedo lizumab may act to reduce the severit y and intensit y of intestinal GvHD. Extensive 
nonclinical evaluati ons of  the cardiovascular, acute, local, subchronic, chronic, immuno logic, and 
reproducti ve toxi city of vedolizumab in pharmacologically responsive species (New Zealand 
white rabbits and cyno molgus mo nkeys) have been conducted . Vedolizumab bound wi th similar 
affinit y to rabbit, m onkey , and human α4β7 integrin. 
Results fro m a 13- week toxicit y study  in juvenile cyno molgus mo nkeys ident ified 100 mg/kg 
(human equivalent dose 1920 mg in a 60- kg human) as the no -observed- adverse- effect l evel.
(NOAEL) . Inclusion of sexually  immature monkeys in the 3- and 6 -month toxicit y studiessupport 
administration of vedo lizumab in clinical studies with adolescent subjects (aged 12 years and 
greater ). 
Nonclinical studies also show that vedolizumab does not antagonize 4β1 integrin [3]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Human Experience
As of 19 May 2019, approximately  6376 subjects (healt hy or pati ents wi th UC or CD, pouchit is, 
melano ma, or undergoing allo- HSCT ) have received at least 1 dose of vedo lizumab across all 
studies in the clinical development program. As reported in the 9th development safet y update 
report (DSUR, for the period 20 May  2018 to 19May 2019), global cumulat ive postm arket ing 
patient exposure to vedolizumab IVis est imated to be approximately  336,[ADDRESS_1074226] been reported following vedo lizumab 
administration include: nasopharyngit is, bronchit is, uppe r respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], influenza, 
sinusit is, headache, oropharyngeal pain, cough, nausea, rash, pruritus, arthralgia, back pain, pain 
in extremit ies, py rexia , fatigue, and inject ion site reactions . Risks associ ated wi th vedolizumab 
treatm ent have b een i dentified and categorized. Important ident ified risks are hypersensit ivity 
reactions, incl uding infusio n-related reacti ons(IRRs) and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_781392], including 
nasopharyngit is, sinusi tis, bronchit is, and influenza . Most IRRs are mild/mod erate in intensit y and 
resolve wit h minimal or no intervent ion. Important potential  risks are infect ions, including 
gastrointestinal infect ions and systemic infections against which the gut constitutes a defensive 
barrier; serious infections, including opportuni stic infect ions such as progressive mult ifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML); malignancy; and liver injury . Reported serious infe ctions include 
tubercul osis, sepsis, Salmonella sepsis, Listeria meningit is, and cyto megalo viral colitis.
Most serious adverse events (SAEs) were related to exacerbat ions or complicat ions of the 
underlying UC or CD. Similar safety profiles for vedolizumab have been observed in subjects who 
received vedo lizumab IV Q4W or Q8W and in subjects following long -term Q4W treatment for up 
to 8 y ears, and in subjects administered vedolizumab subcutaneously  (SC) . Wit h the except ion of 
inject ion site reactions, the safet y profile for vedo lizumab SC is consistent with that for 
vedo lizumab IV.

tract i s a m ajor m echanism  for am plificat ion of systemic aGvHD [36] and several key similarities 
exist with intest inal aGvHD and other immune- mediated diseases like inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD). In IBD, the migrat ion of T cells to the GI tract appears to play important role in induct ion 
and perpetuation of GI inflammat ion. Once in the GI tract, the interaction between effec tor T cells 
and APCs result in downstream uncontrolled production of inflammatory  mediators as well as 
recrui tment and activat ion of addit ional leukocy tes resul ting in chroni c gut inflammat ion [37]. 
The migrat ion of naive donor T cells to the GALT where they are act ivated and migrat ion of 
activated donor T cells to the target tissues, especially the intestinal mucosa, are essent ial steps in 
aGvHD in both children and adults [4,38]. Intestinal aGvHD in chi ldren and adults is often 
involved in Grade [ADDRESS_1074232] profound effects on the morbidit y and m ortali ty of

(TAC MTX) in subjects undergo ing allo -HSCT. Vedo lizumab dose findin g was cohort -based and 
followed a rule-based dose- finding study design wit h PK guidance. After a tolerated dose with 
acceptable PK was identified, the cohort at that dose level was expanded to further assess the 
tolerabilit y and effect iveness o f vedo lizuma b. Dose escalat ion started with a low dose cohort of
vedolizumab 75 mg IV. With no dose-limit ing toxicit ies(DLTs) and no engraft ment failures in the 
75mg dose cohort, the next cohort received vedo lizumab 300 mg IV . A total  of 3 subjects were 
enrolled in the 75 mg dose cohort and 21 subjects were enrolled in the 300 mg dose cohort .The 
300-mg dose cohort consisted of adult subjects for who m a myeloablat ive condit ioning or RIC 
regimen was planned and who were candidates for HLA- matched or 1 -locus (antigen or allele) 
mismatched unrelated or related donor allo -HSCT (using either peripheral blood stem cells or 
bone marrow as the cell source) for treatment of hematologic malignancy or myelopro liferat ive 
neopl asm.No subject in either cohort experienced a DLT and all subjects engrafted (median time 
to neutrophil engraft ment was 22 days in the vedo lizumab 75 mg dose cohort and 14 days in the 
vedo lizumab 300 mg dose cohort). The PK of [ADDRESS_1074235] population was 
similar to that of subjects with IBD and provides serum concentrations above 10 µg/m L up to Day 
100. The study  resul ts dem onstrate l ess than expected intest inal aGvHD events and less than 
expected Grade 3 -4 aGvHD events in the 300 mg dose cohort. By [CONTACT_2006] +100, 3 of 21 subjects who 
received vedo lizumab 300 mg IV developed maximum stage 1 lower intestinal aGvHD and no 
subjects developed stage 2 or greater lower intestinal aGvHD. By  12 m onths, l ower inte stinal 
aGvHD developed in 3 of 21 subjects ( [ADDRESS_1074236] developed maximum stage 2 intestinal aGvHD). In subjects who received 
vedo lizumab 300 mg IV, Grade 2 -4 aGvHD developed in 4 of 21 subjects by [CONTACT_2006] +[ADDRESS_1074237]. Grade 3 aGvHD developed i n 1 of 21 subjects by [CONTACT_2006] 
+[ADDRESS_1074238] developed Grade 4 aGvHD by [CONTACT_2006] +100 
and by  12 m onths. Overall survival and non -relapse m ortalit y in the vedolizumab 300 mg cohort 
was 84 .7% and 5.6% by [ADDRESS_1074239]. 
The proposed v edolizumab dose and regimen in this phase 3 study is 300 mg o n Days -1, +13, +41, 
+69, +97, +125, and +153. This is based on the results of Vedo lizumab -1015 and, similarly, on the 
known safet y profile of Q4W vedolizumab schedule evaluated in phase 3 studies and lo ng-term
follow-up (LTFU) of IBD subjects. The proposed duration of vedo lizumab prophylaxis is inten ded 
to provi de coverage during the posttransplant period, when subjects are at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_781395].

The proposed phase [ADDRESS_1074245] Number: [ADDRESS_1074246]. Nonclinical pharmaco logy
studi es in murine model demo nstrate that i nhibit ion of the α4β7/MAdCAM -[ADDRESS_1074247]
reacti on [33] and the absence of α4β7+ cells on donor cells greatly delayed and reduced the 
presence of GvHD [19]. Furthermore, in Study Vedoli zumab -1015, a l ow incidence of intest inal 
aGvHD was observed in adults undergoing allo -HSCT for a hematologic malignancy or 
myeloproliferat ive disorder who received vedo lizumab [ADDRESS_1074248] inal aGvHD and its associated 
complicat ions. 
Theavailable PK data, nonclinical toxico logy data, and clinical data aresupporti ve of the 
inclusion ofadolescent subjects aged ≥12 y ears and weighing ≥30 kg in this phase 3 study . In 
phase 3 studies in adult swith UC or CD, body weights ranged from  28.7 to 170 kg. Safet y data 
from these studi es showed that there was no difference in the incidenc e of treatm ent-emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) based on weight or age (18- 70 years). Furtherm ore, a similar safet y 
profile has been observed in adult s with UC or CD who received vedo lizumab IV Q8W or Q4W . 
No addi tive ri sk of infection was ident ified among subjects who received a conco mitant 
immunosuppressant. Results of populat ion PK analyses in subjects with IBD indicate that a 
weight-based dosing regimen is not required and that a tiered flat -dose is appropriate for different 
weight groups. Age was not a clinically meaningful covariate. PK data from Study
Vedolizumab-[ADDRESS_1074249] 
who received 300 mg is similar to that of subjects with UC or CD. In addit ion, no new safet y 
inform ation that alters the benefit:risk balance of vedolizumab have been ident ified in the UC/CD 
clinical development program , including ongoing studies in pediatric subjects (aged 2 -17years) .
Therefore, the benefit:risk profile is expected to be similar in adults and ado lescent subjects aged 
≥12 y ears and weighing ≥[ADDRESS_1074250] ing of a CNI (CYS or 
TAC) and MTX or MMF with or wi thout the addi tion of ATG(ATG- F or thymoglo bulin) .The 
dosing of vedo lizumab in co mbination with a CNI (TAC) and MTX was well t olerated in the phase 
1b clinical study  in this subject populat ion. Similarly , vedolizumab in conjunct ion with systemic 
immunosuppressive therapy  (such as MTX, 6 -mercaptopurine, and predni sone) has been well 
tolerated in clinical studies in subjects with IBD.
Thesubject populat ion was chosen because it represents a high -risk, vulnerable populat ion for 
development of intestinal aGvHD, a driver for poor outcomes, mortality, and for whom a 
significant unmet medical need exists. The risks of this subject populat ion include those that are 
associ ated wi th hematol ogical transplantati on. Specifically , allo-HSCT pati ents are at risk of 
infect ions (opportunistic, GI, and CNS infect ions); liver injur y; infusio n-related reacti ons (IRR) 
and hypersensit ivity react ions, and relapse or new primary  malignancy . The important i dentified

HLA -matched unrelated donors (MUD) in 1 study [9]and 33 for matched related donor 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], 51 in 8of8 HLA -MUD recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], and 53 in 7/8 HLA -MUD recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], with OS
(45) lowest in the 7 of 8 HLA -MUD reci pi[INVESTIGATOR_840] [39]. Among pediatric subjects with allo -HSCT 
from unrelated donors, up to 56% will develop Grade 2 to 4 aGvHD and 29% will develop Grade 3 
to 4 aGvHD [13,14] . The intestinal tract is often invo lved in Grade [ADDRESS_1074281] is invo lved in pediatric patients, NRM increases [40]. All subjects will rece ive a 
background GvHD prophylaxis regimen consist ing of a CNI (CYS or TAC) and MTX or MMF . 
When considered a part of standard prophylactic treatment for GvHD, ATG (ATG- F or 
thymoglobulin) may be used at the discret ion of the treating physician; however, th e proportion of 
subjects receiving ATG shall co mprise no m ore than approximately 25% of the total number of 
subjects enrolled into the study. Subjects who have received or are receiving prophyla ctic agents 
other than those listed in the inclusio n criteria,including approved or other invest igational
therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014], are excluded. 
6.2.2 Dose Selection
All subjects will receive a combination of CNI (CYS or TAC) and MTX or MMF [41-43] ,which is
commo nly prescribed as prophylaxis of GvHD for subject s undergo ingallo-HSCT. ATG (ATG -F 
or thymoglo bulin) may be included as noted in Section 6.2.1 .
The vedo lizumab dose and schedule for this phase 3 study are 300 m g on Days -1, +13, +41, +69,

Vedolizumab IV
Study No. Vedolizumab -[ADDRESS_1074285] Number: 2018 -002141 -1118 September 2019
The 300 mg dose of vedolizumab was well tolerated in subjects in Study Vedo lizumab -1015 
without delay  of engraft ment (m edian 1 4days for the vedolizumab 300 mg cohort) or new safety 
concerns. Repeated vedolizumab dos ing during the [ADDRESS_1074286] inal aGvHD. 
The same vedo lizumab dose regimen to be administered to adults (aged ≥18 y ears) planned to 
undergo allo -HSCT for prophylaxis of intest inal aGvHD isconsidered appropriate for 
administration to adolescents aged 12 years and greater and weighing ≥30 kg . In phase 3 studies in 
adults wi th IBD, body  weights ranged from 28.7 to 170 kg. Safety  data from these studies showed 
no difference in the incidence of TEAE sanda similar safety  profile in adult s receiving
vedo lizumab IV Q8W or Q4W (Section4.3). A populat ion PK model was developed using pooled 
phase 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_1074287] ics (eg, age an d body  weight) on PK. This model indicated that weight -based dosing is 
not required and that age was not a clinically meaningful covariate (S ection 4.3). In addit ion, 
resul ts from Study  Vedolizumab -1015 indicated that the PK of vedolizumab (300 mg) in adults
with aGvHD was similar to that in adul ts wi th UC or CD .
6.3 Premature Termination or Suspension of Study or Investigational Site
6.3.1 Criteria for Premature Termination or Suspension of the Study
The study  will be co mpleted as planned unless 1 or more of the fo llowing criteria are satisfied that

the appropriate duration for use of contraception after the last dose of such medicinal products. 
8.7 Management of Clinical Events
8.7.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions
Current ly, there is no evidence to support the routine prophylactic administration of premedicat ion 
(eg, antihistamines, corticosteroids) to subjects receiving vedo lizumab; hence such 
prem edicat ions are unlikely to be nece ssary or beneficial. At the discret ion of the invest igator, 
however, subjects may  be administered premedication before any  study  drug administration. 
Corti costeroi ds, if given as a premedication, should be limited to the day  of administration. Study 
drug s hould be administered by a healt h care professio nal prepared to manage hypersensit ivity 
reacti ons including anaphylaxis, if they occur. Appropriate monitoring and medical support 
measure should be available for immediate use. Subjects should be observed du ring the infusio n 
and until the infusio n is co mplete. 
Subjects, parents , or legal ly acceptable representative sshoul d be instructed to report the 
development of rash, hives, pruritus, flushing, urticaria, etc. that may represent an IRR to study 
medicat ion. If signs or symptom s of IRR are observed during the administration of study  drug, i t 
shoul d be immediately discontinued and the subject treated as medically appropriate. In the case of 
a mild react ion, study  drug administrati on m ay be reinit iated (with a ppropri ate prem edicat ion) at 
the discret ion of the invest igator. Subjects with severe or serious IRRs (eg, stridor, angioedema, 
life-threatening change in vital signs) must be withdrawn from the study .
In all cases of administration- related reacti on, the m edical m onitor m ust be informed as soon as 
practi cal. The disposit ion of subjects with less severe IRRs should be discussed with the project 
clinician. 
8.7.2 Leukopenia or Lymphopenia
Leukocy te and lymphocy te counts will be mo nitored for all subjects with a hem atological  panel
(see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) and the use of prophylact ic myelo id growth factors (ie, granulocy te-colony 
stimulat ing factor) may be started with the product, dose, and route of administration at the 
discreti on of  the treating inst itution. If engraft ment has not occurred by  [CONTACT_2006] +21 ( defined as 
absolute neutrophil count >500/ mm3for 3 consecutive days or > 2000/ mm3for 1 day ), it is 
recommended that prophylact ic myelo id growth factors be started. Failure to engraft by  [CONTACT_2006] +[ADDRESS_1074343] ive CMV colit is during screening will  be excluded from

Subjects who, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_35272], have serious infections will be m onitored during 
the study. Subjects with seriousinfect ions, including viral, fungal, and bacterial infect ions, will be 
treated as clinically indicated. Interventions may include ant ibiotic treatment, if appropriate and/or 
discontinuat ion of conco mitant immuno modulators. Bl ood, sputum , urine, cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872], 
and/or stool cultures should be obtained as appropriate for the detection and diagnosis of infect ion.
Study  drug shoul d be withheld, and the medical monitor should be contact[CONTACT_781467]. Terminating study  drug administration may be considered as described in Sect ion7.5.
[IP_ADDRESS] PML
All subjects will be screened for new neuro logical si gns and symptoms potentially consistent with 
PML using the PML subject ive checklist (see Section 9.3.11) before dosing with study  drug. Any 
subjects in who msigns or symptoms o f PML are reported will undergo object ive testing. If a 
subject demonstrates a neurologic deficit related to PML upon administration of the PML 
checklist, no further doses of study drug should be administered to that subject. The subject should 
be referred to the study  neuro logist for further testing and the sponsor must be notified of this 
action.
Subsequent doses of study  drug will be administered only if the possibilit y of PML is definit ively 
excluded, as described in the Risk Minimizat ion Action Pl an for PML ( RAMP )algori thm.

An AE therefore can be any unfavorable and unintended sign ( eg, a clinically significant abnorm al 
laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal 
(invest igational) product whether or not it is considered related to the m edicinal product. In 
addition, drug -device AEs related to qualit y or malfunct ion will be collected.

Indicate a new diagnosis or unexpected worsening of a pre- exist ing condit ion. (Intermittent 
events for preexist ing condit ions underlying disease should not be considered or AEs.)
Necessitate therapeutic intervent ion.
Requi re an invasive diagnostic procedure.
Requi re discontinuation or a change in dose of study medicat ion or a concomitant medicat ion.
Be considered unfavorable by [CONTACT_781480] r eason.
AEs caused by a study procedure (eg, a bruise after blood draw) should be recorded as an AE.
Diagnoses versus signs and symptoms:
Each event should be recorded to represent a single diagnosis. Acco mpanying signs (including 
abnorm al laboratory  values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as 
additional AEs. If  a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be recorded 
appropriately  as an AE(s).
Laboratory  values and ECG findings:
Changes in laboratory  values or ECG param eters are on ly considered to be AEs if they are 
judged to be clinically  significant (i e, if som e act ion or intervent ion is required or if the 
investigator judges the change to be bey ond the range of normal physio logic fluctuati on

abnorm al value are not considered an intervent ion. In addi tion, repeated or addit ional 
noninvasive testing for verificat ion, evaluation or mo nitoring of an abnormalit y is not 
considered an intervention.
If abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings are the result of pathology for which there is an 
overall diagnosis (eg, increased creat inine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be 
reported appropriately  as an AE.
Preexist ing condit ions:
Preexist ing condi tions (present at the time of signing of informed consent) are considered 
concurrent medical condit ions and should NOT be recorded as AEs. Baseline evaluat ions (eg, 
laboratory  tests, ECG, X -rays etc.) should NOT be recorded as PTEs unless related to study
procedures. However, if the subject experiences a worsening or complicat ion of such a 
concurrent condit ion, the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded appropriately as an 
AE (worsening or complicat ion occurs after start of study  medicat ion). Invest igators should 
ensure that the event term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening 
of…”).
If a subject has a preexist ing epi[INVESTIGATOR_45283] (eg, asthma, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]) any occurrence of an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_781406] e epi[INVESTIGATOR_781407], serious or 
severe in nature, that is, invest igators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the 
change in the condit ion from baseline (eg “worsening of…”).
If a subject has a degenerat ive concurrent condition (eg, cataracts, rheumatoid arthritis), 
worsening of the condit ion should only be captured as an AE if occurring to a greater extent to 
that which would be expected. Again, investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded 
captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening of…”).
Worsening of AEs:
If the subject experiences a worsening or complicatio n of an AE after starting administration of 
the study  medicat ion, the worsening or complication should be recorded appropriately as an 
AE. Invest igators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condit ion 
(eg, “worsening of…”).
If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of an AE after any  change in study
medicat ion, the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded as a new AE. Investigators 
shoul d ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening 
of…”).
Changes in severit y of AEs:
If the subject experiences changes in severit y of an AE, the event should be captured once wit h 
the maximum sever ity recorded.

10.1.11 Frequency
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_39751] c AEs (eg, vomit ing) or those which occur repeatedly over a period of consecut ive days are 
intermittent. All other events are continuous . 
10.1.12 Action Concerning Study Medication
Drug withdrawn –a study  medicat ion is stopped due to the particular AE.
Dose not changed –the particular AE did not require stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a study  medicat ion.
Unknown –only to be used if it has not been possible to determine what action has been taken.
Not Applicable –a study medication was stopped for a reason oth er than the particular AE (eg, 
the study  has been terminated, the subject died, dosing wit h study  medicat ion was already
stopped before the onset of the AE).
Dose Interrupted –the dose was interrupted due to the particular AE.
10.1.13 Outcome
Recovered/Resolved – Subject returned to first assessment status with respect to the AE.
Recovering/Reso lving –the intensit y is lowered by  1 or m ore stages: the diagnosis or 
signs/symptom s has almost di sappeared; the abnormal laboratory  value improved but has not 
returned to the norm al range or to baseline; the subject died from a cause other than the 
particular AE wi th the condi tion rem aining “recovering/resolving”.
Not recovered/not resolved –there is no change in the diagnosis, signs or symptoms; the 
intensity of the di agnosis, signs/ symptoms or laboratory  value on the last day  of the observed 
study  period has got worse than when it started; is an irreversible congenital anomaly; the 
subject died fro m another cause with the particular AE state remaining “Not recovered/not
resolved”.
Reso lved with sequelae –the subject recovered from an acute AE but was left with 
perm anent/si gnificant impairment (eg, recovered from a cardiovascular accident but with 
some persisting paresis.
Fatal  –AEs that are considered the cause of deat h. 
Unknown –the course of the AE cannot be fo llowed up due to hospi [INVESTIGATOR_47350]’s participation in the study .

10.2 Procedures 
10.2.1 Collecting and Reporting AEs 
[IP_ADDRESS] AE Collection Period
Nonserious AEs must be collected from the time o f the first dose of study drug unt il [ADDRESS_1074410] dose of study  medicat ion.
[IP_ADDRESS] AE Reporting
At each study  visit, the investi gator will assess whether any subjective AEs have occurred. A 
neutral  quest ion, such as “How have you been feeling since y our l ast visit ?” may be asked. 
Subjects, parents , or legal ly acceptable representatives may report AEs occurring at any other time 
during the study . 
All subjects experiencing AEs afterstudy  drug administration, whether considered associated wi th
the use of the study  medicati on or not, must be m onitored until  the symptom s subside and any 
clinically relevant changes in laboratory  values have returned to baseline or un til there i s a 
satisfactory  explanat ion for the changes observed. All AEs will b e docum ented in the AE page of 
the eCRF, whether or not the invest igator concludes that the event is related to the drug treatment. 
The fo llowing inform ation will be documented for each event:
1.Event term .
2. Start and stop date.3.Severit y.
4.Invest igator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the causal relationship between the event and administration of study 
medicat ion(s) (related or not rel ated).
5.Invest igator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the causal relat ionship to study  procedure(s), including the details of 
the suspected procedure.

subject s treated with vedolizumab, the sponsor, with input fro m PML experts, has developed the 
RAMP. The complete descript ion of the RAMP program, including materials and instructions for 
its implementati on and m onitoring, i s included in the s tudy manual .
The RAMP is focused on early  clinical detecti on and management of that specific safet y risk, 
including the discont inuat ion of s tudy drug, if applicable. Subjec ts are assessed for si gns and 
symptoms of PML before the administration of each dose of study  drug using a n age -appropri ate
PML subj ective symptom checklist. Subjec ts with a posit ive PML subjec tive symptom checklist at 
any time after enro llment in a vedo lizumab clinical study will be evaluated according to a 
prespecified algorithm (the PML Case Evaluat ion Algori thm). The next dose of vedo lizumab will 
be held unt il the evaluation is complete and resul ts are available. Subsequent doses of vedo lizumab
will be administered only  if the possibilit y of PML is definit ively excluded, as described in the 
RAMP algorithm. An independent adjudicat ion committee (IAC) has been ident ified as part of the 
RAMP pro gram to review new neuro logical signs and symptoms potentially consistent with PML, 
and will provide input regarding subject evaluat ion and management as defined in the IAC charter.
To ensure success of the RAMP program, site personnel will be trained to recognize the features of 
PML, and subject s/parents/legally  acceptable representati ves will be trained to report specific 
neuro logical signs and symptoms without delay. Educational materials for teaching site personnel 
and subject s/parents/legally  acceptable representatives about PML and the RAMP procedures will 
be distributed to all sites and are included in the s tudy manual. Formal teaching and training will be

13.0 STATISTICAL METHODS
13.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
A stati stical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized before database lock. This 
docum ent will provi de further details regarding the definit ion of analysis variables and analysis 
methodol ogy to address all study  objectives.
The primary analysis for efficacy and safety data will be performed at the end of treatment (EOT), 
when all subjects have co mpleted Day +180, wi thdrawn from  the study , or ET , or when the 
planned number of primary endpo int events as determined by [CONTACT_781489]. 
To protect the integrit y of the study  and ensure the unbiased study  conduct from  EOT to EOS, a 
selected group of [COMPANY_005] personnel will be ident ified to conduct the unblinded primary analysis. 
Study  investigators, participating subjects, and sponsor personnel responsible for conduct of the 
remainder of the study  will remain blinded. Details of unblin ding for primary  analysis will be 
provi ded in the SAP and/or data access management plan (DAMP). The EOS analysis will be 
perform ed after the final database lock at EOS.
A targeted data review will be conducted before database lock. This review will assess the 
accuracy  and com pleteness of the study  database, subject evaluabilit y, and appropri ateness of the 
planned statistical methods. Data may also be summarized descript ively by [CONTACT_551] (aged 
≥18years and ≥12 years to <18 y ears) . 
13.1.1 Analysis Sets
The popul ations used for analysis will include the fo llowing:
Full analysis set (FAS): Following the intent- to-treat principle, t he FAS will include all 
subject s who are randomized ,receive at least [ADDRESS_1074440] . 
The analysis will be based on the treatment to which the subjects are randomized.
Per-protocol populat ion is defined to include all rando mized subject s who received any
amount of blinded study  drug and have no significant protocol deviat ions. All decisio ns to 
exclude subjec ts from the per -protocol populat ion dataset will be made before to the study  is

One interim analysis for futilit y and sample size re -estimat ion is planned for this study, which will 
occur after approximately 30 of the targeted primary  endpoint events (ie, approximately 44 
events) have been accrued. The analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_781504] a 
manner that maintains the blinding to the study  team , the invest igato rs, and the subjects. The 
interim analysis results will be presented to the DMC but will not be shared with the sponsor. 
Specific criteria for DMC recommendations will be provided in the DMC charter. The fut ility

dropped out, the primary analysis for efficacy may be performed at that time.Details o f Type I error control fo llowing sample size re -estimat ion will be provided in the SAP.
13.3 Determination of Sample Size
Assuming the event rate for the primary endpo int is 34.1% for the placebo group and 21.8% for the 
vedo lizumab group and the rate of loss -to-follow-up is 10% for both groups, a sample size of [ADDRESS_1074448] s per group ([ADDRESS_1074449] s total ) is expected to generate 148 primary endpoint events and 
hence provi de 90% power at 2- sided 0.[ADDRESS_1074450] secondary  endpo int is 39.5% for the placebo group and 27.1% for the vedolizumab group, this 
sample size is expected to generate [ADDRESS_1074451] secondary endpoint and hence provide 
approximately  86% power at 2 -sided 0.05 l evel of si gnificance .CCI

corresponding text has been revised throughout the protocol.
Change 1:Clarificat ion ofthe descript ion of the disease to be treated in ado lescent subjects.
The primary  chang e occurs in Section 4.1.1 Disease to be Treated:
Added text: Allogeneic hematopoiet ic stem cell transplantation (allo -HSCT) i s an important and 
potenti ally curative therapy for many hematologic malignancies, but its use is limited 
by [CONTACT_941] m ajor com plicat ion of graft -versus -host di sease (GvHD) [1,2]. GvHD is a 
commo n complication o f allo-HSCT and a m ajor cause of m orbidi ty and m ortali ty. 
Acute GvHD results from the activation of alloreactive donor lymphocytes by 
[CONTACT_781521]-presenting cells (APCs) [3,4] . The 
risk of GvHD and its severit ydepends on several factors including recipi[INVESTIGATOR_29039], cell 
source, donor characteristics, degree of histocompatibilit y between the donor and 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], the condi tioning regimen used, and the GvHD prophylaxis strategy  used 
[1,5-7]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_781425], approximately 40% to 70% of allallo-HSCT 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (inclusive of pediatric and adult subjects) develop Grade 2 to 4 acute 
GvHD (aGvHD) [5,6,8 -11]. Approximately 45% to 56% of pediatric allo- HSCT 
(ranging from <1 to 20 years of age) from unrelated donors will develop Grade 2 
to 4 aGvHD , and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) appears to be greater in those 
pediatric patients with intestinal involvement [12-14] . Classical aGvHD occurs 
around the time of engraft ment (~[ADDRESS_1074514] infusio n) up to Day
100[15] and late aGvHD occurs greater than [ADDRESS_1074515] [16,17] .

Change 2:Addit ion of result s from nonclinical studi es related to inclusio n of ado lescent subjects .
The primary  change occurs in Section [IP_ADDRESS] Nonclinical :
Initial
wording:Several published key  nonclinical studi es support the use of vedo lizumab for the 
prevent ion of GvHD. Nonclinical pharmacology  studi es in m urine m odels of aGvHD 
suggest that the prevention of T cell trafficking to GALT, via interruption of the 
α4β7/MAdCAM -1 interacti on, m ay prevent GvHD [30 -32]. In a mouse model of 
GvHD, whe n using donor cells sorted and purified based on the presence or absence o f 
α4β7, the absence o f α4β7+ cells great ly delayed and reduced the presence of GvHD 
[16]. Li ke these results, α4β7 expressio n on donor T cells has been shown to be 
important in the i nduct ion of GvHD [17]. By  [CONTACT_781523], vedo lizumab may act to reduce the severity and intensit y of intestinal 
GvHD. Extensive nonclinical evaluat ions of the cardiovascular, acute, local, 
subchronic, chronic, immun ologic, and reproductive toxicit y of vedo lizumab in 
pharmaco logically responsive species (New Zealand white rabbits and cyno molgus 
monkeys) have been conducted and support its clinical development. Nonclinical 
studi es also show that vedolizumab does not an tagoni ze 4β1 integrin [13].

wording:Several published key  nonclinical studi es support the use of vedo lizumab for the 
prevent ion of GvHD. Nonclinical pharmacology  studi es in m urine m odels of aGvHD 
suggest that the prevention of T cell trafficking to GALT, via interruption of the 
α4β7/MAdCAM -1 interaction, may prevent GvHD [3032][33-35]. In a mouse mode l 
of GvHD, when using donor cells sorted and purified based on the presence or absence 
of α4β7, the absence of α4β7+ cells greatly delayed and reduced the presence of 
GvHD [16][19]. Like these results, α4β7 expressio n on donor T cells has been shown 
to be important in the induct ion of GvHD [17][20]. By [CONTACT_781524], vedolizumab may act to reduce th e severit y and intensit y of

subchronic, chronic, immuno logic, and reproductive toxicit y of vedo lizumab in 
pharmaco logically responsive species (New Zealand white rabbit s and cyno molgus

bound with similar affinity to rabbit, monkey, and human α4β7 integrin. 
Results from a 13- week toxicity study in juvenile cynomolgus monkeys identified 
100 mg/kg (human equivalent dose 1920 mg in a 60-kg human) as the 
no-observed -adverse -effect level (NOAEL). Inclusion of sexually immature 
monkeys in the 3 -and 6 month toxicit y studies support administration of 
vedolizumab in clinical studies with adolescent subjects (aged 12 years and 
greater ).
Nonclinical studies also show that vedolizumab does not antagonize 4β1 integrin

Rationale for Change :Addit ion of results f rom nonclinical studies related to i nclusio n of 
adolescent subjects .
Change 3:Updated human experience as reported in the 9th development safety update report.
The primary  change occurs in Section [IP_ADDRESS] Human Experience:
Initial
wording:As of 19 Nov 2017, approximately 5224 subjects (healt hy or patients with UC or CD, 
aGvHD, pouchit is, or melano ma) have received at least 1 dose of vedo lizumab across 
all studies in the clinical development program. As reported in the development saf ety 
update report (dated 19 May 2017), cum ulative patient exposure to vedolizumab, in 
more than [ADDRESS_1074518] been reported fo llowing 
vedo lizumab administration include: nasopharyngitis, bronchit is, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_781426], influenza, sinusit is, headache, oropharyngeal pain, cough, nausea, 
rash, pruritus, arthralgia, back pain, pain in extremit ies, and pyrexia. Risks associated 
with vedolizumab treatment have been ident ified and categorized. Important 
ident ified risks are infusion -related reacti ons (IRRs ) and hypersensit ivity react ions, 
and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_781427], including bronchitis, influenza, nasopharyngit is, and 
sinusit is. Important potential risks are GI infections and systemic infect ions against 
which the gut constitutes a defensive barrier; serious infect ions, including 
opportunist ic infect ions such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML); 
malignancy; and liver injury . 
Most serious adverse events (SAEs) were related to exacerbat ions or complicat ions of 
the underlying UC or CD. Similar safet y pro files fo r vedo lizumab have been observed 
in subjects who received vedolizumab IV Q4W or Q8W and in subjects fo llowing 
long-term Q4W treatm ent for up to [ADDRESS_1074519], vedolizumab (at 75 or 300 mg on Days -1, +13, and +42) was added to 
standard GvHD prophylaxis (TAC and MTX) therapy. All subject s engrafted and no 
new safet y signals were reported.
Overall, vedo lizumab has been well tolerated. Further detail on the safet y profile of 
vedo lizumab can be found in the current edit ion of the investigator’s brochure (IB).

Vedolizumab IV
Study No. Vedolizumab -[ADDRESS_1074520] Number: 2018 -002141 -1118 September 2019
Amended 
or new 
wording:As of 19 Nov May 2017 9, approximately 5224 6376 subjects (healthy or patients with 
UC or CD , aGvHD , pouchi tis, or melanoma , or undergoing allo- HSCT ) have 
received at least 1 dose of vedo lizumab across all studies in the clinical development 
program. As reported in the 9th development safety update report ( datedDSUR, for 
the period 20 May 2018 to 19 May 20172019), global cumulative postmarketing 
patient exposure to vedolizumab , in m ore than [ADDRESS_1074521] been reported fo llowing 
vedo lizumab admin istrati on include: nasopharyngitis, bronchit is, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_781426], influenza, sinusit is, headache, oropharyngeal pain, cough, nausea, 
rash, pruritus, arthralgia, back pain, pain in extremit ies, and pyrexia , fatigue, and 
injection site react ions. Risks associated with vedolizumab treatment have been 
ident ified and categorized. Important ident ified risks are hypersensitivity reactions,
including infusion -related reacti ons (IRRs) and hypersensit ivity react ions, and upper 
respi [INVESTIGATOR_781392], including bronchit is, influenza, nasopharyngit is, and sinusit is, 
bronchitis, and influenza. Most IRRs are mild/moderate in intensity and resolve 
with minimal or no intervention . Important potent ial risks are GIinfections, 
including gastrointestinal infect ions and systemic infections against which the gut 
constitutes a defensive barrier; serious infections, including opportunist ic infections 
such as progressive mult ifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML); malignancy; and liver 
injury . Reported serious infections include tuberculosis, sepsis, Salmonella sepsis, 
Listeria meningitis, and cytomegaloviral colitis. 
Most serious adverse events (SAEs) were related to exacerbat ions or complicat ions of 
the underlying UC or CD. Similar safet y pro files fo r vedo lizumab have been observed 
in subjects who received vedolizumab IV Q4W or Q8W and in subjects fo llowing 
long-term Q4W treatm ent for up to 8 y ears, and in subjects administered 
vedolizumab subcutaneously (SC). With the exception of injection s ite reactions, 
the safety profile for vedolizumab SC is consistent with that for vedolizumab IV . 
In the phase 1b Study  Vedolizumab -1015, conducted in [ADDRESS_1074522], vedolizumab (at 75 or 300 mg on Days -1, +13, and +42) was added to 
standard GvHD prophylaxis (TAC and MTX) therapy. All subject s engrafted and no 
new safet y signals were reported. Inclinical studies, n o safety concerns were 
identified in subjects with aGvHD or undergoing allo- HSCT ,and the events 
reported were consistent with known risks in these patient populations.
In addition, no new safety information that alters the benefit:risk balance of 
vedolizumab was identified in the IBD clinical development program, including 
ongoing studies in pediatric subjects with UC or CD (DSUR, for the period 
20 May 2018 to 19 May 2019).

Change 5:Update to the benefit:risk pro file to support the inclusion ofadolescent subjects.
The primary  change occurs in Section 4.3Benefit:Risk Profile :
Added text: The proposed phase [ADDRESS_1074528]. Nonclinical pharmaco logy studi es in m urine m odel dem onstrate that 
inhibit ion of the α4β7/MAdCAM- [ADDRESS_1074529] reaction [30][33] and 
the absence of α4β7+ cells on donor cells great ly delayed and reduced the presence of 
GvHD [16][19]. Furthermore, in Study Vedo lizumab -1015, a l owincidence of 
intestinal aGvHD was observed in adults undergo ing allo -HSCT for a hem atologic 
malignancy or myeloproliferat ive disorder who received vedo lizumab [ADDRESS_1074530] who, despi[INVESTIGATOR_781432] ,
remain at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_781433].
The available PK data, nonclinical toxicology data, and clinical data, are
supportive of the inclusion of adolescent subjects aged ≥12 years and weighing 
≥30 kg in this phase 3 study. In phase 3 studies in adults with UC or CD, body 
weights ranged from 28.7 to 170 kg. Safety data from these studies showed that 
there was no diffe rence in the incidence of treatment- emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) based on weight or age (18 -70 years). Furthermore, a similar safety 
profile has been observed in adults with UC or CD who received vedolizumab 
IV Q8W or Q4W. No additive risk of infection was identified among subjects 
who received a concomitant immunosuppressant. Results of population PK analyses in subjects with IBD indicate that a weight -
based dosing regimen is not 
required and that a tiered flat-dose is appropriate for different weight g roups. 
Age was not a clinically meaningful covariate. PK data from Study 
Vedolizumab -[ADDRESS_1074531] who received 300 mg is similar to that of subjects with UC or CD. 
In addition, no new safety information that alters the benefit:risk balance of 
vedolizumab have been identified in the UC/CD clinical development program, 
including ongoing studies in pediatric subjects (aged 2- 17 years). Therefore, the 
benefit:risk profile is expected to be similar in adults and adolescent subjects 
aged ≥12years and weighing ≥30 kg.

The same vedolizumab dose regimen to be administered to adults (aged 
≥18years) planned to undergo allo -HSCT for prophylaxis of intestinal aGvHD 
is considered appropriate for administration to adolescents aged 12 years and 
greater and weighing ≥30 kg. In phase 3 studies in adults with IBD, body 
weights ranged from 28.7 to 170 kg. Safety data from these studies showed no difference in the incidence of TEAEs and a similar safety profile in adults 
receiving vedolizumab IV Q8W or Q4W (S ection 4.3). A population PK model 
was developed using pooled phase 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_1074537] of patient demographic characteristics (eg, age and body weight) on PK. This model indicated that weight -
based dosing 
is not required and that age was not a clinically meaningful covariate (S ection 
4.3). In addition, results from Study Vedolizumab -1015 indicated that the PK of 
vedolizumab (300 mg) in adults with aGvHD was similar to that in adults with UC or CD.

The primary  change occurs in Section 7.3.2 Permit ted Medicat ions and Treatments:
Added text: Current ly, there is no evidence to support the routine prophylactic administration of 
prem edicat ion (eg, antihistamines, corticosteroids) to subjects receiving 
vedo lizumab; hence, such premedicat ion is unlikely to be necessary or beneficial. At 
the discret ion of the invest igator, however, subjects may be administered 
prem edicat ion before any  study  drug administration. Use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_15413] (eg, 
lidocaine, tetracaine , prilocaine ) is recommended for blood draws or IV 
insertions f or the comfort of subjects aged 12 to <18 years. This use will notbe

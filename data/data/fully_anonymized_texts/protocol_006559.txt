Version 1.0;  Page 3 of 28; [ADDRESS_1039382] cancer (ILC) accounts for approximately 10-15% of breast malignancies [ 1]. ILC 
has a distinct histology and discohesive growth which makes it difficult to visualize with current imaging 
modalities such as mammography, ultrasound and breast and whole body MR. Suboptimal imaging 
adversely impacts accurate staging upon which therapeutic decisions are based [ 2]. The metastatic 
pattern of ILC also differs from that of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) with a tendency to involve the 
gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, peritoneum, retroperitoneum and leptomeninges. While 
fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET has been shown to clinically upstage patients with locally advanced IDC, 
this is not so with ILC, which has been described as “initially indolent but slowly progressive”. There are 
currently no accurate imaging techniques for staging ILC. Our goal is to address an unmet public 
health need by [CONTACT_759122], specifically detection of metastatic disease. 
Amino acid transporters are upregulated in breast cancer cells [ 3]. We and others have 
successfully imaged breast cancer with fluciclovine (18F) PET, an FDA approved synthetic amino acid 
radiotracer originally developed at Emory for imaging of cerebral glioma and prostate cancer. In 
exploratory studies conducted at Emory and Memorial Sloan Kettering in [ADDRESS_1039383] cancer 
(13 patients with ILC), fluciclovine PET demonstrated promising results in detection of ILC in primary 
tumors and locoregional metastases [ 4-6]. Distant disease was not studied. Post-hoc RNA sequencing 
of the Emory cohort reveals that numerous molecular signaling pathways correlate with fluciclovine 
uptake including PI3K/Akt signalling, which mediates a range of biological endpoints necessary for 
cancer growth including cell survival, apoptosis, autophagy, cell cycle progression and angiogenesis. 
Since the pro-angiogenic factor VEGF contributes to Akt activation to improve oxygenation and 
nutrient supply to areas of poor vascularization, attention has turned to neoangiogenesis as an imaging 
biomarker for breast cancer. A different PET radiotracer in clinical trials for prostate cancer, prostate 
specific membrane antigen (PSMA) may also detect breast cancer due to the upregulation of PSMA 
receptors in tumor angiogenesis. Prostate-specific is actually a misnomer as PSMA receptors are 
upregulated in tumor neovasculature in many cancers including breast cancer. Evolving data suggests 
PSMA radiotracers may also have utility in breast cancer, including ILC [ 7-11].  
Our preliminary data support a key scientific premise that metabolic imaging with fluciclovine (18F) 
PET has shown promise in the detection of ILC. There is also emerging data that tumor neovasculature 
imaging with PSMA PET may improve detection of ILC. We hypothesize that amino acid transport 
metabolic imaging with fluciclovine (18F) PET will improve staging of ILC, particularly for distant 
metastases, compared to conventional imaging. We also hypothesize that receptor directed 
PSMA imaging of tumor associated neovasculature in ILC will reveal unique information to 
complement metabolic interrogation with fluciclovine PET. Improved staging will facilitate more 
appropriate management decisions.
To test these hypotheses with the highest scientific rigor, we propose an early phase feasibility 
trial with fluciclovine and PSMA PET strategies centered on detection of metastasis in patients with 
advanced ILC using histology as the gold standard. As an exploratory aim, we will also correlate the 
occurrence of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) directed against ESR1 and PI3K with presence of 
metastasis and tumor burden. We will explore if a multiparametric strategy with ctDNA and imaging will 
help define which patients should undergo molecular imaging and also identify those who may forego 
biopsy if distant lesions are detected on imaging. We expect this pi[INVESTIGATOR_759106] a definitive NIH sponsored trial developi[INVESTIGATOR_759107]. 
Specific Aim 1: Improve detection of metastasis with fluciclovine and PSMA PET versus best 
standard of care conventional imaging, as confirmed with histology. We will image [ADDRESS_1039384] either: a) clinical or imaging suspi[INVESTIGATOR_759108]; or b) proven metastatic 
disease but in whom there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_759109]. Abnormal foci which correlate to anatomic lesions previously unsuspected on conventional 
imaging will undergo optional biopsy as clinically indicated in the safest manner possible (if not already 
done) to determine the verified detection rate of metastatic disease.
Specific Aim 2: Determine concordance and discordance of ILC detection with PSMA versus 
fluciclovine PET, as confirmed with histology. We will compare verified detection rates for 
metastasis between fluciclovine and PSMA PET modalities. This may necessitate a second biopsy of a 
 
Version 1.0;  Page 4 of 28; 29 July 2020distant lesion discordant between the 2 PET techniques. We will also analyze images for biodistribution 
in the primary lesion(s) for both radiotracers.
Exploratory Aim 3: Establish the role of molecular detection by [CONTACT_759123]3CA, ESR1, HER2, and AKT1 in characterizing the degree of tumor burden as identified by 
[CONTACT_759124]/or tumor neovasculature receptor imaging [ 12]. We will collect 
peripheral blood for ctDNA in all patients and determine if ctDNA correlates with presence or absence of 
metastases and tumor burden as identified by [CONTACT_255959] (metabolic) and/or PSMA (angiogenesis) PET. 
1.2 Schema
We will undertake a single arm feasibility study with n=[ADDRESS_1039385] either: a) clinical or imaging suspi[INVESTIGATOR_759108]; b) biopsy proven metastatic 
disease but in whom there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_759109]. All patients will be recruited from the Winship Glenn Family Breast Cancer Program at any 
Emory facility and they will have already undergone best standard of care conventional imaging (CT or 
MR and possibly bone scan depending on clinical presentation). Standard of care conventional 
imaging typi[INVESTIGATOR_759110], since FDG PET is not recommended for lobular 
cancer due to low sensitivity. We will then complete both fluciclovine PET and Ga PSMA PET scans 
on the same patient on separate days separated by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_1039386] therapy. 
One or two metastases (depending on scan findings) will then undergo biopsy in the safest manner 
possible as standard of care (if not already done) to determine the verified detection rate of metastatic 
disease. Uncommonly, definitive imaging such as MR for skeletal or liver lesions may be accepted in lieu 
of biopsy, if biopsy is not feasible. We will then compare verified detection rate of each PET study to 
conventional imaging and to each other. In addition, we will collect peripheral blood for ctDNA in all 
patients and determine if ctDNA correlates with presence or absence of metastases and tumor burden 
as identified by [CONTACT_309820], fluciclovine and/or PSMA PET. Study Specific Experimental 
Procedures will only consist of both PET studies and ctDNA analysis. All other procedures will be 
conducted per standard of care. See Figure 1.

Version 1.0;  Page 7 of 28; [ADDRESS_1039389] and accurately stage, especially distant 
metastases. This difficulty is in part secondary to the discohesive growth pattern due to loss of E-cadherin 
which results in diffuse spread of cancer cells in atypi[INVESTIGATOR_759111]. ILC may not demonstrate significant FDG uptake and also may be present in 
difficult to image locations such as peritoneum and central nervous system [ 2]. Thus, with ILC there may 
be significant understaging leading to inappropriate therapeutic decisions. Finally, since lobular breast 
cancer is not mass forming as is IDC, response to therapy may be difficult to evaluate. For these same 
reasons recurrent disease is difficult to detect with ILC, thus potentially limiting salvage therapy options. 
Therefore, the scientific justification for improved detection of metastatic disease is compelling.
Fluciclovine
Tumor glucose metabolism, specifically the shift away from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic 
glycolysis (Warburg Effect), has formed the basis of advanced molecular imaging of breast cancer. Other 
metabolic activity upregulated in breast cancer includes use of amino acids. The amino acid transporters, 
specifically LAT1, ASCT2, ATB0,+ SNAT1 and XCT, are overexpressed in breast cancer and reported to 
be associated with tumor growth, metastasis and hormone receptor status [ 13-16]. Shennan and 
coauthors demonstrated that certain human breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, express 
system L (large neutral amino acid) transporters [ 17, 18]. In fact, Shennan has also demonstrated that 
growth of cultured human breast cancer cells may be decreased via inhibition of system L transporters 
[14]. Fluciclovine is a synthetic amino acid analog PET radiotracer transported via system L (LAT1) and 
ASCT (ASCT2) and has shown promise in the imaging of prostate and other cancers [ 19]. Fluciclovine 
uptake has been shown in vitro in breast carcinoma cell lines as well as in animal models of breast cancer 
[16]. This has led to the study of amino acid transport as a basis for superior detection of breast cancer 
by [CONTACT_27156]. As noted in the preliminary data section of this proposal, we unexpectedly discovered that 
ILC was better detected with amino acid transport-based PET with fluciclovine compared to glycolytic 
based FDG PET. Preliminary studies understandably focused on the detection of primary and 
locoregional disease. We propose to expand this concept to also include detection of distant disease 
which could alter the stage of the patient and thus therapeutic approach. Improved initial staging and 
treatment selection could impact the survival of nearly 40,000 women with ILC per year, and potentially 
enhance the evaluation of therapy response in women living with metastatic ILC.
PSMA
PSMA receptors are upregulated in many cancers besides prostate cancer since tumor associated 
neovasculature has upregulated PSMA expression [ 8]. It is likely that PSMA cleavage of vitamin B9 (folic 
acid) stimulates oncogenic signaling through glutamate receptors with downstream activation of the PI3K-
Akt-mTOR signaling pathway [ 20]. Utilizing PSMA as a biologic marker of tumor neovasculature thus has 
a solid scientific underpi[INVESTIGATOR_759112]. 
Many non-prostate 68Ga-PSMA avid malignancies have been reported in the literature including breast 
cancer, yet there is little information specifically on ILC [ 10]. Furthermore, if we can demonstrate that ILC 
is sufficiently PSMA avid, there is a possibility that a theranostic approach with Lu-177 PSMA 
radiotherapy may be investigated as is currently occurring with metastatic prostate cancer [ 21]. In fact, 
there has been one case report of metastatic IDC triple negative breast cancer treated with Lu-177 PSMA 
[11]. While 68Ga-PSMA is FDA approved for prostate cancer, it is not FDA approved for breast cancer. 
Ga-PSMA is currently produced at the Emory Center for Systems Imaging for an ongoing prostate cancer 
trial, and [CONTACT_79512] holds an IND allowing research applications.
ctDNA
The role of ctDNA specifically in regard to ILC has been little studied, especially the ability of ctDNA in 
predicting distant disease. The premise in this exploratory aim is specifically studying the association of 
ctDNA targeted to ILC with imaging that is more sensitive to ILC compared with FDG PET. If there is an 
association, this would be a significant area for future research since ctDNA expression could then be 
utilized to select patients who should undergo this advanced imaging or serve to improve specificity in 
lieu of confirmatory biopsy if the association with verified detection rate of metastasis was particularly 
 
Version 1.0;  Page 8 of 28; [ADDRESS_1039390]. Finally, understanding if this correlation is associated with upregulated amino acid metabolism 
and/or tumor neoangiogenesis as characterized by [CONTACT_759125]. 
2.2 Background
Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) comprises 10-15% of breast cancer. While mammography, ultrasound, 
breast MRI, and whole body FDG PET form the backbone of breast imaging, there are limitations in the 
imaging of lobular cancer histology, especially for distant disease (figure 1) [ 22, 23]. ILC is diagnosed at 
a later and more advanced stage compared with IDC and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_759113] [ 1]. Up 
to 50% of patients with the CDH1 genetic mutation will 
develop ILC [ 1]. The development of metastatic 
disease is likely facilitated by [CONTACT_38795] E-cadherin in 
most ILC cells [ 24]. Similarly, while (18F) 
fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography 
(FDG-PET) has also assumed an important role in 
whole body staging, detection of recurrent disease 
and monitoring therapy response, limitations for 
lobular cancer are well described in the literature [ 2, 
25]. These limitations are secondary to indolent 
growth and diffuse growth patterns, making lobular 
cancer metastasis difficult to distinguish from 
background activity. In a study by [CONTACT_759126] [ADDRESS_1039391] 
on upstaging and did not reveal additional nodal 
disease. Compared with IDC patients who were 
upstaged in 22% of cases to stage 4 in a separate cohort, only 6% of ILC patients had unsuspected 
distant metastasis that were FDG PET positive [ 26]. 
Fluciclovine
Due to the limitations of FDG PET for the staging of breast cancer in earlier studies, we have investigated 
molecular imaging targeting other aspects of the metabolome [ 27, 28]. Amino acids are involved in many 
aspects of human nutrition including the synthesis of proteins. Amino acid metabolism has been 
demonstrated to be upregulated in many tumors [ 13]. Since amino acid metabolism is also upregulated 
in breast cancer, molecular imaging utilizing natural or synthetic amino acid radiotracers is an attractive 
approach [ 28, 29]. Emory University is a center of innovation for amino acid transport PET imaging, 
having developed anti-1-amino-3-[18F]fluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid (anti-3-[18F]FACBC or 
fluciclovine), a synthetic amino acid analog PET radiotracer, which was subsequently FDA approved for 
restaging of prostate cancer [ 30]. Liang reported fluciclovine uptake in breast carcinoma cell lines which 
correlated with malignant potential as well as in orthotopic MDA-MB-[ADDRESS_1039392] carcinoma xenografts 
[16]. With funds from a Winship Glenn Family Breast Center Pi[INVESTIGATOR_759114] 2014-2015, we studied uptake 
characteristics of fluciclovine in breast carcinoma, confining the study to evaluation of the primary breast 
lesions and locoregional disease. 
A total of 12 patients with 13 primary lesions were studied at Emory [ 5]. At diagnosis, 9/[ADDRESS_1039393] cancer while 3/12 had local recurrence. Of the malignant lesions, there were 7/13 
invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), 5/13 invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) and 1/13 invasive metaplastic 
carcinoma with sarcomatous differentiation (IMC). Histologic sampling occurred in 9 locoregional lymph 
nodes (4 benign and 5 malignant). Of the malignant nodes, [ADDRESS_1039394] lesions, IDC had higher uptake 
than ILC in the primary tumor. However, this was reversed with nodal disease in which metastatic 
ILC nodes had higher uptake than IDC nodes (ILC mean SUVmax (±SD) of 6.2±0.8; IDC mean 
SUVmax of 3.3±2.6). Interestingly, uptake by [CONTACT_759127]. Figure [ADDRESS_1039395] lesion and a biopsy proven metastatic axillary node 
reported negative on outside MR and ultrasound.

Version 1.0;  Page 9 of 28; [ADDRESS_1039396]. Fluciclovine and FDG activity were compared in 8 
biopsy proven lesions (5 malignant and 2 benign primary, 1 node). The malignant lesions included 3 IDC, 
2 ILC and 1 IMC. For ILC, mean SUVmax was 4.6 (±3.5) with fluciclovine compared to 2.6 (±1.0) for 
FDG. This finding was surprising and intriguing since uptake was greater in ILC with fluciclovine 
PET than with FDG. Figure [ADDRESS_1039397] cancer by [CONTACT_759128]. Results were published in the 
same issue of the Journal of Nuclear Medicine as our paper along with an accompanying editorial [ 6, 31]. 
In that series 27 women with locally advanced IDC (n = 19) or ILC (n = 8) underwent fluciclovine PET/CT. 
All primary tumors were radiotracer avid. Fluciclovine PET detected 20/21 patients with axillary nodal 
metastases and also detected pathologically proven extraaxillary nodal disease in 3 patients, including 2 
previously unsuspected internal mammary nodes. In the 4 patients with ILC who underwent FDG and 
fluciclovine PET, primary ILCs demonstrated fluciclovine avidity (median SUVmax, 6.1; range, 4.5–10.9) 
greater than FDG avidity (median SUVmax, 3.7; range, 1.8–6.0). Thus, in total from both cohorts, [ADDRESS_1039398] lesion; in nodal 
metastases, this relationship reversed and ILC in nodal disease had greater fluciclovine uptake 
than IDC. Furthermore, ILC nodal metastasis had greater fluciclovine uptake than in the primary 
ILC breast lesion. ILC also seems to have better correlation with complete metabolic response to 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy as reported in a separate study [ 4]. Critically, since these were pi[INVESTIGATOR_30274], only images of the thorax were obtained. Detection of distant disease was not studied. 
Our proposed trial will specifically address the detection of distant disease and locoregional 
staging.   
PSMA
Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a Type 2 transmembrane glycoprotein of the M28 
peptidase family and is overexpressed on the cell surface of prostate cancer [ 32]. The name [CONTACT_131782]-
specific is a misnomer, since other cancers including breast cancer have upregulated PSMA receptors 
due to tumor angiogenesis. Most data regarding PSMA PET with breast cancer pertains to IDC. Wernicke 
studied [ADDRESS_1039399] cancer [ 7]. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for tumor 
associated vascular endothelial cell PSMA receptors revealed staining in 74% of primary and 100% of 
brain metastasis. There was absence of PSMA staining in 98% of normal breast tissue. Wernicke noted 
there was no difference between PSMA staining for IDC and ILC, yet only [ADDRESS_1039400] cancer, moderate to strong tumor associated neovasculature 
PSMA staining was present in 67% of distant metastasis versus 36% in primary tumor cells [ 9]. Yet, only 
12 ILC patients were included and it was not clear if these patients had metastases. In a study of 315

Version 1.0;  Page 10 of 28; 29 July 2020cases by [CONTACT_759129] 64 tumors were ILC, 64.6% of patients with IDC had PSMA staining, versus 
42.2% of those with ILC [ 11]. Finally, in one of the few imaging studies, Sathekge reported in [ADDRESS_1039401] carcinoma patients that PSMA PET visualized 84% of lesions; yet again, only 2 ILC patients 
were included in this cohort. In a major review in the Journal of Nuclear Medicine, Salas-Fragomeni 
argues “this potential application of PSMA-targeted imaging in breast cancer should perhaps be most 
urgently explored, as the need for reliable agents for systemic staging in lobular breast cancer has been 
long-standing” [ 8]. Our study will address this urgent question, that of the utility of PSMA PET explicitly 
for ILC metastatic disease, as well as that of fluciclovine PET for ILC. 
ctDNA
The absolute number of circulating tumor cells has been associated with metastatic breast cancer [ 33, 
34]. A more refined technique, that of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), holds promise as a “liquid biopsy,” 
since tumor DNA circulating in the blood is more specific for carcinoma. High levels of ctDNA are reported 
to correlate with tumor size, lymph node involvement, histopathological grade, and clinical staging [ 35-
40]. Though there have been anecdotal reports of ctDNA and ILC or inclusion of a small number of ILC 
related ctDNA in a larger study, ILC has not been systematically studied [ 41]. Probing the association of 
ctDNA to tumor burden in ILC with two novel imaging biomarkers (amino acid transport/fluciclovine and 
angiogenesis/PSMA) with more sensitivity than FDG PET for ILC will provide biologic insights in the 
context of this exploratory aim.  
2.3 Potential Risks and Benefits
Benefits:
The primary benefit of participation in this study is more accurate identification of metastatic disease 
which may impact appropriate staging and therapy decisions. If occult metastasis are present but are not 
identified on conventional imaging this would lead to understaging and possible futile curative therapy. 
On the other hand, if conventional imaging identifies metastasis which are in fact false positive for 
neoplasia, and which could have been more definitively characterized by [CONTACT_759130], this may 
lead to overstaging and inappropriate withholding of curative therapy. 
Study Specific Procedure Risks:
1) Radiation Risks: The principal risk associated with a radiation dose is the possibility of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a 
radiation-induced cancer later in life. However, the additional risk of radiation-induced cancer from these 
diagnostic procedures is low compared to the risks from the disease itself as well as systemic therapy or 
radiation therapy. 
Human dosimetry data for fluciclovine from FDA package insert: The (radiation absorbed) effective dose 
resulting from the administration of the recommended activity of 370 MBq (10 mCi) of fluciclovine is 8 
mSv (22 microSv/MBq). For an administered activity of 370 MBq (10 mCi), the highest-magnitude 
radiation doses are delivered to the pancreas, cardiac wall, and uterine wall: 38 mGy, 19 mGy, and 17 
mGy, respectively. 
Human dosimetry data for Ga-PSMA from Joint EANM and SNMMI Procedure Guideline for Prostate 
Cancer Imaging: Version 1.0 [ 42]. Based on the available studies, the coefficient for effective dose from 
68Ga-PSMA averages is 2.0 × 10−2 mSv/MBq, resulting in an average effective radiation dose of 3 mSv 
for an administered activity of 150 MBq. For a typi[INVESTIGATOR_170531] 5 mCi (185 MBq) that we will be 
administering, the effective dose equivalent would be 3.[ADDRESS_1039402] dose are 
urinary bladder wall (0.13-0.173 mSv/MBq) and kidney (0.122-0.262 mSv/MBq).
2) Allergic or other reactions to radiotracer: Although the risk is extremely small, it is possible to develop 
an allergic reaction to the fluciclovine or Ga-PSMA.  This can result in hives, rash, itching and difficulty 
breathing which may require emergency medical treatment. There have been no previous instances of 
allergic reaction. In prior studies with both radiotracers, the risk of adverse events which can be attributed 
to the radiotracer is extremely low, and of minimal medical impact such as burning at IV site or dysgeusia. 
 
Version 1.0;  Page 11 of 28; 29 July [ZIP_CODE]) Risk related to IV for PET scan: A small amount of radioactive material will be injected by [CONTACT_5640] a 
hand-held needle or a machine. Such injections are generally quite safe, but any injection involves some 
risks. The injection could harm a nerve, artery or vein, or cause infection. The radioactive material could 
also leak from veins, causing swelling and discomfort. 
4) False positive on PET: It is possible that a lesion identified on the experimental PET procedures may 
be false positive, thus potentially leading to an inappropriate change in stage. Yet, no lesion will be acted 
upon which could change therapeutic intent unless confirmed via histology or advanced imaging such as 
MR for certain bone lesions. See below for risks associated with biopsy or MR. 
Non-Study Specific Procedure Risks:
1) Biopsy associated risk: If a suspect lesion is identified on either or both PET scans, definitive histologic 
proof in the safest manner possible will be sought if clinically indicated. Risks of biopsy, though small in 
expert hands, include bleeding, infection and even rarely death. Note that before biopsy is considered, 
careful scrutiny of the already obtained CT or MR will be undertaken to determine if an unsuspected 
anatomic correlate can be identified. This will then prompt a discussion between the patient and primary 
clinician on the benefits versus risks to definitively determine if a metastasis is present which could affect 
therapy. Biopsy will be undertaken in the least invasive manner possible as a standard of care procedure, 
reimbursed by [CONTACT_730788].  
2) MR: If a lesion is not deemed safe or possible to biopsy, MR may then be performed (e.g. for bone or 
liver). MR, even with the administration of Gadolinium is considered a safe and effective noninvasive 
imaging procedure. In addition to the small possible reactions to contrast material if used, claustrophobia 
while in the magnet is a potential risk, as well as reaction from metal within the body. Yet at Emory, 
special screening is performed before MR to determine if the patient has tattoos or any metal items in 
the body such as implants, pacemakers, clips or shrapnel, to make sure the MRI scan is done safely.
 
Version 1.0;  Page 12 of 28; 29 July [ZIP_CODE]. Objectives and Endpoints
3.1 Study Objectives:
Our major goal in this proposed investigation is to use advanced molecular imaging to better 
detect metastases in patients with invasive lobular cancer. 
Specific Aim 1: Improve detection of metastasis with fluciclovine and Ga-PSMA PET versus best 
standard of care conventional imaging, as confirmed with histology. We will image [ADDRESS_1039403] either: a) clinical or imaging suspi[INVESTIGATOR_759108]; or b) proven metastatic 
disease but in whom there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_759109]. Abnormal foci which correlate to anatomic lesions previously unsuspected on conventional 
imaging will undergo optional biopsy as clinically indicated in the safest manner possible (if not already 
done) to determine the verified detection rate of metastatic disease.
Specific Aim 2: Determine concordance and discordance of ILC detection with Ga-PSMA versus 
fluciclovine PET, as confirmed with histology. We will compare verified detection rates for 
metastasis between fluciclovine and PSMA PET modalities. This may necessitate a second biopsy of a 
distant lesion discordant between the 2 PET techniques. We will also analyze images for biodistribution 
in the primary lesion(s) for both radiotracers.
Exploratory Aim 3: Establish the role of molecular detection by [CONTACT_759123]3CA, ESR1, HER2, and AKT1 in characterizing the degree of tumor burden as identified by 
[CONTACT_759124]/or tumor neovasculature receptor imaging [ 12]. We will collect 
peripheral blood for ctDNA in all patients and determine if ctDNA correlates with presence or absence of 
metastases and tumor burden as identified by [CONTACT_255959] (metabolic) and/or PSMA (angiogenesis) PET. 
3.2 Study Endpoints:
Primary endpoint: 
Determine verified detection rate for metastasis of invasive lobular cancer using fluciclovine PET 
and PSMA PET for imaging (Specific Aims 1 and 2)
Secondary endpoints: 
Correlation of ctDNA results with presence or absence of metastasis (Specific Aim 3)
Correlation of ctDNA results with results of imaging (Specific Aim 3)
 
Version 1.0;  Page 13 of 28; [ADDRESS_1039404] either: a) 
clinical or imaging suspi[INVESTIGATOR_759108]; b) biopsy proven metastatic disease but in whom 
there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_759115]. All patients will 
be recruited from the Winship Glenn Family Breast Cancer Program at any Emory facility. All patients will 
undergo Ga PSMA PET followed at minimum of 10 hours (to allow for radiotracer decay) by [CONTACT_472537]. (This may also happen in the opposite order, in which case 20 hours after fluciclovine will be needed 
to allow for decay.) There is no need for randomization since each patient will undergo both imaging 
techniques, and the results will be interpreted blindly. Thus, radiopharmacy scheduling will dictate the 
order of the radiotracers to ensure the patient will undergo both imaging modalities in the shortest time 
frame. Two nuclear medicine physician co-investigators, Drs. Schuster and Muzahir, will independently 
interpret the 20 cases, each reading half (the other reading the other half) of the fluciclovine and PSMA 
images (to avoid bias in always reading the same type of imaging). The readers will be blinded to all 
imaging including the other PET. All suspi[INVESTIGATOR_759116] a 
6 point Likert scale (where 1 = definitely benign and 6 = definitely malignant). Both the primary lesion and 
all suspected metastases will be measured on an advanced workstation and metabolic uptake 
parameters (SUV, MTV, TLA) recorded. After both studies have been interpreted blindly, the third nuclear 
medicine physician co-investigator, [CONTACT_759151], will blindly interpret deidentified PET studies on every 
patient (alternating for a total of 10 each fluciclovine and Ga-PSMA PET). Afterward, an unblinded 
reconciliation interpretation will take place with all [ADDRESS_1039405] showing Ga-PSMA, then fluciclovine; [ADDRESS_1039406] manner possible 
(if not already done) as clinically indicated after discussion between the primary oncologist and patient. 
Preference for biopsy will be given to discordant lesions. Uncommonly, in some lesions not deemed safe 
to biopsy, characteristic appearance on correlative imaging will be accepted as truth (e.g., MRI for certain 
skeletal or liver lesions). In select cases, a second biopsy of a discordant distant lesion may be required. 
For example, if there are 2 potentially impactful lesions which are fluciclovine positive/PSMA negative 
and fluciclovine negative/PSMA positive, respectively. Note that before biopsy is considered, careful 
scrutiny of the already obtained CT or MR will be undertaken to determine if an unsuspected anatomic 
correlate can be identified. This will then prompt a discussion between the patient and the referring 
clinician co-investigator on the benefits versus risks to definitively determine if a metastasis is present 
which could affect therapy. Biopsy may be undertaken in the least invasive manner as standard of care 
as clinically indicated, reimbursed by [CONTACT_730788]. Uptake parameters will be correlated with all 
proven primary, locoregional, and distant lesions. Verified detection rates for metastasis will be calculated 
for each modality. 
In addition, we will collect 20 ml peripheral blood for ctDNA analysis in all patients at visit 1 (or possibly 
2) to be initially processed and stored by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Torres’ lab for off-site specialty analysis. Plasma levels of 
ctDNA will be measured using a targeted [ADDRESS_1039407] point mutations including mutations in 
PIK3CA, ESR1, HER2, and AKT1, genes associated with hormone therapy resistance and ILC [ 38, 39]. 
We will examine ctDNA results for association with presence or absence of locoregional metastasis on 
imaging as confirmed with histology, presence or absence of distant metastasis on imaging as confirmed 
with histology, correlation of presence or absence and absolute ctDNA with PET uptake.
 
Version 1.0;  Page 14 of 28; [ADDRESS_1039408] of care conventional imaging (usually CT or MR and possible bone scan), and which 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_759117]. We also hypothesize that receptor 
directed PSMA imaging of tumor associated neovasculature in ILC will reveal unique information 
to complement metabolic interrogation with fluciclovine PET. Improved staging will facilitate 
more appropriate management decisions.
To test these hypotheses with the highest scientific rigor, we propose a feasibility trial with 
fluciclovine and Ga-PSMA PET strategies centered on detection of metastasis in patients with advanced 
ILC using histology as the gold standard. As an exploratory aim, we will also correlate the occurrence of 
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) mutations including PIK3CA, ESR1, HER2, and AKT1 with presence of 
metastasis and tumor burden. We will explore if a multiparametric strategy with ctDNA and imaging will 
help define which patients should undergo molecular imaging and also identify those who may forego 
biopsy if distant lesions are detected on imaging. We expect this pi[INVESTIGATOR_759106] a definitive NIH sponsored trial developi[INVESTIGATOR_759107].
4.3 Justification for Dose
The doses administered for each radiotracer: 10 mCi fluciclovine (18F) and [ADDRESS_1039409] in the case of future required analysis. There will be no other 
study specific visits after the second PET scan (visit 2), though the patient will be called by [CONTACT_759131] 5-10 business days to ensure no delayed AEs occurred. 
 
Version 1.0;  Page 15 of 28; [ADDRESS_1039410] cancer patients are seen yearly at Winship, with approximately 20% of lobular 
histology (280). Of these, approximately 100-150 are advanced. Thus at a conservative recruitment rate 
of 10% (10-15 patients/year), successful accrual is highly feasible. Lobular cancer tends to present at a 
higher stage. Based on historical averages, we expect that 31% of patients will present with Stage 3 and 
37% of patients with Stage [ADDRESS_1039411] approximately 10% dropout either before completion 
of both PET scans or after PET scanning and before biopsy.

Version 1.0;  Page 16 of 28; [ADDRESS_1039413] in preparation for the fluciclovine PET 
scan (not required for PSMA). However final written informed consent will be obtained before the PET 
scan. Participants will also be assigned an identification number for screening purposes; data collected 
during the screening process will also be recorded using that number. Patients will then be registered in 
OnCore through usual Winship and department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences guidelines. No 
randomization will be performed. Blinding will only take place for initial study interpretation before 
consensus interpretation by [CONTACT_759133]. 
7.  Study Intervention
Radiotracer production: Blue Earth Diagnostics, Ltd manufacturers of fluciclovine has pledged support 
with gratis radiotracer unit doses supplied from PETNET Solutions. 
Telix Pharmaceuticals (US) Inc, manufacturer of Ga-PSMA, has pledged support with gratis radiotracer 
kits which will be compounded by [CONTACT_759134]. 
Fluciclovine
PETNET Solutions, located on the Emory campus, produces commercial doses of fluciclovine which is 
FDA-approved for the detection of recurrent prostate cancer.  Unit doses of this material will be provided 
for the study. The IRB has decided that a formal IND exemption is not required. 
The following is provided as justification for IND exemption: This is an early phase study in which [ADDRESS_1039414]. Schuster’s existing IND 072437. Yet, we will now be administering FDA 
approved commercial doses supplied by [CONTACT_759135]. Thus, this is off-label research of an FDA approved product for recurrent prostate 
cancer. The patient will undergo pregnancy testing within [ADDRESS_1039415] been studied with fluciclovine under our IND without complication 
and this data had been used to obtain FDA approval in terms of safety. Thus, we believe an IND 
exemption is in order since: 1) The investigation is not intended to be reported to FDA as a well-controlled 
study in support of a new indication for use nor intended to be used to support any other significant 
change in the labeling for the drug; 2) The drug that is undergoing investigation is lawfully marketed as a 
prescription drug product, and the investigation is not intended to support a significant change in the 
advertising for the product; 3) The investigation is conducted in compliance with the requirements 
concerning the promotion and sale of drugs; 4) The investigation is conducted in compliance with the 
requirements for IRB review and informed consent; 5) The investigation does not intend to invoke [ADDRESS_1039416]. Schuster’s IND #[ADDRESS_1039417] and Ziegler 50 mCi Pharmaceutical Grade 
68Ge/68Ga Generator (or equivalent) located at our in-house radiopharmacy and combined in a vial with 
the premixed lyophilized product including peptide. Our existing PSMA IND #143137 has been amended 
with the study protocol.

Note that this order may be reversed in certain patients depending on patient and radiopharmacy 
schedule.
PSMA
Patients will undergo PSMA PET-CT after 5 mci (3-7 mCi) IV dose of 68Ga-PSMA. Then after an uptake 
period of approximately [ADDRESS_1039418] IV injection of 10 mCi fluciclovine will be completed from pelvis to skull 
base at approximately 3 minutes per table position. Fasting except for water (and medications) will be 
required for at least 4 hours before the PET scan. 
B. Circulating Tumor DNA
Step #[ADDRESS_1039419] PET scan. 
1. 20ml of peripheral blood (or two [ADDRESS_1039420] Streck tubes) is collected by [CONTACT_759136] a peripheral access point or from a central line by [CONTACT_31809].
2. Tubes are inverted about 10 times immediately after collection.

2. When outside the freezer, such as when transferring to a different freezer in another location or 
preparing for shipment, boxes containing tubes should be covered with dry ice.
3. Freezer or dry ice specimen storage container temperature must be checked and monitored. 
Document any deviation from protocol.
4. The freezer or dry ice storage box containing the specimens will either be locked or in a secure 
area accessible only to authorized study staff.
5. A backup storage plan will be in place in the event of freezer failure.
8. Study assessments and Procedures.
8.[ADDRESS_1039423] of Care Procedures
1) Conventional imaging is broadly defined as mammography, ultrasound, bone scan, FDG PET, CT 
and/or MR: Any or all of these imaging studies may have been performed as standard of care at 
enrollment. These are not under control of study design. Conventional imaging and reports within 6 
months of enrollment (ideally 2 months) will be reviewed to correlate to PET imaging. No additional 
interpretation will take place. Imaging reports for these studies will be utilized for comparative analysis. 
2) Biopsy: After the PET studies, patients with abnormal findings on the PET scans will have the most 
distant and accessible lesion identified so that the patient may undergo biopsy in the safest manner 
possible (if not already done) as clinically indicated. Preference for biopsy will be given to discordant 
lesions. In some lesions not deemed safe to biopsy, characteristic appearance on correlative imaging will 
be accepted as truth (e.g., MRI for certain skeletal or liver lesions). In select cases, a second biopsy of a 
discordant distant lesion may be required. Note that before biopsy is considered, careful scrutiny of the 
already obtained CT or MR will be undertaken to determine if an unsuspected anatomic correlate can be 
identified. This will then prompt a discussion between the patient and the referring clinician co-investigator 
on the benefits versus risks to definitively determine if a metastasis is present which could affect therapy. 
Biopsy will be undertaken in the least invasive manner as standard of care, reimbursed by [CONTACT_759137].
3) Therapy: All subsequent therapy for breast cancer will be standard of care and beyond the scope of 
this investigation. 
 
Version 1.0;  Page 19 of 28; [ADDRESS_1039424]
Image Analysis: Two nuclear medicine physician co-investigators, Drs. Schuster and Muzahir, will 
independently interpret the 20 cases, each reading half (the other reading the other half) of the fluciclovine 
and PSMA images (to avoid bias in always reading the same type of imaging). The readers will be blinded 
to all imaging including the other PET. All suspi[INVESTIGATOR_759118] a 6 point Likert scale (where 1 = definitely benign and 6 = definitely malignant). Both the 
primary lesion and all suspected metastases will be measured on an advanced workstation and metabolic 
uptake parameters (SUV, MTV, TLA) recorded. After both studies have been interpreted blindly, the third 
nuclear medicine physician co-investigator, [CONTACT_759151], will blindly interpret deidentified PET studies on 
every patient (alternating for a total of 10 each fluciclovine and PSMA PET). Afterward, an unblinded 
reconciliation interpretation will take place with all [ADDRESS_1039425] showing Ga-PSMA, then fluciclovine; [ADDRESS_1039426] cancer. Concordant and discordant lesions 
between each PET study and conventional imaging will be reported and potential biopsy sites, if any, 
recommended. 
Correlation of histology with images: Uptake parameters as above will be correlated with all proven 
primary, locoregional, and distant lesions.
ctDNA analysis: Plasma levels of ctDNA will be measured using targeted assays to detect point 
mutations including mutations in PIK3CA, ESR1, HER2, and AKT1, genes associated with hormone 
therapy resistance and ILC [ 12, 38, 39, 43]. Because ILC are predominantly hormone receptor positive, 
hormone resistance is particularly relevant because it predicts for higher rate of distant metastasis. [CONTACT_759152], will provide expertise in ctDNA analyses. Deidentified specimens will be shipped to the 
Circulating Tumor Cell Center at [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_759119].    
Correlation of ctDNA results with results of imaging: We will examine ctDNA results for association 
with presence or absence of locoregional metastasis on imaging as confirmed with histology, presence 
or absence of distant metastasis on imaging as confirmed with histology, correlation of presence or 
absence and absolute ctDNA with PET uptake as determined by [CONTACT_759138]: SUVmax, 
SUVmean, SUVpeak, Total Lesion Activity for the index primary, locoregional and distant metastatic 
lesion if any, and correlation to summed indices as a reflection of total metabolic tumor burden. ctDNA 
will also be correlated with CI. 
 
Version 1.0;  Page 20 of 28; 29 July 202010. Statistical considerations 
Specific Aims 1 and 2
Analysis plan: The objectives of Aims 1 and 2 are to compare verified detection rates between 
fluciclovine and PSMA PET versus conventional imaging, as confirmed with histology (Aim 1), and 
determine concordance and discordance of ILC detection with PSMA versus fluciclovine PET, as 
confirmed with histology (Aim 2). Paired detection rates will be assessed using McNemar’s test.  
Detection rates will be reported for each method, and 95% confidence intervals will be estimated using 
the Clopper-Pearson approach. Rates of concordant/discordant observations will be reported. The 
Likert rating-scale data also allows for determination of sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and Receiver 
Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) values to compare. 
Sample size and power: We will image [ADDRESS_1039427] size. Thus, there is no power analysis 
for the study aims. If we find a 20% difference in detection rate with a 40% discordant rate, we would 
require 67 patients in a larger study to achieve 80% power with a Type I error rate of 0.05 using 
McNemar’s test. Discordant rates of 50% and 60% with a difference in detection rate of 20% would 
require 83 and 99 patients, respectively, to achieve 80% power. If the difference in detection rate is 
15%, the required sample sizes would range from 118 to 175 for discordant rates of 40% to 60% to 
achieve 80% power.  If the difference in detection rate is 25%, the required sample sizes would range 
from 42 to 63 for discordant rates of 40% to 60% to achieve 80% power.
Exploratory Aim 3
Analysis plan: In Aim 3, ctDNA parameters will be summarized descriptively using mean, median, 
min/max, IQR, and standard deviation. ctDNA will be correlated with PET uptake parameters using 
Pearson’s or Spearman’s correlation coefficient (where appropriate), as well as chi-squared tests, 
Fisher’s exact tests, or ANOVA if any variables are further categorized. In addition, generalized linear 
models will be fit to evaluate the relationship between ctDNA parameters and PET uptake parameters, 
controlling for relevant characteristics.  
Sample size and power: We will image [ADDRESS_1039428] that correlation coefficient vs. a null value 
of 0 with 80% power and a Type I error of 0.05.  We would need [ADDRESS_1039429] a correlation 
coefficient of 0.4 vs. a null value of 0 to achieve 80% power.
11. Adverse Events:  List and Reporting Requirements 
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical trial, are done to 
ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future studies using 
similar agents. Adverse events are reported in a routine manner at scheduled times during a trial (please 
follow directions for routine reporting provided in the full Data Safety and Monitoring Plan (DSMP)). 
Additionally, certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner for timely monitoring of 
patient safety and care. The following sections provide information about expedited reporting.
Special note for radiotracers given during this trial: The risk of AEs or SAEs from PET 
radiotracers is exceedingly low. A significant shift from baseline which can be attributable 
to the radiotracer injection and not the patient’s medical condition will be considered an 
unexpected AE. An event greater than [ADDRESS_1039430] scan for fluciclovine and 10 hours for 
Ga-PSMA will not be considered a related to study procedure AE since the radiotracer has 
effectively decayed by 20 hours and 10 hours respectively. Reporting will follow relevant FDA 
and manufacturer guidelines as outlined below.
A serious adverse event is any medical occurrence which is fatal, is immediately life threatening, requires 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or prolongs an existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]), results in persistent significant disability or 
incapacity, is a congenital abnormality or a birth defect, or is considered medically significant by a 
physician.
 
Version 1.0;  Page 21 of 28; 29 July 2020The definition of serious adverse event (experience) also includes important medical event. Medical and 
scientific judgment will be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other 
situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46182]. These should also usually be considered serious. Examples 
of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse.
Attribution:  The determination of whether an adverse event is related to a study imaging agent.  The 
categories are:
Definite:  The adverse event is clearly related to the study imaging agent.
Probable:  The adverse event is likely related to the study imaging agent.
Possible:  The adverse event may be related to the study imaging agent.
Unlikely:  The adverse event is doubtfully related to the study imaging agent.
Unrelated:  The adverse event is clearly not related to the study imaging agent.
Unexpected Adverse Event:  An adverse event, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the 
applicable product information.  
Investigational Agent:  A protocol drug administered under an Investigational New Drug Application (IND).  
Commercial Agent:  An agent not provided under an IND but obtained from a commercial source.
Determination of Reporting Requirements
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) whether the patient has received an 
investigational or commercial agent; 2) the characteristics of the adverse event including the grade 
(severity), the relationship to the study imaging agent (attribution), and the prior experience 
(expectedness) of the adverse event; 3) the Phase (1, 2, or 3) of the trial; and 4) whether or not 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60778].
Steps to determine if an adverse event is to be reported in an expedited manner:
Step 1: Identify the type of event using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Event Reporting 
Version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0). The CTCAE v5.0 provides descriptive terminology and a grading scale for 
each adverse event listed. A copy of the CTCAE v5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP home page 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov). Additionally, if assistance is needed, the NCl has an Index to the CTCAE v5.[ADDRESS_1039431] 
access to a copy of the CTCAE v5.0.
Step 2: Grade the event using the NCI CTCAE  v5.0.
Step 3: Determine whether the adverse event is related to the protocol imaging agent (investigational or 
commercial). 
Step 4: Determine the prior experience of the adverse event. Expected events are those that have been 
previously identified as resulting from administration of the agent. An adverse event is considered 
unexpected, for expedited reporting purposes only, when either the type of event or the severity of the 
event is not listed in the investigator brochure for an investigational agent or the drug package insert for 
a commercial agent.
Step 5: Review Expedited reporting requirements below to determine if there are any protocol-specific 
requirements for expedited reporting of specific adverse events that require special monitoring.
Step 6: Determine if the protocol treatment given prior to the adverse event included investigational 
agent(s), a commercial agent(s), or a combination of investigational and commercial agents.

The DSMC will review the charts of 10% of patients enrolled to the study and two of the first [ADDRESS_1039438] to the investigator or other study-related 
personnel.  
As with our ongoing clinical trial, for the current proposal we will adhere strictly to Winship’s Data Safety 
Monitoring Plan which is provided in detail at the following link: 
https://winshipcancer.emory.edu/research/clinical-trials-office/data-and-safety-monitoring-
committee.html
Data Safety Monitoring Board: 
Note that our proposed trial is an early phase clinical trial that will be conducted completely within the 
Emory system, so a formal and independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) [which is required for 
multi-site studies or Phase III trials] is not required for our proposal. As described above, the DSMC of 
Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University will oversee the conduct of our study.  
Fidelity to Protocol and Data Integrity:
Clinical trial performance and fidelity to the protocol, will be monitored by [CONTACT_759142].  Integrity of the data will be maintained by [CONTACT_759143]-review internally 
by [CONTACT_759144]-investigators in Radiation Oncology, Radiology/Nuclear Medicine, Surgical Oncology, 
and Medical Oncology. 
13. Ethics and Protection Of Human Subjects
The study will be approved by [CONTACT_759145]. 
To maintain patient confidentiality, medical records will be accessed only by [CONTACT_759146] (e.g. CRC). Partial HIPAA waiver will be obtained to allow screening of provider schedules for 
identification of potentially eligible research subjects. Upon medical record review and identification of a 
potentially eligible research subject, patient's full name, MRN, EMPI, and full dates (e.g. DOB, procedure 
dates, admission dates, etc.) will be stored on a screening log and used by [CONTACT_759147]. The screening log will be kept on the HIPAA compliant shared folder and will 
be accessible only to limited IRB approved study personnel (e.g CRC). Sensitive data will always be 
stored on the HIPAA compliant shared folder and will never be stored on local or portable drives that are 
not encrypted per Emory IS standards. 
 
Version 1.0;  Page 24 of 28; 29 July 2020Each study participant will be assigned a unique study identification (ID) number at the time that informed 
consent is given. Personal identifying information, study data, including the unique study ID, will be 
entered in the Microsoft Database that will be kept on the HIPAA compliant shared folder accessible to 
approved study personnel only. Only de-identified data will be shared with those outside the study team 
to ensure adequate protection of sensitive data.
Study identifiers will be kept indefinitely. 
To maintain participant confidentiality, no identifying information about any of the study participants will 
be published. Any data published (including demographic information about the study sample as a whole) 
will be in aggregate/summary form only. 
Note also that [CONTACT_759153] of MSKCC and [CONTACT_562655] of the Circulating Tumor Cell 
Center at [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], will only be exposed to deidentified data, samples, 
and images. As such they would not be considered “engaged” in human subjects research. As a 
result, they do not require inclusion on the IRB per our consultation with the Emory IRB.
Incidental Findings
a.   All incidental findings noted by [CONTACT_759148] a co-investigator and documented in the electronic medical record. 
b.   The oncologist will educate the patient about the nature of the incidental finding, how to seek 
care from a clinician or specialist, obtaining health insurance to secure treatment, and/or 
referral to a clinical specialist, if one is required. 
c.   Language to this effect is present in the consent form.
PET findings will be used for research purposes within the context of the clinical trial as noted above. All 
incidental findings will be recorded in the clinical research form and emergent incidental findings will be 
communicated to the patient’s physician who is also an investigator on this study.
Compensation for time and effort: Each patient will be compensated $50 as per diem for travel expenses 
per scan (total of $100 for both scans).

Title: Adductor Canal Block versus Periarticular Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_134717]: [REMOVED] 
07/01/[ADDRESS_152586] decade, the widespread use of regional anesthesia in total knee arthroplasty (TKA), has led to improvements in pain 
control, more rapid functional recovery, and reduced length of stay.[ADDRESS_152587] transitioned from 
femoral n erve blocks (proximal femoral nerve) to adductor canal blocks (distal femoral nerve) to   maintain a sensory block for 
pain control, while minimizing any motor blockade that is typi[INVESTIGATOR_134718], which would hamper  
rehabilitati on, and increase risk of falls.2  In addition t o regional blocks, which are typi[INVESTIGATOR_134719], 
some surgeons favor an intraoperative periarticular anesthetic injection (PAI), typi[INVESTIGATOR_134720], either in conjuct ion 
with an adductor canal block, or independently.3–5   In theory, PAI has the advantage of a comparable sensory nerve block as an 
adductor canal block, without the disadvantages and risks, which include prolonged quadriceps weakness, fall risk, and neurologic dysfunction.
3,6  The purpose of this randomized control trial is to compare the efficacy of adductor canal blocks and 
periarticular bupi [INVESTIGATOR_134721] a total knee arthroplasty.    
Specific Aim:  To determine whether periarticular bupi[INVESTIGATOR_134722] , or 
combined adductor canal blocks and periarticular bupi[INVESTIGATOR_134723],  for post -operative pain control following TKA.  
We hypothesize that standard periarticular bupi[INVESTIGATOR_134724] -operative 
pain management following TKA.  The prim ary outcome in this study will be pain scores in the immediate post -operative period 
(post -operative day [ADDRESS_152588] -operative day 3).   Secondary outcomes include post -operative narcotic use, length of stay, 
range of knee flexion, and activity level.   Results from this study will help determine the most appropriate regional pain 
management strategy for patients undergoing a TKA.  
 
2. Research Strategy  
Significance  
Over 600,000 total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) are performed each year in the [LOCATION_002],  with expectations for greater than 4 
million/year by [CONTACT_2892] 2030.7  Since the onset of TKAs in the 1960’s, there have been developments that have improved both 
functionality and patient satisfaction.  In the last decade, a focus has been made on multimodal pain management protocols, m ore 
rapid functional recovery, reduce d length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], and minimizing side effects of treatment while maintaining function 
and durability.[ADDRESS_152589] transitioned to  adductor canal blocks (distal femoral nerve) to  maintain a 
sensory block for pain control, while minimizing any motor blockade that is typi[INVESTIGATOR_134718], 
which would hamper rehabilitation, and increase risk of falls.2  However, even with a more distal femoral nerve block, the risk of 
motor involvement is still present.   
Due to thi s potential risk, some surgeons prefer a less invasive regional pain management strategy, such as a periarticular 
anesthetic injection (PAI) .  Unlike nerve block s, which are typi[INVESTIGATOR_134725], 
PAIs are administered intraoperatively, usually just prior to closure.  In theory, PAI has the advantage of a comparable sensory block as an adductor canal block, without the disadvantages and risks, which include prolonged quadriceps weakness, fall risk , 
and neurol ogic dysfunction.
[ADDRESS_152590] study to compare 
these two treatment modalities, and, therefore, has the potential to change perioperative treatment algorithms in TKA.   
Approach 
Study Design:  
This study will be a randomized  control trial.  There will be 3  study groups:  
1) Adductor canal block alone (ACB)  
2) Periarticular Standard  Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_134726] (SB)  
3) Adductor canal block + Periarticular Standard  Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_9360] (ACB+SB)  
There will be [ADDRESS_152591] of care, the adductor canal blocks (15 cc’s of 0.5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]) will be performed by [CONTACT_134732]-operative block area, just prior to surgery.  As is standard of care, the periarticular injections (5 0 cc’s 
of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] ) will be performed intraoperatively, prior to wound closure, by [CONTACT_134733].  Floor staff and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_134727].  Patients will be blinded to the intraoperative medication (SB versus LB), but  not the pre -
operative block.  Neither the surgeon nor surgical team (including anesthesiology) will be blinded to the treatment group.   
Post-operatively, visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores will be recorded two times/day from POD0 through POD3.  This w ill be 
the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes monitored in the immediate post -operative period will include:  
Activity level: Steps taken in daily physical therapy sessions will be recorded.  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556]:  All patients will have the same opi[INVESTIGATOR_134728].  The amount of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_134729].  In addition, all patients will receive toradol, and then celecoxib as part of the standard of 
care multi -modal pain management for TKAs at this institution.  
Range of knee flexion: Range of knee flexion, for both passive and active motion, will be recorded prior to discharge, and at 3 
week follow -up for all groups.  
Length of stay:  Total length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_134730].  In addition, location of discharge (home versus rehabilitation center), will be recorded.  
Inclusion Criteria  
All patients undergoing a unilateral primary total knee arthroplasty under the care of the two senior arthroplasty surgeons.   
Potential Difficulties and Limitations  
A large randomized clinical trial creates the potential for coordination issues.  The study locations include the preoperativ e area, 
operating room, inpatient floor, and outpatient office.  In order to ensure seamless  coordination between study staff and the care 
team, we will have a designated study coordinator.  The study coordinator will ensure that study execution and data collection 
with appropriate timing and location.  Any issues that arise at the beginning the study, will be addressed immediately by 
[CONTACT_134734].  
Statistical Procedures:  
 
A power analysis reveals that 50 patients per group will be adequately powered to identify a VAS difference of 0.5 between 
groups, with β=0.8.  VAS pain scores and continuous measures will be compared with unpaired student t -tests.  Narcotic 
equivalents will be compared with a Mann -Whitney U test.  Statistical significance will be defined as p<0.05.

Title:  Contribution of Endothelin- 1 to Exercise Intolerance in Heart Failure  
Study ID: [REMOVED] 
Date:  December 17 , 202 1 
  
Study Objective: T o compare the effect  of Endothelin- 1 on limb blood flow in pat ients with heart 
failure  and healthy , age mat ched controls .  
 
Study Design : Single arm, unblinded.  Limb blood flow will be determined in patients w ith heart 
failure and healthy,  age-matched controls.      
 
Study Methods:  
Limb Blood Flow:  An ultrasound Doppler system (Logiq 7, GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, 
Wisconsin, [LOCATION_003]) equipped with a linear array transducer opera ting at an imaging frequency of 7-
8 MHz and a Doppler frequency of 4 -5 MHz will be used for determination of femoral artery 
diameter and blood velocity . 
Study drug:  The ET A selective antagonist BQ -123 (0.6 mcg/dl/min) will be administered intra-
arterially (common femoral artery) rest and during knee extensor exercise (0, 5, 10, and 15 Watts).   
 
Statistical Analysis : Mixed  model with repeated measures , with drug infusion at each work load 
is the dependent variable and HF (yes, no) and work load are the major predictor variables, with age and gender as additional explanatory variables . In a case where multivariate analysis is 
ultimately deemed appropriate and of interest, but the data  do not satisfy the assumptions of 
normal distribution, we will invoke the central limit theorem and perform the bootstrap technique 
to estimate the bias and variation in the data and then correct accordingly. Because of the 
importance of ensuring a potent ial positive finding is not missed, no statistical adjustment will be 
made for multiple primary comparisons.

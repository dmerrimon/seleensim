Property of  [COMPANY_011] - strictly confidential Page No: 11 of 70 Treatment cycle to be administered every 2 weeks. 
Study treatment (aflibercept and FOLFIRI) has to be 
discontinued upon documentation of disease progression.  
If FOLFIRI (or either of its components) is permanently 
discontinued, then aflibercept should be continued until 
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or patient’s refusal of further treatment.  
If aflibercept is permanently discontinued, then FOLFIRI can 
be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or patient’s refusal of further treatment.  
The end of treatment will be the date of the last treatment 
administration, either aflibercept or FOLFIRI whichever comes last.
Patient treatment after aflibercept and FOLFIRI permanent 
discontinuation is at investigator discretion.  
Dose reduction and/or treatment delay and/or treatment 
discontinuation are planned in case of severe toxicity. 
Therapeutic use of Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-
CSF) may be considered (if consistent with the local institutional treatment practice), upon occurrence of a first epi[INVESTIGATOR_254335] >
3 neutropenia and as secondary 
prophylaxis for subsequent cycles, in patients who may be at 
increased risk for neutropenia complications. 
The starting dose of irinotecan and/or 5-FU components of 
FOLFIRI regimen should take into consideration toxicities from prior regimens received by [CONTACT_492434] (like UGT1A1*28 allele status, when known). 
In case drugs (5FU) administered during previous chemotherapy regimen were reduced due to toxicity, the decision to administer or not the full starting dose of FOLFIRI (irinotecan, 5FU continuous and/or bolus infusion) will be left to the investigator decision based on his/her clinical 
judgement of patient benefit at time of inclusion (provided all 
patient eligibility criteria are fulfilled). To start with a reduced dose of FOLFIRI may be considered. 
PRIMARY STUDY ENDPOINT 
SECONDARY ENDPOINT Primary endpoint:
- Safety: 
o treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
will be assessed: terminology (according to 
MedDRA - Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities), frequency and severity (according to NCI CTCAE V4.0), seriousness and relatedness; 
o Laboratory abnormalities according to NCI-
CTC V4.0. 
Secondary endpoint:
- Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) assessed by  
[CONTACT_492435] N° AFLIBC06097 VERSION 1.0/ 10 Feb 2012 
Property of  [COMPANY_011] - strictly confidential Page No: 12 of 70 using changes from baseline in scores derived from 
the following questionnaires: 
o EORTC QLQ-C30 (version 3);  
o EQ-5DTM (version 4) 
Exploratory endpoint (optional):
- Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) assessed by 
[CONTACT_492436]: 
o EORTC QLQ CR29 (disease specific 
supplement to QLQ-C30). 
SAFETY CRITERIA  Data collected for the assessment of safety: 
- Number of cycles administered, duration of dosing in 
weeks, cumulative dose received and reason for End of Treatment (EOT). Dose delays, omission and reductions will also be analyzed. 
- Adverse Events (AEs)/Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS No formal sample size calculation is performed. 
The safety population (all included patients who received at least part of one dose of treatment) will be used to document 
safety.
Only descriptive summaries will be provided. 
Interim analyses are planned during the course of the study, 
in order to obtain preliminary results on baseline 
characteristics, HRQL and safety data. 
DURATION OF STUDY PERIOD The study is planned to be initiated in the second quarter of 
2012 in Europe and in the [LOCATION_002], simultaneously or 
sequentially in the other involved countries.  
In each country, patient recruitment will end when aflibercept 
(ZALTRAP) becomes commercially available (i.e. accessible 
to the patient as per each country regulation). Patients 
already included will continue to be treated until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, Investigator’s decision or patient’s refusal of further treatment.

microangiopathy should be considered. 
d) Concomitant medications:  G-CSF, pre-medications, antidiarrheal, Vitamin K antagonist, heparins, antihypertensive medications, SAEs 
corrective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and any further anti cancer treatment started within [ADDRESS_633414] treatment administration (aflibercept /Folfiri), should 
be documented into e-CRF.  
e) Treatment with aflibercept  will start on Cycle [ADDRESS_633415] before FOLFIRI administration and then repeated every 2 weeks. 
f) Adverse Events (AEs),  regardless of seriousness or relationship to study treatment (aflibercept/Folfiri), will be collected from the time the 
patient signs the informed consent form up to [ADDRESS_633416] treatment administration (aflibercept or Folfiri). Followi ng the 30 day 
EOT visit all ongoing SAEs (regardless of relationship with study treatment) as well as ongoing related AEs and new related SAE s will have 
to be collected and followed till resolut ion/stabilisation (stabilisation being define d as an event ongoing without any change for at least 3 
months). Vital signs or ECG abnormalities are to be recorded as Adverse Events only if they are medically relevant: symptomatic , requiring 
corrective treatment, leading to discontinuation/dose modification (reduction and/or delay) and/or fulfilling a seriousness cri terion. 
Laboratories abnormalities are to be recorded as AE only if they are serious or leading to discontinuation/dose modification. 
g) Health-Related Quality of Life (QoL questionnaires):  to be self-administered by [CONTACT_492437], prior to informing the patient about 
disease evolution, before the next study treatment and before any other assessment is performed. A key person (e.g., research n urse) at 
each center should be responsible for questionnaire data collection, in order to optimize compliance of the patient and to ensu re 
completeness of the data. The collection will  be done at baseline (before first treatment administration), before the treatment  administration 
at the beginning (D1) of every odd cycle (cycle 3, 5, etc) and at the end of treatment visit.  
* QLQ-CR29 as optional: if it is completed at baseline it should be collected at all further time -points as per EORTC-C30 quest ionnaire.

in females (after breast cancer) with an increasing incidence in the low-risk area countries ( Ref. 1 ).
In 2008, the  incidence of colorectal cancer was over 1.2 million cases, with mortality over 600,000 
worldwide ( Ref. 2 ). The end prognosis is dependent upon the extent of the disease. The five year 
survival rate in early localized stage of about 90% decreases to approximately 60-65% after spread 
to adjacent organ(s) or lymph nodes and is about 5-8% after spread to distant sites ( Ref.3 ).
When diagnosed before nodal involvement, tre atment is usually limited to surgical resection (and 
radiotherapy for patients with rectal cancer). Patients with nodal involvement are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy following initial surgery in the attempt to prevent metastatic recurrence of the disease. Once spread to distant sites, treatment essentially consists of palliative 
chemotherapy.
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_75154] 75% to 80% of all the patients with colorectal carcinoma will present at a 
stage when all gross carcinoma can be surgically removed, almost half of these patients will develop metastatic disease. Furthermore, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 20% to 25% of the patients present with 
metastatic disease at diagnosis. Although mortality rates have been decreasing due to improved 
treatment options and early detection, once metastases are present median overall survival with available combination therapy is around 24 months ( Ref. 4 ,Ref. 5 ,Ref. 6 ).
5.2 Metastatic colorectal cancer treatment 
For many years, chemotherapy for colorectal cancer has been based on the use of the 
antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), administered with leucovorin (LV). Modifications in the 
administration schedules of this combination have yielded improvements in its use, with the fortnightly administration of bolus 5-FU and LV followed by 5-FU infusion, demonstrating improved activity (in terms of response rate and PFS) and safety over the so-called Mayo regimen (monthly 5-day bolus regimen) ( Ref. 7 ). This combination, however, did not re sult in any improvement on 
survival ( Ref. 8 ).
Improved  survival in patients with colorectal cancer was not observed until the development of 
oxaliplatin and the topoisomerase I inhibitor irinotecan when phase [ADDRESS_633419]-line metastatic setting showed median overall survival of 15 to 19 months ( Ref. 9 ,Ref. 10 ,Ref. 11 ).
Currently, initial therapy in patients with mCRC is based on oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy
(FOLFOX, capecitabine/oxaliplatin) or FOLFIRI (fortnightly leucovorin/bolus-infusional 5-FU/irinotecan). IFL, a previously used irinotecan-based regimen, is no longer used routinely due to safety concerns and has largely been replaced by [CONTACT_346999].  Therapy after first progression of the disease is based on a crossover from oxaliplatin treatment to 
irinotecan or vice-versa. The results from sequential therapy, reported by [CONTACT_492439], in a 
study in which patients with newly diagnosed mCRC were randomized to FOLFOX followed by [CONTACT_492440]-line treatments support this approach ( Ref.
5).
Todays standard treatments for mCRC ha ve evolved to include the addition of targeted biologic 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_492413] 5-FU/LV with either oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or irinotecan (FOLFIRI).

Anti-VEGF therapy
Several malignant tumors are dependent on angiogenesis (the growth of new blood vessels from existing vasculature) to maintain a source of nutrition and oxygen from the body to support their 
growth and metastasis. VEGF has become a major target for anti-angiogenic therapy because its 
overexpression in several tumor types (including tumors of the gastro-intestinal tract) has been associated with increased tumor vascularity, proliferation, progression, invasion, metastasis, and poor prognosis.Furthermore, it has been shown that the level of VEGF is particularly elevated in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, suggesting that the VEGF-induced increase in vascular permeability 
may contribute to the formation of malignant ascites.  
mCRC is one of the first malignancy in which a clear benefit was demonstrated with an anti-VEGF treatment in randomized clinical trials.  
Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets VEGF-A, a member of the VEGF-
receptor activating ligands. It has demonstrated a survival benefit in the first-line [in combination 
with IFL, FOLFIRI and FOLFOX ( Ref. 6 ,Ref. 12 ) and second-line (in combination with FOLFOX) 
treatment of mCRC ( Ref. 13 ).
In a recent  press release a statement was made t hat bevacizumab tested in combination with 
standard chemotherapy (either irinotecan or oxaliplatin based) as second line treatment following a first-line treatment with standard chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab, met its primary 
endpoint of overall survival. More results are awaited (ML18147 study) and expected to be 
presented at an upcoming medical oncology conference. 
Anti-EGFR therapi[INVESTIGATOR_492415] (respectively a chimeric and a fully human monoclonal antibody 
binding to EGFR) demonstrated activity in patients with refractory mCRC ( Ref. 14 ,Ref. 15 ). After 
early indications that cetuximab cou ld improve efficacy when combined with irinotecan in mCRC 
(Ref. 16 ), the phase [ADDRESS_633420]-line patients 
was able to demonstrate a significant improvement in PFS (the primary objective) and response 
rate in patients treated with cetuximab and FOLFIRI ( Ref. 17 ), but showed no statistically 
significant improvement in overall survival. Post-hoc analysis, performed to evaluate the impact of 
KRAS status on the effect of adding cetuximab to FOLFIRI, demonstrated that patients with KRAS mutations received no benefit from cetuximab ( Ref. 18 ). Similar results in the same patient setting 
were reported with the combination of cetuximab with the FOLFOX regimen ( Ref. 19 ). Recently, a 
phase [ADDRESS_633421]-line setting and to FOLFIRI in the 
pre-treated setting, failed to demonstrate a signif icant survival advantage over FOLFOX and over 
FOLFIRI, respectively, even in wild type KRAS mCRC patients ( Ref. 20 ,Ref. 21 ).
Initial therap y in patients with mCRC is actually based on oxaliplatin/5-FU/LV or on irinotecan/5-
FU/LV chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab followed by [CONTACT_492441], either with or without biologics
.
Cetuximab and panitumumab are palliative options for patients whose tumors harbor wild-type KRAS, but their addition to chemotherapy has not yet shown a significant improvement in overall survival.

5.3 Aflibercept background 
Aflibercept (referred also as VEGF-Trap or AVE0005) is a novel antiangiogenic agent. It is a 
recombinantly-produced fusion protein consisting of human VEGF receptor extracellular domains (from both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) fused to the F
c portion of human IgG 1 (Immunoglobulin G1).  
Figure 1 – Aflibercept schematic representation (VEGF Trap)  
Aflibercept interferes with the biological actions of VEGF by [CONTACT_492442]. 
The molecule functions as a soluble decoy receptor for VEGF with high affinity to all VEGF-A isoforms (i.e. binds more tightly to aflibercept than to native receptors), VEGF-B and placental growth factor (PlGF1 and PI[INVESTIGATOR_12252]2) and with a long circulating half life. 
Aflibercept was designed to prevent the growth of primary and metastatic tumors by [CONTACT_492443]. In preclinical studies aflibercept inhibited tumor growth, either as single agent or in combination with chemotherapy, in a variety of mouse tumor models and acted synergistically when combined with standard chemotherapeutic agents,  5-fluorouracil and irinotecan included. 
Phase I and early phase II clinical trials demonstrated activity in a range of tumor types with 
increased responses when used in combination with chemotherapy, including also 5-fluorouracil 
and irinotecan (phase I trial TCD6118). 
The pharmacokinetics of free aflibercept appeared to be linear between the 2 and 7 mg/kg dose 
levels while bound aflibercept increas ed with dose between 0.3 and 2 mg/kg, reaching a plateau 
thereafter between 2 and 7 mg/kg, suggesting that free aflibercept is present in sufficient amount to bind all endogenous VEGF at these higher dose levels.  The 4 mg/kg dose, administered once every 2 weeks, was selected for development, as it appeared to provide an adequate aflibercept free/bound ratio at the end of a q2 week dosing interval, at the steady state. 
The preliminary activity observed in the dose escalation Phase I (TCD6118) with standard doses of 
irinotecan/5FU/LV together with the above mentioned preclinical activity were the basis for the conduction of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_492416]10262/VELOUR in mCRC patients.

Property of  [COMPANY_011] - strictly confidential Page No: 21 of 70 The VELOUR phase III double-blind clinical trial has been conducted in 1.226 patients with 
metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who progressed during or after the completion of treatment 
with an oxaliplatin-based regimen. Patients were randomised either to receive aflibercept 4 mg/kg 
in combination with FOLFIRI (n=612) every 2 weeks or FOLFIRI every 2 weeks (n=614) alone. 
Primary endpoint was overall survival (target hazard ratio (HR) was 0.8 with 90% power and a 2-
sided type I error of 0.05); secondary endpoints included Progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR), safety and pharmacokinetic. Stratification factors were prior bevacizumab 
therapy (that was permitted) and ECOG PS. Approximately 28% of patients in each arm received 
prior bevacizumab as part of their initial treatment. 
The median number of cycles delivered was 9 in the aflibercept arm compared to 8 in the placebo 
one. OS was based on 863 death events out of 1216 treated patients.  
The median OS was significantly longer in the aflibercept arm (13.5 months) compared to placebo 
(12.06 months) with an HR= 0.817 [95% CI, 0.71-0.94], p = 0.0032. The survival curves separated 
early and continued to separate throughout the follow-up period. The clinical benefit of aflibercept 
treatment is further observed by [CONTACT_492444] 2-year survival rate. Median PFS was significantly higher in the aflibercept arm, with an absolute increase of 2.23 months over the 
placebo arm (6.9 months versus 4.67 mo; HR=0.76 [95%CI, 0.58-0.99], p=0.[ZIP_CODE]), representing 
approximately a 25% reduction in the risk of disease progression. The ORR (evaluable population) 
in the aflibercept arm was significantly higher than in placebo (19.8% versus 11.1%, p=0.0001).  
Pre-specified subgroup analyses (accounting for
 stratification factors and patient characteristics )
supported consistency and robustness of the efficacy results ( OS and PFS ) across all domains, 
including prior treatment with bevacizumab, with no evidence of interaction between treatment and 
prior bevacizumab exposure. A significant interaction was observed between treatment arm and 
the presence of liver metastases only, indicating a greater treatment effect in this group of patients, as compared with patients with disease not confined to the liver or no liver disease. 
Adverse events (AEs) were similar to the safety profile of FOLFIRI chemotherapy. Grade 3-4 
adverse events (AEs) with > 2% higher incidence in aflibercept arm vs placebo were diarrhea, 
asthenia/fatigue, stomatitis/ulceration, infections, hypertension, GI/abdominal pain, 
neutropenia/neutropenic complications and proteinuria. AEs leading to treatment discontinuation 
occurred in 26.6% and 12.1% of patients in af libercept and placebo arm respectively. For 
aflibercept the most common causes were asthenia/fatigue, infections, diarrhea, hypertension and venous thromboembolic events. The incidence of grade 3-4 adverse events were as expected with 
the anti-VEGF class of agents, and were similar among patients with and without prior 
bevacizumab exposure. Grade 3-4 hypertension occurred in 16.6% and 20.5% of these groups, 
respectively. Prior treatment with bevacizumab did not  appear to significantly impact the safety 
profile of aflibercept ( Ref. 22 ,Ref. 23 ).
Further details on preclinical, clin ical safety and preliminary efficacy are provided in the 
Investigator’s Brochure, which contains comprehensive information on aflibercept ( Ref. 24 ).

The results of the VELOUR trial are expected to generate significant interest and increase demand 
for accessing aflibercept because of the medical need, among the 2L mCRC patients. 
This study is therefore required to allow patients and physicians access to aflibercept for the

Investigators who had previous experience with aflibercept (i.e., who have had at least one patient 
treated in the VELOUR trial) or have extensive experience in administering anti-angiogenic agents will be invited to participate in this study.  Investigators who have not previously participated in  the VELOUR trial will be specifically trained 
on the use of aflibercept and the management of its adverse events. 
6. STUDY OBJECTIVES 
6.1 Primary
To provide mCRC patients (similar to the patients evaluated in the VELOUR phase III trial) and 
Investigators with access to aflibercept, prior to its marketing authorisation and/or commercial 
availability and to document the aflibercept overall safety in this patient population. 
6.2 Secondary
To document the Health-Related Quality of Life ( HRQL) of aflibercept in this patient population.

The study will be initiated in the second quarter of 2012 in Europe and in the [LOCATION_002], 
simultaneously or sequentially in the other involved countries.  
In each country patient recruitment will end when aflibercept (ZALTRAP) becomes commercially 
available (i.e. accessible to the patient as per each country regulation).  
Patients already on study will continue to be treated until disease progression, death, unacceptable 
toxicity, Investigator’s decision or patient’s refusal of further treatment, whichever comes first. 
8. SELECTION OF PATIENTS 
8.1 Number of patients planned 
It is planne d to include a total of approximately 900 patients in this study, from around 150 
investigational sites, over about 20 months of accrual. 
Global study accrual will be terminated when the anticipated number of patients has been achieved 
across all study sites. 
Actively treated patients from VELOUR (EFC10262) study who will be still under treatment with 
aflibercept at the time of initiation of this study will be allowed to rollover on to this study if according to their treating Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_492418].  
No confirmation of entry criteria will be required for these patients provided they meet the criteria to 
initiate a subsequent cycle of therapy.  
A new patient number will be assigned to these patients, however the patient number from the

this trial. Reduced doses of 5-FU to those that were tolerable when used with the previous regimen 
would be acceptable.  Similar consideration and clinical judgement should be used when determining the initial starting dose of irinotecan. 
*400 mg /m² of leucovorin expressed in dl racemic. When the l-isomer form is used the dose should be 
divided by 2, i.e. 200 mg/m² 
Doses should be based upon actual body weight measured before each administration.  
In case BSA > 2.0 m², the actual doses of irinotecan and 5-FU should be adjusted to a maximum 
BSA of 2.0 m², for safety reasons.

Cycle length is 2 weeks (± 2 days). Delays of up to 2 weeks in case of unresolved toxicity at the 
time of planned re-administration are permitted (note that in some circumstances, administration of 
aflibercept could be omitted for one cycle as indicated in Table 2  and Table 3  and ). Doses may be 
modified or infusion de layed for toxicity as described in Section 9.3.3 . New cycles of therapy may 
not begin until any drug-related toxicity has been adequately resolved. The treatment will continue 
until a definitive treatment discontinuation criterion is met (see Section 12.2.1 ).

Property of  [COMPANY_011] - strictly confidential Page No: 29 of 70 9.3.3 Dosage modification 
Dose adjustment and/or cycle delay are planned in case of toxicity. Dose adjustments will be made 
according the worst grade toxicity. Toxicities will be graded according the NCI-CTC AE V. 4.0 scale (Ref. 30 ) (Appendix C ). Patient will receive the next cycle after recovery of the toxicity. 
If a patient experiences several toxicities and there are conflicting recommendations, the most 
conservative dose adjustment recommended (dose reduction appropriate to the most severe toxicity) should be followed. Once a dose has been decreased, intra-patient re-escalation back to the previous dose level is not permitted. 
In case of toxicity from treatment, administration should be delayed until: 
 neutrophil count is t 1.5 X 109/L and platelet count is t 75 X 109/L 
 recovery to grade d 1 for other toxicities (except alopecia and if otherwise specified). 
The maximum delay allowed is of 2 weeks. 
If FOLFIRI (the whole regimen or any of its components) is permanently discontinued, then 
aflibercept should be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or patient’s refusal of further treatment.  
If aflibercept is permanently discontinued, then FOLFIRI can be continued until disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity or patient’s refusal of further treatment.  
The end of treatment will be the date of the last treatment administration, either aflibercept or 
FOLFIRI whichever comes last .

Hypertension therapy recommendations :
For patients without prior antihypertensive therapy , at the time of the hypertensive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] 
a close monitoring of the BP (every 2 weeks is recommended) should be initiated for adjustment in treatment, as needed. Ultimately, antihypertensive treatment must be 
individualized based on the presence of comorbidity factors such as diabetes, 
cardiovascular or renal disease, additionally taking into account the safety and the efficacy of any prior antihypertensive therapy received. Oral and/or intravenous sodium intake should be carefully monitored in these patients. 
For patients already under anti-hypertensive therapy , efforts should be done to optimize the 
existing therapy before adding other agents as required to control the BP.  
When hypertension is accompanied by [CONTACT_492451], kidney function abnormalities (like progressive proteinuria), or any signs or symptoms of cardiovascular morbidity or central nervous system (CNS) morbidity, aflibercept should be interrupted. 
Proteinuria
:
Determination and management of proteinuria: 
Prior to each administration of aflibercept perform a urine dipstick for WBC, RBC and protein 
(morning spot urine).If proteinuria is < 2+ on the dipstick in absence of hematuria, aflibercept should be administered as 
planned.
If the proteinuria is >
 2+ on the dipstick, UPCR (Urinary Protein/urinary Creatinine Ratio) should be 
performed prior to administration of aflibercept. 
Urinary protein creatinine ratio (UPCR) corresponds to the ratio of urinary protein and urinary 
creatinine concentrations (expressed in mg/dL). There is a high correlation between morning 
UPCR and 24-hour proteinuria in patients with normal or reduced renal function. This ratio provides an accurate quantification of 24-hour urinary protein excretion ( Ref. 25 ).
UPCR to d etect proteinuria, should be done on morning urine spot. If UPCR > 1, 24-hour urine 
collection to grade proteinuria will be performed. In addition, in case UPCR is greater than 2 or in

Property of  [COMPANY_011] - strictly confidential Page No: 32 of 70 case of proteinuria of renal origin (according to urinary protein electrophoresis and/or nephrologist 
judgement) is associated with hematuria (microscopic or macroscopic), then a work up for considering thrombotic microangiopathy should be initiated and a nephrologist consultation be considered. 
Delay in availabilty of the results should not delay consultation wth a nephrologist.  
Actions with regard to aflibercept dosing will depend on the presence of hematuria and the level of 
24-hour proteinuria results. Only one dose level reduction for aflibercept is foreseen. 
Aflibercept administration should be suspended for 2 grams of proteinuria/24 hours and restarted 
when proteinuria is <2 grams/24 hours. If there is recurrence, the administration should be suspended until <2 grams/24 hours and then the dose reduced to 2 mg/kg.  
Aflibercept treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome or TMA. 
Proteinuria should always be assessed taking into account the presence or absence of 
hematuria and the blood pressure status of the patient. 
Reversible posterior leuko-encephalopathy (RPLS

the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with unexplained mental status change, visual disturbance, seizure, or other CNS findings. RPLS is potentially reversible with early recognition of 
symptoms and timely correction of the underlying causes, including control of BP and interruption 
of the offending drug, which are important in order to prevent progression to irreversible tissue 
damage.
Gastro-intestinal perforation:
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of GI perforation as this has been reported 
with anti-VEGF agents as a class. 
Hypersensitivity reaction:
In case of hypersensitivity reaction, institutional treatment guidelines for this type of AEs, or the 
following proposed guideline in Table 3  can be applied. Pre-treatment with corticosteroids and/or 
antihistamines may be considered in subsequent cycles.

Instruments description
x EORTC QLQ-C30 (version 3). 
The EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a cancer-specific instrument that contains 30 questions and provides a 
multi-dimensional assessment of Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO).  The validity and reliability of the EORTC-QLQ-C30 has been established in various types of cancers ( Ref. 26 ).
The EORT C-QLQ-C30 is one of the standard instruments used in oncology for the evaluation of 
new chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_492425] a comprehensive assessment of the principal PRO dimensions identified as relevant by [CONTACT_492456] (physical functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning, role functioning, social functioning, global QOL, impact of symptoms and of toxicities).  The first 28 questions of the QLQ-C30 V3.0 questionnaire use a 4-category response system (not at all/a little/quite a bit/very much) that correspond to numeric values 1, 2, 3, 4, respectively. Then 
for each item a high score represents a high level of symptomatology/problem. The last [ADDRESS_633457] week. 
x EORTC QLQ CR29 (disease specific supplement to QLQ-C30) – optional. 
The EORTC QLQ-C30 can be supplemented by a module specific to colorectal cancer, the 
EORTC QLQ-CR29 colorectal cancer module ( Ref. 27 ) which includes four scales (urinary 
frequency, faecal seepa ge, stool consistency and body image) and 19 single items assessing other 
common problems following treatment for colorectal cancer. 
x EQ-5D
TM questionnaire 
The EQ-5DTM is a standardized health-related quality of life questionnaire developed by [CONTACT_492457] a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal ( Ref. 28 .  EQ-5DTM essentially consists of 2 pages: the EQ-5DTM descriptive system 
and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).  The EQ-5DTM is a well-validated and researched 
assessment tool which has been widely used and supported in QOL assessment across a range of disease areas, including oncology. 
The EQ-5DTM descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions: mobility, self care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problem, some problems,  
STUDY N° AFLIBC06097                                                                                                                                          VERSION 1.0/ 10 Feb 2012 
Property of  [COMPANY_011] - strictly confidential Page No: 40 of 70 and severe problems. The 5 dimensional 3-level system can be converted into a single index utility 
score. Values for the 243 theoretically possible health states defined by [CONTACT_492458] a regression model and weighted according to the social preferences of the [LOCATION_006] population ( Ref. 29 ). The minimum value for the single index utility score is -0.594, which 
corresponds to a level 3 (severe problems) for the 5 dimensions.  The maximum value for this 
index is 1.0, which corresponds to a full health (level 1, no problem) for the 5 dimensions. The VAS records the respondent’s self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale. The VAS ‘thermometer’ has endpoints of 100 (Best imaginable health state) at the top and 0 (Worst imaginable health state) at the bottom. This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome as judged by [CONTACT_112775]. 
Timing of Assessment
The above described questionnaires have been designed for self-completion. 
Baseline assessment should be obtained from all patients. All the questionnaires will be administered within [ADDRESS_633458] dose. While on treatment assessments should occur before the treatment 
administration at the beginning of every odd cycle (day 1 of cycle 3, 5, etc) and at the end of treatment visit. Questionnaires should be self-administered by [CONTACT_492437], prior to informing the patient about disease evolution, before the next study treatment and before any other assessment 
is performed.
For the quality of life questionnaires it is mandatory that a key person (e.g., research nurse) at each center should be responsible for questionnaire data collection, in order to optimize compliance of the patient and to ensure completeness of the data.  
A HRQL analysis will be detailed in the SAP. 
11. PATIENT SAFETY 
11.1 Safety instructions 
Adverse Events (AEs), regardless of seriousness or relationship to study treatment, will be 
collected from the time the patient signs the informed consent form up to [ADDRESS_633459] administration of treatment (either aflibercept or FOLFIRI). Details and schedule of requested evaluations are given in Sections 2 and 13.
If a finding meets the criteria for a SAE, then the appropriate procedures for reporting such events 
should be followed as described in Section 11.4.2 .
After the 30  day FUP period all ongoing SAEs (regardless of relationship with study treatment) as 
well as ongoing related AEs and new SAEs, that are considered to be related to study treatment, will have to be collected and followed till resolution /stabilization (stabilization being defined as an 
event ongoing without any change for at least 3 months). 
11.[ADDRESS_633460] be managed and reported in compliance with all applicable regulations, and 
included in the final clinical study report.

Property of  [COMPANY_011] - strictly confidential Page No: 41 of 70 11.3 Definitions of Adverse Event (AE) and Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
AnAdverse Event  is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
ASerious Adverse Event  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
o Results in death or;  
o Is life-threatening or;  
Note: The term "life-threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an event in which the patient was at risk 
of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe.  
o Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_38470];  
o Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or;  
o Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
o Is a medically important event:  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30506].  
Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_492426] (e.g. planned 
surgery for metastases resection after treatment discontinuation) will not be considered SAEs (unless there is complication from surgery [e.g. hemorrhage or wound infection or wound healing difficulties etc.]) in which case the complication should be reported as AE(s)/SAE(s). 
Note : The following medical important events intend to serve as a guideline for determining which 
condition has to be considered as a medically important event. It is not intended to be exhaustive: 
x Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for: 
o allergic bronchospasm,  
o blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, bone marrow aplasia, 
myelodysplasia, pancytopenia, etc),  
o convulsions (seizures, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], epi[INVESTIGATOR_12995], absence, etc.) 
x Development of drug dependency or drug abuse, 
x ALT > [ADDRESS_633461] + total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_633462] or asymptomatic ALT increase  > [ADDRESS_633463] , 
x Suicide attempt or any event suggestive of suicidality, 
x Syncope, loss of consciousness (except if documented as a consequence of blood sampling), 
x Bullous cutaneous eruptions, 
x Cancers diagnosed during the study or aggravated during the study (only if judged as 
unusual/significant by [CONTACT_093]), 
x Chronic neurodegenerative diseases (newly diagnosed) or aggravated during the study.

All Adverse Events regardless of seriousness or relationship to the treatment (either aflibercept or 
FOLFIRI), spanning from the signature [CONTACT_492484] [ADDRESS_633464] 
administration of the treatment,(aflibercept/FOLFIRI) are to be recorded on the corresponding 
page(s) included in the Case Report Form. 
Whenever possible, diagnosis or single syndrome should be reported instead of symptoms. The 
investigator should specify the date of onset, intensity, action taken with respect to Investigational Medicinal Product and Non Investigational Medicinal Product, corrective treatment/therapy given, additional investigations performed, outcome and his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_56390] a 
reasonable possibility that the Adverse Event was caused by [CONTACT_492459]/or Non Investigational Medicinal Product. 
Signs/symptoms that are present or occurred from the time the patient signed the informed 
consent to first study treatment administration (i.e. even in the absence of any administration of 
Investigational Medicinal Product), will be recorded as Adverse Event only if they are still present 
at the time of first study treatment administration or if they are serious. 
Vital signs or ECG abnormalities are to be recorded as Adverse Events only if they are considered 
medically relevant: symptomatic, requiring corrective treatment, leading to discontinuation/dose modification (reduction and/or delay) and/or fulfilling a seriousness criterion.  
Laboratory abnormalities are to be recorded as Adverse Events only if they lead to treatment 
discontinuation/dose modification and/or fulfill a seriousness criterion. 
11.4.[ADDRESS_633465] immediately:
y ENTER (within 1 working day) the information related to the SAE in the appropriate screens 
of the e-CRF; the system will automatically send a notification to the monitoring team after approval of the Investigator within the e-CRF or after a standard delay.

Property of  [COMPANY_011] - strictly confidential Page No: 43 of 70 11.4.3 Safety Observations 
The investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the patients, notably 
he/she should follow up the outcome of any Adverse Events (clinical signs, laboratory values or other, etc.) until the return to normal or consolidation of the patient's condition;  
y In case of any Serious Adverse Event, the patient must be followed up until clinical recovery 
is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been stabilized. This may imply that follow- up will continue beyond the 30 days follow-up period 
and that additional investigations may be requested by [CONTACT_244418];  
y In case of any Serious Adverse Event brought to the attention of the investigator at any time 
after cessation of the treatment and considered by [CONTACT_12552]/her to be caused by [CONTACT_492460] a reasonable possibility, this should be reported to the monitoring team.  
11.4.4 Pregnancy 
Pregnancy should be recorded as an AE in all cases. It should be qualified as an SAE only if it 
fulfills SAE criteria.
In the event of pregnancy, the treatment should be discontinued and the sponsor informed 
immediately (i.e. within 1 working day), even not fulfilling a seriousness criterion, using the AE form together with the SAE complementary form to be sent  to the representative of the monitoring team 
whose name, address and fax number appear on the clinical trial protocol.  
Follow-up of the pregnancy is mandatory until the outcome has been determined.  
11.4.5 Overdose
A symptomatic overdose (accidenta l or intentional) even not fulfilling a seriousness criterion, is to 
be reported to the sponsor immediately (within 1 working day) using the SAE complementary form to be sent to the representative of the monitoring team whose name, address and fax number appear on the clinical trial protocol. 
An overdose of study treatment is defined as: 
FOLFIRI:
For the purpose of safety reporting (as described above) dosing of 30% above the 
intended/planned dose of either irinotecan or 5-FU should be considered as an overdosage. 
Aflibercept :
The highest doses of aflibercept that have been administered so far are 7 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks 
and 9 mg/kg IV every [ADDRESS_633467] been reported so far.  
In this protocol an aflibercept overdose is defined as 30% above the intended/planned dose.
The circumstances (i.e., accidental or intentional) should be clearly specified in the verbatim and 
symptoms, if any, entered on separate AE forms. Based on investigator’s best clinical judgment, patients experiencing overdose should be monitored for the onset of known anti-VEGF toxicities 
(e.g. hypertension, proteinuria, etc.).

Property of  [COMPANY_011] - strictly confidential Page No: 44 of 70 authorities, ethics committee(s) as appropriate and to the investigators in accordance with local 
regulatory timelines.
In addition, the sponsor should report in an expedited manner all SAEs that are expected and at 
least reasonably related to the IMP to the competent/ health authorities, according to local 
regulations.
Any AE not consistent with events listed as expected in the most current Investigator’s Brochure of 
aflibercept and/or contained within the reference safety information for irinotecan, 5-FU and leucovorin on file in the Pharmacovigilance Department will be considered as unexpected. 
The sponsor should report all safety observations made during the conduct of the trial in the CSR.  
12. HANDLING OF PATIENT TEMPORARY OR DEFINITIVE TREATMENT DISCONTINUATION 
AND OF PATIENT STUDY DISCONTINUATION 
12.[ADDRESS_633469] 
Re-initiation  of treatment with the IMP should be done un der close and appropriate clinical and/or 
laboratory monitoring once the Investigator has considered according to his/her best medical 
judgment that the responsibility of the IMP in the occurrence of the concerned event was unlikely and if the selection criteria for the study are still met (ref to Sections 8.2 and 8.3).
All temporary treat ment discontinuation and date of treatment re-initiation should be recorded by 
[CONTACT_226054] e-CRF when considered to be confirmed.
12.[ADDRESS_633470] of criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation  
The patients ma y withdraw from the treatment if they decide to do so, at any time and irrespective 
of the reason, or this may be due to the investigator’s decision if, in his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuation of the study treatment would be detrimental to the patient’s well being, such as: 
x Disease progression (as per investigator assessment) 
x Unacceptable AE(s) not manageable by [CONTACT_492461], dose delay or dose 
modification (see Section 9.3.2  and Section 9.3.3 )
xIntercurrent illness that prevents further administration of study treatment 
All efforts should be made to document the reasons for treatment discontinuation and this should 
be documented in the e-CRF.

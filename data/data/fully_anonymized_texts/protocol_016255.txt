2.A.3.g. Study Measures. Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) [1]. Several versions of the ZBI have 
been used successfully as outcome measures in interventions for dementia caregivers [2, 3] . 
Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_2557] -Depression (CES -D) [4]. The CES -D is frequently used to 
assess depression in dementia caregivers and has been shown to be sensitive to changes in 
caregiver depression post intervention [5]. Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)  [6]. The PSS has been 
used successfully to measure perceived stress in dementia caregivers [7]. Global Deterioration 
Scale  (GDS) [8].  The GDS is a semi -structured rating of  functional status in degenerative 
dementia. It has been successfully used in prior studies of dementia caregiver intervention with 
adequate reliability [9]. Telephone Cognitive Screen (T -CogS)  [10]. The T -CogS is a brief 
mental status examination designed to be administered over the telephone. Scores on the T -
CogS strongly correlate with MMSE scores ( r = 0.88, p < 0.001) [11].  An exclusion cutoff score 
of < 20 on the T -CogS is ch osen to match a MMSE cutoff of < 23 [12]. Caregiver Interview . All 
caregivers will also be administered a structured interview to ascertain information on levels of 
socialization and pleasurable activity participation.  
 
2.A.3.h. Data Management.  Integrity of data collection, scoring, and entry/verification will be 
overseen by [CONTACT_501610]/Database Manager and the PI.  
 
2.A.3.i. Statistical Analyses.  While the proposed project is designed to assess study feasibility, 
to test the hypotheses outlined in the Specific Aims (Section 2) we will use mixed -effects 
modeling to fully utilize outcome data measured over time  (baseline and follow -up assessments) 
and to better handle missing outcome information in line with the intention to treat principle. [CONTACT_501611] will serve as a statistical consultant, given her expertise in clinical trial and mixed modeling 
methodologies.

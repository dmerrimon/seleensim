 SYNOPSIS 
 
Study Title  A resistance training program to improve physical function in sarcoma 
s urvivors  
Protocol #  [ADDRESS_328131] physical function.  
Physical activity is an effective method to improv e physical function 
and regain muscle performance; however, no effective approach has been routinely implemented that can improve physical function in sarcoma survivors. This study seeks to assess the feasibility of implementing a resistance training exercise regimen as a means to improve physical function in individual sarcoma survivors.  In this study, eligible participants will be assigned a series of progressive 
training exercises that are to be performed biweekly for a total of [ADDRESS_328132] in a videoconference with the participant.   Video conferences may be in groups of 1- 3 participants, 
depending on the preferences of the participant for 1:1 or a small group session.  This “tele- exercise” approach allows the exercise 
physiologist to supervise exercise and adjust training programs to optimize safety and efficacy but reduces the patient burden by [CONTACT_269592], which we expect will 
result in greater program adherence and study retention.  
 
Primary Objective  The primary objective of this trial is to assess the feasibility of an 
individualized resistance training program in sarcoma survivors.  
Secondary  Objective  1. To asses s secondary measures of feasibility of a home -based, 
individualized PRT program in sarcoma survivors  
2. To determine if a 3-month resistance training program improves 
physical function in sarcoma survivors.  
Exploratory Objective To determine if a 3 -month resistance training program improves body 
composition and bone mineral density in sarcoma survivors.  
Primary Endpoint s The primary endpoint of feasibility will be measured by 3- month 
retention rate, exercise adherence rate and frequency  of related 
serious adverse event .

include fatigue, decreased muscle strength  and lean body  mass, reduced bone mass, as well as 
diminished aerobic capacity.2,3  Moreover, low skeletal muscle mass (i.e., sarcopenia) is shown 
to be an independent poor prognostic factor for survival among patients with various cancers .4-6  
Routine exercise, such as aerobic or progressive resistance training, allows for improving a patient’s health status and counter  these adverse side effects by [CONTACT_269594], muscle strength, bone mineral density, while reducing body weight, fat mass, and fatigue.

counteracting muscle wasting.7,8   
 1.2 PROGRESSIVE RESISTAN CE TRAINING  
 There is a strong association between lean body mass, muscle strength, and the ability to adequately perform functional measures of activities of daily living (e.g., chair rising, stair climbing).
10,[ADDRESS_328144] the functional performance and independent lifestyle.  Progressive resistance training ( PRT) is particularly efficacious for adult and elderly cohorts given its efficacy in 
counteracting sarcopenia, abating osteoporosis , and reversing many physiological and 
functional impairments  that accrue with age.
12  
 The goal of PRT is to enhanc e the ability of muscles to generate force by  [CONTACT_269595] 
(i.e., training intensity) .
13  In general , PRT involves challenging the skeletal muscles with some 
form of resistance (e.g., exercise machines, free weights, and elastic bands) that are lifted 
repetitively (~8–15 repetitions maximum [RM] per set ) to the point of neuromuscular fatigue.13  
Optimal PRT sessions typi[INVESTIGATOR_269579] a 48 to 72 hour recovery period that allows for 
physiological super -compensation (i.e. , positive adaptation).  Subsequent PRT sessions involve 
the incremental increase in the training intensity (i.e. load) and training volume (i.e. number of sets), as well as alterations/adjustments to the types of exercises, as well as time under tension for each repetition.

 Sarcomas are a collection of connective tissue cancers that make up nearly 20% of pediatric and ~1% of adult malignancies.

 cadence. Moreover , at the 12- month follow -up, participants in the sarcoma cohort showed a 
significant imp rovement in endurance compared to baseline.  
 
In an open non- randomized clinical trial, Winter et al21 examined 31 pediatric patients with 
malignant bone tumors (22 osteosarcoma, 10 Ewing’s sarcoma).  All patients had received an 
endoprosthetic replacement and were  treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and /or radiotherapy.  
Fifteen patients were assigned to the control group, which received symptom -specific 
physiotherapy.  The other 16 patients were assigned to receive symptom -specific physiotherapy 
plus exercise intervention consisting of different exercises (i.e., strength, endurance, coordination, and flexibility exercises).  The authors observed that following an 18- month follow -
up, the volume and time spent in moderately intense activity was increased in both control and 
exercise groups, which was attributed to general recovery. Although not significant, patients in 
the exercise interventional group demonstrated a greater volume of physical activity compared to those in the control group.  1.[ADDRESS_328147] been developed for sarcoma survivors and clinical guidelines are bereft of recommendations to manage functional consequences of treatment.  Exercise has been 
shown to offer symptomatic relief from side effects of cancer treatment and improve quality of life among cancer survivors
26, but the potential benefits of exercise to improve physical 
functioning in sarcoma survivors are unknown.  
 
This study seeks to investigate feasibility of implementing functional resistance training for 
sarcoma survivors as means to improve their physical function.  
 1.5 POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS 
 1.5.1  KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS  
 
Exercise and functional physical testing performed in this study can cause transient muscle 
soreness that typi[INVESTIGATOR_36065] 3 days.  Participants may experience fatigue/tiredness 
related to exercise regimen.  Participants are at possible, though slight, risk of  injury from 
exercises; however, the exercise regimen will be taught to participants by a certified exercise 
physiologist ( EP) that will guide and instruct participants on appropriate body mechanics to 
prevent or reduce risk of injury.  Moreover, no significant injuries as a result of similar exercise 
regimens have been reported.
27   
 
This study involves the implementation of several survey tools to be administered to participants throughout the trial.  Participants may  be anxious about their ability to read surveys. T o 
Improving Physical Function in Sarcoma Survivors  
Protocol number: eIRB#  [ZIP_CODE]  Version # 4.0 16 APR 2020  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_269577], MD  
 
[ADDRESS_328148] the survey questions 
verbally read (in person or over the telephone) to these individuals and help fill out the sur vey.  
If participants express anxiety regarding the ability to complete any of the physical tests (e.g., PPB, 1RM, grip strength) they will be given the option of discontinuing the test.  
 
At baseline, participants will undergo imaging for total body fat mass, fat free or lean mass in 
kilograms, as well as bone mineral density for two clinically relevant sites (proximal femur and 
lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) to be determined by [CONTACT_11323] x -ray absorptiometry (DXA) (Hologic -QDR 
Discovery Wi; APEX software , v.4.02) scan. At follow -up, participants will undergo imaging for 
total body mass, fat free or lean mass in kilograms, to be determined by [CONTACT_11323] x -ray 
absorptiometry (DXA) (Hologic -QDR Discovery Wi; APEX software, v.4.02) scan.  These scans 
include exposure to low -dose ionizing radiation. Participants may refuse DXA and remain 
eligible for the study. No pregnant women will undergo DXA  and all women of childbearing 
potential will undergo urine pregnancy testing prior to DXA  scan to minimize fetal risk . During 
periods of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_269580]- person contact, imaging will be omitted.  
 During virtual sessions, additional safety precautions will include: 1) Providing safety 
recommendations specific to exercises and/or assessments (i.e.,  standing near a wall for 
balance activities) 2) Adapting the exercise protocol  as necessary (ie. limit weight.) 3) Verifying address of remote exercise location (i.e., home address),  should the study staff require the need 
to call 911 in an emergency 4) Ensuring that emergency contact [CONTACT_165171]- to-date and 
readily available.  
 
1.5.2  KNOWN POTENTIAL BENE FITS 
 
An exercise regimen may improve physical function in sarcoma survivors.  It cannot, however, be guaranteed that participants in this study will directly benefit from the intervention during 
study participation, as the clinical trial is designed to provide information about the safety and 
feasibility  of this interventional approach.    
 Participants will receive the results of their  DXA scans. 
 No compensation will be provided to participants for their involvement in this study.  If 
participants are provided with resistance bands, handheld weights or weighted vests, they will be permitted to keep this equipment after successful completion of end- of-study assessments.

[ADDRESS_328151] of any screening tests not performed routinely in their treatment.   All 
clinical evaluation and/or medical  assessment pertaining to a participants’  health that are 
required as part of this study will be performed by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_269582] . 
 Eligible participants enrolled into this study will undergo a set of baseline evaluations prior to the 
start of the intervention.  Each partic ipant will complete a free text self -report of physical 
limitations and their treating physician will identify recommended exercise limitations and modifications. Additional baseline standardized s elf-reported evaluations include: Patient - 
Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) cancer -specific physical 
function assessment, 36-Item Short Form Health Survey  (SF-36), Godin Leisure- Time Exercise  
Questionnaire (GLTEQ), and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy: Fatigue (FACT -F) 
scale . Physical assessments will be completed by a qualified exercise physiologist (EP)  and 
include: 1-repi[INVESTIGATOR_269578] (1RM) test, short physical performance battery (PPB), grip 
strength test, and assessments of mobility using wearable sensor s (postural sway (ISway), 
timed up and go (iTUG) and 6- minute walk test (6MWT)) .   
 The EP  will integrate results from baseline objective physical function assessments with patient -
reported and physician- recommended limitations , and prescribe an individualized therapeutic 
resistance exercise plan.  Each participant will undergo a one-time, in -person session with the 
EP, in which they will be provided a written exercise plan and receive training on how to perform 
the therapeutic resistance exercises at home.  All subsequent exercise sessions  will be 
conducted at home. During periods of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_269580]- person 
contact, participants will perform all exercise sessions remotely (e.g., at home) using videoconfer encing software. Specifically, participants are expected to complete a total of 24 
exercise sessions over a 12-week  period (i.e., 2 exercise training sessions per week  for 12 
weeks) , with at least [ADDRESS_328152] between each session (i.e., approximately [ADDRESS_328153] (iTUG)

5.1 STUDY SPECIFIC PROCE DURES 
 
5.1.1  DEMOGRAPHICS  
 
Demographic variables, including race, ethnicity, education,  marital status, employment,  
income, and (for females) childbearing potential  will be measured at baseline by a questionnaire 
developed for this study. Health history and sarcoma- specific information (e.g., diagnosis, type 
and dates of cancer treatments, presence of other chronic conditions ) will be obtained from 
participants’ electronic health record.  
 All subjects will also be offered participat ion in the Sarcoma Survivorship Registry [IRB #[ZIP_CODE]].  
 
5.1.2  PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS  
 
At baseline, each participant will complete a free text self -report of physical limitations. In 
addition, the treating physician will provide a written report identifying specific physical 
limitations and recommended modifications to physical activity.  
 5.1.3  ADVERSE EVENT EVALUA TION  
 
Adverse events will be monitored from the time the participant signs the Consent Form. Participants will be instructed to report all AEs during the study and will be assessed for the 
occurrence of AEs  bi-weekly  throughout the study  by [CONTACT_28920]- house survey.  All AEs (serious and 
non-serious) must be recorded on the source documents and CRFs regardless of the 
assumption of a causal relationship with the study intervention.

5.1.5  SELF-REPORTED OUTCOM E MEASURES  
 
All self -reported assessments will primarily be administered electronically as an online survey, 
but may be administered on paper if requested by [CONTACT_2299].  Study participants will 
complete each survey at baseline and at end of study visit .   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Godin Leisure- Time Exercise Questionnaire 
 
The Godin Leisure- Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ)33 is a brief four -item query of usual 
leisure -time exercise habits.  In this s elf-explanatory questionnaire, the study participant will be 
asked to respond to the question “During a typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 7 -Day period (a week), how many times on 
the average do you do the following kinds of exercise for more than 15 minutes during your free time?” .  The participants’ responses will consist of entering the frequency of which the activity is 
performed in relation to its intensity (i.e., strenuous, moderate, or mild exercise).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  PROMIS -Cancer -Physical Function Measure
 
 The PROMIS -Cancer assessment
34 consists of 45 questions pertaining to physical function, 
each of which are designed as having five- point ordinal rating scales.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  36-Item Short  Form Survey  
 The 36- Item Short Form Health Survey (SF -36) consists of a set of generic, quality -of-life 
measures to survey physical function in the general population.
35   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  FACT -F  
 The 13- item Functional Assessment of Cancer  Therapy -Fatigue
36 (FACT -F) measurement 
system will be used to assess fatigue.   
 5.1.6  PHYSICAL FUNCTION AS SESSMENTS 
 
During testing visits, if a participant experiences self -reported tiredness, or the participant’s 
tiredness is observed by [CONTACT_269601] (during 1:1 sessions), then they may be instructed to halt their participation in the physical function assessments, and begin again at a later time.  Participants 
may rest a s often as needed during the physical function assessments if tiredness occurs.  
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Short 
Physical Performance Battery (PPB)  
 The short PPB will be conducted as previously described
37, and consists of 3 timed 
performance tests: 1) 5 repeated chair stands, b) standing balance (semi -tandem stand; side- by 
[CONTACT_269602]; tandem stand), and c) gait speed over 4 meters.

[IP_ADDRESS]  One-repetition maximum ( 1RM ) Strength Testing  
 
Maximal strength of the upper and lower body w ill be evaluated by a 1RM l eg press and bench 
press (kg) according to established protocols.30 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Grip Strength 
 
Participant grip strength will be evaluated using a Lafayette Instruments using Hand 
Dynamometer Model [ZIP_CODE] (or equivalent device).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Gait and Balance 
 Postural stability and gait will be measured using standard and instrumented (i.e., wearable 
sensors ) assessments. Participants will be fitted with elastic body straps designed to hold a 
number of wearable body sensors (iMobility, APDM, Inc.) .  Each wearable sensor weighs <25 
grams (with battery), and houses an accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer.   
 Study participants will be asked to conduct a 6- minute walk test (6MWT) , a postural sway test, 
and the timed- up-and-GO (TUG) test. Each test will be conducted while wearing the iMobility 
sensors. For the 6MWT, each participant will walk as far as possible for 6 minutes along a 
defined walking course (e.g., hallway or corridor).  Participants will be instructed to walk and not to run or jog. Postural way will be assessed during 30- seconds of quiet standing .
38  TUG will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_269603] a chair, walk 7 meters, turn around and return to the chair in a seated position.

5.1.7  BODY COMPOSITION AND  BONE MINERAL DENSIT Y 
 
Total body fat mass, fat free or lean mass in kilograms, as well as bone mineral density for two 
clinically relevant sites (proximal femur and lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) will be determined by [CONTACT_11323] x -
ray absorptiometry (DXA) (Hologic -QDR Discovery Wi; APEX software, v.4.02) scan. The DXA 
scan will be performed by [CONTACT_7628].  Individual participant’s height as well as weight 
using a physician scale, will also be recorded at time of each DXA scanning visit.  Participants 
may refuse DXA and remain eligible for the study.

 All screening evaluations are to be conducted within 8 weeks prior to start of exercise 
intervention.  Screening (consultation) visit may occur as part of standard of care.  The following 
will be reviewed at screening:  
• Eligibility criteria  
• Informed consent obtained and documented 
 5.4 BASELINE ASSESSMENTS 
 All baseline assessments should be completed within 14 days before initiating the exercise intervention; however, these assessments may be performed during Week 1 prior to initiating 
exercise intervention.  
 
Eligible participants enrolled into this study will be asked to provide response to four 
questionnaires: GLTEQ, PROMIS -Cancer -PF, SF-[ADDRESS_328159] -F.  Surveys will be completed 
online unless the participants prefer to complete using a paper version.  Study staff will review 
surveys for completeness and follow -up with participants in person or by [CONTACT_269604].   
 
Participants should ideally complete initial physical function assessments (refer to Section 6.1.6) 
as well as body composition and bone mineral density (refer to Section 6.1.7 ) on same day.  
The exact order of the individual physical  function assessments will be determined by [CONTACT_269605], but should be preferentially maintained for all subsequent time- points.  This initial 
visit should take approximately 2 hours. If the visit is performed virtually, height, body compos ition and bone mineral density measures will be omitted.  
 At this  visit, participants will receive study exercise equipment and instructions from the EP 
regarding their individualized PRT regimen.  If this visit is performed virtually, participants will 
receive study exercise equipment via courier. Refer to Section 6.8, Schedule of Events for 
additional details.  
 5.5 ASSESSMENTS DURING T REATMENT  
 Participants will perform one weekly training under the supervision of an EP trainer via 1:[ADDRESS_328160] set of 1:1 videoconferencing will be 
used to observe and modify the PRT regimen for each participant.  Any changes to an individual 
participant’s PRT regimen (e.g., number of repetitions per set, number of sets, and/or mass of weights) should be recorded in the CRF.  After two weeks, the participant may decide to join a group video conference with 1- 2 other participants, or continue 1:1 with the EP. The weekly 
videoconferencing should ideally occur between Monday through Friday of each study week.  Under certain circumstances (e.g., technical difficulties ), videoco nferencing may be 
rescheduled.  The reason for rescheduling should be recorded in the CRF.

6. TREATMENT PLA N 
 
6.1 FUNCTIONAL RESISTANCE TRAINING REGIMEN 
 
Participants enrolled in this study will be assigned an individualized resistance training regimen 
that is based on guidelines from the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) .28,29,31   The 
resistance exercise regimen consists of upper and lower body exercises and may use free 
weights (i.e., dumbbells), weighted vests, resistance bands  and/or  the participants’ body weight .  
The resistance exercises employed in this study are all common to activities of daily living, and 
have been previously described .27,30   
 
In this study , participants will be assigned an individualized regimen consisting of PRT exercises 
that are to be performed 2 times per week for a total of 12 weeks  (Table 2).  Each exercise 
session will consist of a maximum of [ADDRESS_328165] one day between each exercise session.

Following the baseline assessment, the EP trainer will individualize the participant’s training 
program; additional modifications to the exercise program may be introduced during video 
session s as necessary. 
 The individualized t raining regimen will be progressive, and the intensity of each exercise will be 
dependent on the resistance relative to the participant’s capability .  
 
6.1.1  INITIALTRAINING SESSION   
 
If the initial visit is performed in-person,  participants will be provided with the necessary 
equipment (i.e., resistance bands, weights, weighted vest as appropriate) and receive in- person  
verbal and written instruction from an EP trainer on how to use the equipment and perform each 
assigned exercise.  
 During periods of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_269580]- person contact, the initial study 
visit may be omitted, delayed, or delivered entirely virtually . If the initial visit is delivered virtually , 
participants will receive study exercise equipment via courier, verbal instruction from an EP trainer on how to use the equipment and perform each assigned exercise by [CONTACT_269610], and written instruction from an EP trainer on how to use the equipment and 
perform each assigned exercise by [CONTACT_54769]/or courier. Select testing measures will be 
adapted to this type of delivery. These testing measures include:  
• Weight  
• Physical Performance Battery (PPB)  
• All surveys will continue to be sent out electronically as previously described. If a participant needs a paper survey to complete the survey, one will be provided or their data will be marked as “missed” if study staff are unable to mail a paper survey to the participant during their outlined testing window.

 6.1.2  VIDEOCONFERENCING & INDEPENDENT EXERCI SE 
 
Each participant must have access to a device with internet connection and audio/video capability in order to be eligible for this study. A webcam may be provided if needed, but should 
be returned at the end of study. Participants will receive written instructions for installing and 
using the OHSU -approved videoconferencing software.  
 Participants will perform all exercise sessions remotely (e.g., at home) . One exercise session 
per week will be conducted under the supervision of an EP trainer using videoconferenci ng 
software.  During these web-based video conferences, the EP trainer will observe the 
participant  and provide feedback on technique, as well as implement progressive resistance 
(e.g., increase number of repetitions or increase weight) .  Each participant will also complete 
one-hour of prescribed resistance exercise independently each week and record their effort in a 
training log.  
 
6.1.3  END-OF-STUDY 3 MONTH FOLLOW -UP 
 
The exercise intervention will be conducted for a total of 12 weeks; however, participants will be 
encouraged to continue resistance training after completing the study  intervention.  An end of 
study visit will occur approximately 3 months ( ±14 days) after first  home PRT session .  During 
periods of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_269580]- person contact, the end of  study visit may 
be omitted, delayed, or delivered entirely virtually .  
 After successful completion of the end- of-study assessments, participants will be allowed to 
keep all study -related exercise equipment provided (e.g., resistance bands, dumbbells, 
weighted vests). Participants will be required to return the webcam if one was provided.  
 
6.2 EXERCISE MODIFICATIONS  
 
Between the initial assessment & first video- conferenced session, the EP trainer may further 
individualize each participants ’ training program.  These modifications will be introduced during 
the first videoconference training  session.  Alterations (individualization) of the exercise regimen 
will be based on the participant’s limitations.  These will primarily be related to decreased range 
of motion in a specific joint or reduced weight bearing potential in a muscle group.  Exercises 
involving that specific joint/muscle group will proceed “as tolerated.”   Exercises on the 
contralateral side will continue unaltered.  Any modifications to the exercises will be recorded in 
the participants’ training log.  
 If necessary, and at the discretion of the EP, the intensity of one or all exercises may be 
increased or decreased by  [CONTACT_269614], lower band resistanc e, or time held for 
each exercise. All changes will be recorded in the participants’ training log.   
 
6.2.1  EXERCISE DELAYS 
 In general, interruptions to scheduled exercise sessions are permitted in the case of medical /

29 
 surgical events or logistical reasons (e.g., elective surgery, unrelated medical events, vacation, 
and holidays) not related to study intervention.  Participants should resume exercise intervention within 2 weeks of the scheduled interruption, unless otherwise discussed with the investigator. The reason for interruption should be documented in the CRF. 
 Missed exercise sessions  (including videoconferencing)  may be completed within the same 
scheduled week as long as there is at least [ADDRESS_328166] between sessions .  
 
7. EFFICACY MEASURES 
 7.1 GLTEQ 
 To score the GLTEQ, the weekly frequencies of strenuous, moderate, and light activities are multiplied by [CONTACT_269615], five, and three, respectively.  Total weekly leisure activity is calculated in 
arbitrary units by [CONTACT_269616], as shown in the following formula:
 
Weekly leisure activity score = (9 × Strenuous) + (5 × Moderate) + (3 × Light)  
 The same method of score is applied for each specific question.  
 7.[ADDRESS_328167] deviation (SD) of 10.  The 
standardized T -score is reported as the final score for each participant as follows:  
• Scores 0.5 – 1.0 SD worse than the mean = mild symptoms/impairment  
• Scores 1.0 – 2.0 SD worse than the mean = moderate symptoms/impairment  
• Scores 2.0 SD or more worse than the mean = severe symptoms/impairment  
 
7.3 QUALITY OF LIFE  (SF-36) 
 Scoring and analysis of the SF -36 survey will be performed as previously described.
35  All items 
in this survey are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state.   
 7.4 FATIGUE (FACT -F) 
Fatigue was assessed using the Functional Assessment of  Chronic Illness Therapy – Fatigue 
(FACT -F) scale. This is a [ADDRESS_328168] week. The scale has high internal consistency
36 and is widely used in the 
literature.  
  
7.5 SHORT PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE  BATTERY (PPB)  
 
The short PPB consists of three timed tests: [ADDRESS_328169] is scored 0 (unable) to 4, based on quartiles of performance,40 
then scores are summed.  Higher scores indicate better physical function.

7.8 GAIT AND BALAN CE 
 Balance and gait will be measured using body worn sensors  (iMobility, APDM, Inc.) , which  
continuously and wirelessly  record 3D linear accelerations and angular velocity . An 
instrumented postural sway test (I Sway) will record center of pressure displacement and 
acceleration signals during 30-second s of quiet standing .
41 iMobility is also used for an 
instrumented version of the timed- up-and-GO (TUG) test, iTUG, to detect changes in mobility in 
patients that may not be not apparent from a stopwatch score.[ADDRESS_328172] (i6MWT) while wearing the 
iMobility  sensors. In addition to the standard metrics obtained from iMobility, the number of 
meters walked during the 6- minutes will also be recorded.   
 
7.9 BODY COMPOSITION AND  BONE MINERAL DENSIT Y 
 
Body composition w ill be expressed as % whole- body lean mass and leg lean mass (kg). 
Coefficients of variation (CV) for lean and fat mass in our laboratory are <1.0% . DXA scans will 
be analyzed following standard procedures  (Hologic Inc) .  Visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous 
(SAT) ad ipose tissue will also be quantified from the whole body scans.  
 Trained research staff will utilize the DXA manufacturer software (Apex, Hologic Inc.)  to analyze 
each scan by [CONTACT_269617]. The trained research staff member will analyze the scan by 
[CONTACT_269618].  In general,  the software will automatically detect bone edges; however, if 
needed, a trained research staff  can intervene to manually identify the bone edges.  Once 
analyzed, the scan will be saved and archived with the results of the analysis included.

 8.2 REPORTING PROCEDURES  
Adverse events during exercise sessions will be graded according to their significance for 
seve re consequences, such as injury or death, using the following grades determined by [CONTACT_269619]. In this study we do not anticipate moderate or serious adverse events.  
 
• A serious adverse event is defined as any event that is life- threatening or disabling and 
requiring medical attention. Serious adverse events that may occur during exercise in this study include death and cardiovascular events, though these are extremely rare in 
the absence of significant cardiac pathology.  
 
• A moderate adverse event is defined as any event that resolves with treatment. 
Moderate adverse events that may occur during exercise include symptoms, such as shortness of breath and orthostatic intolerance.  
 
• A mild adverse event is defined as any event that does not require treatment.  Reports of 
side effects, such as muscle soreness, moderate tiredness while exercising, and similar discomforts are mild adverse events.  
 
• An unexpected adverse event is defined as any event that does not include physical harm. Examples of unexpected adverse events may include breaches of confidentiality, emotional harms, or complaints about study procedures or conduct of investigators.  
 A survey (Adverse Events Survey) was created by [CONTACT_269620]’ 12- week long participation in the study. 
Adverse events reported through this survey will be followed- up by [CONTACT_171685] a phone call 
when the self -reported severity is a 5 (moderate) or greater or if more information is needed to 
determine reportability. Participants will also have the opportunity to report adverse events 
during the home- program video calls.  
 
Serious adverse events will be reported immediately to the Principal Investigator (PI), who will immediately notify all other investigators. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_269584] a full written report to the OHSU 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) within 24 hours of notification of the serious event, as required by [CONTACT_269621]. Specifically, the following will be reported, in writing:  
1.  All deaths in study participants, during the intervention period, regardless of 
cause,  
2.  All serious adverse events associated with the study procedures  
 Cardiac events or deaths are very rare in persons engaging in low or moderate intensity exercise, though it is possible that a person with previously undisclosed cardiovascular disease 
may experience a cardiac event or death during exercise. Regardless of cause, we are required 
to notify the OHSU IRB within 24 hours if a participant dies during this study.  
 Moderate adv erse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_978], who will notify members of the research 
team if trends are identified. If trends are noted, preventive measures will be implemented, such 
as providing education of participants in the study to emphasize prevention of the adverse event. 
Moderate adverse events will be included in annual reports to the OHSU IRB.  
 Mild adverse events will be entered in progress notes. Participants will receive advice on avoiding such events.

9.2 DESCRIPTION OF STATI STICAL METHODS  
 
9.2.1  GENERAL APPROACH  
 This is a single -arm, prospective study to assess feasibility of implementing a resistance training 
regimen in sarcoma survivors.   
 9.2.2  ANALYSIS OF PRIMARY  AND SECONDARY FEASIBILITY  ENDPOINT S 
 
Among evaluable participants, the retention rate,  exercise adherence rate and rate of PRT 
prescriptions provided will be estimated using percentage and 95% confidence interval . The 
incidence of exercise- related serious adverse events will be evaluated using descriptive 
statistics.
 The primary objective of feasibility will be determined by [CONTACT_269622] 90% 
participant retention [i.e., 9 of 10 patients complete end- of-intervention assessments] with more 
than 75% exercise adherence rate [each participants completed end- of-intervention assessment 
also completed at least 18 of 24 prescribed training sessions] without related serious adverse 
events. Successful development of individualized PRT prescription based on functional limitations also be determined as a secondary feasibility measure [100% of subjects receive individualized PRT prescription].  
 9.2.3  ANALYSIS OF THE SECO NDARY EFFICACY ENDPOINTS  
 
The efficacy measurements, including four questionnaires  (GLTEQ, PROMIS -Cancer -PF, SF-[ADDRESS_328175] -F) and physical assessments  (short PPB, 1RM, grip strength,  i6MWT, iTUG, I Sway) 
wearable mobility sensor) at baseline and at end of exercise intervention (i.e., 3 months from 
start of PRT regimen)  will be summarized as mean and standard deviation. We also compare 
scores at baseline and at [ADDRESS_328176] ORATORY ENDPOINTS  
Body composition and bone mineral density at baseline and end of exercise intervention ( i.e., 3 
months from start of PRT regimen) will be summarized as mean and standard deviation. They 
are also be compared using paired t -Test to determine if a 3- month resistance- training program 
improves body composition and bone mineral density in sarcoma survivors.

9.4 HANDLING OF MISSING DATA 
 Every attempt will be made to obtain data at the defined time points as described in the primary and secondary endpoints.  We will examine dropout and patterns of missing data to determine mechanisms (MCAR, MAR or not ignorable).  In the case of data missing MCAR or MAR, mixed -effect m odel will allow unbiased parameter estimation using all available data.  We will 
adapt an imputation technique if missing is not a completed random.  
 
10. CLINICAL MONITORING

research at OHSU.  
 As described in the Knight DSMP, regardless of a trial’s risk level and any specific Knight oversight in place, the Investigator  is singularly responsible for overseeing every aspect of the 
design, conduct, and final analysis of his/her investigation.  
 The Knight DSMC  will review and monitor study progress, toxicity, safety and other data from 
this study.   Information that raises any questions about participant safety or protocol 
performance will be addressed by [CONTACT_737] , statistician and study team. Should any 
major concerns arise, the Knight DSMC  may recommend corrective action and determine  
whether or not to suspend the study.  
 
The Knight DSMC will review each protocol every 6 months,  but may occur more often, if 
required, to review toxicity and accrual data (please refer to Knight DSMP for additional details 
on audit frequency).  The Knight DSMC  will review accrual, toxicity, response and reporting 
information. Information to be provided to the DSMC  may include: participant accrual; treatment 
regimen information; AEs and SAEs  reported by [CONTACT_17203]; summary of any deaths on study; 
audit results; and a summary provided by [CONTACT_3476].   Other information (e.g. scans, 
laboratory values) will be provided upon request.

INTRODUCTION  
WHAT IS THE USUAL AP PROACH AFTER COMPLETING SAR COMA TREATMENT? 
You are being asked to take part in this study because you have previou sly received treatment for a sarcoma . 
Treatments for sarcoma can cause side effects such as fatigue, muscle loss, and weakness, which can 
negatively impact your ability to physically function and enjoy an  independent lifestyle . People who do not 
take part in this study may receive recommendations such as encouragement to exercise, and/or ways to 
adjust their daily activities to help combat some of the  physical side effects of cancer trea tment.  
 
WHAT ARE MY OTHER CHOICES IF I DO NOT TA KE PART IN THIS STUD Y? 
If you decide not to take part in this study, you have other choices. For example:  
• you may choose to continue your current care without change  
• you may choose to take part in a different  study, if one is available  
 
PURPOSE 
WHY IS THIS STUDY BE ING DONE?  
The purpose of this study is to assess the  feasibility of using  a routine resistance training exercise regimen as a 
means to improve physical function in sarcoma cancer survivors. The study  also aims  to determine if a 3-
month exercise program improves body composition and bone density in sarcoma survivors post -treatment.  
The resistance training exercise regimen  we are studying is experimental.  We do not know if it is better than 
the usual approach for improving physical function in people that have been treated for sarcoma.  
This is a clinical trial, a type of research study. Medical personnel who carry out research studies are called “investigators.” The investigator will explain the clinical trial to you. Clinical trials include only people who  
choose to take part. Please take your time to make your decision about taking part. You can discuss your  
decision with your friends and family. You can also discuss it with your health care tea m or another doctor. If  
you have any questions, ask the investigator.  
 
WHAT DATA WILL BE CO LLECTED?  
We are asking you to provide information for a data bank, also called a repository. This information will be  
stored indefinitely and may be used and disclosed in the future for research.  We will ask you to provide the 
following information:  
• Your demographics – your current age and your sex, race, ethnicity, and the zip code where you 
currently live.

• Your sarcoma history – the age at which you were diagnosed, your specific diagnosis (for example, 
rhabdomyosarcoma or osteosarcoma), and what you remember about the treatment you received 
(which might have included chemotherapy, surgery, and/or radiation).  
• Your medical history – other cancers you may have also been diagnosed with, any chronic illnesses you 
might have, and any surgeries you’ve had that weren’t related to your sarcoma.  
 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THIS S TUDY?   
As many as 10  people will take part in this study, which will be conducted at Oregon Health & Science 
University (OHSU).   
 
PROCEDURES  
STUDY DESIGN OVERVIE W 
 
 
HOW LONG WILL I BE I N THIS STUDY?  
You will receive an individualized therapeutic resistance exercise plan to complete over a 12 -week period. 
After you finish the resistance exercise regimen , your doctor will see you for a 3 -month follow up visit to 
assess side effects . The total length of your participation is about 3-months.

Cons ent Vers ion: 4.[ADDRESS_328191] IF  I TAKE PART IN THIS  STUDY?  
Before you begin the study:  
If you are in terested in participating, you will be asked a few questions regarding your cancer history, current  
physical activity, and quality of life. Your doctor will assess you for medical clearance for you to participate in 
exercise training before your exercise p lan starts. Physician clearance is required to participate in the study 
because it will help ensure your safety to perform moderate level intensity exercise. We will collect information about your cancer diagnosis and treatment from your medical records. Y ou will next be scheduled 
to complete a series of baseline assessments (see below) with a Research Assistant.  You will need to have the 
following  tests and procedures to find out if you can be in the study:  
 Baseline assessment visit:  
• Record height and weight   
• DXA  scan  to evaluate your bone density and body composition. A urine pregnancy test for 
women who can become pregnant is required prior to DXA scan.  
• Questionnaires , which will take roughly 1 hour  to complete . 
• A series of physical tests to measure a  baseline for strength, balance, and function.  A Research 
Assistant will guide you through a series of activities. These activities include rising and sitting 
from a chair five times as quickly as you can and rising from a chair, walking about [ADDRESS_328192] suit 
your needs.  
 
During the study:  
If the exams, tests, and procedures show that you can take part in the study, and you choose to take part, 
then you will be asked to complete a one -hour exercise training session two times per week  for the next [ADDRESS_328193] two weeks, p articipants will perform one weekly training under the supervision of a 
trainer via 1 :[ADDRESS_328194] (EP) trainer will create an individualized  training  program  for you. After two weeks, 
you may decide to join a group video conference with 1 -2 other participants, or continue 1:1 with the EP.  
At the baseline visit, participants will be provided with the necessary equipment (i.e., resistance bands, 
weights , weighted vest as appropriate) and receive in- person verbal and written instruction from a trainer on 
how to use the equipment and perform each assigned exercise.

Participants will perform all exercise sessions remotely (e.g., at home). One exercise session per week will be 
conducted under the supervision of an EP trainer using videoconferencing software.  During these web- based 
video conferences, the EP trainer will observe the participant and provide feedback on technique, as well as 
implement progressi ve resistance (e.g., increase number of repetit ions or increase weight).  Each participant 
will also complete one -hour of prescribed resistance exercise independently each week and record in a 
provided training log . 
 The exercise intervention will be conducted for a total of [ADDRESS_328195] UDY?   
DXA Scans: In this study you will be exposed to radiation during the DXA scans. While no radiation dose has 
been determined to be entirely safe, the amount to which you will be exposed is not known to cause health 
problems.  For women of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be checked prior to the DXA scan.  
 
Physical Tests: There are some discomforts  and risks from the physical tests. In order to try to minimize risks, 
all testing will be conducted by [CONTACT_21724]. You may feel sore after the physical tests. Muscle soreness usually goes away after two or three days. You may sustain an injury duri ng the physical testing. The risk of 
this is low and the researchers are trained to show you the best ways to avoid injury during the tests.  
 Questionnaires: As part of this study, you will be asked to complete questionnaires. Some of these questions 
may s eem very  personal or embarrassing. They may upset you. You may refuse to answer any of the questions 
that you do not wish to answer. If the questions make you very upset, we will help you to find a counselor.  
 As with any form of regular exercise training,  the risk of injury is increased. We have taken precautions to  
make the exercises as safe as possible. The exercises will be led by a certified exercise professional. The study  
exercises have been performed before in cancer survivors who have reported no s ignificant injuries as a result 
of the study.  
 Here are important points about how you and the investigator can make these risks less of a problem:

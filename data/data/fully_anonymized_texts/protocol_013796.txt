Study Indication:  
Angelman syndrome (AS)  
 
Study Rationale  
OV101 (gaboxadol) is being evaluated in Phase  [ADDRESS_1147334] 
characteristics. Consistent clinical findings range in severity and include developme ntal delay, movement 
and/or balance disorder, and tremulous movement of limbs. Perhaps the most unique behavioral 
characteristic is the combination of a happy demeanor, smiling, and frequent bouts of laughter. Moreover, 
these individuals possess an easily excitable personality exhibited by [CONTACT_35681] -flappi[INVESTIGATOR_827008]. Finally, these individuals suffer from motor dysfunction related to gait and balance, severe 
disruptions in sleep, impairments in speech, and frequent seizures with characteristic abnorm al 
electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns. Individuals with AS will require life -long care.  
OV101 is the first highly selective extrasynaptic gamma -aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonist that 
binds to the α4 and δ -subunit  containing  extrasynaptic GABA receptors as an orthosteric agonist and may 
restore the deficit in tonic inhibition that has been associated with AS. This is unlike any other 
GABAergic agent, including benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_827009] Z -drugs, neurosteroids and dru gs that 
act on GABA metabolism or uptake. Further, in a mouse model of AS, gaboxadol was shown to restore 
tonic inhibition in UBE3A -deficient cerebellar neurons and correct motor abnormalities in 
UBE3A -deficient mice.  
These results suggest that OV101 may a lleviate the motor dysfunction observed in individuals with AS. 
These potential effects on tonic inhibition may impact motor function in people with AS.  
Previous Phase [ADDRESS_1147335] sleep, resulting in an improvement in the quality and restorative 
effects of sleep. One study using a transient insomnia model involving 100  subjects showed that 
administration of OV101 resulted in statistically s ignificant improvements on both sleep induction and 
sleep maintenance. More importantly, these effects were achieved without the risk of drug dependence.

minimizing the risk of missing or confounded data, while data reliability is maintained.  
 
Phase of Development:  
Phase 2  
 
Study Design:  
Multicenter, randomized, parallel (3 -arm), double -blind, placebo -controlled  
 
Study Location:  
Approximately 15 specialized centers across the [LOCATION_002] of America  and 1 specialized site in Israel

Study Objectives and Endpoints:  
The primary objective  of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of OV101 from Baseline to 
Week  [ADDRESS_1147339] placebo:  
• Once da ily (Q D): An evening dose titrated to the target dose of 15  mg unless not tolerated  
• Twice daily (BID): Evening and morning doses titrated to the target doses of 15  mg evening dose 
and 10  mg morning dose unless not tolerated  
The safety endpoints that relate to this objective are as follows:  
• Frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events  (SAEs)  
• Vital signs (weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature)  
• Laboratory parameters (elect rolytes, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], glucose,  hepatic , renal and pancrea tic function tests, 
and hematology). It is in the discretion of the study center staff to apply local best practices to 
obtain a blood sample from the subject  
• Irritability will be assessed using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist – Community (ABC -C) in an 
attempt to assess suicidality  
• EEG  
• Caregivers will maintain an electronic seizure diary. Any clinically important changes, including 
changes in seizure medication, will be reported as a safety event  
• Physical Exam finding s

All safety and efficacy assessments will be performed as indicated in the schedule of assessments 
(Table  S2). Assessments such as laboratory sampling and EEG should be done towards the end of a visit 
to minimize any confounding impact on subject performance. Options to perform these safety assessments 
away from the study center prior to the study center visit will be assessed in collaboration with study 
center staff a nd approved by [CONTACT_827032], if required.  
Additional biomarker samples will be acquired from all subjects for whom the caregiver provides a 
separate informed consent for purification of DNA and plasma, to allow for identification of sec ondary 
pathogenic variants and metabolic profiles.  
 
Number of subjects (planned):  
Approximately 75  subjects will be enrolled. At the completion of the study, there will be approximately 
25 subjects in each of the 3 treatment groups: 1) single evening dose  2) morning and evening dose, and 
3) placebo.  
Sample size calculations for this study are based on the objective of estimating AE rates within each 
active treatment group. The sample size of 25  subjects per group provides sufficient precision for 
estimatio n of incidence of common AEs. For example, a 2 -sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for a true 
incidence of 25% will estimate that incidence with a 17% precision (half -width of the 95% CI).  
While the expected enrol lment is 25 subjects per treatment group, if  enrol lment expectations are not 
realized, the sample size may be as low as 20 subjects per group.  A sample size of 20 subjects per group 
provides sufficient precision for estimation of incidence of common AEs.  For example, a 2 -sided 95% CI 
for the true incidence of 25% will estimate that incidence with 19% precision.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Methodology:  
All subjects will receive a morning dose (either OV101 or placebo) and an evening dose (either OV101 or 
place bo) during the entire duration of treatment. The 2 dosing schedules of OV101 will be assessed ; a 
single evening dose (Q D): based on what was previously clinically assessed in the treatment of sleep 
disorder; Schedule  A) and a morning plus evening dose (Sch edule  B: BID) designed to provide a more 
sustained exposure. Schedule  C is morning and evening placebo. All subjects will be up -titrated to the 

Ovid Therapeutics Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  24 October 2017  
OV101 -15-001 (OV101 ) 
Protocol Version 4.0    Page 20 of 83 • Day 1: Treatment can start on any day during the week. The  next up -titration will occur on 
Day 3. If the defined interval occurs during the weekend , a + 2 day window for next titration step 
is acceptable , but the investigator should consider scheduling the start of treatment appropriately 
to limit titration steps occurring during the weekend . All subjects wil l start with 1  capsule 
(OV101 or placebo) in the evening  
Given the potential effects with food:  
• For the morning dose, it is recommended that the study drug be given with or shortly after the 
morning meal  
• For the evening dose, it is recommended that study drug be given within 30  minutes of scheduled 
bedtime  
Target up -titration  
• Day 3 (window +  2 days) : If no AE related to the study drug is observed from the previous time 
point by [CONTACT_827033]/or the investigator, another capsule (OV101 or placebo) is added in the 
evening  
• Day 7 (window +  2 days) : If no AE related to the study drug is observed from the previous time 
point by [CONTACT_827033]/or the investigator, another capsule (OV101 or placebo) is added in the 
evening  
• Day 10 (window +  2 days) : If no AE related to the study drug is observed from the previous time 
point by [CONTACT_827033]/or the investigator, another capsule ( OV101  or placebo) is added in the 
morning  
• Day 14 (window +  2 days):  If no AE related to the study drug is observed from the previous time 
point by [CONTACT_827033]/or the investigator, another capsule (OV101 or placebo) is added in the 
morning  
Slowed up -titration  
If tolerability does NOT allow immediate further dose -escalation at any of the above detailed 
days (3, 7, 10, or 14), but if that is poss ible at subsequent visit (e.g. Day  10 instead of Day  7), 
also such delayed up -titration will be acceptable. In such a case, the investigator will record 
up-titration data during the additional phone titrations calls. Any intolerability will be 
documented a s an AE. 
Down -titration  
Modifications may be made per investigator judgment on urgent need or medical necessity. If 
tolerability is not acceptable (e.g. somnolence, dizziness, vomiting, or change in behavior) after a 
previous up -titration step or during th e 12 week s of treatment, the Investigator should discuss 
with the Sponsor MM  or his/her delegate  if necessary . Any such intolerability must  be 
documented as an AE. Once a tolerable dose has been reached, it shall remain constant for the 
duration of the tre atment period.  
Ongoing treatment  
• Day 14: Earliest day the target dose can be reached (10 mg [ 2 capsules ] in the morning and 
15 mg [3 capsules] in the evening) : if so, dosing should be kept stable until the End of T reatment 
visit (Week  12) unless intolerabi lity requires down -titration per the above described conventions

8.1 Background  and O verview of Angelman Syndrome  
Angelman syndrome (AS) is a rare neurogenetic disorder associated with  the deletion of 
or mutation in the Ubiquiti n Protein Ligase E3A gene ( UBE3A ). While expressed 
ubiquitously in the cells of  other tissues, in neurons the p aternal allele is preferentially 
silenced through the epi[INVESTIGATOR_827013]. Therefore, any alteration in 
the maternal copy of UBE3A  results in the expression of the AS phenotype.  The 
syndrome occurs in approximately [ADDRESS_1147345] 
characteristics . Clinical findings range in severity and may include developmental delay, 
movement and/or balance disorder, and tremulous movement of limbs . The most unique 
behavioral characteristic is the combination of a happy demeano r, smiling , and easily 
provoked . Moreover, these individuals possess a short attention span and an easily 
excitable personalit y exhibited by [CONTACT_35681] -flappi[INVESTIGATOR_827014] . Finally, 
individuals with AS suffer from motor dysfunction related to gait and balance, severe 
disruptions in sleep, impairments in speech, anxiety, and frequent seizures with 
characteristic abnormal electr oencephalogram (EEG) patterns1.  
Current Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_827015] . Clinical management includes 
management of symptoms including anti -epi[INVESTIGATOR_827016] s for sleep or anxiety . Physical and occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
communication therapy, and behavioral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_827017] A S to reach their maximum developmental potential2. 
Pre-clinical  Experience  with OV101 
Research has shown that absence (or dysfunction) of UBE3A  results in an aberrant 
increase in the uptake of  gamma -aminobutyric acid (GABA), which the main inhibitory 
neurotransmitter in the brain. OV101 is the first highly selective GABA receptor agonist 
that binds to the α4 and δ -containing GABA A receptors. These receptors mediate tonic 
inhibition and contribute to sleep maintenance. Further, in a mouse model of AS, 
gaboxadol was shown to restore tonic inhibition in Ube3a-deficient cerebellar neurons 
and co rrect motor abnormalities in Ube3a-deficient mice3. 
These results suggest that OV101 may alleviate the motor dysfunction observed in 
individuals with AS. Importantly, OV101’s ability to potentiate tonic inhibition is unlike 
any other GABAergic agent, incl uding benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730], other Z -drugs, 
neurosteroids, and drugs that act on GABA metabolism or uptake.  
In addition to the data on presynaptic dysfunction leading to reduced tonic inhibition, 
there are additional studies which speak to the potential  of OV101 in AS, including 
modulation of sleep and cognition domains that are impaired in AS subject s4,5,6,7,8,9.

Protocol Version [ADDRESS_1147346] prior to OV101  administration in the morning or evening delayed absorption by 
0.5 to 1  hours and decreased maximum concentration by [CONTACT_3450] 30%, while 
exposure was practically unchanged compared with the fas ting state.  
Prior Clinical Experience  
OV101 was generally safe and well tolerated in all Phase  [ADDRESS_1147347] s (aged 18 to 64  years) at doses 
up to 15  mg (in 1 early  Phase  2 study up t o 20  mg). In non -elderly adult subject s, the 
most common adverse events (AEs) occurring more frequently in OV101 -treated subject s 
than in subject s on placebo were dizziness, nausea, vomiting, somnolence, and headache. 
Most AEs were of mild to moderate inte nsity. Generally, tolerability was better in male 
than in female subject s. 
OV101  administration in the morning was safe at all doses 12. In healthy 
young men, doses up to [ADDRESS_1147348] incidences were dizziness, nausea, headache, and somnolence. The majority of 
AEs h ad a rapid onset (within [ADDRESS_1147349] -dose) and resolved after the drug was 
discontinued.  

Ovid Therapeutics Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  24 October 2017  
OV101 -15-001 (OV101 ) 
Protocol Version 4  Page 28 of 83 Approximate ly 500  subjects were exposed to OV101 in c linical studies in 
non-insomnia -related development. The safety and tolerability profi le of OV101 in the 
non-insomnia -related studies was similar to that in sleep disorder studies. In general, the 
AEs seemed to be dose related, with no AEs reported for the 5  mg dose, and only mild 
AEs reported for the 10  mg dose of OV101.  
8.2 Study Rationale  
OV101  acts with high potency and efficacy at extrasynaptic α4  and δ -containing GABA A 
receptors which are not activated by [CONTACT_24658][INVESTIGATOR_1651], or agents acting at the 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_226993] (such as zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730], zaleplon, indiplon, and zopi[INVESTIGATOR_11123]) . These 
extrasynaptic δ receptors are thought to be involved in mechanisms underlying tonic 
inhibition and sleep maintenance. In vivo  and in vitro  studies have shown that neither 
alcohol nor benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_827018]101. In contrast to 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_182954], no withdrawal effects with OV101 are seen after 
chronic dosing . 
The possibility that OV101 may alleviate the motor dysfunction observed in individuals 
with AS and the ability of OV101 to potentiate tonic inhibition makes OV101 a candidate 
for potential tre atment of people with AS . 
Based on previous clinical experienc e, in  this study OV101 will be titrated  across 
different dose levels (15  mg evening dose and 10  mg morning dose) and in 3 dosing 
schedules for 12  weeks.  
The morning dose was selected based on a Phase  1 study in healthy volunteers which 
determined that a 10  mg morning dose had a comparable safety profile compared to 
placebo. The evening dose was selected based on the safety and efficacy data obtained 
from all studies conducted by H.  Lundbeck A/S and [COMPANY_006] in the indication of insomnia 
(reference to IND 64 ,567). 
This Phase  [ADDRESS_1147350] on caregivers will also be assessed . Questionnaires, diaries ,  will be 
used, complemented by [CONTACT_827035]  (gait analysis ). 
Testing may be extensive for some of the study subjects, so the highest possible level of 
flexibility will be applied to the schedule of assessments at each study center  visit to 
minimize the risk of missing or confounded data, while maintaining data reliability . 
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol and with the International 
Conference on Harmoni zation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  More information 
can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure .10

Protocol Version 4    Page 35 of 83 10.1.3  Study Assessments  
Section  14 details the individual assessments . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Screening Period  (Day -28 to Day  0) 
After obtaining a signed informed consent form (ICF) from the parent or legally 
authorized caregiver and assent as appropriate from the potential subject, individuals with 
AS will begin the study screening procedures for eligibility including clinical and 
laboratory evaluation and all measurements  used for efficacy assessment (sleep, motor 
function , and behavior) . Assent will be obtained if the investigator believes that the 
subject can provide  it depending on the subject’s intellectual ability, but ass ent may not 
be relevant for non -verbal subject s. 
Investigators will explain to caregivers the necessity to discontinue the intermittent use of 
sleep medication and not to introduce new medication during the study . 
 
 
 
 
Study centers will request a subject registration and treatment code centrally ge nerated by 
[CONTACT_53804]  (IWRS) (Section  12.3). No subject may begin 
treatment prio r to assignment of a unique identification number ( registration) and 
randomization. Any subject identification numbers that are assigned will not be reused, 
even if the sub ject does not receive treatment . 
Screening laboratory assessments will be performed.  
Caregivers will also be asked  to sign a separate ICF for the subject to provid e an 
additional blood sample (1  tube) at Baseline (and on Day  84 [Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ]) to permit 
purification of DNA and plasma to enable identification of secondary pathogenic gene 
variants and allow for metabolic profiling. Those not consenting to this will still be 
eligibl e for the main study.  
All subjects will be screened for participation in the study up to [ADDRESS_1147352]’s 
seizures  
 
 
 
. 
During the screening period, it will be determined by [CONTACT_827036] y with study procedures.

OV101 -15-001 (OV101 ) 
Protocol Version 4    Page 36 of 83 For those without  documentation of a molecularly -confirmed  diagnosis, blood  samples 
will be obtained during the screening period and subjected to methylation sensitive 
polymerase chain reaction amplification of a portion of the small nuclear 
ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N  gene  and/or UBE3A  gene sequencing to confirm the 
diagnosi s of AS . 
 
 
 
 
  
Screening and Baseline assessments must be performed within the 28-day period. If the 
subject can perform the Screening and Baseline visit within 5 days, the following 
assessments do not need to be repeated at the Baseline visit (medical history, clinical 
assessment, physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, serum pregnancy test, and 
concomitan t medications ).  
Those not  meeting the inclusion criteria or meeting an exclusion criterion  will be 
considered a screen f ailure. It shall be discussed with Medical Monitor whether later 
rescreening is acceptable.  Rescreening may be allowed under circumstan ces where the 
subject passed the screening but could not be randomized within the [ADDRESS_1147353] result (lab or any other tests) is considered uncertain  or abnormal , the 
test may be repeated to confirm the result after approval from the Medical Monitor. If a 
subject needs a repeat lab or additional lab to confirm eligibility the scr eening period may 
be extended.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment Period  (12 Weeks)  
Baseline Visit (Day  1; Full Day V isit) 
Eligible subjects will return to the study center  for the Baseline ( Day 1) visit . Caregivers 
will bring the e -Diary and wearables. Prior to randomization, study center  staff must  
confirm pr oper recording of the wearables, appropriate completion of the e -Diary, and 
fulfilment of all selection criteria.  
Subjects will be randomized on a 1:1:1  ratio according to the following dosing 
schedule:  
• Schedule A : a singl e evening dose of OV101 (Q D) plus morning placebo  
• Schedule B : a morning plus evening dose  of OV101  (BID ) 
• Schedule C : morning and evening placebo  
• Subjects will receive the assigned package of blinded study treatment as per 
treatment code for the titration period and until the next scheduled visit at Week  6 
• Baseline safety and efficacy assessments will be conducted

The e -Diary will be kept by [CONTACT_827037]. It must  be charged 
overnight each day by [CONTACT_18629]. Study center  staff shall remotely check data 
completeness at least once a week and contact [CONTACT_84452] i f there is non -adherence , such as 
missing data.  
Titration (Day  1 to Day  14) 
Section 12.1.1  details the dosing schedule . 
During the titration period (Day  1 to Day  14), doses progressively increase in 5  mg 
increments according to the titration schedule, allowing slower up - or down -titration if 
the OV101  or placebo treatment is not tolerated ( Table  2) up to a target evening dose of 
15 mg ( 3 capsules ) in Schedules  A and B, and up to a target morning dose of 10  mg 
(2 capsules ) in Schedule  B. Multiple phone visits are scheduled to confirm tolerab ility of 
study treatment.  Each dose -escalation will be performed after adequate tolerability has 
been assessed by [CONTACT_827038] a phone visit. At any t ime, ad -hoc 
study center visits may occur  to further assess drug safety.  These should follow the script 
for phone visits.  
If the target dose is not achieved at Day  14 (due to slowed titration based on 
intolerability), the up -titration can continue until th e target dose or the maximum 
tolerated dose is reached. Additional phone visits to agree on next titration level will be 
performed.  As a general guidance for investigators, for subjects undergoing a slowed 
titration regimen, the maximal tolerated dose for the duration of the study should be 
reached by [CONTACT_2006]  21. 
Investigators will decide whether to up- or down -titrate  based on subject 
symptomatology , which should be  discussed with the Sponsor MM or his/her delegate as 
necessary . The study center  will d ocument each titration step in the  electronic case report 
form ( eCRF) and in source documents. The AEs triggering any slower - or down -titration 
will be recorded. Modifications may be made per investigator judgment based on urgent

tolerable dose has been reached, it shall remain constant for the duration of the treatment 
period.  The study  center will provide the caregiver with written dosing instructions  until 
the next titrati on step, by [CONTACT_6791], e -mail, or during an unscheduled study center visit.  
Treat ment (Day  15 to Day  84); Until E nd of Week  12 
If the target d ose was not yet achieved at Day  14 (due to slowed titration based on 
intolera bility), up-titration can continue until the target dose or the maxi mum tolerated 
dose is reached. Additional phone visits to ag ree on next titration level will be performed.  
As a general guidance for investigators, for subjects undergoing a slowed titration 
regimen, the maximal tolerated dose fo r the duration of the study should be reached by 
[CONTACT_2006] 21. 
At D ays 30 and 6 0 (±2 days) the caregiver will courier the wearables back to the study 
center , because battery life will come to an end around that tim e. Study center staff will 
upload and check data  for any compliance or user errors. If errors are detected, the 
caregiver will be c ontacted to receive further instructions how to properly use the 
wearable. S tudy center  staff will courier a new set of wearables to the caregiver.  
Interim Visi t (Week  6; Fu ll Day V isit) 
During the Week  6 visit (Day  43, window ±3  days); subjects will make an interim full 
day study center visit to for the following procedures:   
• All scheduled safety and efficac y assessments will be conducted  
•

End of Treatment ( Week  12; Full Day V isit) 
During the Week  12 visit (Day  84, window + 3 days); subjects will make a final full day 
study center visit for the following procedures:  
• Safety and efficacy assessments  
•  
          
 
  
  
 
 
 
• Caregivers will bring the e -Diary to the study center.  Any e-Diarie s no longer

study center closure  
• Subjects will be asked to voluntee r an additional tube of blood to permit 
purification of DNA and plasma to enable identification of secondary pathogenic 
gene variants an d allow for metabolic profiling  
• The last dose of study drug should be taken the morning of the Day [ADDRESS_1147356] titration of OV101 is not necessary given that in previous 
clinical studies with OV101, no withdrawal effects were observed after chronic 
dosing.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow -Up Period (Day  85 to 98) 
During the follow -up period, the study center will have  1 phone visit ( 2 weeks after End 
of Treatment) to capture information on any AEs which occur  after the End of Treatment  
visit, using th e phone v isit script.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Early Termination  
The study may be terminated at an individual study center if it becomes apparent that 
subject enrol lment is unsatisfactory with respect to quality and/or quantity. Study centers 
may also be closed if they prove to be unable to comply with the requirements of the 
protocol or GCP, or data recording is inaccurate and/or incomplete. If the study is 
terminated in an individual study center  for any reason, the investigator must make every 
effort to follow -up all subjects as planned according to the protocol. Replacement of  
study center s is allowed and new study center s may be initiated. An initiative for study 
center closure or study termination can be taken at any time either by [CONTACT_827039].  CONFIDENTIAL  24 October 2017

10.3 Risk/Benefit Assessment  
In adult subject s, the most common AEs occurring more frequently in OV101 -treated 
subject s than in subject s on placebo have been dizziness, nausea, vomiting, somnolence , 
and headache . Most AEs have been mild to moderate severity . OV101  is genera lly 
tolerated better by [CONTACT_43383] s than female s and has been generally safe and well tolerated in 
Phase [ADDRESS_1147358] the exposure of OV101 is comparable to young adult subjects  given the 
same d ose. The dosing recommendation for adolescents in this study is therefore the 
same as for adults.  
Close monitoring of safety  will be conducted throughout this study.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Slowed Up -Titration  
If tolerability does NOT allow immediate further dose -escalation at any of the above 
detailed days  (3, 7, 10, or 14), but does at subsequent visit (e.g. Day  10 instead of Day  7), 
delayed up -titrat ion will also be acceptable. In this case, the investigator will record 
up-titration data during the additional phone titrations calls. Any such intolerability must 
be documented as an AE. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Down -Titration  
Modifications may be made per investigator judgment on urgent need  or medical 
necessity. If tolerability is not acceptable (e.g. somnolence, dizziness, vomiting, or 
change in behavior) after a previous up -titration step  or during the course of the 12  weeks 
of treatment,  the Investigator should discuss with the Sponsor MM  or his/her delegate if 
necessary.  Any such intolerability must be documented as an AE. Once a tolerable dose 
has been reached, it shall remain constant for the duration of the treatment period.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Ongoing Treatment  
Day 14: Earliest day the target dose can be  reached (10 mg [2 capsules ] in the morning 
and 15 mg [ 3 capsules] in the evening) : if so, dosing should be kept stable  until End of 
Treatment visit (Week  12) unle ss intolerability requires down -titration according to the

investigator at that study center  may perform immediate unblinding through IWRS 
without the need for communication with the  Medical Monitor.  
In the event that emergency unblinding is performed, the investigator can view and must 
print the blinded confirmation document from IWRS . The investigator must record on the 
confirmation document printout the reason for the emergency unblinding, and sign the 
document . The confirmation document must then to be kept in a safe place until the end 
of the study . Once a randomi zation code has been broken, the investigator must inform

with 58  items: irritability, agitation, and crying  (15 items), lethargy, social 
withdrawal  (16 items), stereotypy (7  items), hyperactivity/noncompliance 
(16 items), and inappropriate speech (4  items) . Most individuals with AS are not 
able to communicate thoughts of suicidality, so subject irritability reported by [CONTACT_827042] a surrogate measure of suicidality.  
• The ABC –C Irritability subscale will be used as an indicator for 
suicida lity. The investigator will review the scale items with the caregiver 
at each scheduled time point. If grading worsens, the investigator must 
decide whether that indicates a suicidal ideation of the subject, and if so, 
must document it as an AE and closely  monitor it until resolution. The 
ABC -C Irritability subscale will be used to assess risks of suicidality 
(safety variable).  The Aberrant Behavior Checklist  was developed for use 
with individuals living in institutions and residential settings. Revisions t o 
the measure have made it more applicable for home and school settings; 
the commonly used measure is now the ABC -C version.

Adverse Event  (AE)  
An AE is defined as any u ntoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, 
administered a pharmaceutical product, and which  does not n ecessarily have a causal 
relationship with th is treatment . An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding) , symptom or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigation al) product , whether or not related to 
the medic inal (investigational) product.  
Determination of whether an abnormal laboratory value meets the definition of an A E 
will be made by [CONTACT_093] . Although abnormal laboratory values  are typi[INVESTIGATOR_827023] s, the following considerations may result in an abnormal laboratory value 
being considered an AE:  
• A laboratory test result meets the criteria for an SAE  
• A laboratory test result requires the subjects to receive specific corrective therapy  
• A laboratory abnor mality that the investigator considers to be clinically 
significant  
Any intolerance that triggers a dose reduction during the titration period must  be 
documented as an AE. 
Treatment -Emergent Adverse Event  (TEAE)  
A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is  defined as an AE with an onset that 
occurs after receiving study drug (AE start date ≥  first dose date) and within [ADDRESS_1147386] dos e of study drug (AE start date minus  last dose date ≤  30), or an AE 
that occurs pre -treatment but worsen s post treatment . 
Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  
An SAE  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose :

opi[INVESTIGATOR_827026]  
• The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment is the 
sole reason for the int ervention or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Recording of Adverse Events  
For the purposes of this study, any detrimental change in the subject’s condition, from the 
screening visit  (Day -28) and up to completion of the follow -up period after the last 
administration of study drug (Day  98 follow -up phone visit) should be considered an AE 
and must be recorded on the eCRF.  
All SAEs and AEs will be recorded starting from the screening visit (Day -28). 
All ongoing A Es should be followed up for [ADDRESS_1147387] administration of study 
drug, with the exception of any ongoing study drug -related AEs, which should be 
followed until resolution, unless in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the AE is unlikely to 
resolve due to the  subject ’s underlying disease. Any new SAEs occurring up to [ADDRESS_1147388] administration of study  drug (Day  98 follow -up phone visit) should be 
reported  according to Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
At any time after the follow -up visit , if an investigator learns of an SAE that can be 
reasonably related to study drug, he/she should prom ptly notify Ovid Therapeutics Inc.  
Ovid Therapeutics Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  24 October 2017  
OV101 -15-001 (OV101 ) 
Protocol Version 4    Page 60 of 83 The severity of AEs and SAEs will be graded using the National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for  Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version  4). Any AE not 
listed in the CTCAE will be graded as follows:  
 
Severity Grade  Definition  
1 Mild AE  
2 Moderate AE  
3 Severe or  medically significant AE  
4 Life-threatening AE  
5 Death related to AE  
 
It is important to distinguish b etween serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_14540]  16.1.1 . 
An AE of severe intensity need not nece ssarily be considered s erious. For example, 
nausea that persists for several hours may be considere d severe nausea, but not a n SAE.  
On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disability may be 
considered a mild stroke but would be a n SAE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Abnormal Labor atory Values/Vital Signs  
Laboratory/vital sign  abnormalities should be reported as AEs if any one of the following 
criteria is met:  
• Any criterion for an SAE is fulfilled  
• The laboratory/vital signs abnormality causes the subject  to discontinue from the 
study treatment  
• The laboratory/vital signs abnormality causes the subject  to interrupt the study 
treatment  
• The laboratory/vital signs abnormality causes the subject  to modify the dose of 
study treatment  
• The investigator believes th at the abnormality should be reported as an AE  
• If an abnormal laboratory value or vital sign is associated with clinical signs and 
symptoms, the sign or symptom should be reported as an AE and the associated 
laboratory result or vital sign should be consid ered additional information that 
must be c ollected on the relevant eCRF  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Deaths  
Should a death occur within the study period or within [ADDRESS_1147389] 
administration of study drug  an AE form and an SAE form should be completed, 
detailing the AE that resulted in the death ( death is an outcome, not an event).  The SAE 
must be reported to the  Medical Monitor within 24  hours. The report should 
contain a comment regarding the co -involvement of progression of disease, if 
appropriate, and should assign m ain and contributory causes of death.

OV101 -15-001 (OV101 ) 
Protocol Version 4    Page 61 of 83 [IP_ADDRESS]  Relationship to Study T reatment  
The investigator will assess the causality/relationship between the study drug and the AE 
and record that assessment in the eCRF. The investigator should use medical judgment  to 
determine whether there is a “reasonable causal relationship”, including all relevant 
factors such as temporal course and latency, results from de -challenge or re -challenge, 
pattern of the reaction, known pharmacological properties of the produc t, and alternative 
explanations, such as other drugs, medical history, and concomitant diseases . 
The expression “reasonable causal relationship” means to convey in general that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. Assessment will be 
documented on the AE and SAE form.  
The relationship should be assessed according t o the following criteria:  
• No Reasonable Possibility: The relationship of the clinical event to the study drug 
makes a causal relationship unlikely, or other drugs, therapeutic interventions or 
underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
• None (intercurrent event): An event that is not and cannot be related to the 
study drug, such as subject  is a passe nger in a road traffic accident  
• Unlikely (remote): Relationship is not likely, such as a clinical event 
including laboratory test abnormality with temporal relationship to drug 
administration which makes a causal relationship improbable and in which 
other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease provide plausible 
explanations  
• Reasonable Possibility: The relationship of the clinica l event to the study drug 
makes a causal relationship possible, and other drugs, therapeutic interventions, or 
underlying conditions do not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed 
event.  
• Possible: Relationship may exist, but event could have been  produced by 
[CONTACT_423] ’s condit ion or treatment or other cause  
• Probable: Relationship is likely, the AE abates upon discontinuation of 
study drug and cannot be due to the subject ’s condi tion 
• Definite: Strong relationship, the event abates upon discontinu ation of 
study drug and, if applicable, re-appears upon repeat exposure  
For the purposes of AE and SAE assessment, the causality criteria of Possible, Probable , 
and Definite are considered to represent a “r easonable causal relationship”. Conversely, 
the ca usality criteria of None or Unlikely are not considered to meet this threshold.  
For an AE to be a suspected study drug-related event  there should be at least a reasonable 
possibility of a causal relationship between the study drug and the AE.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting o f Serious Adverse E vents  
Investigators and other study center staff must inform appropriate  representatives 
of any SAE that occurs  (whether or not attributable to the study drug)  in the study  within

16.1.3  Pregnancy  
Females  of child -bearing  potential (not surgically sterile) will undergo serum beta-human 
chorionic gonadotrophin (ß -hCG) pregnancy test at the times shown in Table  1. Any 
female subject  with a positive pregnancy test result at Screening  or Baseline  must be 
excluded from the study. A ser um ß -hCG pregnancy test must be performed if any 
woman is suspected of becoming pregnant during the study.  
If pregnancy occur s, study drug must be discontinued immediately. Pregnancy itself is 
not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_827028] y drug may have interfered 
with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. However, the outcome of all 
pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or congenital 
abnormality) must be followed up and documented even after t he subject  has been 
withdrawn from the study.  
All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs. Spontaneous miscarriages 
should also be reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abortions without complications 
should not be handled as AEs. All o utcomes of pregnancy must be reported to Ovid 
Therapeutics Inc.  on a pregnancy outcomes report form.

Protocol Version 4    Page 65 of 83 17. STATISTICAL EVALUATION  
17.1 Sample Size and Power  
Sample size cal culations for this study are based on the objective of estimating AE rates 
within each active treatment group. The sample size of 25  subjects per group provides 
sufficient precision for estimation of incidence of common AEs. For example, a 2 -sided 
95% conf idence interval (CI) for a true incidence of 25% will estimate that incidence 
with a 17% precision (half -width of the 95% CI).  
While the expected enrol lment  is 25 subjects per treatment group, if enrol lment  
expectations are not realized, the sample size ma y be as low as 20 subjects per group.  A 
sample size of 20 subjects per group provides sufficient precision for estimation of 
incidence of common AEs.  For example, a 2 -sided 95% CI for the true incidence of 25% 
will estimate that inc idence with 19% precis ion. 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
17.2 Statistical Methods  
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses  of the data collected in this 
study will be documented in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), whic h will be 
maintained by  [CONTACT_827047]; however, any major modifications of the endpoint definition and/or its 
analysis will also be reflected in a protocol amendment. Adverse events and e fficac y 
variables may be further described by [CONTACT_827048] , such as age group,  and 
details of this analysis will be provided in the SAP. Additional unplanned analyses  may 
be required after all planned analyses  have been completed. Any unplanned analyses  will 
be clearly identified in the SAP.  
17.2.1  General Considerations  
All statistical analyses will be performed using Version 9.4 of Statistical Analysis 
Software (SAS®). 
Data summaries will use descriptive statistics (number of subjects [n], mean, standard 
devia tion [SD], Q1, median, Q3, minimum, and maximum) for continuous variables, and 
frequency and percentage for categorical and ordinal variables . If there are missing

17.2.4  Methods of Statistical Analyses  
The SS and FAS will be used for safety and efficacy data a nalysis , respectively. Subjects 
in the FAS will be analyzed according to their randomized treatment arm.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Analysis  
All AEs will be coded using MedDRA  Dictionary Version 19.1  and will be classified by 
[CONTACT_11189] ( SOC ) and preferred term ( PT). 
The number and percentage  of subjects who experience at least one TEAE and the 
number and percentage of subjects who experience at least one TEAE within each 
specific SOC and PT will be presented by [CONTACT_1570]. The 95% CIs will be 
displayed for the frequency of TEAEs.  Treatme nt-related AEs will be considered those at 
least possibly related to investigational product based on the investigator’s assessment . 
The number and percentage of subjects r eporting serious AEs, treatment -related AEs, and 
AEs leading to treatment discontinu ation will also be summarized for each treatment 
group by [CONTACT_55366].  
Descriptive statistics for laboratory values and vital signs at each time point will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. Clinically significant laboratory values may be tabulated 
by [CONTACT_1570].  
Shift tables for laboratory parameters will be presented to sho w the change of normality 
from B aseline to each post baseline visit. For each continuous laboratory parameter, 
results will be categorized as low, normal, or high based on the  laboratory normal ranges. 
Frequencies and percentages will be presented by [CONTACT_827049] (i.e., low to normal, low to high, high to low, e tc.) from baseline to each 
post-treatment assessment time point .  
Tables and graph ical disp lays (such as scatter plots of baseline  versus worst post -baseline 
values) of key safety parameters may be generated to better understand the study drug 
safety profile.  
Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug  
Dictionary. A table summarizing concomitant medications and by -subject listing of 
concomitant medications will include all medications taken during the study regardless of 
the timing for the start of the medication.

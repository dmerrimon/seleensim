Indication:
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] ; adjunctive therapy  in patients with partial seizures.
Rationale:
This study  is being performed as a Phase IV commitment to assess visual fields in subjects 
taking pregabalin as compared to placebo when added to their existing antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_392763] y.
Objectives: 
To evaluate visual fields in subjects with partial epi[INVESTIGATOR_392764] 12 w eeks treatment of 
pregabalin compared to placebo.
Trial Design:
This is a Phase IV, multicenter, randomized placebo -controlled trial to further characterize 
visual fields in subjects with partial epi[INVESTIGATOR_30989] y dosed for 13 weeks, including a 1 week up
titrati on and 1 week down titration from the target dose of pregabalin 300 mg/day  versus 
placebo.  Comprehensive ophthalmologic testing will be done at pre-treatment baseline to 
exclude those with pre- existing ey e disease.

Page 7Endpoints:
The primary  endpoint is the proportion of subjects with a decrease in the threshold value 
from baseline to termination in fiveor more points (in either ey e) at the p<.05 level repeated 
in the same five points on subsequent compute rized automated perimetry  testing 
(Humphrey 24-2SITA standard).
Trial Treatments:
Subjects will receive oral pregabalin 75mgtwice daily  (BID) (150 mg/day) or matching 
placebo for titration and taper.  Subjects will receive oral pregabalin 150 mg BID 
(300 mg/day ) or matching placebo for the treatment phase .
Statistical Methods:
The primary  endpoint will be anal yzed using a non -inferiorit y analysis.  The difference in 
proportions between pregabalin and placebo in the per protocol population will be compared 
using a 2 -sided 95% confidence interval (CI).  Non -inferiority will be demonstrated if the 
upper CI bound is less than 0.10 (10%).  The proposed sa mple size will have >90% power to 
detect non -inferiorit y on the primary  endpoint, assuming a proportion of 1% for each group.

Page 131.INTRODUCTION
1.1.Background
Pregabalin (Lyrica) has been approved in over 130countries to date for vary ing neuropathic 
pain indications and for adjunctive treatment of patients with partial seizures and for 
generalized anxiety  disorder .  Lyrica isapproved in the [LOCATION_002] for management of 
neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropath y or postherpetic neuralgia ,for 
the adjunctive treatment of adult patients with partial onset seizures, and for management of 
fibromy algia.[ADDRESS_492957] accumulated worldwide.  More detailed information, 
including efficacy  resu lts in adults and the possible risks associated with administration of 
pregabalin, can be found in the current Investigator Brochure (IB).
Prospec tively  planned ophthalmologic assessments, including visual acuit y testing, formal 
visual field testing and di lated funduscopic examination, were performed in the pregabalin 
clinical development program for all of the initial indications.
Formal visual fie ld testing was conducted in over 2400 patients treated with pregabalin for 
neuropathic pain, chronic pain sy ndromes, intractable epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] , or generalized anxiety  
disorder in randomized controlled clinical trials of up to 3 months in duration and in o ver 
3600patients in open -label trials of up to 4 years in duration.  Ophthalmologic assessments 
were included in th e program due to concerns expressed at the time on emerging reports of 
visual field disturbances with the anticonvulsant vigabatrin, a gamma -aminobuty ric acid 
(GABA) -transaminase inhibitor.3-11  The mechanism of the visual field defects with 
vigabatrin is unknown but was considered as possibly  related to its GA BA mechanism.  As a 
structural derivative of GABA, regulatory  agencies considered similarity  of pregaba lin to 
vigabatrin as possible.  Subsequently , it became clearer that the mechanism of action of 
pregabalin was not related to GABA -transaminase inhibitio n or to a GABA related 
mechanism.  While the mechanism of action of pregabalin is not completely  unders tood, 
results in animal models indicate that binding to the alpha-2-delta subunit of voltage- gated 
calcium channels may  be involved in the activity  of pr egabalin.
In controlled pregabalin studies, a higher proportion of patients treated with pregabalin 
reported blurred vision (6%) than did patients treated with placebo (2%), which resolved in 
the majority  of patients during treatment.  In patients assessed with prospectively  planned 
ophthalmologic testing, visual acuity  was reduced in 7% of patients treated with p regabalin, 
and 5% of placebo-treated patients.  Visual field changes were detected in 13% of 
pregabalin- treated, and 12% of placebo- treated patien ts.  Funduscopic changes were 
observed in 2% of pregabalin- treated and 2% of placebo -treated patients.
This st udy is a Post -Authorization Safety  Studies (PASS).  I t is being conducted as a 
commitment agreed upon with the [LOCATION_002] Federal Drug Administ ration (FDA) 
regulatory  agency .

Protocol Amendment 5, [ADDRESS_492958].  Threshold visual fields will be 
performed using computerized static perimetry .
Complete information for this compound may  be found in the S ingle Reference Safet y 
Document (SRSD), which for this study  is the pregabalin Investigator ’s Brochure (IB).  The 
SRSD will be used in determining expected versus unexpected adverse events.
2.TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS
2.1.Objective
To evaluate visual fields in subjects with partial epi[INVESTIGATOR_392764] 12 weeks treatment of 
pregabalin compared to placebo.
2.2.Endpoints
Primary  endpoint: 
The proportion of subjects with a decrease in the threshold v alue from baseline to 
termination infive or more points (in eithe r eye) at the p<.05 level repeated in the 
same five points on subsequent computerized automated perimetry  testing 
(Humphrey  24-[ADDRESS_492959]).
Secondary endpoints:
Change in mean deviation score from baseline to Week12 from the Humphrey  
threshold test ;
Change in visual acuit y from Baseline to Week 12 expressed by  [CONTACT_392795].
3. TRIAL DESIGN
This is a Phase IV, multicenter, double -blind, randomized , placebo -controlled trial to 
measure visual field sensitivity  in subjects with partial epi[INVESTIGATOR_392766].  Pregabalin will be dosed at 300 mg/day for 11 weeks after one -week initiation with 
150mg/day , followed b y one -week tapering of 150 mg/day .  Total treatment period will be 
13weeks.  Comprehensive ophthalmologic testing will be done at pre -treatment baseline to 
exclude subjects with pre -existing ey e dise ase.  
A central reader will assure the qualit y of all visual field test results with pre-specified 
criteria.  An y field failing this quality  assu rance criteria either due to poor subject compliance 
or due to failure to follow testing procedures will be re peated as soon as possible within 
2weeks following notification from the central reader .  Prior to randomization subjects must

It is re commended that the first dose of preg abalin be taken in the evening .
On the day  of the ophthalmic testing it is recommended that the visual field test be performed 
in the morning (or when the subje ct is most alert). It is also recommended that the subject 
withholds the morning dose of investigational product until the ophthalmic tests are 
completed to reduce any potential effects of CNS events that ma y occur (eg , somnolence) 
with pregabalin which m ay interfer ewith testing. If the subject has taken the morning stud y 
dose of medication, testing should be performed when the subject is least probably  affected 
by [CONTACT_392798] o ccur to ensure the subject is optimally  alert during the
test.
For t he purposes of this study , and per International Conference on Harmonization ( ICH)
guidelines investigational product is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active ingredient 
or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a clinical trial ,including a product with a 
marketing authorization when used or assembled (formulated or packaged) in a way  different 
from the approved form, or when used for an unapproved indication, or when used to gain 
further information about an approved use (ICH E 61.33).

Baseline (Visit 2), Week 1 (Visit 4), Week 6 (Visit 5), Week 12 (Visit 6) and Earl y 
Termination (ET) . BP will be measured with the subject’s arm supported at the level of the 
heart, and recorded to the nearest mm Hg.  The same arm (preferabl y the dominant ar m) will 
be used throughout the trial. BP and heart rate will be measured after at least 5 minutes in 
sitting p osition.  When done manuall y, heart rate will be measured in the brachial/radial 
artery  for at least 30 seconds.  The use of automated devices fo r measuring BP and heart rate 
are also acceptable.   Any clinically significant neg ative changes (increase or de crease) in 
vital sign sfrom the entry examination should be recorded as an adverse event and/or based 
on the clinical judgment of the PI .
Body we ight will be collected at Scre ening (Visit 1), Baseline (Visit 2), Week 1 (Visit 4), 
Week 6 (Visit 5), Week 12 (Visit 6), Week 15 (Visit 7) and Earl y Termination (ET) . Any 
clinically  significant negative changes (increase or decrease) from the entry  exami nation 
should be recorded as an adverse event for weight and/or based on the clinical judgment of 
the PI .  
To reduce measurement variability  of bod y weight, subjects should be weighed on the same 
scale at each visit that body  weight is assessed; should not carry  extraneous items such as
purses, blackberries, and cell phones onto the scale; should remove their coat s and shoes 
before being weighed, and should empty  their pockets of an y heav y items .
A phy sical exam will be performed at Screening (V1) and Week 12 (Visit 6).Items included
will be:
General appearance –including height (at Screening onl y);
Skin –Examination for the presence of rash;
HEENT –Examination of extraocular movements, pupi[INVESTIGATOR_36518], determination 
of ny stagmus, and visual field e xamination by  [CONTACT_55908];
Lungs and Cardiovascular –Auscultation of lung field s, determination of BP, cardiac

event and/or based on the clinical judgment of the PI .
7.4.Electrocardiogram (ECG)
A 12 -lead ECG (singlet) will be performed at Sc reening (Visit 1).  ECG should b e performed 
after the subject has rested quietly  for at least 10 minutes i n a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].  ECG tracing 
will be evaluated b y the investigator in a real time for the safet y monitoring of the subjects.  
In some cases, it m ay be appropriate to repeat abno rmal ECGs to rule out improper lead 
placement as c ontributing to the ECG a bnormality .  It is important that leads are placed in the 
same positions each time in order to achieve precise ECG recordings.
7.5.Assessment of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior
Three tools are being used to assess for suicidal ideation and behavior during the study ;the 
Sheehan -Suicidality  Tracking Scale (S -STS) ,the Columbia -Suicidality  Severity  Rating Scale 
(C-SSRS) and the Suicidal Behaviors Questionnair e –Revised (SBQ -R). Subjects
randomized prior to Amendment 4 will only complete the S-STS.
7.5.1. Sheehan -Suicidality Tracking Scale ( S-STS)
The Sheehan -Suicidality  Tracking Scale (S -STS) is an 8-item prospective rating scale that 
tracks treatment- emergent sui cidal ideation and behaviors. This scale was adapted from the 
Suicidality  Module o f the Mini I nternational Neuropsy chiatric Interview (MI NI) Structured 
Diagnostic Interview for DSM -IV.  Items 1a, 2-6, 7a, and 8 are scored on a 5- point L ikert 
scale (ranging from 0= not at all to 4=extr emely).  Items 1, 1b, and 7 require y es or no 
respons es.  T his scale can be administered either by  a clinician (ie,MD or a PhD level 
clinical P sychologist) or patient through self -report.  The baseline Lifetime Assessment will 
be completed at Screening an d the “Since Last Visit” version will be completed a t Base line
(Visit 2) , Randomization (Visit 3), Week 1 (Visit 4), Week 6 (Visit 5), Week 12 (Visit 6), 
Week 15 (Visit 7) and ET. 
Subjects randomized prior to Amendment 4 will complete the S -STS and not the C-SSRS or 
SBQ -R. Subjects enrolled/randomized a fter i mplementation of Amend ment 4 will not 
complete the S -STS but will instead complete the C -SSRS and SBQ -R.
7.5.2. Columbia-Suicidality Severity Rating Scale (C- SSRS)
The Columbi a-Suicidalit y Severity  Rating Sc ale (C- SSRS ) is a semi -structured interview 
developed in the National I nstitute of Mental Health Treatment of Adolescent Suicide 
Attempters Study  to assess severity and track suicidal events through any  treatment.14The 
C-SSRS is being used in the current study to provide a summary  measure of suicidal risks. 
This scale is to be completed by  a trained clinician. Training materials on the scale will be 
provided to investigator site s by [CONTACT_4618]. The Lifetime version is completed during the first 
visit and the Since Last Visit version will be completed at subsequent visits.

Page 357.5.3. Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire – Revised (SBQ -R)
The SBQ -R is a 4- item; self -report questionnaire that assesses behaviors a ssociated with 
suici dality .  The SBQ -R will be completed at Screening (V1) following implementation of 
Amendment 4. Subjects screened under Amendment 3 but continue under Amendment 4 
should complete the SBQ -R at the baseline or randomization v isit.
7.5.4. Patient Health Questionnai re-8 (PHQ) 
The PHQ -8is a self -administered versi on of the PRI ME-MD diagnostic instrument for 
common mental disorders.  The PHQ- 9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 
DSM -IV criteria as 0 (no t at all) to 3 ( nearl y every day ).[ADDRESS_492985] 8 items of the measure, will be complete d by [CONTACT_392803] (Visit 1). 
The s core is the sum of items 1-8. A total score  15 indicates signific ant depression and 
requires mental health risk ass essment .16
When scoring the PHQ -8,if more than one response is given on an item and two consecutive 
numbers are checked, score the higher (more distress) number; however, if the numbers are 
not consecutive, do not score the item. If more than 1 item is missing, the PHQ-8 should be 
reported as Not Done .
7.5.5. Assessment of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior During Screening
The Investigator will review the results of th eSTS (L ifetime) , C-SSRS ( Lifetime ), SBQ- R, 
PHQ -8 and medical history .  The following criteria would indicate a potential risk:
Positive subject’s responses (score 1) on any of theseS-STS questions :
1a (T o what extent did y ou plan or intend to hurt yours elf?), 
1b(Did you intend to die as a result of this accident?) , 
both 3 and4(How seriously  did y ou ever want to harm y ourself or to hurt or to 
injure y ourself? and Did y ou think about suicide?) , 
5(How seriousl y did you ever plan for a suicide?) , 
6 (How seriousl y did you ever take active steps to pre pare for a suicide attempt i n 
which y ou expected or intended to die?) ,  
8(How seriousl y did you ever attempt suicide?) .
Suicidal ideation associated with actual intent and/ or method and/or plan in the pas t 
year based on C -SSRS assessment (ie, ‘y es’ respo nse to C -SSRS items 4 (Activ e 
suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan) or 5(Active suicidal 
ideation with specific plan and intent) ).

10years.
Forevents that occurred within the past 10 years, an answer of “y es” to any  of the 
suicidal behavior items of the C- SSRS .
SBQ -R total score  8. 
Clinically  significant depressi on: PHQ -8 total score  15.
The presence of an y current major psychiatric disorder that is not explicitly  permitted 
in the inclusion/exclusion criteria.
In the investigator’s judgment a risk assessment or exclusion is required.
If any of these criteria are met and the subject is being considered for stud y participation, a 
risk assessment must be com pleted to determine whether it is appropriate for the subject to be 
enrolled. 
Risk assessments should be done b y a qualified mental health professional (MHP).  A
qualified MHP is a clinically -qualified MHP with appropriate training in the asse ssment of 
suicide risk, according to local clinical practice standards and regulations, who would 
normally  evaluate the risk for suicidal ideation or behavior in a patient. In the [LOCATION_002] , 
in additi onto psy chiatrists (board certified or board eligib le), clinica lly qualified MHPs 
include the following: (1) Psy .D. or Ph.D. level Clinical Psy chologists, (2) licensed Master’s 
level Clinical Social Workers (LCSW), or (3) lic ensed Psy chiatric Nurse Practi tioners (PNP), 
who have specific training and experi ence in the assessment and management of acutel y 
suicidal patients.
The MHP may  be a member of study  site team.  If an MHP is not available within the study  
team, the Investi gator should make the necessar y referral.
The Investigator must obtain and review the risk assessment prior to the subject continuing in 
the study .  A written copy  of the risk assessment should be included in the subject’s clinical 
record (source documenta tion).
7.5.6. Assessment of Suicidal Behavior and Ideation During the Clinical Trial

8.ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING
8.1.Adverse Events
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal 
relationship to the investigational product(s) wi ll be reported as described in the following 
sections. 
For all AEs, the investiga tor must pursue and obtain information adeq uate both to determine 
the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE 
requiring immediate notification to [COMPANY_007] orits designated representative.  For all AEs, 
sufficient information should be obtained by  [CONTACT_392805] y of the 
AE.  The investigator is required to assess causality .  Follow -up by  [CONTACT_392806] a leve l acceptable to the 
investigator, and [COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.  
As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted b y the Sponsor, an y non -serious adverse event 
that is determined b y the Sponsor to beserious will be reported b y the Sponsor as an SAE .  
To assist in the determination of case seriousness further information ma y be requested from 
the investigator to provide clarit y and understanding of the event in the con text of the clinical 
trial.  
8.2. Re porting Period
For SAEs, the active reporting peri od to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative begins from 
the time that the s ubject provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the subject’s 
participation in the s tudy, ie, prior to undergoing an y stud y-related procedure and/or 
receiving investi gational product, through and including [ADDRESS_492987] after the active 
reporting period has ended should be rep orted to the sponsor if the investigator becomes 
aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the investigator believes have at le ast a 
reasonable possibility  of being related to investigational product are to be reported to the 
sponsor.

subject has taken at least one dose of investigational product through the subject ’slast
visit.
8.3.Definition of an Adverse Event
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrenc e in a clinical investigation s ubject administered a 
product or medical device; th e event need not necessarily  have a causal relationship with the 
treatment or usage.  Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:  
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant symptoms and signs;
Changes in ph ysical examination findings;
Hypersensit ivity;
Progression/worsening of underl ying disease ;
Drug abuse;
Drug depende ncy.
Additionally , they  may  include the signs or s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug wit hdrawal;
Drug misuse; 
Drug int eractions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy (EDP);
Exposure via breastfeeding;
Medication error ;
Occupational exposure .

Such medication errors occurring to a stud y participant a re to be captured on the medication 
error CRF, which is a specific version of the AE page, and on the SAE form when 
appropriate. In the event of medication dosing error, the spon sor should be notified 
immediately .
Medication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, 
including:
Medication errors involving subject expo sure to the investigational pro duct;
Potential medication errors or uses outside o f what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not invol ve the participating subject.
Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by  [CONTACT_1149], as determined by  [CONTACT_1275], the medication error is captured on the medication error version of the AE page 
and, if applicable, an y associated AE(s) are captu red on an AE CRF page.
8.5.Abnormal Test Findings
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test find ing should be reported as 
an AE are as follows: 
Test result is associated with ac compan ying symptoms, and/or
Test result requires additiona l diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, 
and/or
Test result leads to a change in stud y dosing or discontinuation from the study , 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or o ther therap y, and/or
Test result is considered to be an AE by [CONTACT_4687].
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, d oes not 
constitute an AE.  An y abnormal test result that is determined to be an er ror does not require 
reporting as an AE.
8.6.Serious Adverse E vents
An SAE is any  untoward medical occurrence at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate r isk of death);
Requires inpatie nt hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153830];
Pregabalin

Page 40Results in persistent or significant disabili ty/incapacity  (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions);
Results in congenital anomal y/birth defect ;
Lack of efficac yshould be reported as an AE when it is associated with an SAE.
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result i n death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is dete rmined that the event may  jeopardize 
the subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the 
important medical event should be reported as seriou s.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsion s that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
8.6.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events 
There are no p rotocol -specified SAEs in this study .  All SAEs wil l be reported by  [CONTACT_4688], and will be handled as SAEs in the safet y 
database (see the section on Se rious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements ).
8.6.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Inju ry 
Abnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
levels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet th e criteria 
outlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury  are consi dered potential cases of 
drug-induced liver injury (potential Hy ’s Law cases) and should alway s be co nsidered 
important medical events.  
The threshold of laboratory  abnormal ities for a potential case of dr ug-induced liver injury  
depends on the subject ’s individual baseline values and underl ying conditions. Subjects who 
present with the following laborato ry abnormalities should be evaluated further to 
definitively  determine th e etiology  of the abnormal lab oratory  values:
Subjects with AST or ALT and total bilirubin baseline values within the normal range 
who subsequently  present with AST or AL Tvalues3 times the upper limit of 
normal (X ULN) concurrent with a total bilirubin value[ADDRESS_492989] with no evidenc e 
of hemoly sis and an alkaline phosphatase value2X ULN or not available.
For subjects with preexisting ALT OR AST ORtotal bilirubin values above the 
upper limit of normal, the following threshold values should be used in t he definition
mentioned above:

Concurrent with
For subjects with pre -existing values of total bilirubin above the normal range: 
Total bilirubin level increased from b aseline b y an amount of at least 1 × ULN or
if the value reaches 3× ULN (whichever is smaller) .
The subject should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as so on as possible, 
preferabl y wit hin48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results.   This evaluation should 
include laboratory  tests, detailed history and ph ysical assessment .  In addition to repeating 
measurement s ofAST and ALT, laboratory  tests should include albumin, creatine kinase , 
total bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubin, ga mma -glutam yl transferase, prothrombin time 
(PT)/INR, and alkaline phosphatase.  A detailed history , including relevant information, such 
as review of ethanol, acetaminophen , recreational drug and suppleme ntconsumption, family  
history , occupational exposur e, sexual history , travel history , history  of contact [CONTACT_4490] a 
jaundiced subject, surgery , blood transfusion, history  of liver or allergic disease, and work 
exposure, should be collected.  Further testing f oracute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and 
liver im aging (eg,biliary tract) may  be warranted. All cases confirmed on repeat testing as 
meeting the laboratory  criteria defined above , with no other cause for LFT abnormalities
identified at the time should b e considered potential Hy ’s Law cases irrespective of 
availability  of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology  of the 
abnormal LFTs. Such potential Hy ’s Law cases should be reported as SAEs .
8.7.Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_392776] i s defined as an y initial admission (even less than 2 4 hours) in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8843].  Admission also 
includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/inten sive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric 
wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary  care unit, or neurological floor to a 
tuberculosis unit).  An emergency  room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
however, the event leading t o the emergency  room visit sho uld be assessed for medical 
importance.

Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_392778] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], clinical 
AE is not in itself an SAE.  Examples include: 
Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not as sociated with the 
development ofa new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting c ondition (eg, for 
work -up of persistent pre- treatment lab abnormality);
Social admission (eg, subject has no place to sleep);
Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical exam ination );
Protocol -speci fied admission during a stud y (eg, for a procedure r equired by  [CONTACT_8896]);
Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] (eg, for elective 
cosmetic surgery );
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_392779] t a medical AE;
Pre-planned tr eatments or surgical procedures.  These should be no ted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject.
Diagnostic and therapeutic non -invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery ,should not 
be reported as AEs . However, the medical condition for w hich the proc edure was performed 
should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an acute appendicitis 
that begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting 
appendectomy  should be recorded as treat ment of the A E.
8.8.Severity Assessment
If required on the AE case report forms (CRFs), the investigator will use the adjectives 
MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity  ofthe AE.  For 
purposes of cons istency , these intensity  grades are def ined as follo ws:
MILD Does not interfere with subject's usual function.
MODERATE Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function.
SEVERE Interferes significantl y with subject's usual function.
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily  an SAE.  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes significantly  with 
subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one ofthe 
criteria for SAEs, listed a bove.

Page 438.9.Causality As sessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and non -
serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, a s appropriate, and 
report such an assessment in accordance with the serious advers e reporting requirements if 
applicable.  An investigator’s causality  assessment is the determination of whether there 
exists a reasonable possibility  that the investigational product caused or contributed to an 
AE; generally  the facts (ev idence) or argumen ts to suggest a causal relationship should be 
provided.  If the investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused 
the event, then the event will be handled as “related to invest igational product” for reporting 
purposes, as define d by [CONTACT_1034] (see Section on Reporting Requirements ).  If the
investigator's causality assessment is "unknown but not related to investigational product", 
this should be clea rly documented on study records.  
In addition, if t he investigator determines an SAE is associated with study  procedures, the 
investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment inaccordance with the SAE reporting 
requirements, i f applicable.
8.10. Exposure During Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during 
pregnancy  occurs if:
1.A female becomes, or is fou nd to be, pregnant either whil e receiving or having been 
exposed (eg, because of t reatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational 
product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or 
being exposed to the investiga tional product; 
An example of e nvironmental exposure would be a case involving di rect contact [CONTACT_4490] 
a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has 
been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
2.A male has been exposed ( eg, because of treatment or en vironmental exposure) to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed 
during his partner’s pregnancy . 
If a stud y subject or study subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
study  subject’s tr eatment with the investigational product, the invest igator must submit this 
information to the [COMPANY_007] drug safet y unit on an SAE report form and an EDP supplemental 
form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred .  In addition , the investigator must submit
information regarding environmental exposure to a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a 
subject reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product by  [CONTACT_8897][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) using the EDP supplementa l form.  This must be done irr espective of whether an 
AE has occurred and within 2 4hours of awareness of the exposure.  The information 
submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see below for information related 
to terminatio n of pregnanc y).

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 44Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  [COMPANY_007] of the ou tcome as a follow-up 
to the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity  of the 
neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for 
termination shou ld be specified and, if clinicall y possible, the struct ural integrit y of the 
terminated fetus should be a ssessed b y gross visual inspection (unless preprocedure test 
findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrau terine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live-born bab y, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death] ), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnan cy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;
Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_492992]. 
Additional inform ation regarding the EDP may  berequested by  [CONTACT_093].  Further 
follow -up o f birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on 
preterm infants to identify developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal exposure, the 
investiga tor will provide the study  subje ct with the Pregnant Partner Release of Informatio n 
Form to deliver to his partner.  The investigator must document in the source documents that 
the subject was given the Pregnant Partner Release of In formation Form to provi de to his 
partner.
8.11. Occupationa l Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when, dur ing the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898], which m ay or may  not lead to t he occurrence of an AE.
An occ upational exposure is reported to the drug safet y unit within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s awareness, using the SAE report form, regardless of whether there is an 
associated AE/SAE.  Since the informat ion does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the stu dy, 
the information is not reported on a CRF; howeve r, a cop y of the completed SAE report form 
is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.12. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See Also Section 6.[ADDRESS_492993] Withdrawal )
Withdra wal due to AE should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes , 
according to the definition of AE noted earlier, and recorded on the appropriate AE CRF 
page.

Protocol Amendment 5, [ADDRESS_492994] be made 
immediately , irrespe ctive of the extent of available AE information.  This timeframe also 
applies to additional new information (follow- up) on previously  forwarded SAE reports as 
well as to the initial and follow- up reporting of exposure during p regnancy ,exposure via 
breast feeding, and occupational exposure cases.  
In the ra re event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE 
immediately  (eg, if an outpatient study  subject initially  seeks treatment elsewhere), the 
investigator is to report the eve ntwithin 24 hours after learning of it and document the time 
of his/her first awareness of the AE.
For all SAEs, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to [COMPANY_007] in 
accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above.  In addition, an investigator 
may be requested by  [CONTACT_161699] r to obtain specific additional follow- up information in an 
expedited fashion.  This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured 
on the AE CRF.  In gen eral, this will include a desc ription of the AE in sufficient detail to 
allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of 
possible causality .  Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant 
medicat ions, vaccines and/orillnesse s must be provided.  I n the case of a subject death, a 
summary of available autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible to [COMPANY_007] or its 
designated representative. 
8.14.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
All AEs will be reported on the AE page(s) of the CRF.  It should be noted that the form for 
collection of SAE information is not the same as the AE CRF.  Where the same data are 
collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, t he same AE 
term should be used on both forms.  AEs should be reported using concis e medical 
terminology  on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAE information.

9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS
9.1.Sample Size Determination
The study  will be powered to show non -inferiorit y of pregabalin with respect to placebo on 
the mean deviation score from the Humphrey  threshold test, a secondary  endpoint.
Non-inferiorit y from placebo will be declared with respect to mean deviation if the lower 
bound of the 95% 2-sided confidence interval of the difference in mean deviation scores 
betw een pregabalin and placebo is greater than - 2.0decibels (dB). Assuming the mean 
deviation scores to be equal and assuming estimated common standard deviation of 1.3 dB, 
then the proposed sample size of 187 subjects will provide greater than 85% power to show 
non-inferiorit y of pregabalin to placebo. 
The estimated common standard deviation of 1.3 dB, from the 15 March 2019 dataset 
prepared for the annual Internal Review Committee (IRC) blinded review (refer to 
Section 9.6 ), was used to re -estima te the sample size for the secondary  endpoints. Previously ,

9.4.1. Analysis of Primary Endpoint
Definit ion: The primary  endpoint is the proportion of subjects with a decrease in the 
threshold value from baseline to terminati on infiveor more points (in either ey e) at 
the p<.05 level repeated in the same f ive points on subsequent computerized 
automated peri metry  testing (Humphrey  24-[ADDRESS_492997]).
Baseline : Baseline is determined from the last VFTs prior to receiving inves tigational 
product .  A point will be considered abnormal at baseline only  if it was abnormal 
(<0.05) at both baseline tests.
Termination: Termination is the VFT done at Week 12 (including a repeat test if 
applicable).  For subjects who did not complete the study , the last available test(s) 
after Day [ADDRESS_492998] an y 
VFTs after base line; rather, such subjects will be treated as missing values.
Comparison : The difference in proportions between pregabali n and placebo will be 
compared using a 2 -sided 95% confidence interval (CI). Non-inferiorit y will be 
demonstrated if the upper CI  bound is less than 0.10 (10%).
Populations: The intent -to-treat (ITT) population is defined as all subjects 
randomized to tr eatment who received at least one dose of investigational product.  
The Per Protocol population is a subset of the ITT population, and excludes subjects 
who had a decrease in at least [ADDRESS_492999].  The Per P rotocol population may  also exclude subjects with major protocol 
violations; the li stof subjects excluded will be determined prior to breaking the blind.  
The primary  anal ysis will be performed on the Per Protocol population , the 
expectation is that the P er Protocol subset will be close in the number of subjects to 
the number of subject s randomized .  A supplementary anal ysis of the prima ry 
parameter will be perfor med using the ITT population .
9.4.2. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
9.4.3. Mean Deviation
Change in mean de viation from baseline to termination will be computed for each subject.  
Baseline m ean deviation will be the average of the two mean de viations from the Baseline 
visit, and termination mean deviation will be the mean deviation at the Week 12 visit (or the 
last available after Day 1 for subjects who terminate earl y).  If a repeat test was done at 
termination, the mean deviation from the re peat test will be used.  For each subject, the worst 
eye (ie, the ey e with the greatest decrease in mean deviation) will be used in the anal ysis.  
Change in mean deviation will be anal yzed for the I TT pop ulation using analy sis of 
covariance (ANCOVA), with treatment and center in the model and the baseline mean
deviation as the covariate.  L east squares means will be obtained from the model and a

Page 482-sided 95% confidence interval will be constructed on the di fference in least squares means 
between pregabalin and placebo.  Non -inferiorit y with respect to mean devia tion will be 
demonstrated if the lower bound of the CI is greater than –2.0 dB.
9.4.4. Visual Acuity
Visual acuity  (best -corrected, measured using ETDRS cha rts) is expressed in terms of 
number of letters corr ectly  identified.  Change in visual acuity  from baselin e to termination 
will be computed for each subject.  Baseline will be defined as the last visual acuit y 
assessment prior to receiving investigational product , and termination will be the visual 
acuity  assessment at the Week 12 visit (or the last available after Day 1 for subjects who 
terminate early ).  If acuity  was asse ssed at a repeat visit at termination, the acuity  from the 
repeat test will be used . Foreach subject, the worst ey e (ie, the ey e with the greatest 
decrease in visual acuity ) will be used i n the anal ysis.  Change in visual acuity  will be 
analyzed for the ITT population using ANCOVA, with treatment and center in the model and 
the baseline acuity  as the covariate.
9.4.5. Other Safety Measurements
Other safety  parameters, including adverse events, phy sical examination results, vital signs, 
body  weight, clinical labo ratory  results, and subject assessment of seizure frequency  as 
compared to before t aking investigational product , and C-SSRS/ S-STS, will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_1570], but not analy zed in ferentiall y.

9.6.Data Monitoring Committee
This study  will use an Internal Review Committee (I RC).  
The I RC will be responsible f orongoing monitoring of safet y of subjects in the s tudy 
according to the Charter.  The recommendations made b y the IRC to alter the conduct of the 
study  will be forwarded to the clinical lead or delegate for final decision.  P fizer will forward 
such decis ions, which may  include summaries of aggregate anal yses of endpoint events and

10.QUALITY C ONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
[COMPANY_007] or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring v isits during trial conduct to ensure that 
the protoc ol and Global Clinical Practices are being followed.  The monitors may  review 
source documents to confirm that the data r ecorded on CRFs are accurate.  The investigator 
and institution will allow [COMPANY_007] m onitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate regul atory  
authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.   This verification 
may also occur after study  completion.

The investigator(s) will notify  [COMPANY_007] or its agent s immediately  of any  regulatory  inspection 
notification in relation to the study . Furthermore, the investigator will coop erate with [COMPANY_007] 
or its agents to prepare the study  site for the inspection and wi llallow [COMPANY_007] or its agent, 
whenever feasible, to be present during the inspection. The investigator will promptly  
provide copi[INVESTIGATOR_4599].  Before response submission 
to the regulato ry authorities, the investiga tor will provide [COMPANY_007] or its agents with an 
opport unity  to review and comment on responses to any  such findings.
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspe ctions and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.
11.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term Case Report Form (CRF) should be understood to refer to 
either a paper form or an electr onic data record or both, depending on the data coll ection 
method used in this trial.
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole propert y of [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized represe ntatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from [COMPANY_007].
It is the investigator' s responsibility  to ensure completion and to review and approve all 
CRFs.  CRFs mus t be signed by  [CONTACT_392808].  These 
signatures serve to attest that the information contained on the CRFs is true .  At all times, the 
investigator has final personal responsibility  for the accuracy  and authenticity  of allclinical 
and laboratory  data entered on the CRFs.   Subject source documents are the phy sician's 
subject records maintained at the trial site.  In m ost cases, the source d ocuments will be the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]'s or the ph ysician's chart.  In cases where the sourc e documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_392780]'s chart, the information collected on the CRFs must match those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF may  also serve as the source do cument.  In these cases, [COMPANY_007] and 
the investigator must prospectively  document whic h items will be recorded in the source 
documents a nd for which items the CRF will stand as the source document.

A0081096
Protocol Amendment 5, [ADDRESS_493001] Retention
To enable evaluatio ns and/or audits from r egulatory  authorities or [COMPANY_007], the investigator 
agrees to keep records, including t he identit y of all participating subjects (suffici ent
information to link records, e g, CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed 
consent forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_198303] l CRFs, serious adverse event forms, source documents, and 
detailed records of trea tment disposition.  The records should be retained b y the investigator 
according to ICH, local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study  Agre ement, 
whichever is lon ger.
If the investigator relocates, retires, or for an y reason withdraws from the t rial, [COMPANY_007] should 
be prospectively notified.  The trial records must be transferred to an acceptable designee, 
such as another investigator, another institution, or to Pfi zer.  The investigator must obtain 
[COMPANY_007]'s written permission before disposing of any records, even if retention requirements 
have bee n met.
12.ETHICS
12.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)
It is the respon sibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the trial protocol, 
protocol amendments, info rmed consent forms, and other relevant documents, 
eg,advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/IEC.  All correspondence with the I RB/IEC 
should be retained in the Investi gator File.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] I RB/IEC approvals should be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_007].
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated pr ior to IRB/IEC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards t o the subjects.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/IEC and [COMPANY_007] in writing within [ADDRESS_493002] be agreed to b y [COMPANY_007] and the IRB/ IEC and must be in 
compliance with I CH GCP, local regulatory  requirements, and legal requirements.

How to sit;
How to pause the test;
That more than h alf of the stimuli shown in a threshold test will be too dim to be seen 
and that th e stimuli that are seen are likel y to be barely visi ble.
The perimetrist must be available to monitor the entire test to ensure the subject

Intercede a test
During the test, the perimetrist may  paus e the procedure if he/she detect sobvious artifact(s).  
The test may  be resume d after a 5 –10minute break.  I nvestigators/perimetrist can 
repeat/reschedule sessions for another time when subjects have poor compliance that

Timing of the test
Itis recommended that all the visual field testing be performed in the morning (or when the 
subject is most alert), and it is recommended that the subject withhold sthe morni ng dose of 
the investigational product until the ophthalm ic test sare completed to reduce any  potential

Change From
Pregabalin (Lyrica) has been approved in over 50110countries to date for vary ing 
neuropathic pain indications and for adjunctive treatment of patients with partia l seizures and 
for generalized anxiety disorder .  Lyrica iswas approved in the [LOCATION_002] in 
December 2004 for management of neuropathic pain associated with diabe tic peripheral 
neuropath y or postherpetic neuralgia ,and in June 2005 for the adjunctive treatment of adult 
patients with partial onset seizures, and for management of fibromyalgia.1.  Lyrica iswas
approved in the European Union countries in July 2004 for the treatment of peripheral 
neuropathic pain , and as adjunctive treatment of parti al sei zures with or without secondary  
generalization, and in March 2006 for the treatment of generalized anxiety  disorder.2
Formal visual field testing was conducted in ove r 2400 patients treated with pregabalin for 
neuropathic pain, chronic pain sy ndrome s, int ractable epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] , or generalized anxiety  
disorder in randomized controlled clinical trials of up to 3 months in duration and in over 
3600 patients in open -label trial s of up to 4 years in duration.  Ophthalmologic assessments 
were included in the pr ogram due to concerns expressed at the time on emerging reports of 
visual field disturbances with the anticonvulsant vigabatrin, a gamma -aminobuty ric acid 
(GABA) -transaminase inhibitor.13-9  11  The mechanism of the visual field defects with 
vigabatrin is unknow n but was considered as possibly  related to its GABA mechanism.  As a 
structural derivative of GABA, regulatory  agencies considered similarity  of pregabalin to 
vigabat rin as possible.  Subsequently , it became clearer that the mechanism of action of 
pregaba lin was not related to GABA- transaminase inhibition or to a GABA related 
mechanism.  While the mechanism of action of pregabalin is not completely  understood, 
results in animal models indicate that binding to the alpha-2-delta subunit of voltage- gated 
calcium channels may  be involved in the activity  of pregabalin.

7.3. Vital Sign, Body Weight and Physical Examination
Vital signs (sit ting h eart rate and blood pressure) will be obtained at Screening (Visit 1), 
Baseline (Visit 2), Week 1 (Vis it 4), Week 6 (Visit 5), Week 12 (Visit 6) and Early 
Termination (ET).  BP will be measured with the subject’s arm supp orted at the level of 
the heart, an d recorded to the nearest mm Hg.  The same arm (preferably the dominant 
arm) will be used throughout t he trial. BP and heart rate will be measured after at 
least 5 minutes in sitting position.  When done manually, heart rate will be measured in 
the brachi al/radial artery for at least 30 seconds.  The use of automated devices for 
measuring BP and heart rat e are also acceptable.
Body weight will be collected at Screening (Visit 1), Baseline (Visit 2), Week 1 (Visit 4), 
Week 6 (Visit 5), Week 12 (Visit 6), We ek 15 (Visit 7) and Early Termination (ET).  Any 
negative changes from the screening examination will be recorded as adverse events.
To reduce measurement variability of body weight, subjects should be weighed on the 
same scale at each visit that bod y weig ht is assessed; should not carry extraneous items 
such as purses, blackberries, and cell phones onto t he scale; should remove their coats 
and shoes before being weighed, and should empty their pockets of any heavy items.
A physical exam will be performed a t Screening (V1) and Week 12 (Visit 6). Items 
included will be:
General appearance –including height (at Screening only);
Skin –Examination for the presence of rash;
HEENT – Examination of extraocular movements, pupi[INVESTIGATOR_392788], 
determination of nyst agmus, and visual field examination by [CONTACT_55908];
Lungs and Cardiovascular – Auscultation of lung fields, determination of BP, 
cardiac rhythm and rate auscultation for the presence of murmurs, gallops, or 
rubs;
Neurol ogic – Including mental statu s, station and gait, cranial nerves, motor and 
sensory function, reflexes, and coordination;
Abdominal – Palpation and auscultation performed.
Additional physical assessment will be made as necessary to evaluate symptoms or 
adverse experiences at the discr etion of the investigator.

Page 807.4. Electrocardiogram (ECG)
A 12 -lead ECG (singlet) will be performed at Screening (Visit 1).  ECG should be 
performed after the subject has rested quietly for at least 10 minutes in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_12251].  ECG tracing will be evalu ated b y the investigator in a real time for the safety 
monitoring of the subjects.  In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat abnormal 
ECGs to rule out improper lead placement as contributing to the ECG abnormality.  It 
isimportant that leads are pla ced in the same positions each time in order to achieve 
precise ECG recordings.
7.5. Suicidality Asse ssment 
7.5.1. Sheehan -Suicidality Tracking Scale (S -STS)
The Sheehan -Suicidality Tracking Scale (S -STS, see Appendix 3) is an 8-item 
prospective rating sc ale th at tracks treatment -emergent suicidal ideation and 
behaviors.12  This scale was adapted from the Suicidality Module of the Mini 
International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) Structured Diagnostic Interview for 
DSM -IV.  Items 1a, 2 -6, 7a, and 8 are scored on a 5 -point Likert scale (ranging from 0= 
not at all to 4=extremely).  Items 1, 1b, and 7 require yes or no responses.  This scale 
can be administered either by a clinician o r patient through self- report.  In this study, 
the scale will be completed by [CONTACT_3433] e patient (self -report). The Baseline -Lifetime 
Assessment will be completed at Screening and the “Since Last Visit” version will be 
completed at Baseline(Visit 2) , Randomizat ion(Visit 3), Week 1 (Visit 4), Week 6
(Visit 5), Week 12 (Visit 6) , Week 15 (Visit 7) and ET. 
7.5.2. Patient Health Questionnaire -8 (PHQ), Appendix 3.
The PHQ -8 (See Appendix 3 ) is a self -administered version of the PRIME -MD 
diagnostic instrument for com mon mental disorders.  The PHQ- 9 is the depression 
module, which scores each of the 9 DSM -IV criteria as 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every 
day).[ADDRESS_493033] 8 items 
of the measure, will be completed by [CONTACT_216814] (Visit 1). 
7.5.3. Suicidality Assessments 
During Screening
A risk assessment should be done by a qualified mental health professional (MHP: a 
psychiatrist or licensed PhD level cli nical psychologist) to assess whether it is safe for 
the subject to participate in the trial if at least one of the fol lowing three conditions are 
met:
Subject’s responses on the S -STS items 1a, 1b, 3 and 4, 5, 6, or 8 is positive 
(score 1);
or

Presence of any current major psychiatric disorder that is not explicitly 
permitted in the inclu sion/exclusion criteria.
A written copy of the risk assessment should be included in the subject’s clinical record 
(source document ation).
During the Clinical Trial:
At the Baseline and post-baseline visits, if there are a ny positive response on the S-STS

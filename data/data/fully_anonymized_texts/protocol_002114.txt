 2.0      BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis:  
Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a syndrome of severe immune activation and deregulation resulting in extreme and often life threatening inflammation[1, 2]. HLH o ccurs as either a primary (familial - 
FHL) or secondary (sporadic - sHLH) disorder[3, 4]. Both conditions manifest pathological immune acti vation and may be difficult to 
differentiate from each other.   Primary HLH is an autosomal recessive disease with an incidence of 1/50,[ADDRESS_1262619] a clear familial inheritance 
   HLH  therapy  in adults 
   2014‐0989 
   01/26/2018  
 3or genetic mutation. Median survival is  less than 2 months if untreated[5]. 
Disease symptoms usually appear during infancy or early childhood. 
Immunological triggers such as vacci nations and viral infections may 
trigger bouts of disease in these patient s. However, in many circumstance 
no clear cut immune trigger is identifiable[6].   Secondary HLH includes adults and older  children who lack family history 
or known genetic cause for HLH. Second ary HLH often occurs as a result 
of pathological immune activation in response to a trigger. Frequently 
noted triggers include malignancy (espec ially hematological malignancies 
including acute leukemia’s, MDS and myelofibrosis), infections (especially EBV) and rheumatological disorders. T he list of triggers associated with 
secondary HLH is extensive[7, 8]. Secondary HLH that develops in the 
setting of malignancy is also known as malignancy-associated 
hemophagocytic syndrome (MAHS). MAHS may manifest as the 
presenting feature of  a yet undiagnosed malignancy or may manifest 
during the treatment of  a known malignancy.  
 Categorizing patients into primary or secondary HLH is often difficult and may be of limited value. Treatment s hould be initiated expediently if the 
diagnosis of HLH is suspected. 
 2.2      Immune activation and HLH:            Patient s with HLH have deregulation of  the immune system including 
predisposing immunodeficiency, i mmune activation and immunopathology 
(Table 1) [1, 9]. Immune-activation and immune mediated pathology likely 
play a central role in the evolution of HLH. This included acute clinical 
signs and symptoms of immune ac tivation including hepatomegaly, 
jaundice, adenopathy, rash, seizures, and focal neurologic deficits as well 
as laboratory measures such as stri kingly high serum levels of numerous 
cytokines including interferon gamma (IFN γ), tumor necrosis factor α 
(TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL- 10, and macrophage–colony-stimulating 
factor (M-CSF)[10-12]. Furthermore, biopsies of lymphoid tissues or 
histological examination of liver tissue from HLH patients reveal highly 
activated macrophages and lymphocytes, supporting striking activation of 
the immune system.

2.3      Proposed immunological m odel of pathophysiology of HLH:  
           Jordan et al used perforin-deficient  mice models to better define the 
immonobiology of HLH. Perforin defici ent mice on exposure to lymphocytic 
choriomeningitic virus manifested most of the clinical features of HLH 
along with elevation of multiple seru m cytokines and histological evidence 
of hemophagocytosis. They identified that CD8+ cells and IFN-gamma 
were essential to the development of  HLH pathophysiology in response to 
LCMV infection (Figure 1).

             (A) Duri ng a normal immune response, pres entation of antigen promotes 
CD8
+ T-cell responses . In return, CD8+ T cells secrete IFN γ, which 
activates antigen-presenting cell s and further promotes antigen 
presentation. This positive feedback loop is restrained by [CONTACT_900455]-dependent mechanisms. It remains unclear whether this occurs via specific destruction of professi onal antigen-presenting cells, general 
destruction of virally infected ce lls, or additional mechanisms.

mechanisms allows for spi[INVESTIGATOR_900432] γ. This leads to the development of an HLH-like 
syndrome. 
             Adapted from  Jordan M et al, Blood 2004[9] 
 2.4       Diagnosti c criteria for HLH: 
            The init ial HLH guidelines in 1991, incl uded 5 features: (1) fever, (2) 
splenomegaly, (3) cytopenis affecting at  least two or three lineages in the 
peripheral blood, (4) hypertriglyceri demia and/or hypofibrinogenemia, and 
(5) hemophagocytosis in bone marrow, spleen or lymph nodes[13]. The 2004 guidelines (Table 2) included 3 additional criteria: (6) low or absent NK-cell activity, (7) hyperferritinemia and (8) high levels of s-IL2r. Five of 
eight criteria must be fu lfilled to make a diagnosis of HLH[2]. However, 
patients with a molecular diagnosis of HLH do not need to fulfill the diagnostic criteria.  These diagnos tic criteria hav e been developed for 
pediatric HLH and have not been validated for adult HLH. These will serve as a background for evaluating HLH in adults but are not to be used as 
diagnostic criteria for adult HLH.

 72.5 Therapy of HLH: 
                         The goal of initial therapy is to suppress the overactive 
immune system thus prevent ing immune-mediated organ 
damage. Induction therapy is o ften followed by [CONTACT_900456] a suitabl e donor is available. If no 
suitable donor is identified, patients are followed closely for signs of relapse.  The HLH-94 protocol proposed in 1997 
included an 8-week regimen with etoposide, dexamethasone and intrathecal methotrexate (Fig ure 2) [14]. This systematic 
therapeutic approach significant ly improved the outcomes 
and survival of patients with HLH.  
                         The HLH-[ADDRESS_1262620] practice outside of a 
clinical protocol has been to  treat patient s who are not 
enrolled in a clinical study wit h a strategy based on HLH-94.  
 Figure 2: Induction therapy for HLH.  Based on the HLH-[ADDRESS_1262621] of care for all 
patients not enrolled in clin ical trials, based on published 
evidence of efficacy. Etoposide is dosed as 150 mg/m2 per 
dose.

   01/26/[ADDRESS_1262622] of care fo r all patients not en rolled in clinical 
trials, based on published evidence of efficacy. Etoposide is dosed as 150 
mg/m2 per dose. Alternativ ely, for patients weighi ng < 10 kg, consideration 
may be given to dosing etoposide as 5 mg/kg per dose. Dexamethasone (Dex.) 
is dosed as indicated and may be give n orally or intravenously, although the 
latter is preferred at therapy ini tiation. Intrathecal methotrexate and 
hydrocortisone (IT MTX/HC) should be gi ven to patients with evidence of 
CNS involvement, as early as LP may be  safely performed (which may vary 
from the diagram) and dosed as follows : age < 1 year, 6/8 mg (MTX/HC); 1-2 
years, 8/10 mg; 2-3 years, 10/12 mg; > 3 years, 12/[ADDRESS_1262623] 1 week after resolution of CNS 
involvement (both clinic al and CSF indices). 
 
The current standard of care consists of a decrescendo course of etoposide and 
dexamethasone, with or wit hout intrathecal therapy (Fi gure 2). Ideally, critically 
ill patients should be treated at facilitie s familiar with care of cancer and bone 
marrow transplant patients. It is importan t to initiate thera py promptly, even in 
the face of unresolved infections, cy topenias, or organ dysfunction. Because 
etoposide is cleared by [CONTACT_900457] d hepatic routes, we recommend dose 
reductions of 25% for creatinine clea rance of 10-50 mL/minute, 50% for 
creatinine clearance of < 10 mL/minute, and 75% in case creatinine clearance is 
< 10 mL/minute and direct bilirubin is > 3 mg/dL. We do not dose reduce 
etoposide for isolated hyperb ilirubinemia or neutropeni a. HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_900433].

  3.0 RATIONALE FOR THIS STUDY: The outcomes with the HLH-[ADDRESS_1262624] of care for HLH in adult patients. Thus, definitive measures to diagnose and treat HLH in our patient population ar e warranted.

dexamethasone (20mg/m2/day) for the first week followed by [CONTACT_900458] x 
8 weeks with dexamethasone 10 mg /m2/day. They have discontinued 
cyclosporine as it was a ssociated with increased in cidence of neurotoxicity 
without significant therapeutic  benefit in prior pediatric HLH studies. The current 
HIT-HLH regimen is similar to the HLH- 94, except that pat ients will receive 2 
fewer doses of etoposide. The data remain confidential as this is an ongoing

 10study, however the interim results do not appear to be compelling (personal 
communication; Kenneth McClain and Carl Allen, [LOCATION_007] Childrens Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]). 
 Alemtuzumab is an effective salvage agent for refractory HLH, leading to improvement and survival to HSCT in many patients[15]. Alemtuzumab up-front 
in combination with dexamethasone (20mg/m2/day) and etoposide may afford the best combination to target HLH. Ou r collaborators at TCH believe this may 
provide the most effective regimen fo r HLH and are currently treating newly 
diagnosed pediatric HLH patient s with a combination of alemtuzumab, etoposide, 
and dexamethasone. A pediatric protocol in corporating alemtuzumab, etoposide, 
and dexamethasone for the therapy of pediatric HLH is being developed. We propose a combination regimen of  alemtuzumab with etoposide and 
dexamethasone for adult patients with HLH.  Tocilizumab is and anti-IL6 monoclona l antibody and has shown significant 
activity in cytokine release syndrome, a condition closely related to HLH with 
similar cytokine elevation profile. We have used tocilizumab in refractory cases of Adult M-HLH with successful and rapid improv ement in levels of ferritin, LDH, 
coagulopathy, organomegaly, and fevers. Tocili zumab is also more tolerable with 
less risk of T-lymphodepletio n associated secondary infections such as CMV and 
HSV. Based on our experience with tocilizumab in patients with CART 
associated CRS and in refractory HLH we propose the option to use tocilizumab in combination with etoposide and dexamethasone as an alternative to 
alemtuzumab with etoposide and dexam ethasone in adults with HLH. The 
tocilizumab may be an especially attractive  option in patients who are critically ill 
or already myelosuppressed from recent chemotherapy as it may have a lower risk of inducing further myelosupp ression and secondary life-threatening 
infections.  For further details on etoposide and alem tuzumab please see the etoposide drug 
insert (Appendix D), alemtuzu mab drug insert  (Appendix E). 
 
4.0 STUDY DESIGN 
 
 This will be a phase II, single-arm open-label study. All patients will 
be registered through CORe. Up to  40 patients will be enrolled in 
the study.  
 
 The study will consist of two phases:  
(1) Induction phase: Patients will receive treatment on one of two 
arms at the discretion of t he treating physician and the PI: 
[CONTACT_40845] 1: Alemtuzumab with etoposide and dexamethasone during the induction phase .  OR  Arm 2: Tocilizumab with etopos ide and dexamethasone during 
the induction phase.

   01/26/2018  
 11(2) Maintenance phase: The maintenance phase may last up to [ADDRESS_1262625] evidence of budding relapse during the maintenance phase may revert back to receiving etoposide.  
 
 Intrathecal methotrexate 12 mg  and hydrocortisone 15 mg (IT 
MTX/HC) should be given to pat ients with evidence of CNS 
involvement, as early as LP ma y be safely performed. Weekly 
intrathecal therapy is generally c ontinued for at least [ADDRESS_1262626] 1 week after resolution of CNS involvement (both clinical and CSF indices).  
 
 Arm 1: Patients will initially receiv e alemtuzumab as an SQ or IV 
infusion. SQ administration will be preferred. It is suggested that 
alemtuzumab be administered daily for 4 days (recommended on Days 1-4) during the induction p hase. The induction phase may 
last up to 8 weeks.  During the maintenance phase it is suggested that patients receive alemtuzumab approximately once every 4 weeks for the up to 16 weeks. Pa tients may receive alemtuzumab 
more or less frequently duri ng the induction and maintenance 
phase at the discretion of the treating physician only after discussion with the PI. C ontinuation of therap y after 24 weeks of 
therapy may be considered on a case-by-case basis. For further 
details please refer to the Treatment Plan (section 5.0).  
 
Arm 2:  Patients will receive tocilizumab on Day 1 or 2 if they are 
thought to be better candidates for the Arm 2 based on review of 
the clinical parameters by [CONTACT_900459]. The 
tocilizumab will be administered IV. The tocilizumab dosing may be repeated as needed during the initial 4 weeks of therapy to gain 
adequate disease control   
  4.0 PATIENT SELECTION: Patient must meet all inclusion and excl usion criteria prior to being enrolled on 
study. Results of all baseline evaluations, which assure that all inclusion and exclusion criteria have been satisfied, must be reviewed by [CONTACT_9532] [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her desig nee prior to enrollment of th at patient. In addition, the 
patient, or if the patient is incapacit ated at time of consent, the surrogate 
decision-maker, must be thoroughly info rmed about all aspects of the study, 
including the study visit schedule and r equired evaluations and all regulatory 
requirements for informed consent. Wri tten consent will be obtained from the 
patient, or if incapacitated, will be obtained from the surrogate decision-maker, as 
per MDACC Institutional Policy.    The following criteria apply to all pat ients enrolled onto the study unless 
otherwise specified.

Inclusion Criteria  
 Sign an IRB-approved in formed consent document. 
 
 Patients must be >/= 18 years of age. 
 
 A documentation of diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphocytosis, either 
newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory  by [CONTACT_900460] [INVESTIGATOR_900435].  It must be noted that no diagnostic criteria have been established for 
diagnosis of HLH in adult patients as this was a hitherto poorly identified 
and considered to be a very rare di sease in adults. We have seen an 
increasing number of cases of HLH at our instituti on over the last [ADDRESS_1262627] Carl Allen at TCH (experts in  pediatric HLH). Adult HLH seems to 
occur more frequently post malignancy and has a more fulminant course 
than pediatric HLH. The diagnostic crit eria that have been traditionally 
used for children (HLH 1991 and HLH 2004) may not adequately diagnose HLH in adults. This is the first adult  HLH protocol in the country. In the 
absence of standard diagnostic guidelines  if the patient's symptoms are 
highly suspi[INVESTIGATOR_900436]-up to rule out alternate potential alternat e etiologies is performed we will treat the patient 
for HLH as missing the diagnosis is associated with high mortality. These patients will be discussed with the PI (D r Daver) prior to enrollment in all 
such cases. 
 
 Organ function as defined below ( unless due to the HLH process): 
Serum creatinine </= 3.0 mg/dL Total bilirubin </= 5.0 mg/dL  If organ dysfunction is thought to be rela ted to the HLH process this must 
be clearly documented in the char t and the patients may be enrolled on 
study irrespective of creat inine and bilirubin levels. 
 
 Women of childbearin g potential must practice contraception. Females of 
childbearing potential:  Recommendation is for 2 effective contraceptive methods during the study. Adequate forms of contraception are double barrier methods (condoms with spermi cidal jelly or foam and diaphragm 
with spermicidal jelly or foam), oral, depo provera, or injectable 
contraceptives, intrauterine devices, and tubal ligation.  Male patients with 
female partners who are of childbeari ng potential:  Recommendation is for 
male and partner to use at least [ADDRESS_1262628] dose of study drug.

 Negative urine pregnancy test and/ or serum pregnancy test within 7 days 
of initiation of therapy. 
 
 Male patients with female partners who are of childbearing potential:  
Recommendation is for male and partner to use at least [ADDRESS_1262629] dose of study drug. 
  Exclusion Criteria  
 Pregnant or breast feeding women 
 
 Any serious/and or unstable pre-exis ting medical disorder (aside from 
malignancy exception above), psychiatric disorder, or other conditions that 
could interfere with subject’s safety, obtaining informed consent or compliance to the study procedures.  
 
 Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol.  
  
5.0 TREATMENT PLAN 
 
5.1 General 
All patients will be regi stered through CORe. 
 
5.2 Schedule 
 
 The current standard of care consists of a decrescendo course of 
etoposide and dexamethasone, with or  without intrathecal therapy 
(HLH-2004). Unfortunately, the outc omes in adult patients remain 
dismal suggesting the need for impr oved regimens. In the more 
recent HIT-HLH protocol (appendix F) our pediatric collaborators 
used 5 days of ATG (or alemtuzum ab in patients unable to tolerate 
ATG) with weekly etoposide and continuous dexamethasone. 
However, the outcomes with this combination have not been significantly better than the HL H-2004 (personal correspondence, 
Kenneth McClain and Carl Allen).   Alemtuzumab as a single-agent ha s shown efficacy in relapsed 
HLH. Alemtuzumab has been well to lerated in pediatric patients 
with relapsed HLH with no unexpect ed toxicities[15]. A pediatric 
protocol combining alemtuzumab,  etoposide, dexamethasone for 
the frontline treatment of HLH is currently being developed. 
 Tocilizumab has shown to be very effective in postCART cell CRS. 
We have also used tocilizumab in adult highly refractory HLH 
   HLH  therapy  in adults 
   2014‐0989 
   01/26/2018  
 14cases with success. Tocilizumab is less immunosuppressive than 
alemtuzumab and may be a good alter native especially in patients 
who are already immunosuppressed from recent Myeloablative 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
We will evaluate the addition of a biologic agent (either alemtuzumab or tocilizumab) to etoposide and dexamethasone for the treatment of adults with HL H in this phase II study.  
 
5.2.[ADDRESS_1262630] ing to the following schedule: 
 
Induction (Week 1-8)  
 
 If patient receives etoposi de, dexamethasone, alemtuzumab, 
tocilizumab, or intrathecal metroxat e as standard of care prior to 
signing of consent, these medications will not need to be repeated upon signing of informed consent, as determined by [CONTACT_9532].  
 Patients will receive etoposide and dexamethasone at a fixed dose 
during the induction phase. This includes fixed dose of etoposide 
150 mg/m2 once a week for up to 8 weeks, dexamethasone 20 mg/m2 daily for 1 week followed by [CONTACT_149618] 10 mg/m2 for 
1 week followed by [CONTACT_149618] 5 mg/m2 for 2 weeks followed 
by [CONTACT_149618] 2.5 mg/m2 for 2 weeks followed by 
[CONTACT_149618] 1.25 mg/m2 for [ADDRESS_1262631] up to 8 weeks. The dexamet hasone will be divided BID, given 
intravenously (IV) for at least 1 week before switching to oral 
formulation. Patients may rece ive etoposide and dexamethasone 
more or less frequently during t he induction phase at the discretion 
of the treating physician after disc ussion with the PI.  Dosages of 
etoposide and dexamethasone may also be adjusted at the 
discretion of the treating physician and after discussion with the PI.  
The etoposide and dexamethasone backbone will remain the same whether the patients are tr eated on Arm 1 (alemtuzumab 
combination) or arm 2 (tocilizumab combination). 
 
 It is important to initiate ther apy promptly, even in the face of 
unresolved infections, cytopenias, or organ dysfunction. Because etoposide is cleared by [CONTACT_900461], we recommend dose reductions of 25% for creatinine clearance of 10-50 mL/minute, 50% for creatinine clearance of < 10 mL/minute, and 
75% in case creatinine clearanc e is < 10 mL/minute and direct 
bilirubin is > 3 mg/dL. We do not recommend dose reduction of 
etoposide for isolated hyperbili rubinemia or neutropenia. HLA 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_900437] 
   2014‐0989 
   01/26/[ADDRESS_1262632]. Other dose modifications and dose-
reductions will be according to institutional standards.  
  Intrathecal methotrexate 12 mg and hydrocortisone 15 mg (IT 
MTX/HC) should be given to pat ients with evidence of CNS 
involvement (evidence of CNS in volvement includes any of the 
following: elevated CSF protein or white count, seizures, focal or 
global neurologic deficit, MRI abno rmalities consistent with CNS 
involvement by [CONTACT_333435]) as early as lumbar puncture (LP) may be 
safely performed. Weekly intrathecal therapy is generally continued for a minimum of at least [ADDRESS_1262633] 1 week after resolution of CNS 
involvement (both clinical and CS F indices). Lumbar puncture and 
IT therapy may be delayed if t he treating physician deems that 
performing this procedure is excessi vely risky due to coagulopathy 
or thrombocytopenia. 
 
  Arm 1: Alemtuzumab Arm: Alem tuzumab dosing will be similar to 
CLL with patients receiving an escalating dose of alemtuzumab titrated based on their tolerance of  the alemtuzumab infusion. The 
maximum dose of alemtuzumab in  this study (alemtuzumab 30 
mg/day) is the same maximum dose used in the CLL Phase 3 studies [16]. This dosing of alemtu zumab has been well tolerated in 
pediatric population with no unexpected toxicities. A similar dosing schema of alemtuzumab, etoposide,  and dexamethasone is used 
in a pediatric protocol that is being developed to treat HLH in 
children by [CONTACT_900462]. 
 
 Arm 2: Tocilizumab arm: The toc ilizumab dosing will be similar to 
cytokine release syndrome. T he recommended starting dose of 
tocilizumab is 4 to 8 mg/kg IV infusion. The tocilizumab may be given before or after or concomit antly with the etoposide. The start 
of tocilizumab administration may be delayed beyond day [ADDRESS_1262634] 24 hours before re-
dosing. There is no maximum number or dose of tocilizumab that 
cannot be exceeded, although it is recommended that if the patients HLH is not responding a fter 4 consecutive tocilizumab 
infusions in combination with the etoposide and dexamthasone 
then alternate therapy fo r the HL be considered

 Patients will receive alemtuzumab as  a SQ injection or IV infusion 
(IV infusion will be over approximat ely 2 hours). Patients may begin 
with SQ injection and switch to IV infusion or vice-versa. The goal 
is to administer a total alemtuzu mab dose of 1.0 mg/kg over 4 days 
(days 1-4). The first injection/in fusion will include alemtuzumab 0.1 
mg/kg to be administered on day [ADDRESS_1262635] of the patient and the reason for delay should be documented in the patient chart. Alemtuzumab may be 
administered on the same days as etoposide or on other days during the induction. If administered on the same day, alemtuzumab should be adminis tered approximately 1-2 hours 
after the etoposide infusion.  
 
A suggested alemtuzumab-dosin g schema is as follows:  
Day 1 0.1 mg/kg  Day 2 0.3 mg/kg Day 3 0.3 mg/kg Day 4 0.3 mg/kg  Patients may receive alemtuzum ab more or less frequently, at a 
lower dose or on a different dos ing schedule during the induction 
phase at the discretion of the tr eating physician after discussion 
with the PI. 
 
 All chemotherapeutic and biol ogic agents will be dosed, prepared, 
and administered according to MDAC C institutional guidelines. BSA 
will be recalculated prior to each subsequent course.  
 Alemtuzumab will be administered per  local institutional guidelines, 
with dexamethasone (above) servi ng as the corticosteroid 
premedication, along with acetaminophen, and antihistamines, as deemed appropriate. If a patient is unable to tolerate alemtuzumab due to severe injection/infusion reactions, then site investigators must discuss alternative treatment (such as tocilizumab or ATG) 
with the principal investigator. 
 
 Tocilizumab will be administered as per institutional guidelines, with 
premeds as deemed appropriate. If a patient is unable to tolerate 
tocilizumab due to severe injection/infusion reactions or concern for worsening CNS toxicity from the to cilizumab, then site investigators 
must discuss alternative treatment (such as alemtuzumab or ATG) 
with the principal investigator.  
Maintenance (Week 9-24 or commencing upon completion of Induction 
Phase)

 Arm 1: The induction will be follo wed by a maintenance phase of for 
up to an additional 16 weeks. During the maintenance phase 
alemtuzumab will be administered at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg once 
every 4 weeks along with dexamet hasone 1.25 mg/m2 three times a 
week by [CONTACT_1966]. Patients who have evidence of refractory disease or budding relapse during the maintenanc e phase may revert back to 
receiving etoposide. Patients ma y receive alemtuzumab and/or 
dexamethasone more or less freq uently, and dosages may also be 
adjusted, during the maintenance phase at the discretion of the 
treating physician after discussion with the PI. The maintenance duration may be reduced at the discret ion of the treating physician in 
discussion with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_17446] r eason for early discontinuation 
should be clearly documented. Cont inuation of therapy after 24 
weeks of therapy may be considered on a case-by-case basis. Other agents such as ruxolitinib (o r other drugs with proven benefit 
in pediatric or adult HLH) ma y be added during the maintenance 
phase of the protocol.  
 Arm 2: Patients treated with to cilizumab in combination with 
etoposide and dexamethasone will not  be required to receive 
maintenance with tocilizumab. These patients may be considered for alternate maintenance approaches such as maintenance with 
ruxolitinib or other anti-HLH medications.  
 
 In general, every attempt should be made to diagnose and treat 
infections, which may be underlying or triggering HLH (regardless of 
whether one considers the patients to have ‘primary’ or ‘secondary’ 
HLH). If the patient is stable, c onsideration should be given to 
treating the infection before initia ting therapy for HLH. Furthermore, 
if the patient is stable, initial tr eatment for HLH with corticosteroids 
alone may be considered. In such circumstances, the experience and judgment of the treating phy sician and discussion with the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_900438]. 
 
5.3 Dose Adjustments 
 
Drug doses may be modified for drug-related > grade 2 nonhematologic toxicities. Dose interruptions/reductions of alemtuzumab and etoposide can also  be made in other clinical 
situations where this step is considered to be in the best interest for the patient and after discussion with the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_900439]/recommendation.   The following table is a suggesti on for dose modifications of 
etoposide in subsequent treatment courses: 
   HLH  therapy  in adults

Table 3: Suggested dose modifications for non-hematologic toxicity 
Dose level Etoposide (mg/m2) 
0 150 mg/m2 
-1 100 mg/m2 
-2 50 mg/m2 
-3 50 mg/m2 
 
Investigators should, whenever possible, determine which 
medication is causing the toxicity. Doses of each individual drug can 
be modified if toxicity is considered due a particular drug. The dexamethasone dose may be inte rrupted or reduced at the 
discretion of the treating physician.   Dose modifications of etoposide, alemtuzumab, and tocilizumab for organ dysfunction will generally be according to institutional 
standards. These must be discu ssed with the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_900440].   
Modifications of dose schedules other than the above  will be allowed 
within the followin g guidelines: 
 
 Further dose reductions can be m ade to keep clinically significant 
toxicities grade < 2.  
  Dose adjustments by [CONTACT_726]  1 dose level (e.g. decrease in 
dose from dose level 0 to dose level -2  in table 3) at a time can be 
considered when judged in the best interest of the patient (e.g. 
sepsis, hemorrhage) when toxicity has resolved. The reason for 
this reduction will be discussed with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_12749]-PI [INVESTIGATOR_900441]. 
 
 A patient who has had a dose r eduction because of any of the 
reasons mentioned above may ha ve their dose escalated 
provided the patient has resolution (partial or complete) of the 
toxicity requiring dose adjustment s as defined above for at least 2 
weeks. Escalation will be made by 1 dose-level increment only, 
and not more frequent t han every 2 weeks.  
 
 Treatment interruptions and dose modifications other than the 
ones mentioned above can be considered after discussion with 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_900442]. Dose 
adjustment/delay of only one of the agents is permissible if the toxicity is most likely judged to be related to one of the agents by [CONTACT_093].  
 
5.4    Duration of Therapy 
   HLH  therapy  in adults 
   2014‐0989 
   01/26/2018  
 19In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, 
treatment may continue until one of the followin g criteria applies: 
 
1. Clinically significant progressive disease, or 
 2. Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, 
or 
 3. Patient request, or  4. General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the 
patient unacceptable for further tr eatment in the judgment of the 
investigator, or 
 5. Unacceptable toxicity that in t he opi[INVESTIGATOR_900443]. 
 
5.4.1         It is planned that up to a total of  24 weeks of therapy will be 
administered for patients derivin g benefit from this regimen 
(Induction up to 8 weeks and maintenance up to 16 weeks). Continuation of therapy for patients completing [ADDRESS_1262636] one 
dose of any of the two drugs will be considered evaluable for toxicity. 
 5.5    Supportive Care:          Supportive  care measures includi ng blood products, infection 
prophylaxis and growth factors will be administered according to institutional and Leukemia Departm ent guidelines. As a number of 
patients with HLH have an underlyi ng malignancy the concomitant 
use of chemotherapy (including but not limited to cytotoxic chemotherapy, biologic therapy , immunotherapy, molecularly 
targeted therapy, etc.) and the conc urrent use of radiotherapy for 
the underlying tumor is allowed on the protocol. Furthermore, the 
addition of therapy with ruxolit inib as a maintenance or the 
addition of other maintenance ther api[INVESTIGATOR_15128] a proven benefit in 
patients with adult or pediatric HLH will be permitted as long as 
the data is collected on  the patient chart. 
          Infections  secondary to myelosuppre ssion are common in patients 
with HLH, and may be related to underlying disease, chemotherapy, or both. Therefor e, the use of prophylactic 
   HLH  therapy  in adults 
   2014‐0989 
   01/26/2018  
 20antibiotics, antifungal agents, and antiviral agents including anti-
PCP (trimethoprim-sulfamethox azole or pentamidine) is 
recommended according to institutional standards. Viral 
surveillance/ prophylaxis includes weekly blood PCR’s for EBV, CMV, and other viruses the pati ent is known or suspected to 
harbor. Prompt treatment of  EBV viremia with rituximab 
(375mg/m2, IV) weekly to help prevent EBV associated lymphoproliferative disorder is strongly suggested. CMV viremia 
should be treated with gancyclovir or  foscarnet and cytogam, as 
appropriate. It is suggested that patients with serologic evidence 
or a history of varicella, CMV, or HSV should receive prophylaxis with acyclovir.  
          Immu noglobulin (IVIG) is suggested to  be given to maintain serum 
IgG levels >1000 mg/dl or in th e high end of the normal range. 
IVIG may need to be given relative ly frequently in patients with 
HLH due to apparent consumption.  IgG levels may need to be 
checked weekly or biweekly in such patients.  
          Concurrent therapy for CNS prophylaxis or cont inuation of therapy 
for controlled CNS disease is permitted. 
  6.[ADDRESS_1262637] the rights and safety of the 
patient will not be cons idered as deviations.  Such variations may 
include laboratory assessments completed outside of schedule, occasional missed requi red research samples such 
correlative assays.  6.1 Pretreatment evaluations

facilitate diagnosis of HLH and s hould be ordered at the discretion 
of the treating physician. 
 
 It is recommended that viral P CRs including EBV, CMV, HHV6, 
adenovirus and other relevant viruses; IgG and IgM for CMV and EBV; IgG for VZV and HSV; if Le ishmania is a pot ential concern, 
then serum IgG and IgM titers and marrow PCR should be obtained blood and bone marrow cultur es; bartonella, brucella, 
leishmania titers and PCR be collected within 7 days of initiation 
of therapy. It is required that In fectious disease be consulted at 
diagnosis to facilitate work-up.  These studies are not mandatory 
but may facilitate diagnosis of HLH and should be ordered at the 
discretion of the treating physician.

 22 Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_307772] 28 days preceding study 
initiation. Cytogeneti cs will be obtained prior to therapy (results 
from prior analysis can be used for this purpose). For patients 
who already have an evidence of hemophagocytosis on tissue 
biopsy from another site, the bo ne marrow may be omitted after 
discussion and approval with the principal investigator. 
 
 
6.2 Evaluations during study  
 Physical exam at least once weekly for the first [ADDRESS_1262638] once every 8 weeks thereafter.   
 CBC, platelet count, differential, ferritin, d-dimer, PT, PTT, LDH, 
fibrinogen, serum sodium, AST, ALT,  total bilirubin, creatinine, 
uric acid at least twice weekly fo r the first [ADDRESS_1262639] once every 8 weeks thereafter 
(differential can be omitted if WBC is ≤0.5 x10
9/L). 
 
 
 It is recommended that soluble IL2R-alpha, , IgG/IgA/IgM, 
lymphocyte subsets be obtained twice a week for the first 4 
weeks, once every 2 weeks for the next 8 weeks, once every 4 weeks for the next 12 weeks. The IL2R-alpha evaluations may be omitted once these values are wit hin normal range. These studies 
are not mandatory but may facilit ate assessment of response and 
should be ordered at the discretio n of the treating physician. 
 
 Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_50496] 4 wee ks (+/- 7 days), then every 4-12 
weeks. Bone marrow tests can be ordered more or less frequently 
if mandated by [CONTACT_195460]. No repeat bone marrow is necessary if nonresponse or progressive disease can be unequivocally di agnosed from peripheral blood 
tests or, in patients with a WBC < 0.[ADDRESS_1262640] is 
considered noncontributory by [CONTACT_733525]. 
 
 For patients that remain on study  with no significant toxicity for 
more than 24 weeks, subsequent evaluations during study may be modified after discussion with the principal investigator. These include a decrease in frequency of bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_307774] 6-12 months (or as clinically indicated), physical examination to every 12-16 weeks, and other laboratory tests to

laboratory work done at the local clinic will be forwarded to the 
patient’s attending physician at MD ACC or PI [INVESTIGATOR_7966], who 
will sign off on the labs to verify that the results have been reviewed.  
       Outside Physician Pa rticipation During Treatment 
 1. MDACC Physician communication with the outside physician is 
required prior to the patient retu rning to the local physician.  
This will be documented in the patient record.  2. A letter to the local physician outlining the patient 's participation 
in a clinical trial will request local physician agreement to supervise the patient's care (Appendix G). 
 
3. Protocol required evaluations outside MDACC will be documented by [CONTACT_756], fax or e-mail. Fax and/or e-mail will be 
dated and signed by [CONTACT_41232], indicating that they have reviewed it. Changes in drug dose and/or schedule must be discussed with and approved by [CONTACT_41233], or their representative prior to initiation, and will be 
documented in the patient record.  4. A copy of the informed consen t, protocol abstract, treatment 
schema and evaluation during treat ment will be provided to the 
local physician.  5. Documentation to be provi ded by [CONTACT_900464], reports of  protocol required laboratory

return to MDACC for physical ex amination as specified on the 
protocol evaluations.   
 End of Treatment Visit to be completed 30 days (+/-7 days) after 
the last dose of study drug, w hen possible. Blood (about 2-3 
teaspoons) will be drawn for CBC, platelet count, differential, creatinine, total bilirubin, ALT.  No  other procedures or labs will be 
needed.  
 Patients with an objective response at completion of active study 
treatment will be followed for surv ival at MD Anderson Cancer 
Center (MDACC) every 3 to 6 months for up to 5 years after completion of active treatment and while still on study. If the patient is unable to return to MDACC the follow-up visits may be conducted via telephone. 
 Treatment may be discontinued for a variety of reasons, including patient 
withdrawal, investigator decision, and reas ons specified by [CONTACT_760]. Reasons 
for discontinuation of treat ments are described below.

7.2 Follow-Up at Treatment Disc ontinuation or Early Withdrawal 
Patients who discontinue treatment  for any reason before 24 weeks 
should complete end-of-treatment pr ocedures within 30 days (+/- 7 days) 
of the last dose of t he study drug, when possibl e. End of treatment 
procedures will include a physical examination, CBC with differential and platelets, IgG/IgA/IgM, lymphocyte subsets  and a limited chemistry profile 
(total bilirubin, serum creatinine,  SGPT or SGOT). A bone marrow 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_900446]-response or progressive 
disease cannot be unequivocally diagnosed from peripheral blood. Although treatment will be discontinued at  that time, all patients who do 
not withdraw consent for follow-up, die,  or become lost to follow-up, will 
remain on study for follow-up evaluations as follows: subject will be followed for toxicity for at least [ADDRESS_1262644] the patient by [CONTACT_820807] a verbal assessment of t he patient’s condition. The phone 
conversation will then be document ed in the patient’s charts.  
 7.3 Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_900447]. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_900448], temporarily suspending 
enrollment, or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_900449]. 
Reasons for terminating the clinical study include, but are not limited to, 
the following: 
 The incidence or severity of  an adverse reaction related to 
treatment in this study or other studies indicates a potential health 
hazard to patients 
 Study site personnel are noncom pliant with study procedures 
 Pattern of noncompliance is observed

8 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 
     Please see appendix H for “Leukemia-specific Adverse Event Recording 
and Reporting Guidelines” 
 9.0 ALEMTUZUMAB ADMINISTRATON GUIDELINES  The following guidelines should be cons idered during the administration of 
alemtuzumab:  
 Premedicate with diphenhydramine (50 mg) and acetaminophen (500 
mg to 1000 mg) [ADDRESS_1262646] infusion and each dose 
escalation. Institute appropriate medical management (e.g., steroids, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], meperidine) for infusion reactions as needed. 
 
 Administer trimethoprim/sulfamethox azole DS twice daily (BID) 3 times 
per week (or equivalent) as Pneumocystis jiroveci  pneumonia (PCP) 
prophylaxis. 
 
 Administer famciclovir 250 mg BID or equivalent as herpetic prophylaxis. 
 
 Continue PCP and herpes viral prophy laxis for a minimum of 2 months 
after completion of alemtuzumab or until the CD4+ count is ≥200 cells/µL, 
whichever occurs later. 
 
• Administer as an IV infusion over approximately 2 hours 
 
• Do not administer as IV push or bolus 
 
• Gradually escalate to the maximum recommended single dose of 30 mg. 
Escalation is required at initiation of dosing or if dosing is held ≥7 days 
during treatment. 
 
• In clinical trials, the frequency of infusion reactions with alemtuzumab 
was highest in the first week of treat ment. The following serious, including 
fatal, infusion reactions have been id entified in post-marketing reports: 
syncope, pulmonary infiltrates, acut e respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] 
(ARDS), respi[INVESTIGATOR_13374], cardiac a rrhythmias, myocardial infarction, 
acute cardiac insufficiency, cardiac arrest, angioedema, and anaphylactoid shock. Carefully monitor patients during infusions and withhold alemtuzumab for Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions.

 27 
• Prolonged myelosuppression have been reported in patients receiving 
alemtuzumab. Alemtuzumab treatment  results in severe and prolonged 
lymphopenia with a concomitant incr eased incidence of opportunistic 
infections. Assess CD4+ counts after treatment until recovery to ≥ 200 
cells/µL. Consider obtaining comp lete blood counts (CBC) at weekly 
intervals during alemtuzumab therapy  and more frequently if worsening 
anemia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopeni a occurs. Consider withholding 
alemtuzumab for severe or lif e-threatening cytopenias (except 
lymphopenia). Consider discontinui ng alemtuzumab for autoimmune 
cytopenias or recurrent/persistent  severe cytopenias (except 
lymphopenia). 
 
• Administer only irradiated blood produc ts to avoid transfusion associated 
Graft versus Host Disease (TAGV HD), unless emergent circumstances 
dictate immediate transfusion. 
 
• Routinely monitor patients for CMV infection during alemtuzumab 
treatment and for at least 2 months  following completi on of treatment. 
Consider withholding alemtuzumab fo r serious infections and during 
antiviral treatment for CM V infection or confirmed CMV viremia. Initiate 
therapeutic ganciclovir (or equivalent) fo r CMV infection or confirmed CMV 
viremia [17]. 
 
• It is recommended to not administer live viral vaccines to patients who 
have recently received alemtuzumab 
 
10.0 RESPONSE EVALUATION 
 There are no standardized response cr iteria for HLH. Marsh et al 
proposed a response evaluation schema for patients with relapsed/refractory HLH treated wit h alemtuzumab. We will use this 
response schema for evaluation of  response to alemtuzumab in 
combination with etoposide and dexamethasone. As outlined in section 6.2 (Evaluations during treatment ) patients quantifiable symptoms and 
laboratory markers of HLH will be ev aluated and recorded. Information to 
be recorded includes (but is not limited to) levels of soluble IL2R-alpha, 
ferritin, LDH, fibrinogen, and trigl yceride; hemoglobin, neutrophil counts, 
platelet counts, AST, ALT,  level of consciousness (documented in clinical 
exams in patients with CNS HLH), and presence of hemophagocytosis in 
pathology specimens.  Complete response (CR)  is defined as normalization to within 
institutional normal limits of diagnosti c clinical and laboratory abnormalities 
associated with HLH, including but not  limited to: fever, cytopenias, 
splenomegaly, hepatomegaly or lymphadenopathy, decreased fibrinogen, increased triglyceride, increased VL DL, increased sCD25, (optionally), 
   HLH  therapy  in adults 
   2014‐0989 
   01/26/2018  
 28elevated bilirubin, elevated liver enzymes, hyponatremia, 
hypoalbuminemia, elevated CNS  proteins or mononuclear 
cells/lymphocytes and CNS symptoms.  In the case of ferritin, 
normalization OR a [ADDRESS_1262647] therapy level is also 
below [ZIP_CODE] ng/ml. It is also recogni zed that hemoglobin and platelet 
counts may be artificially increased with transfusion or may remain low in 
patients with underlying malignancy/recent myelotoxic chemotherapy and may not be immediately assessable.   Partial response (PR)  is defined as sustained normalization of 3 or more 
of the diagnostic clinical and labor atory abnormalities noted above  (or, 
with ferritin, improvement as  described above) and no apparent 
progression of other aspects of disease pathology.   Parameter improvements (PI)  is defined as at least a 25% improvement 
in two or more quantifiable symptoms  and/or laboratory markers from 
those mentioned above within 8 weeks (+/- 7 days) of  initiation of therapy 
with the following caveats: soluble IL-2 receptor response was defined as a greater than 1.5-fold dec rease. For patients with initial platelet count 
<50,[ADDRESS_1262648] 
100% AND a platelet count >50K in the absence of a transfusion within 7 days. For patients with initial plat elet count >50,[ADDRESS_1262649] 100%. Responses based on 
hemoglobin were not used to dete rmine response as these are often 
confounded by [CONTACT_27752]. For patient s with an initial ANC of less than 
500, a response was defined as an incr ease of ANC by [CONTACT_2669] 100% to 
greater than 500  cells/µl. For patients with an ANC 500–2,000  cells/µl, an 
increase by [CONTACT_2669] 100% to more than 5,000 cells/µl was considered a response. For patients with transaminit is with an ALT great er than 400, an 
ALT response was defined as a decr ease of ALT of at least 50%. For 
patients with hemophagocytosis noted on  a biopsy specimen within [ADDRESS_1262650] known values were  used for evaluation of response. 
 Reactivation is defined as worsening of two or more HLH-defining 
clinical/laboratory parameters with the following specifications. Numerical laboratory values must become abnormal and worsen by >30%, on two sequential assessments abnormal and wo rse by >30% on 2 assessments 
performed on different days). Worsening  in clinical criteria (fever, 
splenomegaly, etc.) may also be cons idered, provided that consistent 
observations of worsening are made over at least three days. Additionally, 
recurrent CNS symptoms felt to be due to HLH may count as a criteria for 
   HLH  therapy  in adults 
   2014‐0989 
   01/26/2018  
 29reactivation. Patients (who previous ly responded) may also be considered 
to have reactivated if they die prio r to a second sequential assessment of 
rising disease markers, and the prox imal cause of death was deemed by 
[CONTACT_900465] (on clinical or pathological 
grounds). Assessment of NK f unction will not be considered for 
determination of relapse because diseas e activity and NK function do not 
correlate in most patients and may be inversely correlated in some 
patients 
 Diagnostic criteria not utilized in assessment of response included 
fibrinogen, as this was not checked consistently in patients; fever, 
because information was often lacking or di fficult to interpret; and liver and 
spleen size, as examinations and imagi ng results were not consistently 
documented. Cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) testing results were not analyzed 
in patients with CNS HLH because sampling was inconsistent. 
 11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 This will be a single arm, single c enter, open label study of alemtuzumab 
or tocilizumab in combination with etoposide and dexamethasone in 
patients with HLH.   11.1 Sample Size 
 
Up to a total of 40 patients will be re cruited for this Phase II study to 
receive either alemtuzu mab in combination with 
etoposide+dexamethasone or toc ilizumab in combination with 
etoposide+dexamethasone. Patients will be allocated to receive the tocilizumab or the alemtuzumab arm based on the clinical presentation of 
the HLH, comorbid conditions, under lying organ function, and PI/treating 
physician decision. The patients may not be equally allotted to Arm 1 and 
2. The goal of the study is not to  compare between Arms 1 and 2 but to 
evaluate whether the addi tion of a biologic agent (alemtuzumab or 
tocilizumab) improves the response rate and outcomes in adult patients 
with HLH as compared to etoposide+steroid alone.  The primary objective of the phase II  is to determine the efficacy of 
alemtuzumab/tocilizumab in combination with etoposide and dexamethasone in patients with HLH. The efficacy of  the combination will 
be measured by [CONTACT_900466] e rate (ORR), defined as CR and/or 
PR and/or PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] 8 weeks (+/- 7 days) of treatment  initiation among 
patients with HLH. ORR and toxicity will be monitored simultaneously using the Bayesian approach of Thall,  Simon, Estey (1995, 1996) and the 
extension by [CONTACT_210872] (1998).   11.2 Statistical Design

   01/26/[ADDRESS_1262651] therapy or historical data regarding response rates in 
adult patients with HLH. The target O RR with the experiment al treatment in 
HLH is 20%. This regimen of the combination treatment will be considered 
worthy of further investigation if it  elicits an increase in ORR to 30% with 
acceptable toxicity.  A >30% drug-re lated grade 3/4 toxicity rate is 
considered unacceptable.  Thus, interim monitoring rules, assuming the prior 
distributions below, were constructed t hat meet the following two conditions, 
1) Stop if Prob{ p(O RR,E )<p(ORR,H)  + 0. 10 | data> 0.975, or 
2) Stop if Prob{ p(TOX, E)>0.30| data}>0.975,  
where P(ORR, E) and P(TOX, E) are t he true ORR and toxicity rates for the 
combination treatment, and p(ORR, H) is the true ORR ra te of the standard 
treatment. The first rule provides fo r stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_900450] (i.e., probability < 2. 5%) that ORR rate of the combination 
treatment is greater than the ORR rate of standard treatment by 10.0%. The 
second condition will stop the study ear ly if excessive therapy-related grade 
3/4 toxicity (>30%) is highly proba ble (i.e., probability >97.5%) for the 
combination treatment.  Monitoring for to xicity and futility will not begin until [ADDRESS_1262652] 5 patients.

Monitoring the ORR rate, based on the above assumptions and monitoring conditions is found in Table 6.  For example, accrual will cease if less than 1 patients experience an overall res ponse within 8 weeks (+/-7 days) of 
initiation of therapy in t he first 20 patients treated.

Multc Lean Desktop (version 2.1.0) wa s used to generate the toxicity and 
futility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_900451] e (Table 7). In order to utilize the 
software for the design, a constant rate  of 10% and beta (0.2, 1.8) priors and 
delta of 10% were assumed for the st andard treatment response distribution 
and experimental treatment response prior distribution, respectively. In 
addition, a 30% toxicity constant ra te and beta (0.6, 1.4) priors were 
assumed for the standard treatment toxi city constant rate and experimental 
treatment toxicity prior di stribution, respectively. 
 
The probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_900452] 20% and the true toxi city rate was 30% was 21.7%.  
Probabilities of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_900453] (i.e., 50%) were 
76.6% when the true ORR was 20% and 73.0% when true ORR rate was 
30%.

Statistical Analysis Plan All patients who received any dose of the study agent will be included in the 
analysis for efficacy and safety. Dem ographic/clinical characteristics 
(including duration of response) and safety data of the patients will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation, median and range.  For the primary efficacy analysis, we will estimate the 
ORR for the combination treatment, al ong with the 95% credible interval. 
Patients who drop out of the study before completing the cycles within 8 
weeks +/- 7 days will be treat ed as “failures” for the primary analysis if they 
do not have a response evaluation. The association between ORR and patient’s clinical characteristics will be examined by [CONTACT_195463]’s rank sum test 
or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. Toxicity type, severity and attribution 
will be summarized for each pati ent using frequency tables.  
The distribution of time-to-event endpo ints (DFS and OS) including overall 
survival and progression free survival will be estimated using the method of 
Kaplan and Meier. Comparisons of time-to-event endpoints by [CONTACT_525300]-rank tests. Pa ired t-tests will be used 
to determine the immunological and molecular changes in the peripheral blood and bone marrow from baseline to th e time of response, and to the 
time of disease progression.  
Statistical analysis of biomarker data : Descriptive statistics including plots, 
mean, median and standard deviations wi ll be used to summarize data. For 
continuous outcomes, t-test and ANO VA will be used to compare outcome 
measures across patient characterist ics. Dunnett’s and Tukey’s test that 
properly adjust for multiplicity in multiple tests will be implemented. Pair-wise 
comparisons will be performed using pr e- and post-therapy samples from 
each patient. The chi-square test or Fis her’s exact test will be used to test 
the association between two categorical  variables such as disease state and

Subjects will be assessed at each visit through Week 40 for cutaneous 
tolerability on the face. Tolerability will be assessed on a scale of 0 to 3 
where 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe for erythema, scaling, 
dryne ss, pruritus, and burning/stinging.  
The body surface area  (BSA)  treated (based on locations) will be 
collected at each visit for each subject   Extent of exposure will be 
calculated for each subject based on the number of treatments  and 
treatment area .  Extent of exposure will also be summarized on a unit 
day which will be defined as total exposure divided by [CONTACT_477383].  
Endpoints  Safety endpoints will include adverse events, changes in physical 
examination and changes in vital sign measurements. Any clinically 
significant changes noted during the physical exam as well as from the 
vital sign measurements will be recorded as adverse events and 
included in the comparison. Urine pregnancy tests in women of child -
bearing potential will be  conducted at each visit.  
Tolerability  endpoin ts will include  the investigator’s assessment of 
erythema, scaling, dryness, and the subject ’s report of pruritus and 
burning/stinging based on the preceding 24 hours.  
Statistical Methods  All statistical processing will be performed using statistical analysis 
software ( SAS®) unless otherwise stated. Safety analyses will be 
performed using the safety population.  
Safety Analyses  
Adverse Events  
All AEs occurring during the study will be recorded and classified on the 
basis of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Authorities (MedDRA) 
terminology.  Descriptions of AEs will include the date of onset, the date 
the AE ended, the severity of the AE, the relationship to study 
medication, and th e outcome. All reported AEs that occurred on or after 
the Baseline date will be included in the summaries and analysis. 
Summaries will be presented to describe the characteristics of the 
adverse events reported and will include the number and percentage of  
subjects who report at least one AE and the number of events reported 
by [CONTACT_926], seriousness, and relationship to study medication. A

1.1 B ACKGROUND 
Acne vulgaris is a chronic skin disease characterized by [CONTACT_477384], papules, 
pustules, and cysts. Current acne therapi[INVESTIGATOR_477364], topi[INVESTIGATOR_477365], 
and oral contraceptives.  
Nitric oxide is a free radical gas naturally produced by [CONTACT_477385]-inflammatory activity. Novan, Inc. has developed a topi[INVESTIGATOR_477366]1000, a 
drug which releases nitric oxide to the skin after topi[INVESTIGATOR_59407]. SB204, an admixture of an 
alcoholic NVN1000 Gel with an aqueous hydrogel, is in development for the treatment of acne 
vulgaris. In randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week, Phase 2 studies, treatment 
with SB204 decreased inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts and improved the 
Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) in subjects with acne and was well tolerated.

Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.  15 1.3 NONCLINICAL STUDIES WITH NVN1000 GEL 
Novan has conducted over 30 nonclinical studies to evaluate the local safety and tolerance of 
NVN1000 (drug substance and formulated product) following dermal administration to support 
the acne development program. Repeat dose dermal toxicology studies have included 4-week and 
13-week GLP dermal toxicology studies in miniature swine, and a 13-week dermal toxicology 
stud
y in both rats and mice. A 39-week miniature swine study has completed the in-life portion; 
data from that study will be available prior to initiation of this long-term safety study. In completed 
studies in both the miniature swine and mice, doses of NVN1000 far in excess in both 
concentration and applied surface area of projected clinical doses have not demonstrated any 
significant toxicological effects. The most relevant and persistent finding has been a transient 
dermal erythema that is concentration dependent and believed to be a consequence of a vascular 
dilation, “flushing” effect. Additional safety studies in rabbits and guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_477368]. As expected, due to the alcohol-based formulation, 
NVN1000 was found to be an ocular irritant. From a genotoxicity perspective, NVN1000 was 
positive in a standard in vitro AMES assay but negative in three in vivo mutagenicity assays. 
Additionally, in SEG I and II reproductive toxicology studies in rats and rabbits, oral 
administration of NVN1000 resulting in high systemic levels of nitrate and hMAP3, a key 
structural component of NVN1000, showed the requisite maternal toxicological effects upon dose 
esc
alation as a complication of high methemoglobin concentrations, but minimal effects on fertility 
or fetal development.

reported and the systemic AE profile has been similar in subjects treated with active (NVN1000 
Gel or SB204) and vehicle in the acne development program. Asymptomatic, transient erythema 
has been observed in some subjects.  There have been no clinically significant changes in 
laboratory results including methemoglobin, or changes in physical examinations.  
A cross-over pharmacokinetic (PK) study was conducted in 18 subjects with moderate to severe 
acne. Subjects were randomized to treatment with SB204 8% or Vehicle Gel to the face, chest, 
upper back, and shoulders (~17% BSA) in two treatment periods. In this study, there was no 
detectable plasma hMAP3 (LLOQ 5 ng/ml), a component of NVN1000 and no difference in 
plasma nitrate levels in subjects treated with SB204 versus Vehicle Gel. One subject withdrew 
during
 the second dosing period due to contact [CONTACT_8748].  A 4 period, double-dummy, cross-over 
study in subjects with moderate to severe acne is ongoing to assess effects of therapeutic and

Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.  16 supratherapeutic doses of SB204 on ECG parameters. The thorough ECG study will be completed 
prior to dosing in the Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_176241].  
In the Phase 2 clinical development program, the topi[INVESTIGATOR_34608]204 in subjects with 
acne vulgaris resulted in significant decreases in inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion 
counts and improvement in the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) when compared to vehicle. 
Once daily treatment was as effective as twice daily treatment. 
A summary of the clinical studies conducted to date in subjects with acne is in the Investigator’s 
Brochure.  
1.5 S UMMARY OF BENEFITS AND RISKS 
The pathogenesis of acne vulgaris includes several mechanisms which are potential targets for 
nitric oxide. Nitric oxide has been demonstrated to inhibit several inflammatory pathways relevant 
in acne, decrease P. acnes,  and decrease sebum production. In two completed Phase 2 studies, 
SB204 4% administered in subjects with acne decreased inflammatory and non-inflammatory 
lesion counts at the end of treatment and improved IGA scores.  Once daily treatment was as 
effective as twice daily treatment. In the studies conducted to date, the systemic AE profile was 
similar between subjects treated with NVN1000 Gel, SB204, and subjects treated with Vehicle 
Gel. SB204 4% has been generally well tolerated and has not been associated with a safety or 
tolerability signal. In PK studies, there was no detectable systemic exposure to the parent 
compound, NVN1000, or changes in plasma nitrate. 
Dermal toxicology studies in mice and minipi[INVESTIGATOR_477369]-moderate dermal changes most frequently reported. In reproductive toxicology studies, 
findings were limited to toxicities associated with high methemoglobinemia at supra-therapeutic 
doses. 
Based on the known mechanism of action of nitric oxide, theoretical risks from systemic exposure 
following topi[INVESTIGATOR_176244]1000 Gel or SB204 include hypotension and headache. 
Methemoglobin has been monitored in previous clinical studies with NVN1000 Gel and SB204 
and no significant changes in methemoglobin levels have been observed. 
Inadvertent administration to the eyes may result in ocular irritation due to the excipi[INVESTIGATOR_477370]. Should the product be accidently instilled in the eye(s), prompt flushing with 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_477371].  
A transient (approximately 5-10 minutes), asymptomatic erythema has been observed in some 
subjects shortly after application of NVN1000 Gel or SB204 which is a physiologic response 
(vasodilation) to local nitric oxide release. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_321934]-site reactions including erythema, scaling, dryness, and burning/stinging. These local 
Protocol NI- AC303  Version 1.0 
Nova
n, Inc.   09 November 2015 
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.  17 application-site reactions may occur due to the active agent (NVN1000) or the vehicle. In other 
development programs, local application-site reactions that led to treatment discontinuations were 
observed following application of alcoholic NVN1000 Gel or Vehicle Gel under occlusion in 
subjects with psoriasis or to the genital/perianal area in subjects with genital/perianal warts.  
Based on available data, Novan anticipates that the risks to subjects enrolling in this Phase 3 study 
a
t which the maximum strength of SB204 will be 4% once daily on up to 17% body surface area 
are minimal, and that appropriate monitoring is in place to assess safety. Some subjects may have 
a c
linical benefit in this long-term, open label study.  
2. RA TIONALE AND OBJECTIVES 
2.1 S TUDY RATIONALE 
Novan is conducting this study to evaluate the long term safety of SB204 4% administered once 
daily. Subjects will dose once daily for up to 40 weeks (280 days) with SB204 4% to acne affected 
areas. Based on the previous human safety data with SB204 at up to 8% and Vehicle Gel as well 
as the nonclinical safety data including dosing with and without hydrogel, this dose is expected to 
be safe and well tolerated. 
2.2 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate t he long term safety of SB204 4% once daily for 
up to 40 weeks in subjects with acne vulgaris.

SB204 will be dispensed from a dual-chamber pump designed to deliver approximately equal 
amounts of NVN1000 Gel and hydrogel. NVN1000 Gel will be opaque and the hydrogel will be 
clear. The subject will instantly mix the two substances in the palm of the hand and then 
immediately massage a thin layer over the acne affected areas once daily after washing. The 
product should be mixed for about 5 seconds until thoroughly combined with a uniform opaque 
appearance then applied with the fingertips. Subjects should apply SB204 prior to bedtime.  
Up 
to 2.7 g of SB204 4% will be applied evenly over the acne affected area, including the face, 
chest, back, and upper shoulders once a day for a period of up to 40 weeks (280 days). The amount 
of 
SB204 per application will vary depending on the areas to be treated as shown in Table 1 below. 
One pump stroke (0.9 g) will be used for the face.  Application to the face, upper back and upper 
chest/shoulders will require up to 2.7 g (three (3) pump strokes).

4.1.4 DISCO NTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL PROCEDURES 
A subject may voluntarily withdraw from study participation at any time. If the subject withdraws 
consent and discontinues from the study, the Investigator will attempt to determine the reason for 
discontinuation and record the reason in the subject’s study records and in the study database. If a 
subject is withdrawn because of an AE, that AE should be indicated as the reason for withdrawal. 
In the event of early discontinuation, (i.e., prior to Week 40/Day 280 visit) and whenever possible, 
the subje
ct should be asked to return to the study center to complete the Week 40/ET evaluations. 
S
ubjects who withdraw from the study will not be replaced. 
Protocol NI- AC303  Version 1.[ADDRESS_612277]’s participation if the subject has failed to follow study procedures or to keep follow-up 
appointments. Appropriate documentation in the subject’s study record and the study database 
regarding the reason for discontinuation must be completed.  
All subjects who fail to return to the study center for the Week 40/ET visit will be contact[CONTACT_477388](s) why the subject failed to return for the necessary visit or 
elected to discontinue from the study. If a subject is unreachable by [CONTACT_34675] a minimum of 
two documented attempts (one attempt on two different days), a certified letter will be sent 
requesting that the subject contact [CONTACT_737]. 
Reasons for an Investigator’s withdrawal of a subject may include, but are not limited to, the 
following: 
 S afety (e.g., severe adverse reactions, pregnancy ); 
 L ack of efficacy as determined by [CONTACT_737]; 
 When the requirements of the protocol are not respected (e.g., significant issues with study 
visit compliance);  
 When a concomitant medication or treatment likely to interfere with the results of the study 
is reported, or required, by [CONTACT_423] (the Investigator will decide, in consultation with 
Chiltern, whether the subject is to be withdrawn); 
 W hen a subject is lost to follow-up. The Investigator will try twice to reach the subject by 
[CONTACT_94598] a certified follow-up letter before considering that the subject is 
lost-to-follow-up. These actions will be reported on the subject’s study record and a copy 
of the follow-up letter maintained in the Investigator's file. 
Refer to Section 6.[ADDRESS_612278]’s study record and in the study database. In no case will a subject who has been 
assigned a study number and entered into the study be replaced by [CONTACT_20904].

6. E VALUATION OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
6.1 DEF INITIONS 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., sign, symptom, disease, 
syndrome, intercurrent illness, clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding, injury or 
accident) whether or not considered drug related. Any AE that emerges or worsens following 
administration of the informed consent and until the end of study participation will be collected. 
A 
pre-existing condition is one that is present prior to the start of the study and is to be reported as 
part of the subject’s medical history unless it began as an AE in NI-AC301 or NI-AC302. Adverse 
events that began during NI-AC301 or NI-AC302 that are ongoing at the conclusion of either study 
will be reported as AEs at Baseline in this long-term safety study (NI-AC303) and followed.  Prior 
conditions should be reported as an AE if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition 
worsens during the study or if the condition persists. 
An 
adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
Investigator ’s Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. 
A serious adverse event (SAE) includes any event, if in the view of either the investigator or the 
Me
dical Monitor results in any of the following outcomes: 
 De ath 
 Life-threatening event (i.e., the subject was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], at immediate 
risk of death from the event as it occurred. It does not apply to an AE that hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe) 
 Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE results in a substantial disruption 
of the subject’s ability to carry out normal life functions) 
 Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34908] (i.e., the AE required at least 
a 24-hour in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57891] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_477380]- AC303  Version 1.0 
Nova
n, Inc.   09 November 2015 
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.  33 length of stay; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_86588]/surgical procedures, scheduled 
treatments, or routine check-ups are not SAEs by [CONTACT_44134]) 
 C ongenital anomaly/birth defect (i.e., an adverse outcome in a child or fetus of a subject 
exposed to the molecule or investigational product before conception or during pregnancy) 
 Does not meet any of the above serious criteria but may jeopardize the subject or may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above (i.e., is 
a significant or important medical event) 
6.1.1 AD VERSE EVENT SEVERITY GRADES 
The Investigator is responsible for evaluating all AEs and determining the severity of the event.  
Severity will be categorized according to the following definitions: 
 Mil d:  Event may be noticeable to subject; does not influence daily activities; usually does 
not require intervention.  
 Moderate: Event may be of sufficient severity to make subject uncomfortable; performance 
of daily activities may be influenced; intervention may be needed. 
 Severe:  Event may cause severe discomfort; usually interferes with daily activities; subject 
may not be able to continue in the study; treatment or other intervention usually needed.  
The
 Investigator will follow all subjects who experience AEs until there is a return to the subject’s 
baseline condition or until a clinically satisfactory resolution is achieved or the subject is lost to 
follow-up. 
6.1.[ADDRESS_612289] will be assessed as follows: 
 De finite:  There is a clinically plausible time sequence between the onset of the AE and 
the application of investigational product; when the event responds to withdrawal of 
investigational product and recurs with re-administration of investigational product. 
 P robable:  There is a clinically plausible time sequence between the onset of the AE and 
the application of investigational product; the AE is unlikely to be caused by [CONTACT_78654]/underlying illness, other drugs or procedures. 
 Possible:  There may or may not be a clinically plausible time sequence between the 
onset of the AE and the application of investigational product and a cause cannot be ruled 
out. 
Protocol NI- AC303  Version 1.0 
Nova
n, Inc.   09 November 2015 
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.  34  Unlikely:  There is no reasonable temporal association between the test material and the 
suspected event and the event could have been produced by [CONTACT_423]'s clinical state or 
other modes of therapy administered to the Subject. 
 Unr elated:  This term should be reserved for those events that cannot be even remotely 
re
lated to study participation. 
6.[ADDRESS_612290] signs the 
informed consent/assent to the end of subject’s last visit. 
The Investigator will assess subjects at each scheduled study visit for the occurrence of AEs. In 
order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects should be asked the following non-leading question:  
“How have you felt since your last visit? ” All AEs (serious and non-serious) reported by [CONTACT_176277]’s study record and entered into the study database. 
In addition, Chiltern must be notified within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event 
by [CONTACT_477389]. Special attention should be paid to recording hospi[INVESTIGATOR_176254]. 
6.3 IMMEDIATELY REPORTABLE EVENTS 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) are considered immediately reportable events. Any SAE, whether 
de
emed drug-related or not, must be reported to Chiltern telephone, fax, or email as soon as 
possible after the Investigator or coordinator has become aware of its occurrence. The 
Investigator/coordinator must complete a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Form and email it to

7.[ADDRESS_612300]  
Upon receipt from Novan, or Novan’s designee, a study staff member will place all study supplies 
in a temperature-controlled area. The pumps should be refrigerated (2-8 °C). Access to study 
supplies should be strictly limited to the study staff. Neither the Investigator nor any member of 
the study staff will distribute any of the study supplies to any person not participating in this study. 
If a study staff member becomes aware that the study supplies have not been properly handled 
(i.e., supply arrives and was not placed in refrigerator upon receipt), the Chiltern CRA or designee 
must be contact[CONTACT_15608]. In such an event, study supplies should be quarantined and not be 
administered to any subject until Novan provides further direction. 
The investigational product will be dispensed at the discretion and by [CONTACT_321970]. It is the Investigator’s 
Protocol NI- AC303  Version 1.[ADDRESS_612301] once each working day. Excursions in 
temperature during storage should be discussed with the Chiltern CRA or designee immediately 
and study supplies should be quarantined and not administered until Novan provides approval for 
use. Other supplies will be stored at room temperature.

Investigator’s permanent study file. These records must be available for inspection by [CONTACT_477395], their designees, or regulatory agencies at any time. 
8.[ADDRESS_612303] and a study database will be 
maintained for all enrolled study subjects. Screen failures will not be entered in the electronic data 
c
apture (EDC) system. 
Novan requires that the study database be verifiable with the subject’s source study record. This 
requirement necessitates access to all original recordings and other records for each subject. The 
Investigator must therefore agree to allow access to subjects’ records, and source data must be 
made available for all study data. Subjects (or their legal representatives) must also allow access 
to the subject’s medical records. Subjects will be informed of the importance of increased record 
access and permission granted by [CONTACT_477396]. 
Before the study database is formally submitted to Novan, the study monitor, Chiltern Medical 
Monitor or Novan staff may request copi[INVESTIGATOR_9238]’s source study record for preliminary 
medical review. 
The Investigator must keep written or electronic source documents for every subject participating 
in the clinical study. These records must includ e:

generated and are complete. 
9.2 F ILE MANAGEMENT AT THE STUDY SITE 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that the study center file is maintained in 
accordance with Section 8 – Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial of the ICH 
Guidance for Industry E6 Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance and [ADDRESS_612305]: 
 C ountry-specific requirements; or 
 A period of at least two years following the last approval of a marketing application 
approved by a Regulatory Authority in an ICH region or until there are no pending or 
contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region; or, 
 A period of two years after Novan notifies the Investigator that the data will not be 
submitted for review by [CONTACT_34699]. 
The Investigator must not dispose of any records or essential documents relevant to this study 
without either (1) written permission from Novan, or (2) providing an opportunity for Novan to 
collect such records. The Investigator shall take responsibility for maintaining adequate and 
accurate electronic or hard copy source documents of all observations and data generated during 
this study. Such documentation is subject to inspection by [CONTACT_477397]- AC303  Version 1.0 
Nova
n, Inc.   09 November 2015 
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.  43 regulatory agencies. If the Investigator withdraws from the study (e.g., relocation, retirement), all 
study-related records should be transferred to a mutually agreed-upon designee. Notice of such 
transfer will be provided to Novan in writing. 
10. M ONITORING, COMPLIANCE, AND QUALITY 
All aspects of the study will be monitored by [CONTACT_477398] (SOPs) for compliance with applicable government regulations, 
(i.e., informed consent regulations, (21 C.F.R. § 50.20, 1999), and Institutional Review Board 
regulations, (21 C.F.R. § 56.103, 1981)). Access to all records, both during the trial and after trial 
completion, should be made available to Chiltern at any time for review and audit to ensure the 
integrity of the data. The Investigator must notify Chiltern immediately if the responsible IRB has 
been disqualified or if proceedings leading to disqualification have begun. 
The Investigator must conduct the protocol in accordance with applicable GCP regulations and 
guidelines, applicable informed consent regulations (21 C.F.R. § 50.20, 1999), and in compliance 
with the principles in the Declaration of Helsinki. Every attempt must be made to follow the 
protocol and to obtain and record all data requested for each subject at the specified times. If data 
is not recorded per protocol, the reason(s) must be clearly documented on the study records. 
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at a meeting with the Investigator(s), a Novan or 
C
hiltern representative will review the protocol and study records with the Investigator(s) and their 
staff. During the study, the Chiltern study monitor will visit the site regularly to check the 
completeness of subject records, the accuracy of entries into the study database, the adherence to 
the protocol and to GCP, the progress of enrollment, to ensure that consent is being sought and 
obtained in compliance with applicable regulations, and that the investigational product is being 
stored, dispensed and accounted for according to specifications. The Investigator and key trial 
personnel must be available to assist the monitor during these visits. 
The Investigator must give the monitor access to relevant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_176256]. No information in these records about the identity 
of the subjects will leave the study center. Monitoring standards require full verification for the 
presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of 
SAEs and the recording of safety variables. A reduced source data verification model will be 
deployed for this study in order to focus on the critical data for analysis and this will be executed 
per the study specific monitoring plan. Additional checks of the consistency of the study records 
with the study database will be performed according to the study-specific monitoring plan. 
The Investigator or designee must promptly enter the data into the study database after the subject’s 
visit. The monitor is responsible for reviewing them and clarifying and resolving any data queries. 
A copy of the study records will be retained by [CONTACT_477399]- AC303  Version 1.[ADDRESS_612306] with other study documents, such as the protocol, the Investigator’s Brochure and 
any protocol amendments. 
The Investigator must provide Chiltern and the responsible IRB with a study summary shortly after 
study completion.

investigational product, original, study-relevant medical records). All subject data will be treated 
confidentially.  
11. E THICS AND RESPONSIBILITY 
This study must be conducted in compliance with the protocol, the ICH Guidance for Industry E6 
Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance and the applicable regulatory requirements. The 
Investigator must submit all essential regulatory documentation, as required by [CONTACT_99114] (including approval of the protocol and informed consent/assent form by [CONTACT_2717]) to 
Chiltern before investigational product will be shipped to the study site. The Investigator will 
review the final study results to confirm that to the best of his knowledge, it accurately describes 
the conduct and results of the study.  
12. CONF IDENTIALITY 
All information generated in this study must be considered highly confidential and must not be 
disclosed to any persons not directly concerned with the study without written prior permission 
from Novan. Authorized regulatory officials, Novan and Chiltern personnel (or their 
representatives) will be allowed full access to inspect and copy the records. All study 
investigational products, subject bodily fluids, and/or other materials collected shall be used solely 
in accordance with this protocol, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by [CONTACT_99083].

Only Novan may modify the protocol. Amendments may be approved by [CONTACT_176294], but not limited to, the government regulatory authorities and/or 
regional IRB before implementation. The only exception is when an Investigator considers that a 
subject may be harmed and immediate action is necessary. Under these circumstances, approval 
of the chairman of the IRB, or an authorized designee must be sought immediately. The 
Investigator should inform Chiltern and the full IRB no later than five working days after the 
emergency occurs. Protocol-specified safety reporting requirements must be adhered to 
independent of any other variables. All amendments that have an impact on subject risk, the study 
objectives or that require revision of the informed consent document must be approved by [CONTACT_176295]. Administrative changes to the protocol and/or changes that do not impact 
subject safety, risk or comfort may be implemented prior to IRB approval if local institutional 
policy permits. A copy of the written approval of the IRB, which becomes part of the essential 
study documents file, must be given to the study monitor. Examples of amendments requiring such 
approval are: 
 A sig nificant change in the study design 
 An increase in the number of invasive procedures to which subjects are exposed 
 An addition or deletion of a test procedure

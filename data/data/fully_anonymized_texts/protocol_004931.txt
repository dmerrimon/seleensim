anticoagulants  (DOACs)  like (Dabigatran/Rivaroxaban/Api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]/Edoxaban)  .Factor  Xa is a 
primary  target  since  this factor  plays  a pi[INVESTIGATOR_592296].  Inhibition of  FXa  is expected  to 
exert  anticoagulant  and antithrombotic  effects  by [CONTACT_592318], thereby  [CONTACT_592319]- mediated  activation  of the coagulation process, 
including  fibrin  formation  and platelet  activation  [1].  DOAC  helps  to anticoagulated  and 
potentially  decrease the  risk of systemic  thromboembolism  .  
Overall  Risk/Benefit  Assessment  
Atrial fibrillation  (AF)  is associated  with  5 times  increased  risk of cerebrovascular  events  
compare to  patients  in Sinus  rhythm  [2]. Even  in patients  undergoing  Radiofrequency  Ablation  
(RFA)  for atrial  fibrillation,  the incidence of  symptomatic  cerebrovascular  events  (CVE) was  
2.3%  and 41%  of those  are from  transient  ischemic attacks  and 25%  are from  ischemic  CVEs,  
despi[INVESTIGATOR_592297]. The  incidence of  asymptomatic  CVEs  rises  to 14%  after  the 
ablation  for AF,  detected  by [CONTACT_592320]  . Multiple  trials  have  shown that  the 
asymptomatic  CVEs  and/or  micro  infarcts  can increase the  odds  of having  dementia.  The 
incidence of  stroke  immediately  after ablation  for l eft ventricular  arrhythmias  has ranged  from  0 
to 2.7%  to 7.5%  depending  on the  case series  , but  there aren ’t many  studies  to quantify  this 
problem  clearly.  Interestingly,  the amount  of tissue  ablated  in the ventricles  is not any smaller  
than what  is done  in the left atrium.  Even  though the  stunning  phenomenon  that is seen  with  the 
left atrial  appendage  may  not be relevant  to the ventricular  tach ycardia  ablation, the  extensive 
endothelial  denudation and subclinical  thrombus  formation  at the sites  of ablation  is clearly  
under  appreciated.  No active  strategies  to prevent  post  ablation  systemic  thromboembolization  
are available in  patients  undergoing  left ventricular  arrhythmia  ablation  especially  on the  left 
side.  Similar  to AF, the projected  incidence of  asymptomatic  CVEs  may  be much  higher  than  
the incidence of  symptomatic  CVEs  given  the multiple  reasons  like heat  generated  from  the 
 
  
[ADDRESS_781301]  ablation  anticoagulation  with  warfarin  is fraught  with  several  
practical  issues including the  time  to therapeutic range  and the need  for bridging  with  
unfractionated  or low molecular  weight  heparin  with  implications  to prolonged length  of stay 
and increased  bleeding  complications. So, the  novel  non VKA agents  probably  are a  better  fit for 
this specific situation.  Early  experience with  all four currently  available agents  (Dabigatran,  
Rivaroxaban  , Api[INVESTIGATOR_592298])  for periprocedural  anticoagulation  seems  to be safe and  
efficacious.   DOAC  is a direct  oral inhibitor  of Prothrombin/ factor  Xa inhibitor  and thereby  
[CONTACT_592321]  . In the recently  published double  blind rand omized  clinical  
trial  DOAC  was found to  be superior  to warfarin  in decreasing  the risk of stroke  and also had 
fewer  complications  of bleeding  and death  in patients  with  atrial  fibrillation/flutter  . 
 
We believe that  peri-procedural   DOAC  use for left ventricular  arrhythmia  ablation  will provide  
effective anticoagulation without  increasing  bleeding  complications  and may decrease the  
incidence of  both symptomatic  and asymptomatic  cerebrovascular  events,  TIAs  and strokes.  
 Magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI)  is the most  commonly  used  imaging  test to detect  acute 
ischemic  stroke  and asymptomatic  CVEs.  There is a natural  appr ehension about  the use of MRI  
scanning  in patient  with  Cardiac Implantable  Electrical  Devices  (CIEDs)  . However,  there are 
protocols  in place showing  MRI  examination  of patients  with  CIEDs  with  minimal or  no side  
 
  
[ADDRESS_781302] left ventricular  arrhythmia  ablation  MRI  scanning  of the brain  can be safe and  help  us 
examine an  important  issue  that has not been  well  defined.  
Research  Hypothesis   
We hypothesize  that periprocedural  anticoagulation  with   DOAC  (an oral anticoagulation agent  
with rapid  onset  of action)  for left  ventricular  arrhythmia  ablation  decreases  symptomatic  and 
asymptomatic  cerebrovascular  events  compared  to use of Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_592299].   
Study  Rationale  
Ventricular  tachycardia (VT)  is a complex  arrhythmia  with  high  mortality  rate.  ICDs  have shown 
improvement  in survival  when  placed  for primary  or secondary  prevention in  such  patients,  but 
they are not  a cure for VT  and they don’ t prevent  recurrences.  In addition, painful  ICD shocks, 
not only  impair  quality  of life and psychological  health  , but  they  are also associated  with  
increased  all-cause mortality.  Antiarrhythmic  therapy,  even  though moderately  effective,  with  
time and progressive  remodeling  recurrent  VT and subsequent  ICD therapi[INVESTIGATOR_592300]. 
Radiofrequency  catheter  ablation  has emerged  as an important  therapeutic option to  prevent  VT 
recurrences  and reduce  the frequency  of ICD shocks  . Catheter  ablation  provides  potential  
curative treatment  in 77-95% of post  MI patients  presenting  with  monomorphic  VT and around 
60% in patients  with  VT arising  from  non- ischemic cardiomyopathy  . With  advancement  in 
technology  and newer  saline irrigation  catheters,  the risks  are very  minima l, with  high  success  
rates  . In a nationwide  sample  of [ADDRESS_781303]  to quantify  . Both  retrograde  transaortic  approach  and trans -septal  
approach  are possible  routes for endocardial  radiofrequency  ablation  (RFA) with  embolic  risk 
associated  with  thrombus  formation  on the  ablation  catheters  and sheaths,  micro  thrombus  
 
  
6 
 formation  at the ablation  site during  the procedure and after  ablation  as well.  [3].Over  the last 
decade left  ventricular  arrhythmia  ablation  techniques  have  evolved  from  being  more  focal  
targeted sites  to the addition of  extensive substrate  modification  targeting  active  channels  as 
represented  by [CONTACT_592322],  late activation  potentials  etc. in the scar and scar border.  
This will change  the surface area of  the ventricular  endocardium  ablated  significantly.  The 
extensive denudation of  the ventricular  endocardium  can obviously  become  a site of thrombus  
formation  and subsequent  embolization.  Often  times  patients  with  Cardiomyopathy  (CM) 
undergoing  left ventricular  arrhythmia  ablation  have  poor  LV function and  have  large segments  
of akinesis/dyskinesis/aneurysms  making  them  more  prone  for stasis and  thrombus  formation. 
Treating  them  with  periprocedural  anticoagulation  has a potential  to significantly  decrease the  
risk of systemic  thromboembolization  as measured  by [CONTACT_592323].

INVESTIGATIONAL  PLAN  
Study  Design  and Duration  
This is a multicenter,  randomized, prospective  study  to determine,  if  DOAC  can be used  
periprocedural  in patients  undergoing  a scar left ventricular  arrhythmia  ablation. Patients  will be  
screened  from  both the  clinic  setting  and upcoming  EP lab schedule.  The patient ’s chart  will be  
reviewed  and those  that meet  inclusion/exclusion will be  approached  for the  study.  For this 
study,  we intend to  enroll  [ADDRESS_781307]  any exclusion  criteria.  Patients  will be  randomized  in a 1:1 fashion. 
  
 Figure  1 shows  the use of ASA or   DOAC  for left  ventricular  arrhythmia  ablation.  
 
Patients  undergoing  left ventricular  arrhythmia  ablation  will be  consented  and randomized to  
either  ASA 81 mg  or 100 mg daily  or  DOAC  twice  daily.  Patients  randomized to  ASA will 
continue  or start  ASA 81  mg or 100 mg  by [CONTACT_34048],  and continue  up to  30 days  after the 
procedure. Patients  randomized  to  DOAC  group will stop the  ASA if  they  are currently  taking  
it;  DOAC  [ADDRESS_781308]  completed  the study  and can stop either   DOAC  and/or  Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_592303] ’s discretion.

Ablation  Protocol  
A standard  left ventricular  arrhythmia  ablation  protocol  that is approved at  the participat ing 
institution  and which  is in place will be  followed. Endocardial  ablation, access  to the left 
ventricle  is gain via trans -septal  approach  which  is preferred  access  or via retrograde transaortic  
approach. When  deemed  necessary  by [CONTACT_592326][INVESTIGATOR_592307]. Left ventricular  arrhythmia  ablation  is performed  targeting  the clinical  
VT. A voltage  map  is created  to assess the  scar and scar border.  If the VT is hemodynamically  
 
  
[ADDRESS_781313]  
< 200 seconds  and no further  need  for manual  or artificial compression.  
 
Cerebral  MRI  (as adopted from  ) 
Study  subjects  will be  screened  for new  asymptomatic  CVEs,  within  [ADDRESS_781314].  This  will help  reduce the  patient  exposure  to repeated  testing.   
The imaging  protocol  includes  a sagittal T1 -weighted  spin echo  sequence to  obtain a  better  
definition  of the anterior  and posterior  cerebral  commissures.  The parameters  of the T1-weighted  
spin echo  sequ ence were as follows:  repetition  time/echo  time  400/13;  slice  thickness  5 mm; 
distant  factor  0%; field  of view  230 mm; matrix  192×256; and acquisition  time  59 seconds. An  
axial  fluid -attenuated  inversion recovery  (FLAIR)  sequence was then  used.  The paramet ers of 
the FLAIR  sequence were  as follows:  repetition  time/echo  time  8500/112;  TI 2500 ms;  slice  
thickness  5 mm; distant  factor  30%;  field  of view  240 mm; matrix  154× 256; and acquisition  time  
3.24 seconds. A  diffusion -weighted  (DW) sequence,  with  the use of a single -shot spin echo  with  
echo -planar  imaging  technique  that combined the  motion -probing  gradient  before  and after  the 
180° pulse  with  echo -planar  imaging  readout, was  obtained;  The parameters  of the DW  sequence  
were as follows:  repetition  time/echo  time 3200/99;  slice  thickness  5 mm; distant  factor  30%;  
field of view  230 mm; matrix  128× 128; bandwidth 1502 Hz;  gradient  strength  22 mT;  duration 
of diffusion gradients  31 ms; gradient  separation  42 ms  in 3 orthogonal  directions;  and

detected  by [CONTACT_592327] (DWI)  with  or without  addition of  delayed  Fluid -
attenuated  inversion recovery  (FLAIR)  positive  sequence.  The size and localization  of the focal  
lesions  will be  analyzed  certified  by [CONTACT_592328].  
 
Subjects  who  have  the Cardiac electrical  implantable  devices  who  are undergoing  MRI  
examination  will follow  standard  protocol  which  are in  place in  the institution .  
 
Neurology Evaluations  
Patients  will undergo a  NIHSS  and EQ5D prior  to procedure  (within  24 hours)  and post  (12-48 
hours). If changes  in the NIHSS  score of  greater  than  [ADDRESS_781316] scan  for which  no

Women  of Childbearing Potential  
Women  of childbearing  potential  (WOCBP)  is defined  as any female who  has experienced  
menarche and  who  has not undergone  surgical  sterilization  (hysterectomy  or bilateral  
oophorectomy)  and is not postmenopausal. Menopause  is defined  as [ADDRESS_781320]  a serum  follicle  stimulating  hormone, 
(FSH)  level  > 40mIU/mL  to confirm  menopause.  
*Females  treated  with hormone  replacement  therapy,  (HRT)  are likely  to have artif icially  
suppressed FSH  levels  and may  require  a washout  period in  order  to obtain a  physiologic  FSH 
level.  The duration of  the washout  period is  a function of  the type  of HRT  used.  The duration of  
the washout  period below  are suggested  guidelines  and the investigators  should use  their  
judgment  in checking  serum  FSH  levels.  If the serum  FSH  level  is >40 mIU/ml at  any time  
during  the washout  period, the  woman  can be considered  postmenopausal:  
• 1 week  minimum for vaginal  hormonal  products  (rings,  creams,  gels)  
• 4 week  minimum for transdermal  products  
• [ADDRESS_781321]  (and  non- invest igational  product  at the 
discretion  of the investigator)  for any of the following  reasons:  
• Withdrawal  of informed  consent  (subject ’s decision  to withdraw  for any reason).  
• Any clinical  adverse  event,  laboratory  abnormality,  or inter -current  illness  which, i n the

− Instruct  WOCBP  to contact  [CONTACT_592331]  (eg, missed  or late menstrual  period)  at any time  during  study  
participation.  Institutional policy  and local  regulations  should determine  the 
frequency  of on-study  pregnancy  tests  for WOCBP  enrolled  in the study.  
− The investigator  must  immediately  notify  BMS  if a study  subject  becomes  pregnant.  
• Loss  of ability  to freely  provide  consent  through imprisonment  or involuntary  
incarceration  for treatment of  either  a psychiatric or physical  (eg, infectious  disease)  
illness.  
All subjects  who  discontinue  should comply  with  protocol -specified  follow -up procedures  
outlined above. The  only  exception  to this requirement  is when  a subject  withdraws  consent  for 
all study  procedures  or loses  the ability  to consent  freely  (ie, is imprisoned or  involuntarily  
incarcerated  for the  treatment  of either  a psychiatric  or physical  illness).  If a subject  withdraws  
before  completing  the study,  the reason  for withdrawal  must  be documented appropriately.  
TREATMENTS  
Study  Treatment:  DOAC or  Warfarin   
Definition  of Investigational  Product:  A pharmaceutical  form  of an active  substance  or placebo  
being  tested  or used  as a reference  in a clinical study,  including  products  already  with  a 
marketing  authorization but  used  or assembled  (formulated  or packaged)  in a way  different  from  
 
  
[ADDRESS_781322]:  Other  medications  used  in the study  as support  or 
escape medication  for preventative,  diagnostic, or  therapeutic reasons  as components  of a given  
standard  of care.  In this protocol, the  non- investigational  products  are none . 
Method  of Assigning  Subjects  to a Treatment  
All subjects  who  have  signe d the  study  ICF and meet  all inclusion and  no exclusion  criteria  will 
be randomized in  a 1:1 into  one of the two study  arms  (1) Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]  81 mg  or 100 mg  or (2)  
DOAC  recommended  dose . For  study  purposes, subjects  are considered  enrolled  in the study  
once  they have signed  the consent  form  and are randomized and  stratified  by [CONTACT_592332].  
Selection  and Timing  of Dose  for Each  Subject  
 DOAC  should not  be used  if a patient  has an allergy  or has had active pathological  bleeding  
where the  use of the agent  is contraindicated.  Similarly,  patients  who  are allergic and  
contraindicated  to ASA should not  use ASA.  
If a dose  of  DOAC  is not taken  at the scheduled  time,  the dose  should be  taken  as soon as  
possible  on the  same day  and then  continue  with  twice daily  administration  as before.    The  dose  
should not  be doubled to  make up for a missed  dose.  DOAC  can be taken  with or without  food. 
 DOAC  is not recommended  in patients  with  severe hepatic impairment.  These patients  will not  
meet  the inclusion/exclusion criteria.   
Dose  Modifications  
Dose  modification  per investigator  recommendations  and per current  guidelines . 
Concomitant  Treatm ents 
Prohibited  and/or  Restricted  Treatments  
Co-administration  of the maintenance dose  of  DOAC  is not recommended  with drugs  that 
increase the  risk of bleeding  (eg, other  anticoagulants,  heparin, thrombolytic  agents,  NSAIDs,  
SSRIs,  serotonin norepi[INVESTIGATOR_592310]).  
 
  
[ADDRESS_781323]  the 
urgency  of intervention.  
Use  DOAC  with  caution  when  co-administered  with  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  
(NSAIDs),  including  ASA.  
Treatment  Compliance  
Patient  compliance will be  reported  by [CONTACT_592333].  
The  DOAC  bottle  will be  returned  to the study  coordinator  at their  1 month follow  up visit.

ADVERSE  EVENTS  
An Adverse  Event  [AE]  is defined  as any new  untoward medical  occurrence or  worsening  of a 
pre-existing  medical  condition in  a patient  or clinical  investigation  subject  administered  an 
investigational (medicinal)  product  and that does  not necessarily  have a  causal  relationship  with  
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be  any unfavorable  and unintended sign  (including  an 
abnormal  laboratory  finding, for example),  symptom, or  disease temporally  associated  with  the 
use of investigational  product, whether  or not considered  related  to the investigational product.  
The causal  relationship  to study  drug  is determined  by a physician  and should  be used  to assess 
all adverse events  (AEs).  The causal  relationship  can be one of the followi ng: 
• Related:  There is  a reasonable causal  relationship  between  study  drug  administration  and 
the AE. 
• Not Related:  There is  not a reasonable causal  relationship  between  study  drug  
administration  and the AE. 
The term  “reasonable causal  relationship ” means  there is  evidence to  suggest  a causal  
relationship.  
Adverse  events  can be spontaneously  reported  or elicited  during  open -ended  questioning, 
examination,  or evalu ation  of a subject.  (In order  to prevent  reporting  bias,  subjects  should not  be 
questioned regarding  the specific occurrence  of one or more  adverse events).   
Serious  Adverse Events  
Serious  Adverse Event  (SAE) is  any untoward medical  occurrence at  any dose that:  
• results  in death  
 
  
26 
 • is life-threatening  (defined  as an event  in which  the subject  was at risk of death  at the time  
of the event;  it does  not refer  to an event  which  hypothetically  might  have  caused  death  if 
it were more  severe)  
• requires  inpatient  hospi [INVESTIGATOR_592312]  (see 
NOTE *: below  for exceptions)  
• results  in persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity  
• is a congenital  anomaly/birth defect  
• is an important  medical  event, defined  as a medical event  that may not be immediately  
life-threatening  or result  in death  or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_536891], based  on appropriate  medical  and 
scientific  judgment, may  jeopardize  the subject  or may require  intervention (e.g.,  medical,  
surgical)  to prevent  one of the other  serious  outcomes  listed  above. Examples  of such  
events  include  but are not  limited  to intensive  treatment in  an emergency  department  or at 
home  for allergic bronchospasm;  blood dyscrasias  or convulsions  that do not  result  in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].   
• Potential drug -induced liver  injury  (DILI)  is also considered  an important  medical  event --
see the  DILI  section  below  for a  definition  of a potential DILI  event.  
• Suspected  transmission  of an infectious  agent  (eg, pathogenic  or non- pathogenic)  via the 
study  drug  is an SAE.   
• Although  pregnancy, overdose, and  cancer  are not always  serious  by [CONTACT_52252],  
these events  must  be handled  as SAEs.  
*NOTE:  The following  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_592313]:   
• A visit to  the emergency  room  or other  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_592314]  24 hours  that 
does not result  in admission  (unless  considered  an “important  medical  event ” or a life-
threatening  event)  
• Elective  surgery  planned before  signing consent  
• Admissions  as per protocol  for a  planned medical/surgical  procedure  
• Routine  health assessment  requiring  admission  for baseline/trending  of health  status  (eg, 
routine  colonoscopy)  
• Medical/surgical  admission other  than  remedying  ill health  state  that was planned before  
study  entry.  Appropriate  documentation is  required  in these cases  
• Admission  encountered  for another  life circumstance that  carries  no bearing  on health  
status  and requires  no medical/surgical  intervention  (eg, lack  of housing, economic  
inadequacy, caregiver  respi[INVESTIGATOR_040],  family  circumstances,  administrative  reason)  
• In this study, the following  adverse  events  are to be reported  to BMS,  regardless  of whether  
these reports  are classified  as serious  or unexpected:  
 
  
[ADDRESS_781329]’s  written  consent  to participate in  the study,  all SAEs,  whether  related  or 
not related  to study  drug, must  be collected,  including  those  thought  to be associated  with  
protocol -specified  procedures. All  SAEs  must  be collected  that occur  during  the screening  period  
and within  [ADDRESS_781330]  be collected  that relate to  
any later  protocol -specific procedure  (such  as follow -up skin biopsy).  
The investigator  should report  any SAE  occurring  after these time  periods  that is believed  to be 
related  to study  drug  or protocol -specified  procedure.  
An SAE  report  should be  completed  for any event  where doubt  exists  regarding  its status  of 
seriousness.  
If the investigator  believes  that an SAE  is not related  to study  drug,  but is potentially  related  to 
the conditions  of the study  (such  as withdrawal  of previous  therapy,  or a complication  of a study  
procedure), the  relationship  should be  specif ied in the narrative section  of the SAE  Report  Form.  
SAEs,  whether  related  or unrelated  to the study  drug, and  pregnancies  must  be reported  to BMS  
within  [ADDRESS_781331]  be recorded  on the  SAE  Report  Form;  Pregnancies  on a  Pregnancy  
Surveillance Form.  
SAE  Email  Address:  [EMAIL_11282]  
SAE  Fax Number:  [PHONE_12278] 
If only  limited  information is  initially  available,  follow -up reports  are required.  (Note:  Follow -up 
SAE  reports  should include  the same investigator  term(s) initially  reported.)   
All SA Es should be  followed to  resolution or  stabilization.  
SAE Reconciliation  
The investigator  will reconcile the  clinical  database SAE  cases  transmitted  to the study  team . The  
DSMB  and study  steering  committee  will adjudicate the adverse events  in the event  of 
disagreement.  
 
  
28 
 Non-Serious  Events  
A non- serious  adverse event  is an AE not classified  as serious.  
Non-Serious  Adverse Events  (NSAEs)  Collecting  and Reporting  
The collection  of non- serious  adverse event  (NSAE) information  should begin  at initiation  of 
study  drug.  Non -serious  adverse event  information should also  be collected  from  the start  of a 
placebo  lead -in period or  other  observational  period  intended to  establish  a baseline status  for the  
subjects.   
Non-serious  AEs  should be followed to  resolution  or stabilization,  or reported  as SAEs  if they  
become serious. Follow -up is  also required  for non- serious  AEs  that cause interruption or  
discontinuation of  study  drug, or those  that are present  at the end of study  treatment  as 
appropriate.  
Laboratory Test  Abnormalities  
The following  laboratory  abnormalities  should be  captured  and reported  as appropriate:  
• Any laboratory  test result  that is clinically  significant  or meets the definition  of an SAE  
• Any laboratory  test result  abnormality  that required  the subject  to have  study  drug 
discontinued or  interrupted 
• Any laboratory  test result  abnormality  that required  the subject  to receive specific 
corrective therapy.   
It is expected  that wherever  possible, the  clinical  rather  than  the laboratory  term  will be  used  by 
[CONTACT_486102]  (eg, use the term  anemia  rather  than  low hemoglobin  value).   
Laboratory  test abnormalities  are provided to  BMS  via annual  safety  reports  (if applicable),  and 
interim or  final  study  reports.  
 
Pregnancy  
If, following  initiation  of the investigational product, it is  subsequently  discovered that  a study  
subject  is pregnant  or may  have been  pregnant  at the time  of investigational  product  exposur e, 
including  during  at least  [ADDRESS_781332]  will 
 
  
29 
 be permanently  discontinued in  an appropriate  manner  (eg, dose  tapering  if necessary  for subject  
safety).   
The investigator  must  immediately  notify  Wor [EMAIL_11283]  of this event  via the 
Pregnancy  Surveillance Form  within  [ADDRESS_781333]  unless  contraindicated  by [CONTACT_8663]  (eg, x-ray studies). Other  appropriate  pregnancy  
follow -up procedures  should be  considered  if indicated.  
Overdose  
An overdose  is defined as  the accidental  or intentional  administration  of any dose of a product  
that is considered  both excessive and  medically  important.  All occurrences  of overdose  must  be 
reported  as SAEs.  
Potential  Drug -Induced Liver Injury  (DILI)  
Wherever  possible, timely  confirmation  of initial liver -related  laboratory  abnormalities  should 
occur  prior  to the reporting  of a potential  DILI  event.  All occurrences  of potential DILIs,  
meeting  the defined  criteria,  must  be reported  as SAEs.  
Poten tial drug  induced liver  injury  is defined  as  
1. AT (ALT  or AST)  elevation  > 3 times  upper  limit of  normal  (ULN)  
AND  
2. Total  bilirubin  > [ADDRESS_781334],  without  initial findings  of cholestasis  (elevated  serum  
alkaline  phosphatase),  
AND  
 
  
30 
 3. No other  immediately  apparen t possible  causes  of AT elevation  and hyperbilirubinemia,  
including, but  not limited  to, viral  hepatitis,  pre-existing  chronic  or acute liver  disease,  or 
the administration  of other  drug(s) known to  be hepatotoxic.  
Other Safety  Considerations  
Any significa nt worsening  noted during  interim or  final  physical  examinations,  
electrocardiograms,  x-rays,  and any other  potential  safety  assessments,  whether  or not these 
procedures  are required  by [CONTACT_760], should also  be recorded  as a non- serious  or serious  
adve rse event,  as appropriate, and  reported  accordingly.  
DATA MONITORING  COMMITTEE  
To meet  the study ’s ethical  responsibility  to its subjects,  an independent  data  safety  monitoring  
Board  (DSMB)  will monitor  results  during  the study.  The board  consists  of [ADDRESS_781335] 50 patients  and then  at the completion  of 
the study.   
If the major  bleeding  events  in the  DOAC  group occur  at >15%  but <30%  (absolute  event  rate)  
of those  in the ASA group during  any of the assessments,  a recommendation  will be  made to  
consider  modifying  the study  by [CONTACT_592335].  First  consideration to  modify  is to 
decrease the  dose  of the drug to 2.5mg  PO twice  daily.  If the major  bleeding  events  in the  
DOAC  group occur  at >30%  (absolute  event  rate)  of those  in the ASA group during  any of the 
assessments,  a recommendation will be  made to  stop the  study  by [CONTACT_592335].  
STATI STICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
Study  Management  and Sample  Size  Justification  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_592315] [ADDRESS_781336].  We hypothesize  a 30%  difference  in outcomes  can be seen  with  
a total sample  size of [ADDRESS_781337]  manager  (PM) with the help  of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_592316].  The sites  will complete  the paper  CRF  and submit  via secure email  to the project  
manager.  The PM will assist  the Database Manager  (DM) with  updating  the access  database and  
providing  computer  support  for outside  centers.  All data will be  submitted  via secure email  
including  de-identified  patient  data that  is to be used  as source.  
Participant’s  data will be  de-identified  and a code will be  assigned.  The code will consist  of Site 
Number, Patient  Number  and Patien t Initials.   The  coordinator  at that site will have  access  to the 
code;  the linking  list will be  destroyed  at the completion of  the project.   
Statistical  analysis:  Patients  will be  randomized in  a stratified  manner  to control  arm versus  
treatment  arm.  We will analyze  the differences  in secondary  endpoints  between  the two groups  
for major,  minor  bleeding  and cardiovascular  mortality  up to  [ADDRESS_781338]  ablation. Categorical  
variables  will be  reported  as counts  and percentages  and continuous  variables  will be  expressed  
as mean  ± SD. Continuous  variables  will be  compared  using  t-test for normally  distributed  data 
or Mann  Whitney  U test for non- normally  distributed  data as  deemed  appropriate.  Categorical  
events  will be  compared  using  chi-square test  for parametr ic data.  
Univariate  and multi- variate  analysis  will be  performed  to identify  the predictors  of systemic  
thromboembolic  events  and mortality.  This  is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_592317].   A larger  study  will be  done  in the future  if there is  a positive  signal.  
Compliance  with  the Protocol  
The study  shall  be conducted  as described  in this approved protocol. All  revisions  to the protocol  
must  be discussed  with,  and be prepared  by [CONTACT_2362] .

[ADDRESS_781342]  Cardiac  implantable  devices  and who  are undergoing  
brain  MRI  examination  (as adopted from  [2]) 
General:  
1. MRI  scans  will be  performed  in a 1.5 T  scanner.  
2. Subjects  will undergo interrogation  of the device  (CIED)  before and  after  the scan  by 
[CONTACT_592338], outside  the MRI  room.  
3. Patient  height  and weight  will be  recorded  to determine  the specific  absorption rate (SAR) 
levels  not to exceed  the manufacturer ’s pre-specified  limits,  if in case,  the parameters,  
repetition  times,  number  of slices  and angle  will be  changed  accordingly.  
4. A crash  cart and ACLS  trained  health  care professional  will be  available  during  the entire  
procedure.  
5. Blood pressure,  pulse  oximetry  and cardiac rhythm  will be  monitored. If any signs  of 
hemodynamic  instability  (BP<90/60, HR<40)  or ventricular  fibrillation  the procedur e will be  
stopped and  patient  will be  managed  as per the ACLS  protocol.  
Device (CIED)  interrogation  and monitoring:  
1. Device interrogation  will include  measurements  of battery  voltage, P - and R-wave 
amplitudes  (if present),  and lead  impedance  and pacing  threshold for all leads.  
2. Pacing  threshold measurements  will be  performed  at 10 beats/min  above  the programmed 
pacing  rate (if pacemaker  dependent)  or, 10 beats/min  above  the patient's  intrinsic  rate.  The 
pacing  rate for testing  can be increased  by [CONTACT_592339] 10 beats/min,  if there is  insufficient  
suppression of  the patient's  underlying  rhythm.  
3. The  pacing  rate will gradually  be decreased  to 40 beats/min,  if the patient  has an intrinsic  
rhythm  of greater  than  40 beats/min,  the device will  be programme d to pacing  and sensing  
functions  disabled  (ODO)  [Chamber  paced -none;  Chamber  sensed --atria  and ventricle;  Mode  
of response  –none]  or OVO [Chamber  paced -none;  Chamber  sensed -ventricle;  Mode  of 
response -none]). The  patient  will then  be observed for 5 minute s before  the scan.  If 
symptoms  are noted, the  pacing  function will be  reprogrammed  to an asynchronous  pacing  
mode  (DOO)  [asynchronous  pacing  mode  using  both atrial  and ventricular  leads]  or (VOO)  
[asynchronous  pacing  mode  using  only  the ventricular  lead].  If the patient  has a device  that 
does not allow  permanent  reprogramming  to an ODO or  OVO mode,  the patient  will be

 reprogrammed  to an asynchronous  mode  (DOO  or VOO),  and the pacing  output  for all  active 
leads  and pulse  width  will be set to a minimum value.  If there is  no intrinsic  rhythm  when  the 
device is  reprogrammed  to 40 beats/min,  the patient  will be  considered  pacemaker  
dependent, and  the device  will be  programmed  to an asynchronous  pacing  mode  (DOO or  
VOO).  The patient  will be  observed for [ADDRESS_781343]  scan  devic e 
parameter  interrogation  will be  performed  using  the pre-scan interrogation  protocol. If there 
is a significant increase  in pacing  threshold ( ≥0.5 V at 0.4 ms  or any increase at  a wider  pulse  
width)  after  the scan  compared  with  before  the scan,  the pacing  output  will be  increased  to 
maintain  a 2- to 2.5-times  amplitude  safety  margin  at the physician's  discretion. If there  is a 
significant decrease in  the P- and R-wave amplitudes,  the sensitivities  will be adjusted  to 
maintain  adequate atrial  and ventricula r electrocardiogram  detection.  
Implantable  cardioverter- defibrillator  interrogation  and programming:  
1. The  pacing  rate will gradually  be decreased  to, 40 beats/min.  If the patient  has an intrinsic  
rhythm  and is asymptomatic,  the device will be  programmed  to no pacing  (ODO or  OVO).  
All tachycardia therapy  and detection  functions  will be disabled. The  patient  will be  observed 
for [ADDRESS_781344]  scan  interrogation  will be  performed  as describ ed earlier  for pacemaker  
Subjects.  
3. Subjects  with  1 or more  parameter  changes  will be asked  to return  for 3 follow -up 
interrogations  over  a six-month period, which  will be  scheduled  less than  7 days after the 
procedure, again  at 3 months  (±30 days)  after  the MRI  procedure,  and at 6 months  (±30 days)  
after the MRI  procedure.  If no parameter  changes  requiring  multiple  follow -up visits  occur,  
the patient  will require  a single -device interrogation  between  3 and 6 months  (±30 days)  after  
the MRI  procedure.

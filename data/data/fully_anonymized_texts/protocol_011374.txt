Background and Significance  
Over the past two decades, there has been a dramatic rise in the use of prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_173638]. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_173639] 47,[ADDRESS_203151] rate 
of opi[INVESTIGATOR_85414]3. Hill et al. demonstrated that  within a general surgery practice,  over 70% 
of the prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_173640]4. Disturbingly, 45% of patients who did not take 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_173641]5. Similar 
excess opi[INVESTIGATOR_173642]6-7.  
The prescription of excess opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], especially when none are needed to reasonably manage pain, is an alarming trend that demands attention. Lack of knowledge about patterns of postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], desire to minimize patient dissatisfaction during recovery, and avoiding the 
inconvenience of an office visit to obtain a prescrip tion refill have all been cited as reasons for 
this practice
2. Research has been conducted to improve knowledge of opi[INVESTIGATOR_173643]. This has led to development of opi[INVESTIGATOR_173644]; in one such guideline, the minimum recommended number of opi[INVESTIGATOR_173645] [ADDRESS_203152] attempted to utilize restrictive opi[INVESTIGATOR_173646] . In a prospective study of 190 patients undergoing minimally 
Version 1. 8 5/28/2021   Page 2 of 11  
 
 invasive general surgery and urology operations, patients were advised to u se non- opi[INVESTIGATOR_173647] a small (4- 10 pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]) rescue opi[INVESTIGATOR_173648]9. Fifty -two percent of patients used no opi[INVESTIGATOR_17012], and 98% of patients used [ADDRESS_203153] (28 pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]) versus reduced (5 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]) opi[INVESTIGATOR_173649], and found no difference in patient satisfaction12. Importantly , 37% of our 
study patients  used no opi[INVESTIGATOR_173650]. Similarly, Tolley et al. reported that 
42% of benign gynecologic patients exposed to a multimodal pain control regimen used no 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_173651]13.  
 
Data from these studies support our belief that a restrictive opi[INVESTIGATOR_173652] , 
wherein  patients are not prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_173653],  may be both feasible 
and acceptable to the urogynecologic patient population. To date, there has been no  
randomized controlled trial  examining restrictive opi[INVESTIGATOR_173654]. Our section has already instituted an enhanced recovery after surgery 
(ERAS ) protocol  in which multimodal analgesia is used on al l surgical patients to maximize pain 
control and decrease opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]. Furthermore, based off the results of the aforementioned study by [CONTACT_173714], patients are discharged with a reduced opi[INVESTIGATOR_173655] 10 tablets after prolapse surgery . We believe that physicians can capi[INVESTIGATOR_173656] -prescribing without impacting patient care.   
 
Hence, the objective of this study is to determine if a restrictive opi[INVESTIGATOR_27279] (in 
which patients are not prescribed postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_173653]) is acceptable to patients after ambulatory an d major urogynecologic surgery, compared to standard opi[INVESTIGATOR_173657]. We also  intend to describe postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_173658], including factors predictive of opi[INVESTIGATOR_173659]- use. The results of 
this research will have a significant and timely impact  by [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_173660].  
 
Specific Aims  
Aim 1.  To c ompare patient satisfaction  and pain control  using two different opi[INVESTIGATOR_173661] . 
Version 1. 8 5/28/[ADDRESS_203154] 7 
postoperative days with validated questionnaires . Participants’ satisfaction with pain 
control will be evaluated at their postoperative visit.  
Aim 2.  To examine opi[INVESTIGATOR_173662] a nd major urogynecologic surgery.  
We hypothesize  that most postoperative patients will use few or no opi[INVESTIGATOR_173663], regardless of prescribing protocol. All participants will receive thorough counseling with detailed instructions on non- opi[INVESTIGATOR_173664], as well 
as multimodal analgesia via ERAS protocol during the perioperative period. Participants will be asked to log their opi[INVESTIGATOR_9787]- opi[INVESTIGATOR_173665]. We will also asses s the number of requests for opi[INVESTIGATOR_16447] (in those 
randomized to the restrictive protocol) and opi[INVESTIGATOR_173666] (from patients in the standard protocol).  
Aim 3.  To d etermine patient and perioperative factors associated with opi[INVESTIGATOR_173667].  
We plan to collect and analyze demographic, clinical and psychometric data on all 
participants with the goal of predicting analgesic needs and opi[INVESTIGATOR_173668] e after 
urogynecologic  surgery. Results from this study will guide surgeons on how to tailor 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_173669],  based off individual patient and 
perioperative characteristics.

 4. Study Procedures  
Randomization  
Trial participants will be randomized to one of two arms: 1) Standard Opi[INVESTIGATOR_173678] (Control) or 2) Restrictive Opi [INVESTIGATOR_173678] (Intervention) . The allocatio n sequence will be 
generated with random block sizes using computer software . The assignment  will be distributed 
to the primary surgeon using a sealed, opaque envelope. The primary surgeon is expected to 
Version 1. 8 5/28/2021   Page 5 of 11  
 
 open the envelope and disclose the assignment to the patient on the day of surgery. If patients are 
assigned to the intervention arm, the sealed envelope will contain the randomization assignment as well as a brightly -colored sheet of paper without identifiers that is to be plac ed on the patient’s 
chart, indicating patient involvement in this research study, as well as a reminder to postoperative caregivers (i.e. nurses, residents).  
 
Study Paradigm  
Participant Screening and Consent  
Participants will be prospectively identified by [CONTACT_173715]. A chart review by [CONTACT_1704] s will be performed to ensure eligibility criteria is met. Pa tients will be contact[CONTACT_173716], explain the purpose of the study, risks, benefits and a lternatives 
to participation  using a phone script [See Appendix 6 ]. Patients who agree to participate will be 
approached by a study investi gator or research nurse at their preoperative visit to sign a consent 
form and complete three questionnaires (Pain Catastrophizing Scale [ PCS ], Preoperative 
Questionnaire and Modified Pain Scales [See Appendices 1 -3]). E ncounter notes in the 
electronic medical record will document th e screening phone call and informed consent process. 
Documentation including signing the consent form will be obtained a t the preoperative visit. 
Please refer to the attached  consent document for IRB review.  
 Compe nsation will be provided to trial participants with a total of $50 in the form of two $20 
stipends  (one mailed after the first postoperative week, the second after the patient attends their 
postoperative visit) and a $[ADDRESS_203156] of parking 
for that visit and minimizing patient drop out. Approval for funding of this research study to cover participant compensation, as we ll as personnel support, was granted by [CONTACT_173717] (RPC) and Women’ s Health Institute on May 11, 2020 (RPC application 
#1785).  Preoperative Visit    
Thorough preoperative surgical counseling will take place at the preoperative visit  as per our 
standard protocol. The counseling will be performed by [CONTACT_173718], using a standardized template that includes discussion about normal postoperative symptoms and care , expected  discharge pain medications and dosing regimen. Patients are 
instructed that they do not have to use an  opi[INVESTIGATOR_173679], per our  usual 
practice.  
 Other than the postoperative medications that patients are discharged home with, the perioperative pain control regimen  will be the same for both study arms . The pain control 
regimen  utilized involves  a multimodal protocol [See Table 1 ] established after a prior study 
conducted in our department  by [CONTACT_6283]. Hickman and Paraiso.  
 Day of Discharge  
Per protocol, all patients undergoing surgery will be prescribed a non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_173680] a 7- day supply of ibuprofen and acetaminophen at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. Patients will 
be instructed to take both acetaminophen and ibuprofen around the clock for 3 days, then as 
Version 1. 8 5/28/2021   Page 6 of 11  
 
 needed thereafter. Patients are instructed to “stagger” these medications , such that the patient 
will take a dose of either acetaminophen or ibuprofen every 3- 4 hours to permit continuous 
analgesia.  
 Study Intervention  
Control Arm : In addition to the above non- opi[INVESTIGATOR_173681], patients  randomized to the Standard 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_173682]. Currently, it is our practice to discharge patients with a small opi[INVESTIGATOR_173683] 5-
10 pi[INVESTIGATOR_173684] m ajor urogynecologic surgery and 2- 5 pi[INVESTIGATOR_173685]. Providers will be 
recommended to prescribe oxycodone 5 mg every 6 hours as needed, but substitutions  for other 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_173686].   
 
Intervention Arm : Patients randomized to the Restrictive Opi[INVESTIGATOR_173687]- opi[INVESTIGATOR_173688]. If the patient requests an opi[INVESTIGATOR_173689], the patient will be provided with a 1- day supply (4 pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]). To ensure that 
postsurgical pain is well controlled  after discharge, we will make clear that patients can 
request an opi[INVESTIGATOR_173690] . All study participants  will receive a 
scheduled telephone call  by a caregiver  on the day after discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  (see below) , 
and patients in the intervention ar m will be asked  if an opi[INVESTIGATOR_173691]. 
If a prescription is requested over telephone, the patient will be triaged  by a nurse and  physician. 
The opi[INVESTIGATOR_173692] d by [CONTACT_173719], and a 
maximum of 10 opi[INVESTIGATOR_173693], per physician judgment  and the level of surgery. If 
the physi cian deems that the patient’s pain is related to a pos tsurgical complication, the patient 
will be requested to come in for an urgent postoperative visit. Virtual Care Visits  will be utilized 
if deemed appropriate.  
 Contact [CONTACT_173720]/concerns will be given to all  
patient s at discharge.  
 Postoperative Period  
At the time of discharge, patient will be reminded to complete logs of their pain medication use and pain levels for the first 7 days. They will be given the option to do this electronically through Research Electronic Data Capture ( REDCap ) or by [CONTACT_173721]. They will indicate their 
preference on the preoperative questionnaire. If they prefer the latter, these forms will be provided to them at discharge.  
 All patients will be contact[CONTACT_173722][INVESTIGATOR_173694] . During the telephone call, the investigator will assess  the patient’s 
postoperative pain control  and elicit any questions or concerns  about their pain medications. 
Other postoperative concerns will be promptly relayed to the pat ient’s surgical team. Study 
participants  will be reminded to complete the ir pain medication and pain scale logs during their 
first telephone call and by [CONTACT_173723] ( POD ) 3 and 7 [See 
Appendix 7 ]. Participants will be asked their preferred modality for reminder communications 
on the Preoperative Questionnaire . For patients who elect text message communication, the first 
text message will indicate that data rates may apply and the option to opt out  of text messaging. 
Version 1. 8 5/28/2021   Page 7 of 11  
 
 Subsequent text messages will contain a reminder and a link to their individualized REDCap logs. Similarly, email messages will contain a reminder and link to REDCap.  
 All postoperative telephone calls to the surgeon’s office from study participants will be reviewed by [CONTACT_173724]’s surgical team. If a patient calls due to inadequate postoperative 
pain control, and the physician believes that an adjunctive non- opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536] (e.g. 
gabapentin, cyclobenzaprine) would be better for pain relief than an opi[INVESTIGATOR_16447], they may prescribe this instead.  If any patients require a second opi[INVESTIGATOR_16447], office evaluation 
is required.  
 The following postoperative assessments will be performed:  
 Pain Level : Patients will b e asked to report their pain level for the first 7 days 
postoperatively. Pain levels will be assessed using questions 1, 2 and 4 from the Modi fied 
Surgical Pain Scales (SPS)15 [See Appendix 3 ], which measures pain at rest, during normal 
activities and quantifies unpleasantness of worst pain using an 11- point numeric rating score .  
 Medication Usage : Patients will be asked to log their daily non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_173695] e first 7 days postoperatively [See Appendix 4 ]. 
All pa tients will have a scheduled postoperative visit at 6 weeks. At this visit, any paper 
versions of the postoperative pain scales and medication logs will be collected. 
 Patient Satisfaction and Pain Expectations : Patient satisfaction with postoperative pain 
control and how pain expectations were met will be assessed with a 5 -point Likert scale  [See 
Appendix 5 ] at the postoperative visit.

5. Statistical Plan  
Sample Size:  
Version 1. 8 5/28/2021   Page 8 of 11  
 
 The primary outcome of this study is to compare patient satisfaction with postoperative pain control using two different opi[INVESTIGATOR_173696]. Power analysis is based on our prior study by [CONTACT_173714]. demonstrating 93% patient satisfaction with pain control with reduced (5 pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]) opi[INVESTIGATOR_85414]
13.  
 
If there is truly no difference between the S tandard and R estrictive O pi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] P rescribing  Protocols 
(93% patient satisfaction in both groups), a sample size of 122 is required to demonstrate with 
90% power that the upper limit of a one -sided 97.5% confidence  interval will exclude a 
difference in favor of the standard group of more than 15% (non- inferiority margin). To allow 
for an anticipated 5% dropout rate, a total of 128 participants are required (64 per arm) . 
 Statistical Analysis:   
Continuous descriptive  data will be reported as mean and standard deviation (±SD) or median 
with interquartile range (IQR), depending on distribution. Categorical data will be reported as frequencies, using percentages.  Patient satisfaction,  pain scores at each time point and o verall 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_173697]. The  investigators  also plan to perform two subgroup 
analyses , comparing these study outcome  measures  between ambulatory and major 
urogynecologic surgery patients , and secondly, comparing baseline and periope rative 
characteristics between opi[INVESTIGATOR_173698]- users.  
 Patient satisfaction will be compared as a dichotomized variable using the chi -squared test. Pain 
scores  will be treated as continuous, non- normally distributed data and will be compared using 
the Mann -Whitney U test. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_173699] a dichotomized variable will be compared using chi -
squared test. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_173700]’s t -test. Binary logistic 
regression will be used to assess the influence of various patient and perioperative factors on the probability of using opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] , and results will be reported as odds ratios with 95% confidence 
intervals . JMP 14.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) will be  used for all statistical analyses.  The 
primary investigator s (ASY, CAF)  will perform the statistical analys is. 
 All analyses will be conducted using an intention- to-treat principle. The investigators anticipate 
that some n on-adherence to the assigned therapy (e.g. crossover to opi[INVESTIGATOR_173701]) will occu r, and as these protocol deviations will bias the results towards non- inferiority , a 
per-protocol sensitivity analysis has also been planned. 
 All analyses , with the exception of that for our primary outcome, will be  conducted with an a 
priori alpha level of 0.05; results yielding p <  0.[ADDRESS_203157] for non- inferiority 
assessment; the confidence interval  is wider and therefore more likely to cross the non- inferiority 
margin .  
 6. Data Collection  
Preoperative data will include the following: 
 Pain Catastrophizing Scale score  
 Patient MRN, age, race,  ethnicity,  vaginal parity, menopausal state , current tobacco use,

7. Data Management Plan  
Protection of each subject’s personal health information will be a priority in this study. One master excel file containing su bject personal information including name [CONTACT_173727] a password- protected file, on a designated protected research drive on a 
password- protected computer in a locked office at the Cleveland Clinic. In that file, each subject 
will be assigned a subject identification number that will be used for the purposes of data collection in order to de -identify subjects. All paper forms used for data collection will be kept in 
a research cabinet dedicated to this project which will be locked at all times, in a locked office at the Cleveland Clinic. All forms will contain de -identified information – identification numbers 
will correspond to the subjects listed in the master excel file. All study data will be transferred and managed electron ically using REDCap. Each subject will be entered into REDCap using the 
assigned identification number from the master excel file.  
8. Adverse Events and Data Monitoring:  
Any adverse event or unanticipated events will be reported as soon as feasible to the IRB using 
IRB WebKit.  Examples of adverse events include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_173704] ( substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) due  to inadequate pain control . 
Version 1. 8 5/28/2021   Page 10 of 11  
 
 All events will be recorded and kept in a research binder assigned to this study in a locked office. Monthly reviews during the study period will be done by [CONTACT_173725], and if they are, that they are being handled and reported 
properly. The study will be terminated if over 5 0% of patients in the Restrictive Opi[INVESTIGATOR_173705] >20% 
decreased satisf action to the control group; this will be assessed monthly at  the reviews 
mentioned above.  
 9. Timeline for Completion   
The goal for this research study is for completion by [CONTACT_173726]’s  
(ASY)  three year fellowshi p at Cleveland Clinic (June 2022).  After obtaining institutional 
review board approval, a discussion will be held at our section  research meeting to educate all 
urogynecology staff, fellows, and nurse practitioners on the implementati on of this project. An 
in-service will be given to familiarize outpatient nursing staff with the project. Additionally, an 
email will be sent to the O B/GYN residents outlining key components of the project, and an in-
service will be given to the residents on our service.  
Patient recruitment will begin thereafter with the goal of  recruiting and complete data collection 
on all patients over an [ADDRESS_203158] completion well before the conclusion of the primary investigator’s fellowship.

Protocol No.:  OTO- 313-201 
Title of Study:  A randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled Phase 2 study of OT O-313 given as a single 
intratympanic injection in subjects with  unilateral subjective tinnitus  
Study Center(s):   Study will be conducted at approximately 55 sites  globally  
Study Period:  Approximately 20 months  Phase of Development:  2 
Study Design:  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled Phase 2 study  to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
intratympanic OTO -313.  Approximately 140 e ligible subjects with unilateral tinnitus will be randomly 
assigned 1:1 to either 0.32 mg OTO- 313 or placebo for intratympanic injection to the affected (study) ear.  
Randomization is stratified by [CONTACT_3885], duration of tinnitus ( ≥2 to ≤6 months and >6 to ≤ 12 months since 
onset) and by [CONTACT_861939] ( TFI) score at Screening and B aseline ( ≥32 to ≤53 
points, ≥54 to ≤100 points).  Subjects will be observed for efficacy and safety for [ADDRESS_1201903] safety data to ensure 
appro priate safety and tolerability  of OTO -313 and placebo . 
Study Objectives: 
Primary : 
• To determine the efficacy of OTO -313 in subjects with unilateral tinnitus  by [CONTACT_861940] . 
Secondary :  
• To determine the effect of OTO -313 across additional secondary measures of efficacy ( tinnitus 
loudness and annoyance NRS , PGIC , SF-12) relative to pla cebo.  
• To determine the safety and tolerability of OTO -313 in subjects with unilateral tinnitus.  
Method s: 
This study will be conducted at approximately [ADDRESS_1201904] an 
overall TFI score of ≥ 32 at both Screening and Baseline  visits  for eligibility.  After Screening, potential 
subjects will begin a 2 -week Lead -in assessment period.  During this time, subjects will enter daily tinnitus 
annoyance and tinnitus loudness severity into a diary using the appropriate Numeric Rating Scales (NRS) for 
each symptom.  Subjects must have completed the tinnitus diary on [ADDRESS_1201905] 7 days of the 14-day Lead -in 
period for eligibility.  
At the Baseline (Day 1) visit, approximately 140 eligible subjects  will be randomized to OTO- 313 or placebo 
using a 1:1 allocation ratio .  Randomization is stratified by [CONTACT_3885], duration of tinnitus (≥2 to ≤6 months  and 
>6 to ≤ 12 months since onset) and by [CONTACT_861941] B aseline ( ≥32 to ≤53 points, 
≥54 to ≤100 points).     
After a single intratympanic injection with 0.32 mg OTO -313 or placebo to the affected (study) ear on Day 1, 
subjects  will continue to record their tinnitus annoyance and tinnitus loudness on a daily  basis using the diary 
during the 16 -week  Follow -up period .  Subjects will complete the TFI at study visits at Week 4, Week 8, W eek

12, and Week 16.  Additional efficacy and/or  safety assessments will a lso be completed at Baseline (Day 1), 
Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, and Week [ADDRESS_1201906] 25% (35 
subjects), 50% (70 subjects), and 75% (105 subjects) of subjects randomized and who have post -administration 
safety data.   Blinded safety data including adverse events, concomitant medications, medical history, clinical 
safety laboratory measurements, audiometry, otoscopy, tympanometry, and C -SSRS data will be reviewed.  The 
treatment assignment for an individual subject may be unblinded, if deemed necessary to enable medical care or 
study decision -making by [CONTACT_7244].  The decision to continue with the study will be based 
on recommendations from the Safety Review Committee on the clinical significance of any adverse events or 
suspected investigational pr oduct -related or procedure -related findings.  Additional information on the Safety 
Data Review and composition of the independent Safety Review Committee is provided in the Safety Review Committee Charter.

Statistical Methods:  
Sample Size Justification:  
The primary endpoint is the percentage  of responders, where response is defined as achieving at least a 
13-point reduction from baseline in the TFI total score at both Week s 4 and 8.  It was observed from the 
previous study that the response rate for OTO -313 (0.32 mg) was 43% , and 13% for placebo.  Based on these 
results, the assumed rate of response for OTO- 313 is 4 3% and 1 8% for placebo , which is the 13% observed 
response rate in previous study plus 5% inflation for potential placebo response .  
Assuming a [ADDRESS_1201918] and level of significance of 0.05, 60 subjects in the placebo group and 60 subjects in 
the OTO -313 group  will provide approximately 85% power to detect a treatment difference in favor  of 
OTO- 313.  It is also assumed that an observed discontinuation rate of 1 5% will be observed, hence the total 
sample size for this 2-arm study is planned to  be [ADDRESS_1201919] for a difference in proportions between two 
groups.  
Analyses: 
The primary endpoint , analyzed using the common risk difference between treatment groups , will be tested 
using a Mantel -Haenszel test controlling for duration of tinnitus  and baseline TFI score at Week 8 . The 95% 
confidence intervals (CI) ar ound the common ris k difference will be provided.  The risk difference in responses 
rates will also be compared between treatment groups at Weeks [ADDRESS_1201920] -square adjusted means , the estimated difference in adjusted means between treatment groups  and 
associated 95% CIs will be provided.   Comparisons between treatment groups will be conducted at each post-
baseline visit as secondary analyses.  
The results of the PGIC will be analyz ed using a Cochrane -Mantel -Haenszel mean score test controlling for 
baseline TFI score and duration of tinnitus .  This will be done to compare OTO -313 with placebo.  
Adverse events, audiometry, tympanometry, otoscopic, and C -SSRS safety endpoints will be su mmarized 
descriptively.  Changes in vital signs and laboratory parameters will be summarized descriptively .

2 End-of-study procedures will be performed at Visit 6 (Week 16) or upon early termination (ET) from the study.  If a subject terminat es early prior to Week 8, a 
clinical laboratory test should be performed.  
3 The +5 days window is allowed for purposes of scheduling the Baseline visit  and is not included in determination of NRS diary compliance.  
4 Subjects view a short educational video on clinical research participation entitled “What it Means to Take Part in Clinical Research Studies”.  Viewing of the 
video will be completed after informed consent but prior to any efficacy assessments ( e.g., TFI) during the screening visit.  
5 Medical history to include information on demographics and completion of the modifi ed Tinnitus Sample Case History Questionnaire (TSCHQ) to capture 
tinnitus and related medical history information.  Changes in medical history since the Screening visit will be recorded at the Baseline visit.  In addition, if 
subject has any untoward medic al occurrences that would meet the definition of a serious event (see Section 9.1 Serious Adverse Event)  prior to investigational 
product administration, this information is to be recorded in medical history and immediately discussed with the Medical Monitor to evaluate whether the 
subject should be excluded from randomization/treatment.  Serious medical events that occur prior to investigational product administration  should be recorded 
on the Pre -Dose Serious Medical Occurrences report form .  Medical history, conditions, and procedures that occurred prior to Screening , including COVID -19 
infection,  may be added throughout the study (if identified later).  
[ADDRESS_1201922] at Baseline (prior to randomization), and a urine 
pregnancy test at Week 16.  If the Screening or Baseline pregnancy test result is positive, the subject is not eligible for enrollment into the study.  If a subject is 
found to be  pregnant based on urine test after dosing with investigational product , a confirmatory serum pregnancy test will be performed locally,  and the 
subject should complete the 16- week follow -up period  (See Section 9.2.3 ).  Only the Screening serum pregnancy te sts will be analyzed by a central laboratory.

 17 Otonomy, Inc. OTO -313-201 Protocol V3.0: 20 July 2021  1. BACKGROUND  
Tinnitus or “ringing in the ears”,  is defined as a perception of sounds without a correlated 
external auditory stimulus.  Tinnitus is a common disorder with  prev alence estimates ranging 
from 11.9% to 30.3% across various countries with prevalence generally increasing with age 
(McCormack et al 2016 ).  Exposure to recreational, firearm, and occupational noise increases the 
odds of experiencing tinnitus ( Shargorodsky et al 2010) , and tinnitus is the leading service-
related cause of disability among US military veterans  (US Veterans Benefits Administration ).  
Tinnitus is often a long -term and persistent condition with recent survey results finding that 56% 
of individuals with tinnitus had symptoms longer than 5 years and 36% had nearly constant symptoms ( Bhatt et al 2016 ).   
Tinnitus can be distressful , negatively i mpacting  quality of life ( Nondahl et al 2007 ) as affected 
patients report  associated  symptoms of insomnia, anxiety, depression, and cognitive diff iculties  
(Schecklmann et al 2015; Zeman et al 2014; Bhatt et al 2017 ; Tegg -Quinn et al 2016 ).  While 
some habituate to the sound, approximately 1 in 4 people with tinnitus believe it to be a moderate 
to severe problem and nearly half  will seek medical treatment  (Bhatt et al 2016).  At present , 
however, there is no cure or approved medication.  Current management of tinnitus largely focuses on modulation of the patient’s attention and responses to the sensation.  Approaches 
include education and counseling, sound therapy, use of hearing aids, and cognitive behavioral 
therapy ( Tunkel et al  2014).    
Causes and conditions associated with tinni tus include sensorineural hearing loss, acute hearing 
loss from noise trauma, barotrauma, or traumatic cochlear injury (acute acoustic trauma, blast 
trauma, middle ear surgery, inner ear barotrauma),  age- related hearing loss , Meniere’s disease, 
otitis media, ototoxic drug use, and head and neck injuries ( Langguth et al 2013).  In m any cases, 
tinnitus arises as a consequence of  cochlear insults and therefore one pharmacotherapy approach 
to the treatment of tinnitus is directed at normalizing altered neural activity within the cochlea.  
Excessive activation of NMDA receptors at the level of the inner hair cell synapses with  
subsequent deafferentation may be a key mechanism  of abnormal sensory signaling in tinnitus 
(Bing et al. 2015).  Intratympanic administration of NMDA receptor antagonists in animal 
models of acute tinnitus  was shown to reduce deafferentation and the decline of auditory 
brainstem response Wave I amplitude ( Bing et al . 2015) and to reduce “tinnitus- like” behavior  
(Guitton et al. 2003) .  These findings suggest that  activation of cochlear NMDA receptors may 
be an important mechanism for generating tinnitus  and that intratympanic NMDA receptor 
antagonists may have potential as a local cochlear  treatment for tinnitus.   
1.1. Intratympanic formulation of gacyclidine  (OTO- 313)  
Intratympanic administration permits deposition of drugs over the round window membrane.  
This enables access to the inner ear for more localized delivery to the cochlea and less systemic 
drug exposure ( Bird et al. 2007).   Gacyclidine, the active agent in OTO -313, is a noncompetitive 
NMDA- receptor antagonist that is considered to have greater potency , faster on- rate, and slower 
off-receptor rate than other NMDA- receptor antagonists (Mitha and Maynard 2001; Piu et al 
2018) .  Gacyclidine was originally formulated  as OTO -311,  
 to pr ovide sustained exposure of 

 
 18 Otonomy, Inc. OTO -313-201 Protocol V3.0: 20 July 2021  gacyclidine to cochlear tissues following a single intratympanic administration .  Additional 
preclinical studies showed that gacyclidine formulated  
 (OTO-313) provided grea ter and longer lasting inner ear exposures of 
gacyclidine compared to OTO-[ADDRESS_1201925] and brain trauma patients and no concerning safety issues were identified.  Gacyclidine has 
also been administered to the otic compartment in an open label study in patients with chronic 
tinnitus.  The drug was generally safe and well -tolerated and reduced subjective tinnitus ratings 
in 4 of the 6 subjects evaluated ( Wenzel, et al. 2010 ).  In a completed Phase 1 study in healthy 
subjects (Study 311-201501) , OTO-311 (the earlier formulation of gacyclidine), placebo or sham 
was administered as a single intratympanic injection .  All  OTO-311 dose levels tested (0.15 mg, 
0.3 mg, and 0.6 mg) w ere well -tolerated  and no safety concerns were identified .   
Study 313-201901 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1/2 study which 
evaluated the safety and exploratory efficacy of a single intra tympanic administration of 
OTO-313 in subjects with subjective tinnitus.  An initial safety and plasma PK coh ort of 8 
subjects dosed with 0.11 mg OTO-313 or placebo ( 3:1) demonstrated that this dose level was 
well-tolerated with no safety concerns.  An exploratory efficacy cohort of 35 subjec ts with 
unilateral tinnitus of moderate to severe intensity (score of ≥  25 on the Tinnitus Functional Index 
[TFI]) and a duration of tinnitus of 1 to 6 months received a single intratympanic  injection of 
0.32 mg OTO-313 or placebo (1:1).  0.32 mg OTO-313 was well- tolerated with a lower 
incidence of adverse events than placebo .   
In the exploratory efficacy cohort, the mean TFI reduction from baseline trended in favor of OTO-313 at each timepoint (Day 15: - 9.3 points OTO -313 vs -4.1 points P lacebo ; Day 29: -9.4 
points OTO-313 vs - 6.6 points Placebo ; Day 57: - 12.9 points OTO -313 vs - 4.3 points P lacebo ).  
A clinically meaningful, 13 -point improvement on the TFI was observed in 43% (6/14) of 
OTO-313 subjects at both Day 29 (Week 4)  and Day 57 (Week 8) versus 13% (2/16) of P lacebo  
subject s (ad hoc  1-sided p- value < 0.05).  The highe r responder rate for OTO -313 versus P lacebo 
was maintained for all TFI improvement levels of 15, 20, 25 and 30 points.  Treatment with OTO-313 also led to reduction in the daily ratings of tinnitus loudness and annoyance, as well as 
improved PGIC scores.  Among responders, strong correlation was observed between the various endpoints in favor of OTO-313.  As anticipated, plasma concentrations of gacyclidine were 
below the limit of assay quantitation (≤ 0.1 ng/mL) confirming limited systemic exposure.  These  
results suggest that a single intratympanic injection of 0.[ADDRESS_1201926] that this  dose 
level of  OTO-313 will pro duce sufficient inner ear exposures of gacyclidine in humans.  The 

 
 19 Otonomy, Inc. OTO -313-201 Protocol V3.0: 20 July 2021  lipid formulation of OTO -313 is expected to maintain  sustained exposures to the cochlea over 
time (at least 7  to 14 days in preclinical testing).  Taken together, the preclinical and clinical data 
support the evaluation of 0.32 mg OTO-313 in this Phase 2 study in subjects with  unilateral 
tinnitus. 
The preclinical and clinical data obtained to date are described in more detail in the 
Investigator’s Brochure. 
2. OBJECTIVES  
2.1. Primary  objective  
 
• To determine the efficacy of OTO -313 in subjects with unilateral tinnitus by [CONTACT_861946].  
2.2. Secondary objectives   
 
• To determine the effect of OTO -313 across addit ional secondary measures of efficacy 
(tinnitus loudness and annoyance NRS, PGIC, SF-12) relative to placebo. 
• To determine the safety and tolerability of OTO -[ADDRESS_1201927] an overall score of ≥ 32 on the TFI at both Screening and Baseline.  After Screening, 
potential subjects will begin a 2 -week L ead-in assessment period.  During t his time, subjects will 
enter daily tinnitus annoyance and tinnitus loudness severity into a diary using the appropriate 
Numeric Rating Scales (NRS) for each symptom.  Subjects must have completed the tinnitus 
diary on at least [ADDRESS_1201928] 7 days of the 14- day Lead -in period for eligibility.   The additional 
+5 days of the Lead -in period  will not be used for eligibility.  
At the Baseline (Day 1) visit, approximately  140 eligible subjects will be randomized to OTO -
313 or placebo using a 1:1 allocation ratio.  Randomization is stratified by [CONTACT_3885], duration of 
tinnitus (≥2 to ≤6 months and >6 to ≤ 12 months since onset) and by [CONTACT_861947] ( ≥32 to ≤53 points, ≥ 54 to ≤100 points).    
After a single intratympanic injection with 0.32 mg OTO -313 or placebo to the affected (study) 
ear on Day 1, subjects will continue to record their tinnitus annoyance and tinnitus loudness on a daily basis using the diary during the 16-week Follow-up period.  Subjects will complete the TFI at study visits at  Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, and Week 16.  Additional efficacy and/or  safety 
assessments will also be co mpleted at Baseline (Day 1), Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, and Week

 23 Otonomy, Inc. OTO -313-201 Protocol V3.0: 20 July 2021  5. RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING 
5.1. Overview  
Approximately 140 e ligible subjects wil l be assigned randomly to 0.32 mg OTO -313 or placebo 
using a 1:1 allocation ratio , based on a computer-generated randomization schedule. 
• 0.32 mg OTO-313; single (0.2 mL volume) intratympanic injection  to the affected (study) 
ear 
• Placebo  (vehicle) ; single (0.2 mL volume) intratympanic injection  to the affected (study) 
ear 
OTO-[ADDRESS_1201942] Identification Numbers  
At the Screening visit ( Visit 1 ), subjects who have signed the informed consent will be assigned 
a sequential subject identification number by [CONTACT_779].  Once assigned, the subject identification 
number will not be re-assigned and should not be changed.  This number will be used to identify 
the subject throughout the  study, including the S creening and Lead -in periods.  Any subject that 
is re-screened will be assigned a new subject identification number.  Subjects will be considered 
enrolled into the study once they complete the informed consent proc ess. 
The subject identification number will consist of 9 digits separated by 2 hyphens (e.g., 201-
XXX- YYY).  The first 3 digits are  the study number (201) followed by a hyphen.  The second [ADDRESS_1201943] has met all prerequisites for randomization on Day 1 (Baseline/Visit 2), s tudy 
sites will execute each randomization  via the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) 
randomization system .  All s tudy site personnel are blinded to treatment assignment .  Study sites 
will receive a randomization notification indicating the kit number (packaged investigational 
product), and the date and time of randomization for each subject.  Once assigned, kit numbers 
cannot be re -assigned.  
Study sites will provide the information contained in the IRT randomization notification to the 
person responsible for preparation of the syringe containing investigational  product ( OTO -313 or 
placebo) .  The unique kit number provided by [CONTACT_861948] a kit of packaged 
investigational product labeled with the identical kit number.  The syringe will be prepared from 
the contents of the investigational product package corresponding to the IR T kit number 
according to the instructions in the study Pharmacy Manual .  The subject identification number 
and kit number both must  be recorded in the subject’s record.  
5.2.3. Randomization Algorithm 
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1  ratio (OTO-313:placebo) of treatment groups using a 
permuted block randomization algorithm.  Randomization is stratified by [CONTACT_3885], duration of 
 
 24 Otonomy, Inc. OTO -313-201 Protocol V3.0: 20 July 2021  tinnitus ( ≥2 to ≤6 months and >6 to ≤ 12 months since onset) and by [CONTACT_861949] B aseline ( ≥32 to ≤53 points, ≥ 54 to ≤100 points).    
The randomization process will be deployed via IRT which is accessible [ADDRESS_1201944]’s randomization number will determine the randomized treatment 
assignment.  Investigational product kits will be labeled with a u nique kit number using a 
separate and independent randomization algorithm.   Numbered kits will be dispensed based on 
the treatment assignment.   
5.3. Blinding  
The study will be double-blinded.  Each treatment syringe will be prepared according to the detailed i nstructions in the Pharmacy Manual .   
In case of emergency, t he blind should be broken for site personnel only if knowing the subject’s 
treatment allocation would facilitate specific medical  treatment.  In all  cases, the I nvestigator 
should consult with the medical monitor prior to unblinding, and if not possible as soon as it is practical after unblinding has occurred and treatment initiated. 
If the blind is broken, the subject will continue to be followed and evaluated per-protocol.  The 
date, time, and reason for the unblinding must be documented on the appropriate page of the eCRF.  
The randomization schedule or blocking factor(s) will not be revealed to study subjects, Investigators, clinical staff, site managers or the Sponsor until all subjects have completed the 
study and the database has been finalized by [CONTACT_1034] . 
6. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  
6.1. Investigational Product Administration

an affected (study) ear .  Only a physician may  perform the intratympanic injection.    
OTO-[ADDRESS_1201946]  in a recumbent position with the affected (study)  ear upwards.   
 
 25 Otonomy, Inc. OTO -313-201 Protocol V3.0: 20 July 2021  2. Prior to OTO -313 or placebo administration, confirm the ear to be treated is the affected  
(study) ear. 
3. Anesthetize the tympanic membrane by [CONTACT_861950]-
posterior quadrant with topi[INVESTIGATOR_861930]/prilocaine cream (e.g.,  
 or lido cai
ne spray  or solution) until the tympanic membrane is numb.  If 
applicable, suction away any excess topi[INVESTIGATOR_773306] .  Use of p henol is prohibited for  
anesthe tizing the tympanic membrane  (Section 7.1).  
4. Using the prepared  syringe, insert the needle (bevel facing ) into the inferior -posterior 
quadrant of the tympanic membrane at the level of the round window, taking care not to insert the needle further than necessary.   
5. With the needle bevel facing in the inferior- posteri or direction, inject 0.[ADDRESS_1201947]’s eCRF.  This will include all symptomatic relief medications for tinnitus symptoms, prescription drugs, herbal products, 
vitamins, minerals, and over -the-counter medications taken within [ADDRESS_1201948]’s eCRF.

inflammatory drugs for intermittent pain relief may be permitted at the Investigator’s 
discretion.  
• Medications that are considered moderate or strong indu cers of CYP2B6 (e.g., 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  efavirenz, rifampin, and ritonavir)  
Use of any of these pro hibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_861932] a protocol deviation.  
7.2. Other  Medications and Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_861933] c ertain medications for relief of 
symptoms related to tinnitus  or other disease (e.g., worsening depression).  Use of the following 
medication and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_426497]: 
• Stable doses ( taken for ≥ 1 month prior to Screening) of antidepress ant and anti -anxiety 
medications  are allowed during the study, and   
• Stable prior use (≥ 1 month prior to Screening) of over -the-counter supplements, 
medications for tinnitus ( e.g., Gingko biloba, melatonin) , nonconventional therapy, and 
transcranial magnetic stimulation for tinnitus .   
No new medications, over-the-counter supplements, or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_861934].   
Any changes reported by [CONTACT_861951], including changes in dose or 
frequency of dosing, while not considered a protocol deviation, should be recorded in the 
subject’s eCRF.    
No new hearing aids, sound/noise therapy devices, or behavioral therapy for tinnitus may be 
introduced during the study.  However, patients using devices or behavioral therapy pre-study 
are permitted to continue stable use.  
• Stable prior use (≥ 1 month prior to Screening ) of hearing aids, noise generators, and/ or 
sound therapy devices is allowed  and, if utilized , these devices should be used 
consistently throughout  the duration of study.   
• Similarly, any behavioral therapy for tinnitus should also be stable (≥ 1 month prior to 
Screening) and continue throughout the duration of the study.   
Any changes in the concurrent use of these devices or behavioral therapy  for tinnitus , while not 
considered a protocol deviation, should be recorded in the subject’s eCRF. 
 
 27 Otonomy, Inc. OTO -313-201 Protocol V3.0: 20 July 2021  8. STUDY EVALUATIONS  
8.1. Study Procedures by [CONTACT_4838] 
8.1.1. Screening Period : Up to [ADDRESS_1201950] ed in the Time and Events Schedule ( Table 1 ), will be 
performed during the screening period: obtain documented i nformed consent, review and 
confirm eligibility criteria , medical history , demographics,  prior and concomitant medications, 
vital signs , height and weight measurements, s erum  pregnancy test (for female subjects of 
childbearing potential only), c linical laboratory tests, TFI assessment, otoscopy, tympanometry, 
audiometry, and C- SSRS assessment: Baseline version .  The modified Tinnitus Sample Case 
History Quest ionnaire (TSCHQ) will be completed at Screening as part of medical history to 
capture tinnitus- specific medical history.   Each subject will also view a short educational video 
on clinical research participation entitled “What It Means to Take Part in Clinical Research 
Studies”.   Viewing of the video will be completed after informed consent but prior to the T FI at 
the screening visit . 
8.1.2. Lead -In Period: Day -14 to Day -1 (+ 5 days) 
The subject will record their tinnitus loudness and tinnitus annoyance e ach day, using the NRS 
for each symptom, in a diary during the 14- day Lead -In assessment period.  Subjects must have 
completed the tinnitus diary on at least [ADDRESS_1201951] 7 days of th e 14- day Lead -in period for 
eligibility.  The additional +5 days of the Lead-in period will not be used for eligibility. 
8.1.3. Baseline/Investigational Product Administration: Day [ADDRESS_1201952] (for female subjects of childbearing 
potential), and C- SSRS (“Since Last Visit” version) must be available and reviewed by [CONTACT_861952]’s eligibility before randomization.  
In addition, t he following assessments are to be performed on all subjects prior to dosing to 
establish Baseline status : medical history  (with particular attention to any untoward medical 
occurrenc es that would meet the definition of a serious outcome – See Section 9.1 Serious 
Adverse Event) , vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, TFI (overall score of ≥ 32 on the TFI at 
Screening and Baseline visits is required for eligibility), SF- 12, otoscopy, t ympanometry, and 
audiometry .  Once eligibility status is confirmed and the subject is randomized, the 
investigational product is administered and the remaining Day 1  assessments (i.e., AE 
monitoring) are completed.  
If the subject is no longer eligible, the  subject will not be randomized and should be recorded as 
a screen failure (documentation for screen failures will be limited specifically to end of study 
reason, demographic i nformation , TSCHQ, reason for screen failure, and inclusion/exclusion 
criteria ).  Re -screening of subjects may be permitted after discussion with the medical monitor 
and sponsor.

are to be performed .  In the event that a subject terminates early prior to Week 8, a clinical 
laboratory test should be conducted.  
8.1.6. Week 12 (Day 85 ± 4 days): Follow Up 
The primary purpose of the Week [ADDRESS_1201955].     
All Week 12  efficacy and  safety assessments as listed in the Time and Events Schedule  (Table 1 ) 
are to be performed . 
8.1.7. Week 16 (Day 113 ± 4 days): End of Study /Early Termi nation  
The primary purpose of the Week [ADDRESS_1201956] for women of childbearing potential, 
otoscopy, tympanometry, audiometry, C-SSRS, and AE monitoring.   
All Week 16  efficacy and  safety assessments as listed in the Time and Events Schedule ( Table 1 ) 
are to be performed.   In the event that a subject terminates prior to Week 8, a clinical laboratory 
test should be co nducted. 
8.1.8. Unscheduled Visit  
Unscheduled V isits may occur in the event of safety-related issues.  Appropriate safety  
assessments (e.g., otoscopy, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests) may be conducted at  the 
Investigator’s discretion  at Unscheduled Visits.  
 
 29 Otonomy, Inc. OTO -313-201 Protocol V3.0: 20 July 2021  8.2. Medical History  and Demographic s 
The medical history will be obtained from medical records and/or via subject interview at the 
Screening visit, and includes general medical history, medication history, reproductive history, 
and history of COVID -[ADDRESS_1201957] medical 
occurrences that would meet the definition of a serious event (see Section 9.1 Serious Adverse 
Event) prior to investigational product administration, this information is to be recorded in medica l history and immediately discussed with the Medical Monitor to evaluate whether the 
subject should be excluded from randomization/treatment.  Serious medical events that occur 
prior to investigational product administration should be recorded on the Pre-Dose Serious 
Medical Occurrences report form.   
Tinnitus- specific medical history information is also obtained by [CONTACT_861953].   Medical history, conditions, and procedures that 
occurred prior to Screening may be added throughout the study (if identified later). 
Demographic information will also be obtained at the Screen ing visit and will include age; sex; 
race; ethnicity; height, without shoes; weight, without shoes.  Weight will also be  obtained at 
Week  16. 
8.3. Video for Subjects on Clinical Research Participation  
Subjects will view an educational video on clinical research participation entitled “What I t 
Mean s to Take Part in Clinical Research Studies”.  This 7- minute video provides general 
information, in lay terms, on the purpose of blinded, controlled clinical research studies and the 
roles and responsibilities  of a subject in a clinical research study .  Viewing of the video will be 
completed after informed consent but prior to any efficacy assessments (e.g. , TFI)  at the 
screening visit.  
8.4. Efficacy Evaluations 
Efficacy assessments include:  
• Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI)  
• Daily Tinnitus Annoyance NRS  
• Daily Tinnitus Loudness NRS  
• Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) 
• Short Form 12 ( SF-12) Hea lth Survey  
Subjects who use hearing aids, noise generators, and/or sound therapy devices should continue to 
do so during the study and should complete the tinnitus assessments and ratings (i.e., TFI, daily 
tinnitus annoyance NRS, daily tinnitus loudness NR S, PGIC, and SF-12) based on their tinnitus 
experience with the devices in use.  Only stable tinnitus treatments (i.e., started  at least 1 month 
prior to Screening ) are allowed during the study and no new treatments should be introduced. 
The TFI should be completed at the beginning of each visit prior to other study assessments.  The 
recommended order in which study questionnaire assessments are conducted is: TFI, PGIC, 
SF-12, and C- SSRS (the C- SSRS is administered  after all efficacy questionnaires have been 
 
 30 Otonomy, Inc. OTO -313-201 Protocol V3.0: 20 July 2021  completed ).  The daily tinnitus  loudness and annoyance NRS should be completed at home on 
the study visit days. 
8.4.1. Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI)  
The TFI  is a validated, 25-item questionnaire that can be used to s cale overall severity of tinnitus 
and to assess treatment- related change in tinnitus ( Meikle et al., 2012; Henry et al., 2015).  The 
25 items of the TFI represent 8 subscales covering multiple domains of tinnitus severity : 1) 
Intrusive, 2) Sense of Control, 3) Cognitive, 4) Sleep, 5) Auditory, 6) Relaxation, 7) Quality of 
Life, and 8) Emotional.  Sub jects answer  each TFI question by [CONTACT_861954].   
Completing the TFI provides an index score from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing a 
greater problem with tinnitus.  A reduction in the TFI index score of 13 points or more is considered clinically meaningful improvement in tinnitus ( Meikle et al., 2012).    
Subjects will complete the TFI  at Screening, Baseline (pre-dose), and Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16. 
The TFI should completed at the beginning of each study visit.  
8.4.2. Daily Tinnitus Annoyance Numeri c Rating Scale ( NRS )  
Subjects will record their tinnitus annoyance using a tinnitus NRS diary.  Numeric rating scales 
have been widely used to assess tinnitus severity and have demonstrated good test- retest 
reliability and concordance with other subjective measures of tinnitus ( Meikle et al. 2008).  
Subjects rate their tinnitus annoyance over the past 24 hours.  Subjects respond to the following 
question by [CONTACT_861955] a scale of 0 (Not annoying) to 10 (Extremely annoying):  “In the past 24 hours, 
how annoying was your tinnitus?”. 
Subjects eligible at screening will begin using the tinnitus NRS  diary at the start of the 14-day 
Lead-in period to record their tinnitus annoyance every day and  will continue to record their 
tinnitus annoyance once per day through  the 16- week  Follow Up period.  Subjects will be able to 
record missed diary entries for 1 day after a missed entry.  Compliance with the tinnitus NRS  
diary  will be monitored  throughout the study with re -training,  as necessary . 
8.4.3. Daily Tinnitus Loudness Numeric Rating Scale ( NRS ) 
Subjects will record their tinnitus loudness using a tinnitus NRS diary.   
Subjects rate their tinnitus loudness over the past 24 hours.  Subjects respond to the following 
question by [CONTACT_861956] s loudness 
on a scale of 0 ( No tinnitus ) to 10 (Extremely loud tinnitus ):  “In the past [ADDRESS_1201958]?”. 
Subjects eligible at screening will begin using the tinnitus NRS diary at the start of the 14-day 
Lead-in period to record their tinnitus loudness every day and will  continue to record their 
tinnitus loudness once per day through the 16- week  Follow Up period.  Subjects will be able to 
record missed diary entries for 1 day after a missed entry.  Compliance with the tinnitus NRS 
diary will be monitored throughout the study with re -training,  as necessary.  
 
 31 Otonomy, Inc. OTO -313-201 Protocol V3.0: 20 July 2021  8.4.4. Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)  
The PGIC  is a patient -reported outcome that evaluates the change in overall “global” tinnitus 
status as perceived by [CONTACT_423]  (Adamchic et al. 2012;  van de Heyning et al. 2014 ).  The 
subject is asked: “Since the beginning of the clinical study, how would you rate your tinnitus ?”.  
The beginning of the clinical study in this context is the time prior to investigational product 
administration.  The 7 response categories (and point scores) for the PGIC are:  
• Very much improved = 3 
• Much improved = 2  
• Minimally improved = 1 
• Unchanged = 0  
• Minimally worse = -1 
• Much worse = -2 
• Very much worse = -[ADDRESS_1201959] s will complete the PGIC at  Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16.  
8.4.5. Short Form 12 ( SF-12) Health Survey  
The SF-12 is a validated, multipurpose short form survey of 12 questions, all selected from the 
SF-36 Health Survey ( Ware et al . 1996).  The questions are weighted and scored to create two 
subscales, physical and mental hea lth composite scores,  as well as an overall health- related 
quality of life score. 
Subjects will complete the SF -12 at Baseline (pre-dose), Week 8 , and Week 16. 
8.5. Safety Evaluations  
Safety assessments include: 
• Adverse events (see Section  9) 
• Concomitant Medications 
• Vital S igns  
• Clinical Laboratory Test s (Hematology , Serum Chemistry , and Urinalysis )  
• Otoscopy  
• Audiometry 
• Tympanometry 
• C-SSRS Assessment  
 
 32 Otonomy, Inc. OTO -313-201 Protocol V3.0: 20 July 2021  8.5.1. Vital Sign s and Height/ Weight Measurements  
Vital sign s measurements (including systolic and diastolic blood pressure , pulse rate , body 
temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] ) will be collected at Screening, Baseline  (pre-dose), Week [ADDRESS_1201960] been seated for 5 minutes and while subjects are 
in a sitting position.   
8.5.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
All clinical laboratory tests (except for urine pregnancy) will be processed by a Central 
Laboratory. 
Non-fasting blood samples and urine samples for hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, and 
pregnancy tests will be prepared using standard procedures.  Clinical laboratory testing will be completed at Screening, Baseline (pre-dose) and Week 8.  In 
addition, female subje cts of childbearing potential will have serum pregnancy test for human 
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) at Screening  and a urine pregnancy test (hCG) at Baseline (pre-
dose) and Week 16.  The urine pregnancy tests will be performed locally at the site , so resul ts are 
available that day.  
The blood and urine samples will be used for the following tests: 
Hematology : hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, white blood cell count  with 
differential, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular 
hemoglobin concentration, and platelet count. 
Serum chemistry : albumin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate 
aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl -transpeptidase, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, 
calcium, chloride,  creatinine, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, phosphorus, potassium, 
sodium, total bilirubin, and total protein. 
Urinalysis : appearance, color, pH, specific gravity, protein, glucose, ketones, nitrite, 
leukocyte esterase, urobilinogen, and microscopic sediment examination.  
8.5.3. Otoscopy 
Otoscopic exams will be used to assess the auditory canal, the appearance of the tympanic 
membrane, and the healing of the intratympanic injection site.  Presence and size of tympanic 
membrane perforations will be recorded.  Perforations of the tympanic membrane will be 
captured as AEs if the perforation does not resolve by [CONTACT_861957].     
Otoscopic examinations will be performed by [CONTACT_861958] (pre -dose) and in study ear only at Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16.  
8.5.4. Tympanometry 
Tympanometry assessments will be used to assess the mobility and compliance of the tympanic 
membrane, pressure and volume in the outer ear canal, and function of the tympanic membrane, 
ossicles and Eustachian tube.   
 
 33 Otonomy, Inc. OTO -313-201 Protocol V3.0: 20 July 2021  Tympanograms will be completed in both ears at Screening  and Baseline (pre-dose)  and in study 
ear only at Weeks 4, 8, [ADDRESS_1201961] be conducted in accordance with American -Speech -Language-
Hearing Association Guidelines ( ASHA, 2005).  Equipment calibration must be current and 
documented.  The audiometric assessments must be conducted by a licensed or certified 
audiologist or a qualified assistant with appropriate training under the direct supervision of a licensed or certified audiologist.  
Audiograms are conducted at 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz for air conduction and at 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz for bone conduction at all study visits.  Both air and bone conduction thresholds will be assessed.  Subjects wearing hearing aids should be instructed not 
to wear their hearing aids during the audiogram. 
Audiometry will be used to assess hearing function in both ears at Screening  and Baseline (pre-
dose) and in study ear only at Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16.   
8.5.6. C-SSRS Assessment  
The rater- administered Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C- SSRS) is a scale that captures 
the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors du ring the 
assessment period ( Posner 2011).  Otologic conditions are sometime s associated with anxiety or 
depression, requiring prospective assessment of suicidal ideation to ensure patient safety.  This is 
true whether or not a particular product is known or suspected to be associated with treatment -
emergent suicidal ideation and /or behavior.   
The C -SSRS scale includes questions to solicit the type of information needed to determine if a 
suicide-related thought or behavior occurred.  The C- SSRS must be admi nistered by 
[CONTACT_861959].   
The C- SSRS assessm ent will be administered at Screening, Baseline (pre-dose) and Weeks 4, 8, 
12, and 16.   
• The “ Baseline” version of the C- SSRS will be used at Screening.   
• The “ Since Last Visit ” version will be used  at Baseline (pre-dose), and Weeks 4, 8, 12 
and 16 or premature termination.   
At Screening or Baseline (Day 1) visits, s ubjects are to  be excluded (per  Exclusion C riterion 8 ) 
if: 
• subject answered “Yes” to Question 4 or 5 regardi ng active suicidal  ideation ,  
• subject was deemed by [CONTACT_861960] , or  
• subject had a positive score or report of new suicida l ideation or suicid al behavior on the 
“Since Last Visit” version .  
The Investigator should record medical history of suicidal ideation or n on-suicidal s elf-injurious 
behavior a t Screening or Baseline (Day 1) visits if: 
 
 34 Otonomy, Inc. OTO -313-201 Protocol V3.0: 20 July 2021  • subject has a post- Screening score of 1 -3 for Ideation (i.e., a “yes” answer to Questions 
1, 2, or 3), o r  
• subject has responded “yes” to the Non -Suicidal Self- Injurious Behavior question and 
the score is higher than the Screening C -SSRS score . 
At post-dose visits (Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16), the Investigator is to record an AE and assess use 
and dose of concomitant antidepressant medication ( Section 7.2) if : 
• subject has a positive score or report of new suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior, 
• subject has a C -SSRS score of 1-3 for Ideation (i.e., a “yes” answer to Questions 1, 2, or 
3), 
• subject has a “yes” response to the Non -Suicidal Self- Injurious Behavior question and the 
score is higher than the “Baseline” C -SSRS score . 
At post-dose visits (Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16) the Investigator is to record a Serious Adverse Event 
(SAE)  and assess use and dose of concomitant antidepressant medication ( Section 7.2 ) if: 
• subject has any post- Baseline C-SSRS score of 4 or 5 for Ideation (i.e., a “yes” answer to 
question 4 or 5), and/or  
• any questions answered yes for Suicidal Behavior (with the exception of a “yes” response to the Non- Suicidal Self-Injurious Behavior question), and this was not observed at pre-
dose testing . 
SAE information is reported as indicated in Section  9.2.2.   
Subjects reporting new suicidal ideation or behavior can be managed by [CONTACT_861961], at the discretion of the 
Investigator.   It is advised that subjects be referred to trained specialists for the treatment of 
depression, at the discretion of the Investigator.   
Suicidality information is to be reported using the following possible AE terms: suicidal plans, 
suicidal ideation, suicidal tendency, suicidal behavior, suicidal intention, suicidal depression, active suicidal ideation, passive suicid al ideation, self -injurious behavior without suicidal intent.  
9. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 
Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analysis of safety information from clinical trials will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice. 
Adverse even ts will be monitored and documented starting during and after administration of 
investigational product until study participation is complete.  
All AE s and serious adverse events (SAEs)  that are reported or observed during or after dosing 
with the investigational product will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF for all enrolled 
subjects.   
Information to be collected includes description  of event, affected ear (for ear -related events 
only), date of onset, Investigator- specified assessment of the severity and relationship to 
investigational product, relationship to the intratympanic injection, date of resolution of the 
 
 35 Otonomy, Inc. OTO -313-201 Protocol V3.0: [ADDRESS_1201962] also be reported.  Perforations of the tympanic membrane 
will be captured as AEs if the perforation does not resolve  by [CONTACT_861962]. 
If the existing medical condition worsens at any time after the injection  (e.g., requires 
intervention or treatment), it should be recorded as an AE (e.g., worsening tinnitus [identify L, R, 
or both ears]). 
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_861963].  However, if an observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a 
component of a specific disease or syndrome by [CONTACT_737], it should be recorded as a 
separate adverse event on the eCRF.  Additionally, the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, or transfusion) should be recorded as an 
adverse event, not the procedure. 
Laboratory abnormalities are not considered AEs unless they are associated with clinical signs, 
symptoms or require med ical intervention.  Laboratory values considered to be clinically 
significant may be more extreme than values that are simply outside normal ranges.  A clinically significant finding on an examination (e.g., vital signs) or laboratory abnormality (e.g. det ected 
on clinical chemistry or hematology), present at screening and significantly worsens, and 
requires medical or surgical intervention, or leads to study drug interruption or discontinuation - 
should be reported as an AE.  Any abnormal test that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an adverse event.  
9.1. Adverse Event Classification Definitions  
Adverse Event:  
An AE is any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign, syndrome, or disease which 
occurs after administration of investigational product, having been absent at baseline, or, if 
present at baseline, appears to worsen.  
This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the 
baseline condition, including abnormal results of diagnostic procedures and/or laboratory test 
abnormalities, which are considered AEs if they: 
• result in discontinuation from the study  
• require treatment or any other therapeutic intervention  
• require further diagnostic evaluation (excluding a repetition of the same p rocedure to 
confirm the abnormality) 
• are associated with clinical signs or symptoms judged by [CONTACT_95334] a significant clinical impact  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  
 
 36 Otonomy, Inc. OTO -313-201 Protocol V3.0: [ADDRESS_1201963] medical occurrence that: 
• results in death, 
• is life -threatening (Note: the term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event rather than to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.),  
• requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited repor ting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_861935].  These events 
should be considered serious. 
9.1.1. Assessment of Severity  
The I nvestigator will assess the intensity of the AE and rate the AE as mild, moderate, or severe 
using the following criteria:  
Grade 1 – Mild: These events are easily tolerated, require minimal or no treatment, and do 
not interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
Grade 2 – Moderate:  These events cause sufficient discomfort to interfere with daily 
activity and/or require a simple dose of medication, e.g., analgesics or anti -emetics.  
Grade 3 – Severe:  These events incapacitate and prevent usual activity or require complex 
medication/treatment or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Grade 4 – Life Threatening:  These events are those for which the subject was at risk of 
death at th e time of the event rather than an event which hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe.  
Grade 5 – Death:  The event resulted in the death of the subject. 
Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented to allow for an assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of intensity to be performed.  
9.1.2. Assessment of Causality  
The I nvestigator will assess the relationship or association of the investigational product and the 
study procedure ( intratympanic injection ) in causing or contributing to the AE, which will be 
characterized using the following classification and criteria:  
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention, there is a reasonable 
possibility that the study intervention caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship 
between the study intervention and event.  Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study intervention and the AE.  
 
 37 Otonomy, Inc. OTO -313-201 Protocol V3.0: 20 July 2021  • Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
intervention caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study 
intervention and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established. 
9.1.3. Follow up of Adverse Events  
The I nvestigator will follow a non -serious AE until resolution, stabilization, o r the End of Study 
Visit.  The Investigator will follow an SAE (regardless of relationship to investigational product 
or study procedure) until the event resolves, stabilizes, or becomes non- serious.  All AEs 
identified on the last scheduled contact [CONTACT_861964] (ongoing or resolved) will be noted.  In addition, SAEs will be reported to Medpace Clinical Safety ( emai l: medpace- [EMAIL_1925]) according to the 
reporting guidelines identified in  Section  9.2.2. 
9.2. Monitoring of Adverse Events  
9.2.1. All Adverse Events 
All AEs will be analyzed for safety.  Those meeting the definition of SAE must be reported using 
the SAE Form  within the electronic data capture system eC RF.  Subjects should voluntarily 
report any AEs or report AEs in response to general, non-directed questioning (e.g., "How has 
your health been since the last visit?").  For each AE volunteered by [CONTACT_423], the I nvestigator 
should obtain all the informa tion required to complete the AE page of the eCRF, in accordance 
with the guidelines that accompany it. 
All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity, or presumed relationship to investigational product 
or to study procedure, must be recorded using medical terminology in the source document and 
on the eCRF.  Whenever possible, diagnoses should be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology (e.g., cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should 
be reported as "upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]").  Investigators must record on the eCRF their 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_861936].  All measures required for AE management must be recorded in the source document and 
reported according to Sponsor instructions. 
Any non- serious AE that occurs after administration  of investigational product must be reported 
in detail on the appropriate eCRF page and followed until resolution, stabilization, or the End of 
Study Visit.  The description of the AE will include description of event, date of onset, date of 
resolution, I nvestigator assessment of severity and relationship to investigational prod uct and to 
study procedure (with rationale), seriousness  (with rationale), any required treatment or 
evaluations, and outcome  (e.g., fatal, not resolved, resolved, resolved with sequelae, unknown).  
The Sponsor assumes responsibility for appropriate reporting of AEs to the regulatory authorities.  The S ponsor will also report to the I nvestigators all SAEs that are unlisted in the 
Investigator’s Brochure and associated with the use of the investigational product.  The 
Investigators must report these events t o the appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB) or 
Ethics Committee (EC) in accordance with local regulations.  
 
 38 Otonomy, Inc. OTO -313-201 Protocol V3.0: [ADDRESS_1201964] provide the minimal information: i.e., protocol number, subject's initials  
and date o
f birth, subject number or medication code number, nature of the AE and 
Investigator’s attribution.  
The cause of death of a subject in a clinical study , whether the event is expected or associated 
with the investigational product , is an SAE.  
All oral reports of an SAE must be confirmed within [ADDRESS_1201965] until the SAE has subsided or until the condition becomes chronic in nature , stabilizes (in the case of persistent impai rment) or the 
subject dies.  Within [ADDRESS_1201966] update 
the SAE form electronically in the EDC system for the study and submit any supporting documentation (e.g., subject discharge summary) to Medpace Clinical Safety via Fax or email.  
If it is not possible to access the EDC system, refer to the procedures outlined above for initial 
reporting of SAEs.  
All SAEs that have not resolved by [CONTACT_2054], or that have not resolved upon 
discontinuation of the subject's participation in the study, must be followed until either: 
• the event resolves,  
• the event stabilizes, or  
• the event becomes non-serious. 

 
 39 Otonomy, Inc. OTO -313-201 Protocol V3.0: [ADDRESS_1201967] be 
reported and followed to outcome.  The I nvestigator should complete the Exposure In Utero 
form within one (1) working day of knowledge of the pregnancy.  The pregnancy will be 
followed until information of the final outcome becomes available and a follow -up Exposure in 
Utero form is  completed.  Spontaneous abortions should always be reported as SAEs.   
10. SUBJECT COMPLETION 
10.1. Completion  
Study subject participation is complete  after Week 16 (Visit 6).  Subjects who discontinue the 
study before completion of Week 16 (Visit 6 ) will  not be considered to have completed the 
study. 
10.2. Study Discontinuation  
All subjects have the right to withdraw from study evaluations at any time, for any reason, 
without prejudice; nonetheless, Investigators should attempt to encourage subjects to complete 
the protocol so that continued observation and follow-up measurements may be obtained.   
Subjects may be discontinued from the study for any of the following:  
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Lost to Follow-up 
• Adverse Event 
• Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_21781]  
• Sponsor de cision  
• Protocol deviation  
• Other  
At any point, the Investigator may discontinue the subject’s study participation at the discretion 
of the Investigator or at the request of the subject, and ensure the subject receives appropriate 
medical care; the Investigator may also consult the medical monitor to discuss out- of-range test 
results.  
10.2.1. Handling of Withdrawals 
Subjects will be free to withdraw from the study, including discontinuing investigational product administration, and further follow- up of the study at any time.   
Should a request for early withdrawal from the study with no further follow -up be made, the 
subject should be encouraged to return to the study site for a last follow up visit and undergo all End-of-Study/ Early -Termination assessments.  
 
 40 Otonomy, Inc. OTO -313-201 Protocol V3.0: [ADDRESS_1201968] withdraws from the study prior to completing the End -of-Study Visit, the reason 
for withdrawal is to be documented on the eCRFs and in the source document. 
10.2.2. Replacements 
Subjects who discontinue participation in the study for any reason after dosing will not be 
replaced.   The sample size was estimated to account for an assumed discontinuation rate of 15% 
by [CONTACT_10585] 8 . 
11. STATISTICAL METHODS  
11.1. Introduction  
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study will 
be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  The SAP may appropriately  modify the 
analyses specified in the protocol, as necessary.  
11.2. Analysis Sets 
The a ll enrolled set will include all subjects who sign an informed consent form.  
The full analysis set (FAS) includes all randomized subjects,  and they will be included in the 
group to which they were randomized. 
The per- protocol analysis set (PP) includes all subjects in the full analysis set that provide TFI 
data at Weeks [ADDRESS_1201969] a 13 -point reduction from baseline in the TFI overall

11.4. Statistical Analyses  
11.4.1. General  
There will be two sets of analyses.  The Primary analyses will be conducted after all subjects 
complete Week [ADDRESS_1201970] deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values. 
Descriptive statistics for categorical variables will include number of observations and percentages.  
11.4.2. Efficacy Analyses 
All efficacy endpoints will be summarized descriptively and analyz ed using FAS. The primary 
endpoint will also be summarized descriptively and analyzed using PP.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Analyses 
The primary endpoint is the percent of responders at Week 8, where s ubjects will be classified as 
responders if they achieve at least a [ADDRESS_1201971] controlling for study site, 
duration of tinnitus, and baseline TFI overall score.  Specifically, comparison between OTO -313 
and placebo will be made b y testing the following hypothesis: 
H
0: P OTO-313  = P Placebo  vs H A: P OTO-313  ≠ PPlacebo  
 
 42 Otonomy, Inc. OTO -313-201 Protocol V3.0: [ADDRESS_1201972] and an alpha level of 5%.  The 95% confidence intervals (CI) around the common 
risk difference will also be provided.  
Missing data for the primary endpoint will be imputed using a multiple imputation technique that 
will be described in detail in the SAP.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Secondary Analyses 
Secondary endpoints of the change from baseline in NRS Annoyance score, NRS Loudness score, TFI overall score, TFI subscale scores, PGIC, and SF-12 will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_6982].  
There will be no adjustment of multiplicity across s econdary endpoints. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Additional  Responder Analyses 
The following additional responder definitions will also be derived for Weeks 12 and 16:  
• Week 12 responder #1: achieving at least a 13-point reduction from baseline in the TFI 
overall score at Weeks 8 and 1 2 
• Week 12 responder #2: achieving at least a 13-point reduction from baseline in the TFI 
overall score at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 
• Week 16 responder #1: achieving at least a 13-point reduction from baseline in the TFI overall score at Weeks 12 and 16  
• Week 16 responder #2: achieving at least a 13-point reduction from baseline in the TFI 
overall score at Weeks 8, 12, and 16 
• Week 16 responder #3: achieving at least a 13-point reduction from baseline in the TFI 
overall score at Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16 
These additional responder  secondary endpoints will be analyzed  in the same manner as the 
primary analysis as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Continuous Endpoint Analyses  
The change from baseline in NRS Loudness, NRS Annoyance, TFI Total score, each TFI 
subscale score, and SF- [ADDRESS_1201973] -
square adjusted means, the estimated difference in adjusted means between treatment groups  and 
associated 95% CIs will be provided. 
[IP_ADDRESS].3. Categorical Endpoint Analyses  
The results of the PGIC  will be analyzed using a Cochrane -Mantel -Haenszel mean score test 
controlling for study site, baseline TFI score, and duration of tinnitus. This will be done to compare 
OTO-313 with placebo. 
 
 43 Otonomy, Inc. OTO -313-201 Protocol V3.0: 20 July 2021  11.4.3. Safety Analyses 
All safety endpoints will be summarized descripti vely using the safety analysis set. If descriptive 
summaries warrant further exploration of comparisons between treatment groups, then additional 
safety analyses may be conducted in an  ad hoc  manner. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events  
The primary analysis of AEs will consider only treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs), 
events occurring for the first time, or worsening during or after the first dose of investigational product.  Subject incidence of TEAEs and SAEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_179009] (PTs) and 
System Organ C lass (SOC).  Severity and relationship to investigational product will also be 
presented.  For summary tables, a subject who experiences the same coded event more than once 
is counted only one time for that coded event at the highest severity level.  AEs w ill be presented 
by [CONTACT_861965]. 
Listings of all SAEs, AEs leading to study withdrawal, and deaths on-study will also be included.  
Duration and outcome of each AE will be reported in subject listings.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Tympanometry, Otoscopic, and Audiometry  
The tympanometry category (A, B-small volume and/or normal, B- large volume, or C) will be 
summarized by  [CONTACT_67486]. 
Observations recorded during the conduct of otoscopic exams will be descriptive in nature.  The 
number and percent of subjects presenting with each otoscopic classification will be provided by [CONTACT_67486].  Where relevant, the number and proportion of subjects with 
changes in their otoscopic classification from Baseline to the endpoint visit will also be provided 
for each treatment group.   Presence and absence of tympanic membrane perforations will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_67486] ; the size of any tympanic membrane perforation 
will be classified as  follows: pi[INVESTIGATOR_21828]; ≤25%  of tympanic membrane ; 25% to ≤50% of tympanic 
membrane ; >50% of tympanic membrane .   
Descriptive summary statistics for audiometric assessments of air and bone conduction 
thresholds at each frequency will be provided by [CONTACT_67486]. All audiometry 
assessments will be tabulated separately for the treated and untreated ear.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
The C -SSRS will be administered at each visit using the appropriate version i.e., “Baseline” or 
“Since Las t Visit”.   
The “Baseline” version of the C -SSRS captures both suicidal ideation and suicide behavior 
(lifetime).  There are 5 suicidal ideation questions, each captured as yes/no for the subject’s 
lifetime.  There are 4 suicidal behavior questions, each captured as yes/no for the subject’s 
lifetime.  An additional question asks if suicidal behavior is present during the visit.  All suicidal ideation and behavioral variables as outlined here will be tabulated overall and by [CONTACT_6490]. 
The C -SSRS versi on used at visits subsequent to the Baseline Visit will be a modified version of 
the “Baseline” C -SSRS.  This “Since Last Visit” version uses the same individual variables for 
 
 44 Otonomy, Inc. OTO -313-201 Protocol V3.0: 20 July 2021  suicidal ideation and behavior assessed at Baseline to capture changes, if any, from previous 
assessments.  In addition, overall suicidality (yes/no) will be defined as any suicidal ideation or 
behavior since the last visit.   
All suicidal ideation and behavior variables will be tabulated overall and by [CONTACT_861966] a shift t able for interpretation of changes in C -SSRS results between baseline and 
post- baseline assessments.   All C -SSRS data will be included in data listings.  
11.4.4. Concomitant Medications  
Incidence of concomitant medications of interest will be provided for each treatment group. The list of concomitant medications of interest will be provided in the SAP.  
11.4.5. Laboratory Parameters, Vital Signs and Weight 
The analysis of laboratory parameters and vital signs will include descriptive statistics for the 
change from baseline to the endpoint visit, change from Baseline for each visit (vital signs only).  Where appropriate, analyses will also include shifts from Baseline to the endpoint visit.  For 
laboratory values, the normal ranges will be used to determine the classifications.  Values below 
the normal range will be classified as low, values above the normal range will be classified as high, and values within the normal range will be classified as normal.  
11.5. Sample Size 
The primary endpoint is the percentage of responders, where response is defined as achieving at 
least a 13 -point reduction from baseline in the TFI t otal score at both Week s 4 and 8.  It was 
observed from the previous study (Study 313-201901) that the response rate for OTO -313 (0.32 
mg) was 43% and 13% for placebo.  Based on these results, the assumed rate of response for OTO-313 is 43% and 18% for placebo, which is the 13% observed response rate in previous study plus 5% inflation for potential placebo response.  
Assuming a 2-sided test and level of significance of 0.05, 60 subjects in the placebo arm and 60 subjects in each of the OTO -313 arms will provide approximately 85% power to detect a 
treatment difference in favor of OTO -313.  It is also assumed that an observed discontinuation 
rate of 15% will be observed, hence the total sample siz e is planned to be [ADDRESS_1201974] adminis tered to subjects will be OTO -313 and placebo.  OTO -313 is 
supplied as a 1  mL sterile solution (1.6 mg/mL [0.16%] gacyclidine in medium-chain 
triglycerides) in a vial.  Placebo is provided as a 1 mL sterile solution of 100% medium -chain 
triglyceride s in a vial.  The vials are provided as kits, and a ll kits must  be stored at 2-8°C until 
use. 
 
 45 Otonomy, Inc. OTO -313-201 Protocol V3.0: [ADDRESS_1201975] kits will be labeled with information that will meet the applicable 
regulatory requirements.  
12.3.2. Labels and Labeling Instructions  
A label will be affixed to each kit box indicating kit number and storage instructions.  A label 
will be affix ed to the OTO-313 and placebo vials indicating contents and storage instructions.   
12.4. Management of Clinical Supplies  
The clinical supplies will be managed by [CONTACT_861967] ; instructions will be provided to all 
sites.  The IRT  will create shipment requests  that will be generated based on inventory thresholds 
that are set for each site.  A shipment request will be generated by [CONTACT_861968].  Upon shipment and receipt of the clinical study  material, the site personnel will 
acknowledge the shipment and identify any damaged, missing, or unusable kits so they will not 
be dispensed. 
12.4.1. Storage of Kits  
All kits will be stored in accordance with instructions on the investigational product label.  Al l 
temperature excursions of the investigational product must be documented in the investigational 
product accountability log.  Any excursions within the allowable temperature range and 
conditions should be documented, but the investigational product is sti ll acceptable for use and 
dispensing to subjects.  If any excursions are outside of these conditions, the investigational 
product should not be used to treat subjects.  If this occurs, the individual preparing the 
investigational product should immediately quarantine the product and report the kit(s) as unacceptable for dispensing to IRT  to remove it from inventory. 
12.5. Investigational Product Accountability  
It is the  responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that all investigational product received at the 
site will be  inventoried and accounted for throughout the study and the result recorded on the 
drug accountability form maintained in the Pharmacy Manual.  The person responsible for preparing the syringe contain ing the investigational product will be instructed to return all 
original containers, whether empty or containing investigational product, when instructed by [CONTACT_861969].  Investigational product returned by [CONTACT_861970]'s instructions.  Investigational product accounta bility 
will be verified by [CONTACT_374791].  Investigational product will be stored in a 
limited access area or in a locked refrigerator under appropriate environmenta l conditions.  
 
 46 Otonomy, Inc. OTO -313-201 Protocol V3.0: [ADDRESS_1201976].  Appropriate documentation will be maintained.  Permission may 
be granted for local disposal , with supporting documentation. 
13. ETHICAL ASPECTS 
13.1. Investigator Responsibilities  
The In vestigator is responsible for ensuring that the clinical study is performed in accordance 
with the protocol, the Declaration of Helsinki, as well as with the Note for Guidance on Good 
Clinical Practice (ICH/135/95), and applicable regulatory requirements.  These documents set 
forth that the informed consent of the subjects is an essential precondition for participation in the clinical study.   Activities  assigned to the Investigator may be delegated by [CONTACT_861971], training, and experience.  Delegation should be documented in the delegation log. 
13.2. Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Ethics Committee (EC)  
This study will be undertaken only after full approval of the protocol and addenda has been obtained from a designated IRB or EC and the Sponsor has received a copy of this approval. 
The IRB or EC must be informed of all subsequent protocol amendments issued by [CONTACT_941] S ponsor. 
Reports on, and reviews of, the study and its progress will be submitted to the IRB  or EC by [CONTACT_246628].  
13.3. Informed Consent 
Each subject must give written consent and sign other locally required documents after the nature 
of the study has been fully explained.  The consent form is typi[INVESTIGATOR_861937] 
(Visit 1) and must be completed prior to performance of any study-related activity.  The consent 
form that is used must be approved both by [CONTACT_861972] .  The 
informed consent is  in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, current International 
Conference for Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, an d Sponsor 
policy. 
 
 47 Otonomy, Inc. OTO -313-201 Protocol V3.0: [ADDRESS_1201977]'s dated signature [CONTACT_28513] f orm.  If a subject is unable to read, an impartial witness must be present 
during the entire informed consent discussion.  The signature [CONTACT_861988] f orm will certify the subject's consen t.  The subject should receive a signed and 
dated copy of the informed consent form. 
14. ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS  
14.1. Protocol Modifications  
All protocol amendments must be issued by [CONTACT_1034], signed and dated by [CONTACT_737], 
and should not be implement ed without prior IRB  or EC approval, except where necessary to 
eliminate immediate hazards to the subjects or when the change(s) involves only logistical or 
administrative aspects of the study (e.g., change in monitor, change of telephone number).  
Respons ibilities for reporting protocol amendments to any Regulatory Authority (if applicable) 
and/or IRB or EC are further described in the Ethical Aspects section of the protocol.  
In situations requiring a departure from procedures defined in the protocol, the Investigator or other physician in attendance will contact [CONTACT_861973], Medical Monitor, or other 
appropriate Sponsor representative by [CONTACT_166932] (see Sponsor Contact [CONTACT_23774]).  If possible, this contact [CONTACT_861974].  
In all cases, contact [CONTACT_861975].  The eCRF and source document will describe any deviations from procedures defi ned in the protocol and the circumstances requiring such 
deviations. 
14.2. Regulatory Documentation  
There are essential documents that must be provided to the Sponsor at the beginning of the study 
that will enable the site to be initiated and to receive investig ational product.  In some cases, 
there may be new documents required or the initial essential documents will be updated during 
the course of the study.   
Essential documents include but are not limited to curriculum vitae for each Investigator and 
sub-Investigator, documentation of IRB or EC protocol approval and associated subject consent 
documents, signed clinical trial agreement, and signed protocol.  The Sponsor or its 
representatives will work with the sites to identify, collect, review, and approve the appropriate 
documentation package. 
 
 48 Otonomy, Inc. OTO -313-201 Protocol V3.0: [ADDRESS_1201978] Retention 
In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines , the I nvestigator or institution will maintain all 
eCRFs and all source documents that support the data collected from each subject .  All study 
documents specified in Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial (ICH E6) and the 
applicable regulatory requirement(s)  will also be collected from each subject .  The I nvestigator  
or institution will take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these 
documents.  Essential documents must be retained until at least two (2) years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region or after at least two  (2) years have elapsed 
since the formal discontinuation of cl inical development of the investigational product.  These 
documents will be retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_861976].  I t is the responsibility of the S ponsor to 
inform the Inves tigator or institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.  
If the responsible Investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the responsibility of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_8090], custody must be transferred to a qual ified person 
who will a ccept the responsibility.  The Sponsor must be notified in writing of the name, address, 
and qualifications of the new custodian. 
14.4. Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF)  
eCRFs will be completed by [CONTACT_861977].  Access for data entry will be provided to designated site staff.  All data must be entered into the eCRFs in English and signed and dated electronically by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator.   
The eCRFs should be completed by I nvestigator site staff at the time of the subject's visit, with 
the exception of results of tests performed outside the Investigator's office, so that the eCRFs  
always reflect the latest observations on the subjects participating in the study.  
As the site staff enters data, discrep ancies will be automatically generated within the Electronic 
Data Capture (EDC) system for the site staff to resolve immediately.  In addition, as a result of 
data review by [CONTACT_16015], manual queries will be raised electronically in the EDC 
system.  Queries may also be raised as a result of source data verification by [CONTACT_24653].  
All corrections will be mad e within the EDC system by [CONTACT_456055].  The clinical monitor and data management teams will ensure appropriate resolution of queries.   The I nvestigator must authorize changes to the efficacy and  safety data  
recorded in the EDC system .  
14.5. Termination  
Closure of a center or study termination can be initiated at any time by [CONTACT_1034] , provided 
that reasonable cause and sufficient notice are given in advance of the intended termination.  
Reason s for such action taken by [CONTACT_861978], but are not limited to: 
• Successful completion of the study at the center  
• The maximum number of eligib le subjects for the study (study -wide or specific to a 
center)  
• Failure of the Investigator to comply with the protocol, the S ponsor's procedures, or 
GCP guidelines 
 
 49 Otonomy, Inc. OTO -313-201 Protocol V3.0: 20 July 2021  • Safety concerns  
• Inadequate recruitment of subjects by [CONTACT_737] 
• Business reasons 
14.6. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
The Sponsor shall promptly review all information relevant to the safety of the drug obtained or 
otherwise received from foreign or domestic sources, including information derived from this 
clinical study and any other clini cal study conducted wi th OTO -313.   
The medical personnel of the Sponsor and clinical research organization ( CRO) will have the 
ability to review blinded safety information as it is entered and verified in the EDC system (Section  14.4).  A ll AEs coded to the System Organ Class of ear and laby[CONTACT_861979] (MedDRA) will be reviewed  for significa nt safety 
trends at least every other month .  Reasons for study discontinuation will be reviewed to 
determine if any trends in study discontinuation, such as the occurrence of speci fic SAEs or 
worsening of symptoms, are identified.  
Investigators are instructed to contact [CONTACT_861980] 24 hours following the identification of a SAE ( Section  9.2.2).  Al l SAEs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_941] S ponsor and CRO medical personnel 
within [ADDRESS_1201979] 25% (35 subjects), 50% (70 subjects), and 75% (105 subjects) of subjects randomized and 
who have post- administration safety data.  Blinded s afety data including adverse events, 
concomitant medications, medical history, clinical safety laboratory measurements, audiometry, 
otoscopy, tympanometry, and C- SSRS data will be reviewed.  The treatment assignment for an 
individual subject may be unblinded, if deemed necessary to enable medical care or study 
decision-making by [CONTACT_7244].  The decision to continue with the study will 
be based recommendations from the Safety Review Committee on the clinical significance of 
any adverse even ts or suspected investigational product -related or procedure -related findings.  
Additional information on the Safety Data Review and composition of the independent Safety 
Review Committee is provided in the Safety Review Committee Charter.   
 
 50 Otonomy, Inc. OTO -313-201 Protocol V3.0: 20 July 2021  14.7. Monitoring  
The Sponsor or its representatives will perform monitoring visits (on- site and/or remote as 
permitted by [CONTACT_427]) as frequently as necessary based on site activity to review 
protocol compliance, compare eCRFs with individual subject’s medical records and clinic charts, 
and ensure that the study is being conducted according to pertinent regulatory requirements.  The 
dates of the visits will be recorded by [CONTACT_413774] a study center visit log to be kept at the site.  
Monitoring visits will be made according to the Clinical Monitoring Plan.   
Prior to site screening of the initial subject, site -specific source documents will be compared to 
the eCRF, and any findings will be discussed with the Investigator. 
At all visits, the monitor will compare the data entered onto the eCRFs with the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43718] (source documents)  in accordance with the Clinical Monitoring Plan.  The review of 
medical records will be performed in a manner that ensures subject confidentiality is maintained.   
At a minimum, source documentation must be available to substantiate proper informed consent 
procedures, adherence to protocol procedures, adequate reporting and follow -up of AEs, 
administration of concomitant medication, drug receipt/dispensing/return records, and investigational product administration information.  The Sponsor expects that, during monitoring visits, the I nvestigator (and as appropriate, the study coordinator) will be available, the source 
documentation will be available, and a suitable environment will be provided for review of study-related documents. 
14.8. Data Quality Assurance 
Steps to be taken to assure the accuracy and reliability of data include the selection of qualified Investigators and appropriate study centers, review of protocol procedures with the Investigator and associated personnel prior to study initiation, and periodic monitoring visits by [CONTACT_861981].  eCRFs will be reviewed for accuracy and completeness in the EDC system 
database by [CONTACT_941] S ponsor or its  representatives during and after on-site monitoring visits, and any 
discrepan cies will be resolved with the Investigator or designees, as appropriate, and documented 
in the EDC system.  
14.9. On-Site Audits  
Representatives of the S ponsor's Quality Assurance department or designee may visit the site to 
carry out an audit of the study in compliance with regulatory guidelines and company policy.  
Such audits will require access to all study records, including source documents, for insp ection 
and comparison with the eCRFs.  Subject privacy must, however, be respected.  Sufficient prior 
notice will be provided to allow the Investigator to prepare properly for the audit. 
Similar auditing procedures may also be conducted by [CONTACT_861982] a Licensing Application.  The Investigator should 
immediately notify the S ponsor if they have been contact[CONTACT_426] a regulatory agency concerning 
an upcoming inspection. 
14.10.  Publication Policy 
Publication of study results is addressed in the clinical trial agreement.

2) IRB Review History* 
N/A 
3) Objectives* 
Our goal is to test safety. 
The purpose of this dose-escalation study is to assess the safety and 
tolerability of scAAV2-P1ND4v2 (abbreviated as AAV-ND4) gene 
replacement therapy in subjects confirmed with the G11778A mutation in 
mtDNA responsible for Leber’s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy. Ocular and 
systemic toxicity will be assessed following vector administration to 
determine if there are adverse changes that may be associated with vector 
administration. 
This first-in-man (FIM) clinical trial will assess safety, tolerability, and 
potentially efficacy of a single intravitreal injection in patient groups 
reflecting the acute, presymptomatic and chronic stages and 
manifestation of the LHON disease.  
 
          Aim 1. To Evaluate the Safety of AAV-ND4 in subjects with long-
standing bilateral acuity loss (Group 1). Phase I will consist of an open-
label, unilateral single-dose, intravitreal injection of AAV-ND4 per subject 
in a dose-escalation study investigating the safety of four vector doses 
(Low: 1.18 x109 vg*, Medium: 5.81.x 109vg*(*based on CHOP titers as 
recommended by [CONTACT_8415]), High: 2.40x1010 vg and Higher: 1x1011 vg) in 
subjects with molecularly confirmed G11778A-mutated mitochondrial 
DNA.  The bilateral chronic group will include patients with ≥[ADDRESS_211809] acuity reduced to ≤ [ADDRESS_211810] ≥12 months since onset, the eye with worse visual acuity will be

 Page 2 of 54  Revised: Feb. 9, [ADDRESS_211811] onset will 
be injected. If one eye has <12 months and >6month since onset and the 
difference in acuity between the eyes is ≤10 letters, the eye with ≥[ADDRESS_211812] an acuity difference >10 letters, the 
eye with worse acuity will be injected. 
 Aim 2. To Evaluate the Safety of AAV-ND4 in subjects with acute 
(<12 months) bilateral loss of visual acuity to < 35 ETDRS letters (Snellen = 
20/200) (Group 2). The eye with worse acuity will be injected.  
           Aim 3.  To Evaluate the Safety of AAV-ND4 in subjects with unilateral 
loss of acuity to <[ADDRESS_211813] “good acuity” ≥ 70 letters 
(20/40 Snellen) in the contralateral eye (Group 3). The eye with better 
acuity will be selected for injection. 
For each group, administration of study drug will follow an adaptive plan 
to identify the maximum tolerated dose. If none of the three subjects at a 
given dose level develops a major toxicity, the next cohort will receive the 
next higher dose. We will wait a minimum of [ADDRESS_211814] in 3 
subjects of Aim I, before moving on to testing this low dose in Aim 2, then 
lastly in Aim 3. Safety will be monitored for loss of 15 letters in Aims 1 and 
2, but a difference of 15 letters worse in the treated eyes relative to 
untreated eyes for Aim 3. If acuity, and visual field testing demonstrate no 
toxicity in Aims 1 and 2, we will proceed with Aim 3. 
The objective  of this proposed clinical trial is to evaluate the safety of 
mitochondrially targeted ND4 gene therapy with the adenoassociated viral 
vector in appropriate LHON patients in a Phase I clinical trial.  If warranted 
by [CONTACT_99412] I trial, another aim will be to obtain a 
preliminary estimate of the therapy’s efficacy. We provide a summary of 
the extensive preclinical testing in relevant rodent animal models to 
support the efficacy of the approach proposed in this clinical trial. 
The primary hypothesis  being tested is there will be no systemic toxicity or loss of 
vision to No Light Perception in the injected eye.  
 
4) Background* 
Background and Significance 
Leber’s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) is a maternally inherited form 
of bilateral optic neuropathy causing severe and permanent visual loss in 
young adults, usually between the second and fourth decades of life. LHON 
IRB Study Number: 20140248 
Version #13, Date: 2-9-2019 
 
 
 Page 3 of 54  Revised: Feb. 9, 2019  
 usually presents as a loss of central vision that typi[INVESTIGATOR_179976], until bilateral central scotomas and visual loss remain. 
Visual loss may occur in both eyes simultaneously, or in one eye with the 
fellow eye affected weeks to months later. The deterioration of vision may 
progress over several months to a maximum loss of function which 
stabilizes at visual acuities worse than 20/200. 
Characterization of the hereditary nature of LHON led early researchers to 
postulate that it was a disorder of mitochondrial inheritance. Molecular 
analysis has confirmed that the basic etiology results from a point 
mutation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Three primary mutations at 
nucleotide pair 3460, [ZIP_CODE], and [ZIP_CODE] are generally agreed to be the 
primary causes of LHON, accounting for 98% of LHON cases. All primary 
LHON mutations alter mtDNA-encoded protein subunits, which comprise 
NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) of the mitochondrial 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_35226]. Therefore, it is generally hypothesized that a 
dysfunctional respi[INVESTIGATOR_179977]. While 
the relationship between genotype and phenotype appears 
straightforward, the selective clinical presentation observed in LHON 
patients indicates a complex pathogenesis. Although a primary LHON 
mutation is necessary for the expression of the disease, it is unclear how 
the mutations interact with other genetic and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_179978].  
To date an effective treatment for LHON has not been identified. 
Anecdotal reports of treatment efficacy have been difficult to interpret 
given the potential for spontaneous recovery in certain genotypes. 
Treatments including systemic steroids, hydroxycobalamin, cyanide 
antagonists, and naturally occurring cofactors (e.g., coenzyme Q10, 
succinate and idebenone) have not produced definitive evidence of 
treatment or prevention of visual loss. 
We have taken an alternative approach for correcting point mutations in 
mitochondrial protein-coding genes—by [CONTACT_180016] N-terminal targeting sequence for 
mitochondrial import. Most mitochondrial proteins are in fact made this 
way and are transported into the organelles after their translation on 
cytoplasmic polyribosomes.  The mechanism of their import and assembly 
has been a popular research topic for over [ADDRESS_211815], 
mitochondrial translation employs a partially different genetic code than 
the nuclear-cytoplasmic system, and second, some mitochondrial proteins 
may be too hydrophobic to be imported and properly assembled outside

 Page 4 of 54  Revised: Feb. 9, [ADDRESS_211816] obstacle can be addressed by [CONTACT_180017], an approach coined “allotopic expression”. This 
process involves using overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_179979], choosing codons that permit high-level 
translation ~ or using in situ mutagenesis to change codons that differ 
between the mitochondria and nucleus.  The second problem is more 
difficult.  
Our investigative team headed by [CONTACT_180018] a ''nuclear version" of the mitochondrial gene (ND4) then 
targeted the cytoplasmically synthesized protein to the mitochondria by 
[CONTACT_2329] a targeting sequence appended to the reading frame (allotopic 
expression). When delivered to cultured cells containing a mutant ND4 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_179980].  Recently our group showed in vivo 
allotopic ND4 expression is safe in rodents and primates suggesting it may 
be useful in LHON patients.  
In previous work, we have made major strides towards determining the 
pathogenesis and testing a treatment for LHON. First, we discovered that 
G11778A ND4 mutant cells have a severe reduction in ATP synthesis, even 
though mild reductions in complex I activity appear insufficient to induce 
disease. Since no technology existed to introduce DNA directly into 
mitochondria, we overcame this deficiency in oxidative phosphorylation 
by [CONTACT_2164] a "nuclear version" of the mitochondrial gene then 
targeted the cytoplasmically synthesized protein to the mitochondria by 
[CONTACT_2329] a targeting sequence appended to the reading frame (allotopic 
expression). When delivered to cultured cells containing a mutant ND4, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_179980]. Next, we created a bona fide animal 
model for LHON. Using site directed mutagenesis of the nuclear version of 
ND4 we replaced the codon for arginine to that for histidine at amino acid 
340. Injection of this construct into the mouse visual system disrupted 
mitochondrial cytoarchitecture, elevated reactive oxygen species, induced 
swelling of the optic nerve head and induced apoptosis, with a progressive 
demise of ganglion cells in the retina and their axons comprising the optic 
nerve. In contrast, ocular expression of the wild-type human ND4 subunit 
appeared safe, suggesting that it may be useful for treatment of patients 
with LHON. Here by [CONTACT_180019], we will begin the journey towards genetic therapy for human optic 
neuropathy and mitochondrial disease. 
In summary, LHON is a worthy target for mitochondrial gene therapy that 
we are proposing here by [CONTACT_180020] a normal ND4 gene. While

 Page 5 of 54  Revised: Feb. 9, 2019  
 other experimental approaches such as importing genes from other 
species, changing the ratio of heteroplasmy with specific restriction 
endonucleases, selecting for respi[INVESTIGATOR_179981] (in 
muscle), none of these techniques is directly applicable to the treatment 
of LHON caused by 100% mutated mtDNA. We propose to apply gene 
therapy to a human disease caused by [CONTACT_180021]. Success here may 
have implications well beyond these initially targeted patients and organ 
systems besides the eye.  
 
rAAV Human Clinical Trials: General and Specific Experience 
The NIH Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System 
(GeMCRIS®) (http://www.gemcris.od.nih.gov/) currently lists 9 active 
clinical trial protocols involving rAAV gene transfer in a number of different 
diseases, including ophthalmic disorders. Administration of the vector is 
by a wide variety of different routes, such as aerosolized inhalation, 
intramuscular, intrahepatic, intracerebral and intraocular injections. 
Specific background for this proposed protocol includes the human rAAV 
studies performed at the University of [LOCATION_012]. The University of [LOCATION_012] 
(UF) Powell Gene Therapy Center’s core facilities and investigators have 
substantial experience in current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) 
production of rAAV vectors and in the performance of Phase I clinical trials 
of rAAV vectors in humans. Among the first human trials with rAAV for any 
disease were those performed by T.R. Flotte, which began in November, 
1995, with [CONTACT_180100] as PI [INVESTIGATOR_179982] (later at the University of [LOCATION_012]), 
beginning in July,1996. The several Phase I and II clinical studies (using 
rAAV2 instilled in nose or maxillary sinus or by [CONTACT_180022]), 
completed or in progress, in cystic fibrosis (CF) show no significant vector-
related toxicity. These studies have included individuals from ages [ADDRESS_211817] has been very well-
tolerated in these human subjects and there is clear evidence of the 
feasibility of gene transfer. There is a trend to indicate that the vector is 
biologically active for the correction of chloride secretion.  Further relevant 
background to the current proposal is the human study at the University 
of [LOCATION_012] using a rAAV2-CB-hRPE65 vector with intraocular administration 
to clinical subjects [56]. The production and purification protocol of the 
cGMP vector for the proposed LHON clinical trial will be essentially 
identical to that used for the currently active Phase I trial of rAAV2-CB-
hRPE65 vector with 2 differences. Here we used a self complementary AAV 
containing both positive and negative strands with 3 tyrosine to

 phenylalanine modifications in the VP3 AAV capsid to increase the speed 
and efficiency of transgene expression. Unlike RPE 65 mutations causing 
Leber’s congenital amaurosis that have slowly progressive visual loss since 
childhood, LHON presents with acute visual loss. Therefore, speed and 
efficiency of transgene delivery are critical in LHON. 
A summary of findings from preclinical studies 
Preclinical studies of scAAV2-P1ND4v2  by [CONTACT_180023]-of-principle studies in a mouse model, and safety studies 
to evaluate the potential for toxicity and the biodistribution of intravitreal 
rAAV-ND4 in normal rats and normal non-human primates. 
Proof-of-Principle Studies:  
To demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the gene therapy vector to be 
used in the Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy gene therapy (LHON) 
clinical trial, we modified the ND4 subunit of complex I in the nuclear 
genetic code for import into mitochondria.  The protein was targeted into 
the organelle by [CONTACT_180024] a targeting sequence. The gene was packaged 
into adenoassociated viral (AAV) vectors, then vitreally injected into 
rodents, primates and ex vivo human eyes that were tested for expression 
and integration by [CONTACT_180025]. Animals were followed by [CONTACT_180026], 
OCT, multifocal or pattern ERGs. Rescue of visual loss was tested in rodent 
eyes also injected with a mutant G11778A ND4 homologue responsible for 
most cases of LHON. FLAG-tagged human ND4 expressed in almost all 
mouse retinal ganglion cells a week after injection and it integrated into 
the rodent complex I. Furthermore, in mouse eyes also injected with a 
mutant ND4, wild-type ND4 prevented defective ATP synthesis, 
suppressed visual loss, reduced apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells and 
prevented demise of axons in the optic nerve.  ND4 injected into the ex 
vivo human eye expressed in most retinal ganglion cells. Primate(s) 
vitreally injected with untagged wild-type ND4 and followed for [ADDRESS_211818] article, rescue of the LHON mouse model and the severe 
irreversible loss of retinal ganglion cells in LHON support clinical testing in 
our patients with mutated G11778A mitochondrial DNA.

Conclusions from Safety Studies 
Studies in rats and non-human primates described above suggest that 
intravitreal administration of scAAV2-P1ND4v2 at doses of up to 2.46 x 
1010 vector genomes: 
(a) Do not lead to any acute or long term ocular pathology, 
(b) Do not lead to any systemic toxicity by [CONTACT_180036], and 
(c) Do not lead to significant vector spread (migration) beyond the 
eye/optic nerve (target site) in the vector-injected eye (treatment).  
All the safety data at hand shows no observed adverse effect level of up to 
2.46 x 1010 vector genomes in primates. This suggests that translation of

 scAAV2-P1ND4v2 to human trials should be safe. However, we plan to take 
a conservative approach to dosing in man by [CONTACT_180037] a vector dose equivalent to 1 log unit below this level – 
at 5.[ADDRESS_211823] 
relevant are studies performed at the University of [LOCATION_012]’s Powell Gene 
Therapy Center. These trials include several Phase I and II clinical studies 
in individuals with cystic fibrosis   with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, with 
RPE65-associated retinal disease. Overall, to date, results indicate no 
significant vector-related toxicity and demonstrate the feasibility of gene 
transfer. Potential risks associated with scAAV2-P1ND4v2 and the study 
procedures are discussed below. 
Specifically associated with intravitreal-injections of scAAV2-P1ND4v2, 
there is a risk of degeneration of lens and cataract formation in the injected 
eye. Detachment of the retina is also possible. 
There is a potential risk of vector spread to other organs. In our safety 
studies, all major organs of rats and primates were essentially negative (≤ 
100 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ug genomic DNA) for vector. Our biodistribution results after 
scAAV2-P1ND4v2 (intravitreal) administration to rats and non-human 
primates indicate only limited vector spread outside the injected eye and 
no evidence of a vector dose-related effect. The risks of vector spread and 
germline transmission (all gonad samples were negative) are therefore 
presumed to be low in the planned human trial. 
There is a risk that subjects may develop an immune response to the 
vector. Our neutralizing antibody assay data from scAAV2-P1ND4v2 
administration in large animals suggests that the risk of adverse immune 
response in humans is minimal. It is possible, but unlikely, that scAAV2-
P1ND4v2 could interact with other viruses with which the subject comes 
in contact, forming a new virus that could produce new side effects.  
In preclinical studies, there was minimal ocular inflammation which 
subsided with time after administration; in one animal of the non-human 
primate studies. Administration of corticosteroids and antibiotics

the subject at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_179983]. In animal 
and human studies to date, cancer has not developed and therefore, the 
risk is considered to be low. In our preclinical work with the AAV vector, 
the majority of vector DNA appears to persist as epi[INVESTIGATOR_179984], which makes it very unlikely that 
mutagenesis and tumor development will occur. 
Intravitreal administration of scAAV2-P1ND4v2, as mentioned above, 
carries a risk of retinal cell loss from administration trauma. There is also a 
risk of cataract development that could require additional surgery. There 
is a risk of retinal tears or retinal detachment and there is the possibility 
that these could lead to worse vision. Exogenous intraocular infection 
(endophthalmitis) is rare but can occur. The most common pathogens can 
be treated but poor vision (in patients with better vision than those 
entering this study) can result from infection despi[INVESTIGATOR_179985]. Intraocular hemorrhage is rare in patients without bleeding 
diathesis. Vitreous hemorrhage is benign and usually resolves 
spontaneously. Choroidal or subretinal hemorrhage is usually self-limited 
and could affect vision (or potential vision) significantly. Temporary 
increases in intraocular pressure can occur following ocular/retinal 
injections and are treatable with topi[INVESTIGATOR_179986]. Risk of anesthesia, which is local (retrobulbar) is low. There 
is a small risk of penetration of the eye or optic nerve from retrobulbar 
injection and also the possibility of hemorrhage, which can be 
decompressed if necessary Patients have complained of feeling a burning 
or painful sensation in the injected eye after the anesthesia wears off. In 
addition to these risks, there may be other longer-term risks which are not 
known. 
In addition to these risks, there may be other longer-term risks which are 
not known. 
Benefits: Due to the initial, safety establishing nature of this investigation, 
there is no anticipated benefit to the subjects in this trial.

 The route of administration, dosage, dosage regimen, and treatment 
period(s) proposed in this protocol is based on several considerations.  The 
preclinical studies have been performed with the clinical vector.  Only 
single injections have been made across the rodent and primate studies 
with a few exceptions.  The dose delivered has varied as different 
parameters such as transfection efficiency and toxicity were explored. 
Using naïve rodents we found that injections into uninjured ocular tissue 
are well tolerated. Doses of up to 1.[ADDRESS_211825] 
treatment, intravitreal administration of vector genomes (of up to 2.46 x 
1010 vector genomes) in  one or both eyes was well tolerated. No ocular or 
retinal abnormalities were observed and only mild and transient post-
injection vitreal changes were observed. No vector related clinical 
chemistry changes were observed, and no vector or treatment related 
trends were seen in the complete blood count analyses. Daily clinical 
observations detected no vector-related findings, and body weight 
measurements were stable or gradually increasing in all animals.  
Assessments of ocular health by [CONTACT_180038]-related abnormalities. At sacrifice, there were no gross 
or microscopic findings that were related to administration of the vector. 
Vector genomes were not present in any non-target tissues, with the 
exceptions of low levels in spleen of the 2 vector-injected animals and in 
the mandibular lymph nodes of two other animals. 
The frequent study visits and safety assessments in year’s 1-[ADDRESS_211826]-
injection and the long-term follow-up will assure substantial opportunity 
for observation for adverse events and efficacy signals. 
 
 
Use of Adeno-associated Virus (AAV) and Recombinant AAV

been isolated and cloned currently. None of the AAV serotypes has been 
associated with any human disease. AAV serotype [ADDRESS_211828] growth factor receptor (FGF-R) or the v-5 integrin 
molecule.  
The AAV life cycle is quite unusual. Cells infected with AAV and a helper 
virus (or another adjunctive agent, such as UV irradiation or treatment 
with genotoxic agents) will undergo productive replication of AAV prior to 
cell lysis, which is induced by [CONTACT_180039]. Human cells 
infected with AAV alone, however, will become persistently infected. This 
latency pathway results in colinear integration of AAV sequences within 
the host cell genome, within a specific site on human chromosome 19, the 
AAVS1 site. While this site is not strictly homologous to AAV, it contains 
consensus elements required for binding and nicking by [CONTACT_180040], a non-structural protein that is also involved in productive 
replication and in transcriptional regulation of the virus. Once AAV is 
integrated, it will remain stable within infected cells for prolonged periods 
of time, up to 100 passages.  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_179987]. If latently infected 
cells are subsequently infected with a helper virus, the genome will be 
excised and productive AAV replication and packaging will ensue.   
 Recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors have been developed by [CONTACT_180041] a transgene of interest. The ITR sequences 
must be retained in rAAV since these serve as origins for viral DNA 
replication and contain the packaging signals. The maximum packaging 
capacity of rAAV is approximately 5kb, including the ITRs, the transgene, 
its promoter, and polyadenylation signal. The full exploitation of rAAV for 
gene transfer has been limited in the past primarily by [CONTACT_180042]. In particular, contamination of rAAV vector 
preparations with wild-type AAV has been found to alter the biological 
behavior of the vector, and limitations on the titers and infectivity of the 
vectors have limited their widespread use in the past. Advances in the 
packaging and purification technology have resulted in a dramatic 
improvement in the expression levels that have been achievable in vivo.  
rAAV vectors are uniquely suitable for in vivo gene transfer for genetic and 
metabolic disorders, since they are non-toxic, highly efficient when used 
at high titers, relatively non-immunogenic, and very stable in their pattern 
of expression. The utility of rAAV vectors for in vitro and in vivo gene

(alpha 1 antitrypsin) vectors given via the portal vein to adult mice or via 
superficial temporal vein to neonatal mice will result in long-term 
expression of high levels of hAAT. In fact, a single dose of 3x1011i.u. of 
rAAV2-CB-AAT vector given intraportal to young adult mice resulted in 
expression levels in excess of 2 mg/ml (well above the threshold for 
therapeutic effect of 0.5 to 0.8mg/ml) that were sustained for over [ADDRESS_211830] shown that intravitreal injections of AAV serotype 2 efficiently

          Assessment of Primary Endpoint – Toxicity 
The primary safety endpoint  in this trial is the standard ocular 
examination. Toxicity will also be assessed by [CONTACT_180047], 
hematology and serum chemistries, assays for vector genomes, reported 
subject history of any symptoms and adverse events. 
Ocular. Routine eye examinations will be performed before and after 
vector administration, and surgeons administering the injections will be 
alert to injection administration related complications. The clinical ocular 
examinations for toxicity will include slit lamp examination, measurements 
of intraocular pressure (applanation tonometry or Tono-pen) and 
gonioscopy (as needed in cases of increased intraocular pressure to 
examine for anterior chamber abnormalities). Some potential ocular 
toxicities are included in Table 6-6 below. These are modifications of the 
Ocular/Visual Adverse Events tables of the Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE), considering the LHON patient population 
and the circumstances of the intervention. Direct and indirect 
ophthalmoscopy and biomicroscopy will be the mainstay of the retinal 
examinations. Fundus photography (with infrared illumination) will also be 
taken to document fundus appearance.   
Systemic.  Physical examination at regularly-scheduled time points will be 
performed by a medical practitioner to allow detection of and response to 
any acute symptoms. Complete blood count with differential, prothrombin 
time (with INR), partial thromboplastin time, serum chemistries, including 
measures of hepatocellular integrity and of renal function (including BUN 
and creatinine), and a urinalysis will be performed at baseline visit (serving 
also as a pre-injection evaluation) and on post-treatment evaluations. This 
testing will help detect toxicity in a number of organ systems. For research 
purposes measurements of neutralizing antibodies to human ND4 and AAV 
capsid components and cellular assays will be performed prior to and after 
vector administration as markers of the immune response. At each contact 
[CONTACT_1155], information will be obtained on adverse events by 
[CONTACT_179546]. Systemic toxicity will be graded based on the scale 
included in Table 6-6 and 6-7.

Detailed Study Procedures 
Informed Consent 
The use of the informed consent process will ensure that subjects are 
adequately informed about the study procedures and associated risks and 
benefits. An investigator will also provide complete explanation of the 
study to potential participants and will ensure that all questions are 
answered prior to decisions about participation. Participation in this 
clinical trial is completely voluntary and great care will be taken to ensure 
that individuals do not feel coerced to participate. Subjects will be able to 
terminate their participation at any time without prejudice. In order to 
assess the voluntary nature of participation in the study, a decision 
monitor will speak with all participants prior to beginning the study 
procedures.  
Complete History 
A detailed medical history will be obtained from each subject during the 
first baseline visit to ensure that exclusion from participation is not 
indicated.  
Physical Examination 
During baseline and post-vector administration evaluations, physical 
examinations will be performed. These exams will assess occurrence of 
systemic adverse events.  
Electrocardiogram, Chest X-ray  
12-lead electrocardiogram and chest X-ray will be performed at a baseline 
visit as part of the pre-vector administration evaluation. 
Hematology, Chemistries, Urinalysis, Coagulation Panel  
Complete blood count, with platelet count, serum chemistries including 
BUN, creatinine, electrolytes, liver function and coagulation panel tests 
IRB Study Number: 20140248 
Version #13, Date: 2-9-2019 
 
 
 Page 22 of 54  Revised: Feb. 9, 2019  
 will be obtained. Blood samples will be collected at baseline visit (serving 
also as a pre-vector administration evaluation) and during post-vector 
administration evaluations. This testing will help detect toxicity in a 
number of organ systems. In order to be eligible to participate, all women 
of childbearing potential must have two negative pregnancy tests within 
the month prior to study agent administration. 
Vital Signs Monitoring 
Following vector administration, subjects will be closely observed and vital 
signs (e.g. blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], and temperature) will be 
monitored. Subjects will be discharged after IOP is confirmed to be less 
than 30 mm. 
AAV Antibody and Antigen-specific Reactivity (ASR) Measurement (For 
Research Only) 
Measurements of neutralizing antibody titers to AAV2 capsid components 
and ASR assays will be performed at a baseline visit and during post-vector 
administration evaluations as markers of any systemic immune response 
to vector administration. 
Human ND4 Antibody (For Information Only) 
Currently, there is no human ND4 antibody available for detection of 
transgene expression. In preclinical studies, we used the FLAG tagged ND4 
for immunodetection. However, FLAG is not included in the clinical vector. 
Therefore, on a For Information Only basis, detection of antibodies against 
the human ND4 transgene will be attempted at a baseline visit and during 
post-vector administration evaluations as markers of a systemic immune 
response to the transgene ND4. Serum will be reacted against Western 
blots of human mitochondrial proteins before and after administration of 
scAAV2-P1ND4v2. Bands within this size range of P1ND4v2 (approximately 
50 kilodaltons) that develop post treatment will be excised and submitted 
for identification by [CONTACT_180049]4.  
Peripheral Blood Q-PCR (For Research Only) 
To detect vector spread, peripheral blood analysis for vector DNA by Q-
PCR will be performed at a baseline visit and following vector 
administration. If positive (>100 vg) testing will continue until two 
consecutive samples test negative. 
 Visual Acuity 
Visual acuity is an important outcome variable.  Visual acuity is measured 
before pupil dilation or any other technique that could affect vision. 
IRB Study Number: 20140248 
Version #13, Date: 2-9-2019 
 
 
 Page 23 of 54  Revised: Feb. 9, 2019  
 Refraction is performed prior to formal measurement of ETDRS visual 
acuity testing at all visits.  
Subjective Refraction: 
The use of a phoropter or trial frame is permitted to determine best-
corrected visual acuity.  The left eye is occluded first.  An approximate 
beginning refraction may be determined by [CONTACT_180050], automated 
refraction, or a subjective refraction from a prior visit.  The sphere is 
refined first.  The cylinder is then refined, first the axis followed by [CONTACT_180051].  Finally, the sphere is rechecked.  The right eye is then occluded, 
and the procedure is repeated for the left eye. 
If the patient wears contact [CONTACT_180052], he or she is 
instructed not to wear the contact [CONTACT_180053].  
In the event that the patient either has no glasses or has forgotten the 
instructions and reported for the assessment wearing contact [CONTACT_13276], the 
contact [CONTACT_180054]. 
ETDRS Visual Acuity: 
The logmar visual acuity testing has been adapted from the Early 
Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy (ETDRS).  The logmar visual acuity scale 
facilitates statistical analysis and simplifies quantification of acuity at 
various distances.  The right eye is tested with ETDRS logmar chart 1, and 
then the left eye is tested with ETDRS logmar chart 2.  Each chart is hidden 
from view until the eye being examined is ready for testing.   
The room illumination should be at a level of 50 to 100 foot candles, and 
between 50 and 125 foot candles should illuminate the ETDRS visual acuity 
chart.  The distance from the patient’s eye to the visual acuity chart is 
exactly 4.[ADDRESS_211839] be taken to 
ensure that the fellow eye remains covered. 
IRB Study Number: 20140248 
Version #13, Date: 2-9-2019 
 
 
 Page 24 of 54  Revised: Feb. 9, [ADDRESS_211840] distance of 4.0 meters 
are tested at 1.0 meter.  Before testing at 1.0 meter, +0.[ADDRESS_211841] six 
lines at 1.0 meter, so the maximum score attainable at that distance is 30.  
Correctly identified letters are circled on the ETDRS Visual Acuity 
Worksheet.  If the patient’s visual acuity is so poor that he or she cannot 
read the largest letter at 1.0 meter, assess his or her ability to count 
fingers.  After testing of the right eye is completed, chart 1 is replaced by 
[CONTACT_70963] 2 and the procedure is repeated for the left eye. 
Each letter read correctly and circled on the ETDRS Visual Acuity 
Worksheet is scored as one point.  The score for each line (which is zero if 
no letters were read correctly) and the total score is recorded after testing 
is completed.  If testing at 1.0 meter is not required (i.e. 20 or more letters 
were seen with testing at 4.0 meters), [ADDRESS_211842].  The total score, equaling the sum of the 4.0 meter 
and 1.0 meter scores, is recorded on the data form.   
Testing for Finger Counting: 
After proper instruction and refraction, the examiner’s hand is viewed at a 
distance of two feet from the patient’s eye.  The fellow eye is closed and 
completely occluded by [CONTACT_180055]’s or assistant’s hand.  The 
examiner presents a random number of fingers to the patient.  The patient 
is asked to indicate the number of fingers seen.  If the number of fingers 
shown is correctly identified on four or more of five presentations, vision 
is recorded as count fingers. If the number of fingers presented cannot be 
identified on four or more of five presentations, test for hand motions. 
Testing for Hand Motions: 
In testing for hand motion, the examiner’s hand is viewed with all fingers 
extended and separated at a distance of two feet from the patient’s eye.  
The fellow eye is closed and completely occluded by [CONTACT_180056]’s or assistant’s hand.  The patient’s glasses are not to be worn.  The 
examiner’s hand is presented in a random order under three conditions:  
stationary, moving back and forth horizontally, and moving up and down 
vertically.  The speed of movement is approximately one complete cycle of 
movement (up and down or back and forth) per second.  The patient is 
instructed that the examiner’s hand will be presented in one of these 
conditions.  He or she is asked to respond to the question, “what is my 
hand doing now?” with either, “still”, “back and forth”, or “up and down”.  
The process is repeated five times.  It is considered a correct response if 
the patient states the hand is still or he or she cannot see it while it is

perception. 
Testing for Light Perception: 
Light perception is tested using the same complete occlusion of the fellow 
eye with no other bright lights visible from the patient’s position.  The 
patient’s glasses are not worn.  The light of an indirect ophthalmoscope is 
directed into the eye from a distance of [ADDRESS_211844].  The patient is asked to report “on” when he or she sees 
the light, and “off” when it disappears.  The process is repeated five times 
in a nonrhythmic fashion.  The visual acuity is recorded as light perception 
if the patient responds correctly four or more out of five times. 
Perimetry 
Visual field assessment is an important outcome measure.  Quantitative 
automated perimetry is performed using the Humphrey Field Analyzer.  
Visual field testing is performed before any technique that could affect 
vision.  A visual field should be attempted in any eye that has sufficient 
vision to permit finger counting at two feet.  Eyes with poor central vision 
may have an intact, off-center island of vision which may be measured with 
perimetry. 
A 30-[ADDRESS_211845] Swedish 
Interactive Thresholding Algorithm (SITA) threshold strategy; the same 
testing strategy must be used throughout the duration of the study.  The 
pupil diameter should be 3 mm or greater before visual field testing is 
undertaken, and this may require pharmacologic dilation.  Standardized 
refraction is performed to determine the patient’s distance refraction and 
best-corrected visual acuity prior to visual field testing.  The age 
appropriate plus lens is added to the distance refraction.  Patient 
education is provided, and the instrument is set up for the test.  The 
technician should monitor fixation and patient responses during testing. 
Two HVF 30-[ADDRESS_211846] will be done at baseline with a minimum of 
30 minutes to 4 days between tests. 
 Pattern Electroretinography (PERG) 
The pattern electroretinogram (PERG) is a special kind of ERG that is 
generated when a high-contrast patterned stimulus (alternating stripes or 
checkerboards) is viewed on a TV monitor. The primary generators of the 
PERG are retinal ganglion cell (RGC), whereas the traditional flash ERG is 
IRB Study Number: 20140248 
Version #13, Date: 2-9-2019 
 
 
 Page 26 of 54  Revised: Feb. 9, 2019  
 generated in the outer retina. The PERG ─ but not the ERG ─ is altered in 
conditions that impair RGC function, and is abolished when RGC are 
degenerated. Therefore, the PERG has been extensively employed for 
detection and monitoring of RGC function in glaucoma and optic nerve 
diseases. Recently, a user-friendly protocol  for PERG recording (PERGLA)

implemented in a commercially available instrument (Lace Elettronica, 
Italy). As this protocol uses skin electrodes, is fast and reproducible, it has 
been rapi[INVESTIGATOR_179991] ─ 
including LHON  ─ and for testing the effect of treatments. In this proposal 
we will use the PERGLA protocol. 
A small patch (approximately 1 cm2) of the skin of the central forehead, of 
the temples, and lower eyelids is gently cleansed with electrode skin 
preoperative preparation pads (containing 70% isopropyl alcohol and 
pumice) to reduce skin impedance at less than 5000 Ohm. Five skin 
electrode cups (9 mm diameter) are filled with conductive jelly and taped 
(surgical tape, 1.5 × 1.5 cm) over the cleansed skin. The central forehead 
electrode is placed [ADDRESS_211847]’s eyes. To record the PERG, the subject fixates with both eyes on a 
target at the center of the pattern display. The television display is 
contained within a Ganzfeld bowl to provide a fixed amount of background 
adaptation (4 cd/m2). The pupi[INVESTIGATOR_179992].

Measurements of Intraocular Pressure: 
Measurement of intraocular pressure will be done by [CONTACT_180057]-pen 
instrument or by [CONTACT_180058]. The Tono-pen has a self-
calibration program. If it fails to calibrate another instrument that does will 
be used. The calibration of the Goldmann applanation tonometer is 
checked every 3 months, as described in the Haag-Streit Goldmann 
Applanation Tonometer Operator’s Manual.    The intraocular pressure of 
the right eye is always tested first.  Following instillation of a drop of 0.5%

 proparacaine, a fluorescein strip is placed near the lateral canthus in the 
lower conjunctival sac.  Once the lacrimal fluid has been sufficiently 
colored, the fluorescein strip is removed.  Alternatively, one drop of 
premixed fluorescein and anesthetic may be instilled.  The patient’s head 
is properly positioned in the chin rest and against the forehead rest 
without leaning forward or straining.  Any tight-fitting neckwear is 
loosened.  The patient is asked to look straight ahead at a distant object or 
fixation target.  If it is necessary to hold the eyelids open, the investigator 
holds the eyelids open against the orbital rim taking care not to apply any 
pressure on the globe.  The patient is instructed not to hold his or her 
breath.  If corneal astigmatism is greater than 3.[ADDRESS_211849] fashion

Lids: 
The lids are examined for signs of blepharitis, including scales and crusting 
of the lashes, inspi[INVESTIGATOR_179993], and erythema of the lid 
margin.   
Conjunctiva:

 The conjunctiva is examined for scarring from prior trauma or cicatrizing 
disease (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome, ocular pemphigoid).  The 
presence and extent of conjunctival scarring may be evaluated using a 
cotton tipped applicator to test the mobility of the conjunctiva.   
Cornea: 
The cornea is examined  to evaluate the epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], stroma, and 
endothelium.  The techniques of diffuse illumination, scleral scatter, and 
retroillumination may be used.  The presence of corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_179994].   
Anterior Chamber: 
Before fluorescein instillation or pupi[INVESTIGATOR_179995], the degree of anterior 
chamber cell and flare is determined.  Eyes with chronic or recurrent 
uveitis are excluded from the study.  Careful assessment of the anterior 
chamber depth is made after therapy.  If the anterior chamber is shallow, 
the central anterior chamber depth is measured relative to the corneal 
thickness.  The appropriate gradation of > 3 CT, > 2 CT, > 1 CT, < 1 CT, or 
lens-cornea touch is documented.   
Iris: 
Before pupi[INVESTIGATOR_179995], the pupi[INVESTIGATOR_179996].  If rubeosis iridis is 
present, the eye is ineligible for the study. 
Lens: 
After pupi[INVESTIGATOR_179995], the investigator assesses the lens and grades any 
cataract present as mild, moderate, or severe. 
Fundoscopic Examination: 
After pupil dilation with appropriate mydriatics, the vitreous will be 
assessed for determination of cell and flare and posterior vitreous 
detachment. The optic nerve and posterior pole are examined at the slit 
lamp using a Volk [ADDRESS_211850] ophthalmoscope and hand held condensing lens (20 
diopter or 28 diopter Nikon aspheric lens) is used to evaluate the retinal 
periphery. 
   Ocular Coherence Tomography (OCT) 
Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a noninvasive imaging technique 
that can be used to measure the thickness of retinal nerve fiber layer 
(RNFL). The pupi[INVESTIGATOR_179997]. 
OCT should be performed after all other visual function testing. A spectral-
domain Cirrus HD-OCT instrument (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) will be

 Page 29 of 54  Revised: Feb. 9, 2019  
 used to obtain circular peripapi[INVESTIGATOR_179998] (Fast RNFL protocol). This will 
include three 3.4 mm diameter retinal scans that will be averaged to 
provide the RNFL thickness at 256 points spaced along the circumference 
of the circular scan in each eye after dilation. The software provided with 
the instrument calculates average NFL thickness and compares it to a 
database of age-matched control subjects, for patients 15 years of age or 
older giving a percentile score relative to this control database. The 
average and sector (divided into nasal, temporal, inferior, and superior 
quadrants) measurements obtained for each patient’s affected and 
unaffected eye will be considered abnormal if ranked below the 5th 
percentile. OCT testing  will be performed by a trained technician. Macular 
OCT will be performed to assess for the presence of any cystoid macular 
edema or macular alteration.  Macular OCT also provides RNFL data in the 
macular region. 
The patient will be seated at the instrument and his/her chin is positioned 
on the chinrest. The following scans will be acquired on each eye: at least 
one acceptable 200x200 macular cube and one acceptable 200x200 optic 
disc cube. Each scan will be repeated until [ADDRESS_211851]. 
The operator will choose the type of scan to be performed from the 
available menu at the top of the screen. The patient will be asked to fixate 
on the internal fixation target. In cases of poor central vision, the patient 
may be unable to fixate on the internal fixation target. In these cases, the 
external fixation target should be presented to the fellow eye, and used to 
position the fovea centrally (macular cube) and nerve centrally (Optic Disc 
cube). The pupil is aligned in the center of the video image and the focus 
is adjusted by [CONTACT_180060]. 
The LSO fundus image is centered and focused. 
The OCT scan image is enhanced.  
The image is acquired clicking on the capture button. 
The operator will review all Cirrus HD-OCT scans as soon as they are 
acquired to ensure acceptable image quality, according to the criteria 
described above. If the image is deemed acceptable it will be saved, if not 
the operator will try again. 
The steps above are repeated to complete all the scans required.  
When the process is completed the operator will repeat the procedure to 
image the left eye.

 Page 35 of 54  Revised: Feb. 9, [ADDRESS_211856]’s medical care and will occur only as a result of participation in this 
study. Risks associated with radiation exposure of the magnitude in a chest 
X-ray are considered to be extremely low. 
 
Adequacy of Protection against Risks 
Recruitment and Informed Consent 
Many individuals and families with LHON have expressed interest and 
willingness to participate in a clinical trial. Additional volunteer participants 
will be recruited from patients of [CONTACT_180101][CONTACT_180065], University of Miami. We expect continued inquiries from newly 
diagnosed LHON patients and families who are interested in the research and 
clinical studies due to the protocol listing on GeMCRIS and widely-available 
genetic testing for retinal degeneration-associated genes.  
 
Before subjects are enrolled in this trial, an Informed Consent document will 
be approved by [CONTACT_180066]. An investigator will 
completely explain the study to potential participants. At the discretion of 
the potential participants, friends and/or family members will be included in 
these discussions. Subjects will be encouraged to ask questions prior to 
providing written informed consent. Participation in this clinical trial is 
completely voluntary and great care will be taken to ensure that individuals 
do not feel coerced to participate. Subjects will be able to terminate their 
participation at any time without prejudice. 
 
Protection against Risk  
The following procedures are likely to minimize the potential risks associated 
with study procedures.  
 
The medical history and physical examination performed prior to study agent 
administration will identify patients with medical or ophthalmic conditions 
that would increase the risks associated with study procedures. Those 
subjects will be excluded from participation. Surgical administration of the 
study agent will be performed in standard fashion by [CONTACT_180067]: 20140248 
Version #13, Date: 2-9-2019 
 
 
 Page 36 of 54  Revised: Feb. 9, 2019  
 surgeons and with strong attention paid to the risks listed above. 
Administration of topi[INVESTIGATOR_179999]. To minimize the risks of potential 
adverse events, following intravitreal injection, study subjects will be 
monitored and discharged only after their intraocular pressure (IOP) is less 
than [ADDRESS_211857] two pregnancy tests prior to administration and pregnant and 
breastfeeding females will be excluded from participation. Subjects (men and 
women) of reproductive ability will be required to use effective 
contraception for [ADDRESS_211858]’s family.   
 
Confidentiality of research materials obtained through this study will be 
maintained by [CONTACT_180068]. Patients included as subjects in 
reports or publications will be referenced with numbers. 
 
 
This is the first time study agent, scAAV2(Y444+500+730)-smCBA-P1ND4v2, 
abbreviated as scAAV2-P1ND4v2 , will be used in Humans.

Version #13, Date: 2-9-2019 
 
 
 Page 37 of 54  Revised: Feb. 9, 2019  
 The purpose of  this dose-escalation study is to assess the safety and 
tolerability of scAAV2-P1ND4v2 gene replacement therapy in subjects 
confirmed with the G11778A mutation in mtDNA responsible for Leber’s 
Hereditary Optic Neuropathy. Ocular and systemic toxicity will be assessed 
following vector administration to determine if there are adverse changes that 
may be associated with vector administration. 
 
This first-in-man (FIM) clinical trial will assess safety, tolerability, and 
potentially efficacy of a single intravitreal injection in patient groups reflecting 
the acute, presymptomatic and chronic stages and manifestation of the LHON 
disease.  
 
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), IND#[ZIP_CODE]  and National Institutes 
of Health/National Eye Institute (NIH/NEI) grant number: 1U10EY023558-
01A1, have approved this clinical trial.  
Sources of Materials 
Research materials obtained from human subjects related to this trial will 
include history and physical assessments, results of blood, urine, and LHON 
specific analyses, results of retinal and ophthalmic evaluations, AE reports, 
chest x-rays, electrocardiogram. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_3110], original test results, subject 
medical records, signed informed consent forms, correspondence, and all

 12)  Data Management * 
 
Study data will be managed by [CONTACT_180070] a separate 
National Eye Institute grant U10EY024247 which has already been I.R.B. 
approved (protocol 20140294, approval date 9-June-2014). The following is 
abstracted from that protocol. 
 
Assignment of Patient Identification (ID) Number 
The Baseline Qualifying Assessment establishes whether the patient satisfies the 
eligibility criteria.  If the patient appears to be eligible for the study, the Clinical 
Center (CC) completes the Qualifying Assessment Form and Pre-injection Form.  
Both forms are faxed to the Biostatistics Center (BC), along with a copy of the 
consent form.  The BC reviews each of the inclusion and exclusion criteria to 
ensure that the patient is eligible.  
Any patient who is confirmed by [CONTACT_180071] 1 Safety Study is assigned a patient identification (ID) 
number. The patient identification number is a [ADDRESS_211862] digit refers to the Group (1-3). The second 
digit refers to the dose (1=low, 2=medium, 3=high, or  4=higher).  The third digit 
is a sequential number for each patient.  The [ADDRESS_211863] patient enrolled 
with the high dose in group 2. 
 
  Data Management  
A master log is kept of each patient in the Study.  An appointment schedule is 
made for each patient and sent to the Clinical Center.  When a data form is 
received at the Biostatistics Center, it is processed for filing and data entry.  Each 
form is data entered by a data entry clerk and then verified by [CONTACT_180072].  Edit checks, such as missing data and out-of-range 
values, will be clarified within the Clinical Center.  
BC procedures provide for  
(i) CRF tracking and annotation  
(ii) Audit from source document to database  
IRB Study Number: 20140248 
Version #13, Date: 2-9-2019 
 
 
 Page 40 of 54  Revised: Feb. 9, 2019  
 (iii) Database design  
(iv) Data entry 
(v) Data validation 
(vi) Discrepancy management 
(vii) Database lock  
 
(i) The BC maintains a stand-alone patient log recording dates of enrollment 
and study visits as they occur, as well as documenting receipt of CRFs from 
the clinical center study coordinator. The BC will accept photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_180001]. 
Originals will be returned to the coordinator and the copi[INVESTIGATOR_180002]. The data entry operator inspects the forms visually for missing fields and 
reports these to the clinical coordinator who either supplies the missing data 
or provides an explanation for why the data were not collected. CRFs 
awaiting data entry are filed in the data entry operator’s office – access to 
this office is by [CONTACT_180073].  
 
 
(ii) A separate dataset and entry screen is provided by [CONTACT_180074]: Inclusion-Exclusion/Group Assignment, Adverse 
Event, AntiAAV Antibodies, Baseline / Follow Up Exam, Clinical Chemistry, 
Coagulation, Chest Xray Exam, Demographic Data, Electrocardiogram, 
Hematology, Injection/Treatment Day 0, Concomitant Medications, Vital 
Signs/Physical Exam, Serum Pregnancy, Urinalysis, NEI VFQ 25 Quality of Life 
Questionnaire. The family tree CRF is not data entered.  
 
(iii) Computer data entry will be performed in two stages. 
a. Initial data entry will be performed by [CONTACT_180075] 
21 CRF part 11 compliant Velos eResearch system which is maintained by 
[CONTACT_118743]’s Office of Research Information Management, 
which supports audit trails and controls access to the datasets.  
b. These data will be exported to IBM/SPSS data collection version 7, which 
supports two pass verification to foster data quality. Any errors found in 
the verification pass will be corrected in the Velos datasets and these 
corrections recorded with audit trails.  
As a further monthly check on database integrity, the current dataset will be 
compared with the previous month’s backup and differences will be 
reconciled. The CRFs are data entered and a subsequent verification data 
entry pass is performed, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], days or weeks later, after which the 
CRF copi[INVESTIGATOR_180003].  
 
IRB Study Number: 20140248 
Version #13, Date: 2-9-2019 
 
 
 Page 41 of 54  Revised: Feb. 9, 2019  
 (iv) Following entry, data will be subjected to range and consistency checks. 
Data entered from the CRFs are merged by [CONTACT_180076] a single 
record for each patient and these records are subjected to range and 
consistency checks by [CONTACT_4305]. Data entry errors uncovered 
in this way are corrected by [CONTACT_180077].  
 
(v) Similarly, data fields containing values demonstrated to be unlikely or 
impossible by [CONTACT_180078]. Necessary corrections are made and documented as with 
data entry errors. Interim versions of these data files are maintained for 
reference by [CONTACT_180079]. Any updates to the paper forms (i), based on this 
procedure are dated and made to the paper forms in a different color ink 
from that originally used to fill out the form.  
 
(vi) After a proper quality check and assurance, the final data validation is 
run. If there are no discrepancies, the datasets are finalized by [CONTACT_180080]. BC hardware and software will be 
identified and available for inspection by [CONTACT_180081].  
The BC ensures that safety events, systemic, ocular, and/or acuity loss (described 
below), are captured on study CRFs (Adverse Event and Follow Up Exam) and reported 
to the FDA, NEI, and DSMC. 
 
Data Security  
The paper data forms for the Study are kept in file cabinets in the Biostatistics facility in 
the  Dominion Tower.  The building is locked and access is by [CONTACT_180082].  A security 
guard is present during working hours.  The computer files for the study are kept on 
computers in the same location.  These rooms are kept locked when not in use, and the 
study computer files are password-protected as described in Resources.  The data files 
are backed up daily and are stored at a remote facility.  Computer data files used for 
publication are saved and stored as separate files. 
Data Forms 
The data forms will be designed to be self-explanatory.  Their completion should not 
require reference to separate information manuals.  The data forms contain information

Data Analysis 
The analysis of data will be performed by [CONTACT_180084].  He is the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_180004] 1 Safety 
trial, descriptive statistics with 95% confidence intervals around the success rates and 
the adverse event rates will be calculated.  To reiterate, the results of the ongoing 
monitoring of each patient’s course by [CONTACT_180085] (DSMC) will be evaluated to decide about continuing recruitment in this 
phase of the trial; statistical considerations will only provide guidelines. 
 
Assessments of change in visual acuity will be calculated from the Baseline [ADDRESS_211864] RNFL thickness as well as correlations between these measurements to the 
limited extent that this can be studied with such a small sample size.  Assuming that the 
earlier the stage, the more likely the benefit of treatment, we will examine and develop 
outcomes that can be used in later  phases and other trials that could include a wide 
range of these patients before the onset of permanent visual deficits.

supports further investigation.  Our previous power estimates were based on 
improvement by 15 letters and acuity of 20/[ADDRESS_211865] eyes of 
patients (Aim 1 and 2). The new endpoint, which drops the latter requirement, is more 
common in natural history but is assessed only on the [ADDRESS_211866] eyes eligible for Aim 1 and

13)   Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects* 
 
The DSMC is responsible for the ethical conduct of the study .  This 
committee oversees the informed consent process and major changes in the 
IRB Study Number: 20140248 
Version #13, Date: 2-9-2019 
 
 
 Page 44 of 54  Revised: Feb. 9, [ADDRESS_211867] twice each year for the duration of the study.  
Telephone conferences will occur as needed.  The responsibilities of the 
DSMC are as follows: 
 To review the study design and study documents before the start of the 
study to identify any problems that may affect patient safety 
 To monitor adherence to the study protocol  
 To review treatment reports prepared by [CONTACT_180087] 
 To terminate the study if treatment risk is so high that continuation of the 
trial is deemed unethical 
 To collaborate with the investigators on interpretation of study data. 
 To recommend changes to the study protocol based on periodic data analysis 
 To review and approve all publications and presentations 
 To determine when data collected in the study should be released to study 
investigators, study patients, the medical community, and the public 
 
14)   Withdrawal of Subjects* 
             
Subjects may withdraw or be withdrawn  from the study for any of the following 
reasons: 
 Occurrence of intolerable adverse events, including clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory findings which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], preclude further 
participation in the study; 
 Voluntary withdrawal by [CONTACT_3445]; 
 Subject non-compliance with study procedures; 
 Investigator decision that withdrawal from further participation would be in the 
subject’s best interest; 
 Instruction to terminate study by [CONTACT_30962], safety, institutional authorities or the 
DSMB. 
The reason for withdrawal will be documented for each subject. Subjects who 
withdraw due to an adverse event will be followed until the event has stabilized

15)  Risks to Subjects* 
     Summary of the known and potential risks and benefits to human subjects 
Subjects may experience burning or pain in the eye after the anesthesia given for 
the injection wears off.  This clinical trial is the first human study of scAAV2-
P1ND4v2 so the risks associated with vector administration are not precisely 
known. Based on our preclinical studies of scAAV2-P1ND4v2 in normal rats and 
normal non-human primates  there is a high likelihood that intravitreal 
administration of scAAV2-P1ND4v2 will be safe in humans. Safety of rAAV2 
vectors in humans is also supported by [CONTACT_180088]-going clinical trials. Most 
relevant are studies performed at the University of [LOCATION_012]’s Powell Gene Therapy 
Center. These trials include several Phase I and II clinical studies in individuals with 
cystic fibrosis   with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, with RPE65-associated retinal 
disease. Overall, to date, results indicate no significant vector-related toxicity and 
demonstrate the feasibility of gene transfer. Potential risks associated with 
scAAV2-P1ND4v2 and the study procedures are discussed below. 
Specifically associated with intravitreal-injections of scAAV2-P1ND4v2, there is a 
risk of degeneration of lens and cataract formation in the injected eye. 
Detachment of the retina is also possible. 
There is a potential risk of vector spread to other organs. In our safety studies, all 
major organs of rats and primates were essentially negative (≤ 100 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ug 
genomic DNA) for vector. Our biodistribution results after scAAV2-P1ND4v2 
(intravitreal) administration to rats and non-human primates indicate only limited 
vector spread outside the injected eye and no evidence of a vector dose-related 
effect. The risks of vector spread and germline transmission (all gonad samples 
were negative) are therefore presumed to be low in the planned human trial. 
There is a risk that subjects may develop an immune response to the vector. Our 
neutralizing antibody assay data from scAAV2-P1ND4v2 administration in large 
animals suggests that the risk of adverse immune response in humans is minimal. 
It is possible, but unlikely, that scAAV2-P1ND4v2 could interact with other viruses 
IRB Study Number: 20140248 
Version #13, Date: 2-9-2019 
 
 
 Page 46 of 54  Revised: Feb. 9, [ADDRESS_211869], forming a new virus that could produce 
new side effects.  
In preclinical studies, there was minimal ocular inflammation which subsided with 
time after administration; in one animal of the non-human primate studies. 
Administration of corticosteroids and antibiotics following intravitreal injection of 
the study agent is planned for this clinical trial to minimize the risk of local 
inflammation. There is potential that vision of subjects could be further reduced. 
Based on preclinical studies in animal models and in normal animals, the risk of 
further visual impairment due to scAAV2-P1ND4v2 is believed to be low. 
There is a chance that the study agent could damage the DNA in the cells of a 
subject’s retina. In the unlikely event that this occurred, it could put the subject at 
risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_179983]. In animal and human studies to 
date, cancer has not developed and therefore, the risk is considered to be low. In 
our preclinical work with the AAV vector, the majority of vector DNA appears to 
persist as epi[INVESTIGATOR_180005], which makes it very 
unlikely that mutagenesis and tumor development will occur. 
Intravitreal administration of scAAV2-P1ND4v2, as mentioned above, carries a risk 
of retinal cell loss from administration trauma. There is also a risk of cataract 
development that could require additional surgery. There is a risk of retinal tears 
or retinal detachment and there is the possibility that these could lead to worse 
vision. Exogenous intraocular infection (endophthalmitis) is rare but can occur. 
The most common pathogens can be treated but poor vision (in patients with 
better vision than those entering this study) can result from infection despi[INVESTIGATOR_180006]. Intraocular hemorrhage is rare in patients without 
bleeding diathesis. Vitreous hemorrhage is benign and usually resolves 
spontaneously. Choroidal or subretinal hemorrhage is usually self-limited and 
could affect vision (or potential vision) significantly. Temporary increases in 
intraocular pressure can occur following ocular/retinal injections and are 
treatable with topi[INVESTIGATOR_180007]. Risk of 
anesthesia, which is local (retrobulbar) is low. There is a small risk of penetration 
of the eye or optic nerve from retrobulbar injection and also the possibility of 
hemorrhage, which can be decompressed if necessary. In addition to these risks, 
there may be other longer-term risks which are not known.

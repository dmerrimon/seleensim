IRB APPROVAL DATE: 03/08/2024   1. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
Hypertensive diseases of pregnancy complicate around 10% of pregnancies. 
Preeclampsia is a pregnancy related hypertensive disorder. In the US during the past two decades the incidence of preeclampsia has increased by 25%. 
1The 
diagnosis of preeclampsia impacts the gestational age at delivery, with those with preeclampsia with severe features being delivered by 34 weeks gestational age, and those without being delivered by 37 weeks gestational age.
2 Preeclampsia is a major 
contributor to prematurity. Perinat al mortality is higher in infants of preeclamptic 
women regardless of gestational age at delivery. 3Causes are hypothesized as 
placental insufficiency and placental abruption, which in turn cause either intrauterine fetal demise, or early delivery. Preecla mpsia may also cause serious 
maternal adverse effects including: eclampsia (seizures), posterior reversible 
encephalopathy syndrome, placental abruption leading to disseminated intravascular 
coagulopathy amongst other maternal adverse outcomes. It is also associated with 
long term maternal health consequences, including long- term cardiovascular 
disease risk.  
[ADDRESS_36721] been large  randomized 
controlled trials with conflicting results regarding effectiveness of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_36815], and the optimal dosing. (table 1)

Rationale for a clinical trial  
Evidence suggests that in preeclamptic patients there is a imbalance in the prostacyclin  
/thromboxane balance favoring thromboxane. Thromboxane is a vasoconstrictor while 
prostacyclin is a vasodilator.9 The pathophysiology of action of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_36817] -1 at low dos es (60-  
150mg/day)10. 
The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology in July 2018, published a 
committee opi[INVESTIGATOR_36818]. The recommended dose is 81mg/day of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], and it is to be used in women at high risk for preeclampsia. Women were considered to be at high risk if they had at least a 8% incidence of preeclampsia (table 2). The initiation of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_36819] 12- 28 weeks gestation, optimally prior to 16 weeks 
gestational age.

be appropriate in this patient population. To our knowledge, at this time there are no 
randomized controlled trials that have compared aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 81mg and [ADDRESS_36724] 81mg/day dose.

Recruitment  
Patients will be recruited from the following locations:  
- [LOCATION_007] Medical center Ross Clinic in the UT Professional Building (Suite 350) 
- [LOCATION_007] Medical center High Risk OB Clinic in the UT Professional Building (Suite 
350) 
- UT Obstetrics office at Bellaire  
- Harris Health Obstetrics Clinic at LBJ  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_36836] -generated random sequences, using 
RedCap. Permuted block randomization will be performed. Women will be randomized 
to 81mg/day of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_36837] 162 mg/day of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248].  
 
 
Interventions and Procedures  
Women with singlet on gestations that are less than twenty weeks gestational age and 
meet inclusion criteria will be approached by [CONTACT_36865]’s provider. Written informed consent will be obtained from participating women at the outpatient clinic. If the patient consents, then randomization  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-18-1073 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 03/08/2024   will be performed. The results of randomization will be shared with the obstetric provider 
and the patient prior to starting aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]. If the patient had already been started on 
81mg/day aspi[INVESTIGATOR_36838] a prior visit then she will be informed of whether she should 
continue with the same dose or if she would need a higher dose based on the randomization.  
After randomization, patients will then be prescribed the medication. Which wil l be 
started between 12 and 20 weeks gestational age and continued till time of delivery. The primary provider will dictate all other aspects of care.  
A medication adherence survey (Morisky medication adherence survey) will be performed to assess for compliance at 16- 24 weeks of gestational age, and again at 32-  36 weeks 
gestational age. At the time of administration of medication adherence surveys, participants will be asked about medication side effects.  
22-24 
Blood samples (3- 4 cc) and urine samples (3- 4 cc) will be obtained at the time of 
enrollment (with the routine blood tests that are sent), to test for baseline aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], thromboxane and prostacycli n levels. At the time of delivery, blood samples (3- 4 cc) and 
urine samples (3- 4 cc) (with routine blood samples that are sent at time of labor 
admission), placental 1x1 cm specimens and cord blood will be obtained. These samples will be used for biochemic al correlation with the clinical  data.  
The primary outcome (incidence of preeclampsia with severe features) will be determined based on clinician diagnosis, with the use of ACOG diagnostic criteria. Secondary outcomes will be determined by [CONTACT_36866]. Patients will not be contact[CONTACT_36867][INVESTIGATOR_307].

Sample Size and Feasibility  
An intent -to-treat principle will be applied to all analysis. To calculate Bayesian 
statistical power we assumed a baseline incidence of preeclampsia in our population to 
be 20%. We investigated effects sizes of 50%, 40%, and 30% reduction (corresponding relative risk [RR] of 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7). We also varied the level of certainty (probability 
threshold for declaring benefit) from 70% to 85%. For all scenarios, we assumed a neutral prior centered at RR of 1.0 with 95% credible interval of 0.33- 3.0 (excludes 
implausible large treatment effects). Tables [ADDRESS_36729] a 40% reduction in incidence of preeclampsia with 75% certainty and power (1 –  β) = 0.80 is 220 (110 
patients in each arm).

In the week of November 5- 9 2018, 10 patients that attended the UT Women’s clinic 
and UT Bellaire Clinic, met inclusion criteria. Assuming a 50% enrollment rate, the study 
would take 12.5  months.  
Statistical Tests  
Selected baseline characteristics  and outcome measures  will be collected for each 
group. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize all variables. An intent -to-treat 
analysis will be conducted. The rate of the primary outcome, preeclampsia, will be 
compared between the intervention and contr ol group using  a log binomial  (or Poisson  in 
case  of nonconvergence)  model  to estimate  relative risk and 95% confidence interval  (CI). 
Each  secondary  outcome will be similarly  analyzed using the best fitting  generalized  linear 
model with intervention group as the covariate. For all outcomes, we will report relative risks or differences and 95%  CIs. 
We will also conduct a Bayesian analysis of the primary outcome to calculate 
probability of treatment benefit or harm. We wil l use a neutral prior distribution for the 
intervention effect that excludes  implausible  large treatment  effects:  Normal(0,  SD=0.57) 
in the log RR scale (prior 95% interval for the RR of 0.33- 3) 
25. We will report posterior 
median and 95% credible interval  and probability of treatment  benefit.  
 
Subgroup Analysis. To investigate treatment effect modifier for the primary 
outcome, we will use a Bayesian hierarchical model with terms of interaction between treatment group (162 mg, 81 mg) and the prespecified potential moderator of BMI (30 - 
40; >40).  The conservative  Bayesian  approach of Dixon  and Simon  
26 allows  us to specify 
a priori  how likely  (or unlikely)  it is for subgroup differences  to be present  and to shrinkthe 
subgroup estimates to the overall mean treatment effect. A neutral prior will be used for the interaction term.  Point  estimates  of treatment  effect  and 95% credible intervals  will be 
reported along with probability of treatment  benefit/harm.

IRB APPROVAL DATE: 03/08/2024   3. SAFETY ASSESSMENT  
A. Maternal  Risk 
According to a USPSTF report discussing low -dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_36839],  there  was no increased risk of placental  abruption (RR: 1.17;  CI, 0.93-1.48) 
in 11 trials (23,332 women). No increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage (RR: 1.02;  CI 
0.96- 1.09)  in 9 trials  (22,760  women)  and no difference in mean  blood loss (5 trials;  2,478 
women). 27 
In the EPREDA trial (150mg ASA administered) they noted no abnormal bleeding in 
mothers  nor babies.  [ADDRESS_36730] done by [CONTACT_36868], with administration  of 150 
mg ASA in comparison to placebo, no statistically significant differences in the rates of 
placental abruption (4% vs 2%, p=0.12), postpartum hemorrhage (25% vs 26%, p=0.67) 
and blood transfusions (2.5 vs 2.2%, p=0.81) were observ ed between the groups.  
 
B. Fetal  Risk 
 
A review of 11 trials (which included 23,332 participants), noted no significant harm of perinatal death or abruption to those receiving aspi[INVESTIGATOR_36840]. Of the 10 trials reporting on neonatal  intracranial hemorrhage, the fixed- affects 
pooled risk ratio was 0.84 (CI, 0.61 to 1.16). 
[ADDRESS_36731] trimester, has not 
been found to be associated with early ductal closure. 31 A 2007 cochrane meta-  
analysis which reviewed 10 trials (including 26, 148 infants) did not find an increased 
risk of neonatal intracranial hemorrhag e, in relation to the use of low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_36841].32 
 
Management of Adverse Events  
Any adverse events will be reported to the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects (CPHS). Because this study involves the use of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_36842].  
Procedures in the Event of Abnormal Clinical Findings  
In the event of an abnormal clinical finding, the health care provider caring for the 
participant will be notified to allow treatment in the usual clinical manner.  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-18-1073 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 03/08/[ADDRESS_36732] consent will be obtained prior to the commencement of any study procedures.  Consent will be obtained by a 
person fluent in their language, English or Spanish. A patient research authorization form (as 
required by [CONTACT_36869]) will also be obtained in the same manner. A copy of the 
signed consent form and patient resear ch authorization form will be provided to the patient and 
placed in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_36843].  
All prospective study candidates will be given a full explanation of the consent form, allowed to 
read the approved  form,  and be provided the opportunity  to ask any quest ions.  Once  all questions 
have been answered and the Investigator is assured that the individual understands the 
requirements of the study, the subject will be asked to sign the consent. The Investigator shall provide a copy of the signed and dated informed consent to the patient and the original shall be 
maintained in the patient’s study files. Patients who do not sign the consent form will not be permitted to participate in the study.

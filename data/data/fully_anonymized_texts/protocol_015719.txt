V5.0TitleA Phase 1b/2 Study of the Oral CDK4/6 Inhibitor LEE011 (Ribociclib) in Combination with 
Docetaxel Plus Prednisone in Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer
Patient 
PopulationPatients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer and prior resistance to abiraterone, 
enzalutamide, ARN-509, or the combination.
Rationale 
for StudyProstate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the [LOCATION_002].[ADDRESS_1062031] improvement in survival outcomes compared  
with older chemotherapy regimens.3 Prior efforts to combine targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_773361]-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) have not met 
with success.4-[ADDRESS_1062032] demonstrated that cyclin dependent kinases 4/6 
(CDK 4/6) are direct transcriptional targets of MYC that mediate accelerated progression  
through the cell cycle to drive prostate tumor growth.12 Inhibition of CDK 4/[ADDRESS_1062033] of cellular 
proliferation.13 Prior pre-clinical data in other MYC-driven tumor subtypes (triple negative breast 
cancer) indicate synthetic lethality with CDK inhibition in combination with taxane-based 
chemotherapy14, and an ongoing phase 1 study of CDK inhibition in combination with paclitaxel 
suggests the combination is tolerable.
The current study is designed to determine the MTD of ribociclib, a potent CDK 4/6 inhibitor) in 
combination with docetaxel, and in the phase 2 portion of the study, to assess its efficacy in 
mCRPC patients with prior resistant to abiraterone and/or enzalutamide. The integration 
correlative biomarker studies, including the use of tumor and “liquid” biopsies to identify Rb1 
status and presence of MYC pathway activation, along with metabolic imaging of MYC 
transcriptional activity, may potentially identify those tumors most ‘addicted’ to MYC signaling 
and therefore the most likely to achieve therapeutic benefit with inhibition of CDK 4/6, a key 
downstream mediator of MYC-driven up-regulation of cell cycle progression.
Primary 
ObjectivesPhase 1b:

of cell cycle progression.
1.2 Rationale for Targeting Cell Cycle Progression in Advanced Prostate Cancer
Up-regulation of cell cycle progression is a frequent molecular driver of aggressive phenotype metastatic 
CRPC. Loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN is observed in 50-90% of CRPC t umors, leading to 
downstream activation of effectors of the PI3K pathway, including cyclin D, a key driver of G1 to S 
phase cell cycle progression.[ADDRESS_1062037] 
implications for targeting the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) pathway in this disease setting, given the 
direct transcriptional regulation of CDK 4/6 via MYC activation. A recently reported PTEN-knockout 
transgenic model of prostate cancer identified MYC overexpression upregulation as a key driver of tumor 
progression.15  In a landmark translational study of the prostate cancer genome, 74% of human CRPC 
tissue samples displayed alteration of Rb signaling, with overactivation of CDK2 in 21% of cases and 
Rb1 loss in 37% of cases.16 In a previous study of MDV3100-resistant cancer cell lines, gene set
CC# [ADDRESS_1062038] contemporarily, ours and others data indicates progressive enrichment of MYC 
amplification as a driver of prostate cancer progression, with amplification detected in 16% of primary 
prostate adenocarcinomas in the TCGA database, ~ 25-30% of pre-abiraterone/enzalutamide mCRPC 
tumors, and over 80% of abiraterone-resistant mCRPC tumors from the ongoing UCSF mCRPC biopsy 
program (preliminary data, unpublished, CC#125519).
The application of CDK inhibitors has 
shown preliminary evidence of 
substantial anti-tumor activity in prostate 
cancer models, in particular those with 
androgen-independent growth upon 
resistance to androgen signaling 
inhibitors. In a panel of bicalutamide- 
resistant, androgen-independent prostate 
cancer cell lines, CDK2 inhibition was 
able to restore sensitivity with a potency 
that was comparable to that of LNCaP 
androgen-sensitive cell lines.17 More 
recently, CDK 4/[ADDRESS_1062039]

MDV3100 (enzalutamide)-resistant 
cancer cell lines bearing either mutant

the 22Rv1 enzalutamide (MDV) and bicalutamide (bic)-resistant

F876L mutant- or wild type androgen receptor13  (Figure 1). The anti-tumor activity of CDK inhibitors 
has additionally been demonstrated in other MYC-driven cancers. Synthetic lethality with CDK inhibition
was demonstrated in multiple triple negative breast cancer lines which demonstrate up-regulated C-MYC 
signaling.[ADDRESS_1062040] activity18; however these agents were neither potent nor selective inhibitors of CDK 
4/6. It is hypothesized that potent CDK inhibition with ribociclib will have substantial additive or 
synergistic activity with docetaxel in mCRPC.
1.3 Rationale for Combination of CDK 4/[ADDRESS_1062041] demonstrated synergistic activity in multiple 
independent studies, which may be related to blockade of cell cycle progression at separate phases of the 
cell cycle (M and G1 S phases respectively). In vitro studies have demonstrated synergy when cell cycle 
inhibitors like flavopi[INVESTIGATOR_773363].14 Recently, the 
Goga lab at UCSF has demonstrated synergistic activity in TNBC cell lines (BT549, MDA-MB-231, 
HCC1143) treated with dinaciclib and paclitaxel therapy.14 In an ovarian cancer xenograft model, co- 
administration of docetaxel and dinaciclib demonstrated synergistic activity compared to either agent 
given alone. Similar synergistic activity with taxanes has been demonstrated with other CDK-inhibitors 
including flavopi[INVESTIGATOR_106540], NU6410, and purvalonol. A phase 1b study of dinaciclib in combination with 
weekly paclitaxel ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) being conducted at UCSF has demonstrated preliminary evidence of 
an acceptable safety profile with efficacy analyses ongoing. The above findings, coupled with the fact that 
docetaxel-based chemotherapy remains the standard of care for metastatic CRPC with aggressive 
phenotypic features and/or prior resistance to androgen signaling inhibition, provide a strong rationale to 
pursue the combination of CDK4/6 inhibition in combination with docetaxel in mCRPC.

V5.01.4 Summary of Ribociclib Pre-Clinical and Clinical Safety, PK, and Efficacy Data
In vitro Pharmacology:
Ribociclib inhibits the CDK4/CCND1 and CDK6/cyclin-D3 enzyme complexes with concentration 
resulting in 50% inhibition (IC50) values of 0.01 and 0.039 μM in biochemical assays, respectively. In 
Jeko-1 cells, the compound inhibits CDK4/6-dependent pRb phosphorylation with an average IC50 of
0.06 μM. Consistent with the observed inhibition of pRb phosphorylation, ribociclib also inhibited G1 to 
S phase cell cycle progression in Jeko-1 cells as judged by [CONTACT_773389] 
(BrdU) uptake (IC50 of 0.1 μM) and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis (half-maximal 
increase in cells in G1 at 0.11 μM).
The effect of ribociclib on pRb phosphorylation, BrdU uptake and cell cycle progression has been 
assessed in > [ADDRESS_1062042] cancers. In 
pRb+ cell lines ribociclib inhibits pRb phosphorylation with a median IC50 value of 0.275 μM (range:
0.06 to 8.8 μM). Similarly, ribociclib interferes with G1 to S phase cell cycle progression in these cells as 
determined by [CONTACT_745193] a median IC50 value of 0.46 μM.
In vivo Pharmacology:
Ribociclib was well-tolerated in mice and rats with body weight loss not exceeding 12.5% at doses up to 
250 mg/kg, qd, po. No significant changes in blood chemistry readouts were observed after 28 days of 
dosing. However, myelosuppression was observed and correlated with pRb phosphorylation inhibition.
Treatment with ribociclib resulted in tumor regression in the Jeko-1 MCL xenograft model at doses 
greater than or equal to 75 mg/kg, qd, po. In vivo pharmacokinetic (PK)/PD studies demonstrated dose- 
related inhibition of pRb phosphorylation in tumors, with continuous dosing over at least 3-5 days being 
required to achieve optimal target inhibition. In male nude rats a PK/PD/efficacy study indicated that 
plasma levels corresponding to approximately 0.5 - 4 μM over a 24 h dose interval are sufficient to obtain 
near complete inhibition of pRb phosphorylation and complete regression in the Jeko-1 MCL xenograft 
model.
Non-clinical Safety and Toxicology:
In vivo cardiac safety studies demonstrated a signal for QT prolongation with the potential to induce 
incidences of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) at higher exposure levels. The effects of 
ribociclib on the bone marrow (hypocellularity), lymphoid system (lymphoid depletion), intestinal 
mucosa (atrophy), skin (atrophy), bone (decreased bone formation) and testes (atrophy) are considered to 
be related to the pharmacological inhibition of cell replication in these tissues due to CDK4/[ADDRESS_1062043] dose 
tested (20 mg/kg/day) and this effect could also be related to the pharmacology of ribociclib (arrest of 
estrous cycle). The liver, bile system and gall bladder (proliferative changes, cholestasis, sand-like 
gallbladder calculi and inspi[INVESTIGATOR_14919]) were identified as additional target organs of toxicity which are 
not likely related to the primary pharmacology of ribociclib. Inflammatory changes in the lungs of dogs 
were considered secondary to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_745160]-article and are indicative of the irritant potential of the 
formulated test-article in the respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352]. Correlating hematological and/or biochemistry changes 
were seen for the effects described in the bone marrow, lymphoid system and liver. In rats, the changes 
seen in the bone marrow and hematology demonstrated a clear tendency towards reversibility. All other 
findings fully reversed. In dogs, the changes seen in the testes and lungs demonstrated a clear trend
CC# [ADDRESS_1062044] demonstrated ribociclib induced embryotoxicity and fetotoxicity in rats and 
rabbits and teratogenicity in rabbits.
Non-clinical Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism:
Following intravenous [i.v.] dosing, ribociclib showed high CL in the mouse, rat, dog and monkey 
compared to hepatic blood flow. The volume of distribution at steady-state was large across species and 
the terminal elimination half-life (T1/2) was moderate in rodents and monkey (~2 to 5 h) and longer in 
dog (18 h). After oral administration to male rats, 48 to 84% of a radiolabeled dose of ribociclib was 
absorbed. Bioavailability was low to moderate in rat (10 to 65%) and cynomolgus monkey (10 to 23%), 
and moderate in mouse (65%) and dog (64%). Following oral administration, Tmax occurred between 2 
to 4 h across species. Gender-dependent toxicokinetics were observed in rats with higher exposure to 
ribociclib in males as compared to females and with higher exposure to the metabolite, LEQ803.
Plasma protein binding was moderate and showed no major concentration dependency. Free fraction in 
plasma ranged from 20 to 32%.
LEQ803 (N-demethylation) was a prominent metabolite found in rat, monkey and human hepatocytes, 
and the only metabolite formed in dog hepatocytes. This metabolite retains some pharmacologic activity 
and interacts with hERG channels in vitro. Traces of two potential unique human metabolites were 
detected in hepatocytes. In mice, rats, monkey and human, GSH-adducts were detected however these 
were not seen in plasma or excreta from the rat ADME study. Results from the ADME (male rats) study 
showed that 3H-components were predominantly excreted with bile (61.4% of dose). Minor urinary 
excretion was observed (5.44% of dose after p.o. to 10.1% of dose after i.v.). The majority of the 
administered dose (87.3%) was excreted within 24 h via urine, feces (enteric secretion) and bile.
Drug-drug interaction: Oxidative metabolism of ribociclib is dominated by [CONTACT_097]3A4 with a minor 
contribution of about 20% by [CONTACT_773390]-3 (FMO3). ribociclib is a low-affinity 
substrate of P-gp (MDR1). ribociclib is a time-dependent CYP3A4 inhibitor (KI = [ADDRESS_1062045] = 0.0245 
min-1) and a reversible inhibitor of CYP1A2 (Ki = 16 μM). No PXR-mediated CYP3A4 induction was 
observed. ribociclib was found to inhibit MDR1 (IC50 = 143 μM), MXR (IC50 = 24 μM), and human 
BSEP (IC50 = 4.7 μM), but not rat or dog BSEP. The elimination of ribociclib may potentially be 
affected by [CONTACT_3252]-administered drugs that inhibit or induce CYP3A4. ribociclib may inhibit CYP3A4, 
CYP1A2, BSEP, and MXR depending on the dose and ribociclib concentrations achieved in vivo.
Clinical Studies:
In single agent trials, a total of [ADDRESS_1062046] been treated: 132 in study CLEE011X2101 (in a 
Caucasian population, including 85 in the dose escalation), 15 in CLEE011X1101 (in Japanese patients, 
all in the dose escalation) and 32 in CLEE011X2102 (in patients under the age of 21 years, all in the dose 
escalation). A total of 18 patients presented toxicities meeting the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) criteria (10 
in CLEE011X2101, 4 in CLEE011X1101 and 4 in CLEE011X2102): these consisted of Grade 3 
stomatitis, Grade 3 pulmonary embolism, Grade 3 hyponatremia, prolonged Grade 3/4 neutropenia (x2), 
prolonged Grade 2 elevated creatinine, Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (x5), Grade 3 asymptomatic QTcF 
prolongation with Grade 3 neutropenia, Grade 4 febrile neutropenia, Grade 3 febrile neutropenia (x2), 
Grade 3 electrocardiogram QT prolonged, Grade 3 fatigue, and Grade 3 asymptomatic QTcF prolongation 
with grade 4 neutropenia.

V5.0The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose for expansion (RDE) from study 
CLEE011X2101 were declared as 900 mg qd and 600 mg qd on a 3 weeks on/[ADDRESS_1062047] common (in at least 2 patients) adverse events (AEs) related to study 
treatment were (all grades, Grade 3/4): neutropenia (46.3%, 28.4%), leukopenia (46.3%, 19.4%), nausea
(44.8%, 1.5%), thrombocytopenia (34.3%, 9%), fatigue (32.8%, 3%), anaemia (28.4%, 3%), diarrhoea
(26.9%, 3%), lymphopenia (22.4%, 17.9%), electrocardiogram QT prolonged (9%, 0%), hyponatremia
(3%, 1.5%), and febrile neutropenia (1.5%, 1.5%). Asymptomatic grade 2 QTc prolongation was 
observed with increasing frequency starting at 600 mg with grade 3 prolongation in 2 patients (3%). The 
majority of all reported adverse events were mild or moderate (grade 1-2) and reversible. There have been 
no reported deaths related to single agent ribociclib.
Paired skin biopsies from 55 patients treated with ribociclib at doses ranging from 50 to 900 mg and 
paired tumor biopsies from 20 patients (16 patients at 600 mg, 2 patients at 900 mg, and 1 patient each at 
70 and 750 mg) were assessed for changes in Ki67 and pRb levels. Preliminary results indicate the 
following: in skin biopsies, reductions in Ki67 from baseline were observed across all dose levels with a 
more consistent trend from 400 mg onwards; in tumor biopsies, reductions in Ki67 from baseline were 
observed in 18/20 patients; however, limited samples and varied tumor types prevent conclusions about 
any dose-response relationship from being drawn. Changes in pRb were not significant or consistent in 
either skin or tumor samples, possibly due to varied tumor types.
Preliminary data for clinical activity from study CLEE011X2101 show that out of 114 evaluable patients, 
3 partial responses were seen at the 600 mg qd dose level: one in a BRAF/NRAS wild type, CCDN1 
amplified melanoma patient, one in a CDKN2A loss head and neck acinar carcinoma patient, and one in 
an ER+/HER2-, PIK3CA mutant, CCDN1 amplified breast cancer.
Following oral dosing, ribociclib was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_263578] 1 to 5 hours. 
ribociclib plasma exposure exhibited slightly over-proportional increases in exposure across the dose 
range tested (50 to 1200 mg), with no clear evidence of time-dependent auto-inhibition of its clearance 
mediated by [CONTACT_097]3A4. Steady-state was generally reached by [CONTACT_2006] 8 and the mean effective T1/2 based on 
accumulation ratio (i.e., T1/2,acc) ranged from 15.9 to 32.6 hours across the dose range tested. The 
accumulation ratio based on AUC obtained in a dosing interval (Racc) across the studied doses ranged 
from 1.55 to 2.52.
The MTD of single agent ribociclib is 900 mg qd with a 3 weeks on/1 week off schedule. The RP2D for 
future development of single agent ribociclib dosing is 600 mg qd with a 3 weeks on/1 week off schedule 
which has an acceptable safety profile, lower risk for QT prolongation, adequate exposures, and 
preliminary evidence of clinical activity.
1.5 Summary of Docetaxel Mechanism of Action, Efficacy, Safety and Pharmacokinetics
Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent that acts by [CONTACT_773391]. Docetaxel binds to free tubulin and promotes the 
assembly of tubulin into stable microtubules while simultaneously inhibiting their disassembly. This leads 
to the production of microtubule bundles without normal function and to the stabilization of microtubules, 
which results in the inhibition of mitosis in cells. Docetaxel's binding to microtubules does not alter the 
number of protofilaments in the bound microtubules, a feature which differs from most spi[INVESTIGATOR_773364].
The most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, 
febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation,
CC# 145515
Ribociclib, Docetaxel, PrednisonePage 10 of 7704 FEB 2019
V5.0anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, 
skin reactions, and myalgia.
Every 3 week docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 in combination with prednisone 5 mg BID has been evaluated in a 
randomized phase 3 study in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. In the TAX327 phase 3 study, 
every 3 week docetaxel + prednisone prolonged median survival from 16.5 months (95% CI 14.4-18.6) 
for patients treated with standard of care mitoxantrone + prednisone to 18.9 months (95% CI 17.0-21.1) in 
patients treated with every 3 week docetaxel (p = 0.009). Weekly docetaxel was also evaluated in this trial 
and displayed a numerically prolonged survival compared to mitoxantrone (17.4 versus 16.5 months) 
which did not meet statistical significance (p = 0.36). The results of this trial led to the FDA approval of 
docetaxel plus prednisone in mCRPC and established every [ADDRESS_1062048]-line 
chemotherapy in mCRPC.
1.6 Rationale for the Starting Dose Level and Dose Schedule of Docetaxel and Ribociclib
The starting dose of docetaxel is fixed for all dose levels at 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. Docetaxel dosed at 
75 mg/m2 every [ADDRESS_1062049] to efficacy outcomes 
in a prior randomized phase 3 study. If excess toxicity (particularly hematologic) is observed at the first 
dose level of the combination of ribociclib plus docetaxel, an alternative dosing schema may be pursued 
with 60 mg/m2 docetaxel every 3 weeks and/or weekly docetaxel dosing upon review of safety results 
with Principal Investigator. Both 60 mg/m2 every 3-week docetaxel as well as weekly docetaxel have 
demonstrated efficacy and less hematologic toxicity compared with 75 mg/m2 every 3 week docetaxel 
dosing.
The starting dose of ribociclib in the Phase 1b portion of the study will be 200 mg/day days 2-14 of every 
21 day cycle. The rationale for starting ribociclib on day 2 as opposed to day 1 of the treatment cycle 
stems from prior pre-clinical observations that synergistic activity is observed with taxane plus CDK4/[ADDRESS_1062050] cancer.
The starting dose of ribociclib (200 mg/day) is predicted to achieve serum concentrations above the level 
necessary for CDK 4/6 inhibition based upon pre-clinical studies (IB). The maximal dose of ribociclib 
(600 mg/day) to be evaluated in the current study is the recommended single agent phase [ADDRESS_1062051] Activation:
Putative resistance and sensitivity markers of CDK 4/6 inhibitors including Rb1 loss (resistance), cyclin 
D2 overexpression (sensitivity), CDK 4/6 overexpression (sensitivity), MYC overexpression and 
amplification (sensitivity) will be assessed in an exploratory fashion during the Phase 2 portion of the 
study to determine whether there are particular indicators of clinical benefit with CDK4/6 inhibition in 
specific patient populations.
Patients will undergo optional metastatic tumor biopsy prior to day 1 of study treatment during Phase 2 
of the study. Preliminary data indicates high rate of evaluable biopsy material from metastatic prostate 
tumor biopsies, including bone (yield 70-90%). For the UCSF patients undergoing tumor biopsy during 
Phase 2, the infrastructure from the ongoing clinical study  will be utilized for tissue 

CC# [ADDRESS_1062052] elements.
Peripheral blood (all patients) will also be collected for circulating tumor cell (CTC) and cell-free 
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis at Screening (phase 2 only). In past studies, collection of 
CTCs and cell-free ctDNA has been feasible and results have had reasonable concordance with 
metastatic tumor tissue. 
Gallium citrate PET Imaging (Optional - For UCSF Patients Only)
In considering non-invasive strategies to more expediently investigate the role of MYC in mCRPC, 
several groups have reported preclinical data showing that a small handful of radiotracers can measure 
MYC biology by [CONTACT_24096] a downstream event regulated by [CONTACT_441865]. Among these include radiolabeled 
transferrin (Tf) adducts, which provide a readout of intracellular MYC activity by [CONTACT_773392] (TFRC), a direct and specific MYC target gene (Fig. 2A). When 
considering clinically available radionuclides to non-invasively quantify MYC transcriptional
activity, 68Ga-citrate-based PET possesses a strong rationale to evaluate in this setting: (1) Gallium citrate 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_773365], providing in turn a quantifiable read-out of transferrin
receptor density and therefore MYC transcriptional activity (Fig. 2B); (2) As compared with gallium-67, 
gallium-68 has a much shorter half-life (68 m vs. 3.2 d) and decays primarily by [CONTACT_773393] (67Ga: 
multiple single photon emission at 93, 184, and 300 keV) allowing higher doses to be injected and shorter 
imaging studies. 68Ga is readily available from the germanium-68 generator; (3) 68Ga-citrate does not 
accumulate within the pulmonary parenchyma, allowing for markedly improved sensitivity and specificity 
in detecting regions of transferrin receptor overexpression  (4) 68Ga-citrate imaging has an established
pre-clinical and clinical safety and dosimetry record, and is available for clinical use. Indeed, proof-of- 
concept PET imaging studies in humans have already shown that it can target foci harboring cells with 
high TFRC expression (e.g. peripheral mononuclear blood cells at sites of infection).20

Figure 2: Measuring MYC signaling in prostate cancer with 68Ga-citrate PET. A. A schema summarizing the 
biological hypothesis of the grant.  At left, systemic abiraterone (Abir.) treatment will affect a disease  response
by [CONTACT_773394] (test.) and preventing the androgen receptor (AR) 
from performing transcription at androgen response elements (AREs). Alternatively, a subset of disease will 
escape control by [CONTACT_773395]’s ability to transcribe MYC in a ligand independent fashion. In addition AR 
independent MYC expression can override clinical benefit associated with single agent inhibitors of AR. MYC 
in turn transcribes a large repertoire of target genes responsible for proliferation and survival. Among these are 
the transferrin receptor (TFRC), an essential regulator of iron homeostasis, and cyclin dependent kinases 4 and  
6 (CDK4/6), two of a family of enzymes that regulate cell cycle progression. Diagnostically, we hypothesize  
that MYC overexpressing tumors will be identified with a Gallium-68 (Ga)/transferrin adduct on the basis of 
high TFRC expression. Therapeutically, we hypothesize that patients with disease highly avid for gallium- 
citrate will most demonstrably respond to CDK4/6 inhibition with ribociclib on the basis of an “addiction” to 
MYC signaling. B. A summary of the region of interest analysis for MYC dependent gallium-68 citrate uptake 
in mouse prostate cancer xenograft models. Mice were inoculated with MycCaP, a model in which MYC is 
regulated by [CONTACT_773396], or MycCaP + MYC, a MycCaP subline that also harbors an additional MYC 
allele with a constitutive promoter. Castration resulted in a rapid downregulation of gallium-68 citrate uptake in 
the MycCaP tumor, but no substantial change in uptake for the MycCaP + MYC tumor model. This finding is 
consistent with the model of MYC regulation of TFRC outlined in A.

scan is associated with clinical outcomes (For UCSF Patients Only).
To determine whether genomic assessment of MYC pathway activation (MYC amplification or 
overexpression, Rb1 deletion, cyclin D/E and CDK 4/6 overexpression) assessed within 
metastatic tumor tissue, CTCs, and/or cell-free ctDNA is predictive of clinical outcomes with 
the combination of ribociclib plus docetaxel.
To determine whether MYC activation score as determined by [CONTACT_773397].
To use an unbiased approach with integration of clinical, genomic, and proteomic data

V5.03 STUDY DESIGN
3.1 General Study Design
This is a Phase Ib/II open label clinical trial in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. 
The objective of the phase Ib portion of the study is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and 
dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of docetaxel and prednisone in combination with ribociclib in escalating 
oral daily doses in patients with metastatic CRPC with prior resistance to abiraterone and/or enzalutamide 
who have not undergone prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Dose escalation will follow the 
standard 3+[ADDRESS_1062053] 
efficacious dosing schedule of docetaxel (75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks). If there is excess toxicity observed 
with the treatment combination at the first dose level (dose level I), an alternative dosing schema may be 
pursued with docetaxel 60 mg/m2 every 3 weeks and/or weekly docetaxel treatment (30 mg/m2 weekly 
two of every three weeks). Both of these alternative docetaxel dosing schedules have demonstrated 
activity in mCRPC with decreased risk of cytopenias compared with 75 mg/m2 every 3 week. 
Intermediate dose levels and/or alternative dosing schedules of ribociclib may be investigated in Phase Ib 
based on the initial safety data. 
The Phase 2 portion (N = 29) of the study is a single arm, two stage, open-label study of ribociclib (dosed 
at the RP2D and schedule) in combination with docetaxel and prednisone to determine the efficacy and 
further define the safety of the treatment combination. Patients will be treated with the combination of 
ribociclib plus docetaxel + prednisone for up to [ADDRESS_1062054] the option of starting maintenance 
ribociclib after 6 cycles of docetaxel if stable disease or better on re-staging scans. The dose of ribociclib 
used during maintenance will be the same dose as that immediately preceding cessation of docetaxel 
treatment.

5.3 Plasma/Serum/Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (PBMC) Banking
Blood will be collected at specified time points for Plasma, Serum, and PBMC banking. The UCSF-
HDFCCC Tissue Bank will serve as a repository for banking human samples. Specimen and data 
registries will be kept by [CONTACT_580473]-HDFCCC. This registry will have a coordinated database to protect 
patient confidentiality and safety. The samples will receive a patient- insensitive identifier and the link to 
patient identity will be kept in a locked file with access only by [CONTACT_773402]. Other 
investigators will have access to the samples only through established Tissue Core procedures. That is, 
investigators must submit a written request to use the stored samples as part of an IRB-approved protocol 
that is reviewed by [CONTACT_773403]. This review limits the testing that can be done on these 
samples. No information about germ-line genetic mutations will be done on these samples. The collection 
of these specimens is optional and patients have the right at any time to request that all remaining 
samples be destroyed. The patient or relatives may be contact[CONTACT_773404], additional research on 
stored samples, if necessary. Additional written consent will be required if additional samples are to be 
taken. Please see Appendix [ADDRESS_1062084] common driver mutations encountered across solid tumor 
malignancies, including complete exon and partial intron coverage of, RB1, MYC, AR, and PTEN, 
CDK4, CDK6, CCND1, CCND2, among others. In addition, copy number determination of MYC, 
CDK4, and CDK6 will be determined. For the specimen collection, 10 mL of whole blood will be 
collected using the supplied research kit with blood collection tubes at Screening. Samples will be 
shipped to Guardant Health. Please see Appendix 6 for collection and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3931].
5.5 Circulating Tumor Cells
CTC enumeration will be performed via the Epic Sciences platform. The Epic Sciences platform is a 
novel CTC detection technology that uses unselected enumeration and characterization of multiple 
different CTC types including “traditional” CTCs (CK+, CD45-, and morphologically distinct from 
surrounding white blood cells, similar to the Veridex definition), EMT candidates (CK-, CD45-, and 
morphologically distinct from surrounding white blood cells), and small cell CTCs (CK+, CD45-, and 
morphologically similar to white blood cells). The technology was developed with a view to providing a 
fluid biopsy with features, specifications and performance criteria similar to current pathology practice. 
The platform allows multiplexed analysis of different protein biomarkers from the
CC# 145515
Ribociclib, Docetaxel, PrednisonePage 24 of 7704 FEB 2019
V5.0same blood sample, fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of relevant genes, and individual 
cell capture for detailed molecular interrogation. The platform has demonstrated molecular 
characterization concordance in a blinded CRPC patient study between concurrently obtained biopsies of 
bone metastases and Epic-captured CTCs. In the study, 80% (12 of 15) of tumors with PTEN loss in the 
bone biopsy also harbored PTEN loss in Epic CTCs, demonstrating a strong genomic concordance and 
the ability to measure intra-patient genomic heterogeneity. Please see Appendix 6 for collection and 
processing details.
5.6 Tumor biopsy (Optional, if accessible lesion is present)
Optional image-guided biopsies will be performed prior to start of protocol therapy. Lesions will be 
chosen based upon the strength of the evidence suggesting the presence of metastasis and with the goal 
of minimizing patient risk. Soft tissue lesions and lesions with documented radiologic progression 
should be prioritized for biopsy. If the Radiologist in charge of the procedure cannot identify a lesion 
amenable for biopsy, the patient will still be eligible for study participation. 
Biopsies will be performed in an interventional radiology suite with radiological guidance (typi[INVESTIGATOR_773369]) in accordance with the standard operating procedure in Appendix [ADDRESS_1062085] or MRI will confirm designated lesions immediately prior to biopsy. Once the target lesion(s) is 
identified, up to six (6) cores will be obtained. Preferably, a 16-gauge BonoptyTM needle or biopsy needle 
with an equivalent 16-gauge bore will be used to biopsy the metastatic lesion. If the lesion is a bone 
metastasis, the Bonopty needle will be passed through the cortical bone and into the target lesion. 
Optimal results are obtained when the biopsies are performed on medullary bone directly adjacent to a 
blastic lesion. Soft tissue biopsies should be performed to ensure a core of approximately [ADDRESS_1062086] (Optimal 
Cutting Temperature compound used for frozen sections), covered with additional OCT, and stored at -
80° C until shipment (see Appendix 7). All biopsy specimens will be delivered to the Feng laboratory at 
UCSF.
Frozen biopsies will be processed for RNA analysis using laser capture microdissection (LCM) and RNA 
amplification using adaptations of previously published methods 36. Briefly, 8-micron frozen sections are 
obtained from each biopsy specimen and stained with H&E. Sections will be loaded into the Aperio 
Digital Imaging system. Multiple sequential 8-micron biopsies are performed prior to rapid H&E staining 
and dehydration with sequential immersion in xylene. The air-dried slides are put into a LCM system and 
prostate cancer cells are identified and collected. Cell material selected for analysis is dissolved in RNA 
or DNA isolation buffer and RNA and DNA are isolated separately using standard commercially 
available kits. RNA and DNA are quantified using the RiboGreen or Pi[INVESTIGATOR_773370] (Invitrogen, Inc) and 
RNA quality is assessed with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using the RNA 6000 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_500124] (Agilent, Inc). 
Similarly, DNA is collected from separate but adjacent frozen sections and isolated. DNA is quantified 
using Pi[INVESTIGATOR_773371].
Gene copy number changes will be performed using a CGH methodology as described above in Section
5.5. RNA sequencing methodology will be used to determine levels of gene expression. LCM collected 
material will be lysed with 5 microliters of Prelude Lysis Buffer (NuGen, San Carlos, CA); subjected to 
cDNA synthesis and amplification without transfer (NuGen, Ovation RNA-seq with some modifications 
to standard protocol); selected for size and processed using the mixed cDNA standard library preparation 
performed using TruSeq protocol (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Paired-end sequencing will be performed on 
the Illumina HiSeq 2000.

V5.06 TREATMENT PLAN
6.1 Dose and schedule
1. Each cycle is 21 days long. A ± 3 day window is allowable for administration of chemotherapy for 
scheduling purposes for cycle 2 and beyond.
2. Two separate dose guidelines will be used in this trial:
a. Cohort dose level (referred to by [CONTACT_773405]: I, II, III, etc).
b. Individual patient dose level: individual patients may have their doses modified (reduced) for 
toxicity (referred to by [CONTACT_773406]: 0, -1, -2).
There are approximately 3 planned dose cohorts in the Phase 1 portion of the study. Approximately 
9 to 18 patients will be treated on the Phase 1 portion of the study.
3. The starting cohort dose level for docetaxel will be 75 mg/m2, administered on day 1 of each cycle. 
Prednisone will be fixed at 5 mg PO BID. The starting dose level and schedule for ribociclib will be 
200 mg orally once daily, starting on day 1 of the 21-day cycle.
4. If dose level I is not tolerated, then alternative dosing schedules of docetaxel will be evaluated, starting 
with dose level IA. 
5. Depending on the safety data observed, alternative dosing schedules and intermediate dose levels of 
ribociclib may be investigated as outlined in Table below (Cohort Dose Levels IC – IIIC).

* Filgrastim will be administered subcutaneously daily on days 15-18 of every cycle. Dose will be determined 
by [CONTACT_773401] (300 mcg if < 70 kg on C1D1; 480 mcg if ≥ 70 kg). Filgrastim may also be administered 
as clinically necessary per investigator discretion for grade 3 or higher neutropenia. It should not be 
administered within 24 hours prior to or after docetaxel infusion.
**If dose level I is determined to have exceeded the MTD alternative dosing schedules of docetaxel will be 
evaluated, as indicated above, starting with dose level IA. Dose escalation will then proceed from level IA to 
level IIIA as tolerated. If dose level IA, IIA, or IIIA is not tolerated, weekly docetaxel dosing may be explored 
starting with the corresponding dose level (e.g. IA   IB, IIA  IIB, IIIA  IIIB).

[CONTACT_773401] (300 mcg if < 70 kg on C1D1; 480 mcg if ≥ 70 kg). Additional doses of filgrastim will also 
be administered as clinically necessary for grade 3 or higher neutropenia. It should not be administered within 
24 hours prior to or after docetaxel infusion.
^ Ribociclib will be dosed daily on days 1-4, 8-15 of every 21-day treatment cycle. 
6. The prednisone dose will be 5 mg by [CONTACT_326372] a day, continuously. At the conclusion of docetaxel 
treatment, prednisone will be tapered over two weeks or longer at the discretion of the treating 
provider.
7. When calculating body surface areas, actual heights and weights should be used. There should be no 
adjustment to “ideal” weight. The total dose delivered should be rounded to the nearest mg. The dose 
should be adjusted during each cycle for the patient’s current weight. If there has been an increase in 
weight of 5% or greater that the investigator suspects is secondary to edema, the investigator may use 
discretion to utilize the weight from the prior cycle to calculate chemotherapy dosage.
8. Patients who do not receive at least 50% of ribociclib doses during cycle 1 for reasons other than 
toxicity will be considered inevaluable and will be replaced.

V5.06.1.1 Dose escalation and de-escalation rules
Ribociclib will be escalated according to the rules outlined below:
1. The dose-limiting toxicity window will be the first 21-day treatment cycle.
2. If 0 of 3 patients in a cohort experience dose limiting toxicities, then the next cohort of 3 
patients will be treated at the next higher dose level.
3. If 1 of 3 patients in a cohort experiences a DLT then the cohort will be expanded to treat an 
additional three patients. If only one of 6 patients experiences a DLT, then the next cohort of 
patients will be treated at the next higher dose level.
4. If two or more patients in a cohort experience a DLT, then the MTD has been exceeded. The 
previous dose level will be considered the MTD. 
5. If more than 1 of 6 patients experience a DLT at dose level IA then the study will be 
terminated, as the MTD cannot be determined and de-escalation from dose level IA is not 
planned.
6. Per Investigator discretion the recommended phase 2 dose/schedule of ribociclib and 
docetaxel may be established (see Section 6.2 below) in the absence of reaching MTD, based 
on the cumulative safety data of the treatment regimen. 
6.1.[ADDRESS_1062089] of prohibited medications and medications to be used with caution is found in
Appendices 2 and 3 respectively.
3. Radiation therapy may not be administered concurrently with protocol therapy. If the patient 
requires the need for radiation therapy during the course of protocol therapy this will be 
considered evidence of clinical progression and the patient will be removed from study.
4. Filgrastim should not be administered within 24 hours of docetaxel infusion. Ribociclib 
should be held for grade 3 or higher neutropenia (see Section 6.3).
5. All patients will be premedicated to prevent a hypersensitivity reaction related to docetaxel 
with intravenous or oral dexamethasone or equivalent dose of alternative steroid.
6.2 Phase 2 Dosing Schedule
The recommended phase 2 dose and schedule of ribociclib in combination with docetaxel will 
be either equivalent to or lower than the MTD (or maximally administered cumulative dose if 
MTD not reached) of the Phase 1 portion of the study. Dose modifications for individual 
patients in the event of toxicity will be similar for Phase 1b and Phase 2, and will follow 
guidelines outlined below in Section 6.3.2.

V5.06.3.2 Guidelines for individual patient dose modifications for toxicity (Phase 1b and 
Phase 2)
[IP_ADDRESS] General Dose Modification Guidelines
1. Individual patient dose reduction for toxicity during the DLT window (cycle 1) in the 
Phase 1b portion of the study only will not be permitted except for toxicity meeting 
criteria for dose-limiting toxicity (Section 6.3.1).
2. Permanently discontinue protocol therapy for related Grade 4 non-hematologic adverse 
events of any duration except for:
a. Clinically insignificant laboratory abnormalities that resolve with optimal 
treatment within 48 hours
b. Vomiting and diarrhea that resolve within 48 hours with optimal treatment
3.Hold treatments for related Grade 3 adverse events with subsequent dose- 
reduction, if such adverse events return to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline within two weeks, 
treatment can be continued at one lower dose level as outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]
4. Dose reduction/discontinuation of ribociclib should occur before or concurrently with 
docetaxel for overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_773372]/reduction guidelines. Investigator- 
discretion and clinical judgment are to be utilized in deciding whether to interrupt and/or 
reduce dose even if not required per protocol.
The schema for dose modification for toxicity for individual patients are as follows:
For patients treated with every 3-week docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 and a starting ribociclib dose of

[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment of hypersensitivity reactions to docetaxel
In case of hypersensitivity reactions, the investigator should institute treatment measures 
deemed medically appropriate per institutional guidelines. Based on prior experience with 
paclitaxel, the following treatment recommendations may be applicable. Investigator 
discretion should be taken regarding any additional measures to be instituted.
CTCAE Grade 1 Allergic Reaction/Hypersensitivity (transient rash, drug fever < 38 C):
Supervise at the bedside without further treatment. Consider decreasing rate of infusion 
until recovery from symptoms.
CTCAE Grade 2 Allergic Reaction/Hypersensitivity (urticaria, drug fever  38C):
Interrupt the infusion of docetaxel.
After recovery of symptoms, resume the infusion at a slower rate and if no further 
symptoms appear, complete the administration of the dose. If symptoms recur, discontinue 
infusion and follow guidelines below.
Recurrent CTCAE Grade 2 or CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 Allergic/Hypersensitivity Reactions:
Stop the infusion.
Administer additional doses of H1 and H2 blockers intravenously. Administer IV steroids 
(see discussion below) and consider epi[INVESTIGATOR_773373].
For recurrent grade 2 or grade 3 reactions, prior to rechallenge and with all subsequent 
cycles, consider both an H1 and H2 blocker intravenously plus dexamethasone 20 mg x 2 
doses (orally or intravenously) 12 and 6 hours pre docetaxel. Grade 4 reactions are 
considered severe hypersensitivity reactions, and rechallenge is contraindicated.

liver metastasis, and alcohol intake.
Additional follow-up for hepatic toxicities
Hepatic toxicity monitoring includes the following LFTs: albumin, ALT, AST, total bilirubin 
(fractionated if total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_1062111]), alkaline phosphatase, and GGT. For patients with Gilbert 
Syndrome: total and direct bilirubin must  be  monitored,  intensified  monitoring  applies  to  changes 
in  direct bilirubin only.
Close observation is recommended in case of AST, ALT, and/or bilirubin increase requiring dose 
interruption, which involves:
• Repeating liver enzyme and serum bilirubin tests two or three times weekly. Frequency of re- 
testing can decrease to once a week or less if abnormalities stabilize or return to normal values.
• Obtaining a more detailed history of current symptoms.
• Obtaining a more detailed history of prior and/or concurrent diseases.
• Obtaining a history of concomitant drug use (including non-prescription medications, herbal and 
dietary supplements), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and special diets.
• Ruling out acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, and E; hepatotropic virus infections (CMV, 
EBV or HSV); autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis; NASH; hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; and 
biliary tract disease.
• Obtaining a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents.
• Obtaining additional tests to evaluate liver function, as appropriate (e.g., INR, direct bilirubin).
• Considering gastroenterology or hepatology consultations.
• Assessing cardiovascular dysfunction or impaired liver oxygenation, including hypotension or 
right heart failure as possible etiologies for liver dysfunction.

V5.[IP_ADDRESS] All other adverse reactions
For treatment regimen-related toxicities > grade 3 (excluding the hematologic, liver, and cardiac 
toxicities outlined above, as well as grade 3 nausea/vomiting/diarrhea/fatigue lasting less than 48 
hours with optimal medical management, any grade alopecia, or non-clinically significant 
laboratory abnormalities that resolve within 48 hours with optimal medical management), both 
drugs should be withheld until resolution to < grade 1 (or to baseline if baseline was greater than 
grade 1). Treatment may be restarted at next lower dose level if the toxicity improves to grade 1 
or lower within 2 weeks of onset of adverse event. If toxicity recurs at grade 3 or higher, patients 
will be required to discontinue study therapy.
Ribociclib should be held for grade 2 related toxicities and restarted at the original dose level 
once recovered to grade ≤ 1. If the same toxicity recurs at grade 2, interrupt ribociclib until 
recovery to grade ≤ 1, then restart ribociclib at the next lower dose level.
Toxicities solely related to corticosteroid use (hyperglycemia, insomnia, hypertension, etc.) and 
androgen deprivation therapy (hot flashes, gynecomastia, erectile dysfunction, etc.) will not 
require mandatory dose reduction.  Treating physicians may modify the doses of prednisone 
as clinically indicated. Cessation of prednisone therapy is not a reason to remove a patient from 
protocol therapy or to be considered a DLT.
6.4 Cycle Delays
Initiation of subsequent cycles may be delayed for a maximum of three weeks for toxicity or at the 
discretion of the treating physician. Any patient who fails to recover from a treatment related toxicity to 
baseline or Grade 1 within 21 days of scheduled retreatment will be removed from the study and followed 
for progression or initiation of non-protocol therapy.
6.5 Duration of Therapy
In the absence of treatment delays due to toxicity(ies), treatment may continue until one of the following 
criteria applies:
Disease progression (see Section 8)
Unacceptable toxicity according to above definition (Section [IP_ADDRESS])
Patient withdrawal from study
Study closure
When a patient is discontinued from the study, the reason(s) for discontinuation should be documented. 
Follow-up should be maintained every three months until progression or initiation of non-protocol 
therapy. Patients who experienced any drug-related toxic effects will be followed at least every four 
weeks until all study drug-related toxicities resolve, stabilize, return to baseline, or are deemed 
irreversible.

V5.07 DRUG INFORMATION (adapted from the Investigators Brochure and package insert)
7.1 Docetaxel
Classification and Mode of Action
Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent belonging to the taxoid family. It is prepared by [CONTACT_773408] a precursor extracted from the renewable needle biomass of yew plants. The chemical 
name [CONTACT_391430] (2R,3S)-N-carboxy-3-phenylisoserine,N-tert-butyl ester, 13-ester with 5β-20- 
epoxy-1,2α,4,7β,10β,13α-hexahydroxytax-11-en-9-one 4-acetate 2-benzoate, trihydrate.
Preparation and Administration:
TAXOTERE Injection Concentrate (20 mg/mL) requires NO prior dilution with a diluent and is ready 
to add to the infusion solution. Use only a 21 gauge needle to withdraw TAXOTERE from the vial 
because larger bore needles (e.g., 18 and 19 gauge) may result in stopper coring and rubber 
particulates.
1. TAXOTERE vials should be stored between 2 and 25°C (36 and 77°F). If the vials are stored
under refrigeration, allow the appropriate number of vials of TAXOTERE Injection Concentrate 
vials to stand at room temperature for approximately 5 minutes before use.
2. Using only a 21 gauge needle, aseptically withdraw the required amount of TAXOTERE 
injection concentrate (20 mg docetaxel/mL) with a calibrated syringe and inject via a single 
injection (one shot) into a 250 mL infusion bag or bottle of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride solution 
or 5% Dextrose solution to produce a final concentration of 0.3 mg/mL to 0.74 mg/mL. If a dose 
greater than 200 mg of TAXOTERE is required, use a larger volume of the infusion vehicle so 
that a concentration of 0.74 mg/mL TAXOTERE is not exceeded.
3. Thoroughly mix the infusion by [CONTACT_137460].
4. As with all parenteral products, TAXOTERE should be inspected visually for particulate matter 
or discoloration prior to administration whenever the solution and container permit. If the 
TAXOTERE dilution for intravenous infusion is not clear or appears to have precipi[INVESTIGATOR_332], it 
should be discarded.
5. TAXOTERE infusion solution is supersaturated, therefore may crystallize over time. If crystals 
appear, the solution must no longer be used and shall be discarded.
The TAXOTERE dilution for infusion should be administered intravenously as a 1-hour infusion 
under ambient room temperature (below 25°C) and lighting conditions.
How Supplied
Docetaxel will be obtained via manufacturer via commercial insurance. 
Potential Drug Interactions
Docetaxel is a CYP3A4 substrate. In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel 
may be modified by [CONTACT_23622], inhibit, or are 
metabolized by [CONTACT_9058] P450 3A4.
In vivo studies showed that the exposure of docetaxel increased 2.2-fold when it was 
coadministered with ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Protease inhibitors, particularly 
ritonavir, may increase the exposure of docetaxel. Concomitant use of TAXOTERE and drugs 
that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase exposure to docetaxel and should be avoided. In patients

Ribociclib, Docetaxel, PrednisonePage 43 of 7704 FEB 2019
V5.0receiving treatment with TAXOTERE, close monitoring for toxicity and a TAXOTERE dose 
reduction could be considered if systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be 
avoided [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Human Toxicology:
As of [ADDRESS_1062119] (28-day cycle). Doses ranging from the starting dose 
of 50 mg to 1200 mg were evaluated on this schedule. In addition, continuous dosing of ribociclib 
at 600 mg was evaluated (once daily for 28 days of a 28-day cycle). A total of 10 events meeting 
DLT criteria were observed at the indicated doses and include grade 3 mucositis/stomatitis (n=1) 
at 50 mg, grade 3 pulmonary embolism (n=1) at 280 mg, grade 3 hyponatremia (n=1) and 
prolonged grade 3/4 neutropenia (n=1) at 400 mg, prolonged grade 2 elevated creatinine (n=1) at 
600 mg, grade 4 thrombocytopenia (n=1) at 750 mg, grade 3 asymptomatic QTcF prolongation 
with grade 3 neutropenia (n=1) at 900 mg and grade 4 febrile neutropenia (n=1) and grade 4 
thrombocytopenia (n=1) at 1200 mg. There was also 1 DLT, grade 3 neutropenia (n=1) at 600 mg 
on the continuous dosing schedule. Grade 1/2 neutropenia was observed at doses of 280 mg or 
higher (23%) and grade 3/4 neutropenia was seen at doses of 400 mg and higher (21%).
Asymptomatic grade [ADDRESS_1062120] frequently reported AEs (> 15%) 
regardless of study treatment relationship include neutropenia (44%), nausea (42%), anemia 
(41%), leukopenia (37%), fatigue (35%), diarrhea (31%), thrombocytopenia (28%), vomiting
(28%), lymphopenia (27%), decreased appetite (24%), asthenia (23%), constipation (19%),
hyperglycemia (17%), and hypoalbuminemia (17%).
The majority of all reported adverse events were mild or moderate (grade 1-2) and reversible. 
There have been no reported deaths related to single agent ribociclib. One treatment-related death 
due to intracranial hemorrhage was reported in study CMEK162X2114, where ribociclib was 
administered in combination with binimetinib (MEK162).
Additional Dosing Guidelines for Pharmacokinetic Sampling / ECG / Chemistry panel / Lipid Panel 
Collection
On days with PK, ECG sampling, chemistry panel and/or lipid panel sampling, the following additional 
guidelines should be followed:
• On a day when PK blood collection is scheduled at the clinic, patients must take study treatment 
in the clinic under the supervision of the Investigator or designee. On all other days patients may 
take the study treatment at home.
• Pre-dose samples should be drawn prior to dosing. The sampling time of the PK samples and the 
dosing time must be precisely recorded in the CRF. Furthermore, the dosing date and time the 
study medication was taken on the day before the PK assessment must be precisely recorded in 
the CRF.
• Post-dose PK samples should be collected after dosing of the study treatment.

V5.07.3 Prednisone:
Pharmacology
Glucocorticoids are quickly and completely absorbed from the GI tract.
Formulation
Refer to package insert.
Storage and stability
Prednisone should be stored at room temperature.
Administration
Prednisone is administered orally.
Availability
Prednisone is commercially available, and commercial sources will be used.
Contraindications
Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with hypothyroidism, cirrhosis, ocular herpes 
simplex, existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies, nonspecific ulcerative colitis, 
diverticulosis, fresh intestinal anastamoses, peptic ulcer, renal insufficiency, hypertension, 
osteoporosis, and myasthenia gravis. Immunization procedures (especially smallpox) should not be 
undertaken in patients on corticosteroids.
Human toxicology
Adverse affects associated with prednisone use are: fluid and electrolyte disturbances, congestive 
heart failure in susceptible persons, hypertension, euphoria, personality changes, insomnia, mood 
swings, depression, worsening of infection (i.e., tuberculosis), exacerbation or symptoms of diabetes, 
psychosis, muscle weakness, osteoporosis, vertebral compression fractures, pancreatitis, esophagitis, 
peptic ulcer, dermatologic disturbances, convulsions, vertigo, headache, endocrine abnormalities, 
ophthalmic changes, and metabolic changes. Some patients have experienced itching and other 
allergic, anaphylactic or hypersensitivity reactions. Withdrawal from prolonged therapy may result in 
symptoms including fever, myalgia, and arthralgia. Phenytoin, phenobarbital, and ephedrine increase 
metabolic clearance of corticosteroids.
Further information about prednisone can be found in the manufacturer’s package insert.
7.4 Filgrastim
(Adapted from package insert- please see package insert for further details)
Formulation
Filgrastim is a 175 amino acid protein manufactured by [CONTACT_12060]. It has a 
molecular weight of 18,800 daltons. It is a sterile, clear, colorless, preservative-free liquid available
CC# [ADDRESS_1062121] is available in single use vials and prefilled syringes 
containing either 300 mcg or 480 mcg.
Pharmacokinetics
The half-life of filgrastim is approximately 3.5 hours. It is systemically degraded.
Adverse Events
Filgrastim is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to E coli -derived proteins‚ 
pegfilgrastim‚ filgrastim, or any other component of the product. Rare cases of splenic rupture have 
been reported following the administration of filgrastim. Patients who report left upper abdominal 
pain and/or shoulder tip pain should be evaluated for an enlarged spleen or splenic rupture.
Allergic reactions to filgrastim, including anaphylaxis, skin rash, and urticaria, have been reported in 
postmarketing experience. The majority of reported events occurred upon initial exposure. In some 
cases, symptoms recurred with rechallenge, suggesting a causal relationship. In rare cases, allergic 
reactions including anaphylaxis, recurred within days after initial anti-allergic treatment was 
discontinued. If a serious allergic reaction occurs, appropriate therapy should be administered, with 
close patient follow-up over several days. Filgrastim should be permanently discontinued in patients 
with serious allergic reactions.
In the placebo-controlled trials, more common adverse events included pyrexia, bone pain, rash, 
cough, and dyspnea.
Cytopenias resulting from an antibody response to exogenous growth factors have been reported on 
rare occasions in patients treated with other recombinant growth factors. There is a theoretical 
possibility that an antibody directed against filgrastim may cross-react with endogenous G-CSF, 
resulting in immune-mediated neutropenia, but this has not been observed in clinical studies.
Dosage and Administration
The recommended dosage of filgrastim are daily subcutaneous injections of [ADDRESS_1062122] from light.

V5.08 MEASUREMENT OF RESPONSE
8.1 Measurement of response in patients with measurable disease
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_86048] (RECIST) 1.[ADDRESS_1062123] 
diameter (unidimensional measurement- LD) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST criteria.
Note: lesions are either measurable or non-measurable using the criteria provided below. 
The term “evaluable” in reference to measurability will not be used because it does not 
provide additional meaning or accuracy. All measurements should be taken and recorded 
in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All Screening evaluations should be 
performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than [ADDRESS_1062124] of 
a treatment.
Clinical lesions. Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin 
nodules and palpable lymph nodes). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], 
including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.
Chest x-ray. Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly defined 
and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. However, CT is preferable.
Conventional CT and MRI. These techniques should be performed with cuts of [ADDRESS_1062125], abdomen, and pelvis. Head and neck tumors and those of 
extremities usually require specific protocols.
8.1.1 Measurable disease/ Target lesions
All measurable lesions (lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension [longest 
diameter to be recorded] as ≥10mm with spi[INVESTIGATOR_15143]) up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and 
recorded and measured at Screening. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size 
(lesions with the longest diameter) and the suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either 
by [CONTACT_14217]). A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions 
will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD will be used as a 
reference by [CONTACT_14218].
Lymph node metastases must measure 1.[ADDRESS_1062126] measure 1 cm or greater (with spi[INVESTIGATOR_92312]).17
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest 
diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the 
baseline sum LD
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target
CC# [ADDRESS_1062127] sum LD
recorded since the treatment started (including 
baseline LD), or the appearance of one or more new 
lesions
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as 
reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment 
started (including baseline LD)
8.1.2 Evaluation of non-target lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and
normalization of tumor marker level
Incomplete Response/ 
Stable Disease (SD):Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s), and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal 
limits
Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions, and/or

a. For the first scheduled reassessment: New lesions at the first scheduled evaluation (9 weeks) will 
require a confirmatory bone scan [ADDRESS_1062131] reassessment scan.
b. For subsequent scheduled reassessments: If no new lesions are observed, study therapy will 
continue. If new lesions are observed, this is evidence of disease progression. Date of progression 
is the date at which the scan was obtained.
8.[ADDRESS_1062132]-treatment PSA Changes
All patients, with or without measurable or non-measurable disease, will be evaluated for PSA decline. 
Patients with disease that is not measurable will be eligible for this study and will be assessed for 
response based on changes in PSA and serial bone scans (if appropriate). The baseline serum PSA must 
be at least 2 ng/mL. Patients who show PSA increases will not be evaluated for PSA progression prior to 
12 weeks of study therapy.
a. 30% and 50% PSA Decline: PSA decline of at least 30% and 50%, respectively, from baseline 
confirmed by a second measurement at least 3 weeks later. The reference for these declines 
should be a PSA measured within 2 weeks prior to starting therapy.
b. PSA Progression: Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) Criteria will be reported. PSA 
progression occurs when the PSA has increased 25% or greater above nadir and an absolute 
increase of 2 ng/mL or more from the nadir is documented. Where no decline is observed, PSA 
progression similarly occurs when a 25% increase from baseline value along with an increase in 
absolute value of 2 ng/mL or more. Patients will receive a minimum of 12 weeks of therapy prior 
to being evaluable for this endpoint. PSA progression (without evidence of progression on scans) 
will not be criteria for discontinuation of study therapy.
c. PSA Response Duration: The PSA response duration commences on the date of the first 50% 
decline in PSA. The response duration ends when the PSA value increases by 25% above the 
nadir, provided that the increase in the absolute-value PSA level is at least 5 ng/mL or back to 
baseline, whichever is lower.

V5.09 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
9.1 Study Design
This is a phase 1b/II open-label study evaluating the combination of docetaxel, prednisone, and ribociclib 
in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer and evidence of prior progression on 
abiraterone, enzalutamide, ARN-509, or the combination. The phase [ADDRESS_1062133] 3+[ADDRESS_1062134] stage of the phase 2 
study. 
The sample size of the phase 2 portion of the study is based upon the anticipated radiographic 
progression-free survival probability after 6 months of protocol therapy. Based upon prior studies with 
docetaxel monotherapy, this is estimated to be 35%, accounting for the high-risk features (post 
abiraterone and/or enzalutamide) of this study cohort. A PFS rate at 6 months of 55% would justify 
further study of the treatment combination. [ADDRESS_1062135] 14 patients are progression free at 6 months, the null hypothesis of a 35% PSA 
progression-free survival rate will be rejected. This design has 80% power with unidirectional level of 
significance of 0.[ADDRESS_1062136] size. The study design has 62% probability of 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_773375] 6 months progression free rate is 35% or less and a 8% probability of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_773376] 55% or more.
9.[ADDRESS_1062137] 
patient enrolled. During the Phase 2 portion of the study, it is estimated that approximately 2 patients per 
month will be enrolled, leading to an estimated accrual period during phase 2 of approximately 15 
months.
9.4 Interim Analyses
During the phase 1b portion of the study, if dose level IB (weekly docetaxel 30 mg/m2 in combination 
with ribociclib 200 mg/day) is declared a non-tolerable dose, the study will close to further accrual.
During phase 2, an interim analysis for safety and efficacy will be conducted after [ADDRESS_1062138] one dose of protocol therapy.

V5.09.6 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
Demographic variables will include age, race, ethnicity, and baseline height and weight. Additional 
disease specific features will be captured on electronic case report form, including:
Gleason grade at the time of diagnosis
Year of prostate cancer diagnosis
Extent of disease at the time of study entry (nodal, bone, visceral metastases (lung, liver, or 
both)).
Duration of response to primary androgen deprivation therapy
Type of resistance to prior abiraterone/enzalutamide/ARN-509 (primary = no PSA decline or 
radiographic response; secondary = all others)
Prior chemotherapy in the hormone-naïve setting (yes/no), and if yes, date of last chemotherapy 
administration
9.7 Study Endpoints 
9.7.1 Primary Endpoints
Phase 1b: Maximally tolerated dose and recommended phase 2 dose of ribociclib in combination with 
docetaxel plus prednisone, based upon evaluation of dose-limiting toxicities and adverse events measured 
using Common Toxicity Criteria version 4.03
Phase 2: Radiographic progression-free survival rate at 6 months from start of protocol therapy.
9.7.2 Secondary Endpoints:
Median radiographic progression-free survival
Objective response rate and median duration of response using RECIST 1.1 criteria, among 
patients with measurable disease at baseline
PSA progression-free survival (defined in Section 8)
PSA response rate (defined in Section 8)
Adverse events of the treatment combination using Common Toxicity Criteria version 4.03
Pharmacokinetic profile of ribociclib when given following administration of docetaxel and with 
concurrent prednisone use. PK parameters to be measured include estimated Cmax, AUC0-24, 
and Css.
9.7.3 Exploratory Endpoints:
Association between clinical outcomes on ribociclib plus docetaxel with baseline and percent 
change from baseline in SUVmax-ave on gallium citrate PET/CT (Optional - UCSF Patients 
Only)
Association between clinical outcomes and genomic markers of MYC/cell-cycle pathway, 
including MYC amplification/overexpression, validated MYC gene expression signature [INVESTIGATOR_32005], 
Rb1 deletion, CDK4/6 and cyclin D overexpression, assessed via metastatic tumor biopsy and 
CTCs and cell-free ctDNA
Pathway signature [CONTACT_773432], genomic, and proteomic factors predicting sensitivity to treatment 
combination using an unbiased approach with DiPSC bioinformatics tool

assessment for this analysis. Patients who discontinue therapy for evidence of clinical progression/clinical 
deterioration will be included in this analysis.
9.8.2 Analytic plan for the secondary study endpoints
For patients with measurable disease at baseline, the objective response rate will be descriptively 
reported. Among patients with objective response, the median duration of response will be estimated 
using the criteria outlined in Section 8.1.5.
The proportion of patients with greater than 50% decline from baseline in serum PSA will be reported in 
descriptive fashion. The probability distribution of the median time to PSA progression will be estimated 
using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method. Durations will be measured from day [ADDRESS_1062140] PSA assessment while receiving protocol therapy.
The incidence and severity of adverse events related to treatment regimen will be descriptively reported 
using Common Toxicity Criteria version 4.03.
The estimated AUC 0-24hr, Cmax, and Cstead-state serum concentration of ribociclib will be reported using 
descriptive statistics.
9.8.3 Analytic plan for the exploratory study endpoints
 Gallium citrate PET imaging (Optional - UCSF Patients Only):
A trained nuclear medicine physician blinded to the clinical outcomes of the patients will evaluate the 
reconstructed PET, CT, and fused PET/CT images using a PET volume computer-assisted reading 
software package. A positive lesion on gallium citrate PET will be defined as a focus of activity with at 
least 1.5 times higher SUV compared with mediastinal blood pool that is not attributable to  other 
etiologies of tracer distribution (e.g. inflammation, excretion). A volume of interest (VOI) will be 
semiautomatically placed around each lesion, and the calculated maximum standard uptake value 
(SUVmax) will be recorded for each lesion. Adjusted SUVmax data will then be averaged across all 
lesions within a given patient (SUVmax-avg). In order to avoid clustering effects, analysis will be limited 
to the five largest osseous metastases and all visceral metastases.
For the purposes of analyzing the association between SUVmax-ave and percent change from baseline on 
the paired scans respectively with subsequent clinical outcomes, the phase [ADDRESS_1062141] to objective response rate and PSA response proportion using Fisher’s exact test, 
and the log-rank test will be used to compare dichotomized groups with respect to radiographic 
progression-free survival and time to PSA progression.

V5.0Genomic predictors of response:
MYC amplification, overexpression, and signature [CONTACT_773433] a validated MYC expression signature, 
along with other markers of MYC/cell cycle proliferation, including Rb1 copy number/mutation status, 
CDK4/6 and cyclin D/E expression, will be ascertained using metastatic tumor biopsy, and whenever 
possible, from concurrent analysis of CTCs and cell-free ctDNA. The association between these 
variables and clinical outcomes will be performed using Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables and 
Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables.
No adjustment for multiple comparisons will be made for this exploratory study analysis. 
DiPSC-generated signature [CONTACT_497156]:
The study cohort will be dichotomized into those with either objective tumor response or clinical benefit 
from combination therapy (stable disease or greater for more than 6 months) versus those that do not have 
clinical benefit. The DiPSC tool integrates all measured clinical, genomic, and proteomic factors in an 
unbiased manner to determine those factors most tightly correlated with clinical benefit/response or 
resistance to protocol therapy. Those factors will be utilized to develop a ‘signature’ of benefit from 
taxane + CDK4/6 inhibitor combination therapy.

V5.010 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS
U.S. regulations require that a sponsor reports Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) occurring with use of its 
product in a clinical trial if it is unexpected and felt to be related to use of the drug. All SAEs that occur 
will be evaluated by [CONTACT_773412]/Investigator for 
reportability to FDA. The PCCTC will facilitate this evaluation with the site investigator and Lead Site 
Sponsor/Investigator. An Adverse Event should be identified, Serious Adverse Event and Expectedness 
determined and causality assessed by [CONTACT_773413].
10.1 Definitions
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical 
product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment.
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is an adverse event occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes:
a. Death
b. Life-threatening1
c. Persistent or significant disability/incapacity2
d. In patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
e. Congenital anomaly/birth defect
1The term "life-threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an event in which in the view of the 
initial reporter the patient was at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience as it occurred; it 
does not refer to an event which had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.
2A substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.
An event may not meet any of the above seriousness criteria but still be judged as medically serious. That 
is, important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_45790] a serious adverse drug experience when based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes (a-e) listed above.  Some examples of this type of event are:
blood dyscrasia without inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
convulsions without inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm without inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
development of drug dependency
drug abuse
overdose with an associated serious event, or required intervention to prevent impairment/damage
An Unexpected Adverse Event is not listed in the current US Package Insert (USPI) or an event that 
may be mentioned in the USPI, but differs from the event because of greater severity or specificity.
Causality is a determination of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the drug may have caused or 
contributed to an adverse event. It includes assessing temporal relationships dechallenge/rechallenge 
information, association (or lack of association) with underlying diseases, and the presence (or absence) 
or a lack of one or more likely causes.
The Investigator must determine if an adverse event is in some way related to the use of the study drug. 
This relationship should be described as follows:
CC# 145515
Ribociclib, Docetaxel, PrednisonePage 57 of 7704 FEB 2019
V5.0Unlikely:
The event is clearly due to causes distinct from the use of the study drug, such as a documented pre- 
existing condition, the effect of a concomitant medication, a new condition which, based on the 
pathophysiology of the condition, and the pharmacology of the study drug, would be unlikely related 
to the use of the study drug.
Possible:
The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug or the event 
follows a known response pattern to the study drug BUT the event could have been produced by [CONTACT_773414], based on the pathophysiology of the condition, and the 
pharmacology of the study drug, would be unlikely related to the use of the study drug or the event 
could be the effect of a concomitant medication
Probable:
The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug and the 
event follows a known response pattern to the study drug AND the event cannot have been 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_241804] a 
concomitant medication
Definite:
The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug, the event 
follows a known response pattern to the study drug and based on the known pharmacology of the 
study drug, the event is clearly related to the effect of the study drug
Unknown:
Based on the evidence available, causality cannot be ascribed

V5.011 DATA SAFETY MONITORING PLAN
The UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCSF-HDFCCC) Data Safety 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is responsible for monitoring data quality and patient safety for all 
UCSF-HDFCCC institutional clinical studies. PCCTC will facilitate this responsibility. A summary of 
DSMC and PCCTC activities for this study includes:
DSMC:
Review of subject data in each cohort
Approval of dose escalation by [CONTACT_14240] (or qualified alternate)
Monthly monitoring (depending on study accrual)
Review of suspected adverse reactions considered “serious”
Minimum of a yearly audit 
PCCTC:
• Weekly UCSF Site Committee Meetings: PCCTC will generate the necessary report and 
participate in the meeting and document minutes as necessary.
• UCSF DSMC Reports every 6 weeks: PCCTC will generate the report (in a format agreed upon 
at the onset of the protocol) and provide to Study Chair to submit to DSMC.
• Bi-Weekly Conference Calls with Participating Sites: PCCTC will coordinate, schedule, provide 
reports for this meeting in a format agreed upon at the onset of the protocol as well as participate 
and take minutes.
• PCCTC will perform monitoring per the Monitoring Plan (MP) and Data Management Plan 
(DMP) and these reports will be submitted to the Study Chair to submit to the DSMC.
• PCCTC will monitor grade 3 or 4 adverse events and report to the Study Chair if the incidence of 
adverse events are above the range stated in the IB so that the Study Chair may report this 
information to the DSMC.
• PCCTC will maintain an electronic regulatory binder for each of the participating sites and supply 
documentation to UCSF as needed.
11.1 Monitoring and Reporting Guidelines
All institutional Phase 1 therapeutic studies are designated with a high risk assessment. The data is 
monitored monthly as subjects are enrolled and includes all visits monitored up through the Dose 
Limiting Toxicity (DLT) period. At the time of dose escalation, a written report generated by [CONTACT_773415], all adverse events and suspected adverse 
reactions considered “serious,” and any Dose Limiting Toxicity as described in the protocol. The report 
will be reviewed by [CONTACT_773416] a 
request for more information will be issued within [ADDRESS_1062142]. The report is then 
reviewed at the subsequent DSMC meeting. In the event that the committee does not concur with the 
DSMC Chair’s decision, further study accrual is held while further investigation takes place.
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_14167]. The Study 
Chair is responsible for the overall conduct of the study and for monitoring its safety and progress at all 
participating sites. The Study Chair will conduct continuous review of data and subject safety and discuss 
each subject’s treatment at weekly UCSF Site Committee meetings. PCCTC will generate any necessary 
reports and participate in the meeting as necessary. The discussions are documented in the UCSF Site 
Committee meeting minutes. For each dose level, the discussion will include the number of patients, 
significant toxicities in accordance with the protocol, doses adjustments, and observed responses.

Ribociclib, Docetaxel, PrednisonePage 59 of 7704 FEB 2019
V5.0Dose Level Considerations
The PI/Study Chair, participating sites, investigators, and research coordinators will review enrollment 
for each dose level cohort during the weekly site committee meetings. The dose level for ongoing 
enrollment will be confirmed for each subject scheduled to be enrolled. Dose level assignments for any 
subject scheduled to begin treatment must be confirmed with Principal Investigator.
The DSMC will be responsible for monitoring all data entered in Medidata Rave®. Approval for dose 
escalation must be obtained from DSMC chair.
11.2 Review and Oversight Requirements
11.2.1 Adverse Event Monitoring
All clinically significant adverse events (AEs), whether or not unexpected, and whether or not 
considered to be associated with the use of study drug, will be entered into  Medidata Rave®.
All clinically significant adverse events entered into Medidata Rave® will be reviewed on a 
weekly basis at the UCSF Genitourinary Oncology Site Committee. The Site Committee will 
review and discuss the selected toxicity, the toxicity grade, and the attribution of relationship of 
the adverse event to the administration of the study drug(s). The weekly reports for this meeting 
will be prepared  by [CONTACT_773417].  In addition, all suspected adverse reactions considered “serious” 
are entered into Medidata Rave® and will be reviewed and monitored by [CONTACT_773418], which take 
place every six (6) weeks. The report for this meeting will be prepared by [CONTACT_773419].
If a death occurs during the treatment phase of the study or within [ADDRESS_1062143] 
administration of the study drug(s) and is determined to be related either to the investigational 
drug or any research related procedure, the Study Chair at the UCSF Coordinating Center or the 
assigned designee and PCCTC must be notified within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the event from the participating site(s) and the Study Chair must then notify the 
DSMC Chair or qualified alternate within [ADDRESS_1062144] may be 
by [CONTACT_14223] e-mail.
11.2.2 Serious Adverse Event Reporting: UCSF Requirements
Serious Adverse Event reporting will be facilitated by [CONTACT_773420](IRB) Regulations and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
guidelines.
UCSF IRB website for guidance in reporting serious adverse events:
http://irb.ucsf.edu/adverse-event
FDA website for guidance in reporting serious adverse events: 
http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/default.htm
For clinical trials conducted under an IND, SAE reporting will in accordance with Code of 
Federal Regulations Title 21 volume 5 Part 312 subpart B (21CFR312.32): 
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=312.32

CC# [ADDRESS_1062145] be reported to 
PCCTC  and the DSMC Chair or his designee within 24 hours 
of becoming aware of the event. This will be done by [CONTACT_773421]. The reporting investigator will confirm the verbal communication via e-mail and 
will copy the e-mail to the DSMC Administrator.
If the above action occurs in a multiple-institutional clinical trial coordinated by [CONTACT_25999], PCCTC 
will insure that all participating sites are notified.
11.2.3 SAE Reporting: [COMPANY_001] Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_58811] (if 
applicable), IRB, and [COMPANY_001] Pharmaceuticals Drug Safety and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_066] 
(DS&E).
All events reported to the FDA by [CONTACT_109] 
3500A (MedWatch Form), if applicable.
To ensure patient safety, every SAE, regardless of suspected causality, occurring after the 
patient has provided informed consent and until at least [ADDRESS_1062146] the relationship of each SAE to each specific study 
treatment (if there is more than one study treatment), complete the SAE Report Form in 
English, and send the completed, signed form along with the [COMPANY_001] provided fax cover 
sheet to the [COMPANY_001] Oncology Drug Safety and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] (DS&E) department  
within [ADDRESS_1062147] as the original SAE Report. Each re-
occurrence, complication, or progression of the original event should be reported as a follow-up 
to that event regardless of when it occurs. The follow-up information should describe whether 
the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated, whether the blind was broken or 
not, and whether the patient continued or withdrew from study participation. 
If the SAE is not previously documented in the Investigator’s Brochure or Package Insert (new 
occurrence) and is thought to be related to the [COMPANY_001] study treatment, an oncology [COMPANY_001] 
Drug Safety and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] (DS&E) department associate may urgently require further 
information from the investigator for Health Authority reporting. [COMPANY_001] may need to issue an 
Investigator Notification (IN), to inform all investigators.

CC# [ADDRESS_1062148] 
be reported to [COMPANY_001] within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy should be

V5.0APPENDIX 2: List of Prohibited Medications
In general, the use of any concomitant medication deemed necessary for the care of the patient is 
permitted in this study, except as specifically prohibited below. Combination administration of 
study drugs could result in drug-drug interactions (DDI) that could potentially lead to reduced 
activity or enhanced toxicity of the concomitant medication and/or ribociclib.
The following lists are not comprehensive and are only meant to be used as a guide. The lists are based 
on the Oncology Clinical Pharmacology Drug-Drug Interaction Database (release date: [ADDRESS_1062153] 2012), 
which was compi[INVESTIGATOR_11993]’s P450 Drug Interaction Table 
(http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/main-table/) and supplemented with the FDA Draft 
Guidance for Industry, Drug Interaction Studies – Study Design, Data Analysis, and Implications for 
Dosing and Labeling (February 2012) 
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/guidances/ucm2923
62. pdf), and the University of Washington’s Drug Interaction Database 
(http://www.druginteractioninfo.org/). For current lists of medications that may cause QT prolongation 
and/or torsades de pointes (TdP), refer to the CredibleMeds® website (https://crediblemeds.org/).

V5.01 NTI = narrow therapeutic index drugs whose exposure-response indicates that increases in their exposure levels by [CONTACT_12147] (e.g., Torsades de Pointes). or drugs which have 
<2-fold difference in the minimum toxic concentrations and minimum effective concentrations in the blood.
[ADDRESS_1062155] provided is as of January 2018.Check https www crediblemeds.org/healthcare-providers/drug-list for the most   
    updated list. 
  As far as possible, avoid co-administration of QT prolonging drugs or any other drugs with the potential to increase the      
  risk of drug-related QT prolongation (e.g., via a potential DDI that increases the exposure of ribociclib or the exposure of  
  the QT prolonging drug). A definitive list of drugs with a known risk, possible risk, or conditional risk of QT prolongation 
  and/or Torsades de Pointes (TdP) is available online at qtdrugs.org.

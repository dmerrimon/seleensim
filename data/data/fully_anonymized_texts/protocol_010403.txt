This study is to be performed in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), the ethical 
principles that have their origi n in the Declaration of Helsink i, Title [ADDRESS_669945] of the deaths related to p ortal hypertension. The median 
survival period in humans following diagnosis of cirrhosis is s ix years ( La Vecchia 1994 ; Pagliaro 
1994 ). Currently little effective therapy is commercially available  f o r  t r e a t m e n t  o f  p o r t a l  
hypertension.  
In the study of portal hypertension, there is key interest in m ediators such as thromboxane A2 
(TxA 2), F2-isoprostanes, nitric oxi de, and endothelin-1 as well as t he thromboxane receptor (TPr) 
which has TxA [ADDRESS_669946] been shown 
to mediate and promote fibrosis via TPr activation in hepatic s tellate cells (HSC) from rats treated 
with cirrhosis-inducing carbon te trachloride (Acq uaviva 2013). HSCs play a significant role in the 
progression of cirrhosis by [CONTACT_516903].   
In addition to the fibrotic proces ses, many of these same media tors have a more immediate effect 
on the blood flow through the hepatic sinusoids. TxA 2 serves as a vasoconstrictor , while nitric 
oxide vasodilates in the healt hy liver (Yokoyama  2005). However , in the cirrhotic liver, studies in 
rats have revealed an increase in the hepatic production of TxA 2 which would then further increase 
portal hypertension via vasocons triction (Graupera 2003; Rodrig uez-Vilarruplas 2012).  Also, the 
compensatory feedback between TxA 2 as a vasoconstrictor and nitr ic oxide as the inhibitory 
vasodilator seems to disappear i n the cirrhotic liver (Yokoyama  2005).            
Blockade of thromboxane-mediated signaling in the TPr has revea led an anti-fibrotic effect in two 
rat models of cirrhotic disease (Rosado 2013 ). Additionally, interrupting this signaling pathway 
lowered portal pressure suggesti ng a reduction in hepatic vascu lar resistance.    
Clinical trials utilizing antagonists of other potent vasoconst rictors of the hepatic portal system 
(e.g. endothelin-1) have been com pleted with little success, su ggesting that TxA 2 signaling may 
be of particular importance (T ripathi 2006). Therefore, the cur rent study is being conducted to

Cumberland Pharmaceuti cals Inc. Ifetroban Injection and Capsule s 
CPI_IFE-005; Protocol Amendment 02_24Jul2017  Page [ADDRESS_669947], ifetroban, in patients with portal 
hypertension. 
5.2 Stage of Development  
This is a Phase II exploratory study to determine the safety of  oral ifetroban compared to placebo 
in patients with portal hyperten sion. The efficacy of oral ifet roban compared to placebo in reducing 
portal pressure and liver fibro sis will also be explored. 
5.3 Patient Population 
Adult patients with liver cirrhosis, confirmed by [CONTACT_145139],  laboratory features, and/or 
elastography findings will be c onsidered for study participatio n. Portal pressure s are measured by 
[CONTACT_516904] (HVPG) method during scree ning. A HVPG reading greater 
than 5 mm Hg defines portal hypertension, while higher HVPG val ues > [ADDRESS_669948] 
patients with a baseline mean HVPG of > [ADDRESS_669949] of care for treatment of por tal hypertension focuses on 
management of symptoms, including mechanical hemostasis of vari ces, pharmacologic support 
with B-blockers and surgical relief of the increased portal pre ssure with the transjugular 
intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. By [CONTACT_516905], administration of 
ifetroban may treat this condition at a more foundational level , allowing both short- and long-term 
relief of portal hypertension and c irrhosis through a reduction  in vasoconstricti on and fibrosis. 
The intervention will be adminis tered in both an intravenous an d an oral form. The initial dose of 
ifetroban is intravenous and a potential immediate effect due t o vasodilation will be studied; 
subsequently, oral dosing will c ontinue at home for 3 months du ring which time the disease will 
be further monitored.         
5.5 Risk-Benefit Assessment 
Clinical history with the use of ifetroban in patients with car diovascular disease or cardiac risk 
factors, and in patients with hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) or asp irin exacerbated respi[INVESTIGATOR_23697] (AERD) has not identifie d any major risks with ifetroba n use. Adverse events seen more

Cumberland Pharmaceuti cals Inc. Ifetroban Injection and Capsule s 
CPI_IFE-005; Protocol Amendment 02_24Jul2017  Page [ADDRESS_669950] udied in cardiovascular trials. The 
mechanism of action of ifetroban ( i.e. TPr antagonist resulting in inhibition of platelet aggregation ) 
suggests the potential for an in creased incidence of bleeding. The available clinical data have not 
demonstrated an increase in hemorrhagic events; however, subjec ts enrolled in ifetroban trials 
should be monitored for events such as spontaneous hemorrhage, decreased hemoglobin, and 
prolonged bleeding time.  Any hemorrhagic event occurring in th is study is reported as an adverse 
event as directed in Section 10.3.  Additionally, platelet func tion testing is performed according to 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].Ifetroban has not been investigated in patients  with portal hypertension, so no 
benefit is proven; however, as described above in 5.1 and 5.4, there is evidence that blocking the 
TPr may decrease portal hyperten sion via both acute and chronic  mechanisms.            
6 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
The exploratory objectives of t his study are to evaluate the fo llowing in cirrhotic patients with 
portal hypertension that are  treated with ifetroban:  
 Safety 
 Portal pressure 
 Serum liver enzymes 
 Surrogate markers of liver fibrosis and inflammation 
 Occurrence of variceal bleeds  
6.1 Study Endpoints 
The study objectives will be assessed utilizing the following e ndpoints; see 8.2.1  for details of the 
assessments:  
 To evaluate the safety of ifet roban treatment in this populatio n, the incidence and severity 
of adverse events will be compare d between the ifetroban and th e placebo groups.  
 To evaluate the effect of ifetroban treatment on portal pressur e in this population, the 
change from baseline in the mea n HVPG will be calculated at [ADDRESS_669951] (IMP) dose

CPI_IFE-005; Protocol Amendment 02_24Jul2017  Page 14  To evaluate the effect of ifetroban treatment on serum liver en zymes in this population, the 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST)  and alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) values on Day [ADDRESS_669952] bo patients.   
 To evaluate the effect of ifetroban treatment on liver fibrosis  and inflammation in this 
population, the change from baseline to Day 45 and Day 90 will be calculated for ifetroban 
and placebo patients in the following assessments: 
o Aspartate aminotransferase/platelet ratio (APRI) 
o Specified serum biomarkers 
 To evaluate the occurrence of v ariceal bleeds in this populatio n, the incidence and severity 
of any variceal bleeds will be documented.  
7 STUDY DESCRIPTION 
7.1 Study Design 
 Phase II, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_48085] t study. 
 Thirty patients will be enrolled; twenty patients will be alloc ated to ifetroban and ten will 
receive placebo.   
 Each qualified subject will rema in in the study for 90 days.  E nrollment for the entire study 
is expected to take twelve months.  
 A schedule of assessments is summarized in Table 8.1-[ADDRESS_669953] created prior to the study start, and communica tes the assignment to the unblinded 
site personnel in writing (email  or fax). The written records w ill be maintained at the site and at 
the sponsor to document the assignment for each subject.

are no antidotes for ifetroban, unblinding is not likely to lea d to a change in treatment of the patient 
beyond holding or discontinuing the IMP. As such, unblinding sh ould be a rare occurrence. 
If time permits, and if signifi cant risk is not introduced to t he patient, the investigator will contact 
[CONTACT_516906]. If 
agreement is reached that unblinding should occur, the blinded clinical monitor will mediate 
contact [CONTACT_516907], as needed, to disclose the 
treatment assignment. All discus sions on this topic, including the treatment disclosure, if 
applicable, will be documented and filed in the study files.  
In emergency scenarios, the Investigator may contact [CONTACT_516908] d clinical monitor directly who 
will then mediate communication with the unblinded sponsor cont act.     
Any intentional or unintentiona l breaking of the blind at an in vestigative site must be reported to 
the Sponsor immediately.

8.2.1 Description of Key Study Assessments 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hepatic Venous Pressure Gradient (HVPG) Measurement  
A recorder capable of generating permanent tracings (paper and/ or electronic) must be used for 
this study. Following standard medical process regarding sedati on, aseptic preparation of the 
venous access site and catheter care, initial venous access is established through a route and method 
chosen by [CONTACT_26359]. Ultimately, a  balloon-tipped catheter is placed in 
the main right hepatic vein unde r fluoroscopic guidance until t he tip is approximately [ADDRESS_669969]  the hepatic venous pressure 
gradient:  
1. The balloon is inflated and dye is injected to confirm complete  occlusion of the catheterized 
vein. Dye that circumvents the balloon or is shunted to other v enous return will require the 
catheter to be repositioned.   
2. The inflated catheter is left in place for approximately 45 sec onds while pressure is 
recorded and stabilized [wedge d hepatic venous pressure (WHVP)] . 
3. The balloon is completely deflated and the catheter is retrieve d proximally until the tip is 
approximately 2 cm fro m the vena cava.  
4. Pressure recordings continue for approximately 45 seconds [free  hepatic venous pressure 
(FHVP)]. 
5. After [ADDRESS_669970] two additional times.   
7. The hepatic venous pressure gradient is measured as the differe nce between the stable 
WHVP reading and the subsequent stable FHVP reading. At the Bas eline and Day 90 time 
points, pressure gradients will be recorded until three HVPG va lues are all within 1 mm 
Hg of each other. .  For the +15 and +30 minute recordings, the re will not be sufficient time 
to repeat more than three readi ngs, so the initial three indivi dual HVPG values will be 
accepted.   
The three  valid HVPG values, plus the mean, are recorded in th e study case report form for each 
time point.

Cumberland Pharmaceuti cals Inc. Ifetroban Injection and Capsule s 
CPI_IFE-005; Protocol Amendment 02_21Jul2017  Page 25 [IP_ADDRESS]  Platelet Function Assessment 
Platelet function will be measured during screening and at Day 10 by [CONTACT_516919] (ROTEM) in study centers that have the abili ty to perform ROTEM.  In other 
centers, thromboelastography (TEG ) will be utilized for the sam e purpose.  A citrated blood sample 
is drawn from all patients and the center’s laboratory standard  procedures are followed.  At a 
minimum, the maximum amplitude ( or maximum clot firmness) of th e clot profile is measured to 
assess platelet function; however , other values reflecting clot ting time, clot formation time, 
fibrinolysis, etc. w ill be collected in the case report.  
During the treatment or follow-up period, in any subject that e xhibits a clinical bleed, as directed 
in protocol Section 10.3, a repeat ROTEM or TEG analysis will b e performed at the initial onset 
of the bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], preferably prior to any associated tre atment intervention.  The same 
technology (ROTEM or TEG) that was  employed in the screening pr ocess will be used in cases of 
bleeding during the treatme nt phase of the study.       
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serum Biomarkers for Fibrosis and Inflammation 
Serum will be collected from blood draws at Baseline, Day 45 an d Day 90/Early-termination for 
measurement at a central laborat ory of specialized biomarkers o f hepatic fibrosis and 
inflammation. Approximately [ADDRESS_669971] been correlated with the extent of fibrosis and inflammation 
confirmed on liver biopsy (Deng 2015). Therefore, the levels of  key biomarkers may assist in the 
grading of liver disease or mon itoring of treatment progress an d avoid the risks and more-intensive 
effort behind liver biopsies. Additionally, there is evidence t hat other biomarkers may predict a 
patient’s HVPG and provide information about the presence or pr obability for varices without 
performing an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) (Buck 2014). Dat a showed that 86% of 
cirrhosis patients with HVPG below [ADDRESS_669972] results from the Safet y Labs ([IP_ADDRESS]) at Baseline, Day 45 
and Day 90 are used to calculate the Aspartate Aminotransferase /Platelet Ratio (APRI). The APRI 
is easily calculated from readily-available lab parameters, yet  is a good estimator of hepatic 
fibrosis. In a prospective study, the ability of the APRI to ac curately score fibrosis in HVC patients 
compared to liver biopsy was deemed good to excellent with and area under the curve of the 
receiver operator ch aracteristics (AUC-R OC) of 0.889 (Snyder 20 06).

CPI_IFE-005; Protocol Amendment 02_21Jul2017  Page 26 [IP_ADDRESS]  Incidence of Variceal Bleeds 
The occurrence and details of any variceal bleeds during the tr eatment period will be captured in 
a dedicated module of the Case Report Form (CRF) and occurrence s will be reported as endpoints 
in the study results. If the bleed meets the criteria of an adv erse event, it will also be captured as 
an adverse event according to standard GCP reporting processes.    
Variceal bleeding is defined for  this study as the presence of either reported or witnessed 
hematemesis, melenemesis, melena , or bright red blood per rectu m and a concomitant drop in 
hemoglobin of 1 gm/dL compare d to baseline and no other source of bleeding.   
Additional diagnostics, including upper gastrointestinal endosc opy, will not be ordered by [CONTACT_60658]; however, results from any standard of care proc edures should be captured in the 
study records.  
Treatment for any bleeding will be ordered at the Investigator’ s discretion according to standard 
of care.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Labs 
Blood sample collection for safety laboratory assessments will be performed within protocol-
specified time periods and according to the site’s standard pra ctices for drawing and processing 
samples. The following analytes are measured by [CONTACT_779]’s loca l laboratory and evaluated by [CONTACT_516920] r eference ranges provided by [CONTACT_516921]:

8.2.2 Description of Screening/Baseline Period 
Before the initiation of study-sp ecific screening assessments, the patient or l egal authorized 
representative must be given a c omplete explanation of the purp ose and evaluations of the study.  
Subsequently, the patient or leg al authorized representative mu st sign and receive a copy of an 
Informed Consent Form that was approved by [CONTACT_16018]’s governi ng Institutional Review Board 
(IRB). Once informed consent has been obtained, the eligibility  of the patient to participate in this 
study will be determined by [CONTACT_516922] e inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
Screening/Baseline Period assessments will also be performed ac cording to the protocol to 
determine eligibility. Only elig ible patients will be randomize d to receive IMP.  
During the Screening/Baseline Period, the following evaluations  will be performed to determine 
the patient’s eligibility for this study and document their bas eline disease state; allowable time 
windows are described in Table 8.1-1 : 
 Demographic data  
 Review and documentation of medi cal history. Subjects must be a sked about patient or 
familial history of bleeding diat hesis and any known risk facto rs for bleeding.  Resolved 
diseases or past procedures that are not significant to the dis ease under study should be 
captured if they occurred in the previous five years. Other his tory should be captured 
regardless of time reference.   
 A serum or urine pregnancy test will be performed on all women of child-bearing potential.

CPI_IFE-005; Protocol Amendment 02_21Jul2017  Page 28  A baseline physical examination w ill be performed for all signi ficant body systems.    
 Safety labs will be drawn and processed according to standard l ocal processes. Analytes to 
be measured are listed above in [IP_ADDRESS] .  Per inclusion criterion #2 (See Section 7.4.1 ), 
historical lab values for ALT, A ST, ALKP and bilirubin are requ ired from between [ADDRESS_669973] consent, and 
the screening assessments, including a full safety lab panel (S ee Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) will be 
performed 15 to 90 days later, with in the defined screening per iod. 
 Additional serum will be collected for submission to the centra l lab for biomarker analysis 
as per the labor atory manual. 
 Active HBV and HCV must be ruled out prior to enrollment.  If t he patient’s HBV status 
is unknown, a Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) test will be performed.  If the patient’s 
HCV status is unknown, an HCV antibody test and/or, if needed, an HCV RNA test will be 
performed.    
 Baseline HVPG measurements are p erformed within t he [ADDRESS_669974] IMP 
administration. However, as detailed in 8.2.3  below, this screening measurement will likely 
be performed immedia tely prior to IMP a dministration.   
 Baseline vital signs are taken i n the six hours prior to first IMP treatment: heart rate; 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]; body temperat ure; and indirect blood pressure .  
 If the subject has been diagnos ed with cirrhosis, but by a meth od other than those listed in 
inclusion criterion #1 (See Section 7.4.1 ), a VCTE will be performed to confirm a diagnosis 
of cirrhosis as defi ned in this protocol.   
8.2.[ADDRESS_669975] dose of IMP, 
the ifetroban or placebo injecti on needs to be prepared before complete eligibility is confirmed to 
allow for pharmacy preparation t ime. The Investigator will orde r the preparation of IMP injection 
based on the “provisional eligib ility confirmation” of a new su bject. The unblinded pharmacist 
will obtain the treatment assignment directly from the unblinde d sponsor representative at that 
time and prepare the infusi on per the instructions in [IP_ADDRESS] . If the subject is confirmed as eligible 
following the baseline HVPG asse ssment (i.e., mean HVPG > 8 mm Hg and < 18 mm Hg), the

an assessment of the mean HVPG will be made according to the pr ocedure detailed in [IP_ADDRESS] . 
Additional assessments will be initiated at both [ADDRESS_669978] will be dispensed a  quantity of 300 IMP capsules (4  bottles of 75 cap sules each) with 
instructions to begin a daily dose of 5 capsules (total 250 mg ifetroban or placebo) on the morning 
following the infusion. Drug administration at home should gene rally occur in the morning, but, if 
this does not happen on a given day, the dose should still be g iven at a later point during that day 
so that no dose is missed. All fi ve capsules are taken in the s ame epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  Subjects are instructed 
to note any missed days of oral IMP and report those to study s taff.  Missed doses are not to be 
taken on a subsequent day.   
Enrolled subjects will be trained on how to identify petechial,  ecchymosis, and other signs of 
bleeding and they will be directed to discontinue further study  medication and contact [CONTACT_516924] y such symptoms.    
[IP_ADDRESS]  Day [ADDRESS_669979] a clinic visit on Day 10 (+/- 3 days) for a s afety follow-up evaluation. The visit 
will consist of a physical examination, including inspection fo r any symptoms of platelet 
dysfunction, vital sign measuremen t, and local lab assessment o f safety labs, including a platelet 
function assessment by [CONTACT_516925] . Consistent with the entire  treatment period, changes in 
concomitant medications and any spo ntaneously-reported adverse events will be recorded.       
The subject must bring all bottles of IMP to the visit. The bli nded study coordinator performs a 
drug compliance evaluation and cal culates the percentage of com pliance based on the amount of 
capsules missing since the Day 1 dispensation. If compliance is  not 100%, the subject is re-
educated on the proper dosing regimen and the importance of bei ng fully compliant with study 
drug administration. A plan to follow-up additionally with the subject (e.g., by [CONTACT_516926] 125794 [IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Study Protocol

8.2.5 Potential Drug-induced Liver Injury 
Subjects in this study are enroll ed with confirmed pre-existing  hepatic disease; therefore, published 
guidelines ( http://www.fda.gov/downloads/D rugs/.../Guidances/UCM174090.pdf ) for monitoring 
potential drug-induced liver inj ury (DILI) are available but do  not apply to the same degree.  
A modified protocol is followed when patients in the treatment or follow-up phases show evidence 
of possible DILI and need to be m onitored or have their study t reatment modified accordingly.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Criteria for Initiating Protocol for Potential DILI Cases  
Any subject meeting any one of the  following criteria during th e treatment or follow-up phase 
will enter the protocol (See Section [IP_ADDRESS] below) for potenti al DILI cases:  
 An elevation of ALT or AST great er than 2 X the baseline value for that patient 
 An elevation of total bilirubi n greater than 1.5 X the baseline  value for that patient 
 Any increase in bilirubin seen i n conjunction with suspect hype rsensitivity signs or 
symptoms such as fever, rash, e osinophilia, nausea, vomiting, o r right upper quadrant 
pain mandates that the subject e nter the monito ring protocol, b ut also discontinue study 
drug immediately .    
[IP_ADDRESS]  Protocol for Potential DILI Cases 
All assessments made during the  monitoring of potential DILI ca ses will be captured in the CRF.   
Initial Evaluation 
Any subject that meets a criterion in Section [IP_ADDRESS] should ha ve liver enzymes and bilirubin levels 
repeated within 48 hours to conf irm the abnormalities and detec t if they are increasing or 
decreasing.  At that unscheduled  visit, the following assessmen ts will be performed and additional 
information collected: 
 Physical Exam with detailed assessment of symptoms 
 History of concomitant drug use  (including nonprescription medi cations and 
supplements), alcohol use, rec reational drug use, and special d iets.

Cumberland Pharmaceuti cals Inc. Ifetroban Injection and Capsule s 
CPI_IFE-005; Protocol Amendment 02_21Jul2017  Page 32  History of exposure to envir onmental chemical agents 
A diagnostic plan should be formulated and initiated by [CONTACT_14520], if appropriate based on 
history, physical exam findings and laboratory results, to rule  out additional poten tial causes of 
liver disease such as acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, a nd E; autoimmune or alcoholic

following guidance may be used f or reference and assistance: 
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/D rugs/.../Guidances/UCM174090.pdf   
 
The Medical Monitor should be con sulted as well in the decision  to continue or dis continue study 
drug.  
  
The decision to discontinue or temporarily interrupt study drug  treatment should generally be 
based on the following factors:  
 Stability or directi onal changes of ALT, AST, and bilirubin  
 Elapsed time during which values h ave remained higher than base line 
 The degree to which the baseline ALT, AST and bilirubin were hi gh relative to the upper 
limit of normal 
Please note that Section [IP_ADDRESS]  directs the study drug to be stopped for cases of elevated bil irubin 
with concurrent symptoms such a s fever, rash, eosinophilia, nau sea, vomiting, or right upper 
quadrant pain.  
 
Follow-up 
All trial subjects s howing possible DILI should be followed unt il all abnormalities return to normal 
or to the expected baseline stat e given the pre-existing liver disease.

Subjects will be encouraged to complete the study; however, the y may voluntarily withdraw at any 
time and for any reason. The Investigator will describe in the CRF the reason for the subject’s 
choice to discontinue.   
A subject may be removed from the study for the following reaso ns; in each case, the decision to 
discontinue should be confirme d following consultation between the Investigator and Sponsor: 
 Adverse event (AE): If a subject experiences an AE for which co ntinued study participation 
presents an unacceptable consequence or risk to the subject, th e subject may be 
discontinued under the Investig ator’s judgement. See also Section 9.2 . 
 Subject non-compliance: A subject ’s past, current, or anticipat ed inability to comply with 
study visits, clinical trial med ication or other processes requ ired by [CONTACT_507655]. The subject’s compliance in taking 
oral medication at home should be  within 90 and 110% at all vis its.    
 Enrollment violation: If it is realized after the initiation of  investigational treatment (or 
placebo) that a subject did not meet all eligibility requiremen ts, the Sponsor and 
Investigator will discuss whether it is safe, ethical, and scie ntifically sound to keep the 
subject in the study or to  discontinue the subject.   
 Concurrent Treatment: If a subject initiates a procedure or med ication that may interfere 
with their study conduct or for w hich study invo lvement may pos e a significant risk to the 
prescribed therapy, the subject may be discontinued. This also includes the use of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_516898] 7.5 .     
 TIPS or shunt procedure duri ng the treatment period.  
 Liver transplant during t he treatment period.   
 Other reasons: Following discussion between the Sponsor and Inv estigator, subjects may 
be discontinued from the study for  reasons other than those lis ted above.

Subjects encountering adverse ev ents meeting either of the crit eria below will be discontinued 
from study drug but continued to be monitored for safety.  The Investigator will plan to remain 
blinded and consult with the sponsor’s Medical Monitor and a de cision will be made and 
documented regarding continued patient monitoring and criteria under which study drug would be 
re-initiated or additional effi cacy assessments would be perfor med.    
 Any grade 4 or higher adverse event defined by [CONTACT_3989] (See Section 10.1.2  for guidance) 
 Any grade [ADDRESS_669985] consents and there is 
no additional risk to the patient by [CONTACT_516928] . Following the visit, reasonable 
efforts should be made to monitor the subjec t for AEs, as appro priate.  
Subjects that are discontinued may be replaced, as needed. The decision will be made on a case-

10.1 Definitions 
10.1.1  Adverse Event Definitions 
Adverse events are defined according to ICH Harmonized Triparti te Guideline E2A. 
Adverse event (AE)  
Any untoward medical occurrence in  a patient or clinical trial subject administered a trial product 
whether it has a causal relati onship with the s tudy treatment o r not.  
An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintende d sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporall y asso ciat ed w ith the use o f a 
medicinal product, whether or not c onsidered related to the med icinal product. 
IND 125794 [IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Study Protocol  
Cumberland Pharmaceuti cals Inc. Ifetroban Injection and Capsule s 
CPI_IFE-005; Protocol Amendment 02_21Jul2017  Page 36 The following are not considered an AE: 
 Pre-planned procedure (documente d as concomitant illness on the  CRF at screening) unless 
the condition for which the procedure was planned has worsened from the first trial related 
activity after the subject has si gned the informed consent form . 
 Pre-existing conditions found duri ng and as a result of screeni ng procedures. 
Serious adverse event (SAE)  
An AE that meets any of the following criteria:  
 results in death  
 is immediately life-threatening (t his refers to an event in whi ch the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event t hat hypothetically might have 
caused death if it was more severe)  
 requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_516899] n of existing  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
 results in persistent or signi ficant disability or incapacity 
 is a congenital anom aly or birth defect 
 is judged medically important in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_54571] r (this refers to an event that 
may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may 
jeopardize the subject or may req uire intervention to prevent o ne of the other outcomes 
listed. 
Non-serious adverse event  
Any adverse event that does not  meet the definition of an SAE. 
Unexpected adverse event 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered "u nexpected" if it is not listed in the 
investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or se verity that has been observed.  
"Unexpected," as used in this d efinition, also refers to advers e events or suspected adverse 
reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as oc curring with a class of drugs or as 
anticipated from the pharmacologi cal properties of the drug, bu t are not specifically mentioned as 
occurring with the particular  drug under investigation.

Cumberland Pharmaceuti cals Inc. Ifetroban Injection and Capsule s 
CPI_IFE-005; Protocol Amendment 02_21Jul2017  Page 37 10.1.2  Adverse Event Assessment Definitions 
Anticipated 
Anticipated events include known consequences of an underlying disease or the condition under 
investigation, events anticipat ed from any background regimen, events common in the study 
population, or re-emergence or worsening of a condition relativ e to pretreatment baseline. 
Severity 
The reported event terms and severity grading of each event rep orted in this study adhere to the 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grading criteria, which is 
coordinated by [CONTACT_516929]. 
Resources including quick refere nces, governance documents and data files of adv erse events can 
be found here: http://evs.nci  nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html   
The Investigator, with  support from the st udy monitor, will rep ort adverse events using the lowest 
level terms, as identified by [CONTACT_516930] (MedDRA) 
http://www.meddra.org/ , whenever possible.   
The severity of each event adhere s to the severity grades estab lished by [CONTACT_3989]: 
Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagn ostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local  or noninvasive intervention i ndicated; limiting age-
appropriate instrumental ac tivities of daily living.   
Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately li fe-threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_185854]; d isabling; limiting self-
care activities of daily living.  
Grade 4  Life-threatening conseque nces; urgent intervention ind icated.  
Grade 5  Death related to AE. 
The investigator will determine the severity for each individua l event utilizing the following 
guidance; listed here http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-
14_QuickReference_5x7.pdf :      
Relationship/Relatedness 
The causal relationship between an adverse event and the trial product is assessed by [CONTACT_221679]: 
IND 125794 [IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Study Protocol  
Cumberland Pharmaceuti cals Inc. Ifetroban Injection and Capsule s 
CPI_IFE-005; Protocol Amendment 02_21Jul2017  Page 38 Probable : Good reasons and sufficient docum entation to assu me a causal relationship. 
Possible : A causal relationship is con ceivable and cannot be dismissed  
Unlikely : The event is most likely rela ted to an etiology other than th e trial product. 
An adverse event is considered causally related to the use of t he trial product when the relationship 
assessment is probable or possible. Events assessed as unlikely  related to the use of trial product 
will be considered as having no r elationship to treatment. 
Outcome 
The outcome of an adverse event is assessed by [CONTACT_516931]: 
Recovered : Fully recovered, or by [CONTACT_516932]-related activity after th e subject signed the informed consent. 
Recovering : The condition is improving and the subject is expected to rec over from the event. 
This term should only be used when t he subject has completed th e trial. 
Recovered with sequelae : As a result of the AE the subject suffered persistent and sig nificant 
disability/incapacity (e.g. became blind, deaf, paralyzed). Any  AE recovered with sequelae 
should be classified as an SAE. 
Not recovered : The subject’s condition has not i mproved and the symptoms are  unchanged 
Unknown : The subject’s condition is unknow n. This term should only be used when no other 
definition is possibl e e.g., the subject is lost to follow-up. 
10.[ADDRESS_669987]/visit/end of post-tr eatment follow-up period.  
At each contact [CONTACT_93425], the subject must be aske d about adverse events in an objective 
manner like: “Have you experienced any problems since the last contact?” 
Adverse events according to the  definition, either observed by [CONTACT_98756], must be recorded by [CONTACT_237215].  A dverse events must be recorded in 
the case report forms. For serious  adverse events, the SAE form  must also be filled in.

CPI_IFE-005; Protocol Amendment 02_21Jul2017  Page [ADDRESS_669988] be informed 
accordingly. 
The Investigator will inform the health authorities and indepen dent ethics committees (IECs)/IRBs 
in accordance with local requirements in force and the Internat ional Conference on Harmonization 
(ICH) guidelines for GCP and the European Union (EU) Directive 2001/20/EC / Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Part  312.32 (5). 
Adverse Events Starting after Trial Completion 
Adverse events occurring after trial completion, which the inve stigator considers to be related to 
the investigational medicinal product must be rep orted to the s ponsor.  
10.3 Study-Specific Guidance Pertaining to Adverse Events 
Patient interactions, including ex aminations, tests, procedures  and treatments that are ordered 
based on the occurrence of cirrhosis decompensation or hemorrha gic events are captured in the 
CRF in the Concomitant Treatment , Platelet Function, Unschedule d Visits, and/or Comments 
Modules.    
10.3.[ADDRESS_669989] cases, an occurrence of a  gastrointestinal hemorrhage d uring the treatment phase will meet 
the definition of an adverse event. Since variceal bleeds are a n endpoint of the  study, specific 
details surrounding such an occurr ence are collected on a dedic ated module of the CRF.  However, 
the same event is also added to the Adverse Event module of the  CRF so that safety listings for the 
study are complete. 
Incidences of variceal bleeds will also follow the protocol for  general bleeding as directed below 
in Section 10.3.3.    
IND 125794 [IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Study Protocol  
Cumberland Pharmaceuti cals Inc. Ifetroban Injection and Capsule s 
CPI_IFE-005; Protocol Amendment 02_21Jul2017  Page 40 10.3.2  Cirrhosis Decompensation 
All events that are considered decompensation events related to  cirrhosis meet the definition of an 
adverse event and are captured accordingly.  The following are recognized decompensation events:  
 Ascites 
 Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) 
 Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) 
 Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) 
 Gastric or esophageal variceal bleeding 
Of these events, only the occurrence of variceal bleeding is an  endpoint of the study and is 
captured in a dedicated CRF module in addition to the AE module .  All other decompensation 
events will be captured in the A E module and monitored closely.    
 
10.3.3  Clinical Bleeding Events 
Immediately following a diagnosis  of a clinical bleed during th e treatment or f ollow-up periods, 
and, if possible, prior to any resulting medica l intervention, a whole blood sample is collected in a 
sodium citrate tube and the sample  is evaluated for platelet fu nction by [CONTACT_516933], as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].   
Any clinical presentation of a h emorrhagic event, including var iceal bleeding, procedural 
complications and hematomas, is reported as an AE and monitored  closely.  Depending on the 
clinical presentation and available test results, possible even t terms may include a clinical term 
(e.g., post-procedural b leeding) or a laboratory-based term (e. g., thrombocytopathy, 
thrombocytopenia, etc.) accordi ng to the Investigator’s assessm ent.   
As noted in 10.3.[ADDRESS_669990] or Study Discontinuatio n Due to Adverse Event 
In the event that three or more patients experience a grade 3 ( CTCAE) or above from one system 
organ class, regardless of the e vents’ relative attribution to study drug by [CONTACT_737], 
additional enrollment will be halted immediately and an unblind ed safety review of patient data 
will be initiated according to the study’s safety plan.  The ou tcome of this review will be 
documented and communicated to th e Investigators.  Potential ou tcome may include termination 
of the study, modification of t he protocol, or resuming of the protocol without modification.

recovered. 
For cases of chronic conditions, follow-up until “recovered” is  not required.  Aft er the subject has 
completed the trial, these cases  can be closed with the outcome  “recovering” or “not recovered”. 
All other non-serious adverse events must be followed until the  outcome of the event is 
“recovering” (for chronic conditions), “recovered” or until, fo r example, last subject 
contact/visit/end of post-treatment follow-up period, whichever  comes first, and until all queries 
related to the adverse ev ent have been resolved. 
Follow-up of Serious Adverse Events 
All adverse events classified as serious should  be followed unt il the outcome of the event is 
“recovered”, “recovered with sequelae”, “death” and until all q ueries have been resolved. For cases 
of chronic conditions and cancer, follow-up until “recovered”, “recovered with sequelae” or 
“death” is not required. After the subject has completed the tr ial, these cases can be closed with 
the outcome “recovering ” or “not recovered”.

16 SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
Protocol changes in Amendment 02, dated 20Jul2017, as compared to Amendment 01, dated 
28July2016 are as follows:  
 Changes are made throughout the protocol to differentiate betwe en HVPG (a single result 
calculated from the difference of a wedged pressure reading and  a free pressure reading) 
and mean HVPG (the average of three valid HVPG values).  
 The allowable difference in the values between the historical a nd the screening ALP in 
Inclusion Criteri on #2 is increased from 40 to 60 U/L.  
 The upper range for Inclusion C riterion #3 is increased from 16  mmHg to 18 mmHg. 
 Exclusion Criterion #[ADDRESS_670000] enic vein thrombosis. 
 Exclusion Criterion #11 is revis ed to clarify that subjects tak ing chronic suppressive 
therapy for Hepatitis B Virus can be enrolled as long as their infection is not active.    
 The value at which a low platelet count excludes a subject, per  Exclusion Criterion #12,

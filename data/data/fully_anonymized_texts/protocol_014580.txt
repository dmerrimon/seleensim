14/133Subjects receiving avelumab plus BSC who have experienced a complete response (CR) should 
continue to receive avelumab for at least 12 months after confirmation of response and/or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. In case a subject with a confirmed CR relapses after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_056], but prior to the end of the trial, [ADDRESS_193777] e xperienced any toxicity that led to treatment 
discontinuation of the initial avelumab therapy. Subjects who re-initiate treatment will stay on trial and will be treated and monitored according to the protocol and the “until progression” schedule in the Schedules of Assessments (see  Table 1) .
Subjects receiving physician’s choice chemotherapy plus BSC or BSC alone will receive trial treatment until progressive disease (PD) per RECIST v1.1, significant clinical deterioration (clinical progression), unacceptable toxicity, or if any criterion for withdrawal from the trial or trial treatment is fulfilled. Subjects receiving physician’s choice plus BSC will not be offeredto cross over to avelumab plus BSC.
Investigators must specify which of the physician’s choice treatment regimens will be selected 
prior to randomization.
Assessments will be made by [CONTACT_166840], but the 
disease response determinations, including PD assessments associated with the trial endpoints, will be supported by [CONTACT_166841].
Subjects will attend clinic visits at regular intervals to receive trial treatment and for efficacy 
and safety assessments.
The primary endpoint of the trial is OS, defined as the time (in months) from randomization to 
the date of death, regardless of the actual cause of the subject’s death.
Safety endpoints include adverse events (AEs) assessed throughout the trial and evaluated 
using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03, physical examination findings, clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs, and electrocardiograms (ECGs).
Planned number of subjects: Approximately 330 subjects are planned to be enrolled.
Primary endpoints: The primary endpoint of the trial is OS, defined as the time (in months) 
from randomization to the date of death, regardless of the actual cause of the subject’s death.
Secondary endpoints: The secondary endpoints include PFS according to RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_193778]-reported outcomes/QoL(assessed by [CONTACT_20367]-5D-5L, EORTC QLQ-C30, and EORTC module QLQ-STO22 questionnaires) and safety endpoints (including AEs, physical examination findings, clinicallaboratory assessments, vital signs, ECG parameters, and ECOG PS).
Exploratory endpoints: Exploratory endpoints include the following:
!Duration of response 
!Time to response 
!Tumor shrinkage in target lesions at each time point from Baseline

Trastuzumab in combination with first-line ther apy or second-line therapy listed above for 
human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 2 (HER2) – neu overexpressing adenocarcinoma is 
acceptable.
Key exclusion criteria
Prior therapy with any antibody or drug targeting T-cell coregulatory proteins, concurrent 
anticancer treatment, or immunosuppressive agents. Other exclusion criteria include severe hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal antibodies (Grade ≥ 3 NCI-CTCAE v4.03), brain 
metastases (except those treated locally, have not been progressing at least 2 months after completion of therapy, those with no steroid maintenance therapy required, and no ongoing neurological symptoms related to brain localization of the disease), any hi story of anaphylaxis, 
or uncontrolled asthma (that is, 3 or more features of partially controlled asthma) and persisting toxicity related to prior therapy of Grade ≥2 NCI-CTCAE v4.03 (except neuropathy and 
alopecia).
Investigational Medicinal Product: dose/mode of administration/dosing schedule: 
Avelumab will be administered as a 1-hour IV infusion at 10 mg/kg once every 2-week 
treatment cycle until PD or unacceptable toxicity. To mitigate infusion-related reactions, 
premedication with an antihistamine and with paracetamol (acetaminophen) approximately [ADDRESS_193779] 4 doses of avelumab is mandatory (for example, 25 to 50 mg diphenhydramine and 500 to 650 mg paracetamol [acetaminophen] IV or oral equivalent). Premedication should be administered for subsequent avelumab doses based upon clinical judgment and presence/severity of prior infusion reactions. This regimen may be modified based on local treatment standards and guidelines as appropriate provided it does not include systemic corticosteroids.
Reference therapy: dose/mode of administration/dosing schedule: Subjects will receive 
BSC plus physician’s choice chemotherapy selected from one of the following options:
!Paclitaxel as monotherapy (80 mg/m2on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 4-week treatment cycle). 
Subjects should be premedicated with 20 mg  dexamethasone orally approximately 12 and 
6 hours prior to injection, 50 mg diphenhydramine (or equivalent) IV 30 to 60 minutes prior 
to injection, and 300 mg cimetidine or 50 mg ranitidine IV 30 to 60 minutes prior to injection. The premedication regimen may be modified based on local treatment standards and guidelines as appropriate.
!Irinotecan as monotherapy (150 mg/m
2on Days 1 and 15 of a 4-week treatment cycle). 
Subjects should be premedicated with anti-emetics, such as [ADDRESS_193780] cholinergic symptoms, premedicate with 0.2 to 0.3 mg atropi[INVESTIGATOR_166819]. The premedication regimen may be modified based on local treatment standards and guidelines as appropriate.
!Subjects who are not deemed eligible to receive paclitaxel or irinotecan at the dose and 
schedule specified above will receive BSC once every [ADDRESS_193781]-line Gastric Cancer
EMR 100070-008
17/133The Investigator will determine what systemic therapy will be administered to the subjects.
In the absence of unequivocal data on the doses and schedules of drugs that should be used as 
a third-line treatment of gastric cancer, the doses and schedules will be determined by [CONTACT_166842].
Treatment will be administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Physician’s choice plus BSC will be stopped after the first on-treatment radiological evaluation 
of disease progression.
Planned trial and treatment duration per subject: Treatment with avelumab plus BSC will 
continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. For subjects receiving avelumab plus BSC, treatment may continue past the initial determination of disease progression according to RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_193782]’s ECOG PS has remained stable, and if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], the subject will benefit from continued treatment (see criteria above). Additionally, subjects receiving avelumab plus BSC who have experienced a CR should continue to receive avelumab for a minimum of 12 months after confirmation of response and/or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Physician’s choice plus BSC will be administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Statistical methods: The sample size of this trial is driven by [CONTACT_53229] (OS); therefore, the trial is event driven and the primary analysis will take place after [ADDRESS_193783] occurred to ensure sufficient follow-up for all subjects for the primary analysis of OS. With 256 OS events, the trial provides 90% power to demonstrate an improvement of 2 months median OS time (i.e., median OS time of 6 months in the avelumab plus BSC arm versus 4 months in the control arm, which is equivalent to a reduction of 33% in hazard rate, i.e., hazard ratio of avelumab versus control = 0.67, at the 1-sided 2.5% overall significance level). Assuming a randomization ratio of 1:1 (avelumab plus BSC versus physician’s choice plus BSC), an exponential distribution of OS time, a uniform distribution of subject accrual period over 15 months, an additional 6 months’ minimum follow-up period for all subjects, and an expected 5% overall drop-out rate, the trial should enroll approximately 330 subjects (n=165 subjects/arm) to achieve [ADDRESS_193784]. The 
primary analysis set will be the Intention-to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set. The type I error rate for the primary endpoint (OS) and 2 key secondary endpoints (PFS and BOR) will be controlled at 2.5% (1-sided) level using a gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_124502]. The primary hypothesis (OS) will serve as a gate keeper and be tested at an overall 1-si ded type I error of 2.5%. Only  if it is significant, 
the 2 key secondary endpoints (PFS and BOR) will be tested, and the Hochberg procedure will be used to control the type I error rate at 2.5% (1-sided) for PFS and BOR. The stratification factor used for the stratified statistical analysis in the analysis of the primary and key secondary endpoints will be region (Asia versus non-Asia).

36/[ADDRESS_193846] leading cause of cancer 
death. In 2012, there were approximately 950,000 new cases and 723,000 deaths worldwide (2). 
Of these cancers, approximately 90% to 95% were adenocarcinomas with the remaining 5% to 10% comprising neuroendocrine tumors, lymphomas, squamous cell cancer, and sarcomas.
The incidence of gastric cancer varies widely by [CONTACT_1606], with no true global standard treatment 
established. Higher incidence rates are observed in Asia, Costa Rica, Peru, and Eastern Europe, while Western Europe and the [LOCATION_003] have lower incidence rates (3).
The use of chemotherapy to treat gastric cancer has no firmly established standard of care. Some 
drugs used in gastric cancer treatment include the following, sometimes using drugs in various combinations: fluorouracil and other fluoropyrimidines (capecitabine, S1), doxorubicin, cisplatin, oxaliplatin, taxanes, irinotecan, and others. Currently, combinations of fluoropyrimidine and platinum with or without doxorubicin or docetaxel  are the most commonly used as first-line 
treatment. For patients with human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 2 (HER2)-positive gastric cancer, trastuzumab plus chemotherapy is the standard of care (4). Recently, the benefit of 
second-line chemotherapy has been demonstrated by [CONTACT_166850]; however, there is no standard treatment for patients after they have progressed on second-line therapy (5-24) . 
Improvement in overall survival (OS) has been demonstrated for 4 drugs (paclitaxel, ramucirumabwith or without paclitaxel, docetaxel, and irinotecan) in the context of a randomized controlled trial in subjects with metastatic gastric cancer who have progressed after 1 line of a platinum-based doublet.
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_166821], advanced, unresectable, and/or metastatic gastric cancer remains a 
significant unmet medical need. In addition, there is currently no recommended therapeutic approach for patients who progress after 2 lines of therapy for the treatment of recurrent, locally advanced, or metastatic gastric cancer.
3.2 Programmed Death Receptor and Ligands
The programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor and PD-1 ligands 1 and 2 (PD-L1, PD-L2) play integral roles in immune regulation. Expressed on activated T cells, PD-1 is activated by [CONTACT_4002]-L1 and PD-L2 expressed by [CONTACT_166851], tumor cells, or both, initiating T-cell death and localized immune suppression (25-28) , potentially providing an immune-tolerant environment for tumor 
development and growth. Conversely, inhibition of this interaction can enhance local T-cell responses and mediate antitumor activity in nonclinical animal models (26, 29) .
In the clinical setting, treatment with antibodies that block the PD-1 – anti-PD-L1 interaction have 
been reported to produce objective response rates (O RRs) of 7% to 38% in subjects with advanced 
or metastatic solid tumors, with tolerable safety profiles (30-32) . Notably, responses appeared 
prolonged, with durations of [ADDRESS_193847]-line Gastric Cancer

37/133documented the activity of anti-PD-L1 antibodies in subjects with advanced gastric cancer (33, 
34).
3.[ADDRESS_193848] (IMP) for the present trial is avelumab (anti-PD-L1 
monoclonal antibody MSB0010718C). Avelumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 isotype. 
Avelumab selectively binds to PD-L1 and blocks the interaction between PD-L1 and its receptors 
PD-[ADDRESS_193849] fewer side effects, including a lower risk of autoimmune-related safety issues, as blockade of PD-L1 leaves the PD-L2/PD-[ADDRESS_193850] to promote peripheral self-tolerance (35). For complete details of the in vitro and nonclinical trials, 
please refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB).
In light of the recent data demonstrating the clinical efficacy of an anti-PD-L1 antibody in 
advanced gastric cancer, and given the clinical im portance of PD-L1 expression in gastric cancer 
tumor cells (36) and the mode of action of avelumab, avelumab is being developed as a potential 
therapy for patients with various advanced solid tumors, including gastric cancer. This anti-PD-L1 therapeutic antibody concept is intended to be developed in oncological settings by [CONTACT_28794], Darmstadt, [LOCATION_013], and by [CONTACT_166852], EMD Serono R&D.
The ongoing clinical trials for avelumab are described in the IB. Of the Phase I studies, [ADDRESS_193851] cohorts of subjects with advanced gastric cancer:
!Trial EMR 100070-001 is “a Phase I, open-label, multiple-ascending dose trial to investigate 
the safety, tolerability, PK, biological, and clinical activity of avelumab in subjects with 
metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors.”
!Trial EMR 100070-002 is “a Phase I trial to investigate the tolerability, safety, PK, biological, 
and clinical activity of avelumab in Japanese subjects with metastatic or locally advanced solid 
tumors, with expansion part in Asian subjects with gastric cancer.”
In addition to the trial described in this protocol, EMR 100070-008, another Phase III study in subjects with advanced gastric cancer (EMR 100070-007) is ongoing for 1L switch maintenance treatment.
3.3.1 Safety
Available safety and efficacy data for the avelumab program are discussed in the IB and establish a positive benefit risk for conducting Phase III stud ies with 10 mg/kg (the dosing used in this trial). 
The safety profile of avelumab has been evaluated based on data of more than 1750 subjects, including all subjects treated with 10 mg/kg from studies EMR100070-001 (1650 subjects) and EMR100070-003 Part A (88 subjects) as pooled safety dataset with a data cutoff of [ADDRESS_193852]-line Gastric Cancer

38/133the compound. Most of the observed events were either  in line with those expected in subjects with 
advanced solid tumors or with similar class effects of monoclonal antibody blocking the 
PD-1/PD-L1 axis. Infusion-related reactions including drug hypersensitivity reactions and 
immune-mediated adverse reactions (immune-related pneumonitis, immune-related colitis, immune-related hepatitis, immune-related endocrinopathies [thyroid disorders, adrenal insufficiency, new onset type I diabetes mellitus, pi[INVESTIGATOR_74276]], immune-related nephritis and renal dysfunction and other immune-related AEs [myositis, myocarditis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, uveitis]) have been identified as important risks for avelumab (please see the currentIB for details). Detailed guidelines for the management of immune-related adverse events and infusion-related reactions have been implemented in the study protocols, including this one (please see Sections 3.5, 5.1.2, 5.1.3, 6.2.1, 6.4.2, 6.5.4, 6.5.5 and 6.12) .
3.3.[ADDRESS_193853] been performed in ongoing Trials EMR 100070-001 and EMR 100070-002. The preliminary results based on the data available as of 19 December 2014 are presented under the individual trial headings.
[IP_ADDRESS] Trial EMR 100070-[ADDRESS_193854] non-c ompartmental analysis based on rich serum 
concentration-time data obtained over a complete dosing interval of 2 weeks (= tau). The analysis of these data revealed that the exposure parameters maximum concentration observed postdose (C
max) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC tau) increased with the doses in a linear 
fashion.
The mean (standard deviation [SD]) apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2) was 69 ± 21 hours for 
1 mg/kg, 84 ± 22 hours for the 3 mg/kg, 106 ± 29 hours for 10 mg/kg, and 134 ± 74 hours for the 
20 mg/kg dose. Taking into account the variability, the t 1/2of the 10 and 20 mg/kg doses can be 
regarded as similar, indicating that target mediated elimination does not increase at these doses. This implies that target occupancy is likely to be high at these 2 doses throughout the dosing interval. 
Minimum trough concentrations (C
min) were obtained for the majority of subjects enrolled in the 
trial. The median C minat the end of the first cycle after administration of the 10 mg/kg dose was 
20 μg/mL (n=256). This median C minincreased during the subsequent cycles to 24 μg/mL (second 
cycle; n=233), 26 μg/mL (third cycle; n=167), and remained between 24 and 37 μg/mL during the 
subsequent cycles (n=22 to 114) indicative for no significant accumulation with the biweekly 
dosing scheme. Median C minafter the 3 mg/kg dose were 3.7 μg/mL after the first dose, 3.9 μg/mL 
after the second dose and 8.3 μg/mL after the third dose (n=7 to 12), though some trough values 
below 1 μg/mL were observed, as well as antidrug antibodies in at least [ADDRESS_193855] in this dose group on Day 85 of the treatment period, accompanied by [CONTACT_166853]. Median trough concentrations after the 20 mg/kg dose were 44, 70, and 77 μg/mL after the first, second, and third 
dose, respectively (n=14 to 19).

clearance was low (0.38 ± 0.11 mL/h/kg).
[IP_ADDRESS] Trial EMR 100070-002
A preliminary analysis of the PK data was performed based on the serum concentration of avelumab obtained from 5 Japanese subjects treated with 3 mg/kg, 6 Japanese subjects treated with 10 mg/kg, and 6 Japanese subjects treated with 20 mg/kg as a 1-hour intravenously (IV) infusion once every [ADDRESS_193856] infusion, serum C
max(geometric mean) of 64 μg/mL (range: 50 to 78 μg/mL) 
for the 3 mg/kg, 179 μ g/mL (range: 148 to 228 μg/mL) for the 10 mg/kg, and 459 μg/mL (range: 
374 to 533 μg/mL) for the 20 mg/kg were observed at a median time to reach maximum 
concentration of 1.5, 1.3, and 1.8 hours after infusion start (ranging between 1 and 5 hours). The 
average AUC tau(geometric mean) over the first dosing interval was 5437 μg/mL∙h (range: between 
3826 and 7246 μ g/mL∙h) for the 3 mg/kg dose, [ZIP_CODE] μg/mL∙h (range: [ZIP_CODE] to [ZIP_CODE] μg/mL∙h) 
for the 10 mg/kg dose, and [ZIP_CODE] μ g/mL∙h (range: [ZIP_CODE] to [ZIP_CODE] μ g/mL∙h) for the 20 mg/kg. 
Variability in exposure parameters (C maxand AUC tau) was in general low as indicated by [CONTACT_166854] 22% and 27% for the 3 mg/kg dose, 20% and 40% for the 10 mg/kg dose, and 14% and 22% for the 20 mg/kg dose. In regards to C
maxand C min, inter-individual 
variability was generally higher than intra-individual variability. The apparent t 1/2was 89 hours 
(range: 52 to 118 hours) for 3 mg/kg, 122 hours (range: 68 to 152 hours) for 10 mg/kg, and 114 hours (range: 92 to 133 hours) for 20 mg/kg. The mean estimated volume of distribution was in the range of 61 to 73 mL/kg, the mean total systemic clearance ranged between 0.37 and 0.51 mL/h/kg.
Mean C
minobtained immediately before next infusion and mean C maxobtained immediately after 
infusion end (at Days 15, 29, 43, and 85) remained at fairly constant levels, indicating no 
accumulation following multiple infusions. This is in line with the calculated apparent t 1/2and the 
applied dosing scheme (once every 2 weeks). 
Exposure values C maxand AUC increased almost proportional with dose.
Although a formal analysis has not been conducted, it is apparent that the preliminary 
concentrations obtained over time and the clearance during the first dosing interval were similar in Japanese and Caucasian subjects.

40/[ZIP_CODE]% receptor occupancy was observed at a drug concentration (SD) of 0.122 μg/mL ± 
0.042μg/mL, and a plateau indicating at least 95% receptor occupancy was reached in all donor 
blood samples at 1 μg/mL.
These in vitro data combined with PK data were confirmed in ex vivo samples taken at C minafter 
the first dose (Day 15) in a small number of s ubjects during the initial dose-escalation part of the 
Phase Ib Trial EMR 100070-001 (n=9). For doses of 10 mg/kg, target occupancy was greater than 
90% for these 4 subjects, at C minlevels ranging between 12.69 to 26.87 μg/mL. Also, for doses of 
3 mg/kg, available target occupancy data for 2 subjects with trough levels ranging from 4.56 to 6.99 μg/mL, showed greater than 90% target occupancy at trough exposure levels. At dose level 
1 mg/kg, 2 out of 3 subjects displayed less than 90% target occupancy at trough serum concentrations. Avelumab serum concentrations were below the quantification limit of 0.2 μg/mL 
in these 2 subjects.
Based on the observed avelumab serum concentrations in the EMR 100070-001 Phase I clinical 
trial and the in vitro receptor occupancy data, trough concentrations were sufficient to achieve full target occupancy throughout the entire dosing interval in all of the subjects receiving the 10 mg/kg dose. After the 3 mg/kg dose, C
minwas insufficient in 3 of the 13 subjects to assure full target 
occupancy; therefore, in order to achieve targ et saturation during the whole treatment period in all 
subjects, the dose of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks was selected as the dose for further investigation in the Phase Ib expansion cohorts and for the subsequent clinical trials.
3.4 Rationale for the Current Clinical Trial
The safety and clinical efficacy of avelumab ha ve been determined in multiple tumor types 
(non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, mesothelioma, melanoma, thymoma, and adrenocorticocarcinoma) (37, 38). The rationale to enroll subjects with unresectable, recurrent, 
locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastro-esophageal junction is supported by [CONTACT_166855]-1/PD-L1 agents and from 2 expansion cohorts in 2 avelumab Phase I studies.

EMR 100070-001 (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS])  and Trial EMR 100070-002 (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) .
Efficacy results observed in these trials are below:
!Trial EMR 100070-001: As of the data cutoff of 23 October 2015, in the primary cohort of 
151 subjects with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, the ORR in second-line subjects was 9.7% (6/62 subjects; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6 to 19.9; all 6 subjects had partial response [PR], and 3 wereongoing at cutoff). In switch-maintenance subjects, ORR was 9.0% (8/89 subjects; 95% CI, 4.0 to 16.9; 2 subjects had complete res ponse [CR], and 6 had PR; 4 subjects were 
ongoing at cutoff). Stable disease was observed in 12 additional second-line subjects (19.4%) and 43 additional switch-maintenance subjects (48.3%). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.0 weeks and PFS rate at 24 weeks was 8.8% in second-line subjects. In the switch-maintenance subjects, the median PFS was 12.0 weeks and PFS rate at 24 weeks was 25.7%.
!Trial EMR 100070-002: As of the data cutoff of 11 March 2015, Japanese subjects with recurrent or refractory gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma had ORR 15% 
(3/20 subjects, 95% CI, 3.2 to 37.9), with 3 subjects having a PR. Ten subjects (50%) had 
stable disease, median PFS was 11.9 weeks, and PFS rate at 12 weeks was 43.3%.
Overall, the data generated in subjects with gastric cancer suggest that the administration of avelumab is well tolerated and clinically active.
The response rate and the duration of response observed compare favorably with those reported 
with chemotherapy in the second-line gastric cancer setting.
3.[ADDRESS_193858] of the trial is considered justifiable using the dose and dose regimen of the avelumab as specified in this clinical trial protocol. For details regarding the dose selection rationale, refer to the IB. An IDMC (see Section 2.3.1) will assess the risk-benefit ratio on an ongoing basis. The trial will be discontinued 
in the event of any new findings that indicate a relevant deterioration of the risk benefit relationship that would render continuation of the trial unjustifiable.
The primary known identified risks of exposure to avelumab include: 
!Infusion-related reactions 
!Immune-related adverse events (irAEs).

42/133measures for infusion-related reactions/hypersensitivity have been extended. Premedication with 
an antihistamine and with paracetamol (acetaminophen) approximately [ADDRESS_193860] 4 doses of avelumab is mandatory (for example, 25 to 50 mg diphenhydramine and 500 to 650 mg paracetamol [acetaminophen] IV or oral equivalent). Premedication should be administered for subsequent avelumab doses based upon clinical judgment and presence/severity of prior infusion reactions. This regimen may be modified based on local treatment standards and guidelines as appropriate provided it does not include systemic corticosteroids. 
In addition, since avelumab can induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, there is a 
potential risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS, see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) . 
As noted in Section 3.2,  trials with antibodies that block the PD-1 – PD-L1 interaction have been 
reported to produce ORRs of 7% to 38% in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors (30-32) , with response durations of 1 year or more for the majority of subjects. More specifically, 
avelumab has a reported ORR in the range of 10% to 15% for second-line (Trial EMR 100070-001) and third- or fourth-line gastric cancer subjects (Trial EMR 100070-001). While that response rate is similar to that reported by [CONTACT_43265] (39), it 
is expected that the responses with avelumab will be long lasting. In addition, the ORR does not recapi[INVESTIGATOR_166826], as previously demonstrated for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45762], for which dramatic improvement of OS and PFS was observed, with ORR usually less than 20%. In the absence of any established therapy for third-line gastric cancer, 
which has a very poor prognosis (median OS less than 5 months), the administration of avelumab represents an option that carries a favorable risk/benefit.
This clinical trial will be conducted in compliance with the clinical trial protocol, ICH GCP, and 
the applicable national regulatory requirements.

44/133are authorized and marketed. Investigators must specify which of the physician’s choice treatment 
regimens will be selected prior to randomization. Before making a decision and starting administration of chemotherapy, the Investigator is required to refer to what is stated in the respective current product information (local label, Summary of Product Characteristics [SmPC]), particularly in regard to contraindications, warnings and precautions for use, dosage adjustments in the event of toxicity, subject monitoring provisions, the duration of the need for contraception, and medicinal products that are prohibited or that must be used with caution. In case of a potential contradiction between the specifications outlined in this clinical trial protocol and the information contained in the product information (local label, SmPC) of irinotecan or paclitaxel, respectively, the local label always prevails. Investigators should check updated labeling information via relevant websites before randomization and before chemotherapy administration.
5.1.1 Overall Design
Approximately 330 subjects will be ra ndomized, stratified by [CONTACT_11338], in a 1:1 ratio to receive BSC 
with either avelumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg as a 1-hour IV infusion once every 2 weeks or physician’s choice chemotherapy from the following (Table 4) : 
!Paclitaxel as monotherapy (80 mg/m
2on Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 4-week treatment cycle). 
Subjects should be premedicated with 20 mg dexamethasone orally approximately 12 and 6 hours prior to injection, 50 mg diphenhydramine (or equivalent) IV 30 to 60 minutes prior to injection, and 300 mg cimetidine or 50 mg ranitidine IV  30 to 60 minutes prior to injection. The 
premedication regimen may be modified based on local treatment standards and guidelines as appropriate.
!Irinotecan as monotherapy (150 mg/m
2on Days 1 and 15 of a 4-week treatment cycle). Subjects 
should be premedicated with anti-emetics, such as [ADDRESS_193862] cholinergic symptoms, premedicate with 0.2 to 0.3 mg atropi[INVESTIGATOR_166819]. The premedication regimen may be modified based on local treatment standards and guidelines as appropriate.
!Subjects who are not deemed eligible to receive paclitaxel or irinotecan at the dose and schedule 
specified above will receive BSC once every 3 weeks.
Subjects will return to the clinic at regular intervals for assessments. Tumor measurements by 
[CONTACT_20420] (CT) scan or magnetic re sonance imaging (MRI) will be performed every 
[ADDRESS_193863]/MRI data. Response will be evaluated using RECIST v1.1 and as adjudicated by a blinded IRC. Treatment will continue until:
!Disease progression (see Section  5.5.1)
!Significant clinical deterioration (clinical progression, see Section  5.5.1)
!Unacceptable toxicity, or
!Any criterion for withdrawal from the trial or trial treatment is fulfilled (see Section  5.5).
For subjects receiving avelumab plus BSC, treatment may continue past the initial determination 
of disease progression per RECIST v1.1 as long the following criteria are met:

Avelumab Avelumab in Third-line Gastric Cancer
EMR 100070-008
45/133!No new symptoms or worsening of previous symptoms
!Tolerance of trial treatment
!Stable Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS)
!Treatment beyond progression will not delay an imminent intervention to prevent serious 
complications of disease progression (for example, central nervous system metastases).
Subjects receiving avelumab plus BSC who have experienced a CR should continue to receive avelumab for a minimum of 12 months after confirmation of response and/or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. In case a subject with a confirmed CR relapses after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_056], but prior to the end of the trial, [ADDRESS_193864] experienced any toxicity that led to treatment discontinuation of the initial avelumab therapy. Subjects who re-initiate treatmen t will stay on trial and will be treated and 
monitored according to the protocol and the “until progression” schedule in the Schedules of Assessments (see Table 1) . Subjects who re-initiate treatment will not have to undergo a second 
Screening visit.
Investigators must specify which of the physician’s choice treatment regimens will be selected 
prior to randomization.
Subjects receiving physician’s choice plus BS C will receive trial treatment until PD per RECIST 
v1.1, significant clinical deterioration (clinical progression), unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of 
consent, or if any criterion for withdrawal from the trial or trial treatment is fulfilled. Subjects 
receiving physician’s choice plus BSC will not be offered to cross over to avelumab plus BSC.
Assessments will be made by [CONTACT_166856], but the 
disease response endpoint determinations, including PD assessments associated with the trial endpoints, will be supported by [CONTACT_166841] (see Sections  2.3.2 and 
7.3).
Subjects will attend clinic visits at regular intervals to receive trial treatment and for efficacy and safety assessments (see Section  7.1.2) .
The primary endpoint of the trial is OS, defined as the time (in months) from randomization to the date of death, regardless of the actual cause of the subject’s death.
Safety endpoints include AEs assessed throughout the trial and evaluated using the National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03, physical examination findings, clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs, and electrocardiograms(ECGs).

5.1.2 Trial Treatment Administration and Schedule
The trial Schedules of Assessments are presented in  Table 1.
[IP_ADDRESS] Avelumab
Subjects randomized to the avelumab plus BSC arm will receive IV infusion of avelumab 
(10 mg/kg over 1 hour) once every 2 weeks. To  mitigate infusion-related reactions, premedication 
with an antihistamine and with paracetamol (acetaminophen) approximately [ADDRESS_193865] 4 doses of avelumab is mandatory (for example, 25 to 50 mg diphenhydramine and 500 to 650 mg paracetamol [acetaminophen] IV or oral equivalent). Premedication should be administered for subsequent avelumab doses based upon clinical judgment and presence/severity of prior infusion reactions. This regimen may be modified based on local treatment standards and guidelines as appropriate provided it does not include systemic corticosteroids.
The formulation and packaging information of avelumab is provided in Sections 6.1.1 and 6.6, 
respectively.
[IP_ADDRESS] Physician’s Choice Chemotherapy
Subjects randomized to the physician’s choice arm will receive BSC plus physician’s choice
chemotherapy (paclitaxel or irinotecan monotherapy) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or any of the criteria for withdrawal from trial treatment is fulfilled (Section  5.5). Dosing 
and regimen of the physician’s choice chemother apy (paclitaxel or irinotecan monotherapy) is 
summarized in Section  6.2.2.
Additionally, in order to reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention as well as the severity of hypersensitivity reactions, subjects will be administered pre-treatment prior to each therapy
infusion per local institutional practice.

47/1335.1.2.[ADDRESS_193866] Supportive Care
All subjects in both arms will receive BSC as background therapy. Subjects who are not deemed 
eligible to receive paclitaxel or irinotecan will receive BSC alone with no active therapy once every 3 weeks.
There is no universal definition of BSC that can be applied across institutions, countries, or regions 
(40). Best supportive care is defined as “treatment administered with the intent to maximize QoL 
without a specific antineoplastic regimen, which include antibiotics, analgesics, antiemetics, thoracentesis, paracentesis, blood transfusions, nutritional support (including jejunostomy), and focal external-beam radiation for control of pain, cough, dyspnea, or bleeding” (41). Best 
supportive care will be administered per institutional guidelines. Best supportive care can be administered without any additional therapy.
5.1.3 Dose Modification and Adverse Drug Reactions Requiring 
Treatment Discontinuation
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Modification for Avelumab
The dose of avelumab will be calculated based on the weight of the subject determined within 
[ADDRESS_193867]’s weight is 10% or less than the weight used for the last dose calculation.
Each subject will stay on the avelumab assigned dose of 10 mg/kg unless treatment needs to be 
stopped. Dosing modifications (changes in infusion rate) and dose delays are described in Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS]. There will be no dose reductions.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Drug Reactions Requiring Avelumab 
Discontinuation or Modifications
The following adverse drug reactions (ADRs, see Section [IP_ADDRESS])  require permanent treatment 
discontinuation of avelumab:
!Any Grade [ADDRESS_193868] any clinical correlate, and resolve within 7 days with adequate medical management
!Any Grade 3 ADRs require treatment discontinu ation with avelumab except for any of the 
following: 
!Transient ( ≤ 6 hours) Grade 3 flu-like symptoms or fever, which are controlled with medical 
management
!Transient ( ≤ 24 hours) Grade 3 fatigue, local reactions, headache, nausea, or emesis that 
resolve to Grade ≤ [ADDRESS_193869]-line Gastric Cancer
EMR 100070-008
48/133!Single laboratory values out of normal range (excluding Grade ≥  [ADDRESS_193870] 
increase) that are unlikely related to trial trea tment according to the Investigator, do not have 
any clinical correlate, and resolve to Grade ≤ 1 within 7 days with adequate medical 
management
!Tumor flare phenomenon defined as local pain, irritation, or rash localized at sites of known 
or suspected tumor
!Change in ECOG PS to ≥ 3 that resolves to ≤ 2 within 14 days (infusions should not be given 
on the following cycle, if the ECOG PS is ≥ 3 on the day of trial treatment administration)
!Asymptomatic Grade ≥3 drug-related amylase or lipase abnormality that is not associated 
with symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis does not require dose delay or 
discontinuation. The study Medical Monitor should be consulted for such abnormalities.
!Infusion should not be given in case of ongoing Grade [ADDRESS_193871] has resolved to 
Grade≤1. Up to 2 subsequent trial treatment doses may be omitted to allow for recovery to 
Grade≤1. If more than 2 doses are skipped, treatment may be resumed after consultation with 
the trial Medical Monitor.
Infusion-related reactions, hypersensitivity reactions and flu-like symptoms (Grades 1 to 4), TLS, 
and irAEs should be handled according to guidelines in Sections [IP_ADDRESS],  [IP_ADDRESS], [IP_ADDRESS], and 
[IP_ADDRESS],  respectively.
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Modification for Physician’s Choice Chemotherapy
The starting dose of physician’s choice chemotherapy will be determined per local institutional guidelines in the absence of established doses and schedules for these agents when administered in the context of the management of third-line ga stric cancer. Suggested dosing is summarized in 
Section  6.2.2.
Dose modification (dose delays and dose changes) for physician’s choice chemotherapy should be performed according to local institutional guidelines.
5.2 Discussion of Trial Design
This is a Phase III, 2-arm, randomized, open-label trial to determine the efficacy and safety of 
avelumab plus BSC compared with physician’s choice of third-line therapy as monotherapy(paclitaxel or irinotecan) plus BSC, or BSC alone in subjects with unresectable, recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or of the gastroesophageal junction who have failed or relapsed from [ADDRESS_193872] of any of the following:

51/1335.2.3 Rationale for Physician’s Choice Chemotherapy in the 
Third-Line Setting
There is no standard of care for the treatment of patients with advanced gastric cancer who have 
progressed after [ADDRESS_193877] been considered appropriate; however, there is 
literature supporting the use of chemotherapy in a third-line advanced gastric cancer trial (39). In 
particular, data from a cohort of Korean subjects with advanced gastric cancer who were treated with single-agent docetaxel after progression on m-FOLFOX-[ADDRESS_193878] line setting is feasible. Therefore, administration of chemotherapy is considered a reasonable option for these patients.
The data from this study are summarized below:Lee et al. analyzed [ADDRESS_193879] ologically diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the 
stomach and who had progressed after m-FOLFOX-4 and m-FOLFIRI regimens (39). Subjects 
were treated with docetaxel (75 mg/m
2) on Day 1 every 3 weeks. All subjects were evaluated in 
terms of tumor response: 5 (15%), 9 (27%), and 19 (58%) subjects experienced PR, stable disease, 
and PD, respectively. The median time to progression was 2.1 months (95% CI, 1.63 to 2.58 months), and OS was 4.7 months (95% CI, 3.20 to 6.20 months) from the start of the docetaxel regimen. Assessing the subjects’ toxicity prof iles, the median number of cycles was 2.0 (range, 
1.0 to 12.0 cycles). The major hematologic toxicities included Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (19/33, 58%), Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia (2/33, 6%), and Grade 3 or 4 anemia (5/33, 15%). Neutropenic fever developed in 3 subjects (9%). The nonhematological toxicities were nausea and vomiting (10/33, 30%), abdominal pain (4/33, 12%), skin rash (1/33, 3%), and fluid retention (3/33, 9%). Overall, the conclusion was that docetaxel is a feasible third-line therapy regimen for subjects with advanced gastric cancer after m-FOLFIRI and m-FOLFOX-[ADDRESS_193880] progressed 
after 2 lines of chemotherapy agents. In clinical practice, many patients with gastric cancer develop peritoneal carcinomatosis during the course of their disease, which usually leads to a rapid symptomatic deterioration and chemotherapy intolerance (44). Although data from COUGAR-[ADDRESS_193881]-line patients. 
Based on this, BSC alone or BSC plus physician’s choice of active chemotherapy is considered an appropriate comparator for the proposed target population.

52/133Subjects randomized to the physician’s choice plus  BSC will receive physician’s choice treatment 
selected from one of the following options:
!Paclitaxel as monotherapy (80 mg/m2on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 4-week treatment cycle)
!Irinotecan as monotherapy (150 mg/m2on Days 1 and 15 of a 4-week treatment cycle)
!Subjects who are not deemed eligible to receive paclitaxel or irinotecan at the dose and schedule 
specified above will receive BSC once every 3 weeks.
Dose and regimen of both paclitaxel and irinotecan monotherapy are consistent with recommended 
regiments in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for gastric cancer and based on published Phase III data from the WJOG 4007 trial in advanced gastric cancer (46).
5.2.[ADDRESS_193882] for avelumab plus BSC when compared with physician’s choice
plus BSC is based on the following considerations:
!The response rate of approximately 15% reported to date in the second-line population of the 
[ADDRESS_193883]-line setting
!Rapid onset of responses has been reported with avelumab, as well as with the other anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], suggesting that treatment with avelumab will be effective despi[INVESTIGATOR_166828].
5.2.6 Rationale for Stratification by [CONTACT_166857] (Asia versus non Asia) has been retained as a stratification factor because it is well established that gastric cancer physiopathology and clinical management differ significantly in Asian countries compared to non-Asian countries (50).
Differences in clinical outcomes between Asian and non-Asian subjects have been reported in the Phase III studies performed with ramucirumab, trastuzumab, and bevacizumab (47, 51, 52) .

If progression at the second imaging scan is not confirmed and the subject wishes to continue, the subject will be allowed to continue receiving avelumab as long as they meet the criteria for continuation of treatment beyond progression.
If the Investigator feels that the subject continues to achieve clinical benefit by [CONTACT_166862], the subject should remain on the trial and continue to receive monitoring according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1) .
Any additional continuation of avelumab plus BSC beyond further progression must be discussed and agreed upon with the medical monitor. Further disease progression is defined as an additional 10% increase in tumor burden volume from time of initial PD. This includes an increase in the sum of all target lesions and/or the development of new measurable lesions.
New lesions are considered measurable at the time of initial progression if the longest diameter is 
at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes, which must have a short axis of at least 15 mm). Any new lesion considered nonmeasurable at the time of initial progression may become measurable and therefore included in the tumor burden volume if the longest diameter increases to at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes, which must have a short axis of at least 15 mm).
Additionally, subjects receiving avelumab plus BSC who have experienced a CR should continue 
to receive avelumab for a minimum of 12 months after confirmation of response and/or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

[IP_ADDRESS] Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions and Flu-like Symptoms
If hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the subject must be treated according to the best available medical practice. A complete guideline for the emergency treatment of anaphylactic reactions according to the Working Group of the Resuscitati on Council ([LOCATION_008]) can be found at 
https://www.resus.org.uk/pages/reaction.pdf (53). Subjects should be instructed to report any 
delayed reactions to the Investigator immediately.
Symptoms include impaired airway, decreased oxygen saturation (< 92%), confusion, lethargy, 
hypotension, pale or clammy skin, and cyanosis. These symptoms can be managed with epi[INVESTIGATOR_166832]. Subjects should be placed on monitor immediately, and the intensive care unit should be alerted for possible transfer if required.

An overdose is defined as any dose ≥ 5% over the calculated dose for that particular administration 
as described in this clinical trial protocol. Any overdose must be recorded in the trial treatment
section of the eCRF.
For monitoring purposes, any case of overdose, whether or not associated with an AE (serious or 
nonserious), must be reported to the Sponsor’s Global Drug Safety department in an expedited manner using the appropriate reporting form (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) .
There are no known symptoms of avelumab overdose to date. The Investigator should use his or her clinical judgment when treating an overdose of the trial treatment.
In the case of an overdose of paclitaxel, subjects should receive therapeutic granulocyte 
colony-stimulating factor according to local institutional guidelines as soon as possible. For all physician’s choice chemotherapy, Investigators must follow local institutional guidelines for overdose treatment.

7.1.2 Treatment Period
In this trial, the treatment will be given until disease progression, significant clinical deterioration (clinical progression), unacceptable toxicity, or any criterion for withdrawal from the trial or trial treatment is fulfilled (see Section  5.5.1) . For subjects receiving avelumab plus BSC, treatment may 
continue past the initial determination of disease progression according to RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_193923]’s ECOG PS has remained stable, and if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], the subject will benefit from continued treatment (see Section 6.2.1) . Additionally, subjects receiving avelumab
plus BSC who have experienced a CR should continue to receive avelumab for a minimum of 12 months after confirmation of response and/or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.In case a subject with a confirmed CR relapses after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_056], but prior to the end of the trial, [ADDRESS_193924] experienced 
any toxicity that led to treatment discontinuation of the initial avelumab therapy. Subjects who re-initiate treatment will stay on trial and will be treated and monitored according to the protocol and the “until progression” schedule in the Schedules of Assessments (see  Table 1) .
Subjects should start treatment administration within 28 days after signing the ICF. Treatment administration will start within 4 days after the randomization call. While on trial treatment, subjects will be asked to visit the trial site at the following schedules according to the Schedule ofAssessments: 
!Once every 2 weeks until disease progression for subjects randomized to receive avelumab plus 
BSC
!Once every week for the first 3 weeks of each 4-week cycle until disease progression for subjects randomized to receive paclitaxel plus BSC
!Once every 2 weeks until disease progression for subjects randomized to receive irinotecan plus BSC
!Once every 3 weeks until disease progression for subjects randomized to receive BSC alone
with no active therapy.
For avelumab plus BSC, a time window of up to 3 days before or 1 day after the scheduled visit day (-3/ +1 days) will be permitted for all trial procedures; however, the bi-weekly 14-day schedule should be strictly adhered to, and subjects should r eturn to the target date even if the previous visit 
was off schedule.
For physician’s choice plus BSC, a time window of up to 3 days before or 1 day after the scheduled 
visit day (-3/ +1 days) will be permitted for all trial procedures.
The tumor evaluation (see Section  7.3)  will be performed every [ADDRESS_193925]-line Gastric Cancer

84/1337.2.5 Other Baseline Assessments
All other Baseline measurements, such as vital signs, a complete physical examination, ECOG PS, 
clinical laboratory parameters, and 12-lead ECG, will be assessed.
7.3 Efficacy Assessments
Radiographic images and physical findings (physical assessments) used for the local determination of disease progression will be read centrally and reviewed by a blinded IRC. The IRC will make a determination as to whether the criteria for tumor response or progression according to RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_193932] scan or MRI (if MRI is 
used, chest CT is mandatory) imaging of the chest/abdomen/pelvis (plus other regions as specifically required) and other established assessments of tumor burden if CT/MRI imaging is insufficient for the individual subject. All the scans performed at Baseline and other imaging performed as clinically required (other supportive imaging) need to be repeated at subsequent visits. In general, lesions detected at Baseline need to be followed using the same imaging methodology and preferably the same imaging equipment at subsequent tumor evaluation visits.
For each subject, the Investigator will designate 1 or more of the following measures of tumor 
status to follow for determining response: CT or MRI images of primary and/or metastatic tumor masses, physical examination findings, and the results of other assessments. All available images collected during the trial period will be considered. The most appropriate measures to evaluate the tumor status of a subject should be used. The measure(s) to be chosen for sequential evaluation during the trial must correspond to the measures used to document the progressive tumor status that qualifies the subject for enrollment. The tumor response assessment will be assessed and listed according to the Schedules of Assessments (refer to  Table 1) .
Treatment decisions will be made by [CONTACT_166872]’s assessment of tumor status.
For efficacy determination, tumor responses to tr eatment will be assigned by [CONTACT_166873], nontarget, and new lesions according to RECIST v1.1 (all 
measurements should be recorded in metric notation, as described in RECIST v1.1 (1)).
To assess objective response, the tumor burden at Baseline will be estimated and used for comparison with subsequent measurements. At Baseline, tumor lesions will be categorized in target and nontarget lesions as described in RECIST v1.1 (1).
Results for these evaluations will be recorded with  as much specificity as possible so that pre- and 
post-treatment results will provide the best opportunity for evaluating tumor response. 
Any CR or PR should be confirmed, preferably at the scheduled 6-week interval (after 12 months 
of treatment, 12-week assessment interval will be used), but no sooner than [ADDRESS_193933]-line Gastric Cancer
EMR 100070-008
85/133The Investigator may perform scans in addition to a scheduled trial scan for medical reasons or if 
the Investigator suspects PD. Subjects who withdraw from the trial for clinical or symptomatic deterioration before objective documentation of PD will be requested to undergo appropriate imaging to confirm PD. Every effort should be made to confirm a clinical diagnosis of PD by [CONTACT_9661]. For subjects receiving avelumab plus BS C, if discontinuation occurs due to progression 
and a definitive diagnosis/radiographic confirmati on is not made at the time of discontinuation, a 
second imaging scan may be allowed for confirmation of progression. If progression at the second imaging scan is not confirmed and the subject wishes to continue, the subject will be allowed to continue receiving avelumab as long as they meet the criteria for continuation of treatment beyond 
progression.
7.[ADDRESS_193934]’s signature [CONTACT_43998]. Trial site personnel will report any AE, whether observed by [CONTACT_19007] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) . Given the intended mechanism of action of avelumab, particular 
attention will be given to AEs that may follow the enhanced T cell activation, such as dermatitis, colitis, hepatitis, uveitis, or other immune-related reactions. Ophthalmologic examinations should be considered, when clinically indicated, for signs or symptoms of uveitis.
The reporting period for AEs is described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].The safety assessments will be performed according to the Schedules of Assessments (refer to 
Table 1) .
7.4.1 Adverse Events
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Definitions
AE
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product, regardless of causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
For surgical or diagnostic procedures, the condition/illness leading to such a procedure is 
considered as the AE rather than the procedure itself.
The Investigator is required to grade the severity or toxicity of each AE.
Document No. 
Object No. CCI

Avelumab Avelumab in Third-line Gastric Cancer
EMR 100070-008
86/133Investigators will reference the NCI-CTCAE v4.03 (publication date: 14 June  2010), a descriptive 
terminology that can be used for AE reporting.
A general grading (severity/intensity; hereafter referred to as severity) scale is provided at the 
beginning of the above referenced document, and specific event grades are also provided.
If a particular AE’s severity is not specifically graded by [CONTACT_43970], the Investigator
is to use the general NCI-CTCAE definitions of Grade [ADDRESS_193935] medical judgment.
The 5 general grades are:
!Grade 1 or Mild
!Grade 2 or Moderate
!Grade 3 or Severe 
!Grade 4 or Life-threatening
!Grade [ADDRESS_193936] also be 
reported as an SAE. However, a laboratory abnormality of Grade 4, such as anemia or neutropenia,is considered serious only if the condition meets one of the serious criteria described below.
If death occurs, the primary cause of death or event leading to death should be recorded and 
reported as an SAE. “Fatal” will be recorded as the outcome of this specific event and death will 
not be recorded as separate event. Only, if no cause of death can be reported (for example, sudden death, unexplained death), the death per se might then be reported as an SAE.
Investigators must also systematically assess the cau sal relationship of AEs to trial treatment using 
the following definitions. Decisive factors for the assessment of causal relationship of an AE to 
the trial treatment include, but may not be limited to, temporal relationship between the AE and the trial treatment, known side effects of trial treatment, medical history, concomitant medication, course of the underlying disease, trial procedures.
Unrelated: Not reasonably related to the IMP. The AE could not medically 
(pharmacologically/clinically) be attributed to the trial treatment under study in this clinical trial protocol. A reasonable alternative explanation must be available.
Related: Reasonably related to the IMP. The AE could medically (pharmacologically/clinically) be attributed to the trial treatment under study in this clinical trial protocol. 
Abnormal Laboratory Findings and Other Abnormal Investigational Findings
Abnormal laboratory findings and other abnormal investigational findings (for example, on an 
ECG trace) should not be reported as AEs unless they are associated with clinical signs and symptoms, lead to treatment discontinuation or are considered otherwise medically important by 
[CONTACT_166874]. 
Object No. CCI

Avelumab Avelumab in Third-line Gastric Cancer
EMR 100070-008
87/133the Investigator. If a laboratory abnormality fulfills these criteria, the identified medical condition 
(for example, anemia, increased ALT) must be reported as the AE rather than the abnormal value itself.
SAEs
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
!Results in death
!Is life-threatening. (Note: The term “life-threatening” refers to an event in which the subject is 
at risk of death at the time of the event, not an event that hypothetically might have caused death 
if it was more severe.)
!Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43928]
!Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity
!Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect
!Is otherwise considered to be medically important.
Note: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_107922], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
For the purposes of reporting, any suspected transmission of an infectious agent via an IMP is also 
considered an SAE, as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].
Events that Do Not Meet the Definition of an SAE
Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43930], or to simplify trial treatment or trial procedures (for 
example, an overnight stay to facilitate therapy and related hydration therapy application) are not considered SAEs. However, all events leading to unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43931] (for example, undesirable effects of any administered treatment) must be documented and reported as SAEs.
Events Not to Be Considered as AEs/SAEs
Medical conditions present at the initial trial visit that do not worsen in severity or frequency during 
the trial are defined as Baseline medical conditions, and are not to be considered AEs.
AE/SAEs Observed in Association with Disease Progression
Disease progression recorded in the course of efficacy assessments only, but without any adverse 
signs or symptoms should not be reported as AEs.
Document No. 
Object No. CCI

Avelumab Avelumab in Third-line Gastric Cancer
EMR 100070-008
88/133However, if adverse signs or symptoms occur in association with disease progression then these 
should be recorded as AEs or reported as SAEs, if they meet criteria for seriousness.
AESIs
Any AE that is suspected to be a potential irAE will be considered an adverse event of special 
interest (AESI). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Methods of Recording and Assessing Adverse Events
At each trial visit, the subject will be queried on changes in his or her condition. During the reporting period, any unfavorable changes in the subject’s condition will be recorded as AEs, whether reported by [CONTACT_9303]. 
Complete, accurate, and consistent data on all AEs experienced for the duration of the reporting 
period (defined below) will be reported on an ongoing basis in the appropriate section of the eCRF. 
All SAEs must be additionally documented and reported using the appropriate report form as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].
It is important that each AE report include a description of the event, its duration (onset and 
resolution dates [and times when it is important to assess the time of AE onset relative to the recorded treatment administration time]), its seve rity, its causal relationship with the trial 
treatment, any other potential causal factors, any treatment given or other action taken, including dose modification or discontinuation of the trial treatment, and its outcome. In addition, serious cases should be identified and the appropriate seriousness criteria documented. 
Specific guidance can be found in the eCRF Completion and Monitoring Conventions.
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of the Adverse Event Reporting Period
The AE reporting period for safety surveillance begins when the subject is initially included in the 
trial (date of first signature [CONTACT_43998]) and continues for all SAEs and treatment related non-serious AEs through the trial’s Safety Follow-up Phone Call, defined at 90 days (± 1 week) after the last trial treatment administration.
Any SAE assessed as related to IMP must be reported whenever it occurs, irrespective of the time 
elapsed since the last administration of IMP. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Procedure for Reporting Serious Adverse Events and Adverse 
Events of Special Interest
In the event of any new SAE occurring during the reporting period, the Investigator must immediately (within a maximum of 24 hours after becoming aware of the event) inform the Sponsor or its designee using the SAE Report Form following specific completion instructions.
In exceptional circumstances, an SAE (or follow-up information) may be reported by [CONTACT_756]; 
in these cases, an SAE Report From must be provided immediately thereafter.

Avelumab Avelumab in Third-line Gastric Cancer
EMR 100070-008
89/133Relevant pages from the eCRF may be provided in parallel (for example, medical history, 
concomitant drugs). Additional documents may be provided by [CONTACT_737], if available (for example, laboratory results, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27450], autopsy report). In all cases, the information provided on the SAE Report Form must be consistent with the data about the event recorded in the eCRF.
The Investigator must respond to any request for follow-up information (for example, additional 
information, outcome, final evaluation, other records where needed) or to any question the Sponsor/designee may have on the AE within the same timelines as those noted above for initial reports. This is necessary to ensure prompt assessment of the event by [CONTACT_43971] (as applicable) to allow the Sponsor to meet strict regulatory timelines associated with expedited safety reporting obligations.
Requests for follow-up will usually be made via the responsible monitor, although in exceptional 
circumstances the Global Drug Safety department of the Sponsor may contact [CONTACT_166875].
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Reporting to Health Authorities, Independent Ethics 
Committees/ Institutional Review Boards and Investigators
The Sponsor will send appropriate safety notifications to Health Authorities in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
The Investigator must comply with any applicable site-specific requirements related to the 
reporting of SAEs (particularly deaths) involving trial subjects to the IEC/IRB that approved the trial.
In accordance with ICH GCP, the Sponsor/designee will inform the Investigator of “findings that 
could adversely affect the safety of subjects, imp act the conduct of the trial or alter the IEC’s/IRB’s 
approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_150831].” In particular and in line with respective regulations, the Sponsor/designee will inform the Investigator of AEs that are both serious and unexpected and are considered to be related to the administered product (suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions [S[LOCATION_003]Rs]). The Investigator should place copi[INVESTIGATOR_43933]. National regulations with regard to Safety Report notifications to Investigators will be taken into account.

90/1337.4.1.6 Monitoring of Subjects with Adverse Events
Adverse events are recorded and assessed continuously throughout the trial (see Section [IP_ADDRESS])  
and are assessed for final outcome at the 30-day Safety Follow-up Visit. SAEs and 
treatment-related non-serious AEs are recorded and assessed continuously until the 90-day Safety Follow-up Phone Call.
All SAEs ongoing at the 90-day Safety Follow-up Phone Call must be monitored and followed up 
by [CONTACT_108100], unless the subject is documented as “lost to follow-up”. Reasonable a ttempts to obtain this information must be made 
and documented. It is also the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that any necessary additional therapeutic measures and follow-up procedures are performed.
7.4.2 Pregnancy and In Utero Drug Exposure 
Only pregnancies considered by [CONTACT_166876] (for example,resulting from a drug interaction with a contraceptive medication) are considered to be AEs. However, all pregnancies with an estimated conception date during the period defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] must be recorded by [CONTACT_43978]/section of the eCRF. The same 
rule applies to pregnancies in female subjects and to pregnancies in female partners of male subjects. The Investigator must notify the Sponsor/designee in an expedited manner of any pregnancy using the Pregnancy Report Form, which must be transmitted according to the same process as described for SAE reporting in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Investigators must actively follow up, document, and report on the outcome of all these pregnancies, even if the subjects are withdrawn from the trial.
The Investigator must notify the Sponsor/designee of these outcomes using the Pregnancy Report 
Form. If an abnormal outcome occurs, the SAE Report Form will be used if the subject sustains an event and the Parent-Child/Fetus AE Report Form if the child/fetus sustains an event.
Any abnormal outcome must be reported in an expedited manner as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS], 
while normal outcomes must be reported within [ADDRESS_193937] 
be discontinued from trial treatment immediately. The Sponsor/designee must be notified without delay and the subject must be followed as mentioned above.
7.4.3 Clinical Laboratory Assessments
All laboratory samples, as detailed in the Schedules of Assessments (see Table 1) ,m u s t  b e  
collected and sent to the central laboratory for analysis, except for some samples that may be analyzed locally (Screening pregnancy testing, HB V, and HCV testing). Urinalysis and urine 
pregnancy testing will be done locally only.

and reviewed prior to randomization. Results of all central laboratory te sting will be transferred to 
the clinical database.
Local laboratory samples may be drawn and if collected are required to be recorded in the eCRFs.In case of liver function test elevations (AST, ALT, and/or total bilirubin) requiring additional 
laboratory draws (according to guidelines set forth in  Table 6) , an unscheduled laboratory draw 
should be sent to the central laboratory for analysis.
Blood samples will be drawn, processed, and stored in accordance with directions provided in the 
Study Manual and as per timing shown in the Schedules of Assessments (Table 1) .
The report of the results must be retained as a part of the subject’s medical record or source documents. Blood samples for the full safety tests listed in  Table 7 will be taken from nonfasted 
subjects as detailed in the Schedules of Assessments (Table 1) . The T4, TSH, and urinalysis will 
only be assessed at the time points defined in  Table [ADDRESS_193938]’s

(n=165 subjects/arm) to achieve 256 OS events in total.
8.2 Randomization
The trial is a randomized, active-controlled (based on physician’s choice), and open-label trial. Eligible subjects will be randomized into either the avelumab plus BSC arm or control plus BSC arm (physician’s choice) in a 1:1 ratio, stratif ied by [CONTACT_11338] (Asia versus non-Asia). The purpose of 
the stratification is to ensure balance of the treatment arms within region. Randomization will occur using the IWRS as described in Section 6.3 upon completion of the Screening/Baseline
procedures and determination of subject eligibility.
8.3 Endpoints
8.3.1 Primary Endpoint
The primary endpoint of the trial is OS, defined as the time (in months) from randomization to the date of death, regardless of the actual cause of the subject’s death.  
For subjects who are s till alive at the time of data analysis or who are lost to follow-up, OS time 
will be censored at the last recorded date that the subject is known to be alive (date of last contact, 
last visit date, date of last trial treatment administration, or date of last scan, whichever is the latest) as of the data cut-off date for the analysis.
With the completion of the primary analysis, subjects will no longer be followed for survival.
8.3.2 Secondary Endpoints
[IP_ADDRESS] Progression-free Survival
Progression-free survival is a key secondary endpoi nt and will be determined according to RECIST 
v1.1 as adjudicated by [CONTACT_26708] (see Section  2.3.2) . It is defined as the time (in months) from date 
of randomization until date of the first documentation of PD or death by [CONTACT_55544] (whichever 
occurs first).
For the primary analysis, PFS data will be censored on the date of the last adequate tumor 
assessment for subjects who do not have an event (PD or death), for subjects who start new anti-cancer treatment prior to an event, or for subjects with an event after [ADDRESS_193940]-baseline tumor assessments will be censored on the date of randomization unless death occurred on or before the time of the second planned tumor assessment, in which case the death will be considered an event.
As a sensitivity analysis, the following 3 sensitivity analyses of PFS will also be performed:
1. Considering events after start for new anticancer treatment.

[IP_ADDRESS] Best Overall Response
The confirmed BOR will be determined according to RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_193941] v1.1 will be required, 
preferably at the regularly scheduled 6-week assessment interval (after 12 months of treatment, 
12-week assessment interval will be used), but no sooner than [ADDRESS_193942] as the 
confirmed BOR according to the IRC.
[IP_ADDRESS] Subject-reported Outcomes/Quality of Life
The following subject-reported outcomes are further secondary endpoints:
!The EQ-5D-5L
!The EORTC QLQ-C30
!The EORTC Module QLQ-STO22
8.3.3 Safety Endpoints
Safety endpoints include AEs, physical examination findings, laboratory assessments, vital signs, 
ECG parameters, and ECOG PS as described in Section 7.4.

100/133In order to provide overall estimates of treatment effects, data will be pooled across trial centers. 
The “center” factor will not be considered in statistical models or for subgroup analyses due to the high number of participating centers in contrast to the anticipated small number of subjects randomized at each center. Region will be considered as a stratification factor for stratified statistical analysis as appropriate.
In general, continuous variables will be summarized using number (n), mean, median, SD, 
minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables w ill be summarized using frequency counts and 
percentages.
The calculation of proportions will be based on the number of subjects in the analysis set of 
interest, unless otherwise specified in the trial SAP.
Baseline
Baseline is defined as the last measurement taken pr ior to the first dose of trial treatment for safety 
endpoints and the last measurement taken prior to randomization for efficacy endpoints.
On-Treatment
The on-treatment period is defined as the time from the first trial treatment administration to the 
last trial treatment administration date + [ADDRESS_193943], unless otherwise stated.
Multiplicity Adjustment Strategy
The type I error rate for the primary endpoint (OS)  and 2 key secondary endpoints (PFS and BOR) 
will be controlled at 2.5% (1-sided) level using a gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_124502]. The primary hypothesis 
(OS) will serve as a gate keeper and be tested at an overall 1-sided type I error of 2.5%. Only if it 
is significant, the 2 key secondary endpoints (PFS and BOR) will be tested, and the Hochberg procedure will be used to control the type I error rate at 2.5% (1-sided) for PFS and BOR (56). 
Statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® version 9.2 or higher.
8.5.2 Analysis of Primary Endpoints
Primary Analysis
The primary endpoint is OS and will be consider ed as confirmatory evidence of efficacy. Analysis 
of the primary endpoint will occur after 256 even ts (deaths) have been observed and a minimum 
of [ADDRESS_193944] at an overall 1-sided ty pe I error rate of 2.5%. The stratification factor will 
be region (Asia vs. non-Asia). The following null hypothesis will be tested:
H0: λ A(t) = θλB(t), θ≥  1, versus H1: λA(t)= θλB(t), θ< 1,

101/133where λ (t) represents the hazard rate at time t and θ the unknown constant of proportionality of 
hazards in treatment arms A (avelumab plus BSC) and B (physician’s choice plus BSC).
Kaplan-Meier estimates (production-limit estimates) will be presented by [CONTACT_166877] a summary of associated statistics including the median OS time with 2-sided 95% CIs. In particular, the survival rate at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months will be estimated with corresponding 2-sided 95% CIs. The CIs for the median will be calculated according to Brookmeyer and Crowley (57)
and the CIs for the survival function estimates at the time points defined above will be derived using the log-log transformation according to Kalbfleisch and Prentice (58). The estimate of the 
standard error will be computed using Greenwood’s formula.
Note that the statistical conclusion will be drawn from the stratified, 1-sided log-rank test.A stratified Cox proportional hazards model will be used to assess the magnitude of treatment 
difference between the [ADDRESS_193945] ratio of avelumab versus physician’s choice (with physician’s choice chemotherapy as reference) together with the corresponding Wald 2-sided 95% CI will be presented.
The validity of the proportional hazards assumption will be assessed visually by [CONTACT_166878](-log[survival]) versus log(time) by [CONTACT_3148].
Sensitivity Analysis
The primary endpoint analysis described above will be repeated based on the PP Analysis Set as a 
means of sensitivity analysis if this analysis set includes less than 90% of subjects in the ITT Analysis Set.
8.5.3 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
[IP_ADDRESS] Key Secondary Endpoints – Progression-free Survival and 
Best Overall Response
Secondary efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT Analysis Set.
Based on the gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_166833]  8.5.1, if the 1-sided p-value from 
the stratified log-rank test of the primary endpoint OS is less than 0.0250, the key secondary 
endpoints (i.e., PFS and BOR) will be tested per the Hochberg procedure used to control the type I error rate at 2.5% (1-sided).

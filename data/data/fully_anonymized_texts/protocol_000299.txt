from laser and light -based tr eatments to devices that utilize ultrasound and radiofrequency, however this was not 
always the case. Initial skin improvement  procedures utilized ablative lasers, such as the carbon dioxide (CO 2) and 
erbium:yttrium -aluminum -garnet (Er:YAG), and resulted in substantial improvement in skin appearance, texture, 
rhytides and laxity [1-3]. However, s ince ablative treatments destroy the epi[INVESTIGATOR_884476], ample post -procedure recovery time is required and patients may 
experience side effects lasting for a few weeks. Furthermore, hypo - or hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], prolonged wound 
healing and even scarring can occur following ablative procedures [ 4-6]. Treatment methods with less risk of side 
effects and post -treatment down t ime are in high demand. As such, the choices are vast and varied, ranging from 
fractional non -ablative laser devices to those that use radiofrequency [ 7-15]. Fractional lasers inflict microscopic 
zones of thermal damage in the dermal layers of the skin without destruction of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196], thereby [CONTACT_884478] [16]. Treatment with n on-fractional, non -ablative 
laser devices requires little to no post -procedure recovery time. Nonablative lasers of vari ous wavelengths are 
effective for improvement of skin appearance  based on the principle of selective photothermolysis, whereby [CONTACT_884479][INVESTIGATOR_2517] -producing skin cells [ 17, 18]. Absorption

9  DATA ANALYSIS PLAN  
9.1 Sample Size  Calculation  
The planned sample size of up to 2 4 subjects for each laser cohort was determined based on clinical judgment to 
provide sufficient information to evaluate reduction in the  number of lentigines in the hands.  
9.2 Data Analysis  
Descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals and will be calculated for percent reduction in the number of 
hand lentigines, at 4 weeks   
Descript ive statistics and 95% confidence intervals and will be calculated separately for improvement in skin 
texture, and overall appearance of the hands, based on the Physician’s Global Improvement Assessment evaluation, and also for the Subject Satisfaction Scale evaluations.  
Safety measures include the incidence of treatment- related AEs, the proportion of subjects who prematurely 
terminate from the study due to a treatment-related AE

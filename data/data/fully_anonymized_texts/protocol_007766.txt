Protocol version: [ADDRESS_459599]  
 
Introduction: The Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) is a clinical area designa ted for patients 
recovering from invasive procedur es. There are typi[INVESTIGATOR_367594]. Patients in the PACU can be unstable and at risk for complications. 
However, clinician coverage and patient monitoring in PACUs is not well regulated and might be 
sub-optimal. We hypothesize that a telemedicine center for the PACU can improve key PACU 
functions. 
 Objectives: The objective of this study is to demonstrate the potential uti lity and acceptability of 
a telemedicine center to complement the key functions of the PA CU. These include participation 
in hand-off activities to and from the PACU, detection of physiological derangements, identification of symptoms requiring treatment, recognition of situations requiring emergency 
medical intervention, and determination of patient readiness fo r PACU discharge. 
 
Methods and Analysis: This will be a single center prospective before-and-after proof-of-
concept study.  Adults (18 years and older) undergoing elective surgery and recovering in two 
selected PACU bays will be enrolled. During the initial 3-month observation phase, clinicians in 
the telemedicine center will not communicate with clinicians in  the PACU, unless there is a 
specific patient safety concern. During the subsequent 3-month interaction phase, clinicians in 
the telemedicine center will provide structured decision suppor t to PACU clinicians. The primary 
outcome  will be time to PACU discharge readiness determination in the two study phases. The 
attitudes of key stakeholders towards the telemedicine center will be assessed. Other outcomes 
will include detection of physiological derangements, complications, adverse symptoms 
requiring treatments, and emergencies requiring medical intervention.

 Introduction  
After invasive procedures in the operating room (OR) or other p rocedure rooms, patients are 
usually transferred to a post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for h igh acuity monitoring. The PACU 
period is important for patients, especially since they often are still in a vulnerable state.1,[ADDRESS_459600] be recognized and appropriately managed by P ACU clinicians. 
Furthermore, PACU clinicians need to identify and manage patien ts’ adverse symptoms 
including pain, nausea, urine retention, weakness, and itching,  which are common after invasive 
procedures, whether with or without general anesthesia.  
 
The ideal PACU environment provides close monitoring and prompt  rescue for peri-procedural 
complications, while also efficiently transferring patients to their next phase of care. For 
example, when patients deteriorate in the PACU, it is important to recognize this early, intervene 
appropriately, and arrange transfer to a higher acuity area, su ch as an intensive care unit, when 
warranted.  
 
PACU clinicians are responsible for several clinical and organi zational tasks5 including patient 
monitoring and treatment, promoting patient throughput, conducting hand-offs to and from the 
PACU, and documenting patient care information during the recov ery period. As a result, PACU 
nurses and doctors can feel overwhelmed, and may not always be able to treat symptoms 
adequately, diagnose physiological derangements accurately, and  detect patient deterioration 
expeditiously. Furthermore, in this high-pressure, high-turnove r environment, communication 
among clinicians is often compromised, resulting in unreliable care coordination. Patient 
[ADDRESS_459601] recovere d sufficiently. This workflow 
pressure can potentially compromise quality of care and patient safety. Nurses provide the 
majority of PACU care, typi[INVESTIGATOR_367595] a time during the initial phase 
of PACU care, in accordance with the American Society of PeriAnesthesia Nurses (ASPAN) 
guidelines6. Furthermore, physicians with competing responsibilities often provide oversight in 
the PACU. For example, a physician who has responsibility for p atient assessment and 
management in the PACU is often simultaneously overseeing anest hetic care in operating 
rooms or other procedural suites. Surgical clinicians also part icipate in aspects of PACU care, 
but are often simultaneously engaged in surgical care of other patients. In addition, the 
coverage and oversight models can vary considerably across diff erent PACUs, and even within 
the same PACU over the course of a single day. This is in stark contrast to other high acuity 
patient care settings, such as operating rooms and intensive ca re units, where roles and 
responsibilities of various clinicians are well defined, and staffing models are established.  
 
In this protocol, we describe a proof-of-concept study in perioperative telemedicine that aims to 
demonstrate the (i) potential utility and (ii) acceptability of  integrating telemedicine into the 
PACU environment. This proof-of-concept study will be conducted  in the PACU located in 
Parkview Tower in Barnes-Jewish Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (BJH). If this proof-of-concept proves to be 
successful, we intend subsequently to show the impact of such a  telemedicine solution on 
safety, quality of care, efficiency, and ultimately postoperative outcomes.  Our specific aims for 
the proposed proof-of-concept study are:

to conduct this proof-of-concept study without a waiver of consent.  Additionally, this study ha s 
been determined to involve no more than minimal risk to participants, as study participation 
would not deviate from or delay current standards of peri-anest hesia care. Both the “ Good 
ReseArch for Comparative Effectiveness” (GRACE) checklist7 and PI[INVESTIGATOR_367597]8 (Table

Primary Intervention: Telemedicine Center for PACU 
Two bays in Barnes Jewish Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (BJH) in St. Louis, Missouri, will be equipped for 
telemedicine interaction (Figure 1).  Video cameras and monitors have been installed in each of 
these bays to allow for remote monitoring, as well as two-way v ideo communication during the 
interaction phase.  The telemedicine center is staffed by [CONTACT_367606] (CRNAs), anesthesiology  residents, and student 
registered nurse anesthetists (SRNAs), and is currently providi ng evidence-based support to 
clinicians in the operating rooms.11–[ADDRESS_459603] video

 The assessments in relation to PACU functions will include:  
1a. Detection of physiological derangements in PACU patients 
1b. Identification of symptoms requiring treatment in PACU patients 
1c. Recognition of situations requiring emergency medical inter vention 
1d. Determination of patient readiness for PACU discharge 
1e. Participate meaningfully in hand-off activities 
 
Observation Phase (3 months)  
In the first three months (the Observation phase) of this proof-of-concept study, a 
telemedicine center for the PACU will monito r patients assigned to two PACU bays. Both 
the telemedicine center and nurses caring for patients in the PACU bays will separately 
document physiological derangement s (Table 2), treatable sympto ms (Table 3), or a 
situation requiring urgent medica l intervention (telemedicine center only; Table 4) during 
the PACU stay. Clinicians in the telemedicine center will asses s when the patient meets 
discharge criteria, based on the modified Aldrete  scale15 and their clinical judgment. They 
will document the time that discharge criteria are met, the mod ified Aldrete scale score at this 
time, and any additional relevant information. If clinicians in the telemedicine center 
judge that they are unable to det ermine a patient’s readiness f or discharge, they will 
document their reasons (Table 5). Clinical judgment will be used in determining 
appropriate discharge par ameters for patients with pre-existing  conditions.  The 
telemedicine center clinicians will document eac h patient’s inf ormation outlined in 
Tables 2-5 directly into REDCapTM (a secure web application for managing online s urveys 
and databases) and AlertWatch . After a patient has been disc harged from the PACU, the 
PACU nurse will fill out a form providing information outlined in Tables 2-5. This includes 
11 
 information on physiological derangements, trea table symptoms, and di scharge information. 
This form will be collected by [CONTACT_3433] e research team, and the infor mation in the form will be 
documented in REDCap.  During this phase of the study, c linicians in the telemedicine 
center will not communic ate with clinicians in the PACU (nurses or physicians), unless there 
is a patient safety event.

Interaction Phase (3 months) 
In the three months following the observation phase, clinicians  in the telemedicine center will 
interact with patients and clinicians associated with the designated PACU bays using audio-
visual technology. PACU clinicians and clinicians in the telemedicine center will become a 
“fused” team, and the telemedicine center will continue to docu ment information on 
physiological derangements (Table 2), treatable symptoms (Table 3), situations requiring urgent 
medical intervention (Table 4), and discharge readiness (Table 5). 
 
The telemedicine center clinicians will assess patients’ discharge readiness throughout their 
PACU stay. A modified Aldrete scale along with clinical judgmen t will guide the telemedicine 
center clinicians in determining readiness for discharge (Table  5).  After discharge readiness 
has been determined by [CONTACT_367610] , the attending anesthesiologist in the 
telemedicine center will document discharge readiness in AlertW atch and REDCap, and contact 
[CONTACT_367611].  The telemedicine center for PACU will document when this 
information was communicated. At any point clinicians in the te lemedicine center might decide 
to contact [CONTACT_367612] (nurse or physician) if they have sp ecific concerns regarding 
patients. If the telemedicine center clinicians feel that they cannot adequately assess a patient’s 
clinical status, they will notify the PACU clinicians. This will be documented together with a 
relevant explanation (Table 5). 
 
Final determination and sign-off regarding discharge suitabilit y will be made by [CONTACT_367613]. With this proof-of-concept research project, there will be no 
change in relation to which clinicians have responsibility for decision making and clinical care. 
The telemedicine center clinicians will not write any orders in  the medical record, and will 
provide opi[INVESTIGATOR_367600] 
[ADDRESS_459605] in that environment. Th e notion is that the telemedicine 
center will not lead to any decrement in the care that PACU pat ients are currently receiving from 
nurses and physicians in that environment.   
 
The successful integration of the telemedicine center into each of the core PACU functions 
will be measured in the following ways:  
Physiological derangements – Success will be measured (in the observation phase) 
by [CONTACT_367614] y physiological 
derangements as they are occurring in the PACU. The extent to w hich the 
telemedicine center clinicians can identify these physiological  derangements will 
be measured by [CONTACT_367615] (Figure 3).   
 Symptom identificatio n and management – Success will be measured (in the 
observation phase) by [CONTACT_367616]. The extent to which the telemedicine center clinicians can identify these treatable sym ptoms will be 
measured by [CONTACT_367617] (Figure 3).  
 
 Emergency situations – Success will be measured (in  the observation phase) by 
[CONTACT_367618] s ituations requiring 
emergency medical intervention as they are occurring in the PAC U. By 
[CONTACT_367619], any time the teleme dicine center feels that an em ergency situation 
is present, preserving patient safety mandates contact[CONTACT_367620]. 
[ADDRESS_459606], 
and the agreement between telemedicine center and PACU nurse assessments 
will be quantitated.  
 PACU discharge – Success will be measured by [CONTACT_367621] (observation 
phase [without communication] and interaction phase [active communication with 
patient and PACU clinician s]) (Figure 3). The impact of the telemedicine center on 
this key function will be examined based on feedback from k ey stakeholder focus 
groups (interaction phase; see Aim 2).  The difference between sign-out times in 
the observation and the interact ion phases will be compared.

Figure 3: Overview of data collection methods and outcome measures during  the interaction 
phase of a before-and-after proof-of-concept study for a telemedicine center for the PACU.    
 
Hand-off Activity 
The telemedicine center clinicians will participate in hand-off  activities to and from the PACU.  
This includes ensuring appropriate transfer of information from  operating rooms to the PACU. 

17 
 The telemedicine center clinicians will remotely join the hand- off conversations, and review 
patients’ medical history and intraoperative course to identify  potential missed transfer of 
information.  
 
During the observation phase, the telemedicine center clinician s will observe the hand-off 
workflow, gain familiarity with the current hand-off routine, and identify possible areas of missed 
information transfer where the telemedicine center clinicians m ay have adjunct utility.  An 
example of potential adjunct ut ility would be communicating the  importance of appropriate 
insulin and glucose management in the PACU for a patient with type I diabetes.   
In the interaction phase of the study, the telemedicine center clinicians will try to fill gaps in 
information transfer during the hand-off procedure.  In addition to remotely joining the hand-off 
conversation, the telemedicine center clinicians will share per tinent additional patient or 
procedural information, especially if this could inform the patient’s PACU medical treatment. After the completion of the hand-off procedure, the PACU nurse who interacted with the 
telemedicine center clinicians will complete a short survey to assess the telemedicine center’s 
involvement in that patient’s transfer of care.  
 
The successful integration of the telemedicine center clinicians’ hand-off activity will be 
measured in the following way: 
Hand-off activity  – Success will be measured (in the interaction phase) by [CONTACT_367622]-off 
discussion. The impact of the telemedicine center clinicians on this key function will be determined from feedback from key stakeholder focus groups ( see Aim 2) and PACU 
nurse surveys. These stakeholders will comment on utility of the telemedicine center’s involvement and provide suggestions for improvement. A binary a ssessment of hand-off 
[ADDRESS_459607] the number of mandatory items 
not discussed and number of recommended non-mandatory items dis cussed. For each 
of the observation and intervention phase, for 50 randomly sele cted cases a trained 
observer (not the participant in hand-off) will use the hand-off communication assessment tool of Weinger and others
[ADDRESS_459608]. A run-in phase of 1 month during the interve ntion will elapse before 
any of the 50 detailed communication evaluations are performed.  
 
Aim 2 – Identify barriers to and facilitators for the implementation of a telemedicine 
center for the PACU, as perceived by [CONTACT_367623] a telemedicine center for the PACU. (Figure 3 ) 
 
Stakeholder Focus Groups  
We will conduct focus groups with stakeholders to gain insights regarding their perceptions of 
barriers and facilitators related to the above-noted PACU functions before and after the 
implementation and use of a telemedicine center for the PACU. W e will also gather perspectives 
from the stakeholders on the role and impact of the telemedicine center on their individual and 
team workflows in the PACU and between units during care transi tions. Focus group 
participants will include nurses, anesthesiologists, surgeons, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_367596], and PACU 
telemedicine center clinicians. Our focus groups will be homoge neous in order to understand 
the clinician workflow based on their professional role, and their use of the telemedicine center 
in supporting their role and responsibilities. Each focus group  will comprise five to six 
participants. This will allow in-depth discussions of the workflow problems and unintended 
19 
 consequences caused by [CONTACT_367624]. 
The focus group sessions will be guided by a semi-structured in terview guide focused on the 
following themes: (1) PACU core functions, (2) PACU patient workflow, (3) PACU clinician 
activities and tasks, (4) tools and technologies used to suppor t the PACU workflow, (5) major 
barriers to PACU functions, (6) use of a telemedicine intervent ion as a potential mechanism to 
support effective and efficient functioning of the PACU. We pla n to conduct 6-8 focus group 
sessions ([ADDRESS_459609]-intervention during interaction 
phase) or until data saturation is attained.  
 
Study Size 
Patients are allocated to PACU bays according to the discretion  of the nurse in charge of the 
PACU. Currently, approximately two patients per day are cared for in each bay in the 
participating PACU. Therefore, the telemedicine team will monitor approximately four patients 
per day over the course of the proof-of-concept study. We estim ate that 500 patients will be 
included in this proof-of-concept study (250 per monitored phase) (Figure 4).

Statistical Methods Primary Outcome 
This is a proof-of-concept study and will only address surrogat e outcomes. The primary 
outcome (time to PACU discharge readiness) will use two comparison groups. First, historical 
controls will be drawn from the observation phase. A propensity  score for inclusion into the 
study will be generated as a function of (minimally) surgery performed, day of week, time of day, age, and sex. 3:[ADDRESS_459610] for 
secular trends; the study hypothesis is a non-zero discontinuit y at telemedicine implementation.

 That is, if Y i is the outcome for the ith patient at time t i with covariate vector X i, while the 
implementation time is t 0, and I() is the indicator function,

where f 1 and f 2 are smooth functions. Other patient factors known to strongly influence PACU 
length of stay (age, ASA physical status, number of co-morbidit ies, morbid obesity, obstructive 
sleep apnea, surgical specialty, primary anesthesia type, histo ry of postoperative nausea and 
vomiting, preoperative pain, and scheduled case duration)  will be included as covariates. The 
minimization criteria will be least squares or trimmed least sq uares or other robust criteria if 
there are substantial outliers. Outcomes will be examined for r esidual auto-correlation, and if 
non-negligible, auto-correlation robust standard errors (such as Newey-West errors) and an 
ARIMA model will be reported. Confidence intervals will be gene rated by [CONTACT_105]-parametric 
bootstrap sampling where possible. No adjustment will be made for matching, but bootstrap methods will respect the matched “units.” P-values will be generated both by [CONTACT_367625]-deployment times as a null distribution;  that is, we will run the same 
analysis looking for discontinuity at times remote from the tru e implementation time. We will 
conduct sensitivity analyses with transformations of the outcome variable. We will use an 
excluded run-in period of 1 month as a sensitivity analysis. Be cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_367601] a telemedicine center f or the PACU, but does track 
overall acuity and surgical severity, we will use hospi[INVESTIGATOR_367602] a control time series.
 
 
Contemporaneous control patients will also be gathered. A prope nsity score for study inclusion 
will be generated as a function of (minimally) surgery performed, calendar time, time of day, 
age, and sex. 3:1 matched control patients will be included.  D ifferences will be analyzed by t-
tests using permutation calibration. Confidence intervals on th e difference in mean time to 
discharge readiness will be generated by [CONTACT_367626] p. We will include a sensitivity

 Based on data from our EHR, patients are currently in PACU for a mean of 150 min (standard 
deviation = 65 min) before they are determined to be suitable f or discharge. Based on these 
values, with 250 patients in each phase (observation and interaction), this observational before 
and after study will have >70% power with an alpha <0.005 and > 90% power with an alpha 
<0.[ADDRESS_459611] a me

be encountered when adjusting for covariates or secular trends; however, this suggests that we 
will be able to resolve differences in PACU readiness times of 20-[ADDRESS_459614] deviation is usually regarded as a “small-moderate” sized 
effect. 
 
Secondary Outcomes 
Hand-off quality assessment from the PACU nurse binary survey r esponse will be analyzed 
using a logistic regression model adjusting for surgical service, age, and sex. Because 
observation resources are required for hand-off evaluations, no  matching will be performed, and 
no contemporaneous controls will be gathered. Adjusted differen ces in rates of inadequate 
hand-off will be summarized with 95% confidence intervals and m odel-based p-values. 
[ADDRESS_459615] some 
abnormalities not caught (or caught later) by [CONTACT_367627]. Us ing the bedside assessment 
as a gold standard is therefore limited. Similarly, although we believe that abnormalities 
detected by [CONTACT_367628] f alse positives, we have no way of 
assuring that. We also cannot reliably determine the timing of the bedside nurse’s detection of 
an abnormality, as they may docum ent it much later if they believe it does not require an 
immediate intervention.  
 Each status assessment event can occur multiple times for each patient; however, we are 
unlikely to accurately capture the bedside nurse’s impression o f the number of times an event 
occurred. We will therefore binarize the presence of each asses sment type and display 
confusion matrices (count tabulations) for each assessment type , which we will summarize with 
Jaccard indicies. The “null hypothesis” that these measures do not agree at all is not meaningful 
or the subject of this study. As described above, neither is a directional superiority hypothesis 
possible to evaluate. Final Aldrete scores will be assessed wit h pearson correlation, and a t-test 
of the difference in scores presented. Differences in ready-for-discharge times will be 
summarized as mean and standard deviation, with the null hypoth esis of zero mean tested by t-
test with a robust standard error.  
Agreement of emergency medical status is unlikely to have enoug h events to be statistically 
compared. We will present cross-tabulations of (emergency detected by [CONTACT_367629]: 
24 
 yes/no) and (PACU nurse: disagree, investigate and agree, alrea dy aware, physician 
contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]). The absolute rate of telemedicine center false posi tives (team disagrees), true 
positives (team unaware), true positives (team aware), and fals e negatives (team aware > 15 
minutes prior or t never detects) will be presented with 95% co nfidence intervals. 
 
Data Collection 
Multiple sources will be utilized for data coll ection from which outcome measures will be 
extracted.  Data from AlertWatch will be automatically logged  to a secure database.  
Preoperative patient characteristi cs, comorbidities, surgical a nd clinical history, as well as 
perianesthesia information will b e captured using Epic Syste ms software (Verona, WI, 
[LOCATION_003]). Prospective data will be collected from Epic Systems for the datapoints  mentioned 
throughout the proof-of-concept study. 
 
Relevant PACU information outlined in Tables 2-[ADDRESS_459616], as the study design is observational with a before and after approach, 
improvements (for example in time to discharge) cannot be causally attributed to the 
intervention; there could be confounding explanations. Fourth, the current discharge criteria for 
the PACU do not have a firm evidential foundation (there is no gold standard measure for 
discharge readiness), and clinician gestalt plays an important role. This limitation can be 
addressed through development of rigorous, reliable and practical criteria. Finally, as a single 
center study, results will not necessarily be broadly generalizable.    
 
Adverse Events and Safety Monitoring  
We do not anticipate the occurrence of significant adverse even ts during this study. However, 
the primary investigator and the study team will review any adv erse events identified by [CONTACT_367630] p rogram as potentially attribu table to this proof-of-concept 
study. The occurrence of any signi ficant adverse events will be  reported to the HRPO, and the 
study team and HRPO would decide together whether to halt the t rial. No formal data-
monitoring committee will be used. There will be no audit of trial conduct during the 
investigation. No interim data analysis is planned for this pro of-of-concept trial unless 
unanticipated safety issues are identified. There are no provis ions for post-trial care or 
compensation to patients enrolled as part of this trial, as the intervention in this proof-of-concept 
trial involves only the additi on of real-time decision-support tools and does not change existing 
care models.  
 
[ADDRESS_459617] patients’ su rgical course. In this study, we 
propose a new model for future PACU care. Thought has been give n to assess important 
barriers to and facilitators for the implementation of a telemedicine solution for the PACU. 
Potential key findings of this study might include decreased le ngth of stay for patients in the 
PACU, as well as acceptance by [CONTACT_367631]. 
Following successful pi[INVESTIGATOR_367603] a telemedicine sol ution for the PACU, we 
subsequently intend to expand this model to more PACU bays, and possibly other PACU 
locations in order to study relevant clinical outcome measures.  
 
The impact of this this study, and subsequent future studies, m ay be far reaching.  The current 
PACU model is not well defined. A telemedicine solution for thi s important recovery environment 
has the potential to improve safety, clinical outcomes, and qua lity of care for patients recovering 
from invasive procedures. A telemedicine solution for the PACU might also provide a suitable 
solution for PACU environments in under-resourced or remote loc ations, and decrease 
healthcare costs for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_102476].

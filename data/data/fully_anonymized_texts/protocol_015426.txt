Research    2 INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 STUDY R ATIONALE   
 
The SARS -CoV-2 pandemic necessitated the closure of childcare and school sites around the world. 
Schools and childcare settings present a unique dilemma for epi[INVESTIGATOR_539628]: As indoor settings 
where individuals who are not currently eligible for COVID -[ADDRESS_703347] very high potential for the virus to spread. Timely 
detection of asymptomatic infections in school settings is necessary to prevent outbreaks in school 
settings, particularly asymptomatic outbreaks that co uld lead to larger community outbreaks among the 
unvaccinated and/or the evolution of new variants of concern (VoCs) with increased vaccine escape potential.  This project will create a unique public-facing dashboard and resource hub (SASEA Hub  
website) that provides school staff and parents immediate access to environmental testing results from 
their neighborhood with accompanying information about COVID -[ADDRESS_703348] tracing and behavioral risk mitigation 
(masking, hand hygiene, ventilation, distancing) is key to reducing SARS -CoV-2 transmission and ensuring 
safe in-person learning.   
  The S ASEA  program was co -developed by [CONTACT_59923], San Diego (UCSD), the County of 
San Diego, and 15 partner schools serving socially vulnerable students in 5 school districts. SASEA utilizes daily wastewater and surface (floor) environmental m onitoring to detect asymptomatic SARS -CoV- 2 
infections. Responsive diagnostic testing is immediately triggered by [CONTACT_539641]. In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], SASEA was significantly associated with increased testing uptake among students and staff, and 75% of asymptomatic COVID -[ADDRESS_703349] levels of vaccine uptake even when vaccines become available for children under 12, SASEA Hub schools will provide community sentinel surveillance sites with a high degree of geographic resolution.

  4/19/[ADDRESS_703350] and resource hub on testing practices among students, parents and the broader community.  
 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSM ENT  
 
There will be no risk in enrolling to receive text/email notifications for SASEA Hub website updates related 
to COVID -19 information.  
 We anticipate that the surveys  sent to school parents and staff will hold minimal risk. There is a chance 
that participants may become emotional, uncomfortable, or bored when completing the survey due to 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_539629] -19. There is a small risk that survey data confidentiality could be breached and 
sensitive information may be exposed. We will not ask for personally identifiable information in these 
surveys.   
  
2.3.1  KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS  
 There will be no risk in enrolling to receive text/email notifications for SASEA Hub website updates related to COVID -19 information.  
 We anticipate that the surveys sent to school parents and staff will hold minimal immediate and long term 
risk. There is a chance that participants may become emotional, uncomfortable, or bored when 
completing the survey due to topi[INVESTIGATOR_539629] -19. There is a small risk that survey data 
confidentiality could be breached and sensitive information may be exposed. We will not ask for personally identifiable information in these surveys. No alternative  procedures/methods have been 
considered as the surveys will hold minimal risk.  
 
2.3.2  KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
 
Being part of a school enrolled in SASEA Hub will benefit school staff and parents by [CONTACT_539642] -19 monitoring updates on  their neighborhood along with additional  COVID -19 
related information on vaccination and testing locations.

STUDY DESIGN  
 
2.4 OVERALL  DESIGN  
This study uses a mixed -methods convergent participatory design27 (Figure 5). Prior to the stepped 
wedge trial  we will work with our CAB to develop a dashboard and resource hub template. We will then 
utilize a [ADDRESS_703352] template to each cluster’s specific needs, 
preferences, and available community resources.  
C.4 Aim 1: Create SASEA  Hub, a school -based, public facing environment al surveillance dashboard and 
diagnostic testing resource hub, along with an accompanying toolkit for rapid community tailoring to 
improve access, acceptability, and implementation of COVID -19 testing in vulnerable and underserved 
communities  using partici patory action research to identify (1) core and (2) community -specific barriers 
to diagnostic testing within and across 4 low income and historically marginalized communities in San 
Diego County. 
Background  
Safer at School Early Alert Hub Study Protocol   Version 1

resource hub that can be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_539631] -19 diagnostic testing 
access and acceptability. The toolkit will contain the following components: (1)A customizable dashboa rd, developed using ArcGIS, for reporting school environmental surveillance results 
(2)Templates for online and print resources for schools to share with their community that address barriers to diagnostic testing access as well as the potential implicatio ns of a positive test; and (3)A 
toolkit to tailor the dashboard resource hub to specific communities.  
C.4.1a Methods to create Product 1  

Safer at School Early Alert Hub Study Protocol   Version 1 
  4/19/24 
 
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences 
Research    Step 1: Dashboard Template Design  
 
After convening our CAB, we will host a participatory mixed methods data analysis workshop using data 
from 15 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) in in English and Spanish with 49 parents and staff members from our pi[INVESTIGATOR_539632], as well as survey data collected from 299 parents and teachers in 
February of 2020. These data were collected during our pi[INVESTIGATOR_539633] 2020 – March 2021. 
FGD domains included perceptions of diagnostic testing and contact [CONTACT_144842], barriers to testing access, 
and preferred strategies  for notifications of environmental results. While our team has already reviewed 
these data internally and begun the process of preparing manuscripts for dissemination, a participatory 
workshop with our CAB will allow us to more fully incorporate community  member insights, providing us 
with a richer understanding of the data that will support a more responsive public -facing dashboard 
template design. After the analysis workshop, we will conduct up to [ADDRESS_703355] template using ESRI’s ArcGIS. This platform is easy to configure, can be embedded in a v ariety of websites (for example, school or district sites), and can provide real-time data 
updates on environmental monitoring results pulled from a central server maintained by [CONTACT_539644]/or the laboratory processing samples. We have already cre ated a dashboard mockup, risk 
index, and a variety of printable resources as part of our pi[INVESTIGATOR_16080] (Figure 6). We will review and modify these with our CAB based on the data analysis workshop and current local and national 
guidelines.  
Step 2: Community  Tailoring  
Once we have developed the initial template, we will tailor the dashboard to each school cluster in the 
3-4 weeks before a site rotates into the intervention (SASEA  Hub) condition using rapid community 
needs and asset mappi[INVESTIGATOR_539634] s developed by [CONTACT_539645]. We will conduct 4 focus 
group discussions (FGDs) of approximately 8 parents and staff in each cluster. Focus group participants 
will be asked to participate in a series of activities to identify community needs and assets rela ted to 

Safer at School Early Alert Hub Study Protocol   Version 1 
  4/19/24 
 
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences 
Research    COVID -19 diagnostic testing uptake and health disparities in their community. The final activities and 
focus group domains will be determined together with our CAB. Likely activities are shown in table 1.  
Table 1: Community mappi[INVESTIGATOR_539635]

diagnostic testing uptake and related health 
disparities 
2: Health and safety within the (school) 
community  Participants identify key factors in their 
community that support or undermine diagnostic 
testing and/or contribute to related health 
disparities   
3: Contribution of school and community assets 
to (school) community health and diagnostic 
testing uptake.  Participants synthesize needs, assets, and factors 
identified in exercises 1 and 2 to create a community needs and asset ranking matrix.  
4: Local action / resource creation  Using the matrix developed in exercise 3, 
participants identify pre-existing resources that 
should be included in SASEA-HUB  and/or 
resources that should be created by [CONTACT_539646] (i.e., translations or summaries of key 
information.)  
Step3: SASEA Hub documentation and tailoring toolkit  
Throughout the study, we will collect formative process data by [CONTACT_539647]. We will 
document the tailoring and academic -community collaboration process using the Consolidated 
Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR)29 and the Community Based Participatory Research 
(CBPR) model developed by [CONTACT_539648]30 as shown in Table 2. Both models recommend regular team 
meetings and debriefings to reflect on the process of implementation. We will hold regular study team and CAB check-in meetings in which we will reflect on (1) the complexity and logistics of the process, (2) the potential cost of the project and sources for long -term funding (i.e., state grants) (3) the 
organizational capacity necessary to conduct tailoring data collection and i mplement the project, and (4) 
the climate of the project and whether all team members feel equally heard and valued. Similarly, the CBPR model advises study teams to systematically reflect on (1) context, (2) partnership process, and (3) processes and outp uts of research. These CBPR and CFIR guided reflections will be recorded using a 
standardized data collection sheet.  
C.4.2.c Analyses for Product 1: We will analyze data for steps [ADDRESS_703356] these conversations and take extensive notes throughout to verify any discrepancies that emerge later. Af ter all 4 tailored 
dashboards (one per school cluster) have been deployed, we will conduct a second round of 
participatory data analysis workshops with our CAB to identify core similarities and key differences in 
Safer at School Early Alert Hub Study Protocol   Version 1 
  4/19/[ADDRESS_703357] tailoring.  
C.4.3 Expected outcomes and products of Aim 1: T he dashboard template and toolkit we generate will 
be made available on our project website ( www.SASEAsystem.org ), which already hosts open access 
laboratory and project implementation protocols for school environmental monitoring.  
 C.4.[ADDRESS_703358] very strong relationships with school districts across the county, as well as the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (see letters of support). However, if time constraints 
do not permit the opportunity for live IDIs, we will 
instead email our proposed toolkit and questions for 
written feedback.  
  
SCIENTIFIC R ATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN  
 
Our conceptual framework is based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_539637] (figure 4)  
   
Drawing from both Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) and the Social Ecological Model (SEM),  we 
assume that accessing a COVID-[ADDRESS_703359] is affected by [CONTACT_29569] s elf-efficacy and 
desire to learn one’s COVID -19 status, as well as 
social and structural factors such as geographic access to a testing site, linguistic and cultural tailoring of health outreach efforts, and community level social vulnerabilities (including 
any local, state, or municipality regulations 
related to COVID -[ADDRESS_703360], unemployment 
insurance, or rent relief). Desire to test will also be influenced by [CONTACT_539649], whether a desire to know one’s status 
is to protect on e’s own health and one’s 
community, or a fear of stigma and blame upon 
diagnosis. Testing implications are also directly related to perceived implications of a positive diagnosis – contact [CONTACT_539650], particularly for those who are undocumented or living in households with mixed documentation status – and tracking and 

Safer at School Early Alert Hub Study Protocol   Version 1 
  4/19/[ADDRESS_703361] wages, the ability to isolate safely, dependent care, and mental and emotional health 
during isolation.   
  In addition to providing resources to address these social and structural factors (i.e., providing downloadable materials in a user’s preferred language, linking local to income-replacement or other 
economic support services) SASEA  Hub is also designed to serve as a cue to action via environmental 
testing data. Environmental testing  results and a community risk indicator that incorporates the 
percentage of students and staff who have consented to responsive testing will be part of the public facing 
dashboard.   
  
SASEA Hub posits that specific cues to test as a result of concrete risk information (i.e., higher 
concentrations of COVID -19 particles in wastewater ), along with resources to address social and structural 
barriers to diagnostic testing, is more likely to result in diagnostic testing uptake than (1) offering routine 
diagnostic testing in the absence of environmental cues, and (2) environmental cues alone with no resources to offset structural barriers.  
 
JUSTIFICATION FOR INTERVENTION  
 Formative research is necessary to ensure that COVID -[ADDRESS_703362] tracing, 
and isolation strategies are appropriately tailored to the unique needs of underserved and/or socially vulnerable communities. The objective of Aim [ADDRESS_703363] and 
resource hub that can be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_539631] -19 diagnostic testing 
access and acceptability. The toolkit will contain the following components: (1)A customizable dashboard, developed using ArcGIS, for reporting regiona l environmental surveillance results (2)Templates for online 
and print resources for schools to share with their community that address barriers to diagnostic testing access as well as the potential implications of a positive test; and (3)A toolkit to tailor the dashboard resource hub to specific communities.  
 
We will utilize a [ADDRESS_703364] template to each cluster’s specific needs, 
preferences, and available community resources.  The stepped wedged trial will allow all participants to 
eventually access this COVID -[ADDRESS_703365] completed the study if s he or he has completed the community survey .

STUDY INTERVENTION(S) OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION(S)  
 
STUDY INTERVENTION(S)  OR EXPERIMENTAL MANI PULATION(S) A DMINISTRATION 
 
STUDY INTERVENTION OR EXPERIMENTAL MANI PULATION DESCRIPTION  
 
Assess SASEA  Hub’s potential to increase diagnostic testing uptake and identify more asymptomatic cases 
than schools with SASEA environmental and response testing alone (control); and  
  
Assess SASEA Hub’s  ability to increase risk mitigation behaviors (masking/double masking, physical 
distancing, increased hand hygiene, enhanced ventilation) when a potential case is signaled but not identified.  
  Intervention schools will have higher rates of diagnostic testing than control -arm schools. We will test this 
hypothesis using self-reported  survey data  
  Diagnostic testing among household members of students will be higher in the control arm. We will test 
this hypothesis using self -administered survey data. Survey participants will be asked if they (1)  have 
learned of any positive cases at the school site in the previous 14 days, and (2) whether or not they and 
their household members accessed a diagnostic test as a result of that notification.  
  School staf f and families will use more behavioral risk mitigation strategies in the three days following a 
potential case signal compared to times when there is no signal. We will test this hypothesis using 
biweekly surveys and structured systematic observations at school sites.  
ADMINISTRATION AND/OR DOSING  
 
Forty -eight participating schools (approximately 24,000 student and staff) clustered within 4 geographic 
areas will be enrolled during the study. The average size of school/childcare site is 500. Implementation of the intervention (SASEA Hub) will be conducted using a cluster randomized stepped wedge design, where the schools will be randomized by [CONTACT_15282], [CONTACT_539662], into 4 clusters (with 12 
schools per cluster). Clusters will receive the inter vention in a randomized order over 4 successive waves 
(see Figure 5) during a 20 -week period (from mid -January 2022 to beginning of June 2022).  
   
A random cross -sectional sample of parents and caregivers (hereafter referred to as “parents”) will be 
selec ted to participate in a 5 –10-minute self -administered survey conducted at 4 -week intervals (see 
Table 3). Prospective parent participants will be identified using a sampling frame provided by [CONTACT_539653], at 
the beginning of the school year, consisting of clas sroom, classroom size, and grade level. From the 
sampling frame, three classrooms within each school will be randomly selected. Within the randomly

Research    selected classroom, teachers will distribute a survey invitation to all students. Average class size is 25 a nd 
we anticipate a 15% response rate per class, resulting in approximately 12 surveys per school or 
approximately 144 surveys per cluster; equating to 2,[ADDRESS_703371] serial cross -sectional samples with replacement since serial samples will allow for greater 
represe ntation given the likelihood of student absences on the day of recruitment (e.g., potential for 
individual students to be absent and/or classrooms to be quarantined due to COVID -19 exposure). All 
parents will be notified of the study and the possibility of receiving a survey invitation by [CONTACT_539654], with periodic reminders.   
  
The primary  outcome, diagnostic testing before and after implementation of the SASEA Hub will be 
examined using a mixed effects logist ic regression with fixed effects for Time, SASEA Hub , and the 
interaction of Time x SASEA Hub. The mixed effects model will include a random component for school-level intercepts (to account for students nested within schools) and district-level intercepts  (to account 
for schools nested in districts). Potential confounders will be controlled for in the model (e.g., baseline COVID -19 diagnostic testing and vaccination rates within communities encompassing schools, school size, 
race/ethnicity, % receiving free/reduced lunch).  
 
FIDELITY  
INTERVENTIONIST TRAI NING  AND TRACKING  
 
All schools  will be receiving the same SASEA Hub website as the intervention with minimal modifications 
based on their region. Region specific wastewater results and vaccine locations will be provided.  
 
MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION  AND BLINDING  
 
Because of the stepped  wedge trial, all schools will be receiving the intervention (SASEA HUB). There is no 
randomization occurring in intervention rollout. As schools do not receive the website before the 
intervention, schools will not be in communication with other schools and will not find out about the 
website before the intervention is introduced to their campus.

PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL FROM THE S TUDY  
 
Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at a ny time upon request.  
An investigator may discontinue a participant from the study for the following reasons:  
 
• Significant study intervention non -compliance, unless varying compliance is an aspect of the study 
objectives  
• Lost-to -follow up; unable to contact [CONTACT_1130] (see Section 7.3, Lost to Follow -Up) 
• Any event or medical condition or situation occurs such that cont inued collection of follow -up  
study data would not be in the best interest of the participant or might require an additional 
treatment that would confound the interpretation of the study  
• The participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed  or not previously 
recognized) that precludes further study participation  
 
LOST TO FOLLOW -UP 
 
There will be no follow up in this study. Participants are completing a one-time survey. Participants may 
decide to discontinue the survey at any time. Participants receiving notifications to the SASEA Hub website 
may also choose to discontinue the notifications.

Research    SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
 
1. Physical risk management plan  
a. We do not anticipate any physical risks from participating in this study.  
2. Psychological risk management plan  
a. Adverse Emotional Reaction: Following administration of screeners or surveys, if 
discomfort is evident. Significant discomfort will be study PI, [CONTACT_539663]- Miller, or her 
designee, and recommendation for continued monitoring by [CONTACT_539655], as appropriate, for further evaluation and treatment will be made. 
 
3. Social/political risk management plan  
a. Adverse Community/Social impact from publication of study results: Significant  rates of 
COVID -[ADDRESS_703372] ethnic 
groups. The specifics of the rates of these disorders and behaviors, their relationship to 
risk, protective, and resilience factors, and the effects of individual and environmental 
intervention remain to be determined. However, it seems unlikely that specific rates or 
characteristics of these factors in historically marginalized school communities in San 
Diego County or differences as compared to other groups w ill lead to stigmatization. 
Nevertheless, we plan to take the following steps to minimize this risk:  
b. Ongoing community feedback to school communities about the nature, purposes, and results of the study. This will afford an opportunity for community feedb ack on issues 
that might represent potential risk of stigmatization prior to publication of results. 
 
4. Confidentiality risk management plan  
All identifiable PHI data will be stored on a secure REDCap server and shared with the CDCC 
using appropriate protocols. Paper documents and digital recorders containing names and other identifying information (i.e., paper consent forms, focus group transcripts) will be kept in a 
locked file drawer in a locked office. All digital files will be deleted after transcriptio n. 
Transcripts will be de-identified and kept on a password protected computer.
 
 
Assessment of adverse events. PI, Rebecca Fielding-Miller, PhD MSPH, or her designees, who will constitute the committee responsible for monitoring the safety of this study, executing the Data and

This protocol uses the definition of Unanticipated Problems as defined by t he Office for Human Research 
Protections ( OHRP ).  OHRP  considers unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others to 
include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  of the following criteria: 
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research  procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board ( IRB)-
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the 
participant population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156]); and  
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.

3 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS   
 
 
3.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHES ES 
 
• Primary Endpoint(s):  
For the primary outcome, we hypothesize that diagnostic testing among household members of 
students will be higher in the control arm.  We will test this hypothesis using self -administered survey 
data. Survey participants will be asked if they (1)have learned of any positive cases at the school site 
in the previous 14 days, and (2)whether or not they and their household members accessed a 
diagnostic test as a result of that notification.

3.2 SAMPLE SIZE  DETERMINATION  
 
Power was computed for a randomized stepped wedge design with 48 schools, 4 clusters (12 schools per 
cluster), and 5 steps with 1 cluster per step (or 4 -week interval) based on diagnostic testing uptake in 
response to a positive environmental signal (see 1 , responsive testing). Power is based on the primary 
outcome, on -site COVID -19 diagnostic testing uptake in response to a positive environmental signal in 
schools (see section A.4.1 and C.5.2). Published studies on the uptake of COVID -19 diagnostic testing  
among school -aged children and their household members in the presence of environmental surveillance 
are non -existent. We relied on testing rates observed in San Diego County schools during the latter half 
of the 2020-2021 academic year. Assuming a baseli ne COVID -19 testing rate of 2%, intra -class correlation 
ICC=0.10, Type I error rate of 0.05, and an average of 500 staff/students per school, we will have more 
than 80% power to detect a minimal difference of 0.06% in weekly testing uptake (2.0% pre SASEA -SNAP 
vs. 2.6% post SASE- SNAP). Using similar assumptions for the secondary outcome, COVID -[ADDRESS_703375] over 80% power to identify a minimal detectable difference of 2.8% in testing uptake w ith a serial cross -sectional sample of 2,880 parents (2.0%

Research    3.3 POPULATIONS FOR A NALYSES  
 A random cross -sectional sample of parents and caregivers will be selected to participate in a 5 –10-minute 
self-administered survey conducted at 4 -week intervals (see Table 3). Prospective parent participants will 
be identified using a sampling frame provided by [CONTACT_539653], at the beginning of the school year, consisting 
of classroom, classroom size, and grade level. From the sampling frame, three classrooms within each 
school will be randomly selected. Within the randomly selected classroom, teachers will dis tribute a 
survey invitation to all students. Average class size is 25 and we anticipate a 15% response rate per class, resulting in approximately 12 surveys per school or approximately 144 surveys per cluster; equating to 2,[ADDRESS_703376] es with 
replacement since serial samples will allow for greater representation given the likelihood of student absences on the day of recruitment (e.g., potential for individual students to be absent and/or classrooms to be quarantined due to COVID -19 expo sure).  
 
3.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
 
3.4.1  GENERAL APPROACH  
As a guide, the following should be addresse d, as appropriate:  
 
• For descriptive statistics, describe how categorical and continuous data will be presented (e.g., percentages, means with standard deviations, median, range.  
• For qualitative research, describe how procedural and interpretive rigor will be monitored and 
maintained 
• For inferential tests, indicate the p-value and confidence intervals for statistical significance (Type 
I error) and whether one or two -tailed 
• Indicate whether covariates will be pre -specified in the sections below or later in a SAP  
• State whether checks of assumptions (e.g.,  normality) underlying statistical procedures will be 
performed and whether  any corrective procedures  will be applied (e.g., transformation or 
nonparametric tests)

3.4.2  ANALYSIS OF THE PRIM ARY ENDPOINT(S)  
Descriptive statistics will be calculated for all primary outcomes, which will be assessed through the 
collection of weekly diagnostic testing surveillance data (provided by [CONTACT_539657]) and serial cross -sectional 
parent surveys. The primary outcome, diagnostic  testing before and after implementation of the SASEA 
program will be examined using a mixed effects logistic regression with fixed effects for Time, SASEA program, and the interaction of Time x SASEA program. The mixed effects model will include a random 
component for school -level intercepts (to account for students nested within schools) and district -level 
intercepts (to account for schools nested in districts). Potential confounders will be controlled for in the

a percentage of the completed consent documents.  This review will evaluate compliance with GCP, accuracy, and completeness.  Feedback will be provided to the study team to ensure prop er consenting  
procedures are followed.  
 Source documents  and the electronic data --- Data will be initially captured on source documents (see 
Section  10.1.9, Data Handling and Record Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] ) and will ultimately be entered into the study 
database .  To ensure accuracy site staff will compare a representative sample of source data against the 
datab ase, targeting key data points in that review.  
 Intervention Fidelity  — Consistent delivery of the study interventions will be monitored  throughout the 
intervention phase of the study. Procedures for ensuring fidelity of intervention delivery are described in 
Section 6.2.1, Interventionist Training  and Tracking .  
 Protocol Deviations  – The study team will review protocol deviations on an ongoing basis and will 
implement corrective actions when the quantity or nature of deviations are deemed to be at a level of 
concern.  
 Should independent monitoring become necessary, t he PI [INVESTIGATOR_31236], source data/documents, and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by [CONTACT_103] /funding agency , and inspection by [CONTACT_3482].

Research    Data collection will be the responsibility of the stepped -wedged study staff under the principal 
investigator's supervision.  The investigator will be  responsible for  ensuring the accuracy, completeness, 
legibility, and timeliness of the data reported.  
 
All source documents will be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of 
data . 
 
Survey data will be collected through REDCap , and entered into RADxUp database.  The data system 
includes password protection and internal quality checks, such as automatic range checks, to identify data 
that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  STUDY RECORDS RETENT ION  
 
Study documents will be retained for a minimum of 3 years. No records will be destroyed without the 
written consent of the sponsor /funding agency, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the sponsor /funding 
agency  to inform the investigator when these documents no longer need to be retained.  
4.1.9  PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS   
 This protocol defines a protocol deviation a s any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, 
International Council on Harmonisation Good Clinical P ractice (ICH GCP), or Manual of Procedures ( MOP ) 
requirements. The noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant, the investigator, or the 
study site staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions will be developed by [CONTACT_48162].  
 
These practices are consistent with ICH GCP:  
• Section 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, sub sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3  
• Section 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, sub section 5.1.1  
• Section 5.[ADDRESS_703382] (IRB) per their policies. The site investigator will be  responsible for knowing and adhering 
to the  reviewing IRB requirements.

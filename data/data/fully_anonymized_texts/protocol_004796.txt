2.[ADDRESS_117904]. An ideal anesthetic technique would ensure abolishing or diminishing stress response as would be evident by [CONTACT_106268] (S 100 B and NSE) and may offer neuroprotection. This should translate to better immediate postoperative outcome and hopefully improve both the short and the long term neurodevelopmental outcome in these children.

ypothesis: The use of dexmedetomidine will lead to improved 
neuroprotection against the GABAA receptors agonists and possibly other insults such as brain ischemia. This will lead to improved neurodevelopmental outcome in the dexmedetomidine group.

stress response. Also, blunting the stress response and the possible associated intraoperative hemodynamic stability will be associated with lowering the levels of different metabolic, hormonal and cytokine stress markers.

ong term Aim : Identify the impact of the use of dexmedetomidine on 
surgical stress and the neurodevelopmental outcome in children undergoing congenital cardiac surgery utilizing CPB less than one year of age.  
2.7 H
ypothesis: The use of dexmedetomidine will provide neuroprotection 
to children undergoing cardiac surgery utilizing CPB less than one year of age. This neuroprotection could be related to the mere use of dexmedetomidine as it was demonstrated by [CONTACT_106269]-vitro and in-vivo animal studies (10, 11) or due to better blunting of the stress response in these patients. This alteration in the stress response will lead to an improvement in the immediate perioperative outcome and ultimately to an improved long term neurodevelopmental outcome. 
3.[ADDRESS_117905] common birth defects. It is estimated that more than 32,000 infants are born with congenital heart defects every year. This represents one of every 125 to 150 children born in the [LOCATION_002]. Advances in the care of children undergoing congenital cardiac surgery allowed the improvement of the survival after these surgeries. In turn, the focus of outcome in children undergoing congenital heart surgery has shifted from cardiac survival to improvement in the neurodevelopmental outcome (1, 4, 14-16) and its substantial societal impact. Hence, improving these neurodevelopmental outcomes is of paramount importance and the goal of this investigation. Evaluation of children after undergoing surgical correction of CHD demonstrates a wide variety of neurodevelopmental delays including speech delay, cognitive impairment, visual-spatial and visual-motor skills, attention deficit disorder, motor delays and learning disabilities (17, 18). 
3.[ADDRESS_117906] some form of brain insult even prior to surgery. This could be due to cyanosis, severe acidosis or abnormal pattern of cerebral blood flow as in patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) where some studies have shown the presence of brain ischemia on magnetic resonance imaging, even prior to surgery(19, 20). While these are preoperative factors that will ultimately aff ect the neurodevelopmental outcome, there are 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Neurodevelopmental Outcome after Cardiac Surgery  
 Page [ADDRESS_117907], are only few that are known to be directly responsible for these events. Exposure to anesthetic agents may add another component to the outcomes after pediatric cardiac surgery. The use of GABAA agonists such as propofol, barbiturates, and isoflurane, as well as medications that de crease excitatory transmission through 
NMDA glutamate receptors such as nitrous oxide and ketamine may trigger widespread neuronal apoptosis and eventually neurodegeneration during the vulnerable periods of brain development. 
3.3 In addition, an increased plasma level of biomarkers such as, S100B and neuron specific enolase (NSE), have been linked to neurological injury and neurological outcomes after ischemic brain injury (21). Other studies have shown that increased S100B and NSE levels during and after cardiac surgery in adults was correlated with worsening of neurological outcome (22). The S-100ß is a calcium binding protein that is normally found in the intra- and extracellular brain tissue. Its presence in the plasma indicates  disruption of the blood brain barrier and brain 
injury. The S-100ß is eliminated by [CONTACT_106270] a half life of 1-[ADDRESS_117908]. A recent 
study by [CONTACT_106271] (11) has shown that the use of dexmedetomidine in mouse models provided modulation of brain derived neurotrophic factor expression. This modulation resulted in significant neuroprotective effect in vivo and in vitro .

recovery period. However, due to their delicate metabolic balance, neonates and infants undergoing cardiac surgery are at even greater risk of experiencing complications and poor outcomes due to surgical stress and inflammation.  
3.6 While the stress response plays a major role in initiating the catabolic state that follow surgery, the cytokine release contributes to the end-organ dysfunction (23, 24). The cytokines are produced mainly in the lungs and the myocardium and then spi[INVESTIGATOR_106259]. There are proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor- α 
(TNF -α), interleukin- 1 (IL -1), interleukin- 6 (IL -6) and interleukin- 8 (IL -
8). Also, there are compensatory anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin -10 (IL-10) and interleukin-[ADDRESS_117910] (IL- 1ra).

3.7 Identifying a specific anesthetic regimen that will provide some neuroprotection while offering some blunting of the stress response may improve both immediate perioperative and long term neurodevelopmental outcome in children undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB under one year of age. 
3.8 Aim 1 Rationale : The possible neuroprotection of dexmedetomidine has 
been studied in-vitro and in-vivo animal models (10, 11). There are no prospective randomized studies that show the effect of utilizing such approach on the physiological stress response and the long- term 
neurodevelopmental outcome in children undergoing cardiac surgery. In addition, this neuroprotection will be associated with lowering the levels two of the cerebral injury biomarkers [serum S-100ß (S100ß) and neuron- specific enolase (NSE) ]. This should correlate with a better 
postoperative neurodevelopmental scores at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and one year postoperatively. 
3.9 In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (12), we came to the conclusion that the use of a dose of fentanyl that is higher than 10 µg/kg in addition to dexmedetomidine should be associated with a better blunting of the stress response. In addition, in our preliminary, follow-up study, patients who had more blunting of the stress response showed better neurodevelopmental outcome, although it did not reach statistical significance in some cases likely due to the small sample size.  
3.10 Aim 2 Rationale : In our previous published study (12), we concluded 
that the use of a higher dose of fentanyl in addition to dexmedetomidine should provide better control of the stress response that will be superior to the use of fentanyl alone. In this study, we intend to prove the impact of dexmedetomidine on blunting these different stress markers even when compared to a higher dose of fentanyl alone.

6.0 Procedures Involved * 
6.1 Describe and explain the study design. 
6.2 Aim 1 Approach : Baseline neurodevelopmental status will be evaluated 
preoperatively using the standardized cognitive score from the Bayley Scales of Infant Development -III. The language and motor scores from 
the Bayley -III will be treated as secondary outcomes. Children will be 
retested prior to discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], at their post-op cardiology visit (usually [ADDRESS_117912] -op), six month and one year 
postoperatively to evaluate their neurodevelopment and its possible correlation to the S100ß and NSE values. We will, also, prospectively collect the postoperative clinical data as a measure of perioperative clinical outcome.  
6.3 Aim 1 Data Collection and Variables: For the neurodevelopmental portion of the aim, children will have a baseline neurodevelopmental Bayley score during the preoperative period by [CONTACT_106272]. These children will be retested at prior to discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], at their post-op cardiology visit (usually 1-[ADDRESS_117913]-op), six month and one year postoperatively to evaluate neurodevelopment progress. Also, at each visit parents will complete the ABAS -II, a behavior rating scale.  This assessment will be mailed home 
for completion during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions.  The neurodevelopmental scores will be correlated to the levels of the biomarkers S100ß and NSE. 
Postoperative cardiothoracic intensive care unit (CTICU) data collection 
will include: length of positive pressure ventilation support, total chest tube output during the first [ADDRESS_117914]-operatively, postoperative platelets count, postoperative absolute neutrophil count and postoperative coagulation profile including; prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), international normalized ratio (INR) and fibrinogen level. Data also included inotropic score upon arrival and at [ADDRESS_117915]-operatively.  
The inotropic score will be calculated as follow: dopamine (µg/kg/min) 
times 1 + milrinone (µg/kg/min) times 10 + epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (µg/kg/min) times 100 (25).  
Other data that will be collected include; total urine output during the 
first [ADDRESS_117916]-op and the use of nurse- controlled analgesia (NCA) 
including starting opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], the need to change the medication used and the total dose of opi[INVESTIGATOR_106260] 24 hours.  Other variables include: cardiac arrest requiring resuscitation, ventricular or atrial arrhythmia causing hemodynamic disturbances which require treatment, nosocomial

coagulation (DIC), clinical evidence of seizures, the need for re-intubation, length of ICU stay, the need for transfusing blood or blood products and total volume given, length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_106261]-operative mortality.    
6.4 Aim 2 Approach : We will perform a prospective, randomized and 
blinded study comparing fentanyl plus dexmedetomidine to fentanyl alone. Stress markers’ levels will be checked at five different points; at baseline, after sternotomy, after start of CPB, at the end of surgery and at [ADDRESS_117917] operatively. These markers include; epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238], ACTH, cortisol, glucose, lactate, TNF- α, IL-6, Il-8 and 
IL-10. The S100ß and NSE levels will be tested at baseline, end of 
surgery and 24 hours after surgery. 
6.5 Aim 2 Study Protocol and Data Collection : Patients will be randomly 
assigned to one of two groups: Group 1 (25 patients) will receive dexmedetomidine in addition to 15 µg/kg of fentanyl whereas Group 2 (25 patients) will receive normal saline as a placebo in addition to 15 µg/kg of fentanyl. 
Half of the fentanyl dose will be administered at the time of induction 
and after obtaining an intravenous access and the second half will be administered prior to skin incision. 
For the dexmedetomidine group, a bolus of the drug will be 
administered at 1 µg/kg over 10 min followed by [CONTACT_21200] 0.5 µg/kg/hr until the conclusion of cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476]. 
For placebo, normal saline will be administered at 1 µg/kg over 10 min 
and then given as an infusion at 0.5 µg/kg/hr until the conclusion of cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_106273], mean arterial pressure and heart 
rate will be continuously monitored and recorded throughout the study period 
Blood samples will be drawn from an existing arterial line post-
induction, post-sternotomy, after beginning cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476], at the conclusion of surgery, and 24 hours postoperatively. 
Blood samples will be analyzed for relative amounts of cortisol, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238], ACTH, nitrated albumin, and cytokines such as Tumor Necrosis Factor- α, Interleukin 8, Interleukin 6, and 
Interleukin 10. 
Zero balance Ultrafiltrate (ZBUF) and Modified Ultrafiltrate fluid 
(MUF) will be collected at the conclusion of surgery and analyzed for cytokines such as Tumor Necrosis Factor- α, Interleukin 8, Interleukin 6, 
and Interleukin 10. 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Neurodevelopmental Outcome after Cardiac Surgery  
 Page [ADDRESS_117918] syringe will be labeled “study drug - fentanyl”. Half of the drug volume will be administered at induction of anesthesia and the second half o f the volume will be 
administered prior to skin incision. The second syringe will be labeled “study drug - dexmedetomidine/placebo at a concentration of 4µg/ml”.  The dexmedetomidine/placebo will be administered after obtaining the intravenous access as a loading dose of 1 mcg/kg over 10 minutes followed by [CONTACT_21200] a rate of 0.5µg/kg/hr. The dexmedetomidine/placebo infusion will be discontinued after separation from CPB.  
Blood collection and storage: 3 ml of blood will be collected at five time points including: after induction of anesthesia (baseline), after sternotomy, after initiation of CPB, at the conclusion of surgery (separation from CPB and administration of protamine and prior to skin closure) and at [ADDRESS_117919]-operatively. The S100ß and NSE levels will be tested at baseline, end of surgery and 24 hours after surgery. In addition, a sample of zero balance Ultrafiltrate (ZBUF) and modified ultrafiltrate (MUF) fluid will be collected after separation from CPB and the conclusion of MUF. Blood samples will be collected in tubes with EDTA preservative and centrifuged at 1,500 x g, at 4oC degrees, for 10 minutes.  The plasma will be aliquoted and stored at -80oC degree s until 
analysis.  Plasma will be thawed on ice and centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 1 min prior to analysis.  Arterial blood gases, glucose and lactate levels will be recorded at each of the blood drawing time points. 
Hormone assays:  ACTH and cortisol will be assayed by [CONTACT_6428] (Cal 
Biotech, Spring Valley, CA).  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_106262] (2-CAT; Rocky Mountain Scientific, Centennial, CO).  All assays will be performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. 
Cytokine assays: Cytokine levels in plasma and MUF samples will be 
measured at The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_106263] (MesoScale Discovery, Rockville, MD).  Measured cytokines include IFN- γ, IL-1β, 
IL-10, IL -12 p70, IL- 6, IL -8 and TNF- α.  Manufacturer-provided 
standards and controls will be included in each run to generate calibration curves.

 Page 9 of 16  HRP -503  v.12.10.18  S100B:  Plasma S100ß levels will be measured by [CONTACT_106274] a commercially available kit (BioVendor R&D, Inc., Candler, NC) with included calibration controls.   
Neuron- specific enolase (NSE):  Plasma enolase-2 (neuron- specific 
enolase) will be measured using a Quantikine ELISA kit (R&D Systems, 
Inc., Minneapolis, MN) with included calibration controls. 
Tracheal Extubation Criteria: Assuming there are no preoperative 
contraindications for early tracheal extubation, the trachea will be extubated at the conclusion of the surgical procedure according to set criteria in our institution. After separation from CPB, hemodynamic stability without the need for vasopressor administration and absence of arrhythmias must be observed to ensure tracheal extubation.  After reversal of heparin with protamine and achievement of hemostasis, the chest will be closed. If the patient continues to maintain stable hemodynamics after chest closure, a trial of spontaneous ventilation will be allowed after reversal of the neuromuscular relaxants. If the patient continues to maintain stable hemodynamics with acceptable respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], tidal volume and expected arterial oxygen saturation at the 
conclusion of the procedure, the trachea will be extubated.   
Intraoperative data collection included: Age, weight, gender, diagnosis, 
induction time (from the start of the induction of anesthesia to first blood gas), bispectral index (BIS) value, cerebral saturation data, baseline hemoglobin, baseline platelets count, acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) volume prior to CPB, CPB circuit prime constituents, red blood cell (RBC) administration, additional blood products (platelet, cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_106264]) and total volume of each product given, UF and MUF volume, cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_95187], aortic cross clamp time, and the time of tracheal extubation if applicable.  
6.6 Long Term Approach : Baseline neurodevelopmental status will be 
evaluated preoperatively using the Bayley- III. Enrolled subjects will be 
re-evaluated at 5 years of age by [CONTACT_106275] -II (DAS -II).  Parents will also complete the ABAS -II and the 
Child Behavior Checklist (CBL).

temporary high blood pressure when the dose is started, but treatment of the high blood pressure is rarely needed. In studies with adults, common side effects were low blood pressure (28%), high blood pressure (16%), nausea (11%), slow heartbeat (7%), fever (5%), vomiting (4%), difficulty breathing (4%), fast heartbeat (3%), and anemia (3%). 
15.[ADDRESS_117925] common side effects of Fentanyl are reduced air flow into the lungs, breathing that slows or stops, muscle tightness, and slow heartbeat that requires treatment. Fentanyl may also cause high blood pressure, low blood pressure, dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, excessive sweating, uncontrolled tightening of the vocal cords that makes breathing difficult, excessive happi[INVESTIGATOR_008], shrinking of the eye pupi[INVESTIGATOR_8324], and tightening of the airways.

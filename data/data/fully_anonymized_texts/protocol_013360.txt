1 BACKGROUND  AND  INTRODUCTION 
Meibomian glands are located in the tarsal plate of the upper a nd lower eyelids, where they 
terminate along the interior rim (or margin) of the eyelids.  T hese glands secrete meibum, 
which is a lipid-rich essential component of a healthy tear fil m. When sufficient meibum 
is not present in the tear film, the aqueous layer of the tear film is disrupted and readily 
evaporates causing irritation, redness, and inflammation of the  lid margin and surrounding 
tissues.  Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD) is associated with a failure of these glands 
to produce adequate quantities of meibum due to atrophy, inflam mation, or obstruction, 
and is thought to be the most common cause of evaporative dry e ye disease (EDE)1.
Recommended methods for diagnosis of MGD reported in the literatu re2includes 
evaluation of meibomian gland expressibility by [CONTACT_141472] l pressure and observing 
gland response with a slit-lamp microscope.
1.1 INDICATION  FOR  USE 
The iLux System is indicated for the application of localized heat and pressure therapy in 
adult patients with chronic cystic conditions of the eyelids, in cluding meibomian gland 
dysfunction (MGD), also known as evaporative dry eye. 
1.2 ILUX SYSTEM  
The iLux system enables an eye care professional to apply a treat ment to unclog blocked 
glands by [CONTACT_141473]. By [CONTACT_141474], the gla nds can resume providing 
lipi[INVESTIGATOR_141448], which is key to preventing the aqueous  (tear) layer from evaporating.
Clogged and unproductive meibomian glands lead to increase evaporation of the aqueous 
layer of the tears leading to inflammation and eventually atrop hy of the meibomian glands.  
It is not known if an atrophied gland can be “revived”, therefo re it is important to maintain 
the health and viability of the existing meibomian glands. The iLux treatment is designed 
to unclogged meibomian glands thereby [CONTACT_141475]. 
The main components of the iLux system include a disposable tip section and a handheld 
battery-powered instrument.  The disposable tip section is a st erile, single-use device that 
snaps onto the tip of the instrument.  It has a thin back plate  that slides underneath the 
eyelid, and a front plate that is pushed against the front surf ace of the eyelid.  All materials 
that contact [CONTACT_141476].  The instrument portion has 
a high-quality magnifying lens that allows the clinician to vie w the eyelid margin 
throughout the procedure.  There is also a compression control switch, when pressed, 
advances the front plate against the patient’s eyelid.

To treat clogged glands, the clinician presses the heating swit ch (located on the 
compression control switch) to turn on the energy source and wa rm the eyelid tissue.  The 
inner eyelid temperature is displayed on the instrument, enabli ng the clinician to titrate the 
ideal amount of heating and compression to optimize unclogging o f the blocked glands.
The handheld device includes circuitry with a heat safety limit  of 44°C so the inside of 
the back plate that contacts the  inner part of the eyelid and th e front plate that contacts the 
outer part of the eyelid cannot go above this safe temperature.
The iLux system was used recently on [ADDRESS_160603]-heating assessments.  
The clinical parameters outlined in Appendix 1 shall be evaluat ed for each eye treated with 
the iLux device per the schedule outlined.
1. Discomfort/pain during, and after treatment –A subjective pain scale shall be used.  
A subjective report of discomfort shall be recorded on a scale of from 0-10.
Descriptive Anchors on the scale include: 0 = no discomfort or pain, 2 = slight or 
transient awareness of pressure without pain, 4 = moderate disco mfort with minimal 
pain, 6 = moderate pain, 8 = severe pain, 10 = intolerable pain .  In an effort to provide 
some level of consistency to the subjective discomfort report, a scale shall be provided 
for the subject to compare their level of discomfort to commonl y experienced epi[INVESTIGATOR_141449]-day life (see Table 1 below).

xRelatedness to study treatment
xTreatment or action taken.
xOutcome
Whenever possible, recognized medical terms should be used when  recording AEs.
Colloquialisms and/or abbreviations should not be used. Only one medical concept, 
preferably a diagnosis instead of individual symptoms, shall be recorded as the event.
If more than one distinct adverse event occurs, each event shal l be recorded separately.
5.3.1 Classification of Adverse Events by [CONTACT_141471]/Severity 
All adverse events shall be grade d on a three-point scale (mild,  moderate, severe) for 
intensity/severity, defined as a qualitative assessment of the level of discomfort of an 
adverse event as is determined by [CONTACT_19577]/her by [CONTACT_423].  
The assessment of intensity is made irrespective of study proce dure relationship or 
seriousness of the event and shall be evaluated according to the  following scale:
Mild: Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated.
Moderate: Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity.
Severe: Incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity.
There is a distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an adverse event. Severity 
is a measurement of intensity; thus, a severe reaction is not necessarily a SAE.
5.3.2 Expectedness 
All AEs shall be evaluated as to w hether they are expected or une xpected.
Expected (anticipated): An adverse event is expected when the nature, 
severity, or degree of incidence was previously 
described, including those events listed in section 
5.4.2.
Unexpected (unanticipated): An adverse event is unexpected when the nature, severity, or degree of incidence was not previously described.
5.3.3 Relatedness 
The study investigator shall evaluate if the AE is related to t he iLux heating.  Relationship 
is defined in the following manner:
Not related: The event is clearly related to other factors such as subject’s  
clinical state, therapeutic interventions, concomitant disease or 
therapy administered to the subject, and does not follow a 
known response pattern to the procedure.
Page 33 of 65
Related: The event follows a reasonable, temporal sequence from the 
time of procedure and/or follows a known response pattern 
to the study procedure and cannot be reasonably explained 
by [CONTACT_141477]’s clinical state, therapeutic 
interventions, or concomitant therapy administered to the 
subject.
5.3.4 Treatment or Action Taken 
Action taken in response to an adverse event shall be recorded as:
xNone
xOTC or Rx drug added
xNon-drug treatment/procedure
xHospi[INVESTIGATOR_141450]:
xNone
xStudy procedure interrupted
xStudy procedure discontinued
5.3.5 Outcome 
The clinical outcome of an AE shall be characterized as follows :
xResolved without sequelae
xResolved with sequelae (specify)
xOngoing (i.e. continuing at time of study discontinuation)
xDeath
xUnknown
5.4 R ISK ANALYSIS & ANTICIPATED ADVERSE EVENTS  
5.4.[ADDRESS_160604] of the potential hazards identified in the an alysis are common to many 
medical devices and are addressed by [CONTACT_141478]. Other 
potential hazards unique to the iLux were addressed by [CONTACT_141479] (FMECA) and identifying contro ls to reduce residual risks 
to acceptable levels. 
The iLux is used in the eye and the sterile disposable may come  in contact [CONTACT_141480].  Th e sterile disposable is 
covered with a biocompatible silicone similar to a contact [CONTACT_13293] .  There is nothing implanted 
either temporarily or permanently in the eye related to the iLu x and the risk is similar to 
other meibomian gland treatments.  Testing demonstrated that the disposable meets the 
requirements for biocompatibility (ISO [ZIP_CODE]) and sterilization  and packaging (ISO 1135, 
ISO [ZIP_CODE]).  
Page [ADDRESS_160605] labora tory, Nemko.  As part of the 
evaluation, the risk management files were reviewed to verify c ompliance with ISO [ZIP_CODE]. 
Other IEC [ZIP_CODE]-1 tests included electromagnetic compatibility (IEC [ZIP_CODE]-1-2) and 
optical radiation safety (IEC [ZIP_CODE]).  The iLux system successf ully met the requirements 
of all tests performed.
The instrument warms the eyelids using optical radiation (i.e.,  light) at two wavelengths, 
lime-green and infrared.  Potential photobiological hazards wer e evaluated by [CONTACT_141481], PhD, who is an internationally-respected expert in the field of optical radiation 
hazards and consults frequently with both the FDA and industry.   His testing was also 
witnessed by [CONTACT_141482] [ZIP_CODE].  Their 
analysis concluded that the iLux system poses minimal risk for damage to the eye or skin 
and can be classified as exempt from warnings.  To further redu ce risk, the heating cannot 
be operated without a disposable attached, which blocks a signi ficant portion of the emitted 
light.A safety study was conducted at Absorption Systems in San Diego  from November to 
December, 2014.  The study involved exposing one shaved eyelid on each of four New 
Zealand white rabbits to the same energy wavelengths and levels  that are emitted by [CONTACT_141483], using a back plate and front plate similar to the human device, and applying 
a controlled force to the eyelids.  One cohort received two-minute treatments and the other 
received four-minute treatments, with each treatment applied on ce per week for five 
treatments.  No adverse events occurred and there were no chang es observed in the eyelids 
or eyes, and there were no adverse histological findings. 
The iLux system measures temperatures on the inner and outer su rfaces of the eyelid.  Four 
redundant temperature sensors are included in the disposable.  The instrument displays the 
highest inner eyelid temperature.  If any of the four sensor re adings exceeds 44 °C, the 
instrument automatically turns off the heat source. Bench top t esting has shown that the 
back plate of the iLux disposable tip does not heat above 40°C.Lastly, the iLux system was recently used on [ADDRESS_160606] udy.
5.4.2 Anticipated Adverse Events 
xEyelid/eye Pain
xEyelid Irritation or Inflammation
xOcular Surface Irritation or Inflammation
xOcular Symptoms –Burning, stinging, tearing, itching, discharge, redness, foreig n 
body sensation, visual disturbance, sensitivity to light.

7.1 E FFICACY ENDPOINTS  
The primary efficacy endpoint of this trial is the tempe rature of the cornea and 
the surrounding eye tissue  after heating wi th the iLux instrument.
7.2 S AMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION  
A sample size of 15 subjects (30 eyes) has been chosen for an ini tial assessment of the 
safety of the iLux System in this patient population. This numb er was chosen to provide 
sufficient data to make an initial safety determination of the System while minimizing the 
number of patients subjected to a clinical trial.

This is a research study. This study includes only individuals who  voluntarily choose to 
participate. Please take your time to make your decision. Discus s it in confidence with your 
regular doctor, friends and family if you want.  Be sure to ask q uestions about anything you do
not understand in this document. Taking part in a research study  is entirely voluntary and you 
can stop being in the study at any time you want to, without an y penalty or impact on your 
medical care or benefits.
The reason we are doing this research study is to gather inform ation. In this document, you will 
see the term “treatment.” This term is used in research studies  and is not meant to indicate 
that you will be receiving medi cal treatment for your condition  as the device being used in this 
investigational study is experimental.WHAT IS THIS STUDY ABOUT?
The purpose of this study is to measure corneal temperature as w ell as the surrounding eye 
tissue temperature including the eye lids after heating the eyelids with the iLux device after 
treatment with the iLux™ device. Bench top safety testing has shown that the back plate of the iLux disposable tip does not heat above the safe temperature of  40°C (104°F). The study 
device is investigational, which means that it is not approved b y the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA).
If you participate in this study, y ou will be receiving one trea tment with the iLux device.  
HOW LONG IS THIS STUDY? HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE WILL BE IN THIS STUD Y? 
About 15 adults with healthy eyes will take part in this study. Yo u will be in the study for about
one week, including a screening evaluation, a single treatment and a follow up evaluation one 
day after the treatment visit. 
Page 55 of 65
WHAT IF NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE?
If new information in relation to the study DEVICE becomes avail able, that may be relevant to 
the purpose and safety of the study and your willingness to con tinue participation in this study, 
you will be informed by [CONTACT_39635].
WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THE STUDY?
If you agree to take part in this research study, you will be re quired to sign this informed 
consent form before any procedures take place.  STUDY PROCEDURES:
During the screening and if you qualify and continue, during the study the following procedures will occur:
xDemographics/medical/ocular history
xVisual acuity (a test to evaluate your vision)
xSlit lamp evaluation for anterior segment health (an exam allowi ng the doctor to see the 
front of the eye)
xEvaluation of any eyelid margin abnormalities
xCorneal fluorescein staining slit lamp evaluation (a variation o f the slit lamp exam that 
allows for the doctor to see abrasions and scarring on the eye)
xIntraocular pressure (an exam to assess the fluid pressure insid e the eye)
xiLux™ treatment
The study doctor will talk to you and give you a list of the th ings you must do to participate, 
such as:
  
xYour history of contact [CONTACT_141485] [ADDRESS_160610] eye drops with numbing 
medicine dripped into your eye to keep the eye surfaces numb du ring the treatment (the 
effects of these eye drops will wear off in 10-20 minutes after  the procedure). The study doctor 
will gently pull your eyelid away from the eyeball and place th e eyelid between two pads on the 
device then gently squeeze the eyelid between the pads. 
Page [ADDRESS_160611] ivates a green light and some 
infrared (warming lights) on the eyelids for [ADDRESS_160612] o n your eyelids.
The device is designed to shut off automatically if you eyelids  get too hot. It is also designed 
NOT to touch your eyeball. However, if it accidentally did touc h your eyeball, the device will be 
cool enough that you eyeball is not warmed higher than your normal body temperature. This 
helps prevent any risk of damage to you eye. 
You will be asked to answer questions about whether you are hav ing any eye discomfort on 
the day of the procedure or the next day.After the one day follow up phone call, your participation in t he study will end. 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS OF PARTICIPATING IN THIS STU DY?
The iLux™ is used in the eye and the sterile disposable may come  in contact [CONTACT_141480].  Th e sterile disposable silicone 
pads are covered with a biocompatible silicone similar to a con tact lens.  There is nothing 
implanted either temporarily or permanently in the eye related to the iLux™.
David Sliney, PhD, a nationally-respected expert in the field o f ocular radiation hazard who 
consults frequently with both the FDA and industry, performed an  on-site evaluation of Tear 
Film’s benchtop system.  He concluded that the iLux™ system con forms to applicable safety 
standards.The iLux has also undergone safety testing by [CONTACT_141486].   
An animal safety study was conducted at Absorption Systems in Sa n Diego from November to 
December, 2014.  No adverse events occurred and there were no c hanges observed in the 
eyelids or eyes, and there were no adverse histological finding s. 
Anticipated risks include: Eyelid/eye pain (during and after proc edure), eyelid irritation or 
inflammation, ocular surface irritation or inflammation and ocu lar symptoms (stinging, tearing, 
itching, discharge, redness, foreign body sensation, visual dis turbance, sensitivity to light). 
There may be risks to being in this study that we cannot predic t.  
You should discuss these risks wi th the study doctor and/or your regular doctor. 
Side effects occurring during the trial can be treated by [CONTACT_39635], if this is deemed 
necessary. It is important that you inform the study doctor any  unusual or unpleasant effects 
which you should feel.

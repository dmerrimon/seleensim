3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
3.1 Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) 
 
PCNSL is an aggressive subtype of diffuse la rge B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with increasing 
incidence over the last decade (Deangelis, 2006). PCNSL usually develops in the brain but can also 
involve other compartments of the CNS including spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], meninges, cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872], and eyes. Compared to systemic DLBCL, PCNSL has a poorer prognosis (Ferreri 2011) with a cure rate 
of around 20-30% (Reni, Ferreri et al. 1997; Gavrilovic,  Hormigo et al. 2006). Prognosis is especially 
poor for patients over age of 60 and patients with relapsed/refractory disease. The management of 
this disease poses a difficult challenge in neu ro-oncology. Median survival for patients with 
progressive disease without treatment is two months. Unfortunately, the optimal salvage regimen is not known and only a few prospective clinical tr ials have addressed this patient population.  In 
contrast to other CNS malignancies, patients with PCNSL are mainly treated with conventional methotrexate-based chemotherapy and targeted agents have not been introduced into the treatment regimen of PCNSL. Even in patients with treatment resistant PCNSL, further chemotherapy or radiation is used. Targeting molecular abnor malities has not been advanced in PCNSL mainly 
because the molecular pathogenesis of PCNSL remains still largely unknown due to the relative rarity of this disease and the fact that tumor tiss ue is usually collected in only small quantities for 
diagnostic purposes. In systemic lymphoma, gene expressions profiling has identified two major subgroups: germinal center type and activated B cell (ABC) the latter being associated with a poorer clinical prognosis (Alizadeh et al., 2000) but ABC DLBCL cell lines have shown to respond 
remarably well to targeted inhibition of the pho sphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway (Kloo, 
2010). More than 95% of PCNSL cases are of the ABC/non-germinal center subtype (Camilleri- 
Broet, Criniere 2006). Therefore, the use of PI3K inhibitors could be promising in PCNSL, 
particularly in patients that have failed conv entional methotrexate-containing chemotherapy 
regimens. 
 
3.2 Secondary CNS Lymphoma (SCNSL)  
SCNLS represents CNS involvement through direct invasion by a systemic non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 
SCNSL incidence has increased with more effective first-line therapy of systemic DLBCL. SCNSL 
most commonly presents with concurrent systemic progression of lymphoma and carries a poor prognosis with a median survival of 1-5 months (Grier and Batchelor, 2005). Involvement of the CNS 
may include the brain and leptomeninges. Like PC NSL, SCNSL therapy is challenging and usually 
involves methotrexate-based chemotherapy. For patients failing chemotherapy, palliative radiation 
can be offered but prognosis is dismal. 
 
3.3 Relapsed/refractory PCNSL  
Patients who relapse after initial therapy have an especially poor prognosis (Tyson, Siegal et al. 
2003; Ferreri 2011) with a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_539361] (Ferreri 2011). Based on 
long-term follow-up data, the relapse rate after high-dose methotrexate-based therapy with or 
without consolidation whole-brain radiation is 44% (Gavrilovic, Hormigo et al. 2006). The site of 
relapse is frequently in the brain but can also be in other compartments of the CNS or more than 
one compartment (Gavrilovic, Hormigo et al. 2006). 
 
3.4 Current management of relapsed/refractory PCNSL  
Chemotherapy treatments for relapsed/refract ory CNS lymphoma are not efficacious and are 
associated with short progression-free survival (Tabl e 1). Whole brain radiation therapy is used if 
radiation to the CNS has not been given previously  but is associated with increased risk of

 neurotoxicity (Ferreri 2011). HDC/ASCT has also been studied in this setting (Table 2). Clearly, new 
agents are urgently needed for relapsed/refractory CNS lymphoma. 
 
3.5 The Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K Pathway)  
The PI3K signaling pathway regulates diverse cellular functions including cell proliferation, survival, 
translational regulation of protein synthesis, glucose metabolism, cell migration, and angiogenesis 
(Katso, 2001). PI3K signaling also serves a central role in the pathogenesis of numerous forms of neoplasia.  At the structural level, the enzyme PI3K is composed of a 110-kDa catalytic subunit and an 85-kDa adaptor subunit. The PI3K signaling is modulated by [CONTACT_236019], including growth factors (such as EGF, IGF-1, and FGF), hormones (such as estrogen and thyroid hormone), integrins, intracellular calcium levels, and RAS signaling. PI3K signaling is negatively regulated at 
the level of PIP3 clearance by [CONTACT_236020], such as the phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) protein and the inositol 5-phospatase-2 (SHIP2) protein.

Constitutive activation of PI3K signaling is known to be a critical step in mediating the transformation 
potential of oncogenes and tumor suppressors in many tumor types (Liu 2009).  Resistance to a 
variety of therapeutic interventions, including chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and anti-HER2 
MEMORI AL SLO AN-KETTERING C ANCER CENTER 
IRB PROTOCOL 
IRB#: 14-177 A(5)
Amended:08/25/[ADDRESS_702982] (McCubrey 2006). 
Moreover, preliminary data suggest that activation of the PI3K pathway may be a predictor of poor 
prognostic outcome in many cancers. 
Molecular changes leading to constitutive activa tion of the PI3K pathway are diverse and include, 
but not limited to, 
• Gait-of-function mutation of PI3K subunits ( PIK3CA encoding the PI3K at the catalytic 
subunit p110alpha; genes encoding the p85 regula tory subunit) or oncogenes encoding 
positive regulators of PI3K (e.g. HER2, EGFR, RAS. Src-family proteins) or 
• Loss of function mutations or epi[INVESTIGATOR_539362]3K 
signaling (e.g. loss of PTEN expressi on or function) (Chow 2006, Cully 2006) 
Together these observations suggest that PI3K pathway could be a critical therapeutic target for the 
treatment of patients with advanced solid malignancies who often have limited therapeutic options 
beyond institutional standard of care.  Hence, the pan-PI3K inhibitor buparlisib potentially addresses 
an unmet medical need in such patients. 
 
3.6 The PI3K/mTOR/Akt Pathway in Lymphoma  
The  early  experience  with  PI3K  inhibitors  in  systemic  lymphoma  is  very  encouraging 
(Fruman 2011). Systemic lymphomas,  and its most  common  subtype  diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL)  can  be distinguished  based  on their  gene  expression profiling into germinal center type and activated B cell center (ABC) type (Alizadeh 2000). ABC- type DLBCLs 
have a poorer clinical outcome but ABC cell lines respond remarkably well to PI3K inhibition 
(Kloo 2010). Inhibition of the PI3Kdelta isoform seems to be particularly effective in ABC DLBCL, consistent with the prominent role of PI3Kdelta-mediated signaling in lymphocyte biology (Fruman 2011). 
 
3.7 The PI3K/mTOR/Akt Pathway in PCNSL  
Utilizing  12  patient-derived  xenograft  models  from  patients  with  intracranial  lymphoma;  9/12 xenograft models are from patients with PCNSL, 3/[ADDRESS_702983]  activation. Using imm unohistochemical staining 
and western blotting we observed increased phosphor ylation of both 4EBP1 and ribosomal protein 
S6 (234/235) in all examined patient-derived or thotopic xenograft models (compared to normal 
mouse brain) (Fig. 2). These xenograft models also  exhibited higher levels of AKT phosphorylation 
(Ser308 and Ser473) than intracranial xenografts from other cancer types (Fig. 2), suggesting that aberrant activation of the PI3K signaling pathway may occur upstream of AKT in PCNSL.

We also established a pre-clinical ex-vivo animal model (slice cultures) to explore the effects of PI3K 
pathway inhibition. The pan-class I PI3K inhibitor buparlisib reduced phosphorylation levels of AKT 
(Ser473) dose-dependently and also induced cell deat h as measured by [CONTACT_539393]

It is well known that the majority of PCNSL are of the 
non-germinal center or ABC subtype. We examined 
138 PCNSL patient samples and observed that 88% 
are of the non-germinal center or ABC subtype and 
therefore should respond well to PI3K inhibitors. To 
further investigate the activation status of the PI3K pathway in PCNSL, we examined the same 138 
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human PCNSL tissue samples for PI3K pathway 
activation using phosphorylated 4EBP1 (phospho-site threonine 37/46) as readout. 79.1% of patient 
samples were positive for phos pho-4EBP1 staini ng (Fig 4).

The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway has been the focus of recent advances in cancer therapeutics in the lymphoma field.  Buparlisib is a potent and highly  specific pan-class I PI3K inhibitor and has been 
extensively studied in non-clinical animal models.  A maximal tolerated dose has been established and is currently being evaluated in clinical trials  with oncologic indication including non-Hodgkin

 lymphoma (MSK Protocol IRB # 13-072).  Buparlisib is of additional interest as it has good CNS 
penetration and is currently being studied in a phase II trial in recurrent glioblastoma patients. 
 
 
4.0 OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.1 Design  
 
Buparlisib is a potent and highly specific oral pan-class I PI3K inhi bitor and has been studied 
extensively in non-clinical models and is currentl y being evaluated in clinical trials for several 
oncologic indications including non-Hod gkin's lymphoma and glioblastoma. 
 
As already stated in previous sections, inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, including 
buparlisib, may be therapeutically effective in PCNSL and SCNSL patients based on the 
observations from pre-clinic studies with inhibito rs of the PI3K pathway as well as clinical 
trials in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Buparlisib, a pan-class I PI3K inhibitor with established CNS 
permeability, presents a particular intriguing compound to be used in the treatment of relapsed/refractory PCNSL/SCNSL. 
 
4.1.1 Rationale for the study design  
 
An open label, single arm, phase II study has been selected to explore the efficacy and 
safety of buparlisib in patients with relapsed/refractory PCNSL and relapsed/refractory SCNSL. Twenty-one patients will be enrolled of which at least [ADDRESS_702984] relapsed/refractory PCNSL. 
 
No clear data exist on the effect of targeted therapy in either PCNSL or SCNSL.  Additionally, no clear data exist that activation of the PI3K pathway in PCNSL or SCNSL is predictive for response to a PI3K inhibitor. Thus, enrollment of patients with activated as well as non- 
activated PI3K pathway is considered appropriate. 
 
In the absence of a comparative arm but based on historical data, PFS24w is considered an 
appropriate primary endpoint to objecti vely measure anti-tumor activity. 
 
A single arm study will be performed due to lack of approved agents as well as small patient 
population. 
 
The protocol specific assessments, treatment and follow-up are consistent with a standard procedures applied in this disease setting. 
 
4.2 Intervention 
 
Buparlisib 100 mg once daily has been established as the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) in 2 single agent trials (CBKM120X2101 and CBKM120X1101) and one combination trial (CBKM120x2107 with trastuzumab). 
 
Accordingly, buparlisib will be dosed at 100 mg/day (see Table 3).

5.1.6 Buparlisib Administration  
All participants will initiate treatment within 96 hours of registration. Buparlisib will be self- administered on a continuous once daily dosing schedule.  There will be no breaks between 
dosing schedules. 
 
The following general guidelines should be followed for buparlisib administration: 
• Patient should be instructed to take the dose of buparlisib once daily in the morning, at 
approximately the same time each day. 
•   Buparlisib should be taken at least [ADDRESS_702988]. 
•   Patient should not eat for 2 hours after the administration of each buparlisib dose. 
• Buparlisib should be taken with a glass of water.  Patient should swallow the capsules as 
a whole and not chew them. 
• If vomiting occurs during the course of treatment, no re-dosing of the patient is allowed 
before the next scheduled dose. The occurrence and frequency of any vomiting during a 
treatment cycle must be noted. 
• If the patient forgets to take the dose before 18:00 (6PM), then the dose should be

 In general, the use of any concomitant medications/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_539364], including drugs given prophylactically (e.g. antiemetics) with the following exceptions: 
 
• Strong CYP3A inhibitors and CYP3A inducers are prohibited.   Moderate CYP3A inhibitor 
and inducers may be used with caution. In vitro studies suggest that buparlisib is a 
sensitive CYP3A4 substrate.  Co-administrat ion of buparlisib with strong and moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitors is predicted to increase the systemic exposure to buparlisib; likewise 
CYP3A4 inducers can be expected to decreas e systemic exposure to buparlisib, possibly 
resulting in sub-therapeutic drugs levels.  Please refer to Appendix [ADDRESS_702991] may not be comprehensive. 
• CYP3A and CYP2C substrates are discouraged but may be used with caution and 
monitoring.  Particularly, caution is advised when buparlisib is co-administered with drugs 
that are sensitive substrate or have a narrow therapeutic index.  Participants receiving 
such medications must be monitored for po tentiation of toxicity due to any individual 
concomitant medications, and my require dose titration or reduction of the drug substrate. Please refer to Appendix [ADDRESS_702992] may not be comprehensive. 
• QT interval prolonging medications known to induce Torsades de Pointes or to promote 
QT prolongation are prohibited (see Appendix 3). If a participant, after initiating study drug, requires the concomitant use of a drug known to prolong the QT interval, then investigators, at their discretion, may co-administer such medications with appropriate monitoring. The Primary Investigator should be consulted as soon as possible 
• Concomitant use of QT prolonging medications that have a conditional or possible risk to 
induce Torsades de Pointes is allowed with  caution and monitoring (see Appendix 4) 
• Medications with the potential to alter se rum electrolytes (e.g . diuretics) should be 
monitored very closely for elec trolyte abnormalities as these can contribute to the risk of 
QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias 
• Herbal preparations and medications are not allowed throughout the study.  These herbal 
medications include, but are not limited to: St. John’s wart, Kava, ephedra (ma huang), 
gingko biloba, dephydroepi[INVESTIGATOR_539365] (DHEA), yohimbe, saw palmetto, gingseng. Participants should stop using any herbal medi cations [ADDRESS_702993] dose of study 
drug. 
• Corticosteroids should be used in the smallest possible dose to control symptoms or 
cerebral edema and mass effect, and discontinued if possible. 
• Anti-seizure medications should be used as indicated. Only participants receiving non- 
enzyme-inducing anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_006] (EIAED) are eligible.  If for unavoidable clinical 
reasons (emergency department visit, severe alle rgies, toxicities, etc) a participant’s AED 
is switched to another AED, the following guideless must be followed: 
o Participants should be started on anot her non-EIAED if at all possible  
o Participants who are inadvertently and temporarily changed to an EIAED should  
be immediately changed to an alternative non-EIAED 
o Participants who need to permanently change anticonvulsant, but who cannot 
change to another non-EIAED must be discussed with the Principal Investigator. 
• Febrile neutropenia may be managed according to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer 
Center guidelines.  Measures include appropr iate laboratory testing, including blood and 
urine cultures and the institution of broad-spectrum antibiotics. If a source for the fever is 
not identified or the fever resolves when the neutrophil count recovers, antibiotics will be 
discontinued and the participant observed. 
• Routine prophylactic use of G-CSF is not permitted.  However, therapeutic use in 
participants with serious neutropenic complicat ions, such as sepsis, may be considered 
at the investigator’s discretion.

IRB#: 14-177 A(5)
Amended:08/25/15 
Page 13of 58 
 • The use of antiemetics will be left to the investigators’ discretion. The preferred 
antiemetic is metoclopramide, which is not known to prolong the QT interval. 
• Since some patients with CNS lymphoma are at increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_539366] (PJP), espec ially if they are on corticosteroids, 
prophylaxis for PJP may be considered. 
• Participants who develop diabetes mellitus du ring the study should be treated according 
to the American Diabetes Association guidelines. It is recommended to start treatment 
with metformin in the outpatient setting and sliding scale insulin in the inpatient setting. 
• Because of the potential for its interaction with study medications, warfarin sodium 
(Coumadin), or any other Coumadin-derived ant icoagulant is not permitted at any dose. 
Low-molecular weight heparin is permit ted. If for unavoidable clinical reasons 
(emergency department visit, severe allergy, toxicity, etc) a participant is started on Coumadin, they must change to a low molecular weight heparin immediately in the interest of subject safety. 
• Hormonal contraceptives may be affected by [CONTACT_9058] P450 interactions, and are 
therefore not considered effective birth control for this study.  In addition, hormonal 
contraceptives may also decrease the met abolic clearance of  buparlisib via CYP3A4 
inhibition. 
• No other anticancer therapy of any kind is permitted during the study treatment period. 
No other drug under investigation may be used concomitantly with the study drug. 
• Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_264271]-being of the participant may be given at the 
discretion of the investigator.  Other concomitant medications should be avoided except 
for analgesics, chronic treatments for concomitant medication conditions, or agents 
required for life-threatening medical problems.  All concomitant medications must be recorded.

6.3 Pregnancy and Reproduction  
 
 
 
6.3.1 Women: 
 
• Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they 
have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate 
clinical profile (i.e. age appropriate, hist ory of vasomotor symptoms) or six months 
of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels >40 mIU/mL and estradiol < 
20 pg/mL or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with our without 
hysterectomy at least six weeks prior to enrollment in the study.  In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by [CONTACT_539397]. 
• Women of child-bearing potential, defined as  all women physiologically capable of 
becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during study 
treatment and for 16 weeks after study discontinuation.  Highly effective contraception is defined as either 
o True abstinence: When this is the line with the preferred and usual lifestyle 
of the subject.  Periodic absti nence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not 
acceptable methods of contraception 
o Sterilization: Surgical bilateral oophorectomy, with or without 
hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks prior to study enrollment. 
In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of 
the woman has been confirmed by [CONTACT_104]. 
o Male partner sterilization (with appro priate post-vasectomy documentation 
of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate).  For female patients 
participating in the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the 
sole partner for that patient. 
o Use of a combination of any two of the following: 
 Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system 
(IUS) 
 Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or occlusive cap 
(diaphragm or cervical vault caps) with spermicidal 
form/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository 
 
NOTE: Oral contraception as well as injected, implanted, or local hormonal 
methods of contraception are not acceptable methods of contraception for women of child bearing potential as buparlisib potentially  decreases the 
effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives 
 
• Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at 
screening

 • In addition to having a negative pregnancy test confirmed at screening, all female 
participants of child bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test 
confirmed within 48 hours prior to dosing with the study drug. 
 
6.3.2 Men:  
 
• Fertile males, defined as all male subjec ts physiologically capable of conceiving 
offspring, must use a condom during study  treatment and for 16 weeks after study 
discontinuation and should not father a child in this period 
• Female partner of a male study subject should use a highly effective method of 
contraception while the male partner is receiving the study agent and for 16 weeks after the final dose of the study therapy

9.0 TREATMENT/ INTERVENTION PLAN  
 
All participant will initiate treatment at [ADDRESS_703005] the participant to take the study drug exactly as specified in the 
protocol. Buparlisib will be adm inistered on a continuous once daily schedule. Patients will be 
asked to keep a pi[INVESTIGATOR_69642]. Treatment will continue until one of the events in Section 13 
occurs. 
 
9.1 Dose Modifications/Delays  
 
For participants who are unable to tolerate the protocol-specified dosing schedule, dose 
adjustments are permitted in order to keep the participant on study drug.  If administration of 
buparlisib must be interrupted because of unacceptable toxicity, drug dosing will be interrupted or modified according to the rule s described in Table 11.  Any planned variance 
from these guidelines in the view of patient  safety must be previously discussed with the 
sponsor unless there is an urgent need for action. Any changes in buparlisib administration must be recorded in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_69642]. 
 
All dose modifications, interruptions, or discontinuations must be based on the worse 
preceding toxicity as graded using the CTEP Version 4.0 of the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), which can be found on the website at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . In the case of 
toxicity, appropriate medical treatment should be used, including anti-emetics, anti- 
diarrheals, etc. 
 
All adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_539398]. Part icipants continuing to 
experience toxicity at the end of treatmen t visits may be contact[CONTACT_163891]. 
 
All participants will be initially treated at Do se Level 0. A buparlisib dose reduction will be 
administered at 20 mg below the current dose. The dose reduction steps are outlined in Table 5.

10.2 Pharmacokinetic analysis and evaluation of study drug penetration into the CSF  
space 
 
In phase I clinical trials with buparlisib, preliminary PK data showed that buparlisib 
accumulated ~3 fold in achieving steady state, consistent with an effective half-life of ~ [ADDRESS_703011] plasma collection in parallel (patients with Ommaya reservoir: plasma collection at 1h, 2h, and 4h post drug administration; patients without Ommaya reservoir: plasma collection at 2h post drug administration. Each draw shoul d be collected at +/- 30 min of each time point. 
CSF and plasma concentrations of the drug w ill be measured by [CONTACT_539400] a CSF/plasma concentration. Samples will be stored in the Mellinghoff laboratory and analyzed at the end of the study. 
 
10.3 End of treatment visit, including premature withdrawal and study safety 
follow up  
All patients who discontinue study treatment, including those who refuse to return 
for a final visit, will be contact[CONTACT_530094] (i.e., assessment of AEs 
and/or SAEs, concomitant medications) [ADDRESS_703012] the patient should be documented in the source documents (e.g., dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc.). 
 
 
10.4 Patient self-rating mood questionnaires  
The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 
(GAD-7) will be collected to screen patients for the study and to aid in the 
identification and severity assessment of potential mood alterations. The PHQ-9 and GAD-7 are validated (Kroenke 2001, Spi[INVESTIGATOR_626] 2006, Spi[INVESTIGATOR_626] 1999), patient self- administered questionnaires developed for use in clinical practices.

collection on day-1 or within the screening, then on day 15 of cycle 1 and day 1 
and 15 of cycle 2 and on day 1 of  subsequent cycles, as well as at  end of treatment.  Additional assessments may be done according to the clinical judgment 
of the investigator. All questionnaires should be administered in the patient’s local 
language at the beginning of the study visi t prior to any interaction with the study 
investigator including any tests, treatments or receipt of results from any tests to avoid biasing the patient’s perspective. This  is to avoid potentially biasing patients 
or their responses to study questionnaires. 
Patients should be given sufficient space and time to complete all study 
questionnaires and all administered questionnaires should be reviewed for completeness. If missing responses are noted, patients should be encouraged to 
complete any missing responses. Attempts should be made to collect responses to all questionnaires for all patients, includi ng from those who discontinue prior to the 
study evaluation completion visit, however, if patients refuse to complete questionnaires, this should be documented in study source records. 
Completed questionnaires, including both responses to the questions and any 
unsolicited comments written by [CONTACT_102], must be reviewed and assessed by [CONTACT_539402]. This review should be documented in study source records. 
If an AE or SAE is confirmed then the physician should record the event as 
instructed in section “safety monitoring and reporting” of this guidance document. 
The severity classification table described in Table 7 for the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 will be used in this study to increase the sensitivity of identifying potential anxiety and/or depression disorders. During the study, questionnaire scores and 
corresponding  severity  classification  can  be  used  to  aid  the  investigator  in 
identifying new or worsening of events. Importantly, grading must be based on the 
clinical interpretation of severity according to the NCI-CTCAE (v 4.03).

blood collection (See 10.5.5). DNA extraction, quantification, and quality control will be performed according to established protocols in the Mellinghoff laboratory. Through target sequencing using the Miseq technology (performed at the MSKCC Geoffrey Beene Translational Oncology facility) mutational abnormalities including 
but not limited to CD79a, CD79b, PIK3Ca, PIK2CB, PIK3CD, MYD88, CARD11, 
and TNFAIP2 will be assessed and correlated with response to study drug treatment. 
10.5.3 Correlation of MR spectroscopy changes to buparlisib as a potential biomarker  
 
Research on cancer metabolism has iden tified a link between deregulated signaling 
pathways and altered cellular metabolism. Thes e changes in cancer cell metabolism can be 
measured by [CONTACT_156539] (MRS) and might serve as a possible 
biomarker of therapeutic effect. Using 1H MRS in orthotopic glioblastoma models, Koul et al 
(2010) have demonstrated that inhibition of the PI3K pathway results in a decrease in total 
choline-containing metabolite levels, composed of choline, phosphocholine, and 
glycerophosphocholine. Therefore 1H MRS could be used as a powerful tool to probe the 
change in cellular metabolism before and after initiation of study drug. 
 
10.5.4 Correlation of ADC/DWI/perfusion MRI imaging to changes to buparlisib  
Amended:08/25/15

IRB#: 14-177 A(5) 
 ADC signal on MRI is inversely correlated with cell density in PCNSL. Therefore a high ADC 
correlates with a low cell number and was associated with better outcome (Barajas, 2009). 
We want to further investigate MRI changes in ADC, DWI, and perfusion imaging in response to study drug and PI3K pathway inhibition and plan to correlate MR imaging changes with 
clinical outcome. 
 
10.5.5 Germline DNA collection  
Whole blood will be collected on cycle 1 day 15 (+/- 4 days). Blood will be collected in an K2EDTA containing blood collection tube (lavender top tube). Blood will be stored in the Mellinghoff lab prior to DNA isolation.

11.3 Management of Pneumonitis in patients receiving Buparlisib  
All patients participating in clinical trials with buparlisib will be routinely asked about 
and observed for the occurrence of adverse events which could include new or 
changed pulmonary symptoms (consistent with lung abnormalities). Additionally, 
chest X-rays will be performed every other cycle to further assess the development 
of  pneumonitis.  CT  scans  and  pulmonary  function  tests  should  be  done,  as clinically indicated, or if there are symptoms that indicate that the patient has 
developed pneumonitis. In case of a documented pneumonitis, the guidelines

Evaluation for herpes virus or fungal infection should be considered. 
Patients should be informed about the possibili ty of developi[INVESTIGATOR_235968]/ oral 
mucositis and instructed to report prom ptly any signs or symptoms to their 
physician, Patients should be educated about good oral hygiene, instructed to 
avoid spi[INVESTIGATOR_70329]/acidic/salty foods, and should follow the following guidelines: 
• For mild toxicity (grade 1), use conservative measures such as non-alcoholic 
mouth wash or salt water (0.9%) mouth wash several times a day until resolution.

butyl aminobenzoate, tetracaine hydroc hloride, menthol, or phenol) with or 
without topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930], such as triamcinolone oral paste 0.1% (Kenalog 
in Orabase®), or as per local practice. 
• Agents containing alcohol, hydrogen perox ide, iodine, and thyme derivatives 
may tend to worsen mouth ulcers. It is preferable to avoid these agents. 
Antifungal agents should be avoided unless a fungal infection is diagnosed as they 
may interfere with buparlisib metabolism. 
 
 
11.6 Guidelines for the treatment of buparlisib induced diarrhea  
The investigator should consider/investigate potential concomitant medication, food 
or comorbidity driven causes of diarrhea (including infectious causes) and remedy 
these causes if possible (e .g. discontinuation of concom itant medication, dietary 
modification, treatment of comorbidity). 
The patient should be monitored for signs of dehydration and instructed to take 
preventive measures against dehydration as soon as diarrhea occurs. Concomitant 
medication for the treatment of diarrhea should be considered, as per local practice and best investigator’s judgment and may consist for example, as per “the recommended guidelines for the treatment of cancer treatment-induced diarrhea” (Benson 2004), of loperamide given at a standard dose (e.g. initial administration of 
4mg, then 2mg every 4 hours, maximum of 16 mg/day), along with oral hydration 
and dietetic measures could be consider ed for Grade 1-2 diarrhea. More severe 
diarrhea  should  be  treated  appropriately  according  to  investigator  discretion, 
including for example IV fluids. 
Dose adaptations of buparlisib in case of treatment related diarrhea should follow 
the guidelines presented above for other non-hematological adverse events. 
 
 
11.7 Guidelines for the treatment of buparlisib induced psychiatric disorders 
Psychiatric  adverse  events  will  be  closely  monitored  and  evaluated  at  each 
planned  visit  until  recovery  to  Grade  ≤  1  or  baseline  status.  The  grading  of 
psychiatric  adverse  events/mood  alterations  must  be  based  on  the  clinical 
interpretation of severity according to the NCI- CTCAE (v 4.03) guidelines. 
For patients who experience new or worseni ng of existing psychiatric AEs of Grade 
≥1, psychiatric consultation should be considered as described in Table 11. 
Patient self-reported mood questionnaires (GAD-7 and PHQ-9) will be used for 
screening and during the study treatment phase to aid the investigator in identifying new or worsening of events. For additional information regarding safety assessments based on patient self-reported mood questionnaires, please refer to Section Patient self-rating mood questionnaires. 
If question 9 in the PHQ-9 has a positive response (as indicated by [CONTACT_20683] "1", 
"2", or "3"), omit treatment with buparlisib and refer the patient for psychiatric 
consultation for optimal management regard less of the total questionnaire score or 
CTCAE grading to confirm if study drug should be interrupted or permanently 
discontinued. In this specific case, the ps ychiatric advice can overrule the patient’s 
PHQ-9 self-assessment. During the study, subjects will be monitored at regular scheduled visits (e.g., Day 15 of Cycle 1, Day 1 and Day 15 of each subsequent cycle, and at the End of Treatment visit) by [CONTACT_093]/site staff through 
personal interaction and the two self-reported questionnaires. Additional 
assessments may be done according to the clinical judgment of the investigator if desired.

In general, the use of any concomitant medication/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_539373] (see Section Permitted concomitant therapy), except as specifically prohibited (see Section Prohibited concomitant therapy). 
All medications (excluding study treatment and prior antineoplastic treatments), 
procedures  and  significant  non-drug  therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014]  (including  phy sical  therapy  and

medications, but also all over-the count er medications, herbal medications 
(prohibited, see Section below) and food or vitamin supplements. The investigator 
should instruct the patient to notify the investigational site about any new medications she takes after the start of the study drug. 
The  patient  must  be  told  to  notify  the  investigational  site  about  any  new 
medications he/she takes after the start of the study drug. All medications (other than study drug) and significant non-drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including physical therapy and blood   transfusions)   administ ered  during  the  study  must  be  listed   on  the 
Concomitant Medications Sheet.

11.10.2 Drugs that are metabolized by [CONTACT_097]450 enzymes  
In vitro metabolism studies performed to examine the reversible and metabolism- 
dependent inhibition of CYPP450 enzymes showed that buparlisib is a weak, 
reversible inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CPY2C19. Note that with the data available, it is not possible to co nfirm whether such interactions will occur 
in patients. Therefore, investigators, at their discretion, may administer concomitant 
medications known to be metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4/5, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and 
CYP2C19. Patients receiving such medica tions must be monitored for potentiation 
of toxicity due to any individual conc omitant medications, and may require dose 
titration or reduction of the drug substrate.

 Refer  to  Appendix  2:  List  of  CYP450  substrates  to  be  used  with  caution. 
Particularly, caution is advised when buparlis ib is co-administered with drugs that 
are sensitive substrates and/or have a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., SSRI). 
Concomitant treatment of buparlisib with weak or moderate inducers of CYP3A4 is 
permitted, however, duration of concomitant treatment should be kept as short as 
possible (e.g., less than 1 week), or fu lly avoided whenever possible. Note that 
coadministration of buparlisib with strong inducers is prohibited (see below).

11.10.7 Gastric protection agents 
Buparlisib is characterized by a pH-dependen t solubility. Medicinal products that 
alter the pH of the upper Gastro-Intestinal (GI) tract may alter the solubility of 
buparlisib and hence its bioavailability. Thes e agents include, but are not limited to, 
proton-pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole), H 2-antagonists (e.g., ranitidine) and 
antacids.  Buparlisib should be dosed in a staggered manner at least [ADDRESS_703067].

Prophylactic use of hematopoietic growth factors (e.g. erythropoietins, granulocyte 
colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and gr anulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating 
factor (GMCSF)) are not permitted. However, in the event of an emergency (e.g. 
acute myelosuppression with infection), a patient may be given hematopoietic growth factors according to the investigator’s judgment, and the sponsor should be 
notified as soon as possible. Subsequent se condary prevention use is permitted at 
investigator’s discretion.

may continue this treatment at the discretion of the investigator. 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Warfarin and coumarin derivatives  
Therapeutic doses of warfarin sodium or any other coumarin-derivative 
anticoagulants are not permitted. 
Buparlisib is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8 and 2C9, the major metabolizing enzyme 
of warfarin. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_539378], an increase of 40- 
50% of warfarin exposure is possible and fo r a drug like warfarin, this might be

Appendix [ADDRESS_703068] two weeks prior to starting study drug. 
If a patient is previously on a non-EIAED and needs to permanently change the 
anticonvulsant agent, but cannot change to another non-EIAED, the patient will be taken off buparlisib. 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Drugs with a known risk for Torsades de Pointes  
If a patient requires the concomitant use of any medication included in Appendix 3 
entitled “List of Prohibited QT prolonging drugs” (i.e., drugs that are generally 
accepted by [CONTACT_236054].org Advisory Board of the Arizona CERT to have a risk of 
causing Torsade de Pointes), study treatment must be delayed. Note that Appendix 
3 lists drugs with a known risk for Torsades de Pointes (TdP) as well as sensitive 
CYP3A substrates (with narrow therapeutic index) with a possible or conditional risk for TdP. Study treatment administration must be interrupted as long as the patient requires therapy with the QT prolonging agent. 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors and inducers  
In vitro metabolism studies suggest that oxidative metabolism of buparlisib is predominantly mediated by [CONTACT_097]3A4 and UG T1A4. Coadministration of buparlisib 
with strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers is predicted to respectively increase or decrease th e systemic exposure to buparlisib.

11.11 Liver Toxicity  
 
11.11.1 Liver Toxicity Findings  
A recent liver safety review across [COMPANY_001]-sponsored trials with BKM120 identified several potentially drug-induced liver toxicity (DILI) cases (e.g. AST/ALT 
>3.[ADDRESS_703071] and TBL >2.[ADDRESS_703072] of these cases occurred in the context of 
disease progression in terminally ill, advanced cancer patients and/or were 
confounded by [CONTACT_22714]. However, six of these DILI candidates were 
consistent with Hy’s law criteria (e.g . AST/ALT >3.0x ULN and TBL >2.0xULN in 
the absence of cholestasis and other ex planatory causes) with probable causal 
relationship to study treatment. Five of these cases were enrolled in study 
CBKM120F2302 in combination with fulvestrant, and one in combination with the 
investigational drug LDE225 (sonidegib). All patients have recovered upon treatment discontinuation except one patient  for whom no data is available since 
the patient refused to return for safety follow-up. 
 
Approximately 25 to 45% of patients treated with single agent BKM120 reported liver toxicity (all grades, regardless of study drug relationship, 100 mg/d dose) based on a search of multiple MedDRA event terms (e.g. SMQ preferred terms). 
The incidence of grade 3 and 4 events was approximately 10 to 30%. Liver function 
test (LFT) alterations observed during ongoing and completed studies have been 
mostly transaminase enzyme increases (ALT and/or AST). Data suggest a slightly higher rate of grade 3 and 4 liver enzyme elevations in Japanese patients (44%) in the [CBKM120X1101] study, however, the number of patients treated at 100 mg in this study was limited (n=9). Transaminase elevations typi[INVESTIGATOR_539379] 6 to 8 weeks of treatment start. 
 
Although transaminase increases are relatively common, only a few of the patients 
had other simultaneous observations related to impaired liver function (e.g. bilirubin increase or clinical symptoms). 
 
Based on these findings, conservative inclus ion criteria and guidelines to monitor 
and follow patients with LFT altera tions (including dose and schedule 
modifications) have been implemented. Please refer to the respective 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and Table 11.0  in this protocol for more detailed 
guidelines.

 [IP_ADDRESS] Management of Hepatotoxicity (ALT and/or AST ≥ 3.0x ULN and 
total bilirubin ≥2.0x ULN) in patients receiving Buparlisib  
Criteria for interruption and re-initiation of buparlisib treatment in case of the 
occurrence of AST, ALT or bilirubin increase are detailed in Section 11.2, Toxicity 
Management (Table 11). 
 
Patients with clinically significant liver test abnormalities should perform liver- 
directed medical history, physical exam ination and other tests as medically 
indicated to assess potential relationship with study treatment and rule out other 
underlying causes (e.g. disease progression/obstruction, infection/hepatitis or other liver diseases, sepsis, metabolic di seases including diabetes, concomitant 
medications including her bals, alcohol, drug-drug interaction, cardiovascular 
disease/ischemia, other organ injuries, etc.). Any pre-existing liver conditions or 
risk factors should be reported in the res pective medical history and concomitant 
medication CRF pages (if not done already). 
 
All patients with ALT or AST >3.[ADDRESS_703073] and total bilirubin > 2.[ADDRESS_703074] in the 
absence of cholestasis (elevation of ALP in patients without bone metastasis or if bone metastasis are present elevation of 5’-nucleotidase and ALP liver fraction) 
must be immediately withdrawn from buparlisib, and every attempt should be made 
to carry out locally the liver event follow-up assessments as described below: 
• Inform the sponsor about the event immediately after its occurrence by 
[CONTACT_539404]. 
• Evaluate if associated with the appearance or worsening of clinical 
symptoms of hepatitis or hypersensitivity such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash or eosinophilia, or other 
organ involvement. 
• Obtain fractionated bilirubin, serum Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), creatine 
phosphokinase (CPK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and blood count with 
differential to assess eosinophilia. 
• Perform liver imaging (ultrasound, magnetic resonance, or computerized 
tomography) to evaluate liver disease including metastasis or new lesions, 
obstruction/compression, etc. 
• Perform viral hepatitis and other serology tests:: 
o Hepatitis C (HCV) serology and viral RNA, Hepatitis B (HBV) serology 
and viral DNA, Hepatitis A (HAV) Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and HAV 
total 
o Hepatitis E (HEV) serology: IgM and IgG, viral RNA 
o Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr  
viral (EBV) serology 
• Verify and record the use of concomitant medications, acetaminophen, 
herbal remedies, and other over the counter medications, or putative 
hepatotoxins, on the concomitant medications report form. 
• Consultation with a specialist(s) or a hepatologist(s) is recommended. 
• Liver biopsy as clinically indicat ed to assess pathological change and 
degree of potential liver injury 
• LFTs should be followed-up weekly until resolve to ≤ grade 1, baseline or

12.0 CRITERIA FOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
 
12.1 Definitions of response  
 
This study will use the Macdonald criteria (Macdonald, et al. 1990). Specific lesions must be 
evaluated serially, and comparative analysis of changes in the area of contrast 
enhancement, as well as the non-enhancing component, should be performed. As with the 
Macdonald criteria (Macdonald, et al. 1990), t he product of the maximal cross-sectional 
enhancing diameters will be used to determine the size of the contrast-enhancing lesions.

 a.  Measurable disease:  Measurable lesions are defined as enhancing lesions that can be 
accurately measured in at  least two dimensions ≥ 10mm. All tumor measurements must 
be reported in millimeters. 
b.  Non-measurable disease:  All other lesions (or sites of disease), includi ng small lesions 
(<10mm with conventional techniques) are considered non-measurable disease. 
c.   Cytologic Complete Response (CCR):  Complete clearing of all malignant cells from 
ventricular or lumbar source based on cytology. A cytologic CR must be documented by 
[CONTACT_539405] 4 weeks apart. 
 
12.2 Guidelines for evaluation of measurable disease  
 
1.  Complete Response (CR):  Complete disappearance of all measurable and non- 
measurable disease. No new lesions. Al l measurable and non-measurable lesions 
and sites must be assessed using the same techniques as baseline. Patients must be 
on no steroids. 
2.  Partial Response (PR):  Greater than or equal to 50% decrease over the baseline in 
the sum of products of perpendicular di ameters of all measurable lesions. No 
progression of non-measurable disease. No  new lesions. All measurable and non- 
measurable lesions and sites must be a ssessed using the same techniques as 
baseline. The steroid dose at the time of the scan evaluation should be no greater 
than the maximum dose used in the first 8 weeks from initiation of therapy. 
3.  Stable/no response:  Does not qualify for CR, PR, or progression. All measurable and 
non-measurable sites must be assessed using the same techniques as baseline. The 
steroid dose at the time of the scan evaluation should be no greater than the 
maximum dose used in the first 8 weeks from initiation of therapy. 
4.  Progression:  25% increase in the sum of products of all measurable lesions over 
smallest sum observed (or baseline if no de crease) using the same techniques as 
baseline, OR clear worsening of any non-m easurable disease, OR appearance of any 
new lesion/site, OR clear clinical worsening or failure to return for evaluation due to 
death or deteriorating condition (unless clearly unrelated to this cancer).  
 
12.3 Guidelines for patients with CSF disease  
 
1.  Complete Response (CR):  Combination of CCR and complete disappearance of all 
measurable and non-measurable diseas e (if the participant had imaging 
abnormalities at enrollment). No new le sions. All measurable and non-measurable 
lesions and sites must be assessed using the same techniques as baseline. Patients 
must be on no steroids. 
2.  Partial Response (PR):  Combination of CCR and stabl e size of all measurable and 
non-measurable disease (if the participant had imaging abnormalities at enrollment). 
No new lesions. All measurable and non -measurable lesions and sites must be 
assessed using the same techniques as baseline. Patients should be on a stable or reduced does of steroids. 
3.  Stable/no response:
 Tumor cells still present in CSF cytology and stable size of all 
measurable and non-measurable diseas e (if the participant had imaging

lesions over smallest sum observed (or baseline if no decrease) using the same 
techniques as baseline, OR clear worsening of any non-measurable disease, OR appearance of any new lesion/site on imaging, OR clear clinical worsening or failure 
to return for evaluation due to death or deteriorating condition (unless clearly 
unrelated to this cancer) regardless of CSF cytology status.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_703076] response and objective response rate (ORR)  
 
For patients with all disease sites assessed every evaluation period, the best response 
will be defined as the best objective status as measured according to section 12.2/12.3. If 
the response does not persist at the next regular scheduled MRI/CT, the response will 
still be recorded based on the prior scan, but will be designated as a non-sustained response. If the response is sustained, e.g. still present on the subsequent MRI/CT, it will 
be recorded as a sustained response, lasting until the time of tumor progression. 
 
The objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the portion of patients with a best 
response of CR plus PR according to section 12.2/12.3divided by [CONTACT_539406]. 
 
12.5 Neurological exam 
 
Although not used for determining response, it is useful to evaluate changes in the 
neurological exam compared to the previous exam. The following scale may be used: 
 
+2 Definitely better 
 
+1 Possibly better 
 
0 Unchanged 
 
-1 Possibly worse 
 
-2 Definitely worse 
 
Additionally the participant will be eval uated for neurologic functioning by [CONTACT_539407] (). Assessments will be performed at 
baseline and will each treatment response assessment (every MRI visit). The NANO is an objective, quick, user-friendly and quantifiable evaluation of nine major domains for subjects with brain tumors. The domains include: gait, strength, ataxia, sensation, 
visual field, facial strength, language, level of consciousness, behavior and overall. 
Each domain is rated on a scale of [ADDRESS_703077] severity. A given domain should be scored non-evaluable if it 
cannot be accurately assessed due to pre-existing conditions, co-morbid events and/or concurrent medications. The evaluation is based on direct observation/testing 
performed during routine office visits. The NANO scale will be completed by [CONTACT_539408] 1 cycle 1 (baseline) and then with each MRI). 
 
 
 
12.6 Performance status  
 
Participants will be graded according to Karnofsky Performance Status Scale (KPS) 
(Appendix 6).

 12.7 Overall survival time (OS)  
 
Overall survival time (OS) is defined as the time from treatment start to the date of 
death due to any cause. Patients not known to have died will be censored at the time of their last available assessment or at the analysis cut-off whichever comes earlier. 
 
OS will be described using Kaplan-Meier curves with appropriate summary statistics. 
 
12.8 Progression-free survival (PFS)  
 
Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of treatment start 
to the date of the first documented PD or death due to any cause. If a patient is not known to have progressed or died at the date of the analysis cut-off or when he/she receives any further anti-cancer therapy, PFS is censored at the time of the last tumor assessment before the cut-off date and before the anti-cancer therapy date. PFS will 
be based on the investigator’s assessment of MRI, CSF studies and clinical 
presentation. 
 
PFS will be described using Kaplan-Meier curves with appropriate summary statistics. 
Additionally, we will report PFS at 12 weeks (PFS12w), PFS at 24 weeks (PFS24w) and at 48 weeks (PFS48w). 
 
12.[ADDRESS_703078] progressed or died at the date of the analysis cut-off or when he/she receives any further anti-cancer t herapy, duration of response is censored at 
the time of the last tumor assessment before the cut-off date and before the anti- cancer therapy date. 
 
Duration of response will be described using Kaplan-Meier curves with appropriate 
summary statistics. 
 
 
13.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY  
 
Duration of therapy will depend on individual response, evidence of disease progression and 
tolerance. The absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue until one of the following criteria applies: 
 
• Disease progression 
• Intercurrent illness that prevent further administration of treatment 
• Unacceptable adverse event(s) 
• Participant decides to withdraw from the study 
• General or specific changes in the participant’s condition render the participant 
unacceptable for further treatment in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_80021]. 
 
The participant will be removed from study treatment when any one of the criteria listed above 
applies. The reason for study treatment removal and the date the participant was removed must be documented in the study-specific case report form. Alternative care options will be discussed with the participant. 
 
In the event of unusual or life-threatening complications, investigators must immediately notify the Principal Investigator.

PFS6m of 35-45% with conventional chemotherapy regimens. The primary objective of this phase II study is to assess the efficacy of the targeted therapy buparlisib. PFS24w rate of patients receiving buparlisib will be estimat ed along with a 95% confidence interval. 
Progression-free survival at 24 weeks (PFS24w) is defined as the percentage of patients that have not developed progression of disease or died without progression at 24 weeks from the start of treatment.  All patients will be followed for 6 months. 
 
Twenty-one patients will be entered in this trial with an anticipated accrual rate of 1- 
2/months. The therapy will be considered worth pursuing if ≥12 out of 21 participants are 
progression free at 6 months (lower bound of the 95% confidence interval exceeds 34%, the 
approximate PFS24w rate with conventional chemotherapy). 
 
Based on an accrual of 21 participants, two- sided 95% binominal conf idence intervals for a 
range of overall response rate are as follows: 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
Table 14: Two-sided 95% binominal confidence intervals

 upper 52.18% 61.56% 70.22% 78.18% 85.41% 91.78%
 
 
In the unlikely event a patient is lost to foll ow-up before assessment of the primary endpoint 
he or she will be considered an event in the analysis of the primary endpoint. 
 
In addition to PFS24w, we will assess progression-free survival at 12 weeks and 48 weeks 
(PFS12w and PFS48w). PFS12w/PFS48w is defined as the percentage of patients that have not developed progression of disease or died wit hout progression at 3/12 months from the 
start of treatment. PFS12w and PFS48w rates of patients receiving buparlisib will be estimated along with a 95% confidence inte rval. The PFS12w will be assessed based on the

 imaging and/or CSF assessment at day 1 cycle 3. PFS24w will be based on the imaging 
and/or CSF assessment at day 1 cycle 6, and PFS48w on imaging and/or CSF assessment at day 1 cycle 12. 
 
Frequencies of toxicities will be summarized based on the Common Toxicity Criteria version 
4.0.  Adverse events that occur will be reported for and described in terms of incidence and severity.  Objective response rate (defined as proportion of patients who achieve a complete and partial response among all patients) will be estimated along with a 95% confidence 
interval. For patients who respond to treatment (complete or partial response), duration of 
response will be calculated from the date of response to the date of progression of disease. Patients still responding at date of last follow-up will be censored.  Overall survival will be 
calculated as the time from the start of treatment to the date of death or last follow-up. Overall survival and duration of response will  be calculated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. 
 
Pharmacokinetic parameters including half-life, C max, AUC, volume of distribution, and 
clearance will be determined using non-compartmental methods via WinNonlin (Pharsight, 
Mountain  View,  CA).  Standard  descriptive  statistics  (mean,  standard deviation,  median, 
range) will be presented on all parameters for both serum and CSF samples. 
 
 
Mutational abnormalities (mutant or not) will be assessed for the following genes: A20, 
CARD11, CD79B, PIK3CA, PIK3CD and MYD88. Additionally, the phosphorylation status of the following members of the PI3K pathway will be assess through immunohistochemical 
staining (activated or not activated). Both, mutational abnormalities as well as 
immunohistochemical status will be cross tabulated with patient outcomes such as PFS24w and ORR.  Associations will be assessed using Fishers exact test.  For patients who receive MR spectroscopy peak values will be descr ibed and graphically presented through course of 
treatment. Perfusion data (ADC value categorized as high versus low) will be correlated with patient outcome if data permit. 
 
The evaluation of NANO will be measured by [CONTACT_539409]. 
 
It is anticipated that 1-2 patients per month will be accrued to this study and the study will be 
completed within 2 years. Accrual is limited to 10 patients with SCNSL and 11 patients with PCNSL.

Appendix 5: Patient Self-Reported Mood Questionnaires  
 
 
Scoring the PHQ-9 and GAD-7  
Calculating the Total Score for the PHQ-9  
Total scores from the PHQ-9 will be calculated to assess depression severity according to 
the  developer’s  guidelines  (Instruction  Ma nual:  Instructions  for  Patient  Health 
Questionnaire (PHQ) and GAD-7 Measures. Accessed on 2010 Sept 9 from: www.phqscreeners.com). This is calculated by [CONTACT_135480] 0, 1, 2, and 3, to the 
response categories of “not at all,” “sever al days,” “more than half the days,” and “nearly 
every day,” respectively. PHQ-9 total score for the nine items ranges from 0 to 27. 
PHQ-9 Scoring Example: 
In the example below, the Total Score for the PHQ-9 depression severity is 8, where the 
score is the sum of four items scored “0” (questions: #3, 7, 8, 9), three items scored “1” 
(questions:  #1,  4,  6),  one  item  scored  “2”  (question:  #2),  and  one  item  scored  “3” (question: #5).

Calculating the Total Score for the GAD-7 
Similar to the PHQ-9, scores for the GAD-7 will calculated to assess anxiety severity 
according to the developer’s guidelines (1). This  is calculated by [CONTACT_135480] 0, 1, 
2, and 3, to the response categories of “not at all,” “several days,” “more than half the 
days,” and “nearly every day,” respectively. A total score for the GAD-7 can range from 0 
to 21. 
GAD-7 Scoring Example: 
In the example below, the Total Score for the GAD-7 anxiety severity is 9, where the score 
is the sum of two items scored “0” (questions: #6, 7), two items scored “1” (questions: #2, 
3), two items scored “2” (questions: #1, 5), and one item scored “3” (question: #4).

Introduction 
 
Background & Rationale  
 
"Normal" aging is associated with declines in learning and memory, such as losing or misplacing personal items, a complaint often reported by  [CONTACT_891505] s. These complaints parallel neurological 
changes that occur in late- life; for example, the specific complaint of misplacing household items, 
known as a failure in object location association (OLA) memory, relies on several brain regions , 
including frontal, parietal, and medial temporal regions, that work together to bind object and location 
information into long-term memory  (Postma et al., 2008; Gillis et al., 2016 ; Hampstead et al., 2016).  
We previously demonstrated overlap in the same frontopar ietal regions involved in OLA memory and 
working memory (Gillis et al., 2016). The current pi[INVESTIGATOR_891491] a single session of 
High Definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD -tDCS) affected performance on one, or 
both, of the se cognitive abilities.   
 HD-tDCS modulates neuronal excitability and is generally considered safe and well tolerated. This 
method offers improved focality relative to the standard pad- based approach to tDCS  (Edwards et al., 
2013; Datta et al., 2009).  Our recent safety review revealed that about 96% of tDCS sessions used 
some variant of 1 or 2 milliamp (mA ; Bikson et al., 2016). The arbitrary cap at 2 mA has no theoretical 
or empi[INVESTIGATOR_891492] , since available evidence suggests a current intensity of 167 mA (or greater) 
would be needed to induce tissue damage. Thus, the current pi[INVESTIGATOR_570783] a  current intensity of 
3 mA in order to evaluate the effects on cognition while also evaluating tolerability and safety of this 
under investigated dosage.  
 tDCS Safety Considerations.  According to a review encompassing tDCS studies conducted through 
2016, tDCS is a safe intervention with no reported cases of severe or unexpected adverse events, tissue damage, or irreversible brain injury in over 33,200 conventional sessions (duration ≤ 40 minutes, current ≤ 4 mA; Bikson et al., 2016).  Furthermore, no serious adverse events have been reported in ‘vulnerable’ populations, including children, older adults, and individuals with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], stroke history, or impla nted devices (Bikson et al., 2016). There is little evidence to indicate that 
higher dosage of intensity or duration is unsafe (Bikson et al., 2016) .  
 Assuming that an absence of a reported event in a study equates to no event occurring, 56% of published tDCS studies report any type of adverse event /effect (Brunoni et al., 2011). The few side 
effects reported by [CONTACT_891506], tingling, headache, burning, or discomfort at the 
electrode placement site on the scalp (Brunoni et al., 2011). This study will use the standardized side 
effect questionnaire provided by [CONTACT_245198] (2011) to evaluate such sensations . 
 
Objectives & Hypotheses  of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_891493] 1: To a ssess the efficacy of HD-tDCS on OLA  memory and working memory in 
cognitively intact older adults. The study will randomize participants to active or sham HD -tDCS 
and apply 3 mA over the lateral prefrontal cortex , given this area’s role in both OLA and working 
memory  tasks (Gillis et al., 2016) . We predict improved performance on both tasks in those receiving 
active relative to sham HD -tDCS. While we will perform statistical contrasts, particular attention will be 
paid to measures of effect size given the preliminary nature of the study . 
 Objective’ 2: To e valuate tolerabi lity and blinding of tDCS at [ADDRESS_1248242] older adults. Establishing such data will fill key knowledge gaps in our understanding of such 
information at current intensities above 2mA. Based on available evidence (Bikson et al., 2016; 
ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT 03034954  5 
Brunoni et al., 2011), we predict comparable side effect profiles between activ e and sham and that 
the groups will be no different in determining stimulation status (i.e., active vs. sham).  
 
Trial Design  
The study uses a randomized, sham -controlled, double- blind parallel groups design. All participants 
will be randomized to receive 20 minutes of active or sham stimulation. Sham consists of a 30-second 
‘ramp -up’ period to [ADDRESS_1248243] and 
final minute of the session. Participants will not be told to which group they were as signed. Two study 
staff ( ARF & JR) will conduct the stimulation and behavioral outcome/tolerability, safety, and blinding 
measures separately to maintain examiner blinding. For more information regarding design, see 
Methods  section. 
 
Methods: Participants,  Interventions, & Outcomes  
 
Power Analysis 
We conducted an a priori  power analysis  for two-tailed mean comparisons between Active and Sham 
participants on OLA and working memory measures (see Measures section below) , based on the 
estimated effect size  from a meta- analysis of single -session anodal tDCS to the dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of healthy adults  (Hedges g = 0.254  for sham vs. tDCS accuracy effects; 
Brunoni and Vanderhasselt., 2014). At a power level of 0.80, the required sample size to achieve an 
effect size of 0.25 was 10 participants per group; therefore, we will recruit at least 30 total participants 
(15 per group)  to ensure adequate power.  
 
Participants  
Participants will include [ADDRESS_1248244], community -dwelling older adults , age 50+.  
Participants will b e recruited from the University of Michigan Neuropsychology Clinic, the Michigan 
Alzheimer’s Disease Center, the University of Michigan Health Research Registry  and the 
surrounding community.  All study -related activities will occur at the University of Mic higan.  
 Inclusion Criteria  
 Those participants who have recently undergone testing demonstrating no significant cognitive impairments ( Mini-Mental Status Exam [ MMSE] score > [ADDRESS_1248245] six months) will be accepted 
into the study. For potential participants without recent cognitive testing,  we will perform the MMSE  
following informed consent in order to establish cognitive status. All participants are also screened to 
ensure that they meet criteria to participate. All participants received $10 for participation in the study . 
 Exclusion Criteria  
General exclusion criteria include a history of traumatic brain injury (by [CONTACT_891507]), diagnosed neurologic disease (including Parkinson’s disease, dementia, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] , 
multiple sclerosis, o r tumor ), severe mental illness  (e.g., bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, other 
psychotic disorder), substance use disorders, and cognition- impacting medications (anticonvulsants, 
antipsychotics, anxiolytics). Individuals with skull plates or other implants impacting tDCS current flow 
will not be enrolled in the study. Individuals with significant visual impairments that limit ability to see stimuli, or motor impairments that may interfere with ability to participate in the touchscreen task  will 
also be excluded. To ensure appropriate electrode- scalp contact [CONTACT_891508], participants with scalp dermatitis or limiting hair styles will be excluded. To clarify future interpretation of results, individuals with significant alcohol or recreational drug use or poor sleep within the 24- hours prior to the stimulation session will be excluded from the study . 
Individuals currently participating in other neuromodulation studies are not eligible to participate.  
 
ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT 03034954  6 
Recruitment Strategy  
 
Participants will be recruited from the University of Michigan Neuropsychology Clinic, the Michigan Alzheimer’s Disease Center, the University of Michigan Health Research registry , and the 
surrounding community.  Three methods will be used to identify potential participants. First, 
researchers  will engage in prospective recruitment for older adults who meet inclusion criteria. This 
will rely on provider referral in which the provider will 1) give the patient an approved flyer or 2) ask 
the patient if the provider may inform research staff of his or her interest via in- person contact, 
telephone, or UM email. Flyers will be posted within the clinic. Second, participants will be recruited through the University of Michigan Alzheimer’s Disease Center (MADC). The MADC recruits 
participants from  several sources including the MADC Memory Disorders clinic, community screening 
events, and external  referrals. Participants interested in research are maintained in an IRB -approved 
database (IRB# HUM00000382), which is available to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_245189].  Third, researchers 
will post an approved description of the study to the University of Michigan Health Research  registry, 
and contact [CONTACT_891509].  
 
Procedures  
Participants will complete a single, (roughly) two-hour-long session involving either active or sham 
stimulation and computerized cognitive tasks. All sessions will take place in the PI’s (Hampstead) 
laboratory at the University of Michigan. Individuals will receive $10 compensation for their 
participation in the study, paid via check after the session.   
 Randomization Randomization will use the sealed envelope method in which group assignment is placed in a sealed 
envelop (by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_891494] ) and then envelopes are shuffled and numbered. The study team member ( ARF) 
will open the envelope directly before the stimulation phase of the session, ensuring the other team 
members remain blinded, and provide the designated treatment condition. Only one team member will be in the room at this. The team member not overseei ng stimulation will return after the 20-
minutes have been completed and will administer the side effect questionnaire and the cognitive tests. For further clarification of timing of procedures and study team involvement, see Figure 1.   
 Interventions  
 HD-t DCS . Participants will undergo a single session of active or sham 4x1 high- definition 
transcranial direct current stimulation using a Soterix 1x1 TES device and attached 4x1 Multichannel 
Stimulation Adaptor. HD-AtDCS uses small gel- based electrodes (as opposed to conventional tDCS, 
which uses large, fluid- soaked sponge electrodes) to deliver a more localized current to specific brain 
regions. The montage is designated 4x1, as it utilizes a central electrode that defines the polarity of the stimulation (anodal in the current study), surrounded by [CONTACT_891510]. In order to target OLA memory, researchers will employ stimulation under the anode placed over the left lateral prefrontal cortex at the inferior frontal gyrus (F5 in the 10/20 International system). Participants undergoing active stimulation will receive 20 minutes of stimulation at 3 mA. Conversely, participants undergoing sham stimulation will receive a 10- second ramp- up, 30 -
second stimulation at 3 mA, and 10- second ramp- down, followed by [CONTACT_3450] 19 minutes 
without stimulation, and a second ramp- up/ramp -down period. These short periods of stimulation are 
completed for effective blinding of participants. Step -by-step procedures for HD -tDCS set -up and 
stimulation are detailed below under ‘Participant Timeline of Procedures’.  
 
Primary Outcomes  
 Object Location Touchscreen Task (OLTT; Hampstead et al., 2011; England et al., 2015).  
Participants will undergo the OLTT, an ecologically relevant  measure of object location association 
ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT [ADDRESS_1248246] -location 
associations. Memory is evaluated using a touchscreen monitor, which allows for the continuous 
measurement of memory accuracy (i.e., distance from targeted location).  
 N-Back Working Memory Tasks. The n- back is a well validated measure of working memory. 
Participants will complete the same n- back paradigm, which includes 0- back and 2- back conditions, 
as in our earlier study (Gillis et al., 2016). Additionally, a semantic [ADDRESS_1248247] 
questionnaire developed by [CONTACT_245198] (2011; see Figure 1) . We will delay examining  
the skin for redness until after the participant  has completed the condition estimate (see below) in 
order to avoid any potential bias  that could impact blinding . For further information on safety 
monitoring plan, see the ‘Methods: Monitoring’ section below.  
 Effectiveness of Blinding  
After completing the side-effect questionnaire, participants will be asked to state which stimulation 
condition they believed they received (referred to as “condition estimate” in this document; i.e., 
active/“real”, sham/“fake”, or “I don’t know”).   
 
Participant Timeline of Procedures  
1. Participants will complete an initial telephone screening prior to ensure basic eligibility. 
Participants who meet inclusion criteria will be scheduled for a two- hour appointment within 
approximately one week of initial screening (allowing for the participant’s schedule).  
2. During the study session, participants will firs t provide informed, written consent. Additional 
background and screening questions regarding medical history, acute sleep problems or alcohol use, and other eligibility criteria will be recorded. If not completed within the six months prior to the session,  an MMSE will be completed. If additional concerns remain regarding 
participant eligibility, study team members will confer with BMH . If a participant is deemed 
ineligible at this stage, he or she will still receive the financial compensation for participation, but will be dismissed.  
3. Eligible and enrolled participants will begin study procedures by [CONTACT_891511] (Version 
B).  
4. During the 15- minute break  between encoding and retrieval, two study team members will 
measure and mark the electrode locations on the participant’s head. A mesh cap will be placed over the participant’s scalp and plastic electrode holders placed over the marked locations. 
Hair will be moved out of the way of these electrode holders, exposing as much scalp as possible. Each holder will be filled wit h conductive gel and checked for air bubbles using a 
plastic syringe. Each electrode will be lowered into place using the syringe, and electrode holder caps will be secured into place to eliminate movement of the electrodes during stimu lation.  
5. Immediately following  electrode placement,  first i mpedance values will be checked as noted 
above.  During a 10- minute saturation period, participants will complete the OLTT Version B. 
These results will serve as a relative baseline against which post- stimulation OLTT measures 
are compared. Immediately following the end of the 10- minute saturation period, a second set 
of impedance readings will be taken. Electrode resistance or impedance readings of less than 
or equal to 2.[ADDRESS_1248248] 
ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT 03034954  8 
quality (Villamar et al., 2013); if any impedance reading exceeds this cut -off, examiners will 
repeat and check electrode placement as needed (moving additional hair away from the scalp, 
filling any air bubbles in gel) to reduce impedance to acceptable levels.  
6. At this time, one study team member ( JR) will leave the room to remain blinded to stimulation 
condition. The second study team member ( ARF) will open the next sealed, opaque 
randomization envelope (prepared in advance by [INVESTIGATOR_891494] ; see ‘Randomization’ ) to reveal the 
condition assignment, concealing  this information from the participant. The study team 
member (ARF) will make adjustments to the HD -tDCS unit to prepare for sham or active 
stimulation.  
7. The participant will then begin 20-minutes of the assigned active or sham stimulation. Exactly 
10 minutes after the beginning of stimulation, the participant will begin encoding trials of a 
novel version of the OLTT (Version C), as various studies have shown that online (during 
stimulation) encoding may produce more robust learning and memory effects. ARF will note 
the time at which encoding is  completed, beginning the 15- minute delay timer.  
8. Immediately after completion of stimulation, ARF will take a final, post- stimulation impedance 
reading. All HD- tDCS units will be turned to the default settings and removed from view.  
Electrodes and mesh netting will be left on to maintain blinding  of the participant and other staff 
members . 
9. In order to avoid the potential for biased behavior while recording outcomes and to maintain blinding, ARF will then exit the room; JR will return to complete outcome measurement.  
10. When the 15 -minute delay timer has expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697], the participant will be asked to complete the 
memory portion of the OLTT Version C, followed by [CONTACT_941] N -Back tasks, the side effects  
questionnaire, and finally the condition estimate. This sequence and timing of outcome 
measures is critical not only for blinding, but also to capi[INVESTIGATOR_891495] o f HD- tDCS  (drawn from Kuo et al., 2012) .

Methods: Data Management  & Analysis  
 
Data Management  & Entry  
 Only IRB approved study personnel will have access to study documents/data. Consent paperwork and any other identifying information provided by [CONTACT_891512]’s medical record according to IRB standards  and then stored in a binder, separate from all other study 
data.  Data are kept in a locked file cabinet within a private office in an office suite (i.e., behind two 
locked doors).  The participant’s study ID number will be recorded on every paper page of the study 
documents .  
 Separate databases containing participants’ stimulation condition and outcome data will be 
maintained until the study is complete and closed to enrollment, at which time investigators will break the blind and combine these databases. Earlier unblinding of the participant or investigators is not 
anticipated, and will only occur in the case of serious adverse events. All data will be entered within 48-hours of the participant’s visit, with ARF entering condition allocation data and JR entering 
outcome data. To maintain confidentiality of the electronic data, both databases will reside on secure 
University of Michigan servers, be password protected, and will only be accessible by [CONTACT_891513] .  
 
Statistical Design  
 Data Screening  
 

ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT [ADDRESS_1248250] udy (at random; no participant -related factors predicted 
this loss); investigators chose to expand the sample size by 15 participants in order to meet a priori 
sample sizes.  Additional screening for univariate and multivariate outliers, skewness and kurtosis will 
be conducted to inform needs for data transformation and statistical approach.  
 
Statistical Approach: Primary Outcomes To compare change in performance on the OLTT Version B (pre- stimulation) and C (post -stimulation) 
in the active and sham groups, repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used. Specific outcome variables of interest will include Free Recall and Cued Recall average accuracy (in cm) and average reaction time (in ms), Recognition accuracy (number correct), and average Recognition time (in ms).  
 To assess group differences in N -Back performance, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) 
was employed, comparing active and sham groups on discriminability (d’) . More specifically, d’ in the 
2-back and Semantic -Back condit ions was compared to d’ in the 0- back condition as a purer measure 
of working memory, eliminating the influence of basic processing speed.  
 Statistical Approach: Secondary Outcomes  To evaluate tolerability on the side effects questionnaire, the frequency  of each reported side effect  
will be evaluated as a function of stimulation condition (i.e., active or sham)  using  Fisher’s Exact 
Tests. Any severe adverse effects will be reported following established IRB protocols  (see Methods: 
Monitoring) . To evaluate blinding, chi-squared tests will be conducted to determine group differences 
in actual  condition assignment  vs. estimated /perceived condition.  
 
Methods: Monitoring 
A study team member will be present in the room with the participant for the entirety of stimulation. Stimulation will be paused should the participant report significant discomfort; additional gel will be added to improve contact [CONTACT_891514]. In the event of a participant request to discontinue stimulation, serious adverse event, or reporting of an unusual (i.e., not listed as a common side effect in the side effects questionnaire) or concerning (e.g., significant acute mood change) side effect, stimulation will be discontinued. This will be accomplished by [CONTACT_891515], which gradually ramps down stimulation until it is discontinued. This gradual but rapid reduction in stimulation is preferred to manually discontinuing stimulation by [CONTACT_891516], as it minimizes discomfort. Study staff will immediately alert the principal 
investigator ( BMH ) and medical assistance as needed.  
 
Participants will also complete the side effects questionnair e after stimulation has ended. Study team 
members will review all responses during and following each session and will immediately consult with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_891498]- to-severe ratings be reported. BMH has also established a relationship 
with a world- renow ned expert in TES, [CONTACT_32132] at the City University of [LOCATION_001], and will 
consult [CONTACT_891523] should any concerns arise.  
 Consistent with FDA and IRB guidelines, we will report severe unanticipated events associated with TES within 48- 72 hours to both organizations. We will seek guidance about whether to pause study 
enrollment/procedures at that time.

Ethics and Dissemination  
 
Research Ethics Approval  & Protocol Amendments  
This study -specific protocol falls under the larger Patient -Centered Neurorehabilitation (PCN) 
Study protocol. All procedures detailed above fall within the parameters approved by [CONTACT_891517] (UMIRB: IRBMED HUM00111090). Any changes to these parameters or procedures will be proposed to and approved by [CONTACT_891518].  
 
Consent or Assent  
 All consent forms and others requiring authorized signatures were approved by [CONTACT_891519] . A study team member will review the consent form, emphasizing the relevant aspects 
of the PCN study to be conducted during this sub- study. The team member will pause after each 
section to solicit and answer questions. Comprehension of the procedures, risks, benefits, and other aspects of the study will  be checked using a decision- making tool (a brief measure asking the 
participant to use his or her own words to review the contents of each section of the consent form before signing).  
 
Confidentiality  
Information gathered from individuals contact[CONTACT_891520] a recruitment database file that is stored in the shared drive (accessible only to select, approved lab personnel) and password protected. This centralized file will contain only the necessary information for contact[CONTACT_891521], as well as assigned ID numbers for enrolled 
participants . For information regarding security and confidentiality of data from enrolled participants, 
see ‘ Data Management & Entry ’.  
 Participants are aware prior to enrollment that they will not receive feedback regarding their 
performance on cognitive screening or outcome measures, nor information about their stimulation condition assignment. As mentioned above, a copy of the consent form is uploaded into the participant’s University of Michigan electronic medical record as a ‘Research Document’ to communicate current research participation to medical providers.  
 
Declaration of Interests 
 None of the study investigators have any financial or competing interes ts to declare.  
 
Access to Data 
 Study data will remain housed within the Hampstead laboratory at the University of Michigan and will 
only be available to authorized study team members or members of oversight committees (e.g., IRB).  
 
Ancillary and Post -Trial Care  
 As noted above, there are procedures in place to alert the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_891499]. As stated in 
the consent form, participants are instructed to seek immediate medical attention for any serious 
adverse events that arise after the study session, rather than waiting to contact [CONTACT_891522]. Participants are instructed that any medical appointments that are attended after the 
study will be billed through the patient’s regular insurance avenues.

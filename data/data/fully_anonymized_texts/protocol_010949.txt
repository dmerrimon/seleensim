The primary outcome will be the rate of awakening (defined as following commands) during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].    4.2 Recruitment and Informed Consent:  The Post-Cardiac Arrest Service treats over 90% of patients successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest at UPMC Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_307], ensuring that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_410617].  Potential subjects who remain comatose for [ADDRESS_517962] previously recruited 50% of potentially eligible subjects into studies in this setting.

At randomization, subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_410621] (these EEG patterns must have stopped by [CONTACT_410622], because continued malignant EEG is an exclusion). Both of these have been associated with outcome. [2, 16, 32, 3.C.1.b]  4.5 Intervention Subjects assigned to the intervention arm will receive a dose of 100mg of amantadine, administered twice daily (at 6 am and 12 noon) for up to [ADDRESS_517964] Written do not attempt resuscitation (DNAR) reported to providers before randomization Age 18 years or more Known prisoner or pregnancy Defibrillation and/or chest compressions by [CONTACT_410623] N20 response on SSEP prior to randomization.

As noted in the preliminary data above, development and persistence of malignant EEG patterns is associated with poor neurologic outcome independent of initial illness severity. [Section 3.C.1.b]  This design will allow these patients to be diagnosed with persistent malignant EEG patterns and excluded from the study. 4.8 Pharmacokinetic Measurements Plasma concentrations of amantadine will be determined using solid phase extraction and a validated ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry adapted from Arndt et al. [33] A 5 ml sample of blood will be obtained in citrated tubes, centrifuged (1000g x 15 minutes), decanted, and plasma frozen at -80ºC until assay. Sampling will occur at 8 time points; daily “peak” levels 1-2 h following the afternoon dose on days 1-4 and “trough” levels immediately prior to [ADDRESS_517966] of amantadine based on plasma levels achieved in the study. The 4 days of sampling will capture steady-state levels (amantadine half-live is ~17 h) and also spans the period of greatest vulnerability for hypothermia-induced changes in drug pharmacokinetics if they should occur. 4.9 Monitoring of Compliance:  [CONTACT_410632] leads a unique Post-Cardiac Arrest Service that has cared for this population since 2007.  This ensures standardization of prognostic workup and clinical care outside of the care delineated in this study protocol.  At enrollment, a trained research assistant will prospectively record pertinent information on the subject.  The research assistant will also facilitate obtaining study drug from IDS to ensure drug administration in a timely fashion.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_410619], audits and will oversee the database and maintain quality. 4.[ADDRESS_517967] complexes at ≥ 3Hz or sequential rhythmic, periodic or quasi-periodic waves at ≥ 1Hz with unequivocal evolution in frequency, morphology, or location lasting at least 10 seconds.

Experts have recommended a standardized approach that includes targeted temperature management to optimize outcomes following cardiac arrest. [4, 8, 17]  Our prior work has demonstrated that initial critical care management of the post-cardiac arrest patient has a large influence on neurological recovery and survival. [5, 26]  Case control studies have reported improved outcomes in patients receiving combinations of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-based treatments compared to historical controls. [5, 24]  We have shown that early use of coronary angiography and primary PCI is associated with good neurologic prognosis. [6, 8, 34]  Our work through the ROC cardiac arrest registry has demonstrated that patients who were treated to a receiving hospi[INVESTIGATOR_410620] a coronary catheterization laboratory had better outcomes compared to those who were not. [8]  Collectively, these studies demonstrate that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-based care of those resuscitated from cardiac arrest impacts patient outcomes and may modify the effect of interventions for cardiac arrest. We have addressed this issue for all subjects will be cared for by [CONTACT_410624]-Presby[CONTACT_410625].   4.[ADDRESS_517972] definitions. [Table 3]  Locally, the PCAC II illness severity phenotype with malignant EEG patterns has a markedly reduced survival when compared to PCAC II illness severity without malignant EEG patterns. Thus, subjects will be stratified on PCAC and (in the PCAC II illness severity subjects) presence of malignant EEG pattern prior to randomization.  If malignant patterns do develop, we will provide therapy to suppress the EEG and any clinical evidence of seizures. [Figure 3] This ensures a standard approach to all subjects in the study.  Importantly, subjects with malignant EEG patterns that persist beyond [ADDRESS_517973] chosen the rate of awakening as the primary outcome in this study.  This short-term outcome is appropriate to determine if a potential for benefit exists. [35]  Awakening is a prerequisite for a good neurologic outcome. [17]  Persistent coma is the most common reason for withdrawal of care (56%) while multiple organ failure is the etiology of death in a minority (17%) of patients. [2].  Prior literature is hindered by [CONTACT_410626].  Achievement of awakening will likely increase the family’s interest in continuing supportive care for this population. Consequently it is critical to evaluate rate of awakening and time to awakening in both an intervention and placebo group as delaying time to withdrawal may independently increase the rate of awakening. 

Awakening is an appropriate short-term outcome as subjects who awaken survive and comprise all good outcomes by [CONTACT_410627].  Most tend to improve in functional status over the year after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. [19]  Two-thirds of patients who awaken but do not survive to discharge die from multiple organ failure.  This investigation proposes an early neurologic intervention that is unlikely to improve other organ failure.  Thus, we have chosen a short-term neurologic outcome to maximize detection of a neurologic benefit to this intervention.  If the rate of awakening is higher in the treatment arm, the face value of awakening would probably prompt clinicians to adopt the treatment. Furthermore, a larger trial powered to evaluate a treatment effect on long-term functional outcomes might be justified. 4.[ADDRESS_517974] has rewarmed to a core temperature of >36°C.  [Table 4]  The initial examination is used to determine the category of initial illness severity. [2]  Daily examinations will not be performed until sedative medications have been discontinued for at least 40 minutes. [36] Our facility uses propofol for the majority of patients.   In subjects receiving continuous infusion of midazolam, the midazolam will be discontinued for 60 minutes before examination. In the rare instance of neuromuscular blockade use, examinations will not be completed until the train of four monitor reads 4/4.  Following rewarming, this examination will be completed daily.  Prior literature has demonstrated that individual findings are less predictive for outcome in the modern era, thus, no one finding will result in cessation of support. [7, 37, 38]  4.[ADDRESS_517975] findings are insufficient to preclude a good outcome. Therefore, no single finding will result in cessation of support. [7, 37, 38] A multimodal workup will be employed to predict neurologic outcome.  This includes clinical examination, continuous EEG monitoring, computerized tomography, somatosensory evoked potentials, and magnetic resonance imaging. [Figure 4]  The clinical examination is described in Table 4.  Continuous EEG monitoring is described above. 4.14.a Computerized tomography of the brain- Loss of grey-white differentiation (gray-white ratio of Hounsfeld Units <1.2) on initial CT of the brain predicts survival and neurologic outcome following cardiac arrest. [39-41] Subjects with a grey-white ratio <1.2 will be excluded from the study. 

4.14.b Somatosensory evoked potentials- Subjects without a motor response to painful stimuli (GCS Motor=1) at [ADDRESS_517976] SSEP’s obtained as part of the standard protocol.  A lack of N20 response bilaterally remains predictive for a poor neurologic outcome following cardiac arrest. [42] 4.14.c Magnetic Resonance Imaging- Subjects who remain unconscious for >[ADDRESS_517977] may receive MRI of the brain.  Whole brain ADC mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] <750 x10-6 mm2/sec has been associated with a mRS of >3 in prior work. [43] 4.14.d Neuronal Specific Enolase/S100B- These are not available clinically in our local facilities and have varying associations with neurologic outcome. [7, 42, 44]   4.15 Statistical Analysis 4.15.a Random Assignment Those eligible for the study will be randomly assigned with equal probability to the experimental condition (amantadine) or the control condition (placebo).  Random assignment will be stratified by [CONTACT_410628] (PCAC) and presence of malignant EEG patters (only in those with PCAC II), resulting in four strata:  PCAC IV, PCAC III, PCAC II with malignant EEG patterns, and PCAC II without malignant EEG patterns. Survival markedly differs between these strata. [Section 3.C.1.b]  To maximize the probability of a balanced design, assignments will occur in block of two and four within each stratum.  To ensure that the research team will be masked to the next treatment assignment, the size of the block will be randomly generated. Random assignment will occur through the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_274720] (IDS).  Study staff will contact [CONTACT_406023], provide the necessary information (e.g., stratum) and the random assignment will be delivered.  Given the volume of clinical studies at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], IDS pharmacy medications and randomization are available 24/7. 4.15.b Data Analysis The data analysis will begin by [CONTACT_410629].  Summary statistics, such as means, standard deviations and frequencies will be generated.  Graphical techniques, such as scatter plots and box plots will be used to evaluate the distribution of the baseline characteristics.   The balance of the baseline characteristics across treatment group will be compared.  For discrete characteristics a chi-square tests or Fisher’s exact test will be used to compare the proportions across treatment group.  For continuous measures, either t-tests or Wilcoxon tests will be used to compare the characteristics across treatment group.  Aim 1, Hypothesis 1: Administration of amantadine after cardiac arrest will decrease time to awakening when compared to placebo during the 7 days of treatment. Kaplan-Meier curves will be generated for time-to-awakening for each treatment group and a log-rank statistic will be used to compare the cumulative probability of awakening across treatment groups.   Those participants who are not awake by [CONTACT_410630] 7 will be considered censored observations.  A Cox proportional hazards regression model will be used to compare time-to-awakening by [CONTACT_410631].  The assumptions of the Cox proportional hazards model will be evaluated (proportionality of the hazards model) and if violated, a split analysis will be conducted. 
Aim 1, Hypothesis 2: A larger proportion of subjects will awaken during the first [ADDRESS_517978] will be used to compare the proportion of participants that are awake at day 7 between the two treatment groups.  Logistic regression model will be used to compare the proportions by [CONTACT_410631]. Aim 2: Determine if the number of serious adverse events differ between subjects randomized to amantadine and subjects randomized to placebo.   It is anticipated that given the severe critical state of those enrolled in the study, each study participant will have multiple serious adverse events.  A t-test (or Wilcoxon test) will be used to compare the means number of serious adverse events that occurred during the 7 days after treatment initiation.  A regression model will be used to compare the means after controlling for baseline characteristics that are not balanced through random assignment and stratification variables.  The type of regression model will depend in the distribution of the number of serious adverse events and could be a linear regression model, negative binomial model, or Poisson model. 4.15.c Sample Size The sample size calculations are based on the analysis approach for the primary hypothesis (Aim 1, Hypothesis 1) with a type I error rate of 0.05, a two-sided alternative hypothesis, and 80% power.  Based on these assumptions, a sample of 120 (60 per treatment group) will be sufficient to detect a difference of awakening of 30% in the control group and 50% in the active treatment group.

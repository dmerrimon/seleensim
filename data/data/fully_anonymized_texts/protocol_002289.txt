Objective/Primary 
Endpoints:   The primary objective of the trial is to demonstrate that the frequency of hemostatic interventions/procedures required 
intra-operatively or post-operatively related to the transection of the renal artery (RA) and renal vein (RV) during laparoscopic nephrectomies and nephroureterectomies with powered vascular stapler (PVS) is not increased when compared to standard of care (SOC). 
 
The primary performance endpoint will be: 
Incidence of hemostatic interventions/procedures 
completed for intra-operative bleeding related to the 
transection of the RA and RV during laparoscopic 
nephrectomies and nephroureterectomies with the use of standard of care stapler (SOC) or powered vascular stapler 
(PVS) defined as: 
 Hemostasis intervention:  bleeding 
detected and controlled intra-operatively 
(additional stapling, over-sewing, clip placement, compression, use of suture, sealant, and/or buttress, and/or use of energy); or bleeding that occurs intra-operatively requiring blood or blood 
product transfusion or an additional 
surgical procedure (e.g. conversion to open).  
No hemostasis intervention is defined as no bleeding at the 
staple line or bleeding that stops after initial blotting of 
staple line. 
 
The primary safety endpoint will be: 
Incidence of hemostatic interventions /procedures 
completed for post-operative bleeding related to the transection of the RA and RV during during laparoscopic nephrectomies and nephroureterectomies with the use of SOC or PVS: 
 Hemostasis intervention: bleeding that 
occurs post-operatively requiring blood 
or blood product transfusion or an 
additional surgical procedure (related to RA and RV transection).  
No hemostasis intervention is defined as no interventions 
needed for post-operative bleeding (related to RA and RV

Study Design: This prospective, randomized, c ontrolled, multi-center study 
will collect and compare data  from the surgeon’s current 
SOC stapler (for RA/RV transection) and powered vascular stapler.   
Number of 
Subjects 
(Planned): Approximately 250  subjects will be randomized 
Diagnosis/Criteria for Inclusion:   Subjects satisfying the following criteria will be eligible for participation in this study: 
 
1.   Scheduled for a simple or radical  laparoscopic 
nephrectomy or a laparoscopic nephroureterectomy in accordance with the institution’s standard of care (SOC); 
2. Performance status 0-1 (Eastern     
Cooperative Oncology Group classification), if applicable; 
3. ASA score < 3;

Statistical 
Methods:   Summary statistics and 95% confidence intervals will be provided for the number and frequency of interventions for 
the set of SOC and PVS subjects separately. This will be performed based on the total number of firings. An intervention is defined as any firing which is classified as hemostasis intervention.   Given that it is expected to have at least 300 firings in each group, the sample size of 
approximately 250 subjects is considered adequate for 
descriptive summarization of the number and frequency of surgical interventions. Assuming an approximate background intervention rate of 6%, the given sample size will provide reasonable precision in the estimation of the 
intervention rate to an expected margin of error for a 95% 
confidence interval of at most 2.9% for each group.  To establish that the intervention rate is not increased compared to SOC, a 95% confidence interval for the difference in proportion of firings requiring interventions for PVS minus SOC will be calculated and powered vascular 
stapler will be considered to have acceptable performance 
if the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval does not exceed 3%. 
The number and percentage of subjects requiring 
hemostasis interventions post-operatively that are classified 
as related to SOC or PVS for RA/RV transection (e.g. need 
for blood product transfusion or additional surgical procedure) will be summarized for each group as a primary safety endpoint.  
Additional endpoints will be summarized with descriptive 
statistics and 95% confidence intervals as appropriate for 
continuous or categorical measurements 
Safety will be assessed through the incidence of AEs and 
serious adverse events (SAEs), which will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).

1.0 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 
Nephrectomy has many indications, for both simple and radical approaches. A simple 
nephrectomy is indicated in patients with irreversible kidney damage due to symptomatic 
chronic infection, obstruction, calculus disease, or severe traumatic injury. Simple nephrectomy is also indicated to treat renovascular hypertension due to noncorrectable renal artery disease or severe unilateral parenchymal damage caused by [CONTACT_913618], pyelonephritis, reflux 
dysplasia, or congenital dysplasia of the kidney.

Surgery (traditional or laparoscopic) is the primary treatment for most renal cancers2 while 
laparoscopic donor nephrectomy has remained a safe, less invasive, and effective technique for renal allograft procurement.
[ADDRESS_1283832] common reason for a nephroureterectomy (removal of the kidney and ureter) is transitional cell carcinoma.  Transitional cell carcinoma is a cancer that occurs within the transitional epi[INVESTIGATOR_913609], ureter, and/or bladder.  
The surgical procedures performed under this protocol are simple or radical laparoscopic 
nephrectomies or nephroureterectomies.  The lapar oscopic approach typi[INVESTIGATOR_913610]/or flank area. Through these incisions, a surgeon uses a camera and specialized surgical instruments to conduct the operation and remove the entire affected kidney (and some of the surrounding tissues if indicated).   Laparoscopic nephrectomy is associated with less postoperative pain and a faster return to normal activities than open 
nephrectomy.

4.0 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
4.1 OVERALL STUDY DESIGN  
This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-center study that is intended to demonstrate that the frequency of hemostatic interventions/procedures required intra-
operatively or post-operatively r elated to the transection of the renal artery (RA) and renal vein 
(RV) during simple, radical laparoscopic nephrecto mies or laparoscopic nephroureterectomies 
with PVS is not increased when compared to standard of care (SOC).  
Eligible subjects will be randomized pre procedure in a 1:1 ratio to either the surgeon’s current SOC stapler or PVS. Subjects will be followed pos t-operatively through discharge and at [ADDRESS_1283836] surgery (final visit can be conducted either by [CONTACT_913619]). 
If the study surgeons have not completed previous ECHELON FLEX
TM Powered Vascular 
Stapler with Advanced Placement Tip training, each surgeon must complete two procedures 
with ECHELON FLEXTM Powered Vascular Stapler with Advanced Placement Tip prior to their 
first randomized subject.  These subjects will be considered part of a learning curve and will be analyzed separately from the randomized subjects.

4.2 RANDOMIZATION 
In this non blinded study, randomization will be used to avoid bias in the assignment of the 
stapling device to be utilized for RA/RV transection for each subject, to increase the likelihood 
that attributes of the subject are evenly balanced between groups, and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons between groups.  The Sponsor will assign the stapling device randomly to each subject on a 1:1 basis to either the surgeon’s current SOC or PVS.  In the event that a potential subject fails inclus ion/exclusion criteria prior to randomization, this 
subject will be considered a screen failure. 
4.2.1 Inclusion Criteria 
Subjects satisfying the following criteria will be eligible for participation in this study: 
1. Scheduled for a simple or radical laparoscopic nephrectomy or a laparoscopic 
nephroureterectomy  in accordance with the institution’s standard of care (SOC);  
2. Performance status 0-1 (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group classification), if 
applicable; 
3.  ASA score < 3; 
4.  No prior history of partial or wedge nephrectomy (on the kidney in which the 
procedure will be performed); 
5.  Willing to give consent and comply with study-related evaluation and treatment 
schedule; and 
6.  At least 18 years of age.  
 
4.2.2 Exclusion Criteria 
Subjects will be excluded from the study for any of the following: 
1.  Prior chemotherapy or radiation (wit hin [ADDRESS_1283837]’s enrollment); 
2. Pregnancy; 
3. Physical or psychological condition whic h would impair study participation; or 
4. The subject is judged unsuitable for study participation by [CONTACT_913620]/exclusion criteria and therefore

5.1.2 Electronic Data Capture 
An electronic data capture (EDC) system will be utilized by [CONTACT_212644] (medical records and/or source document worksheets) onto common eCRFs. This system is a web-based, 
secure electronic software application (Medidata
® Rave, Medidata® Rave, [ADDRESS_1283843], 9th Floor, [LOCATION_001], [LOCATION_001], [ZIP_CODE]). This system was 
designed and is developed and maintained by [CONTACT_212645] a manner that is 
compliant with national and international GCP data protection/data privacy and 
electronic record/electronic signature (e.g., 21 CFR Part 11) regulatory requirements. The EDC system will be used to  facilitate the collection of all study 
data at the site. Designated site personnel will be responsible for entering subject data into the EDC system. All external and Sponsor internal users will be trained on the EDC application at a level dependent on their planned function. An EDC 
digital User Manual will be available under the help menu within the Medidata
® 
Rave website to assist in the collection and entry of source data into the 
electronic casebook.    There is a 24/7/365 Help Desk Support line  
staffed by [CONTACT_913622]. 
 
5.1.3 Data Collection 
Each EDC eCRF will be completed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_335933]’s designee. Every effort should be made to respond to all monitoring and/or data management questions on each eCRF as completion of the data is required by [CONTACT_760]. A unique ID number will identify each subject.  The subject’s unique ID number will be visible 
on each eCRF. At no time should the subject name [CONTACT_340546].  
All data should be recorded accurately and completely. The Investigator is 
responsible for reviewing and approving each completed eCRF. Assurance of overall review and approval will be documented by [CONTACT_913623]’s electronic casebook. 
5.1.4  Data Correction 
Required data corrections to eCRFs will be prompted via automated electronic 
edit checks and/or queries manually cr eated by [CONTACT_340533]. The 
change(s), individual making the change(s), and time the change(s) were made 
to the eCRFs will be automatically captured in the audit trail within Medidata® 
Rave.

Protocol ESC-15-002 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 23 of 31 
Version/Date:  Original/[ADDRESS_1283845]’s office and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_497047]. These inspections are to verify adherence to the protocol, integrity of the data being captured on the eCRFs, and compliance with applicable regulations. 
Subject medical records will be maintained in a confidential manner. Study 
reports will not identify subjects by [CONTACT_2300]. These reports may be submitted to the 
FDA and/or applicable regulatory authorities.  
If custody of the records is transferred, notice of such a transfer should be given 
to the Sponsor no later than 10 working days after the transfer occurs. 
5.2 MEDICAL DICTIONARY CODING 
Medical dictionary coding of verbatim AE, and SAE captured on eCRFs will be performed 
using a coding thesaurus algorithm. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities and 
World Health Organization Drug Dictionary will be used after data entry and query resolution, via auto-encoding and interactive coding processes.  
6.0 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE 
Steps to be taken to assure the accuracy and reliability of data include the selection of 
qualified investigators and appropriate study center s, review of protocol procedures with 
the Investigator and associated personnel prior to the study, and periodic monitoring visits 
by [CONTACT_1034].  The Sponsor will review eCRFs for accuracy and completeness during on-site monitoring visits or periodic reviews of the EDC system; any discrepancies will be resolved with the Investigator or designees, as appropriate.  The data entered into the clinical study database will be verified for accuracy. 
 
6.1 INVESTIGATOR TRAINING 
Prior to screening subjects for this study, the PI, sub-investigators, study coordinators, 
and other designated staff (as applicable) will be provided information on study execution, data collection, and procedures specific to this clinical protocol. 
6.2 MONITORING 
This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_913624]: 
 The rights and well-being of the subjects are protected; 
 Reported study data is accurate, complete, and verifiable from source 
documents; and 
 The conduct of the study is in compliance with the currently approved 
protocol/amendment(s), applicable GCPs, and with applicable local/regional 
regulatory requirements. 
The extent and nature of monitoring will be predetermined and based on considerations 
 
Protocol ESC-15-002 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 24 of 31 
Version/Date:  Original/[ADDRESS_1283846] operating procedures as well as procedures (i.e., monitoring plan) specified by 
[CONTACT_913625].  These monitoring procedures are characterized in 
the monitoring plan for this study. 
 
6.3 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS 
A deviation (any activity conducted outside the parameters established by [CONTACT_17143]) can be identified from a number of sources.  Potential sources include, but are not limited to: a member of the Investigator’s staff, a Sponsor representative during 
monitoring visits, or a member of the data management or statistical groups when entering 
or analyzing data.  Regardless of the source, it  is crucial to document the deviation.  The 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_497048]/EC  as required by [CONTACT_1201]/EC procedures.  All 
deviations will be captured in the source as well as the eCRF. 
 
7.0 STATISTICAL METHODS PLANNED IN THE PROTOCOL AND 
DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
7.1 STATISTICAL AND ANALYTICAL PLANS 
The Sponsor’s Data Management and Biostatistics groups will be responsible for the 
analysis of data from this protocol. A comprehensive and detailed Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP) will be finalized prior to database lock and will supplement the statistical design and 
analysis described in this section. 
Categorical variables will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_913626]. Continuous variables will be su mmarized descriptively by [CONTACT_351009], mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. 
7.2 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
Approximately 250 subjects will be randomized in the study in a 1:[ADDRESS_1283847] of care or powered vascular stapler.  Historical clinical study data on a similar powered surgical stapler demonstrated a need for staple line interventions in approximately 6% of 
firings on the pulmonary artery or pulmonary vein. This data also showed an average of 
2.[ADDRESS_1283848] a minimum of 300 firings in each group, the sample size 
of approximately 250 subjects is considered adequate for descriptive summarization of the 
primary performance endpoint, i.e. number and frequency of intra-operative surgical 
interventions. Assuming an approximate backg round intervention rate of 6%, the given 
sample size will provide reasonable precision in the estimation of the intervention rate to 
an expected margin of error for a 95% confidence interval of at most 2.9% for each group. 
7.3 ANALYSIS SETS 
There will be three analysis sets defined: 
 The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will consist of all randomized subjects who had the 
 
Protocol ESC-15-002 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 of 31 
Version/Date:  Original/17 NOV2015 FINAL   
 
procedure performed and provide data on number of surgical interventions; 
 The Per Protocol (PP) Analysis Set will consist of all subjects in the FAS who had 
no major protocol violations; 
 The Safety Set consists of all randomized subjects on whom the procedure is 
started. 
The primary performance endpoint analysis will be performed on the Full Analysis Set and 
subjects will be classified according to t heir randomized treatment group.  The primary 
endpoint analysis will also be performed on the PP set as a sensitivity analysis to the results on the FAS. The summary of additional endpoints will also be performed on the Full Analysis Set.   Analysis of the primary safety endpoint and adverse event summaries will be performed on the Safety Set.   
7.4 ANALYSIS OF EFFECTIVENESS 
Summary statistics and 95% confidence intervals will be provided for the number and 
frequency of interventions for the set of SOC subjects and PVS subjects separately. This 
will be performed based on the total number of firings. An intervention is defined as any firing which is classified as hemostasis intervention.  To establish that the intervention rate is not increased compared to SOC, a 95% confidence interval for the difference in proportion of firings requiring interventions for PVS minus SOC will be calculated and powered vascular stapler will be considered to have acceptable performance if the upper 
bound of the 95% confidence interval does not exceed 3%.   
Additional endpoints will be summarized with descriptive statistics and 95% confidence 
intervals as appropriate for continuous or categorical measurements.   
7.5 STATISTICAL/ANALYTICAL ISSUES 
7.5.[ADDRESS_1283849] on the overall 
results.  
7.5.4 Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity 
No adjustment for multiplicity is necessary since multiple hypotheses are not being 
tested. 
7.[ADDRESS_1283850]-operatively that are classified as related to SOC/PVS for RA/RV transection (e.g. need for 
blood product transfusion or additional surgical procedure) will be summarized for each 
 
Protocol ESC-15-002 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 26 of 31 
Version/Date:  Original/17 NOV2015 FINAL   
 
group as a primary safety endpoint.  
Safety will be assessed through the incidence of AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs), 
which will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The 
incidence of AEs will be summarized at the MedDRA system organ class and preferred 
term level. Incidence of AEs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_764]. All reported adverse events will be listed.  
8.[ADDRESS_1283851] that 
may or may not be attributable to the device or procedure. All AEs, regardless of their relationship to the procedure or device, are to be recorded in the eCRF and 
reported to the Sponsor.   
In addition, the Investigator is required to provide: 
 The onset and resolution dates of the event; 
 The severity of the event;  The outcome of the event;  The relationship of the event to procedure and/or device (ECHELON 
FLEX™ Powered Vascular Stapler with Advanced Placement Tip or 
standard of care stapler); and 
 The action taken for the medical management of the event. 
Postoperative pain is expected and will not  be documented as an adverse event 
unless the Investigator considers the pain to  exceed what is typi[INVESTIGATOR_913612] a laparoscopic nephrectomy or laparoscopic nephroureterectomy. (This 
data is separate from incisional and/or trocar pain).  
9.1.2 Anticipated Adverse Events 
An expected morbidity/procedural complication is defined as an AE that is known to 
be common or usual in nature, severity, or incidence during laparoscopic 
nephrectomies/ nephroureterectomies. 
A list of anticipated AEs that may occur during this study are listed in Appendix I. 
9.1.3 Serious Adverse Event  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to determine if an AE is an SAE. 
 
Protocol ESC-15-002 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 of 31 
Version/Date:  Original/17 NOV2015 FINAL   
 
SAEs are AEs that: 
 Led to death, 
 Led to serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that either resulted 
in 
- a life-threatening illness or injury, or 
- a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or - in-patient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or - medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illness or 
injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body 
function, 
- Led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth 
defect 
 
Note:  “Death” should not be reported as an adverse event.  The cause of death 
should be reported as an adverse event.  The only exception is “Sudden Death” when the cause is unknown. 
9.1.4 Severity of Adverse Events 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to assess the severity of an AE.  A change in 
severity may constitute a new reportable AE. 
The following guideline should be used to determine the severity of each adverse 
event: 
 MILD:  Awareness of experience, but easily tolerated. No medical intervention 
required. 
 MODERATE:  Enough discomfort to interfere with usual activities. Medical 
intervention required. 
 SEVERE: Inability to carry out usual activities.  Medical intervention (including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318]) required. 
 
9.1.5 Relationship of Adverse Events 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to assess the relationship of an AE to the study 
procedure (laparoscopic nephrectomies/ nephroureterectomies) and powered 
vascular stapler or SOC. 
The following guidelines should be used in determining the relationship of an 
adverse event to the study device, study procedure, or other causality: 
 Not Related – A clinical event (including abnormal laboratory result) that results 
from causes extraneous to administration of device/procedure/other and is most 
likely due to alternative etiology, (i.e., pre-existing condition, underlying disease, 
intercurrent illness, concomitant medications); 
 Possibly  – A clinical event (including abnormal laboratory result) that presents 
an unlikely association between device/procedure/other, which cannot be ruled out with certainty, but could also be explained by [CONTACT_913627]; 
 Related – A clinical event (including abnormal laboratory result) that presents a 
 
Protocol ESC-15-002 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 28 of 31 
Version/Date:  Original/17 NOV2015 FINAL   
 
strong temporal relationship between device/procedure/other, in which an 
alternative etiology is unlikely; or 
 Unknown – A clinical event (including abnormal laboratory result) that cannot 
be determined to be related or unrelated to device/procedure/other given the 
information obtained. 
 
9.1.[ADDRESS_1283852] complaint is defined as any written, electronic or oral communication that 
alleges deficiencies related to the identity, labeling, quality, durability, reliability, 
safety, effectiveness, or performance of a device (i.e., stapler) after it is released for distribution (policy of Johnson and Johnson Medical Device Quality management).  A product complaint may or may not be associated with an AE/SAE.   
 
9.2 REPORTING PROCEDURES FOR ADVERSE EVENTS/PRODUCT 
COMPLAINTS 
8   
  
9.2.1 Reporting Adverse Events 
Data related to AEs will be recorded in the source documentation from the time of 
study enrollment (first incision) until the subject completes the study or terminates early. All AEs that are unresolved at st udy completion (or early termination) will be 
recorded as ongoing at study end. 
Data related to SAEs will be collected until event resolution, or until the event is 
considered stable, or until all attempts to determine the resolution of the event are 
exhausted. 
9.2.[ADDRESS_1283853] complete the SAE eCRF within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event.    
Supporting SAE documentation can be faxed to: 
 
 
 
The Investigator will also be required to assess if the SAE is considered anticipated 
(see Appendix I) and if the event involved a product complaint. The report of an SAE 
by 
a study site does not constitute an admission that study personnel or the user 
facility (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic) caused or contributed to the event. 
The study site is also responsible for submitting to the reviewing IRB/EC according to 
their IRB/EC procedures.

SECTION B:  RESEARCH METHODOLOGY [ADDRESS_734363]    162 
 163 
Endurance exercise elicits skeletal muscle and systemic inflammation, reflected in large part by 164 
increases in circulating concentrations of the pleotropic cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6).  Circulating [ADDRESS_734364] and recovery as 168 
skeletal muscle adapts with training.  However, performing repeated bouts of prolonged and 169 
unaccustomed, muscle damaging (i.e., eccentric loading) endurance exercise may be 170 
detrimental to performance and limit the adaptive responses to exercise by [CONTACT_559084] 171 
absorption of key nutrients (i.e., iron). Warfighters are commonly exposed to such exercise 172 
bouts during sustained training and combat operations (SUSOPS), the effects of which may be 173 
exacerbated by [CONTACT_559085].   We recently reported that IL-6 and hepcidin, a 174 
hepatic-derived protein that arises in response to inflammation and limits iron absorption, 175 
increased by [CONTACT_3450] 245% and 33%, respectively in Norwegian Soldiers participating in 176 
a short-term (96 h) Arctic SUSOPS [1].  Circulating hepcidin concentrations post-SUSOPS were 177 
associated with total daily energy expenditure ( r = 0.4), energy intake ( r = -0.26), and energy 178 
balance ( r = -0.43), suggesting that nutritional interventions designed to increase energy intake [ADDRESS_734365] downstream effects by [CONTACT_37761] 180

controlled laboratory study that simulates the physiological stressors imposed during SUSOPS 184 
to determine if the IL-6 response is exacerbated by [CONTACT_559086].   Fifteen male, weight-stable , 185 
active duty military personnel (aged 18 – 39 years) will be recruited to participate in a 22 d, 186 
longitudinal study.  The study is comprised of four sequential phases: 1) a 72 h SUSOPS, 2) a 7 187 
day recovery period (Recovery 1), 3) a second, 72 h SUSOPS, and 4) a final, 7 d recovery 188 
period (Recovery 2).   During SUSOPS, subjects will be randomized to consume either sufficient 189 
food (combat rations) to maintain energy balance within ± 10% of estimated total daily energy 190 
expenditure (SUSOPS BAL) or will be provided only enough food to match 45% of total dail y 191 
energy expenditure to elicit severe negative energy balance (SUSOPS NEG BAL). Testing 192 
procedures and primary outcome measures include dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), [ADDRESS_734367]-worn 205 
[LOCATION_003]RIEM Vigilance Monitoring System, the Fatigue Science ReadiBandTM actigraph, Philips 206 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_449167]® Spectrum Plus, or equivalent device. This design will test the 207 
hypothesis that maintaining energy balance will attenuate the IL-6 response to SUSOPS, 208 
improve iron absorption, and attenuate the potential negative effects of excessive inflammation 209 
on whole-body metabolic homeostasis.   Risks include those associated with venous 210 
catheterization, venipuncture, muscle biopsies, DEXA, exercise, and the discomfort of severe 211 
underfeeding.            212 
 213 
B2.  BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE   214 
 215 
Physiology of the Inflammatory Response to Exercise  216 
Prolonged strenuous exercise is characterized by a large increase in circulating concentrations 217 
of IL-6 ( Figure 1A ) followed by [CONTACT_559087], such as IL-[ADDRESS_734368] 218 
(IL-1ra), and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 [2-4]. In fact, concentrations of IL- 6 219 
consistently increase more than any other cytokine during an exercise bout [5]. The immediate 220 
increase in circulating concentrations of IL-6 with exercise is mediated by [CONTACT_559088] 221 
upregulation and release of IL-6 by [CONTACT_559089] [6, 7]. Although many 222 
cytokines are expressed in skeletal muscle (termed ‘myokines’) after prolonged exercise [8], IL- 223 
6 is the only myokine known to be released from skeletal muscle in appreciable concentrations. 224 
IL-6 synthesized and released by [CONTACT_559090] 225 
thought to exert metabolic effects and is dependent on muscle glycogen availability [6, 7, 9] 226 
(Figure 1B ). For example, reduction in intramuscular glycogen prior to exercise increases 227 
transcription of IL-6 mRNA in skeletal muscle and plasma IL-6 concentrations [6, 7], an effect 228 
which may be mediated through activation of AMP-activated protein kinase [10] and p38 229

 mitogen activated protein kinase [6]. Moreover, infusion of humans with recombinant human IL- 230 
6 (rhIL-6) induces a dose- dependent rise in blood glucose concentrations [11] and increases in 231 
glucose disposal [12, 13], indicating that IL-6 may signal for hepatic glucose release to maintain 232 
blood glucose during exercise. In addition to increasing hepatic glycogenolysis and 233 
gluconeogenesis, rhIL-6 enhances lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation in adipocytes [14, 15] , 234 
perhaps to provide free fatty acids and energy when glycogen stores are low. 235 
Another source of IL-6 is immune cells. During recovery from exercise, microstructural damage 236 
as a result of microtrauma to contractile elements and connective tissue within muscle tissue 237 
signal immune cell infiltration and secretion of cytokines (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-1β, 238 
IL-6, IL-1ra, and IL-10) to heal the tissue. The rapid release of TNF-α and IL-1β stimulate the 239 
production of IL-6, which in turn, is thought to be the central mediator in activating the acute- 240 
phase response and the systemic release of hepatocyte-derived acute phase proteins [16] . 241 
These are likely delayed or secondary to the metabolic effects of IL-6 during exercise (i.e., 242 
during recovery), as peak circulating concentrations of muscle-derived IL-6 occur immediately 243 
following exercise and are acute, whereas IL-6 produced by [CONTACT_559091] 244 
peak, is of lower magnitude, and may remain elevated for an extended period of time to repair 245 
the damaged tissue [5, 17, 18] ( Figure 1A ).  246 
247 
Figure 1. Plasma IL-6 response to exercise and potential nutritional interventions. (A) IL-6 is released into 248 
circulati on by [CONTACT_559092] (i.e., ‘muscle-derived IL-6’) during prolonged, strenuous 249 
exercise. This produces a large peak in circulating concentrations of IL-6 immediately after the completion 250 
of exercise followed by a rapid decline to baseline concentrations. If tissue injury occurs with exercise 251 
(e.g., strenuous eccentric exercise), immune cells infiltrate the muscle and release IL-6 to signal the 252 
acute-phase response and tissue repair (i.e., ‘immune cell-derived IL-6’). This produces a rise in 253 
circulating concentrations of IL-6 that is lower in magnitude, but more sustained than concentrations of IL- 254 
6 in circulating following exercise. Sufficient calories to match the energy requirement prior to exercise 255 
and carbohydrate supplementation during prolonged, strenuous exercise may be an effective strategy to 256 
reduce increases in muscle-derived IL-6 immediately following exercise. (B) Glycogen stores are depleted 257 
with prolonged, strenuous exercise. Reductions in muscle glycogen signal for the transcriptional 258 
upregulation of IL-6. IL-6 is released from contracting muscle, resulting in a rise in circulating levels of IL- 259 
6. IL-6 signals for hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Prolonged exercise also signals for the 260 
upregulation of IL- 6 in adipose tissue and an increase in lipolysis. Circulating fatty acids and glucose and 261 
fatty acids released from lipolysis of intramuscular triglycerides are transported to muscle mitochondria for 262 
oxidation, resulting in increased ATP and energy for the exercising muscle. Dietary carbohydrate and lipid 263 
increase available glucose and free fatty acids and stores of glycogen and triglycerides, thereby [CONTACT_559093] 264

Version # 7    
Date: [ADDRESS_734370] the source and magnitude of IL-6 released from muscle and immune cells in 267 
response to exercise include mode and location of muscle mass, frequency, duration, intensity, 268 
and training status [reviewed in [5, 13, 17, 18]]. In general, eccentric and strenuous exercise [ADDRESS_734371] increase in IL- 6 270 
as a cytokine and myokine, respectively. Although skeletal muscle damage is not required for 271 
the release of IL-6 from muscle during and immediately following exercise [5], it is important to [ADDRESS_734372] [20], as IL- [ADDRESS_734373] period [21], whereas detrimental effects may occur when the dose or [ADDRESS_734374] and nutrition. For 282 
example, repeated bouts of exercise on the same day or over the course of two days elevates 283 
circulating concentrations of immune cells and induces a more pronounced increase in plasma 284 
IL-6 as compared to a single bout of exercise [22, 23] . Further, repeated bouts of exercise [ADDRESS_734375] and nutrition may result in decreased performance, particularly if muscle 286 
glycogen concentrations are low prior to exercise (e.g., fasted state, inadequate recovery, etc.) 287 
or if the duration of exercise is too long to maintain glycogen stores.  288 
Importantly, sustained elevations in IL- 6 may result in a decline in nutrient absorption, 289 
particularly the nutritionally essential mineral iron. Circulating levels of iron increase immediately 290 
following exercise and decline with recovery [24]. Inflammation, specifically the release of IL-6, 291 
is known to contribute to the decline in iron (termed the ‘hypoferremia of inflammation’). For 292 
example, infusion of humans or animals with IL-6 reduces circulating concentrations of iron 293 
>50% [25, 26]. The mechanism for the hypoferremia of inflammation is well established and 294 
involves IL-6-induced increases in the hepatic, acute-phase protein hepcidin [26]. Hepcidin is 295 
thought to bind to Cys326 in the extracellular domain of the iron exporter ferroportin [27], resulting 296 
in the phosphorylation and subsequence ubiquitination of ferroportin [28]. The hepcidin- 297 
ferroportin complex is then endocytosed and degraded in the lysosome [29], thereby [CONTACT_61670] [ADDRESS_734376]-exercise increase in muscle-derived 301 
IL-6 [19]. Work from our laboratory indicates declines in iron status during military training [30, 302 
31], concomitant with increased inflammatory biomarkers, including IL-6 and hepcidin [32, 33] . 303 
As poor iron status is associated with a decrease in cognitive and physical performance [31] 304 
these data indicate that prolonged or repeated IL-6-mediated increases in hepcidin during 305 
training may be of concern if resulting in diminished iron status. 306 
Nutritional Countermeasures to Inflammation: Role of Substrate Availability and Energy 307

 training). Because IL-[ADDRESS_734377] been studied with the goal of mitigating increases in 312 
circulating concentrations of IL-6 [19] . Collectively, these studies suggest that diets providing 313 
adequate energy and that are high in carbohydrate (>60%) prior to exercise may attenuate the 314 
depletion of glycogen stores and the resulting muscle-derived IL-6 response following exercise. 315 
This is consistent with the notion that IL-6 release from contracting skeletal muscle is related to 316 
pre-exercise glycogen availability [9] and that circulating concentrations of IL-[ADDRESS_734378]-exercise 317 
are negatively correlated with skeletal muscle glycogen concentrations [34] such that the [ADDRESS_734379].  320 
Sustained Operations, Energy Balance and Inflammation: Observations from Military 321 
Field Studies 322 
Military personnel experience periods of negative energy balance resulting from increased 323 
energy expenditure, limited dietary intake, or combined effects of both during sustained combat 324 
and training operations (SUSOPS).   Warfighters engaged in various SUSOPS (i.e., 1-[ADDRESS_734380] (1-3 d), and repeated for ≥ a month) expend an average 326 
of 4600 kcal/d [35, 36].  In some cases, energy expenditure may exceed these levels; total 327 
energy expenditures for Marines engaged in mountain warfare training exceed 7000 kcal/d [37].  328 
During military training and operations, energy supply and intake may be insufficient to maintain 329 
energy balance, thus resulting in extreme energy deficits [35, 38].  For example, mean energy 330 
expenditure during a 54-hr field training exercise was 6100 kcal/d for men, yet energy intake did 331 
not exceed 1500 kcal/d, resulting in a significant loss of total body mass [39].  Prolonged or [ADDRESS_734381] been associated with inflammation and degraded 335 
nutritional status.  For example, short-term (7 d) military training results in significant elevations 336 
in IL-6 and hepcidin [33].  Longer-term military training, such as basic combat training (7-10 wk), 337 
results in diminished iron status, which may be due to the physiologic response to repeated 338 
exposure to IL-6 [30-32].  A number of studies have investigated the effect of macronutrients, 339 
including carbohydrates, on the inflammatory and immune response to physical activity [40, 41], [ADDRESS_734382] not carefully controlled for energy intake.  The relationship between 341 
energy balance and the inflammatory response, particularly the hepcidin response, is not well 342 
described.  Previous studies from our laboratory show that  IL-6 and hepcidin increased by 343 
approximately 245% ( Figure 2A) and 33% ( Figure 2B), respectively in Norwegian Soldiers 344 
participating in a short-term 96-h Arctic SUSOPS that produced high energy expenditures 345 
(~6000 kcal/d) and severe energy deficits (~50% total energy expenditure) [1].  Circulating [ADDRESS_734383]-SUSOPS were associated with total daily energy expenditure ( r = 347 
0.4), energy intake ( r = -0.26), and energy balance ( r = -0.43 , Figure 2C) [1].  Collectively, these 348

Secondary Objectives 360 
 361 
Military Operational Stress, Intestinal Permeability, and Gut Microbiota Composition 362 
 363 
Decreased gut barrier integrity has been reported following exposure to physical and 364 
psychological stressors such as those commonly experienced during military training [42-44].  365 
The resulting increase in intestinal permeability can facilitate translocation of antigens from the 366 
gut into systemic circulation thereby [CONTACT_559094] 367 
dysfunction [43].  A critical mediator of gut barrier integrity is the composition and activity of the 368 
bacteria residing in the human gut, the gut microbiota [45].  Our laboratory recently reported a 369 
positive association between changes in serum IL-6 concentrations and changes in intestinal 370 
permeability in Norwegian Soldiers participating in a 96-h Arctic SUSOPS characterized by 371 
severe energy deficit [44].  Changes in intestinal permeability and inflammation coincided with 372 
pronounced shifts in gut microbiota composition and activity, and changes in intestinal 373 
permeability were associated with both the composition of the microbiota before SUSOPS and 374 
changes in microbiota activity during SUSOPS [44].  Severe energy deficit alone has been [ADDRESS_734386] gut barrier integrity, and gut microbiota composition and activity [46, 376 
47].  The gap in knowledge is to what extent decrements in intestinal permeability and the gut 377 
microbiome can be mitigated by [CONTACT_559095].  We will address 378 
this gap by [CONTACT_559096]. 379 
 380 
A primary finding from our Norwegian study was that of an increase in gut microbiota diversity 381 
which was associated with increases in intestinal permeability during SUSOPS.  Greater 382 
diversity in the microbiota is generally considered a marker of a healthy and more resilient gut 383 
microbiota, and diversity has been reported to decrease in response to various stressors in 384 
animal models [48, 49].  It was recently shown that longer intestinal transit time is associated 385 
with increased gut microbiota diversity and changes in the relative abundance of multiple taxa 386 
[50], implicating transit time as an important confounder in studies assessing the gut microbiota, [ADDRESS_734387] intestinal transit.  Exercise [51] , 388 
underfeeding [52], and psychological and physical stress [53] have been independently shown [ADDRESS_734388] on gut microbiota composition, are undetermined.     391 
 392 
Military Operational Stress , Appetite Regulation and Eating Behavior 393 
 394 
Warfighters frequently endure substantial energy deficit during SUSOPS, even when enough 395 
food is provided to meet energy demands [54, 55].  This is counterintuitive because in most 396

Version # 7    
Date: [ADDRESS_734389] all been cited as contributing to undereating during SUSOPS [54, 399 
55], but whether appetite actually increases sufficiently to balance energy intake with elevated 400 
energy expenditure is unclear.  The observation that endurance exercise transiently suppresses 401 
appetite, increases appetite-suppressing hormone concentrations (e.g., peptide-YY (PYY), 402 
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and pancreatic polypeptide (PP)), and depresses appetite- 403 
stimulating hormone concentrations (i.e., acylated ghrelin) suggests that the counter-regulatory 404 
response to energy deficit could be blunted during SUSOPS [56-58].   However, to our [ADDRESS_734390] been associated with changes in appetite and appetite-mediating hormone secretion 407 
[52, 59] suggesting that exercise- and/or energy deficit-mediated decreases in transit time could 408 
contribute to appetite suppression during SUSOPS.   An improved understanding of how 409 
appetite and biological factors regulating appetite (i.e., appetite-mediating hormones and 410 
gastrointestinal transit rate) respond during SUSOPS is needed to optimize feeding strategies 411 
within these environments, and to elucidate the contribution of these factors to eating behaviors 412 
(e.g., food choice) that promote weight regain following SUSOPS.  As such, this study will 413 
measure appetite, food preferences, and biological factors mediating appetite and food choice 414 
before and after SUSOPS during both induced energy deficit and energy balance.  415 
 416 
A Systems Biology Approach for Characterizing Military Operational Stress 417 
 418 
Stress elicits systemic changes in gene and epi[INVESTIGATOR_559061]; behavior and performance; [ADDRESS_734391] to influence health and behavior is needed to both identify biomarkers of 422 
stress responses in Warfighters, and to elucidate targets for precision therapeutics aiming to 423 
mitigate stress responses that may compromise Warfighter health and performance.  For 424 
example, a systems biology approach interrogating the blood transcriptomic landscape was 425 
recently used to identify 1400 transcripts that were differentially expressed in Soldiers before 426 
and after Army Ranger Assessment and Selection [60] , a notoriously grueling training program.   [ADDRESS_734392] impacted 428 
biological response to Ranger School, and elucidated pathways underlying impaired immune 429 
function in this population.  This systems-biology approach will be expanded in this study by 430 
integrating genomic and epi[INVESTIGATOR_141214] (saliva), metabolomic (blood, feces, saliva), microbial 431 
metagenomic (feces, saliva), and proteomic (saliva and blood) analyses.  In addition to [ADDRESS_734393] physiology, the 434

B3.  MILITARY RELEVANCE     438 
Warfighters are often exposed to physical and cognitive stress, which likely contribute to 439 
documented declines in iron status , physical performance, and cognitive function during military 440 
training [30, 31, 61]. Thus, it is critical to identify factors that contribute to the decline in iron 441 
status and effective interventions to sustain and optimize Warfighter health and performance.  442 
This highly-controlled study will delineate the effects of repeated bouts of strenuous activity 443 
endured during SUSOPS on the IL-6 and hepcidin response, iron absorption and status, whole- 444 
body and skeletal muscle homeostasis, physical and cognitive performance, and determine if 445

 maintaining energy balance is an effective strategy to mitigate that response.  Data obtained 446 
from this study may be used in the development of countermeasures to attenuate the 447 
detrimental physiological effects of negative energy balance during strenuous military 448 
operations.  Data obtained from this study will also be used to identify novel potential 449 
biomarkers associated with the severity of stress responses to strenuous military operations.   450

B4.  OBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS/RESEARCH QUESTIONS    452 
 453 
Objectives 454 
 455 
1. To determine the effects of a simulated 72-h SUSOPS on IL-6, hepcidin, and 456 
fractional iron absorption.  457 
 458 
2. To determine whether energy balance and severe energy deficit modulate IL-6, 459 
hepcidin, and fractional iron absorption during a simulated 72-h SUSOPS.  460 
 461 
Secondary Objectives 462 
 463 
1. To determine whether energy balance and severe energy deficit modulate 464 
intramuscular inflammation, transcriptional modifications (e.g., microRNA and factors 465 
involved with energy substrate metabolism), anabolic signaling, remodeling, and 466 
whole-body (e.g., protein balance, immune function, etc.) adaptive responses to a 467 
simulated 72-h SUSOPS.  468 
 469 
2. To determine to what extent maintaining energy balance mitigates decrements in 470 
intestinal barrier integrity and in gut microbiome composition and function, and 471 
influences gastrointestinal transit time during a simulated 72-h SUSOPS. 472 
 473 
3. To determine whether energy deficit increases appetite, and alters food preferences 474 
and biological mediators of appetite (i.e., appetite-mediating hormones and 475 
gastrointestinal transit time) during a simulated 72-h SUSOPS, and identify effects 476 
on food choice following SUSOPS. 477 
 478 
4. To determine the effects of a simulated 72-h SUSOPS on physical performance, 479 
mood, cognitive performance, vigilance assessed continuously, and nightly sleep 480 
quality and determine whether energy deficiency exacerbates the effects of 481 
SUSOPS. 482 
 483 
5. Characterize genomic and epi[INVESTIGATOR_559062], 484 
particularly markers interacting with the microbiome from gut and saliva, to build 485 
networks that identify the “interactome” response associated with changes in energy 486 
homeostasis during SUSOPS.  487 
 488 
Hypotheses 489 
 490 
1. SUSOPS will increase circulating concentrations of IL-6 and hepcidin and decrease 491 
fractional iron absorption.  492 
 493 
2. Energy balance will attenuate circulating concentrations of IL-6 and hepcidin and 494

 532 
Healthy, recreationally-active adult men, who are active duty military, will be recruited to 533 
participate in this study . Male subjects were chosen because of known sex differences in 534 
iron status and absorption and differences in their response to exercise, including the IL- 535 
6 response to exercise [62, 63].   Pending the outcomes from this study, future, more 536 
targeted studies will be designed to address potential sex-based differences in 537 
physiological responses to SUSOPS.   538

performance familiarization trials, volunteers will complete a glycogen normalization protocol 603 
and be provided a 48 h carbohydrate refeeding diet on days 1 and 2 to restore muscle glycogen 604 
content pre-SUSOPS ( Figure 3 ). On day 2, following an ≥ [ADDRESS_734397] (0000 h), volunteers will [ADDRESS_734398] of three fractional iron absorption studies (Iron  606

 muscle biopsy of the vastus lateralis will be collected on the morning of day 3. Volunteers will 609 
also complete approximately 3-4 mood/cognitive-performance familiarization sessions and 1 610 
baseline session before the SUSOPS testing period.  Immediately thereafter, volunteers will 611 
complete a 72-h SUSOPS, and will be provided either sufficient food (combat rations) to 612 
maintain energy balance within ± 10% of estimated total daily energy expenditure (SUSOPS 613 
BAL) or  only enough food to match 45% of total daily energy expenditure to elicit severe 614 
negative energy balance (SUSOPS NEG BAL). Volunteers will reside at the Doriot Climatic 615 
Chambers during the SUSOPS beginning the evening of days 1 and 11  (volunteers will be 616 
provided standardized meals), and ending after final data collection on days 6 and 16 .  617 
Throughout these periods, volunteers will wear the [LOCATION_003]RIEM Vigilance Monitoring System, the 618 
Fatigue Science ReadiBandTM actigraph, Philips Respi[INVESTIGATOR_449167]® Spectrum Plus, or [ADDRESS_734399].  The activities performed will be comprised of 620 
load carriage and unloaded steady-state exercise and Warfighter operational tasks (e.g., 15 m 621 
timed casualty evacuation drag of a 123 kg dummy, move under fire , prepare fighting positions ) 622 
to increase total daily energy expenditures.  Physical performance will be assessed before and 623 
after each SUSOPS.  Mood, cognitive performance and overall vigilance will also be assessed.  624 
Sleep will be restricted to four hours per night during SUSOPS to mimic recent field studies.  On 625 
day 6 , immediately following the final exercise bout and 8 h after dinner on day 5 , a second 626 
muscle biopsy will be collected (alternate leg from biopsy one) and volunteers will undergo Iron 627 
Study 2 (57FeSO 4). Days 7- 12 will serve as a recovery period from SUSOPS 1 (Recovery 1).  628 
Fasted blood draws will be collected on days 7-9 during Recovery 1, and a second baseline 629 
mood/cognitive test session will occur during Recovery 1.  Starting on day 11, volunteers will [ADDRESS_734400] muscle biopsy (alternate leg from 632 
biopsy two) will be collected.   Immediately thereafter, volunteers will complete the second 72 h 633 
SUSOPS.  All testing , planned activity, and sleep restrictions will be the same as described for 634 
SUSOPS I; however, volunteers will switch to either SUSOPS BAL or SUSOPS NEG BAL.  Iron 635 
Study 3 (58FeSO 4) and the fourth and final muscle biopsy (alternate leg from biopsy three) will 636 
occur on day 16 immediately following the final exercise bout and 8 h after dinner on day 15.  637 
Days 17- 22will serve as Recovery 2 ([ADDRESS_734401]-SUSOPS recovery blood draw will be collected on 638 
day 22 to match the 7 d recovery from SUSOPS 1)   Diet records will be recorded on days 6-[ADDRESS_734402] importantly, the SUSOPS will 645 
be designed to elicit a marked inflammatory response.  Physical activity/exercise will be 646 
prescribed at levels to expend ~5000- 6000 total kcal/d using the ACSM metabolic equations for 647 
steady-state exercise [64] and the compendium of metabolic equivalents for physical activities 648 
[65].  Total daily energy expenditure estimates will be consistent with our recent reports in 649 
Norwegian Soldiers and matched between SUSOPS BAL and NEG BAL [55, 66].   Combat 650 
rations (Meal Ready- to-Eat) will serve as the underlying diet during SUSOPS BAL and NEG 651 
BAL (refer to SUSOPS Diet Intervention section for details).  Low- to-moderate intensity (30-65% 652 
VO 2peak) steady-state endurance-type exercise will be the primary exercise modality.    653 
Volunteers will perform three prolonged steady-state exercise bouts per day.  All three exercise 654 
sessions will be conducted outdoors on Natick Soldier Systems Center grounds (NSSC fitness 655 
trail).  Two of the three exercise bouts will be ~ 60-180-min load carriage exercise sessions, [ADDRESS_734403] will be unloaded. The total distance covered will be dictated by [CONTACT_29569] 657 
exercise prescriptions, and the load carried will be ~32 kg [comprised of the basic uniform (~5.3 658

 kg), weapon and tactical equipment (~11.2 kg), and rucksack (~15 kg)]. The loads carried are 659 
consistent with infantry occupation standards. Volunteers will be permitted to consume water ad 660 
libitum throughout each exercise trial to maintain hydration. During the remainder of each day, 661 
volunteers will perform a number of Warfighter tasks [e.g., 15 m timed casualty evacuation drag 662 
of a 123 kg dummy, move under fire (15, 6.6 m rushes with weapon and full combat load (32 kg) 663 
for time, with 5 secs between rushes), prepare fighting positions (move 16, 18 kg sandbags 10 664 
m while wearing full combat load minus a weapon (~26.5 kg)].  The Warfighter task measures [ADDRESS_734404] two familiarization trials of each task to reduce injury risk during 667 
the pre-study baseline period.  Mood, cognitive, and vigilance will also be assessed.  Self- 668 
reported mood and cognitive performance will be assessed twice per SUSOPS day in addition 669 
to the sessions performed prior to SUSOPS 1 during the baseline testing phase of the protocol 670 
and the session performed during Recovery 1.     Vigilance testing using the [LOCATION_003]RIEM Vigilance 671 
Monitoring System will only be active during specific intervals of wake time. Sleep will be 672 
restricted to 4 h per day to be consistent with previous [LOCATION_003]RIEM SUSOPS studies beginning 673 
the evening of days 3 and 13(i.e., volunteers will not be permitted to sleep until 0100 the 674 
morning of days 4 and 14 ) [67].  675 
 676 
Warfighter Tasks 677 
Move under Fire : During this task, volunteers will wear an approximately 32 kg fighting load 678 
[comprised of the basic uniform (~5.3 kg), weapon and tactical equipment (~11.2 kg), and 679 
rucksack (~15 kg)]. They will begin the task in the prone position.  Upon command, volunteers 680 
will sprint approximately 6 m to a marker and assume the predetermined position for that marker 681 
(either the kneeling or prone position).  They will remain in this position for approximately [ADDRESS_734405] covered a total of 100 m (15 rushes of ~6.6 m).  After starting in the prone position, the 685 
next two positions will be kneeling, and then a prone position until the course is completed.  686 
Time to complete the task will be recorded. Each testing session will take approximately 1- 2 687 
minutes.   688 
 689 
Casualty Evacuation Drag : Volunteers will drag a simulated casualty (approximately 123 kg) up [ADDRESS_734406] as possible in 60 sec, while wearing an approximately 32 kg fighting load 691 
[comprised of the basic uniform (~5.3 kg), weapon and tactical equipment (~11.2 kg), and 692 
rucksack (~15 kg)].  If the volunteer is unable to pull the casualty the full [ADDRESS_734407] 0.25 m.  694 
 695 
Prepare Fighting Positions (Sandbag Carry) : While wearing a fighting load minus the weapon 696 
(approximately 26.5 kg), volunteers will lift and carry a total of [ADDRESS_734408] and a 3 d activity log during baseline pre-study testing 703 
(days - 14-0) and according to instructions provided by a registered dietitian to characterize pre- 704 
study diet and exercise habits (see “Diet Record” and “Activity Log” ).  To predict total daily 705 
energy expenditure (TDEE), volunteers’ resting metabolic rate (RMR) will be measured during [ADDRESS_734409], open circuit 707 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133] (True Max 2400, ParvoMedics, Sandy, Utah, [LOCATION_003]).  RMR will be multiplied 708

 by a factor of 1.3 to estimate energy expenditures for activities of daily living.  Together, these 709 
data will serve as the baseline total daily energy requirements for SUSOPS 1 and 2.    710 
 711 
To increase TDEE to approximately 5000-6000 kcal/d, volunteers will be prescribed l ow-to- 712 
moderate intensity (30-65% of pre-determined peak oxygen uptake, VO 2peak and corresponding 713 
heart rate) endurance-type exercise using the ACSM metabolic equations for steady-state 714 
exercise [64] and the compendium of metabolic equivalents for physical activities (refer to 715 
descriptions of Determination of Peak Oxygen Consumption and SUSOPS BAL and SUSOPS 716 
NEG BAL below) [65].   717 
 718 
For example, an 85 kg individual with a baseline total daily energy requirement (RMR of 2000 719 
kcal/d * 1.3) of 2600 kcal/d and a VO 2peak of 45 mL/kg/min, would expend approximately 2468 720 
kcal during two, 90-min load carriage exercise bouts combined [i.e., 85kg+32kg load = 117 kg * 721 
(~50% of VO 2peak is 6.7 METS *3.5 mL/kg/min)/1000) * (90 min of work * 5 kcal/L/min) = 1234 722 
kcal/exercise bout], 600 kcal during a 60-min unloaded exercise session (calculations follow the 723 
same format), and approximately 100 kcal/d performing the Warfighter tasks, for an estimated 724 
TDEE of ~ 5768 kcal/d. TDEE prescriptions are individualized to each volunteer’s requirements 725 
and will be held constant between SUSOPS 1 and 2. Exercise intensities, total duration 726 
exercised, and TDEE will likely differ between volunteers.  Every attempt will be made to 727 
maintain TDEE between 5000-6000 kcal/d across all volunteers; however, some individuals 728 
may expend more and others less. 729 
 730 
Registered Dietitians will develop individualized daily menus for SUSOPS 1 and 2 using Food 731 
Processor SQL (ESHA Research, Salem, OR, Version 10.14). The diets during each SUSOPS 732 
period will be derived primarily from components of the US military Meals Ready- to-Eat (MRE) 733 
rations to achieve appropriate macronutrient proportions.   The macronutrient distribution of the 734 
MRE-based diets will not be manipulated.  Thus, volunteers will be consuming a diet providing 735 
approximately 60% carbohydrate, 10-15% protein, and 25-30% fat. The macronutrient 736 
distribution, as a % of total energy, will remain constant during SUSOPS NEG BAL by [CONTACT_559099] [ADDRESS_734410] closely resemble field-feeding practices observed during recent [LOCATION_003]RIEM studies [55, 739 
66].  The micronutrient content of the ration will not be altered.  However, to limit the potential [ADDRESS_734411] of differing iron intakes across SUSOPS 1 and 2, volunteers will consume 741 
supplemental iron sulfate mixed in water (Ferrous sulfate drops, RxChoice, available OTC) 742 
during SUSOPS NEG BAL to match total iron consumed during SUSOPS BAL. This equates to 743 
only ~4- 10 mg supplemental iron and will be consumed with one meal each day to mimic iron 744 
intake during SUSOPS BAL (iron content of SUSOPS BAL is approximately 20-25 mg/d). Water 745 
will be allowed ad libitum and total amount consumed will be recorded by [CONTACT_38991]. 746 
During the 48 hours prior to each SUSOPS period (beginning on days 1 and 11, volunteers will 747 
be fed meals derived of commercially available foods which will meet calculated energy 748 
requirements to maintain their body weight.       749 
 750 
Volunteers will receive instructions from study dietitians on how to consume an ad libitum diet 751 
with the same macronutrient distribution during the two recovery periods (see “Choosing Your 752 
Foods During Recovery” document).   Food records will be maintained by [CONTACT_559100] 753 
days 6-8 and 16- 18.  Volunteers will meet with study dietitians to review these records. These 754 
records will be used to determine how energy deficit during SUSOPS impacts food selection 755 
during recovery.  Physical activity will be restricted during both recovery periods.   756

 Doubly labeled water (DLW) will be used to determine actual TDEE during SUSOPS [ADDRESS_734412] 760 
iron study on day 2 (~[ADDRESS_734413]).  Immediately before drinking the DLW, volunteers 761 
will provide a urine sample to determine the natural abundance of 18O and 2H.  They will not eat or 762 
drink anything for 4 h (~0400 h) after consuming a total of 120 g DLW containing 10% H 218O 763 
(~0.285 g H 218O·kg total body water [TBW]-1) and 99% 2H2O (~0.15 g 2H2O·kg TBW-1; Sigma- [ADDRESS_734414]. Louis, MO or similar company).   The DLW dose container will be rinsed with local tap or 765 
bottled water, which the volunteer will drink.  Urine samples will then be collected approximately 4 h 766 
and 6 h after the DLW dosing for initial TBW determinations to be made.  Volunteers will be free to 767 
eat and drink after these urine samples.   768 
 769 
Two volunteers will be chosen at random to consume only locally available drinking water to control 770 
for natural changes in 2H and 18O abundance (local water will be analyzed to determine isotopic 771 
enrichments).  Rate of disappearance of 18O and 2H for volunteers dosed with DLW will be 772 
corrected for mean changes in background enrichments based on controls.  Morning urine samples 773 
will be collected daily during each SUSOPS period to determine elimination rates over time.  TBW 774 
will be calculated by [CONTACT_559101] 2H and 18O and 775 
extrapolated to a maximum enrichment. All urine samples will be collected and stored in 5ml tubes 776 
and shipped to the Pennington Biomedical Research Center (PBRC) for analysis.   777 
 778 
Enrichments of 2H and 18O will be measured using isotope ratio mass spectroscopy (Finnigan Mat 779 
252, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA or similar model).  The 2H and 18O isotope elimination 780

technique allows for the non-invasive assessment of soft tissue composition by [CONTACT_244601] a 802 
precision of 1-3%. The volunteer will lay face-up on the DEXA densitometer table in shorts, t- 803 
shirts, and stocking feet, and will be asked to remain motionless for the 8-10 min scan. The 804 
InBody measure takes less than a minute to complete, will be performed immediately before or 805 
after the DEXA, with volunteers wearing the same clothing described for DEXA.  These data will 806 
be used to calculate body water , protein (i.e., lean mass), mineral (i.e., bone), and fat mass.  807

 Determination of Peak Oxygen Uptake 809 
Peak oxygen uptake (VO 2peak) will be determined using an indirect, open circuit respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] 810 
system (True Max 2400, ParvoMedics, Sandy, Utah, [LOCATION_003]) on a cycle ergometer.  The value will 811 
be used to better estimate exercise-induced energy expenditure (EIEE) during SUSOPS and to 812 
determine the workloads necessary for the glycogen normalization protocol (see below).  [ADDRESS_734417].  Every minute, workload intensity will be progressively increased by 30 W until the 818 
volunteer is fatigued or unable to maintain a pedaling rate that either maintains or increases O 2 819 
consumption.   Heart rate will be monitored using a heart-rate monitor (Polar Electro Inc, Oulu, 820 
Finland) and recorded during the last [ADDRESS_734418] reports angina-like symptoms, exertional syncope, shows signs of 822 
poor perfusion (i.e., light- headedness, confusion, ataxia, pallor, cyanosis, nausea, or cold and 823 
clammy skin), or if the testing equipment fails.   824 
 825 
Glycogen Normalization Protocol 826 
To normalize muscle glycogen content and its potential influence on inflammation leading into 827 
both SUSOPS periods [days [ADDRESS_734419] (≥ 10 h)], participants will 828 
perform a glycogen normalization protocol followed by a 2-d refeeding protocol. The glycogen 829 
normalization protocol will be completed on a cycle ergometer. The intensity will be based on 830 
VO 2peak.  Volunteers will begin with a 5 min warm-up at 50% VO 2peak before beginning the 831 
protocol.  After a warm-up period, the cycle ergometer protocol is comprised of repeated periods 832 
of 2 min of work at 80 ± 5% V ̇O2peak followed by 2 min of recovery at 50 ± 5 % VO 2peak.  The [ADDRESS_734420] approximately 50-min (12 work:rest cycles). To ensure familiarity with the [ADDRESS_734421] 6.0 g carbohydrate ∙kg-1∙d-1 (~55- 839 
60% of total energy consumed ) to ensure adequate glycogen repletion and homogeneous 840 
glycogen levels within and across volunteers between SUSOPS phases (BAL and NEG BAL).  841 
All food and beverages (except water) will be prepared and provided by [CONTACT_559103] [ADDRESS_734422] largely of military combat ration and supplemental food items.   843 
 844 
Determination of Fractional Iron Absorption 845 
Volunteers will undergo three acute fractional iron absorption studies (Iron Studies 1, 2, and 3).  846 
The studies will occur on days 2, 6, and 16 in the morning (~0000 h) after an [ADDRESS_734423].  The iron 847 
studies on days 6 and 16 will occur ~[ADDRESS_734424] exercise bout of the SUSOPS 848 
to correspond to peak hepcidin responses to exercise.   An indwelling 18 gauge intravenous 849 
catheter will be placed in the antecubital fossa (or distally) and a baseline blood sample will be 850 
drawn before consuming the iron isotope (0 min).  Volunteers will then consume a 300 mL drink 851 
containing 3.8 mg iron (representative of dietary iron in an iron-rich meal) as isotopi[INVESTIGATOR_105681]  852 
54FeSO 4, 57FeSO 4, or 58FeSO 4 (Trace Sciences International). Venous blood samples will be [ADDRESS_734425] iron loading [70] to assess the effects of a 854

 Page 28 of 59 
 Percutaneous muscle biopsies will be obtained from the vastus lateralis using a 5 mm 859 
Bergstrom needle with manual suction while the volunteer is under local anesthesia (1% 860 
lidocaine) according to the approved [LOCATION_003]RIEM SOP [71, 72].  The biopsy procedures will be 861 
performed after a ≥ [ADDRESS_734426] immediately before starting and after completing each SUSOPS 862 
period (days 3, 6 , 13, and 16).  The muscle biopsies collected on days [ADDRESS_734427]-exercise 864 
(refer to Determination of Fractional Iron Absorption). The muscle samples obtained will be 865 
analyzed for muscle glycogen content, intramuscular markers of inflammation, proteolytic, 866 
energy-sensing, and anabolic cell signaling. Volunteers will undergo four total biopsies.  Each 867 
biopsy will require a new incision and the biopsied leg will alternate between days.    868 
 869 
Whole-Body Protein Utilization 870 
Whole-body protein turnover (15N-alanine) will be assessed before (days 2 and 12) and on the [ADDRESS_734428] day of each SUSOPS period (days 5 and 15), as previously reported in several studies from 872 
this laboratory [55, 66, 73, 74].  Total nitrogen, ammonia, and urea (15N-nitrogen, 15N- ammonia, 873 
and 15N-urea) enrichments will be used to measure whole-body protein turnover [75].  After 874 
providing a urine sample to determine background 15N enrichments , volunteers will consume a 875 
single dose of 15N-alanine ( 300 mg·d-1, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) and [ADDRESS_734429] their urine for the next 24 h.  Total nitrogen intake will be determined from ration dietary 877 
analysis.    878 
 879 
Urine samples will be frozen and shipped to Metabolic Solutions Inc. (Nashua, NH) for isotopic [ADDRESS_734430].   The 15N enrichment of urinary ammonia and N (ratio 881 
of tracer to tracee, t:t) will be determined using isotope ratio mass spectroscopy.  The t:t ratio for 882 
the cumulative sample will be corrected for the background 15N-ammonia enrichment.  Nitrogen 883 
intake ( I) during the 24 h period will be determined by [INVESTIGATOR_278354].  Nitrogen flux ( Q), protein 884 
synthesis (PS), protein breakdown (PB), and net protein balance (NET) will be calculated 885 
according to Stein et al.[76] .   886 
 887 
Determining Lower-Body Performance 888 
Physical performance (i.e., lower-body power) will be assessed before and after each SUSOPS [ADDRESS_734431] 890 
(Vertec™ device). Volunteers will place their feet at shoulder width with their knees slightly bent 891 
while standing on a flat, clean surface.  On command, volunteers will perform an arm swing and 892 
a countermovement to a self-selected depth and jump with maximal effort.  Volunteers will tap 893 
the fins of the Vertec™ at peak jump height. Volunteers will receive three attempts separated by 894 
one minute of recovery. Vertical displacement (jump height) will be  calculated as the difference 895 
between maximal jump height and reach height and peak power will be calculated using the 896 
following equation [77].  897 
 898 
Peak Power (Watts) = [60.7 x jump height (cm)] + [45.3 x body mass (kg)] - 2055  899 
 900 
Volunteers will receive detailed instruction, demonstration by [CONTACT_464], and complete two 901 
familiarization trials during the pre-study period.   All experimental conditions will be held 902 
constant between testing days. 903 
 904 
Eating behavior, appetite and food preferences and cravings 905 
Volunteers will rate self-perceived appetite using visual analog scales (see “ VAS” document).  906 
The VAS will be administered before and after meals, and before and after morning exercise on 907

administered at the same time of day as the morning exercise sessions on days 3-5, and 13- 909 
15).  Visual analog scales will be administered using paper and pencil, or via electronic means 910 
(e.g., tablet or laptop).   During study day -1, participants will remain in the lab under staff [ADDRESS_734432] through dinner (~0600-~ 1900) .  All meals will be provided in 912 
sufficient quantity to meet weight maintenance energy requirements, and participants will 913 
remain sedentary throughout the day.  Appetite-mediating hormones (acyl ghrelin, leptin, GLP- 914 
1, PYY, PP, and insulin) and metabolic markers putatively involved in appetite regulation 915 
(glucose, FFA, BHB) will be measured following a ≥[ADDRESS_734433] on the mornings of study days 3, 5 , 916 
7, 9, 13, 15, 17, and 19 and following the morning ruck march on days 3, 5 , 13 and 15. 917 
   918 
Food preferences will be measured using the Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire (LFPQ) 919 
which will be administered before and after lunch on study days -1 (may be adjusted ± 2d if 920 
needed) , 5, and 15.  The LFPQ is a computerized platform that measures different components 921 
of food preference and hedonics, and is administered on a computer [78].   For the tests, 32 922 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_559065] 3 dimensions; protein (low and high), taste (sweet 923 
and savory), and/or fat (low and high) will be selected from a validated database of common [ADDRESS_734434] four pi[INVESTIGATOR_559066].  To measure explicit liking 925 
(i.e., perceived hedonic impact of the food), the volunteer will be shown each pi[INVESTIGATOR_559067] 926 
order and asked to respond to the question “how pleasant would you find the taste of this food 927 
right now” using a visual analog scale. To measure explicit wanting (i.e, conscious desire to 928 
consume a food), the volunteer will be shown each pi[INVESTIGATOR_559068] 929 
respond to the question “how much do you want to eat this food right now”, using a visual 930 
analog scale. Mean ratings for each food category will be computed to determine explicit liking 931 
and explicit wanting for each food type. Implicit wanting (i.e., automatic subconscious attraction 932 
to a food) will be measured using forced choice methodology.  Pairs of food images from [ADDRESS_734435] want to eat at 935 
that moment. Both frequencies of selections within each food category and response time will 936 
be recorded.  A familiarization session will be conducted before study day -1.  The LFPQ will be 937

phases of the study participants will be given plastic sealable bags, a cooler or insulated bag , 952 
and ice packs to store and transport the samples (see “Fecal Collection Instructions”).  Gut 953 
microbiota composition, function, and activity will be measured at the US Army Center For 954 
Environmental Health Research ([LOCATION_003]CEHR), Ft Detrick using next generation shotgun- 955 
sequencing and non-targeted metabolomics. Additional aliquots will be archived by [CONTACT_559104] 956 
-80○C and may be analyzed for other gut related outcomes at a later date.  957

Date: [ADDRESS_734439] will be used to provide a functional assessment of 960 
gastrointestinal permeability [79]. For this test participants will consume 2 g sucralose and 2 g 961 
erythritol dissolved in 180 mL water in the morning during study days -1 (may be adjusted ± 2d if 962 
needed), 4, and 14. Sucralose and erythritol are sugar substitutes commonly used in a variety of [ADDRESS_734440] urine produced over the subsequent 24 hr.  Urine aliquots will be taken after 5 hr 965 
and 24 hr and frozen immediately. Urine sucralose and erythritol concentrations will be analyzed by 966 
PBRC, and will provide a measure of small intestinal, large intestinal and whole-gut permeability 967 
[79].  Coolers or insulated bags with ice packs will be used to keep urine cool and for transport of 968 
samples outside of the lab (see “Fecal Collection Instructions”).    969 
 970 
Gastrointestinal transit time 971 
Gastrointestinal transit time will be measured on days -1, 4 and 14 using the SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] 972 
(Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN).  The SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_559069]-approved wireless motility [ADDRESS_734441] while 974 
transmitting data to a receiver kept near the body 975 
[http://www.medtronic.com/covidien/products/motility-testing/smartpi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]-motility-testing-system# ].  976 
The device continuously measures gastrointestinal pH, core temperature, gastrointestinal 977 
pressure, and gastrointestinal transit time for up to 5 d, and can isolate transit through the 978 
stomach, small bowel, and colon [80].  One sterile SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_559070] [ADDRESS_734442] volunteers will pass the capsule within 985 
24-48 hr based on data from Rao et al. [81] who reported median [IQR] whole gut transit time of 986 
30 hr [22-46 hr] in [ADDRESS_734443] all of these measures. A subset of volunteers will be 990 
recruited randomly to participate in this procedure using a random number generator. If any 991 
volunteer who is randomly selected reports difficulty swallowing large pi[INVESTIGATOR_559071] 992 
contraindication (see below), they will be replaced with a randomly selected alternate. 993 
 Contraindications: 994 
 History of gastric bezoar 995 
 Swallowing disorders; severe dysphagia to food or pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] 996 
 Suspected or known strictures, fistulas, or physiological/mechanical GI obstruction 997

Assessment of mucosal immunity  1012  
Secretory IgA will be assessed from saliva samples at baseline and each morning of SUSOPS 1013  
to evaluate mucosal immunity. Saliva samples will be collected using the non-invasive 1014  
commercially-available Salimetrics polyester Oral Swab (SOS) technology (Salimetrics, CA, 1015  
[LOCATION_003]). Subjects will be asked to place one SOS under their tongue for [ADDRESS_734444] infections and to study the influence of stress and dehydration on 1021  
immune function [84-86] . The collected saliva will be stored at -80̊C until analysis. Saliva [ADDRESS_734445] of these sessions will serve as the baseline data for statistical 1029  
analyses.  During the simulated SUSOPS periods, a morning and evening mood/cognitive test [ADDRESS_734446]-worn 1031  
[LOCATION_003]RIEM Vigilance Monitoring System.  The Fatigue Science ReadiBand™ actigraph, Philips 1032

daytime motor activity. (see “POMS” and “EVAR” documents). 1034  
 1035  
The Profile of Mood States (POMS): The Profile of Mood States (POMS) Questionnaire [87] is a 65- 1036  
item inventory of self-reported mood states that is sensitive to a wide variety of nutritional 1037  
manipulations including undernutrition[88] and environmental factors including hypoxia [89], sleep 1038  
loss, and sub-clinical doses of various drugs [90-92].  Participants rate each of 65 mood-related 1039  
adjectives on a five-point scale, in response to the question, “How are you feeling right now?”  The 1040  
adjectives factor into six mood sub-scales (tension/anxiety, depression/dejection, anger/hostility, 1041  
vigor/activity, fatigue/inertia, and confusion/bewilderment.  The POMS will be used to assess the 1042  
overall mood states of the participants in the present study.  The POMS Questionnaire takes less 1043  
than 5 minutes and will be administered via computer software.   This questionnaire will be 1044  
purchased and used with permission. 1045  
 1046  
Evaluation of Risks Scale (EVAR):  The Evaluation of Risks (EVAR) Questionnaire measures 1047  
willingness to take risks through participant responses to 24 items which they mark on a visual 1048  
analog scale [93] .  Each end of the line is anchored by [CONTACT_559105] “not at all” and “very 1049  
much.” Respondents simply mark the point on the line that best describes their current feeling state. 1050  
The scale yields five factors, including Self-control, Danger-seeking, Energy, Impulsiveness, and 1051  
Invincibility, as well as a Total Risk-Taking Propensity score, which is derived by [CONTACT_329718] 24 1052  
items. These items are internally consistent, yielding a coefficient a of 0.78 [94]. The scale has been 1053  
shown to differentiate individuals who routinely engage in risky behavior, and it also correlates with 1054  
measures of sensation-seeking and other risk-related traits [93, 94]. The EVAR takes less than 5 1055  
minutes to complete.   This questionnaire is publicly available. 1056

Date: [ADDRESS_734463] (venipuncture). 3A second blood sample will be collected post-exercise for 1163  
the notated analytes on days 3, 5 , 13, and 15. 4Serum, EDTA, LiHep archived blood samples are derived 1164  
from the blood draws at each specific time point, and stored in the event certain assays require re- 1165  
analysis, or for future analysis if any sample remains. Based on this explanation, the total number of 1166  
study blood draws is 42 (iron study days, 8 x 3 = 24; 2 on days 3, 5 , 13, and 15, for 8 total draws; and 1 1167  
on every other indicated blood draw day, 10 total). Serum and plasma will be archived from each blood 1168  
draw. The total volume of blood collected per participant is ≤ ~530 mL.  1169  
 1170  
Saliva analysis 1171  
Saliva collection is a non-invasive technique with easy achievability that may facilitate sample 1172  
collection in austere environments by [CONTACT_559109].  The technique 1173  
may therefore provide an efficient alternative to using blood and/or fecal collection to monitor 1174  
physiological status in Warfighters engaged in SUSOPS or during deployment.  However, the 1175  
validity of saliva collection as a deployable solution for monitoring physiologic status requires 1176  
validation.  As such, saliva and blood samples will be collected in tandem.  Blood will be 1177  
subjected to mRNA-seq, targeted micro-RNA (see mRNA, myomiR, and c-myomiR Expression 1178  
below) and metabolomics analyses.   Saliva will be subjected to microRNA profiling, ion 1179  
abundance measurement  and metabolomics analyses .   Results will be compared between 1180  
sample types, and in relation to the gut microbiome, and cognitive and physical performance 1181  
outcomes.  In addition to validating the approach, analyses will be undertaken to explore 1182  
associations between the salivary microbiome and stress responses.   1183  
 1184  
Saliva samples will be collected on study days 2, 6 , 9, 16 and 19  at the same time blood 1185  
samples will be collected for mRNA-seq, microRNA-seq and metabolomics assays, 1186  
respectively.  During saliva collection, a Salivette tube with opaque white cap (SARSTEDT, Inc.) 1187  
will be opened; the swab will be removed and placed in the mouth. After 45 seconds (gentle 1188  
chewing possible, but not required), the saliva-soaked swab will be returned to the Salivette® [ADDRESS_734464] tube 1193  
will be used for microRNA sequencing and microbiome shot gun sequencing. The second tube 1194  
will be used for metabolomics and targeted proteomics (inflammatory panel of 65 protein 1195  
markers will be tested using the Luminex platform). 1196  
 1197  
Determination of Fractional Iron Absorption 1198  
Stable isotope concentrations in whole blood will be determined by [CONTACT_559110] 1199  
mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) by [CONTACT_559111] 1200  
(EESL) at Pennsylvania State University (PSU) using a fee-for-service contract.  1201  
 1202  
The amount of absorbed iron in circulation will be calculated using isotope dilution as described 1203  
previously [70, 99] . Briefly, the amount of absorbed iron circulating in blood will be calculated 1204  
based on the amount of stable isotope administered, the amount of stable isotope detected in 1205  
the blood, hemoglobin concentration, and blood volume, which will be estimated based on 1206  
volunteer height and weight [100]. Isotope dilution will also be used to calculate fractional iron 1207  
incorporation into red blood cells after administration of the stable isotope and assuming 80% 1208  
incorporation [70] .  1209  
 1210

Muscle Glycogen 1221  
Approximately 20 mg of muscle from each muscle biopsy will be dehydrated in a freeze dryer.  1222  
Samples will then be ground to powder and visible connective tissue will be removed.  1223  
Powdered muscle will be placed in 500 µl 2 N HCl.  Samples will then be placed in an incubator 1224  
for 120 min at 100˚C.  Following incubation samples will be neutralized with 1500 µl 0.67 N 1225  
NaOH.  Muscle glycogen will be in solution at this point.  Glycogen will be quantified by a 1226  
fluorometric assay (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, [LOCATION_003] or equivalent).  Muscle glycogen will be 1227  
quantified to determine the contribution of endogenous carbohydrate availability on inflammation 1228  
in response to SUSUPS BAL and NEG BAL.       1229  
 1230  
mRNA, myomiR, and c-myomiR Expression 1231  
Total RNA will be isolated from approximately 25 mg of muscle using a mirVanaTM miRNA 1232  
isolation kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, [LOCATION_003]) or equivalent.  Quantity and quality of RNA will be 1233  
assessed using a Nanodrop ND- 1000  spectrophotometer (Nanodrop, Wilmington, DE, [LOCATION_003]).  1234  
Equal amounts of total RNA will be synthesized into cDNA for analysis of mRNA (iScriptTM 1235  
Advanced cDNA Synthesis Kit; Bio-Rad or equivalent) and a TaqMan® microRNA RT kit 1236  
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, [LOCATION_003]) or equivalent.   Individual primers will be used to 1237  
determine the mRNA expression of known muscle inflammato ry, anabolic, proteolytic, 1238  
myogenic, and metabolic markers susceptible to stress, to include but not limited to, TNF-α , 1239

Myogenenin, Pax7, PGC-1α, SIRT1, p53, ACC, and AMPK. microRNA analysis will be 1241  
conducted using individual Taqman® probes (Applied Biosystems) or equivalent, assessing 1242  
microRNA that may be associated with inflammation and metabolism.  This microRNA targets 1243  
will include, but not be limited to, miR-1, miR-23a/b, miR-26, miR-29, miR-34a, miR-103, miR- 1244  
107, miR-133a/b, miR-146, miR-206, miR-208a, miR-486, and miR- 499a.  1245  
   1246  
Following identification of skeletal muscle microRNA that had a significant change, Taqman® 1247  
probes (Applied Biosystems) or equivalent will be used to assess the expression of these 1248  
microRNA in serum to determine their potential use as noninvasive markers of altered 1249  
metabolism in response to elevated inflammation during and following SUSOPS.  Circulating 1250  
miRNA will be extracted from 200 µL serum using miRNeasy Serum/Plasma kit, which allows 1251  
for extraction and purification of small (< 200 nucleotides) cell-free RNA (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, 1252  
[LOCATION_003] or equivalent). To avoid introduction of potentially contaminating material, prior to RNA 1253  
extraction serum samples will be centrifuged for 10 min at 4°C to remove cellular debris.  1254  
Supernatant will be removed and transferred to a new tube without disturbing the pellet.  Due to 1255

 the small amount of RNA in the serum, 3.5 µL of a Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531]-In Control (C. elegans miR-39; Qiagen 1256  
or equivalent) will be added to all samples prior to extraction of RNA to determine the yield of 1257  
template recovered.  After extraction 3 μl of serum RNA will reverse transcribed using the 1258  
TaqMan® microRNA RT kit (Applied Biosystems) or equivalent with miRNA-specific stem-loop 1259  
RT primers pooled in 1X-Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer for a final dilution of 0.05X.  A pre-amplification 1260  
step will be performed after reverse transcription to increase cDNA template using a primer pool 1261  
of 20 X Taqman® Small RNA Assays (Applied Biosystems) or equivalent for miRNA of interest 1262  
at 0.05X concentration in 1X TE buffer.  All serum miRNA will be normalized to the geometric 1263  
mean of external (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531]-In Control C. elegans miR-39) and internal controls to allow for both 1264  
technical and inter-individual normalization [101]. Geometric mean of controls will be used to [ADDRESS_734465] for possible outlying values and abundance differences between the different controls 1266  
[102].   1267  
 1268  
All reverse transcription for mRNA and miRNA, and pre-amplification of serum miRNA will be 1269  
conducted in a T100TM Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA or similar model). A 1270  
StepOnePlusTM real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) or similar model will be used to 1271  
perform all mRNA and miRNA analysis.  Fold changes will be calculated using the ∆∆cycle 1272  
threshold (∆∆ CT) method as described below in statistical analysis section. 1273  
 1274  
Bioinformatics Analysis 1275  
microRNA with significant changes in their expression will be uploaded to DNA Intelligent 1276

Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG; http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) pathways will be 1280  
identified using experimentally verified targets from TarBase 7.0 (Alexander Fleming BSRC).  1281  
Based on findings from this analysis, any additional gene and protein expression of relevant 1282  
targets will be assessed.    1283  
 1284  
Western Blotting 1285  
Approximately 30 mg of muscle will be homogenized in ice-cold buffer (1:10 w/v) containing 50 1286  
mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM Na-pyrophosphate, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 10% 1287  
glycerol (v/v), 1% Triton-X, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM benz-amidine, 1 mM PMSF, 10 μg mL−1 trypsin 1288  
inhibitor and 2 μg mL−1 aprotinin.  Homogenate will be centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 × g at 1289  
4°C.  Protein concentration of supernatant (lysate) will be determined using 660 nm Protein 1290  
Assay (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, [LOCATION_003] or equivalent).  Phosphorylation status and 1291  
total protein expression of intramuscular inflammation and markers of muscle carbohydrate 1292  
metabolism will be determined by [CONTACT_27187].  Muscle lysates will be solubilized in Laemmli 1293  
buffer, with equal amounts of total protein (15 μg) separated by [CONTACT_451]-PAGE using precast 1294  
Tris·HCl gels (Bio-Rad). Proteins will be transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) 1295  
membranes and incubated with commercially available primary antibodies of intracellular 1296  
markers involved in inflammation, anabolism, proteolysis, and substrate metabolism [e.g., IL-6, 1297  
TNFα, NF-kB, IKKα/β , Akt, mTORC1, p70SK1, AMPKα, p38 MAPK, PGC-1α , SIRT1, CaMK, 1298  
p53, and ACC (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, [LOCATION_003])] at 4°C overnight.  Labeling will 1299  
be performed using secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG conjugate with horseradish peroxidase; 1300  
Cell Signaling Technology), and chemiluminescent reagent will be applied (Super Signal, West 1301  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_500124]; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_340645], Rockford, IL, [LOCATION_003] or equivalent). Blots will be quantified using 1302  
the ChemiDoc XRS from Bio-Rad and Image Lab software (Bio-Rad) or similar model. To 1303  
confirm equal protein loading per well a normalizing protein such as HSP90 or GAPDH will be 1304  
assessed.  1305

Power calculations for appetite-mediating hormones outcomes were conducted using 1414  
data obtained during [LOCATION_003]RIEM protocol H10- 09 [73, 106].  In that study an energy 1415  
deficit (3700 kcal/d) slightly greater than that which will be imposed in this study resulted 1416  
in a 2.5-fold decrease in fasted acyl ghrelin, a 2.2 fold decrease in leptin, a 1.7-fold 1417

Using data obtained using the SmartPi[INVESTIGATOR_393833] a study of 73 healthy adults we estimate that 1430  
mean gastrointestinal transit time at baseline will be 29.5 hr (SD = 11.0 hr) [107].  Horner 1431

between repeated measurements of r = 0.50 (Diaz-Tartera et al. [107] reported r = 0.99), 1436  
we estimate that n = 8 participants will provide >80% power to detect a main effect of 1437  
condition at alpha = 0.05.  This sample size will also provide >80% power to detect a [ADDRESS_734484] size be medium (effect size = 0.5) and the correlation 1439  
between repeated measurements (r = 0.90) more similar to that reported by [CONTACT_559115]-Tartera 1440  
et al. [107]. We will enroll at least n = 9 in this procedure to ensure complete data is 1441  
collected on 8 participants.  Due to equipment availability, n = 9 is also the maximum 1442  
number of participants we can measure simultaneously.  However, should multiple 1443  
iterations be needed to complete data collection, we will enroll up to n = 9 participants 1444

intestinal permeability, and appetite-related outcomes.  1448  
 1449  
Next Generation Sequencing (maximum 200 million pair-end reads) of blood mRNA 1450  
samples from 15 participants will yield 60% statistical power to detect a true difference in [ADDRESS_734487] 1.5 fold with group coefficient variation 0.4, and  a conservative 1452  
false discovery rate of 0.05 using moderated t-tests and with transcriptome coverage of 1453  
9 over reference human genome with sequence length of 150 base pairs . Note, a more 1454  
liberal false discovery rate (e.g., 0.20) may be used to reduce type 2 error rates and 1455  
increase power.  For microbiome analysis, shotgun sequencing (maximum 50 million 1456  
pair end reads) of 15 participan ts will achieve ≥ 69% power to detect a true difference in [ADDRESS_734488] 1.5 fold with group coefficient variation 1.3, and false 1458  
discovery rate of 0.05. Again, a more liberal false discovery rate (e.g., 0.20) may be [ADDRESS_734489] size.  1461  
However, power will be enhanced by [CONTACT_559116] 1462

B5.8.2 Data analysis   1469  
 1470  
Statistical analyses will be conducted using either SPSS (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY), SAS 1471  
9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Carey, NC), or equivalent.  Common descriptive statistics will be 1472  
used to describe volunteer characteristics.  Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152]-Wilk tests will be used to determine 1473  
normality of data, and transformations will be applied as appropriate to ensure mode l 1474  
assumptions are met.  Correlation and multiple regression will be used to evaluate 1475  
relationships between study outcomes.   1476  
 1477  
Primary Objectives 1478  
Linear mixed models will be used to determine main effects of phase (SUSOPS BAL and 1479  
SUSOPS NEG BAL), time within phase, and their interaction on inflammation, iron 1480  
absorption, mood/cognitive, and measures of muscle, nutritional, and metabolic 1481  
homeostasis.  If phase by [CONTACT_559118], a Bonferroni correction will be 1482  
applied for multiple comparisons.  Statistical significance will be set at P < 0.05. To test [ADDRESS_734491] of group (SUSOPS BAL first, SUSOPS NEG BAL first) 1484

comparisons will be made using paired t-tests with Bonferroni corrections.  1497  
 1498  
Fecal metabolomics data will be visualized using hierarchical average-linkage clustering 1499  
and principal components analysis. Bacterial taxonomic data will be visualized using 1500  
hierarchical average-linkage clustering and principal coordinates analysis of beta (i.e., 1501  
between samples) diversity scores (e.g., Bray-Curtis, and weighted and unweighted 1502  
UniFrac). Alpha (i.e., within-sample) diversity will be calculated for taxonomic data using [ADDRESS_734495] of 1507  
group (SUSOPS BAL first, SUSOPS NEG BAL first) and a group- by-phase interaction 1508  
will be included in initial models.  These terms will be removed if they do not significantly 1509  
contribute to the overall fit of the model.  Models for bacterial taxa and gene abundance 1510  
will be analyzed using the R statistical software package “DESeq2” or equivalent.  The 1511  
Benjamini-Hochberg correction will be used to control the false discovery rate in 1512  
microbiome-specific and metabolite models.  Data analysis will be completed using 1513  
SPSS, XLSTAT, R, Qiime, or similar software as needed. 1514  
 1515  
Linear mixed models will be used to examine changes in appetite-mediating hormone 1516  
concentrations, appetite ratings, food preferences, food choice during recovery (i.e., diet 1517  
macronutrient proportion and energy intake). Models will include subject as a random [ADDRESS_734496] of group (SUSOPS BAL first, [ADDRESS_734497]) and a group- by-phase interaction will be included in initial [ADDRESS_734498] hoc 1524  
comparisons will be made using paired t-tests with Bonferroni corrections.  1525  
 1526  
The mRNA seq strand-specific libraries will be assayed using the Illumina HiSeq 1527  
platform. Paired end reads of the strand-specific RNA sequences (RNA-Seq) will be [ADDRESS_734499] 30 million 1529  
reads of 100 bases per sample. Based calling and expression analysis will be conducted 1530  
using the Illumina-provided tool CASAVA. miRNA (20-40 bp) will be size selected from [ADDRESS_734500] available version of the Illumina pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189]. 1533  
Preprocessing of raw base calls and sample de-multiplexing will be performed using the 1534

(<0.05) and fold-change 1.5. The R package BETR in conjunction with standard and 1552  
lagged correlation analysis will be used to find biological signatures which vary 1553  
systematically with the phenotypic data. Data dimension reduction, specifically latent 1554  
factor analysis for phenotypic (clinical indices of disease onset) and PCA/PCoA for 1555  
omics data will be used to uncover underlying mechanisms and dominating trends. Venn 1556  
diagrams will be used to identify the biological signatures, including the molecules and 1557  
enriched networks/pathways, which will emerge common/unique to different treatment 1558  
groups and common/unique to control vs. treated specimens. To assess gene ontology [ADDRESS_734502] (false discovery rate, q < 0.05) of Bingo 2.44 and 1561

Enrichment Analysis (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp) software sets. Gene- 1564  
metabolite condition ‘interactomes’ will be constructed and visualized using Gephi.0.8.2 1565  
beta (www.gephi.org). Using a suite of platforms such as ClueGo, Bingo, IPA, David and 1566  
IMPaLA, we will deliver a panel of networks informed by [CONTACT_559119] 1567  
evidence that are unique to treatment groups. From these analyses we will produce a 1568  
suite of networks informed by [CONTACT_559120] 1569  
treatment groups. 1570  
 1571  
We will employ our in-house developed tool, Core Module Biomarker Identification with 1572  
Network Exploration (COMBINER), to look for those novel functional groupi[INVESTIGATOR_559074] 1573  
molecules, which are statistically perturbed across time course.  In addition, Feature 1574  
Assisted Clustering for Time-series (FACT), a pi[INVESTIGATOR_559075] 1575  
visualization of longitudinal data, will identify differential expressed molecules, 1576  
pathways/GO terms, separate clusters of similar patterns, and compare pathway 1577  
dynamics.   Finally, we will use commonly accepted criteria of Receiver Operator Curve 1578  
(ROC), using Area Under Curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity to evaluate the 1579  
performance of individual molecules.       1580

eligibility will be determined based on volunteer responses to questions pertaining to 1592  
self-reported study inclusion and exclusion criteria (see “Background Questionnaire”). If 1593  
still eligible, volunteers will make an appointment for a medical screening. If an individual 1594  
fails the screening, their screening and demographic data will be destroyed. An 1595  
additional demographic and nutritional questionnaire will be administered during the pre- 1596  
study baseline period to those participants who are enrolled in the study (see “Additional 1597  
Demographic and Nutritional Survey” ). [ADDRESS_734505] at [LOCATION_003]RIEM (Natick, MA) by [CONTACT_559121].  1600  
Volunteers recruited through SSIT may undergo OMSO medical clearance at their home 1601  
duty station prior to arrival at [LOCATION_003]RIEM (clearances will be coordinated between the PI, 1602  
OMSO, and the unit’s Brigade Surgeon). The clearance will include a blood draw to 1603  
assess health status and inclusion/exclusion criteria. The medical screening visit will 1604  
take approximately 1 hr. If any medical screening tests show a possible medical 1605  
concern, the volunteer will be notified. Those who receive study clearance and meet the 1606  
inclusion/exclusion criteria will continue on pre-study, baseline testing.  1607  
 1608  
C1.2 Recruitment Process    1609  
 1610  
Volunteers will be recruited from the Natick Human Research Volunteer (HRV) Pool, and 1611  
the active duty population located at other military organizations, to include coordination 1612

C6.1 Risks of Harm    1790  
 1791  
Research Procedure Name:  [CONTACT_559129] 1792  
Research Procedure Description: A needle is used to draw blood from a superficial 1793  
vein.    1794  
Research-related Risks:   Venipuncture is a routine clinical procedure the medical [ADDRESS_734518] put their head down between their knees or lie down. 1801  
In addition, a hematoma may result from the venipuncture, but this is more unsightly 1802  
than risk producing.  Late complications might include thrombosis of the vein due to 1803  
trauma or infection. These complications are extremely rare .  1804  
Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm:   Volunteer monitoring, aseptic technique, [ADDRESS_734519] 1806  
medical precautions reduce risk. Trained technicians will perform all venipuncture. 1807  
         1808  
Research Procedure Name:   [CONTACT_559130]  1809  
Research Procedure Description:   A needle will be used to guide a catheter into a 1810

the catheter becomes clogged at any time during the protocol, it will be replaced to 1820  
continue blood sampling and therefore the study. This will require another needle to be 1821  
inserted.   1822  
Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm:  Trained technicians will use aseptic techniques [ADDRESS_734521] the catheter; however, in spi[INVESTIGATOR_559076] a chance that the site 1824

 studies.  This is because there is relatively little mass difference between the isotopic 1833  
tracers and the more prevalent natural isotopes, and the body’s naturally occurring pool [ADDRESS_734522] on the total abundance of the isotopes present in the body.  1836  
Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm:  All staff who directly participates in the stable [ADDRESS_734523]. Pasiakos, who 1838

Research Procedure Name:  [CONTACT_559132]  1841  
Research Procedure Description: A small incision will be made in the skin and fascia [ADDRESS_734524] muscle samples, while the volunteer is 1844  
under local anesthesia (1% lidocaine).  1845  
Research-related Risks:  Percutaneous needle muscle biopsies have been established [ADDRESS_734525] common risks associated with 1850  
muscle biopsies are pain (~1.27%), erythema (~1.27%), and ecchymosis (1.27%).[110, 1851  
111] Panic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], bleeding, and edema have also been reported (0.21%, 0.42%, and 1852  
0.84%, respectively).[110] Denervation, numbness, and atrophy may occur but have not 1853  
been verified in the literature.  Some minimal scarring will accompany healing of the 1854  
incision and formation of a hypertrophic scar or keloid is possible.  Although this is a rare 1855  
event in fair-skinned persons, the incidence of hypertrophic scarring or keloid formation 1856  
associated with healing of a primarily closed skin biopsy site (i.e., one which was closed [ADDRESS_734526]) is 5-10% in dark-skinned persons.   1858  
Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm:  Complications of bleeding can be reduced by [ADDRESS_734527] pressure to the wound following the biopsy.  If symptoms should occur, 1860  
they usually do not interfere with normal walking or heavier exercise.  Volunteers with 1861  
evidence of bleeding diathesis should be excluded during medical clearance; those with 1862  
local skin infection or irritation or recent use of anticoagulant medication not identified 1863  
during initial medical screening (including aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]) will be withdrawn by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_2993] [ADDRESS_734528] 1865

of infection, bleeding, or hematoma. 1872  
 1873  
Research Procedure Name:  [CONTACT_559133]  1874  
Research Procedure Description:   Approximately 8-10 mL of 1% lidocaine will be 1875  
injected using a 25 g needle at the site of the incision, superficially (i.e., skin) and within 1876  
the vastus lateralis.  1877  
Research-related Risks:   Slight pain at the site of injection might occur.  Although rare, 1878  
anaphylactic reactions may also occur following administration of lidocaine.  Unlikely, but 1879  
possible side effects could include: dizziness, confusion, shakiness, visual changes, 1880  
nausea, and unusually slow heartbeat.   1881

Research Procedure Name:   [CONTACT_559134]  1890  
Research Procedure Description:   Exercise includes peak aerobic capacity and 1891  
glycogen normalization studies on a cycle ergometer, outdoor load carriage exercise, 1892  
steady-state elliptical and cycle ergometer exercise sessions, exercise associated with 1893  
the Warfighter tasks .   1894  
Research-related Risks:  Exercise is generally considered safe and beneficial for 1895  
individuals without cardiovascular disease. The US prevalence of fatal events is 1896  
approximately 1:100,000 to 1:300,000 in competitive high school athletes and increases 1897  
to 1:15,000 to 1:50,[ADDRESS_734533] for 1 to 7 days. Additional risks associated with exercise include foot 1907  
blisters, skin chafing, muscle cramps, stress fracture, trauma due to falling, and 1908  
hypotension following the completion of the exercise bout.  The frequency of many of 1909  
these risks increases with the duration of the exercise bout.   1910  
Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm:   Studies have confirmed the safety of maximal [ADDRESS_734534] one spotter/monitor [ADDRESS_734535] administrators will be CPR-certified.  Additional safeguards 1915  
taken to minimize risk during exercise include: (a) qualified personnel will administer the 1916  
maximal exercise tests, (b) the volunteer will be asked to report any pain or discomfort 1917  
resulting from exercise, followed up if necessary by [CONTACT_559124] 1918  
postponement or curtailment of further testing, (c) volunteers will be required to wear 1919  
correctly sized footwear, and (d) volunteers will have access to water (ad libitum) to 1920  
remain hydrated.  1921

Interventions 1924  
Research Procedure Description:   Volunteers will be fed adequate energy to maintain 1925  
body mass during SUSOPS BAL and only 45% of total energy expenditure during 1926  
SUSOPS NEG BAL to elicit negative energy balance (where dietary intake is < energy 1927  
expenditure). Combat rations will be the primary food source (some perishable whole- 1928  
foods).     1929  
Research-related Risks:  The foods and MRE components used in this study pose no 1930  
known risks to volunteers. All of the meals that volunteers will be fed during both 96 hour 1931

Research Procedure Name:   [CONTACT_722] X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) Scan  1944  
Research Procedure Description:  Volunteer will lay face-up on the DEXA 1945  
densitometer table in shorts, t-shirts, and stocking feet.  Volunteers will be asked to 1946  
remain motionless for the 8-10 min scan.  1947  
Research-related Risks:  The DEXA scan is an X-ray and is considered to be a low risk 1948  
procedure.  The radiation dose of the whole-body DEXA scan is 0.1 mrem.  This dose is 1949  
equivalent to approximately 1/250 of normal annual background radiation, 1/9 of the 1950  
radiation received in a transatlantic flight, or 1/[ADDRESS_734538] X- 1951  
ray.   1952  
Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm:   A quality assurance check will be completed on 1953  
the DEXA each day prior to its use; the software will not allow the use of the DEXA 1954  
densitometer if the quality assurance check fails.   1955

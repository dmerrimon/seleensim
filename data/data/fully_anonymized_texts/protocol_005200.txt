Analysis  Modified: The first co -primary efficacy endpoint of the proportion of 
subjects who are free from headache pain at [ADDRESS_577454] 
dose of study drug taken for a migraine attack with moderate to 
severe headache pain during the DB1 period, will be analyzed using 
Fisher’s exact test. The second co- primary efficacy endpoint of the 
proportion of subjects who are free from their Screening MBS 
among nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia at 2  hours postdose 
during the DB1 period will be similarly analyzed using Fisher’s exact 
test. A subject’s MBS will be obtained at Screening via Migraine 
History assessment and, for the analysis of the co- primary 
endpoint, that symptom must be present predose but does not 
have to be designated as the MBS at predose.  
10.5.3  Explo ratory 
Analysis  Revised:  No exploratory analysis is planned . Exploratory analyses 
based on predose pain level and predose MBS are planned and 
details will be provided in the SAP.

CONFIDENTIAL  3 Introduction  
Acute migraine is a disabling neurological disorder with clinical findings of headache, often 
associated with nausea and vomiting. In the [LOCATION_002] ( US), about 17% of all women and 
6% of all men suffer from migraine. 
Although the exact mechanism of migraine is not known, the pathophysiology involves a 
combination of vascular and neurologic events in the brain and cranial meninges brain l eading 
to trigeminal -vas
cular activation and release of vasoactive peptides .2 Radiologic findings in 
migraine patients are characterized by [CONTACT_376787] -excitation of neuronal networks in multiple cortical 
regions, the brainstem, and the trigeminal nerve ganglion.2-4  
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_452873], pulsating quality, moderate or severe pain, aggravation by [CONTACT_452893], and association with nausea 
and/or 
photophobia and phonophobia. It is important to initiate pharmacotherapy as early as 
possible to abort the migraine before it becomes more resistant to treatment.  
Triptans are the mainstay of acute migraine tr eatment .[ADDRESS_577477] a high rate of adverse events (AEs) and

Nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs  (NSAIDs ) are a group of drugs with analgesic, antipyretic, 
and ant
i-inflammatory effects t hat act by [CONTACT_452895], cyclooxygenase ( COX )-1 and COX -2.13 NSAIDs that selectively inhibit the COX -2 
enzyme target those prostaglandins that are responsible for inflammation and pain (synthesized 
involving COX -2) while sparing the prostaglandins that are responsible for the maintenance and 
protection of the gastr ointestinal ( GI) tract (synthesized involving COX -1). Thus, the analgesic 
efficacy of NSAIDs is associated with inhibition of COX -2, whereas a majority of GI adverse 
effects, including bleeding and ulcers of the stomach and intestine appear to be relat ed to the 
inhibition of COX- 1. The use of COX -2–selective NSAIDs may provide a therapeutic advantage 
over non- selective NSAIDs for the acute management of migraine due to reduced incidence of 
upper GI ulcer s and bleeds and less GI upset.  Celecoxib, a selective COX -2 inhibitor, is 
available as an oral capsule in several dosage strengths marketed in the US by [CONTACT_452896], Inc. 
under the brand name [CONTACT_452927]® for the treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, 
ankylosing spondylitis, acute pain, and primary dysmenorrhea.  
NSAIDs can produce analgesia that is comparable with that observed with opi[INVESTIGATOR_40499], while sparing patients many of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- associated side effects such as sedation, nausea 
and 
vomiting. The analgesic effect of celecoxib is similar to  other NSAIDs. 
There is no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved oral liquid formulation of 
celecoxib. DFN- 15 is a new oral liquid formulation containin
g the COX -2–selective NSAID, 
celecoxib. It is proposed that DFN -[ADDRESS_577478]. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd.

Phase 2, placebo- controlled, double- blind  (DB), crossover study (DFN- 15-CD-002) to 
demonstrate the tolerability, safety,  and efficacy of DFN -15 for the treatment of acute migraine 
headaches (with or without aura).  Details are provided in the DFN -15 Investigator’s Brochure.[ADDRESS_577480]. Reddy’s Laboratories will seek an

5 Investigational Plan 
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a randomized, 2 DB treatment period study, to be conducted at multiple centers in the 
US. Male and female subjects, 18 to 75 years old (inclusive), previously diagnosed with at least 
12 months ’ medical history prior to screening  of epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730] ( as defined by [CONTACT_438043], 3rd edition [beta version]1 [ICHD- 3]), who do not have 
medication overuse, who experience 2 to 8 migraine attacks (with or without aura) per month, 
with 14 or fewer headache days per month, who can demonstrate 48 hours of headache -free 
time between migraine attacks, and who meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria 
and successfully complete all screening procedures, will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_577482] double -blind (DB1) period, 1 migraine attack will be treated with study drug as 
soon as (and no more than 1 hour after) experiencing moderate to severe pain level. Subjects 
will then return to the study site within [ADDRESS_577483] treatment and, if continuing  to be 
eligible,  will be re -randomized into a second double- blind (DB2) period to treat another attack at 
any pain level. They will then return to the study site within 2 to 7 days of the second treatment  
for the final visit (V isit 4/early termination [ V4/ET]). See Figure 5-1. 
Study drug should only be used to treat
 a new migraine attack, not a recurrence, and there 
should be at least [ADDRESS_577484]’s participation in the study would be up to [ADDRESS_577485] on migraine pain, symptoms, functional di
sability, and subjects’ satisfaction with treatment will be

discontinuation, subjects should be r
eferred to their usual healthcare professional to resume 
pre-study standard of care, as per the Investigator’s discretion.  
During the [ADDRESS_577486]. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd.  
DFN-15-CD-[ADDRESS_577487] treated acute 
migraine attack  (DB1 period) , subject s will treat moderate or severe pain to meet regulatory 
requirement s for efficacy determination; for the second attack  (DB2 period) , subject s will treat  
migraine at any pain level to determine if efficacy is achieved throughout the pain level range.  
During the treatment periods, subjects will have an option, if required, to take rescue medication 
after the [ADDRESS_577488]  comfort 
while support ing clinically relevant data collection  (see Section 8.5.2 ). Rescue medication will 
not be provided by [CONTACT_1034],

CONFIDENTIAL  8.1.1  Screening (Visit 1)  
After 
written informed consent is obtained and the subject  has been confirmed as qualifying to 
enter the screening period, the Investigator  or designee will contact [CONTACT_452901] (IWRS)  to obtain a unique subject  identification  (ID) number  to be used 
throughout the study . This subject  ID number will not be reused for any other participant in the 
study . This unique  identifier  comprises the numerical order of the subject s screened and will be 
used to identify the subject  on the eCRF. 
8.1.2  Randomization  (Visit 2)  
Once a subject ’s eligibilit
y for enrollment has been confirmed at the end of the screening period, 
the Investigator (or designee) should contact [CONTACT_452902] c enter to 
receive the subject  study drug kit assignment . Subject s who do not meet eligibility criteria will be 
registered as screen failures. It is important that the study  staff reconfirm the subject ’s 
willingness to continue in the study before  randomizing the subject  to a treatment.  
The planned treatment given to individual subject s will be determined by a randomizati on 
scheme prepared by [CONTACT_452903] . For both DB periods, all subject s 
will receive orally DFN- 15 or a matching placebo in a randomized 1:[ADDRESS_577503] doses of DFN- 15, Cel
ecoxib Oral Solution, 120 mg to 240 mg (50 mg/mL ) exhibited dose 
proportional bioavailability. The median time to peak concentration of celecoxib oral solution 
was faster (0.67 h) compared to Celebrex (2 h).  The mean maximum concentration values and 
mean of partial areas under the curve (AUCs ) (from AUC 0-0.25 to AUC 0-2.00) of DFN- 15, Celecoxib 
Oral Solution 50 mg/mL  were higher than Celebrex.  
DFN- 15, Celecoxib Oral Solution 50 mg/mL showed 60% lower maximum  concentration 
following administration of celecoxib under fed conditions than those following administration under fasting conditions. Overall bioavailability in terms of AUC was comparable under fasting 
and fed conditions.  
A proof -of-concept, randomized, placebo- co
 ntrolled, DB, crossover study in patients with 
migraine headaches (with or without aura) showed an increased response with use of DFN -15, 
with the greatest response in the [ADDRESS_577504] at 120 mg.  
DFN- 15, Celecoxib Oral Solution 50 mg/mL was shown to be safe and well tolerated in all 
studies.  Subsequently, DFN -15 is
 now being developed as a 25 mg/mL oral solution and, 
considering the outcome from the proof of concept study, a dose of 120  mg for the active arm 
was selected for the Phase 3 studies . See the DFN-15 Investigator’s Brochure for additional 
information  on the completed studies .[ADDRESS_577505]. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd.  
DFN-15-CD-[ADDRESS_577506] s will be randomized to receive study drug 
(DFN- 15 or a matchi
ng placebo) as described in Section 5.1. Information about use of study 
drug, predos e and postdos e assessments , and any rescue medi
cation taken during the study 
will be recorded in the eDiary. For dosing information, see Section 7.1.  
8.4 Blinding  
In order to blind the study treatment,  study drug ki
ts with identical labeling appearance will be 
as
signed unique kit numbers by [CONTACT_452904] . 
This is a DB study. All randomization data will be kept stric tly confidential and accessible only to 
authorized personnel until the time of unblinding after database lock at the end of study . 
Blinding is critical to the integrity of this clinical study; however, in th e event of a medical 
emergency for an individual subject , in which knowledge of the treatment assignment is critical 
to the subject ’s management, the blind for the subject  may be broken by [CONTACT_737]  (or 
designee)  by [CONTACT_269289] . Before unblinding, the Investigator  (or designee)  should have 
determined that the treatment information is necessary to decide the subject ’s immediate 
management, and must make every effort to contact [CONTACT_452905]. In 
many cases, especially if the  emergency is clearly not related to study treatment, the problem 
may be properly managed without unblinding by [CONTACT_452906]. In cases of accidental unblinding or when the Medical Monitor cannot be contact[CONTACT_452907] e unblinding, the Medical Monitor should be contact[CONTACT_452908].

[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events  
Adverse Event D efinition 
An AE is 
defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject  administered a 
study
 drug  and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  A 
TEAE is an AE  with a start date on or after the initial dose of study drug  and up to [ADDRESS_577529] dose of study drug. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not related to the study drug. This includes an exacerbation of 
pre-existing conditions or events, intercurrent illnesses, drug interaction, or the significant 
worsening of the indication under investigation that is not recorded elsewhere in the eCRF . 
Anticipated fluctuations of pre- existing conditions, including the disease under study , that do not 
represent a clinically significant exacerbation or worsening need not be considered AEs . 
Migraine headaches will not be captured as AEs.  Migraine headaches will be captured by 
[CONTACT_452913] .  
For the purpose of the site’s data collection r
 esponsibilities, any untoward event that started or 
worsened after the ICF was signed until the final end- of-study visit (inclusive) is to be 
considered an AE.  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator  to document all AEs that  occur during the study. 
Adverse events  will be elicited by [CONTACT_63397]  a non- leading question, for example, “Have 
you experienced any new or changed symptoms since we last asked/since your last visit?”  
Adverse events  should be reported on the appropriate page of the eCRF .

DFN-15-CD-006  Protocol Amendment 1  Page 44 of 61 
CONFIDENTIAL  Assessment of Severity 
Each AE will be assigned a category by [CONTACT_322258]:  
Mild An AE that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423] , causes minimal 
discomfort , and does not interfere with everyday activities.  
Moderate  An AE that  is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal 
everyday activities; intervention may be needed.  
Severe  An AE that prevents normal everyday activities; treatment or other 
intervention usually needed.  
If there is a change in severity of an AE, it must be recorded as a separate event.  
Assessment of C ausality 
Every
 effort will be made by [CONTACT_737]  t o assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the 
study drug. Causality should be assessed using the categories presented in the following table:  
Not Related  The event is clearly due to extraneous causes (e .g., diseases, 
environment ), which should be s pecif ied if known ; or the event is 
most likely produced by [CONTACT_1605] ’s clinical 
state, therapeutic interventions , or concomitant therapy and does 
not follow a known response pattern to the study drug . 
Possibl y Related  The event is temporally related to study drug  use but can be 
explained by [CONTACT_11693]. Information on the effect of study 
product withdrawal may be lacking.  
Probabl y Related  The event is temporally related to study drug  use and is consistent 
with known effects of the study drug and/or improves upon 
withdrawal of the study drug . 
Definitely Related  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
study drug  administration and/or follows a known response pattern 
to the study drug and could not have been produced by [CONTACT_209790] s uch as the subject ’s clinical state, therapeutic intervention, 
or concomitant therapy and either occurs immediately following 
study drug  administration or improves on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_452885] a positive reaction at the application site.  
Action Taken  
The Investigator  will report  the act ion taken in the appropriate section of the eCRF , as follows:  
•Dose not changed
•Drug interrupted
•Drug withdrawn
•Not applicable
•Unknown

Documentation and Reporting of Adverse  Events 
Adverse events  will be reported and documented in accordance with the procedures outlined in 
this section. Adverse event s will be reported from the time of informed consent  through V4/ET 
and documented on the relevant eCRF  pages.  The following data should be documented for 
each AE:  
•Description of the symptom event
•Classificat
ion of “serious” or “not serious ”
•Severity
•Dat
e of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicabl e)
•Action taken
•Causal relationship
•Outcome of event (unknown, recovered, not yet recovered, recovered with sequelae,

dverse Events 
Serious Adverse Event Def
inition  
An S
AE is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that, at any  dose:  
•Results in death.
•Is life-threatening . An AE is life -threatening if the subject  is at immediate risk of deat h from
the event as it occurs (i.e., it does not include a reaction that might have caused death if it
had occurred in a more serious form) .
•Requires or prolongs i npatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. C omplicat ions occurring during
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_452886].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_122669] a pre -existing non -worsening
condition is not, however, considered an AE.  The details of such hospi[INVESTIGATOR_452887] .
•Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . An AE is inc apacitating or disabling
if it results in a substantial or  permanent disruption of the subject ’s ability to c arry out
normal life functions.
•Is a c ongenital anom aly/birth defect.
In addition, medical and scientific judgment  is required to  decide if prompt notification is required 
in situations other than those de fined for SAEs above (i.e. , any event that the Investigator  
regards as serious that did not strictly meet the criteria above but that may have jeopardiz ed the 
subject  or required intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, or that would

Unblinding Instructions 
Breaking the Blind 
The blind shoul

reports for submission to FDA.  
The unblinding procedures and follow -up will be perfo rmed in accordance with the protocol and 
the Sponsor’s standard operating procedures (SOPs). 
Blinding is critical to the integrity of this clinical study; however, in the event of a medical 
emergency for 
an individual subject, in which knowledge of the treatment assignment is critical 
to the subject’s management, the blind for the subject may be broken by [CONTACT_737] (or designee) by [CONTACT_269289]. Before unblinding, the Investigator (or designee) should have determined that the treatment information is necessary to decide the subject’s immediate 
management, and must make every effort to contact [CONTACT_452905]. In 
many cases, especially if the emergency is clearly not related to study treatment, the problem may be properly managed without unblinding by [CONTACT_452915]. In cases of  accidental unblinding or when the Medical Monitor cannot be contact[CONTACT_452916], the Medical Monitor should be contact[CONTACT_452908].  
If the blind is broken, the date, time, and reason must be recorded in the subject ’s source
  
record, eCRF, and any associated AE report.  
If an Investigator, site personnel performing assessments, or subject  is unblinded, the 
unbl
inding incident and unblinded subject  must be listed as a major protocol deviation.  
A subject  for whom the blind is broken will discontinue study drug and be scheduled f or a safety 
follow -up visit and then discontinued from the study. The subject  will be encouraged to stay in 
the study until the AE is resolved or stabilized.

CONFIDENTIAL  For all SAEs observed in the study considered to be drug related , a suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reaction ( S[LOCATION_003]R) will be reported by [CONTACT_452917]. All Investigators and the IRB will receive blinded reports. However, on the 
request of the IRB, the Sponsor will send unblinded reports directly to the IRB.  
Laboratory and Vital Signs Variables  
Vital signs and laboratory abnormalities should be reported as AEs if they are considered to be 
clinically signific
ant, as per the Investigator’s judgment. If an abnormal laboratory value is 
associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign/symptom should be reported as an AE , 
and the associated abnormal laboratory  result should be considered additional information.  
Pregnancy  
Although pregnancy is not an SAE, the procedures to report pregnancies will be the same as the procedures detailed 
above for reporting SAEs.  
Female subject s should not be pregnant  when entering  the study and must not become 
pregnant during the study; see Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for additional details. Following administration of 
study drug, any k
nown cases of pregnancy in female subject s or male subject s who impregnate 
their female partners will be reported to the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_577533] s will be withdrawn from the study and administration of study drug will be stopped. The 
pregnancy will be reported immediately by [CONTACT_80381]/emailing a completed Pregnancy Report to the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. The 
pregnancy will not be processed as an SAE; however , the Invest igator will follow the subject 
until completion of the pregnancy and must assess the outcome in the shortest possible time but not more than 30  days after completion of the pregnancy. The Investigator should notify the 
Sponsor (or designee) of the pregnancy outcome by [CONTACT_17258] a follow -up Pregnancy Report. If 
the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification of an SAE (e.g., spontaneous or therapeutic abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to 
be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator will report 
the event by [CONTACT_80381] a completed SAE form to the Sponsor (or designee) within [ADDRESS_577534]. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd.

CONFIDENTIAL  No overdoses of celecoxib were reported during clinical trials. Doses up to 2400 mg/day for up 
to 10 days in 12 patients did not result in serious toxicity. No information is available regarding 
the removal of celecoxib by [CONTACT_121264], but based on its high degree of plasma protein 
binding (> 97%) , dialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose.  
Subject s should be managed with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID 
overdosage; there are n
o specific antidotes. Consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 
100 grams in adults, 1 to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion or in subjec ts with a lar ge 
overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage). Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Unexpected Adverse Reactions  
Unexpected Adverse Reaction Def
inition  
An unexpected adverse 
reaction is any untoward and unintended response that is related to the 
administration of a
 study drug at any dose that is not consistent with the applicable product 
information (e.g., Investigator’s B rochure for an unauthorized study drug or approved 
prescribing information/summary of product characteristics for an authoriz ed product).  
All S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be subject to expedited report ing. The Sponsor  and/or  shall 
ensure that all relevant information about a S[LOCATION_003]R that is fatal or life -threatening is reported to 
the relevant competent authorities and the IRB  within [ADDRESS_577535] been issued for celecoxib : 
Do not use this product if you had an allergic reaction (including asthma), urticaria, or other 
allergic -type reactions af

CONFIDENTIAL  10 Statisti cal Methods  
The statistical analysis methods planned for this study are described below . Additional details 
will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be finalized before database 
lock and unblinding of the data . 
In general, descri ptive statistical methods will be used to summarize the data from this study , 
with hypothesis testing performed for the co-primary  and all secondary  efficacy endpoints . 
Unless stated otherwise, the term “descriptive statistics” refers to number of subject s (n), mean,  
median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for continuous data and frequencies and percentages for categorical data. The term “treatment group” refers to treatment assignment: 
DFN- [ADDRESS_577537]  number.  
All statistical analyses are described in Section 10.6. Unless specified otherwise, all statistical 
testing and  confidence 
intervals will be 2- sided and will be performed using a significance 
(alpha) level of 0.05.  
All statistical analyses will be conducted with the SAS® software package version 9.[ADDRESS_577538] ’s
  treatment assignment at 
database lock. This review will assess the accuracy and completeness of the study database, subject  evaluability, and appropriateness of the planned statistical methods.

DFN-15-CD-[ADDRESS_577540]-baseline efficacy assessment  for either pain or symptom (among nausea, photophobia, 
phonophobia) . Subjects in DB1 will be analyzed according to their randomized treatment. 
Subjects in DB2 will be analyzed according to their re- randomized treatment. The FAS will be 
used for all analyses of efficacy endpoints.  
Safety Population  
The safety population will include all subject s who rec eive at least one dose of DB study drug  
during one or both treatment periods  and have it recorded in their eDiary . Each DB treatment 
period will have a safety population which will include all subjects who were randomized in the 
DB treatment period and who received at least one dose of DB study drug during the treatment 
period. 
Additional info rmation is inc luded in the SAP. The SAP will serve as a compliment to the 
protocol and supersedes it in case of differences.

subject  reported more than one AE that was coded to the same SOC or PT, the subject  will be 
counted only once for that specific SOC or PT.  
An overview of AEs, which includes subject  incidence of TE AEs, headache or migraine- related 
TEAEs, study drug -related TEAEs, and SAEs, will be presented. The subject  incidence of 
TEAEs, headache - or migraine -related TEAEs, study drug- related TEAEs, and SAEs will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_3592].

Electrocardiograms, clinical laboratory data, and vital signs measurements will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_452920] (V2).  During the DB 
period, V2 will be considered as baseline, (i.e., the visit occurring just before treatment ). If a 
subject misses a V2 assessment but has a V1 assessment, V1 will be considered as baseline. All ECG data, clinical laboratory data, vital signs, physical examinations, study drug use, and 
concomitant medication use will also be presented in by -subject  data listings.

88% power to detect this assumed difference between placebo and DFN -15 at a 5% (2- sided) 
level of significance and with a 15% dropout rate. 
The second co- prima ry endpoint 
 is the comparison of the proportion of subjects who are free

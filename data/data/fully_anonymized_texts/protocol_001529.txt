and poorer health outcomes than persons without spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828]. For PwSCI, habitual 
exercise is c ritical for both physiological and psychological well -being. Prior research 
indicates that exercise programs conducted in a controlled setting have positive effects 
on the physical and psychosocial fitness of PwSCI, but the efficacy and feasibility of 
these programs are not well understood in community -based settings. PwSCI will be 
randomized to a 12 -week community -based exercise intervention (CBEI; n = 20) or an 
exercise education control group ( EEG; n  = 20). The proposed project aims to examine 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 5 potential health benefits in response to the intervention and identify the barriers and 
facilitators to successful implementation of a CBEI in PwSCI (N = 40).  
A2 Primary Hypothesis  
The community -based exercise group (CBEI) will have a 10% improvement in peak 
oxygen con sumption (VO2peak), upper extremity strength, body fat, cardiovascular risk 
profile (fasting plasma HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and insulin resistance), and 
psychological well -being (sleep, pain, fatigue, and depression) as compared to the 
exercise edu cation control group ( EEG ) post -intervention.  
A3 Purpose of the Study Protocol  
The purpose of the study is to examine the impact of a community -based exercise 
intervention for persons with spi[INVESTIGATOR_399458] -
being and identify barriers and facilitators to implementation.  
B Background  
B1 Prior Literature and Studies  
 
Background:  
SCI and exercise: Approximately 285,000 people in the US are living with an SCI. 1 
PwSCI are at a greater risk for heart disease, high blood pressur e, obesity, and diabetes 
than those without disabilities. 2-4 SCIs often result in various physiological alterations 
affecting multiple body systems, including blunted hemodynamics, altered sympathetic 
innervation, altered glycemic control, reduced active m uscle mass, deteriorated 
circulatory vessels below level of injury, and impaired arterial compliance and function. 5 
These pathophysiological alterations amplify the risk and prevalence of cardiovascular 
and metabolic diseases in PwSCI, 6-7 suggesting a grea t need for increased physical 
activity and fitness in this population. The typi[INVESTIGATOR_399459] -related changes; 
therefore, structured exercise activities are needed t o enhance physical capacity and to 
reduce the likelihood of secondary complications. 8-10 Increased cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_399460], but also improved 
cardiovascular and metabolic health. 7,11 
Exercise re commendations and barriers: Despi[INVESTIGATOR_399461], [ADDRESS_503570] levels of physical activity 
compared to other populations, 13-14 with fewer than 50% engaging in any physical 
activity, and onl y 15% engaging in physical activity sufficient to gain meaningful health 
benefits. 14-[ADDRESS_503571] 30 minutes of moderate -to-vigorous -intensity aerobic exercise 
three times per week to achieve cardio -metabolic health benefits. 16 Because of 
decreased sympathetic innervation, muscle atrophy, and decreased cardiac reserves, it 
is difficult for PwSCI to achieve these intensity levels without proper support. 12,17 There is 
a consid erable lack of accessible facilities, equipment, and support for PwSCI outside of 
rehabilitation, 18,22-25 and PwSCI also often lack knowledge of the types of exercise that 
will allow them to be successful in exercise. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_399462] (e.g., YMC A, 24 
Hour Fitness) generally do not provide the types of support necessary for PwSCI to 
successfully exercise. 24,26 More evidence is needed to identify effective exercise 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 6 interventions implemented outside of the rehabilitation setting that improve health for 
PwSCI. 27 
 
Preliminary Work: We have conducted two related studies that support this proposed 
project. The first was a single -arm design that assessed 284 PwD (63 PwSCI) who 
joined the Paraquad Health and Wellness Center (PQHWC), an accessible gym with 
equipment and staff to support PwD. Participants were encouraged to work on strength 
and endurance exercises but were not monitored. We compared participants’ weight, 
BMI, pain, endurance, and strength pre - and post - [ADDRESS_503572] 30 days and significant increases in four upper extremity strength exercises ( p < 
.05). No changes in body weight, BMI, or endurance were found. Limitations of this stu dy 
were the lack of control group for comparisons, lack of rigorous assessments to identify 
changes at the cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_399463], and lack of structure to adequately 
meet the physical activity guidelines for PwSCI. 28-29, 
 
The second study w as qualitative and involved interviews of seven active participants in 
the PQHWC and six staff members, [ADDRESS_503573] varied widely in their populations of focus, research designs, 
exercise protocols, and health outcomes. Many of these studies lack the rigorous 
designs, sample sizes, and testing needed to examine the effects of exercise on key 
health outcomes. 31,33  As a result, there is extensive variability in evaluation me thods 
among published studies. 31,34 Additionally, metabolic measures are not often included in 
studies based in the community. The proposed research is innovative because it 
addresses factors that often impede successful implementation of exercise for PwSC I in 
the community, follows the recommended guidelines, and uses sound measures.  
 
Cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -related diseases account for approximately 40% of mortality as the 
leading cause of death for PwSCI. 1, 35-36 For PwSCI, the decline in physical capacity and  
increased risk of secondary health conditions often result in reduced independence and 
participation in life activities. About 30% of PwSCI are re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_399464], with an average length of stay of [ADDRESS_503574] is its focus on a CBEI that uses accessible 
equipment and health professionals to implement multi -modal exercise programs that 
are individualized to each participant’s needs and meet recommended guidelines. This 
study h as the potential to establish a community -based model to be emulated in other 
settings.  
C Study Objectives  
C1 Primary Aim  
Primary Aim:  To estimate improvements in physical function, cardio -metabolic 
health, and psychological well -being of participants enrolled in a CBEI compared 
to an education -only control group.  
Forty PwSCI will be randomized into either the CBEI group or the EEG receiving 
education only. We will measure physical function (cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_399465]), cardio -metabolic health (body composition, glucose tolerance, and 
cardiovascular risk profile), and psychological well -being (PROMIS). We hypothesize 
that the CBEI  will have a 10% improvement in peak oxygen consumption (VO 2peak), 
upper extremity strength, body fat, cardiovascular risk profile (fasting plasma HDL 
cholesterol, triglycerides, and insulin resistance), and psychological well -being (sleep, 
pain, fatigue, and depression) as compared to the EEG post -intervention.  
C2 Secondary Aim  
Secondary Aim:  To identify barriers, facilitators, and reasons for positive 
determinants for PwSCI to exercise in a community -based setting.  
We will use a mixed methods approach to characterize key implementation outcomes: 
acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity. Information will be gathered during the i ntervention 
using activity monitors, heart rate monitors, and rating scales to identify whether 
exercise intensity rates were met. Participants will be interviewed for the purposes of 
comparing the experience of participants who experienced change and thos e who did 
not. This information will enable us to determine the degree to which the pi[INVESTIGATOR_49152]’s success or failure was related to implementation outcomes and to inform 
the development of a future R01 -funded clinical trial. We hypothesize that the 
intervention will be accepted among PwSCI, feasible to implement, and that delivery of 
the intervention will adhere to the exercise intervention protocol (fidelity).  
C3 Rationale for the Selection of Outcome Measures  
The primary outcome variables for this  randomized controlled trial  (RCT) include: 
cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863]  (VO 2peak and [ADDRESS_503575]), pain (Wong -Baker FACES), 
metabolic health (blood chemistries), body composition ( dual-energy x -ray 
absorptiometry [DXA] scan, height, weight, BMI), vitals  (heart rate and blood pressure) , 
and psychosocial well -being (PROMIS -29 Profile). These variables are significantly 
impacted by [CONTACT_399479], which are highly common among manual 
wheelchair users ( MWUs ) with SCI. MWUs with SCI also exhibit  and report values of 
some of these variables below healthy range, potentially impacting physiological health 
and psychosocial well -being and overall quality of life. Secondary outcome variables

E Study Design  
E1 Overview  or Design Summary  
The proposed project utilizes a mixed -methods approach. An experimental strategy 
using an RCT (single -blinded) will be used . Forty participants (n  = 40) will be randomized 
into the CBEI (n = 20) or the EEG (n = 20) by a research staff member who will not be 
involved in either conducting outcome assessments or implementation of the 
intervention. This design will assist in reducing variability and maximizing the effect size 
for powering a subsequent larger RCT .  
 
The intervention for p articipants in the CBEI will consist of one -on-one, formally directed 
exercise sessions by [CONTACT_399480]. The CBEI is based on the recent 
evidence -based exercise guideline for PwSCI, 14 American College of Sports Medic ine’s 
(ACSM) Physical Activity Recommendations for PwSCI, [ADDRESS_503576] available evidence, 39-41 
and preliminary work. 30 The intervention will include 36 60 –90-minute sessions over 12 
weeks (three sessions/week) with a goal of participants guiding their own exerc ise 
regimens by [CONTACT_399481]. Personalized exercise sessions will be created 
for each participant based on fitness goal(s), preferred exercise equipment, and results 
from their initial assessment. Participants will be educated on how equipme nt works and 
what exercises are appropriate, and will be guided on intensity levels. At the beginning 
of each session, vitals and pain [ADDRESS_503577] 30 minutes three times a week of moderate -to-
vigorous exercise, 16,29 as determined by a report of 12 or higher  on the Borg’s Rate of 
Perceived Exertion (RPE) Scale (6 –20). 43-44 Due to altered sympathetic innervation in 
PwSCI, 5 target heart rate may not be reliable; therefore, RPE will be the real -time 
determinate of intensity. Activity monitors (GT9X Actigraph, Pe nsacola, FL) will be 
donned to capture intensity data to be processed post hoc. Each participant will then 
complete a 3 –5-minute cool -down. After cardiovascular training, each participant will 
complete strength training geared toward their goals, with guid ance from PQHWC staff 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 9 to perform a comprehensive variety of strength exercises to promote fat -free mass, 
muscle endurance, and overall strength. Staff will set up and monitor strength training to 
ensure that, for each exercise, participants perform at leas t two to three sets of 10 –15 
repetitions (reps) at 50% –75% one -rep max (1RM) for each exercise targeting 
functioning muscle groups. 16,29  After strength training, participants will complete a 5 –[ADDRESS_503578] worked in an 
exercise se tting with PwSCI. S taff will be taught the exercise guidelines 16,29  and exercise 
session protocols using written materials, demonstrat ion, and practice sessions.  
Following each exercise intervention session, participants will describe what they liked 
and did not like, provide a rating (1 –5) of how much they gained from the session, and 
answer an open -ended item requesting suggestions for  improvement. At the end of each 
session, the trainer will rate the participant’s perceived participation during the session 
(1–6) using the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_399466]. 45 
 
The participants in the EEG will complete an intervention that co nsists of a one-on-one, 
hour-long educational session orienting participants to an online resource center, the 
National Center on Health, Physical Activity, and Disability (NCHPAD). NCHPAD 
promotes health and well -being for PwD through resources such as ad apted exercise 
videos, information on accessible fitness equipment, personalized exercise videos 
tailored to PwD, and an individualized [ADDRESS_503579] Selection and Withdrawal

 [ADDRESS_503581] Recruitment Plans and Consent Process  
Potential participants may either be approached or identified by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_399467]’s 
waiting list , or potential participants may contact [CONTACT_399482] a study flyer posted 
within com munity and rehabilitation facilities. The study coordinator may describe the 
study with participants over the telephone or in person and , if they are interested , verbal 
consent will be obtained to continue with the screening document. This process will be 
the same for all populations , as the randomization does not occur until after the first 
assessment is completed. After the screening document is complete, the study 
coordinator will obtain medical referrals from the participant’s physician(s); once 
permiss ion from the participant’s physician (s) is received, the participant will be 
contact[CONTACT_399483]. Prior to the scheduled initial assessment, a copy of the written consent 
form ma y be mailed to the potential participants so they may have time to review it, 
become familiar with it, and prepare any questions they may have. The study 
coordinator may also contact [CONTACT_399484] 24 –[ADDRESS_503582] any and all questions addressed. 
Potential participants will then be asked to initial, sign, and date the form, as necessary, 
prior to participating further in the initial assessment.  
2.d Randomization Method and Blinding  
Randomization does not occur until after the initial assessment is completed. 
Immediately following completion of the initial assessment, each participant will be 
randomly assigned to either the CBEI (n = 20) or EEG (n = 20). To control for selection 
bias, stratified randomization will be used to ensure that the CBEI  and EEG are 
balanced with respect to how long the participant has been injured (<2 years or ≥2 
years), the participant’s level of injury (below C7 or C7 and above), age (< 40 years or 
≥40 years of age), and gender. This will control for a large imbalance of parti cipants 
allocated to one intervention. Research staff performing the assessments will be blinded 
to group randomization.  
2.e Risks and Benefits  
Risks:  
A likely or common mild risk that may occur from participating in the testing sessions 
and/or participating in any exercise program for [ADDRESS_503583] a physician’s referral to participate in this study ; in addition , a hear t rate 
monitor and accelerometers will be worn during selected testing and exercise sessions 
(if assigned to the CBEI) to ensure accurate monitoring of their health status. They  will 
also be educated about the proper and safe way to exerc ise before the stu dy begins. For 
CBEI  participants, trained research members will be present during all sessions to 
ensure participant  safety. Proper precautions to avoid injury, including stretching and 
rest breaks , will be employed to reduce the risk of soft tissue damage .  
Another risk to participants include s potentially dangerous conditions associated 
with SCI, such as autonomic dysreflexia , during assessments and exercise training. 
However, this is a very small risk. All research team members are familiar with serious 
conditions, such as autonomic dysreflexia, and medical precautions to monitor any life -
threatening conditions will be taken during testing and training. In the highly unlikely 
event a participant experiences a medical emergency, immediate appropriate actio ns will 
be taken by [CONTACT_3647].  
 
Benefits:  
Participants may or may not benefit from being in this study. Participants may directly 
benefit by:  
 Increasing their ability to exercise and function in the community  
 Improving their cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_399468]  
 Improving their psychological well -being  
 Increasing their physical fitness  
 Receiving new and valuable information about exercise recommendations and 
their health  
2.f Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
Participants (CBEI or E EG) will be withdrawn if  they are non -compliant with the exercise 
program specific to their group assignment (miss >30% of visits in a particular month) or 
if they experience a medical complication that prohibits exercise.  
2.g When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
The research coordinat or of the study is primarily responsible for scheduling testing and 
exercise  sessions for participants. The research coordinator will also be in weekly 
contact [CONTACT_399485]/compliance of  CBEI  participants. If deemed that a participant is non -
compliant with the exercise program protocol, the research coordinator will contact [CONTACT_399486]/her of the withdraw policy. If the participant remains non -
compliant over the following two weeks, he/she will be withdrawn by [CONTACT_399487].  
2.h Data Collection and Follow -up for Withdrawn Subjects  
Whether participants withdraw voluntarily or are withdrawn by [CONTACT_3647], they may 
be asked to complete a close -out visit (in -person or on the phone) to provide the 
research team with feedback regarding why they decided to leave the study early/not 
comply with the program.

potential participants via phone 24 –[ADDRESS_503586] any and all questions addressed. Potential participants will then be 
asked to initial, sign, and date the form, as necessary, prior to participating further in the 
initial assessment.  Once written consent is obtained, all participants will complete the 
initial assessment.  
 
The initial assessment (T1) will be completed over two separate days , with the second 
day ( D2) being completed within [ADDRESS_503587] assessment day (D1).  
 
Procedures for Day 1 of Initial Assessment (T1D1):  
T1D1 (90 –120 minutes) will be completed at Washington University’s EMC  research 
laboratory, located within the Paraquad Health and Wellness Center building. During this 
appointment, participants will complet e many  self-report measures. These measures will 
assess: demographics  (CORE) , psychosocial factors  (PROMIS –fatigue,  depression, 
pain, sleep, and emotional support ), physical activity (LTPAQA -SCI, ESE S, and RM -4), 
and community participation ( CPI). Particip ants will also be asked to perform functional 
mobility (6MPT) , strength testing (BTE and Equalizer) , and a cardiovascular fitness test  
(VO 2peak) . Resting blood pressure and heart rate, height, weight, and body mass index 
will also be measured on T1D1. The participants may be asked to wear a heart rate 
monitor and accelerometers to measure their intensity level s during testing.  
 
Self-Report Assessments:  
Characteristics of Respondents (CORE):  The following data will be collected via 
the CORE: demographics (a ge, gender, race, employment status, and highest level of 
education completed), diagnosis, neurological level of injury, time since onset of injury, 
general health status, secondary health conditions, medications, and mobility device 
used. 17  
PROMIS  Measur es: The PROMIS  measures will be used  to assess s ix different 
domains: emotional distress, emotional support, sleep, pain interference, pain intensity , 
and fatigue . Individuals respon d to the items in each domain using a five -point Likert 
scale. The s ix domains are scored individually . 
 
Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire for People with SCI (LTPAQ -SCI):  
The LTPAQ -SCI is a self -report measure of leisure time physical activity that assesses 
minutes of mild, moderate, and heavy intensity activity over  the previous seven days. 
The survey will be collected during screening to determine eligibility.   
 
The SCI Exercise Self -Efficacy Scale (ESES):  The ESES is a 10 -item, SCI - 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 14 specific scale developed to measure perceived exercise self -efficacy for various ty pes of 
physical activities. The scale requires individuals to self -report their confidence in 
performing physical activities and exercise. One dichotomous item asks whether the 
individual has exercised at home and/or in a gym in the past 12 months. Individ uals 
respond to the 10 items using a four -point Likert scale (1: not at all true, 4: always true); 
the total score is then derived by [CONTACT_399488]; scores 
range from 10 to 40. Higher scores indicate greater perceived self -efficacy. The 
dichotomous item is used to estimate the participant’s average exercise activity.  
 
Community Participation Index (CPI):  The CPI [CONTACT_832] a valid and reliable assessment 
of involvement in life situations and individual control over participation. 46-47 For each 
item, respondents rate frequency (either in days, hours, or times per week, depending 
on the activity), whether it was important (yes/no), and to what extent they do the item 
(too much, enough, or not enough). The measure is used as a categorical  variable using 
validated scores. Participation will be assessed at baseline and both follow -up 
assessments to determine the level of change in participation for each MWU with SCI.  
 
RM 4 -FM: Motivation for Physical Activity and Exercise/Working Out: This 
questionnaire is designed to a ssess whether the participants are extrinsically or 
intrinsically motivated to engage in a physical activity. The questionnaire makes a 
statement of “I try, or would like to try, to be physical active regularly ,” and participa nts 
must  rate themselves on a Likert scale between 1 (not true at all), to 7 (very true).  
 
 
Physical Assessments:  
VO 2peak : Measured using a standard computer -integrated, open -circuit, breath -
by-breath metabolic measurement system (TrueOne 2400, Parvo Medi cs, Sandy, UT, 
US) while the participant performs a graded -exercise test on an  arm crank ergometer  
(ACE), (SCIFIT PRO2 ,  Life Fitness, Tulsa, OK, US). In addition, an H7 Heart Rate 
Sensor (Polar Electro Inc., Lake Success, NY, US) will be placed on each pa rticipant to 
monitor heart rate during testing. Each participant will be fitted with a silicone mask to 
cover his or her mouth and nose while performing the exercise test, which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_399469] 8 –12 minutes depending on the participant’s fitness level. 8 The protocol 
involves a 3-minute warm -up at a workload of 8 –10 watts (W) followed by a standard 
ACE ramp protocol. The ramp protocol requires participants to maintain 60 revolutions 
per minute (rpm) with incremental increases by 7 W every minute, u ntil exhaustion.  
 
Muscle Strength:  The participants’ muscle strength will be tested using Equalizer  
accessible exercise equipment to establish their one -repetition maximum (1 -RM) on four 
upper -body exercises tested on each arm (left and right arm bicep cu rls, left and right 
arm chest press, left and right arm rowing, and left and right arm rickshaw triceps 
extension). Each exercise represents a different motion (pushing or pulling) in varying 
planes. For example, the rickshaw exercise involves pushing down ward on straps 
connected to weights. Upon completion of one repetition during the strength 
assessment, the participants will report their arm movements as easy , moderate , or 
hard. The greatest amount of weight lifted for the complete range of motion for th e lift will 
be recorded as the [ADDRESS_503588] (6MPT):  The 6MPT is a functional mobility and physical 
fitness test involving MWUs pr opelling a designated 30 -meter loop. Participants are 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 15 asked to propel as far as possible on the course within 6 minutes. Total distance 
propelled is determined by [CONTACT_399489] 30 -meter loops and 
measuring the partially completed final l ap using a tape measure. 22  
 
Anthropometrics and Vitals:  Body mass will be measured by [CONTACT_201098], weight 
(using a wheelchair accessible scale), and BMI. Resting and post -testing blood pressure 
and heart rate will also be taken at each testing session.  
 
Quali tative Data:  After completion of the 12 -week sessions, participants will complete  
a 60-minute, semi -structured interview. Interviews will be conducted by [CONTACT_399490]. 48-50 A protocol for facilitating intervie ws will be 
developed with specific key questions. A sample question is, “Did this community -based 
exercise intervention support your ability to participate in a regular exercise routine?” 
Interviews will be recorded, and notes will be taken to assist in id entifying main themes.  
 
 
Procedures at for Day 2 of Initial Assessment (T1D2):  
T1D2 (60 minutes) will be completed at the Center for Applied Research Sciences 
(CARS) Clinical Research Unit (C RU), which is established within the Institute of Clinical 
and Tr anslational Sciences. T1D2 will consist of a blood draw (metabolic blood 
chemistries) and a DXA body scan (body composition). Prior to D2, participants will be 
instructed to fast the night before (8 –10 hours). Trained CARS staff will conduct blood 
draws an d DEXA scan s and assist participants, as needed, during T1D2. Research staff 
may also be present during T1D2 at CARS to assist participants, as needed.  
 
Body Composition:   
Body compostion will be quantified by [CONTACT_11324] (General Electric Lunar iDXA) located at t he 
WUSM CRU . DXA is commonly used in research due to its precision and safety. Bone 
mineral density and whole -body , regional fat, and fat -free (i.e., lean) mass in kg and % 
will be calculated.  Appendicular skeletal muscle mass will be estimated from these data 
as described and validated by [CONTACT_155358]. 51  
 
Metabolic Blood Chemistries:   
Fasting blood values will be obtained for markers of inflammation (hsCRP), insulin 
resistance (HOMA -IR using fasting glucose and  insulin concentrations), complete blood 
cell counts (CBC), fasting lipid/lipoproteins (triglycerides, total -, LDL -, HDL -cholesterol), 
and glycosylated hemoglobin (a marker of glycemic control) at T1 and T2. To explore 
neurogenesis mechanisms, we will quan tify plasma BDNF, IGF -1, and VEGF using 
ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). 52-[ADDRESS_503589] 
the night before (8 –10 hours). Upon arrival to the CRU after the overnight fast, blood will 
be collected from the antecubital ve in. Blood will be collected with preservatives and 
stored in [CONTACT_399494]’s laboratory located in [ADDRESS_503590] Building on the Washington 
University School of Medicine Campus. Serum and plasma will be aliquoted into 
individual vials and frozen (−80o C) until  all participants have completed the study 
intervention .

F6 Safety and Adverse Even ts  
6.a Safety and Compliance Monitoring  
The research coordinator is the primary scheduler for initial and post -assessments and 
CBEI e xercise sessions ; therefore , she will daily monitor assessments and CBEI safety, 
compliance, and progress. The research coordi nator will also be in weekly contact [CONTACT_399491].  
 
Medical Monitoring : 
There will be a physican who will provide medical monitoring of the body composition 
and me tabolic blood chemistry appointments.  
i Investigator only  
 
ii Independent expert to monitor  
Not applicable  
iii Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Board  
To ensure that participants are medically stable and safe to participate in the project , 
physician’s approv al and a signed release will be required prior to the initial assessment. 
During assessment and exercise sessions, participants will be monitored for safety, pain , 
and any signs of distress. Heart rate monitors will be worn during the VO2 testing. Blood 
pressure will be taken at the beginning of all testing and intervention sessions . If a 
participant reports an 8/10 pain level prior to a session, the session will be canceled and 
rescheduled . If at the end of a session the participant reports pain 8/10 or hi gher, the 
rating will be documented in the study’s adverse event tracking log. Participants may be 
dismissed from participation if they rate pain 8/10 or higher over three consecutive 
sessions. Trained research investigators will be present during all sess ions to ensure 
participant safety. If a participant is uncomfortable with having their blood drawn for 
metabolic testing, they may choose to skip that portion and still continue within the study. 
All members of the research team are familiar with potential ly dangerous conditions 
associated with SCI, such as autonomic dysreflexia, and will take appropriate actions if a

 17 participant experiences a medical emergency. Adverse event s will be reported to the 
IRB consistent with the IRB’s reporting guidelines . We wi ll take every precaution to 
ensure participant safety while avoiding risks.  
Safeguarding of data:  Researchers will assign  participants a code to de -identify 
all data according to HIPAA policies. Data will be stored in a password -protected 
computer to guar antee participant privacy. To ensure quality of data collection, a 
research member will oversee each pi[INVESTIGATOR_502] (i.e., Metabolic cart, heart rate 
monitor , and accelerometers ) for immediate detection of technological malfunctions 
during sessions.

G3  Analysis Plan  
The proposed project utilizes a mix ed method approach. The Primary Aim  is an 
experimental strategy using a n RCT method to estimate improvements in physical 
function, cardio -metabolic health, and psychological well -being of participants enrolled in 
a community -based exercise intervention com pared to an education -only control group  
on people with SCI. This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_399471] a larger study with longer -term fo llow-up assessments. The proposed project utilizes  
a mixed methods approach , with the Secondary Aim  being both quantitative and 
qualitative in nature to eval uate the feasibility of the  intervention and evaluate the 
methods of delivery from the perspective of the research staff conducting and monitoring 
exercise sessions and the participants regarding the enrollment, assessment, and 
acceptance, adherence, and tolerance of the intervention protocol.   
G4  Statistical Methods  
Aim 1:  Data will be collected and man aged using Research Electronic Data Capture 
(REDCap) and exported to SPSS for analysis. Descriptive statistics will be used to 
describe the CBEI  and the EEG. The data will be examined for normality, outliers, and 
errors. To examine whether the datasets mee t the assumptions of normality, a Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152] -
Wilks test will be conducted. The assumptions of homogeneity of variance and 
homogeneity of covariance will be examined with Box’s M and Mauchly’s W tests, 
respectively. To examine the presence of outliers, histogr ams will be used. The purpose 
of the analysis is to compare the post VO 2peak measures (primary outcome) between 
the two groups. First, a two sample t test (or non -parametric Wilcoxon test) will be used 
for unadjusted analyses. Then we will use a linear reg ression to compare VO 2peak 
between the CBEI  and EEG, adjusting for pre -VO 2peak measures and other potential 
covariates. For other outcomes, based on the measurement scale, a similar analysis 
approach (unadjusted and adjusted) will be used. For binary outco mes, a Pearson Chi -
square or fisher exact test will be used for unadjusted analyses, and a logistic regression 
model will be used for adjusted analyses. For continuous outcomes, we will perform 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 [ADDRESS_503595] size (d) 
associated with the intervention will be calculated using Cohen's d and will be interpreted 
as small (d ≤ .2), moderate (d ~ .5), or large (d ≥ .8). We will explore whether results 
differ depending on level of SCI and length of time livin g with a n SCI. We will use 
dummy variables for these two variables and test the interaction term (intervention -by-
the-dummy) in the model.  
 
Aim 2:  We will use descriptive statistics to report on scales collected during and after 
sessions to further underst and acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity. Our qualitative 
interviews will allow us to further explore whether patterns can be identified in 
participants who achieved improvement versus those who did not and those who 
dropped out of the study. Interview  data will be transcribed, processed using NVivo, and 
analyzed using an adaptation of grounded theory analysis, which will include four steps 
to be employed iteratively: (1) open coding, in which particular concepts in the 
transcripts are identified and gr ouped into categories; (2) axial coding, in which 
categories are associated and related by [CONTACT_233664], actions/interactions, and 
consequences; (3) process coding, in which concepts and categories are examined in 
changing circumstances; and (4) selective co ding, in which conceptual models and 
theories are developed, integrated, and refined.  
G5 Missing Outcome Data  
Only complete, valid data will be included in group analysis for each outcome measure 
for each participant. While missing outcome measure data will b e excluded from group 
analysis, individual incomplete, invalid,  or missing data may be analyzed  on a case -by-
case basis to potentially further inform the study process and explain participant 
outcomes.

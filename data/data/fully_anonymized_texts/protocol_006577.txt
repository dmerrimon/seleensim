  2. Protocol Synopsis  
PROTECTED TAVR : Stroke PROTECT ion with S Entinel During Transcatheter 
Aortic Valve Replacement  
Study 
Objective  The objective of this study is to demonstrate that use of the Sentinel® 
Cerebral Protection System significantly reduces the risk of peri -
procedural stroke (≤72 hours) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).  
Indications  
for Use  The Sentinel® Cerebral Protection System is indicated for use as a 
cerebral protection device to capture and remove embolic material while performing transcatheter aortic valve procedures in order to reduce ischemic injury to the brain peri-procedurally.  
Commercial Device Applied as Standard of Care (Test Cohort) Commercially available Sentinel
® Cerebral Protection System 
(Sentinel; [LOCATION_011] Scientific Corporation, Marlborough, MA, [LOCATION_003]) 
Note  1: In the Test cohort, subjects will undergo TAVR with 
Sentinel.  The participating investigator must be a trained, 
experienced Sentinel user.  
Control 
Applied as Standard of Care (Control Cohort) Subjects in the Control cohort will undergo TAVR with no cerebral protection device. 
Study Design PROTECTED TAVR is a prospective, post- market, multicenter  
randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating use of  the Sentinel 
Cerebral Protection System  in subjects with aortic valve stenosis 
who are treated with a commercially available TAVR device . 
Subjects to be treated via a transfemoral approach will be 
randomized 1:[ADDRESS_1190335] who provides an Informed Consent Form (ICF) signed by [CONTACT_29159]’s legally authorized representative is considered enrolled in the study upon randomization, which will occur at the index procedure prior to procedural puncture/incision . 
enrolled subjects will be followed through [ADDRESS_1190336]  (see Additional Measurements 
below for information regarding subjects with sus pected stroke) .  
An overview of the study design is shown below. Every subject must 
be deemed treatable with the Sentinel device (have suitable anatomy

per the Sentinel Instructions For Use [I FU]). All eligible subjects 
(see below)  should be approached for participation in the trial. 
 
PROTECTED TAVR Study Design Overview  
An initial enrollment of up to [ADDRESS_1190337] 70% of enrolled subjects by [CONTACT_854755]. The study will be stopped if a significant 
difference in favor of the test arm is observed. If the study cannot be 
stopped after the interim analysis, sample size re -estimation may be 
performed as discussed  below (see Statistical Methods) . A final 
analysis will be performed on all enrolled subjects if the trial is not 
stopped after the interim analysis.  
The PROTECTED TAVR study will be conducted in accordance 
with 21 CFR Parts  11, 50, and 54; the relevant parts of the 
International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guidelines for Good Clinical Practices (GCP); the International Standard ISO [ZIP_CODE] Clinical Investigation of Medical Devices for Human Subjects – Good Clinical Practice; ethical principles that have their 
origins in the Declaration of Helsinki; and pertinent individual country/state/local laws and regulations. The study shall not begin until the required approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_30757] (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/H uman 
Research Ethics Committee (HREC)  and/or regulatory authority has 
been obtained, if appropriate. 
Planned Number of Subjects  An initial enrollment of  up to 3000  randomized subjects is planned . 
If sample size re- estimation is needed (see Statistical Methods 
below), the planned maximum enrollment will be up to 6000 randomized subjects.

The planned initial enrollment  of 3000 subjects  is expected to be 
completed in approximately 30 months; therefore, the study duration 
is estimated to be less than 32 months (see Note  3 below). 
Note that enrollment may be extended based on the planned interim 
analysis (see Statistical Methods below).  
Participant Duration The study duration for each subject is expected to be through [ADDRESS_1190341] TAVR procedure (whichever comes first) .

EC6.  Subject is contraindicated for anticoagulant and antiplatelet 
therapy. 
Note  4: Use of general anesthesia during TAVR may affect 
neurocognitive function shortly after the procedure. While not an 
exclusion criterion, i t is recommended that general anesthesia not be 
used if possible.  
Adjunctive Pharmacologic Therapy  Management of subjects in both groups, including antiplatelet and 
anticoagulant medications, is left to the discretion of the treating physician. 
Statistical Methods  
Analysis Sets  Analysis sets are listed below.  
Intention -To-Treat (ITT) : This population includes all subjects who 
sign an ICF and are enrolled in the trial (randomized), whether or not the assigned treatment is received.  
Per-Protocol: This population includes all ITT subjects who undergo 
TAVR and who are treated as assigned in the randomization process (excludes crossovers).  
Statistical Hypothesis for the Primary Endpoint  The rate of the primary endpoint (all stroke through [ADDRESS_1190345] TAVR procedure or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] [whichever comes first] as adjudicated by [CONTACT_15731] ) in the Sentinel (Test) cohort is 
superior to that in the Control cohort . 
Statistical Test Method for the Primary Endpoint  A chi -square test will be used to test the two -sided hypothesis of 
superiority of Sentinel versus the Control:  
 H
0: PSentinel  = P Control  
 H 1: PSentinel  ≠ P Control   
where PSentinel  and P Control correspond to the rates of the primary 
endpoint for the Sentinel group (test) and the Control group (no cerebral protection), respectively.  
The primary analysis set is the ITT analysis set; this endpoint wi ll 
also be analyzed for the Per-Protocol analysis set.  
Sample Size Parameters for the Primary Endpoint  Sample size parameters are listed below.  
• Expected Control rate P Control : 4% 
• Expected Sentinel (test) rate PSentinel : 2% (50% relative reduction)

• Test significance level ( α): 0.05 (2 -sided)  
• Power (1−β): > 0.90 (see Note  5 below)  
• Test to Control ratio : 1:1 (see Note  6 below) 
• Number of evaluable subjects: Maximum enrollment of up to 
6000 with sample size re -estimationd 
• Planned enrollment: 3000 (N=1500 per cohort) 
The statistical approach uses an adaptive group sequential design . 
There will be [ADDRESS_1190346] 
70% of enrolled  subjects  (N=2100) by [CONTACT_854755]. The study will be stopped if a significant 
difference in favor of the test arm is observed  after this interim 
analysis. Based on the results of the interim analysis, sample size re-
estimationd may be performed and the sample size may be increased 
up to a maximum of 6000 subjects.  Details of this adaptive approach  
are pre-specified in the Independent Safety and Statistical Monitor 
charter. A final analysis will be performed on all enrolled subjects if 
the study is not stopped after the interim analysis.  
Note  5: Power calculation includes sample size re- estimationd 
Note  6: To avoid selection/treatment bias, randomization will occur 
at the index procedure  (prior to procedural puncture/incision).

  4. Introduction  
This protocol  specifies procedures and contains information relevant to the postmarket 
multicenter PROTECTED TAVR randomized controlled trial ( PROTECTED TAVR: Stroke 
PROTECT ion with SE ntinel During T ranscatheter Aortic Valve Replacement ). The study 
device is the Sentinel® Cerebral Protection System  (Sentinel) designed and manufactured by 
[CONTACT_5708], Marlborough, MA, [LOCATION_003] (BSC). It is a percutaneously 
delivered filter device designed to capture any debris or thrombus that may embolize to the 
innominate and left common carotid arteries  during a transcatheter aortic valve replacement 
(TAVR)  procedure. The objective of the study is to demonstrate that use of Sentinel 
significantly reduces the risk of post- TAVR peri-procedural (≤72  hours) stroke. 
4.1. Background 
Stroke is a feared occurrence that can complicate both surgical and catheter -based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_854730]1,2. With first generation TAVR devices, the reported incidence of major  
stroke within 30 days ranged from 3% to 7%3. Increased short- term and long- term mortality 
have been associated with post- TAVR stroke4,5. Growing  operator experience and improved 
device designs have lowered but not eliminated the TAVR stroke risk6. 
Cerebral embolic protection devices (CEPD) are intended to prevent cerebral embolization and have demonstrated efficacy in carotid and saphenous vein graft stenting with clinically significant reductions in mortality, stroke, and myocardial infarction
7-9. Use of CEPD is an 
emerging strategy to mitigate post-TAVR neurologic risk10 and 5 randomized controlled 
trials  (RCT)  have directly investigated the safety  and efficacy  of CEPD in TAVR (protection 
device s include  the Sentinel® Cerebral Protection System  [Sentinel], Claret Montage™ Dual 
Filter System  [an earlier iteration of Sentinel], TriGuard ™ HDH Embolic Deflection Device , 
and EMBOL- X™ Intra -aortic Filter)11-15. Four of these RCTs assessed [ADDRESS_1190356]  (TriGuard; N=85 ), the primary safety endpoint (death, 
stroke, life -threatening or disabling bleeding, stage 2 or 3 acute kidney injury, or major 
vascular co mplications) was numerically lower in the protected cohort (21.7% versus 30.8%, 
P=0.34)14. Subjects with complete three-vessel cerebral coverage had fewer new neurologic 
deficits detected by [CONTACT_854761] (NIHSS; 3.1% vs. 15.4%) and a >2 -fold increase in recovery of normal cognitive function (Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment [MoCA] score >26) at [ADDRESS_1190357] (N= 30), use of EMBOL-
X appeared to reduce both the incidence and volume of new cerebral lesions
15. In another 
single- center  RCT (CLEAN- TAVI ; N=100), use of Claret Montage was associated with a 
significant reduction ( P < 0.001) in the number of new lesions13. In the multicenter 
MISTRAL -C RCT (N=65), use of Sentinel resulted in fewer new lesions and a smaller total 
lesion volume as well as less neurocognitive deterioration ( 4% vs. 27%, P=0.017)12.  
The pi[INVESTIGATOR_854731] (N=363) than the aforementioned RCTs 
and showed that Sentinel  use during TAVR was safe with no increased procedural 
complications11. Subjec ts were  prospectively randomized 1:1:1 into a safety arm  (N=123, 
Sentinel only) and 2 imaging cohorts (device arm [N=121] and control arm without Sent inel 
[N=119]). The primary safety endpoint was 30-day major adverse cardiac and

  cerebrovascular events (MACCE ; defined as all death, all stroke, and stage 3 acute kidney 
injury  [AKI] per Valve Academic Research Consortium [VARC -2] definitions16). Stroke 
occurrence was assessed by [CONTACT_854762] (mRS) score as administered 
by a neurologist. In the combined safety and device arms, the MACCE rate of 7.3% was non-
inferior ( P < 0.001) to the prespecified perf ormance goal of 18.3% and similar to the control 
rate ( 9.9% ; P=0.41). As Sentinel is a temporary accessory device, a post hoc analysis was 
performed to assess stroke at the time most applicable to device usage. The stroke rate at 
≤72 hours was 3.0% in the combined safety and device arms compared to 8.2% in the c ontrol 
arm, demonstrating  a relative reduction of 63% in stroke rates in favor of Sentinel. At 
[ADDRESS_1190358] s with Sentinel were similar to rates in the control arm for 
mortality  (1.3% vs. 1.8%, respectively, P =0.25), stroke (5.6% vs. 9.1%, P =0.25), stage 3 
AKI (0.4% vs. 0.0%, P =1.00), and major vascular complications (8.6% vs. 5.9%, P =0.53).  
The primary efficacy endpoint in the SENTINEL RCT was reduction in median total new 
lesion  volume in protected territories  in the device versus the control arm . This w as assessed 
by [CONTACT_35774]-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) at 2 to 7 days after TAVR.  This 
quantitative MRI analysis was intended to serve as a surrogate endpoint for the clinically 
meaningful endpoint of stroke. While the median total new lesion volume in protected territories was 42% lower in subjec ts with Sentinel, the new MRI lesion volume (102.8 mm
3) 
was not significantly different from that of the control group (178.0 mm3, P=0.33). Notably, 
randomization was not stratified by [CONTACT_854763]. Post -
hoc multivariable analyses of MRI data also indicated that the T2/fluid -attenuated inversion 
recovery (FLAIR) lesion volume  at baseline, a marker of previous injury and gliosis, was the 
strongest predictor of new lesion volume after TAVR. After adjusting for valve type, baseline T2/FLAIR lesion volume, and an interaction between valve type and treatment arm, there were significant reductions in new lesion volume in the device versus control arms (protected territories: P=0.025, all territories: P=0.050)
11. Debris  was found within the study 
device filters in 99% of subjects in the SENTINEL RCT. The debris components  included 
acute thrombus with tissue elements, artery wall,  valve tissue,  calcification, and foreign 
material s.  
Published reports have also described use of CEPD with TAVR in real -world experiences. In 
the single -center SENTINEL- Ulm registry,  the Sentin el device was used in 280 of 802 
(34.9%) consecutive patients. In a propensity-matched population (N=280 with Sentinel, N=280 unprotected), use of Sentinel was associated with a 70% reduction in the odds of death or stroke within 7 days of TAVR (odds ratio [OR]  0.30, 95% confidence interval  [CI] 
0.12–0.77; 2.1% vs. 6.8%, P =0.01)
17. The overall stroke rate was reduced from 4.6% to 1.4% 
with Sentinel (P =0.03, OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.10–0.93) and there was a significant reduction in 
disabling stroke (3.2% vs. 0.4%, P =0.01). Stroke within 48 hours of TAVR was also 
significantly lower with Sentinel (1.1%) compared with unprotected procedures (3.6%, P=0.03). By [CONTACT_104795], TAVR without protection was an independent r isk factor 
for stroke within 7 days ( P=0.04)
17. In a 2 -center registry in the  Netherlands (333 propensity-
matched pairs), patients with Sentinel experienced fewer neurological events (stroke and transient ischemia  attack [TIA]) compared to those without protection at [ADDRESS_1190359] 
TAVR (0.9% vs. 3.6%; P=0.035) and at 30 days (2.7% vs. 6.6%; P =0.029)
18. There were

  significantly fewer disabling strokes in protected patients at 30  days (0.9% vs. 4.2%; 
P=0.039). By [CONTACT_854764], use of Sentinel was associated with fewer 
neurological events at 24 hours after TAVR ( P=0.015, OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.06–0.73). Patients 
who experienced a clinically significant neurological event underwent computed 
tomographic (CT) analysis of the brain. At [ADDRESS_1190360] TAVR, patients in the Sentinel cohort had fewer neurological events (2 of 3 [67%]) in the protected areas of the brain (those not dependent on the left vertebral artery) compared to patients without Sentinel (10 of 12 [83%]). After 24 hours the localization of new neurological events was similar between the 2 cohorts
18.  
The r andomized trials mentioned above were not powered to demonstrate a reduction in 
stroke rates. A recent study -level meta -analysis with these RCTs found that use of CEPD was 
associated with a nonsignificant trend towards lower risk for death or stroke on both relative (6.1% vs. 9.6%; relative risk: 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.35 to 1.07; P =0.08; 
I
2=0%) and absolute (absolute risk difference: –3.5%; 95% CI: –7.9% to 0.9%; number 
needed to treat: 28) terms19. Outcomes were recently reported from a patient level pooled 
analysis of subjects from the SENTINEL and CLEAN -TAVI RCT s, and the SENTINEL-
Ulm registry20. Propensity score matching was performed to adjust for possible confounders 
(N=553 per cohort) . In patien ts undergoing TAVR with Sentinel, the stroke rate within 72 
hours was significantly reduced compared with unprotected procedures (1.88% vs. 5.44%, OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17–0.72, relative risk reduction 65%, absolute risk reduction 3.54%; P=0.0028). The authors noted that their findings suggest that TAVR with Sentinel is 
associated with a significantly lower rate of periprocedural stroke compared to unprotected TAVR. They remarked, however, that due to differences in methodology between the studies, results should be considered hypothesis generating  and to  prove t he hypothesis, a 
large RCT on use of CEPD in TAVR is required. 
Based on observations in the SENTINEL trial, the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) in June 2017 approved the Sentinel
® Cerebral Protection System  for 
use in TAVR as a cerebral protection device to capture and remove embolic material while performing transcatheter aortic valve procedures in order to reduce ischemic injury to the brain peri-procedurally. Howe ver, while results from the SENTINEL trial provided 
reassuring evidence of the safety of dual -filter neuroprotection therapy and confirmed the 
high frequency of embolic debris capture, the effectiveness of the Sentinel CEPD at reducing stroke risk after TA VR remains uncertain.  
4.2. Study Rationale  
As noted above, although Sentinel was approved by [CONTACT_854765], 
the pi[INVESTIGATOR_854732]. In the same trial, post hoc analysis showed 
clinical benefit with reduction in procedural stroke. However, prospective data to prove clinical benefit are lacking.  The objective of the PROTECTED TAVR study is to 
demonstrate that use of Sentinel significantly reduces the risk  of peri-procedural stroke 
(≤72 hours) after TAVR.

  5. Commercial Device Description  (part of Standard of Care)  
The Sentinel® Cerebral Protection System is indicated for use as a cerebral protection device 
to capture and remove embolic material while performin g transcatheter aortic valve 
procedures in order to reduce ischemic injury to the brain peri-procedurally. 
5.1. Overview of the Sentinel® Cerebral Protection System  
The c ommercially available Sentinel Cerebral Protection System (Sentinel; [LOCATION_011] Scientific 
Corporation, Marlborough, MA, [LOCATION_003]) is designed to capture and remove debris dislodged 
during endovascular procedures. It consists of 2 filters within a single 6- F delivery catheter 
percutaneously placed from the right radial or brachial artery over a 0.014-inch guidewire.  
The major features of the system are shown in  Figure 5.1-1. The articulating sheath tip, 
proximal sheath tip, proximal filter hoop, proximal articulating sheath marker, distal filter 
hoop and distal filter tip are radiopaque to enable visualization during use. The filters are 
positioned in the brachiocephalic artery (proximal filter) and the left common carotid artery (distal filter) befo re the TAVR procedure ( Figure 5.1-2) and are withdrawn into the catheter 
and removed after TAVR. Additional product information can be found in the commercial Instructions For Use ( IFU).

7. Study Design  
PROTECTED TAVR is a p rospective, post- market, multicenter  randomized controlled trial 
(RCT) evaluating use of the Sentinel® Cerebral Protection System  in subjects with aortic 
valve stenosis who are treated with an  approved TAVR device.  
7.1. Scale and Duration 
An initial enrollment of up to 3000 randomized subjects in up to 100 study centers is 
planned (see Note  1 below) . A single center may enroll up to 15% of the total enrollment ; 
approval from the Sponsor is required for additional enrollment. Subjects to be treated via 
a transfemoral approach with a commercially  available TAVR device will be randomized 
1:[ADDRESS_1190364]’s legally authorized repre sentative is considered enrolled in the study upon 
randomization, which will occur at the index procedure prior to procedural 
puncture/incision. The study duration for each subject is expected to be through [ADDRESS_1190365] be administered at 30±7 days after the stroke.  For these subjects, study duration will 
be through 30± [ADDRESS_1190366] stroke. 
Note  1: If sample size re -estimation is needed (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), the planned 
maximum enrollment will be up to [ADDRESS_1190367] be deemed treatable with the Sentinel device (have suitable anatomy per the Sentinel Instructions For Use [ IFU]). All eligible subjects (see 
Section  8) should be approached for participation in the trial.

Figure 7.1-1: PROTECTED TAVR Study Design Summary  
 
The planned initial enrollment of 3000 subjects is expected to be completed in approximately 
30 months; therefore, the study duration is estimated to be less than 32 months (see Note  1 in 
Section  6.2.2 regarding subjects diagnosed with a stroke). Enrollment may be extended based 
on the planned interim analysis  (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
The PROTECTED TAVR study will be registered at ClinicalTrials.gov prior to enrollment 
of the first subject.  
7.2. Treatment Assignment  
Subjects who are to be treated with a commercially available TAVR device  and who have 
suitable anatomy for the Sentinel device  will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_1190368] cohort using the 
commercially available Sentinel or a Control cohort with no cerebral protection system . 
Randomization will occur at the index procedure ( prior to procedural puncture/incision ) to 
avoid selection/treatment bias.  The randomization schedules will be computer -generated, 
using a pseudo-random number generator. Randomization will be stratified by  [CONTACT_384] , by 
[CONTACT_854768], and by [CONTACT_854769] (Section  11.2.4). All randomized subjects 
will have unique identification numbers. Random permuted blocks will be employed to 
ensure approximate balance of treatment  allocation within each stratum. Instructions on 
randomization are provided in the Manual of Operations. See Section  5 for a detailed 
description of the Sentinel device.  
7.3. Justification for the Study Design  
In order to support the stated objectives of this study (see Section 6.1) while also limiting the potential exposure of study subjects to risk, an initial enrollment of up to [ADDRESS_1190369] relevant clinical experience with the 
Sentinel device before enrolling trial subjects.  Safety and effectiveness results will be 
reported on all enrolled s ubjects (see Section  19 for information on safety reporting). One 
planned formal interim analys is for the primary endpoint will be conducted on the first 70%

  of enrolled  subjects (N=2100). The study will be stopped early  if a significant difference in 
favor of the test arm is observed  after this  interim analysis. 
Management of subjects in both groups, including antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications , 
will be left to the discretion of the treating physician in this post -market study. 
8. Subject Selection  
Subjects will be evaluated for eligibility for commercial TAVR by [CONTACT_854770]. All eligible subjects should be approached for participation in 
PROTECTED TAVR. Subjects who meet all of the inclusion  criteria  (see Section  8.1) will

possible . 
9. Subject Accountability  
9.1. Point of Enrollment  
A subject who provides an ICF  signed by [CONTACT_29159]’s legally authorized 
representative is considered enrolled in the study upon randomization, which will occur at the 
index procedure prior to procedural puncture/incision .  
9.2. Withdrawal 
All subjects enrolled in the clinical study (including those withdrawn from the clinical study) shall be accounted for and documented. If a subject withdraws from the clinical  investigation 
the reason(s) shall be reported. Reasons for withdrawal include but are not limited to physician discretion, subject choice to withdraw consent, or death. If such withdrawal is due to problems related to device safety or performance, the inve stigator shall ask for the 
subject’s permission to follow his/her status/condition outside of the clinical study.   
While all efforts will be made to minimize attrition, subjects may withdraw from the study at any time, with or without reason , and without prejudice to further treatment. Withdrawn 
subjects will not undergo any additional study follow-up, nor will they be replaced. The investigator may discontinue a subject from participation in the study if the investigator feels that the subject can no longer fully comply with the requirements of the study or if any of the study procedures are deemed potentially harmful to the subject. Data that have already been collected on withdrawn subjects will be retained and may be used for analysis, unless local regulations apply. N o new data will be collected after subject withdrawal.   
All applicable case report forms up to the point of subject withdrawal and an “End of Study” form  for the subject must be completed . If the withdrawal is due to investigator discretio n, 
the investigator should follow-up with the subject per standard of care.  
9.3. End-of-Study Definition  
This clinical study will be considered completed when the last subject has concluded 
assessments as outlined in the data collection schedule in Table 10.1-1 (see Note  1 below). 
Note  1: In subjects diagnosed with a stroke, mRS must be administered at 30±7 days after 
the stroke; mortality plus device related adverse events (including adverse device effects 
[ADE], serious adverse device effects [SADE] , unanticipated adverse device effects 
[UADE] , and unanticipated serious adverse device effects [[LOCATION_003]DE] ; see Section  19) through 
30±[ADDRESS_1190372] be reported to BSC. For these subjects, study duration will be 
through 30± [ADDRESS_1190373] stroke.

10.2. Study Subject Screening  
Subjects will be evaluated for eligibility for commercial TAVR by [CONTACT_854773]. Subjects with documented aortic valve stenosis who are to be 
treated with a commercially available TAVR device and who sign the IRB/IEC /HREC -
approved ICF will be assessed  for enrollment in the clinical study. Inclusion and exclusion 
criteria are provided in Section  8. Every subject must be deemed treatable with the Sentinel 
study device. 
Once written informed consent has been obtained, a subject will be entered into a screening 
log, which will be maintained at the center. A subject who provide s written informed consent 
will be entered into the screening log whether or not the subject is randomized into the study. For consented subjects not enrolled in the trial, t he reason for screen failure will be 
documented in the screening log.  
It is estimated that nearly 5% of elderly ≥[ADDRESS_1190380] population as allowed by [CONTACT_422209]/national regulation.  
10.3. Subject Informed Consent  
Written informed consent (see Section  20) must be obtained for all qualified subjects who are 
potential study candidates prior to the subject’s index procedure.  
The Investigator/designee who has been trained on the protocol will explain the nature and 
scope of the study, potential risks and benefits of participation, and answer questions for the 
subject. If the subject agrees to participate, the IRB/ IEC/HREC-approved ICF must be signed 
and personally dated by [CONTACT_190938]/her legally authorized representative. The Investigator/designee must also sign the ICF prior to subject enrollment. Any additional persons required by [CONTACT_16018]’s IRB/ IEC/HREC to sign the ICF must also comply.

  11. Statistical Considerations  
11.1. Endpoints 
11.1.1. Primary Endpoint  
The study is powered to assess the primary endpoint, which is all stroke (hemorrhagic, 
ischemic, or undetermined status; disabling or nondisabling) through [ADDRESS_1190393] TAVR 
procedure or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] (whichever comes first) as adjudicated by [CONTACT_854775].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Statistical Hypothesis  for the Primary Endpoint 
The primary statistical hypothesis is that the rate of the primary endpoint (all stroke through 
[ADDRESS_1190394] TAVR procedure or discharge [whichever comes first] ) in the Sentinel (Test) 
cohort is superior to that in the Control co hort. The null and alternative hypotheses for the 
primary endpoint are as follows: 
 H 0: PSentinel  = P Control  
 H 1: PSentinel  ≠ P Control  
where PSentinel  and P Control  correspond to the rates of the primary endpoint for the Sentinel 
cohort (test) and the Control cohort (no cerebral protection), respectively .   
Testing will be done for the primary endpoint as described in the statistical analysis plan. A chi-square test will be used. The primary analysis population for the primary endpoint is the  
ITT analysis set; this endpoint will also be analyzed for the Per-Protocol analysis set  (see 
Section  11.2.1 for description of analysis sets) .    
[IP_ADDRESS]. Sample Size Parameters for the Primary Endpoint 
The sample size parameters for the primary endpoint are shown below.  
• Expected Control rate PControl : 4% 
• Expected Sentinel (test) rate PSentinel : 2% (50% relative reduction)  
• Test significance level ( α): 0.05 (2-sided) 
• Power (1 – β ): > 0.90 (see Note  1 below) 
• Test to Control ratio : 1:1 (see Note  2 below) 
• Number of evaluable subjects: up to 6000 maximum enrollment with sample size re -
estimation37,38 
• Planned enrollment: = 30 00 subjects (N=1500 per cohort) 
The statistical approach uses an adaptive group sequential design37,38. There will be [ADDRESS_1190395] 70% of  enrolled  subjects (N= 2100) by 
[CONTACT_854776] (see Section  21.3). The study will be stopped 
if a significant difference in favor of the test arm is observed after th is interim analysis.

 Page 34 of 76 
  Based on  the results of the interim analysis, sample size re -estimation37,38 may  be performed 
and the sample size may be increase d up to a maximum of 6000 subjects. Details of this 
adaptive approach are pre-specified in the Independent Safety and Statistical Monitor charter . 
A final analysis will be performed on all enrolled  subjects if the study is not stopped after the 
interim analysis (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  and Section 11.3.2 below) . 
Note  1: This power calculation includes sample size re -estimation37,38.  
Note  2: Randomization will occur at the index procedure (prior to procedural 
puncture/incision) to avoid selection/treatment bias.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Success Criteria for the Primary Endpoint 
As noted above, [ADDRESS_1190396] 70% of enrolled subjects and a final analysis will be conducted on all 
enrolled subjects if the study is not stopped after the interim analysis. The alpha -level for th e  
interim analys is and the final analysis is adjusted using the Lan -Demets spending function 
with O’Brien -Fleming boundaries39,[ADDRESS_1190397] TAVR procedure or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] (whichever comes first)  
compared to the Control group. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Statistical Methods – Primary Endpoint 
All subjects who are enrolled will be eligible for evaluation. Handling of dropouts and 
missing data will depend on their frequency and the nature of the outcome measure. Methods 
to eliminate or minimize bias will be implemented and described completely , if applicable.  
Outlier values will be evaluated for their validity. Suspected i nvalid data will be queried and 
corrected  in the database prior to statistical analysis . 
11.1.2. Post-procedure Measurements  
Post-procedure data  will be collected as detailed in the clinical study schedule (Table 10.1-1) 
and will be summarized using descriptive statistics for continuous variables (e.g., mean, standard deviation, n, minimum, maximum) and frequency tables or proportions for discrete variables. Adverse event and SAE rates will be reported . 
11.2. General Statistical  Methods 
All statistical analyses will be performed using the SAS System software, version 9.2 or later 
(Copyright
© [ADDRESS_1190398], Cary, North Carolina [ZIP_CODE], [LOCATION_003]. 
All rights reserved).  
All statistical analyses will be conducte d according to applicable Standard Operating 
Procedures, Work Instructions, and the study- specific statistical analysis plan .

  11.2.1. Analysis Sets  
The primary endpoint and the additional measurements will be analyzed on an ITT basis and 
a Per -Protocol basis. For ITT analyses, all subjec ts who sign the IRB/ IEC/HREC-approved 
study ICF (see Section  10.3) and are enrolled in the trial (see Section  9.1) will be included in 
the analysis, whether or not the assigned treatment is received . For Per -Protocol analyses, 
ITT subjec ts who undergo TAVR and who are treated as assigned in the randomization 
process (excludes crossovers)  will be included in the analysis. 
11.2.2. Control of Systematic Error/Bia s 
The selection of subjects will be made from the Investigator’s usual case load. All subjects 
who have signed the ICF, are  deemed treatable with the Sentinel device (have suitable 
anatomy per the I FU) and  are selected to undergo TAVR with a commercial TAVR device 
will be eligible for enrollment in the study. The study center’s heart team  assessment s and 
imaging measurements before device placement will contribute to the determination of  
subject eligibility for the study.  
To control for inter- observer variability, an independent CEC (see Section  21.1) will 
adjudicate pre -determined endpoints. 
11.2.3. Number of Subjects per Investigative Center  
A single center may enroll up to 15% of the total enrollment; approval from the Sponsor is 
required for additional enrollment. 
11.2.4. Randomization Scheme  
Using a computer- generated list of random treatment allocations (i.e., a randomization 
schedule) subjects  to be treated with a commercially available TAVR device will be 
randomized 1:[ADDRESS_1190399] cohort using the commercially available Sentinel device or a 
Control cohort with no cerebral protection system . Randomization will be stratified  by 
[CONTACT_384] , by [CONTACT_854777] (low risk and intermediate or higher risk; see surgical risk 
definitions in Table 25.2-1),  and by [CONTACT_854769] (balloon- expandable device 
and non-balloon expandable device). Additional information is provided in the study Manual 
of Operations.  
11.3. Data Analyses 
Baseline and  outcome variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics for 
continuous variables (mean , standard deviation, number of observations, minimum and 
maximum) and discrete variables (percentage and count/sample) . See Section  11.1.1 for a 
discussion on analysis of the primary endpoint. 11.3.1. Other Endpoints/Measurements

  11.3.2. Interim Analyses  
One formal interim analys is is planned for the purpose of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_854734]. This analys is will be performed by [CONTACT_854779] ( see Section  21.3). The interim analysi s for the primary endpoint will be conducted 
on the first 70% of enrolled subjects; a final analysis will be conducted on all enrolled  
subjects if the study is not stopped after the interim analysis .  
The Lan -Demets spending function with O’Brien -Fleming  boundaries39 is used to adjust the 
alpha- level for the  interim  analysis and the final analys is (if needed) : 0.[ADDRESS_1190400] TAVR procedure or discharge (whichever comes first)  versus the Control group and the study will be stopped. If 
the study is not stopped after the interim analysis, sample size re- estimation  may be 
performed contingent on the results of the interim analysis  (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
The planned interim analysi s is pre-specified to provide a formal hypothesis testing approach 
to examine the primary endpoint with the adjusted significance level and stop the trial early for effectiveness if appropriate. This pre-specified interim analysis allows for sample size re-
estimation  per the study’s adaptive group sequential design
37,38. 
Additional analyses not defined in the protocol may also be conducted for regulatory agency review.  
11.3.3. Subgroup Analyses  
The p rimary  endpoint and pre-specified additional measurements (see Section  6.2) will be 
summarized for the following subgroups.  
• Operative risk (low, intermediate , high/extreme; treatment by [CONTACT_854780])  
• Gender 
No adjustments for multiple comparisons will be made. Additional subgroup analyses may be performed as appropriate. 
11.3.4. Justification of Pooling  
Analyses for the primary endpoint will be presented using data pooled across centers and 
intended TAVR valve types. An assessment of the poolability of subjects across centers and 
intended TAVR valve types will be made using logistic regression. Main effects for the center ( intended TAVR valve type ) and treatment and the interaction of the center ( intended 
TAVR valve type ) by [CONTACT_854781]. If the P value for center (intended TAVR valve type ) 
by [CONTACT_854782] ≥0.1, it can be concluded that the treatment effect is not different across the centers ( intended TAVR valve types) and the data can be pooled. In the analysis to 
justify pooling across centers, the centers with fewer than 10 subjects enrolled in the study

18. Potential Risks and Benefits 
18.1. Instructions for Use  
Please refer to the Sentinel Cerebral Protection System IFU for an overview of anticipated 
adverse (device) effects, and risks associated with the commercial  device.  
18.2. Risks Associated with Participation in the Clinical Study  
Risks associated with TAVR and use of the commercial Sentinel Cerebral Protection  System 
are listed in the I FU and in the ICF . There are no incremental risks associated with 
participation in this clinical study.  
18.3. Possible Interactions with Concomitant Medical Treatments  
Medications to be used in PROTECTED TAVR constitute standard of care for TAVR as 
described in society guidelines30,31. 
18.4. Risk Minimization Actions  
Additional risks may exist. Risks can be minimized through compliance with this protocol, 
performing procedures in the appropriate hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84365], adherence to subject selection  criteria , close monitoring of the subject's physiologic status during research 
procedures and/or follow-ups and by [CONTACT_71653]. 
Data will be monitored as they are submitted to BSC. Qualified employees of BSC, or a designee under contract, will conduct monitoring visits at the initiation of the study and at interim intervals described in the monitoring plan throughout the course of the study to evaluate protocol compliance and determine if there are any issues that could affect the safety or welfare of any subject in the study. A dynamic safety review process including CEC (Section  21.1)  adjudication of specified events as recommended by [CONTACT_44248]
16,22 and/or 
NeuroARC21 will support risk mitigation . 
18.5. Anticipated Benefits  
It is expected that the commercially available Sentinel Cerebral Protection System may provide benefit to the subject by [CONTACT_854785]. Without such protection, embolic debris could travel unimpeded via the cerebral circulation to the brain; this co uld lead to cerebral vascular events 
such as stroke and/or TIA.

21. Committee s 
21.1. Safety Monitoring  Process  
To promote early detection of safety issues, the Clinical Events Committee ( CEC; see below)  
will provide evaluations of safety events. Success of this program requires dynamic collection of unmonitored data as soon as the event is reported. This is expedited through BSC or its designee,  which is responsible for coordinating the collection of information for 
the subject dossier from the centers and core laborator y. During regularly scheduled 
monitoring visits clinical research monitors will support the dynamic reporting process through their review of source documents and other data information.
 The BSC Medical 
Safety group includes physicians with expertise in cardiology  and with the necessary 
therapeutic and subject matter expertise to evaluate and classify the events into the categories outlined above (Section  19).  
21.1.1. Clinical Events Committee  
A CEC will be used in this study. The CEC is an independent group of individuals with pertinent expertise, including cardiovascular interventional therapy, cardiovascular surgery, and neurology, which reviews and adjudicates important endpoints and relevant adverse events reported by [CONTACT_2792]. The CEC will review a safety event dossier, which may include copi[INVESTIGATOR_854740]. The responsibilities, qualifications, membership, and committe e procedures of the CEC are outlined in the CEC Charter. 
21.2. Steering Committee  
A Steering Committee consisting of Sponsor Clinical Management, the Study Coordinating PIs, a neurologist, cardiac surgeons, and other investigators experienced in TAVR will be 
convened. Responsibilities may include oversight of the overall conduct of the study with regard to protocol development, study progress, subject safety, overall data quality and integrity, as well as disseminating any study results through appropriate scient ific sessions 
and publications. Steering Committee members may participate in the review and approval of all requests for data analysis, abstract and manuscript preparation and submission.

be stopped if a significant difference in favor of the test arm is observed after this interim analysis (see Section  11.3.2). Based on the results of the interim analysis , sample size re-
estimation
37,38 may  be performed and the sample size may be increased up to a maximum of 
6000 subjects. Details of this adaptive approach are pre- speci fied in the Independent Safety 
and Statistical Monitor charter.  
22. Suspension or Termination  
22.1. Premature Termination of the Study  
[LOCATION_011] Scientific Corporation reserves the right to terminate the study at any stage but 
intends to exercise this right only for va lid scientific or business reasons and reasons related 
to protection of subjects. Investigators, associated IRBs/ IECs/HRECs , and regulatory 
authorities, as applicable, will be notified in writing in the event of study termination.  
22.1.1. Criteria  for Premature Termination of the Study  
Possible reasons for premature study termination include, but are not limited to, the 
following: 
• The occurrence of unanticipated adverse device effects that present a significant or unreasonable risk to subjects enrolled in the study. 
• An enrollment rate far below expectation that prejudices the conclusion of the study.  
• A decision on the part of BSC to suspend or discontinue development /marketing  of the 
device.  
This trial may also be stopped early for effectiveness if upon interim analysis a significant 
difference in favor of the test arm is observed  after enrollment of the first 70% of subjects. 
Please see Section  11.3.2 for additional information.  
22.2. Termination of Study Participation by [CONTACT_5717]/IEC/HREC Approval

AORTIC 
REGURGITATION 
(AR)  The leaking of the aortic valve that causes blood to flow in the reverse direction 
during ventricular diastole, from the aorta into the left ventricle.  The 
echocardiographic findings in severe aortic regurgitation include the following.  
• An AR color jet dimension >60% of the left ventricular outflow tract diameter (may not be true if the jet is eccentric)  
• The pressure half -time of the regurgitant jet is <250 msec  
• Early termination of the mitral inflow (due to increase in LV pressure due to the AR)  
• Early diastolic flow reversal in the descending aorta.   
• Regurgitant volume >60 mL  
•
 Regurgitant fraction >55%  
ARRHYTHMIA  Any variation from  the normal rhythm of the heartbeat, including sinus 
arrhythmia, premature beat, heart block, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter and 
tachycardia. Complete heart block, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular 
fibrillation are considered major arrhythmias.  Data should be collected on any 
new arrhythmia resulting in hemodynamic instability or requiring therapy (therapy 
includes  electrical/medical cardioversion or initiation of a new medication [ oral 
anticoagulation, rhythm or rate controlling therapy ]).  
New onset atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (AF) is diagnosed as any arrhythmia 
within hospi[INVESTIGATOR_854742] a 12- lead ECG, or at least 30 seconds on a rhythm strip.  
The therapeutic approach to new -onset AF (spontaneous conversion, electrical or 
medical cardioversion, initiation of oral anticoagulation, and rate or rhythm control medications)  and any clinical consequences should be documented.

NEW YORK HEART 
ASSOCIATION 
CLASSIFICATION 
(NYHA) Classification system for defining cardiac disease and related functional 
limitations into four broad categorizations:  
 
Class I  Subject with cardiac disease but without resulting limitations of 
physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue 
fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea, or angi nal pain.  
Class II  Subjects with cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of 
physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical 
activity results in fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea, or anginal pain.  
Class III  Subjects with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of 
physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary 
physical activity causes fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea, or anginal 
pain.  
Class IV  Subjects with cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry o n any 
physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of cardiac insufficiency or of the anginal syndrome may be present even at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is 
increased.  
 
NONSTRUCTURAL 
DYSFUNCTION  Any abnormality not intrinsic to the valve itself that results in stenosis or 
regurgitation of the operated valve or hemolysis. The term nonstructural dysfunction refers to problems (exclusive of thrombosis and infection) that do not 
directly involve valve components yet result in dysfunction of an operated valve, 
as diagnosed by [INVESTIGATOR_1312] -operation, autopsy, or clinical investigation. Nonstructural 
dysfunction includes the following.  
• Entrapment by [CONTACT_170851], tissue, or suture  
• Paravalvular leak  
• Inappropriate sizing or positioning  
• Residu al leak or obstruction after valve implantation or repair  
• Clinically important intravascular hemolytic anemia  
• Development of aortic or pulmonic regurgitation as a result of technical errors  
•

PARAVALVULAR 
REGURGITATION / 
PARAVALVULAR 
LEAK  Leakage due to a separation of the prosthetic valve from the annulus. Any 
evidence of leakage of blood around the device. Diagnosis of paravalvular 
regurgitation/paravalvular leak may be obtained from TEE /TTE, however, 
definitive diagnosis is obtained at r e-operation, explant, or autopsy.  
PERMANENT 
PACEMAKER 
IMPLANTATION  
(PPI)  Implantation of a new permanent pacemaker  after the index procedure resulting 
from new or worsened conduction disturbances (including new left bundle branch 
block [LBBB] and third -degree atrioventricular block)  
• Procedure -related: Permanent pacemaker  is implanted in subjects with new 
onset  or worsened conduction disturbances occurring post index procedure  
• Not related to procedure: Permanent pacemaker  is implanted in subjects with 
known conduction disturbances that did not advance after the index procedure.  
Note : See also definitions for arrhythmia and conductance disturbance.  
PORCELAIN AORTA  Heavy circumferential calcification of the entire ascending  aorta extending to the 
arch such that aortic cross -clampi[INVESTIGATOR_854750], 
associated treatments or necessary secondary interventions that do not ne cessarily 
involve the device.  This includes morbidity associated with either pre -medication, 
or anesthesia, or other adjunct to the surgical procedure.  Other technical errors including inappropriate subject selection, inappropriate operator techniques, measurements, or judgment that do not involve the device itself are also included.   
PROCEDURE -
RELATED EVENTS  Events occurring during or as a direct result of the index procedure.  
REPEAT 
PROCEDURE FOR 
VALVE -RELATED 
DYSFUNCTION  Any surgical or percutaneous interventional catheter procedure that repairs, 
otherwise alters or adjusts, or replaces a previously implanted valve. In addition to surgical re -operations, balloon dilatation, interventional manipulation, 
repositioning, or retrieval, and other catheter -based interventions for valve -related 
complications are also considered reinterventions. Cardiac reinterventions will be 
categorized as repeat TAVR, valvuloplasty, or surgical AVR.  
REPOSITIONING OF 
A VALVE  Any movement of the valve after the l ead in phase (after the posts ha ve entered 
the buckles)  
RESHEATHING OF A 
VALVE  Full resheathing occurs when the top of the posts re -enter the Lotus catheter

Stroke Diagnostic Criteria   
• Rapid onset of a focal or gl obal neurological deficit with at least one of the 
following: change in level of consciousness, hemiplegia, hemiparesis, numbness or sensory loss affecting one side of the body, dysphasia or aphasia, 
hemianopia, amaurosis fugax, or other neurological signs  or symptoms 
consistent with stroke  
• Duration of a focal or global neurological deficit ≥24 h; OR <[ADDRESS_1190423]; OR the neurological 
deficit results in death  
• No other readily identifiable nonstroke ca use for the clinical presentation (e.g., 
brain tumor, trauma, infection, hypoglycemia, peripheral lesion,  
pharmacological influences), to be determined by [CONTACT_854802]  
• Confirmation of the diagnosis by [CONTACT_854803].  
o Neurology or neurosurgical specialist  
o Neuroimaging procedure (MRI or CT scan), but stroke may be diagnosed on clinical grounds alone  
Note 3 : Subject s with non -focal global encephalopathy will not be reported as a 
stroke without unequivocal evidence based upon neuroimaging studies  (CT scan

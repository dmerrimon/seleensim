 Study Design This will be a single-visit, randomized, double-masked, 
bilateral wear, non-dispensi ng, 2-sequence × 2-period 
crossover study. Eligible subjects  will be randomized to one of 
two unique lens wear sequences (Test/Control or Control/Test). During each wear period the lenses will be worn bilaterally for approximately one hour in-office. A 15-minute washout period between lenses will be utilized . Subjects will be asked an open-
ended verbal question regarding their ocular symptoms following lens settling, and again following at least 1 hour of wear. Subjective comfort will be  assessed using a Visual 
Analog Scale (VAS). Ocular physiology will be assessed by [CONTACT_312783]. Lenses will be collected and stored for return  to the sponsor after removal.  
 See the flow chart at the end of the synopsis table for the 
schematic of the study visits  and procedures of main 
observations (Fi
gure 1).

 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care (JJVC) is in troducing a new lidstock for production of 
AO1DfA contact [CONTACT_13276]. The purpose of this clini cal investigation is to evaluate the initial 
clinical performance of AO1DfA lenses manufactured with this new lidstock in terms of 
subject-reported ocular symptoms, subjective comfort, ocular physiology and lens fitting 
characteristics.  
1.1. Name [CONTACT_312809] 1DfA contact [CONTACT_312787]. The test lens will be manufac tured with the new lidstock, and the control 
lenses will be produced using legacy lidstock.  
 Further details about the test articles are found in section [ADDRESS_385202] and control lenses will be supplied in a single 
lens power, subjects will wear a spectacle tr ial frame with compensating prescription (such 
that the total power of the trial frame plus study contact [CONTACT_312788]) over the lenses during wear periods.  
1.3. Summary of Findings from Nonclinical Studies 
Not applicable – marketed product only. 
1.4. Summary of Known Risks and Benefits to Human Subjects 
Subjects are not anticipated to receive any direct clinical benefit from participating in this study; however, results of the study will be be neficial in gathering clinical data on the 
performance of AO1DfA contact [CONTACT_312789].  No adverse device effects, residua l risks, or interactions with concomitant medical treatments 
are anticipated, beyond those nor mally associated with regular soft contact [CONTACT_13279].  
 Comprehensive clinical information regardi ng the AO1DfA lens is given in the AO1DfA 
package insert (Appendix C). 
1.5. Relevant Literature References and Prior Clinical Data Relevant to Proposed Clinical Study 
AO1DfA lenses are FDA-approved and marketed worldwide. There have been no previous clinical evaluations of AO1DfA lenses ma nufactured with the alternative lidstock.

2.1. Objectives  
Primary Objective To evaluate the occurrence of subject-reporte d ocular symptoms with AO1DfA manufactured 
with a new lidstock design against AO1Df A with legacy lidstock as control.  
 Exploratory Objectives To evaluate subjective comfort, ocular physiolo gy and lens fitting characteristics for AO1DfA 
manufactured with a new lidstock design agains t AO1DfA with legacy lidstock as control. 
2.2. Endpoints  
Primary endpoint: 
1. Percentage of eyes with ‘m oderate’ or ‘severe’ subject -reported ocular symptoms  
 Frequency and severity by [CONTACT_129808]-reported ocular sy mptoms and problems with the 
study lens following lens settling and again following at least 1 hour of bilateral study lens 
wear. Severity of the symptoms can be: 
x 0 = Not Applicable or Not Recorded; 
x 1 = Mild and results in little or  no interference with lens wear; 
x 2 = Moderate AND/OR occasionally  interferes with lens wear; 
x 3 = Severe AND/OR frequently interferes with lens wear. 
 Exploratory endpoints : 
1. Adverse Events  
 
2. Subjective Comfort  
A Visual Analog Scale (VAS) will be used to  evaluate subjective comfort following lens 
settling and again following at least 1 hour of bilateral study lens wear . The VAS questionnaire 
will be completed electronically using the following wording:    
Below is a comfort scale with a moveable slider. The right end of the scale (100) represents the best comfort imaginable (you are completely unaware of the lenses). The left end of the 
scale (0) represents the worst comfort imaginabl e (the lenses are completely intolerable). 
Please move the slider to  indicate your response. 
How comfortable are the contac t lenses you're wearing?

3.4. Enrollment Strategy 
Study subjects will be recruited from the Institution/clinical si te’s subject database and/or 
utilizing Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved 
materials.  
4. STUDY DESIGN AND RATIONALE 
4.1. Description of Study Design 
This will be a single-visit, randomized, doubl e-masked, bilateral wear, non-dispensing, 2×2 
crossover study. Eligible subjects will be randomi zed into one of two unique sequences, to 
wear two different study lenses, one at a time , over two wear periods (test then control or 
control then test). During each wear period the le nses will be worn bila terally for at least one 
hour in-office. Subjective co mfort will be assessed using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). 
Subjects will be asked an open-ended verbal question regarding their ocular symptoms 
following lens settling and again following at least 1 hour of w ear. Subjective comfort will be 
assessed using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Oc ular physiology will be assessed by [CONTACT_312792]. Lenses  will be collected and stored for return to 
the sponsor after removal. Subjects will not  have access to the study lenses following 
completion of the study.  
4.2. Study Design Rationale 
A single-visit, non-dispensing, 2x2 crossover stu dy design was chosen as the optimal design 
to assess the primary and secondary study objecti ves. Crossover designs are a well-established 
study design in which subjects are exposed to multiple treatments during different time periods. 
The design is cost effective and more efficien t since between-subject variability is minimized. 
Moreover, randomization removes potential for syst ematic error or bias and balances both the 
known and unknown confounding factors that  may affect the study outcomes. 
 Each lens will be worn for a pproximately 1 hour (in- office), which is co nsidered a sufficient 
length of time to evaluate the clinical endpoints of interest (i nitial comfort, subject-reported 
ocular symptoms, lens fit and oc ular physiology). As both wear pe riods will be completed at a 
single visit, to help reduce the potential risk  of treatment carryover  effects, a 15-minute 
washout period between lenses will  be utilized. Furthermore, sin ce the primary objective is to 
assess ocular symptoms, rewetting drops will be in stilled in each eye between lenses, to further 
washout any residual effects subjects may be experiencing from their previous lens.

subject, last visit) including the enrollment period is expected  to be approximately [ADDRESS_385209] lens fitting at visit 1, eligible subjects will be 
randomized to one of two uni que lens wear sequences using a computer-generated 
randomization scheme provided by [CONTACT_312793]. Permuted  block randomization 
will be used to avoid bias in the assignment of subjects to treatment, and to enhance the validity 
of statistical comparisons across treatment groups. Each block will contain two different lens trial sequences. The randomization scheme will be generated using the PROC PLAN procedure 
from Statistical Analysis System (SAS) Softwa re Version 9.4 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, 
NC)
5.[ADDRESS_385210] occurred prior to 
randomization:  
• Informed consent must have been obtained.  
• The subject must have met all eligibility criteria. 
• The subject’s screening a nd baseline information must have been collected.  
 When fitting test articles, the following steps should be followed to maintain randomization 
codes: 
1. Investigator or designee (documented on the Delegation Log) will consult the lens 
fitting schedule to obtain the test article as signment for that subjec t prior to dispensing. 
2. Investigator or designee will record the subj ect’s number on the appropriate line of the 
randomization (lens fitting) schedule. 
3. Investigator or designee will pull the appr opriate test articles from the study supply. 
All test articles that are opened, whether dispensed (placed/fit on eye or dispensed 
outside the clinical site) or not, must be recorded on the Test Article Accountability 
Log in the “Dispensed” section.

 6.4. Packaging and Labeling 
The test articles will be packaged in blisters  as the primary packaging. Th e test article will be 
supplied in standard production packagi ng. A sample study label is shown below: 
 
Primar y Packa ging Secondar y Packa ging 
  
6.5. Storage Conditions 
Test articles will be maintained at ambient temper atures at the clinical site. Test articles must 
be kept under secure conditions. 
6.6. Collection and Storage of Samples 
Worn study lenses will be collected as part of the study procedures. Following removal, each 
worn lens will be placed individually into one of the supplied glass vi als. Lenses are to be 
stored dry, i.e., without any solution. The supp lied cap will be screwed onto the vial, and the 
vial will be labelled with th e subject number, eye (OD or OS),  and randomization code. Lenses 
will then immediately be placed into a fre ezer prior to transfer back to JJVC.  
 In addition to the collection procedures above, when  possible, any lens or test article associated 
with an Adverse Event and/or a Product Quality Complaint must be retained and stored in a 
glass vial with moderate solutio n pending directions from the s ponsor for potenti al return to 
JJVC. 
6.7. Accountability of Test Articles 
JJVC will provide the Investigator with sufficient quantities of study articles and supplies to complete the investigation. The Investigator is asked to retain all lens shipment documentation for the test article a ccountability records.

 8.2. Withdrawal/Discontinua tion from the Study 
A subject will be withdrawn from the st udy for any of the fo llowing reasons: 
x Subject withdrawal of consent. 
x Subject not compliant to protocol. 
x Subject lost to follow-up. 
x Subject no longer meets elig ibility criteria (e .g. the subject becomes pregnant). 
x Subject develops significant or serious adve rse events necessitating discontinuation of 
study lens wear. 
x Subjects who have experienced a Co rneal Infiltrativ e Event (CIE). 
x Investigator’s clinical judgment regarding the subject safety reasons (that it is in the 
best interest of the subject to stop treatment). 
x Subject not compliant with study lens wear schedule.  
x Subject not successfully dispensed due to lack  of efficacy or safety (e.g., poor vision, 
poor comfort, or unacceptable fit).  
For discontinued subjects, the Investigator will: 
x Complete the current visit (s cheduled or unscheduled). 
x Complete the Final Evaluation, indicating th e reason that the subject was discontinued 
from the study. 
x Record the spherocylindrical refraction with  best corrected distance visual acuity. 
x Collect used test article(s) (worn or brought to the visit)  from the subject and discard 
them, unless otherwise stated in section 7.2. 
x Collect all unused test article(s) from the subject. 
x Make arrangements for subject care, if needed, due to their study participation. 
 
Additional subjects may be enrolled if a subj ect discontinues from th e study prematurely.  
 In cases where a subject is lost to follow-up, ev ery possible effort must be made to contact [CONTACT_312794]/withdrawal. Th e measures taken to follow 
up must be documented including two written attemp ts and a certified letter (or equivalent) as 
the final attempt.  
9. PRE-STUDY AND CONCOMITANT INTERVENTION/MEDICATION 
Concomitant medications will be documented during screening and updated during the study. 
Disallowed concomitant interventions for this study include ocular medications of any kind, 
or any systemic medications that would norma lly contraindicate contact  [CONTACT_126102]. 
9.1. Systemic Medications 
Certain systemic medications are known to have  a higher likelihood to interfere with contact 
[CONTACT_13279], chiefly by [CONTACT_312795].

 The Sponsor will determine when a study will be stopped. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_312773]’s re sults are compromised. 
 JJVC reserves the right to terminate the study at any time for any reason. Additionally, the 
IEC/IRB reserves the right to terminate the study if an unreasonable risk is determined. The study can be terminated by [CONTACT_312796] i ndividual clinical  site due to 
specific clinical observations, if in their opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], after a discussion with JJVC, it is determined 
that it would be unwise to continue at the clinical site.  JJVC (and the IEC/IRB and  DMC, if applicable) will evaluate  all adverse events. If it is 
determined that an adverse event presents an un reasonable risk, the inves tigation, or that part 
of the investigation presenting the risk, will be terminated as soon as possible. 
 Should the study be terminated (either prematurely or as scheduled), the Investigator will notify the IEC/IRB and Regulator y Authority as required by [CONTACT_312797]. 
12. PROCEDURE FOR HANDLING PR ODUCT QUALITY COMPLAINTS 
A Product Quality Complaint (PQC) refers to any written, electronic, or oral communication 
that alleges deficiencies rela ted to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, 
effectiveness or performance of test articles after th ey have been released for clinical trial use.   
 Potential complaints may come from a variety of  sources including but no t limited to subjects, 
clinical research associates (CRA), clinical operations managers (C OM), medical monitors, 
and site personnel, etc. The following are not considered product  quality complaints: 
x Subject satisfaction inquiries reported vi a “Subjective Questionna ires” and “Patient 
Reported Outcomes (PRO).” 
x Clinical test articles that are stored imp roperly or damaged after receipt at the 
investigational site. 
x Lens replacements that occu r due to drops/fall-outs. 
x Damage deemed by [CONTACT_35513], 
and not indicative of a quality de ficiency (i.e. tears, rips, et c.), only in situations where 
there is no deficiency alleged by [CONTACT_423]. 
 Within [ADDRESS_385211] be 
recorded in the EDC system, which will trig ger an automatic email notification to the 
appropriate COM/CRA and Clinical QA representa tive. In cases where the EDC system in use 
is not configured to send automatic notificatio ns or when an EDC system is not used, the 
COM/CRA is responsible for not ifying Clinical QA upon discovery that a PQC has occurred.   
 Upon receipt of the EDC notification, the COM/ CRA will contact [CONTACT_312798]:  
CR-6530, v 1.0  
 
Page 37 of 137JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol 
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.  
 
 
 
 x Date the complaint was received/recorded  in the EDC System  (Date of Sponsor 
Awareness). 
x Who received the complaint. 
x Study number. 
x Clinical site information (contact [CONTACT_2300], site ID, telephone number). 
x Lot number(s). 
x Unique Subject Identifier(s). 
x Indication of who first observed co mplaint (site personnel or subject). 
x OD/OS indication, along with whether the lens was inserted. 
x Any related AE number if applicable. 
x Detailed complaint description (scheduled/unscheduled visit, wear time, symptoms, resolution of symptoms, etc.). 
x Eye Care Provider obje ctive (slit lamp) findings if applicable. 
x Confirmation of product availabil ity for return (and tracking  information, if available), 
or rationale if product is not available for return  
 
 
Once a complaint is received, it will be asse ssed by [CONTACT_19569], CRA, or trained site personnel 
to determine if it is an Adverse Event/Seri ous Adverse Event (AE/SAE). If the complaint 
results in an AE/SAE, the COM/CRA, or trained site personnel will follow section 13 of this 
protocol. If the AE/SAE was potentially the resu lt of a product quality related deficiency, these 
procedures also apply and will be executed in parallel.    In some cases, a PQC form may be generated in EDC by [CONTACT_35514].  In this event, the 
PQC forms will be marked “Intentionally Left Blank” or “ILB”.  Justification for ILB must be documented. 
13. ADVERSE EVENTS 
13.1. Definitions and Classifications 
Adverse Event (AE) – An AE is “any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or 
injury, or untoward clinical signs (including ab normal laboratory findings) in subjects, users 
or other persons, whether or not related to th e investigational medica l device and whether 
anticipated or unanticipated.”

 2. Was present prior to the study but worsened  during the study. This would include any 
condition resulting from concomitant illnesses,  reactions to concomitant medications, 
or progression of disease states. 
Note : Pregnancy must be documented as an adverse event and must be reported to the clinical 
monitor and to the Sponsor immedi ately upon learning of the event. 
 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) – An SAE is any adverse event that led to any of the following:

x Asymptomatic Corneal Scar 
x Any corneal event which necessitates te mporary lens discontinuation > 2 weeks 
 Non-Significant Adverse Events  – are defined as those events that are usually asymptomatic 
and usually do not warrant discon tinuation of contact [CONTACT_35517] a reduction in 
wear time.  However, the Investigator may choose to prescribe treatment as a precautionary measure.    Diagnoses and conditions that are considered Oc ular Non-Significant Adverse Events include, 
but not limited to the following: 
x Non-significant Infiltrative Event (NSIE)

x Contact [CONTACT_32984] 
x Localized Allergic Reactions 
x Any corneal event not explicitly defined as serious or significant adverse event, which 
necessitates temporary lens  discontinuation < [ADDRESS_385213] (ADE) – An ADE is an “adverse even t related to the use of an 
investigational medical device.” 
NOTE 1 : This definition includes adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate 
instructions for use, deploymen t, implantation, installation, or  operation, or any malfunction 
of the investigational medical device. NOTE 2 : This definition includes any event resulting from use error or from intentional misuse 
of the investigational medical device.
[ADDRESS_385214] (UADE) – A UADE is any seri ous adverse effect on 
health or safety or any life-t hreatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, the test 
article, if that effect, problem, or death was no t previously identified in nature, severity, or 
degree of incidence in the inve stigational plan, Investigator’s  Brochure or protocol, or any 
other unanticipated serious problem  associated with the test artic le that relates to the rights, 
safety and welfare of subjects. 
13.2. Assessing Adverse Events 
In conjunction with the medical monitor, the Inves tigator will evaluate adverse events to ensure 
the events are categorized correctly. Elements of categorization will include: 
x Seriousness/Classifications (s ee definition in section 13.1). 
CR-6530, v 1.0  
 
Page 40 of 137JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol 
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.  
 
 
 
 x Causality or Relatedness – i.e. the relations hip between the test article, study treatment 
or study procedures and the adverse even t (not related, unlikely related, possibly 
related, or related - see de finition in section 13.2.1). 
x Adverse Event Severity – Adverse event seve rity is used to assess the degree of 
intensity of the adverse event (mild, moderate , or severe - see definition in section 
13.2.2). 
x Outcome – not recovered or not resolve d, recovering or resolving, recovered or 
resolved with sequelae, rec overed or resolved, death rela ted to adverse event, or 
unknown. 
x Actions Taken – none, temporarily discontinue d, permanently disc ontinued, or other. 
13.2.1. Causality Assessment 
Causality Assessment – A determination of the relationshi p between an adverse event and the 
test article. The test article  relationship for each adverse event should be determined by [CONTACT_19575]: 
x Not Related- An adverse event that is not related to the use of the test article, study treatment or study procedures. 
x Unlikely Related – An adverse event for which an alternative explanation is more likely, e.g. concomitant treatmen t, concomitant disease(s), or  the relationship of time 
suggests that a causal rela tionship is not likely. 
x Possibly Related – An adverse event that might be due to the use of the test article, or 
to the study treatment or study procedures. An alternative ex planation, e.g. concomitant 
treatment, concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in time is reasonable. Therefore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded. 
x Related – An adverse event that is listed as a possible adverse effect  (device) or adverse 
reaction (drug) and cannot be reasonably e xplained by [CONTACT_4867], e.g. 
concomitant treatment of concomitant dis ease(s). The relationship in time is very 
suggestive, e.g. it is confirmed by [INVESTIGATOR_5328]-challenge and re-challenge. 
13.2.2. Severity Assessment 
Severity Assessment – A qualitative assessment of the degr ee of intensity of an adverse event 
as determined by [CONTACT_19577]/her by [CONTACT_423]. The assessment of severity is made irresp ective of test article, st udy treatment or study pr ocedure relationship or 
seriousness of the event and should be eval uated according to the following scale: 
x Mild – Event is noticeable to the subject but  is easily tolerated and does not interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities. 
x Moderate – Event is bothersome, possibl e requiring additional therapy, and may 
interfere with the subj ect’s daily activities. 
x Severe – Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of therapy 
and interferes with the subject’s daily activities.

 13.3. Documentation and Follow-Up of Adverse Events 
The recording and documenting of adverse even ts (ocular and non-ocular) begin when the 
subjects are exposed to the test article, study treatment or study procedure.  Adverse events 
reported before the use of test article, start of study treatment, or study procedures will be 
recorded as medical history. However, if the co ndition deteriorates at any time during the study 
it will be recorded and reported as an AE. Untowa rd medical events reported after the subject’s 
exit from the study will be record ed as adverse events at the discretion of the Investigator. 
 Upon finding an adverse event, the Principal In vestigator will documen t the condition in the 
subject record and in the eCRFs and complete the Adverse Event eCRF.   
 Complete descriptions of all adverse events must be available in the subject record. All Adverse Events including local and systemic re actions not meeting the criteria for “serious 
adverse events” shall be captured on the appropriat e case report form or electronic data system. 
All adverse events occurring wh ile the subject is enrolled in  the study must be documented 
appropriately regardle ss of relationship.   
 It is the Investigator’s responsib ility to maintain docu mentation of each repo rted adverse event. 
All adverse events will be follow ed in accordance with applicab le licensing requirements. Such 
documentation will include the following: 
x Adverse event (diagnosis not symptom). 
x Drawings or photographs (whe re appropriate) that deta il the finding (e.g., size, 
location, and depth, etc.). 
x Date the clinical site was notified. 
x Date and time of onset. 
x Date and time of resolution. 
x Adverse event classification, severity, and re lationship to test arti cles, as applicable. 
x Treatment regimen instituted (where appropr iate), including concomitant medications 
prescribed, in accordance with a pplicable licensing requirements. 
x Any referral to another hea lth care provider if needed. 
x Outcome, ocular damage (if any). 
x Likely etiology. 
x Best corrected visual acuity at the disc overy of the event and upon conclusion of the 
event, if the AE is related to the visual system. 
 Upon discovery of an AE that is deemed ‘possibly related’ or ‘r elated’ to the te st article or 
study procedures (whether related to the visu al system or not), an AE review form  
must be completed. Additional dated and initi aled entries should be made at follow-up 
evaluations. Separate forms must be completed for each eye if the AE is bilateral.  
 
In addition, if an infiltrate(s) is present, he/she will complete the Corneal Infiltrate Assessment eCRF. Where necessary, a culture of the corneal lesion will be collected to determine if the 
infection is microbial in nature. If cultures are collected, the date of culture collection and laboratory utilized will be recorded.  
CR-6530, v 1.0  
 
Page 42 of 137JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol 
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.  
 
 
 
  Changes in the severity of an AE shall be documented to allow an assessment of the duration 
of the event at each level of intensity to be performed. Adverse events characterized as 
intermittent require documentation of the onset and duration of each ep isode. Changes in the 
assessment of relationship to  the Test Article shall al so be clearly documented. 
 
Subjects who present with an adverse event sh all be followed by [CONTACT_737], within 
licensure, until all signs and symptoms have retu rned to pre-treatment status, stabilized, or 
been satisfactorily reso lved. If further treatment beyond licens ure is required, the patient will 
be referred to the appropriate health care provi der. The Investigator wi ll use his/her clinical 
judgment as to whether a subject reporting with  an adverse event will continue in the study. If 
a subject is discontinued from th e study, it will be the responsibil ity of the Inve stigator to 
record the reason for discontin uation. The Investigator will al so document the adverse event 
appropriately and complete the Adverse Ev ent eCRF. Any subjects with ongoing adverse 
events related to the test articl e, study treatment or study procedures, as of  the final study visit 
date, should be followed  to resolution of the adverse event or until referral to an appropriate 
health care provider, as recommended by [CONTACT_57748]. Non-ocular adverse events that are 
not related to the test articl e, study treatment, or study proc edures may be recorded as 
“ongoing” without fu rther follow-up. 
13.4. Reporting Adverse Events  
The Investigator will not ify the Sponsor of an adverse even t by e-mail, facsim ile, or telephone 
as soon as possible and no later than 24 hours fr om discovery for any serious /significant 
adverse events, and 2 days from discovery for a ny non-significant adverse event. In addition, 
a written report will be submitted by [CONTACT_163080]/IRB according to 
their requirements (section 13.4.2). The report will comment whether the adverse event was 
considered to be related to the test article, study treatment or study procedures. 
13.4.1. Reporting Adverse Events to Sponsor 
Serious/Significant Adverse Events The Investigator will inform th e sponsor of all serious/signif icant adverse events occurring 
during the study period as soon as possible by e-mail or telephone , but no later than 24 hours 
following discovery of the event. The Inves tigator is obligated to pursue and obtain 
information requested by [CONTACT_312800]. All 
subjects experiencing a serious/significant advers e event must be followed up and all outcomes 
must be reported.  When medically necessary, the Investigator may break the randomization code to determine the identity of the treatment that the subject received. The Sponsor and study monitor should 
be notified prior to unmasking the test articles.  In the event of a serious/significant a dverse event, the Investigator must: 
x Notify the Sponsor immediately. 
CR-6530, v 1.0  
 
Page 43 of 137JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Clinical Study Protocol 
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.  
 
 
 
 x Obtain and maintain in the subject’s reco rds all pertinent medical information and 
medical judgment for colleagues who assist ed in the treatment and follow-up of the 
subject. 
x Provide the Sponsor with a complete case hi story which includes a statement as to 
whether the event was or was not relate d to the use of the test article. 
x Notify the IEC/IRB as required by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB reporting pro cedure according to 
national regulations. 
 
Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE) In the event of an Unanticipated (Serious) A dverse Device Effect (UADE), the Investigator 
will submit a report of the UADE to  the Sponsor and IEC/IRB as soon as possible, but no later 
than [ADDRESS_385215] report the results of the 
evaluation to FDA, the IEC/IRB and participati ng Investigators within [ADDRESS_385216]. 
 Non-Serious Adverse Events All non-serious adverse events, including non-seri ous adverse device effe cts, will be reported 
to the sponsor by [CONTACT_312801] 2 days from discovery. 
13.4.2. Reporting Adverse Events to the Respon sible IEC/IRB and He alth Authorities 
Adverse events that meet the IEC/IRB requirements for reporting must be reported within the 
IEC/IRB’s written guidelines. Each clinical site will refer to and follow any guidelines set forth 
by [CONTACT_19581]/IRB. Each clinical site w ill refer to and follow any guidelines set forth 
by [CONTACT_19582]. 
 The Sponsor will report a pplicable Adverse Events to the lo cal health author ities according to 
the written guidelines, incl uding reporting timelines.  
13.5. Event of Special Interest 
None. 
13.6. Reporting of Pregnancy 
Subjects reporting pregnancy (by [CONTACT_6270]-report) dur ing the study will be discontinued after the 
event is recorded as an Adverse Event. Once discontinued, pregnant participants and their 
fetuses will not be monitored for study rela ted purposes. Pregnant participants are not 
discontinued from contact [CONTACT_71179], but due to general concerns relating to pr egnancy and contact [CONTACT_19584]. Specifically, pregnant women are 
discontinued due to fluctuations in refractive error and/or visual acuity that occur secondary to systemic hormonal changes, and not due to unforeseen health ri sks to the mother or fetus.

 14. STATISTICAL METHODS 
14.1. General Considerations 
Statistical Analysis will be undertaken by [CONTACT_941] s ponsor or under the authority of the sponsor. A 
general description of the statisti cal methods to be implemented in this clinical trial is outlined 
below.   
 All data summaries and statistical analyses will  be performed using the SAS software Version 
9.4 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
[ADDRESS_385217]/eye will be used when available fo r summarization and statistical analysis. 
 Summary tables (descriptive statistics and/or frequ ency tables) will be provided for all baseline 
variables, efficacy variables a nd safety variables as appropriat e. Continuous variables will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics (n, mean , standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, 
and maximum). Frequency count and percentage of subjects or eyes within each category will be provided for categorical data.  Summaries will be presented separately by [CONTACT_312802] (Safety Population, Per-Protocol 
Population, and Intent-to-Treat, when appr opriate) and as described in section 14.3.  
14.2. Sample Size Justification 
This study was not designed or powered to test any statistical hypotheses as this will be the 
first time the Test lens is clinically evaluate d, hence there was no historical data available for 
these lenses. While the Control lens has been evaluated in previous cl inical trials, ocular 
symptoms following lens settling are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_312775]. Th erefore, The sample size was 
chosen by [CONTACT_312803][INVESTIGATOR_312776]. 
 While there are no planned analyses, a power an alysis was performed for the percentage of 
“Moderate” or “Severe” ocular sy mptoms following lens settling and after at least [ADDRESS_385218] for 
statistical difference between study lenses based on 30 subjects to complete. Power 
calculations were performed us ing SAS Software Version 9.4. Moderate and Severe ocular 
symptoms were converted to a binary response as ܻ = [ADDRESS_385219] eye reported a moderate 
or severe ocular symptom and ܻ = [ADDRESS_385220], and between lenses. A total of 2000 
replicating trials were simulated with different scenarios of reference rates. Given the rare event moderate or severe ocular symptoms each replicated sample was analyzed using a 
Bayesian beta-binomial model with correlated binary data (Diniz et al; 2010).
6,7 For each 
simulated trial, the upper bound of the 95% central posterior credible interval constructed for the percentage of moderate and severe ocular symptoms for each  lens and was compared to a 
margin of 5%. Additionally, the upper bound of the 95% central posterior credible interval  for 
CR-6530, v 1.0

Clinical Study Protocol 
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.  
 
 
 
 the difference between study lenses, with respec t to the percentage of  moderate and sever 
ocular symptoms was compared  to a margin of 2.5%.  
 
Table 6, below displays different scenarios of statistical tests and effect sizes. Two power 
analyses were performed as both the rate of overall prevalence for each lens as well as the 
difference between rates is encompassed within the primary objective. Furthermore, the power 
estimates were calculated using two credible inte rval levels (90 and 95), to ensure that the

WARNING: UV absorbing contact [CONTACT_35539], such as UV absorbing goggles or sunglasses because they do not completely cover the eye and surrounding area. The patient should continue to use UV absorbing eyewear as directed.
ACTIONS
In its hydrated state, the contact [CONTACT_13293], when placed on the cornea, acts as a refracting medium to focus light rays onto the retina.
The transmittance characteristics for these lenses are less than 1% in the 
UVB range of 280 nm to 315 nm and less than 10% in the UVA range of 316 nm to 380 nm for the entire power range.

WARNINGS
Patients should be advised of the following warnings pertaining to 
contact [CONTACT_13279]:
EYE PROBLEMS, INCLUDING CORNEAL ULCERS, CAN DEVELOP 
RAPI[INVESTIGATOR_35458]; IF THE PATIENT EXPE-RIENCES:
• Eye Discomfort,
• Excessive Tearing,• Vision Changes,• Loss of Vision,• Eye Redness,• Or Other Eye Problems, 
THE PATIENT SHOULD BE INSTRUCTED TO IMMEDIATELY RE-
MOVE THE LENSES AND PROMPTLY CONTACT [CONTACT_35546].
• When prescribed for daily wear, patients should be instructed not 
to wear lenses while sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Clinical studies have shown that 
the risk of serious adverse reactions is increased when lenses are worn overnight, and that the risk of ulcerative keratitis is greater for 
CR-6530, v 1.[ADDRESS_385230] lens users than for daily wear users.3
• Studies have shown that contact [CONTACT_126129] a higher incidence of adverse reactions than nonsmokers.
• Problems with contact [CONTACT_126130]. Patients should be cautioned that proper 
use and care of contact [CONTACT_126131].
• The overall risk of ulcerative keratitis may be reduced by [CONTACT_126132].

Speciﬁ  c Instructions for Use and Warnings:
• Water Activity
Instructions for Use
Do not expose contact [CONTACT_35551].WARNING:
Water can harbor microorganisms that can lead to severe infection, vision loss or blindness. If lenses have been submersed in water when participating in water sports or swimming in pools, hot tubs, lakes, or oceans, the patient should be instructed to discard them and replace them with a new pair. The Eye Care Professional should be consulted for recommendations regarding wearing lenses during any activity involving water.
PRECAUTIONS
Special Precautions for Eye Care Professionals:
• Due to the small number of patients enrolled in clinical investiga-
tion of lenses, all refractive powers, design conﬁ  gurations, or lens parameters available in the lens material are not evaluated in signif-icant numbers. Consequently, when selecting an appropriate lens design and parameters, the Eye Care Professional should consider all characteristics of the lens that can affect lens performance and ocular health, including oxygen permeability, wettability, central and peripheral thickness, and optic zone diameter.
CR-6530, v 1.0  
 
Page 70 of 137JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
• The potential impact of these factors on the patient’s ocular health 
should be carefully weighed against the patient’s need for refractive 
correction; therefore, the continuing ocular health of the patient and lens performance on the eye should be carefully monitored by [CONTACT_71187].
• Patients who wear these lenses to correct presby[CONTACT_35553]-
vision may not achieve the best corrected visual acuity for either far or near vision. Visual requirements vary with the individual and should be considered when selecting the most appropriate type of lens for each patient.
• Fluorescein, a yellow dye, should not be used while the lenses are 
on the eyes. The lenses absorb this dye and become discolored. Whenever ﬂ  uorescein is used in eyes, the eyes should be ﬂ  ushed with a sterile saline solution that is recommended for in-eye use.
• Eye Care Professionals should instruct the patient to remove the 
lenses immediately if the eyes become red or irritated. 
Eye Care Professionals should carefully instruct patients about the following care regimen and safety precautions.
Handling Precautions:
• Before leaving the Eye Care Professional’s ofﬁ  ce, the patient should 
be able to promptly remove the lenses or should have someone 
else available who can remove the lenses for him or her. 
• DO NOT use if the sterile blister package is opened or damaged. 
• Always wash and rinse hands before handling lenses. Do not get 
cosmetics, lotions, soaps, creams, deodorants, or sprays in the 
eyes or on the lenses. It is best to put on lenses before putting on makeup. Water-based cosmetics are less likely to damage lenses than oil-based products. 
• DO NOT touch contact [CONTACT_35554] ﬁ  ngers or hands if the 
hands are not free of foreign materials, as microscopic scratches of the lenses may occur, causing distorted vision and/or injury to the eye.
• Carefully follow the handling, insertion, removal, and wearing 
instructions in the “Patient Instruction Guide” for the prescribed 
CR-6530, v 1.0  
 
Page 71 of 137JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
wearing schedule and those prescribed by [CONTACT_35555].
• Always handle lenses carefully and avoid droppi[INVESTIGATOR_35459].
• Never use tweezers or other tools to remove lenses from the lens 
container unless speciﬁ  cally indicated for that use. Slide the lens up 
the side of the bowl until it is free of the container. 
• Do not touch the lens with ﬁ  ngernails. 
Lens Wearing Precautions:
• If the lens sticks (stops moving) on the eye, follow the recom-
mended directions in “Care for a Sticking (Non-Moving) Lens." The lens should move freely on the eye for the continued health of the eye. If non-movement of the lens continues, the patient should be instructed to immediately consult his or her Eye Care Professional.
• Never wear lenses beyond the period recommended by [CONTACT_71188].
• The patient should be advised to never allow anyone else to wear 
their lenses. They have been prescribed to ﬁ  t their eyes and to correct their vision to the degree necessary. Sharing lenses greatly increases the chance of eye infections.
• If aerosol products, such as hair spray, are used while wearing 
lenses, exercise caution and keep eyes closed until the spray has settled.
• Avoid all harmful or irritating vapors and fumes while wearing 
lenses. 
• Always discard lenses worn as prescribed by [CONTACT_35555]. 
Lens Care Precautions:  
• The patient should be informed that no cleaning or disinfection is 
needed when lenses are worn for daily disposable wear.  Patients should always dispose of lenses when removed and have spare lenses or spectacles available.
CR-6530, v 1.0  
 
Page 72 of 137JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Other Topi[INVESTIGATOR_35460]:
• Always contact [CONTACT_35558]-
cine in the eyes. 
• Certain medications, such as antihistamines, decongestants, 
diuretics, muscle relaxants, tranquilizers, and those for motion 
sickness may cause dryness of the eye, increased lens awareness, or blurred vision. Should such conditions exist, proper remedial measures should be prescribed. Depending on the severity, this could include the use of lubricating drops that are indicated for use with soft contact [CONTACT_71189]. 
• Oral contraceptive users could develop visual changes or changes 
in lens tolerance when using contact [CONTACT_13276]. Patients should be cautioned accordingly. 
• As with any contact [CONTACT_13293], follow-up visits are necessary to assure 
the continuing health of the patient’s eyes. The patient should be instructed as to a recommended follow-up schedule. 
Who Should Know That the Patient is Wearing Contact [CONTACT_32993]?
• Patients should inform all doctors (Health Care Professionals) about 
being a contact [CONTACT_35560]. 
• Patients should always inform their employer of being a contact 
[CONTACT_35560]. Some jobs may require use of eye protection equip-ment or may require that the patient not wear contact [CONTACT_13276]. 
ADVERSE REACTIONS
The patient should be informed that the following problems may occur when wearing contact [CONTACT_13276]:
• The eye may burn, sting, and/or itch.
• There may be less comfort than when the lens was ﬁ  rst placed on 
the eye.
• There may be a feeling of something in the eye (foreign body, 
scratched area).
• There may be the potential for some temporary impairment due to 
CR-6530, v 1.0  
 
Page 73 of 137JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
peripheral inﬁ  ltrates, peripheral corneal ulcers, or corneal erosion. 
There may be the potential for other physiological observations, such as local or generalized edema, corneal neovascularization, corneal staining, injection, tarsal abnormalities, iritis, and conjuncti-vitis; some of which are clinically acceptable in low amounts.
• There may be excessive watering, unusual eye secretions, or 
redness of the eye.
• Poor visual acuity, blurred vision, rainbows, or halos around 
objects, photophobia, or dry eyes may also occur if the lenses are worn continuously or for too long a time.
The patient should be instructed to conduct a simple 3-part self-examina-tion at least once a day. They should ask themselves:
• How do the lenses feel on my eyes?
• How do my eyes look?• Have I noticed a change in my vision? 
If the patient reports any problems, he or she should be instructed to 
IMMEDIATELY REMOVE THE LENS. If the problem or discomfort stops, the patient should discard the lens and place a new fresh lens on the eye.
If after inserting the new lens, the problem continues, the patient should be 
directed to IMMEDIATELY REMOVE THE LENS AND CONTACT [CONTACT_35561].
The patient should be instructed NOT to use a new lens as self-treatment 
for the problem.
The patient should be advised that when any of the above symptoms oc-
cur, a serious condition such as infection, corneal ulcer, neovascularization, or iritis may be present. He or she should be instructed to seek immediate professional identiﬁ  cation of the problem and prompt treatment to avoid serious eye damage.

GENERAL FITTING GUIDELINES
A. Patient Selection
Patients selected to wear these lenses should be chosen based on: 
• Motivation to wear lenses 
• Ability to follow instructions regarding lens wear care
• General health 
• Ability to adequately handle and care for the lenses 
• Ability to understand the risk and beneﬁ  ts of lens wear
Patients who do not meet the above criteria should not be provided with contact [CONTACT_13276]. 
B. Pre-ﬁ  tting Examination
Initial evaluation of the patient should begin with a thorough case history 
to determine if there are any contraindications to contact [CONTACT_13279]. During 
the case history, the patient’s visual needs and expectations should be 
determined as well as an assessment of their overall ocular, physical, and 
mental health. 
Preceding the initial selection of trial contact [CONTACT_13276], a comprehensive 
ocular evaluation should be performed that includes, but is not limited to, 
the measurement of distance and near visual acuity, distance and near 
refractive prescription (including determining the preferred reading distance 
for presby[CONTACT_35562]), keratometry, and biomicroscopic evaluation. 
Based on this evaluation, if it is determined that the patient is eligible to 
wear these lenses, the Eye Care Professional should proceed to the lens 
ﬁ  tting instructions as outlined below. 
C. Initial Power Determination
A spectacle refraction should be performed to establish the patient’s 
baseline refractive status and to guide in the selection of the appropriate 
lens power. Remember to compensate for vertex distance if the refraction 
is greater than ±4.00D.
D. Base Curve Selection (Trial Lens Fitting)
The following trial lenses should be selected for patients regardless of kera-
tometry readings. However, corneal curvature measurements should be 
performed to establish the patient’s baseline ocular status. 
CR-6530, v 1.0  
 
Page 75 of 137JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
• ACUVUE OASYS® 1-Day: 8.5 mm/14.3 mm
• ACUVUE OASYS® 1-Day for ASTIGMATISM: 8.5 mm/14.3 mm
The trial lens should be placed on each of the patient's eyes and evaluated 
after the patient has adjusted to the lenses.  
1. Criteria of a Properly Fit Lens 
A properly ﬁ  t lens will center and completely cover the cornea (i.e., no limbal exposure), have sufﬁ  cient movement to provide tear exchange under the contact [CONTACT_35563], and be comfortable. The lens should move freely when manipulated digitally with the lower lid, and then return to its properly centered position when released.
2. Criteria of a Flat Fitting Lens 
A ﬂ  at ﬁ  tting lens may exhibit one or more of the following characteris-tics: decentration, incomplete corneal coverage (i.e., limbal exposure), excessive movement with the blink, and/or edge standoff. If the lens is judged to be ﬂ  at ﬁ  tting, it should not be dispensed to the patient.
3. Criteria of a Steep Fitting Lens 
A steep ﬁ  tting lens may exhibit one or more of the following charac-teristics: insufﬁ  cient movement with the blink, conjunctival indentation, and resistance when pushing the lens up digitally with the lower lid. If the lens is judged to be steep ﬁ  tting, it should not be dispensed to the patient.
If the initial trial base curve is judged to be ﬂ  at or steep ﬁ  tting, the alternate base curve, if available, should be trial ﬁ  t and evaluated after the patient has adjusted to the lens. The lens should move freely when manipulated digitally with the lower lid, and then return to a properly centered position when released. If resistance is encountered when pushing the lens up, the lens is ﬁ  tting tightly and should not be dispensed to the patient.
E. Final Lens Power (Spherical)
A spherical over-refraction should be performed to determine the ﬁ  nal lens power after the lens ﬁ  t is judged acceptable. The spherical over-refraction should be combined with the trial lens power to determine the ﬁ  nal lens prescription. The patient should experience good visual acuity with the correct lens power unless there is excessive residual astigmatism.
CR-6530, v 1.0  
 
Page 76 of 137JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Example 1
Diagnostic lens: -2.00DSpherical over-refraction: -0.25D
Final lens power: -2.25D
Example 2
Diagnostic lens: -2.00DSpherical over-refraction: +0.25D
Final lens power: -1.75D
If vision is acceptable, perform a slit lamp examination to assess adequate 
ﬁ  t (centration and movement). If the ﬁ  t is acceptable, dispense the lenses and instruct the patient to return in one week for reassessment (see dispensing and follow up information in PATIENT MANAGEMENT).
All patients should be supplied with a copy of the PATIENT 
INSTRUCTION GUIDE for these lenses. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_35461].acuvue.com.
TORIC FITTING GUIDELINES
Although most aspects of the ﬁ  tting procedure are identical for all types 
of soft contact [CONTACT_13276], including toric lenses, there are some additional steps and/or rules to follow to assure the proper ﬁ  t of toric lenses.
The only new steps you must follow in prescribing ACUVUE
 OASYS® 
1-Day for ASTIGMATISM are that you must determine the stability, 
repeatability, and drift angle of the lens axis so that you can prescribe the correct lens axis for the patient.
A. How to Determine Lens Cylinder and Axis Orientation 
1. Locate the Orientation Marks
To help determine the proper orientation of the toric lens, you’ll 
ﬁ  nd two primary marks approximately 1 mm from the lens edge representing the vertical position on opposite ends of the lens at 6 and 12 o’clock (Fig. 1). Because of the lens’ ballasting system, either mark can represent the vertical position – there is no “top” and “bottom” as in a prism-ballasted lens. You don’t need to view both marks to assess orientation; simply look for the 6 o’clock mark as you would with a prism-ballasted lens.
CR-6530, v 1.0  
 
Page 77 of 137JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Figure 1
You’ll need a slit lamp biomicroscope with a 1 to 2 mm 
parallelepi[INVESTIGATOR_35462] ﬁ  tted to the eye. There are a number of techniques you can use to improve the visibility of the 6 o’clock mark. Using a parallelepi[INVESTIGATOR_35463]ﬁ  cation (10x or 15x), slowly pan down the lens, looking just below the direct illumination at the retroilluminated area. Backlighting the mark this way should make it more visible. Sometimes manipulating the lower lid may be necessary to uncover the mark.
2. Observe Lens Rotation and Stability
Observe the position and stability of the “bottom” mark. It usually stabilizes at the 6 o’clock position. If it does, calculation of the lens power will be straightforward. The 6 o’clock position is not a “must”; however, the absolute requirement is that the axis position be stable and repeatable.
The mark may stabilize somewhat left or right (drift) of the vertical 
meridian and still enable you to ﬁ  t a toric lens for that eye, as long as the lens always returns to the same “drift axis” position after settling. The deviation can be compensated for in the ﬁ  nal prescription. Your objective is to ensure that whatever position the initial lens assumes near 6 o’clock, this position must be stable and repeatable. With full eye movement or heavy blink, you may see the marks swing away, but they must return quickly to the original stable position. If the lens does not return quickly, you may need to select a different lens.
3. Assessing Rotation
Imagine the eye as a clock dial and every hour represents a 30° interval. If the orientation mark of the initial lens stabilizes somewhat left or right of the vertical position, the ﬁ  nal lens will orient on the eye with the same deviation. You can use an axis reticule in the slit lamp or use a line-scribed lens in a spectacle trial frame to measure or estimate the “drift angle” of the cylinder axis.
To compensate for this “drift”, measure or estimate the “drift”, then 
add or subtract it from the refractive axis to determine the correct cylinder axis. Use the LARS (Left Add, Right Subtract) method to determine which direction to compensate.
CR-6530, v 1.0  
 
Page 78 of 137JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
B. Final Lens Power 
When the diagnostic lens has its axis aligned in the same meridian 
as the patient’s refractive axis, a spherocylindrical over-refraction may be performed and visual acuity determined. However, in the case of crossed axes, such as when the diagnostic lens axis is different from the spectacle cylinder axis, it is not advisable to perform a full spherocylindrical over-refraction because of the difﬁ  culty in computing the resultant power. A spherical over-refraction without cylinder refraction may be performed. 
If the required cylinder correction falls between two available cylinder 
powers, it is recommended to prescribe the lower cylinder power lens. See below for instructions on how to determine the ﬁ  nal lens power.
1. For the Sphere
If sphere alone or combined sphere and cylinder Rx > ±4.00D, 
compensate for vertex distance. If sphere alone or combined sphere and cylinder Rx ≤ ±4.00D, vertex compensation is not necessary.
2. For the Cylinder
Adjust the axis by [CONTACT_35564]. Choose a cylinder that is ≤ 0.50D from the refractive cylinder.
3. Case Examples
Example [ADDRESS_385231] (spectacle) refraction:
O.D. -2.50D / -1.25D x 180° 20/20O.S. -2.00D / -1.00D x 180° 20/20
Choose a diagnostic lens for each eye with axis 180°. Place 
the lens on each eye and allow a minimum of 3 minutes for it to equilibrate, based on the patient’s initial response to the lens. If the lens has not yet stabilized, recheck until stable.
Check the orientation of the axis mark. If the bottom axis mark 
is in the 6 o’clock position on both eyes, choose the appropriate cylinder as listed previously. If the lens has not yet stabilized, recheck until stable.
Here is the Rx Prescribed:
O.D. -2.50D / -1.25D x 180°O.S. -2.00D / -0.75D x 180°
CR-6530, v 1.[ADDRESS_385232] (spectacle) refraction:O.D. -3.00D / -1.00D x 90° 20/20O.S. -4.75D / -2.00D x 90° 20/20
Choose diagnostic lenses of -3.00D / -0.75D x 90° for the right 
eye and -4.50D / -1.75D x 90° for the left eye, the nearest lenses available to the spherical power, cylinder power, and axis needed. For the left eye, since the manifest refraction called for -4.75D, compensating for vertex distance the sphere is reduced by 0.25D to -4.50D. The cylinder power will be -1.75D. Place the lens on each eye and allow a minimum of 3 minutes for it to equilibrate, based on the patient's initial response to the lens. If the lens has not yet stabilized, recheck until stable. 
Right Eye
The orientation mark on the right lens rotates left from the 6 
o’clock position by 10° and remains stable in this position. Compensation for this rotation should be done as follows: 
Compensate the 10° axis drift by [CONTACT_35565].
Here is the Rx Prescribed:
O.D. -3.00D / -0.75D x 100°
Left Eye
The orientation mark on the left lens rotates right from the 6 
o’clock position by 10° and remains stable in this position. 
Compensate for the 10° axis drift by [CONTACT_35566]. 
Here is the Rx Prescribed: 
O.S. -4.50D / -1.75D x 80°
If vision is acceptable, perform a slit lamp examination to assess 
adequate ﬁ  t (centration and movement). If ﬁ  t is acceptable, dispense the lenses instructing the patient to return in one week for reassessment (see dispensing and follow-up information in PATIENT MANAGEMENT).
All patients should be supplied with a copy of the PATIENT INSTRUCTION GUIDE for these lenses. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_35461].acuvue.com.
CR-6530, v 1.[ADDRESS_385233] adequately 
corrected distance and near visual acuity in each eye. The amblyopic patient or the patient with signiﬁ  cant astigmatism (greater than 1.00D) in one eye may not be a good candidate for monovision correction with these lenses.
Occupational and environmental visual demands should be 
considered. If the patient requires critical vision (visual acuity and stereopsis), it should be determined by [CONTACT_71190]. Monovision contact [CONTACT_35568]:
• visually demanding situations such as operating potentially 
dangerous machinery or performing other potentially hazardous 
activities; and
• driving automobiles (e.g., driving at night). Patients who cannot 
meet state driver's licensing requirements with monovision correction should be advised to not drive with this correction, OR may require that additional over-correction be prescribed.
2. Patient Education
All patients do not function equally well with monovision correc-tion. Patients may not perform as well for certain tasks with this correction as they have with spectacles (multifocal, bifocal, trifocal, readers, progressives). Each patient should understand that monovision, as well as other presby[CONTACT_35569], can create a vision compromise that may reduce visual acuity and depth perception for distance and near tasks. Therefore, caution should be exercised when the patient is wearing the correction for the ﬁ  rst time until they are familiar with the vision provided in visually chal-lenging environments (e.g., reading a menu in a dim restaurant, driving at night in rainy/foggy conditions, etc.). During the ﬁ  tting process, it is necessary for the patient to realize the disadvantages as well as the advantages of clear near vision and straight ahead and upward gaze that monovision contact [CONTACT_35570].
CR-6530, v 1.0  
 
Page 81 of 137JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
B. Eye Selection
1. Ocular Preference Determination Methods
Generally, the non-dominant eye is corrected for near vision. The 
following two methods for eye dominance can be used.
Method 1:  Determine which eye is the “sighting eye.” Have the 
patient point to an object at the far end of the room. 
Cover one eye. If the patient is still pointing directly at the object, the eye being used is the dominant (sighting) eye.
Method 2:  Determine which eye will accept the added power with 
the least reduction in vision. Place a hand-held trial lens equal to the spectacle near ADD in front of one eye and then the other while the distance refractive error correction is in place for both eyes. Determine whether the patient functions best with the near ADD lens over the right or left eye.
2. Other Eye Selection Methods
Other methods include the "Refractive Error Method" and the "Visual Demands Method."
Refractive Error MethodFor anisometropic correction, it is generally best to ﬁ  t the more 
hyperopic (less myopic) eye for distance and the more myopic (less hyperopic) eye for near.
Visual Demands Method
Consider the patient’s occupation during the eye selection process 
to determine the critical vision requirements. If a patient’s gaze for near tasks is usually in one direction, correct the eye on that side for near.
Example: A secretary who places copy to the left side of the desk 
will function best with the near lens on the left eye.
C. Special Fitting Characteristics
1. Unilateral Vision Correction
There are circumstances where only one contact [CONTACT_35571]. As an example, an emmetropic patient would only require a near lens, whereas a bilateral myope would require corrective lenses on 
CR-6530, v 1.0  
 
Page 82 of 137JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
both eyes.
Examples: A presby[CONTACT_35572] a +1.75D ADD 
would have a +1.75D lens on the near eye and the other eye left without correction. 
A presby[CONTACT_35573] a +1.50D ADD who is -2.50D 
myopic in the right eye and -1.50D myopic in the left eye may have the right eye corrected for distance and the left uncorrected for near.
2. Near ADD Determination
Always prescribe the lens power for the near eye that provides optimal near acuity at the midpoint of the patient’s habitual reading distance. However, when more than one power provides optimal reading performance, prescribe the least plus (most minus) of the powers.
3. Trial Lens Fitting
A trial ﬁ  tting is performed in the ofﬁ  ce to allow the patient to experience monovision correction. Lenses are ﬁ  t according to the GENERAL FITTING GUIDELINES for base curve selection described in this Package Insert.
Case history and standard clinical evaluation procedure should 
be used to determine the prognosis. Determine the distance correction and the near correction. Next determine the near ADD. With trial lenses of the proper power in place, observe the reaction to this mode of correction.
Allow the lenses to settle for about [ADDRESS_385234] the patient look at you. Assess the patient’s reaction to distance vision under these circumstances. Then have the patient look at familiar near objects such as a watch face or ﬁ  ngernails. Again assess the reaction. As the patient continues to look around the room at both near and distance objects, observe the reactions. Only after these vision tests are completed should the patient be asked to read print. Evaluate the patient’s reaction to large print (e.g., typewritten copy) at ﬁ  rst and then graduate to newsprint and ﬁ  nally smaller type sizes.
After the patient’s performance under the above conditions 
is completed, tests of visual acuity and reading ability under 
CR-6530, v 1.[ADDRESS_385235] several weeks of wear (when adaptation is occurring), it may be advisable for the patient to only drive during optimal driving conditions. After adaptation and success with these activities, the patient should be able to drive under other conditions with caution.
D. Other Suggestions
The success of the monovision technique may be further improved by [CONTACT_35574]:
• Have a third contact [CONTACT_13293] (distance power) to use when critical 
distance viewing is needed.
• Have a third contact [CONTACT_13293] (near power) to use when critical near 
viewing is needed.
• Having supplemental spectacles to wear over the monovision 
contact [CONTACT_35575]ﬁ  c visual tasks may improve the success of monovision correction. This is particularly applicable for those patients who cannot meet state driver's licensing requirements with monovision correction.
• Make use of proper illumination when carrying out visual tasks.

Monovision ﬁ  tting success can be improved by [CONTACT_35576]:
• Reverse the distance and near eyes if a patient is having trouble 
adapting.
• Reﬁ  ne the lens powers if there is trouble with adaptation. 
Accurate lens power is critical for presby[CONTACT_35577].
• Emphasize the beneﬁ  ts of clear near vision and straight ahead 
and upward gaze with monovision.
The decision to ﬁ  t a patient with monovision correction is most appropriately left to the Eye Care Professional in conjunction with the patient after carefully considering the patient’s needs.
All patients should be supplied with a copy of the PATIENT 
INSTRUCTION GUIDE for these lenses. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_35461].acuvue.com.
PATIENT MANAGEMENT
Dispensing Visit
Each sterile lens is supplied in a foil-sealed plastic package containing 
buffered saline solution with methyl ether cellulose. To remove the lens from the container, peel back the foil seal, place a ﬁ  nger on the lens, and slide the lens up the side of the bowl of the lens package until it is free of the container.
• Evaluate the physical ﬁ  t and visual acuity of the lens on each eye.
• Teach the patient how to apply and remove his or her lenses.
• Explain daily disposable lens wear and schedule a follow-up examination.
• Provide the patient with a copy of the PATIENT 
INSTRUCTION GUIDE for these lenses. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_35461].acuvue.com.
REVIEW THESE INSTRUCTIONS WITH THE PATIENT SO THAT HE 
OR SHE CLEARLY UNDERSTANDS THE PRESCRIBED WEARING AND REPLACEMENT SCHEDULES.
Follow-Up Examinations
Follow-up care (necessary to ensure continued successful contact [CONTACT_13279]) should include routine periodic progress examinations, management of speciﬁ  c problems, if any, and a review with the patient of the wear schedule, daily disposable modality, and proper lens handling procedures. 
CR-6530, v 1.0  
 
Page 85 of 137JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
Recommended Follow-up Examination Schedule (complications 
and speciﬁ  c problems should be managed on an individual patient 
basis):
1. One week from the initial lens dispensing to patient
2. One month post-dispensing
3. Every three to six months thereafter 
NOTE: Preferably, at the follow-up visits, lenses should be worn for at least 
six hours.
Recommended Procedures for Follow-up Visits:
1. Solicit and record patient’s symptoms, if any.
2. Measure visual acuity monocularly and binocularly at distance and 
near with the contact [CONTACT_13276].
3. Perform an over-refraction at distance and near to check for residual 
refractive error.
4. With the biomicroscope, judge the lens ﬁ  tting characteristics (as 
described in the GENERAL FITTING GUIDELINES) and evaluate 
the lens surface for deposits and damage.
5. Following lens removal, examine the cornea and conjunctiva with 
the biomicroscope and ﬂ  uorescein (unless contraindicated).
• The presence of vertical corneal striae in the posterior central 
cornea and/or corneal neovascularization is indicative of 
excessive corneal edema.
• The presence of corneal staining and/or limbal-conjunctival 
hyperemia can be indicative of an unclean lens, a reaction to solution preservatives, excessive lens wear and/or a poorly ﬁ  tting lens.
• Papi[INVESTIGATOR_35465]/or damaged lens.
6. Periodically perform keratometry and spectacle refractions. The 
values should be recorded and compared to the baseline meas-
urements.
If any observations are abnormal, use professional judgment to 
alleviate the problem and restore the eye to optimal conditions. If

Basic Instructions
• Always wash, rinse, and dry hands before handling contact [CONTACT_13276].
• Do not use saliva or anything other than the recommended solutions 
for lubricating or rewetting lenses. Do not put lenses in the mouth.
• Eye Care Professionals may recommend a lubricating/rewetting solution which can be used to wet (lubricate) lenses while they are being worn to make them more comfortable. 
Care for a Sticking (Non-Moving) Lens
If the lens sticks (stops moving), the patient should be instructed to apply 
a few drops of the recommended lubricating or rewetting solution directly to the eye and wait until the lens begins to move freely on the eye before removing it. If non-movement of the lens continues after a few minutes, the patient should immediately consult the Eye Care Professional.
EMERGENCIES
The patient should be informed that if chemicals of any kind (household products, gardening solutions, laboratory chemicals, etc.) are splashed into the eyes, the patient should: FLUSH EYES IMMEDIATELY WITH TAP WATER AND IMMEDIATELY CONTACT [CONTACT_35581] A HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_35466].

1 Introduction, Background Information and Scientific Rationale
1.1 Background Information and Relevant Literature
Utilization of total hip and knee arthroplasty (THA and TKA, respectively) has increased over the last decade 
and is expected to continue to rise as the population of the [LOCATION_002] ages. By 2030, over 2 million total 
joint arthroplasty (TJA) procedures are anticipated to be performed annually1.With increasing numbers and 
to maintain excellent patient outcomes after total joint arthroplasty, it has become important to optimize 
every aspect of patient recovery. Sleep disturbance is a routinely encountered problem during the 
perioperative period in adults undergoing elective surgery2. Sleep in postoperative patients is negatively 
influenced by [CONTACT_713032]3, 4and the presence of postoperative pain5. Reciprocally, poor sleep 
also portends poor copi[INVESTIGATOR_713019]-operative pain6, 7. Nighttime awakenings may be 
frequent, and require the use of additional pain medication to go back to sleep. 
1.2 Name [CONTACT_58724] 
1.2.1 Preclinical Data
Melatonin or 5 methoxy-N-acetyltryptamine was discovered and isolated from bovine pi[INVESTIGATOR_713020] [ZIP_CODE]. 
A naturally occurring hormone, melatonin is synthesized by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_713021]9. 
Melatonin works through activation of ML1 and ML2 receptors in target cells through a G-protein coupled 
receptor – adenyl cyclase pathways8, 10. The molecule is important in regulation of human circadian rhythms 
such as the sleep-wake rhythm, neuroendocrine rhythms or body temperature cycles through its action on 
various target cells throughout the body11. Consumption of melatonin, either orally or intravenously, induces 
fatigue, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_89996] a diminution of sleep latency in humans12. Given its physiologic effects, melatonin 
is an agent of great interest in perioperative patients experiencing sleep disturbance.  
 
1.2.[ADDRESS_970397] demonstrated preoperative administration of melatonin 
has been associated anxiolytic and analgesic effects in addition to increased potency of sleep/wake 
circadian rhythms in patients undergoing gynecologic procedures14, 15. Borazan et al demonstrated 
improved subjective sleep quality after prostate surgery after perioperative administration of melatonin16. A 
systematic review of randomized trials with melatonin has demonstrated efficacy in reducing perioperative 
anxiety and some positive effects on perioperative pain17. 
1.3 Rationale 
Sleep disruption following elective, primary total joint arthroplasty is very common. The cause is likely 
multifactorial, resulting from anxiety, anesthesia, the patient’s recovery environment, and pain. Overall 
tiredness can lead to decreased energy, restlessness, less ambulation, and slow progress with physical 
therapy and recovery. Melatonin is an inexpensive, over the counter dietary supplement with an established 
safety profile that has been used to help create a more restful sleep cycle. There is no consensus as to the 
utility, dose, duration, or timing of melatonin administration in the period before and after elective hip and 
knee arthroplasty to improve sleep quality. This study design is supported by [CONTACT_713033] 2 weeks of surgery due to a disrupted sleep wake cycle and pain. 5mg is a safe and 
effective starting dose for any sleep disturbance.20 Further, inconsistent methods of assessing patients’ 
sleep and pain postoperatively has made the study of sleep quality difficult.

1.4 Potential Risks & Benefits
1.4.[ADDRESS_970398] indicated that 
even long-term exogenous melatonin only mild adverse effects such as dizziness and headaches 
comparable to placebo17. 
1.4.2 Known Potential Benefits 
In addition to its importance in in regulation of human circadian rhythms such as the sleep-wake rhythm, 
neuroendocrine rhythms or body temperature cycles; perioperative melatonin is also known to reduce the 
incidence of delirium in older patients19.  
[ADDRESS_970399] of melatonin use on the 
quality of sleep, including total hours of sleep and nighttime awakenings in patients undergoing elective 
primary total hip and knee arthroplasty. 
Secondary Objectives are to monitor and investigate hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577], and narcotic consumption 
patterns, scores in patients who take melatonin as a sleep aid for 14 days after surgery. 
3 Study Design and Endpoints 
3.1 Description of Study Design
This will be a single-center randomized double blind placebo control clinical trial. In the cohort of patients 
undergoing primary elective total hip and the cohort of patients undergoing primary elective knee 
arthroplasty, participants are recruited from those who are willing to consent and participate in the study, 
and will be randomly 1:1 divided into intervention group and placebo group.  
Knee cohort: 
 Intervention group will receive a 5mg Melatonin prescription for 14 days 
 Control group will receive a placebo pi[INVESTIGATOR_6522] 14 days 
Hip cohort: 
 Intervention group will receive a 5mg Melatonin prescription for [ADDRESS_970400] meet all of the following criteria: 
Study number: i20-[ZIP_CODE] Page 4
Version: December 7, [ADDRESS_970401] been medically cleared and scheduled for surgery 
4.2 Exclusion Criteria
An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study:
 Non-elective conversion arthroplasty 
 Consistent melatonin use within 1 month of surgery 
 Bilateral total joint arthroplasty 
 Contraindications to use of melatonin (diabetes, calcium channel blocker use, depression) 
 Conditions and medications likely to confound results due to impact on subjective and/or objective 
sleep quality (insomnia, drug/alcohol abuse, and use of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], and prescription sleep 
aids) 
 Conditions likely to impair capacity to adhere to protocol (mental impairment, psychiatric disorders 
other than anxiety/depression) 
4.[ADDRESS_970402]. An investigator 
may terminate participation in the study if: 
 Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation 
occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the 
participant 
4.6.[ADDRESS_970403] to follow-up they will be contact[CONTACT_14901]-calls and certified letters, which will be tracked. There is no safety risk predicted from abrupt 
termination. Any patients who withdraw or discontinue early will be replaced via recruitment of new 
patients. As LOH is a high-volume arthroplasty center performing thousands of primary TJA procedures 
there is not expected to be an issue in recruiting new subjects as approximately 10-50% of patients are 
projected to be affected by [CONTACT_87734] (previously cited data). 
 
4.7 Premature Termination or Suspension of Study 
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable 
cause. Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be provided 
Study number: i20-[ZIP_CODE] Page 5
Version: December 7, 2021   
by [CONTACT_112386]. If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_33894](s) for the termination or suspension. 
Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to: 
 Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants 
 Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements 
 Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable 
 
Study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, data quality are addressed and 
satisfy the IRB.

If a patient wishes to terminate early no further procedures or interventions will be performed and the patient 
will be allowed to continue their pre- or post-operative care as per standard of care  
6.2.[ADDRESS_970408] of care will be 
recorded in their EMR.  
7.1.1 Definition of Adverse Events (AE) 
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study. Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events. 
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality: 
 results in study withdrawal 
 is associated with a serious adverse event 
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms 
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests 
 is considered by [CONTACT_713038]: i20-[ZIP_CODE] Page 9
Version: December 7, 2021   
7.1.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAE)
Serious Adverse Event 
Adverse events are classified as serious or non-serious. A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening 
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_226718] 
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 an important medical event 
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major 
clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes noted above. For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result 
in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious 
adverse events .  
7.1.3 Definition of Unanticipated Problems (UP) 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others 
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency (i.e. not described in study-related documents such 
as the IRB-approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc) 
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research (i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156]) 
 Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm). 
7.2 Classification of an Adverse Event 
7.2.1 Severity of Event 
For AEs not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will be used to 
describe severity. 
 Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily 
activities. 
 Moderate  – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning. 
 Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life-threatening or incapacitating. 
7.2.2 Relationship to Study Agent 
The clinician’s assessment of an AE's relationship to study agent (drug, biologic, device) is part of the 
documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. If there 
is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported. All AEs must 
Study number: i20-[ZIP_CODE] Page 10
Version: December 7, [ADDRESS_970409]. To help assess, the following guidelines are used. 
 Related – The AE is known to occur with the study agent, there is a reasonable possibility that the 
study agent caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study agent and event. 
Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
study agent and the AE. 
 Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study agent 
caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study agent and event onset, or 
an alternate etiology has been established. 
 
7.2.3 Expectedness 
The principal investigator, Joshua Rozell, MD will be responsible for determining whether an AE is 
expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the 
event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study agent. 
 
7.3 Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow-Up 
The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and 
interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor. All AEs 
including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the 
appropriate RF. Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s 
assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_12213] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on 
study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate 
resolution. 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any time 
during the study, it will be recorded as an AE. UPs will be recorded in the data collection system 
throughout the study. 
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of 
onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_46183] 7 (for non-serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation. At 
each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit. Events 
will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the 
subject is lost to follow-up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained. At the last scheduled visit, the 
investigator should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the 
subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.  
7.3.1 Adverse Event Reporting 
Any AE’s encountered during the study will be identified by [CONTACT_713039]. After investigation by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_713027], within 1 week, to the IRB, as indicated  
 
Study number: i20-[ZIP_CODE] Page 11
Version: December 7, 2021   
7.3.2 Serious Adverse Event Reporting
Any SAE’s encountered during the study will be identified by [CONTACT_713040]. They will then be reported as quickly as possible, within 3 days, to the IRB  
7.3.3 Unanticipated Problem Reporting
Incidents or events that meet the OHRP criteria for UPs require the creation and completion of an UP 
report form. It is the site investigator’s responsibility to report UPs to their IRB. The UP report will include 
the following information: 
 Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project number; 
 A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome; 
 An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an UP; 
 A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the UP. 
 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following timeline: 
 
 UPs that are SAEs will be reported to the IRB and to [CONTACT_713042]/lead PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] [ADDRESS_970410]. Rozell/lead PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] 1 week of the investigator 
becoming aware of the problem. 
 All UPs should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_17347]’s 
written reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or designee), and OHRP within 1 week 
of the IR’s receipt of the report of the problem from the investigator. 
 
7.3.4 Reporting of Pregnancy 
No pregnant patients will be included in the study. Any patient who becomes pregnant during the study 
will be removed from the study group.  
7.4 Reporting Procedures – Notifying [CONTACT_713043] study clinician will complete a SAE Form within the following timelines: 
 All deaths and immediately life-threatening events, whether related or unrelated, will be recorded 
on the SAE Form and submitted to [CONTACT_713042] within [ADDRESS_970411] the understanding of the event.  
Study number: i20-[ZIP_CODE] Page 12
Version: December 7, [ADDRESS_970412] of the 
trial is in compliance with the currently approved protocol/amendment(s), with GCP, and with applicable 
regulatory requirement(s). 
 
 Monitoring for this study will be performed by [CONTACT_978]. 
 Monitoring will be on sight with frequent random checks of data. At conclusion of the study another 
independent member of the LOH arthroplasty research team not affiliated with the study will check 
all available data to ensure its validity 
 
Statistical Considerations 
8.1 Statistical Hypotheses 
 Primary endpoint: The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the melatonin and 
placebo group in the mean ESS score from days 1-14 postoperatively. The alternative hypothesis 
is that there is a difference between the melatonin and placebo group in the mean ESS score during 
any of these time points 
 
 Secondary endpoints:  
o Hours of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_713028] 1-14 for overnight sleep: The null hypothesis 
is that there is no difference between the melatonin and placebo group in the mean hours of 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_713029]. The alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference between 
the melatonin and placebo group in the mean hours of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_713029]. Nighttime 
awakenings are those that require an additional dose of pain medication to go back to sleep.  
o Other secondary endpoints to be listed 
 
8.2 Sample Size and Power 
The overall study sample size is based on the primary endpoint of ESS measured at days 1-14. The 
MCID of the ESS is 2.65 and the SD is 5.3 based on previous literature21. We assume the MCID and ESS 
values are the same for both THA and TKA cohorts. 64 patients are needed in the control and 
intervention groups separately for a two-sided alpha = 0.05, 80% powered study based on an ANOVA for 
the comparison of the ESS at days 1-14 between the control and intervention group, which provides us a 
total of 128 patients for THA cohort and TKA cohort separately.  
 
8.3 Analysis Datasets 
All patients will be included in the efficacy analyses as randomized (intent-to-treat population). THA cohort 
and TKA cohort will be analyzed separately throughout.  
Study number: i20-[ZIP_CODE] Page 13
Version: December 7, [ADDRESS_970413] to ensure the robustness of the results. 
 
8.4.2 Analysis of the Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
The secondary endpoints include number of total hours of sleep, number of nighttime awakenings, and 
narcotic consumption.  
 
 
8.4.3 Safety Analyses 
AE’s will be recorded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, counted once per 
individual occurrence, presented in terms of its severity and relationship to AE, and its start date, stop 
date, severity, relationship, outcome and duration will be reported. All AE’s will be ascertained via PI 
[CONTACT_377972].  
8.4.[ADDRESS_970414] for categorical 
variables. All tests will be two-sided with a significance level at 0.05.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy Review 
Planned interim analyses of the primary endpoint will not be performed.  
8.4.6 Additional Sub-Group Analyses 
Subgroup analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints will be done on the subgroups of THA vs TKA 
with ANOVA, and all other categorical variables will be analyzed using Fisher’s Exact Test. All tests will be 
two-sided with a significance level of 0.05.

8.5 Measures to Minimize Bias
8.5.1 Enrollment/Randomization/Masking Procedures
Research assistants not involved in the study protocol will be responsible for maintaining the patient 
database and randomization algorithm. Treatment will begin on postoperative day zero. The control 
groups will receive 14 placebo pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]. The treatment group will receive 14 pi[INVESTIGATOR_156930] 5mg melatonin. Patients 
will begin taking a daily pi[INVESTIGATOR_6522] 14 days postoperatively. They will continue to receive their selected 
treatment during their inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. 
 
Block randomization will be done through RedCap to ensure equal distribution of intervention vs control 
subjects. The block size will be undisclosed. There will be no stratification based on age, gender, or 
surgery type.

medico-technical departments involved in the clinical trial. It is acceptable to use CRFs as source 
documents. If this is the case, it should be stated in this section what data will be collected on CRFs and 
what data will be collected from other sources. 
 
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study. All data 
requested on the CRF must be recorded. All missing data must be explained. If a space on the CRF is left 
blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D”. If the item is not 
applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”. All entries should be printed legibly in black ink. If any entry 
error has been made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line through the incorrect entry and 
enter the correct data above it. All such changes must be initialed and dated. DO NOT ERASE OR 
WHITE OUT ERRORS. For clarification of illegible or uncertain entries, print the clarification above the 
item, then initial and date it. 
 
 
Access to study records will be limited to IRB-approved members of the study team. The investigator will 
permit study-related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1201]/EC, the sponsor, government 
regulatory bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups of all study related 
documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.). 
The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study-related facilities (e.g. 
pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.). 
 
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by [CONTACT_28832].

10 Quality Assurance and Quality Control
QC procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system and data QC checks that will be 
run on the database will be generated. Any missing data or data anomalies will be communicated to the 
site(s) for clarification/resolution. 
Following written SOPs, the monitors will verify that the clinical trial is conducted and data are generated, 
documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the protocol, GCP, and the applicable regulatory 
requirements (e.g., Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)). 
The investigational site will provide direct access to all trial related sites, source data/documents, and 
reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by [CONTACT_456], and inspection by [CONTACT_90471]. 
11 Ethics/Protection of Human Subjects 
11.[ADDRESS_970415] 
The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformity with Regulations for the 
Protection of Human Subjects of Research codified in 45 CFR Part 46, 21 CFR Part 50, 21 CFR Part 56, 
and/or the ICH E6. 
 
11.[ADDRESS_970416] 
The protocol, informed consent form(s), recruitment materials, and all participant materials will be 
submitted to the IRB for review and approval. Approval of both the protocol and the consent form must be 
obtained before any participant is enrolled. Any amendment to the protocol will require review and 
approval by [CONTACT_3484]. All changes to the consent form 
will be IRB approved; a determination will be made regarding whether previously consented participants 
need to be re-consented. 
 
11.3 Informed Consent Process
11.3.1 Consent and Other Informational Documents Provided to Participants
Consent forms describing in detail the study agent, study procedures, and risks are given to the 
participant and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to starting 
intervention/administering study product. The following consent materials are submitted with this protocol: 
informed consent for participation 
11.3.2 Consent Procedures and Documentation 
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the study 
and continues throughout the individual’s study participation. Extensive discussion of risks and possible 
benefits of participation will be provided to the participants and their families. Consent forms will be IRB-
approved and the participant will be asked to read and review the document.  
The informed consent process will take place at a pre-surgery clinic visit prior to the day of surgery or in 
the holding area on the day of surgery. If consenting occurs on the day of surgery, the study team will 
ensure that efforts are made so patients have enough time to make an informed decision to enroll in the 
study. A study coordinator, not associated with the surgery, will be the one to introduce the study to the 
patient in the holding area and patients will be given the opportunity to enroll in the study after the surgery 
is complete. 
Study number: i20-[ZIP_CODE] Page 16
Version: December 7, 2021   
The Informed Consent Form (ICF) will be thoroughly explained in a private room with any and all 
questions addressed prior to signing the ICF. In the event additional time to make an inform decision is 
required, patient(s)/subject(s) will be able to take a copy of the ICF home for further review and 
discussion with their friends and family. During the course of the consenting process, subjects will interact 
with all study personnel. The participant will sign the informed consent document prior to any procedures 
being done specifically for the study. The participants may withdraw consent at any time throughout the 
course of the trial. A copy of the signed informed consent document will be given to the participants for 
their records. The rights and welfare of the participants will be protected by [CONTACT_142321]. 
 
A copy of the signed informed consent document will be stored in the subject’s research record. The 
consent process, including the name [CONTACT_21811], will be thoroughly documented in 
the subject’s research record. Any alteration to the standard consent process (e.g. use of a translator, 
consent document presented orally, etc.) and the justification for such alteration will likewise be 
documented.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_970417] of 1996 (HIPAA). Those regulations require a 
signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study 
 Who will have access to that information and why 
 Who will use or disclose that information  
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], 
retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization. For 
subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain 
permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study 
period. 
 
 
Participant confidentiality is strictly held in trust by [CONTACT_3486], their staff, and the 
sponsor(s) and their agents. This confidentiality is extended to cover testing of biological samples and 
genetic tests in addition to the clinical information relating to participants. Therefore, the study protocol, 
documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in strict confidence. No information 
concerning the study or the data will be released to any unauthorized third party without prior written 
approval of the sponsor. 
 
The study monitor, other authorized representatives of the sponsor, representatives of the IRB or 
pharmaceutical company supplying study product may inspect all documents and records required to be 
maintained by [CONTACT_093], including but not limited to, medical records (office, clinic, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) and 
pharmacy records for the participants in this study. The clinical study site will permit access to such 
records. 
 
The study participant’s contact [CONTACT_21225]. At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure location for as 
long a period as dictated by [CONTACT_46202]. 
 
Study participant research data, which is for purposes of statistical analysis and scientific reporting, will 
be transmitted to and stored at NYU Langone Medical Center. This will not include the participant’s 
contact [CONTACT_1290]. Rather, individual participants and their research data will be identified

12.1 Data Collection and Management Responsibilities 
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the site PI. 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the 
data reported. 
All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of 
data. Black ink is required to ensure clarity of reproduced copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. When making changes or corrections, 
cross out the original entry with a single line, and initial and date the change. DO NOT ERASE, 
OVERWRITE, OR USE CORRECTION FLUID OR TAPE ON THE ORIGINAL. 
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_58625] (eCRF) will be provided for use as source documents and maintained for 
recording data for each participant enrolled in the study. Data reported in the eCRF derived from source 
documents should be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies should be explained 
and captured in a progress note and maintained in the participant’s official electronic study record. 
Clinical data (including AEs, concomitant medications, and expected adverse reactions data) and clinical 
laboratory data will be entered into a RedCap database, a encrypted, HIPAA-compliant data capture 
system managed by [CONTACT_553763]. The data system includes password protection and internal quality checks, 
such as automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate. 
Clinical data will be entered directly from the source documents. Each site will have access to its 
identifiable data. Only de-identified data will be passed between institutions. 
 
12.2 Study Records Retention 
Study documents will be retained for the longer of 3 years after close-out, 5 years after final 
reporting/publication. 
12.3 Protocol Deviations
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, GCP, or Manual of Procedures 
(MOP) requirements. The noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant, the investigator, or 
the study site staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by [CONTACT_90478]. 
 
These practices are consistent with ICH E6: 
 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3 
 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, section 5.1.1 
 5.20 Noncompliance, sections 5.20.1, and 5.20.2. 
 
It is the responsibility of the site PI/study staff to use continuous vigilance to identify and report deviations 
within 7 working days of identification of the protocol deviation, or within 7 working days of the scheduled 
protocol-required activity. 
Study number: i20-[ZIP_CODE] Page 18
Version: December 7, [ADDRESS_970419] be reported to the local IRB per their guidelines. The site PI/study staff is 
responsible for knowing and adhering to their IRB requirements. Further details about the handling of 
protocol deviations will be included in the MOP. 
12.4 Publication and Data Sharing Policy 
The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) member journals have adopted a clinical 
trials registration policy as a condition for publication. The ICMJE defines a clinical trial as any research 
project that prospectively assigns human subjects to intervention or concurrent comparison or control 
groups to study the cause-and-effect relationship between a medical intervention and a health outcome. 
Medical interventions include drugs, surgical procedures, devices, behavioral treatments, process-of-care 
changes, and the like. Health outcomes include any biomedical or health-related measures obtained in 
patients or participants, including pharmacokinetic measures and adverse events. The ICMJE policy, and 
the Section [ADDRESS_970420] of 2007, requires that all clinical 
trials be registered in a public trials registry such as ClinicalTrials.gov, which is sponsored by [CONTACT_118702]. Other biomedical journals are considering adopting similar policies. For interventional 
clinical trials performed under NIH IC grants and cooperative agreements, it is the grantee’s responsibility 
to register the trial in an acceptable registry, so the research results may be considered for publication in 
ICMJE member journals. The ICMJE does not review specific studies to determine whether registration is 
necessary; instead, the committee recommends that researchers who have questions about the need to 
register err on the side of registration or consult the editorial office of the journal in which they wish to 
publish.

greater than the minimum allowable by [CONTACT_1385], etc.) must have the conflict reviewed by [CONTACT_46205] (CIMU) with a Committee-sanctioned conflict management 
plan that has been reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_28833]. All 
NYULMC investigators will follow the applicable conflict of interest policies.

ABSTRACT 
Anthracyclines are an essential element for the treatment of AML in children. Unfortunately, the use of 
anthracyclines is limited by [CONTACT_431443], a critical problem 
for some children who are AML survivors. Children’s Oncology Group (COG) clinical trials for newly 
diagnosed AML currently deliver approximately 450 mg/m2 cumulative daunorubicin equivalents for those 
who receive 4 courses of chemotherapy alone, or approximately 300 mg/m2 to those who receive [ADDRESS_545722] be 
identified. 
 
Liposomal delivery systems for anthracyclines are a promising strategy to mitigate cardiotoxicity while 
maintaining efficacy. DaunoXome (DNX), a liposomal anthracycline that has been studied extensively in 
adults and children, has shown superior re-induction rates in adults and children with AML when added to 
a fludarabine/cytarabine/G-CSF backbone. Unfortunately, there is presently not a plan to further develop 
DNX in the [LOCATION_002]. 
 
This clinical trial proposes to study CPX-351, a novel liposomal preparation of a fixed 5:1 ratio of 
cytarabine/daunorubicin. Preclinical studies and pharmacokinetics performed in adult trials have 
demonstrated that CPX-351 provides elevated and prolonged encapsulated drug concentrations when 
compared to DNX, and orders of magnitude higher than free drug. Phase 1 trials in adults with AML 
demonstrated safety and tolerability at 100 Units/m2/dose given on Days 1, 3, 5. In addition, adult phase [ADDRESS_545723] regimens in 
newly diagnosed and relapsed AML, particularly those with adverse prognostic factors.   
 
AAML1421 is a Phase 1/[ADDRESS_545724] relapse. The primary objectives 
of this study will be to determine the recommended Phase 2 Dose (RPD2) of CPX-351 in children with 
AML and to estimate the response rate (CR+CRp) by [CONTACT_431444] 2 cycles 
(Cycle 1 = CPX-351 followed by [CONTACT_51199] 2 consisting of FLAG). The phase 1 portion of the study has been 
completed as of 12/12/2016 and dose level #1 (135 Units/m2/dose) was found to be the recommended phase 
2 dose.   This clinical trial is a critically important step in developi[INVESTIGATOR_431397].

2.0 BACKGROUND 
2.1 Introduction/Rationale for Development 
Anthracyclines are essential in the treatment of children with AML. However, it is clear 
that anthracycline-associated cardiotoxicity represents the major adverse sequela for 
survivors of childhood AML. CPX-[ADDRESS_545726] equivalent response rates to 
both 7+3 (cytarabine 100 mg/m2/dose, Days 1-7; daunorubicin 60 mg/m2/dose, Days 1, 3, 
5) and other anthracycline-containing re-induction regimens in adults with AML. For 
adults with high-risk features, CPX-351 is statistically superior in terms of response rate 
and 1-year overall survival (OS). In children with AML, new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_431398]. We propose to study CPX-[ADDRESS_545727] relapse is poor, 
but historical data consistently demonstrates improved CR rates with anthracycline-
containing re-induction regimens.1,2 The International BFM (i-BFM) group reported in 
children with AML in first relapse, that those who received FLAG plus the liposomal

Version Date: 02/22/2018   Page 10 
anthracycline DaunoXome (DNX) had superior CR rates compared to those who received 
FLAG alone. As a result, administration of DNX is standard for re-induction therapy in 
relapsed disease among the European consortia and DNX is currently being included in 
their clinical trials for children with de novo AML (Dirk Reinhardt, personal 
communication). Recent COG studies for relapsed AML have utilized anthracyclines such 
as idarubicin (AAML06P1, AAML07P1) resulting in a cumulative anthracycline exposure 
of approximately 600 mg/m2 daunorubicin equivalents in combination with either high- or 
standard dosing cytarabine. The OS of patients who experienced bone marrow relapse 
following treatment on COG study AAML0531 revealed that those who relapsed within 
one year had a dismal prognosis, whether they received hematopoietic stem cell transplant 
(HSCT) or not (3 y ear OS 21% ± 17% with HSCT; 27% ±7% without HSCT p=0.524) . 
Although those with a first complete response (CR1) > 1 year demonstrate better OS, they 
still fare poorly overall (3 y ear OS 51% ± 13% without HSCT; 2 y ear OS of 20% ± 31% 
with HSCT p=0.008; T. Alonzo, personal communication).  
 
New therapi[INVESTIGATOR_431399]. Even with such aggressive 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], OS is poor. CPX-[ADDRESS_545728] common 
anthracyclines used for the treatment of de novo pediatric AML in the U.S. are 
daunorubicin and mitoxantrone. Idarubicin is an effective anthracycline but is 
more commonly used in the relapsed setting. Doxorubicin is more commonly used 
in acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapy and in patients with solid tumors. There 
is evidence that daunorubicin demonstrates 20-30% less cardiac toxicity per unit 
dose compared with doxorubicin.5,6, and cumulative anthracycline calculations 
should be made accordingly. Higher cumulative doses with conventional 
preparations result in significant long term toxicity. Currently, COG utilizes 
Medical Research Council (MRC)-based chemotherapy, which has improved 
outcomes for children with AML with a 56% and 66% event free survival (EFS) 
and OS, respectively.7-9 Children with newly diagnosed AML enrolled on COG 
trials (AAML0531, AAML1031) who do not receive HSCT receive a cumulative 
anthracycline dose of approximately 444 mg/m2 (assuming a 1:3 conversion of 
mitoxantrone to daunorubicin equivalent), while those assigned to HSCT on 
AAML1031 (high risk cytogenetic/molecular abnormalities, + MRD) receive 
294 mg/m2. Randomized studies in adults have demonstrated that higher doses of 
anthracyclines lead to superior survival.3,[ADDRESS_545729], adult cooperative groups in the 
[LOCATION_002] (SWOG, MDACC) are increasing cumulative anthracycline doses 
for adolescent/young adult high-risk AML patients in recognition that dose-
intensification improves survival.

Version Date: 02/22/[ADDRESS_545730] among all pediatric cancers.14-16 The literature clearly 
demonstrates that late cardiac effects, such as congestive heart failure, increases 
with higher cumulative doses of anthracyclines.10 One analysis of anthracycline-
induced clinical heart failure (A-CHF) in a cohort of 607 children who had been 
treated with anthracyclines concluded that up to 5% of patients will develop A-
CHF 15 years after treatment, and patients treated with cumulative doses of more 
than 300 mg/m2 are at highest risk. Those receiving cumulative anthracycline 
doses of 600 mg/m2 had a 17.8% risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] A-CHF (95% CI, 5.5% to 
30.1%).[ADDRESS_545731] included alternative derivatives of anthracyclines (mitoxantrone, 
idarubicin) and the use of pre-therapy cardioprotective agents such as dexrazoxane 
(DRZ).15,[ADDRESS_545732] been published that demonstrate evidence of decreased 
cardiotoxicity with liposomal anthracyclines.29,30 DNX is a liposomal 
anthracycline that has been studied extensively in adults and children with newly 
diagnosed and relapsed acute leukemia.2,27,28,31-33 The i-BFM group recently 
published their results of a randomized trial comparing FLAG and FLAG + DNX 
in children with relapsed AML. In this study, DNX was given at a dose of 
60 mg/m2/day on Days 1, 3, and 5 in combination with fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day 
x 5 days followed by [CONTACT_431446] 2000 mg/m2/day x 5 days. There were no

statistically significant differences in acute toxicities reported on the 2 arms. Of 
note, Grade 3 to 4 skin toxicity was reported in 4% of patients with FLAG/DNX 
compared with 1% of those treated with FLAG and acute cardiotoxicity ≥ Grade 
3/4 was reported in a total of 5 patients with FLAG/DNX and 1 patient treated with 
FLAG. The study did not report cumulative anthracycline dose prior to enrollment. 
Notably, all cardiotoxicities occurred in the setting of infection. Overall, the CR 
rate (ANC > 1000, platelets > 50,000) after 2 courses was 69% with F LAG/DNX, 
and 59% with FLAG (p=0.07).[ADDRESS_545733] recently, DNX was compared to idarubicin 
during induction for children with newly diagnosed AML. In that study, DNX had 
antileukemic activity comparable to idarubicin, demonstrated superior EFS in 
patients with t(8;21), and caused less treatment related toxicity.33 The potential 
advantages of liposomal preparations include: prolonged time in the circulation34 
due to protection of the drug from enzymatic inactivation, altered biodistribution 
of the liposome formulation and potential sparing of normal tissue with a resultant 
reduction in toxicity;35 circumvention of drug efflux transporters responsible for 
drug resistance.36,37 Data presented below suggests that CPX-351 has marked 
pharmacokinetic advantages when compared to DNX. More importantly, there is 
no plan to further develop DNX in the [LOCATION_002], and there are no data on the 
long term benefit of liposomal anthracyclines in children with AML. Developi[INVESTIGATOR_431400]-351 in children with AML is an important step in studying the role of 
liposomal anthracyclines as a cardioprotectant strategy.   
 
2.2 Preclinical Studies and Pharmacokinetics 
CPX-351 is a liposomal formulation of a fixed combination of cytarabine and daunorubicin 
contained within the liposome at a 5:[ADDRESS_545734] demonstrated the importance 
of ratio-dependent synergy and antagonism for combinations of cytarabine and 
daunorubicin. Specifically, chemotherapy combinations in vitro  can be synergistic, 
additive, or antagonistic depending on the molar ratio between the two agents.38 
Maintaining a fixed ratio is difficult when using combinations of free drugs given the 
different distribution, metabolism, and elimination properties of the individual drugs. 
Controlling the exposure of drug ratios using liposomal preparations can lead to prolonged 
maintenance of the optimal drug ratio and result in improved efficacy in vivo . In vivo 
delivery of fixed cytarabine:daunorubicin ratios (5:1 molar ratio) shown to be synergistic 
in cell culture results in an increase in antitumor activity in tumor-bearing mice. In 
preclinical models, CPX-351 provided elevated and prolonged drug concentrations that 
were orders of magnitude higher than free drug and also higher daunorubicin 
concentrations compared to Daunoxome (DNX) based on literature reports of the latter. 
These pharmacokinetic advantages have held true in clinical studies of CPX-351 as well. 
When CPX-351 was given Days 1, 3, and 5 in the adult phase 1 study, the clearance of 
cytarabine and daunorubicin was less than 120 mL/h/m2 across all dose levels. This is 
markedly less than the clearance of unencapsulated daunorubicin (38,600 mL/h/m2) and 
cytarabine (134,000 mL/h/m2).39,40 This results in striking differences in plasma 
elimination half-life when comparing CPX-351 with free drug or with DNX. For example, 
the plasma elimination half-life of the daunorubicin component of CPX-351 is 
approximately 24 hours compared to 5-8 hours in DNX. At 48 hours, the plasma 
concentration of the daunorubicin component of CPX-351 is about 15 times greater than 
that of DNX. The plasma half-life of the cytarabine component in CPX-351 at the adult 
MTD is approximately 42.5 hours, significantly longer than unencapsulated cytarabine. Of 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AAML1421  
Version Date: 02/22/[ADDRESS_545735] no distribution phase of CPX-351 suggesting that virtually all 
detectable CPX-351 in the plasma exists in the encapsulated form. In addition, these 
concentrations are maintained in the circulation at the synergistic 5:[ADDRESS_545736] phase 1 study included 48 adult patients with relapsed/refractory leukemia 
(43 patients with AML) who received CPX-351 on Days 1, 3, and 5 of treatment. 
Multiple dose levels between 3 units/m2/dose and 134 units/m2/dose were tested. 
Pancytopenia was universal and was associated with fever, infection, and bleeding 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was seen at the 134 units/m2/dose level and 
consisted of congestive heart failure (CHF; 1 patient), hypertensive crisis (1 
patient), and persistent cytopenias beyond 56 days (1 patient). The patient with 
CHF had previously received 365 mg/m2 cumulative anthracycline dose and 
sustained cardiac dysfunction during an epi[INVESTIGATOR_431401] 52% to 29% but subsequently increased to 47% 
after resolution of the septic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Responses were observed in 10 of 43 (21%) 
AML patients treated with CPX-351 including 9 CRs and 1 CRp. PK data from 13 
patients showed a median elimination half-life of 31.1 hours for cytarabine and 
21.9 hours for daunorubicin with the 5:[ADDRESS_545737] provided additional encouraging data regarding 
the tolerability and response rate to CPX-351.  
 
2.3.2 Phase 2 Trials of CPX-351 in Adults 
Trial 204 involving elderly patients with de novo  AML consisted of a 2:[ADDRESS_545738] 7+3 treatment and up to 2 courses of induction 
and 2 courses of consolidation therapy with CPX-351 given on Days 1, 3, 5 . The 
CR + CRi (complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery) rate was 
67% (N=56) for the patients treated with CPX-351 and 51% (N=21) for those 
treated with 7+3 (P=0.07). Ten patients unresponsive to 1 or 2 courses of 7+3 
induction treatment were crossed over CPX-351 treatment. Of those, 4 achieved 
CR and survived > 12 months. Among those on study with an antecedent 
hematologic disorder and high-risk features, CPX-351 demonstrated significant 
superiority over 7+3 therapy [survival HR=0.40 (p=0.01), EFS HR=0.51, 
(p=0.04), and CR + CRi rate (57.6% vs. 31.6%), p=0.013].[ADDRESS_545739] 
relapse. Patients were randomized 2:[ADDRESS_545740] often MEC 
(mitoxantrone/etoposide/cytarabine). Those with prior HSCT were eligible 
(22 patients in CPX-351 arm; 7 patients in the other arm). Overall CR+ CRi rates 
were 49.4% in CPX-351 arm and 40.9% in control arm (p=0.5). The bone marrow 
aplasia rate on Days 14-21 was superior in the CPX-351 arm (76% vs. 51%). For 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AAML1421  
Version Date: 02/22/[ADDRESS_545741]. For these patients, the CR+CRi rate was 39.3% in the CPX-351 arm 
compared to 27.6% (p=0.34) in those who received physician-choice 
chemotherapy. The 60-day mortality was approximately equal between the 2 study 
arms (14.8% vs 15.9%). However, the 1-year OS in unfavorable/poor risk patients 
was significantly better in the CPX-[ADDRESS_545742] ratio of 0.55, p=0.02.46  
 
As a result of the improved outcomes for high-risk patients in these phase 2 studies, 
Celator (A Jazz Pharmaceuticals Company) is sponsoring a multi-institution, 
randomized phase 3 study enrolling adults aged 60 to 75 with newly diagnosed, 
high-risk patients with AML. Results of this study were presented at the American 
Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in June of 2016.  Adults with de novo, high-
risk AML/MDS were randomized 1:[ADDRESS_545743] therapy with 
cytarabine/daunorubicin (7+3) or CPX-351.  CR rates were superior in the CPX-
351 arm 37.3% vs 25.6% in 7+3 arm (p=0.04). Sixty day mortality rates were 
superior in the CPX-351 arm (21.2% 7+3 vs. 13.7% CPX-351). This was largely 
due to decreased incidence of death due to disease in the CPX-351 arm (3.3% 
CPX-351 vs 13.3% in 7+3 arm). The study met its primary objective, with CPX-
351 demonstrating superior OS compared to 7+3 (median survival 9.56 months vs 
5.95 months, HR=0.69, p=0.005).[ADDRESS_545744]-of-care in adult patients is 7+3 (cytarabine plus 
daunorubicin). Given that the adult phase [ADDRESS_545745] not demonstrated a difference between CPX-351 and intensive salvage 
regimens including anthracyclines on cardiac function in patients with prior 
anthracycline exposure. Further study is necessary to fully characterize the 
advantages of liposomal anthracyclines compared to conventional anthracycline 
therapy. 
 
2.4 Pediatric Studies 
2.4.1 Phase 1 Trial of CPX-351 in Children 
Cincinnati Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_431402] a phase 1 study of CPX-351 in 
children and adolescents (≤ 21 years of age). This is a single institution phase 1 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_431403], toxicity and tolerability of a 
single course of CPX-351 in pediatric and young adults with relapsed/refractory 
hematologic malignancies. The trial utilizes a rolling six design, with dose level 1 
(DL1) starting at the adult MTD of 100 units/m2/dose once daily on Days 1, 3, and 
5. Dose level [ADDRESS_545746] the adult MTD to 134 units/m2/dose once daily 
on Days 1, 3, 5. The trial was activated 09/09/13 and has accrued 8 patients 
(personal communication, Mike Absalon, MD, study PI). Of the [ADDRESS_545747] been consistent with intensive chemotherapy reinduction 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AAML1421  
Version Date: 02/22/[ADDRESS_545748] patient was a 2 year-old boy with relapsed AML after therapy per COG 
study AAML0531 (arm A) and persistent leukemia following a retrieval attempt 
with a clofarabine based regimen. He had a history of bilateral leg pain for which 
he received gabapentin 100 mg three times daily and oxycodone 1.5 mg once daily 
average during the week prior to initiation of CPX-351. CPX-351 was initiated at 
135 Units/m2/dose (Days 1, 3, 5). On Day [ADDRESS_545749] abdominal pain, 
leg pain, and a severe headache (holding his head with both hands and crying). 
There was neither trauma nor fall witnessed. He received morphine 0.[ADDRESS_545750] scan and an MRI/MRV of 
the head were obtained and were non-revealing. On Day [ADDRESS_545751] headache that was refractory to scheduled morphine. Morphine continuous 
infusion was initiated. Due to poor pain control, dexamethasone (approximately 6 
mg/m2/day) and fentanyl by [CONTACT_431447] 9. His headache pain 
appeared to be well controlled by [CONTACT_2006] 10, and the dexamethasone was weaned 
over the following 3 days. Fentanyl by [CONTACT_431448] 12 when he 
no longer appeared to be in pain. 
 
A second patient who experienced a DLT was a 16 year-old girl with relapsed 
AML after therapy with COG study AAML1031 (arm A) and persistent leukemia 
following a retrieval attempt with FLAG. She had a history of a generalized pain 
syndrome during chemotherapy and from osteomyelitis isolated to a great toe. Pain 
medications prior to initiation of therapy with CPX-351 were fentanyl patch (25 
mcg/h), gabapentin 300 mg three times daily and hydromorphone 2 mg p.o. prn 
break through pain (usual need 0-1 dose/day). CPX-351 was initiated at 135 
Units/m2/dose (Days 1, 3, 5). On Day 3 of protocol therapy she complained of 
headache with temperature of 38.4. The headache improved with acetaminophen 
and dexamethasone (initiated 4 mg q day). She became afebrile and remained 
afebrile until Day 20. On Day 5 of protocol therapy she complained of severe 
generalized aches stating 10 out of 10 pain that was worse than any she had 
previously experienced. Hydromorphone by [CONTACT_228596] (PCA) 
was initiated with initially poor response and titrated upward over the following [ADDRESS_545752] from the pain syndrome she experienced previously during 
the course.

The plan in the Cincinnati Phase 1 trial of CPX-351 is to follow their dose finding 
guidelines and de-escalate to 100 Units/m2/dose. 
 
Preliminary evaluation of the data from the adult clinical trials demonstrated no 
events of ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_545753] dose (Day 
5) of study drug. Given the importance of testing CPX-351 at a dose level 
comparable to both conventional and liposomal preparations of anthracyclines 
(See Section 2.5 ), this study will incorporate specific supportive care guidelines 
and DLT criteria to address this particular toxicity. In AAML1421, there were no 
pain-related DLTs observed among the 6 patients treated at the 135 mg/m2 dose 
level in the dose-finding phase.   
 
2.4.2 Phase 1 portion of AAML1421 
Six patients were enrolled onto the phase 1 portion of the AAML1421 at DL1 (135 
units/m2/dose on days 1, 3, 5). Each of the patients enrolled has experienced 
expected toxicities commonly seen with intensive reinduction regimens. Four of 6 
patients experienced a documented bacterial infection with isolates identified as E. 
coli, streptococcus mitis, staphylococcus epi[INVESTIGATOR_77353], and coagulase negative 
staphylococcus.  One of 6 patients experienced a DLT of grade 3 decrease of 
ejection fraction.  This patient had a history of decreased cardiac function after 
induction therapy for de novo  AML (baseline echo EF 64%, SF 44%; end of 
induction 1 EF 51%, SF 26%). At that time patient was started on Lisinopril and 
after HSCT had EF of 55%.  At relapse, the patient had a cardiac MRI and EF was 
58%. Echocardiograms performed as a baseline study for AAML1421 
demonstrated EF 58% and SF 32%. The patient was no longer on Lisinopril. After 
reinduction with CPX-351 on AAML 1421, an echocardiogram performed on Day 
38 showed EF of 58% and SF 32%. The start of cycle 2 was delayed due to count 
recovery and echocardiogram 17 days later showed EF of 36% and SF of 25%. 
Repeat echo 3 days later confirmed Grade 3 decrease in EF (40%). The patient was 
otherwise not ill, no evidence of sepsis.  Lisinopril was started and echo 14 days 
later demonstrated resolution with EF 56% and SF 31.5%.  
 
Therefore, 1/6 patients experienced a DLT and per protocol guidelines the Phase 
II dose for this study is 135 units/m2/dose on days 1, 3, 5. There was one death on 
study of a [ADDRESS_545754] in childhood AML. 
Based on available adult and pediatric data, our European colleagues in the MRC, 
i-BFM, and NOPHO are utilizing DNX in their pediatric phase 3 studies (personal 
communication). Given the superior pharmacokinetic properties and favorable

Version Date: 02/22/2018   Page 17 
clinical studies of CPX-351, there is strong rationale to support its development in 
COG.   
 
Results of a randomized Phase III study were presented at the American Society 
of Clinical Oncology meeting in June of 2016.48 Adults with de novo, high-risk 
AML/MDS were randomized 1:[ADDRESS_545755] therapy with 
cytarabine/daunorubicin (7+3) or CPX-351.  CR rates were superior in the CPX-
351 arm 37.3% vs 25.6% in 7+3 arm (p=0.04). Sixty day mortality rates were 
superior in the CPX-351 arm (21.2% 7+3 vs. 13.7% CPX-351). This was largely 
due to decreased incidence of death due to disease in the CPX-351 arm (3.3% 
CPX-351 vs 13.3% in 7+3 arm). The study met its primary objective, with CPX-
351 demonstrating superior OS compared to 7+3 (median survival 9.56 months vs 
5.95 months, HR=0.69, p=0.005).[ADDRESS_545756] of care de novo  AML is compelling for the 
following reasons:  
 
1) Phase 1/[ADDRESS_545757] demonstrated statistically significant 
benefit for high risk patients.  
2) In AAML1031, mitoxantrone/cytarabine is proving to be a treatment block 
that has longer periods of neutropenia and an increased incidence of infection 
(personal communication, Richard Aplenc, MD). 
3) The use of CPX-[ADDRESS_545758] 
maintain anthracycline efficacy while diminishing the risk for anthracycline-
induced cardiomyopathy. 
4) Eventually, this agent may be able to replace ADE and avoid etoposide 
exposure and the possibility of secondary malignancies.  
5) The i-BFM efficacy data for DNX is compelling; however, DNX is not 
available for future study in the [LOCATION_002].  
 
Thus, AAML1421 will be the first prospective study of short and long-term 
cardiotoxicity with liposomal anthracycline delivery in pediatric patients receiving 
high cumulative doses of anthracyclines 
 
2.5 Dosing Rationale 
As detailed in the background, the pediatric phase 1 trial of CPX-351 at Cincinnati 
Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_431404] 100 units/m2/dose on Days 1, 3, 5 
(the adult MTD). There were no DLTs. This finding is consistent with the testing of prior 
liposomal anthracyclines (eg, Doxil, DNX) that have demonstrated safety in children at the 
adult MTD. Enrollment on AAML1421 will begin at DL1, which will be 135 units/m2/ dose 
on Days 1, 3, 5.  
 
The rationale for studying this dose level includes:  
 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AAML1421  
Version Date: 02/22/2018   Page 18 
1) There were no DLTs at 100 units/m2/dose on Days 1, 3, 5 in the aforementioned and 
ongoing pediatric phase 1 study. 
2) The DLTs in the adult study at 134 units/m2 were persistent cytopenia > 56 days (1 
patient), CHF (1 patient), and hypertensive crisis (1 patient). The epi[INVESTIGATOR_431405] a period of sepsis and was transient. Hypertensive crises are very rare 
in the pediatric/adolescent and young adult population (AYA) population; therefore 
this toxicity may not be relevant to the eligible patients in this study. The FDA agreed 
to a starting dose of 134 units/m2/dose (our proposal rounds the dose to 135 units/m2) 
upon review of the phase 1 protocol conducted at Cincinnati Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].    
3) CPX-351 at a dose of 135 units/m2/ dose delivers a total daunorubicin dose of 
approximately 180 mg/m2, which is comparable to the liposomal daunorubicin 
delivered in DNX in the Kaspers et al study.2 Also, this dose is comparable to the 
150 mg/m2 cumulative dose of daunorubicin administered during Induction I of 
AAML0531 and AAML1031, thus providing a dose that is comparable to published 
literature and potentially translatable to a randomized phase 3 study. 
4) If 135 units/m2/dose is not tolerated, there will be a single dose de-escalation to 
100 units/m2/dose (DL0).  
 
The phase 1 portion of AAML1421 was completed in 12/2016 and DL1 (135 
units/m2/dose) was found to be the RP2D. The dose that will be used in the phase 2 
portion of the study will be 135 units/m2/dose given on days 1, 3, and 5. 
 
2.[ADDRESS_545759] risk for cardiac damage. The exploratory 
objectives outlined below will evaluate the feasibility of stringent testing of cardiac 
function and biomarkers of cardiac injury to provide a more timely assessment of 
a patient's risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_431406]-induced cardiomyopathy. These 
studies are important as they have not been studied prospectively in any published 
pediatric studies using liposomal anthracyclines.  
 
The current COG phase [ADDRESS_545760] 
comprehensive and complete data set of cardiac function available for children 
with AML. The AAML1031 data will include ejection fraction/shortening fraction 
(EF/SF) values entered into the remote data entry systems at the start of each course 
of chemotherapy for more than [ADDRESS_545761] clinical trial monitoring, and may only become 
symptomatic decades later10,14 or during periods of high stress such as sepsis or 
pregnancy. Biomarkers of cardiac injury may provide a more timely assessment of 
a patient’s risk for development of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. In this 
study we will evaluate the feasibility of incorporating conventional and advanced 
echocardiogram monitoring as well as measurement of potential biomarkers of 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AAML1421  
Version Date: 02/22/[ADDRESS_545762] likely to benefit 
from early medical intervention, and permit future evaluations of possible 
cardioprotective strategies. 
 
Potential biomarkers of cardiac injury to be evaluated in this study include 
conventional and advanced echocardiography, serum cardiac troponin-T, N-
terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and high sensitivity C- reactive 
protein (hs- CRP ). As an exploratory objective, a peripheral blood microRNA 
profile predictive of myocyte damage will be evaluated following anthracycline 
administration. Additionally, we plan to incorporate whole exome sequencing to 
investigate genetic predisposition to anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy.  
 
2.6.2 Echocardiogram, Cardiac Troponin-T, N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide 
(NT-proBNP), and hs- CRP  
Biomarkers of cardiac injury may provide a more timely assessment of a patient’s 
risk for development of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. Serum levels of 
cardiac troponin-I (cTnI), troponin-T(cTnT), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), or 
the amino-terminal fragment of the BNP precursor (NT-proBNP) are associated 
with myocardial ischemia or strain injury and may be predictive of future 
subclinical or symptomatic cardiomyopathy (For reviews see: Dolci et al.49 and 
Christenson et al.50). Lipsultz et al. have described elevations in cTnT and NT-
proBNP among children with high risk ALL who were treated with moderate doses 
of doxorubicin during induction and in post-remission therapy.51 Elevations of 
cTnT at any time during the investigation were seen in nearly half of the children 
that did not also receive dexrazoxane prior to doxorubicin, whereas elevations in 
cTnT were only seen in about 20% of the patients that received dexrazoxane. 
Increases in cTnT were associated with lower LV mass and LV end-diastolic 
posterior wall thickness by [CONTACT_51541] [ADDRESS_545763]-CPX-351 . 
Further, myocardial deformation, a novel measure of more subtle, regional 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AAML1421  
Version Date: 02/22/2018   Page 20 
ventricular dysfunction will be explored (as described below). Together these data 
may allow indirect comparison of cardiotoxicity as similarly measured by 
[CONTACT_431449]-containing 
regimens for hematologic malignancies. Further, it will provide critical 
preliminary data on which to base biomarker and imaging evaluations of 
cardiotoxicity during subsequent studies of CPX-351, such as a randomized phase 
[ADDRESS_545764] 
anthracycline formulations demonstrate troponin elevations as early as 4 hours 
after an anthracycline dose, but more often within several days after anthracycline 
exposure.52 One adult study demonstrated the range of peak troponin 
concentrations being observed between days 6 and 35 of an anthracycline 
containing chemotherapy cycle (mean day 21).53 Additionally, both pediatric and 
adult studies report prolonged troponin release up to 1 month following 
anthracycline exposure.54  Preliminary data from the Cincinnati pediatric phase I 
study of CPX-351 has not demonstrated any elevations in high sensitivity troponin 
at early (24-48 hours after dose 3 of CPX-351) or late (end of cycle) time points. 
[[CONTACT_431502], personal communication] While this might reflect the 
absence of significant cardiac injury associated with the liposomal encapsulation 
of daunorubicin, it could also indicate that the longer half- life and sustained plasma 
concentration of the anthracycline component of CPX-[ADDRESS_545765] anthracycline regimens.  Thus, 
serial cardiac biomarker samples will be collected following CPX-351 exposure 
on days 8, 15, 22 and 28-30 of cycle 1. 
 
2.6.3 Novel Biochemical and Imaging Biomarkers of Cardiotoxicity 
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression with 
a critical role in modulating cardiac regeneration, repair, and pathologic 
remodeling in response to stress and disease.[ADDRESS_545766] emerged 
as highly sensitive and specific markers of cardiomyocyte injury and 
cardiovascular disease.56 While the role of miRNAs in modulating anthracycline-
induced cardiomyocyte injury has been demonstrated in animal models,57,58 less is 
known about circulating miRNA profiles in humans receiving anthracyclines. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_431407] a small cohort of children receiving anthracycline chemotherapy 
demonstrates that miR-29b and miR-499 are specifically upregulated by 2-3-fold 
6, 12, and/or 24 hours following a cycle of anthracycline (n=24), while both were 
unchanged in children receiving non-cardiotoxic chemotherapy (n=9). Further, 
plasma expression of these miRNAs was significantly higher 6 and/ or [ADDRESS_545767] dose of CPX-351, and weekly 
through one month after initiation of CPX-351. As above, the longer half-life and 
sustained plasma concentrations of the liposomal daunorubicin component of 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AAML1421  
Version Date: 02/22/2018   Page 21 
CPX-351 warrant longer monitoring of miRNA as the timing of anthracycline-
induced miRNA elevation may be delayed. The miRNA studies will be conducted 
and funded at Seattle Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research 
Center. 
 
In addition to collecting conventional echocardiogram parameters of LV function 
(SF and EF) we will be requesting DICOM echo images to be sent for central 
analysis of myocardial strain. Myocardial strain is a dimensionless index reflecting 
the total deformation of ventricular myocardium during a cardiac cycle as a 
percentage of its original length and can be readily measured during routine 
echocardiography.[ADDRESS_545768] been demonstrated in children, both during 
and years following anthracycline therapy.60,61 Increasing evidence demonstrates 
that early anthracycline- induced alterations in myocardial deformation precede 
reductions in left ventricular SF or EF.60 Further, reduced peak systolic global 
longitudinal strain (GLS) has been shown to predict subsequent cardiotoxicity in 
adults receiving anthracycline.[ADDRESS_545769] sought to define genetic risk factors and to 
develop predictive models for the development of anthracycline-associated LV 
shortening dysfunction.68-70 Additional work is needed to define genetic variation 
that may play a role in the development of short term, anthracycline associated 
cardiac toxicity.

3.1.4 Study Enrollment 
Patient enrollment will be facilitated using the Oncology Patient Enrollment 
Network (OPEN). OPEN is a web-based registration system available on a 24/[ADDRESS_545773] an active CTEP-IAM account 
(check at https://ctepcore.nci.nih.gov/iam ) and a 'Registrar' role on either the lead 
protocol organization (LPO) or participating organization roster.   Registrars must 
hold a minimum of an AP registration type.  If a DTL is required for the study, the 
registrar(s) must also be assigned the OPEN Registrar task on the DTL. 
 
All site staff will use OPEN to enroll patients to this study. It is integrated with the 
CTSU Enterprise System for regulatory and roster data and, upon enrollment, 
initializes the patient position in the Rave database. OPEN can be accessed at 
https://open.ctsu.org  or from the OPEN tab on the CTSU members’ side of the 
website at https://www.ctsu.org . To assign an IVR or NPI[INVESTIGATOR_6688], 
crediting, consenting, drug shipment (IVR only), or investigator receiving a 
transfer in OPEN, the IVR or NPI[INVESTIGATOR_6689] 1572 in RCR 
the IRB number used on the site’s IRB approval.  If a DTL is required for the study, 
the IVR or NPI[INVESTIGATOR_431408]-related tasks on 
the DTL. 
 
Prior to accessing OPEN, site staff should verify the following: 
 
 All eligibility criteria have been met within the protocol stated timeframes. 
 All patients have signed an appropriate consent form and HIPAA 
authorization form (if applicable). 
 
Note: The OPEN system will provide the site with a printable confirmation of 
registration and treatment information. Please print this confirmation for your 
records.

3.3 Definitions 
CNS disease  
CNS status is defined as: 
CNS 1: In cerebral spi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF), absence of blasts on cytospin preparation, regardless 
of the number of white blood cells (WBCs). 
 
CNS 2: In CSF, presence < 5/μL WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts, or ≥ 5/ µL WBCs 
but negative by [CONTACT_83972]/Bleyer algorithm: 
CNS 2a: < 10/μL RBCs; < 5/μL WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts; 
CNS 2b: ≥ 10/μL RBCs; < 5/μL WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts; and 
CNS 2c: ≥ 10/μL RBCs; ≥ 5/μL WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts but 
negative by [CONTACT_83972]/Bleyer algorithm (see below). 
 
CNS3: In CSF, presence of ≥ 5/μL WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts (in the absence 
of a traumatic lumbar puncture) and/or clinical signs of CNS leukemia. 
 
STEINHERZ/BLEYER ALGORITHM FOR EVALUATING TRAUMATIC LUMBAR 
PUNCTURES: 
If the patient has leukemic cells in the peripheral blood and the lumbar puncture is 
traumatic and the cytospin contains ≥ 5 WBC/μL with blasts, the following algorithm 
should be used to distinguish between CNS2 and CNS3 disease: 
 
CSF WBC  > 2X Blood WBC 
CSF RBC    Blood RBC 
 
Therefore, a patient with CSF WBC ≥ 5/μL blasts, whose CSF WBC/RBC is 2X greater 
than the blood WBC/RBC ratio, has CNS disease at diagnosis.  
 
For example, the following patient would be classified as CNS3: CSF WBC = 60/μL; CSF 
RBC = 1500/μL; blood WBC = [ZIP_CODE]/μL; blood RBC = 3.0 X 106/μL: 
 
  60    = 0.04  >  2X     [ZIP_CODE]      = 0.015 
1500                           3.0 X 106

4.0 TREATMENT PROGRAM 
Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical 
interventions are based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on established 
standards of care. Minor unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed therapy 
and/or disease evaluations (and up to 1 week for surgery) f or valid clinical, patient and family 
logistical, or facility, procedure and/or anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable (except 
where explicitly prohibited within the protocol).  
 
4.1 Overview of Treatment Plan 
This is a two part study comprised of a Dose-Finding phase to determine the RP2D of 
CPX-351 followed by [CONTACT_431452]. In both phases of the trial, CPX-351 will be 
administered intravenously over 90 minutes on Days 1, 3, and 5 in Cycle 1 and FLAG will 
be administered in Cycle 2. A diagnostic lumbar puncture will be performed and intrathecal 
chemotherapy will be given prior to each cycle of systemic therapy. Patients without 
evidence of CNS disease (CNS1) do not require additional CNS -directed therapy during 
Cycle 1. Patients with CNS2 disease will receive further intrathecal chemotherapy 
according to the guidelines set in Section 4.2.3 . Patients treated on the phase 2, Dose-
Efficacy phase will receive CPX-351 at a dose of 135 units/m2/dose.  Pharmacokinetic 
(PK) sampling during the first cycle of treatment will be optional for the patients enrolled 
in the Efficacy phase of this study (see Section 14 ). 
 
The use of dexrazoxane will not be allowed on this trial. 
 
Post-treatment therapy: Please note that AAML1421 includes only 2 cycles of therapy.  
Patients in remission following cycle 2 should proceed to transplant or other therapy 
without delay and according to institutional practice.  
 
The phase 1 Dose-Finding portion of the study was completed in 12/2016. The 
recommended Phase 2 dose was found to be 135 Units/m2/  dose. 
DLT assessment for CPX-351 will occur during Cycle 1 of the Dose-Finding phase. 
Patients will be assigned a CPX-351 dose level at the time of enrollment. The starting dose 
(DL1) will be 135 units/m2/dose on Days 1, 3, 5. If 135 units/m2/dose is not tolerated, there 
will be a single dose de-escalation to 100 units/m2/dose (DL0). 
 
CPX -351 
Dose Level  CPX -351 Dose  
(1 Unit = 1 mg cytarabine and 0.44 mg daunorubicin)  
0 100 Units/m2/dose  
1 135 Units/m2/dose  
 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling during the first cycle of treatment will be required for the 
patients enrolled in the Dose Finding phase of this study (see Section 14 ). 
 
Note: Central venous access in the form of a double lumen Broviac or Hickman, port- a 
cath, or peripherally inserted central catheter is highly recommended.

4.1.1 Concomitant Medications and Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_431410]. 
 
Corticosteroids should not be used as anti-emetic therapy. 
Corticosteroid therapy is not permissible except for the following 
indications:  
 As treatment or prophylaxis for anaphylactic reactions 
 As a treatment for symptoms of Ara-C syndrome including fever, 
rash, or conjunctivitis (see Section 5.3.4 )    
 As treatment for rash possibly related to CPX-351 (see Section 
5.3.1 ) 
 Suspected or confirmed adrenal insufficiency 
 Pain management per institutional guidelines. Note, it is not 
recommended to use prolonged courses (> 3 days) of 
corticosteroids for pain management. CPX-351 is a 
myelosuppressive chemotherapeutic agent and extended use of 
corticosteroids may result in increased susceptibility to infections. 
 
During Cycle 1 (C PX-351), the use of filgrastim (G-CSF) or biosimilar 
may be used at the treating physician’s discretion to enhance neutrophil 
recovery when clinically indicated. Routine use of filgrastim in 
clinically well patients awaiting count recovery is not recommended. I f 
the treating physician determines that filgrastim use is indicated in 
Cycle 1, the pegylated formulation (pegfilgrastim) should not be used.  
 
 
Necessary supportive measures for optimal medical care will be given throughout 
the study as indicated by [CONTACT_165630]’s medical need. For 
example, administration of antiemetics is strongly recommended. Monitoring for 
tumor lysis and preemptive or early intervention is recommended. 
 
It is recommended that the patient’s fluid status and hepatic and renal function be 
carefully monitored during the drug administration period. In this regard, patients 
should be well hydrated during the days of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 chemotherapy drug 
administration, with the intent of maintaining urine output  3 mL/kg/hr. 
 
I
f copper toxicity is suspected, check serum copper levels. If abnormal, monitor 
until levels return to normal range. For patients receiving sources of copper such 
as in total parenteral nutrition (TPN), monitor for signs and symptoms of copper 
toxicity. 
 
To prevent drug incompatibility, no other medications should be administered 
concurrently through the same IV line as study drugs.

For COG Supportive Care Guidelines see: 
https://childrensoncologygroup.org/index.php/cog-supportive-care-guidelines   
under Standard Sections for Protocols. 
 
Antifungal prophylaxis 
Antifungal agents per institutional guidelines should be administered when ANC 
falls below 200/µL and continued until count recovery. 
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_431411] (sum of the neutrophils, bands and monocytes) 
rises for 2 successive days, and the patient is afebrile and clinically stable. An 
additional discharge criterion of an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of at least 
200/µL is also suggested. 
 
It is recommended that patients should be assigned to rooms with special air 
filtration systems such as high efficiency particulate air filters (HEPA) or clean-air 
rooms with constant positive pressure airflow if at all possible. 
 
Pain Management 
A single-institution, Phase 1 study of CPX-351 was conducted at Cincinnati 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_431412]. As described 
in the background, 2 patients with pre-existing analgesic requirements experienced 
Grade 3 pain events at the 134 units/m2 dose level that met protocol-derived DLT 
criteria and were considered possibly related to CPX-351. If pain develops in any 
patient after the initiation of CPX-351, it is recommended that the treating 
physician initiate institution-appropriate therapy with intravenous narcotics. 
Corticosteroids for pain are not recommended, but may be used with caution per 
institutional guidelines. For more information, please refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS].

4.2.4 Response Assessment  
Criteria to Begin Cycle 2 
 Patients will have a disease assessment on Day 28- 30 of Cycle 1. If a bone 
marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_431413] (dry tap, no spi[INVESTIGATOR_170106]), a follow-up bone 
marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_431414] 2 weeks to assess 
cellularity and response. 
 If aspi[INVESTIGATOR_6706]/or biopsy results indicate a hypocellular marrow (< 10% 
cellularity on biopsy), then continue to repeat bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_6706]/or 
biopsy not less than once every 14 days until response can be assessed. 
 If count recovery is noted within 14 days of an evaluable marrow, there is no 
need to repeat the marrow to confirm response. Once disease response 
assessment can be made after Cycle 1, and non-hematologic toxicities 
probably or definitely related to CPX-351 recover to ≤ Grade 2, then patients 
will receive Cycle 2 of FLAG. 
 If the bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_6706]/or biopsy performed after Cycle 1 reveals ≥ 
5% blasts and ≤ 25% blasts, then the patient should proceed to Cycle 2 of 
chemotherapy consisting of FLAG.  
 If the patient meets criteria for CR, CRp, or CRi after Cycle 1, then the patient 
can proceed to Cycle 2. (See Section 10.2  for definitions of response.)  
 
Note: The patient will be removed from protocol therapy if one of the 
following criteria is met:  
 Patients with ≥ Grade 2 toxicities not related to CPX-351 lasting > 50 days 
from the start of Cycle 1 that are considered by [CONTACT_431453]. 
 Patients who have > 25% blasts after Cycle 1 will be considered a 
treatment failure and will be removed from protocol therapy.  
 In the Efficacy phase, if after Cycle 1 (CPX-351) a patient has a 
hypoplastic bone marrow for ≥ 60 days and failure to recover a peripheral 
ANC > 500/µL and a non-transfusion dependent platelet count > 
20,000/µL not due to malignant infiltration or severe infection (defined as 
≥ Grade 3 infection), they will be considered a treatment failure and will 
go off protocol therapy. 
 In the Dose-Finding phase, patients meeting criteria for a hematologic 
DLT in Cycle 1. The phase 1 Dose-Finding phase completed 12/2016.

5.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS FOR TOXICITIES 
5.1 Definition of Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
The phase 1 Dose-Finding portion of the study was completed 12/12/2016.   
 
DLT will be defined as any of the following events that occur after the first dose of CPX-
[ADDRESS_545803] cycle of therapy. DLT assessment will occur during the D ose-Finding 
phase. 
 
Non-Hematologic Dose-Limiting Toxicity will be defined as any ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_545804] dose of CPX-351 that is possibly, probably 
or definitely related to CPX-351, and with the specific exclusion of: 
 Alopecia 
 Grade 3 fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea 
 Grade [ADDRESS_545805] or  ALT elevation that improves to ≤ G rade 2 within 14 days 
 Grade 3 or 4 isolated electrolyte abnormalities that resolve, with or without 
intervention, to ≤ Grade 2 within 72 hours. Electrolyte supplementation is 
encouraged. 
 Tumor lysis syndrome 
 Grade 3 or 4 fever, febrile neutropenia, or infection with or without hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
 Grade 3 rash 
 Grade 3 mucositis that resolves (with or without supportive care) to ≤ Grade 2 
elevation within 14 days 
 Early nutritional intervention with TPN or enteral tube feeding for anorexia, nausea, 
or concern for poor nutritional status will not be considered a DLT 
 Grade 3 troponin elevations without EKG or other evidence of myocardial ischemia 
 Grade 3 or greater pain due to leukemia, mucositis, typhlitis, infection, or obviou s 
injury. 
   
Hematologic Dose-Limiting Toxicity will be defined as failure to recover a peripheral 
ANC > 500/µL and non-transfusion dependent platelet count > 20,000/µL due to 
documented bone marrow aplasia/hypoplasia (i.e., not due to malignant infiltration) for 
greater than or equal to [ADDRESS_545806] deviations above the approximate median 
time to ANC recovery for patients receiving mitoxantrone/cytarabine on COG study 
AAML0531. Failure to recover peripheral counts due to disease involvement of the bone 
marrow will not be considered dose-limiting. 
 
5.2 Dose Modifications Due to Toxicity Related to CPX-351  
5.2.1  
Only one cycle consisting of three doses of CPX-351 will be administered to 
participants in this study. If ≥ Grade 4 non-hematologic dose limiting toxicity 
probably, or definitely related to CPX-351 occurs prior to completion of all 
planned doses, hold the remaining dose(s). These patients (in both the Dose-
Finding and Efficacy phases) will be removed from protocol therapy.

5.3 Modifications and Supportive Care Recommendations for Toxicity Related to 
Protocol Therapy (Cycle 1 and Cycle 2) 
5.3.1 Rash  
A macular-papular rash occurring within one week of treatment initiation occurs 
in the majority of patients treated with CPX-351. Grade 3 rash occurred in 6% of 
adults participating in the phase [ADDRESS_545807] 
receive topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930]. Pruritus may be treated with diphenhydramine. If 
extensive or refractory to topi[INVESTIGATOR_8588], a 3-5 day course of systemic prednisone 
or methylprednisolone may be used.  
 
5.3.2 Hand-Foot Syndrome  
Hand-foot syndrome has been reported in patients treated with other liposomal 
chemotherapy products and high-dose cytarabine regimens. Patients who develop 
hand-foot syndrome may receive topi[INVESTIGATOR_39669] (such as Aquaphor) as well as 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_431416]. Oral administration of 
vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) can also be used for these patients - BSA <0.5 m2: 50 mg 
per day; BSA 0.5-1.0 m2: 100 mg per day; BSA 1.1- 1.5 m2:  200 mg per day, and 
BSA >1.5 m2: [ADDRESS_545808] been caused by [CONTACT_431454]. However, blood cultures should be obtained even if fever is thought to 
be likely due to cytarabine. Institution of antibiotics for fever associated with 
cytarabine infusion is at the discretion of the treating physician (see fever 
management recommendations in the COG Supportive Care Guidelines ). 
 
For rash or conjunctivitis, withhold cytarabine for Grade 3-4 toxicity until resolved 
to ≤ Grade 1. Make up missed doses and consider concurrent treatment with 
hydrocortisone or dexamethasone, and/or with dexamethasone ophthalmic drops 
for conjunctivitis only. 
 
5.3.[ADDRESS_545809] 
prolonged excretion of cytarabine leading to more severe marrow and 
extramedullary toxicity.  
 Patients with a serum creatinine > 2 mg/dL or > 2x normal for age should be 
hy
drated orally or intravenously. Following hydration, the patient must have a 
creatinine clearance ≥ 60  mL/min/1.73m² as measured preferably by a nuclear 
G
FR scan, timed urine collection for creatinine clearance, or calculated by [CONTACT_431455]. 
    AAML1421 
 
Version Date: 02/22/2018   Page 43 
 If the creatinine clearance is abnormal (< 60 mL/min/1.73m2) then Cycle 2 
high dose cytarabine should be reduced by 50% for each daily dose. With this 
approach, previous research has shown the prevention of subsequent 
neurotoxicity in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_431417].72

6.2 CYTARABINE                 
(Cytosine arabinoside, Ara-C, Cytosar®) NSC #[ZIP_CODE]   (07/13/15)  
 
 
Source and Pharmacology:  
Cytarabine appears to act through the inhibition of DNA polymerase. A limited, but 
significant, incorporation of cytarabine into both DNA and RNA has also been reported. It 
exhibits cell phase specificity, primarily killing cells undergoing DNA synthesis (S-phase) 
and under certain conditions blocking the progression of cells from the G1 phase to the S-
phase. Cytarabine is metabolized by [CONTACT_431456] (Ara-CTP), an effective inhibitor of DNA polymerase. Ara-
CTP is inactivated by a pyrimidine nucleoside deaminase, which converts it to the nontoxic 
uracil derivative (Ara-U). It appears that the balance of kinase and deaminase levels may 
be an important factor in determining sensitivity or resistance of the cell to cytarabine. It 
has an initial distributive phase t ½ of about 10 minutes, with a secondary elimination phase 
t½ of about 1 to 3 hours. Peak levels after intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of 
cy
tarabine occur about 20 to 60 minutes after injection and are lower than IV 
administration. Intrathecally administered doses are metabolized and eliminated more 
slowly with a t ½ of about 2 hours.

Source and Pharmacology:  
Filgrastim is a human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), produced by 
[CONTACT_12060]. Filgrastim is a 175 amino acid protein with a molecular 
weight of 18,800 daltons manufactured by [CONTACT_297421] E  coli 
bacteria into which has been inserted the human granulocyte colony stimulating factor 
gene. It differs from the natural protein in that the N- amino acid is methionine and the protein 
is not glycosylated. G-CSF is a lineage specific colony-stimulating factor which regulates 
the production of neutrophils within the bone marrow and affects neutrophil progenitor 
proliferation, differentiation, and selected end-cell functional activation (including 
enhanced phagocytic ability, priming of the cellular metabolism associated with respi[INVESTIGATOR_431419], antibody dependent killing, and the increased expression of some functions 
associated with cell surface antigens). Filgrastim exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics with 
clearance dependent on filgrastim concentration and neutrophil count. Filgrastim is cleared 
by [CONTACT_10521]. The elimination half-life is similar for subcutaneous and intravenous 
administration, approximately 3.5 hours. The time to peak concentration when administered 
subcutaneously is 2-8 hours.

6.4 FLUDARABINE        
(Fludara®, fludarabine phosphate, 2-fluoro-ara-AMP) NSC# 312887 (01/10/18)  
 
 
Source and Pharmacology:   
Fludarabine phosphate is a synthetic purine nucleoside. It differs from the physiologic 
nucleosides, adenosine, in that the sugar moiety is arabinose instead of ribose, and by [CONTACT_113869] a fluorine atom to the purine base adenine. Fludarabine is also a fluorinated 
nucleotide analog the antiviral agent vidarabine, (ara-A). The addition of fluorine results 
in increased aqueous solubility and resistance to enzymatic degradation by [CONTACT_431458]. Fludarabine (2-fluoro-ara-A) is commercially available as the monophosphate 
salt (2-fluoro-ara-AMP). The monophosphorylation increases the drug's aqueous solubility 
while maintaining pharmacologic activity. The chemical name [CONTACT_431498] 9H-Purin-6-amine, 2-fluoro-9- (5-0-phosphono β-D-arabino-furanosyl) (2-fluoro-ara-
AMP) and the molecular weight is 365.2.  
 
Fludarabine is a purine antagonist antimetabolite. In vivo , fludarabine phosphate is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_431421] 2-fluoro-ara-A and then it is phosphorylated intracellularly by 
[CONTACT_431459], 2-fluoro-ara-ATP. This metabolite appears 
to act by [CONTACT_293666], ribonucleotide reductase and DNA primase, 
thus inhibiting DNA synthesis. The mechanism of action of this antimetabolite is not 
completely characterized and may be multi-faceted. 
 
Phase [ADDRESS_545813] focused on 2-fluoro-ara-
A. Fludarabine phosphate 25 mg/m2 
infused intravenously over 30 minutes to adult cancer 
patients, showed a moderate accumulation of 2-fluoro-ara-A. During a 5-day treatment 
schedule, 2-fluoro-ara-A plasma trough levels increased by a factor of about 2.  
Fludarabine is widely distributed. The volume of distribution at steady state (V ss) reported 
after daily administration of 25 mg/m2 for 5 days to adults averaged at 96-98 L/m2. Tis sue 
distribution studies in animals indicate that the highest concentrations of the drug are in 
liver, kidney, and spleen. Although the extent to which fludarabine and/or its metabolites 
distribute into the CNS in humans has not been determined to date, severe neurologic 
toxicity (eg,, blindness, coma) has been reported in patients receiving the drug, particularly 
in high dosages. There is evidence from animal studies that fludarabine distributes into the 
CNS and that a toxic metabolite (2-fluoroadenine, possibly formed by [CONTACT_431460]), can be absorbed systematically via enterohepatic circulation and distributed into 
CSF. According to in vitro  data, about 19-29% of fludarabine is bound to plasma proteins.  
Following IV administration, fludarabine phosphate is dephosphorylated rapi[INVESTIGATOR_431422]. Plasma concentrations of fludarabine decline in a linear, dose-independent 
manner. The elimination profile of fludarabine also has been reported to be either biphasic 
or triphasic; however, reported terminal elimination half-lives have been similar. In adult 
cancer patients receiving fludarabine 25 mg/m2 as a 30-minute IV infusion daily for 5 days, 
a terminal half-life of about 20 hours was reported. In a limited number of pediatric 
patients, the plasma concentration profile of fludarabine exhibited both monoexponential 
and biexponential decay, with a mean t 1/2 of 10.5 hours in patients with monoexponential 
elimination and a t 1/2 of 1.2-1.4 and 12.4-19 hours, respectively, in patients with 
biexponential elimination.

Version Date: 02/22/2018   Page 53 
Renal clearance accounts for about 40% of the total body clearance of fludarabine. Renal 
elimination appears to become more important at high dosages of the drug. The dose of 
fludarabine needs to be adjusted in patients with moderate renal impairment. 
The use of fludarabine in combination with pentostatin is not recommended due to the risk 
of severe pulmonary toxicity.

9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
9.1 Sample Size and Study Duration 
To complete this study, up to 50 evaluable patients (12 for the Dose Finding portion, 38 for 
the Efficacy portion) are required. Allowing for 10% of patients being inevaluable, an 
enrollment of up to 56 patients is required.  
 
Based on the accrual to the Dose Finding portion of AAML0523 at a similarly restricted 
number of sites, it is estimated that 1.5 patients per month will be enrolled on the Dose Finding 
portion of this study. We estimate that it will require up to 12 months to complete safety and 
DLT assessments for Cycle 1 (CPX-351), allowing [ADDRESS_545816] dose of study 
drug and DLT assessment. Based on accrual to recent COG studies for patients with 
relapsed/refractory AML (2.2 patients per month on AAML0523 and 1.8 patients per month 
on AAML07P1 Arm B, run simultaneously), it is estimated that [ADDRESS_545817] patient treated on stage 1. Allowing for DLT and efficacy assessment, we 
anticipate that 56 patients could be enrolled in approximately 23 months. 
    AAML1421 
 
Version Date: 02/22/2018   Page 59 
 
As described above, we anticipate that 38 patients will be enrolled on the Efficacy phase of 
the study.  In order to more precisely estimate the PK parameters of CPX-351 in children, we 
will extend the PK collection of this study to continue during the Efficacy phase.  In reviewing 
the experience on COG AALL07P1, where optional PK studies were collected in a similar 
manner in the Efficacy phase of that study, samples from 25 of 37 patients (68%) were 
successfully collected.  Therefore, we would expect approximately 25 patients to participate 
in PK collection during the Efficacy phase of AAML1421. In parallel, Jazz Pharmaceuticals 
also has collected PK samples on 16 patients participating in the Cincinnati Phase I/II single-
institution trial (11 at 100 units/m2/dose, 5 at 134 units/m2/dose). They anticipate 5 more 
patients will accrue to that study and provide additional samples  
 
A population PK analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_431461], the aforementioned pediatric study in Cincinnati , and future Phase 3 pediatric study to 
better estimate CPX-351 PK parameters in children. We will recruit children with all age 
groups, with an effort to enroll as many young children as possible. We anticipate the PK 
collected on this study will make significant strides in fulfilling their requirements to more 
precisely estimate the PK parameters of CPX-351 in children. 
 
 
9.2 Study Design 
 
9.2.1 Dose-Finding Phase 
The phase 1 Dose-Finding portion of the study was completed in 12/2016. 
The Dose-Finding Phase will be conducted using a modified rolling 6 design. Two to six 
patients can be concurrently enrolled onto a dose level, dependent upon (1) the number of 
patients enrolled at the current dose level, (2) the number of patients who have experienced 
DLT at the current dose level, and (3) the number of patients entered but with tolerability data 
pending at the current dose level. Accrual is suspended when a cohort of six has enrolled or 
when the study endpoints have been met. Dose level assignment is based on the number of 
participants currently enrolled in the cohort, the number of DLTs observed, and the number 
of participants at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a DLT ( ie, participants enrolled but who are not yet 
assessable for toxicity). For example, when three participants are enrolled onto a dose cohort, 
if toxicity data is available for all three and there are no DLTs, the recommended dose has 
been reached. If data is not yet available for one or more of the first three participants, or if 
one DLT has been observed, the new participant is entered at the same dose level. Lastly, if 
two or more DLTs have been observed, the dose level is de-escalated. This process is repeated 
for participants five and six. In place of suspending accrual after every three participants, 
accrual is only suspended when a cohort of six is filled. When participants are inevaluable for 
toxicity, they are replaced with the next available participant if escalation or de-escalation 
rules have not been fulfilled at the time the next available participant is enrolled onto the study. 
 
The following table provides the decision rules for enrolling a patient at (i) the current dose 
level (ii) at an escalated dose level, (iii) at a de-escalated dose level, or whether the study is 
suspended to accrual:

Results from the CCG 2951 study showed that a combination of mitoxantrone/cytarabine 
(MA) used for induction in pediatric patients with refractory/relapsed AML achieved a 
marrow remission rate of 76% and an overall response (CR + CRp) rate (criteria similar to 
    AAML1421 
 
Version Date: 02/22/2018   Page 61 
those used in this study) of 58%.73 Response was assessed after one cycle of MA, however, 
these children received significantly less intensive treatment for their de novo  AML than 
those who will relapse after receiving current de novo  regimens. In addition to fewer high 
dose
 cytarabine consolidation cycles, they received a lower cumulative anthracycline 
exposure compared with patients who will relapse following AAML0531 and AAML1031 
(≈ 290 mg/m2 vs. ≈ 440 mg/m2) . Thus, a response rate lower than 58% would be expected 
after one cycle for those who now receive anthracycline-containing reinduction regimens. 
However, this response was measured after one cycle of protocol therapy. 
 
More recently, COG AAML0523 tested the combination of clofarabine and cytarabine in 
children with AML in first relapse. In this trial, response was defined as best response (CR 
+ CRp) after up to 2 cycles. Of 48 patients, the overall response rate was 48%.74 Of 23 
responders, 11 (48%) were SD after Cycle 1, then achieved CR or CRp after Cycle 2. This 
supports the importance of receiving two cycles of reinduction therapy in order to 
determine the optimal response to therapy. Importantly, only 1/11 (9%) of patients who 
had > 20% blasts after Cycle 1 achieved CR or CRp in Cycle 2. This is consistent with data 
from the FLAG vs. FLAG/DNX study published by [CONTACT_431462] (Appendix Fig A1, online 
only) demonstrating dismal outcomes and low second remission rates in patients with > 
20% blasts after Cycle 1.2 However, Partial Remission is (PR) is a standard response 
definition for COG leukemia studies and includes blasts percentages between 5 and 25%. 
Therefore, patients who have > 25% blasts after Cycle 1 will be considered non-responders 
and removed from protocol therapy in order to be able to pursue other options.  
 
Kaspers et al. randomized patients to receive either FLAG or FLAG/DNX in children with 
AML in first relapse.2,75 In this trial, the primary endpoint was Day 28 bone marrow status. 
That is, patients who had < 20% blasts at Day [ADDRESS_545819] cycle of FLAG 
or FLAG/DNX. The secondary endpoint of the study was CR rate after two cycles of 
chemotherapy (FLAG/DNX then FLAG vs. FLAG then FLAG). As mentioned previously, 
the CR rate (ANC > 1000, platelets > 50K) after two cycles was 69% with FLAG/DNX, 
and 59% with FLAG (p=0•07).29 However, their CR definition was different in that study 
(ANC > 1000, platelets > 50K), than what is used for COG relapsed AML studies (ANC > 
1000, platelets > 100K).  
 
9.3 Methods of Analysis 
The response rate (CR+CRp), best response after up to two cycles, will be determined using 
the approach of Jung and Kim.76 The corresponding 90% confidence interval will be 
calculated using the approach of Koyama and Chen.77 The response rate will be calculated 
as the ratio of the number of patients who demonstrate response after up to two cycles of 
therapy divided by [CONTACT_431463]. Descriptive statistics will 
be used to summarize the proportion of patients experiencing ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_545820] of the 
timing of relapse on outcomes will be investigated in this study, but these analyses will be 
exploratory. 
 
Pharmacokinetic properties of CPX-351 
Steady state pharmacokinetics of CPX-351 will be obtained in all patients treated in the 
Dose Finding phase of the study. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the 
systemic exposure of CPX-351 (Clearance ( CL), Volume of Distribution ( Vd), Tmax½, 
    AAML1421 
 
Version Date: 02/22/2018   Page 62 
Area Under the Curve (AUC)). These parameters will be summarized with summary 
statistics, including means, medians, ranges, and standard deviations (if numbers and 
distribution permit). 
 
PK samples will also be collected during the efficacy portion of the study following the 
sparse sampling scheme outlined in Section14.[ADDRESS_545821] 20 patients in 
the Efficacy phase experience a toxic mortality (TM), defined as death within [ADDRESS_545822] dose of CPX-351 and not associated with disease progression, or if 5 or more of 
the 38 patients in the Efficacy phase experience a TM. Dose modification or termination 
will be considered with probability 0.05 if the true TM rate is 5% and with probability 0.79 
if the true TM rate is 20%. 
 
 
Monitoring of Cardiac Toxicity 
Dose modification or termination will be considered if [ADDRESS_545823] cycle of 
chemotherapy, or if 5 or more of the 38 patients in the Efficacy phase experience a severe 
cardiac toxicity. Note: Grade 4 or higher ejection fraction related to sepsis will not be 
considered a severe cardiac toxicity for this monitoring rule. Dose modification or 
termination will be considered with probability 0.05 if the true rate is 5% and with 
probability 0.79 if the true rate is 20%. 
 
9.4 Evaluability for Response  
A patient will be considered evaluable for response if: (1) the patient meets the eligibility 
criteria for the Efficacy Phase; (2) the patient receives at least one dose of CPX-351 at the 
RP2D; and (3) the patient is under follow-up for a sufficient period to evaluate the disease 
at the end of the Cycle [ADDRESS_545824] one dose of study drug will be considered evaluable for 
toxicity.  
 
9.6 Correlative Biology Studies 
9.6.1 Analytic Plan for Study Objective 1.3.1: Response in Biomarkers of Cardiac Injury 
to a Single Cycle of CPX-351 
The incidence, timing and magnitude of elevations in troponin, NT-BNP, hsCRP 
will be described. Spearman correlation coefficients will be used to correlate the 
    AAML1421 
 
Version Date: 02/22/[ADDRESS_545825]-CPX-351 baseline assessed by [CONTACT_431464] 1, and 
change in global longitudinal strain (GLS). A sample size of 30 patients will provide 
80% power (α=0.05) to detect a minimum correlation of 0.49. Additionally, t wo-
sample t-tests will be used to compare mean post-treatment values of troponin, NT-
BNP, and hsCRP for those with an ejection fraction decrease of less than 10% from 
baseline versus those 10% or greater from baseline. These descriptive analyses will 
provide critical preliminary data on which to base the timing and power 
calculations for subsequent phases of CPX-351 investigations in order to allow 
more definitive assessment of its cardiotoxic effects relative to other anthracycline 
regimens. 
 
9.6.2 Analytic Plan for Study Objective 1.3.2: Effect of CPX-[ADDRESS_545826] will be used to compare the mean global longitudinal strain (GLS) 
between the pre- treatment (at relapse) baseline and post-Cycle 1 echocardiogram. A 
sample size of 30 patients will provide 80% power (with 2 sided α=0.05) to detect a 
1.6% reduction in GLS, assuming a GLS standard deviation of 3%.78 
 
Quantification of miRNA change from baseline 
Candidate plasma miRNAs will be quantified at baseline (prior to relapse therapy) 
and Day 5 ([ADDRESS_545827] dose of CPX- 351), Day 6, and once Day 28- [ADDRESS_545828] method. A sample size of 30 patients will provide 80% power 
(α=0
.05) to detect a Ct difference from baseline of 1.7 for miR-29b and 1.6 for miR-
499, assuming Ct variability of 3.[ADDRESS_545829] deviations, respectively, for miR-
29b and miR-499 (based on K. Leger pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299]).  
 
Correlation of GLS and miRNA 
The relationship between 6-hour miR-29b and -[ADDRESS_545830] 6 hours following anthracycline 
therapy. However, a linear mixed effects model incorporating the additional time 
points will be used to explore the longitudinal relationship with each time point as a 
predictor variable for the measures of early cardiotoxicity. A sample size of 30 
patients will provide 80% power (α=0.05) to detect a minimum correlation of 0.49 . 
Power calculations were generated in PASS13. 
 
9.6.3 Analytic Plan for Study Objective 1.3.3: The Role of Rare Coding Variants as Risk 
Factors for Anthracycline-Induced Cardiomyopathy 
Our computational approach can be summarized as a two-step process with alignment 
of the sequence data using a commercial aligner followed by [CONTACT_431465]-alignment data. Sequence analysis will follow GATK’s best 
    AAML1421 
 
Version Date: 02/22/2018   Page 64 
practices in which duplicate variants from the sequencing process are removed 
(https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/guide/best-practices?bpm=DNAseq). In 
addition, local realignment is performed on mismatching bases around indels, a 
known artifact often produced by [CONTACT_431466][INVESTIGATOR_66558]. Quality scores on 
each individual mapped base are also recalibrated to account for expected errors 
emitted by [CONTACT_431467]. Finally, variations on genomic sites are identified 
relative to a reference genome and scores are assigned to each discovered variant to 
minimize both false positives and negatives. Custom Amazon Machine Image with 
all necessary tools and reference datasets in the Docker format will be developed for 
deployment in the Amazon cloud infrastructure. StarCluster will be used to manage 
the creation of all Amazon EC2 regular instances. Requested data as well as all 
intermediaries and final processed files are stored in Amazon S3 buckets with 
protected access. Finally, processed results will be downloaded to internal servers at 
the Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684] (CHOP) for visualization.

10.0 EVALUATION CRITERIA  
10.1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
This study will utilize version 4.0 of the CTCAE of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for 
toxicity and performance reporting. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded 
from the CTEP website  
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm). 
Additionally, toxicities are to be reported on the appropriate case report forms. 
 
Please note: ‘CTCAE v4.0’ is understood to represent the most current version of CTCAE 
v4.0 as referenced on the CTEP website (ie, v4.02 and all subsequent iterations prior to 
version 5.0). 
 
10.2 Response Criteria   
Response criteria will employ revised AML International Working Group Criteria,79 and 
include:  
 
Overall Response (OR):  OR rate is defined as the sum of the number of patients with 
complete remission (CR) plus those with complete remission in the absence of total platelet 
recovery (CRp) divided by [CONTACT_431468].  
 
Complete Remission (CR):  Attainment of an M1 bone marrow (< 5% blasts) with no 
evidence of circulating blasts or extramedullary disease and with recovery of peripheral 
blood counts (ANC ≥ 1000/µL and platelet count ≥ 100,000/µL). Flow cytometry may also 
be useful to distinguish between leukemia and a regenerating bone marrow. There is no 
requirement for bone marrow cellularity. 
 
CR With Partial Recovery of Platelet Count (CRp):  Attainment of an M1 bone marrow 
(< 5% blasts) and no evidence of circulating blasts or extramedullary disease and with 
recovery of ANC ≥ 1000/µL and platelet transfusion independence (defined as: no platelet 
transfusions x 1 week). 
 
Complete Remission with Incomplete Blood Count Recovery (CRi): Attainment of an 
M1 bone marrow (< 5% blasts) and no evidence of circulating blasts or extramedullary 
disease and with ANC < 1000/µL or platelet count < 100,000/µL without platelet 
transfusion independence (defined as: no platelet transfusions x 1 week). 
 
Partial Response (PR) : M2 bone marrow (5% to 25% blasts) and at least a 50% decrease 
in bone marrow blast percent from baseline. Bone marrow must have adequate cellularity 
(eg, ≥ 10%, if a biopsy is performed) to determine response. PR status will not be included 
in calculation of response to the regimen. A repeat bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_168886] 14 days 
may be required to distinguish between a PR and increased blasts caused by [CONTACT_431469], and is left at the discretion of the investigator.  
 
Treatment Failure (TF): 
In the Efficacy phase, if after Cycle 1 (CPX-351) a patient has a hypoplastic bone marrow 
for ≥ 60 days and failure to recover a peripheral ANC > 500/μL and a non-transfusion 
dependent platelet count > 20,000/μL not due to malignant infiltration or severe infection 
    AAML1421 
 
Version Date: 02/22/2018   Page 66 
(defined as ≥ Grade 3), they will be considered a treatment failure and will go off protocol 
therapy. 
 
The definition of treatment failure includes: 
a. An increase in the extent of bone marrow infiltration by [CONTACT_431470] (absolute 
increase of ≥ 20% blasts) OR 
b. Development of extramedullary disease (EMD) OR 
c. M2 marrow that does not qualify for PR status OR 
d. An M1 marrow with circulating blasts OR  
e. > 25% blasts in the bone marrow after Cycle 1 of therapy.  
 
Relapse:  Morphologic relapse after CR/CRp/CRi is defined as a reappearance of leukemic 
blasts in the peripheral blood or ≥ 5% blasts in the bone marrow not attributable to any 
other cause (eg, bone marrow regeneration after therapy). In the setting of recent treatment, 
if there are no circulating blasts and the bone marrow contains 5% to 20% blasts, a repeat 
bone marrow performed at least a week later is necessary to distinguish relapse from bone 
marrow regeneration. Should flow cytometric or molecular analyses suggest relapse (by 
[CONTACT_431471] a similar immunophenotype or mutation to the original leukemia) in 
the presence of < 5% blasts, or ≥ 5% blasts in a regenerating marrow, a repeat bone 
marrow(s) performed at least a week later is necessary to confirm relapse by [CONTACT_431472]. In such instances the date of recurrence is defined as the first date that more than 
5% blasts were observed in the marrow. The reappearance or development of cytologically 
proven extramedullary disease also indicates relapse. Molecular and/or genetic relapse is 
characterized by [CONTACT_57936] a cytogenetics or molecular abnormality.  
 
Unevaluable:  Aplastic or severely hypocellular marrow. In this instance, marrow 
evaluation should be repeated weekly until response determination can be made through at 
least Day 60. 
 
Bone Marrow Classification: 
M1 is  5% blasts 
M2 is 5 to 25% blasts 
M3 is > 25% blasts 
 
 
 
11.[ADDRESS_545831] be reported 
in an expedited manner to allow for timelier monitoring of patient safety and care. Th e 
following sections provide information about expedited reporting. 
 
11.2 Determination of reporting requirements 
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) whether the patient 
has received an investigational or commercial agent; 2) the characteristics of the adverse 
event including the grade  (severity), the relationship to the study therapy  (attribution), and 
the prior experience  (expectedness) of the adverse event; 3) the Phase (1, 2, or 3) of the 
    AAML1421 
 
Version Date: 02/22/2018   Page 67 
trial; and 4) whether or not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_431423].  
 
An investigational agent is a protocol drug administered under an Investigational New 
Drug Application (IND). In some instances, the investigational agent may be available 
commercially, but is actually being tested for indications not included in the approved 
package label.  
 
Commercial agents are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead from 
a commercial source. The NCI, rather than a commercial distributor, may on some 
occasions distribute commercial agents for a trial. 
 
When a study includes both investigational and commercial agents, the following rules 
apply.  
 Concurrent administration : When an investigational agent is used in 
combination with a commercial agent, the combination is considered to be 
investigational and expedited reporting of adverse events would follow the 
guidelines for investigational agents. 
 Sequential administration : When a study includes an investigational agent 
and a commercial agent on the same study arm, but the commercial agent is 
given for a period of time prior to starting the investigational agent, 
expedited reporting of adverse events which occur prior to starting the 
investigational agent would follow the guidelines for commercial agents. 
Once therapy with the investigational agent is initiated, all expedited 
reporting of adverse events follow the investigational agent reporting 
guidelines. 
 
11.3 Expedited Reporting Requirements – Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
To ensure compliance with these regulations/this guidance, NCI requires that AEs be 
submitted according to the timeframes in the AE reporting tables assigned to the protocol, 
using the CTEP Adverse Event Reporting System (CTEP-AERS). 
 
Any AE that is serious qualifies for expedited reporting . An AE is defined as any 
untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not 
considered drug related. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any adverse drug event 
(experience) occurring at any dose that results in ANY of the following outcomes: 
 
1) Death. 
2) A life-threatening adverse drug experience. 
3) An adverse event resulting in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929] (for ≥ 24 hours). This does not include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6718]. 
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions. 
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, 
or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience 
when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed in this definition. 
    AAML1421 
 
Version Date: 02/22/[ADDRESS_545832] 
administration of the investigational agent/intervention and has an attribution of a 
possible, probable, or definite relationship to the study therapy must be reported 
according to the CTEP-AERS reporting tables in this protocol.  
 
11.4.2 Persistent or Significant Disabilities/Incapacities 
Any AE that results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption 
of the ability to conduct normal life functions (formerly referred to as disabilities), 
congenital anomalies or birth defects, must be reported via CTEP-AERS if it 
occurs at any time following treatment with an agent under a NCI, COG, or 
industry sponsor IND/IDE since these are considered to be serious AEs. 
 
11.4.3 Dea th 
Reportable Categories of Death  
o Death attributable to a CTCAE term.  
o Death Neonatal: A disorder characterized by [CONTACT_31948] 
28 days of life.  
o Sudden Death NOS: A sudden (defined as instant or within one hour of the 
onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of life that cannot be 
attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5.  
o Death NOS: A cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term 
associated with Grade 5.  
o Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “ Disease 
progression ” in the system organ class (SOC) “ General disorders and 
administration site conditions ”.  Evidence that the death was a manifestation 
of underlying disease (e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth 
or progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) 
should be submitted.  
 
Any death occurring within [ADDRESS_545833] dose, regardless of attribution to 
the investigational agent/intervention requires expedited reporting within 
[ADDRESS_545834] dose of the investigational 
agent/intervention requires expedited reporting within 24 hours only if it is 
possibly, probably, or definitely related to the investigational agent/intervention. 
 
11.4.4 Secondary Malignancy 
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous 
malignancy (e.g., treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or 
chemotherapy). A metastasis of the initial neoplasm is not considered a secondary 
malignancy.  
    AAML1421 
 
Version Date: 02/22/2018   Page 69 
 
All secondary malignancies that occur following treatment need to be reported via 
CTEP-AERS. Three options are available to describe the event:  
 Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy  
 Myelodysplastic syndrome  
 Treatment related secondary malignancy  
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) must 
also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in this protocol. 
 
11.4.5 Second Malignancy 
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and 
is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy). Second malignancies require 
ONLY routine reporting via CDUS unless otherwise specified. 
 
11.4.6 Pregnancy, Pregnancy Loss, and Death Neonatal 
NOTE: When submitting CTEP-AERS reports for “Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy loss”, 
or “Neonatal loss”, the Pregnancy Information Form, available at: 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/Pregna
ncyReportForm.pdf , needs to be completed and faxed along with any additional 
medical information to [PHONE_100].  The potential risk of exposure of the fetus 
to the investigational agent(s) or chemotherapy agent(s) should be documented in 
the “Description of Event” section of the CTEP-AERS report. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy  
Patients who become pregnant on study risk intrauterine exposure of the 
fetus to agents that may be teratogenic. For this reason, pregnancy needs 
to be reported in an expedited manner via CTEP-AERS as Grade 3 
“Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions -  Other 
(pregnancy )” under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal 
conditions SOC. 
 
Pregnancy needs to be followed until the outcome is known . If the baby 
[CONTACT_170727] a birth defect or anomaly, then a second CTEP-AERS report 
is required. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy Loss (Fetal Death)  
Pregnancy loss is defined in CTCAE as “ Death in utero ”. Any pregnancy 
loss needs to be reported expeditiously, as Grade 4 “ Pregnancy loss , 
puerperium and perinatal conditions” SOC . Do NOT report a 
pregnancy loss as a Grade 5 event since CTEP-AERS recognizes any 
Grade 5 event as a patient death. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Death Neonatal  
Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE as “Newborn death occurring during 
the first 28 days after birth ” should be reported expeditiously, as Grade 
    AAML1421 
 
Version Date: 02/22/2018   Page 70 
4 “Death neonatal ” under the “ General disorders and administration” 
SOC when the death is the result of a patient pregnancy or 
pregnancy in partners of men on study . Do NOT report a neonatal 
death resulting from a patient pregnancy or pregnancy in partners of men 
on study as a Grade 5 event since CTEP-AERS recognizes any Grade 5 
event as a patient death.  
 
11.5 Reporting Requirements for Specialized AEs 
11.5.1 Baseline AEs 
Although a pertinent positive finding identified on baseline assessment is not an 
AE, when possible it is to be documented as “Course Zero” using CTCAE 
terminology and grade. An expedited AE report is not required if a patient is 
entered on a protocol with a pre-existing condition (eg, elevated laboratory value, 
diarrhea). The baseline AE must be re-assessed throughout the study and reported 
if it fulfills expedited AE reporting guidelines. 
 
a. If the pre-existing condition worsens in severity, the investigator must 
reassess the event to determine if an expedited report is required. 
b. If the AE resolves and then recurs, the investigator must re-assess the event 
to determine if an expedited report is required. 
c. No modification in grading is to be made to account for abnormalities 
existing at baseline. 
 
11.5.2 Persistent AEs 
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution between 
treatment cycles/courses.  
ROUTINE reporting: The AE must be reported only once unless the grade 
becomes more severe in a subsequent course. If the grade becomes more severe 
the AE must be reported again with the new grade. 
EXPEDITED reporting: The AE must be reported only once unless the grade 
becomes more severe in the same or a subsequent course. 
 
11.5.3 Recurrent AEs 
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves during a cycle/course of therapy 
and then reoccurs in a later cycle/course. 
ROUTINE reporting: An AE that resolves and then recurs during a subsequent 
cycle/course must be reported by [CONTACT_293862]. 
EXPEDITED reporting: An AE that resolves and then recurs during a subsequent 
cycle/course does not require CTEP-AERS reporting unless: 
1) The grade increases OR 
2) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99205]. 
 
11.6 Exceptions to Expedited Reporting 
An expedited report may not be required for a specific protocol where an AE is listed as 
expected. The exception or acceptable reporting procedures will be specified in the

within 7 calendar days of the investigator learning of the event.  
 
 Any event that results in a persistent or significant incapacity/substantial disruption of 
the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is 
an IME, which based upon the medical judgment of the investigator may jeopardize 
the patient and require intervention to prevent a serious AE, must be reported via 
CTEP-AERS if the event occurs following investigational agent administration.  
 
 Any death occurring within [ADDRESS_545838] dose, regardless of attribution to an 
agent/intervention requires expedited reporting within 24 hours via e-mail to the COG 
CTEP-AERS Coordinator and Study Chair.  
 Any death occurring greater than [ADDRESS_545839] dose with an attribution of 
possible, probable, or definite to an agent/intervention requires expedited reporting 
within 24 hours  via e-mail to the COG CTEP-AERS Coordinator and Study Chair. 
CTEP-AERS Medical Reporting includes the following requirements as part of the report: 
1) whether the patient has received at least one dose of an investigational agent on this 
study; 2) the characteristics of the adverse event including the grade  (severity), the 
    AAML1421

by [CONTACT_2005]’s Oncology Group, the COG Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
(DSMC) reviews reports of interim analyses of study toxicity and outcomes prepared by 
[CONTACT_4305], in conjunction with the study chair’s report. The DSMC may 
recommend the study be modified or terminated based on these analyses.  
 
Toxicity monitoring is also the responsibility of the study committee and any unexpected 
frequency of serious events on the trial are to be brought to the attention of the DSMC. The 
study statistician is responsible for the monitoring of the interim results and is expected to 
request DSMC review of any protocol issues s/he feels require special review. Any COG 
member may bring specific study concerns to the attention of the DSMC.  
 
The DSMC approves major study modifications proposed by [CONTACT_431474] (eg, termination, droppi[INVESTIGATOR_293832], increasing target sample size, etc.). The DSMC determines whether and to whom 
outcome results may be released prior to the release of study results at the time specified 
in the protocol document.

COG -approved cytogenetics laboratory on a fee-for-service basis. Prior arrangements for 
performing cytogenetics and/or FISH studies should be made with the laboratory. An 
authorization form for the reflexive FISH testing signed and dated (by [CONTACT_431475]) sent to the cytogenetics laboratory with the sample wi ll 
simplify and enhance the ability to obtain FISH testing and results.

A
 minimum of 2 mL (optimal volume, 3 mL) of fresh whole bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_5962] a needle into a syringe containing sodium heparin (preservative-free is preferable) 
is recommended in all cases. A first or second draw, or a draw from a repositioned needle, 
is best to ensure a sufficient number of leukemic cells in the aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]. The specimens should 
be kept at room temperature  and transported to the institutional cytogenetics laboratory 
as quickly as possible ( always within 24 hours of collection ). If shippi[INVESTIGATOR_431424], that laboratory should be contact[CONTACT_431476]. Some laboratories request specimens to be transferred in a 15-
mL conical tube filled with RPMI-1640 and 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. 
Specimens should be kept at ambient temperature. 
 
13.2.3 
I

13.2.4 
Per
ipheral blood (3-5 mL) collected in sodium heparin should be submitted as a back-up 
to the bone marrow when the marrow sample is suboptimal or unobtainable, if more than 
20% circulating blasts are identified, or when a constitutional abnormality ( eg, trisomy 21) 
is a possibility. For documenting a constitutional abnormality, a PHA stimulated blood 
study should be performed. 
 
For patients with myeloid sarcoma:  
In addition to the requirements described above, if touch preps are able to be prepared from 
the tumor, the institutional pathologist should distribute/triage order(s) for FISH to be 
performed accordingly ( eg, MLL, RUNX1T1-RUNX1, CBFB).

equirements for Data Submission 
The following are required for each case: a completed generic COG Cytogenetics/FISH 
Reporting Form (found on the COG Member website) and 2 original karyotypes (different 
    AAML1421 
 
Version Date: 02/22/2018   Page 76 
cells), with corresponding full-size metaphase spreads of each abnormal clone or [ADDRESS_545847] within 2 weeks after enrollment on the AAML1421 protocol  and within 
1 month of subsequent relapse, should it occur  (see A ppendix II). Reports must be sent 
electronically (preferred as PowerPoint presentation). If the laboratory is unable to send an 
electronic file with the documentation, please contact [CONTACT_431477]. Reporting forms must be filled out for all cases, whether or no t 
the cytogenetic analyses were successful. A separate form is required for each specimen 
(ie, bone marrow and blood) analyzed in each case. Published data on FISH screening 
report an overall incidence of occult aberrations in AML with normal karyotypes between 
3% to 10%.80-[ADDRESS_545848] be performed 
to evaluate for inv(16)/t(16;16), t(8;21), t(15;17) and 11q23. However, if the sample did 
not yield sufficient quantity of metaphases for analysis, -7 and -5/5q- should also be 
performed in addition to the inv(16)/t(16;16), t(8;21), t(15;17) and 11q23. Published data 
indicate that 10%-25% of patients who have one of these recurring translocations may have 
a concomitant deletion encompassing a region adjacent to the breakpoint on one of the 
involved derivative chromosomes. Such deletions may portend a less favorable 
prognosis.83-85 Thus, for all cases in which a recurring chromosomal abnormality [t(8;21), 
inv(16)/t(16;16), 11q23] is identified, it is recommended that FISH be performed with 
probes specific to that rearrangement, to evaluate any variant pattern that might include a 
deletion associated with a gene fusion. FISH forms should also be completed and sent to 
the coordinating cytogeneticist with images documenting the abnormal or normal FISH 
patterns. If the case has a suspected 12p it is recommended to perform FISH using ETV6 
probe. If the laboratory is not able to perform FISH, contact [CONTACT_431478]. Any discrepancies in interpretation between cytogenetics/FISH 
results from the laboratory and the coordinator will be discussed between the coordinators, 
with consult of additional cytogenetics committee members as necessary. The COG 
cytogenetics committee decision will prevail. 
Note: Please provide karyotype or Final Chromosome Report findings at initial time 
of diagnosis if available.

review for myocardial deformation and other echocardiographic 
parameters. Myocardial deformation will be measured using Tomtec 
software program, which allows post-hoc strain analysis on standard 
echocardiogram images across vendor platforms. 
 
In addition to the standard echocardiogram report generated by [CONTACT_431484], participating institutions are 
requested to send a digital copy of the original tracings from 
echocardiograms to be reviewed for study purposes.   
 
In addition to collecting conventional echocardiogram parameters of LV 
function (SF and EF) we will be requesting DICOM echo images to be 
sent for analysis of myocardial strain. 
 
Following ascertainment of end of Cycle 2 echocardiogram, ship: 
 de-identified echocardiogram reports and  
 DICOM echocardiogram images including the baseline 
echocardiogram (prior to protocol therapy), the beginning of 
Cycle 2 and end of therapy echocardiograms. 
 
Note: if a patient goes off protocol therapy at any point during the trial, 
please send the baseline and end of therapy echocardiogram report

APPENDIX II: SAMPLE SUBMISSION FOR CYTOGENETIC/FISH STUDIES 
(A COPY OF THIS SECTION MUST BE SENT TO THE RECOMMENDED INSTITUTIONAL, 
COG-APPROVED CYTOGENETICS LABORATORY) 
 
CHROMOSOME ANALYSIS 
 Bone marrow should be studied by [CONTACT_431487]. 
 A back-up blood specimen should be studied when the bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_431435] (in which case short-term unstimulated cultures are 
established to examine spontaneously dividing [presumably leukemic] cells) or when a 
constitutional chromosomal abnormality is a possibility (phytohemagglutinin-stimulated cultures 
should be established to examine presumably nonleukemic [constitutional] lymphocytes). 
 Short-term (15 - 48 hours) unstimulated cultures are recommended for each bone marrow sample. 
Analysis of direct preparations is successful in some laboratories. Mitogen-stimulated cultures of 
bone marrow samples should not be initiated. 
 All preparations must be G-banded. (Q- or R-banding will not be accepted as a stand-alone banding 
method.) 
 Complete analysis of 20 G-banded metaphases is required for each case, except as noted below. 
Complete analysis is defined as follows: the chromosomes in each metaphase cell have been 
counted; each chromosome has been examined to determine whether the banding pattern is normal, 
and all abnormalities present in the cell have been defined. Analysis may be accomplished by 
[CONTACT_431488]. Sometimes analysis of 20 
metaphases is not possible because of poor in vitro  growth or a very limited quantity of specimen. 
H
owever, limited characterization of the abnormal clone can still be informative. Such informative 
cases will be considered acceptable. A minimum analysis of 20 metaphases is required for a normal 
case.  
 Identification of clones will follow the criteria of the Second International Workshop on 
Chromosomes in Leukemia, as stated in the: General Report (Cancer Genet. Cytogenet 2:93-96, 
1980): at least [ADDRESS_545861] three metaphases with identical missing chromosomes will constitute a clone. Nonclonal 
abnormalities (excluding random loss) should also be recorded. 
 Karyotypes are to be designated according to the guidelines described in ISCN 2013, An 
International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (2013), LG Shaffer, J McGowan-
Jordan and M Schmid (eds); S. Karger, Basel, 2013. 
 
FLUORESCENCE IN SITU  HYBRIDIZATION (FISH)  
 F
ISH using commercially available probes will be required for the following cases A.) Normal B) 
Insufficient Quantity. C) Abnormal case with an 11q23 or 12p (see below). The laboratory is 
expected to follow the standards and guidelines for FISH put forth by [CONTACT_431489] o f 
Medical Genetics. If the laboratory is unable to perform FISH tests, contact [CONTACT_431490]. 
 
A) For all cases for which G-banding reveals a normal karyotype, FISH with RUNX1T1/RUNX1 , 
CBFB , or CBFB-MYH11 , PML- RARA and MLL  (probes must be performed to rule out a cryptic

Version Date: 02/22/2018   Page 89 
t(8;21), inv(16) or t(16;16), t(15;17) and 11q23 abnormality. FISH testing should be performed on 
1 day cultures (unstimulated sample).  
 
B) For all cases with failed cytogenetics, FISH with RUNX1T1/RUNX1 , CBFB or CBFB-MYH11 , 
PML- RARA, MLL,  7 (LSI, D7Z1/D7S486), and 5 (LSI, EGR1 /D5S23, D5S721). The threshold for 
a positive FISH finding for –7, -5/5q- will be >30%. If possible, morphologic and 
immunophenotypic data should be obtained as such data can be suggestive of a particular 
abnormality and thereby [CONTACT_431491].  
 
C) When G-banding reveals a known recurring chromosomal rearrangement, specifically one 
involving an t(8;21), inv(16)/t(16;16), or abnormal 11q23, FISH is recommended with a probe set 
targeting the involved loci ( ie, RUNX1T1/RUNX1,, CBFB or CBFB-MYH11 , MLL ) should be 
performed on metaphase or interphase cells to determine whether there is an associated deletion 
involving the regions 3’ or 5’ of the participating genes, and to establish the pattern that can be 
used to monitor this patient’s disease. When G-banding reveals an abnormality of 12p, FISH with 
a probe that can assess ETV6  status ( ETV6 breakapart or  ETV6 -RUNX1 ) in order to detect ETV6 
rearrangement or deletion.

CYTOGENETICS REVIEW  
The region’s cytogenetics coordinator will review each case when it is submitted. She/he will determine 
whether each case is adequate in terms of the numbers of metaphase cells analyzed, quality of banding, and 
interpretation of the karyotypes. If the coordinator agrees with the submitting laboratory, the results of the 
study will be entered into the appropriate Rave form. If the coordinator does not agree and the results are 
significant for patient stratification, she/he will send the case to another member of the COG Cytogenetics 
Review Committee for rapid review. If the coordinator does not agree with the submitting laboratory but 
the results are not significant for patient stratification, the case will be taken to the next central review 
session to be reviewed there. If the case is determined as not adequate it will be registered as unknown 
cytogenetics.

APPENDIX III: YOUTH INFORMATION SHEETS 
INFORMATION SHEET REGARDING RESEARCH STUDY 
(for children from 7 through 12 years of age) 
A treatment study of a new drug to treat children with leukemia that has not responded to 
treatment or has come back.  
 
1. W e have been talking with you about your illness, acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  Leukemia 
is a type of cancer that grows in the bone marrow. Bone marrow is the spongy tissue inside 
the 
bones of your body that make blood cells. Relapse means that the cancer has come back 
after treatment. You have received treatment for AML before.  We are asking you to take part 
in a research study because the AML has come back.  A research study is when doctors work 
together to try out new ways to help people who are sick. In this study we are trying to learn 
more about how to treat AML that has come back.  
 
2. Children who are part of this study will be given a new drug called CPX-351. Doctors want 
to see if this new treatment will make children with leukemia get better, with fewer heart 
problems later in life. You will also get other drugs used to treat AML. We do not know how 
well the new drug will work in children, teens and young adults. That is why we are doing 
this study.  
 
3. S ometimes good things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These good 
things are called “benefits.” We hope that a benefit to you of being part of this study is your 
cancer will go away. We also hope that the study treatment will help keep more children from 
having heart problems later in life. However, we don’t know for sure if there is any benefit of 
being part of this study. 
 
4. S ometimes bad things can happen to people when they are in a research study.  These bad 
things are called “risks.” One risk to you is that the study treatment may not work as well as 
other treatments to get rid of the cancer for as long as possible. Another risk may be more 
problems, or side effects, from the study treatment. Other things may happen to you that we 
don’t yet know about. 
 
5. Your  family can choose to be part of this study or not. Your family can also decide to stop 
being in this study at any time once you start. There may be other treatments for your illness 
that your doctor can tell you about. Make sure to ask your doctors any questions that you 
have. 
 
6. We are asking your permission to collect extra blood. Doctors want to learn more about how 
children’s bodies handle the new drug you will receive. Doctors also want to see if there are 
ways to tell how your heart is affected by [CONTACT_8235]. Most of these samples would be taken 
when other standard blood tests are being performed, but there may be a few extra needle 
sticks. You can still take part in this study even if you don't allow us to collect the extra blood 
samples for research.

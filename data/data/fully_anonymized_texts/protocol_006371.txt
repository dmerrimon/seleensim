function of tobacco user type.  
 
2.2 State the hypotheses to be tested :  
The primary hypotheses are: 1) purchasing of NVPs, HTPs, and NPPs will increase as the 
price of conventional cigarettes is increased (i.e., they will all serve as substitutes), 2) the 
effect will be largest when those alternativ e products are at a reduced price, and 3) dual 
cigarette/NVP users, because they are multi -tobacco users, will show greater substitution 
than exclusive cigarette smokers.  
3.0 Background  
3.1 Summarize the relevant prior research on  this topic and gaps in curren t 
knowledge within the field of study : 
 
Cigarettes have long been the dominant tobacco product, and the vast majority of  the 
tobacco -related harm comes from their combustion.[1] In recent years, alternative 
nicotine delivery systems have developed. These products deliver nicotine without 
combusting tobacco and are marketed as alternative products for addicted smokers.[2] In  
the previous funding period, we focused on the emergence of NVPs. In this project, we 
add two additional product classes: HTPs and NPPs.  
HTPs (sometimes called Heat Not Burn) are different from NVPs. HTPs heat 
reconstituted tobacco (tobacco not present wi thin NVPs) at a temperature below the one 
required for combustion. Because the tobacco is not burned, exposure to harmful 
chemicals generated by [CONTACT_847216].[3] The 
prevalence of HTP use in 2020 among current smokers and  recent ex -smokers is 
estimated to be 2.7% in the US. [4] In Tokyo, where it has had the greatest success, IQOS 
captured 2.4% of the market share for tobacco, with >50% of smokers who tried the 
product switching entirely from cigarettes.[5] The limited dat a available on HTPS 
suggest that they are likely to serve as a substitute for conventional cigarettes.[6]Their 
role for dual cigarette/NVP users is unknown.  
NPPs contain nicotine, but no tobacco,[7] and as a result, may present reduced harm 
compared to com bustible and non -combustible tobacco products, such as smokeless 
tobacco and snus. A recent pharmacokinetic study showed that the two highest doses of 
NPP (Zyn) deliver nicotine quickly and at levels similar to traditional smokeless tobacco 
products.[8] In  2020, the prevalence of NPP use among current smokers and ex -smokers 
was estimated to be 0.7% in the US. [4] The most recent Nielsen data show that sales 
from these products are sharply on the rise. However, given that NPPs are oral nicotine 
products, rat her than inhaled products like NVPs and HTPs, whether NPPs would 
effectively substitute for cigarettes or NVPs among cigarette smokers or dual users is 
unknown. Further, the strength of substitution for NPPs relative to NVPs and HTPs is 
unknown. Thus, util ization of NPPs in the ETM may provide data about substitutability 
that is prescient for understanding the implications of these products for tobacco control.

3.2 Describe any relevant preliminary data : 
 
The Experimental Tobacco Marketplace (ETM) [ 1], a novel method recently developed , 
permit s estimates of the effects of new policies and products on consumption and 
substitution in the tobacco marketplace. This method ology  places the mix of products, 
prices, and specific policies under experimental control so as to provide estimates of 
novel policies obtained under conditions that simulate “real world” circumstances. This 
approach  provide s insight into how a given poli cy may alter consumption, preferences, 
and substitution among tobacco products.  Different policies have been examined with 
this methodology in adult smokers, as part of th e previous funding period. Study [ADDRESS_1178029] of e -liquid nicotine strength and showed that the substitutability 
between cigarettes and NVPs increased as a function of e -liquid strength. The 24mg/mL 
strength resulted in the greatest substitutability   (p<0.001; f=1.05). [2] Study 2 examined 
cigarette taxes and e -liquid subsidies. It showed that cigarette taxes decreased cigarette 
purchases (p=0.005; f=0.45). [3] Interestingly, e -liquid subsidies had no effects on 
cigarette purchas es, but increased e -liquid purchases (p=0.013; f=0.44). Study 3 used a 
hypothetical ETM and replicated the taxes and subsidies conditions from Study 2 among 
exclusive cigarette smokers and dual cigarette/NVP users in an international context as 
part of the  ITC survey. Analysis of country -specific differences have yet to be explored, 
however, the US cohort replicates the findings of the lab -based ETM. Note, the effects of

VT Research Protocol version 1.0. 1 Page 7 of 38 Revised: March  5, [ADDRESS_1178030] of 
national and state taxes. [4] This replication provides an example of reverse translational 
research demonstrating that  the ETM can reflect effects observed in larger 
populations. [5] Study [ADDRESS_1178031] 
increased e -liquid purchase on average (p<0.001; f=0.56), but nicotine concentration had 
no effect on e -liquid demand intensity. Cigarette demand was unaltered across 
conditions. [6] This study suggests that allowing NVP use in the workplace may increase 
the demand for e -liquid without affecting purchases of conventional cigarettes.  
Collectively, and importantly for the proposed study , our ETM work shows that the 
substitution between products is dependent upon several factors (nicotine strength, price 
of the substitutable product, and the type and number of products in the marketplace).  In 
these studies, we change the price as an expeditious, effective, and quantif iable method to 
promote change. With that change, we can ascertain the likelihood that smokers will 
defend their consumption or substitute it for another product. In doing so, we can 
estimate the consequences of a policy constraint before implementation.

5.2 Describe corresponding data analysis plan/approach (e.g., content analysis 
of focus group transcripts ; descriptive analysis followed by [CONTACT_40190] ; nonparametric analysis of pre - and po st-test 
measures) : 
 
A within -between subject analysis of variance (ANOVA) will test for differences in 
substitution and demand measures between user types (exclusive cigarette smokers and 
dual cigarette/NVP users) and relative price scenario (e.g., ½ mar ket price for HTPs). We 
will test for the interaction between the relative price scenarios and each user type, 
suggesting a difference in how each user type responds to price scenarios. Order effects 
will be included in all models to account for the balanc ed Latin square design for 
counterbalancing the ETM conditions within the session. We will perform post -hoc 
contrasts to compare user types, based on our hypotheses.  
 
Additional analys es might be conducted.

consent procedures and then provide a breath  to confirm recent levels of smoking.  
Participants will complete a timeline follow back (TLFB) to assess previous month recent 
smoking , and consumption of nicotine products , and to determine ETM budget. A survey 
will administer  demographics questions and nicotine/tobacco -related  assessments 
(Questionnaire on Smoking Urges-Brief, Heaviness of Smoking Index , Perceived Health 
Risk, Product Evaluation Scale, Intention to transition and/or quit, Tobacco awareness 
and Hypothetical Purchase Task  for a range of products ). At the end of the session, 
participants will experience a trial of the ETM  that will be used in the next session. For 
the NVP, HTP and NPP flavor assessment, p articipants will rank order flavors from a list 
of available flavors and choose two flavors to try . During the in -laboratory flavor 
assessment, participants will be provided single -user/individual NVP and HTP device s. A 
research assistant will read through the manufacturer instructions on how to use the 
products with the participant. Sampling will occur in our negative air pressure ventilated 
smoking laboratory , specifically designed for these types of studies . The sm oking 
laboratory is a custom -built laboratory space in ARRC, which was approved as part of 
the opening of the Virginia Tech Carilion Institute. This laboratory is enclosed to 
minimize harm to other participants and laboratory personnel.  Participants may use the  
devices throughout the study and won't be asked to return them.  
If needed, the informed consent and initial assessment session and flavor assessment can 
be in different days.  
For the  sampling phase, participants will  be provided with the most prefer red flavor  of 
NVP, HTP and NPP  to sample during the sampling period.  Participants may also be 
provided with a sample of any other commercially available tobacco product they wish to 
examine and try.

For the five days foll owing the ETM session, participants will be asked not to use or 
purchase any outside tobacco/nicotine products and not to sell or give away any of their 
purchases.  
3) In the follow -up session, participants will  complete a timeline follow back to assess 
previous week  recent smoking, and consumption of nicotine products. A survey will 
administer nicotine/tobacco -related assessments (Perceived Health Risk, Product 
Evaluation Scale, and Hypothetical Purchase Task for  a range of products).  Session [ADDRESS_1178043] for

session in -lab will be considered for this procedure.  Approximately the next six 
exclusive smokers will be invited  to comp lete this procedure, which will help inform the 
most appropriate methods for future research.  
To collect breath sample, we will use the Icoquit , which is a single -user commercially 
available device. To collect  saliva , we will use the iScreen Sali va Nicotine Test, which is 
a single -use test also commercially availa ble. Procedur es will be conducted  following the

14.1 Indicate the total number of subjects to be enrolled  and how this number 
was determined (e.g., sample size calculation [show], number of available 
subjects in a finite pool, number of tests funding award would allow) :  
 
In this study , we require n=52 ( N=78 accounting for 33% attrition) participants to 
complete the study when using repeated measures with two groups and two 
measurements per participant.  
Our sample sizes are based on a repeated -measures within -between interact ion ANOVA 
design using medium effect size (f=0.25) and 80% power. Note the effect sizes observed 
in preliminary data ranged from f=0.29 to f=1.05. Given that the products used in these 
experiments are untested   (i.e., NPPs and HTPs), we conservatively sele cted a medium 
effect size of f=0.25. To account for multiple testing, we will control for five 
comparisons in each experiment; therefore, we use an alpha of 0.01.  
 
We have been successfully recruiting cigarette smokers and e -cigarette users in our 
community for the past 10 years. Based on our experience with prior studies, we 
anticipate that 33% of participants don't complete the study.

indicate  “No risk” or “N /A.” Instead, for studies with very low risk (e.g., 
anonymous online questionnaire on a mundane topic) indicate  “The 
investigators are not aware of any risks from participation in this study.” 
or “No more than risks than are found in everyday life.”  The example 
consent form presents a tabular method for risk information , which you 
can also use here . Common risk types include:  
● Physical (e.g., potential for pain, discomfort, infection)  
● Psychological (e.g., potential for stress, discomfort, and/or 
embarrassment)  
● Social (e.g., potential for discrimination or stigmatization and 
disruption of personal and family relationships)  
● Legal (e.g., potential for disclosure of illegal activity, negligence)  
● Privacy (e.g., potential for personal information being accessed, used, 
or disclosed without the subjects’ knowledge or consent, breach of 
confidentiality/security)  
● Economic (e.g., potential for individuals to lose access to economic 
services, employment, insurability)  
 
There will be no direct costs for participation, although there are risks.  
 
1. Possible embarrassment : This may result from answering questions that participant 
consider s sensitive. Some of our questions will ask for information about medical and 
psychiat ric conditions and/or drug use.  
 
2. Possible discomfort: There is also the possibility that participant  may become bored or 
frustrated during the research sessions.  
 
3. Loss of confidentiality : The research team will employ every effort to maintain 
partic ipant confidentiality, however the loss of confidentiality is a potential risk.  
 
4. Adverse effects associated with nicotine use: B ecause the present experiment allows 
and sometimes involves self -administering nicotine  products,  participants  might 
experien ce adverse effects associated with the use of such products (e.g., nausea, 
vomiting, dizziness, diarrhea, weakness, rapid heartbeat, minor increase in throat or sinus 
irritation) .  
 
5. Adverse effects associated with nicotine withdrawal : participants might experience 
adverse effects associated  with withdrawal from nicotine (e.g., dizziness, headache, 
irritability, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], decreased alertness, difficulty concentrating, impatience, 
sleeplessness, and increased eating).   
 
6. NVP/HTP/NPP  exposure : Participants  may not enjoy sampling the study products.

unknown . 
 
17.2  Indicate the measures you will use to minimize risks and monitor subjects 
for safety. (e.g., asking a subject at regular intervals to rate how they are 
feeling from 1 to 10, or to slowly crouch in order to check their balance.)  
 
Informed Consent. All co nsenting methods will be conducted using standard operating 
procedures, and all staff (including recruitment staff) will be provided with human 
subjects protection training. All participants will enroll on a voluntary basis and sign an 
IRB-approved consent  form prior to study participation.  
Protections against risk. Participants will be screened, using medical history and 
structured interviews for a history of medical contraindications (e.g., pregnancy, recent 
myocardial infarction) and current unstable med ical illnesses. Participants will be free to 
withdraw from the study at any time. In addition, if participants develop medical 
problems or experience adverse events during the course of the study, assessments to 
determine whether participants should contin ue in the study and/or continue to use study 
products will be conducted and necessary referrals will be provided. Participants will also 
be told that they can stop using the study products at any time.  
 
The risks enumerated above will be addressed by [CONTACT_716] : 
1. Possible embarrassment: Participants are free to refuse to answer questions and 
withdraw from the study at any time.  
 
2. Possible discomfort: Participants will able to selected a date and time of their choice to 
start the stu dy. They will also be given breaks  during sessions , if desired.  To increase 
data validity and reliability, breaks will be incorporated within the ETM session.  
 
3. Loss of confidentiality: The use of ID numbers for participants, and keepi[INVESTIGATOR_56568]

20.2 Describe steps that you will take  to make subjects feel at ease with the 
research situation in terms of the questions being asked and the 
procedures being performed. “At ease” does not refer to physical 
discomfort, but the sense of intrusiveness a subject might experience in 
response to q uestions, examinations, and procedures (e.g., use of a same 
gender investigator to place sensors on the torso , a private changing area 
if clothing must be changed, sensitivity when discussing  pregnancy test ing 
with subjects , making it clear o n surveys tha t participants  can discontinue 
at any time, not asking questions about private or sensitive issues unless 
necessary for the research ): 
 
The locations where this study will be conducted  have private offices , individualized 
computer testing and interview rooms. In cases in which private information is collected, 
the participant is in a private interview room with a trained research staff member. The 
lab is equipped with white -noise machines to reduce excess noise  and maintain 
confidentiality . All participants are informed that their information is confidential.

We do not expect any required reporting to occur as a result of our research questions and 
data collection methods. However, as a safeguard, w e include in  our consent form that 
any instances of child or elderly abuse or intent to harm self or others will be reported.  
Any cases of  disclosure or signs of sexual discrimination and/or sexual violence will be 
reported according to Title IX report procedures.   
 
 
 
21.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects  
Safety monitoring  is required  when research involves greater than minimal risk 
and is sometimes appropriate for other studies . 
21.1 Describe:  
● The plan to periodically evaluate the data collected regarding both 
harms and benefits to determine whether subjects remain safe  (e.g.,  
periodic reporting to the IRB , establishing a data monitoring 
committee , reporting data monitoring committee findings to the IRB 
and the sponsor ). 
● What data you will review, including safety data, unexpected  events, 
and data that show the ability to produce the intended results . 
● How the safety information will be collected (e. g., with case report 
forms, at study visits, by [CONTACT_40225] ). 
● The frequency of data collection, including when safety data 
collection starts.  
● Who will review the safety data and with what frequency . 
● The statistical tests for analyzing the  safety data to determine

04/18 /2016   V.4 Pulmonary Clearance Devices in ALS  Utilization of Pulmonary Clearance Devices in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis  
Background:  
ALS:  
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative neuromuscular disease with no known 
cause or cure. ALS causes weakness in many muscles in the body, including the muscles involved in 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_375942]. Weakness in these muscles ca n cause respi[INVESTIGATOR_66780], making 
breathing more difficult. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_375943]. Shortness of breath may be the first respi[INVESTIGATOR_375944]. Patients may n otice shortness of breath when engaged in vigorous physical activities like 
running, exercising, walking long distances, or climbing stairs. They may also have difficulty breathing at 
night which can interfere with sleep and cause fatigue or morning headac hes. Patients often find 
themselves  waking frequently throughout the night. Difficulty breathing at night occurs when the chest 
muscles relax too much to assist with breathing during the dreaming phase of sleep.  
Problems with swallowing can also interfere with breathing. When the swallowing muscles are 
weakened, food and saliva are more easily inhaled (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_3831]) into the windpi[INVESTIGATOR_375945]. 
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_375946], increasing the risk of respi[INVESTIGATOR_375947].  
High Frequency Chest Compression Devices (HFCC):  
Disease conditions, such as cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and immotile cilia 
syndrome, can lead to abnormal airway clearance which is a source of inc reased sputum production, 
often purulent or tenacious.   The underlying pathology of the decline in mucociliary clearance varies 
with the given disease.   Chest physical therapy (CPT), which is also referred to as percussion and 
postural drainage (P/PD), is the standard treatment program that attempts to compensate for abnormal 
airway clearance.  By [CONTACT_375973], which may often be tenacious, 
complications of infection, atelectasis, and hyperinflation are reduced, and the decline  in respi[INVESTIGATOR_375948].   Depending on the severity of the disease and any 
presence of infection, CPT sessions can be from [ADDRESS_470634] often associated a nd studied in the treatment of CF.  Of these techniques, daily P/PD 
and HFCC devices, such as the Vest™ Airway Clearance System  and Incourage Airway Clearance System , 
04/18 /[ADDRESS_470635] clearance system in 1998.   The currently approved indications 
are "To promote airway clearance or improve bronchial drainage by [CONTACT_375974]'s choice of treatment.  The 
indications typi[INVESTIGATOR_375949] (AARC) in 1991.  In addition, the device is also indicated for the purpose of collecting 
mucus for diagno stic evaluation."   Several earlier versions included the THAIRapy®Vest System and the 
ABI Vest®Airway Clearance System, amongst others (Advanced Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], Inc. St. Paul, MN). A similar 
device, the Medpulse Respi[INVESTIGATOR_375950] (Electromed, Inc., Minn etonka, MN) also obtained FDA 
clearance through the 510(k) approval process (1999), and others have also been cleared by [CONTACT_1622].  In 
2007, a similar device, the FREQUENCER™ (DYMEDSO, Inc., Boisbriand, Quebec Canada) obtained FDA 
clearance as substantially  equivalent to the THAIRapy device.   It produces sound wave stimulation to 
oscillate and loosen mucous secretions in the chest.  
Cough Assist:  
Normal clearance of airways rests on three (3) basic components: a patent airway, mucociliary 
clearance, and an adequate cough. Patients with spi[INVESTIGATOR_375951] a variety of neuromuscular 
diseases or chest wall deformities may have impaired cough responses, which may lead to respi[INVESTIGATOR_375952] t he profuse respi[INVESTIGATOR_171919]. 
Chest wall deformities may include kyphosis, scoliosis, or lordosis, while neuromuscular diseases include 
muscular dystrophy, poliomyelitis, spi[INVESTIGATOR_375953], myasthenia gravis, amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis, or cere bral palsy. The great majority of neuromuscular disease morbidity and mortality is 
related to respi[INVESTIGATOR_65208], and the vast majority of epi[INVESTIGATOR_375954]. Ches t infections may result in repeated 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_375955], repeated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and finally, in tracheostomy with mechanical 
ventilation.  The normal cough consists of 4 stages: 1) A precough inspi[INVESTIGATOR_375956] 85% of total lung 
capacity; 2) Followe d by [CONTACT_375975]; 3) Development of thoracoabdominal pressure sufficient 
04/18 /[ADDRESS_470636] at glottic opening; and 4) Opening of the glottis 
with exsufflation. The peak cough expi[INVESTIGATOR_375957] 5 L/sec, with total expi[INVESTIGATOR_375958] 2.3L. In general, an impaired ability to cough has been defined as a peak cough expi[INVESTIGATOR_375959] [ADDRESS_470637] been developed to enhance each of these 
stages. For exam ple, manually assisted coughing is designed to enhance exsufflation and consists of 
abdominal pressure delivered by a caregiver timed with the glottic opening. Manual assisted coughing 
may be offered to patients with a peak cough expi[INVESTIGATOR_375960] 5L/ sec, but is less effective in 
the presence of scoliosis or obesity or after meals. Glossopharyngeal breathing is a technique to 
increase inspi[INVESTIGATOR_375961] a decreased vital capacity due to 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_375962]. This breathing technique involves the use of the tongue and pharyngeal 
muscles to add to an inspi[INVESTIGATOR_375963] (gulpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) boluses of air past the glottis.  Mechanical 
insufflation -exsufflation is designed to deliver alternative cycles of  positive and negative pressure. One 
such device, the CoughAssist, is a portable electric device which utilizes a blower and valve to alternately 
apply a positive and then a negative pressure to a patient’s airway in order to assist the patient in 
clearing  retained broncho pulmonary  secretions. Air is delivered to and from the patient via a breathing  
circuit incorporating a flexible tube, a bacterial filter and either a facemask, a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_375964] a tracheostomy or endotracheal tube. Physicians,  respi[INVESTIGATOR_46175], nurses, and trained family 
members may administer this therapy. Mechanical insufflation (MI -E) has been used in a variety of 
patient populations as an adjunct to noninvasive  ventilation using intermittent  positive pulmonary 
ventila tion (IPPV) delivered nasally or orally. For example, many patients with neuromuscular disease or 
chest wall deformities with progressive ventilator failure will use noninvasive IPPV either nocturnally or 
throughout the day, depending on such parameters as  vital capacity and oxygenation levels. Patients 
managed at home with noninvasive IPPV may monitor oxygen desaturation levels. A sudden decrease in 
oxygen desaturation may prompt the use of MI -E to eliminate the presumed offending mucus plug. 
Advocates of MI-E state that even patients requiring [ADDRESS_470638] illness, or may be used on a 
more chron ic basis in an attempt to avoid the option of invasive tracheostomy and suctioning .

SYNOPSIS  
 
Name  [CONTACT_790]/Company:  
Radius Health,  Inc. (RADIUS)  
Name  [CONTACT_791]:  
Abaloparatide- solid  microstructured  transdermal  system  (sMTS)  (formerly  called  BA058) 
Name  [CONTACT_792]:  
Abaloparatide 
Protocol Number:  
BA058-05-022 Phase:  1b Country:  United  States  
Title  of Study:  
A Prospective, Single Arm Study to Evaluate the PK, PD and the Usability of Abaloparatide- sMTS in  
Postmenopausal Women with Low Bone Density  
Study  center(s):  Pharmaceutical  Research  Associates, Inc , Lenexa,  Kansas  
Objectives:  
Primary:  
• The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the ability of subjects to self- administer  
abaloparatide- sMTS  (300 µg) over a period of 29 days based on pharmacokinetics (PK) and 
pharmacodynamic (PD) markers.  
Secondary:  
• The secondary objective is to evaluate the usability of abaloparatide- sMTS as measured by  
[CONTACT_648774],  overall  subject acceptability,  preference,  satisfaction  and adherence 
to study therapy. 
• Other  secondary  objectives include an evaluation of overall  safety  and tolerability  of 
abaloparatide- sMTS  as assessed  by [CONTACT_648775] (TEAEs),  vital signs  
(orthostatic blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]), ECGs, 
laboratory tests (chemistry,  hematology, urinalyses)  and local tolerance.  
Study  Design  and Methodology:  
In this study, the effectiveness of subjects to self -administer 300 µg abaloparatide -sMTS once-daily on 
the thigh for 5 minutes for a period of 29 days will be assessed through PK and PD (bone biomarker) 
analyses. Before the start of treatment, subjects wi ll receive training on abaloparatide -sMTS application.  
During the study, the subjects will record their user experience, incidence of user errors; the subject and investigator will both assess local tolerance (symptoms [subject] and signs [investigator] of local skin 
reactions). On study visit days, subjects will self- administer abaloparatide -sMTS and will have blood 
samples drawn for PK and PD measurements, including an evaluation of subject preference parameters.  
The detailed  study design  will be as follo ws: 
Screening  Period  (Days - 67 to -8): 
The initial period  will be the Screening Period  where  clinical evaluations will be done from  Days  -67 to 
-8 which  includes  signing  of the informed  consent, medical  history,  comprehensive  physical  
Radius  Health,  Inc. Confidential  
Study  BA058 -05-022, Amendment  1, 18 March  2019  Page  10 of 62  
  
examination, measurement of vital signs, ECG, hematology, serum chemistry (including calcium,  
albumin, and phosphorus), coagulation tests, urinalysis, 25- hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin 
D, and serum pregnancy testing if needed. Urine will be collected for urinalysis and urine drug and 
alcohol screen. In addition, a [ADDRESS_869543] a recent (within 12 months) bone mineral density (BMD) scan, a scan will be performed to ensure the subject meets the BMD requirement. Note: Every effort will be made to enroll  
subjec ts with a T -score of -2.0 or lower but > -5.0; for those with scores higher than -2.0, preference 
should be given to subjects with lower  BMD scores.  
Pre-Treatment  Period  (Days -7 to -1): 
Based  on screening  evaluations,  eligible  subjects will enter  a 1-week  pre-treatment  period where  vitamin  
D and calcium supplementation will be initiated.  
Treatment Period,  Day  1: 
Subjects will be admitted to the clinical research facility on Day 1 of the treatment period. Subjects who continue to meet the study criteria will undergo a symptom- directed physical exam and assessments of 
vital signs, ECG, updated medical history including concomitant medications, and review of any adverse 
events (AEs). Other predose assessments include: blood collections for PK, hema tology, serum  
chemistry (including calcium, albumin, and phosphorus), coagulation tests, urinalysis, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and baseline measurements of s -PI[INVESTIGATOR_680]. Urine will be collected for urinalysis  
and for drug and alcohol testing. The application site will be prepared and cleaned, and predose  
assessment of  the application  site will  be done by [CONTACT_648776].  
Immediately before initial dosing (Day 1), the subject will be trained in abaloparatide -sMTS application  
and instructed how to perform a self- assessment of symptoms of local skin reaction of the application 
site. After the training, the subject will assess the application site for symptoms of local skin reactions prior to application of abaloparatide-sMTS and will the n self -administer the study drug. A subject diary 
will be provided for recording of user errors in abaloparatide-sMTS application, patch adhesion, and 
assessment of  local  tolerance (symptoms of local  skin  reactions).  
Self-assessments of symptoms of local skin reaction will be performed by [CONTACT_423] [ADDRESS_869544] this assessment of symptoms of local skin  
reactions, user errors, and an assessment of patch adhesion, beginning Day 1 until Day 29 or end of 
treatment (EOT)  visit.  
Investigators will perform an assessment of signs of local skin reaction on the application site prior to abaloparatide-sMTS application, 5 minutes after application (ie, immediately upon removal of 
abaloparatide- sMTS),  and [ADDRESS_869545] diary entries as outlined  
above. 
Treatment Period,  Day  15 and Day  29/EOT:  
On Days [ADDRESS_869546] will be readmitted to the clinical research facility. A review of AEs and 
concomitant medications will be conducted and predose assessments will include: symptom -directed  
physical exam, vital sign measurements, ECG, blood collections for PK, hematology, serum chemistry 
(including calcium, albumin, and phosphorus), coagulation tests, urinalysis, cAMP, and s- PI[INVESTIGATOR_680].  
Following completion of the predose assessments, the subject will self-administer the product. Used 
abaloparatide- sMTS  and swab for residual drug and swab residuals will be  collected.  
Symptoms of local skin reaction will be assessed by [CONTACT_423] (prior to application of abaloparatide sMTS, 5 minutes after application (ie , immediately upon removal of abaloparatide -sMTS), and 1 hour 
after abaloparatide- sMTS application) and recorded in the subject diary. The subject will also assess 
patch adhesion and user errors. Subjects will also complete user experience assessments incl uding: 
treatment satisfaction questionnaire for medication short form (TSQM9) Global Satisfaction and  
convenience domains; 5-point Likert- like scale of acceptability; and subject preference for treatment  
attributes.  
The study staff will review the prior entries in the diary and provide additional training on how to 
complete the diary, as needed. In addition, the study staff will conduct an investigator assessment of 
signs  of local  skin reactions.  
Post application assessments will include blood draws for cAM P, serum calcium, albumin, and 
phosphorus urinalysis. PK measurements will be assessed [ADDRESS_869547]  diary. 
Follow -up Visit  (Day  36) 
A follow up visit  7-days following Visit  5/EOT  can be done either  in clinic  or remotely  via a phone 
follow up. Assessment  of local  tolerance will be  conducted for subjects  with  ongoing signs  or symptoms  
of local  skin reactions  and a review of  AEs and  concomitant  medications will  be done.  
Number  of subjects (planned):  
Approximately 22 subjects will be enrolled and treated to ensure a minimum of 18 subjects complete the 29-day treatment and study procedures. Note: Every effort will be made to enroll subjects with a T- score 
of -2.0 or lower but > - 5.0; for those with scores higher than - 2.0, preference should be given to subjects  
with lower  BMD scores.

N/A 
Criteria  for evaluation: 
Pharmacokinetics/  Pharmacodynamics:  
Pharmacokinetics Measurements:  
Individual plasma concentrations of abaloparatide will be tabulated by [CONTACT_648779]. Individual and summary profiles will also be plotted. The plasma concentration -time profiles of abaloparatide will be analyzed using non-compartmental methods, and 
calculations will be made using the actual time since dose. Data permitting, the PK parameters 
maximum plasma concentration (C
max), time of maximum observed plasma concentration (t max), area  
under the plasma concentration-t ime curve (AUC0 -t), area under the curve extrapolated to infinity 
(AUC0 -inf), elimination rate constant (λz), and half -life (t1/2) will be derived. Derived PK parameters  
will be listed and summarized by [CONTACT_765]. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation [SD], coefficient  
of variation [CV%], minimum, median, maximum, geometric mean, and geometric CV%) will be 
provided by [CONTACT_765] (Day  1, Day 15, and Day 29). 
Pharmacodynamic Measurements:  
Measurements  of s-PI[INVESTIGATOR_648755].  Changes and percent changes  
from baseline, as well as ratio of post -baseline value over baseline value, will be summarized  
descriptively with 90% confidence interval by [CONTACT_765]. Individual and summary profiles will also be plotted. 
The actual values, change from baseline values, and the percentage change from baseline values for  
serum  calcium  (albumin -corrected),  serum  phosphorus, and cAMP  will be summarized  using descriptive 
statistics  by [CONTACT_648780]. 
User experience  measurements:  
User  errors  and user preference data will  be tabulated  and summarized  descriptively.  
For the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication – Short Form (TSQM -9), only the global 
satisfaction and convenience domains will be assessed. The mean TSQM- 9 score (±standard error [SE])  
for each  domain  will be tabulated  for Day  15 and Day  29 for the subjects who complete the  study. 
The mean  (±SE)  of the subject  acceptability  score  will be tabulated for  Days  1, 15, and 29. 
Pending data availability, the association between subject preference for treatment attributes and  
subsequent  acceptability  and satisfaction  will be evaluated  separate  for outcome  (effectiveness/safety)  
and other  attributes  (duration, frequency of use,  mode of  intake). 
Safety: 
All safet y analyses  will be conducted using the  Safety Population and will be descriptive  in nature. 
Study drug exposure and study drug compliance will be calculated. The duration of study drug exposure, 
total dose received  and percent compliance will be summarized.  
Medical history, physical examination, demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized 
and presented. Medical history will be presented by [CONTACT_14340], 
summarizing the proportion of subjects who have a condition noted. Results from the baseline physical 
examination will  be summarized by [CONTACT_648781].

 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Background  
Human parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a naturally occurring 84 amino acid hormone and is 
primarily a regulator of calcium homeostasis ( Mannstadt 1999). PTH acts directly on bone to 
increase calcium  resorption, on the gastrointestinal system  to increase  calcium  absorption, and 
on the kidney to increase calcium reabsorption and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production. In turn, PTH levels are tightly regulated by [CONTACT_648782] D levels. When given intermittently at low doses, PTH has a well-documented anabolic effect on bone, and can increase bone mineral  density  (BMD) in a number of intact  animal  models and in osteoporotic 
patients  (Dempster  1993).  
Abaloparatide (marketed  as TYMLOS
® in the United  States  [US]) was approved for use on 28 
April 2017 in the US for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture. Abaloparatide is a novel, synthetic, 34 amino acid peptides designed to be a potent and selective activator of the PTH/PTH -related protein (PTHrP) type 1 receptor 
(PTHR
1) signaling pathway  with 41% homology to PTH[1 –34]) and 76% homology to human 
PTHrP[1 –34]. Abaloparatide is differentiated from PTH and PTHrP ligands based on its high 
affinity  and > 1,000- fold greater  selectivity  for the G protein-coupled (RG) vs the non-G 
protein-coupled (R0) conformation of PTHR 1 (Hattersley 2016). Differential PTHR 1-RG 
binding with abaloparatide results in potent and transient intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) 
signaling. In nonclinical studies, the transient PTHR [ADDRESS_869553] on bone resorption ( Makino 2015). Thus, 
abaloparatide was developed  with the expectation  that it would be effective  at increasing  BMD  
and reducing fracture in individuals with osteoporosis, but with a limited effect on bone 
resorption and a reduced  risk of hypercalcemia.  
TYMLOS  is supplied in a single- patient -use prefilled  pen that delivers  80 μg of abaloparatide 
as a subcutaneous (SC) injection  into the periumbilical region of the abdomen. Abaloparatide 
administered as a SC injection is referred to throughout this document as abaloparatide- SC. 
RADIUS, in collaboration with 3M, has developed a short wear time intradermal method of 
administration  for abaloparatide to provide an alternative  route of administration  that may be 
preferred  by [CONTACT_541270],  thus, reducing a barrier  for anabolic therapy. This is referred  to as 
the abaloparatide- solid  Microstructured  Transdermal  System  (abaloparatide- sMTS).  
Abaloparatide- sMTS  is a drug device combination product consisting of Abaloparatide:  ZnCl 2 
, HCl , coated onto the sMTS array and contained within the 
fol
lowing packaging  system:  
• The primary  packaging  components with a delivery  function includes: 
− An array  patch for adhering the drug formulation -coated  sMTS array  to the skin 
− An insert  that holds and protects  the coated array  patch and  inserts it into  an 
applicator  
• The primary  packaging  components with a protective function includes: 

Radius  Health,  Inc. Confidential  
Study  BA058 -05-022, Amendment  1, 18 March  2019  Page  17 of 62  
 − A pod that holds the insert  
− A lid heat  sealed to  the edges of the pod 
• The secondary  packaging  includes: 
− A desiccant  
− A foil  patch, heat  sealed, that contains  the sealed pod  and desiccant.  
The applicator is a spring powered device that, when pressed against the skin of the thigh, 
inserts  the drug formulation- coated  sMTS  array  tips into the dermis  at a predetermined  force.  In 
contrast to traditional transdermal delivery systems, the sMTS array penetrates the stratum corneum to deliver  the drug formulation  following a short wear  time (5 minutes).  
 
1.1.1. Disease  and Study  Drug  Background 
Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease characterized by [CONTACT_648783] (Rizzoli 2001). This disease is characterized by [CONTACT_648784]. The fractures associated with the greatest morbidity and mortality, as well as economic burden to society, together make up the clinically significant and medically relevant group termed major 
osteoporotic fractures. In the US, there are an estimated 2 million osteoporotic fractures annually ( Litwic 2014). The number of osteoporotic fractures is projected to increase in both 
men and women by [CONTACT_726] 3-fold over the next 50 years as a result of the aging population (WHO  2007 ). 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_648756] ( Suzuki 
2008). It has been reported that once a patient had sustained a vertebral fracture, the risk of a 
subsequent vertebral fracture increases by >300% and the risk of a subsequent hip fracture increased by 200% ( Black 1999). Additional studies have shown that almost half of the patients 
with a prior vertebral fracture will experience additional vertebral fractures w ithin [ADDRESS_869554] year ( Robinson 2002; Lindsay 2001). Those patients who sustained a vertebral 
body fragility fracture showed a prolonged course that can lead to significant disability even one 
year later ( Suzuki 2008). Patients with a d iagnosis of osteoporosis who have had any fracture 
have an 86% increase in their risk for another fracture ( Kanis 2004). With the severity of these 
implications, prevention of a secondary fracture has become a primary focus from a patient care 
and societal  standpoint. 
Major  osteoporotic fractures  (those of the wrist,  shoulder, hip and clinical  spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) account  for 94% 
of the fracture risk for women with low or minimal trauma ( Ensrud 2016 ). Major osteoporotic 
fractures contribute to accumulated frailty such that the Frailty Index is significantly larger in  
those elderly women who have experienced a major osteoporotic fracture. As a result, these 
women have worsening frailty and greater morbidity after a major osteoporotic fracture ( Li 
2015). The Frailty Index was associated with a predicted increase in the risk of falls, fractures,  
death and overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] ( Li 2014). Consequently, prevention of clinically significant 
and medically  relevant major  osteoporotic fractures will  reduce health care costs and benefit

 postmenopausal women due  to reduced  frailty,  reduced  risk of falls,  fractures,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_648757].  
Bone remodeling occurs through the action of osteoclasts, which are involved in the resorption 
of bone followed by [CONTACT_727]. In addition to continued use of calcium and vitamin D, the current therapeutic approach to the treatment of osteoporosis through inhibition  of bone resorption includes agents  such as bisphosphonates ( Rosen  2005
), or 
the monoclonal antibody denosumab, that inhibits the action of osteoclasts by [CONTACT_648785]-B ligand. An alternative approach has been to tip the balance between osteobla stic bone formation and osteoclastic resorption through the use of 
parathyroid hormone receptor  modulation using teriparatide  (rhPTH[1 –34]). 
Until recently, teriparatide has been the only approved osteoporosis treatment in which the major mode of action is stimulation of bone formation (anabolic) rather than suppression of bone resorption. The efficacy  of teriparatide  has important limitations  related  to its delayed  and 
modest effects on increasing BMD at the total hip and femoral neck; and decreasing BMD at  
the distal 1/3 radius. The increase in cortical porosity that can occur may result in maladaptive effects on cortical bone microarchitecture ( Bilezikian 2007
). Abaloparatide has been evaluated  
in a number of nonclinical and clinical studies for its potential as a novel treatment for  
osteoporosis. Based on the biology of the PTH [ADDRESS_869555].  
 
1.1.2. Study  Drug  Development  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Nonclinical Studies  
A comprehensive nonclinical program including dermal tolerance, dermal sensitization, and 
general toxicology studies have been conducted in multiple species (rat, guinea pig, rabbit, minipig and monkey) for abaloparatide-SC and is considered supportive for abaloparatide- sMTS.  
Additionally, dermal tolerance, dermal sensitization, and general toxicology studies with abaloparatide-sMTS are ongoing or planned. The findings from the completed studies support the conclusion that abaloparatide- sMTS is well tolerated, with no new significant safety risks  
identified as compared to abaloparatide-SC. Full details of the nonclinical development program for abaloparatide are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Studies  
There are 19 completed or ongoing clinical studies which comprise the abaloparatide- SC 
(subcutaneous) and the abaloparatide-sMTS (transdermal) clinical development programs. The 
abaloparatide- SC clinical  trial program consists  of 11 completed  clinical  trials,  including a large 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_53881]  3 study  (BA058-05-003) followed  by [CONTACT_3440]- label  extension  (BA058 -05-005). 
The abaloparatide- sMTS  clinical trial program consists of 4 completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 
studies, and an ongoing Phase 1 study (BA058- 05-015) to select an optimized formulation and 
dose for abaloparatide-sMTS to be used in the Phase  [ADDRESS_869556] recent  IB. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Abaloparatide- SC 
In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 study (BA058-05-003, the ACTIVE trial), 2,463 postmenopausal 
osteoporotic women were rand omized to receive daily 80 µg abaloparatide -SC (n=824), placebo  
(n=821), or teriparatide 20 µg (n=818) (rhPTH 1-34) for 18 months. In this trial, abaloparatide- SC and teriparatide significantly reduced the risk of new morphometric vertebral fractures, by 
86% and 80%, respectively, compared to placebo. Abaloparatide-SC significantly reduced nonvertebral, major osteoporotic and clinical fractures compared to placebo. Compared to teriparatide, abaloparatide significantly reduced major osteoporotic fractures. The Kaplan -Meier  
plots indicate an early and sustained fracture risk reduction of nonvertebral, major osteoporotic and clinical  fractures  with abaloparatide- SC treatment.  Abaloparatide- SC was generally  safe with 
acceptable tolerability in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis; the most common adverse reactions  (incidence ≥ 5%) were  hypercalciuria, dizziness,  nausea,  headache and palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814].  
Consistent with reduced abaloparatide- SC-mediated calcium mobilization, the rates of  
hypercalcemia  were  lower  in the abaloparatide- SC group compared  to the teriparatide  group. 
In the ACTIVExtend  trial (BA058-05-005), subjects who were in the abaloparatide- SC or 
placebo arms were transitioned to oral alendronate [ADDRESS_869557] 
statistically significant reductions in nonvertebral, major osteoporotic, and clinical fractures  
when  compared  to subjects who previously received  18 months of placebo  followed by 
6 months of alendronate.  These results  validate  the osteoporosis treatment  paradigm  of build 
(with an anabolic agent), and then maintain and consolidate gains (with an anti-resorptive agent).  
Abaloparatide-SC demonstrated an increase in BMD at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], total hip, femoral neck and ultradistal radius in osteoporosis subjects, consistent with the fracture risk reduction. The results from the ACTIVE trial a nd the first 6 months of the ACTIVExtend trial, together 
with the entire  data set from  the abaloparatide -SC development program, support the safety  and 
efficacy of abaloparatide -SC for the reduction of fractures in postmenopausal women with 
osteoporosis. 
In Study BA058-05-005, after 25 and 43 months of  treatment  (18 months abaloparatide,  
1-m
onth transition, followed by 6 or 24 months of alendronate, respectively), the reductions in 
new vertebral fracture for abaloparatide/alendronate vs placebo/alendronate -treated subjects  
show long-term vertebral fracture reduction of 90% after 25 months and 84% after [ADDRESS_869558] been no cases  of osteosarcoma,  osteonecrosis of the jaw or atypi[INVESTIGATOR_648758]-SC clinical development program. In non-clinical studies, a dose dependent incidence of osteosarcomas was seen in both male and female rats treated with  
abaloparatide- and in a positive control group treated with hPTH  (1-34).

Study  BA058 -05-022, Amendment  1, 18 March  2019  Page  20 of 62  
 Overall,  the clinical  results  of abaloparatide- SC-mediated  early  vertebral  and nonvertebral 
fracture risk reduction and increases in BMD are consistent with the known anabolic 
mechanism  of action,  changes in bone turnover markers  and nonclinical  results.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Abaloparatide- sMTS  
To date,  several  different  abaloparatide- sMTS  formulations have been  evaluated  in a total of 4 
Phase 1 studies and 1 Phase 2 study, including an abaloparatide- sMTS PBS formulation  
(abaloparatide phosphate buffered saline [PBS]) and an optimized formulation (abaloparatide 
ZnCl 2∙HCl).  
The abaloparatide-sMTS PBS formulation had similar abaloparatide C max but lower 
abaloparatide AUC than the abaloparatide- SC 80 µg reference treatment. This abaloparatide - 
sMTS formulation was evaluated in 3 completed Phase 1 studies in healthy postmenopausal 
women (BA058-05- 004, BA058-05-006 and BA058-05-008). An overview of the design of 
these studies is provided in Figure 1. These studies were conducted to evaluate the PK, safety,  
and local  tolerability  of different  doses of abaloparatide- sMTS  and to evaluate the impact  of the 
application  site and the duration of application  (wear  time)  on PK, safety,  and local  tolerability.  
A Phase 2, dose-range-finding study, Study BA058-05-007, was also conducted with the abaloparatide-sMTS PBS formulation to evaluate the PK, efficacy, and safety of 3 doses of  
abaloparatide- sMTS (50, 100, and 150 μg) compared to [ADDRESS_869559] an optimized formulation and dose for abaloparatide-sMTS to be used in the Phase 3 study. From the pharmacokinetic data in this clinical study, it was determined that abaloparatide -sMTS Formulation W- 1 (Abaloparatide:  
ZnCl2 , HCl ) 300 µg applied to the thigh for 5 minutes provides a 
single patch administration option with a similar PK profile (slow absorption with a similar  
time of maximum observed plasma concentration [t
max] and  AUC) to abaloparatide-SC 80 µg 
and is expected to produce similar pharmacodynamic effects on BMD as the marketed  
abaloparatide- SC 80 µg treatment in the clinical setting. Additionally, abaloparatide -sMTS  
Formulation W-1 300 µg applied to the thigh for 5 m inutes had an acceptable safety profile in  
the BA058-05-015 study. 
Full details of the results of clinical trials conducted with abaloparatide -SC and  
abaloparatide- sMTS  are provided in the IB. 
 
1.2. Study  Rationale  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the a bility of subjects to self -administer 300 µg 
abaloparatide- sMTS  over a period of 29 days based  on analyses  of pharmacokinetic (PK) and 
pharmacodynamic (PD) markers. The systemic exposure will be compared to historical  
exposure after treatment  with abaloparatide SC  as well  as results  from  BA058-05-015,

healthcare professional. 
 
1.3. Dose  Rationale  
The dose of 300 μg of abaloparatide -sMTS, applied to the thigh for 5 minutes, was chosen 
based  primarily  on the comparability  of its pharmacokinetic profile  to that of the  approved 
drug abaloparatide SC at 80 µg per day  as was demonstrated in study BA058-05-015.

Radius  Health,  Inc. Confidential  
Study  BA058 -05-022, Amendment  1, [ADDRESS_869568] be recorded in the source documents and on the case report form. All subjects withdrawn 
prior to completing the study should be encouraged to complete study procedures scheduled for the Visit 5 / end of treatment (EOT) (Day 29) visit as soon as possible. All AEs should be followed as described  in Section  7. Subjects  who discontinue or are withdrawn  from  the study 
will not be replaced. Whenever a subject is discontinued prematurely, the Sponsor and the Medical  Monitor must be notified. 
4.4. Concomitant  Medications  
Subjects will be provided with calcium and vitamin D supplements to be administered daily from  
the Pretreatment Period until the end of the Treatment Period. The supplement dose will be determined by [CONTACT_648789], according to the subject’s need to ensure that their daily intake of calcium and vitamin D is 1,200 mg/day and 800 IU/day, respectively. The doses and schedule of calcium and vitamin D supplements should be adhered  to and not be changed other than for medical  necessity.  The supplements should be taken  
as instructed by [CONTACT_737]. 
For any required concomitant medication, such as statins or antihypertensives, the subject must 
be on a stable  dose for [ADDRESS_869569] treatment visit (Day  1) and  every  effort should be 
made to maintain a stable  dose during study participation.  
The occasional use of over-the-counter medications at approved doses (eg, ibuprofen or 
acetaminophen) for headache or minor discomfort is allowed. These are to be recorded on the appropriate case report form. Subject s should not take any other medications, including over-the- 
counter medications, herbal medications, or mega-doses of vitamins during the study without the prior approval of the Investigator. 
If it becomes necessary for a subject to take any other medicat ion during the study, the specific 
medication(s) and indication(s) must be discussed with the Investigator. All concomitant

6.2.8. Visit  6/Follow up (Day  36) 
Visit 6/ Follow up (Day  36) can be completed  as a clinic  visit or  remotely  through a phone call 
by [CONTACT_5984]. The  following  are the study assessments for Visit 6: 
• Assessment of local tolerance post EOT visit for subjects with ongoing signs or 
symptoms of local skin reactions 
• AE and concomitant medication  review  
6.2.9. Unscheduled Visit  
If the subject returns to the clinic for an unscheduled visit (eg, to follow-up on an abnormal 
laboratory test),  the procedures performed  at this  visit will  be recorded in  the eCRF  and source 
documentation. 
6.3. Vital Signs  and Physical  Examinations 
A comprehensive physical examination  (review  of all body systems),  height, weight, and vital 
signs assessment will be  performed  at Screening. 
A comprehensive physical examination includes a review of the following systems: head/neck/thyroid, eyes/ears/nose/throat,  respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular,  lymph nodes, abdomen, 
skin, musculoskeletal, and neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be  
performed when medically indicated. After screening, any clinically significant abnormal findings in physical examinations should be reported as  AEs.  
Height and weight will be  measured  with  shoes off. Height is  to be measured  using a wall 
mounted stadiometer.  
Vital signs include orthostatic blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), temperature (oral), pulse rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]. These will be assessed following a [ADDRESS_869590] (seated or supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]). At visits when study drug is administered at the site, vital sign assessments will be collected before  
the dose of study drug and [ADDRESS_869591] copi[INVESTIGATOR_648767]; the first copy will be kept in  the subject’s medical  chart  and 
the second copy will be kept in the study file for retrospective collection by [CONTACT_1034], if necessary. Any abnormalities should be noted and clinical relevance should be documented. An ECG will be recorded immediately prior to dosing and at 1 hour after abaloparatide- sMTS  
application on Day 1 (Visit 3), Day 15 (Visit 4) and Day 29 (Visit 5). Additional ECGs may be performed  as clinically  indicated.  
6.5. Laboratory Evaluations  
6.5.1. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis will be collected at time points indicated in the  
SOA in Table [ADDRESS_869592] the following safety laboratory results reported within 30 days prior to Day 1 (Visit 3): hematology, serum chemistry (including calcium and phosphorus), urinalysis, PTH (intact), 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D, and serum pregnancy. These laboratory tests must be repeated for subjects who were  screened more  than 30 days prior to  Day 1 (first day  of treatment).  
Subjects are required to fast for 8 hours prior to  any safety  laboratory assessments at Screening  
and on Days 1, 15 and 29. Subjects are allowed to continue water consumption during these times.

Serum calcium, phosphorus and albumin will be measured predose from the standard chemistry 
panel on Day 1, Day [ADDRESS_869594](s) should be repeated and followed up until the results have returned to within the normal range or an adequate explanation for the abnormality is found. Clinically significant changes in laboratory tests that occur during the course of the study are to be reported as AEs unless included as part of a reported diagnosis (see Section  7). 
The clinical laboratory  will clearly  mark all laboratory  test values that are outside the normal 
range and  the Investigator will indicate  the clinical  relevance  of these out of range values.  
6.5.2. Serum  Markers  of Bone Metabolism  
Blood samples will be taken within 1 hour predose to measure serum procollagen type I N- terminal propeptide (s -PI[INVESTIGATOR_680]),  a marker of  bone formati on on Day 1 (Visit 3),  Day  15 (Visit 4) 
and Day  29 / EOT (Visit 5).

Subjects will have areal bone density measurements taken via DXA of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], total hip, femoral neck, at Screening. Lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_11293] L1 through L4. Hip scans will include the entire proximal femur to about [ADDRESS_869595] of evaluation  of signs ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) and symptoms 
(Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) of local  skin reactions. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Investigator assessment  of signs of local tolerance  
The investigator’s assessment of local tolerance will consist of evaluation of signs of local skin 
reactions,  which  must be performed by a physician or trained evaluator  at designated  study visits.  
During each clinic visit, as indicated in Table 1 , the application site will be evaluated prior to the 
application of abaloparatide-sMTS, 5 minutes after application (ie, immediately upon removal of 
abaloparatide- sMTS),  and 1 hour after abaloparatide- sMTS application . 
Investigators will assess each of the 12 signs of local  skin reaction  using a 4-point scale:  0-none, 
1-mild, 2 -moderate, 3 -severe. The 12 signs for local skin reactions are as follows: erythema, 
edema,  vesiculation, glazed appearance,  erosions, crusting, hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], 
hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371], scarring, atrophy, bruising, and bleeding. 
If severe local  skin reactions  occur,  investigators may  contact  [CONTACT_648800]. For any severe administration site reaction, the subject will be  instructed to continue evaluations 
of the application site at 24 hour intervals until the skin irritation has stabilized or resolved. Any 
ongoing treatment-emergent local skin reactions noted on Day 29 will continue to be assessed at 24 hour intervals unt il resolved or stabilized.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Subject  assessment  of symptoms  of local tolerance 
Study subjects will be instructed to perform a daily self -assessment of symptoms of local skin  
reaction. The application site will be evaluated prior to study drug administration, 5 minutes after application (ie, immediately upon removal of abaloparatide-sMTS), and 1 hour following abaloparatide- sMTS  application on the day of clinic visits, and between visits beginning Day 1 
up until the  scheduled Day  29 or EOT  visit.  
The 5 symptoms of pain, itching, burning, tenderness and swelling will be assessed using a 4- point scale: [ADDRESS_869596] the investigator for further instructions; local skin reactions may then be monitored by [CONTACT_588328]  [ADDRESS_869597] diary:  
0 = ≥ 90%  adhered (essentially  no lift off the  skin)  
1 = ≥ 75%  to < 90% adhered (some  edges only lifting  off the skin) 
2 = ≥ 50% to <  75% adhered (less than half of the patch lifting  off the  skin) 
3 = > 0% to < 50% adhered but not detached (more  than half of the patch lifting  off skin without 
falling  off) 
4 = 0% adhered – patch detached  (patch completely  off the skin) 
 
6.6.5. Assessment  of Subject  Reported  Outcomes  
The proposed study will be the first to generate user experience data for abaloparatide in the context of a clinical study. Discontinuation rates are particularly high with available osteoporosis therapi[INVESTIGATOR_648770]. Abaloparatide will be the first osteoporosis treatment delivered  through a patch  and could have potential to  improve compliance. Previous studies have 
suggested that microneedle patches have a greater acceptabili ty when compared with the 
traditional intramuscular hypodermic injections ( Norman 2014) and may be ideal for subject 
adherence as they do not stimulate nerves that are associated with pain ( Ita 2015). The additional 
endpoint assessment will determine wheth er the abaloparatide -sMTS is well tolerated with  
minimal impact on  subject reported outcomes and improved adherence. 
Acceptability -Given the low acceptability of osteoporosis medications and subject perception of 
benefit/risk, an evaluation of acceptability will be carried out. There is currently no specific instrument with psychometric validation for “acceptability.” Studies including teriparatide have provided a single question “Is this medication acceptable to you.” ( Rouphael 2017). General  
acceptability  will be measured using a 5-point Likert- like scale. One being the least  
acceptable/negative experience to [ADDRESS_869598] acceptable/positive experience. Acceptability  
will be assessed after  abaloparatide- sMTS application  on Day  1, Day [ADDRESS_869599]:  
• “On a scale of 1 (least  acceptable/negative experience)  to 5 (most  acceptable/positive 
experience),  how would you rate this  treatment.” 
 
Subject preference of treatment attributes -While some subject reported outcomes may be 
treatment related, subjects’ preference regarding osteoporosis treatment is likely to impact their  
perception of the treatment and their behavior. As such subject preference and value for drug 
attributes  will be measured  after  abaloparatide -sMTS  application on Days  1, 15, and  29. The  data 
collected  will help identify which factors  may  affect  subjects’  perspectives  on risk/benefits. 
Further, which subject types may be more likely to find treatment acceptable based on value they place on vario us attributes.  
Question posed directly to the subject : 
• “Which  attributes of the treatment  do you find most favorable for you?” 
Radius  Health,  Inc. Confidential  
Study  BA058 -05-022, Amendment  1, 18 March  2019  Page  45 of 62  
  
• “Which  attributes of the treatment  do you find least favorable?” 
 
Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) -Treatment satisfaction will be  
measured  with the psychometrically  validated  treatment satisfaction  questionnaire for medication  
short form  (TSQM -9). TSQM  has been  previously used  in osteoporosis studies ( Palacios  2015) 
to assess satisfaction  in post-menopausal women  with osteoporosis ( POSSIBLE  US Study).  
TSQM is associated with discontinuation rates ( Bharmal 2009). The 9- item questionnaire  
contains 3 domains: effectiveness, convenience, and global satisfaction. While the side effect  
domain is  not included, any  unpleasant experiences  with a medication  are likely  to be captured in  
the TSQM global satisfaction items. As a result, the TSQM -9 allows for subjects to weigh the 
pros and cons of medication a nd the less favourable aspects of subjects’ experiences with their  
medications would be captured. The TSQM-[ADDRESS_869600]’s interests.  
The Investigator will be responsible for informing IRBs  of the early  termination  of the study.

7. ADVERSE EVENT AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT  
DOCUMENTATION  
 
7.1. Evaluation  of Safety  
Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analysis of safety information from clinical studies 
are crucial for the protection of subjects and is mandated by [CONTACT_648802]. All  
clinical studies sponsored by [CONTACT_648803] g of safety  information. 
All AEs are collected from the time of signing the informed consent until [ADDRESS_869602] dose of study treatment, the investigator may  report  any SAE  that he/she believes is  possibly related  to study treatment.  
Where possible, a diagnosis rather than a list of symptoms should be recorded. All AEs should be captured on the appropriate AE pages in the eCRF and in source documents. The Investigator 
will as sess the relationship of all AEs to  the study drug. 
7.1.1. Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatmen t. An AE can  therefore  be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational)  product, whether or not related to  the medicinal  (investigational)  product 
AEs could include: 
• Worsening (change in nature, severity,  or frequency) of conditions present  at the 
onset of the study 
• Intercurrent illnesses  
• Drug  interactions  
• Events related  to or possibly related  to concomitant medications  
• Clinically  significant abnormal laboratory values (this  includes significant shifts  from  
Baseline within the range of normal that the Investigator considers to be clinically important)  
• Clinically  significant abnormalities  in physical examination,  vital signs, and  weight 
An abnormal laboratory value will not be assessed as an  AE unless it requires a therapeutic 
intervention or is considered by [CONTACT_254116].  
When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment should be provided rather than the abnormal test  result  alone (eg,  urinary  tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, the 
Radius  Health,  Inc. Confidential  
Study  BA058 -05-022, Amendment  1, 18 March  2019  Page  47 of 62  
  
abnormal study assessment itself should be listed as the AE (eg, bacteria in urine or decreased  
hemoglobin). 
Determination  of clinical  significance must be made by [CONTACT_737].  
All skin reactions at the application site reported by [CONTACT_224092], expected or 
unexpected, and regardless of severity will be reported as AEs and should include reference to the application site. Events of ulcer, eschars, and non-healing wounds at the application site will be evaluated as an adverse event of special interest (Skin AESI). Skin AEs that occur at other  
locations of the body should be reported  as AEs  as appropriate but are  not to be recorded/entered  
using phrases such as ‘at the application site’, ‘involving the application site’, etc., to ensure the phrase ‘application site’  is used exclusively for the sites  of study drug administration.  
7.1.2. Serious  Adverse Event  (SAE) 
An SAE  is any  AE that  results in any of the following: 
• Death  
• Life-threatening: The  term “life -threatening” in the definition  of “serious” refers  to an 
event/reaction in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the  
event/reaction; it does not refer to an event/reaction which hypothetically might have caused  death if it were  more  severe.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_869].  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (ie, substantial disruption of the ability  
to conduct normal life function). 
• Congenital anomaly/birth  defect.  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, are life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon approp riate medical  
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to  prevent one of the outcomes listed in  this definition. Examples  of such  
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an  
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in subject  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
All AEs of osteosarcoma will be reported  as SAEs.  
All treatment related AEs/SAEs noted on the follow-up visit must be followed until resolution 
(subject has returned to baseline status of health) or until stabilization (the Investigator does not expect  any further improvement or worsening of the reported event),  or until the subject is lost  to 
follow-up. 
7.1.3. Recording  an Adverse Event  
All AEs/SAEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in  response to an open question from  
study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination, or other diagnostic procedures  
must be recorded in  the source document and entered into the electronic database.  
Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_648771] a time  
Radius  Health,  Inc. Confidential  
Study  BA058 -05-022, Amendment  1, [ADDRESS_869603] determine  the intensity  of 
the event and the relationship of the event to study drug administration. Intensity for each AE 
will be defined according to the following criteria:  
 
Intensity  Definition  
 
Mild  Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated.  
 
Moderate  Discomfort  enough to cause  interference 
with normal daily  activities.  
 
Severe  Inability  to perform normal daily activities.  
 
If the intensity of an adverse event changes within a day, the maximum intensity should be recorded.  If the intensity  changes  over a longer period of time,  the changes  should be recorded as  
separate events (having separate onset and stop dates for each intensity).  
Relationship to study drug or device, defined as study drug administration will be determined by [CONTACT_25311]:  
 
Relationship  Definition  
 
None No relationship  between  the event  and the 
administration of study drug. The event is related to other etiologies, such as concomitant medications or subject’s clinical  state.  
 
Unlikely  The current  state  of knowledge indicates  that 
a relationship to study drug administration is unlikely or the temporal relationship is such that study drug administration would not have had any reasonable association  with the 
observed event.  
 
Possible A reaction  that follows a plausible temporal  
sequence from administration of the study drug and follows a known response pattern to the suspected study drug. The reaction might have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or other modes of therapy  
administered  to the subject.  
Radius  Health,  Inc. Confidential  
Study  BA058 -05-022, Amendment  1, [ADDRESS_869604]’s clinical state or other modes of therapy  
administered  to the subject.  
 
For the purpose of safety analyses, all AEs that are classified with a relationship to study 
medication  administration  of possible or probable will be considered  treatment -related events.  
The AE will be determined to be device-related if it is identified to have had a probable or 
possible causal relationship to the investigational device.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious  and Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects  for Abaloparatide- sMTS  
An adverse device effect is defined as any adverse event that may or may not be related to the  
investigational abaloparatide- sMTS  device and should be reported  as an AE (Section 7.1.1),  and 
includes AEs resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, deployment, implantation, installation, operation, malfunction, use error or from intentional misuse of the investigational medical device.  
An unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) is defined as any SAE on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, the abaloparatide- sMTS device,  
or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights,  
safety,  or welfare of subjects. 
The Investigator and the Sponsor will immediately conduct an evaluation of any UADE occurring with abaloparatide-sMTS. The results of the evaluation will be reported to the IRB within 10 days of the Investigator and/or the Sponsor becoming aware of the event. If it is determined by [CONTACT_648804],  all investigations or parts  of the investigation  presenting that risk  will be terminated  
as soon as possible. Termination will occur not later than [ADDRESS_869605]. In order  to fulfil  regulatory reporting  
obligations worldwide the investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of 
events  meeting  the definition of UADEs that  occur  with abaloparati de-sMTS  (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
Any UADEs that occur during the study with abaloparatide- sMTS  from the time  the participant  
signs the ICF  until [ADDRESS_869606] be reported to the Sponsor whether  or not they  result  in an AE/SAE.  In the event  
of an overdose the Investigator should contact [CONTACT_648805].  No specific treatment is 
recommended;  the investigator will use clinical judgment to treat any  overdose. 
7.1.8. R egulatory  Agency,  Institutional  Review  Board, and Site Reporting  
The sponsor and/or the clinical  contract  research  organization  are responsible for notifying the 
relevant  regulatory authorities/ IRBs of related,  unexpected SAEs.  
The investigator is  responsible for notifying the sponsor, CRO,  and local  IRB,  or the relevant  
local  regulatory authority of all SAEs that occur  at his or her site as required.  
7.2. Study  Completion  and Post-Study  Treatment  
The Investigator must provide follow- up medical care for all subjects who are prematurely  
withdrawn from the study due to a treatment- related adverse event or must refer them for  
appropriate ongoing care.  
Radius  Health,  Inc. Confidential  
Study  BA058 -05-022, Amendment  1, [ADDRESS_869607]  to Follow -up 
For subjects whose status is unclear because they  fail to appear  for study visits without stating  an 
intention to discontinue or withdraw, the Investigator should show “due diligence” by 
[CONTACT_762], eg, dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc. A subject should not be formally considered lost to follow-up until his scheduled  Visit 6/follow -up visit would have occurred.

8. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1. Statistical  and Analytical  Plans  
A comprehensive Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)  and a Pharmacometric  Analysis Plan  will be 
completed  and approved prior to database lock. 
 
8.2. Statistical  Hypotheses 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the ability of subjects to self- administer 30 0 µg 
abaloparatide sMTS over a period of 29 days based on pharmacokinetic (PK) and 
pharmacodynamic (PD)  markers.  
No formal statistical tests will be  conducted for any of the study endpoints. 
 
8.3. Analysis Datasets  
8.3.1. Population for Analysis 
The primary  population for all safety analyses will be the Safety  Population, which will be 
defined  as all subjects who received  at least  1 dose of study medication.  
The primary  population for PK  analyses  will be  the Pharmacokinetic (PK) Analysis  Population, 
which wil l include all subjects in the Safety Population who have sufficient evaluable plasma 
concentrations to reliably  estimate  [ADDRESS_869608] deviation (SD), minimum, interquartile range (Q1 and Q3), and maximum will 
be presented, unless otherwise specified. 
 
8.4.2. Analysis of the Primary  Endpoint  
The primary  population for the analysis of the PK parameters will be the  PK Analysis  
Population. 
Individual plasma concentrations of abaloparatide will be listed and summarized by [CONTACT_648806]. Concentration data will be summarized at each nominal time point with the  
following descriptive statistics: number of subjects, mean, SD, coefficient of variation (CV%),  
median, minimum, and maximum. Individual plasma concentrations will be plotted vs nominal sampling time on linear -linear and log-linear scales by [CONTACT_765]. Spaghetti plots of abaloparatide 
plasma  concentrations will also be prepared.  
Radius  Health,  Inc. Confidential  
Study  BA058 -05-022, Amendment  1, 18 March  2019  Page  53 of 62  
  
The following PK parameters  will be  derived: 
 
Parameters  Description  
AUC 0-t Area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time zero to the  
time of the last quantifiable concentration  
AUC 0-inf Area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time zero to  
infinity  
Cmax Maximum observed plasma  concentration 
tmax Time  of maximum observed plasma  concentration  
t1/2 Apparent terminal phase half -life 
λz Elimination  rate constant 
 
All plasma PK parameter calculations will be performed using actual time (or nominal time,  
when  actual time  is not available)  calculated relative to the time of  study drug administration.  PK 
parameters will be determined using non-compartmental methods based on individual plasma 
concentration -time data for abaloparatide. Individual plasma PK parameters will be listed and  
summarized by [CONTACT_765]. PK parameters will be summarized with the following descriptive statistics: number of subjects, mean, SD, CV%, median, minimum, maximum, geometric mean (Geo Mean),  and coefficient  of variation of the geometric mean (Geo Mean  CV%).  
Comparisons between the abaloparatide PK parameter values  on Day 15 and on Day 29 vs Day 1 
(based on natural log (ln) -transformed AUC
0-inf, AUC 0-t, and C max) will be conducted. Point 
estimates and 90% CIs for the difference in PK parameter values between visits will be obtained.  
Further details will be  described in the Pharmacometric Analysis Plan. 
 
8.4.3. Analysis of Secondary  Endpoints  
The primary  population for the analysis of the secondary endpoints will be  the Safety  Population, 
unless otherwise specified.  
Pharmacodynamic endpoints 
The change from  baseline,  percentage change from  baseline and ratio  of post- baseline value to  
baseline value in  s-PI[INVESTIGATOR_648772],  together with  the 90% CI. 
The actual values change from baseline values, and the percentage change from baseline values  
for serum calcium (albumin -corrected), serum phosphorus, and cAMP will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics by  [CONTACT_648807].  
Local  Tolerance  
Local tolerance is defined as the assessment of signs (investigator) or symptoms (subject) of local  skin reactions.  For the investigator assessment  of signs of local  skin reactions,  the number 
(%) of subjects in each response category of the 4-point scale will be provided per visit and timepoint. The maximum severity of reaction scores will be similarly summarized for each

9. ADMINISTRATIVE  REQUIREMENTS  
9.1. Ethical Considerations  
This clinical study will be conducted in accordance with the current version of International 
Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP),  with  applicable local  laws  and regulations, and with  the ethical  principles laid  
down in the Declaration  of Helsinki. 
The Investigator will e nsure that this  study is conducted in full conformity  with Regulations for 
the Protection of Human Subjects of Research codified in [ADDRESS_869611] the rights, safety, and well-being of the subjects. The study will only  be conducted at sites  where IRB  approval has 
been  obtained. The  protocol, IB, ICF,  advertisements  (if applicable), written  information  given to 
the subjects,  safety  updates, annual progress reports, and any revisions to these  documents will 
be provided to the IRB by [CONTACT_648813], as allowable by [CONTACT_769]. 
 
9.2. Subject  Information  and Informed  Consent  
The Investigator is  responsible for obtaining written,  informed  consent from  each subject  
interested in  participating in this study  before  conducting any study- related  procedures. 
Written  informed  consent  should be obtained after adequate,  thorough, and  clear  explanation  of 
the study objectives, procedures, as well as the potential hazards of the study. The method of 
obtaining and documenting the informed consent and the contents of the consent will comply with ICH GCP and all applicable laws and regulations and will be subject to approval by [CONTACT_648814]. 
9.3. Investigator  Compliance  
No modifications to the protocol should be made except where the modification is  necessary  to 
eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to human  subjects. RADIUS will submit all protocol 
modifications  as amendments to the required regulatory authorities.  
When circumstances require an immediate departure from procedures set forth in the protocol,  
the Investigator will contact  [CONTACT_771].  If possible, contact  
[CONTACT_648815].  Any departures  from  protocol must 
be fully  documented in the source documentation. 
9.4. Access  to Records  
The Investigator must make the office and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_648773], audit by [CONTACT_648816]. The records must also be available for inspection, 
verification, and copying, as required by [CONTACT_774], by [CONTACT_648817]  (Food and  Drug  Administration  and others).  The Investigator  must 
Radius  Health,  Inc. Confidential  
Study  BA058 -05-022, Amendment  1, [ADDRESS_869612]. As required 
by [CONTACT_17926], the Investigator will allow RADIUS and/or its representatives access to  
all pertinent medical records to allow for the verification of data gathered in the eCRFs/SAE  
Forms/source data documents and the review of the data collection process. The Food and Drug Administration (or other regulatory authority) may also request access to all study records, including source documentation, for inspection. 
As applicable, in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA) and associated privacy regulations, a subject authorization to use personally identifiable  health  information may  be required  from  each subject  before  research  activities  
begin. 
Subject confidenti ality is strictly held in trust by [CONTACT_778], their staff, and  
RADIUS  and their  representatives. This  confidentiality  is extended  to cover  testing  of biological 
samples  and genetic tests in  addition to the clinical  information relatin g to study subjects.  
Therefore, the study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be 
held in strict confidence. No information concerning the study or the data will be released to any 
unauthorized third party without prior written  approval of RADIUS. 
9.6. Research  Use of Stored  Human  Samples,  Specimens,  or Data  
With  the subject’s  approval, and  as approved by [CONTACT_779]’s IRB,  biological samples  may be stored  
at a centralized facility determined by [CONTACT_780]. These samples could be used for retrospective 
biomarker research or analysis of clinical response to therapy and to improve current and future 
treatment outcomes. The storage facility  will maintain the masking  of the identity  of the subject.  
During the conduct of the study, any individual subject can  choose to withdraw  consent to have 
biological specimens stored for future research. When the study is completed, access to study 
data and/or samples will be provided through RADIUS.  
 
9.7. Data  Quality Assurance  
RADIUS or its de signated representative will conduct a study site visit to verify the  
qualifications  of each  Investigator, inspect  clinical  study site facilities  as needed, and  inform  the 
Investigator of responsibilities and procedures for ensuring adequate and correct study documentation. 
The Investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories  
designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the study for each study subject. 
Study data for each enrolled subject will be entered into an eCRF by [CONTACT_781] a secure, validated web -based electronic data capture (EDC) application. RADIUS will have read - 
only access to all data upon entry in the EDC application. Study assessment data generated by [CONTACT_648818] 3
rd party vendors will be obtained via external data transfers (outside the EDC 
application) and  reconciled  against  confirmatory  data contained  in the EDC  system  by [CONTACT_780]’  
Radius  Health,  Inc. Confidential  
Study  BA058 -05-022, Amendment  1, 18 March  2019  Page  59 of 62  
  
designee. External data will be incorporated into Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) datasets  
by [CONTACT_780]’ designee for RADIUS’ use.  
Instances  of missing,  discrepant,  or uninterpretable data will be queried  with  the Investigator for 
resolution. Any changes to study eCRF data will be made in the eCRF and documented in an 
audit trail, which will be maintained within the clinical database. Changes to external data will be handled exclusively by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_869613] a regulatory inspection of this study. Such audits/inspections can occur at any time during or after completion of the study. If an 
audit or inspection occurs, the Investigator and institution agree to allow the auditor/inspector 
direct access to all relevant documents and to allocate his/her time and the time of his/her staff to  
the auditor/inspector to discuss findings and any relevant issues. In the case of an audit or inspection, the Investigator or a delegate will alert RADIUS, as soon as he/she becomes aware of  
the audit or inspection. 
The Investigator and study staff are responsible for maintaining a comprehensive and accurate 
filing system of all study -related documentation that will be suitable for inspection at any time  
by [CONTACT_780],  its designees, and/or regulatory agencies. In  signing this protocol, the Investigator 
understands and  agrees to give access to the necessary  documentation and files.  
 
9.8. Monitoring  
RADIUS is responsible for ensuring the proper conduct of the study with regard to protocol adherence and validity  of data recorded in the clinical database. The study will be  monitored by 
[CONTACT_770]. Monitoring will be done by [CONTACT_648819] f rom a representative of  
RADIUS, or designee (site monitor), who will review the eCRFs, SAE Forms and source documents. The site monitor will ensure that the investigation is conducted according to the protocol design and regulatory requirements.  
 
9.9. Data  Collection  and Management  Responsibilities  
Data collection is  the responsibility  of the clinical  study staff at the  site under the supervision of 
the Investigator. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, 
legibility,  attributability,  and timeliness  of the data reported.  
RADIUS or its designee will provide the study sites with secure access to and training on the EDC application sufficient to permit site personnel to enter and correct information in the eCRFs  
on the subject for which they are responsible.  
An eCRF will be completed for each subject who receives at least 1 dose of study drug. Nominal 
data, limited to demographics and the reason for screen failure, will be collected for all subjects who sign an ICF but are not randomized, although additional data will be collected if a screen failure experiences an adverse event during while being screened. It is the Investigator's responsibility to ensure the accuracy, completeness, clarity, attributability, and timeline ss of the 
data reported in the subject’s eCRF. Source documentation supporting the eCRF data should indicate the subject’s participation in the study and should document the dates and details of study procedures, AEs, other observations, and subject status. 
Radius  Health,  Inc. Confidential  
Study  BA058 -05-022, Amendment  1, 18 March  2019  Page  60 of 62  
  
The Investigator, or designated  representative, should complete  the eCRF in  a timely  manner  
after information is collected.  
The audit trail entry will show the user's identification information, the date and time of log in, 
the date and ti me of data entry and/or any change or correction to previously entered data, as 
well as the reason  for any  data change. The Investigator must provide formal  approval of all the  
information in the eCRFs, including any changes made to the eCRFs, to endorse the final  
submitted  data for the subjects  for whom the Investigator is responsible. 
RADIUS will retain the eCRF data, queries and corresponding audit trail. A copy of the final archival  eCRF  in the form of a compact  disc or other electronic media  will be provided to the site  
for placement in the  Investigator's study file. 
 
9.10. Study  Records  Retention 
The Investigator will maintain  study documents for  a minimum of [ADDRESS_869614] be notified. No records will be destroyed  without the written consent of RADIUS. 
 
9.11. Publication  and Data  Sharing  Policy  
Publication of complete data from the study is planned. It is anticipated that the results of this 
study will be presented at scientific meetings and/or published in a peer reviewed scientific or  
medical journal. A Publications Committee composed of Investigators participating in the study and representatives  from RADIUS  as appropriate will  be formed  to oversee the publication of the 
study results, which will reflect the  experience of all participating  study centers.  
Subsequently, individual Investigators may  publish results  from the  study in compliance with 
their agreement with RADIUS.

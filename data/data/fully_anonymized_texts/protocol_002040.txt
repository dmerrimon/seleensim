Glossary of terms 
Assessment  A procedure used to generate data required by [CONTACT_90166]  A specific group of subjects fulfilling certain criteria  
Dosage  Dose of the study treatment given to the subject in a time unit (e.g. 
100 mg once a day, 75 mg twice a day)  
Electronic data capture  Electronic data capture (EDC) is the electronic acquisition of clinical 
study data using data collection systems, such as Web- based 
applications, interactive voice response systems and clinical 
laboratory interfaces. EDC includes the use of Electronic Case 
Report Forms (eCRFs) which are used to capture data transcribed 
from paper source forms used at the point of care.  
Enrollment  Point/time of subject entry into the study at which informed consent must be obtained (i.e. prior to starting any of the procedures 
described in the protocol)  
Estimand  As defined in the ICH E9(R1) addendum, estimand is a precise 
description of the treatment effect reflecting the clinical question 
posed by [CONTACT_6553]. It summarizes at a population- level 
what the outcomes would be in the same participants under 
different treatment conditions being compared. Attributes of an 
estimand include the population, variable (or endpoint) and treatment of interest, as well as the specification of how the remaining intercurrent events are addressed and a population- level 
summ ary for the variable.  
Intercurrent events  Events occurring after treatment initiation that affect either the interpretation or the existence of the measurements associated with 
the clinical question of interest.  
Investigational drug  The study drug whose properties are being tested in the study; this definition is consistent with US CFR 21 Section 312.3 and Directive 2001/20/EC and is synonymous with “investigational new drug” or 
“test substance”  
Investigational treatment  All investigational drug(s) whose properties are being tested in the study as well as their associated treatment controls. This includes any placebos, any active controls, as well as approved drugs used outside of their indication/approved dosage or tested in a fixed 
combination. Investigational treatment generally does not include other treatments administered as concomitant background therapy 
required or allowed by [CONTACT_213734]/dosage.  
Medication number  A unique identifier on the label of each study drug package in 
studies that dispense study drug using an IRT system.  
Patient  An individual with the condition of interest for the study  
Period  A minor subdivision of the study timeline; divides phases into 
smaller functional segments such as screening, baseline, titration, 
washout, etc.  

[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 9 
Amended Protocol Version No. 02 (Clean)   Protocol No. CRTH258D2301  
 
Premature subject 
withdrawal  Point/time when the subject exits from the study prior to the planned 
completion of all study drug administration and assessments; at this time all study drug administration is discontinued and no further 
assessments are planned.  
Randomization  The process of assigning trial participants to investigational drug or 
control/comparator drug using an element of chance to determine 
the assignments in order to reduce bias.  
Randomization number  A unique identifier assigned to each randomized subject, 
corresponding to a specific treatment arm assignment  
Re-screening  If a participant fails the initial screening and is considered as a Screen Failure, he/she can be invited once for a new Screening visit 
after medical judgment and as specified by [CONTACT_213735]  A subject who is screened but is not treated or randomized  
Source Data/Documentation Source data refers to the initial record, document, or primary location from where data comes. The data source can be a database, a dataset, a spreadsheet or even hard- coded data, such 
as paper.  
Study completion  Point/time at which the subject came in for a final evaluation visit or 
when study drug was discontinued whichever is later.  
Study drug discontinuation  Point/time when subject permanently stops taking study drug for any reason; may or may not also be the point/time of premature 
subject withdrawal.  
Study treatment  Any drug administered to the study participants as part of the required study procedures; includes investigational drug (s), 
control(s) or non -investigational medicinal product(s)  
Study treatment 
discontinuation  When the subject permanently stops taking study treatment prior to 
the defined study treatment completion date  
Subject  A trial participant (can be a healthy volunteer or a patient)  
Subject number  A number assigned to each subject who enrolls in the study. When combined with the center number, a unique identifier is created for 
each subject in the study.  
Variable (or endpoint)  The variable (or endpoint) to be obtained for each participant that is 
required to address the clinical question. The specification of the variable might include whether the participant experiences an 
intercurrent event.  
Withdrawal of study consent 
(WoC) / Opposition to use of 
data /biological samples  Withdrawal of consent from the study occurs when the participant 
explicitly requests to stop use of their data and biological samples 
(opposition to use data and biological samples) AND no longer 
wishes to receive study treatment, AND does not agree to further protocol required assessments. This request should be in writing (depending on local regulations) and recorded in the source documentation.  
Opposition to use data/biological samples occurs in the countries where collection and processing of personal data is justified by a 
different legal reason than consent.

Secondary 
Objectives  To demonstrate that brolucizumab is superior to PRP in reducing diabetic retinopathy (DR) severity after [ADDRESS_256496]  at Week 54  
To demonstrate that brolucizumab is superior to PRP in preventing the 
development of center -involved diabetic macular edema (DME)  up to Week [ADDRESS_256497] status by [CONTACT_213736] (DRSS) score at Week [ADDRESS_256498] up to Week 54 and Week 96 and the proportion of subjects 
with center -involv ed DME up to Week 96  
To assess the safety and tolerability of brolucizumab relative to PRP  
Study design  The study is a 96- week, two- arm, randomized, single- masked, multi -center, 
active -controlled, non- inferiority study in patients with proliferative diabetic 
retinopathy (PDR).  
Subjects who meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment arms:

Data analysis  The objective related to the primary endpoint is to demonstrate non- inferiority of 
brolucizumab versus PRP with respect to the change from Baseline in BCVA at 
Week 54, assuming a non- inferiority margin of [ADDRESS_256501]/DME  treatment(s) applied to the study eye.  
The hypothesis will be tested via an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
model.  The model will include treatment, baseline DR Severity category, age 
category, and region as factors, with baseline BCVA as a covariate.  The two-
sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the least square mean difference 
(brolucizumab - PRP) at Week 54 will be presented. Non- inferiority will be 
considered established if the lower limit of the corresponding 95% CI is greater than - [ADDRESS_256502] at Week 54. It will be tested via Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) 
test at a one-s ided significance level of 0.025, after non- inferiority for the primary 
endpoint is established.

1 Introduction 
1.1 Background 
Diabetes mellitus (DM)  is a global epi[INVESTIGATOR_213715] 451 million adults 
worldwide in 2017, with the numbers expected to rise to more than 690 million in 2045 (Cho et  al 2018). diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common and microvascular complication of 
DM and remains the leading cause of preventable blindness in working- age people 
(Cheung et  al 2010, Whitehead  et al 2018). The two major sight -threatening complications of 
DR are diabetic macular edema (DME)  and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). In 2010, 
DR accounted for 2.6%  of all blindness and 1.9%  of all moderate and severe vision impairment 
worldwide ( Leasher  et al 2016).  PDR  is the end stage in the natural history of DR. The main 
pathological pathway involved is a severe hypoxia from retinal capi[INVESTIGATOR_213716], which leads to an increase in levels of the angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and retinal neovasculari zation ( Wong  et al 2016).  The new retinal vessels are fragile and prone to 
bleeding.  As they also tend to grow into the vitreous, they can be associated with retinal detachment and vitreous hemorrhage, which are vision-threatening complications. 
Treatment options for PDR include panretinal photocoagulation (PRP), anti -VEGF agents, and 
vitrectomy ( Wong et  al 2018). Vitrectomy is essentially reserved for cases of non -clearing 
vitreous hemorrhage or traction retinal detachment threatening or involving the macula. 
PRP has been the standard of care for PDR  for over 40 years;  it reduces the risk of severe visual 
loss by 50% or more ( Diabetic  Retinopathy Study Research  Group 1981). However, PRP  is a 
destructive procedure that is associated with permanent sequelae on visual function; these 
include final visual acuity below driving standards, peripheral visual field loss that precludes 
driving, night vision difficulties, loss of color vision, and reduced contrast sensitivity, as well as exacerbated macular edema ( ETDRS  Research  Group 1991, Brucker  et al 2009, 
Preti  et al 2013, Subash et  al 2016). Therefore, there is an unmet need for novel treatments that 
reduce the risk of severe visual loss in PDR while causing fewer adverse events. Anti -
VEGF  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_213717], both in terms 
of visual acuity ( Sivaprasad  et al 2017, Lang  et al 2019) and peripheral visual field 
(Gross  et al 2015, Sivaprasad  et al 2017). Furthermore, anti -VEGF  agents were associated with 
a reduction in emergent macular edema as well as vision -threatening complications of PDR, 
compared to PRP ( Gross  et al 2015, Sivaprasad  et al 2017, Lang  et al 2019).  
Brolucizumab  
Brolucizumab (RTH258, formerly known as ESBA1008), is a humanized single -chain antibody 
fragment (scFv) inhibitor of VEGF -A with a molecular weight of ~26 kDa. Brolucizumab binds 
to the receptor -binding site of the VEGF -A molecule, thereby [CONTACT_213739] -A with its receptors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 on the surface of endothelial cells 
(Escher  et al 2015). Brolucizumab is designed for ophthalmic use and is administered by 
[CONTACT_213740] (IVT) injection. In this setting, the smaller molecular weight of the scFv is expected to have advantages over immunoglobulin G antibodies and larger antibody fragments due to the delivery of a higher molar dose (i.e. VEGF binding equivalents per mg protein), which may prolong the therapeutic effect, assuming comparable ocular half -lives and potency, and enable 
better tissue penetration at the retina.

In two large Phase III pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491] (RTH258- C001 [HAWK] and RTH258-C002 
[HARRIER]), neovascular Age -related Macular Degeneration (nAMD) subjects received 
brolucizumab every 12 weeks (q12w), with the option of adjusting to an 8- week dosing interval 
(q8w) based on disease activity, or aflibercept q8w, after three monthly loading 
doses.  Brolucizumab was non- inferior to aflibercept with regards to change from Baseline in 
best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at Week 48, with over half of the subjects in the 
brolucizumab 6 mg arm maintained exclusively on the q12w dosing interval (56% in HAWK and 51% in HARRIER) ( Dugel et  al 2019).  The visual acuity gains observed in the first year 
were maintained in the second year. Significantly fewer subjects in the brolucizumab 6 mg arm had disease activity at Week 16 in a head -to-head comparison based on matched dosing 
intervals, with a relative  decrease of 30% versus aflibercept (P = 0.0022). Significantly fewer 
subjects on brolucizumab had intraretinal fluid (IRF) and/or subretinal fluid (SRF), with a 35% and 33% reduction relative to aflibercept at Week 16 in HAWK and HARRIER, respectively (P < 0.001 for both), and a 31% and 41% reduction relative to aflibercept at Week 48 in HAWK 
and HARRIER, respectively (P < 0.0001 for both). Brolucizumab 6 mg achieved superior reductions in central subfield thickness (CSFT) versus aflibercept in both the matched dosing and maintenance phases (P  = 0.0016 and P = 0.0023 at Week 16 and Week 48, respectively, in 
HAWK; P < 0.0001 at both Week 16 and Week 48 in HARRIER). These advantages for brolucizumab were maintained in the second year. Safety was comparable between the treatment arms over two years.  
Brolucizumab for PDR  
Ranibizumab, aflibercept, and brolucizumab all inhibit VEGF -A, a key mediator of retinal 
neovascularization and PDR. Both ranibizumab and aflibercept have demonstrated efficacy and safety in the treatment of subjects with PDR. These findings support the evaluation of brolucizumab in patients with PDR. 
The improved efficacy of anti -VEGF therapi[INVESTIGATOR_213718], including emergent center -involved macular edema, with 
visual acuity outcomes at least comparable to PRP.  
There remains a need for anti -VEGF medicines with extended therapeutic durability that could 
support longer intervals between visits and treatment administration compared to current pharmaceutical options. The durability profile of brolucizumab in nAMD subjects, whose majority was maintained on a [ADDRESS_256503] marketing authorization approval in October 2019 for the treatment of nAMD, adverse events of
 retinal vasculitis  (RV) and/or retinal vascular occlusion (RVO) , that may 
result in severe vision loss and typi[INVESTIGATOR_213713], have been 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 20  
Amended Protocol Version No. 02 (Clean)   Protocol No. CRTH258D2301  
 
reported from post -marketing experience with brolucizumab (Beovu®). Results of the 
mechanistic study BASICHR0049 on blood samples from nAMD patients exposed to 
brolucizumab and having subsequently developed retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion, taken together with accumulated data from HAWK, HARRIER and MERLIN, regarding the association of treatment -emergent immunogenicity and IOI, indicate a causal link 
between the treatment- emergent immune reaction against brolucizumab and the  brolucizumab-
related retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion, typi[INVESTIGATOR_213719] . 
Considering the incidence of these events  is uncommon, the overall risk/benefit assessment 
remains positive.

[ADDRESS_256505]. 
Subjects who consent will undergo screening assessments to evaluate their eligibility based on 
the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects who meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the foll owing treatments ( Figure 
3-1):  
• Brolucizumab 6 mg: 3 x q6w loading then q12w maintenance through Week 90, with the option from Week 48 onwards to extend the treatment interval by 6 weeks at a time up to 24 weeks. 
• PRP: initial treatment in 1 -4 sessions up to Week 12, followed with additional PRP 
treatment  (may split into 2 -4 sessions)  as needed up to Week 90. 
Visits will occur every 6 weeks throughout the study, regardless of treatment or not.  
Approximately 941 adult subjects will be screened (25% screen failure rate expected) and approximately 706 subjects (353 per arm, 15% dropout rate expected) will be randomized in a

There will be 3 periods in this study (see Figure 3-1):  
• Screening period: from Day -21 to Baseline (Day 1)  
• Single-masked treatment period: from Baseline (Day 1) to Week 90 (End- of-Treatment)  
• Post- treatment follow -up period: from Week 90 to Week 96 (End-of-Study). 
Figure 3-1 Study design  
  
DAA: Disease activity assessment  
Screening period: Day -[ADDRESS_256507] status will be carried out by [CONTACT_213741]. The Central Reading Center (CRC)  will not be involved in the assessment of 
the PDR  status and the subject's eligibility during the Screening period. Only one study eye can 
be selected per subject.  
Single -masked treatment period: Day 1 to Week 90 
After confirmation of eligibility at the Baseline visit, defined as Baseline / Day 1, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the treatment arms. A  study visit schedule will be 
established at the time of randomization for all subjects. All efforts should be made to adhere to this study visit schedule within a ±7‑day window  (except Baseline / Day 1) . For a given 
protocol visit, assessments can be performed on two consecutive days, provided both days are within the visit window. Treatment is inte nded to be administered on the day of study visit, or

if this is not possible, within [ADDRESS_256508] potential study treatment will be at the Week 90 visit.   
Brolucizumab arm:  
Loading phase (Baseline / Day 1 to Week 12): Subjects will receive three consecutive injections 
every 6 weeks at Baseline, Week 6 and Week 12 during the loading phase. 
Maintenance phase (Week 18 to Week 90): Subjects will then receive q12w injections in the 
maintenance phase. Additional assessment visits are planned for disease monitoring, not for treatment administration; however, injections may be administered at these visits if disease worsens, at the investigator’s discretion. After Week 48, the treatment interval may be extended by 6 weeks at a time, up to 24 weeks, at the investigator’s decision based on the assessment  of 
diabetic retinopathy disease activity. The investigator may opt to revert to q12w injections if disease worsens. Further details are provided in Section  6.7.2. 
PRP arm:  
Subjects in the PRP arm will receive an initial treatment at Baseline / Day 1. The initial treatment may be split into 2 -4 sessions up to Week 12, as per local clinical practice. Additional 
PRP may be performed in the study eye from Week 18 during the course of the study if disease 
worsens and may be split into 2- 4 sessions, at the investigator’s discretion, according to local 
clinical practice.   
Post-treatment follow -up period: Week 90 to Week 96 
For all subjects completing the study, the End -of-Study (EOS) assessment  will be performed at 
Week 96, six weeks  (±7 days) following their last possible study treatment administration 
(Week 90).  
Subjects withdrawn from the study prior to study completion should be asked to return for an early discontinuation (EOS) visit. If study withdrawal occurred less than six weeks after the last study treatment, the EOS visit should take place at least six weeks following their last study treatment administration.  
[ADDRESS_256509].  
Because of the difference in the mode of administration of brolucizumab (the investigational drug) and PRP (the comparator treatment), the duration of the two procedures, and the visible scars resulting from PRP on color fundus photography (CFP), subjects as well as the evaluating 
and treating investigators will not be masked to treatment. However, at each site, BCVA  
 assessments will be carried out by [CONTACT_213742]. Retinal 
images, e.g. 7- Field CFP and spectral domai n optical coherence tomography (SD -OCT), will 
also be evaluated by [CONTACT_213743].  

[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 24  
Amended Protocol Version No. 02 (Clean)   Protocol No. CRTH258D2301  
 
The primary efficacy endpoint is based on BCVA assessed by [CONTACT_213742]. The 
change from baseline in BCVA at a selected time point has been used as primary endpoint in prior studies comparing anti -VEGF agent and PRP in subjects with PDR 
(Gross  et al 2015, Sivaprasad  et al 2017) as well as in studies evaluating brolucizumab in 
subjects with DME (RTH258B2301;  RTH258B2302). The BCVA assessment has its own 
variability and, generally in the clinical practice, a change of BCVA > [ADDRESS_256510] key secondary endpoint will be based on the ETDRS DRSS score assessed on 7 -Field 
CFP by [CONTACT_213744], the study visit, and the investigator's disease activity assessment. The proportion of subjects with no PDR  as defined by a DRSS 
score < 61 after 54 weeks of treatment will allow the assessment of the relative effectiveness of the study treatments in reducing the severity of diabetic retinopathy to non- proliferative stage.  
The primary analysis will be conducted after approximately one year of treatment (Week 54), in agreement with other non- inferiority studies in retinal vascular diseases, including diabetic 
macular edema and retinopathy, in which the primary endpoint is based on BCVA. The 54 -
week duration is deemed long enough to evaluate the efficacy and safety of both study treatments.  
4.2 Rationale for dose/regimen and duration of treatment 
The dose and regimen for brolucizumab are based on the following considerations: 
• Based on the Phase III brolucizumab studies in nAMD (RTH258-C001 - HAWK and 
RTH258-C002 - HARRIER studies), both brolucizumab 3 mg and/or 6 mg doses showed 
comparable functional efficacy and safety profiles to aflibercept, with numerical advantages 
related to efficacy for the 6 mg dose, compared to the 3 mg dose. 
• The dosing regimen comprises a loading phase of three injections followed by a maintenance phase of q12w injections in the first year of treatment, and the option of fewer treatments in the second year by [CONTACT_213745] [ADDRESS_256511] and no center -involved DME in 
prior studies with other anti -VEGF treatments  (Gross  et al 2015, Sivaprasad  et al 2017, 
Lang  et al 2019), in which visual acuity was at least preserved or even improved from 
Baseline, and a higher proportion of subjects were PDR -free after one or two years of 
treatment, when compared to PRP. 
• The 6 mg dose of brolucizumab administered is intended to provide a prolonged duration of action. The increase of 30 days to 75 days in the median time to retreatment in nAMD subjects initially treated with brolucizumab 6 mg vs ranibizumab 0.5 mg in the SEE study (RTH258-C10- 083) as well as the positive nAMD Phase III study results regarding the 
q12w/q8w regimen in HAWK and HARRIER support stretching the minimum interval between injections to 6 weeks. 
• The route of administration is an intravitreal injection as for all anti- VEGF treatments 
currently approved for the treatment of retinal diseases, including DR. 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 25  
Amended Protocol Version No. 02 (Clean)   Protocol No. CRTH258D2301  
 
Study duration of [ADDRESS_256512] worldwide for more than 40 years 
(Diabetic  Retinopathy Study Research  Group 1981, Moutray et  al 2018), including the [LOCATION_003] 
where Lucentis® and Eylea® have been recently approved for the treatment of DR. No anti -
VEGF agents have been approved for the treatment of PDR  in other countries participating in 
the study. 
4.4 Purpose and timing of interim analyses/design adaptations 
The primary analysis will be conducted when all ongoing subjects have completed their Week 
[ADDRESS_256513] that the novel ant i-
VEGF  brolucizumab, which is approved in the [LOCATION_003]  for the treatment of nAMD, will likely 
demonstrate a favorable benefit / risk profile in PDR subjects.  
Intravitreal injections, including those with brolucizumab, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments. Acute intraocular pressure (IOP) increases have also been reported.   Retinal vasculitis and/or vascular occlusion, typi[INVESTIGATOR_213721]. These immune mediated adverse events 
may occur following the first intravitreal injection. Discontinuation of study treatment is 
required in subjects who develop these events. In addition, subjects who experience IOI may 
be at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_213722]/or retinal vascular occlusion and should be closely monitored. 
Based on clinical studies, IOI related adverse events, including retinal vasculitis and retinal 
vascular occlusion, were reported more frequently in female patients treated with brolucizumab 
than male patients (e.g. 5.3% females vs. 3.2% males in HAWK and HARRIER, [COMPANY_001] data on file).  
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 26  
Amended Protocol Version No. 02 (Clean)   Protocol No. CRTH258D2301  
 
Overall, brolucizumab was well tolerated in clinical studies with nAMD subjects when 
treatment interval is not less than every [ADDRESS_256514] 3 monthly initial doses (loading phase) . The risk/benefit assessment for brolucizumab remains positive.  
PRP is still the standard of care and has a positive effect on the severity of DR. However, PRP 
is a destructive procedure and can reduce peripheral and night vision. In addition, it can transiently or permanently reduce central vision. Rarely, it can cause tr ansient increase in IOP. 
In some cases, retrobulbar or per ibulbar injection may be used to anesthetize the eye and to 
reduce eye movements during the administration of PRP, which may have potential rare complications.  
In view of the outcomes of recent trials comparing anti -VEGF  agents and PRP  in PDR  subjects, 
subjects entering this trial may benefit from treatment with brolucizumab via better preservation of peripheral and central vision compared to PRP. In addition, brolucizumab may be more efficient than PRP  in reducing the severity of DR and decreasing the risk of vision-threatening 
complications due to the disease as well as the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_211653]. 
Further details of the known and potential risks and benefits associated with brolucizumab are 
presented in the Investigator's Brochure (IB).

6.[ADDRESS_256526] Number (Subject No.) that is assigned when 
the subject is first enrolled for screening and is retained as the primary identifier for the subject throughout his/her entire participation in the trial. The Subject No. consists of the Center Number (4 digit number for Center No. as assigned by [CONTACT_5359]) with a sequential subject number suffixed to it  ([ADDRESS_256527] No.), so that each subject 
is numbered uniquely across the entire database. Upon signing the informed consent form, the subject is assigned to the next sequential Subject No. available in the electronic data capture (EDC) syste m. 
Subjects who have been screen failures but are rescreened (see Section  8.1) will be assigned a 
new Subject No.  
6.3.[ADDRESS_256528] be added to the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system. At 
the Baseline Visit / Day 1 all eligible subjects will be randomized via IRT to one of the two treatment arms in a ratio of 1:1.  
The investigator or his / her delegate will contact [CONTACT_213748] / exclusion criteria. The IRT will assign a randomization number to the subject, which will be used t o link the subject to a treatment arm 
and will specify a unique medication number for the investigational drug packages (each containing 1 vial or 1 PFS) to be dispensed to the subject. The randomization number will not be communicated to the masked site u sers. 
The randomization numbers will be generated using the following procedure to ensure that treatment assignment is unbiased and concealed from masked staff. A subject randomization list will be produced using a validated system that automates the random assignment of subject numbers to randomization numbers. These randomization numbers are linked to the different treatment arms. A separate medication list will be produced by [CONTACT_213749] 33

[COMPANY_001] Global Clinical Supply using a validated system that automates the random assignment 
of medication numbers to packs containing the investigational drug. The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_11338]. 
The randomization scheme for subjects will be reviewed and approved by a member of the 
Randomization Office.  
6.[ADDRESS_256529] on the recruitment and allocation of subjects, their subsequent care, the assessment of endpoints, the handling of withdrawals, and so on.  
This study will  be single -masked with subjects randomized using IRT to be treated with 
brolucizumab 6 mg or PRP. Because of the difference in the mode of administration of 
brolucizumab (the investigational drug) and PRP (the comparator treatment), the duration of the two procedures, and the visible scars resulting from PRP on CFP, subjects as well as evaluating and treating investigators cannot be masked to treatment. 
To ensure single masking, the site personnel who will perform the  BCVA  
assessments will be masked to the identity of the treatment from the time of randomization 
until the final database lock. The masked site  personnel will be independent from the unmasked 
site staff who will perform the clinical evaluation and administer the study treatment. Once the 
designated roles are determined, the unmasked investigator/site personnel must not be switched at any time after randomization to masked ro le.  The source documentation specific to BCVA  
 assessments will be separately filled and provided to unmasked staff with no 
communication about treatment of the subject. The masked personnel will not have access to the other source documentation and the EDC system.  
Subjects, field monitors, and unmasked site staff will be asked not to communicate any 
information related to the study treatment to the masked site personnel, as documented in the patient informed consent form and in any other study form describing staff responsibilities.  
  Masking to the original treatment assignment will be maintained for the masked personnel at 
the site level until the end of the study. 
Additionally, an independent review of images collected at pre -defined time -points (see 
Section  8.3.2 and Section  8.3.3) for subjects enrolled in the study will be performed at a CRC. 
Independent readers of CFP  images will be masked to the study treatment, the study visit 
number, and the investigator's disease activity assessment. 
6.5 Dose escalation and dose modification 
No dose modification, nor deviation to dose intervals during the loading phase, nor dose 
adjustment during the whole study is allowed for the investigational drug. 
Interruption of study treatment is allowed if warranted by [CONTACT_1149].

6.6 Additional treatment guidance 
6.6.1  Treatment compliance  
Investigator will comply with IRT  treatment assignment for the investigational drug and to their 
local practice for PRP.  
IRT needs to be accessed by [CONTACT_213750].  Registration of all visits 
in the IRT system is necessary and when treatment is warranted, IRT will provide a medication 
(kit) number  to administer the investigational drug to the subject. The date and time of all study 
treatments administered during the study and any deviations from the protocol treatment schedule will be captured by [CONTACT_213751] t he 
appropriate study treatment dispensing form. 
Exposure to brolucizumab will be based on the number of injections administered. The field 
monitor will assess compliance with the investigational drug by [CONTACT_213752], and information provided by [CONTACT_213753]. 
6.7 Preparation and dispensation 
Each study site will be supplied with study medication in packaging as described under investigational drug section ( Section  6.1.1). The study medication packaging has a 2- part 
label  (base plus tear -off label).  A unique medication number is printed on each part of this label, 
which corresponds to one of the treatment arms. Unmasked study personnel will identify the study medication kits to dispense to the subject by [CONTACT_105245](s). Immediately before dispensing the medication kit to the subject, unmasked study personnel will detach the outer part of the label from the packaging and affix it to the source document (Drug Label Form) for that subject's unique subject number. 
6.7.[ADDRESS_256530] be stored according to the instructions specified on the labels and in the Investigator’s Brochure. Clinical supplies are to be dispensed only in accordance with the protocol. Technical complaints are to be reported to the respective [COMPANY_001] C ountry Organization Quality Assurance. 
Medication labels will be in the local language and comply with the legal requirements of each country. They will include storage conditions for the investigational drug but no information about the subject except for the medication number . 
The investigator must maintain an accurate record of the shipment and dispensing of investigational drug in a drug accountability log. Monitoring of drug accountability will be performed by [CONTACT_213754] t he trial.  
At the conclusion of the study, and as appropriate during the course of the study, the investigator will return all unused study treatment, packaging, drug labels, and a copy of the completed drug accountability log to the [COMPANY_001] monitor or to the [COMPANY_001]  address provided in the investigator 
folder at each site.

6.7.[ADDRESS_256531] adheres to the visit schedule. 
During the study, disease activity should be assessed in both treatment arms using retinal 
imaging and visual functional outcomes, at the investigator's discretion (e.g. standard or wide -
field CFP, fluorescein angiography (FA), BCVA). Disease activity will be assessed at each visit from Week 12 to Week 96 (EOS). The investigator’s disease activity assessment will be entered  in the IRT system and eCRF.  
Arm 1: Brolucizumab 6 m g 
All kits of investigational drug assigned by [CONTACT_6607]. 
Treatment schedule Loading phase (Baseline to Week 12) :
  Subjects will receive three consecutive injections every 
6 weeks at Baseline, Week 6 and Week 12 during the loading phase. Maintenance phase (Week 18 to Week 90 ): 
• Subjects will receive q12w injections in the maintenance phase, i.e. at Week 24, Week 36, 
and Week [ADDRESS_256532] year. 
• During the maintenance phase, the additional visits (e.g. Week 30) are planned for disease monitoring, not for treatment administration. However, additional injections may be administered at these visits at the investigator’s discretion only if disease wor sens, e.g. 
new or expanding retinal neovascularization compared to the previous visit. No injection should be administered if retinal neovascularization has been stable. Any additional injection will not impact the q12w injection schedule, i.e. injections at Week 24, Week 36, and Week 48 will be nonetheless performed. 
• From Week 48 onwards,  
• The treatment interval may be extended by 6 weeks at a time, up to 24 weeks, at the investigator’s discretion if, based on the investigator’s assessment of disease activity, there is disease stability or regression, e.g. regressed or stabilized retinal neovascularization from the previous injection visit. 
• Thus, at Week [ADDRESS_256533] to further extend the treatment interval from 18 weeks to 24 weeks, and treat the study eye at Week 90, if the disease did not worsen between Week 48 and Week 66, and there were no in jections at Week 54 and Week 60.   
• The investigator may opt to revert to q12w injections if, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_213727], the subject needs more frequent treatment.  
• The last potential brolucizumab injection may be administered at the Week 90 visit.  
Brolucizumab administration  
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 36  
Amended Protocol Version No. 02 (Clean)   Protocol No. CRTH258D2301  
 
The IVT injection will be carried out by [CONTACT_213755], aseptic conditions 
and antimicrobial requirements according to local clinical practice. Every injection administered to the subject will be recorded in the eCRF.  
If any safety concern arises related to the study eye that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], may be further impacted by [CONTACT_213756], treatment should not be administered. IVT injection is contraindicated in subjects with a ctive ocular or periocular 
infections and in subjects with active intraocular inflammation  (IOI) ; therefore, the 
investigators must verify that these conditions are not present in the study eye prior to every 
injection. Any adverse events must be recorded in the eCRF.   
If any signs of intraocular inflammation are present, then an IVT injection must  not be 
performed. Additional ophthalmic examination and imaging should be performed to evaluate IOI (see Section 8.4.5).  
If IOI is confirmed, subjects should be treated for IOI according to clinical practice  and closely 
monitored since they may be at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_213722]/or retinal vascular occlusion. If subject develops retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion based on the 
investigator’s evaluation, the study treatment must be discontinued. 
 Arm 2: PRP  
Subjects in the PRP arm will receive an initial treatment at Baseline. The treatment may be split 
into 2- 4 sessions up to Week 12 as per local clinical practice. The additional sessions should 
coincide with the visit schedules  (i.e. Week 6 and Week 12), whenever possible, at the 
discretion of the investigator, as long as treatment is adequately administered to the subject. 
From Week 18, all subjects in the PRP arm will be assessed for treatment response every 6 
weeks. Additional PRP may be performed in the study eye  if disease worsens, e.g. new or 
expanding retinal neovascularization compared to the previous visit, at the investigator’s discretion, according to local clinical practice. Additional PRP may be deferred until next visit if the ocular media are too hazy to  perform the procedure.  
PRP is typi[INVESTIGATOR_213728] a slit lamp system or indirect ophthalmoscope (headlamp/BIO). Approximately 1500- 5000 burns may be administered in 1 to 4 sessions, accor ding local clinical 
practice and applicable guidance for PRP.  
PRP performed as a day case hospi[INVESTIGATOR_213729] a serious adverse event 
(SAE) despi[INVESTIGATOR_213730].   
If any safety concern arises related to the study eye that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], may be further impacted by [CONTACT_213757], treatment needs to be deferred. Any adverse events must be recorded in the eCRF.   
If subject develops retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion based on the investigator’s evaluation, the study treatment must be discontinued. 
The last potential PRP treatment may be administered at the Week 90 visit.

7 Informed consent procedures  
Eligible subjects may only be included in the study after providing (witnessed, where required 
by [CONTACT_6617]), Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics  Committee (IRB / IEC) -
approved informed consent. 
If applicable, in cases where the subject's representative(s) gives consent (if allowed according 
to local requirements), the subject must be informed about the study to the extent possible given his / her understanding. If the subject is capable of doing so, he / she must indicate agreement by [CONTACT_30803]. 
Informed consent must be obtained before conducting any study- specific procedures (e.g. all of 
the procedures described in the protocol), except for FA  images that can be used from a previous 
routine evaluation that would have taken place no more than 14 days prior of the Screening visit 
(see Section  8.1). The process of obtaining informed consent must be documented in the subject 
source documents. [COMPANY_001] will provide to investigators in a separate document a proposed informed consent form 
that complies with the International Council for Harmonisation of Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) guidelines and regulatory requirements and is considered appropriate for this study. Any changes to the proposed consent form suggested by [CONTACT_6619] / IEC. 
Information about common side effects already known about the investigational drug can be 
found in the IB. This information will be included in the subject informed consent and should be discussed with the subject during the study as needed. Any new information regarding the safety profile of the investigational drug that is identified between IB updates will be communicated as appropriate, for example, via an investigator notification or an aggregate safety finding. As new information becomes available,  i nformed consent to be updated and 
then must be discussed with the subject.Women of child bearing potential must be informed that taking the study treatment may involve unknown risks to the fetus if pregnancy were to occur during the study and agree that in order to participate in the study they must adhere to the contraception requirements.

A copy of the approved version of all consent forms must be provided to [COMPANY_001] after IRB / 
IEC approval. 
During the COVID -[ADDRESS_256534] the informed consent discussion remotely (e.g. telephone, videoconference). Guidance 
issued by [CONTACT_213758] (e.g. the presence of an impartial witness, sign/dating separate ICFs by [CONTACT_6622], etc). Remote informed consent should 
be appropriately documented and confirmed by [CONTACT_213759].
 
8 Visit schedule and assessments  
The Assessment Schedule ( Table 8 -1) lists all of the assessments and indicates with an “X” or 
“S” the visits when they are performed. All data obtained from these assessments must be supported in the subject’s source documentation. All data must be entered in the eCRF in a timely manner  (see Section  11.1).  
A planned study visit schedule will be established at Baseline / Day 1, randomization (first day of treatment) for all subjects. All post- Baseline and/or subsequent scheduled visits will be 
calculated based on the Day 1 visit date. All efforts should be ma de to adhere to all scheduled 
visits and assessments as outlined in the assessment schedule ( Table 8 -1). 
A ± 7 -day visit window is allowed, except for Baseline / Day 1, should the subject be unable to 
return per scheduled visit. All efforts should be made to revert back to the planned visit schedule taking into consideration the restrictions on the minimum treatmen t interval for brolucizumab, 
i.e. two consecutive injections should be at least [ADDRESS_256535] - after 
completing all assessments required to be performed prior to the administration of study 
treatment. IOP  will also be measured, and other ocular examinations may also be performed, 
after administration of study treatment for safety assessment.  
Missed or rescheduled visits should not lead to automatic discontinuation. Subjects who prematurely discontinue the study for any reason should be scheduled for a visit as soon as possible, at which time all of the assessments listed for the EOS final visit will be performed.  
 If the COVID -19 pandemic limits or prevents on- site study visits, study treatment could not be 
administered and other study assessments may not be performed. Alternative methods of safety 
monitoring may be implemented.  Depending on local regulations, site capabilities and patient’s visit status in the study, phone calls or virtual contacts (e.g. teleconsult) can be performed for safety follow -up for the durat ion of the pandemic, until it is safe for the participant to visit the 
site again.

8.1.1  Information to be collected on screening failures  
Subjects who sign an informed consent form and who are subsequently found to be ineligible 
prior to randomization will be considered a screen failure. The reason for screen failure should be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page. The demographic information, informed consent, inclusion/exclusion and disposition eCRF pages must also be completed for screen failure subjects. No other data will be entered into the clinical database for subjects who are screen failures, unless the subject experienced an SAE during the screening phase (see Section  10.1.3  
for reporting details). Adverse events that are not SAEs will be followed by [CONTACT_90200]. If the subject is not eligible to be randomized, the IRT should be notified within [ADDRESS_256541] demographics/other baseline characteristics  
Country- specific regulations should be considered for the collection of demographic and 
Baseline characteristics in alignment with eCRF.  
The following information will be collected  / documented at Screening and/or Baseline visit 
(see Table 8 -1) for each randomized subject: 
• Age 
• Sex 
• Race / Ethnicity  
• History of primary diagnosis, including type of diabetes and PDR 
• Medical history / current medical conditions 
• Prior / concomitant medications and procedures, including anti- VEGF  intravitreal 
injection or PRP for the treatment of PDR  in the fellow eye that occurred within 20 weeks 
prior to the Baseline visit 
• Vital signs

All efficacy assessments should be performed prior to any administration of study treatment. 
8.3.1  Visual acuity  
Visual acuity will be assessed in the study eye at every study visit and in the fellow eye at the 
Screening, Week 54 and Week 96/EOS visits using best correction determined from protocol refraction (BCVA). BCVA  will also be measured in the fellow eye if the BCVA in the study 
eye has dropped by 10 or more ETDRS letters from the previous visit.  
BCVA measurements will be taken in a sitting position using ETDRS –like visual acuity testing 
charts at an initial testing distance of 4 meters. The details of the refraction technique and VA testing, as well as training material, are provided in the applicable manual. Certification of the assessment procedures and assessors will occur prior to any evaluation of study subjects. 
Subjects at sites in some Asian countries will undergo BCVA testing using numerical charts 
rather than letter charts. Therefore, all references in the protocol to changes in letters read will be changes in numbers in these countries.

7-Field standard (non -stereoscopic) or Wide -Field FA will be performed in the study eye 
at the Screening, Week 54, Week 96 / EOS visits and in the fellow eye at the Screening visit. 
FA may be performed at other visits, at the investigator’s discretion. The FA camera model 
used for an individual subject should not change for the duration of the study. 
For the purpose of screening, FA images from a previous routine evaluation may be used as 
long as FA was performed within [ADDRESS_256544] of clinical practice and

captured in the eCRF but should be included in the source documentation at the study site. 
The CRC will provide sites with a Study Manual and training materials for the specified study 
ocular images. Before any study images are obtained, site personnel, test images, systems and software will be certified and validated by [CONTACT_213760]. All 7-Field CFP, WFCFP, and FA images will be obtained by [CONTACT_213761]- certified site 
personnel at the study sites and forwarded to the CRC for independent standardized analysis and for storage.  
The CRC will create a database with the agreed variables as indicated in the CRC grading charter (a separate document) and will transfer the data from this database to [COMPANY_001] for analysis. The  CRC data will be used for the evaluation of the objectives having 7- Field CFP 
and FA parameters  and their change over time as endpoints to ensure a standardized evaluation. 
Grading for DRSS score will be performed at the CRC. 
For further procedural details, the investigator should refer to the applicable manual provided 
by [CONTACT_10186]. 
Additional images will be taken in case of any signs of intraocular inflammation. OCT, Color 
fundus photography and fluorescein angiography (preferably wide -field or with peripheral 
sweeps) should be performed for safety evaluation as described in Section 8.4.5. 
8.3.[ADDRESS_256545] images will be obtained and assessed in both eyes at Screening, Week 54 and Week 
96/EOS visits, and in the study eye at all other visits. 
These assessments will be performed by a trained and CRC -certified technician or investigator 
at the sites and should be performed after BCVA assessment and prior to any study treatment. 
Investigators will evaluate the SD -OCT images to assess the status of macular edema. The SD -
OCT model used for an individual subject should not change for the duration of the study.

• Biomicroscopy  (slit lamp examination)  will be completed at every (scheduled  and 
unscheduled) visit to examine the anterior segment structures  (e.g., eyelids/lashes, 
conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber, iris, lens and anterior part of the vitreous) of the 
study eye according to local clinical practice. At visits when study treatment is administered, the examination will be performed pre -treatment; if needed, an additional 
examination may be performed post- treatment. The fellow eye will be examined at 
Screening for eligibility, and at other vis its at the discretion of the investigator. The results 
of the examination of either eye should be recorded in the source documents as appropriate. 
Slit lamp examination must be carefully performed before each study treatment. If there are any signs of IOI, severity of anterior chamber cells and flare should be assessed according to the standardization of uveitis nomenclature (SUN) working group grading system ( Jabs et al 2005). 
The test results will be recorded in the source documents (e.g., ophthalmic examination tool) and captured in the appropriate eCRF as applicable. 
Ophthalmoscopy  will be conducted by [CONTACT_213764]. An 
examination of the peripheral retina must also be conducted to ensure that the study treatment 
can be safely  performed. As of Baseline visit, the fundus examination will be performed only 
in the study eye at every scheduled visit. Posterior segment examination must be performed 
carefully before each study treatment. The results of the examination including any abnormalities (e.g. vitreous cells/haze, retinal tear/d etachment, hemorrhage and vascular 
occlusion, vasculitis, etc.) should be recorded in the source documents. If there are any signs of IOI, vitreous cells and haze should be assessed using National Institutes of Health (NIH) grading system ( Nussenblatt et al 1985). The outcome of the examination will be documented 
in the source document (e.g., ophthalmic examination tool) and appropriate eCRF page as applicable.  Pupil dilation for slit lamp examination and ophthalmoscopy is optional, at the discretion of the investigator or according to local clinical practice.   
 Instruct the patient to contact [CONTACT_213765].  Every effort should be made to bring the subject for 
immediate examination. When IOI, retinal vasculitis, and/or Retinal Artery Occlusion ( RAO) 
is present or suspected during a visit, investigators must perform thorough ophthalmic examination, and will conduct OCT, fluorescein angiography and color fundus photography 
(preferably wide- field or with peripheral sweeps). These additional assessments will be 
documented in the source and appropriate eCRF pages as applicable. The images are requested 
to be uploaded onto the CRC portal.  If subject develops retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular 
occlusion based on the investigator’s evaluation, the study treatment  must be discontinued. In 
addition, as some of the subjects who experience  IOI may be at  risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_213732]/or retinal vascular occlusion, the subject should be closely monitored and managed according to clinical practice.

During the treatment period, subjects will be asked to complete an optional anonymized 
questionnaire, the "Trial Feedback Questionnaire", to provide feedback on their clinical trial experience at Baseline, Week 54 and Week 96/EOS visits. Subjects may opt in or opt out of completing this questionnaire. 
Responses will not be reviewed by [CONTACT_431]. Responses will be used to understand where 
improvements can be made in the clinical trial process. This questionnaire is not meant to collect data about the subject's disease, symptoms or adverse events, and  therefore will not be 
considered trial data.

A subject will be considered to have completed the study when the subject has completed the last visit planned in the protocol (see Table 8 -1). 
The investigator and/or referring physician will recommend the appropriate follow-up medical care, if needed, for all subjects who are prematurely withdrawn from the study. 
9.1.[ADDRESS_256555] if he / she believes that 
continuation would negatively impact the subject's well-being. 
Study treatment must be discontinued under the following circumstances: 
• Subject/guardian decision 
• Pregnancy (see Section  8.4.3 and Section  10.1.4) 
• Use of prohibited treatment (see Section  6.2.2) 
• Any situation in which study participation might result in a safety risk to the subject 
• Subject develops a retinal vasculitis and/or a retinal vascular occlusion Unsatisfactory 
therapeutic effect  
If discontinuation of study treatment occurs, the investigator should make a reasonable effort to understand the primary reason for the subject’s premature discontinuation of study treatment and record this information. 
Subjects who discontinue study treatment or who decide they do not wish to participate in the 
study further should NOT be considered withdrawn from the study UNLESS they withdraw their consent (see Section  9.1.2). Where possible, they should return for the assessments 
indicated in the Assessment Schedule ( Table 8 -1). If they fail to return for these assessments

Subjects who started study treatment but prematurely discontinued study treatment and/or study will not be replaced.  
9.1.2  Withdrawal of informed consent  
Withdrawal of consent/opposition to use data/biological samples occurs when a participant:
 
• Explicitly requests to stop use of their biological samples and/or data (opposition to use 
participant ’s data and biological samples)  
and 
• No longer wishes to receive study treatment 
and 
• Does not want any further visits or assessments (including further study- related contacts)  
This request should be in writing (depending on local regulations) and recorded in the source 
documentation. 
In this situation, the investigator should make a reasonable effort (e.g. telephone, e -mail, letter) 
to understand the primary reason for the participant’s decision to withdraw their 
consent/opposition to use data/biological samples and record this information. 
Where consent to the use of Personal and Coded Data is not required in a certain country's legal 
framework, the participant therefore cannot withdraw consent. However, they still retain the right to object to the further collection or use of their Personal Data.  
Study treatment must be discontinued and no further assessments conducted, and the data that would have been collected at subsequent visits will be considered missing.

[including abnormal laboratory findings], symptom or disease) in a subject or clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the study. Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product or medical device.  
The investigator has the responsibility for managing the safety of individual subject and identifying adverse events. 
[COMPANY_001] qualified medical personnel will be readily available to advise on trial related medical 
questions or problems. 
The occurrence of adverse events must be sought by [CONTACT_105]- directive questioning of the subject at 
each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered by 
[CONTACT_213766]. 
Adverse events must be recorded under the signs, symptoms, or diagnosis associated with them, 
accompanied by [CONTACT_6644] (as far as possible) (if the event is serious refer to Section  10.1.2):  
1. The severity grade:  
• mild: usually transient in nature and generally not interfering with normal activities  
• moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities  
• severe: prevents normal activities  
2. Its relationship to the study treatment (e.g. study drug, the intravitreal injection procedure, or laser procedure). If the event is due to lack of efficacy or progression of underlying illness (i.e. progression of the study indication) the assessment of c ausality will usually be 
‘Not suspected.’ The rationale for this guidance is that the symptoms of a lack of efficacy or progression of underlying illness are not caused by [CONTACT_104841], they happen in spi[INVESTIGATOR_6532]/or both lack of efficacy and progression of underlying disease can only be evaluated meaningfully by [CONTACT_6646], not on a single subject  
3. Its duration (start and end dates) or if the event is ongoing, an outcome of not recovered/not resolved must be reported 
4. Whether it constitutes an SAE (see Section  10.1.2 for definition of SAE) and which 
seriousness criteria have been met  
5. Action taken regarding with study treatment. All adverse events must be treated appropriately. Treatment may include one or more of the following: 
• No action taken (e.g. further observation only) 
• Study treatment interrupted/withdrawn  
• Concomitant medication or non-drug therapy given

definition of SAE) 
6. its outcome   
• not recovered / not resolved; 
• recovered / resolved; 
• recovered / resolved with sequelae;  
• fatal;  
• unknown. 
Conditions that were already present at the time of informed consent should be recorded in 
medical history of the subject.  
Adverse events (including lab abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described using a diagnosis whenever possible, rather than individual underlying signs and symptoms. 
Adverse event monitoring should be continued for at least [ADDRESS_256560] be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be permanent (e.g. continuing at the end of the study), and assessment must be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome. 
Information about adverse drug reactions for the investigational drug can be found in the IB. Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they fulfill at least 
one of the following criteria: 
• they induce clinical signs or symptoms 
• they are considered clinically significant  
• they require therapy  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or test results must be identified through a 
review of values outside of normal ranges/clinically notable ranges, significant changes from Baseline or the previous visit, or values which are considered to be non -typi[INVESTIGATOR_201031]. 
10.1.2  Serious adverse events 
An SAE is defined as any adverse event [appearance of (or worsening of any pre -existing)] 
undesirable sign(s), symptom(s), or medical conditions(s) which meets any one of the following 
criteria:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
Life-threatening in the context of an SAE refers to a reaction in which the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe (please refer to the IC H-E2D Guidelines). 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 56  
Amended Protocol Version No. 02 ( Clean)  Protocol No. CRTH258D2301  
 
• constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], unless 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_062]:  
• routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration in condition 
• elective or pre- planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the 
indication under study and has not worsened since signing the informed consent 
• social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_108999]’s general condition 
• treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of an SAE given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] 
• is medically significant, e.g. defined as an event that jeopardizes the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_213733]. Such events should be considered as “medically significant.” Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allerg ic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that 
do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6536]  (please refer to the ICH -
E2D Guidelines). 
All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under “medically significant” if other 
seriousness criteria are not met.   
Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse reaction.  
All reports of intentional misuse and abuse of the product are also considered serious adverse event irrespective if a clinical event has occurred.  
10.1.[ADDRESS_256561] be reported separately as a new event.  
If the SAE is not previously documented in the IB or Package Insert (new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the study treatment, a Chief Medical Office & Patient Safety (CMO & PS) Department associate may urgently require further information from the investigator for

[ADDRESS_256563] been trained. Automatic validation programs check for data discrepancies in the eCRFs, allow modification and/or verification of the entered data by [CONTACT_6649].  
The investigator / designee is responsible for assuring that the data (entered into eCRF) is complete, accurate, and that entry and updates are performed in a timely manner. The Investigator must certify that the data entered are complete and accurate  
After final database lock, the investigator will receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_109002].  
All data should be recorded, handled, and stored in a way that allows its accurate reporting, interpretation, and verification. 
11.2 Database management and quality control 
[COMPANY_001] personnel (or designated Contract Research Organization) will review the data entered by [CONTACT_5375]. Electronic data queries stating the nature of the problem and requesting clarification will be created for discrepancies and missing values and sent to the investigational site via the EDC system. Designated investigator site staff are required to respond promptly to queries and to make any necessary changes to the data. 
Concomitant treatments and prior medications entered into the database will be coded using the 
World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Reference List, which employs the anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) classification system. Medical history / current med ical conditions 
and adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology. 
Laboratory samples will be processed centrally and the results will be sent electronically to 
[COMPANY_001]. CFPs, FAs, and OCT images will be processed centrally by [CONTACT_213768]. COA  data will be processed centrally by [CONTACT_213769]. The Data management staff will review data received from the CRC, central lab, and COA  (except Trial Feedback 
Questionnaire) vendors. Data Review will be done for data structure and data completeness/accuracy as defined in Vendor Data Transfer Specifications.  
Randomization codes and data about all study treatments dispensed to the subject will be tracked using an IRT. The system will be supplied by a vendor, who will also manage the database. The data will be sent electronically to [COMPANY_001] (or a designated CRO) at specific timelines.  
The occurrence of relevant protocol deviations will be determined prior to the Week [ADDRESS_256564] been completed and the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, it will be

Amended Protocol Version No. 02 ( Clean)  Protocol No. CRTH258D2301  
 
locked and the treatment codes will be unmasked and made available for data analysis. However, 
masking to the original treatment assignment will be maintained at the site level i.e., BCVA   
) after the Week 54 Database Lock until the end of the study 
(see Section  6.4). Any changes to the database after that time can only be made after written 
agreement by [CONTACT_188660].  
11.3 Site monitoring 
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigator’s meeting, a [COMPANY_001] (or designated CRO) representative will review the protocol and data capture requirements (i.e. eCRFs) with the investigators and their staff. During the study, [COMPANY_001] employs several methods of ensuring protocol and GCP compliance and the quality / integrity of the sites’ data. The field monitor will visit the site to check the completeness of subject records, the accuracy of data capture / data entry, the adherence to the protocol and to Good Clinical Practice, the progress of enrollment, and to ensure that study treatment is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications. Key study personnel must be available to assist the field monitor during these visits. Continuous remote monitoring of each site’s data may be performed by a centralized [COMPANY_001] (or designated CRO)  Clinical Research Associates 
organization. Additionally, a central analytics organization may analyze data & identify risks & trends for site operational parameters, and provide reports to [COMPANY_001] clinical teams to assist with trial oversight.  
The investigator must maintain source documents for each subject in the study, consisting of case and visit notes (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5320]) containing demographic and medical information, laboratory data, retinal images (e.g. CFP, FA, OCT), and the results of any other tests or assessments. All information on eCRFs must be traceable to these source documents in the subject’s file.  The investigator must also keep the original informed consent form signed by [CONTACT_423] (a signed copy is given to the subject).  
The investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm their consistency with the data capture and / or data entry. [COMPANY_001] monitoring standards require full verification for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion / exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs, and of data that will be used for all primary variables. Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the eCRFs are performed according to the study- specific monitoring plan. No information in source documents about the identity of the 
subjects will be disclosed.  
[ADDRESS_256565] completed the Week 54 visit or terminated the study prior to Week 54. The primary analysis based on Week 54 data, will be derived from this database. All subjects still in the study beyond Week 54 will continue to receive study treatment as scheduled through the planned study duration. The analysis of the data collected after the Week 54 visit will be performed once all subjects complete the EOS visit o r discontinue from the study.   
Summary statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_213738]. For continuous variables, summary statistics will generally include: n, mean, standard deviation,

include: n, frequency and percentage in each category. Further technical details and discussions of the statistical considerations will be provided in the  Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
Additional analysis  may be also  conducted to evaluate the impact of COVID-[ADDRESS_256566] been deemed eligible for randomization by [CONTACT_213770] a randomization number. Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment assigned to them at randomization.  
The Full Analysis Set  (FAS) comprises all randomized subjects who receive at least one study 
treatment. Subjects in the FAS will be analyzed according to the treatment assigned to them at randomization. 
The Safety Analysis Set  (SAF) includes all subjects who receive at least one study treatment. 
Subjects in the SAF will be analyzed according to the actual study treatment they 
received,  where treatment received is defined as the randomized/assigned treatment if the 
subject took at least one dose of that treatment, or the first treatment received if the randomized/assigned treatment was never received.  
The Per Protocol Set  (PPS) is a subset of the FAS and will exclude or censor data from subjects 
with important protocol deviations (PDs) and analysis restrictions (ARs) that are expected to majorly affect the validity of the assessment of efficacy at Week [ADDRESS_256567] demographics and other baseline characteristics  
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized with descriptive statistics for the FAS by [CONTACT_166884]. Relevant medical history and current medical conditions will be listed for ocular and non- ocular events. Other relevant basel ine information will be listed 
and summarized with descriptive statistics as appropriate.

12.4 Analysis of the primary endpoint(s) 
12.4.1  Definition of primary endpoint(s)  
The primary endpoint is the  change from Baseline  in BCVA  at Week 54. BCVA is defined in 
Section  8.3.1. 
The key secondary endpoints are  the proportion of  subjects  with no PDR in the study eye 
at Week 54, and the proportion of  subjects  with center -involved DME in the study eye up to 
Week 54. The endpoints are defined as follows: 
• The event "no PDR" is defined as a DRSS score < 61. The DRSS score will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_213772] 7- field CFP images.  
• Subjects that have at least one center -involved DME event in the study eye after Baseline 
will be classified as with  center -involved DME. Center -involved DME will be defined 
according to CRC evaluation of predefined anatomical parameters.  
All endpoints are defined with respect to the study eye. The different estimands of interest for this study are detailed in  Table 12-1. 
12.4.2  Statistical model, hypothesis, and method of analysis  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of change from baseline in BCVA at Week [ADDRESS_256568] to the change from Baseline in BCVA at Week 54, assuming a non-inferiority margin of 4 ETDRS letters.  
Let: 
B = Brolucizumab 6 mg 
P = PRP  
Consider the following non- inferiority hypotheses related to a non- inferiority margin of 4 
letters: H
01: μB – μP ≤ -4 letters versus H A1: μB – μ P > -[ADDRESS_256569]/DME  treatment(s) applied to the study eye (e.g. alternative anti -VEGF 
treatments,  as further detailed in  Section  6.2.2 and in the SAP). The analysis set for the primary 
estimand will be the FAS as described in Table 12-1. 
Based on the FAS, the above hypotheses will be tested via an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) model.  The model will include treatment, Baseline DR Severity category 
(Moderate PDR or better, High- risk PDR or worse), age category  (< 55, ≥ 55)  and region as 
factors, with Baseline BCVA as a covariate.

The two -sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the least square mean difference (brolucizumab 
- PRP) at Week 54 will be presented. Non -inferiority will be considered established if the lower 
limit of the corresponding 95% CI is greater than - [ADDRESS_256570]  key secondary endpoint are 
established:  
H02: μB – μP ≤ 0 letters versus H A2: μB – μ P > 0 letters.  
Superiority in BCVA will be considered established if the lower limit of the corresponding 95% CI from the same  ANCOVA model used to assess  for non- inferiority  analysis  is greater than 0 
letters.  
Multiplicity control of primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints is discussed  in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].

the study eye at Week 54 in the brolucizumab and PRP arms, respectively. The above hypotheses will be tested via Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test at a one- sided 
significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_256573] Severity category (Moderate PDR or better, 
High -risk PDR or worse), age category (< 55, ≥ 55)  and region as adjusting factors. Multiplicity 
control is discussed in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
The difference in proportion between treatment  arms  will be estimated using the weighted 
average of the proportion differences over adjusting factors  using the Mantel -Haenszel 
weights. Adjusting factors will be the same as for the CMH test.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of emergent center -involved DME up to Week [ADDRESS_256574] to reducing the proportion of subjects with center -

The difference in proportions between treatment  arms  will be estimated using the weighted 
average of the proportion differences over  adjusting  factors  using the Mantel -Haenszel 
weights. Adjusting factors will be the same as for the CMH test.  
Kaplan -Meier estimates of  the proportions of subjects with  center -involved DME  over time 
and at Week 54  will also be presented for each treatment arm.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Multiplicity control of primary and key secondary endpoints  
To control  the overall type I error rate at  a one- sided 0.025 level, testing of non- inferiority 
for the primary endpoint, superiority for  the primary endpoint and superiority for  the key 
secondary endpoints will be conducted in a hierarchical sequence as described  below: 
1. Non-inferiority for primary endpoint (BCVA): H 01 versus H A1 
2. Superiority for key secondary endpoint 1 (PDR): H 03 versus H A3 
3. Superiority for primary endpoint (BCVA): H 02 versus H A2 
4. Superiority for key secondary endpoint 2 (center-involved DME): H 04 versus H A4

To account for a drop- out rate of 15%, a total of approximately 706 (353 per arm) subjects will 
need to be randomized. 
12.8.1  Primary endpoint(s)  
A sample size of 300 subjects per arm will allow assessment of non -inferiority (using a non-

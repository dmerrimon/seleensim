Clinical Sites:   At least  2 study sites in the [LOCATION_002]  
Primary Objective:   
The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the eq uivalence of hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI as compared 
to 133Xe scintigraphy for the evaluation of pulmonary function.  
Secondary Objectives:  
The secondary objective s of this study are to: 
• Assess the safety and tolerability of hyperpolarized 129Xe gas ; 
• Evaluate regional ventilation defects in each of the 6 zones, and 
• Demonstrate the equivalence of post -operative forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_3741] 1 second ( FEV1 ) values 
predicted using hyperpolarized 129Xe as compared to 133Xe scintigraphy .   
Study Design:  
This is a multicenter,  randomized,  open -label , cross -over Phase 3 study  evaluating  hyperpolarized  129Xe MRI as

Planned Number of Subjects :   
Completed:  [ADDRESS_1099210], Dose, and Mode of Administration:   
The test product is hyperpolarized  129Xe gas and will consist of a volume of hyperpo larized  129Xe inflated with 
ultra-high purity  nitrogen  gas to a final volume of 1 L.  Subjects will be required to inhale the 1 L of gas mixture 
and hold their breath for a maximum of 15 seconds (generally 10 -15 seconds, based on the length of the scan)  
while the MRI is acquired .  
During the MRI session, one or more conventional proton MRI s cans will be collected to confirm lung 
anatomical features.  Subjects will be required to take a full in halation breath of room air and hold their breath for 
a maximu m of [ADDRESS_1099211]  while in the MRI scanner.  If the 
resulting scan is determined or thought to be inadequate, the n a calibration dose (approximately 100 m L 
hyperpolarized  129Xe gas) will be administered followed by [CONTACT_796896] ( ≤750 mL) dose.  The calibration dose is 
administered to allow for adjustments of MRI parameters, as n eeded, to ensure best image quality.  
Reference Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration:   
The reference standard is the anterior and posterior wash -in views of a 133Xe scintigraphy scan.  133Xe is 
administered by [CONTACT_796897] a closed respi[INVESTIGATOR_796880].   
Subjects will be exposed to 133Xe gas for 3 -4 minutes, as tolerated.

 Efficacy Assessments:  
Primary Efficacy Endpoints:    
The primary endpoint is the scan predicted post -operative FEV1.  The scans will be quantified using 
commercially available  software to report the fraction of activity arising from [ADDRESS_1099214] -operative FEV1 by [CONTACT_796898] -operated zones by 
[CONTACT_094]-operative FEV1.  
Secondary  Efficacy  Endpoints:  
The seco ndary efficacy endpoints include the post -operative FEV1 value (spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]) and the percentage 
function contributed by [CONTACT_796899] 6 lung zones.   
Safety Endpoints:  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed based on the incidence and severity of  treatment emergent adverse events 
(AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs).  Additionally, subjects will be monitored before, during, and after each 
dose to monitor for changes in vital signs.  
Statistical Methods:   
Sample Size Determination:   
The sample size required to demonstrate equivalence is driven by 2 factors: 1) the intra -subject variability of the 
difference between the predicted post -operative FEV1 from the 2  methods, and 2) the pre -specified equivalence 
margin.  From prior literature, the intra -subject variability for 133Xe scintigraphy leads to an estimated variability 
in predicted post -operative FEV1 of 0.21 L/sec.  Similarly, prior studies ha ve suggested that the equivalence 
margin between the 2  imaging techniques currently used for resection  planning is 0.3  L/sec.  Using these 
assumptions, and based on the use of a two -sided test at the alpha=0.05 level of significance, a sample size o f 15 
subjects is required for 90% power.  However, given limited  literature on 133Xe variability, we account for the 
possibility that it could be higher.  If true variability is 0.3 2 L/sec, then a sample size of 32 subjects will provide 
90% power to establish equivalence.   
Primary Analysis:   
The primary analysis for this study will be to test the m ean difference in predicted post -operative FEV1 
(measured in L/sec) values as measured using hyperpolarized 129Xe gas MRI relative to 133Xe scintigraphy 
(reference standard).  The primary analysis will be conducted by  [CONTACT_796900] 95% confidence interval (CI) for 
the mean difference in predicted FEV1 from the [ADDRESS_1099215] difference between methods is normally 
distributed .  If the 95% CI for the mean difference is contained wi thin the interval ( -0.30, +0.30 L/sec), 
equivalence will have been demonstrated.  
Secondary Analysis:  
The post -operative secondary analysis for this study will be to test t he mean difference in predict ed post -operative 
FEV1 (measured in L/sec) values as measured using hyperpolarized 129Xe gas MRI and 133Xe scintigraphy 
(reference standard) relative to the final post -operative FEV1 value (spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]).  The secondary equivalence 
analysis will be conducted  using the same methodology and same equivalence margin as specif ied for the primary 
analysis.  
The [ADDRESS_1099216] been demonstrated if the 95% 
CI for the mean difference is contained within the interval ( -5%, + 5%). 
Safety An alysis:  
All AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC), pre ferred term, severity and relationship to study drug.  
Aes leading to death or to discontinuation from study drug as well as the SAEs will also be tabulated.  In the by -
subject summary, a subject having the same event more than once will be counted only once and by [CONTACT_796901].

 1. INTRODUCTION  
Polarean, Inc. (Polarean, the Sponsor) has developed a drug/device combination to administer 
hyperpolarized 129Xe as a diagnostic agent used in conjun ction with magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI ) for the evaluation of pulmonary function and for imaging the l ungs.  The proposed patient 
population includes patients requiring imaging evaluation of pulmonary function prior to a  
variety of lung surgeries.  Today, these pre- operative evaluations employ nuclear scintigraphy 
methods using 133Xe ventilation and/ or Technetium (99mTc) perfusion (the so called 
ventilation/perfusion [V/Q] scan).  The primary objective for this study is to demonstrate the 
equivalence of hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI as compared to 133Xe scintigraphy.    
The population referred for such scans includes patients undergoing evaluation for possi ble lung 
resection surgery  and transplants.  In both circumstances, regional pulmonary function 
information is used for making surgical decisions.  For this study, the population will inc lude 
patients being evaluated for possible lung resection surgery.  The definition of lung  resection 
surgery includes segmentectomies, lobectomies, and pneumonectomies .  Segmentectomies refer 
to the removal of an area of the lung that is smaller than a lobe.  A lobectomy is th e removal of a 
lobe (or lobes), whereas a pneumonectomy is the removal of an entire lung ( BMC  website ).   
1.1. Hyperpolarized 129Xe in BRANDNAME [CONTACT_796927] 3 different components.  Together, these components hype rpolarize, 
measure  the hyperpolarization of 129Xe gas , and permit administration to the patient .  Inhalation  
of the hyperpolarized inert gas allows for clear imaging  of its distribution within  the lungs when 
using any multi -nuclear  capable  MRI  scanner.  The 3 components are the Hyperpolarizer, the 
Polarization Measurement Station, and the Gas Delivery Bag ( refer to Figure 2 ).   
The drug product is hyperpolarized 129Xe.  It is created by [CONTACT_15728] a gas mixture of xenon (Xe), 
helium (He) , and nitrogen (N 2) through the Hyperpolarizer.  Once the Xe is hyperpolarized, it is 
collected in a Gas Delivery Bag  and filled to volume (1 L) with with inert N [ADDRESS_1099221] , the degree of hyperpolarization is measured with 
the Polarization Measurement Station  (refer to Section 6.9.1 ).  The standard volume (dose) of 
hyperpolarized 129Xe is ≤750 mL administered ( via inhalation) to the subject while in the MRI 
(refer to Section 5.2.1 ). 
1.2. Mechanism  of Action 
Mechanistically, hyperpolarized 129Xe is metabolized in order to achieve its primary purpose.  
After imaging, the hyperpolarized 129Xe is exhaled  from the body during normal respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].

 1.3. Pharmacokinetics  
Hyperpolarized 129Xe is chemically and biologically identical to non -polarized Xe, which is a 
“perfusion- limited”  gas and therefore not subject to membrane diffusion ( Roughton and Forster, 
1957 ).  It can therefore  be assumed  that the Xe concentration  in the venous capi[INVESTIGATOR_796883] .  Data have demonstrated  that Xe  concentration is diminished by [CONTACT_56944] 
1000 × prior to achieving 40 breaths.   Normal  humans breathe  at a rate of 12-20 breaths  per 
minute ( Guyton and Hall, 2006 ), therefore the 40- breath  mark  would be reached  at 2-3 minutes.   
Because  blood and airspaces remain in close equilibrium, it is anticipated that the Xe 
concentration in blood will follow an identical decay curve; however, it will start at a lower 
concentration .  As only one breath of Xe is used for MRI imaging (rather than breathing to 
equilibrium), it is anticipated that Xe exhalation in patients with lung dis ease will be similar to 
that of healthy volunteers. 
Detailed information on the pharmacokinetics of Xe and 129Xe is provided in the Investigator’s 
Brochure  (IB).     
1.4. Nonclinical Evaluations 
A single -dose toxicity study was completed in Beagle dogs under IND 075,010 by [CONTACT_395930] (Report No. FY01 -015).  Results from clinical observations, ophthalmologic 
examinations, body weights, food consumption, clinical pathology, and pulmonary function all 
indicated that no biologically significant adverse effects of exposure were  observed.  The beagle 
dogs were observed during exposure as well as for [ADDRESS_1099222] been conducted with Xe gas 
enriched with 129Xe to 50% v/v.  No signs of toxicity, beyond the known physiological effects of 
Xe gas as an asphyxiant and anesthetic, were observed in these stud ies.   
Literature supports that 129Xe gas does not affect the hepatic and renal systems ( Reinelt et al., 
2002 ), is non- reactive, and is excreted quickly via the lung.  Toxicity data fr om repeat -dose 
reproductive and developmental ( Lane et al., 1980 ; Burov et al., 2002a ; Burov et al., 2002b ), and 
immunotoxicological  (Burov et al., 2002c ; Horn et al., 2001 ; de Rossi et al., 2001 ; de Rossi et 
al., 2002 ; de Rossi et al., 2004 ) studies show no evidence that inhalation of Xe gas causes any

To date, the clinical development program for hyperpolarized 129Xe gas in the BRANDNAME 
[CONTACT_796928] 1 Phase 1 study (GE-141-001) and data reported in the literature.  The 
Phase 1, single-site, open-label, non-randomized study was conducted by [CONTACT_796902]., 2010 ; Driehuys et al., 2012 ; Kaushik et al., 2011 ; 
He et al., 2014a ; and Virgincar et al., 2013 .  Additional literature support comes form Kirby [CONTACT_199145]., 2013 ; He et al., 2014b ; Svenningsen et al., 2013 ; He et al., 2015 ; and Stewar t et al., 2015 .   
Across these studies, a total of 55 healthy volunteers, 20 patients with chronic obstruc tive 
pulmonary disease (COPD , 10 of which had radiographic evidence of  emphysema ), 27 patients 
with asthma, and 1 current smoker (healthy) have been administered 1  or more hyperpolarized 
129Xe scan (total exposed to 1 or more doses = 103).  No treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) or laboratory changes were reported. 
Detailed information on the clinical evaluation of Xe and 129Xe is provided in the IB.   
1.6. Rationale for Study 
The investigational product is a non- radioactive, [ADDRESS_1099223] ’s regional 
pulmonary function.   This study was designed to evaluate the ability of hyperpolariz ed 129Xe to 
provide clear images  as compared to 133Xe scintigraphy  for the evaluation of pulmonary 
function.   
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
2.1. Primary Objective   
The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the equivalence of hyperpola rized 129Xe 
MRI as compared to 133Xe scintigraphy for the evaluation of pulmonary function. 
2.2. Secondary Objectiv es  
The secondary objective s of this study are to: 
• Assess the safety and tolerability of hyperpolarized 129Xe gas ; 
• Evaluate regional ventilation defects in each of the 6 zones, and 
• Demonstrate the equival ence of post- operative  forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_3741] 1 second

 3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a multicenter,  randomized, open- label, cross -over Phase 3 study evaluating  
hyperpolarized 129Xe gas MRI as compared to 133Xe scintigraphy for the evaluation of 
pulmonary function.  This study will enroll male and female subjects being evaluated for  
possible lung resection surgery (i.e. segmentectomy, lobectomy, or pneumonectomy).   
The planned enrollment is [ADDRESS_1099224]’s medical history and all study assessments.  As is shown in Figure 1 , this 
study is composed of 4 periods.  All randomized subjects will be divided between 2 treatment 
orders in a 1 :1 ratio.  
Figure 1 Illustration of Study Design for Protocol POL- Xe-001 
 
The 4 study periods are defined as : 
• Screening:  Subjects will be screened for study participation based on inclusion a nd 
exclusion criteria.  Informed consent will be obtained and the investigator’s asses sment 
of potential locations of lung resection will be recorded on the electronic case repo rt form 
(eCRF) .  
• Imaging:  Subjects will undergo hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI and 133Xe scintigraphy.  Both 
133Xe scintigraphy and  hyperpola rized 129Xe MRI will be quantified using commercially Screening Imaging Imaging Follow -upHyperpolarized 129Xe

• Imaging Follow -up:  Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_796895] (+3 days) the 
completion of all imaging to collect information on any adverse events ( AEs). 
• Post-op Follow-up:  If the subject  has lung surgery, approximately [ADDRESS_1099228]- operative FEV1 measurement  (spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]) . 
Following completion of screening and baseline eligibility assessmen ts, all subjects will receive 
both a hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI and 133Xe scintigraphy.  During the MRI session, one or more 
proton MRI scans will also be collected to confirm lung anatomical features.   Subjects will 
receive standard of care  at the discretion of the i nvestigator , including appropriate therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
unless otherwise specified  in this protocol.  If a subject undergoes resection surgery, an 
additional study visit to record post- operative FEV1 levels  (spi[INVESTIGATOR_038])  will be required 
approximately 3 months after surgery.   
Safety will be monitored after the administration of both  hyperpolarized  129Xe and 133Xe (Day 1) 
and again on Day 2 during the Imaging Follow -up period.  
The Schedule of Assessments is provided in Appendix 1 .  The study endpoints are provided in 
Section 8.4. 
3.2. Rationale for Study Design and Control  
Study Design:   This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase [ADDRESS_1099229]’s medical history and all study assessments ( Section 5.5).   
Dose:   Dose justification is provided in Section 5.3.2  for hyperpolarized 129Xe and in 
Section  5.3.3  for 133Xe.   
Population Choice:  The proposed study population includes subject s requiring imaging 
evaluation of pulmonary function prior to lung resection surgery.  Subjects being considered for 
surgery normally undergo a full pulmonary evaluation to provide regional lung function 
information used for surgical decisions.  
Control:   Regional lung function information is used for making decisions regarding the need 
for, and predicted success of, resection surgery.  Current practic e for pre -operative evaluation 
employs nuclear scintigraphy methods using 133Xe ventilation and/or Technetium (99mTc) 
Hyperpolarized Xenon (129Xe) gas in the BRANDNAME [CONTACT_796922]:  POL -Xe-001 Amendment 3 Page 18 of 50

 perfusion (the V/Q scan). This permits the patient’s post -operative FEV1 to be estimated based 
on the amount of function that will be removed by [CONTACT_796903].  For the purposes of thi s 
study, 133Xe will be used as the comparator to evaluate the performance of  hyperpolarized 129Xe 
in patients being considered for lung resection surgery.      
3.3. Study Duration and Dates  
Subjects are expected  to participate in this study for a maximum of [ADDRESS_1099230]  32 subjects  will be enrolled in  the study.  Subjects  will be recruited primarily via  cardio -

5. STUDY TREATMENT S 
5.1. Description of Treatment s 
5.1.1.  Study Drug  
The study drug is hyperpolarized 129Xe gas generated from gas cylinders containing Xe/He/N 2 
(Section 6.9.1 ).   
5.1.2.  Active Comparator  
The active comparator (reference standard) is 133Xe gas.    
5.2. Treatments Administered  
5.2.1.  Study Drug  
Up to 750 mL hyperpolarized 129Xe gas will be inflated with ultra -high purity nitrogen (N 2) gas 
to a final volume of 1 L.  To ensure that each dose has sufficient polarization (>10%) , the 
polarization level will be measured at the Polarization Measurement S tation within 5 minutes 
prior to administration.    
Hyperpolarized Xenon (129Xe) gas in the BRANDNAME [CONTACT_796922]:  POL -Xe-001 Amendment 3 Page 20 of 50 
 
Confidential Polarean, Inc.  
 The hyperpolarized 129Xe gas (in N 2) will be administered to the subject  while in the MRI 
scanner.  Subjects will be required to inhale the 1 L of gas mixture and hold their breath for a 
maximum of 15 seconds (generally 10 -15 seconds, based on the length of the scan) while the 
MRI is administered.  
If the resulting scan is determined, or thought to be, inadequate, then a calibration dose  
(approximately 100 mL hyperp olarized 129Xe gas) will be administered followed by [CONTACT_796896] 
(≤750 mL) dose.  The calibration dose will be administered to allow for adjustments of M RI 
parameters, as needed, to ensure best image quality.   If calibration is required, subjects will be 
exposed to hyperpolarized 129Xe for a maximum of 45 seconds.   
During the MRI session, one ore more conventional proton MRI scans will be collected to 
confirm lung anatomical features.  Subjects will be required to take a full inha lation breath of 
room air and hold their breath for a maximum of 15 seconds while the MRI is acquired.    
Detailed information for preparation and administration of hyperpolarized 129Xe gas is provided 
in the IMP Handling and Labeling Instruction Manual  for this study.   
5.2.2.  Active Comparator 
The active comparator, 133Xe, will be administered by [CONTACT_796897] a closed respi[INVESTIGATOR_796884].  Subjects will be exposed to 133Xe gas for 
3-4 minutes as tolerated . 
Detailed information for preparation and administration of 133Xe is provided in the IMP 
Handling and Labeling Instruction Manual  for this study as well as the 133Xe Package Insert .   
5.3. Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient  
5.3.1.  Timing for Performing  Scans  
Imaging  should be performed within the established 48 hour window (refer to the Schedule of 
Events in Appendix 1 ).   
5.3.2.  Hyperpolarized 129Xe Dose Selection  
Since this is a diagnostic drug-device combination, dosing is performed only at the t ime of 
imaging.  To ensure that each dose has sufficient polarizat ion (>10%) for imaging, the 
polarization will be measured within [ADDRESS_1099235] 
gradient echo image acquisition signal- to-noise ratio  (SNR) and voxel volumes from studies 
conducted to date.  The calculated hyperpolarized 129Xe dose equivalent is [ADDRESS_1099236] of Xe volume,

Information regarding safety and nonclinical evaluations of hyperpolarized  129Xe is provided in 
the IB.   
5.3.3.  133Xe Dose Selection  
133Xe will be dosed according to the Package Insert.  Please refer to the IMP Handling and 
Labeling Instuction Manual  for additional details.   
5.4. Method of Assigning Subjects  to Treatment Groups 
All randomized subjects will be divided between 2 treatment orders in a 1:[ADDRESS_1099237] 1 dose of hyperpolarized  129Xe and 1 dose of 133Xe during study 
participation.    
5.5. Blinding 
This is an open- label study (refer to Section 3.2 for rationale) .   
Images generated from this study will be interpreted by [CONTACT_796904]’s 
medical history and all study assessments .  The images will be uploaded in a blinded manner to a 
computer for review.  Both 133Xe scintigraphy  and hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI will be quantified 
using commercially available  software.   
5.6. Concom itant Therapy  
There are no restrictions with respect to concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] f or this study.  All concomitant 
medications should be listed in the electronic case report form (eCRF) along w ith the date 
therapy was initiated, and if applicable, terminated.   
For patients taking inhalers, there are no restrictions with resp ect to timing of dose and imaging.  
However, the last dose administered prior to imaging should be recorded on the eCRF. 
For patients requiring supplemental oxygen, there are no restriction s with respect to timing of 
dose and imaging.  However, the oxygen flow rate should be recorded on the eCRF.   
5.7. Restrictions  
There are no restrictions for this protocol with respect to prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or f ood and fluid intake.   
Hyperpolarized Xenon (129Xe) gas in the BRANDNAME [CONTACT_796922]:  POL -Xe-[ADDRESS_1099238] is at the 
site.  All administration information will be recorded on the eCRF.  
5.9. Packaging and Labeling  
Polarean will provide each of the 3 components of the device (Hyperpolarizer, Polariza tion 
Measurement Station, and Gas Delivery Bag) to the site.  Gas cy linders containing the Xe/He/N [ADDRESS_1099239] normally required labeling upon site receipt.   
Labeling instructions for the hyperpolarized 129Xe in the Gas Delivery Bag are provided in the 
IMP Handling and Labeling Instruction Manual .   
5.10. Storage and Accountability 
The components of the device (Hyperpolarizer an d Hyperpolarization Measurement Station) will 
be stored in an area located in a separate area (or room) close to the MRI suite.   
The Investigator (or delegate) will maintain accountability records  for the receipt, dispensing, 
and return of all study products (including the gas cylinders used to make the study drug) .  
Records will include (but not limited to):   
• The receipt of the gas cylinders to be used for study drug preparation;   
• Updated  inventory of the gas cylinders, and 
• The return of empty or unused cylinders.  
5.11. Investigational Product Retention at Study Site  
During and at the end of the study, the number of gas cylinders will be reconcil ed against current 
inventory and dispensing records as part of routine monitoring visits.  After reconci liation, 
unused (full) gas cylinders will be returned to the Sponsor.    
Additionally, during and at the end of the study, the use of tedlar bags, tubing, and mouth pi[INVESTIGATOR_796886] r outine monitori ng 
visits.  Items that have been used should be disposed of in a biohazard bag.  After reconcil iation, 
all unused components will be returned to the Sponsor.    
6. STUDY PROCEDURES  
The Schedule of Assessments is provided in Appendix 1 .  All assessments and treatments are to 
be performed either at a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_36222] a doctor’s office.

is unable to sign) after the nature of the study has been fully explained in accor dance with 
International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practices (G CP).  Informed 
consent must be obtained prior to performing any study- specific procedures.  
6.2. Demographics, Medical History , and Concomitant Medications 
Demographic information (age, race, gender, weight, height, smoking history, etc.) will be 
collected during the Screenin g Period.  Medical history, including significant medical conditions , 
pulmonary function values, and surgical history, will also be collected  during the Screening 
Period.  Additionally, any medications taken as well as baseline signs and sympt oms occurring 
within 2  weeks of screening will be recorded .    
On the day(s) of the Imaging Period , any changes to the subject’s condition that affect 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be documented , as well as  any additional medications taken.  
Subject must meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria upon entering the Imaging Period. 
6.3. Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include blood pressure (BP, systolic and diastolic measurements), heart rate 
(HR), respi[INVESTIGATOR_2844], blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2) and temperature .  Vital signs  will be 
assessed during the Screening Period as well as before and after each scanning session  (both 
129Xe and 133Xe) during the Imaging Period .  Subjects will have a [ADDRESS_1099241] will be monitored for the duration of the MRI exam by [CONTACT_796905].   
6.3.1.  Heart Rate  
HR will be assessed during the Screening Period as well as befo re and after each scanning 
session (both 129Xe and 133Xe) during the Imaging Period.  Changes in HR of >20% are 
considered significant.  The next dose of any study treatment will not be administ ered until the 
HR is within 20% of the baseline value.  If the subject has received their last dose, t hey will be 
observed until the HR is within 20% of the baseline value.   
6.3.2.  Blood Oxygen Saturation 
SpO 2 will be assessed during the Screening Period as well as  before (within 5 minutes)  and after 
(within 1 minute) each scanning session  (both 129Xe and 133Xe) during the Imaging Period .  An 
absolute decrease of SpO 2 by >10% is considered significant.  The next dose of any study 
treatment will not be administered until the SpO 2 is within 10% of the baseline value.  I f the 
Hyperpolarized Xenon (129Xe) gas in the BRANDNAME [CONTACT_796922]:  POL -Xe-[ADDRESS_1099242] dose, they will be observed until the SpO 2 is within 10% of the 
baseline value.   
If the subject’s SpO 2 value does not return to within 10 % of the baseline value  within a few 
minutes (2 -5 minutes), supplemental oxygen should be provided until values are within range.  
Once the value is within range, the subject can proceed to the next  dose.   
6.4. Baseline Physical Exam  
A standard physical exam will be performed during the Screening Period.   Baseline findings will 
be recorded on the eCRF.  
6.5. Clinical Laboratory Tests  
A negative serum pregnancy test must be confirmed at Screening for all femal es of childbearing 
potential.  A blood sample for serum pregnancy testing will be taken from all females of 
childbearing potential at Screening.  If the serum pregnancy t est is positive, the patient must be 
discontinued from study treatment, unless subject is post-partum. 
6.6. MRI -suitable Screening  
As indicated in exclusion criteria # 5 (Section 4.3 ), a subject who requires anesthesia or heavy 
sedation  in order to undergo MRI testing cannot participate in this study.  However, mild 
sedation  (i.e. a low dose oral acting anxiolytic medication such as alpraz olam) could be 
acceptable if, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the subject is still able to comply with all study 
procedures.   
There are no additional protocol specific requirements o r restrictions with respect to a subject 
being suitable for MRI testing.   
6.7. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_796881]1  
Pulmonary function will be evaluated by [CONTACT_796906]1  using spi[INVESTIGATOR_796887] 1 (Imaging Period).   For the sub-set of subjects undergoing surgery, FEV1 will also be 
measured  during the Post-op Follow-up Period.     
6.8. Image Interpretation  
As indicated in Section 5.5, image interpretation will be performed by [CONTACT_140813] .  Details 
for performing image evaluation are provided in the Imaging  Manual .

 dose has sufficient polarization, the polarization will be measured within 5 minutes  prior to 
administration to ensure the value is >10%.   
Additional information for preparation and administration of hyperpolarized 129Xe gas are 
provided in Section 5.2.1  as well as the IMP Handling and Labeling Instuction Manual  for this 
study.   
6.9.2.  Anatomical Proton MRI (MRI Session Only) 
During the MRI session, one ore more conventional proton MRI scans will be collected to 
confirm lung anatomical features.  Subjects will be required to take a full inha lation breath of 
room air and hold their breath for a maximum of 15 seconds while the MRI is acquired.    
6.9.3.  Active Comparator – 133Xe Administration  
The active comparator, 133Xe, will be administered in accordance with the Package Insert.  
Detailed information for prep aration and administration of 133Xe gas are provided in the IMP 
Handling and Labeling Instruction Manual  for this study.   
6.10. Adverse Events Assessments  
AEs will be reported using the current version of the Medical Dictionary for Regula tory 
Activities (MedDRA).   
The investigator (and any sub -investigators) is responsible for the appropriate medical care of 
subject s during the study.  The investigator remains responsible for following, through an 
appropriate health care option, serious adverse events ( SAEs ) or AEs that caused the subject to 
discontinue before completing the study.  The subject  should be followed until the event is 
resolved or explained.  Frequency of follow-up evaluation is left to the discretion of t he 
investigator.  
6.10.1.  Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject  participating in a clinical 
investigation/study that has received treatment with  a drug or biologic (medicinal ) product.  The 
event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the administration of  the study drug.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporall y 
associated with the use of a study drug, whether or  not considered related to the study drug.  This 
includes any side effect, injury, toxicity, o r sensitivity reaction, and may include a single 
symptom or sign, a set of related symptoms or signs, or a disease.  An AE may also be any 
laboratory abnormality judged to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_737] (or sub-
investigator) that worsened when compared to baseline.   
Hyperpolarized Xenon (129Xe) gas in the BRANDNAME [CONTACT_796922]:  POL -Xe-001 Amendment 3 Page 27 of 50 
 
Confidential Polarean, Inc.  
 An abnormal laboratory value is not an AE unless it is considered to be clinically sig nificant.  
AEs include the following: 
• All suspect ed adverse drug reactions. 
• All reactions from medication overdose, abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity, or toxicit y. 
• Apparently unrelated illnesses, including the worsening of a pre- existing illness.  
• Injury or accidents.  Note that if a medical condition is known to have caused the injury 
or accident (e.g., a fall secondary to dizziness), the medical condition (dizzine ss) and the 
accident (fall) should be reported as 2 separate AEs.  
• Abnormalities in physiological testing or physical examination (finding s that r equire 
clinical intervention or further investigation beyond ordering a repeat [confirma tory] 
test).  
• Laboratory abnormalities that are clinically significant and requ ire clinical intervention or 
further investigation (beyond ordering a repeat [confirmatory ] test) unless they are 
associated with an already reported clinical event.   
An AE does not include: 
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, trans fusion); 
the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE. 
• Pre-existing  diseases or conditions present or detected at screening/baseline that do not 
worsen in severity or frequency. 
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_796888], social and/or convenience admission s). 
• Overdose of either study drug or concomitant medication without any signs or sym ptoms. 
Throughout the course of the study, every effort should be made to remain alert to poss ible AEs.  
Subject s should be encouraged to report AEs spontaneously or in response to general, non-
directed questioning. 
With the occurrence of an AE, the primary concern is the safety of the subject.  If necessary , 
appropriate medical intervention should be provided, and the study drug discontinued.  Urgent 
safety issues may be  discussed with physicians at the Contract Research Organization (CRO).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Subjective sensation of residual anesthesia (e.g., lightheadedness, loss of sens ation or awareness, 
loss of memory, or unconsciousness) is an AE of special interest for this study .  The next dose of 
any study treatment will not be administered until any sensation of r esidual analgesia has 
resolved.  If the subject has received their last dose, they will be observed unti l the sensation of 
residual ana lgesia has resolved.

 [IP_ADDRESS].  Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is defined by [CONTACT_282345] a ny AE occurring at any dose that results in any of 
the following outcomes:  
• Death.  
• A life -threatening AE (i.e., immediate risk of death)  
Note:  The term “life -threat ening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in 
which the subject  was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not r efer to an event  
which , hypothetically , might have caused death if it were more severe.  
• Prolongation of existing hospi [INVESTIGATOR_257353] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threa tening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgme nt, the 
AE may jeopardize the subject  and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dys crasias 
or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Unexpected Adverse Event 
An unexpected AE is any AE that is not identified in nature, severity, or frequency in the current 
IB or product information.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction  
An adverse drug reaction ( ADR ) is an adverse reaction, the severity of which is not consistent 
with the applicable product information or IB.  All noxious and unintended responses to a 
medical product related to any dose should be considered an ADR.   
• The phrase “responses to a medicinal product” means that a causal relat ionship between a 
medicinal product and an AE is at least a re asonable possibility (meaning the relationship 
cannot be ruled out).   
• The expression “causal relationship” is meant to convey that , in general , there are facts, 
evidence , or arguments to suggest a reasonable causal relationship.  All serious and 
unexpecte d ADRs will have expedited reporting to regulatory agencies following ICH 
requirements.   
Hyperpolarized Xenon (129Xe) gas in the BRANDNAME [CONTACT_796922]:  POL -Xe-[ADDRESS_1099243] been 
caused by a protocol procedure.   
All AEs (both serious and non-serious) must be assessed through the Imaging Follow -up Period.  
All measures required for AE management and the ultimate outcome of the AE must be  recorded 
in the eCRF  and reported to the Sponsor.  All study -drug related AEs m ust be followed until 
resolution, the return to baseline, or until the event is deemed stable or irreversibl e.   
In addition, any known untoward event that occurs subsequent to the AE-reporting period that  
the investigator assesses as related to the study drug should also be reported as an AE and must 
be recorded in the eCRF .   
6.10.3.  Recording Adverse Events 
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to review all  documentation 
(e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory, and diagnostic reports) relative to t he event.  The 
Investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an  AE/SAE in the eCRF.   All 
details of any treatments initiated due to the AE should also be recorded in the subjec ts’ notes 
and the eCRF.  
All AEs will be do cumented in the appropriate section of the eCRF.  Among these AEs, all SAEs 
(refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) will be additionally documented in an SAE Report.  The follo wing 
will be recorded for each event  on the eCRF:  
• A description of the AE in medical terms, not as reported by [CONTACT_423].  Whenever 
possible, a diagnosis should be given when signs and symptoms are due to common 
etiology (e.g., cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be 
reported as “upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]”). 
• The date of onset (start date).  
• The date of resolution (stop date). 
• The severity as assessed by [CONTACT_796907] i n Section  6.10.4 . 
• The causal relationship to study drug as assessed by [CONTACT_3170]; the decisive factor 
in the documentation is the temporal relation between the AE and the study drug (re fer to 
Section 6.10.5 ).  
Hyperpolarized Xenon (129Xe) gas in the BRANDNAME [CONTACT_796922]:  POL -Xe-001 Amendment 3 Page 30 of 50 
 
Confidential Polarean, Inc.  
 • Action taken for study drug (none, study drug discontinued, study drug dose reduction, 
study d rug delayed).  
• Other action(s) taken (none, concomitant medication given, new or prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], procedural surgery). 
• The outcome according to the following definitions: 
o Recovered with sequelae;  
o Recovered without sequelae; 
o Ongoing, no therapy; 
o Ongoing, therapy; 
o Died, or 
o Change in toxicity grade/severity.  
• Serious Adverse Event (as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ):  yes or no. 
If, in any subject, the same AE occ urs on several occasions (unless the AE is continuous and of 
stable grade), then the AE in question will be documented and assessed each time.  For an SAE , 
the information listed above to be recorded in the eCRF will also be recorded in the SAE  Report.  
Only AEs that fulfill the criteria for SAEs (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) should be recorded in the 
SAE Report. 
6.10.4.  Assessing Adverse Event Severity  
To ensure there is no confusion or misunderstanding of the difference between the terms  
“serious” and “severe”, which are not synonymous, the following note of clarifi cation is 
provided: 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severi ty) of a specific event (as in 
mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may  be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache).   
This i s not the same as “serious”, which is based on subject /event outcome or action criteria 
usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject ’s life or functioning.  
Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory report ing ob ligations.  
All AEs are to be evaluated with respect to severity using:  
• Mild;  
• Moderate, or 
• Severe.  
6.10.5.  Assessing Adverse Event Relationship to Study Drug 
The investigator (or sub -investigator) must record his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_796889].  Investigators will determine relatedness of an event to 
Hyperpolarized Xenon (129Xe) gas in the BRANDNAME [CONTACT_796922]:  POL -Xe-[ADDRESS_1099244] ’s clinical course, previous medical conditions, and concomitant 
medications.  An event should be recorded as “drug related” if the investigator believe s it to be 
reasonably related to study drug.  
6.10.6.  Reporting Adverse Events 
Each AE is to be classified by [CONTACT_733805]-serious.  This cl assification 
determines the reporting procedures to be followed ( Table 1).   
Table 1 Reporting Requirements for Adverse Events  
Gravity Reporting Time  Type of Report  
Serious Within 24 hours Complete AE eCRF  
Non-serious Per eCRF submission procedure Appropriate AE eCRF 
 
6.10.7.  Reporting Serious or Unexpected Adverse Events 
Any SAE, irrespective of the relationship to Study Drug, that occurs during the cour se of the 
study (from the first dose of study treatment during the Imaging Period  up to and including the 
Imaging Follow -up Period) will be reported on the eCRF as soon as possible (within 24 hours 
after the site becomes aware of the event).   
The investigator is encouraged to discuss with the Pharmacovigilance  group any AE for which 
the issue of reportability is unclear or questioned.   
An SAE Report should be prepared, containing as much available information concerning t he 
event as possible, so that a written report can be filed with the appropriate regulatory authorities.  
If causality cannot be definitively assessed at the time of the SAE, it is important to notify the 
Sponsor, or its designee, within the timelines stated in Table [ADDRESS_1099245] 
further information for a detailed description and a final evaluation of the case, including  copi[INVESTIGATOR_421862], autopsy reports, or other relevant documents.  Any SAE follow-up 
information requested by [CONTACT_1034] ( or its designee) should be provided in a timely manner  to 
ensure that the SAE report is made to regulatory authorities within the requested timeframe.   
The Investigator, or Sponsor where applicable, will notify the relevant Institutional Review 
Borad ( IRB) of any SAEs and safety reports acc ording to local regulation requirements.

Confidential Polarean, Inc.  
 6.10.8.  Follow-Up of Adverse Events 
All AEs (both serious and non-serious) should be followed through the end of the observation 
period or until resolution, whichever is longer .  All measures required for AE management , as 
well as  the ultimate outcome of the AE , must be recorded in the source document and reported to 
the Sponsor. 
6.11. Removal of Subject s from the Study or Study Drug 
The investigator may withdraw a subject from study participation  for any of the following 
reasons:  
• A significant protocol violation occurs; 
• A serious or intolerable AE occurs ; 
• The sponsor or investigator terminates the study, or 
• The subject  requests to be discontinued from the study. 
6.12. Discontinuation of Study Sites 
Study site participation may be discon tinued if the Sponsor, investigator, or the IRB of the study 
site judges it necessary for any reason.  
6.13. Discontinuation of the Study 
The study will be discontinued if the Sponsor judges it necessary for any reason . 
6.14. Appropriateness of Measurements  
All procedu res and assessments used to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hyperpolarized 129Xe 
are widely used and generally regarded as reliable, accurate , and relevant.   Pulmonary function 
tests are used to evaluate potential post -operative risks and complications in patients considering 
lung surgery ( Wang, 2004 ).  The specific tests used in this protocol to assess pulmonary 
function, FEV1 , and ventilation assessments, are both commonly used assessments in this patient 
population.   
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE  
A study start -up/investigator training will be held for all sites prior to first subject  enrollment.  
To ensure accurate, complete, and reliable data, the Sponsor or its representative s will: 
• Provide instructional material to the study sites, as appropriat e. 
Hyperpolarized Xenon (129Xe) gas in the BRANDNAME [CONTACT_796922]:  POL -Xe-001 Amendment 3 Page 33 of 50 
 
Confidential Polarean, Inc.  
 • Conduct a start-up training session to instruct the investigators and study coordina tors.  
This session will give instruction on the protocol, the completion of the eCRF, and study 
procedures. 
• Make periodic visits to the study site.  
• Be available for con sultation and stay in contact [CONTACT_86203], 
telephone, and/or fax. 
• Review and evaluate eCRF data and use standard computer edits to detect  errors in data 
collection.  
• Conduct a quality review of the database. 
In addition, the Sponso r or its representatives may periodically check a sample of su bject  data 
recorded against source documents at the study site.  The study may be audited by  [CONTACT_353074], and/or regulatory agencies at any time.  I nvestigators will be gi ven notice 
before an audit occurs. 
To ensure the safety of participants in the study, and to ensure accurate, complet e, and reliable 
data, the investigator will keep records of laboratory tests, clinical notes, and m edical records in 
the subject ’s files as original source documents for the study.  If requested, the I nvestigator will 
provide the sponsor, applicable regulatory agencies, and applicable ethical review  boards with 
direct access to original source documents.  
8. PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
8.1. Determination of Sample  Size 
The sample size required to demonstrate equivalence is driven by 2 factors: 1) the i ntra- subject 
variability of the difference between the predicted post -operative FEV1 from the 2 methods, and 
2) the pre- specified equivalence ma rgin.  From prior literature, the intra -subject variability for 
133Xe scintigraphy leads to an estimated variability in predicted pos t-operative FEV1 of 
0.21 L/sec.  Similarly, prior studies have suggested that the equivalence margin bet ween the 
2 imaging techniques currently used for resection planning is 0.3 L/sec.  Using these 
assumptions, and based on the use of a two- sided test at the alpha=0.05 level of significance, a 
sample size of 15 subjects is required for 90% power.  However, given limited lite rature on 133Xe 
variability, we have accounted  for the possibility that it could be higher .  If true variability is 
0.32 L/sec, then a sample size of 32 subjects will provide 90% power to establish equivalence .   
Hyperpolarized Xenon (129Xe) gas in the BRANDNAME [CONTACT_796922]:  POL -Xe-[ADDRESS_1099246] populations:   
• Efficacy Population :  The efficacy  analysis set will consist of all subjects that have both a 
129Xe MRI scan and a 133Xe scintigraphy scan .  Primary and the 6 -zone analysis 
secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the efficacy  analysis set.    
• Post-operative Population:  This analysis set will consist of all subjects that  have both a 
129Xe MRI scan and a 133Xe scintigraphy scan, and have a post- operative FEV1  
(spi[INVESTIGATOR_96656])  value.   
• Safety:  The safety analysis set will consist of all subjects w ho received at least 1 dose of 
either hyperpolarized 129Xe or 133Xe.  Secondary safety endpoints will be analyzed using 
the Safety analysis set.   
8.3. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Patients’ age, height, weight, and baseline characteristics (including smoki ng history) will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics, while gender, race, and  other categorical variables will 
be provided using frequency tabulations.  Medical history will be summarized using fre quency 
tabulations by [CONTACT_9313]  (SOC)  and preferred term.  
8.4. Study Endpoints  
8.4.1.  Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary endpoint is the scan predicted post-operative FEV1.  The scans will be quantified 
using commercially available  software to report the fraction of activity arising from [ADDRESS_1099247]-operative FEV1 value (spi[INVESTIGATOR_208403]) and the 
percentage function contributed by [CONTACT_796899] 6 lung zones.   
8.4.3.  Secondary Safety Endpoints 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed based on the incidence and  severity of treatment 
emergent AEs and SAEs.  Additionally, subjects will be monitored before, during, and after each 
dose to monitor for changes in vital signs.

8.7. Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
The post- operative secondary analysis for this study will be to test t he mean difference in 
predicted post-operative FEV1 (measured in L/sec) values as measured using h yperpolarized 
129Xe gas MRI and 133Xe scintigraphy (reference standard) relative to the final post- operative 
FEV1 value (spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]).  The secondary equivalence analysis will  be conducted using the same 
methodology and same equivalence margin as specified for the primary analysis . 
The [ADDRESS_1099250] been demons trated if the 95% CI for the mean difference is 
contained within the interval (-5 %, + 5%). 
8.8. Safety Analysis  
All safety analyses will be performed on the Safety population, unless otherwise stated.  
AEs will be coded using MedDRA terminology.  Events are defined as AEs if the y start or 
worsen after a subject's administration of study drug.  All AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_2946], 
preferred term, severity and relationship to study drug.  AEs leading to death or  to 
discontinuation from study drug and SAEs will also b e tabulated.  In the by-subject summary, a 
subject having the same event more than once will be counted only once and by [CONTACT_617246].  
Vital signs , including change from baseline, will be summarized .

Confidential Polarean, Inc.  
 Prior and concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organizati on (WHO) 
Drug dictionary.  Concomitant medications will be summarized descriptively.  The summary 
tables will show the number and percentage of subjects by [CONTACT_11702].  Subjects who take the 
same medication (in terms of the preferred term) more than once will only be count ed once for 
that medication.  Prior and concomitant medications will be listed separately.  
8.9. Interim Analysis  
No formal interim  analyses are planned for thi s study.   
9. ADMINISTRATIVE CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1. Institutional Review Board  Approval 
The study protocol and ICF, as well as any amendments, will be approved by [CONTACT_941] a ppropriate 
ethical review board (IRB) prior to initiation of the study at a p articular site.  All subject s will 
sign an ICF prior to any study-specific procedures.  Site performance during t he study will be 
routinely monitored by a study monitor (refer to Section 9.5).   
Documentation of ethical review board approval of the protocol and ICF must be provided to the 
Sponsor before  the study may begin at the study sites.  The IRB will review the protocol and ICF 
as required in accordance with the ICH GCP guidelines.  Any member of the IRB who is directly 
affiliated with this study as an Investigator or as site personnel must abs tain from the vote on the 
approval of the protocol. 
In the event of an SAE, the Investigator, or Sponsor where applicable, wil l notify the relevant 
IRB of any SAEs and safety reports according to local regulation requirement s (refer to 
Section  6.10.7  for more information regarding reporting of SAEs).  
9.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study 
This study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have t heir origin in 
the Declaratio n of Helsinki and that are consistent with GCPs and the applicable laws and 
regulations.  The Investigator, head of the medical institution, or designee will pr omptly submit 
the protocol to applicable ethical review boards. 
This investigational product is being studied in the US under an IND application.  Study sites

is unable to sign) afte r the nature of the study has been fully explained , in accordance with ICH 
GCPs.  Informed consent must be obtained during the Screening Period prior to performi ng any 
study-specific procedures.  The consent form that is used must be approved by [CONTACT_796909].  
The subject  (or legal representative) and the individual explaining the study will sign the  current 
IRB-approved version of the consent form.  A copy of the signed consent form will be given to 
the subject .  The date that consent was obtained will be recorded i n the eCRF as well as the 
subject ’s chart.   
A copy of the IRB approved version of the consent form will be provided to the Sponsor.  The 
original signed consent form must be maintained at the site and made available for  inspection, as 
appropriate.   
9.4. Patient  Confidentiality  
The anonymity of subject s participating in this study must be maintained.  Subjects will be 
identified by [CONTACT_796910].  Site documents that are not submitted to the S ponsor 
or its designees and that identify the subject  (e.g., signed informed consent; source 
documents/charts) will be made available to the Sponsor (or its designees) or  regulatory 
authorities for inspections, but will be otherwise maintained in confidence. 
All study -related information provided by [CONTACT_796911] a nd not 
previously published ( including but not limited to the active study agent identity, the IB, the 
study protocol, verbal and written communication, study data, assay methods and scientific data ), 
will be considered confidential.  In addition, all information developed during the conduct  of the 
clinical investigation of the study agent is also considered conf idential.  Neither the Investigator 
nor any of his/her employees or agents shall disclose or use this information for an y purpose 
other than the performance of the clinical study.  Such information shall remain t he confidential 
and proprietary property of the Sponsor, and disclosure to others will be limited to other 
physicians who are conducting studies with the same active study agent, the I RB, and the 
applicable regulatory authorities except by [CONTACT_796912] S ponsor or its agents.  
At such time, that information becomes widely and publicly availab le through no fault of the 
Investigator, the obligation of nondisclosure toward that particular information will  cease.

 9.5. Study Monitoring 
The Sponsor’s clinical research physician will monitor safety data throughout  the course of the 
program .  All SAEs will  be reviewed within time frames mandated by [CONTACT_796913].     
All deaths and SAE reports will be reviewed by [CONTACT_6098] d uring the program .  These 
reports will be reviewed to assure completeness and accuracy.  
To ensure the safety of participants in the program, and to ensure accurate, complet e, and reliable 
data, the Investigator will keep records of laboratory tests, clinical notes , and subject  medical 
records in the subject files as original source documents for the program.  If requested, the 
Investigator will provide the Sponsor, applicable regulatory agencies, and applic able ethical 
review boards with direct access to original source documents. 
The Sponsor or designee will assure the accuracy of data, the selection of qualif ied Investigators, 
appropriate program centers, and review protocol procedures with the Investiga tors and 
associated personnel prior to the program and during periodic monitoring visits.  The S ponsor or 
a designee will review CRFs for acc uracy and completeness during on- site monitoring visits and 
after their return from the clinical site.  Discrepancies will be re solved with the Investigator as 
appropriate. 
The Sponsor or its designee will monitor the program using any of the following me thods: 
• Telephone contacts;  
• Site visits , and 
• Review of original patient records, CRFs, drug accountability, s torage, and general 
program documentation. 
So that the program may be adequately monitored, the Investigator will coopera te in providing 
the Sponsor’s designee with all program documents (e.g., subject  charts and program files) and 
responding to inquiries that may arise as a result of the document review. 
Review of these documents will usually occur during a routine monitoring visit, but  may also be 
required during a visit by a quality assurance auditor.  The Sponsor reserves the right  to 
terminate the program if access to source documentation of work performed in this  program is 
denied to the Sponsor or regulatory representatives. 
9.6. Case Report F orms and Study Records  
An eCRF will be provided for each study subject .  Data collected through the completion of 
study procedures required by [CONTACT_796914]’s chart as source 
documentation.  This data will then be transcribed onto t he eCRF.   
Hyperpolarized Xenon (129Xe) gas in the BRANDNAME [CONTACT_796922]:  POL -Xe-[ADDRESS_1099253]’s medical records.  All medical records, 
laboratory printouts, notes made by [CONTACT_099], a nd other materials , such as x -rays, will be 
considered source data and must be available for inspection by [CONTACT_1034], the Sponsor’s 
delegates, or government representatives.   
Appropriate training prior to study initiation at that site will be condu cted to assist with making 
entries and corrections to data entered into an eCRF.  The Investigator remains r esponsible for 
the accuracy and adequacy of all data entered on the eCRF.   
Data will be monitored as described in Section 9.5.  Under direction of the clinical monitor, 
eCRFs will be verified, locked , and submitted for data entry and analysis.  A copy of each eCRF 
page must remain at the investigative site in the ap propriate subject’s eCRF file.  Data entered 
into eCRFs will be monitored by [CONTACT_796915] .   
Upon further data processing, queries may be generated and sent to the Investi gator for 
clarification or correction.  The Investigator will address any queries and f orward resolutions as 
directed by [CONTACT_25007].   
9.7. Data Disclosure  
The Investigator agrees by [CONTACT_5657]/her participation that the results of thi s study may be used for 
submission to national and/or international registration and supervising authoritie s.  As required, 
authorities will be provided with the names of the Investigators, their addresses, qualifications, 
and extent of involvement.  The Investigator is required to provide the Sponsor , or its designee,  
with all  study data, complete reports, and access to all study records.  
Data generated by [CONTACT_796916], the Sponsor or its designee, and the IRB, as appropriate.  At a subject’s  request, 
medical information may be given to his or her personal physician or other appropriate me dical 
personnel responsible for his or her welfare.  Subject medical information obtained duri ng the 
course of this study is confidential and disclosure to third parties other than those  noted above is 
prohibited. 
9.8. Retention of Data

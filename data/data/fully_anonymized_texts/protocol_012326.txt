 Page 7 of 21
 Template  Revised  On: 09/01/2019  1.0 Objectives  
1.1 Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine if a single dose of 
sublingual sufentanil given 15 -30 minutes prior to wake up is efficacious at 
reducing initial PACU pain scores . 
2.0 Background  
2.1 Significance of Research Question/Purpose: This study will help to 
determine the appropriate timing for the use of sublingual sufentanil in an 
ambulatory surgery practice.  
2.2 Preliminary Data: N/A  
2.3 Existing Literature: This is a follow up study to a prospective randomized trial giv ing sublingual sufentanil immediately upon a pain score of [ADDRESS_302306]  
performed similar to IV fentanyl  (STUDY00007956). SST is an opi[INVESTIGATOR_248622] -operative setting. Of note, 
sublingual medications are frequently given in this setting without complications however. The half -life of SST is [ADDRESS_302307] has no change in mental status when given in an 
emergency room setting and has a safe adverse event profile when used in various inpatient surgical procedures.  
3.0 Study Endpoints/Events/Outcomes  
3.1 Primary Endpoint/Event/Outcome:  
Initial NRS pain score  upon arrival to PACU  (11 point 0 -10 scale; 0 being no 
pain, 10 being maximum imaginable pain) .  
Superiority  
H0: no significant difference in initial NRS pain score  
HA: decreased mean initial NRS pain score of 2 points  or greater for 
Group 1  (≥2 chosen as evidence suggests this is a clinically 
significant decrease)  
 Secondary Endpoint(s)/Event(s)/Outcome(s):

 Template  Revised  On: 09/01/2019  Length of time in PACU (recording both Phase 1, Phase 2, and total duration 
measured in minutes; as is standardly recorded for every case) . 
Superiority  
H0: no significant difference in recovery room duration  
HA: decreased  recovery room duration for the SST group  
 Additional outcomes: Opi[INVESTIGATOR_248623] (medication type and dose, these will also be converted to milligram morphine equivalents for 
overall summation and comparison) , NRS pain score upon discharge from 
PACU, reduction in pain from initial to discharge  pain scores,  PONV (defined 
as treated) and any other adverse events , OBAS score, and anesthesia 
wake -up time (duration i n minutes  from procedure closure  to removal of 
endotracheal tube or laryngeal mask airway).  
4.0 Study Intervention(s) /Investigational Agent(s)  
4.1 Description: 15-30 minutes prior to planned emergence from anesthesia 
patients will either receive 30 mcg of sublingu al sufentanil or nothing 
dispensed by [CONTACT_248635]. Envelopes will be used for them to discover the randomization 
group and distributed in order according to a randomization scheme provided by [CONTACT_248636]. Upon arrival in the ASC PACU, patient’s pain 
will be assessed. There the patient will receive IV fentanyl for a pain score of 4 or greater ( 25-50 mcg doses of Fentanyl, up to 100mcg if needed). If 
100 mcg of fentanyl is given and pain remains  above a 7 then IV 
hydromorphone will be used (max dose of 1 mg and given in increments of 0.3 mg q 10 minutes prn severe pain). Once the patient is able to tolerate oral medications a dose of 5 mg of oral oxycodone (or 2 mg of oral hydromorphone if allergic to oxycodone) will be given if t heir pain score is 4 
or greater (on the Numerical Rating Scale). This PACU process is all similar 
to the standard process and medications that would be used in standard care, standardized for study purposes. OBAS and final pain score will be 
assessed just prior to discharge from the PACU by [CONTACT_248637] . If they request assistance a research coordinator will help ask 
and record this.  
4.2 Drug/Device Handling: Sublingual sufentanil will be stored in the OR  
anesthesia pyxis like other controlled substances.

 Template  Revised  On: 09/01/2019  5.1 Study Design:  This is a level I randomized prospective outcomes study 
comparing two groups of patients.  Within 15 -30 minutes of planned wake -
up Group 1 will receive 30 mcg of sublingual sufentanil and group 2 will not 
receive sublingual sufentanil.  
5.2 Study Procedures: Pa tients will be approached on the day of surgery about 
participating in the trial  after being screened for eligibility (inclusion per 
negative pregnancy test for women of child- bearing age) . This will be done 
as soon as they arrive at the ASC to allow adequate time for them to review 
the study procedures and consent forms.  All questions will be answered 
and patients will be ensured that they have adequate time to review and understand all study procedures.  Patients undergoing orthopedic surgical procedures  with general anesthesia will be eligible to participate.  
All patients will have standardized opi[INVESTIGATOR_248624].  No opi[INVESTIGATOR_248625] i s increased by 20% above baseline.  
Within 15 -30 minutes of wakeup patients will be randomized to receive 
either 30 mcg of sublingual sufentanil or nothing. There is no need for a placebo as the patient will be under anesthesia.  No additional 
intraoperativ e opi[INVESTIGATOR_248626].  
Once in the PACU patients initial pain will be assessed and recorded. There the patient will receive IV fentanyl for a pain score of 4 or greater ( 25-50 
mcg doses of Fentanyl , up to 100 mcg  if needed). If  100 mcg of fen tanyl is 
given and pain remains above a 7 then IV hydromorphone will be used (max dose of 1 mg and given in increments of 0.3 mg q 10 minutes prn severe pain). Once the patient is able to tolerate oral medications a dose of 5 mg of oral oxycodone (or 2 mg of oral hydromorphone if allergic to oxycodone) will be given if their pain score is 4 or greater (on the Numerical Rating 
Scale) . This PACU process is all similar to the standard process and 
medications that would be used in standard care, standardized for study purposes. OBAS and final pain score will be assessed just prior to discharge from the PACU by [CONTACT_248638] . OBAS is a standard 
survey asking seven questions regarding grade of distress from several possible symptoms and can be done very quickly. This will be recorded on the instruction sheet.  
Time until readiness to discharge,  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], pain score s and basel ine 
demographics such as surgical procedure, intraoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], surgical procedure length, ASA class, BMI, weight, age, and sex will be recorded.

10.1 Local Number of Participants to be Consented: Minimum of 50 and 
maximum of 65 
11.0 Local Recruitment Methods  
11.1 Recruitment Process: Patients will be recruited from the group of adult 
patients undergoing orthopedic surgery at the University of Minnesota Ambulatory Surgery Center. On the day of surgery as soon as they are checked in, patients will be informed of a research opportunity by a member of the clinical care staff, including the check -in staff, nursing staff, 
or member of the anesthesiology team, and asked if they are interested in talking with a member of the rese arch team.  A research team member will 
then explain the study and present the consent form.  All patients will have sufficient time to review this, ask questions and go over the potential risks of the study with the research team as they arrive several hours prior to the procedure.  If they decide to participate they will be consented and provided a copy of the consent form.  
11.2 Identification of Potential Participants: Patients will be identified by 
[CONTACT_140307].  Patients who have opted out of research will not be approached.  Patients who agree to participate will sign the  combined consent and HIPAA 
authorization form .

12.0 Withdrawal of Participants  
12.1 Withdrawal Circumstances : Subjects who have consented and later choose 
not to participate for any reason will be withdrawn and a notation will be 
made in the study records. The surgeon may choose to withdraw the patient from the study prior to  surgery for any medical reason or if they 
suffer a major life -threatening adverse event.  
12.2 Withdrawal Procedures: If the patient is withdrawn from study prior to the 
procedure, for example if they change their mind before induction of 
anesthesia in the operating room, they will be noted in study records as screen failures. If they undergo the procedure and they decide for any reason they no longer want to be included in the study or are withdrawn by 
[CONTACT_099], they will be withdrawn and no further data w ill be collected.  
This will also be noted in the study documentation.  
12.3 Termination Procedures: If the study is terminated for any reason, or there are more than 5% major adverse events the data that is already collected will be stored in a secure location only accessible to research personnel on this study.  No further data will be collected if the study is terminated. Existing data may still be sent to the biostatistician in the manner as described in the protocol  to help determine if it is sufficient for any 
conclusions.  
13.0 Risks to Participants  
13.1 Foreseeable Risks:  
Medication risks include:  
• Life threatening respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]  
• Addiction, abuse, and misuse  
• Adrenal insufficiency  
• Severe hypotension  
• Gastrointestinal adverse reactions  
• Seizures  
These risks are the st andard risks of using opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], the standard of care for 
treating surgical pain. Sublingual sufentanil is already used as an analgesic 
option  at University of MN ASC.  
The Department of Anesthesiology has an adverse event and serious 
adverse event reporting standard operating procedure in place to define, 
record, report and evaluate adverse events  based on the International 
Conference on Harmonization guidelines.

low level of inconvenience or concern  with the therapeutic measures. 
Moderate events may cause some  interference with functioning.  Severe – 
Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require 
systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe  events are usually 
potentially life -threatening or incapacitating. Of  note, the term “severe” 
does not necessarily equate to “serious”.]  
RELATED : Related – The AE is known to occur with the study  intervention, 
there is a reasonable possibility that the study  intervention caused the AE, 
or there is a temporal relationship between the study intervention and 
event. Reasonable possibilit y means that there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the study intervention and the AE.  Not Related 
– There is not a reasonable possibility that the  administration of the study 
intervention caused the event, there is  no temporal relationship between 
the study intervention and event  onset, or an alternate etiology has been

14.0 Potential Benefits to Participants  
Potential Benefits: There may be no direct benefit to participants. However, 
potential benefits include  reduced pain and shortened recovery room stay.  
15.0 Statistical Considerations  
15.1 Data Analysis Plan: We plan to collect our data using excel which will be 
maintained in the box.  When the study is completed and ready for statistical analysis the data will be sha red with our staff statistician.  
15.2 Power Analysis:  We based our power analysis off a previous prospective 
randomized controlled trial which showed average initial pain scores of 
patients who had orthopedic surgery to  be 6.63 (SD=2.13). In order to 
detect a mean difference of [ADDRESS_302312] assuming equal variances, we need 50 total participants 
(25 per group) to achieve 90% power.  
15.3 Statistical Analysis:  This study data will be de -identified and shared with our 
staff biostatistician to be analyzed.  The statistician will be provided the 
protocol so they are able to analyze for primary and secondary objectives.   
Continuous data will be summarized with mean (standard deviation) or median (interquartile range) and categorical data will be summarize by [CONTACT_248640] (percent). Normality will be evaluated with both the Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152] -Wilk test 
and graphical evaluation. Univariate comparisons between groups will use t-tests or Mann- Whitney U -tests, as appropriate for normality, to co mpare 
continuous variables and chi -squared or Fisher’s exact tests to compare 
categorical variables between groups. Linear regression models will be explored to adjust for variables that are imbalanced after randomization or other covariates that may be cl inically relevant.  
15.4 Data Integrity:  All patients will be assigned a unique patient identifier.  
Research assistants will have experience with similar trials and data collection .

As soon as they enter the pre -operative room, an anesthesiologist will 
mention the study and ask permission for them or a research staff member  
to discuss it further if they are interested. If an anesthesiologist is not available when they are roomed, check -in or nursing staff will mention the 
study and ask the patient if a research member can discuss it with them  
further.  If they are interested they will meet a research staff member and 
be presented with a combined Health and Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA) and study consent form , with the REDCap e -
consent process being preferentially used. The patient will review the form 
with a member of the research team. They will be reminded that 
participation is completely voluntary, and that they may stop participation at any time without question or penalty. The research team will answer any questions that they may have about the study, and the teach- back method 
will be utilized to ensure comprehension . If the patient decides to 
participate, they will be asked to sign the consent and HIPAA form.  One copy will be saved for study records, and the subject will be provided with a copy of the forms.

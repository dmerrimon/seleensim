Peripheral Neuropathy affects over [ADDRESS_687993] 
common cause in the [LOCATION_002]. Once known causes are excluded, approximately 25 to 50% remain idiopathic and are referred to as cryptogenic sensory polyneuropathy (CSPN). This usually affects people over the age of 50.
1Neuropathic pain is a presenting symptom in 70-80% 
of CSPN.  According to a poll obtained by [CONTACT_529558], 87% of patients rated pain management as the most challenging in managing their neuropathy.  Currently there have been no prospective trials performed in the large CSPN group.   
The overall objective of this trial is to determine which pharmaceutical therapy is most 
effective and causes the fewest side effects in CSPN. To do this comparative effectiveness study, we will use an adaptive design model.  Specific Aim 1:  Determine which drug is most effective in producing pain relief and improving 
quality of life in patients with CSPN. We w ill perform a prospective randomized comparative 
effectiveness adaptive design study in neuropathy patients with pain who do not have diabetes 
and for whom no other cause has been found. The four drugs we will use are nortriptyline, duloxetine, pregabalin and mexiletine.  
 
Specific Aim 2:  Determine which drug has the fewest and which has the most side effects. We 
will use the MedDRA adverse event coding system and the number of dropouts due to side effects. 
 
B. Prevalence, Background: 
 
Prevalence: 
Cryptogenic Sensory Polyneuropathy (CSPN) is a common but under recognized and 
understudied condition that is debilitating due to pain 
(1).  It is estimated that ~[ADDRESS_687994] peripheral neuropathy (PN), with an annual cost to Medicare exceeding $3.5 billion 
(2). 
 
Background: 
Many peripheral neuropathies are secondary to identifiable causes, such as diabetes, alcohol 
abuse, medications. However, once known etiologies are excluded, at least 25% of neuropathies remain idiopathic 
(3-4).  We refer to these as CSPN (1, 3-7). The onset is usually in 
the sixth and seventh decades of life. The mean age of patients in prior published series ranges from [ADDRESS_687995] been established by [CONTACT_330242] 
(6).  One recent study of 
peripheral neuropathy, which tested for impaired glucose tolerance and celiac disease in patients with abnormal skin biopsy findings, found 50% to be idiopathic
(8).  Our retrospective 
review of databases from two North American (NA) and one South America (SA) tertiary neuropathy clinic  showed that CSPN represented at least one-fourth of all referred PN patients 
and is the most common form of neuropathy evaluated at these sites (Table 1)
(7).

In 2009, the National Chapter of the Neuropathy Association polled 1,000 members 
asking what form of neuropathy they had.  Fi fty-two percent described their neuropathy as 
idiopathic (9)—twice what the academic institutions found based on referrals—which might 
understate the actual frequency of idiopathic (cryptogenic) neuropathy. Regardless, 5 to 10 
million people (25 to 50% of all neuropathies) in the US have CSPN. Clearly CSPN is a 
common, but under recognized and understudied condition. 
 
CSPN is usually diagnosed on the basis of pain, numbness and/or tingling in the distal 
extremities. There are equal numbers of men and women with this condition, and it occurs in 
all races and geographic regions.  The most common symptoms are pain (54% to 100% of patients), sensory loss (86%), and paresthesia (86% to 100%) 
(1, 5, 6, 10-13).  Lower extremity 
symptoms usually precede upper extremity symptoms (6, 10).  Approximately one-third to one-
half of patients will have symptoms confined to their lower extremities (10, 13).  The average time 
for symptoms to spread to the upper extremities appears to be about 5 years (10). Worsening of 
sensory symptoms with heat exposure, ac tivity, or fatigue is commonly reported (13).   
 
Genetic testing is not generally indicated in CSPN.  However, recently a mutation in a 
gene for peripheral nerve sodium channel was discovered in 8 of 28 (29%) patients with CSPN 
(14). While this finding has not been confirmed in a larger population, it is intriguing and may 
explain why some neuropathy patients with pain respond well to drugs that block sodium channel conductance in peripheral nerves. 
 
As reported in the May 2012 National Neuropathy Association newsletter, out of 1,922 
people polled, ~66% of those with neuropathy currently receive some form of treatment for their 
pain (Figure 1) 
(15) and ~87% view pain management as the most challenging aspect of their 
neuropathy (Figure 2) (15).

We recently asked [ADDRESS_687996] important. Approximately 63% rated pain as either the most or the [ADDRESS_687997], we surveyed patient with neuropathy due to Guillain–
Barré syndrome and Chronic Inflammatory Demye linating Polyneuropathy at a recent Guillain–
Barré syndrome/Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy support group meeting in 
Kansas City on June 29, 2013 and only 33% rated pain as most important. For those patients, weakness and loss of balance were rated as most important.

patients with CSPN. While the pharmaceutical industry has focused attention on drugs for

	treating diabetic sensory neuropathy (DSPN), an d two drugs are now FDA approved, there have 
not been any prospective trials in CSPN.  And, because there are no studies with CSPN 
patients, insurance carriers often reject authorizing prescriptions for some drugs for patients 
with CSPN.  Additionally, while recommendations  from diabetes associations and neurologists 
for treating DSPN (16-17) exist, no information is available to guide physicians and patients in 
treating CSPN. Therefore, we propose conducting a comparative effectiveness 
prospective study using drugs commonly prescribed by [CONTACT_529559].   Scientifically establishing a 
treatment for CSPN will substantially impr ove care and outcomes for these patients. 
 
Most randomized, controlled pharmacologic studies in neuropathic pain have evaluated 
antidepressants and anticonvulsants.  Prospective randomized controlled clinical trials in 
neuropathic pain using placebos share a number of challenges and shortcomings.  The response to placebo is considerable,  typi[INVESTIGATOR_529541]-third 
(18-19) and at times in more 
than one-half of patients (21).  Although statistically significant differences may be demonstrated 
between active treatment and placebo groups, the actual clinical benefit of a 1- or 2-point drop on an 11-point Likert-type scale for pain intensity is debatable.  And, although they provide objective data, neurophysiologic outcome measurements have not been helpful 
(22).     
 
Another consideration for U.S. clinicians is that labeled indications in the U.S. are limited 
to duloxetine and pregabalin for painful diabet ic neuropathy; carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_529542]; and gabapentin, pregabalin, lidocaine, and high-dose capsaicin patches for postherpetic neuralgia.  Some countries permit more liberal indications that cover neuropathic pain in general, whereas others require labeling for only specific forms of painful neuropathy 
(20, 
23).  In the [LOCATION_002] this seems to vary based on the insurance carriers.  Some carriers 
deny the use of a neuropathic pain drug if it is not one of the two FDA approved drugs for diabetic neuropathy patients. 
 
For this study, we will use two drugs that are FDA approved for diabetic peripheral 
neuropathy (pregabalin and duloxetine ) and two drugs ( mexiletine  and nortriptyline ) that are 
often used in U.S. clinics to treat painful peripheral neuropathy.  We will not use a placebo 
group in this comparative effectiveness study. Below we discuss these drugs; further rationale for choosing these is provided under Criterion 3. 
 
Nortriptyline 
Nortriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant.  Tricyclic antidepressants presumably exert 
their analgesic effect by [CONTACT_529560]-gated sodium channels and by [CONTACT_529561], norepi[INVESTIGATOR_88904].  They are the most extensively studied agents for neuropathic pain, especially in diabetic neuropathy 
(31-32).  Efficacy for the 
different tricyclics is roughly similar (33-34).  We selected nortriptyline because, in general, 
nortriptyline is preferred by [CONTACT_529562], 
amitriptyline.  The recommended daily dose for tr eatment for pain ranges from [ADDRESS_687998] been effective in relievi ng pain in both depressed and non-depressed 
patients, with an analgesic action independent of mood alteration and clinically evident as early as 1 to 2 weeks 
(35-36).

	Duloxetine 
Duloxetine is a serotonin-norepi[INVESTIGATOR_26331] (SNRI).  Selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs and SNRIs) are most commonly used as antidepressants.  In 
general, however, they have been less effective than tricyclic antidepressants in controlled 
studies of neuropathic pain (22, 33, 37).  The exception has been duloxetine which was released in 
the fall of [ADDRESS_687999] FDA-approved agent for treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic 
pain. Its analgesic effects are believed to be related to potentiation of descending pain inhibition by [CONTACT_529563][INVESTIGATOR_135421].  Duloxetine has a higher, more balanced affinity at these transporter sites than do prior generations of antidepressants. In several 
diabetic neuropathy trials, delayed-release duloxetine at doses of 60 and 120 mg/day was more 
effective than placebo in reducing pain severity scores, with significant improvement seen as early as one week 
(38-39). The target for improvement in these studies was a 50% reduction in 
pain.  A lower 20 mg/day dose was not effective.  Patients with major depression were excluded from studies.  The 120 mg/day dose was no more effective than 60 mg/day and caused more 
side effects.  Significant improvement in several secondary outcomes also was observed, 
including night pain severity, the SF-MPQ, and a brief inventory on the effects of pain on daily activities and mood.    
The main adverse events were nausea, which tended to occur in the first week and last 
~6 days, somnolence and dizziness.  Approximat ely 15% of patients in the duloxetine arms 
(groups) dropped out due to adverse events. Contraindications include hypersensitivity, use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and uncontrolled na rrow-angle glaucoma.  No specific laboratory 
monitoring is needed, but duloxetine is not recommended in cases of severe renal or chronic hepatic insufficiency.  While labeled at a dose of 60 mg/day, [ADDRESS_688000] 
analgesic, anticonvulsant, and anxiolytic activi ty, although via GABA-independent mechanisms.  
Similar to gabapentin, it binds potently to the 
2 subunit of voltage-activated calcium channels, 
reducing the release of several excitatory neurotransmitters.  Unlike gabapentin, pregabalin 
exhibits linear pharmacokinetics across the standard dose range, and can be initiated at a therapeutic dose without a long titration.  Pregabalin significantly reduced mean pain scores at a dose of 100 mg tid (3x/day) versus placebo in painful diabetic neuropathy 
(47).  The target for 
improvement was a 50% reduction in pain. No titration was used, and significant pain relief was observed by [CONTACT_281114].  Secondary efficacy variables also improved significantly, 
including the SF-MPQ, sleep outcomes, pain domains in the SF-36, tension-anxiety, total mood scores, and both patient and clinician-rated global impressions.  Other studies in diabetic neuropathy have demonstrated efficacy versus placebo using fixed or flexible dosing regimens ranging from 150 to 600 mg/day 
(48-50), whereas 75 mg daily in one study (48) and 150 mg in 
another study (49) did not differ from placebo.  As a result, increasing the dose to 300 mg/day or 
higher in partial or non-responders who tolerate the medication seems appropriate.   
The main adverse events of pregabalin were dizziness (up to 39%), somnolence (up to 
22%), infection (15%), and peripheral edema (up to 17%), a profile similar to gabapentin.  The frequency of side effects increases with higher doses.  Adverse events were mostly mild to moderate in severity, and overall this drug is well tolerated 
(47-48).  Infections were mainly of the 
upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_529543].  Eleven to 15 percent of pregabalin-treated patients discontinued taking it due to adverse events.   
Pregabalin was released in the fall of 2005 with indications for both painful diabetic 
neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia.  It is a Schedule V medication in the US due to a low 
	 	 Version	date:	[ADDRESS_688001] generated conflicting data in studies involving patients who are diabetic (55-57), alcoholic (58), 
or have HIV-related neuropathy (59-60).  In a crossover study of diabetic painful neuropathy in 
which mexiletine was titrated up to a daily dose of 10 mg/kg, the pain score and clinical 
symptom scale showed significant improvement (p< 0.02 and p<0.01, respectively) compared to 
placebo (56).  A larger study involving 126 diabetics also suggested improvement in sleep 
disturbance and nocturnal pain at 675 mg/day (55).  In contrast, others (57) failed to differentiate 
between mexiletine and placebo using two diffe rent pain scales, although a subanalysis 
suggested stabbing or burning pain, heat sensations, and formication improved.  Clinical trials with HIV-related neuropathy patients have failed to demonstrate any benefit for mexiletine at 
doses up to 600 mg/day 
(59-60). 
We have considerable experience with mexiletine in multicenter trials of patients with 
muscle stiffness (61).  Since the drug works at the sodium channel, we are intrigued with the 
possibility of using mexiletine in CSPN based on the recent publication that up to a third of 
CSPN patients may have a sodium channel mutation (14). The starting dose is 150 mg/day, with 
titration up to 600 mg/day divided into two or three doses per day. The half-life of mexiletine is [ADDRESS_688002]-degree atrioventricular blockade or cardiogenic shock 
(62). 
 
Past Experience at University of Kansas Medical Center 
We performed a retrospective chart review of 143 patients who were started on 
pregabalin or duloxetine, primarily for painf ul neuropathy, during a 10-month period at the 
University of Kansas Medical Center (63). Ninety-two patients tried only one of these two 
medications, while both medications were used at different time periods in 51 of the 143 
patients. Follow-up was available for 87 of the 91 patients who took pregabalin and 89 of the 
103 patients who took duloxetine. We found more patients with neuropathic pain reported an 
improvement with pregabalin (49%) than with duloxetine (41%), but duloxetine had a higher frequency (38%) of side effects compared to pregabalin (30%). However, these differences between pregabalin and duloxetine were not statistically significant, suggesting that both pregabalin and duloxetine may be effective for neuropathic pain secondary to diabetes or cryptogenic sensory peripheral neuropathy (Table 2) and are worthy of further investigation.

a Due to the unavailability follow-up data for all patients, the denominator is the number in that

and Duloxetine, although at different times, so the N’s do not add up to 143. 
 
Measures to Assess Outcomes  
A variety of outcome measures have been used in neuropathic pain studies.  Visual 
analogue scales and 10-point and 11-point numeric rating scales such as the Likert-type scale 
(0=no pain, 10=worst possible pain) are conventional primary outcome measures. Patients 
record their pain levels in daily diaries, and mean values (averages) over a specified interval are 
compared to baseline values.  Although these instruments provide reliable and valid measurements of pain intensity and unpleasantness, they do not address other aspects of the neuropathic pain experience 
(25).  As a result, a variety of quality-of-life and daily activity 
measures have been introduced, especially in more recent trials (26).       
 
Recently the NIH published a Toolbox to measure pain in research. They recommend 
using an eight item pain interference measure from their Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) that has undergone validation testing in pain 
studies 
(27-30). The patient is asked to score each from 1 to 5, where 1=not at all, 2=a little bit, 
3=somewhat, 4=quite a bit, and 5= very much.  In this study, at all study visits, we will use this 6 
item pain interference scale, a Likert-type pain experience scale, the SF12, and the 8 item 
scales for fatigue and sleep disturbance from the NIH Toolbox .  The latter two measures were added to our design after meeting with our Patient Advisory Group and hearing from them that 
	 	 Version	date:	[ADDRESS_688003] a Likert type pain score of 4 or higher. They will then be written 
a prescription for the drug at the study dose. The drug is not provided by [CONTACT_1758]; the cost of the drug will be the responsibility of the patient  or their insurance provider. Target drug daily 
doses are nortriptyline 75 mg; duloxetine 60 mg; pregabalin 300 mg; mexiletine [ADDRESS_688004] month until the target doses are achieved (all by 4 weeks).  
 Doses will be escalated by [CONTACT_106499]: 
 Nortriptyline: 25 mg at bedtime for 1 week, then 50 mg at bedtime for 1 week, then 75 
mg at bedtime 
 Duloxetine:  20 mg for 1 week, then 40 mg for 1 week, then 60 mg daily     
 Pregabalin: 100 mg at bedtime for 1 week, then 100 mg 2 times a day for 1 week, then 
100 mg 3 times a day for the remainder of the study  
 Mexiletine: 200 mg at bedtime for 1 week, then 200 mg 2 times a day for 1 week, then 
200 mg 3 times a day for the remainder of the study 
 
If suggested medications are not available in the dosage outlined in this protocol, then an 
alternate dosing schedule may be utilized providing that patients achieve the target daily drug 
dosage at week 3 of the study. 
 The length of the study for each patient is 3 months. After this point, they can stay on the 
medication of their choice. 
 If the patient cannot tolerate the maximum dose, then (at the discretion of the physician) they may be titrated down to the previously tolerable dose.  Patients who are currently taking narcotics for pain control are eligible to participate in this study if they meet all other inclusion 
criteria.

Choice of Study Design 
             We chose the Bayesian Adaptive Design with efficiency in mind. Using adaptive 
randomization (being able to change how we assign patients to the drugs during the study 
based on information gained during the study) not only allows for substantially smaller sample sizes, but also provides better conclusions about what treatments are the most effective 
because it lets us make changes to our approach or stop the study early if we find strong results before the scheduled end of the study 
(64).  We conducted extensive trial simulations comparing 
different designs measuring the resources (tim e and number of patients required) and the ability 
to draw important conclusions about relative efficacy of the four drugs (i.e., which is better) and selected the proposed design as the most effective and efficient.  
 
Choice of Outcomes 
            Patients will complete a Likert-type scale for pain, the PROMIS [ADDRESS_688007] endpoint, or 
outcome, is a patient responder-defined measure of efficacy (i.e., if the patient reports a pain score at the end of 12 weeks that is 50% or greater from what they reported when they started the study, then it is efficacious for that patient).  The second endpoint is the percentage of patients who discontinue treatment.  Our secondary endpoints, SF-12, pain interference, 
fatigue, and sleep disturbance, also will be longitudinally modeled (see content after Table 5.) 
 
D. Analytic Methods 
 Overview 
The primary aim of this study is to determine which drug is most effective and most 
tolerable in producing pain relief. We will perform a prospective randomized comparative 
effectiveness adaptive design study with those who do not have diabetes and in whom no other 
cause for neuropathy has been found. We have an agreement from 40 sites to participate in the 
study and four drugs will be tested. In this design we will perform several interim analyses (interims) while controlling the overall Type I error rate.  
 
The following sections focus on specific details of this design and detail how we 
determined power, sample size, and duration of this trial.  Throughout we add information to 
help those less familiar with our design and analyses better understand what we did and plan to do with this study. 
  
Bayesian Adaptive Design 
Patients will be randomized to one of four treatment arms (groups) with a maximum 
number of patients nmax= 400. Using a Bayesian Adaptive Design, at each interim analysis a 
decision will be made to either continue enrolling patients or to stop the trial for success. If patient enrollment continues, the randomization structure (i.e., how we randomize patients to 
each drug) will also be updated.  Two endpoints are used to drive the adaptive randomization 
and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418].  The first endpoint is the percentage of patients who report a 50% or 
greater decrease on the Likert-type pain scale after 12 weeks.  The second endpoint is the percentage of patients that discontinue treatment. After 80 patients are enrolled (see definition of “enrolled” in the consent form section towards the end of this protocol) and equally randomized to the four arms, we begin adapting the randomization. Then, after we have endpoint data on 100 patients, the data will be analyzed (a first interim analysis) and an updated 
randomization schedule will be used.   Specifically, the arm, or drug, that looks to be the best 
	 	 Version	date:	[ADDRESS_688008] interim analysis, using up to date outcome data, until the trial is stopped (i.e. for early 
success). Early success stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_529544] (i.e., the 
best drug), measured by a combined utility of the pain and treatment discontinuation endpoints, is larger than 0.925. While this will halt new patient enrollment, we will confirm this finding with a subsequent analysis and evaluation after all data from all enrolled patients are obtained as some will still be actively in the study when the early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_529545].  Also determined is which of the arms are losers, and is defined as an arm that has a probability of 
being maximum as less than 0.01. This will be a useful result in cases where a best arm could 
not be identified. If a loser or two is identified then the drug(s) would not be recommended for use in clinical practice.  
A summary of the overall general design is as follows. 
• Begin a new adaptive randomization schedule once [ADDRESS_688009] been enrolled on 
each treatment. 
• Stop for success if the probability a treatment is best, defined as pr(t i is best) > .925, for 
some treatment. 
• Perform an interim analysis after [ADDRESS_688010] 12 week data and every 13 weeks 
thereafter.  
• For interim analyses, all data are used on all enrolled patients with at least 4 weeks of 
data. 
• For the final analysis: (1) a treatment is best if pr(t i is best) > .925 or (2) a treatment is 
loser if pr(t i is best) < .01. 
 
Combining Endpoints 
We are combining the two endpoints using a utility function framework, which has been 
discussed from a Bayesian adaptive design point of view (65).  The following describes how we 
built our utility function. Suppose Drug B has better efficacy than Drug A, but Drug A has a lower 
quit rate due to tolerability than Drug B.  What would the “quit rates” and “efficacies” have to be in order for Drug A to be clinically the same as Drug B? An elicitation tool that looks at various 
comparisons (seven of them) was created 
(66) that asked three of the clinical experts on this 
proposal (i.e. Barohn, Dimachkie, and Pasnoor) to provide the point of equivalency (Table 3). 
 
Table 3.  This table was presented to clinical experts and they were asked to fill in the 
underlined values, which are filled-in here but were blank when given to the experts.

#5 30% 15% Equals  50% 30%

#7 25% 15% Equals  50% 35%

	We then plotted the points from Table 3 that were considered "equal” and then plotted lines of 
constant utility. This resulted in identifying that 4 points of efficacy = 3 points of quit rate.   This utility function was acceptable to the clinical team.  Specifically, the utility function is 
U(E,Q)= .75E +1-Q.    
Combining patient ratings of efficacy with data on the percentage of patients who stop 
taking the drug to which they were assigned provides us with an important single measure of 
which drug is ‘best.’ 
 
 
Virtual Participant Response 
For the purposes of this investigation we looked at several virtual (or “pretend”) 
responses to determine the power, sample size and time (duration) needed for our study.  We 
created several scenarios for both efficacy and quit rates using five patterns for efficacy and three patterns for quit rates (Table 4).  These were then combined into several possible 
combinations (e.g., one combination would be a ‘best’ and ‘[ADDRESS_688011]’ drug for efficacy and a ‘no 
differences’ for quit rate, another might be ‘no differences’ for efficacy and ‘no differences’ for 
quit rate, etc.).

[ADDRESS_688012] 
quit rate  
NOTE:  “Positive” relation refers to both efficacy and quit percentages being good; “Negative” relation refers to either good efficacy and high quit percentages or low efficacy and low quit percentages.  Accrual (patient enrollment) Patterns 
Accrual patterns are important to Bayesian adaptive designs and refer to how rapi[INVESTIGATOR_529546].  We assume that the distribution of the accrual patterns follows a Poisson distribution with a mean, or average, number of patients accrued per week. 
The accrual patterns depend on two factors: (1) the number of sites actively enrolling patients in 
the trial, and (2) how fast the sites can enroll, which we assume is a constant for each. We expect after a ramp-up of around 8 weeks of enrolling patients, using information from the participating 40 site investigators, we should accrue an average of 4.2 patients/week.  Determining this is important for identifying how long the trial will last.  
   
Statistical Model  
Of necessity the following is fairly technical, but it is needed to allow for appropriate 
statistical review and because it is the statistical model that will evaluate final determination of 
which drug is “best”.  This is referred to as the arm of maximum utility (i.e., the drug with the 
	 	 Version	date:	[ADDRESS_688013] combination of patient reported efficacy and percentage of patients who quit taking the 
drug.)  For this study the two endpoints are respectively S EjT for efficacy and S QjT for quitting. 
The number who did not quit and were not efficacious is Sn EjT. These are modeled as a 
multinomial distribution (S QjT,SEjT, Sn EjT)~MultNomial( θq
j, θe
j, θne
j).  In addition, we provide 
“weakly informative” priors, (θq
j, θe
j, θne
j)~ MultNomial(1/3,1/3,1/3)).  Using the endpoint data and 
the prior probabilities, we then use Markov Chain Monte Carlo computations to obtain the 
Bayesian posterior distributions of |e
jEjTS and |q
jQjTS respectively for each endpoint (i.e., 
efficacy and quitting.)   
 
The utility function previously discussed is used for determining whether we have met 
our stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_107160].  Specifically, the rule is we will stop the trial if the probability of an arm 
(i.e., a drug) having maximum utility is greater than 0.925. This may first be determined after enrolling 100 of the 400 potential patients.  The utility function is  
 .75 | 1 |eq

m a x , 12345max , , , ,TT T T T TU UUUUU .  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_529547] P(U max,T)>.925). If a 
maximum utility arm (drug) is not identified after completed data on 100 patients, this procedure and accrual will continue until a maximum arm is identified or we reach 400 enrolled patients.  
At the end of the trial we will also decide that an arm is a “loser” if there is a very unlikely chance 
that it is the best, P(U max,T)<.01). 
       
Adaptive Randomization: Allocation  
After the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_529548] a 
formula that takes advantage of the information gained from our analyses up to that point.  
Using this formula, each arm (or drug) is allocated for the next patients to be enrolled in the jth 
arm proportional to  max, *Pr

desirable properties then simply using  max, PrjTTUU .  Using this approach will allow us to 
assign more patients to the most promising arm or drug, and fewer patients to the least 
promising drug. 
 
Longitudinal Model 
This model predicts patients 12 week data fr om data at early time points (4 and 8 
weeks). Estimate transition probabilities from outcome at early time point to final outcome. The 
number of transitions to final outcome given early outcome is distributed as multinomial with the 
following parameters.  If a patient quits treatment early, we transition the patient to quit at 12 weeks. Let p21, p22, and p32 be conditional on a patient showing early efficacy, the respective final probabilities of quit, efficacy, and not efficacy.   For these we use a Dirichlet prior on transition probabilities, (p21,p22,p32)~Dirichlet(1,7,2).  Similarly for a patient that shows no 
efficacy early, the final prior probabilities are (p31,p32,p33)~Dirichlet(1,2,7).  These are fairly 
diffuse, each having a prior sample size equivalent to ten patients.  
We estimate transition probabilities separately for each treatment group and for [ADDRESS_688014] by: 
1. Sample posterior transition probabilities from longitudinal model  
2. Impute [ADDRESS_688015] 4 week values given 
sampled transition probabilities  
	 	 Version	date:	[ADDRESS_688016] as 
the proportion of times it had the max utility. 
Here is the longitudinal scenario based on elicitations from the clinical team, which 
resulted in transition probabilities for evaluating the trial’s operating characteristics. To simulate the early outcomes, one first simulates the final outcomes from a multinomial distribution. Then 
the early outcomes are also multinomial simulations conditional on these final outcomes.  
Specifically, if the final outcome is a quit, then the probabilities of early quit, efficacy, non-efficacy is 0.80, 0.10, and 0.[ADDRESS_688017] 0, .67, and .33 respectively.  If not effective then is 0, .33, and .67.    
Simulation Algorithm  
The following steps summarize the algorithm (or rule) used to determine power, sample 
size, and duration of the trial.  These are all necessary elements for establishing that the trial is 
of sufficient size and length to yield valid results.  For this algorithm we used the “virtual patient 
responses” parameters (or simulated data) previously discussed.  Step 0:  Set the index for 
simulation iteration to be b=0.  Step 1:  Set b=b+1. Step 2:  Simulate the initial observed data. 
Step 3:  estimate posterior parameters via simulation and calculate the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_529549]. Step 4:  repeat steps 2 and 3 after collecting four more weeks of data. 
Step 5:  evaluate all of the data after collecting all of the endpoints. Step 6:  go to step 1 unless 
b=1000, then stop.  Initially we used this algorithm in a software package called FACTSTM 
(Fixed and Adaptive Clinical Trials Simulator) (65).  FACTSTM is very powerful and can handle a 
wide variety of models for exploring the operating characteristics of Bayesian clinical trials 
designs. It was developed by S. Berry, who co-authored the PCORI methods guidelines and wrote the Bayesian adaptive design portion of those guidelines.  [CONTACT_72778] is a consultant on this application and the University of Kansas Medical Center is the first academic institution with license to use FACTS
TM. We then programmed the algorithm in the software R(66) to handle the 
multinomial case for the simulation and adapted it for use during the actual trial.  
 
Power, Sample Size, and Trial Duration 
We performed several trial simulations based on the various combinations of efficacy (5 
types) and quit (3 types) endpoints that were shown in Table 4.  We varied the maximal accrual into the study after several weeks and, as previously identified, found 4.2 patients/week to be 
very close to the optimal combination of sample size and trial duration 
(66).  These simulations 
resulted in identifying power (the probability of success) in two components—one for early 
success (i.e., being able to stop the trial early) and one for late success of the trial (i.e., after enrolling all 400 patients) (see Table 5).  While some of these combinations are very unlikely to occur, we include all possible combinations in Table 5, ordered from most to least power.  We 
highlight four scenarios, here.   
 
First we want to highlight the unlikely scenario that serves as our null hypothesis 
(scenario #1 in Table 6 ).  In this scenario there are no differences in efficacy or in quit rates 
among the drugs.  Therefore, the extent to which this scenario is “successful” actually reflects 
our Type I error rate.  For this scenario, we estimated (identified) that 5.5% of the simulated 
trials had early success, .6% late success. Thus this trial scenario produced an appropriate 
expected Type I error ( α~.05).  The sample size of this scenario on average was 393 patients.  
The average length of the trials under this scenario was 108 weeks. Second (scenario #2 in 
	 	 Version	date:	15	Feb	2015	
18	
	Table 6),  if there is a best drug and second best drug in terms of efficacy and quit rates, we 
estimated (identified) that 78% of the simulated trials had early success, 2% had late success, 
and 20% had incomplete results. This trial scenario had 80% power and the sample size of this 
trial scenario was on average 298.  The average length of this trial scenario was [ADDRESS_688018] (scenario #3 in Table 6),  if there is one strong best drug in terms of efficacy and quit 
rates, we estimated (identified) that 92% of the simulated trials had early success, 2% late 
success, and only 6% had incomplete results. Thus this simulation had 94% power.  The average sample size of this trial scenario was 266.  The average length of these simulated trials 
was [ADDRESS_688019] treatment.  Fourth 
(scenario #4 in Table 6), a very unlikely case, is  if there is one strong best drug in terms of 
efficacy and but quit rates that are higher for the drug with high efficacy, we estimated 
(identified) that 10% of the simulated trials had early success, 2% late success, and 88% had incomplete results. Thus this simulation had 12% power.  The average sample size of this trial scenario was 387.  The average length of these simulated trials was 107 weeks. However, this 
trial does a decent job correctly identifying treatment 2 as the loser (65%).

Secondary Endpoints 
The previous discussion focused on our primary endpoints, efficacy and quite rates.  The 
temporal patterns of our secondary endpoints, SF-12, pain interference, fatigue, and sleep 
disturbance, will be longitudinally modeled using a two-level (time, patient) hierarchical linear modeling approach to evaluate these variables within each arm across time 
(67). 
Missing data: 
Our primary statistical inference of the intervention measures (efficacy and medication 
quit rates) will label all patients with missing VAS data to be imputed as a failure.  Therefore our study has valid type I error rates and has nominal confidence interval coverage properties as detailed in the proposal. A patient that is enrolled and randomized (note: after signing the consent form) into the study will either continue to take the randomly assigned pain medication (quit=0) or discontinue (quit=1).  Among the patients that continue the pain medication, and 
have follow-up VAS outcomes, that patient will either drop their VAS pain score by ½ or better (efficacy=1) or they will not (efficacy=0).  Among the patients that discontinue treatment of assigned pain medication, or having missing VAS va lues, they will automatically be recorded as 
non-efficacious (efficacy=0).  Patients that are lost from the study will be considered to have discontinued treatment (quit=1, efficacy =0). The rule above implies that missing data will result 
in an imputed failure (and hence there are no missing primary outcomes). The primary inference 
in our study automatically addresses MD-3 of the PCORI Methodology Standards.   Note: our secondary statistical inference of the inte rvention measure of reported VAS changes will be 
conducted using Bayesian mixed-effect model repeated measures (MMRM) where missing data will be addressed using multiple imputation. 
 
E. Stakeholders   
 
The key stakeholders for the PAIN-CONTRoLS project are patients with Cryptogenic 
Sensory Polyneuropathy (CSPN), their families who cope with loved ones struggling with pain 
on a daily basis, providers who treat these patients,  scientists involved in this study, patients’ 
local and national associations (the local and national chapters of the Neuropathy Association), and ethicists working in healthcare in general and pain management in particular. We already have engaged a number of critical stakeholders—including in discussions of study design, for feedback on measures to be used, and for support for recruitment and completion of the proposed study.  Indeed, the decision to propose this study and how it will proceed are a direct 
result of working with patients and tracking their symptoms.  Our patients made it very clear that 
a rigorous comparative effectiveness study  is desperately needed. The organizational

Engagement Activities: Researcher and Technical Expert Collaboration  
 Our engagement activities began over a year ago.  We had an initial brainstorming 
meeting with approximately 30 researchers and staff at the Personalized Medicine and 
Outcomes Center  within the NIH CTSA supported Frontiers: Heartland Institute for Clinical and 
Translational Research  program in May 2012. We presented our initial concept of a comparative 
effectiveness study for painful neuropathy and received outstanding feedback.  They advised 
that we should develop the study so that it most closely resembles real world activity and decision-making between physicians and patients in the management of neuropathy pain.  This influenced us a great deal in deciding on the design to randomize patients to drugs that are currently given routinely, but for which there have been no systematic studies for use in CSPN.  
We also were mindful to design the study to dispense these drugs as they would be advised by [CONTACT_221003]—for example, one or two or three times a day, and not try to create a common time or strict number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_529550]. [CONTACT_529572] heard Scott Berry, PhD, talk about adaptive design models for clinical trials at a CTSA meeting in the spring of 2012, and this led to [CONTACT_72778] joining the study development team as a consultant. 
  
The Data and Safety Monitoring Board  (DSMB) will be chaired by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Anthony Amato, 
Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical Sc hool. Other members of the DSMB will be Zarife Safety Committee
	 	 Version	date:	[ADDRESS_688021]; Elliott Frohman MD, a 
multiple sclerosis and clinical trials expert at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas; Kim Kimminau, PhD, co-director of our CTSA’s Community Partnership for Health  program, [CONTACT_529573]; and Leslie McClure PhD, a biostatistician from a non-participating academic institution.  The DSMB will meet via phone 3-[ADDRESS_688022] (DSMB), we also will 
have a physician safety monitor, Jeffrey Statland, MD, who will chair a Safety Committee to 
discuss issues regarding side effects and adverse events in real time as they happen.  This is 
standard for clinical trials.  Our Safety Committee will have at least one patient with CSPN as a member, and at least one physician who is not associated with the study.  Together they 
will assess side effects as they occur and make determinations regarding particular patient safety issues. They will provide this informati on to the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_529551].   
 The last committee we have previously referred to but did not detail is the PAIN-
CONTRoLS  Steering Committee.  The Steering Committee is made up of the following: at 
least one representative from the Patient Advisory Board, Richard J. Barohn MD, PI, Mazen 
Dimachkie MD, Aziz Shaibani MD, Vera Bril MD, Jaya Trivedi MD, Gil Wolfe MD, Omar Jawdat MD, Andrea Nicol MD, By[CONTACT_529566], statistician, Linda Ward from the Center for Practical Bioethics , and Kim Kimminau PhD, representing the community engagement function 
for Frontiers (CTSA grant at KUMC).  Because we actively involved patients in developi[INVESTIGATOR_529552]-CONTRoLS project, several have already agreed to serve on the Steering Committee. 
The Steering Committee will oversee additional development of the protocol and execution of 
the study. They will approve the final protocol before it is distributed to each site, and will be kept up to date on reports from the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. They also may ask the DSMB to convene for review of safety issues at any time. 
 The Steering Committee will review all manuscripts and presentations prepared about 
the PAIN-CONTRoLS project and using data from this project.  The patient member of the Steering Committee will be charged with ensuring these are shared with the full Patient Advisory Board.  The Steering Committee also will ensure that each site investigator maintains contact [CONTACT_529567] (if one exists near their site) and visits or sends a representative to the local chapter meetings several times a year. 
We are committed to conduct this project in the most transparent way possible, seeking 
meaningful communication with and participation by [CONTACT_529568].  In particular, patients and other stakeholders have been fully integrated into the planning and the design of this project and all will be actively involved in the conduct of this study and the dissemination of findings from this study.  Patients and other stakeholders sit on every committee, and a patient 
will co-chair the important Communications Committee. 
	 KUMC intends to utilize a “remote or virtual” monitoring plan for this trial. The goal with 
remote monitoring is to help site investigators and research staff with the prevention or 
mitigation of important and likely risks to data quality, protection of human subjects and trial integrity.   The remote monitor will ask for copi[INVESTIGATOR_529553], subject eligibility and outcome measures entered 
into the database. We will try to request remote monitoring 2-[ADDRESS_688023] eligibility, the Likert Pain Scale, the NIH Pain Interference 
	 	 Version	date:	15	Feb	2015	
22	
	Scale, the NIH Fatigue Interference Scale, NIH Sleep Disturbance Scale, SF-12 and adverse 
event reporting will also be verified during remote monitoring. 
Each site will be asked to send protected documents containing individually identifiable 
personal and/or health information through KUMC's secure portal called Secure File Transfer Network. 
The project managers will monitor the database and to confirm that all data has been 
entered on a weekly basis. They will report to Richard J. Barohn, MD if they identify a site that is 
unable to enter data in a timely manner. 
 Protection of Human Subjects  
 
The University of Kansas Medical Center will serve as Internal Review Board (IRB) of 
record for this study for all sites. Each site must obtain approval from their IRB as well as from 
the IRB of record (KUMC) before enrollment at their site can begin. This process will be followed 
carefully by [CONTACT_529569] (JoAnn 
Miller, BA, CCRP) to ensure that all sites comply.  
Patients will need to be consented prior to participation in the study. All sites will need to 
document their consenting processes and the original signed and dated consent forms will be 
kept at each site. Each patient will be given a copy of their consent forms. 
 
Each subject will sign two consent forms. The main consent form will explain the study, 
outline study visits and procedures and identify the risks that will be the same in each group. After all study procedures are performed and the subject is randomized, the subjects will then sign a drug specific supplemental consent form. This consent form will list the risks unique to 
the drug the subject is randomized.  Each main consent form will contain the following information found from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) website (www.grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/phs398/phs398.doc ). The 
components of the consent form must contain the following information (copi[INVESTIGATOR_529554]):

proposed research. Explain how data from the site(s) will be obtained, managed, and protected. 
b. Sources of Materials  
 Describe the research material obtained from living individuals in the form of specimens, 
records, or data.  
 Describe any data that will be collected from human subjects for the project(s) described 
in the application.  
 Indicate who will have access to individually  identifiable private information about human 
subjects.  
 Provide information about how the specimens, records, and/or data are collected, 
managed, and protected as well as whether material or data that include individually 
identifiable private information will be collected specifically for the proposed research 
project. 
c. Potential Risks   
 Describe the potential risks to subjects (physical, psychological, financial, legal, or 
other), and assess their likelihood and seriousness to the human subjects.  
 Where appropriate, describe alternative tr eatments and procedures, including the risks 
and potential benefits of the alternative treatments and procedures, to participants in the proposed research. 
 
II. Adequacy of Protection against Risks a. Recruitment and Informed Consent  
 Describe plans for the recruitment of subjects (where appropriate) and the process for 
obtaining informed consent. If the proposed studies will include children, describe the 
process for meeting requirements for parental permission and child assent. 
 Include a description of the circumstances under which consent will be sought and 
obtained, who will seek it, the nature of the information to be provided to prospective subjects, and the method of documenting consent. If a waiver of some or all of the elements of informed consent will be sought, provide justification for the waiver. 
Informed consent document(s) need not be submitted to the PHS agencies unless 
requested. 
b. Protections against Risk 9 
 Describe planned procedures for protecting against or minimizing potential risks, 
including risks to privacy of individuals or confidentiality of data, and assess their likely effectiveness. 
 Research involving vulnerable populations, as described in the DHHS regulations, 
Subparts B-D must include additional protections. Refer to DHHS regulations, and OHRP guidance:  
o Additional Protections for Pregnant Women, Human Fetuses and Neonates: 
http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html#subpartb   
o Additional Protections for Prisoners: 
http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html#subpartc   
o OHRP Subpart C Guidance: 
http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/index.html#prisoners  
o Additional Protections for Children: 
http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html#subpartd  
o OHRP Subpart D Guidance:

	 Where appropriate, discuss plans for ensuring necessary medical or professional 
intervention in the event of adverse effects to  the subjects. Studies that involve clinical 
trials (biomedical and behavioral intervention studies) must include a general description 
of the plan for data and safety monitoring of the clinical trials and adverse event reporting to the IRB, the NIH and others, as appropriate, to ensure the safety of subjects. 
 III. Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to Human Subjects and Others 
 Discuss the potential benefits of the research to research participants and others.  
 Discuss why the risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits to 
research participants and others. 
IV. Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained  
 Discuss the importance of the knowledge gained or to be gained as a result of the 
proposed research.  
 Discuss why the risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to the importance of the 
knowledge that reasonably may be expected to result. 
 NOTE: Test articles (investigational new drugs, devices, or biologics) including test articles that will be used for purposes or administered by [CONTACT_529570] (FDA) must be named. State whether the 30-day 
interval between submission of applicant certification to the FDA and its response has elapsed or has been waived and/or whether use of the test article has been withheld or restricted by [CONTACT_1622], and/or the status of requests for an Investigational New Drug (IND) or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) covering the proposed use of the test article in the Research Plan.  All sites will be trained to address potential susceptibility to therapeutic misconception by 
[CONTACT_529571], its purpose and their role, have been 
counseled about it, and know that additional support may be available for them should they withdraw from the study through alternative support from the Pain Action Alliance to Implement a National Strategy (PAINS) project and advocacy groups that may offer bio-psychosocial alternatives to pharmaceutical interventions that have failed them. (Note, the Pain Action 
Alliance to Implement a National Strategy (PAINS) project is different from this research study 
we call PAIN-CONTRoLS).  
Children will not be entered into the study. Most of the study medications offered in this 
study is safe for pregnant females. Due to the short duration of the study (12 weeks) we are going to ask all females of childbearing potential use birth control. There will not be a caregiver 
form, so only patients that can comprehend the consent form will be enrolled.

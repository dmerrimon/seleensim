for Urinary Tract Infection: The I NSPI[INVESTIGATOR_341062]# : 03697096  
 
7/3/2018 
INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_21392]  (INtelligent  Stewardship Prompts  to Improve  Real-time Empi[INVESTIGATOR_341063] (UTI) ): The INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_21392] -ASP UTI Trial  Protocol  
 
A. Background and Goals  
A.1.[ADDRESS_422207] infection (UTI).1 In treating these infections , the Ce nters for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) has found that antibiotic prescribing could be improved in 35- 40% of patients.[ADDRESS_422208] ~[ADDRESS_422209] fueled 
national calls to improve antibiotic choices by [CONTACT_341142].8-13 There is a 2020 target to 
reduce “inappropriate” antibiotic prescribing in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341064] 20%, as discussed in the 2014 “National 
Strategy f or Comba ting Antibiotic -Resistant Bacteria” released by [CONTACT_341143].[ADDRESS_422210] practices for improving judicious anti biotic p rescribing. Evidence, engagement, 
and education are required to build a culture where it is accepted that rationale antibiotic 
prescribing is every physician’s responsibility.[ADDRESS_422211] empi[INVESTIGATOR_341065] a patient’s condition, selecting the wrong dose or du ration, and failing to re- evaluate the choices that 
have been made. Empi[INVESTIGATOR_341066]. We focus here on improving the empi[INVESTIGATOR_341067] d patients that have an appropriate indication.  
When selecting initial antibiotics for common community -acquired conditions that cause 
admission, such as pneumonia and urinary tract infection (U TI), physicians vary widely in their 
adherence to nati onal gui delines.
18-20 This is often due to misperceptions that multidrug -resistant 
organisms (MDROs) are more common than they actually are, or beliefs that extended- spectrum 
antibiotics are more effect ive in curing infections than standard -spectrum choices, even for 
pathogens sensitive to standard- spectrum agents.21 Often, such perceptions are based on studies 
on critically ill patients and those with infections caused by [CONTACT_115959]- resistant Staphyloc occus 
aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and extended- spec trum beta -lactamase producing 
(ESBL) Enterobacteriaceae.22-[ADDRESS_422212] been called “the missing care 
bundle,”[ADDRESS_422213] to 
extrapolate the probability that the in fection is due to a particular pathogen. As mentioned above, 
physicians are expected to use local antibiogram data from their microbiology laboratory to determine the risk of an MDRO infection in a give n patient.
51-54,92 Yet, these data are not presented 
in a manner helpful to clinical decision -making.93 For example, national data shows that over 50% 
of S. aureus  are resistant to methicillin (MRSA), and 22% of E. coli  and 30% of P. aeruginosa are 
resista nt to fluoroquinolones.94 
These data may be misinterpr eted as the probability that a patient has an MDRO infection. 
However, when accounting for the likelihood that a patient is infected with these pathogens, the risk 
of MDRO infection drops substantially.  In two recent studies of patients presenting from the 
communi ty with pneumonia, there was a 2.5- 4.6% risk of MRSA, a 1.0- 1.9% risk of Gram -negative 
Enterobacteriaceae , and a 0.7- 1.2% risk of P. aeruginosa resistant to standard- spectrum 
antibiotics.26,94 -95   
Instead of providing the MDRO risk by [CONTACT_209058], physicians would be better served by 
[CONTACT_341144]. Though precision 
medicine tools in antibiotic stewardship are lacking, there i s evidence that precision medicine 
approaches can subs tantially improve patient care.56-59 This involves reformulating a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]’ 
antibiogram data into disease- specific probabilities of MDRO infection to facilitate appropriate 
prescribing.  
A.1.[ADDRESS_422214] generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone as empi[INVESTIGATOR_341068] .18-20 There i s growin g 
evidence that fluoroquinolones are associated with serious adverse drug reactions and an increased risk of C. difficile colitis.
99-101 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also issued a 
warning ( May, 2016) against the routine use of fluoroquinolones, particularly for conditions in which 
resistance is known to be high, such as urinary tract infection .102,[ADDRESS_422215] been shown 
to increase a patient’s risk for future MDRO, length of stay, risk for C. difficile  colitis, healthc are 
costs, and mortality.99,103  Data are emerging that there is time to await definitive culture data to 
inform antibiotic treatment and that a delay in antibiotics targeting resistant organisms is not 
necessarily harmful and may improve outcomes.103-105    
 
B. INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_21392] -ASP UTI Trial Study Design  & Population  
 
B.1.1 INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_21392] -ASP UTI Trial Study Design & Population  
The INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_21392] -ASP Trial is  a two -arm cluster -randomized trial in HCA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341069] -
of-care precision medicine computerized physician order entry (CP OE) smart prompt  for adult 
patients admitted to general medical or surgical floors . The unit of randomization will be the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The trial will begin with a six -month phase- in period from Oc tober 1, [ADDRESS_422216] 3 days of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. A baseline period between April 1, 2017 -September 30, 2018 will be utiliz ed for comparison with the interv ention period at each  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Per guidance from  the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) , prisoners will not 
be included in this t rial. P rescribers and antibiotic stewardship teams in intervention facilities will be 
trained (e.g., coaching calls,  usual communication channels (email, flyers)) that prisoners should be 
excluded from the t rial (i.e., the CPOE smart prompt should not be acted upon for these 
individuals). D ata for any prisoners that may be inadvertently included in study datasets will be  
removed prior to analyses using claims data as well as admission/discharge/transfer codes 
indicating ‘Court/Law Enforcement’ . 
 
B.1.2 HCA Healthcare Infrastructure for the INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_21392] -ASP Intervention Arm  
HCA Healthcare curren tly requires physicians to provide  an indication when an antibiotic is 
ordered (see Appendix B for example CPOE indication screens ). For facilities assigned to the 
intervention arm of the INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_21392] -ASP Trial,  an INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_341070] d-spectrum (ES, Table 1) for a UTI indication in the first three days 
of a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. This CPOE smart prompt  will provide clinicians with a patient -specific estimate of 
the likelihood that the UTI is due to the associated target pathogens (e.g. MRSA,  VRE, 
Pseudomonas, ESB L, or CRE, Table  1). The smart prompt will also provide guidance for  
appropriate empi[INVESTIGATOR_341071] .   
For example, if an anti -Pseudomonas  antibiotic is being ordered for UTI, the clinicia n will 
receive a prom pt during the ordering process  providing the probabili ty that the patient has UTI due 
to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. R ecommendations for  using standard- spectrum antibiotics (e.g. 
ceftriaxone) will be made w hen the probability of a given M DRO is lower than a gi ven threshold 
(e.g., <10%). This threshold used in the trial will be finalized after evaluation of the prevalence of 
MDROs, and after discussion with the INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_21392] -ASP Steering Committee . Similarly, if an  ES 
antibiotic is selected that t argets a resistant Gr am-negative Enterobacteriaceae, the ordering 
physician will receive information on the probability that the patient is likely to grow such organisms.  
The smart prompt will account for personal attributes of the patient as well as local 
resistance patterns.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341072], principally involving  a decision support tool known as Rx VigiLanz Therape utic Advisor,191

B.1.5 Randomization  
While this study represents a large cluster -randomized trial of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], simple 
randomization of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341085], and without 
care could even result in very unequal numbe rs of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341086]. Achieving balance on key 
features of the random ization units (in this case, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]) is a critical task in cluster -randomized 
trials, but little literature on it exists. Unlike i ndividually randomized  trials, information abou t the 
clusters is often known in advance, but the number of clusters to be r andomized can be relatively 
small. The existence of a priori data can mitigate the small numbers and help to obtain adequate 
balance through stratification or other methods. One at tractive approach is to establish tuplets —
matched sets (pairs, for a two- arm trial) – in which one member of each tuplet is assigned to each 
arm. Schemes f or constructing tuplets need not be guided by [CONTACT_75780]. A formal approach would be 
to calculate the Maha lanobis distance between hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341087]. In this approach, we could st andardize the 
variables, and then multiply by [INVESTIGATOR_78243] c alibrated to reflect any difference in the impor tance of 
balancing them. Other approaches are more ad hoc, such as prioriti zing broad classes of balance 
on a key variable and making pairs within these s trata based on lower -priority variables. However, 
there is no “best” method of tuplet construction, o nly sets that come closer to meeting the varied 
needs of each trial.  
We will establish the pairs under several plausible tuplet -construction schemes, and use 
graphical methods to compare all possible real izations for balance between the arms under each 
scheme. For example, if two variables were to be balanced, we would tentatively divide the sample 
into two groups under a tuplet con struction scheme and then generate a scatterplot showing the 
between- arm ab solute value of the mean difference for one variable on the x -axis and the second 
on the y -axis for each possible result of the randomization. We would then divide the groups again 
under the same scheme, and find another point on the scatterplot. Repeating many times would 
show the typi[INVESTIGATOR_341088] a scheme. Comparing the resulting scatterplots from each tuplet -construction scheme can reveal the relative ris ks of imbalance and benefi ts for 
balance accruing to each randomization scheme, in a practical sense. One tuplet construction 
method may result in generally close balance on one key characteristic and very variable balance 
on the other, while a competing s cheme has good median balance on both characteristics, but 
where each has a long tail implying a few bad- luck assignments with poor balance.  
We hope to consider balance on more than two factors, and for assessing the impact on 
balance in this case,  we will  use a parallel coordinat es plot, a multivariate plot method. After 
determi ning key variables where balance across the arms would be highly desirable, we will plot the  
mean difference between the arms for all key variables for each potential realized rando mization.  
We will focus on balancing the baseline outcome values in partic ipating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341089], local 
prevalence of antibiotic resistance in UTI patients,  length -of-stay, ICU transfers, and facility case -
mix of patients with UTI . Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341090] a 
single hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341091].  
 
B.1.6 Baseline  Period Activities  
 The baseline period will be a 1 8 month  period from April 1, 2017 – September 30, 2018,  
prior to the phase in and will share a similar  month distribution as the intervention period. This 
period will provide baseline outcome dat a for both arms (see Analysis Secti on B.1.10). In addition 
to recruitment and randomi zation, preparatory activities for Phase- In and Intervention Periods will 
also begin. The corporate HCA Information Technology (IT) team will develop the CPOE smart 
prompt template which will include creati on of smart prompt algorithms, automated compliance 
reports, and centralized beta test ing. CPOE smart prompts will use MDRO infection risk estimates 
developed in a separate  retrospective cohort study.   Educational materials and training modules will 
be dev eloped as described below .  
  
B.1.[ADDRESS_422219], the implementation of the CPOE smart prompt requires both corporate and 
local IT department efforts. This will req uire time to accurately implement and ensure sufficient 
validation and refinement for proper function at each participat ing intervention arm hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
During this period, educational material s will be distributed to study champi[INVESTIGATOR_341092] (Table  2). In addition, study site champi[INVESTIGATOR_341093] -In period, ultimately transitioning 
to every other month calls when implementation and feedback stabili zes. Special coaching calls will 
also occur at least quarterly for both arms and invo lve best practice stewardship recomm endations 
from national guidelines and experts. All coaching calls will be led by [CONTACT_341149] t by [CONTACT_341150]. Coaching calls will involve a shared 
PowerPoint slide set followed by a question and answ er session. All coaching calls will be recorded 
and placed on arm -specific INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_21392] -ASP Trial sites on the HCA Healthcare intranet for c ontinued 
access by [CONTACT_341151]. Participant s will be highly e ncouraged to share 
concerns and solutions with one another.

B.1.9 INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_21392] -ASP UTI Trial Outcomes  
The goal of this trial is to reduce unnecessary physician prescribing of empi[INVESTIGATOR_341102] -
spectrum antibi otics (Table 8) . Trial outcomes evaluating intervention effectiveness are outlined in 
Table [ADDRESS_422220] three days of an admission and divided by [CONTACT_341152][INVESTIGATOR_341103].  An empi[INVESTIGATOR_341104] a day within the firs t three days of an 
admission. We define this outcome as an Extended- Spectrum Days Of Therapy (ES -DOT) per 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_341105].   Days of therapy (DOT) is specific to each extended- spectrum antibiotic, where any 
dose is considered one day’s wort h of t herapy. The ES a ntibiotics are then aggregated to obtain the 
total ES DOT. For example, if a patient is started on vancomycin and cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_341106] 1 day, this will count as 2 ES DOT for that day. Multiple doses of the same antibiotic received on the same day are 
only counted  as one day of therapy for that extended spectrum antibiotic. This outcome will include 
antibiotics in Table1 .

B.1.[ADDRESS_422222] three days of an admission. We define this outcome as an Extended- Spectrum Days 
Of Therapy (ES -DOT) per empi[INVESTIGATOR_341105]. For clarity the calculation is as follows: we define a DOT for 
a particular ES antibiotic as a day in which any number of doses of that antibiotic is given. Different 
ES antibiotics are summed across the empi[INVESTIGATOR_341114], then divided by [CONTACT_341154][INVESTIGATOR_341115] -admiss ion to determine each admission’s DOT per at -risk day. If an 
admission is less than [ADDRESS_422223] an ICD -10 claims 
code indicating UTI is present on admission, who received any antibiotic within 3 days of 
admiss ion, and who were admitted to a non -ICU location. For admissions initially on a non- ICU 
floor and transferred to the ICU, analysis will include only admission days on the non -ICU floor 
within 3 days of admission.  
The trial periods are defined as follows: (1) Baseline – April 1, 2017 – September 30, 2018 
(18 m onths); (2) Phase -in – October 1, 2018 – March 31, 2019 (6 months); (3) Intervention  
–April 1, 2019 – June 30, 2020 (15 months).
The unit of analysis will be individual admissions. Individuals can contribute more than one 
admission. The analytic model will be a generalized linear mixed effects model for differences in 
differences, with random effects accounting for correlation within cluster, period- varying random 
effects to allow for differences between hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341116] -up, and admission- level 
random effects to account for correlation within person and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Analyses of the baseline data, 
performed before randomization, found no evidence of overdispersion in a Poisson model, and so  
we plan to use that model for analysis of outcomes. The model can be expressed as follows:  
wher e 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ is the ES -DOT per at -risk day for pat ient 𝑖𝑖 for ad mission 𝑖𝑖 in period 𝑖𝑖 at hosp ital ℎ, and 
𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ = 1 if hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ℎ is in the intervention a rm and 0 if  not, and 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ = [ADDRESS_422224] e admissions.  Equivalently,  they al low for correlation within hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] a t

The assessment o f trial s uccess  will be determined by t he significance of t he arm by [CONTACT_341155] t erm 𝛽𝛽 3, which assesses w hether the log relative r ate of the outcome due t o bei ng in the

to identify potential safety issues. This is required because a reduction in ES -DOT might be 
achieved onl y by [CONTACT_341156]. Each saf ety 
outcome will be evaluated for non -inferiority using an as -randomized unadjusted model with a one -
tailed significance set at alpha = 0.05. Analyses planned for these asses sments are proportional 
hazards models with random effects (to account for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341117]). These models are sometimes 
called frailty or shared frailty models. Because these are safety outcomes, we do not intend to 
make adjustments for multiple comparisons in testing them, f urther increasing conservatism.  
All analyses will be performed using current versions of SAS (Version 9.4, as of writing, SAS 
Institute, Cary NC) and/or R (Version 4.0, as of writing).  
 
B.1.11 Power Size/Sample Size Calculations  
Power assessment proceeded as fol lows, using a Monte Carlo approach. We used 
available data to define a baseline period of 10/1/2015- 12/31/2016 in a bootstrap procedure. 
Individuals were selected with replacement from within each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], once to represent 
baseline data and separately to  represent intervention period data. In the randomizati on 
portion of the Monte Carlo approach, we ordered the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341118] “size”, meaning the 
number of admissions with UTI. Then, within strata of 6 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], we ordered by [INVESTIGATOR_5165] -DOT 
per at -risk day. Then we took pairs of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341119] -DOT per at -risk day and 
assigned one member of the pair to one arm. To do this, a single pseudo- random number 
uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 was generated for each pair. If it was l ess than 0.5, the 
arbitrary  “first” member of the pair was assigned to Routine Car e and the other to 
Intervention. If it was greater than or equal to 0.5, then the assignments were reversed. The 
remaining unpaired hospi[INVESTIGATOR_66537] 59 units were assigned as the “first” member of a pai r with 
no match. (Three set s of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341120] a stewardship program and these hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341121] a single hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341122].)  
If an admission was in the intervention arm in the intervention period, then t heir ES -DOT 
per a t-risk day was reduced by a proportion, given below. The reduction of ES -DOT per at -risk 
day was selected with a lower bound determined by [CONTACT_341157]- for effect of 
the intervention with minimal clinical significance, and the impact in t he Monte Carlo calculation 
on a per -admission basis was to reduce the days of therapy proportionately between this 
number and 1, on a uniform distribution. In other words, if the effect of the intervention was to 
multiply doses by [CONTACT_341158] e as .9, each per son would have their doses multiplied by [INVESTIGATOR_82473] .[ADDRESS_422226] 12.5% relative to usual care. Using the method 
above, we have 97% power (CI 91 -99%) to detect this effect. Table  5 below shows the 
calculated power and confidence intervals for the primary and secondary outcomes to be 
evaluated in our primary manuscript.

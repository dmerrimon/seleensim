1. Abstract  
We recently discovered that the walking deficits of people with post -stroke hemiparesis can be 
improved on short timescales by [CONTACT_682811] -belt treadmill conditions that exaggerate 
the deficit. The exaggeration drives the nervou s system to adapt to correct the deficit, and 
results in improved walking patterns when the person returns to normal conditions.  Here, we 
plan to investigate how short -term adaptation can be translated into long -term improvement 
in walking patterns.  In a ddition, we plan to assess economy of gait to determine if there is any 
reduction in rate of energy use (i.e. - metabolic power) when being trained on a split belt 
treadmill versus a conventional treadmill . This would allow us to understand whether this 
training regime, which targets the locomotor pattern, leads to any changes locomotor 
efficiency.  We will study adults with post -stroke hemiparesis before, during and after 
training for 12- weeks on a split -belt treadmill or conventional treadmill.  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_682805] a full scale clinical trial of walking training.  
  
2. Objectives (include all primary and secondary objectives)  
The aim of this project is to determine the effects of long term split belt training versus long term conventiona l treadmill training on spatiotemporal asymmetry, metabolic capacity and 
functional locomotion after stroke.  
 
3. Background  
Recent data shows that walking patterns can be altered through split -belt treadmill training, 
even after central nervous system damage, and that people with cerebral damage from stroke 
can benefit in the short -term to correct asymmetric walking patterns (Reisman et al 2007).  
We have studied short -term adaptation of inter -limb coordination during walking using a 
split-belt treadmill to c ontrol speed of the two legs independently (Reisman et al 2005). Our 
findings demonstrate that walking patterns are adaptable, and that this process is dependent on cerebellar integrity. Our previous work has focused on short term training and we would like to investigate any e ffects that could last with even longer training.

Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_924863] a 10% step length asymmetry and to establish initial measurements for relevant variables and day to day individual subject variability (see step asymmetry testing).  If the potential subjec t does meet the criteria we will 
continue with the study protocol.  If they do not meet this criteria they will not be accrued for the study. We will also use the screening visit to determine the speeds for the treadmill that will be used for the VO
[ADDRESS_924864] (see VO [ADDRESS_924865] for details).  
 There will be two baseline training sessions (Baseline visit 1 and 2, BV1 And BV2).  Subjects who are eligible for the study are then randomized to either the split belt training group or the conventional treadmill training group.  We will use a stratified randomization based on the 
initial gait asymmetry to ensure that subjects of similar severity are represented in each group.  Testing will be repeated after every 11
th training session (trainin g evaluation e.g.-  
TE1, TE2, etc.) and at one (post training 1, PT1) and 3 months (post training 3, PT3) after the completion of training.

be able to be completed, leaving the subject with completing less than [ADDRESS_924870] more than three training visits in one week.  Subjects will also not be allowed to miss more than 3 training sessions in each of the 3 blocks of 11 sessions.  If they do they will be taken out of the study.  
 
 Participants will either train on a conventional treadmill paradigm (belts going the same speed) or they will train on a split -belt treadmil l paradigm (one leg moving faster 
than the other leg).

  Participant’s assignment to which study group they participate in (conventional 
treadmill walking or split -belt treadmill walking) will be randomly assigned (like 
flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin)

final training visit and another will be take 3 months (plus or minus one week) after 
the final training visit.  
 
Clinical Evaluation  
 Clinical Testing will include the following:  
a) lower extremity portion of the Fugl- Meyer Scale which is a test that measures 
coordination, reflexes and the ability to move in and out of synergy.  On day 1 this will 
also include a monof ilament exam of the feet to determine if there is any peripheral 
sensory loss in the feet.   b) [ADDRESS_924872]  which is a measure of short -distance walking speed. This is 
performed according to the protocol of Plummer et al. (2007). Subjects will walk along a 10m walkway with time recorded during the middle 6m to allow for acceleration and deceleration. Subjects will perform [ADDRESS_924873] speeds.  
c) [ADDRESS_924874]-stroke.  
d)Mini Mental State Exam and the Star Cancellation test-  both of these will be completed 
at the screening visit only.  The Mini Metal test is to make s ure that the subjects are 
competent enough to participate in our study and the start cancellation test is to make sure there is no hemi -neglect due to the stroke.  
e) Activities -specific Balance Confidence Scale which is a 16- item self -report 
questionnaire that asks individuals to rate their confidence in performing specific balance -challenging activities on a scale (0- 100).  A score of zero represents no 
confidence and a score of [ADDRESS_924875] -stroke.  
f) Stroke Impact Scale, version 3.[ADDRESS_924876] measure of stroke -
specific outcome. It measures 8 domains (physical problems, memory and thinking, mood and emotions, communication, daily activities, mobility, affected hand, and participation). For this study only data for the mobility and participation domains will be collected and evaluated.   g)Timed up and go test - this test times subjects as they rise from a chair, walk a distance, 
turn around and come back to the chair.    
 
 
 
 
 
Step Asymmetry Testing  
 
This will be done to determine if subjects meet the 10% step asymmetry criteria for 
inclusion in the study.  Spatiot emporal gait characteristics will be measured using the 
GaitRite System (Havertown, PA). The G aitRite system automates measuring temporal 
(timing) and spatial (distance) gait parameters via an electronic walkway connected to 
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_924877] contains six 
sensor pads encapsulated in a roll up carpet to produce an active area 24 inches (61cm) 
wide and 144 inches (366cm) long. In this arrangement the active area is a grid, 48 sensors by 288 sensors placed on .5 inch (1.27 cm) centers, totaling [ADDRESS_924878] at their self -selected comfortable 
walking speed (SSWS) for [ADDRESS_924879] breaks will be provided 
between each trial.  
   
VO 2 walking testing  
  
 We plan to assess the economy of gait for baseline visit 1 and , training evaluation  1- 3 
(end of training), [ADDRESS_924880] oxygen consumption / carbon dioxide production while having the subjects stand as well as 
while they walk on the treadmill at their comfortable over ground  speed . (described 
below).  All subjects, for this test, will walk on the treadmill with both belts moving at 
the same speed, regardless of whether they are in the split belt or conventional 
treadmill group.  This walking and standing data will al low for a determination of 
economy of gait.   
 
 We will use motion analysis to track movement while we do this test.  Prior to testing 
we will place small (dime sized) markers that will be placed bilaterally on the foot (5
th 
metatarsal head), ankle (latera l malleolus), knee (lateral joint space), hip (greater 
trochanter), pelvis (iliac crest) and shoulder (acromion process).  These markers emit 
an infrared light , which our sensors can track in 3D.  A Northern Digital OPTOTRAK 
movement measurement system (wi th 2, 3D position sensors) will be used to collect the 
3-dimensional location of each marker.  Marker position and analog data (treadmill 
belt speeds) will be time locked using OPTOTRACK software, and sampled simultaneously at [ADDRESS_924881] ’s movement on the treadmill.  
  For the VO
[ADDRESS_924882] walking speed  
(both determined at baseline visit 1), depending on how quickly it takes our VO2 measure to reach steady state. T hese speed s will be the same across the study we can 
evaluate whether their VO
2 value changes due to a change in their economy of gait, not 
because of a change in treadmill speed.    
  
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_924883].    The speed of the treadmill will be set to 75% of their comfortable self -selected over 
ground speed as tested in 6 meter walk (Macko et al., 2001).  Patients will be instructed to minimize handrail support to what is necessary for them to keep their balance while 
walking on the treadmill.    
On B aseline Visit 1, the stress test will be done without open circuit spi[INVESTIGATOR_038].  Before 
testing we will have the subject seated for two min utes and then standing for two 
minutes to allow us to get resting blood pressure readings.  The subject will then walk 
for 2 minutes at 0% incline, then 2 minutes at a 4% incline.  After this point the treadmill will increase its incline by 2% every minute until the subject says they can no longer continue or the treadmill reaches its maximum incline at 14%.  There are no breaks during this test as the purpose of it is to determine when the subject reaches fatigue and can no longer continue or they reach the 14% incline.  If they reach 14% we will have the subject continue to walk until either they become fatigued, the cardiologist and/or study team nurse determine it is no longer safe to continue or the subject’s VO
2 values plateau.   
 A nurse will check bl ood pressure (BP) with the subject seated and standing before this 
test, as well as every [ADDRESS_924884].

 Gait Evaluation  
 Gait Evaluation will be completed on baseline visit #1 and #2, Training Evaluation #1- [ADDRESS_924885] at their self -selected comfortable walking speed (SSWS) 
for [ADDRESS_924886] split -belt treadmill in one of two conditions: 1) split -
belt, with the paretic leg on the slow  belt or 2) conventional treadmill with belts tied at 
the same speed.  
 
Treadmill belt speeds will be determined based on a subject’s over ground walking 
speed. For split -belt training, the fast belt will be set to the subject’s fast over ground 
walking sp eed as measured during the [ADDRESS_924887] trained step length and slightly 
decreasing the slow trained leg. For conventional  training, the average s peed will be 
75% of the fast over ground walking speed. If it seems that this speed is too fast for the 
subject (based on a higher than expected heart rate or blood pressure value) we will 
decrease the belt speed by 10%.  For split belt training both the s low and fast belt 
speeds will be decreased by 10%.  Our goal will be to try to get the subject up to their 
overground speed as quickly as possible but we will only increase the speed when the 
Borg rate drops to or below 9.  
 Progression of training speed wi ll occur based on the Borg rating scale.  When the 
subject’s average Borg rate for a single training session drops to [ADDRESS_924888]’s over ground walking 
speed does not seem to have changed when they do the [ADDRESS_924889] their treadmill speed will be increased by 10% in order to bring them to a Borg rating above 9.  The  fast belt speed will equal th e new fastest  walking speed (or the 10% increase 
from the previous speed that the fast belt was going at) and the slow belt speed will be half of that speed.  
 Subjects will train on the treadmill with a goal of at least [ADDRESS_924890] will be instructed to focus on 
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_924891] found changes following 36 sessions (Plummer et al., 2007; Silver et al, 2000).  
 There may be stroke survivors who are not able to complete a total of [ADDRESS_924892] training day.  Subjects will eit her 
receive a reminder email or call (which ever they prefer) at least one week before their follow -ups to confirm that they are still able to come in on the dates that were arranged 
before their last training day.  
 The training will take place in either t he Motion Analysis Laboratory at the Kennedy 
Krieger Institute or the Outpatient Center of the Kennedy Krieger Institute, whichever is available for that particular subject for that particular week.  Participants are required to complete 33  sessions in no more than 16 weeks and to miss not more than 3  
sessions (Plummer et al, 2007).   
During the training sessions, the Borg Scale of perceived exertion (RPE) will be measured every 2 minutes and heart rate will be continuously monitored.  For all sessions, th e guidelines set forth by [CONTACT_25986] (ACSM) 
for individuals in phase III or IV of cardiac rehabilitation will be followed. Based on these guidelines, a session will be terminated if any of the following conditions occur: a) Drop in systolic blood pressure of >
 10mmHg from baseline (resting for that day) 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_682806], b) Hypertensive response with a systolic blood pressure >240 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure >110, c) Presence of nervous system symptoms: ataxia, dizziness, or near syncope, d) Any chest pain or angina symptoms, e) Signs of poor perfusion such as cyanosis or pallor, f) Excessive fatigue, excessive shortness of breath, leg cramps, claudication.  If any of the above occurs, the subject’s physician wi ll be contact[CONTACT_682812]’s response to the activity.  
Subjects can also terminate any session or training bout by [CONTACT_644057]. An exercise bout will be stopped by [CONTACT_682813] a subject reports a rate of perceived exertion of 15 or greater or if their heart rate exceeds his/her Target Heart Rate (THR).  The next five minute training bout will start when all of the following criteria are met: 1) subject states readiness; 2) at least [ADDRESS_924893] has occurred; and 3) RPE of <
8.  
 
Subjects will wear a safety harness during all treadmill training. During over ground walking, subjects will be guarded by [CONTACT_3021].  
 
Returning Subjects  
 
In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we would like to allow subjects to cross over to the other treatment arm 
(i.e. split -belt or conventional treadmill training).  The protocol would be identical  (e.g. 
subject would be cleared by [CONTACT_5936], meet inclusion criteria)  with one exception – we will 
not require the stress test for baseline visit [ADDRESS_924894] returns to the study within 6 
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_924895] over 4 1 total visits.  There will be  1 screening visit,  2 baseline 
visits, with no more than a two  week span between the two, 3 blocks of 11 training 
sessions (to taling 33 training sessions) , [ADDRESS_924896] group assignment 
(conventional vs. split -belt treadmill training) since this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  However, 
subjects will be blinded to our hypothesis and their group assignment (though the split belt group will undoubtedly realize th at they are training at 2 different speeds).  
 
 
d.  Justification of why participants will not receive routine care or will have current therapy stopped. 
All subjects will receive standard care and current therapy will not be stopped.  However, 
we will ask th at they not change their previous therapy or activity level during the course 
of the study.  
 
e.  Justification for inclusion of a placebo or non- treatment group.  
There will not be a placebo or non -treatment group —all subjects will receive training.  
The inclu sion of a conventional treadmill training group will let us begin to assess 
whether split -belt treadmill training is in any way superior to standard treadmill 
training.   
 
f.  Definition of treatment failure or participant removal criteria.  
A subject will be removed from the study if they miss 3 training session visits within a 
block of 11 training sessions .   
 
g.  Description of what happens to participants receiving therapy when study ends or if a participant’s participation in the study ends prematurely.  
If a subject’s participation in the study is ended prematurely, discontinuation of the treadmill training will not be harmful to them. If the participant completes the training we will follow up with them [ADDRESS_924897] and retention.

6. Drugs/ Substances/ Devices  
a. The rationale for choosing the drug and dose or for choosing the device to be used. We are 
using a new type of treadmill with two belts (o ne for each foot) that allows us to make the 
legs move at different speeds.  We have found that short -term training on this device 
temporarily improves walking symmetry in stroke survivors.  Here we will use this device 
in a long term study to try to make long lasting changes in walking symmetry.  We are also using a Parvomedics metabolic cart to measure oxygen consumption and determine if any changes in the gait pattern from training improve each individuals economy of gait. 
b. Justification and safety inform ation if FDA approved drugs will be administered for non -FDA 
approved indications or if doses or routes of administration or participant populations are changed.  N/A  
c. Justification and safety information if non- FDA approved drugs without an IND will be 
administered. N/A  
 
 7. Study Statistics  
a. Primary outcome variable.  
The primary outcome variables for this study will be step symmetry and economy of gait .  
Step symmetry is defined as the difference in the right and left step lengths and tells us how even the steppi[INVESTIGATOR_682807].   We define the economy of gait as the metabolic power, 
which is derived from the rate of O2 consumption and CO2 production, and normalized to the mass of the subject.  This tells us the metabolic cost of walking.  We predict that as subje cts learn to take even steps, the metabolic cost of walking will go down.  
b. Secondary outcome variables.  
The secondary outcome variables for this study will be standard clinical measures including: over ground walking speed, the timed up and go test, [ADDRESS_924898] and between -
group variance for a valid power analysis.

patient to participate as deemed by [CONTACT_682814]   01 
Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_924900]’s confidentiality of sensitive information.  
 
b. Steps taken to minimize the risks.  
Subjects will be given ample rest periods to avoid fatigue. Testing will be stopped if the 
subject becomes too fatigued to continue performing the movement comfortably.   
 Each subject will wear a gait belt during walking and balance tests; one or two investigators will be close by [CONTACT_682815].    If subjects are aware that their skin is sensitive to tape or their skin beco mes irritated by 
[CONTACT_682816], after we place the marker, we will use a stretchy stocking over the skin and then place the marker on the stocking. We will only use this technique if a subject is sensitive to the tape because placement of the marker directly to  the skin provides more precise 
placement.  
 When on the treadmill, all subjects  are placed in a safety harness that is connected to a 
ceiling mounted safety track. Subjects will also have a safety cutoff button and will be tethered to a magnetic safety cu t-off switch, which when pulled, stops the treadmill (e.g. if 
they move too far back on the treadmill). All subjects will hold onto a handrail through the 
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_924901] a researcher who will not only be in charge of the 
metabolic cart computer (which is next to the subject while they are on the treadmill) but we will also have that researcher constantly checking to make sure that the subject is feeling comfortable.  We have different sized mouth pi[INVESTIGATOR_682808].  All mouth pi[INVESTIGATOR_682809].   
 For VO
[ADDRESS_924902] will also view the patient’s EKG 
from baseline visit [ADDRESS_924903] rodes before proceeding with the EKG.   
 
Subjects will also wear a heart rate monitor during testing, and blood pressure will be 
monitored every 5 minutes at a break. We will use 80% of the age -predicted maximum 
heart rate or a Borg scale of perceived exertion of [ADDRESS_924904]’s files and/or data diskettes wil l be kept in a locked file cabinet and access will be 
available only to members of the research team.  Subject files will be identified by [CONTACT_682817]. There will be a master list kept linking the subjects’ names to the unique codes. This list  will be kept on a double password protected computer and only the 
PI, co -investigators and research coordinator will have access to the list. All research 
materials will be kept confidential and all subject identification will be removed for

 analyses and presentations. Data will be presented in the aggregate without identifying 
information. 
 
 
c. Plan for reporting unanticipated problems or study deviations. 
Adverse events and protocol deviations will be reported to the primary investigator, to the 
KKI Office of Research Compliance, JHM IRB, and to the sponsor using the appropriate adverse event reporting form.  
 
d. Legal risks such as the risks that would be associated with breach of confidentiality.  
Legal risks that would be associated with breach of confidential ity are minimal because all 
appropriate steps will be taken to maintain patient confidentiality as described in section 8b. 
 
e. Financial risks to the participants.  
None  
 
9. Benefits  
a. Description of the probable benefits for the participant and for society.  
i.  Individual participant  
There are no known medical benefits for participants at this time.  
Subjects will be informed that there may or may not be an improvement in their walking pattern from the treadmill training.  The methods of the study should provide sensi tive objective measures of motor deficits, which would be 
useful in diagnosis and in monitoring progress or the lack of it across time and therapy. This will be explained to all subjects.  
ii. Society  
This study is an important step towards developi[INVESTIGATOR_682810]. The potential benefits of this study are that we may understand whether specific types of long term locomotor training can help walking performance of people with hemiparesis. The risks to the subjects  are minimal, and the benefit to society could be substantial.  
 
10. Payment and Remuneration 
a. Detail compensation for participants including possible total compensation, proposed bonus, 
and any proposed reductions or penalties for not completing the protocol.

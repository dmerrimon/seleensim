Version Date: 02-01-[ADDRESS_362593] Title: Nicotinic Treatment of Age -Related Cognitive Decline in Down Syndrome:  
An Open Label Pi[INVESTIGATOR_297113] :  Over 50% of adults with Down Syndrome (DS) develop Alzheimer’s disease (AD) 
by [CONTACT_14898] 60  (Nadel 2003) , and life expectancy in DS is now 50-[ADDRESS_362594] extensive experience investigating the role of nicotinic receptors on human 
cognition and impairment. This application takes advantage of new insights into treating Mild Cognitive 
Impairment ( MCI-the precursor condition to Alzheimer’s Disease  (AD) in typi[INVESTIGATOR_297114]) with 
nicotine to propose  an open  label  pi[INVESTIGATOR_297115] -aged non -smoking DS patients 
who show early cognitive and/or behavioral changes consistent with MCI/dementia.  This study will ascertain  
whether nicotine is safe and tolerable in DS patients, help with dose -ranging of nicotine in DS, look for 
evidence of enhanc ements in cognitive functioning,  and establish evidence for biological and behavioral 
correlates of nicotinic stimulation effects.  Positive results on safety and cognitive or functional indices would 
lead to a proposal for a larger and longer double -blind trial. The knowledge gained from the translational 
aspects of this project may also  guide the application o f new nicotinic drugs in DS and generate, for the first 
time, data on the importance of nicotinic receptor changes in the development of cognitive impairment in DS 
adults.  
 
Specific Aims:  The goal of this study is to establish preliminary evidence for safety, gain preliminary evidence 
as to whether nicotine enhances cogn itive functioning in DS adults , and examine electrophysiological , 
biological, and behavioral correlates of nicotinic stimulation effects.  
 
Research Questions:  
• Will nicotine be safe and well tolerated out to 1 month  in middle aged DS patients with early cognitive 
changes ? 
• Will ni cotine enhance laboratory measures of cognitive performance in adult DS patients with early 
cognitive changes  (pre-post comparison) ? 
• Will nicotine treatment produce positive effects on functioning in DS subjects that are detectable by 
[CONTACT_297141]?  
 
Exploratory research aims: 
• Examine effects on electrophysiologic markers of cognitive status, e.g. visual evoked potentials.  
• Examine interactions between clinical, biological, and cognitive effects  with genes such as APOE, 
CYP2A6, and other behavioral measures . 
 
Hypotheses:  
• Transdermal nicotine treatment will be well tolerated out to one month by [CONTACT_105] -smoking DS patients 
without significant adverse effects.  
• Nicotine will enhance cognitive performance by [CONTACT_297142] -treatment 
testing.  
• Nicotine will enhance functioning detectable by [CONTACT_297143]/or informant ratings (pre -post) . 
 
We propose that positive results on cognitive or funct ional indices that would lead to a larger and longer 
double -blind  trial to test more definitively whether nicotinic stimulation may be cognitively and/or functionally 
enhancing for DS patients. The knowledge gained from the translational aspects of this pr oject will guide the 
development of potentially new nicotinic drugs in DS and generate, for the first time, data on the importance of 
nicotinic receptor changes in the development of cognitive impairment in DS adults. This work also represents 
the first ti me that cutting -edge advances in treating MCI/AD in the general population are immediately and 
rigorously applied to those with DS.  
 
Introduction:  Down syndrome (DS) or trisomy 21, involves an extra copy of the gene for amyloid precursor 
protein (APP), lo cated on chromosome 21. This leads inexorably to an increase in beta amyloid (A β) 
deposition with subsequent plaque and tangle development, the neuropathologic signature [CONTACT_297157]’s 
disease (AD).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_297116], however, not all adults with DS 
develop the clinical manifestations of this disease. To date, only a few risk factors distinguish DS adults who do 
 
 
 2 or do not develop clinical symptoms. Similar to the general population, these risks include advancing ag e, 
reduced estrogen levels, elevated cholesterol, and the presence of the APOE4 allele (Zigman 2007 ).   
In the general population, memory changes or mild cognitive impairments are early warning signs of 
dementia.  In adults with Down syndrome, however, preclinical signs of dementia also i nclude behavioral or 
personality changes , and such depressive symptoms as withdrawal, reduced communication, low mood, 
indifference, and passivity (Ball, Holland et al. 2006 ). Patients gradually develop progressive cognitive 
impairment beginning as early as age 40.  A minority shows regression in adolescence or in the 20s, along with 
marked slowing and depression (Dykens 2012 ).  At least 50% of adults develop an AD -like process culminating 
in dementia by [CONTACT_14898] 60. AD develops in DS individuals with deficits in executive function, attention, and 
memory, with withdrawal and mood changes occurring earlier in the course of illness than in typi[INVESTIGATOR_297117].  
Adults with DS are living longer, with life expectancy moving from 10 years of age in the 1930’s to 58 to 
60 years in 2000 (Bittles 2002 ). Increased longevity is due to access to, and advances i n, pediatric cardiac 
surgery , and improved medical treatments of respi[INVESTIGATOR_297118]. As a result, 
age-associated cogniti ve impairment and dementia is becoming an increasingly pressing concern. The number 
of people with D S 40 years and older is  expected to increase by 100% by 2045 (Larsen 2008 ). Already, the 
average age of the DS population in Scotland is 40 years, and in Australia, 75% of people with D S are 50 
years of age and older (Torr J. 2010 ). Such large cohorts of aging adults add renewed urgency for effective 
treatments that prevent or slow age -related declines in DS. Only a few trials have examined anticholinester ase 
inhibitors  (e.g., donezepil) or antioxidants (e.g., vitamin E) in DS adults with full -blown AD. Inhibitors show a 
modest slowing in disease progression (Prasher V.P. 2003 ). Ideally, however, treatments would improve or 
stabilize cognitive function before  the onset of the disease, and be safe for long -term use, inexpensive and 
easily available. We propose that nicotinic stimulation may be a promising strategy to stabilize or improve 
cognitive functioning in adults with DS, possibly with neuroprotective eff ects.  
 
Rationale /Significance :  Central nervous system (CNS) nicotinic receptors are ligand -gated ion channels that 
chiefly serve to regulate the activity of presynaptic neurotransmitter release (e.g. acetylcholine, dopamine, etc.) 
on to postsynaptic recep tors (Gotti 2004 ). Thus, activation of these receptors may act to amplify or regulate 
ongoing neural activity or to redirect or interrupt activity in the service of attention or cognitive functioning 
(Newhouse P.A. 2011 ). These receptors are widely distributed and are genetically diverse, with at least [ADDRESS_362595] several roles in normal human cognition, 
particularly in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_297119] (Newhouse, Potter et al. 2004 ). Loss of brain nicotinic receptors appears to be a hallmark of late 
stage AD, but relatively preserved in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or early AD. One particular subtype of 
nicotinic receptor ( α7) appears to modulate APP and A β processing and thus, stimulation of this receptor may 
be neuroprotective. DS patients who suffer from dementia in late life may have involvement of these nicotinic 
receptors in AD -like brain changes (Deutsch 2004 ). One prior study showed evidence that a single dose of 
transdermal nicotine improved information processing in DS individuals (Seidl, Teifanthaler et al. 2000 ). 
We have extensive experience investigating the role of nicotinic receptors on human cognitive function 
and the potential therapeutic benefits of nicotinic stimulation. We have sho wn that stimulating neuronal 
nicotinic receptors in Alzheimer's disease improves cognitive performance, while blocking neuronal nicotinic 
receptors impairs several cognitive domains and brain activity including attention, working memory, and 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_297120] y (Newhouse, Potter et al. 1994 ; Newhouse, Potter et al. 2001 ). Importantly, the shift in brain 
activity associated with blocking nicotinic and muscarinic cho linergic receptors during working memory 
replicates the pattern seen in cognitive aging (Newhouse P.A. 2011 ). Imaging data thus further demonstrate 
the importance o f nicotinic receptors in age -related changes in attention and memory.  We also find that 
stimulating nicotinic receptors improves behavioral inhibition and clinical status in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity 
Disorder (Potter and Newhouse 2008 ).   
Recently, we completed a six -month, double -blind trial of transdermal nicotine for amnestic MCI, a 
precursor condition for AD (Newhouse, Kellar et al. 2012 ). In this study, [ADDRESS_362596], nicotine, shows considerable 
promise for improving cognitive and functional symptoms in MCI/early AD, and it may also do so for similar  
stages in DS. The best time to treat cognitive impairment in individuals at risk for cognitive impairment is before 
severe symptoms of cognitive or memory loss becomes established. Since nicotine has not been given over 
this length of time to DS patients,  we thus propose a n initial open -label  safety and efficacy trial of transdermal 
nicotine in adults with DS with early evidence of cognitive dysfunction.  
 
Methods :   We propose an initial, open -label pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (modified A -B-A design) of transdermal nicotine in 
middle -aged non -smoking DS patients who show early cognitive and/or behavioral changes consistent with 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_297121]/dementia.  
 
Subjects:   Adults with DS ( 25+) who show early signs of cognitive dysfuncti on will be included . Individuals will 
be non -smokers, of either sex, and have no active cardiac or neurologic disease.  They will be allowed to be 
taking most CNS active medication ( e.g. antidepressants) as long as the doses of the medications are stable 
for at least three months. Patients taking antipsychotic or anticonvulsant medication will be excluded.  Adults 
will be recruited using well -established community liaisons.  
Screening:   Cognitive dysfunction will be defined as "mild c ognitive impairment" (MCI).  MCI status will be 
based on cognitive tasks  and informant reports that distinguish DS adults with or without cognitive concerns . 
Cognitive screening  will utilize the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test -II. The individually administered KBIT -[ADDRESS_362597]  scores. (Kaufman, A.S., & Kaufman, N.L. 2004).  In addition we will utilize the Arizona Cognitive Test 
Battery for Down Syndrome   (Edgin et al, 2010), a battery specifically designed to identify and track cognitive 
deterioration in DS subjects.  Informant instruments will include the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, the 
Aberrant Behavior Checklist, and the Dementia Questionnaire.  See detailed medical inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and medical screening procedures under “Human Subjects”.   
Treatment:  Followi ng entry into the study, w e plan a gradual titration of nicotine dose from low to at mid  dose  
patches utilizing a daily nicotine patch  worn for 16 hours  per day beginning in the morning . Titration will begin 
by [CONTACT_297144] 1 hour p er day  beginning at 8 AM , and gradually increasing treatment 
time by [CONTACT_297145] (1, 2, 4, 8, 16  hours ) until 16 hours per day is reached. The 
patch will be removed at bedtime.   The patch will be worn daily for 28 days, and then discontinued.  Subjects 
will be assessed at baseline, Days 7 (safety only), 14, 28, and 42 ([ADDRESS_362598] drug discontinuation).  
 
Drug treatment schedule : 
• Week s 1 - 2: 7 mg per day (for 16 hours per day) gradually titrated as indicated above.  
• Weeks 3  - 4: 14 mg per day  (for 16 hours per day).  
• Week s 5 - 6: off treatment

Outcome Measures:   
 
Cognitive Assessment:  We plan to assess cognitive functioning with computerized and noncomputerized 
tests known to be sensitive to nicotinic effects at baseline, 2 weeks  week , and one month after beginning 
treatment as well as 2 weeks after treatment has been discontinued . Neur opsychological tests geared for DS 
will specifically be used. The cognitive battery will take approximately 45 minutes for subjects to complete.  
 
Primary Performance:  
• Continuous Performance Task (CPT) .  Participants see a series of colored objects  appearing one at a 
time on a computer screen. Stimuli appear for [ADDRESS_362599]  appears on the 
computer screen.  
• The Critica l Flicker Fusion  (CFF) task (Kupke and Lewis 1989 ) will be used  as a test of attention and 
vigilance. In an ascending trial, the participant presses a button indicating when the frequency of flashing 
lights, (beginning at 12 Hz and increasing to 50 Hz), has increased to the point that the lights appear to be 
no longer  flashing but rather appear continuously on (“fused”). In a descending trial, beginning at 50 Hz, 
the participant presses a button when the frequency of apparently fused lights is decreased such that 
lights begin to appear to be flashing. The participant n eeds to respond before the frequency hits the upper 
or lower limit in each trial.  
• Choice Reaction Time  (CRT) task as modified from the Milford Test Battery will be used  to examine 
psychomotor speed and response time .  This version of the CRT allows to tal reaction time to be broken 
down into recognition and motor components  (Hindmarch 1984 ). 
 
Secondary Performance:  
• Verbal r ecall  including immediate, delaye d, and forgetting  utilizing a modified Selective Reminding Task  
with individualized baselines established by [CONTACT_094] -testing . 
• Measures of impulsivity  including the Stop Signal Reaction Time task (SSRT) and the Balloon Analog 
Risk Task  (BART).   For the SSRT, we will use a modified/children ’s version of the stop signal and  perform 
a longer training and begin with a shorter delay  than the standard 250 mse c that is  typi[INVESTIGATOR_297122].  
• Executive Function : 4 Trails Conditions from the Dellis -Kaplan Battery.  
• Event -related potentials (ERP)  - a brief temporary change in the EEG in a response to a stimulus - have 
long been used as a non -invasive tool to examine brain functioning (Russeler et al., 2005; Proverbio & 
Zani, 2003; Zani & Proverbio, 2003) .  Variations in ERP peaks are interpreted to reflect  speed (latency) or 
degree (amplitude) of information processing. In addition to the excellent temporal sensitivity, ERPs reflect 
cognitive functioning even in the absence of overt verbal or motor behavioral responses, which makes 
them especially valuable for use in persons with limited ability to provide a reliable overt behavioral 
response, difficulty comprehending instructions, or other issues that make traditional behavioral 
assessments difficult to complete. We will utilize two tasks previously used to  assess memory - and 
learning -related processes in typi[INVESTIGATOR_297123] : 
 
• Novelty detection  (Oddball) task (modeled after Daffner et al, 2006; Jeon & Polich, 2001):   Stimuli : The 
stimuli will include 3 categor ies: (1) a standard stimulus (a blue triangle), 70% frequency; (2) a target 
stimulus (an upside down blue triangle), 15% frequency; and (3) novel stimuli - meaningless line 
drawings shown on ly one time each, 15% frequency.  Procedure : All stimuli will be presented in random 
order for [ADDRESS_362600] : Amplitude and latency of 
the P3 responses to target and novel stimuli.  
 
• Repetition detection  (modeled after Jessen et al., 2002) :  Stimuli : Fifty unfamiliar pi[INVESTIGATOR_297124] a 
drawing of a yellow smiley face will serve as the stimuli. The unfamiliar stimuli will be 50 color 
 
 
 5 photographs of complex indoor and outdoor scenes, including pi[INVESTIGATOR_297125]. Ten of the unfamiliar pi[INVESTIGATOR_297126], yielding 50 repeated pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]. To keep the attention focused, a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_297127] a smiley face will be presented 18 times throughout the session  (brain responses to this 
stimulus will not be included in the analysis). Procedure : All stimuli will be presented in random order for 
[ADDRESS_362601]: Change in ERP responses to repeated pi[INVESTIGATOR_297128] (e.g., first [ADDRESS_362602] 25 trials).  
 
Clinical Measu res: 
• Primary Clinical:  
Global rating scale for DS :  The Dementia Scale for Down Syndrome (Gedye, 1995)  is an informant 
based rating scale designed to give a global assessment of cognition and functioning in DS 
individuals.  
• Secondary Clinical:  
Outcomes will also include structured caregiver and clinician assessments of adaptive fu nctioning 
and problem behav iors including the Aberrant Behavior Checklist  (Brown et al, 2002) .  This scale 
examines maladaptive behavi ors in 5 domains: Irritability, L ethargy/Withdrawal,  Stereotypic 
Behavior, Hyperactivity, Inappropriate Speech.  The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales -II (Sparrow, 
Cicchetti, & Balla, 2005  is a semi -structured interview with parents or informants  that identifies the 
performance of behaviors required for personal or social self - sufficiency.  
 
Safety Measures :  At the scre ening day, a CRC nurse will collect v ital signs  and specimen samples (urine) for 
Urinalysis. An  ECG  will be performed, and participant and caregiver will answer a comprehensive 
questionnaire  at every study visit (Day 7, Day 14, Day 28, and Day 42)  to assess any side effects or adverse 
events resulting from study medication.  
 
All participants will be exp ected to progress to the 14mg dose after the second week of the study, provided 
they are tolerating the medi cation. However, participants who experience persistent nausea, vomiting and 
dizziness at the 7mg dose (indicating that the higher dose will not be tolerated) will not progress to the 14mg 
dose.  
 
Compensation:  Caregivers/guardians will be reimbursed  for their time and trouble at $250 for the entire study 
prorated at $[ADDRESS_362603]  for their compensation for  participation.  
 
Data Analysis/Power Calculation:  
This is primarily an open -label safety and tolerability study;  thus, statistical analysis of data is mostly 
descriptive. Tabulation of safety information, examination of vital signs changes  over time, and preliminary 
examination of cognitive performance and global ratings over time will be the primary analytic approach.  
Safety Outcome : Tolerability and safety will be determined by [CONTACT_297146], 
counting dropouts due to adverse events, and by [CONTACT_297147] a need to reduce the dose of 
nicotine as determined by [CONTACT_2299] /caregiver  and the physician.  Abnormalities in vital signs, physical 
examination, and laboratory tests will be collected by [CONTACT_3148]. Adverse events will be recorded and 
categorized by [CONTACT_297148], event type, attribution, frequency, severity, and course.  Changes in vital signs will 
be assessed using one-way repeated -measures ANOVA with time as the within -subjects factor.  
Cognitive Performance : Comparison of the baseline (Day 0) with Day [ADDRESS_362604] of change in performance over time  (0, 14, 28, 42 
days).   Significant improvement from baseline and/or loss of effect after treatment withdrawal  (effect of time) 
will be considered a positive result.  
Behavioral/Functional Assessments:  Comparison of the baseline (Day 0) with Day 28 will be 
performed with paired t -tests  for the behavioral scales as in the analysis of the cognitive performance batter y.  
Individual items and totals of the behavioral measures  will be compared descriptively.  
Global Ratings : Analysis will compare global ratings for nicotine treatment examining baseline vs end 
of treatment study  (paired t -test), and [ADDRESS_362605] treatment  ratings.  Age, APOE and CYP2A6 genotype, and 
 
 
 6 cognitive scores at baseline may be examined for influence on results.  
 
Sample Size:  Sample size calculations are challenging for an open label tolerability and cognitive feasibility 
study. However, in  the Seidl study of a single dose of nicotine in DS patients, significant results on ERP 
measures were seen with as few as  4 patients. Considering that we are administering the medication for a 
longer period of time with multiple testing sessions, we feel based on prior studies with nicotine and nicotine 
patch (e.g. in our Parkinson's disease  study ), that a sample size of 15 enrolled to obtain a final cohort of 10 
subjects is appropriate for testing initial safety , dose -ranging, and feasib ility. 
Human Subjects:  
 
SUBJECT SELECTION AND EVALUATION: Initial screening of recruited subjects will be performed by [CONTACT_224192] .  If a subject passes screening, he/she will be brought in for initial medical evaluation that 
will be performed by a Nurse Prac titioner or physician. At baseline, a complete medical history and physical 
exam will be performed to ensure good general health.  Medical history will be obtained from the informant and 
available medical records.  Information on allergies, all current med ications, and present and past use of 
tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs will be collected. Subjects cognitively and behaviorally screened by [CONTACT_297149].  Laboratory and electrocardiogram screening will take place on the GCRC 
or OP clinic.  The detailed screening packet including medical history, physical and neurological examination, 
laboratory testing, ECG, cognitive testing, behavioral screening, and consent form will be reviewed by [CONTACT_28824]  [INVESTIGATOR_297129] .  
 
Diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment: The criteria for the diagnosis of MCI used in this study with DS 
patients will consist of the following criteria similar to the criteria for amnestic MCI (Petersen et al. 2001) : 
 
1.  Declining cognitive fun ction  corroborated by [CONTACT_51670].  
2.  Impaired memory function compared to prior testing . 
3.  Preserved general cognitive function.  
4. Generally i ntact activities of daily living.  
5. Not demented.  
 
Specific Inclusion and Exclusion criteria:  
Inclusion:  
1. Cognitiv e complaints and /or memory difficulties which are verified as new onset by [CONTACT_51670].  
2. Cognitive Global Rating consistent with mild impairment or deterioration from premorbid baseline.  
3. General cognition and functional performance sufficiently preserved such that a diagnosis of 
Alzheimer’s disease /dementia  cannot be made by [CONTACT_65846].  
4. No significant cerebrovascular disease:  Modified Hachinski score of less than or equal to 4.  
5. Age 25+. 
6. Stable medications fo r at least [ADDRESS_362606] (e.g. an average of 10 hours per week 
or more).  
9. Adequate visual and audi tory acuity to allow neuropsychological testing.  
10. Good general health with no additional diseases expected to interfere with the study..  
11. ECG without clinically significant abnormalities that would be expected to interfere with the study.  
12. Subject is not preg nant, lactat ing. 
13. Subjects will be taking no drugs with cholinergic properties (e.g donepezil) . 
14. Agreement not to take other vitamin or supplements other than multivitamins.  
15. Negative urine pregnancy test in females.  
 
Exclusion:  
1. Any significant neurologic disease such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multi -infarct 
dementia, Huntington’s disease, normal pressure hydrocephalus, brain tumor, progressive 
supranuclear palsy, seizure disorder, subdural hematoma, multiple scl erosis, or history of significant 
head trauma followed by [CONTACT_65847].  
 
 
 [ADDRESS_362607] 2 years (DSM IV criteria).  
4. Any significant systemic illness or unstable medical condition which could lead to difficulty complying 
with the protocol including:  
a) History of myocardial infarction in the past year or unstable or severe c ardiovascular disease 
including angina or CHF with symptoms at rest.  
b) Clinically significant obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma.  
c) Clinically significant and unstable gastrointestinal disorder such as ulcer disease or a history of 
active or occult gastro intestinal bleeding within two years.  
d) Clinically significant laboratory test abnormalities on the battery of screening tests (urinalysis, ECG).  
e) Insulin -requiring diabetes or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.  
f) Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic BP> 170 or diastolic BP> 100).  
5. Use of any investigational drugs within 30 days or 5 half -lives, whichever is longer, prior to screening.  
 
Subjects with major concomitant illnesses will be excluded on the basis of history, physical exam, and 
laboratory tests assessing  cardiovascular and  renal function. ( U/A, ECG).   
 
Cognitive Screening:  This will use the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test -II (KBIT -2). The individually 
administered KBIT -[ADDRESS_362608] scores. (Kaufman, A.S., & Kaufman, N.L. 2004).  In addition we will utilize the 
Arizona Cognitive Test Battery for Down Syndrome  (ACTB)  (Edgin et al, 2010), a battery specifically designed 
to identify and track cognitive deterioration in DS subjects. The ACTB includes neuropsychological 
assessments chosen to assess a range of skills  and be non -verbal so as to not confound the 
neuropsychological a ssessment with language demands. The ACTB includes tests of general cognitive ability 
and prefrontal, hippocampal and cerebellar function.   Finally, we will use the Dementia Scale for Down 
Syndrome (DSDS) (Gedye, 1995) . The DSDS is a [ADDRESS_362609] (Brown et al, 2002).  This scale 
examines maladaptive behaviors in 5 domains: Irritability, Lethargy/Withdrawal, Stereotypic Behavior, 
Hyperactivity, Inappropriate Speech. In addition, t he Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales -II (Sparrow, Cicchetti, 
& Balla, 2005 ) is a semi -structured interview with parents or informants that identifie s the performance of 
behaviors required for personal or social self - sufficiency.  
 
At the end of the screening process, the principal  investigator [INVESTIGATOR_297130]’s general cognitive and functional 
performance is sufficiently preserved such that a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease cannot be established at the 
time of the screening evaluation.  
 
CONSENT /ASSENT:  It is assumed that all subjects in this trial will have a legal guardian.  Informed consent 
(from the guardian) and assent (from the subject) will be obtained by [CONTACT_473].  Each subject and 
his/her guardian will receive an oral and a wri tten explanation of the purposes, procedures and potential 
hazards of this study.  A record of the communication of this information and the subject's  assent  and guardian 
's (if appropriate) informed consents will be entered into the subject's medical reco rd. Each MCI patient will be 
individually assessed by [CONTACT_297150]/consent .  Criteria for assessing this capacity 
will be those of the President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine (The Preside nts 
Commission for the Study of the Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research 1982) .  
Guidelines developed at the NIH Clinical Center for consent with impaired subjects (Fletcher a nd Wichman 
1987 ) will also be followed for the involvement of family members in the consent process.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8 POTENTIAL RISKS/DRUG SAFETY:   NICOTINE TRANSDERMAL PATCH  
 
Side Effects of Nicotine:  At the nicotine doses proposed in this study, the major peripheral action of nicotine 
is facilitation of impulses through all autonomic ganglia, stimulation of the adrenal medulla and stimulation of 
sensory receptors including chemoreceptors in the caroti d body.  Ganglionic depression occurs at higher 
nicotine levels.  In cardiovascular systems, mild increases in heart rate and blood pressure from sympathetic 
ganglion stimulation, catecholamine release from adrenal medulla, and aortic and carotid body chem oreceptor 
stimulation may occur.  A mild parasympathetic response may be seen in the gastrointestinal tract and bladder 
(increased tone and motor activity), with increased secretion of exocrine glands.  Nausea and vomiting can 
occur from peripheral (bowel activity and vagal efferent nerve stimulation) and central (medullary emetic 
chemoreceptor trigger zone stimulation) causes.  Low dose stimulation of the CNS could in theory produce 
tremors and respi[INVESTIGATOR_29812], although this is rarely seen except i n patients with tremor disorders.  Toxic 
nicotinic doses result in CNS depression. With use, tolerance develops to virtually all acute adverse effects.  
 
General Safety Experience with the Nicotine Transdermal Patch:  A large meta -analysis was conducted 
exam ining data from 35 clinical trials utilizing the transdermal nicotine patch in over 5500 individuals 
(Greenland, Satterfield et al. 1998 )(Greenland et al. 1998) . Few adverse cardiovascular outcomes were 
reported and no excess of these outcomes was detected among patients assigned to nicotine patch use 
compared t o placebo patch users.  Minor adverse effects such as sleep disturbances, nausea, localized skin 
irritation, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_297131].   
 
In our recently published MCI trial  [REF], t otal adverse events (AEs) for the double -blind treatment period were 
82 for nicotine versus 52 for placebo (p < 0.05). However, the majority of AEs were mild (nicotine 57.3 %; 
placebo 54.9%) and there was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of adv erse events within 
the different severity classifications between treatments (Mann -Whitney test p = 0.97). No severe AEs were 
classified as related to drug treatment in either treatment group.  Adverse event rates by [CONTACT_283453] 10% of subjects (Figure) were generally comparable with the exception of 
gastrointestinal and neurological for which there were more AEs reported in the nicotine -treated group.  
Approximately 75% of AEs in both placebo and nicotine groups were judged not relat ed or doubtfully related to 
treatment. More nicotine -treated subjects (4) discontinued treatment for adverse events than placebo -treated 
subjects (0) (X2 (1) = 3.79; p = 0.05).  No withdrawal symptoms were reported by [CONTACT_297151].  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dermatologic Safety:  The most common adverse side effect of the nicotine transdermal patch is skin irritation 
and accounted for approximately 25 percent of adverse event reports regarding the nicotine transdermal patch 
to the FDA (Spyker, Alderfer et al. 1998 ).  These effects consist of erythema, pruritus, edema, and rash.  Mild 

 
 
 9 skin irritation is common and generally occurs after three weeks of continuous use.  Mild to moderate 
reddening of the skin is seen in 25% of subjects and transient itching in 29%. More severe reactions requiring 
modification of treatment have been reported in up to 12% of users (DrugDex Drug Evaluation Monograph). 
Management of the symptoms is usually straightforward and is accomplished by [CONTACT_297152], local 
treatments, and instructing the patient to remove the patch prior to going to bed. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_297132] a non -smoking patient with Huntington's disease for 
movement disorder control.  This long -term exposure has been extremely well tolerated with only minor skin 
irritation seen.  
 
Cardiovascula r Safety:  There are a number of mechanisms whereby [CONTACT_283455] (Benowitz 1998 ).  Nicotine stimulates CNS sympathetic sys tems and 
increases release of catecholamines from both the adrenal and vascular nerve endings.  While tolerance 
appears to develop to these cardiac stimulatory effects, the tolerance developed is only partial (Benowitz 
1998a) .  While there may be a small chronic cardio -stimulatory effect (approxima tely seven beats per minute), 
the dose response curve appears to be flat (Benowitz 1998 ).  
 
However, studies have not demonstrated th at nicotine replacement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_283427] (DrugDex Drug Evaluation 
Monograph).  The largest and longest such study was the Lung Health Study that enrolled alm ost 6000 
individuals in a study over 5 years involving nicotine replacement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_277652].  In this 
group with chronic lung disease, nicotine use was found to be marginally protective of cardiovascular health 
compared to non -use of nicoti ne (Murray and Daniels 1998 ).  This protective effect persisted even when 
adjusted for smoking status.  Even within the ex -smoking sub -group in the same study, nicotine users had 
substantially lower rates of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_283428] -users.  Nicotine also showed a marginally protectiv e effect 
against peptic ulcer disease in the same subjects.  In a long -term maintenance study of non -smoking patients 
with ulcerative colitis, there were no increased cardiovascular events and markers of cardiovascular risk either 
did not change or actuall y decreased (e.g. fibrinogen) (Rhodes, Green et al. 1998 ). A recent investigation of the 
effects of 26 weeks of chronic oral nicotine showed improved cardiova scular risk parameters (e.g. capi[INVESTIGATOR_297133], fibrinogen) after smoking cessation with no negative effects of nicotine (Haustein, Haffner et al. 2002 ). 
Nicotine does not appear to promote thrombosis or platelet aggregation nor does nicotine replacement therapy 
increase the risk of acute myocardial infarction ( DrugDex Drug Evaluation Monograph).  
 
Studies of patients with known cardiovascular disease have similarly not shown an increase in cardiovascular 
events or toxicity secondary to nicotine therapy.  Two large studies of men with documented coronary artery 
disease with up to 10 weeks of nicotine therapy showed lower rates of cardiovascular endpoints and events in 
the nicotine -treated group (Rennard, Daughton et al. 1998 ).  A study of myocardial perfusion in men with 
coronary artery disease showed that cigarette smoking was associated with significantly greater myocardial 
perfusion deficits than nicotine therapy alone, su ggesting that such a perfusion defect is due to factors from 
tobacco other than nicotine.  In reviewing the available clinical trial literature and data reported to the FDA as of 
1998, Rennard and colleagues concluded: "the available clinical trial and the  clinical experience reported to 
date are consistent with the relative safety of transdermal nicotine in stable patients with cardiac disease."  
 
MCI Study:   An examination of the change in systolic blood pressure revealed a significant reduction in 
systolic blood pressure compared to placebo treatment (Figure  below ). By [CONTACT_4475] 182, the placebo group showed 
an average increase of 9.[ADDRESS_362610] (p = 0.51).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cerebrovascular Safety:  Smoking is a preventable risk factor for ischemic stroke and some preclinical studies 
have suggested potential mechanisms by [CONTACT_29872]/or nicotine might increase the risk of ischemic 
stroke (Gerzanich, Zhang et al. 2001 );(Hawkins, Brown et al. 2002 );(Zidovetzki, Chen et al. 1999 ). However, a 
large meta -analysis of 35 smoking cessation trials did not fi nd any increased incidence of stroke in nicotine 
replacement therapy users (Greenland, Satterfield et al. 1998 ).  
 
Conclusion regarding cardio - and cerebrovascular safety: As the subjects to be enrolled in this study will be 
nonsmokers selected for the absence of significant cardiovascular, cerebrovascular disease, or diabetes, we 
believe that the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk profile of transdermal nicotine in such patients is 
excellent.  
 
Insulin Sensitivity:  There have been some epi[INVESTIGATOR_29819] a positive relationship between 
smoking and insulin resistance (Mikhailidis, Papadakis et al. 1998 ) although some studies are contradictory 
(Henkin, Zaccaro et al. 1999 ). Some investigations have suggested that changes in insulin sens itivity may be 
restricted to smokers who are also diabetic (Targher, Alberiche et al. 1997 ).  One study that did examine long -
term nicotine use without cigarette smoking showed that nicotine gum users had higher  circulating leptin levels 
that were negatively correlated with the degree of insulin sensitivity (Eliasson and Smith 1999 ).  Howev er, the 
subjects were also recent ex -smokers, complicating interpretation of these results and acute administration of 
nicotine during the study did not change circulating leptin levels.  Contradictory results were also seen in 
studies of smokeless tobacco  use on cardiovascular risk factors and insulin levels with one study of heavy 
users finding impaired measures of glucose tolerance (Persson, Carlsson et al. 2000 ) while another study did 
not (Eliasson, Asplund et al. 1995 ). At this point, it is not clear that nicotine use alone in nonsmokers is 
associated with changes in insulin sensitivity.  
 
Carcinogenesis:   Nicotine alone has not been shown to be carcinogenic.  Long -term epi[INVESTIGATOR_297134] s of 
oral tobacco use suggest that the nitrosamine content of tobacco is critical to determining the cancer risk from 
non- smoke related tobacco use, rather than nicotine (Benowitz 1998 ).  Whether nicotine can act as a 
permissive agent to encourage the development of cancer is unclear, but it does not seem to have any effect 
unless co -administered with tobacco (Benowitz 1998 ). 
 
Safety Experience in Cognitively Impaired individuals:  We have extensive experience in administering 
nicotine and novel nicotinic agonists to patients with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (Newhouse, 
Sunderland et al. 1988 );(Newhouse, Potter et al. 1996 );(Potter, Corwin et al. 1999 ) .  We have performed over 
[ADDRESS_362611] been seen and no other significant side effects other than nausea and/or 
vomiting have occurred.  We have also administered nicotine by [CONTACT_283456]'s disease (Kelton, Kahn et al. 2000 ).Tolerability was excellent, even up to 22 mg 
nicotine patch per day.  Only minor gastrointestinal upset was seen that was easily managed by [CONTACT_147842].  No incidences of cardiovascular symptoms or difficulties occurred.  
 
Chronic nicotine has been administered transdermally by [CONTACT_283457] (Fagerstrom, Pomerleau et al. 1994 ; Parks, Young et al. 
1994 ; Katayama, Hirata et al. 1995 ; Wilson, Langley et al. 1995 ; Kelton, Kahn et al. 2000 ) without significant 
problems.  No signif icant cardiovascular problems have been documented.  In the Wilson study, a 22 mg 
nicotinic patch was given to elderly demented AD patients continuously for 8 days without significant side

 11 effects.  Effects of the patch included 5 beat -per-minute increase in heart rate (average over 24 hrs), and mild 
increase in ectopy (ventricular ectopi[INVESTIGATOR_297135] 0.40 -0.54%).  There was, however, no ischemia or 
nausea.  Patients reported a vague feeling of lightheadedness, and some had mild behavioral changes 
(belligerence and non -compliance).  
 
Weight :  In our recently published MCI study  [REF], e xamination of the change in body weight across visits 
showed that the nicotine -treated group showing a significant decline in body weight by [CONTACT_4475] 91 compared to 
placebo ( -2.6 kg versus -.11 kg for the placebo -treated subjects). However the nicotine -treated group stabilized 
and no further decline in weight occurred through day 182.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Abuse Potential:  We believe that the probability that the subjects in this study might be prompted by [CONTACT_283458].  There have been no 
cases reported in the medical literature of primary abus e by [CONTACT_283459][INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Furthermore, there are no cases reported of ex -smokers taking up nicotine replacement therapy and becoming 
addicted or dependent.  Additional reasons for our belief that the risk of abuse of transderma l nicotine in this 
population include:  
 
1) Nicotine replacement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_283430] (Hughes, Strickler et al. 1989 ) .  A 
recent study showed that non -smoking adolescents (the most vulnerable group to smoking initiation) are 
extremely unlikely to be interested in taking up nicotine replacement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_297136] -the-counter nicotine replacement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (Adams, Korberly 
et al. 2001 ). Surveys from almost 200,[ADDRESS_362612] as a "gate way drug" did not seem tenable.  
 
2) Nicotine patches have some unpleasant side effects and therefore are unlikely to be reinforcing.  The 
administration will be blinded.  
 
3) A study by [CONTACT_297153] (Fertig, Sayler et al. 1982 ; Seyler Jr., Pomerleau et al. 1986 )  showed that exp erimental 
administration of tobacco did not induce ex -smokers to relapse into smoking.  In another study (Hughes, 
Strickler et al. 1989 ), when non -smokers and ex -smokers were followed after participating in a study of 
nicotine gum administration, no subjects were found to be smoking or using other nicotine products three 
months following completion of the study.  
 
4) An important characteristic of all drugs that produce dependency is the pharmacokinetic parameters 
associated with t he route and form of administration (Farre and Cami 1991 ). With respect to nicotine,

 12 researchers of the NIDA Addiction Research Center (Henningfield and Keenan 1993 ), as well as others in 
the field (Pomerleau 1992 );(Marks, Stitzel et al. 1987 );(Rose, Westman et al. 1996 );(Shytle, Silver et al. 
1996 ), have reported that the slower absorption of nicotine offered by [CONTACT_297154].  Thi s 
was supported by a study describing a double -blind placebo -controlled study investigating the therapeutic 
potential of the transdermal nicotine patch for patients suffering from ulcerative colitis (Rhodes, Green et al. 
1998 ). Although all of the subjects were adults and many former tobacco users, despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] 26 weeks of daily 
applications of 15 mg nicotine patches, no withdrawal symptoms were reported from these patients 
following discontinuation of the patch.  In addition, a crossover trial evaluating the "liking" rating for the 
patch (22mg or 44 mg/24hr) in adults found no difference in scores between the active and placebo 
systems (Bunker, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_172454]. 1992 ).  
 
5) We have administered intravenous and/or transdermal nicotine and structurally related nicotinic agonists 
over the past 17 years to several hund red non -smoking subjects including young and elderly normal 
volunteers, patients with Alzheimer's disease, and patients with Parkinson's disease.  We have not had a 
single subject take up tobacco use as a consequence of study participation.  
 
6) In studies tre ating adolescents with Tourette’s Syndrome with nicotine patches, researchers reported no 
known cases of participants craving nicotine or beginning to smoke following exposure to transdermal 
nicotine as part of a research treatment protocol. Specifically, none of the children with Tourette’s 
Syndrome who had been treated repeatedly (19 days) with the transdermal nicotine patch reported that 
they felt “addicted to” or “craved” the nicotine patch when it was discontinued (Shytle, Silver et al. 1996 ). 
 
7) A recent trial of transdermal nicotine has been conducted in children with ADHD (Shytle, Silver et al. 2002 ) 
utilizing transdermal nicotine patch in 10 children (mean age of 10) for a one -week period.  While some 
expected nicotinic side e ffects occurred during the acute trial (e.g. nausea), no tobacco use or nicotinic 
product abuse has been seen in these children thus far in follow -up. 
 
8) Perhaps most importantly, in our recently completed MCI trial , no withdrawal symptoms were reported by 
[CONTACT_297155].  
 
The safeguards that we have instituted that are described above taken in conjunction with data docu menting 
that the administration of nicotine via non -tobacco routes is not associated with abuse liability, suggests that 
the incremental additional risk to subjects for tobacco use over and above their background use rate is likely to 
be very small.  
 
RISK/ BENEFIT RATIO: When the safety record outlined above is considered, the risks of participation in this 
study are low.  The risks mainly consist of temporary side -effects from the nicotine and/or the transdermal 
patch that do not constitute a serious danger  when administered within a medical environment.  Long -term 
cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and neurological safety of transdermal nicotine appears to be very favorable. 
Subjects may benefit from cognitive improvement and delay in progression of the demen tia associated with 
DS. The benefits to society of greater knowledge about the treatment of the cognitive changes associated with 
pathologic aging in DS  and their possible amelioration, considering the human and economic costs of th is 
disorder, would appea r great.  Overall the risk/benefit ratio appears to be in favor of conducting these studies.

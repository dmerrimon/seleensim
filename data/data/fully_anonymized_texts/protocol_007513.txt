Study Design:  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_117475] a gluten -free diet (GFD), many individuals with celiac disease (CeD) continue to 
have symptoms and/or intestinal damage due to inadvertent gluten exposure. TAK -062 is a computationally 
designed enzyme intended to reduce or prevent symptoms and intestinal damage related to gluten exposur e. This 
is a 2 -cohort phase 2, multicenter, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled study to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of TAK -062 for treatment of ongoing symptoms and small intestinal mucosal injury due to gluten 
exposure in subjects with CeD attempting to maintain a GFD. In addition, this study is designed to further 
evaluate the psychometric properties of the Celiac Disease Symptom Diary (CDSD)  Version (v)2.[ADDRESS_131020] 12 months, will be enrolled and randomly 
assigned into 1 of 2 treatment groups in the Cohort 1 proof of concept study and 1 of 6  treatment groups in the 
Cohort 2 dose -ranging study (see the Number of Subjects secti on below):  
The interim analysis (IA) will be initiated when at least 75% of the subjects in Cohort [ADDRESS_131021] dropped out to determine inclusion of adolescents in Cohort 2. Cohort 1 data will 
be reviewed by [CONTACT_117510] (IDMC) and shared with health authorities 
and independent ethics committees (IECs)/institutional review boards (IRBs) as required by [CONTACT_11338], before 
enrollment of adolescents in Cohort 2. If efficacy and safety d ata from Cohort 1 is considered acceptable, Cohort 
2 will also include adolescents aged 12 to 17  years. Adolescents will receive only gluten -free simulated 
inadvertent gluten exposure (SIGE) bars.  
This study will consist of 4 periods in each cohort: a 2 - to 4-week screening period (Week -8 to Week -4), a 
4-week single -blind placebo run -in (Week -4 to Day -1), a 24 -week double -blind treatment period (Week 0 to
Week 24), and a [ADDRESS_131022] visit (Week -8), subjects will consume  1 gluten -free
SIGE bar to ensure no intolerance to any of the nongluten components of the bar. During the screening period
(between Week -8 visit to Week -4 visit), subjects will complete the CDSD  daily to confirm they have at least
1 ongoing CeD -related gastrointestinal (GI) symptom of moderate or greater severity on at least 3 days out of
any consecutive 7 -day period. The CeD -related symptom(s) may vary day by [CONTACT_117511] 1  symptom is moderate or greater. Eligible subjects wil l undergo an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)
with duodenal biopsy . In addition, a subset of
approximately [ADDRESS_131023]/re -test assessment.  During the screening period, urine samples will be collected once per
week for gluten immunogenic peptide (GIP) to assess systemic exposure to gluten .
During the single -blind run -in period (Week -4 through Day -1), subjects will receive TAK -062 placebo

CONFIDENTIAL  . Beginning Week -8, urine samples (first morning void) will be collected once per week 
for GIP throughout the study.  
 
 
 While all efforts should be made  to obtain weekly urine 
samples, missed urine GIP samples will not be considered a protocol deviation.  
Eligible subjects with villous atrophy on duodenal biopsy (defined as villous height –to–crypt depth ratio [Vh:Cd] 
<2.5 by [CONTACT_117512]) w ill be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups in Cohort 1 or 1 of 
6 treatment groups in Cohort 2 to receive double -blind treatment and gluten -containing SIGE or gluten -free 
SIGE (Cohort 2) for 24  weeks (Day 1 through Week  24). Initially, all subjects  who meet symptom criteria and 
histologic criteria will be randomized. If more than 10% of planned enrollment in a cohort report a greater than 
1 point improvement in Patient Global Impression of Severity during  run -in period (Week -2 through 
Day -1), further subjects showing this degree of improvement will be excluded from the cohort.  
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_117513] 1, defined as normal or elevated celiac 
serology (1 or more of the following: IgA -tissue transgl utaminase (tTg) >1  time the upper limit of normal 
[ULN], IgA –deaminated gliadin peptide [DGP] >2  × ULN, or IgG -DGP >2 × ULN), mild to moderate (Vh:Cd 
1.5 to <2.5) versus moderate to severe (Vh:Cd <1.5) histologic injury at baseline, and by [CONTACT_117514] (PPIs) or histamine type 2  receptor antagonists (yes or no) at Visit 1.  
In Cohort 1, all subjects will consume gluten -containing SIGE bars  
with a meal  
In Cohort 2, adult subjects will receive either gluten -containing or gluten -free SIGE bars with a meal  
 throughout the treatment period.  
 
 It is expected that SIGE will 
result in s table, rather than worsening, symptoms and enteropathy in the TAK -[ADDRESS_131024] 
has severe symptoms of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal spasm, that are related to their CeD symptoms, 
the use of the medications to treat these seve re symptoms will be considered as rescue medications.  
Subjects will report symptoms daily using the CDSD from Week -8 through Week 24.  
EGD with biopsy will again be performed at the end of the 24 -week treatment period (Week 24).  
  
Sparse blood samples to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of TAK -062 in plasma will be collected in all 
subjects at Weeks -4, 0, 3, 12, 24, and 28. Approximately 10 adult su bjects enrolled in Cohort 1 and 30 adult 
subjects enrolled in Cohort 2 will participate in the PK subgroup for slightly more intensive collections at

7. Completed the CDSD on ≤75% of evaluable days during the run -in period until randomization.  
Main Criteria for Evaluation and Analyses:  
The primary endpoint is:  
• Change in weekly CDSD GI symptom severity score from baseline (Week -1) to Week 12.  
The secondary endpoints are:  
• Change in Vh:Cd from baseline (measured at Week -4) to Week 24.  
The safety endpoints are:  
• Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAE), serious adverse events (SAEs), treatment -related TEAEs, 
electrocardiogra phic findings  (electrocardiogram) , vital  signs, laboratory parameters, and immunogenicity 
(posttreatment, positiv e antidrug antibodies [ADA s] in serum for TAK -062).  
Statistical Considerations:  
Analysis Sets:  
Full analysis set (FAS) –SIGE: All randomized subjects who are randomized to receive gluten -containing SIGE 
bar.  
FAS–no SIGE: All randomized subjects who are randomized to gluten -free SIGE bar.  
Safety analysis set (SAF): All randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  
SAF–SIGE: All randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug and gluten -containing SIGE bar.  
SAF–no SIGE: All randomized subjects who rec eived at least 1 dose of study drug and gluten -free SIGE bar.  
Per-protocol set (PPS) –SIGE: All subjects in FAS -SIGE who do not violate the terms of the protocol in a way 
that would impact the study outcome. All decisions to exclude subjects for the PPS -SIGE will be made before 
the unblinding of the study.  
The PK analysis set: All randomized subjects who received at least [ADDRESS_131032] 1 measured 
PK concentration.  
Immunogenicity analysis set: All randomized subjects who received any T AK-[ADDRESS_131033] 1 postbaseline immunogenicity sample assessment.  
Efficacy Analysis:  
Primary Efficacy Analysis : The primary efficacy analysis will be based on FAS -SIGE. The weekly  CDSD GI 
symptom severity score is an average of the daily GI symptom severity scores during the week. The daily GI 
symptom severity score is the average of the severity score for diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating and nausea, 
ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (very severe). Weekly CDSD GI symptom severity scores will be calculated 
where the CDSD is completed on at least 4 of the 7 days. When the daily diary is completed on less than 4 of the 
7 days, the weekly  CDSD GI symptom severity score will be considered missing. The attributes of the primary

CONFIDENTIAL  estimand are:  
• Population: Subjects with clinically active CeD and small intestinal villous atrophy who are experiencing 
inadvertent gluten exposure and meet all eligibility criteria.  
• Variable/endpoint: Chan ge in weekly  CDSD GI symptom severity score from baseline to Week  12 
• Treatments: TAK -062 ( ) versus placebo.  
• Intercurrent events (ICEs): Treatment discontinuation (due to adverse events [AEs] or other reasons), SIGE 
discontinuations,  and use of rescue medications for CeD symptoms.  
Strategy for addressing ICEs: A composite strategy will be used to address rescue medication use and 
treatment discontinuation due to lack of efficacy or treatment -related AEs. For subjects who use rescue 
medications for CeD -related symptoms, the severity of the treated  GI symptom(s) in CDSD on the days 
when the rescue medications are used will be set to very severe. For subjects who discontinue treatment due 
to lack of efficacy or treatment -related AEs, the Week 12 CDSD GI symptom severity score will be set to 
the baseline (Week -1) weekly CDSD GI symptom severity score.  A treatment policy  strategy will be used 
to address SIGE discontinuation (ie, the recorded weekly CDSD GI symptom severity scores will be us ed 
regardless of whether a subject has discontinued SIGE) and  treatment discontinuation due to reasons  other 
than lack of efficacy or treatment -related AEs.  
• Population -level summary: Treatment difference (TAK -062 – placebo) in the mean change from baseline  to 
Week 12 in weekly  CDSD GI symptom severity score, for each dose level.  
The primary endpoint will be analyzed with a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) approach using the 
appropriate contrast at Week 12. The model will be based on all available week ly CDSD  GI symptom severity 
scores from Week -[ADDRESS_131034] errors. If the 
model does not converge, additional covariance structure will be used with the order specified in the statistical 
analysis plan (SAP). Two -sided tests c omparing each of the TAK -062 dose groups with placebo at Week 12 will 
be conducted. The corresponding p -values, LS means of treatment differences and 2 -sided 95% CI will be 
reported. The MMRM assumes data is missing at random. Sensitivity analysis will be performed with an 
alternative assumption that data is missing not at random. Supplementary analyses will be performed for the 
overall CDSD symptom severity score using the same approach as in the primary analysis.  
Secondary Efficacy Analysis : The secondary  efficacy analysis will be based on FAS -SIGE. The estimand 
framework corresponding to each secondary efficacy analysis has the same attributes in population, treatments, 
and ICEs as for the primary estimand. The variable/endpoint attributes for the seconda ry analysis are:  
• Change in Vh:Cd from baseline (measured at Week -4) to Week 24.  
The corresponding population -level summaries are:  
• Treatment difference (TAK -062 – placebo) in the mean change from baseline (measured at Week -4) to 
Week 24 in Vh:Cd for each dose level.  
The analysis will be conducted using analysis of covariance. The model will include treatment group and the 
randomization stratification factors as fixed effects and baseline values as covariate. Missing values will be 
regarded as missing at ra ndom. Missing data will be handled using multiple imputation (details will be provided 
in the SAP). The LS means and 2 -sided 95% CI will be provided for the Week 24 treatment difference between 
the  TAK -062 dose groups versus placebo, r espectively. Nominal 2 -sided p -values will be 
provided for the comparison of  TAK -062 versus placebo,  TAK -062 versus placebo, and  
TAK -062 versus placebo, respectively.  
The placebo group includes all subjects randomized to receive placeb o  and gluten -containing SIGE bar  
in Cohorts 1 and 2  in all analyses  unless specifi ed otherwise . 
Multiplicity Control : To control the overall Type I error rate for the primary efficacy endpoint, a fixed -sequence 
testing procedure will be used for th e comparison of 3 doses of TAK -062 versus placebo. Specifically, the 
primary endpoint tested will be conducted in the following order:

Sample Size Justification:  
The planned sample size is approximately [ADDRESS_131036] size. A sample size of 53 subjects per treatment group will 
provide 80% power to detect a standardize d mean difference (mean difference/SD) of 0.55 between  
TAK -062 and placebo in the change from baseline in weekly  CDSD GI symptom severity score (assuming a 
common SD) for a [ADDRESS_131037] and a 5% signif icance level. 
Assuming a dropout rate of approximately 12%, a sample size of 60 subjects per treatment group for the  
and placebo arms in the gluten -containing SIGE group (Cohort 1) will be the planned enrollment.  
The planned enrollment for Cohort 2  is 30 and 50 subjects per treatment arm in the placebo  and active (  
 TAK -062) respectively , in the gluten -containing SIGE arms ; 50 subjects  (43 adults  and 7 adolescents ) 
per arm in the  and placebo gluten -free SIGE bar arms ; and 7  subje cts (adolescents only) in the  
gluten -free SIGE bar arm.  The analysis to detect the difference between the combined placebo  gluten -containing

CONFIDENTIAL  4.0 INTRODUCTION  
4.1 Background  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_117475] a gluten -free diet (GFD), many individuals with celiac disease 
(CeD) continue to have symptoms and/or intestinal damage due to gluten exposure. TAK -062 is 
a computationally designed enzyme intended to reduce or preve nt symptoms and intestinal 
damage related to gluten exposure (Pultz et al. 2021 ). TAK -[ADDRESS_131041] to a GFD for the treatment of moderate to severe symptomatic CeD in  patients with 
inadequate response to dietary modifications and signs of small intestine mucosal injury. The 
primary goal of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of TAK -062 for treatment of 
symptoms and intestinal damage related to inadvertent g luten exposure in subjects with CeD. To 
robustly assess protection from real -world gluten exposure, the study will use food bars 
containing a small amount of gluten, referred to as simulated inadvertent gluten exposure 
(SIGE).  
The study will have 2 cohort s; in Cohort 1, safety and efficacy of TAK -[ADDRESS_131042] dose ( ) in the presence of SIGE; in Cohort 2, safety and 
efficacy of TAK -062 will be evaluated at 3 doses ( ) in adults with gluten -
containing and gluten -free SIGE and at 2 doses ( ) in adolescent subjects with 
gluten -free SIGE. The interim analysis (IA) will be initiated when at least 75% of the subjects in 
Cohort [ADDRESS_131043] dropp ed out, to determine 
inclusion of adolescents in Cohort 2. Cohort 1 data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_117522] (IDMC) and shared  with health authorities and independent ethics 
committees (IECs)/institutional review boards (I RBs) as required by [CONTACT_11338], before enrollment of 
adolescents in Cohort 2. If efficacy and safety data from Cohort 1 is considered acceptable, 
Cohort 2 will also include adolescents aged 12 to 17  years, inclusive. Adolescents will receive 
only gluten -free S IGE bars.  
In addition, this study has 3 other important goals:  
1. Evaluation of the psychometric properties of the Celiac Disease Symptom Diary  (CDSD)  
Version ( v)2.1. The CDSD has been developed specifically for CeD . This study will include 
additional patient -reported outcomes (PROs) such as the Patient Global Impression of 
Severity (PGIS), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), and Celiac Disease 
Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (CeD -GSRS) to facilitate psy chometric evaluation of 
the CDSD, which may enable the CDSD to be used as a primary endpoint in future studies. 
Results from CDSD psychometric assessment will be reported in a separate psychometric 
report.  
2. To provide data on the optimal histologic measure for assessment of response to treatment in 
CeD. While there is consensus that assessment of change in small intestinal mucosal injury 
and intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_117479] (IEL) infiltration is important in studies of CeD treatment, the 
optimal histologic endpoin t for use in clinical studies is unclear. This study will assess the 
utility of quantitative and qualitative histologic endpoints (eg, IEL counts, villous height

4.1.1 Disease State Background  
CeD is a mult isystem autoimmune disease triggered by [CONTACT_117523] (Ludvigsson et al. 2013 ). Deamidated gluten peptides can bind with high 
affinity to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -DQ2/DQ8 on antigen -presenting cells, which elicits 
T cell-driven cytotoxic and antibody -mediated immune responses. Intestinal injury is 
predominantly cell -mediated and characterized by [CONTACT_52367], crypt hyperplasia, and 
infiltration of lymphoid cells into both the epi[INVESTIGATOR_117480]. CeD is one of the most 
common immune -mediated gastrointestinal (GI) diseases and can affect individuals at any age, 
although most diagnoses occur in late adolescence and early adulthood.  
Currently, there are no approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] f or CeD and the only option for patients is a GFD that 
involves strict lifelong avoidance of exposure to >[ADDRESS_131044] for Foods for Special Dietary Use for Persons 
Intolerant to G luten (Codex Alimentarius 2015 ). The  threshold of daily gluten that will cause 
mucosal injury in both adults and children is thought to be 10 to 50 mg/day, or about one -
hundredth of a slice of bread (Catassi et al. 2007 ; Gibert et al. 2013 ). However, there are reports 
of patients where even a single milligram of gluten, an amount impossible to avoid in daily life, 
can prevent adequate clinical disease control (Biagi et al. 2004 ). 
The majority of patients report f requent  symptoms related to gluten exposure despi[INVESTIGATOR_117481] (Hall et al. 2013 ). More than 70% of patients with CeD are not satisfied with 
the GFD due to the combination of ongoing symptoms and/or high burden of maintenance of 
lifelong strict dietary restriction (Barratt et al. 2011 ).  
Disease control attained with the GFD has traditionally been grouped into [ADDRESS_131045] 
category is responsive disease whereby [CONTACT_117524] a nd represents 70% of the 
CeD population. The majority of the remaining 30% of the CeD population fall into the second 
category and have what is known as persistently active CeD, which is defined by [CONTACT_117525]/or small intestine mucosal injury des pi[INVESTIGATOR_117482] (Leonard et al. 
2017 ). The most common reason for persistently active CeD is inadvertent gluten exposure. It is 
these patients, with ongoing symptoms and intestinal damage felt to be related to gluten 
exposure, who are the intended subjects in this study. Less than 1% of patients have refractory

characteristics and no safety concerns to date. This study will be the first phase [ADDRESS_131047] shown no TAK -062–related toxicity up to the highest 
evaluated dose of 2000 mg/kg/day (limit dose) in both rats (up to 6 months) and monkeys (up to 
13 weeks), and no effects on embryofetal development in the rat or rabbit (see IB for further 
detail). Based on the human equivalent dose the no -observed -adverse -effect level (NOAEL) of 
1000 mg/kg administered orally twice per day (2000 mg/kg/day) in the 6 month general toxicity 
study in the rat and the 13 -week general toxicity studies in the cynomolgus monkey, this 
provides a margin of 10.8 and 21.5 relative to the proposed high dose of  
 in humans, respectively.  
Antidrug antibodies (ADAs) were seen in nonclinical studies but are not considered predictive 
for the development of ADAs in humans. Clinical ADAs were nonneutralizing, not associate d 
with adverse event (AE), and had no measurable impact on gluten degradation. Development of 
ADA to TAK -062 liquid and capsule formulations was evaluated in Parts 1 and 2, and 
development of ADA to TAK -062 tablet formulation was evaluated in Parts 3 and 4  of the 
phase  1 clinical study (PvP -102-01). 
Currently, there are no important identified or important potential risks associated with TAK -062 
treatment based on the evidence from phase 1 clinical studies and nonclinical toxicology studies. 
However, ADA is  considered a potential risk with the administration of TAK -062 based on 
limited data in the phase 1 clinical trial, and this will be monitored in this study and future 
studies. Cohort 1 data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_117526]/IRBs as required by [CONTACT_11338], before enrollment of adolescents. If efficacy and safety 
data from Cohort 1 is considered acceptable, Cohort 2 also will include adolescents aged 12 to 
17 years, inclusive. Adolescent subjects will be randomized  into the gluten -free SIGE groups 
only.

CONFIDENTIAL  Potential risks are based on symptoms related to gluten exposure and testing related to study 
endpoints. These include the following:  
• Phlebotomy: There is minimal risk associated with phlebotomy (limited to <500  mL) in 
otherwise healthy adults.  
• Endoscopy with duodenal biopsy: endoscopy with duodenal biopsy is a common GI 
procedure. Risks include those related to procedural sedation, the endoscopic procedure, and 
the biopsies. Cumulatively, the risks of upper endoscop y are estimated to be <0.5% (Levy 
and Gralnek 2016 ). Clinical evaluation of subjects before endoscopy will be completed 
according to established site protocols.  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
In summary, there have been no safety signals and no important identified or important potential 
risks associated with TAK -062 treatment based on the data from phase 1 clini cal studies and 
toxicology studies to date.  
• The development of ADA is a potential risk.  
• There has been 1 unrelated serious adverse event (SAE) reported across the clinical program 
to date.  
• There was no evidence of systemic exposure to TAK -062 liquid and ca psule formulations 
after treatment with any dose administered in phase 1 studies.  
• There are no AE designated as AEs of special interest for TAK -062.  
• AEs and SAEs will continue to be routinely monitored in ongoing studies and future studies.  
Overall, the phase 1 and nonclinical study results are not suggestive of any safety risks related to 
TAK -062 for the ongoing development program; the benefit -risk profile is, therefore, considered 
appropriate to support the continuation of the clinical development prog ram for TAK -062 for 
CeD indication as planned.

CONFIDENTIAL  6.2 Justification for Study Design, Dose, and Endpoints  
6.2.1 Rationale for Study Design

improvement in symptoms as measured by [CONTACT_117533] -062 compare d with placebo 
(Leffler et al. 2015 ; Murray et al. 2017 ). This study will e nroll subjects who have been

and NOAEL of 2000  mg/kg/day. Calculation of the human equivalent dose applied to the 
observed NOAEL of 2000  mg/kg/day after a [ADDRESS_131059] 30 minutes. In the phase  1 study, 
the gluten degradation activity of TAK -062 was assessed in healthy subjects receiving placebo 
and  of liquid formulation before 1 g of gluten; or placebo and  of liquid 
formulation before [ADDRESS_131060],  
 
. TAK -062 works only on gluten, so it is essential 
that gluten be consumed to assess therapeutic efficacy. In prior CeD studies that did not include 
SIGE, significant i mprovements in symptoms and/or histology were observed in the placebo 
arms (Leffler et al. 2015 ; Murray et al. 2017 ). This effect has been attributed, at least in part, to 
reduction in gluten exposure as a result of trial participation (Stefanolo et al. 2020 ). Second, if a 
positive therapeutic effect is observed, then the inclusion of SIGE,  
 provides confidence that the effect seen 
in the study will confer real benefit to patients outside of a study where gluten exposures are 
known to be highly variable.  
Subjects will consume  with a meal for the duration of the study

The adolescent group in Cohort 2 will not be exposed to SIGE because this group will be

6.2.3 Rationale for Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Efficacy  
The goal of TAK -[ADDRESS_131062] understanding  of the dose of TAK -062 necessary 
to improve ongoing symptoms and intestinal pathology related to active CeD.  
The primary endpoint will be reduction in mean weekly  CDSD score in TAK -062 treatment 
group versus placebo. Because ongoing active CeD is experien ced by [CONTACT_117534], 
symptom improvement is an appropriate basis of establishing effectiveness of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_117484] a GFD.  
The CDSD measures GI symptoms on a daily basis and was developed in accordance with Food 
and Drug Administrati on (FDA) guidance on PRO measures (Patrick et al. 2007 ). This measure 
allows for sensitive measurement of epi[INVESTIGATOR_117485]; however, the CDSD is not 
yet validated  for the in tended context of use . To assess the psychometric properties of the C DSD, 
anchors (PGIS and PGIC) will be used to assess the meaningful within -patient change. 
Additional measures of celiac -related symptoms will also be assessed (eg, CeD -GSRS and 
PROMIS —Fatigue Instrument) to measure convergent validity.

CONFIDENTIAL  [IP_ADDRESS]  Tissue -Based Biomark ers: Vh:Cd and IELs  
As a complement to understanding how subjects are feeling during the study, a secondary 
endpoint of this study will be the change in Vh:Cd ratio on duodenal biopsy from baseline 
(Week -4) to the end of treatment. The Vh:Cd ratio repres ents mucosal architectural changes and 
a lower Vh:Cd ratio indicates more severe intestinal injury characterized by a flattening of the 
mucosa. Changes in the individual Vh and Cd measurements will also be evaluated as 
exploratory endpoints. Because ongoin g small intestinal mucosal injury is a major risk factor for 
long-term complications, showing improvement in tissue histology is necessary for establishing 
effectiveness of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_117486] a GFD. Additionally, increases in IELs are often 
monitored as a marker of inflammation in the duodenal epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]. The ability of TAK -[ADDRESS_131063] these histological markers will be important endpoints monitored in this study.  
Other Exploratory Biomarkers  
Exploratory analysis of intestinal gene expressi on (RNA) and tissue microbiome community 
may also be done but will not be a part of the clinical study report. Predose plasma and serum 
samples are also being collected to enable evaluation of novel circulating biomarkers under 
investigation and how they r espond to treatment. These include microbial identification, 
exosome quantification, proteomic analysis, and quantitation of markers of extracellular matrix 
remodeling. These collections may be useful for noninvasive patient selection or disease 
monitoring .  
[IP_ADDRESS]   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Urine -Based Biomarker: GIP  
As a means of monitoring gluten exposure during the study, urine samples will be collected in 
standard urine collection cups once per week for evaluatio n of GIP using a qualitative assay. To 
enable quantitative detection of different gluten peptides, subjects will collect urine in  
 on the day of a 
clinic visit and take the sample  to the site.  
 
 
 While all efforts should be made to obtain weekly urine 
samples, missed urine GIP samples will not be considered a protocol deviation.

regarding the gluten degrading capability of TAK -062.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety  
Safety will be monitored on the basis of the occurrence of TEAEs, SAEs, physical examination 
findings (in the context of AEs), vital signs (hea rt rate, blood pressure, temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_11943]), ECGs, and clinical laboratory parameters (chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis). A serum 
pregnancy test will be conducted at screening and urine pregnancy tests at all other scheduled 
visits before receiving study drugs for women of childbearing potential (WOCBP). All TEAEs, 
including clinically significant treatment -emergent laboratory abnormalities, will be graded 
according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  
(CTCAE) v5.0. 
6.3 Premature Termination or Suspension of Study or Study Site  
6.3.1 Criteria for Premature Termination or Suspension of the Study  
The study will be completed as planned unless 1 or more of the following criteria are satisfied 
that require temporary suspension or early termination of the study.  
• New information or other evaluation regarding the safety or efficacy of TAK -062 that 
indicates a change in the currently known benefit -risk profile such that the benefit -risk 
balance is no longer acceptable for  subjects participating in the study.  
• Significant violation of GCP that compromises the ability to achieve the primary study 
objectives or compromises subject safety.  
6.3.2 Criteria for Premature Termination or Suspension of Study Sites  
A study site may be termi nated prematurely or suspended if the site (including the investigator) 
is found in significant violation of GCP, protocol, or contractual agreement, is unable to ensure 
adequate performance of the study, or as otherwise permitted by [CONTACT_117535]. 
6.3.3 Procedures for Premature Termination or Suspension of the Study or the 
Participation of Study Site(s)  
The sponsor may suspend or terminate the study, or part of the study, at any time for any reason. 
If the study is suspended or terminated, the sponso r will ensure that applicable sites, regulatory 
agencies and IRBs/IECs are notified as appropriate.

a Adolescent subjects will be randomized to Groups 4, 5, and [ADDRESS_131093]’s assigned dose according to the study protoc ol. 
All cases of overdose (with or without associated AEs) will be documented in the dosing section 
of the eCRF, to capture this important safety information consistently in the database. Cases of 
overdose without manifested signs or symptoms are considere d as AEs and should be captured 
with the appropriate Preferred Term of overdose in the AE eCRF. Additionally, AEs associated 
with an overdose will be documented on AE eCRF(s) according to  Section 10.0. 
SAEs associated with overdose should be reported according to the procedure outlined in 
Section  10.2.[ADDRESS_131094] meets all entry criteria, the investigator or the investigator’s designee

accordance with the protocol and is dispensed only to subjects enrol led in the study. To 
document appropriate use of sponsor -supplied drug/SIGE bar, the investigator or designee must 
maintain records of all sponsor -supplied drug/SIGE bar delivery to the site, site inventory, 
dispensation and use by [CONTACT_6992], and return  to the sponsor or designee.  
Upon receipt of sponsor -supplied drug/SIGE bar, the investigator or designee must verify the 
contents of the shipments against the packing list. The verifier should ensure that the quantity is 
correct, and the medication is in good condition. If quantity and conditions are acceptable, 
investigator or designee should acknowledge the receipt of the shipment by [CONTACT_117540]. If 
there are any discrepancies between the packing list versus the actual product received, [COMPANY_005] 
must be contact[CONTACT_45320]. The packing list should be filed in the investigator’s 
essential document file.  
The investigator or designee must maintain 100% accountability for all sponsor -supplied 
drugs/SIGE bar received and dispensed during his or h er entire participation in the study. Proper 
drug/SIGE bar accountability includes, but is not limited to:  
• Frequently verifying that actual inventory matches documented inventory.  
• Verifying that the log is completed for the medication ID dispensed.  
• Verifyi ng that all containers used are documented accurately on the log.  
• Verifying that required fields are completed accurately and legibly.

moderate, severe, very severe). For validation purposes, it will be performed at Weeks -8 and -7. 
The PGIS will also be conducted on the day of every visit.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  PGIC  
The CeD PGIC is a 1 -question instrument that evaluates the change from study start to the 
present time. Response options are measured using a 7 -point Likert -type scale (very much worse, 
much worse, a little worse, no change, a little improved, much improved, very much improved).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  CeD Most Bothersome Symptom  
The CeD Most Bothersome Symptom is a [ADDRESS_131104]’s 
perception of which symptoms from those evaluated in the CDSD that the subject considers most 
bothersome.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  PROMIS —Fatigue Instrument  
PROMIS is a set of person -centered measures that evaluates and monitors physical, mental, and 
social health in adults and children. The PROMIS Item Bank v1.0 —Fatigue —Short Form 13a 
(2019b ) is a battery of 13  questions for adults aged 18 years or older, which are included in the 
FACIT -Fatigue. Th is instrument assesses a range of self -reported symptoms, from mild 
subjective feelings of tiredness to an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained sense of 
exhaustion that likely decreases one’s ability to execute daily activities and function normally i n 
family or social roles. Fatigue is divided into the experience of fatigue (frequency, duration, and 
intensity) and the impact of fatigue on physical, mental, and social activities. This instrument has 
a 7-day recall period, and responses are measured usi ng a 5 -point scale (not at all, a little, 
somewhat, quite a bit, very much). For subjects aged 12 to 17 years, the PROMIS Pediatric Item 
Bank v2.0 —Fatigue —Short Form 10a: Pediatric Fatigue will be used. This instrument has 
10 questions with a 7 -day recall that are measured using a 5 -point scale (never, almost never, 
sometimes, often, almost always).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  CeD-GSRS  
The GSRS is a nondisease -specific 15 -item instrument measuring the discomfort of GI 
symptoms using a modified Likert scale (no discomfort at all, minor  discomfort, mild 
discomfort, moderate discomfort, moderately severe discomfort, severe discomfort, very severe 
discomfort) (Revicki et al. 1998 ). In this study, the 1 0 items relevant to CeD (CeD -GSRS) will

PROMIS is a set of person -centered measures that evaluates and monitors physical, mental, and 
social health in adults and children. The PROMIS Short Form v2.0 —Cognitive Function 6a 
(2019a ) is a subset of [ADDRESS_131105] of 
cognitive dysfunction on quality of life are also  assessed. This instrument has a 7 -day recall 
period, and responses are measured using a 5 -point frequency scale (never, rarely, sometimes, 
often, very often). For subjects aged 12 to 17 years, a modified version of the PROMIS Pediatric 
Short Form v1.0 —Cognitive Function 7a: Pediatric Cognitive Function will be used. This 
instrument has 7 items on a 5 -point response scale (none of the time, a little of the time, some of 
the time, most of the time, all of the time). The original version has a 4 -week recall t hat has been 
modified to 7 days.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  WPAI+CIQ:CeD

classes. The recall period is the previous 7 days.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SF-12 v2  
The SF -12 v2 is a self -administered, validated questionnaire designed to measure generic 
HRQOL (Ware et al. 2001 ). This 12 -item questionnaire measures 8 domains, including: Physical 
Functioning, Role -physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, 
Role -emotional, and Mental Health. Two summary scores can be ca lculated, the Physical 
Component Score, and the Mental Component Score. Higher scores indicate better health status.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  ICDSQ  
The ICDSQ is a [ADDRESS_131107] 7 days. Responses are measured 
using a 5 -point Likert -type scale (not at all, a little, moderately, very much, completely).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  CDAQ  
The CDAQ (Crocker et al. 2018 ) is a validated PRO measure developed to investigate t he 
HRQOL of people living with CeD with a recall period of 4  weeks. This 32 -item questionnaire 
measures 5 domains: stigma, dietary burden, symptoms, social isolation, and worries and 
concerns. Responses are measured using a 5 -point Likert -type scale (never , rarely, sometimes,

9.3.7 Placebo Reduction Plan  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Accurate Symptom Reporting Training  
The Accurate Symptom Reporting training is an electronic learning module designed to orient 
subjects to core study questionnaires and to provide guidance on how to report symptoms 
accurately and reliably. The goal of this training is to improve the accuracy of PRO data. Once 
training is available, subjects may receive training at Visits 1, 2, and 3, as well as at Weeks 6, 10, 
16, and 22. Additional training may be performed on an as  needed basis.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Placebo Response Reduction Training  
The placebo response reduction training teaches the subject about the appropriate expectations of 
personal benefit while participating in a clinical trial. The purpose is to provide subjects with 
truthful information that will neutralize the typi[INVESTIGATOR_117490]. Once training is available, subjects may receive training at 
Visits 1, 2, and 3, as well as at Weeks 6, 10, 16, and 22. Additional training may be performed 
on an as needed basis.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Participant Scorecard  
The Participant Scorecard presents subjects with data reflecting their own performance on key 
tasks in the study, plus automated and customized tips for how to improve their performance . 
Scores are assigned for eDiary compliance, study medication adherence, and SIGE bar 
adherence, providing subjects with the opportunity to make changes to improve their 
performance on these tasks if needed. The Scorecard was designed to be viewed without any 
required human intervention in order to improve efficiency and timeliness of recommendations 
and decrease biases and burdens introduced by [CONTACT_117546].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Research Subject Responsibilities Training  
The Research Subject Respons ibilities training is an electronic learning module designed to 
provide a detailed overview of the key study procedures (eg, dosing, SIGE bar, diary 
completion) to the subjects. Once training is available, subjects will receive training at Visits 1, 
2, and  3, as well as at Weeks 6, 10, 16, and 22. Additional training may be performed on an as 
needed basis.

sigmoidoscopy with biopsy may be performed  (at the discretion of the investigator) to rule out 
microscop ic colitis in subjects who qualify for study inclusion based on diarrhea severity and 
who have not had previous sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy with biopsies providing evidence of 
lack of microscopic colitis. The upper GI endoscopy will be performed at Week -4 (Visit 2) and 
at Week  24 (Visit 6) or early termination. All possibly significant macroscopic abnormalities in 
the esophagus, stomach, duodenal bulb, and descending duodenum will be documented in the 
eCRF. A minimum of 6 and up to 8 small bowel biopsy sp ecimens will be taken from separate 
folds/circumferential areas of the distal (postbulbar, D2/D3) duodenum. Samples will be 
collected and placed into formalin for Vh:Cd, IEL, and other exploratory analyses or snap frozen 
and potentially used for microbiome  or other exploratory analyses related to GI immunology. 
Hematoxylin and eosin stained slides from small bowel biopsy specimens will be used to 
perform quantitative and qualitative morphometric analysis, which includes measurement of Vh

9.3.13  Contraception and Pregnancy Avoidance Procedure  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Male Subjects and Thei r Female Partners  
From the time of signing of informed consent/pediatric assent forms, throughout the duration of 
the study, and for [ADDRESS_131114] dose of study drug, nonsterilized** male subjects who are 
sexually active with a female partner of chil dbearing potential* must use an effective 
contraception in combination with their female partner using an effective method of 
contraception, as below. In addition, they must be advised not to donate sperm during this 
period. WOCBP who are partners of male subjects are also advised to use additional 
contraception as shown in the list containing effective contraception below.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Female Subjects and Their Male Partners  
From the time of signing of informed consent/pediatric assent forms, throughout the duration of  
the study, and for [ADDRESS_131115] dose of study drug, WOCBP* who are sexually active with a 
nonsterilized male partner** must use an effective method of contraception from the list below.  
In addition they must be advised not to donate ova during this  period.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definitions and Procedures for Contraception and Pregnancy Avoidance  
The following definitions apply for contraception and pregnancy avoidance procedures.  
*A woman is considered a WOCBP, that is, fertile, following menarche and until becoming 
postmenopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include 
hysterectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 
12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level 
in the postmenopausal range (FSH >40 IU/L) may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in 
younger women (eg, those aged <45 years) or women who are not using hormonal contraception 
or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 1 2 months of amenorrhea, a single 
FSH measurement is insufficient.  
** Sterilized men should be at least [ADDRESS_131116] had bilateral 
orchidectomy.  
Highly effective contraceptive methods are defined as <1% failure rate per year when used 
consistently and correctly. Effective contraceptive methods are defined as >1% failure rate per 
year when used consistently and correctly. In this study, the minimum required level of 
contraception is effective contraception. Table 9.b lists both highly effective and effective 
methods of contraception.

to sign a consent form stating that they understand the requirements for avoidance of pregnancy, 
donation of ova and sperm donation during the course of the study. Duri ng the course of the 
study, regular urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) pregnancy tests will be performed  
only for WOCBP and all subjects (male and female) will receive continued guidance with 
respect to the avoidance of pregnancy and sperm donation a s part of the study procedures. Such 
guidance should include a reminder of the following:  
• Contraceptive requirements of the study.  
• Reasons for use of barrier methods (ie, condom) in males with pregnant partners.  
• Assessment of subject compliance through questions such as  
– Have you used the contraception consistently and correctly since the last visit?  
– Have you forgotten to use contraception since the last visit?   
– Is there a chance you could be pregnant ?

subjects missing their visits.  
Optional flexible measures include the following:  
• Informed consent/pediatric assent forms procedure: If necessary, informed consent/ped iatric 
assent from a potential or current study subject may be obtained via electronic informed 
consent/pediatric assent capabilities, or an electronic face -to-face consent interview when 
these individuals are unable to travel to the site, based on local r egulations or requirements.  
• Clinical laboratory samples: Blood draws may be conducted at home by [CONTACT_117555] a local laboratory (or relevant clinical or office facility) authorized/certified to 
perform such tests routinely.  
• ECG procedures: ECGs may be performed during a home health care visit by a qualified 
health care professional who is authorized/certified to perform such tests routinely.  
• Vital signs: Vital sign measurements may be performed during a home health care visit by a 
qualified health care professional who is authorized/certified to perform such tests routinely.  
• Physical examination: Examinations may be conducted as a nurse assessment or via 
telehealth visit, per investigator’s discretion, during home health care visi ts, if applicable, and 
according to local regulations/requirements.

TAK -[ADDRESS_131128] finding generally may:  
• Indicate a new diagnosis or unexpected worsening of a pre -existing condition. (Intermittent 
events for pre -existing conditions or underlying disease should not be considered PTEs or 
AEs.)  
• Necessitate therapeutic intervention.  
• Require an invasive diagnostic procedure.  
• Require discontinuation or a change in dose of study drug or a concomitant medication.  
• Be consi dered unfavorable by [CONTACT_109307].  
• PTEs/AEs caused by a study procedure (eg, a bruise after blood draw) should be recorded as 
a PTE/AE.  
Diagnoses versus signs and symptoms:  
• Each event should be recorded to represent a single diagnosis. A ccompanying signs 
(including abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be 
recorded as additional AEs. If a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be 
recorded appropriately as a PTE(s) or as an AE(s).  
Laboratory values a nd ECG findings:  
• Changes in laboratory values or ECG findings  are only considered to be PTEs or AEs if they 
are judged to be clinically significant (ie, if some action or intervention is required or if the 
investigator judges the change to be beyond the ra nge of normal physiologic fluctuation). A 
laboratory or ECG re -test and/or continued monitoring of an abnormal value or finding are 
not considered an intervention. In addition, repeated or additional noninvasive testing for 
verification, evaluation or moni toring of an abnormality is not considered an intervention.  
• If abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings are the result of pathology for which there is 
an overall diagnosis (eg, increased creatinine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be 
reported  appropriately as a PTE or as an AE.  
Pre-existing conditions:  
• Pre-existing conditions (present at the time of signing of informed consent/pediatric assent 
forms) are considered concurrent medical conditions and should NOT be recorded as PTEs 
or AEs. Baseli ne evaluations (eg, laboratory tests, ECG, x -rays) should NOT be recorded as 
PTEs unless related to study procedures. However, if the subject experiences a worsening or 
complication of such a concurrent medical condition, the worsening or complication shou ld 
be recorded appropriately as a PTE (worsening or complication occurs before start of study 
drug) or an AE (worsening or complication occurs after start of study drug). Investigators 
should ensure that the event term recorded captures the change in the c ondition (eg, 
“worsening of…”).

any occurrence of an epi[INVESTIGATOR_45284] a PTE/AE if the condition becomes 
more frequent, serious or severe in natur e. Investigators should ensure that the AE term 
recorded captures the change in the condition from baseline (eg “worsening of…”).  
• If a subject has a degenerative concurrent medical condition (eg, cataracts, rheumatoid 
arthritis), worsening of the condition  should only be recorded as a PTE/AE if occurring to a 
greater extent to that which would be expected. Investigators should ensure that the AE term 
recorded captures the change in the condition (eg, “worsening of…”).  
Worsening of PTEs or AEs:  
• If the subjec t experiences a worsening or complication of a PTE after the start of study drug, 
the worsening or complication should be recorded as an AE. Investigators should ensure that 
the AE term recorded captures the change in the PTE (eg, “worsening of…”).  
• If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of an AE after any change in study 
drug, the worsening or complication should be recorded as a new AE. Investigators should 
ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condition (eg, “worsenin g 
of…”).  
Changes in intensity of AEs/serious PTEs:  
• If the subject experiences changes in intensity of an AE/serious PTE, the event should be 
captured once with the maximum intensity recorded.  
AEs related to gluten exposure  
• AEs related to gluten may be anti cipated to include signs and/or symptoms of CeD, including 
GI symptoms and extraintestinal manifestations such as skin rash, headache, fatigue 
neurological/neurocognitive manifestations, elevation in liver enzymes and bilirubin, and 
joint pain. Symptoms co llected through the CDSD, including diarrhea, bowel movement 
frequency, abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, and fatigue that occur with gluten exposure, 
should not be reported as AEs unless these events require intervention such as rescue 
medication use (see  Section 7.4) and/or become SAEs. If severe symptoms require use of 
rescue medications, each epi[INVESTIGATOR_117494] . 
Preplanned procedures (surgeries or interventions):  
• Preplanned procedures (surgeries or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) that were scheduled before signing of 
informed consent/pediatric assent forms are not considered PTEs or AEs. However, if a 
preplanned procedure is perform ed early ie, after subject has started study drug (eg, as an 
emergency) due to a worsening of the pre -existing condition, the worsening of the condition 
should be recorded as a PTE or an AE. Complications resulting from any planned surgery 
should be report ed as AEs if these events occur after subject has commenced study drug.

CONFIDENTIAL  Elective surgeries or procedures:  
• Elective procedures performed during the study where there is no change in the subject’s 
medical condition should not be recorded as PTEs or AEs, but should be documented in the 
subject’s source documents. Complications resulting from an elective surgery should be 
reported as AEs.  
Insufficient clinical response (lack of efficacy):  
• Insufficient clinical response, efficacy, or pharmacologic action, should  NOT be recorded as 
an AE. The investigator must make the distinction between exacerbation of pre -existing 
illness and lack of therapeutic efficacy.  
Overdose:  
• All cases of overdose (with or without associated AEs) will be documented in the dosing 
section o f the eCRF. Additionally, overdose should be captured as an AE in the eCRF with or 
without any additional AEs.  
An overdose will be considered as a dose above the maximum recommended dose that is 
being used in this study irrespective of the assigned study a rm of the subject that overdosed. 
Any administered dose above that assigned to the subject that is less than the maximum dose 
being studied will be considered as a medication dosing error, and not an overdose.  
 endoscopy procedure related AEs:  
• Any i ncidental safety findings from local reading of the  or during the 
baseline endoscopy procedure may be considered as a PTE for the study; however, before 
this is captured as PTE, the site must consult with sponsor’s study physician as th e decisions 
will be made on a case by [CONTACT_413].  
• These incidental safety findings will be tracked in subsequent /endoscopy visits and any 
changes observed from baseline findings may be captured as TEAEs after discussing with 
sponsor’s study physician.  
10.1.[ADDRESS_131129] medical occurrence that at any dose:  
1. Results in DEATH.  
2. Is LIFE THREATENING.  
• The term “life threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an e vent that hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe.  
3. Requires inpatient HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_117495].

• May require intervention to prevent items 1 through 5 above.  
• May expose the subject to danger, even though the event is not immediately life 
threatening or fatal or does not result in hosp italization.  
PTEs that fulfill 1 or more of the serious criteria above are also to be considered SAEs and 
should be reported and followed up in the same manner (see Sections 10.2.2  and 10.3). 
10.1.[ADDRESS_131130] for TAK -062. 
10.1.6  Intensity of PTEs and AEs  
The different categories of intensity (severity) are characterized as follows:  
Mild: The event is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].  
Moderate:  The event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject’s usual activities.  
Severe:  The event  causes considerable interference with the subject’s usual activities.  
Liver AEs will be characterized per FDA guidelines ( Appendix F).  
10.1.7  Causality of AE s 
The relationship of each AE to study drug(s) will be assessed using the following categories:  
Related:  An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug (including 
the course after withdrawal of the drug), or for which possi ble involvement of the drug cannot 
be ruled out , although factors other than the drug, such as underlying diseases, complications, 
concomitant medications and concurrent treatments, may also be responsible.  
Not Related:  An AE that does not follow a reason able temporal sequence from administration of a drug 
and/or that can reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_1604], such as underlying diseases, 
complications, concomitant medications and concurrent treatments.  
10.1.8  Relationship to Study Procedures  
Relationship (ca usality) to study procedures should be determined for all PTEs and AEs. 
Relationship to SIGE will be assessed and recorded separately from other study procedures.  
The relationship should be assessed as related if the investigator considers that there is 
reasonable possibility that an AE is due to a study procedure. Otherwise, the relationship should 
be assessed as not related.  
10.1.9  Start Date  
The start date of the AE/PT E is the date that the first signs/symptoms were noted by [CONTACT_14426]/or investigator.

CONFIDENTIAL  10.1.10  Stop Date  
The stop date of the AE/PTE is the date on which the subject recovered, the AE resolved but 
with sequelae or the subject died.  
10.1.11  Pattern  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_11742]/PTE (e g, vomiting) or those which occur repeatedly over a period of consecutive 
days are intermittent. Other events occur once or are continuous.  
10.1.12  Action Concerning Study Drug  
• Drug withdrawn: a study drug is stopped due to the particular AE.  
• Dose not changed: the particular AE did not require any dose modification and/or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a 
study drug.  
• Unknown: only to be used if it has not been possible to determine what action has been 
taken.  
• Not applicable: a study drug was stopped for a reason other than the particu lar AE eg, the 
study has been terminated, the subject died, dosing with study drug was already stopped 
before the onset of the AE.  
• Dose interrupted: the dose schedule was interrupted due to the particular AE.  
10.1.13  Outcome  
• Recovered/resolved: Subject returned to  baseline assessment status with respect to the 
AE/PTE.  
• Recovering/resolving the intensity is lowered by 1 or more grades: the diagnosis or 
signs/symptoms has almost disappeared; the abnormal laboratory value improved, but has not 
returned to the normal ra nge or to baseline; the subject died from another cause with the 
particular AE/PTE state remaining “recovering/resolving”.  
• Not recovered/not resolved: there is no change in the diagnosis, signs or symptoms; the 
intensity of the diagnosis, signs/ symptoms o r laboratory value on the last day of the 
observed study period has gotten worse than when it started; is an irreversible congenital 
anomaly; the subject died from another cause with the particular AE/PTE state remaining 
“Not recovered/not resolved”.  
• Resol ved with sequelae: the subject recovered from an acute AE/PTE but was left with 
permanent/significant impairment (eg, recovered from a cardiovascular accident but with 
some persisting paresis).  
• Fatal: the AEs/PTEs which are considered as the cause of death .  
• Unknown: the course of the AE/PTE cannot be followed up due to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1670]’s participation in the study.

CONFIDENTIAL  10.2 Procedures  
10.2.1  Collection and Reporting of AEs  
[IP_ADDRESS]  PTE and AE Collection Period  
Collection of PTEs will commence from the time the subject signs the informed 
consent/pediatric assent forms to participate in the study and continue until just before the 
subject is first administered study drug (Visit  3) or until screen failure. For subjects who 
discontinue bef ore study drug administration, PTEs are collected until the subject discontinues 
study participation.  
Collection of AEs will commence from the time that the subject is first administered study drug 
(Visit 3). Routine collection of AEs will continue until [ADDRESS_131131] 
dose of study drug.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  PTE and AE Reporting  
At each study visit, the investigator will assess whether any subjective AEs have occurred. A 
neutral question, such as “How have you been feeling since your last visit?” may be asked. 
Subjects may report AEs occurring at any other time during the study. Subjects experiencing a 
serious PTE must be monitored until the symptoms subside and any clinically relevant changes 
in laboratory values have returned to baseline or there  is a satisfactory explanation for the 
change. Nonserious PTEs, related or unrelated to the study procedure, need not to be followed up 
for the purposes of the protocol.  
All subjects experiencing AEs, whether considered associated with the use of the study  drug or 
not, must be monitored until the symptoms subside and any clinically relevant changes in 
laboratory values such as have returned to baseline or until there is a satisfactory explanation for 
the changes observed. All PTEs and AEs will be documented  in the PTE/AE page of the eCRF, 
whether or not the investigator concludes that the AE is related to the study drug treatment. The 
following information will be documented for each AE:  
1. AE term.  
2. Start and stop date and time.  
3. Pattern.  
4. Intensity.  
5. Investigator ’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_117496](s) (related or not related) (not completed for PTEs).  
6. Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_117497](s), including the details 
of the suspected proc edure.

if it is determined that an AE not previously reported has been identified, normal reporting 
requirements should be followed.  
10.2.2  Collection and Reporting of SA Es 
When an SAE occurs through the AE collection period it should be reported according to the 
following procedure:  
A [COMPANY_005] SAE form must be completed in English and signed by [CONTACT_57801] [ADDRESS_131133] onset or notification o f the event. The information should be completed 
as fully as possible but contain, at a minimum:  
• A short description of the AE and the reason why the AE is categorized as serious.  
• Subject ID number.  
• Investigator’s name.  
• Name [CONTACT_115210].  
• Causality as sessment.  
The SAE form should be transmitted within [ADDRESS_131134] with ALT ≥3 × ULN AND  total bilirubin >2 × ULN OR INR >1.[ADDRESS_131135] the sponsor’s 
medical monitor within 24 hours, and follow the additional monitoring, evalua tion, and follow -

timelines and procedure for follow -up reports a re the same as those for the initial report.  
10.3.1  Safety Reporting to Investigators, IRBs or IECs, and Regulatory Authorities  
The sponsor will be responsible for reporting all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
(S[LOCATION_003]Rs) and any other applicable SAEs  to regulatory authorities, including the European 
Medicines Agency, investigators and IRBs or IECs, as applicable, in accordance with national 
regulations in the countries where the study is being conducted. Relative to the first awareness of 
the AE by/or  further provision to the sponsor or sponsor’s designee, S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be submitted 
to the regulatory authorities as expedited report within 7 days for fatal and life threatening, and 
15 days for other SAEs, unless otherwise required by [CONTACT_2091].  The sponsor will also 
prepare an expedited report for other safety concerns where these might materially alter the 
current benefit -risk assessment of a study drug/sponsor -supplied drug or that would be sufficient 
to consider changes in the study drug/spon sor-supplied drug administration or in the overall 
conduct of the trial. The study site also will forward a copy of all expedited reports to his or her 
IRB or IEC in accordance with local regulations.

CONFIDENTIAL  • Variable/endpoint: Change in weekly CDSD GI symptom severity score from baseline to 
Week 12.  
• Treatments: TAK -062 ( ) versus placebo.  
• Intercurrent events (ICEs): Treatment discontinuation (due to AE or other reasons), SIGE bar 
discontinuations, and use of rescue medications for CeD symptoms.  
– Strategy for addressing ICEs: A composite strategy will be used to address rescue 
medication use and treatment discontinuation due to lack of efficacy or treatment -related 
AEs. For subjects who use rescue medications for CeD -related symptoms, the severity of 
the treated  GI symptom(s) in CDSD on the days when the rescue medications are used 
will be set to very severe. For subjects who discontinue treatment due to lack of efficacy 
or treatment -related AEs, the Week 12 CDSD severi ty score will be set to the baseline 
(Week -1) weekly CDSD GI symptom severity score. A treatment policy strategy will be 
used to address SIGE bar discontinuation (ie, the recorded weekly CDSD GI symptom 
severity score will be used regardless of whether a subject has discontinued SIGE) and 
treatment discontinuation due to reasons other than lack of efficacy or treatment -related 
AEs.  
• Population -level summary: Treatment difference (TAK -062 – placebo) in the mean change 
from baseline to Week 12 in weekly CDSD GI symptom severity score, for each dose level.  
The primary endpoint will be analyzed with a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) 
approach using the appropriate contrast at Week 12. The model will be based on all available 
weekly CDSD  GI symptom severi ty scores from Week -[ADDRESS_131144] errors. 
If the model does not converge, additional covariance structure will be used with the order 
specified in the SAP. Two -sided tests comparing each of the TAK -062 dose groups with placebo 
at Week 12 will be conducted. The corresponding p -values, LS means of treatment differences 
and 2 -sided 95% CI will be reported. The MMRM assumes data is missing at random. 
Sensitivity analysis will be performed with alternative assumption that data is missin g not at 
random.  
Multiplicity control: To control the overall type I error rate for the primary endpoint, a fixed -
sequence testing procedure will be used for the comparison of 3 doses of TAK -062 versus 
placebo. Specifically, the primary endpoint tested wi ll be conducted in the following order:

CONFIDENTIAL  Supplementary analyses for the primary estimand will include the following:  
• Estimand with the target population of subjects who satisfied study entry criteria and are on 
pre-enrollment diet. The primary endpoint will be analyzed based on FAS –no SIGE. The 
endpoint, strategy for the ICEs and population -level summary will be the same as the main 
estimand. Nominal p -values will be calculated. No hypothesis testing will be performed.  
• Estimand with the target population excluding subjects who report >1 point improvement in 
PGIS during  run -in period. The supplementary analysis will be performed for FAS -
SIGE and FAS –no SIGE separately. The endpoint definition, strategy for the ICEs and 
population -level summary will be the same as the main estimand. Nominal p -values will be 
calculated. No hypothesis testing will be perfor med.  
• Estimand with the weekly CDSD -overall (GI + Tiredness) symptom severity score based on 
daily CDSD symptom severity score that is the average of the severity score for diarrhea, 
abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, and tiredness, ranging from 0 to 4. The population, 
treatments, strategy for the ICEs and population -level summary will be the same as the main 
estimand. The analysis will be performed based on FAS -SIGE and FAS –no SIGE separately. 
Nominal p -values will be calculated. No hypothesis testing will b e performed.  
• Estimands using the area under the curve  (AUC) of daily CDSD GI symptom severity score 
from Day [ADDRESS_131146]. The detailed derivation of the AUC will be provided in the SAP. The AUC will be 
analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) based on FAS -SIGE and FAS -no SIGE 
separately . The LS means of the treatment difference compared with placebo and 2 -sided 
95% CI will be presented for each TAK -062 dose group. Nominal p -values will be 
calculated. No hypothesis testing will be performed.  
• Estimands using change in CDSD GI symptom score from Week -3 (before SIGE) and from 
Week -5 (before study intervention) to Week 12 as the endpoint. The analysis method will be 
the same as the main estimand. Nominal p -values will be calculated. No hypothesis testing 
will be performed.  
Exploratory analysis : The primary endpoint of change from baseline in C DSD  GI symptom 
severity  score  at Week  12 will also be analyzed by [CONTACT_117564] -SIGE and 
FAS-no SIGE excluding the  SIGE group, where the  effects of treatment 
group, SIGE, and their interaction effects will be estimated i n the same model.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis  
The main estimands for the secondary objectives assess the treatment effect of TAK -062 
compared with placebo at Week 24 in target population based on the following 
variable/endpoint:  
• Change in Vh:Cd from baseline (measured at Week -4) to Week 24.

CONFIDENTIAL  The target population, treatments, and ICEs are the same as for the primary estimand in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . Composite strategy will be used to address the ICEs of treatment 
discontinuation due to lack of efficacy or treatment -related AEs,  and treatment policy strategy  
for the ICEs of SIGE bar discontinuation or  rescue medication use (ie, Vh:Cd measured at 
Week 24 will be used regardless of SIGE bar discontinuation or rescue medication use ) and other 
reasons for discontinuations . 
The corresponding population -level summaries are:  
• Treatment difference (TAK -062 – placebo) in the change from baseline to Week 24 i n 
average Vh:Cd  on duodenal biopsy , for each dose level.  
The analysis will be conducted using ANCOVA. The model will include treatment group and the 
randomization stratification factors as fixed effects and baseline values as covariate. Missing 
values will  be regarded as missing at random. Missing data will be handled using multiple 
imputation (details will be provided in the SAP). The LS means and 2 -sided 95% CI will be 
provided for the Week 24 treatment difference between the  TAK -062 dose 
groups versus placebo, respectively. Nominal 2 -sided p -values will be provided for the 
comparison of  TAK -062 versus placebo,  TAK -062 versus placebo, and  
TAK -062 versus placebo, respectively.  
Supplementary analyses will be planned as follows:  
Supplementary analyses based on subjects who satisfied study entry criteria and are on pre -
enrollment diet will be performed. The corresponding endpoints will be analyzed based on FAS –
no SIGE.  
Supplementary analyses based on the target populat ion excluding subjects who report >1 point 
improvement in PGIS during  run -in period will also be performed. The analysis will be 
performed for FAS -SIGE and FAS -no SIGE separately.  
For all the above supplementary analyses, the endpoint definitions,  strategy for the ICEs and 
population -level summary will be the same as for the main estimand. Nominal p -values will be 
calculated. No hypothesis testing will be performed.  
As an exploratory analysis, the endpoint of change from baseline (Week -4) in Vh:Cd 
measurements at Week 24 will also be analyzed by [CONTACT_117564] -SIGE and 
FAS–no SIGE excluding the  TAK -062  group, where the effects of 
treatment group, SIGE and their interaction effects will be estimated in the same model.  
The analysis on Vh:Cd will be performed similarly for the changes in the individual Vh and Cd 
measurements as exploratory analyses.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Other Efficacy Endpoint Analyses  
The endpoint of change from baseline in CDSD symptom severity item score for each individual 
symptom and change in each of the frequency questions from the supplemental questions (bowel 
movements, diarrhea, and vomiting) from Week -1 to Weeks 12 and 24 will be  analyzed using 
the same approach as the primary analysis described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . The frequency of bowel

CONFIDENTIAL  movements will be converted to an indi cator for constipation (defined as fewer than 3  days of 
complete spontaneous bowel movement in a week). The weekly average of the frequency items 
will be an average of each daily frequency during the week, with constipation having values of 0 
(no constipat ion) or 1 (constipation) each week. Weekly frequency will be calculated where the 
CDSD is completed on at least 4 of the 7  days. When the daily diary is completed on less than 4 
of the 7 days, the weekly frequency will be considered missing.  
The change in symptom severity for each item in CDSD and in each frequency item in the 
supplemental questions from Week -3 (before SIGE) and from Week  -5 (before study 
intervention) to Weeks 12 and 24 will also be analyzed. The analysis method will be the same as 
for th e corresponding change from Week -1. Nominal p -values will be calculated. No hypothesis 
testing will be performed.  
PGIC score at Weeks 12 and 24 and the change from baseline in PGIS score will be assessed 
using analysis of variance model with treatment gro up and the randomization stratification 
factors as fixed effects. Other exploratory PRO endpoints at Weeks 12 and 24 will be analyzed 
using the same approach as in Sections  [IP_ADDRESS]  and [IP_ADDRESS] . 
Other exploratory histology efficacy endpoints at Week 24, including change from baseline in 
histology endpoints such as Vh, Cd, IEL, quantitative Marsh,  for the 
first tertile of the intestine will be analyzed using the same approach as in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] .  
For binary endpoints, number and proportion of subjects will be provided for each treatment arm. 
The comparison between each dose of TAK -[ADDRESS_131147] adjusted by [CONTACT_117565]. The point 
estimates for the treatment difference along with 95% CI will be provided. Nominal 2 -sided 
p-values will be provided. Nonresponder imputation will be used for missing data.  
All efficacy endpoints will also be summarized by [CONTACT_117566].  
Subgroup analysis will be performed for the efficacy endpoints based on celiac serologic status, 
symptom severity and symptom type, severity of small intestine mucosal injury, gluten  exposure 
by [CONTACT_117567] -in period, and demographics.  
13.1.4  PK Analysis  
Measured plasma concentrations of TAK -062 over time will be summarized descriptively using 
the PK analysis set. Individual concentration data versus time will be pres ented in a data listing. 
Further analysis may be performed as deemed necessary and will be reported separately from the 
clinical study report.

expression and microbial community changes will be provided in a separate document, and a 
separate report will be provided.  
13.1.7  Psychometric Analyses for CDSD  
The psychometric analysis plan (PAP) will also be  finalized before the IA. The PAP will provide 
further details of the analysis methodology for the psychometric evaluation of the CDSD. A 
separate report will be provided.  
13.1.8  Exit Interview Analysis  
Exit interviews will be qualitatively analyzed and a separat e report will be provided.  
13.1.9  Safety Analysis  
All safety analyses will be conducted using the SAF, the SAF -SIGE, and the SAF –no SIGE.  
No statistical testing or inferential statistics will be generated. All AEs will be coded using the 
latest MedDRA version. Th e number and percentage of subjects with TEAEs (new onset or 
worsening AEs after the first dose of study treatment regardless of relationship to study drug), 
treatment -related AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_117568], overall and by [CONTACT_117569].  
Change from baseline in clinical laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarized by [CONTACT_117570]. Subjects with markedly abnormal valu es for laboratory tests and vital signs 
will be summarized and listed.  
13.1.[ADDRESS_131148] will be considered posit ive only when both the screening 
and confirmatory tests show positive results. Testing for neutralizing antibodies ( NAbs) will be 
performed only if the ADA testing is considered positive. A positive ADA subject is defined as a 
subject who has at least 1 po sitive ADA result during the study, and is further categorized as:  
• Transiently positive: defined as subjects with confirmed positive ADA in at least 1 sample 
and no consecutive samples.  
• Persistently positive: defined as subjects with confirmed positive ADA in [ADDRESS_131149] 75% of s ubjects in Cohort [ADDRESS_131150] either completed 12 weeks of 
treatment or dropped out. The IA will include safety analysis, primary efficacy analysis, and 
histological data analysis based on available data. The decision to continue Cohort 2 and initiate 
enrollmen t of adolescents will be based on the safety evaluation, the conditional power for the 
primary efficacy analysis , and the analysis of Vh:Cd data. It will not lead to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_117502] 1 
for efficacy or futility. Thus, there will be no alpha level adjustment for the final analysis.  
Safety Consideration s 
Safety will focus on the severity  of reported adverse events . When the proportion of subjects 
with Grade ≥3 events related to TAK -062 is more than 20% (percentage point s) higher in the 
active arm than in the placebo arm, safety will be considered not acceptable  and may lead to 
early termination of the study . 
Efficacy Cons iderations  
For efficacy , the recommendation chart with conditional powers  for CDSD GI symptom severity 
score and the probability  of Vh:Cd  will be used for decision making by [CONTACT_117571] y data per Table 13.a. 
The conditional power  will be calculated on the basis of the test statistic in the MMRM model of 
the primary efficacy endpoint at Week 12 , and the probability for Vh:Cd at Week 24 will be 
documented in the SAP. 
The recommended decision criteria  based on the conditional power  for C DSD GI symptom 
severity score and the proba bility of Vh:Cd , after significant safety concerns  are ruled out , are 
shown  in Table 13.a.

TAK -[ADDRESS_131151] size (Levin 1997 ). A sample 
size of 53  subjects per treatment group w ill provide 80% power to detect a standardized mean 
difference (mean difference/SD) of 0.55 between  TAK -062 and placebo in the change 
from baseline CDSD weekly score (assuming common SD) for a [ADDRESS_131152] and a 5% significance level. Assuming a dropout rate of 
approximately 12%, a sample size of 60 subjects per treatment group for the  and placebo 
arms in the gluten -containing SIGE group in Cohort 1 will be the planned enrollment.  
The planned en rollment for Cohort 2 is 30 and 50 adults  per treatment arm in the placebo and 
active arms (  TAK -062), respectively, in the gluten -containing SIGE arms;  
50 subjects ( 43 adults  and 7 adolescents ) per arm in the  and placebo gluten -free S IGE 
bar arms ; and 7 (adolescents  only)  in the  gluten -free SIGE bar arm.  
For the combined placebo gluten -containing SIGE groups from Cohorts 1 and 2 versus   
TAK -062, 86% power would be provided (based on the [ADDRESS_131153] and the 5% signific ance 
level) to detect the standardized mean difference between groups (0.55) with the same 12% 
assumption  for dropout rate . In addition, 82% power would be provid ed from  the same 
assumptions for combined placebo gluten -containing SIGE group from Cohorts [ADDRESS_131154] the difference between the combined 
placebo gluten -containing  SIGE group and the active group would yield a higher power.  
14.0 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE

Authorization  
Written consent documents will embody the elements of informed con sent/pediatric assent as 
described in the Declaration of Helsinki and the ICH Guidelines for GCP and will be in 
accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. The informed consent/pediatric assent form, 
subject authorization form (if applicable), and  subject information sheet (if applicable) describe 
the planned and permitted uses, transfers, and disclosures of the subject’s personal and personal 
health information for purposes of conducting the study. The informed consent/pediatric assent 
forms and t he subject information sheet (if applicable) further explain the nature of the study, its 
objectives, and potential risks and benefits, as well as the date informed consent/pediatric assent 
is given. The informed consent/pediatric assent forms will detail the requirements of the 
participant and the fact that he or she is free to withdraw at any time without giving a reason and 
without prejudice to his or her further medical care.

oral and written form whenever possible and in the manner deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_117573]. In the event the subject is not capable of rendering adequate written informed 
consent/pediatric assent, then the subject’ s legally acceptable representative may provide such 
consent for the subject in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.   
The subject, or the subject’s legally acceptable representative, must be given ample opportunity 
to: (1) inquire about details  of the study and (2) decide whether or not to participate in the study. 
If the subject, or the subject’s legally acceptable representative, determines he or she will 
participate in the study, then the informed consent/pediatric assent forms and subject 
authorization form (if applicable) must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_423], or the subject’s 
legally acceptable representative, at the time of consent and before the subject entering into the 
study. The subject or the subject’s legally acceptable representat ive should be instructed to sign 
using their legal names, not nicknames, using blue or black ballpoint ink. The investigator must 
also sign and date the informed consent/pediatric assent forms and subject authorization (if 
applicable) at the time of consen t and before subject entering into the study; however, the 
sponsor may allow a designee of the investigator to sign to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_117574]. 
Once signed, the original informed consent/pediatric assent forms, subject authorization form (if  
applicable), and subject information sheet (if applicable) will be stored in the investigator’s site 
file. The investigator must document the date the subject signs the informed consent/pediatric 
assent forms in the subject’s medical record. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_117503]/pediatric

All revised informed consent/pediatric assent forms must be reviewed and si gned by [CONTACT_117575]’s legally acceptable representative in the same manner as the 
original informed consent. The date the revised consent was obtained should be recorded in the 
subject’s medical record, and the subject should receive a copy of the revised informed 
consent/pediatric assent forms.  
Physical and emotional pain for children will be addressed and minimized as much as possible 
during the trial. For procedures, analgesia will be provided per a professional at a site wi th 
experience in caring for and treating physical and emotional pain in patients at this age, and pain 
monitored and treated per standard of care. Blood draws may utilize lidocaine, numbing agents 
and smaller caliber needles (butterfly needles). It should be noted that pediatric patients are not 
included in the additional PK intensive blood draws.  
The volume of blood drawn will not surpass weekly or monthly safety limits for subjects ≥[ADDRESS_131163]’s weight is <[ADDRESS_131164] results and all data derived 
by [CONTACT_87853]. During and after the study, only the sponsor may make study 
information available to other study investigators or to regulatory agencies, except as required by 
[CONTACT_6617]. Except as otherwise allowable in the study site agreement, any public 
disclosure (including publicly accessible websites) related to the protocol or study results, is the 
sole responsibility of the sponsor.  
The investigator needs to obtain a prior written approval from the sponsor to publ ish any 
information from the study externally such as to a professional association .

PK sampling times are relative to the most recent dose (in hours). The actual date and time of the sample collection and the date and time for the current dose  and 
the dose before the in -clinic dose  should be accurately recorded. PK sampling time windows are as follows: predose  sample (up to 30 minutes prior to dosing), 
postdose samples at 0.5 hr (±5 minutes), 1 hr (±10 minutes), 2 hr (±10 minutes), 3 hr (±15 minutes), and 4 hr (±15 minutes). A predose antidrug antibody sample 
should be collected any time PK collections occur fo r all subjects.

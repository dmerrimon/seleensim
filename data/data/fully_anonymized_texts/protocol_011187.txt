4.1.1
 Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pembrolizumab  
The importance of intact immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformation has been known for decades.  Accumulating evidence shows a correlation 
between tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in 
various malignancies.  In particular, the presence of CD8+ T-cells and the ratio of CD8+ 
effector T-cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells seems to correlate with improved prognosis and 
long-term survival in many solid tumors. 
The PD-[ADDRESS_998015] hijacked by [CONTACT_55548].  The normal function of PD-1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T-
cells under healthy conditions, is to down-modulate unwanted or excessive immune 
responses, including autoimmune reactions.  PD-1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an Ig 
superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA-4 which has been shown to negatively 
regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD-L1 and/or PD-L2).  
The structure of murine PD-1 has been resolved.  PD-1 and family members are type I 
transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable-type (V-type) domain responsible 
for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding of signaling 
molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD-1 contains 2 tyrosine-based signaling motifs, an 
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-
based switch motif (ITSM).  Following T-cell stimulation, PD-[ADDRESS_998016] from that of CTLA-4 as both molecules 
 
 
7                                                                                              v5 dated 10Dec2018  
 
regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_77971].  PD-1 was shown to be expressed on 
activated lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, B-cells, T regs and 
Natural Killer cells.  Expression has also been shown during thymic development on CD4-
CD8- (double negative) T-cells as well as subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells.  The 
ligands for PD-1 (PD-L1 and PD-L2) are constitutively expressed or can be induced in a 
variety of cell types, including non-hematopoietic tissues as well as in various tumors.  Both 
li
gands are type I transmembrane receptors containing both IgV- and IgC-like domains in the 
extracellular region and contain short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs.  
Binding of either PD-[ADDRESS_998017] 
notably on vascular endothelium, whereas PD-L2 protein is only detectably expressed on 
antigen-presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments.  
PD-L2 is thought to control immune T-cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD-L1 
serves to dampen unwarranted T-cell function in peripheral tissues.  Although healthy organs 
express little (if any) PD-L1, a variety of cancers were demonstrated to express abundant 
levels of this T-cell inhibitor.  PD-1 has been suggested to regulate tumor-specific T-cell 
expansion in subjects with melanoma (MEL).  This suggests that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway 
plays a critical role in tumor immune evasion and should be considered as an attractive target 
for therapeutic intervention. 
Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of 
the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its 
ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2.  Keytruda® (pe mbrolizumab) has been approved in the United 
States for the treatment of patients non-small cell lung cancer (1st and 2nd line), head and 
neck cancer, and melanoma. 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Lenvatinib 
Lenvatinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activities of 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), 
and VEGFR3 (FLT4). Lenvatinib also inhibits other RTKs that have been implicated in 
pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal 
cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4; the 
platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), KIT, and RET.1

 Preclinical and Clinical Trial Data  
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochures and package inserts for Preclinical and Clinical data.  
 
 
[ADDRESS_998018] Population 
The treatment landscape of advanced neuroendocrine tumors (NET) has advanced rapi[INVESTIGATOR_730679], with several systemic therapeutic options for patients with metastatic 
disease.2-[ADDRESS_998019] not been shown to be highly active in well-
differentiated gastroenteropancreatic or lung NETs, or in poorly differentiated 
neuroendocrine carcinomas originating outside the lung.  Preliminary evidence suggests that 
PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy is relatively ineffective, with response rates <10% in most 
subsets of NETs.   
Lenvatinib, a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) which inhibits the kinase activities 
of
 vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), 
and VEGFR3 (FLT4) has been recently reported to be effective in NETs progressing after 
several lines of therapy (ESMO).  Response rates were 40% in pancreatic NETs, and 18.5% 
in g
astrointestinal NETs.[ADDRESS_998020] been conducted evaluating the 
combinations of antiangiogenic agents with checkpoint inhibitors in renal cell carcinoma 
(mRCC) and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) with promising results9-12.  Checkmate-
016, comparing nivolumab + sunitinib and nivolumab + pazopanib showed an ORR of 52 
and 45%, and a PFS of 48.9 and 31.4 months, respectively. A study evaluating 
pembrolizumab and lenvatinib in mRCC showed an ORR of 69%, with half of the patients 
exhibiting PR. Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab has shown striking results in endometrial 
cancer.  In a phase Ib/II basket study (KEYNOTE 146 trial; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), of heavily 
pretreated patients, ORR at week 24 was 45% and the overall ORR was 47.2%. This study 
led the FDA to grant a breakthrough therapy designation for the combination of lenvatinib 
and pembrolizumab in 8/2018.    
Given the encouraging results in other trials, and the fact that VEGFR-TKIs typi[INVESTIGATOR_730680]-durable responses and checkpoint inhibitors produce slow but durable 
responses, this is combination therapy is  of particular interest to explore in NET tumors. 
P
ancreatic NETs will be excluded due to the already high response rate observed with 
lenvatinib monotherapy. 
4.2.2 Rationale for Dose Selection/Regimen/Modification   
[IP_ADDRESS] P
embrolizumab 
An open-label Phase I trial (Protocol 001) was conducted to evaluate the safety and clinical 
activity of single agent pembrolizumab.  The dose escalation portion of this trial evaluated 
three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) in 
 
 
[ADDRESS_998021] in human study of pembrolizumab showed 
e
vidence of target engagement and objective evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose 
levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W).  No MTD has been identified to date.  10.0 
mg/kg Q2W, the highest dose tested in PN001, will be the dose and schedule utilized in 
Cohorts A, B, C and D of this protocol to test for initial tumor activity.  Recent data from 
other clinical studies within the pembrolizumab program has shown that a lower dose of 
pe
mbrolizumab and a less frequent schedule may be sufficient for target engagement and 
cli
nical activity. 
 
PK data analysis of pembrolizumab administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic 
c
learance, limited volume of distribution, and a long half-life (refer to IB).  
Pharmacodynamic data (IL-2 release assay) suggested that peripheral target engagement is 
dura
ble (>21 days).  This early PK and pharmacodynamic data provides scientific rationale 
for testing a Q2W and Q3W dosing schedule.   
 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed using serum concentration time 
da
ta from [ADDRESS_998022] a wide 
ther
apeutic range based on the melanoma indication.  The differences in exposure for a 200 
mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 2 mg/kg Q3W body weight based regimen are 
anticipated to remain well within the established exposure margins of 0.5 – 5.0 for 
pe
mbrolizumab in the melanoma indication. The exposure margins are based on the notion of 
simil
ar efficacy and safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. the proposed dose regimen of 
2 mg/kg Q3W (i.e. 5-fold higher dose and exposure). The population PK evaluation revealed 
that there was no significant impact of tumor burden on exposure. In addition, exposure was 
similar between the NSCLC and melanoma indications. Therefore, there are no anticipated 
changes in exposure between different indication settings. 
 
The rationale for further exploration of 2 mg/kg and comparable doses of pembrolizumab in 
solid tumors is based on: 1) similar efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab when dosed at 
either 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg Q3W in melanoma patients, 2) the flat exposure-response 
relationships of pembrolizumab for both efficacy and safety in the dose ranges of 2 mg/kg 
Q3W to 10 mg/kg Q3W, 3) the lack of effect of tumor burden or indication on distribution 
behavior of pembrolizumab (as assessed by [CONTACT_78013]) and 4) the assumption 
that the dynamics of pembrolizumab target engagement will not vary meaningfully with 
tumor type. 
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W as an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is based 
on simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that the 
 
 
10                                                                                              v5 dated 10Dec2018  
 
fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally consistent 
with those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will maintain individual patient 
exposures in the exposure range established in melanoma as associated with maximal 
efficacy response and 3) will maintain individual patients exposure in the exposure range 
established in melanoma that are well tolerated and safe.  
A fixed dose regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenient for physicians 
and to reduce potential for dosing errors.  A fixed dosing scheme will also reduce complexity 
in the logistical chain at treatment facilities and reduce wastage. 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Lenvatinib 
The recommended daily dose of lenvatinib is 24 mg (two 10mg capsules and one 4mg 
capsule) orally taken once daily with or without food. Lenvatinib is taken at the same time 
each day. If a dose is missed and cannot be taken within 12 hours, patients should skip that 
dose and take the next dose at the usual time of administration.  
After oral administration of lenvatinib, time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax) typi[INVESTIGATOR_730681] [ADDRESS_998023] the extent of 
absorption, but decreased the rate of absorption and delayed the median Tmax from 2 hours 
to 4 hours. 
4.2.3 Rationale for Endpoints 
[IP_ADDRESS] E fficacy Endpoints 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Primary endpoint: RECIST-based response rate 
Objective radiographic response (ORR) rate is a simple and standard criterion for assessing 
the efficacy of an agent(s) in a single-arm phase II trial.  Numerous prior studies of 
pe
mbrolizumab and lenvatinib have indicated that these agents are capable of yielding a 
clinically meaningful objective response in immunosensitive malignancies.   Therefore ORR 
will be used as the primary endpoint per RECIST 1.1 criteria (see section 11.3 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 S
econdary efficacy endpoints 
Secondary endpoints include: (1) DOR, defined as the time from first documented evidence 
of CR or PR until disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, (2) 
PFS, defined as the time from initial treatment to the first documented disease progression 
according to RECIST 1.1, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, and (3) OS 
defined as the time from initial treatment until death from any cause.   
Confirmation of PR/CR should be performed with radiographic assessment ≥ 4 weeks after 
initial documentation of PR/CR.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Biomarker Research 
While tumoral PD-L1 expression has not been validated as a predictive marker across all 
malignancies, it appears to be a predictive marker for PD-[ADDRESS_998024] previously found that well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors can express PD-L1 
(unpublished data). We will assess PD-L1 expression on archival tissue in this study both to 
evaluate the rate of expression of this antigen and also to analyze correlation between 
expression and response. 
Responses to pembrolizumab have been particularly high in microsatellite instability high 
(MSI-H) tumors.   We will therefore test for MSI status by [CONTACT_730686] (MMR) deficiency via immunohistochemical (IHC) stains.  Cases that are positive for 
MMR protein deficiency will subsequently be tested for MSI. The prevalence of MSI- H 
tumors in this population of patients is unknown.  
Tumor mutation burden (TMB) has emerged as a highly promising and clinically validated 
biomarker, particularly in the setting of lung cancer. Studies have shown that patients with 
high TMB can predict response to a range of various types of immunotherapy. The 
relationship between tumor DNA mutation burden and response to treatment will be 
explored.

Trial treatment should begin as close as possible to the date on which treatment is 
allocated/assigned. 
5.2.1 Dose Selection/Modification 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose Selection 
The rationale for selection of doses to be used in this trial is provided in Section 4.0 – 
Background and Rationale.   
Details on preparation and administration of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib are provided in 
the Pharmacy Manuals.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose  Delays and Discontinuation   
Pembrolizumab and lenvatinib may be interrupted for situations other than treatment-related 
AEs such as medical / surgical events or logistical reasons not related to study therapy. 
Subjects should be placed back on study therapy within 3 weeks of the scheduled 
interruption, unless otherwise discussed with the Sponsor. The reason for interruption should 
be documented in the patient's study record.  
 
Patients may continue on study treatment with either drug as monotherapy should they 
require discontinuation of one of the study drugs due to unacceptable toxicity or intolerance. 
Patients will continue to follow the study schedule and procedures, per protocol until 
discontinuation criteria is met for the second drug.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose Modification and toxicity management for immune-related AEs 
associated with pembrolizumab 
AEs associated with pembrolizumab exposure may represent an immunologic etiology. 
These immune-related AEs (irAEs) may occur shortly after the first dose or several 
months after the last dose of pembrolizumab treatment and may affect more than one body 
s
ystem simultaneously. Therefore, early recognition and initiation of treatment is critical 
to re
duce complications.  Based on existing clinical trial data, most irAEs were reversible 
and could be managed with interruptions of pembrolizumab, administration of 
corticosteroids and/or other supportive care. For suspected irAEs, ensure adequate 
evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Additional procedures or tests such 
as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, skin biopsy may be included as part of the evaluation. Based 
on the severity of irAEs, withhold or permanently discontinue pembrolizumab and 
administer corticosteroids. Dose modification and toxicity management guidelines for 
irAEs associated with pembrolizumab are provided in Table 3.

5.2.2 Timing of Dose Administration 
Trial treatment should be administered on Day 1 of each cycle after all 
procedures/assessments have been completed as detailed on the Trial Flow Chart (Section 
6.0).  Trial treatment may be administered up to 3 days before or after the scheduled Day 1 of 
each cycle due to administrative reasons. 
All trial treatments will be administered on an outpatient basi s. 
Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion every 3 weeks.  
Sites should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as 
possible.  However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of - 5 
minutes and +10 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: -5 min/+10 min). 
Lenvatinib 24 mg will be administered orally and provided in 10mg and 4mg capsules 
(supplied in cartons of 6 cards; each card is a 5-day blister card), taken daily with or without 
food. Lenvatinib should be taken at the same time each day. If a dose is missed and cannot be 
taken within [ADDRESS_998046] occurrence Interrupt until resolved  to 
Grade  0-1 or baseline  20 mg (two 10 mg capsules)  
orally  once  daily  
Second  occurrencec  
Interrupt until resolved  to 
Grade  0-1 or baseline  14 mg (one 10 mg capsule  plus 
one 4 mg capsule)  orally  once

The Pharmacy Manual contains specific instructions for the preparation of the 
pembrolizumab infusion fluid and administration of infusion solution. Lenvatinib will be 
dispensed and handled according to the FDA approved package insert.  
5.2.3 Trial Blinding/Masking 
This is an open-label trial; therefore, the Sponsor, investigator and subject will know the 
treatment administered. 
5.3 Conco mitant Medications/Vaccinations (allowed & prohibited) 
Medic
ations or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing trial.  If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications 
or vaccinations specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or 
vaccination may be required.  The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this 
with the [COMPANY_006] Clinical team.  The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination 
rests with the investigator and/or the subject's primary physician.  
5.3.[ADDRESS_998047]’s welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_12983].  All concomitant medication will be recorded on the case report form (CRF) 
including all prescription, over-the-counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV medications 
and fluids.  If changes occur during the trial period, documentation of drug dosage, 
frequency, route, and date may also be included on the CRF. 
All concomitant medications received within [ADDRESS_998048] dose of trial treatment should be 
recorded for SAEs and ECIs as defined in Section 7.2.   Somatostatin analogs (octreotide and 
lanreotide) are rarely used in patients with poorly differentiated/high grade neuroendocrine 
cancers, but are allowed if needed for control of hormonal syndromes. 
5.3.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications 
Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_80025] (including retreatment for post-complete response relapse) of this trial:

†
Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of 
contraception if it is consistently employed as the subject’s preferred and usual 
lifestyle and if considered acceptable by [CONTACT_176742]/IRBs.  
Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, sympto-thermal, post-ovulation 
methods, etc.) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
  
‡
If a contraceptive method listed above is restricted by [CONTACT_427]/guidelines, 
then it does not qualify as an acceptable method of contraception for subjects 
participating at sites in this country/region. 
 
Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to 
the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  In order to participate 
in the study subjects of childbearing potential must adhere to the contraception requirement 
(described above) from the day of study medication initiation (or 14 days prior to the 
initiation of study medication for oral contraception) throughout the study period up to [ADDRESS_998052]’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated.  The 
outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006] without delay and 
 
 
29                                                                                              v5 dated 10Dec2018  
 
within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to [COMPANY_006] if the outcome is a 
serious adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or 
life-threatening complication to the mother or newborn).   
The study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of 
the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the Sponsor.   If a male 
subject impregnates his female partner the study personnel at the site must be informed 
immediately and the pregnancy reported to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006] and followed as 
described above and in Section 7.2.2. 
5.4.4 Use in Nursing Women 
It is unknown whether pembrolizumab and/or lenvatinib are excreted in human milk.  Since 
many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse 
reactions in the nursing infant, subjects who are breast-feeding are not eligible for 
enrollment. 
5.[ADDRESS_998053] Withdrawal/Discontinuation Criteria 
Subjects may withdraw consent at any time for any reason or be dropped from the trial at the 
discretion of the investigator should any untoward effect occur.  In addition, a subject may be 
withdrawn by [CONTACT_80074], the 
trial plan is violated, or for administrative and/or other safety reasons.  Specific details 
regarding discontinuation or withdrawal are provided in Section 7.1.3 – Other Procedures. 
A subjec
t must be discontinued from the trial for any of the following reasons: 
 The  subject or legal representative (such as a parent or legal guardian) withdraws 
consent. 
 Confirmed radiographic disease progression 
 Una cceptable adverse experiences as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
 I ntercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment 
 Investigator’s decision to withdraw the subject 
 The subject has a confirmed positive serum pregnancy test 
 Noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements 
 The subject is lost to follow-up

 Completed 24 months of uninterrupted treatment with pembrolizumab or 35 
administrations of study medication, whichever is later. 
 Administrative reasons 
The End of Treatment and Follow-up visit procedures are listed in Section 6 (Protocol Flo w 
Chart) and Section 7.1.4 (Visit Requirements).  After the end of treatment, each subject will 
be
 followed for 30 days for adverse event monitoring (serious adverse events will be 
collected for 90 days after the end of treatment as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  Subjects 
who discontinue for reasons other than progressive disease will have post-treatment follow-
up for disease status until disease progression, initiating a non-study cancer treatment, 
withdrawing consent or becoming lost to follow-up.  After documented disease progression 
each subject will be followed by [CONTACT_80075], withdrawal of 
consent, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first.

Laboratory tests and vital signs which fall out of normal range will only be reported as 
adverse events if considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_093]. 
7.2.1 Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to the 
Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006] 
For purposes of this trial, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose of 1,000 
mg or greater (≥5 times the indicated dose).  An overdose of lenvatinib will be defined as any 
dose of 120 mg or greater (≥5 times the indicated dose). No specific information is available 
on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab or lenvatinib. Appropriate supportive 
treatment should be provided if clinically indicated. In the event of overdose, the subject 
should be observed closely for signs of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive treatment should be 
provided if clinically indicated. 
If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a [COMPANY_006] product , 
the adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no other seriousness 
criteria are met. 
If a dose of [COMPANY_006] ’s product meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without any 
associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a 
non-serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology “accidental or intentional 
overdose without adverse effect.”

 7.2.4 Evaluating Adverse Events 
An investigator who is a qualified physician will evaluate all adverse events according to the 
NCI Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0. Any adverse event 
whic
h changes CTCAE grade over the course of a given epi[INVESTIGATOR_110507]/worksheets. 
All adverse events regardless of CTCAE grade must also be evaluated for seriousness. 
Laboratory tests and vital signs which fall out of normal range will only be reported as 
adverse events if considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_093]. 
45 
 
   
 
 Table 6.5  Evaluating Adverse Events 
An inve
stigator who is a qualified physician, will evaluate all adverse events as to: 
V4.0 CTCAE 
Grading  Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mid symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated.  
 Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental ADL.  
 Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77991]; 
disabli ng; limiting self -care ADL.  
 Grade 4  Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
 Grade [ADDRESS_998082] that:  
 †Results in death ; or 
 †Is life threatening; or  places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred (Note: This doe s not include an 
adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.); or  
 †Results in a persiste nt or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions); or  
 †Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19357], regardless of leng th of stay, even if the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138] a precautionary measure for continued observation. (Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_730685] a pre -existing condition that has not 
worsened is not a serious adverse event.  A pre -existing condition  is a clinical condition that is diagnosed prior to the use of a [COMPANY_006] product and is documented in 
the patient’s medical history.); or  
 †Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  (in offspring of subject taking the product regardless of time to diagnosis);or  
 Is a new cancer  (that is not a condition of the study)  (although not serious per ICH definition, is reportable to the Sponsor within 24 hours and to [COMPANY_006] within 2 
working days to meet certain local requirements); or 
 Is an overdose  (whether accidental or intentional).  Any adverse event associated with an overdose is considered a serious adverse event for  collection purposes. An 
overdose that is not associated with an adverse event is considered a non -serious event of clinical inter est and must be reported within [ADDRESS_998083] and may require medical or surgical interventio n to prevent one of the outcomes

 listed previously (designated above by a †).  
Duration  Record the start and stop dates of the adverse event. If less than [ADDRESS_998084] to be discontinued?  
Relationship to 
[COMPANY_006]  Product  Did [COMPANY_006]  product cause the adverse event? The determinati on of the likelihood that [COMPANY_006]  product caused the adverse event will be provided by [CONTACT_78031] a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted on the AE form, e nsures 
that a medically qualified assessment of causality was done. This initialed document must be retained for the required regula tory time frame. The criteria below are 
intended as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelih ood of a relationship between the test drug and the adverse event based upon the 
available information.  
The following components are to be used to assess the re lationship between [COMPANY_006]  product and the AE ; the greater the correlation with the components and  
their respective elements (in number and/or intensity ), the more likely [COMPANY_006]  product caused the adverse event (AE):  
 Exposure  Is there evidence that the subject was a ctually exposed to [COMPANY_006]  product such as: reliable history, acceptable compliance assessment (pi[INVESTIGATOR_692], 
diary, etc.), expected pharmacologic effect, or measurement of drug/metabolite in bodily specimen?  
 Time Course  Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from  admi nistration of [COMPANY_006]  product?  
Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a drug -induced effect (applies to trials with investigational medicinal product)?  
 Likely Cause  Is the AE not reasonably explained by [CONTACT_26369],  other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or environmental factors  
 
[ADDRESS_998085] drug and the AE: (continued)  
to [COMPANY_006]  
Product  
(continued)  Dechallenge  Was [COMPANY_006]  product discontinued or dose/exposure/frequency reduced?  
If yes, did the AE resolve or improve?  
If yes, this is a positive dechallenge. If no, this is a negative dechallenge.  
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the AE resulted in death or perm anent disability; (2) the AE resolved/improved despi[INVESTIGATOR_77992]’s product; or (3) the trial is a single -dose drug trial); or (4) Sponsor’s product(s) is/are only used one time.)  
 Rechallenge  Was the sub ject re -exposed to [COMPANY_006]  product in this study?  
If yes, did the AE recur or worsen?  
If yes, this is a positive rechallenge. If no, this is a negative rechallenge.  
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the initial AE resulted in death or permanent disability, or (2) the trial is a single -dose drug trial); or 
(3) Sponsor’s product(s) is/are used only one time).  
NOTE: IF A RECHALLENGE IS PLANNED FOR AN ADVERSE EVENT WHICH WAS SERIOUS AND WHICH MAY H AVE BEEN 
CAUSED BY [CONTACT_180751], O R IF REEXPOSURE TO MERCK  PRODUCT  POSES ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT RISK 
TO THE SUBJECT, THEN THE RECHALLENGE MUST BE APPROVED IN ADVANCE BY [CONTACT_176757].  
 Consistency 
with Trial 
Treatment 
Profile  Is the clinical/pathological presentation of the AE consistent with previous k nowledge regarding [COMPANY_006]  product or drug class pharmacology or 
toxicology?  
The assessment of relationship will be reported on the case report forms /worksheets by [CONTACT_19427] a qualified ph ysicia n according to his/her best clinical judgment, including 
consideration of the above elements.  
Record one of the following  Use the following scale of criteria as guidance (not all criteria must be present  to be indicative of [COMPANY_006]  product relationship).  
Yes, there is a rea sonable 
possibility of [COMPANY_006]  product 
relationship.  There is evide nce of exposure to [COMPANY_006]  product.  The temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to the  administration of [COMPANY_006]  product is 
reasonable.  The AE is more likely exp lained by [CONTACT_78034].  
No, there is not a rea sonable 
possibility of [COMPANY_006]  product 
relationship  Subje ct did not receive the [COMPANY_006]  product OR temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to administration of [COMPANY_006]  product is not reasonable 
OR t he AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_535712].  (Also entered for a subject with overdose without an associated 
AE.)

7.2.5 Sponsor Responsibility for Reporting Adverse Events 
All Adverse Events will be reported to regulatory authorities, IRB/IECs and investigators in 
accordance with all applicable global laws and regulations.  
8.[ADDRESS_998086] phase II study.  The sample size calculation is based on the 
assumption that a true response of >38% would generate interest in a larger randomized 
stud
y.  With [ADDRESS_998087] the hypothesis that the true response rate is 
38%
 versus 18% (null) with a power of 90% and a type 1 error of 8%.  Patients will be 
a
ccrued to the protocol according to a Simon’s two-stage minimax design.  20 patients will 
be enrolled in stage 1.  If 4 or more responses are observed, than another 15 subjects will be 
e
nrolled into stage 2.  At the completion of the study, if 10 or more responses out of N=35 
a
re observed, significance at 8% is reached.  Under this design, if the true response rate is 
≥38%, then the probability of observing ≥1 response in stage 1 is 95%.   
The progression-free survival (PFS) estimates will be shown by [CONTACT_5263]-Meier curve, and 
noted at landmark times: 3, 6, and 12 months.  For patients with a response, the duration of 
response will be plotted using a Kaplan-Meier curve and the median survival obtained from 
it.  The progression-free survival estimates will be shown by [CONTACT_5263]-Meier curve, and noted 
at landmark times: 3, 6, and 12 months.  The overall survival (OS) estimates will be shown 
by [CONTACT_5263]-Meier curve, and noted at landmark times, such as: median and [ADDRESS_998088] toxicity grade for each patient; this 
will also be done for selected key toxicities.

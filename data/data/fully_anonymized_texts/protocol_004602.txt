1.1. Background
In December 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged in Wuhan, 
Hubei, China. Sequencing analysis from the patients’ respi[INVESTIGATOR_82210] a novel 
coronavirus (CoV), which was named COVID -19. As of [ADDRESS_1043350] been identified in Wuhan, other provinces in China, and in multiple 
countrie s outside China 
{World Health Organisation (W HO) 2020 }. More than [ADDRESS_1043351] been reported, making COVID- 19 a major health emergency .
Antiviral drugs that are being evaluated as potential treatments for COVID -19 include 
lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir ( LPV/RTV ; used in the treat ment of HIV infection) and remdesivir (RDV, 
GS-5734™). In a stud y of Severe Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] S yndrome (SARS), a significant reduction 
in acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_36522]/mortalit y was observed in 41 patients treated with the 
combination of LPV/RTV , com pared with 111 patients receiving monotherapy  ribavirin 
(2.4% vs 28.8%, p  0.001). However, the use of historical control data does not allow for a 
reliable estimation of efficacy . Additionall y, LP V/RTV has multiple known adverse reactions 
such as prolonged QT interval, severe gastrointestinal reactions, abnormal bl ood glucose, 
pancreatitis, hepatic impairment, and elevated blood lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]. I t has multiple drug- to-drug 
interactions with man y commonly  used drugs in clinical practice; thus, its clinical safet y is not 
determined. Remdesivir shows potent in vitro activity  against the human pathogenic CoVs 
Middle East Respi[INVESTIGATOR_82211] (MERS)- CoV and SARS -CoV in multiple relevant human 
cell ty pes. In a mouse model of MERS -CoV infection, both prophy lactic and therapeutic RDV 
significantl y improved pulmonary function and red uce lung viral loads and severe lung 
pathology  compared with vehicle control animals. In contrast, proph ylactic LPV/RTV + 
interferon -beta ( LPV/RTV -IFNb ) slightly  reduced viral loads without impacting other disease 
parameters. Therapeutic LPV/RTV -IFNb improves pulmonary  function but did not reduce virus 
replication or severe lung pathology  {Sheahan 2020 }.
The evaluation of the safety  and potential efficacy of RDV in people with COVID
-19 is urgentl y 
needed.
1.2. Remdesivir (RDV, GS -5734)

(eg,SARS -CoV , MERS -CoV), and param yxoviruses (eg, respi[INVESTIGATOR_4345] [RSV], 
Nipah virus, and Hendra virus). For further information on RDV, refer to the curre nt 
investigator’s brochure (IB) for RDV. Information in the IB includes:
Nonclinical pharmacokinetic (PK) and in vitro metabolism
Nonclinical pharmacology  and toxicology
Clinical experience
Additional relevant information regarding RDV are described below.
1.2.2. Preclinical Pharmacology and Toxicology
Recent results from initial in vitro testing performed at the China CDC in collaboration with 
[COMPANY_009] showed that RDV has potent antiviral activity  against SARS -CoV -2in Vero cells 
(EC 500.137 μM).  I n another stud y conducted by  [CONTACT_82230] , RDV also 
showed in vitro activity  against SARS -CoV -2in Vero cells (EC 50 0.77 μM){Wang 2020}. 
[COMPANY_009] notes that the study  from the Wuhan Institute of Virology  was conducted externally  with 
drug not supplied b
y [COMPANY_009]. Researchers in the [LOCATION_002] ( US)and China are continuing to 
test RDV against clinical isolates of SARS -CoV - 2using drug supplied by [CONTACT_761872].
1.3. Rationale for This Study
There is currently no approved treatment available for COVID -[ADDRESS_1043353] SARS -CoV and MERS- CoV infection in mice and 
MERS -CoV infection in rhesus monkey s. In addition, RDV ha s been shown to be safe and 
tolerable; with a safet y database of over [ADDRESS_1043354] received RDV to date. Key  
attributes of the RDV nonclinical and clinical profile supporting its use for treatment of 
COVID -
19 are as follows:
Initial i n vitro testing performed at the China CDC in collaboration with [COMPANY_009] showed that 
RDV has potent antiviral activity  against SARS -CoV -
2in Vero cells (EC 50 0.137 μM).  
Remdesivir has also show npotent in vitro activity  against the human pathogenic CoVs
MERS -CoV and SARS -CoV in multiple relevant human cell types.

Protocol GS -US-540-5773 FINAL
[COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. Amendment 3. 0
CONFIDENTIAL Page 15 12 April 2020The PK profile of RDV in nonhuman primates (NHPs) and other relevant animal species 
indicates high and persistent levels of pharmacologically  active nucleoside triphosphate 
metabolite in peripher al blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), supporting once dail y IV 
administration as a 30 -minute infusion.
Remdesivir demonstrated prophy lactic and therapeutic efficacy  in a mouse model of 
SARS -CoV pathogenesis. Administration of 25 mg/kg RDV subcutaneously  twice daily  
beginning 1 day  before or 1 day  after SARS -CoV inoculation resulted in significantly  
reduced lung viral load and improved clinical signs of disease as well as lung function 
{Sheahan 2017}.
Inamouse model ofMERS -CoV pathogenesis, both prophy lactic andtherapeutic 
administration of
25mg/kg RDV subcutaneousl ytwice daily improved pulmonary function
andreduced lung viral loads and severe lung pathology .Incontrast, prophy lactic
LPV/RTV IFNb slightl yreduced viral loads without impacting other disease parameters.
Therapeutic L PV/RTV -IFNb improved pulmonary function but did not reduce virus 
replication or severe lung pathology  {Sheahan 2020 }.
Remdesivir also showed prophy lactic and therapeutic efficacy  in MERS -CoV -infected rhesus 
monkey s of Indian origin. Administration of RDV at 10 mg/kg (see RDV IB) or 5 mg/kg 
once dail y for 7 days using IV bolus injection beginning 1 day prior to MERS -CoV 
inoculation resulted in a significant reduction of clinical scores, clinical signs of respi[INVESTIGATOR_82212], and viral RNA levels compared to vehicle- treated animals. Therapeutic RDV 
treatment of 5 mg/kg once daily using IV bolus injection initiated [ADDRESS_1043355] - inoculation 
also resulted in re duced clinical signs, reduced virus replication in the lungs, and decreased 
presence and severit y of lung lesions {De Wit 2020}.
Remdesivir has a favorable clinical safet y profile based on approximately 500 individuals who 
received RDV primaril y as healt hy volunteers in Phase 1 studies and
individuals with acute 
EBOV infection.
The design of enrollment in two parts will allow the selection of a preferred duration of treatment 
to be determined and then allow continued access to RDV and data collection for eligible 
participants. In addition, further safet y data will be obtained.
1.4. Rationale for Dose Selection of Remdesivir
The proposed regimen for the treatment of established CoV infection, including SARS -CoV and
MERS -CoV ,is as follows: single RDV 200 mg IV loading dose on Day  1 of treatment followed 
by 100 mg IV once -daily maintenance doses for a total of up to 10 day s of dosing . The proposed 
dosing regimen is based on efficacy  studies in MERS -infected rhesus monkey s treated with RDV 
(Studies PC -399- 2037 and PC- 399-2038) and based on clinical safet y data in approximately 
500patients including healthy  volunteers and individuals with acute EBOV infection.
In the nonclinical studies, RDV was administered at 10 mg/kg (Study  PC-399-2038) or 5 mg/kg 
(Study  PC-
399-2037) once dail y for 7 days using IV bolus injection beginning either 1 day  prior 
to or 12 hours after (5 mg/kg onl y) MERS -CoV inoculation. Remdesivir treatment was

Wit 2020 }). Toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys and rats and safety and PK studies in 
healthy  volunteers support the safet y of the proposed dose . Overall, RDV has a favorable PK and 
safet y profi le that supports evaluation of a 200 mg loading and a 100 mg daily  dose that has 
potential to be efficacious in adult patients with COVID -19.
The optimal duration of therap y with RDV remains unknown.
However, other agents for acute 
antiviral infection, fo r example oseltamivir phosphate{TAMIFLU® 2019}, have treatment 
courses ranging from [ADDRESS_1043356] SARS -CoV -2 remains to be establish
ed. 
Dose selection of remdesivir (RDV) in EBOV infected pediatric patients was informed b y a 
physiologicall y-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model implemented in SimC YP (v.17, Certara). 
Briefl y, a PBPK model was developed to characterize the PK of RDV and the primary  
circulating nucleoside metabolite, GS -441524, in adults. The model was verified based on its 
ability  to describe the mean and variability  of the adult exposures using data from the RDV 
Phase 1 program (GS -US-399- 1812). The adult PBPK model was subsequently  used to simulate 
steady -state pediatric (age range 0 to 18 years) exposures (AUC tau), accounting for 
age-dependent changes in organ volume/size (liver and kidney ), esterase expression, plasma 
protein binding, and organ blood flow.
These simulations do not account for diminished liver or kidney  function due to SARS -CoV -

Accordingl y, the risk:benefit profile, described below, is the same for adolescents and adults.

Protocol GS -US-540-5773 FINAL
[COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. Amendment 3. 0
CONFIDENTIAL Page 17 12 April 2020A pertinent specific risk for participa ntsin this study  is the potential for transient ,Grade ≤ 2, 
treatment -emergent elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT )and aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST ), which were observed after multiple daily  RDV administrations in Studies 
GS-US-399- 1954 and GS -US- 399-5505.
To date in human studies, no serious adverse events ( SAEs )have occurred in healthy  individuals 
who have received at least 1 dose of RDV. Remdesivir has been tested in healthy  volunteers as a 
single ascending dose over a dose range of 3 to 225 mg and in a multi -dose study  of 150 mg for 
up to 14 days and at 200 mg loading dose followed by  100 mg for a total of 10 day s. 
In nonclinical animal studies, toxicity  findings were consistent with dose- dependent and 
reversible kidney  injury  and dy sfunction. The clinical significance of the nephrotoxicity  noted in 
animal species is unknown
.The etiology  of reversible kid ney injury  observed in rats is consistent 
with the ability  of rat renal organic anion transporters (OATs), but not human OATs, to 
efficientl y interact with blood metabolites of RDV , particularl y GS -704277. This effect may  lead 
to proportionally  higher intr acellular accumulation of drug metabolites in renal rat tubules, 
leading to kidney  injury .
The 200 mg loading dose with 8 g of sulfobut ylether β -cyclodextrin sodium (SBECD) on Day 1
will be followed by  100 mg of RDV each day  for 4 or 9 day s with 4 g of SBECD, which is 
within the range of daily  SBECD administration considered safe in humans. A total of 
250mg/kg/day  of SBECD is considered safe b y the European Medicines Agency  and is therefore 
safe for people with weight over 32 kg. The 100 mg dose prepared in 0.9% saline will be 
hypertonic relative to human serum osmolality  but approaches the normal phy siological osmolar 
range for humans. The RDV regimen consisting of a loading dose of [ADDRESS_1043359].
The risk mitigation strategy  for this study  includes restriction of the study  population to those 
without a history  of significant renal or hepatic disease:
Exclusion of participants with AL T > 5 ULN 
Exclusio n of participants with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 50mL/min
Exclusion of coadministration of other investigational agents against COVID -19
Serum chemistry assessments, including liver function testing, will be closely  monitored 
during the study  period.

An AE can therefore be any  unfavorable 
and/orunintended sign, s ymptom, or disease temporally  
associated with the use of a n investigational product, whether or not considered related to the 
investigational product. AEs may  also include pre treatment or posttreatment complications that 
occur as a result of protocol specified procedures or special situations ( Section 7.6). 
An AE does not include the following:
Medical or surgical procedures such as surgery , endoscopy , tooth extraction, andtransfusion.
The condition that led to the procedure may be an AEand must be reported.
Preexisting diseases ,conditions, or laboratory  abnormalities present or detected before the 
screening visit that do not worsen
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred ( eg,hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10800] , social and/or convenience admissions)
Overdose without clinical sequelae ( Section 7.6.1)
Any medical condition or clinically  significant laboratory  abnormality  with an onset date 
before the consent form is signed and not related to a protocol

7.1.2. Serious Adverse Events
A SAE is defined as an event that, at an y dose, results in the following:
Death
Life-threatening (Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an 
event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event that h ypotheticall y might have caused death if it were more severe.)

7.2. Assessment of Ad verse Events and Serious Adverse Events
The investigator or qualified subinvestigator is responsible for assessing AEs and SAEs for 
causality  and severity , and for final review and confirmation of accuracy  of event information 
and assessments.
7.2.1. Assessment o f Causality for Study Drugs and Procedures
The investigator or qualified subinvestigator is responsible for assessing the relationship to study  
drug using clinical judgment and the following considerations:
No: Evidence exists that the AEhas an etiology  other than the study  drug . For SAEs, an 
alternative causality must be provided (eg, pre existing condition, underl ying disease, 
intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication).
Yes:There is reasonable possibility  that the AEmay have been caused by  [CONTACT_24384] .
It should be emphasized that ineffective treatment should not be considered as causall y related in 
the context of AE reporting. 
The relationship to study  procedures (eg, invasive procedures such as venipuncture or biops y) 
should be assessed us ing the following considerations:
No: Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology  other than the study  procedure.
Yes: The AEoccurred as a result of protocol procedures (eg, venipun cture )

[COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. Amendment 3.0
CONFIDENTIAL Page 57 12 April 2020Appendix 3. Pregnancy Precautions, Definition for Female of Childbearing 
Potential, and Contraceptive Requirements
1)Definitions
a.Definition of Childbearing Potential
For the purposes of this study , a female born subject is considered of childbearing potential 
following 
the initiation of pubert y (Tanner stage 2) until becoming post -menopausal, unless 
permanentl y sterile or with medically documented ovarian failure. No documentation of Tanner 
stage will be required for people unless deemed prepubescent.
Women are considere d to be in a postmenopausal state when they  are ≥ 54 years of age with 
cessation of previously  occurring menses for ≥ 12 months without an alternative cause. In 
addition, women of an y age with amenorrhea of ≥12 months may  also be considered 
postmenopausal if their follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level is in the postmenopausal range 
and they  are not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy .
Permanent sterilization includes hy sterectomy , bilateral oophorectom y, or bilateral 
salpi[INVESTIGATOR_10822] a female subject of an y age. Tubal ligation is not considered a method of 
permanent sterilization for the purposes of this study .
b.Definition of Male Fertility
For the purposes of this study , a male born subject is considered of fertile after the initiation of 
puberty  unless permanently  sterile b y bilateral orchidectomy or medical documentation.
2)Contraception Requirements for Female Subjects
a.Study Drug Effects on Pregnancy and Hormonal Contraception
Data from nonclinical studies of RDV have demonstrated no adverse effect on fertility  or 
embry o-fetal development. Remdesivir has not y et been studied in pregnant women. Before 
enrolling into studies with RDV , women of childbearing potential must have preg nancy  testing 
performed at screening .
Available data indicate that RDV potentially  causes an interaction with hormonal contraception 
that is considered of limited significance. Hormonal methods must be used with a barrier 
method.  
Please refer to the latest version of the IBfor additional information.
Remdesivir (RDV; GS -5734™)
Protocol GS -US-540-[ADDRESS_1043402] at screening . In the 
event of a delay ed menstrual period (over 1 month between menstruations), a pregnancy  test 
must be performed to rule out pregnancy . This is applicable also for women of chil dbearing 
potential with infrequent or irregular periods. They must also agree to 1of the following from 
Screening until the last dose of the stud y drug:
Complete abstinence from intercourse of reproductive potential. Abstinence is an acceptable 
method of contraception only  when it is in line with the subject’s preferred and usual 
lifesty le.
Or
Consistent and correct use of 1 of the following methods of birth control listed below. 
Non-hormonal i ntrauterine device (IUD)
Hormonal IUD (must be used with a bar rier method)
Tubal sterilization
Vasectom y in the male partner (provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner and 
had confirmation of surgical success 3 months after procedure)
Barrier methods 
■Female barriers: Diaphragm with spermicide or Cervical cap with spermicide
■ Male barriers: Male condom (with or without spermicide)
Hormonal methods are restricted to drugs associated with the inhibition of ovulation. 
Each method must be used with a barrier method, preferabl y male condom. 
Hormonally -based contraceptives permitted for use in this protocol are as follows:
■Oral contraceptives (either combined or progesterone only )
■Injectable progesterone
■Subdermal contraceptive implant
■Transdermal contraceptive patch
■Contraceptive vaginal ring
Remdesivir (RDV; GS -5734™)
Protocol GS -US-540-[ADDRESS_1043403] of permitted methods does not imply  that the 
method is approved in any  country  or region. Methods should only  be used if locally  approved.
3) Contraception Requirements for Male Subjects 
During the study  male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential should use 
condoms when engaging in intercourse of reproductive potential.
4) Unacceptable Birth Control Methods
Birth control methods that are unacceptable include periodic abstinence ( eg,calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal , post -ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides onl y, and 
lactational amenorrhea method (LAM). A Female condom and a male condom should not be 
used together.
5)
Procedures to be Followed in the Event of Pregnancy
Subjects will be instr ucted to notify  the investigator if they  become pregnant at any  time during 
the study .Subjects who become pregnant or who suspect that they  are pregnant during the stud y 
must report the information to the investigator and discontinue study  drug immediatel y. Subjects 
whose partner has become pregnant or suspects she is pregnant during the study  must report the 
information to the investigator. Instructions for reporting pregnancy , partner pregnancy , and 
pregnancy  outcome are outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS].

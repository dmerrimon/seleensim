Medications and Adverse Events will be assessed.  Dispensing of 
subject diary will be done.  Eligible subjects will be provided with a 
container for the 24-h urine collection, to be returned to the site the day 
after completing the collection, 1-2 days before or on the date of their 
next visit (V2).  This visit will be followed by a 14±2 day run-in period.
Treatments that are disallowed by [CONTACT_96881] 1, including current ICS (as monotherapy or as combination 
ICS/LABA).  The subjects will be instead prescribed an equivalent 
daily dose of ICS as beclomethasone dipropi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] (QVAR® 40 or 
80µg/actuation) and this treatment regimen should remain stable for the 
entire run-in period.  Subjects will receive rescue medication (albuterol) 
with instructions for “on demand” use for the entire study period.
At randomization visit (Visit 2), inclusion/exclusion criteria, adverse 
events and concomitant medications will be reviewed.  Eligibility 
recheck will be completed.  Pre-dose vital signs and spi[INVESTIGATOR_68333] 
[FEV 1, FVC] will be performed.  A 12-lead ECG, physical 
examination, urine pregnancy test will be performed, and training on 
the use of inhalers will be conducted.  The ACQ will be assessed.  The 
24-h urine collection container will be collected from the subject if not 
already done, and shipped to a central laboratory for 24-h urine free 
cortisol and creatinine measurement.  Eligible subjects will then be 
randomized to one of the treatment groups and will receive the 1st dose 
of study drug under medical supervision.  The subjects will then leave 
the clinical center and will be instructed to return in 4 weeks. 
At Week 4 (Visit 3) subjects will undergo a physical examination, urine 
pregnancy test, concomitant medications review, adverse events, study 
drug dispensation and vital signs assessment. Study drug will be 
returned and accountability will be performed.  Pre-dose spi[INVESTIGATOR_252855] (FEV 1, FVC) will be performed and ACQ will be assessed. 
Subjects will be provided with a container for the 24-h urine collection, 
to be returned to the site the day after completing the collection, 1-2 
days before or on the date of their next visit (V4).  The subject will be 
instructed to return to the clinical center in 4 weeks.  
At Week 8 (Visit 4) subjects will come to the clinical center and will 
undergo a physical examination, hematology and blood chemistry, 
serum/urine pregnancy test and vital signs assessment. A 12-lead ECG 
will be performed. Concomitant medications and adverse events will be 
assessed.  Pre-dose spi[INVESTIGATOR_68333] [FEV 1, FVC] will be performed.  
No administration of the study drug will take place at V4.   The 
ACQ will be assessed. The 24-h urine collection container will be 
collected from the subject if not already done, and shipped to a central 
laboratory for 24-h urine free cortisol and creatinine measurement.  
Study drug will be returned and accountability will be done.  Subject 
diary will be returned by [CONTACT_423].  After the last assessment a 
follow-up phone call will be scheduled with the subject.
At Week 9 (Visit 5): A safety follow up phone call will be performed 
by [CONTACT_96936] 1 week after the 
final visit (V4) or Early Termination Visit to check the status of 
unresolved AEs and to record any new AEs that may have occurred

Sample size calculationThe sample size has been calculated to evaluate the superiority of CHF 718 
pMDI at different doses over placebo in terms of change from baseline in 
pre-dose morning FEV 1 at Week 8.
A total of 495 evaluable subjects (99 per group) will provide 80% power to 
detect a mean difference of 200mL between each dose of CHF 718 pMDI 
and placebo at a two-sided significance level of 0.0167 (since 3 dose levels 
will be tested, the Bonferroni adjustment has been taken into account: 
0.0167 = 0.05/3), assuming a standard deviation of 430mL.
Considering a non-evaluable rate of 15%, a total of approximately 585 
subjects (117 per group) will be randomized.
Statistical methods Primary efficacy variable
Change from baseline in pre-dose morning FEV 1 will be analysed using a 
linear mixed model for repeated measurements including treatment, visit, 
treatment by [CONTACT_23259], ICS dose before study (low/medium daily 
dose) and US regions as fixed effects, and the baseline value (average of 
the pre-dose FEV 1 measurements at Visit 2) and baseline by [CONTACT_653597]. An unstructured covariance matrix will be 
assumed. 
The adjusted means in each treatment group, the adjusted mean difference 
between treatments and their 95% two-sided Confidence Intervals (CIs) at 
Week 8 will be estimated by [CONTACT_10994]. The CIs and the p-values of the 
comparisons between each dose of CHF 718 pMDI and placebo at Week 8 
will be adjusted for multiplicity. The adjustment will be based on the 
parametric simulation method by [CONTACT_96886]. At each dose level, 
the superiority of CHF 718 pMDI over placebo will be demonstrated by a

No multiplicity adjustment will be performed in the secondary efficacy 
analyses.
For change from baseline in pre-dose morning FEV 1 at Week 4, the 
adjusted means in each treatment group and the adjusted mean 
differences between treatments at Week 4 will be estimated with their

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22/781. INTRODUCTION
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) currently ranks as the 4th leading cause of 
death in the world, and is expected to be in 3rd place by 2020.[1] COPD is both a preventable and 
treatable disease that is characterized by [CONTACT_96896][INVESTIGATOR_96807]/or alveolar abnormalities usually caused by [CONTACT_96897] (e.g. cigarette smoke, biodiesel fumes).  A mixtures of lung abnormalities are 
characteristic of COPD, including small airway and parenchymal disease (obstructive bronchiolitis; 
emphysema), with variable contributions in any given subject.[2]
The NHANES III national survey estimated the U.S. prevalence of COPD to be 10.2% to 20.9% 
based on whether pre- or post-bronchodilator values were used and which diagnostic criterion 
(fixed ratio or lower limit of normal {LLN}) was applied.[3][4] COPD most often occurs in people 
[ADDRESS_888139] a history of smoking (current or former smokers). While not 
everybody who smokes gets COPD, approximately 80-90% of the individuals who have COPD 
have smoked. [5]
Smoking cessation can have the greatest influence on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_96808], as well as 
increasing survival and reducing morbidity.[6]  However, long-term cessation success rates rarely 
exceed 25%.[2][7]
Existing pharmacologic therapy is used to improve airflow, symptoms, exercise capacity, health 
status, and reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations in stable COPD. To date, there is no 
conclusive evidence that any available pharmacotherapy for COPD modifies the long-term decline 
in lung function.  The mainstays of pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_658470]:
Short acting or long-acting bronchodilators (SABD; LABD):
oShort acting and long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists (SABA; LABA) improve 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_96810] [ADDRESS_888140] smooth muscle tone, and 
tend to reduce dynamic hyperinflation (Residual Lung Volume) at rest and during 
exercise, and improve exercise performance.
Adverse events include sinus tachycardia, rhythm disturbances, and 
hypokalemia. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_96811], no association 
between the use of this class and loss of lung function and increased 
mortality has been reported in COPD.[8][9][10] 
oShort-acting and long-acting antimuscarinics (SAMA; LAMA). These drugs act 
mainly by [CONTACT_96898] M3. Tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_96812] a LAMA that has been shown to improve 
lung function, symptoms, health status,[11] effectiveness of pulmonary 
rehabilitation,[12][13] and to reduce exacerbations and related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602][14] 
compared to placebo. 
 
 -Clinical Study Protocol-
Clinical Study Code: CCD-05993AA3-01 Version No.: 4.0 
IND No.: IND 133679 Date: 05Jun2018
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 23/78Adverse events of this class of medications are mainly due to their 
anticholinergic activities, and include dry mouth, constipation, urinary 
retention and increased intraocular pressure.
oCombination Bronchodilators: Combining bronchodilators using a LABA and a 
LAMA increases FEV 1, albeit not to the full additive effect of each individual 
component; improves PROs and reduces exacerbations vs monotherapy.  One study 
(FLAME trial) in subjects with post-BD FEV 1 ≥ 25% and < 60% predicted, an 
mMRC score of ≥2, and a history of ≥1 exacerbation reported an 11% further 
reduction in COPD exacerbations with fixed combination of once daily indacaterol 
110µg + glycopyrronium 50µg (LABA+LAMA) compared to fixed combination 
twice daily fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] 500µg + salmeterol 50µg (ICS+LABA).[15]  
Combining a SABA and a SAMA or a LABA and LAMA can be done using 
separate inhalers or using a single inhaler containing a fixed dose combination.  
Anti-inflammatory agents
oInhaled Corticosteroids (ICS) alone: The available evidence does not support a 
beneficial effect of ICS monotherapy in subjects with COPD.[16]
oICS in combination with LABD: Most studies in subjects with mod-severe COPD 
and history of exacerbations found a beneficial effect of ICS+LABA fixed dose 
combination over either component alone in improving lung function, health status, 
and in reducing exacerbations.  Studies that evaluated withdrawal of ICS have 
yielded equivocal results.
Post-hoc analyses suggest that sputum and blood eosinophil count may be a 
predictor of ICS efficacy, particularly in preventing exacerbations.[17]
High quality evidence has confirmed an increased rate of pneumonia, oral 
candidiasis, hoarseness and skin bruising with ICS 
treatment.[18][19][20][21][22]  Factors associated with a higher risk for 
pneumonia on ICS include: current smokers, age ≥ [ADDRESS_888141] a history of 
prior exacerbation or pneumonia, a BMI < 25 kg/m2, a poor MRC dyspnea 
grade, and/or severe airflow limitation.[23][24] A meta-analysis suggested 
that subjects with COPD with lower blood eosinophil counts (<2%) had more 
pneumonia events than did those with higher counts.[25]
RCTs have reported variable outcomes regarding ICS effect on decreased 
bone mineral density (BMD)[26][27] and risk of fractures,[28] and 
observational studies suggest an increased risk of diabetes / poorly controlled 
diabetes,[29] cataracts,[30][31] and mycobacterial infections, including 
tuberculosis. [32]
Triple Combination of ICS+LABA+LAMA: Available evidence from RCTs suggests that 
adding a LAMA to an ICS+LABA (or vice-versa) further improves lung function, PROs and 
reduces exacerbations risk. [33][34][35][36][37][38] This step-up therapy can be achieved 
using various available approaches and products. More studies with this combination are 
needed to understand the benefits and risks and the target population.

Clinical Study Code: CCD-05993AA3-01 Version No.: 4.0 
IND No.: IND 133679 Date: 05Jun2018
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 24/78Asthma is a heterogeneous disease, usually characterized by [CONTACT_96899]. It is 
characterized by [CONTACT_96900], shortness of breath, chest tightness and/or
cough, and by [CONTACT_96901][INVESTIGATOR_658471].  Variations over time and intensity are often 
triggered by [CONTACT_96902], environmental/occupational exposures, or viral respi[INVESTIGATOR_58776].[39] As of 2014, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) estimated that the prevalence of 
asthma in US adults is 7.4%.[40]
The long-term goals of asthma management are to 1) achieve good symptom control, 2) to 
minimize future risk of exacerbations, 3) to minimize fixed airflow limitation and 4) to minimize 
side-effects of treatment. There are 3 types of asthma medications: Controllers, Reliever s, and Add-
ons.
Controller medications (e.g. ICS, ICS+LABA, LTRA, OCS): these are used for regular 
maintenance treatment. They reduce airway inflammation, control symptoms, and reduce 
future risks such as exacerbations and decline in lung function. The controller medication is 
adjusted up or down in a stepwise approach to achieve these 4 goals.
Reliever (rescue) medications (e.g. SABA): these are provided to all subjects for as-needed 
relief of breakthrough symptoms, including during worsening asthma or exacerbations. They 
are also recommended for short-term prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. 
Reducing and, ideally, eliminating the need for reliever treatment is both an important goal 
in asthma management and a measure of the success of asthma treatment.
Add-on therapi[INVESTIGATOR_96813] (e.g. LAMA, anti-IgE mab, anti-IL-5 
mab): Some subjects with severe asthma may continue to have exacerbations despi[INVESTIGATOR_96814], and for subjects with ongoing symptoms, side-effects may be an issue 
if ICS doses continue to be stepped up. Add-on medications may be considered when 
subjects have persistent symptoms and/or exacerbations, despi[INVESTIGATOR_96815] (usually a high dose ICS+LABA).
According to the GINA Report, 2016, once asthma pharmacotherapy is prescribed, decisions are 
based on a cycle of assessment, adjustment of treatment (step up / step down), and review of 
response as shown in this table:

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25/782006 and is currently available in 35 countries worldwide including Russia and China, but not the 
US.  FOSTER® is dispensed as a Pressurized Inhalation Solution (pMDI, Modulite®) and as a dry 
powder for inhalation (DPI) by [CONTACT_96903]® device, releasing extra-fine particles.[41] 
FOSTER® pMDI has been developed with a high “extrafine” (< 1.1µm) BDP particle size fraction, 
similarly to another HFA BDP marketed formulation (QVAR® Inhalation Aerosol, Teva 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], LLC).
Chiesi Farmaceutici is also developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a fixed dose triple combination of an ICS/LABA/LAMA 
(CHF 5993) with beclomethasone dipropi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] (BDP) + formoterol fumarate (FF) + 
glycopyrronium bromide (GB), and on Sep 29, [ADDRESS_888143] to the European Medicine 
Agency (EMEA) for the treatment of COPD.  The product is administered using a single 
pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI), specifically formulated to deliver extra-fine particles 
efficiently reaching both central and peripheral airways.
The submission of the EMEA dossier is based on the results of a large and comprehensive 
development program performed by [CONTACT_96904] 2009, which included 12 clinical studies involving 
more than 8,000 subjects. [42]
As part of the US development program of this fixed dose triple combination for COPD, a full 
characterization of the individual components (BDP, FF, GB) using the same inhaler device is 
required, including clinical dose-ranging studies at multiple doses, and using appropriate 
comparators for benchmarking purposes. A dose-ranging study with Chiesi’s formulation of HFA 
BDP pMDI has not been previously done.  
The aim of this study is to characterize the dose-response of Chiesi’s BDP Pressurized Inhalation 
Solution delivered via a non-CFC-propelled metered-dose inhaler (CHF 718 pMDI) and containing 
the same excipi[INVESTIGATOR_653551]®.  Three doses of CHF 718 pMDI: 50, 200, 400µg (ex-valve) 
twice daily will be assessed vs placebo, with QVAR® Inhalation Aerosol 320µg (400µg ex-valve) 
twice daily as an active comparator. 
Dose selection of ICS in COPD is challenging given the lack of efficacy for ICS monotherapy that 
has been observed to date.  Therefore, the study will be conducted in adult subjects with asthma, 
since asthmatics are thought to be more steroid-sensitive than subjects with COPD, using trough 
FEV 1 as the primary endpoint. While exacerbations may be a more meaningful assessment of the 
added benefit of an ICS in an ICS/LABA combination in subjects with COPD, the design and 
conduct of an exacerbation trial for the purposes of dose selection are challenging.[43][44]

beclomethasone dipropi[INVESTIGATOR_16847]. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.[45]
The precise mechanism of corticosteroid action on asthma is not known. Inflammation is an 
important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a 
wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, 
lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) involved in 
inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids contribute to their efficacy in 
asthma. 
Though effective for the treatment of asthma, corticosteroids may not affect symptoms 
immediately. Individual subjects will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom 
relief. Maximum benefit may not be achieved for [ADDRESS_888144] for several days or longer.[46]
Beclomethasone dipropi[INVESTIGATOR_658475] 1962 and used medically in 1972. It was 
approved for medical use in the [LOCATION_002] in 1976. It is on the World Health Organization's List 
of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system.[47]
An HFA BDP inhalation aerosol was originally approved by [CONTACT_658493] 2000 under the 
brand name [CONTACT_658499]®, as the first CFC-free metered dose inhaler containing a corticosteroid (a 
solution of beclomethasone dipropi[INVESTIGATOR_658476]-134a). It was the first inhaler designed 
to deliver smaller particle sized medication to the large, intermediate and small airways.  This 
allowed QVAR® to control asthma at a lower dose than conventional CFC-containing BDP 
inhalers. [48]
Today, in the US, QVAR® is indicated for 1) Maintenance treatment of asthma as prophylactic 
therapy in subjects 5 years of age and older; and 2) Treatment of asthma in subjects who require 
oral corticosteroid therapy, where QVAR® may reduce or eliminate the need for the systemic 
corticosteroids.  In May 2014, the FDA additionally approved the use of QVAR® with a dose 
counter for the ongoing treatment of asthma as a preventative therapy in subjects five years of age 
and older. QVAR® is supplied in two strengths: 40 and 80µg/actuation and contains 120 
actuations/canister.[45]
Clinical Efficacy of HFA BDP :
Previously, a bridging study established the clinical equipotency with CHF 718 (HFA BDP) pMDI 
100µg 2 puffs bid (TDD = 400µg) to CFC BDP 250µg 2 puffs bid (1,000µg) in adult subjects with 
mild-moderate symptomatic asthma, previously not well-controlled on low dose ICS.[49]
QVAR® 40, 160, and 320µg (ex-actuator) twice daily doses were evaluated vs. 42, 168 or 336µg 
CFC BDP twice-daily for 6 weeks in asthmatics who exhibited a deterioration in asthma control 
during an ICS washout period. Treatment with increasing doses of both QVAR® and CFC BDP 
resulted in increased improvement in FEV 1, FEF 25-75%  and asthma symptoms.  Thus, in subjects 12 
years and older on ICS, the recommended starting dose of QVAR® was set as 40 – 160µg twice 
daily, and the maximum dose as 320µg twice daily.[50]

6.2 Dosage and Administration 
6.2.1 Selection of doses in the study
An in-vitro assessment of HFA BDP (the ICS component in CHF 1535 or FOSTER®) has been 
undertaken in comparison with QVAR® Inhalation Aerosol (3M Healthcare) using the Andersen 
Cascade Impactor (ACI). A very similar deposition profile between extrafine HFA BDP and 
QVAR® was obtained in the therapeutically useful range 1.1-4.7µm, being 22.0µg for HFA BDP 
and 23.2µg for QVAR®. The Fine Particle Dose = 36.1µg for HFA BDP and 43.3µg for QVAR®. 
MMAD and its associated geometric standard deviation (GSD) evidenced comparable particle size 
distribution, being 1.34µm ± 2.11 for BDP component in CHF 1535 and 1.14µm ± 1.87 for 
QVAR®, respectively, smaller compared to the 3.5-4.0μm found with CFC BDP).[59]
Additionally, and as part of the clinical development plan for FOSTER® Pressurized Inhalation 
Solution, a bridging study was conducted to confirm the bioequivalence of HFA BDP pMDI 100µg 
2 puffs bid (TDD = 400µg) vs. BECLOFORTE® Inhaler (CFC BDP) 250µg 2 puffs bid (1,000µg)

dose ICS.  The equivalence limit was set at ± 25L/min for the change from baseline in morning pre-
dose Peak Expi[INVESTIGATOR_96852] (AM PEF, primary endpoint),[49] similar to development studies 
with QVAR®,[60][61][62] and at ± 0.2L for FEV 1, because the upper limit of the normal variability 
of the FEV 1 measurement is known to approximate this value. [63]The results showed a LS mean 
difference in AM PEF and AM FEV 1 of 10.06 L/min (95% CI 0.88 to 19.24) and 0.05 L (95% CI (-
0.04 to 0.14) respectively at the end of 8-week treatment between HFA BDP (n=115) and CFC 
BDP (n=118) in the ITT population, this confirming a clinical equipotency ratio of 1:2.5.
With QVAR®, clinical evidence confirms that adult and elderly subjects required approximately ½ 
the dose of extrafine HFA BDP to achieve the same degree of asthma control as with CFC 
BDP.[59]
Considering that the doses assessed in the QVAR® dose-ranging studies were 40, 160, and 320µg 
(ex-actuator) twice daily[50] (corresponding to 50, 200, and 400 ex-valve, respectively), The same 
ex-valve doses of CHF 718 pMDI will be used in this dose-ranging trial, namely 50µg, 200µg, and 
400µg twice daily.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 40/786.5 Treatment allocation
A balanced block randomization scheme stratified by [CONTACT_653611] (based on US Census Bureau 
Regions: West, Midwest, South, Northeast) and ICS dose before study (low/medium daily dose) 
will be prepared via a computerized system. Subjects will be centrally assigned to one of the five 
treatment arms at the end of the run-in period through an IRT system (Interactive Response 
Technology) with a 1:1:1:1:[ADDRESS_888171]. The IRT will also generate a confirmation after every IRT transaction is performed.
The Investigator will call the IRT at each visit (from pre-screening to follow-up call) to record the 
subject number at pre-screening, to enroll and randomize the subject, to obtain the medication kit 
numbers and to register the subject status in the system. Detailed instructions for use of IRT will be 
provided to the site.

numbers, expi[INVESTIGATOR_658477] “do not dispense” after these dates. The IRT will monitor inventory 
levels at all sites and manage the study drug re-supply. The IRT will also track subject screen 
failures and discontinuations from the study.
The medication list will be provided to the labeling facility but will not be available to subjects, 
Investigators, monitors or employees of the center involved in the management of the trial before 
unblinding of the data, unless in case of emergency.
The Sponsor’s clinical team will also be blinded during the study as they will not have direct access 
to the randomization list nor to the medication list.
In case of emergency, unblinding of the study treatment code will be done through IRT. The 
treatment group will be disclosed and confirmation will follow (by [CONTACT_96924]/or notification email). 
The IRT will be designed to send a confirmation (by [CONTACT_96924]/or notification email) to the site for 
every transaction performed by [CONTACT_32366]. The Investigator will be provided with a username 
[CONTACT_658500] a separate username [CONTACT_658501], where he/she considers it essential to know what study 
treatment the subject was taking. The IRT will promptly notify the Sponsor and the Clinical 
Monitor whenever a treatment code is unblinded. 
Users from Chiesi Corporate Pharmacovigilance will have their own passwords to unblind subjects 
in case of S[LOCATION_003]Rs to be reported to the competent Regulatory Authorities and IRB. 
The subject will be provided with a card with the phone numbers of study site and Investigator to be 
called in case of emergency.

7.2 Investigations 
7.2.1 ACQ Questionnaire
The Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) is a validated questionnaire that measures the adequacy 
of asthma control and change in asthma control which occurs either spontaneously or as a result of 
 
 -Clinical Study Protocol-
Clinical Study Code: CCD-05993AA3-01 Version No.: 4.0 
IND No.: IND 133679 Date: 05Jun2018
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 52/78treatment. The ACQ consists of 7 items: six simple self-administered questions referring to asthma 
control and rescue treatment usage with one week recall, and a seventh item consisting of the % 
predicted FEV 1 completed by [CONTACT_96937]. Scoring uses a 7-point scale, with 0 indicating “totally 
controlled”  and 6 indicating “severely uncontrolled”.  The ACQ score will be calculated as the 
average of all 7 items. A score of 0.0–0.75 is classified as well-controlled asthma; 0.75–1.5 as a 
grey zone; and >1.5 as poorly controlled asthma.  The MCID is considered to be a change of 0.5 
unit.[51][64]  
The ACQ will be completed on site, at every Study Visit. Only subjects with an ACQ-7 score 1.5 
are eligible for randomization (the criteria must be met at screening and at the end of the run-in 
period).  The 7th item should be populated considering the pre-BD FEV 1 assessment at V1 and V1.1 
and the T-15 min* pre-dose FEV [ADDRESS_888206] before 
the pulmonary function testing.  Only question 7 will be completed after the testing. The 
investigator (or designated site-personnel) should check that all items have been completed by [CONTACT_1560], but the response to each item should not be questioned. The scores will then be transcribed 
into the eCRF by [CONTACT_737] (or designated site personnel).
* If the FEV 1 from the T -15 min assessment is not available at V3, V4, or ET, the FEV 1 from the T -
45 min assessment will be used.
7.2.2 Body Mass Index
Body Mass index (kg/m2) will be calculated at Visit 1 using the following equation:
Body weight (in kilograms) ÷ by [CONTACT_201098] (in meters)2. Only subjects with a BMI 18.5 ≤ BMI <35 
kg/m2 will be enrolled, to limit the potential impact of obesity on the ICS-treatment response, 
[55][56], and also to accommodate for the rising rate of obesity in the US, especially in the non-
Hispanic Blacks and Hispanic populations.[57] 
7.2.3 Vital Signs
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be measured before spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], bronchodilator, QVAR® 
or study drug administration, after [ADDRESS_888207] in resting position. The measurements will be done 
before administration of run-in ICS (V1) and study drug (V2, V3, V4). SBP and DBP has to be 
assessed twice with at least [ADDRESS_888208] may be attributed to the topi[INVESTIGATOR_96837]. [21] Generalized immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects of steroids are

Candida counts.[66] 
The subject’s mouth and throat will be visually inspected by [CONTACT_96939]-looking white lesions / oral thrush. If deemed necessary by 
[CONTACT_96940], the suspected lesion should be swabbed/scraped with a 
sterile cotton and the tissue sample sent to a laboratory for microscopic and culture identification.  
Appropriate treatment of oropharyngeal thrush (e.g. using topi[INVESTIGATOR_96838]-fungal agents) 
can be prescribed at the discretion of the study investigator as deemed necessary throughout the 
study.
7.2.5 12-lead ECG
A local ECG instrument will be used. A single ten-second 12-lead ECG will be performed before 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], bronchodilator, administration of run-in ICS (V1) and study drug (V2, V4) to verify the 
subject’s cardiac safety parameters and his/her eligibility. Prior to recording, the subject should be 
at rest for at least 5 minutes.
Safety ECGs will be taken using the site’s own instrument. Standard electrode placement will be 
used for these ECG, including placing the limb leads, dual snap electrodes will be used for the 
precordial leads.  ECG will be evaluated by [CONTACT_093]/sub-investigator on-site for any 
abnormality and clinical significance.
QTc value will be calculated using the Fridericia formula (Fridericia-corrected QTc= ). It will 𝑄𝑇
3𝑅𝑅
be calculated automatically by [CONTACT_4635]. Heart rate (HR), PR and QRS values will be also 
evaluated from ECGs at all visits.
ECGs with computerized protocol interpretation are considered normal if 
- 40 bpm ≤ Heart rate ≤ 110 bpm, 
- 120 ms ≤ PR ≤ 210 ms, 
- QRS ≤ [ADDRESS_888209] be QTcF ≤ 450ms (for males) and 470ms (for females) (as 
per Exclusion Criterion 13).
In case of relevant ECG abnormalities, the inclusion of the subject will be judged by [CONTACT_1275]. For any doubts the Investigator may consult the study’s clinical monitor. The final 
decision for enrollment would be documented in the Medical File of the subject.  Clinically 
significant abnormalities at Visit 1 not due to a pre-existing condition or clinically 
significant changes at the following visits, in the medical opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], will be 
reported as adverse events in the eCRF.

Throughout the study (after randomization), the clinic visits will start before 9 a.m. and the 
pulmonary function measurements will be conducted between 7 – [ADDRESS_888212].
The following parameters will be recorded at Visit 1, 2, 3 and 4 or Early Termination Visit:
Forced Expi[INVESTIGATOR_96843] 1st second (FEV 1, L)
oThe volume exhaled during the first second of a forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_96844]. FEV 1 is decreased in obstructive lung diseases.

timeframe, the visit should be rescheduled once within the next two days.
The run-in ICS medication (QVAR®) or the study drug should not be taken on the morning of the 
visit. If taken, the measurements should be deferred (i.e. the visit needs to be re-scheduled to take 
place within 2 days).
At Visit 1, if documentation of airway reversibility within [ADDRESS_888217]

7.2.8 24-h Urine Free Cortisol and Creatinine
Cortisol is a steroid hormone synthesized from cholesterol by a multi-enzyme cascade in the adrenal 
glands. It is the main glucocorticoid in humans. Its production is under hypothalamic-pi[INVESTIGATOR_658484]. Only a small percentage of circulating cortisol is biologically active (free), with 
the majority of cortisol inactive (protein bound). As plasma cortisol values increase, free cortisol 
(ie, unconjugated cortisol or hydrocortisone) increases and is filtered through the kidney’s 
glomerulus. Urinary free cortisol (UFC) correlates well with the concentration of plasma free 
cortisol. UFC represents excretion of the circulating, biologically active, free cortisol that is 
responsible for the signs and symptoms of hypercortisolism. UFC is a sensitive test for the various 
types of adrenocortical dysfunction, particularly hypercortisolism (Cushing syndrome). Subjects 
with Cushing syndrome due to intake of synthetic glucocorticoids should have suppressed UFC.[71]  
A measurement of 24-hour UFC excretion, by [CONTACT_60628]-tandem mass spectrometry 
(LC-MS/MS), is the preferred screening test for Cushing syndrome.[72] LC-MS/MS methodology 
eliminates analytical interferences including carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (Tegretol) and synthetic 
corticosteroids, which can affect immunoassay-based cortisol results.
24-hour urine samples will be collected for the measurement of UFC concentration and creatinine 
excretion. At V1, eligible subjects will be provided with a container for the 24-h urine collection, to 
be returned to the site the day after completing the collection, 1-2 days before or on the date of V2. 
At V3, subjects will be provided with a container for the 24-h urine collection, to be returned to the 
site after completing the collection, 1-2 days before or on the date of V4. For the purpose of this

exacerbation based on the following definitions:
Severe Asthma Exacerbation[74]
Severe asthma exacerbations are events that require urgent action on the part of the subject and 
physician to prevent a serious outcome, such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96853]. The definition 
of a severe asthma exacerbation for clinical trials should include at least 1 of the following:
Initiation of systemic corticosteroids (tablets, suspension, or injection), or an increase (e.g. 
doubling) from a stable maintenance dose, for ≥ 3 consecutive days.
oFor consistency, courses of corticosteroids separated by 1 week or more should be 
treated as separate severe exacerbations
A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96854], requiring systemic corticosteroids.
Moderate Asthma Exacerbation[75]
A moderate exacerbation is defined as ≥ 1 of criteria fulfilled and leading to a change in treatment*:
a) Nocturnal awakening(s) due to asthma requiring SABA for 2 consecutive nights 
b) Increase from baseline in occasions of SABA use on 2 consecutive days (minimum increase: 
4 puffs/day)
c)≥20% decrease in am or pm PEF from respective baseline on ≥2 consecutive 
mornings/evenings or ≥20% decrease in FEV1 from baseline
d) Visit to the emergency room/trial site for asthma treatment not requiring systemic 
corticosteroids
Subjects who experience a severe asthma exacerbation will be instructed to visit the site as soon as 
possible for an Early Termination Visit and will be withdrawn permanently from the study.  
Appropriate medical management of all asthma exacerbations will be ensured by [CONTACT_96947]’s well-being at all times. 
*Any change in treatment should be reviewed with the subject, and all concomitant medications 
should be recorded in the CRF.

10. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING
10.1 Definitions
An Adverse Event is “any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical trial subject 
administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment”.
An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
An Adverse Drug Reaction is an “untoward and unintended responses to an investigational 
medicinal product related to any dose administered”.
All adverse events judged by [CONTACT_96949] a reasonable 
causal relationship to a medicinal product qualify as adverse reactions. The expression “reasonable 
causal relationship” means to convey in general that there are facts (evidence) or arguments meant 
to suggest a causal relationship.
The definition covers also medication errors and uses outside what is foreseen in the protocol, 
including misuse and abuse of the product.
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)/Serious Adverse Drug Reaction is any untoward medical 
occurrence or effect that at any dose falls in one or more of the following categories:
- Results in death
Death is not an adverse event but an outcome. It is the cause of death that should be regarded as the 
adverse event. The only exception to this rule is “sudden death” where no cause has been 
established; in this latter instance, “sudden death” should be regarded as the adverse event and 
“fatal” as its reason for being serious.

Life-threatening refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event 
(e.g., aplastic anaemia, acute renal failure, and anaphylaxis). The term does not refer to an event 
which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.

The term significant disability should be viewed as any situation whereby [CONTACT_96951] a clinically 
important effect on the subject’s physical or psychological well-being to the extent that the subject 
is unable to function normally.
-Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect
-Is a medically significant adverse event
This criterion allows for any situations in which important adverse events/reactions that are not 
immediately life-threatening or do not result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96858]’s 
health or may require intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes.
Examples of such events are: intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse.
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an event is serious 
because medically significant.  Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious 
agent is also considered a serious adverse reaction.
A Non-Serious Adverse Event/Non-Serious Adverse Drug Reaction is an adverse event or 
adverse drug reaction that does not meet the criteria listed above for a serious adverse event/serious 
adverse drug reaction.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 61/78Reports which add significant information on specificity or severity of a known, already 
documented serious adverse drug reaction constitute unexpected events. For example, an event 
more specific or more severe than described in the Investigator’s Brochure would be considered as 
“unexpected”. Examples of such events are: (a) acute renal failure as a labeled ADR with a 
subsequent new report of interstitial nephritis and (b) hepatitis with a first report of fulminant 
hepatitis.  In the event an exacerbation is interpreted as due to lack of efficacy, it should not be 
classified as drug related.

Mild:  The event causes a minor discomfort, or does not interfere with daily activity of the 
subject, or does not lead to either modification of test treatment dosage or establishment of a 
correcting treatment.
Moderate: The event perturbs the usual activity of the subject and is of a sufficient severity 
to make the subject uncomfortable. The event leads to a diminution of dosage of the test 
treatment, or a temporary interruption of its administration or to the establishment of a 
correcting treatment.
Severe:  The event prevents any usual routine activity of the subject and causes severe 
discomfort. It may be of such severity to cause the definitive interruption of test treatment.
10.4 Causality Assessment
The following “binary” decision choice will be used by [CONTACT_96952]:
Reasonable possibility of a relatedness
No reasonable possibility of relatedness
The expression “reasonable possibility of relatedness” is meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments meant to suggest a causal relationship.
The Investigator will be asked to consider the following before reaching a decision on causality 
assessment:
Time relationship between study drug intake and event’s onset;
Dechallenge (did the event abate after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21395])?;
Rechallenge (did the event reappear after reintroduction)?;
Medical history;
Study drug(s);
Mechanism of action of the study drug;
Class effects;
Other treatments-concomitant or previous;
Withdrawal of study drug(s);
Lack of efficacy/worsening of existing condition;
Erroneous treatment with study drug (or concomitant);
Protocol related process.

IND No.: IND 133679 Date: 05Jun2018
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 63/78For pharmacovigilance purposes, all SAEs should be followed-up in order to elucidate as 
completely and practically as possible their nature and/or causality until resolution of all queries, 
clinical recovery is complete, laboratory results have returned to normal, stable condition is reached 
or until the subject is lost to follow-up. Follow-up may therefore continue after the subject has left 
the study. In this case, the follow-up will continue with no timelines for related SAEs, while for 
unrelated SAEs the type and extent of follow-up undertaken will be determined for each individual 
case and will depend upon the nature (e.g. events with poor prognosis or which do not resolve), 
severity and medical significance of the event.
10.[ADDRESS_888228]
Global Pharmacovigilance, Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A
Reporting of SAEs from the investigator site is from the time of subject’s signature [CONTACT_653625]’s study participation ends. After this date, even if no 
active monitoring of subjects is required, SAEs occurring to a subject should be reported if 
the investigator becomes aware of them.
Up to the closure of the site, SAE reports should be reported to the  Safety 
Contact. New serious adverse event occurring after the site is closed should be reported 
directly to the Chiesi Safety Contact.
10.10 Reporting Serious Adverse Events to Regulatory Authorities/Ethics Committees/IRB
The Sponsor or designated CRO will report adverse events to the regulatory authorities in 
compliance with the timelines and standards of reporting according to local regulations (Guidance 
for industry and Investigators-Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE studies, 
December 2012). All suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs), which occur with 
the investigational medicinal product or marketed active comparator, within or outside the 
concerned clinical trial, will be reported by [CONTACT_96954], as required, as well as to the Investigators and Central IRB, if applicable, by 
[CONTACT_96955]/CIOMS form. The Investigator (or Sponsor/CRO where required) must inform the IRB 
per Sponsor instruction upon receipt of the S[LOCATION_003]R notification. An IND and/or NDA Safety 
Report will be submitted to regulatory authorities unblinded. Participating Investigators and IRB 
will receive a blinded IND Safety Report, unless otherwise specified.
With regard to regulations in force for Pharmacovigilance, the Investigator must fulfil his/her 
obligation according to the law in force.

IND No.: IND 133679 Date: 05Jun2018
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 64/7810.11 General Notes
In case of death, a comprehensive narrative report of the case should be prepared by [CONTACT_96956] /Chiesi Safety Contact [CONTACT_96957], retaining a copy on site. 
If an autopsy is performed, copy of the autopsy report should be actively sought by [CONTACT_96956] /Chiesi Safety Contact [CONTACT_96958], 
retaining a copy on site.
In case of pregnancy, the subject will be immediately withdrawn from the study and she will 
be followed with due diligence until the outcome of the pregnancy is known. The pregnancy 
must be reported by [CONTACT_19452] 24 hours by [CONTACT_6791]/e-mail/via Monitor to the 
/Chiesi Safety Contact [CONTACT_96959]. The 
 Safety Contact [CONTACT_96960]. 
The first two pages of the Pregnancy Report Form should be completed by [CONTACT_96961] /Chiesi Safety Contact. The 
third page will be completed as soon as the investigator has knowledge of the pregnancy 
outcome, together with a follow-up of the first two pages, if necessary (e.g. an update in the 
medications received during pregnancy by [CONTACT_23169]). If it meets the criteria for immediate 
classification of a SAE (e.g. spontaneous or therapeutic abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, 
congenital anomaly, birth defect) the Investigator should follow the procedure for reporting 
SAEs. 
If it is the partner, rather than the subject, who is found to be pregnant, the same procedure 
regarding pregnancy reporting is to be followed and the Pregnancy Report Form should be 
completed. 
If the pregnancy is discovered before taking any dose either of study drug or of the run-in ICS 
/rescue medication, the pregnancy does not need to be reported; it is only required that the 
subject is immediately withdrawn from the study.
11. DATA MANAGEMENT
An electronic CRF (eCRF) will be filled-in by [CONTACT_11219]/or his/her designee. 
All subjects who sign the informed consent will be entered into the database. For subjects who are 
screened but not randomized, a minimum set of information is required: date of informed consent 
signed, demography, assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria when applicable, primary reason for 
not continuing, prior medications, adverse events and concomitant medications, if any.
Subject’s questionnaire (ACQ) answers will be databased.
Front-end edit checks will run at the time of data collection and back-end edit checks will be used 
by [CONTACT_653618]. 
Medical history, Concomitant Procedures and Adverse Events will be coded using the MedDRA 
dictionary; medications will be coded using the WHO Drug dictionary and Anatomical Therapeutic 
Chemical classification (ATC).
External data (IRT, Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], e-diary, Laboratory) will be processed centrally and reconciled 
against data recorded in the eCRF as part of cleaning activities.  After cleaning of data, a review

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 65/78meeting will be held to determine the occurrence of any protocol violation and to define the subject 
populations for the analysis. Once the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, it 
will be locked, the randomization codes will be opened and the planned statistical analysis will be 
performed. Only authorised and well-documented updates to the study data are possible after 
database lock. 
At the study conclusion, a complete copy of the study data will be created for archival purposes at 
Chiesi. The investigators will receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_96859].
12. STATISTICAL METHODS
12.1 Sample Size
The sample size has been calculated to evaluate the superiority of CHF 718 pMDI at different doses 
over placebo in terms of change from baseline in pre-dose morning FEV 1 at Week 8.
A total of 495 evaluable subjects (99 per group) will provide 80% power to detect a mean 
difference of 200mL between each dose of CHF [ADDRESS_888229] deviation of 430mL.
Since three dose levels will be tested, the Edwards and Berry method will be used to control the 
family-wise Type I error rate at the 0.05 (two-sided) level. In the sample size calculation, the 
Bonferroni adjustment of the significance level has been taken into account (0.0167 = 0.05/3). This 
will ensure the required power for each test, since the Edwards and Berry method is uniformly more 
powerful than the Bonferroni procedure.
Considering a non-evaluable rate of 15%, a total of approximately 585 subjects (117 per group) will 
be randomized.
12.2 Populations for analysis
Safety population: all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug.
Intention-to-Treat population (ITT): all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of 
the study drug and with at least one available evaluation of efficacy (primary or secondary 
efficacy variables) after the baseline.
Per-protocol population (PP): all subjects from the ITT population without any major 
protocol deviation (i.e., wrong inclusions, poor compliance, non-permitted medications). Exact 
definition of major protocol deviations will be discussed by [CONTACT_96963].
Since the superiority of CHF 718 pMDI at different doses over placebo will be tested, the primary 
efficacy analysis will be based on the ITT population. The primary efficacy analysis will be also 
performed on the PP population for sensitivity purposes. 
The secondary efficacy variables will be analysed in the ITT population.
The safety variables will be analysed in the Safety population. 
In case of deviation between randomized treatment and treatment actually received, the treatment 
actually received will be used in the safety analyses (i.e. an as-treated analysis will be performed).

IND No.: IND 133679 Date: 05Jun2018
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 66/7812.3 Statistical analysis
A detailed statistical analysis plan will be described in a separate document. The plan might be 
reviewed and updated as a result of the blind review of the data and will be finalized before 
breaking the blind. 
12.3.1 Descriptive Statistics 
Descriptive statistics will be provided in summary tables by [CONTACT_653619].
Descriptive statistics for quantitative variables will include n (the number of non-missing values), 
mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum values. 
Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_96964].
12.3.2 Missing data
For the primary efficacy analysis, a linear mixed model for repeated measures will be used to 
handle missing data. Under the Missing At Random (MAR) assumption, this model provides an 
unbiased estimate of the treatment effect that would have been observed if all subjects had 
continued on treatment for the full study duration. This approach addresses efficacy (or de jure) 
hypotheses, estimating the causal effects of the initially randomized drug if taken as directed 
(in contrast with effectiveness, or de facto, hypotheses, evaluating the effect of the drug as 
actually taken).[77] The efficacy estimand is considered appropriate in the context of a phase II 
study aiming at characterising dose-response.[78][79][80]
If one of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_96860] 45 min and 15 min pre-dose is not available, then the 
non-missing measurement will be taken as the pre-dose value. If no measurement is available, 
then the pre-dose value will be considered as missing.
A minimum of 7 days with available measurements will be required for each inter-visit period 
(including run-in period) to consider the following variables as non-missing: average use of 
rescue medication, percentage of rescue medication-free days, daily asthma symptoms, and 
percentage of asthma symptom-free days, percentage of asthma control days, morning and 
evening PEF.
For ACQ-[ADDRESS_888230] demographics and baseline characteristics
The following variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_325549] (and on the 
Safety or PP populations, if relevant): demographic characteristics, medical history and concomitant 
diseases, previous and concomitant medications, efficacy and safety parameters at screening and/or 
at baseline.

IND No.: IND 133679 Date: 05Jun2018
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 67/7812.3.4 Primary efficacy variables
Change from baseline in pre-dose morning FEV 1 will be analysed using a linear mixed model for 
repeated measurements including treatment, visit, treatment by [CONTACT_23259], ICS dose before 
study (low/medium daily dose) and US regions as fixed effects, and the baseline value (average of 
the pre-dose FEV 1 measurements at Visit 2) and baseline by [CONTACT_487463]. An 
unstructured covariance matrix will be assumed. 
The adjusted means in each treatment group, the adjusted mean difference between treatments and 
their 95% two-sided Confidence Intervals (CIs) at Week 8 will be estimated by [CONTACT_10994]. The CIs 
and the p-values of the comparisons between each dose of CHF 718 pMDI and placebo at Week 8 
will be adjusted for multiplicity. The adjustment will be based on the parametric simulation method 
by [CONTACT_96886].[81] At each dose level, the superiority of CHF 718 pMDI over placebo will 
be demonstrated by a statistically significant difference (adjusted p-value < 0.05) favoring CHF 718 
pMDI.
All the other comparisons between treatments will be performed as secondary efficacy analyses 
with no multiplicity adjustment.
12.3.5 Secondary efficacy variables
No multiplicity adjustment will be performed in the secondary efficacy analyses.
For change from baseline in pre-dose morning FEV 1 at Week 4, the adjusted means in each 
treatment group and the adjusted mean differences between treatments at Week 4 will be 
estimated with their 95% CIs and p-values by [CONTACT_653594]. 
Change from baseline in pre-dose morning FVC at Week 4 and Week 8 will be analysed using 
a similar model as the one used for the primary efficacy analysis. 
Change from baseline in ACQ-7 score at Week 4 and Week 8 will be analysed using a similar 
model as the one used for the primary efficacy analysis.
Change from baseline to each inter-visit period in average use of rescue medication, in 
percentage of rescue medication-free days, in daily asthma symptoms scores, in percentage of 
asthma symptoms-free days, in percentage of asthma control days and in morning and evening 
pre-dose PEF will be analysed using a similar model as the one used for the primary efficacy 
analysis. The inter-visit period will be considered instead of visit in the model. Comparison 
between treatments over the entire treatment period will also be derived from this model.
12.3.[ADDRESS_888231] study drug intake will be classified as 
Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs). Any adverse event started after the informed 
consent signature [CONTACT_96988]-treatment 
adverse event. Pre-treatment adverse events will be listed only.

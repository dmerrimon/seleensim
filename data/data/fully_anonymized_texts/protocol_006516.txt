Multiplicity Considerations:  
To control for mul tiplicity among primary and secondary endpoints, endpoints will be tested in 
a fixed sequence  at a study -wide two-sided alpha level of 0.05. The primary and secondary 
endpoints will be tested in the fixed testing sequence as follows : 
Primary Endpoint:  
1. Schirmer’s Test overall mean change from baseline (CFB)  before and after the fourth 
dose on Day  1  
2. Schirmer’s Test greater than or equal to 10mm responder analysis of change from 
baseline before and after the fourth dose on Day 1  
Secondary Endpoints:  
3. Overall mean CFB  of Conjunctival Redness over 90 minutes in the CAE  at Day 2  
4. Overall mean CFB of Eye Dryness (VAS; Visual Analog Scale)  over 90 minutes in the 
CAE at Day 2  
5. Overall mean CFB of Eye Dryness (VAS) assessed over Days 1 and 2 (excluding

Formal statistical testing of primary and secondary endpoints in the fixed sequence will halt 
upon a P -value greater than or equal to 0.05 . All remaining endpoints in the sequence will be 
considered exploratory.  
No type I error control will be utilized for  exploratory endpoints ; thus, exploratory 
comparisons are considered hypothesis generating.

Confidential   Page 16 of 60 1 INTRODUCTION  
Dry eye  disease (DED)  is the most prevalent form of ocular discomfort and irritation. The 
estimated population of individuals with mild to moderate DED ranges from [ADDRESS_913751] lenses , and internal factors such 
as hormonal imbalance, autoimmune disease, systemic medica tions, anatomical changes , trauma, 
and aging  are also contributors . Symptoms result in a mildly decreased quality of life at a minimum 
and, with increasing severity, loss of function and productivity, pain, light sensitivity, and 
emotional distress . The aging population in the [LOCATION_002] and in other developi[INVESTIGATOR_14696], 
and increasing computer use  will continue to make DED  more prevalent  (Schaumberg et al, 2009) . 
 
Given that there are few  substantive treatment s for DED , various over-the-counter (OTC ) products 
are available to help provide temporary relief for DED and for all of the tear film abnormalities. 
OTC products aim to alleviate symptoms by [CONTACT_675891]. 
Additionally, some artificial tear products contai n demulcents to enhance lubric ation . OTC 
products  provide only short -lived action at best necessitating  frequent dosing throughout the day.

The clin ical hypothes is is that reproxalap  is more effective than vehicle in reducing the signs and 
symptoms of DED.

Early Termination/Discontinuation  
If a subject is discontinued  from the study prior to Visit 3, then all safety evaluations 
that are to be performed at Visit 3 should be performed on the day of 
discontinuation (early termination) or at the discretion of the investigator.   
Adverse Events (both elicited and observed) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will 
be monitored throughout the trial.  The investigator will promptly review a ll 
adverse events (both elicited and observed) for accuracy and completeness.  All 
adverse events will be documented on the appropriate source document and case 
report form.  
If a female reports a pregnancy or has a positive pregnancy test during the study 
the investigator will notify  immediately.  The investigator shall request from 
the subject and/or the subject’s physician copi[INVESTIGATOR_675888].  The 
investigator will retain these reports together with the subject’s source documents 
and will provide a copy of all documentation to .  The pregnant subjects w ill be

that is not performed should be indicated as “Not done.”  
Evaluatio ns that may be conducted at an Unscheduled Visit include:  
• Slit-lamp B iomicroscopy ; 
• Visual A cuity ; 
• Intraocular Pressure;  
• Urine Pregnancy Test;  
• Dilated Fundoscopy;

has completed all applicable assessments.  
8.5.2 Discontinued Subjects  
Subjects may be discontinued prior to their completion of the study due to:  
• adverse events  
• protocol violations  
• administrative reasons (e.g., inability to continue)  
• Sponsor termination of study  
• other  
Note: In addition, any subject may be discontinued for an y sound medical 
reason.  
Notification of a subject discontinuation and the reason for discontinuation will 
be made to  and will be clearly documented on the source document.

regulatory requirements.  The review of the subjects’ medical records wil l be 
performed in a manner that adequately maintains subject confidentiality.  Further 
details of the study monitoring will be outlined in a monitoring plan.  
Regulatory authorities of domestic and foreign agencies,  quality assurance and or 
its designee s may carry out on -site inspections and audits which may include source 
data checks. Therefore,  direct access to the original source data will be required for 
inspections and audits.  All inspections and audits will be carried out giving 
consideration to d ata protection as well as subject confidentiality to the extent that 
local, state, and federal laws apply.  
[ADDRESS_913770]’s signing of the informed consent  until they are exited from 
the trial. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, 
symptom, or disease occurring after the subject started the clinical trial , without any 
judgment about ca usality. Any pre -existing medical condition that worsens during the 
trial will also be considered a new adverse event . Documentation r egarding the adverse 
event should be made as to the nature, date of onset, end date, severity, relationship to 
study proce dure, expectedness, action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome of any sign 
or symptom observed by [CONTACT_253785].  
9.1.1 Severity  
Severity of an adverse event is defined as a qualitative assessment of the deg ree 
of intensity of an adverse event as determined by [CONTACT_253786]/her by [CONTACT_102]/subject. The assessment of severity is made irrespective 
of relationship to study procedures or seriousness of the event and should be 
evaluated ac cording to the following scale:

Confidential   Page 31 of 60   
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
9.1.2 Relationship to Study Procedures  
The relationship of each AE to the study procedures  should be determined by 
[CONTACT_675893]. Decisive factors for the assessment of 
causal relationship of an AE to the study procedures  include, but may not be 
limited to, temporal relationship between the AE and the procedure , known side 
effects of the procedure  medi cal history, and/or concomitant medication:  
• Definite:  When there are good reason and sufficient documentation to 
demonstrate a direct causal relationship between study procedure  and 
AE; 
• Probable:  When there are good reasons and sufficient documentation to 
assume a causal relationship in the sense of plausible, conceivable, 
likely but not necessarily highly probable.  
• Possible:  When there is sufficient information to accept the possibility 
of a causal relationship in the sense of not impossible and not unlike ly, 
although the connection is uncertain or doubtful, for example; due to 
missing data or insufficient evidence.  
• None: When there is sufficient information to accept a lack of a causal 
relationship, in the sense of impossible and improbable.  
• Unclassified:  When the causal relationship is not assessable for 
whatever reason due to insufficient evidence, conflicting data or poor 
documentation.  
9.1.3 Expectedness  
The expectedness of an adverse event should be determined based upon existing 
safety information about the  study procedures . Therefore,  the following 
definition will be used:

available for the study procedure  at the specificity or severity that has 
been observed.  
• Expected : An adverse eve nt that is listed in the safety information 
available for the study procedure at the specificity and severity that has 
been observed.  
• Not Applicable : Any adverse event that is unrelated to the study 
procedure . 
9.2 Serious Adverse Events  
An adverse event is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or 
Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death;  
• A life -threatening adverse event;  
o Note: An adverse event is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view 
of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or 
subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event 
that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29350];  
o Note: The term “inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any inpatient 
admission (even if less than 24 hours). For chronic or long -term 
inpatients, inpatient admission includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47496]/intensive ca re inpatient unit. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_253776]: emergency room visits; outpatient/same -day/ambulatory 
procedures; observation/short stay units; rehabilitation facilities; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593]; nursing homes; or clinical research/phase 1 units.  
o Note: The term “prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any 
extension of an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_514542].  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions;  
o Note: A serious adverse event specifically related to visual threat would 
be interpreted as any potential impairment or damage to the subject’s 
eyes (e.g., hemorrhage, retinal detachment, central corneal ulcer or 
damage to the optic nerve).

10.1 Analysis Populations  
 The following analysis populations will be considered:  
• Intent -to-Treat Population  – The intent -to-treat (ITT) population includes all 
randomized subjects. Subjects in the ITT population will be analyzed as randomized.  
 
• Per-Protocol Population  – The per -protocol (PP) population includes subjects in the 
ITT population who do not have sig nificant protocol deviations and who complete the 
study. Protocol deviations will be assessed prior to database lock and unmasking. 
Subjects in the PP population will be analyzed as treated.  
 
• Safety Population  – The safety population includes all randomize d subjects who have 
received at least one dose of the investigational product. Subjects in the safety 
population will be analyzed as treated.

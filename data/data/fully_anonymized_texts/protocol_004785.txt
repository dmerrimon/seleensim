Protocol Number:  C3J16 -S205 -00  
Protocol Title:  A Phase 2, Single -blind, Randomized, Placebo -controlled Study to 
Evaluate the Microbiology , Safety and Tolerability of C16G2 Strip 
Administered in Multiple Doses to Adolescent and Adult Dental Subjects  
Study Design:  A single -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, phase [ADDRESS_295046] study drug 
administration.  
Clinic visits include Visit 1 (Screening/Days -30 to -1), Visit 2 
(Prophylaxis/Day -7 to -2), Eligibility Confirmation & Baseli ne Visit 3, 
Follow -up Visits 4 -7 (Safety and Microbiology), Visits 8 -17 (Study Drug 
Administration), Follow -up Visits 18 -20 (Safety and Microbiology)  and 
Follow -up Visits 21 -22 (Microbiology only).   
Subjects enrolled in all  study arms will be assessed for safety and 
microbiology parameters. For details on study schedules including dosing 
and microbiology information refer to Appendix  A. Details on study 
assessments & procedures for all study arms are provided in Appendix B. 
For microbiology assessments in all study arms refer to Appendix C.  
Objectives:  
 Primary Objective s 
 To assess the targeted antimicrobial activity of C16G2 Strip 
administration as measured by a reduction in  Streptococcus 
mutans  in saliva and dental plaque  
 To assess total bacteria in saliva and dental plaque post study drug 
administration  
Secondary Objective  
 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple C16G2 Strip 
administration s in adolescent and adult dental subjects  
Subject Population:  Approximately 30 male and female subjects 12 -75 years of age, inclusive 
at the time the Informed Consent Form or Assent is signed.  
Protocol No. C3J16-S205- 00                January 25, 2017 Page 8 of 75  
 
CONFIDENTIAL Duration of Study:  Estimated duration of study from first subject in (FSI) to last subject out 
(LSO) is approximately 3.[ADDRESS_295047]’s duration of 
participation will be 2.5 months.  
Study Arms / 
Treatment / 
Randomization  The study will enroll subjects into three study arms. Approximately 
30 subjects will receive three doses of study drug (9.2 mg, 18.4 mg, 
36.8 mg C16G2 Strip or Placebo) , for details see Table below . Subjects 
who do not return for assessments after study drug administration for any 
reason may be replaced at the Sponsor’s discretion.  
Study subjects will be randomized to receive C16G2 or Placebo  Strip, in a 
4:1 allocation ratio ( 8 C16G2 Strip subjects: 2 Placebo Strip subjects) for 
each of the three study arms. Subjects will be enrolled in to one of the three 
study arms and the arms will enroll sequentially. Each study arm will be 
fully enrolled ( i.e., the last subject in an arm has completed Visit 3) before 
enrollment is initiated in the next study arm.  
After confirmation of study eligibility, subjects will be randomized at Visit 3 
(Day 0) by [CONTACT_243227]’s study statistician. The randomization 
schedule and associated documentation will be kept in a secure location.

Blinding/Unblinding  The study will be conducted in a single -blind, placebo -controlled manner. 
All study subjects will be blinded to the treatment assignment, while the 
Investigator, study staff/clinicians and the Sponsor’s assigned team 
members (e.g., the Clinical Monitor and  the Medical Monitor) will be 
unblinded as to whether subjects are receiving C16G2 or Placebo.  
Microbiology:  All stimulated saliva and dental plaque samples obtained in this study will 
be tested for S. mutans  using mitis-salivarius bacitracin ( MSB) agar plating 
and total bacteria testing using Todd Hewitt (TH) agar plating. Samples will 
be stored for S. mutans and total bacteria  testing using quantitative Real -
Time Polymerase Chain Reaction  (qRT -PCR) and  bacterial community 
analysis.  
At the scre ening visit, only stimulated saliva samples will be collected and 
tested for S. mutans  Colony Forming Units (CFUs) to determine the 
inclusion criterion of ≥ 1 x 105 CFU/mL at Screening using MSB agar 
plating. At all other visits both stimulated saliva and dental plaque samples 
will be obtained for microbiology assessments. Samples will be collected at

collection of adverse events during study visits and unscheduled telephone 
contacts.  
Subjects will be instructed to inform the Investigator and /or a member of 
the study staff of any adverse events that occur at any time during the 
study. Subjects will be asked a general health question at each clinic visit 
up to and including Visit [ADDRESS_295057] administration of study drug. 
After that time point, all ongoing adverse events will be followed in 
accordance with good medical practice until resolution or the condition has 
stabilized.  
Statistical Methods:  
 Sample Size:  
The total number of subjects planned for this study is 30. There are no 
data on which to base formal sample size calculations for this study. The 
data generated in this study will assist with ongoing clinical development of 
C16G2 Strip. Subjects’ data in the three  study arms will provide information 
on the safety and microbiology of multiple administratio ns of C16G2 Strip 
or Placebo. Subjects may be replaced at the Sponsor’s discretion.  
Data Analysis:  
Analysis Sets: There will be two analysis sets; the safety analysis set and 
the microbiology analysis set

 INTRODUCTION 
Dental caries is a chronic disease of microbiological origin that affects populations worldwide . 
Caries arises from an imbalance in the indigenous microflora of the oral cavity: upon intake of 
dietary sugars (primarily sucrose), aciduric microbes produce lactic acid that damages tooth 
structure and enables these pathogenic bacteria to become dominant in the multispecies 
biofilms found on the tooth surface (known as dental plaque) . The bacterium Streptococcus 
mutans ( S. mutans)  has been implicated in a wide body of historical and contemporary clinical 
and nonclinical data as being the major etiological agent responsible for the majority of caries 
(Loesche 1986; Tanzer, Livingston et al . 2001; Marsh 2006; Marsh 2010) . Furthermore, in 
studies examining the endpoint, caries-free individuals were found to have lower S. mutans  
compared with caries-active subjects. 
Controlling caries by [CONTACT_243235], in theory, reduce caries incidence; however, there is no 
clinical evidence supporting the long-term prevention of S. mutans  re-infection and very few 
studies examining the impact on caries reduction (Tong, Dong et al . 2010; Vollmer, Papas et al . 
2010; Young, Lyon et al . 2010) . The reason for lack of long-term cavity protection is the 
persistence of S. mutans  within the dental plaque and the dynamic balance of the biofilm 
community between a healthy state and cariogenic state . There is a need to develop a specific 
antimicrobial therapy that can substantially reduce or eliminate the primary agent of dental 
caries, S. mutans , from the oral biofilm while leaving the remaining organisms intact . If this can 
be achieved, a healthy biofilm may be established that provides long-term caries protection. 
In response to the need for a focused S. mutans  reduction , a series of novel synthetic 
molecules were designed and evaluated in vitro  (Eckert, R., He J., et al., 2006; Kaplan, C . W., 
Sim, J.H., et al., 2011; Li, L . N., Guo, L . H., et al, 2010) . The C16G2 antimicrobial peptide was 
shown to specifically kill S. mutans , and not other oral streptococci, in both planktonic and 
saliva-derived biofilm systems . Additionally, intact S. mutans -free biofilms created by a C16G2 
intervention were resistant to colonization from exogenous S. mutans  (Li, L . N., Guo, L . H., et al, 
2010; Guo, L., McLean, J.S., et al, 2015). 
Previous studies evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics and microbiology of single and multiple 
C16G2 doses formulated as a mouth rinse , gel and varnish. In Study C3J16-S205- 00 subjects 
will receive multiple C16G2 or Placebo strip administrations to evaluate the safety and 
microbiology of this mode of application. 
1.1 Previous Clinical Experience 
1.1.1 Phase 1 
Study C3J11- 101-01, a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation 
study was conducted at a single study center in the US . A total of 36 healthy adult subjects were 
enrolled, of which 24 subjects received C16G2, and 12 subjects received placebo . C16G2 was 
administered in a mouth rinse formulation as a single dose of three concentrations (4 mg [50 
µM], 8 mg [100 µM] and 32 mg [400 µM]) by [CONTACT_243236] [ADDRESS_295059] was discontinued due to an 
AE. No clinically significant changes in vital signs were observed in association with the 
administration of C16G2 . Mean values for systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse 
showed only small fluctuations from baseline over the entire treatment period, and values were 
similar for the C16G2 dose cohorts and the placebo cohort . No clinically significant findings in 
the oral cavity were attributable to C16G2 administration and no clinically significant targeted 
physical exam and electrocardiogram (ECG) findings were reported . In addition, no clinically 
significant out- of-range clinical laboratory findings were observed . Immunogenicity assessments 
demonstrated that single dose C16G2 administrations up to a dose of [ADDRESS_295060] C16G2. 
C16G2 could not be detected above the lower level of quantitation (LLOQ 10 ng/mL) in any 
pharmacokinetic (PK) sample, with a single exception, which tested just above the LLOQ and 
was most likely the result of high background signal near the LLOQ . This suggests that there is 
minimal or no systemic absorption of C16G2 into the circulation after a single C16G2 
administration up to a dose of [ADDRESS_295061] for both mouth rinse and gel application . C3J13- 201-01, a double-
blind, placebo-controlled study, evaluated different combinations of multiple C16G2 Gel and/or 
C16G2 mouth rinse administrations at two dose levels . To determine the most effective mode of 
gel application, gel was applied by [CONTACT_243237], SonicareTM toothbrush and upper and 
lower custom dental trays. 
A total of [ADDRESS_295062] study drug 
administration. The C16G2 concentrations were 3.2 mg/mL (800 µM) in gel formulation and 1.6 
mg/mL (400 µM) in liquid formulation. 
C16G2 was well-tolerated with no deaths and no other serious or severe adverse events (AEs) . 
A total of 43 TEAEs were reported, 38 AEs in 19 subjects receiving C16G2, 5 AEs in 3 subjects 
r
eceiving placebo . The majority of AEs were deemed mild in severity and unrelated to study 
drug administration and study procedures . In Study Arm 3, in which subjects received gel 
administrations with a SonicareTM toothbrush, followed by a single rinse, the number of subjects 
with one or more AEs and the number of AEs was greater compared to the other three study 
arms . Since the majority of these AEs were mild irritation related to the oral cavity, use of the 
SonicareTM toothbrush for longer than recommended by [CONTACT_3455] (four minutes versus 
two) and the rinsing schedule are possible procedure-related explanations. 
Two subjects discontinued from the study due to adverse events . The first subject, a [ADDRESS_295063], a 22 year old Caucasian female enrolled in Study Arm 4, developed tonsillitis 
and pyrexia at the end of the treatment period (subject completed 5 of 7 study drug 
administration days) . Both AEs were assessed as moderate in severity and unrelated to study 
drug administration and study procedures by [CONTACT_243238] 5 days. 
Clinically significant findings in the oral cavity and targeted physical exam were reported as 
adverse events . No clinically significant changes in vital signs were observed in association with 
administration of C16G2 . Mean values for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse and 
temperature showed only small fluctuations from baseline over the entire treatment period, and 
values were similar for the four active C16G2 Study Arm groups and combined placebo group. 
The majority of subjects receiving C16G2 via a custom dental tray demonstrated an average 
1 log 10 CFU/mL S. mutans  reduction in saliva [ADDRESS_295064]-treatment . Other modes of application (mouth rinse, gel 
administered via SonicareTM toothbrush) were less effective. 
Protocol No. C3J16-S205- 00                January 25, 2017 Page 21 of 75  
 
CONFIDENTIAL In the open-label study C3J14- 201B -00, subjects received 400 µM and 800 µM C16G2 Gel, 
administered either by [CONTACT_243239] 5 consecutive days (Part A) or via 
manual toothbrush only compared to a combination of manual toothbrush and custom dental 
trays (Part B), with four study drug administrations on the first day of dosing followed by [CONTACT_243240] 6 consecutive days . Results from Part A of the study demonstrated that C16G2 
administered once daily for 5 days via dental trays for up to 4 hours did not suppress S. mutans  
efficiently . Results from Part B of the study showed a 1 log 10 CFU/mL suppression of S. mutans  
when C16G2 was applied via a manual toothbrush and custom dental tray combination and at 
the higher concentration (800 µM). 
Pharmacokinetic data from study C3J14- 201B -00 indicated no detectable systemic levels of 
C16G2 (all samples below the LLOQ of 10 ng/mL) . PK samples were obtained: 1) during and 
after a 4 hour gel tray administration of 3.2 mg/mL C16G2 in gel (C16G2 administered after 
manual brushing with conventional toothpaste without C16G2), and 2) immediately after 3 
manual brushings with C16G2 and one 30 minute tray administration with C16G2 (3.2 mg/mL 
C16G2 in gel). 
Study C3J15- 202-00, a Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
study evaluated the safety and microbiology of C16G2 (gel formulation) in adolescent and adult 
dental subjects. The study evaluated the treatment regimen and schedule previously assessed 
in Study C3J14- 201B -00, Part B and assessed the durability of S. mutans  suppression over a 
longer period of time (up to 4 months compared to 7 days in previous studies), evaluated the 
safety and microbiology of two 7-day study drug administration periods, and compared 2 mL 
(Study Arm 1) versus 4 mL (Study Arm 2) 800 µM C16G2 Gel/Placebo administrations. 
A total of 64 subjects were enrolled into this study, of which 41 were randomized to receive 
active drug. A total of 104 AEs were reported in 36 subjects, with a similar distribution over the 
two study arms and the placebo group (Study Arm 1: 9 subjects; Study Arm 2: 16 subjects; 
placebo group: 11 subjects). AEs related to study drug were reported for 3 subjects receiving 
C16G2 (all in Study Arm 2) and 2 subjects treated with placebo. AEs deemed related to the 
study drug in Study Arm 2 were gingival swelling, oral discomfort, and sensitivity of teeth, all 
assessed as mild in severity. There were no serious adverse experiences (SAEs) or severe 
AEs, no deaths, and no discontinuations due to AEs.   
No clinically significant changes in vital signs were observed in association with administration 
of C16G2. Assessments of the oral cavity and body areas examined as part of the targeted 
physical exams did not reveal any treatment-related safety issues. Thus, the dosing regimens 
and modes of application evaluated in this study were safe in healthy adults and adolescents. 
Results for salivary S. mutans  samples during the first and second study drug administration 
period suggest that either [ADDRESS_295065], yet selective, since there was 
no change in total bacterial levels.  
Study C3J15- 203-00, a Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind and open-label, 
placebo-controlled study, evaluated the safety and microbiology of C16G2 administered in 
multiple oral gel doses to adult and adolescent dental subjects. The study evaluated different 
dosing regimens and different doses of C16G2 and Placebo Gel. There were no significant 
safety findings and the safety profile of C16G2 was consistent with previous studies and 
generally safe in majority of the subjects. Microbiology results did not show a significant durable 
response in reduction of S. mutans in stimulated saliva and dental plaque samples. The clinical 
study report for this study is currently in preparation. 
The ongoing Phase 2 study C3J16-V204- 00 will evaluate the safety and microbiology of C16G2 
varnish administered in multiple doses to adolescent and adult dental subjects in a single-blind, 
randomized, placebo-controlled manner. The study is will enroll approximately 33 subjects into 
3 dose groups (13.6 mg, 27.2 mg , and 54.4 mg C16G2 Varnish or Placebo). Subjects in each 
cohort will receive three doses over one week and will be followed up for safety and 
microbiology for up to [ADDRESS_295066] study drug administration.  
1.1.3 Non-US Pi[INVESTIGATOR_243207] C16G2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_243208] C16G2 mouth rinse 
administrations were conducted in China . These studies demonstrated a safety profile similar to 
the one observed in the US clinical studies . Only one of these three studies showed a short-
term decrease in S. mutans  levels that returned to baseline after 24 hours . For detailed 
information refer to the C16G2 Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.[ADDRESS_295067] to prevent dental caries in adults, adolescents 
and younger children is based on the following: 
 Acid production by  S. mutans is implicated as a major factor in the initiation of dental caries 
and eventual cavitation of the tooth (Tanzer, Livingston et al . 2001) . The selective reduction 
of S. mutans  from within the oral cavity may reduce the likelihood of developi[INVESTIGATOR_243209]-cariogenic oral flora that maintain protective colonization benefits. 
 C16G2, a novel antimicrobial peptide, has demonstrated efficacy and selectivity for 
S. mutans  and not other bacteria. 
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for additional information. 
1.3 Rationale for Selection of Dose & Mode of Application  
In prior clinical trials using C16G2 mouth rinse and gel formulations, C16G2 was administered 
at an 400 µM (1.6 mg/mL) and 800 µM (3.2 mg/mL) dose with a maximum daily exposure of 
115.2 mg resulting in approximately 1 log 10 suppression of S. mutans  while study drug was 
administered . The current study is designed to evaluate a C16G2 strip formulation . The 
proposed doses of C16G2 are 9.2 mg, 18.4 mg, or 36.8 mg of C16G2 applied via 4 tooth strips 
that will extend over molars and bicuspi[INVESTIGATOR_805]. Release of the peptide from the film is achieved 
through mixing of the layer of the tooth strip containing C16G2 with saliva on the tooth surface 
Protocol No. C3J16-S205- 00                January 25, 2017 Page 23 of 75  
 
CONFIDENTIAL resulting in a 4-fold increase in peptide release from the 9.2 to 36.8 mg dose. The strip will be 
hydrated by [CONTACT_243241] C16G2 
from the strip during the treatment period. In this study the tooth strips will remain on the tooth 
surface for a minimum of 30 minutes and during this timeframe it is expected that the majority of 
peptide will be released. An average salivary flow rate of 0.4 mL/min over the course of the 
[ADDRESS_295068] of 0.77, 1.53 and 
3.07 mg/mL C16G2, respectively. The highest concentration of 3.07 mg/mL is similar to a prior 
gel formulation that delivered 3.2 mg/mL in a dental tray. The three proposed doses were 
evaluated and each demonstrated a similar level of selective antimicrobial activity against 
S. mutans in a multispecies in vitro  biofilm assay. Due to the well-known limitations of effective 
penetration into biofilms, the higher concentrations of C16G2 were selected to achieve a greater 
effective concentration beyond the surface of the biofilm.  
The proposed clinical program dose range, as well as the multiple dosing schedule, was not 
selected based on safety issues, but rather based on 1) a reasonable expectation that this dose 
range will cover the bactericidal potential of C16G2, 2) a product profile that targets the highest 
flexibility for C16G2 administration (at home or professional ) and 3) results from prior C16G2 
clinical studies that demonstrated an unremarkable safety profile with no serious or severe 
adverse events assessed as related to study drug administration by [CONTACT_737]. 
The non-clinical toxicity and clinical safety and tolerability profile of orally administered C16G2 
mouth rinse and gel formulations is very benign, which is consistent with the peptide not being 
orally bioavailable . Pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic studies did not detect C16G2 after oral 
administration, either by [CONTACT_243242] . 
Furthermore, in vitro studies in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids show that C16G2 is quickly 
destroyed and undetectable, and thus swallowing of C16G2 is not expected to result in any 
systemic exposure. None of the ingredients in the strip formulation raise safety concerns 
because they are currently used in commercial products .  
A large safety margin exists between the proposed clinical doses and the no observed-adverse-
effect levels (NOAEL) determined after administration of C16G2 to rats and dogs by [CONTACT_243243] [ADDRESS_295069] 150 mg/kg/day in rats 
and at least 50 mg/kg/day in dogs, respectively, which converts to a human equivalent dose 
(HED) of 24 to 28 mg/kg/day. The maximum daily dose proposed in Study C3J16-S205- 00 is 
1.05 mg/kg/day (assuming a [ADDRESS_295070]), which equates to 22.9 to 26.7-fold below the HED 
values at the NOAELs derived from the oral gavage toxicology studies. 
In addition, a study to assess the potential for C16G2 Gel to produce local irritation in the oral 
mucosa of hamsters did not reveal any adverse findings or delays in wound healing following 
daily buccal administration at a concentration of 16 mg/mL for up to [ADDRESS_295071]’s condition has stabilized . The shorter follow-up period 
compared to earlier C16G2 studies is supported by [CONTACT_243244]:  
Protocol No. C3J16-S205- 00                January 25, 2017 Page 24 of 75  
 
CONFIDENTIAL The maximum daily C16G2 exposure in this study will be up to 73.6 mg, (a 36.8 mg strip applied 
twice daily) , in Study Arm 3 . The completed Phase 2 Study C3J13- 201-01 had a maximum daily 
C16G2 exposure of 115.2 mg, and demonstrated an unremarkable safety profile with no serious 
or severe adverse events . In completed C16G2 clinical studies, the majority of adverse events 
reported were mild in severity and assessed by [CONTACT_243245] . In 
addition, all adverse events that were assessed as related to study drug administration were 
assessed as mild in severity. In Study C3J 14-201B -00, one serious adverse event (acute 
abdominal pain – infarcted sigmoid appendix epi[INVESTIGATOR_243210]) was reported and assessed as 
unrelated to study drug by [CONTACT_093]. 
Pharmacokinetic evaluations in two clinical studies demonstrated minimal or no measurable 
systemic absorption of C16G2 . In the Phase [ADDRESS_295072] been the result of high background signal 
near the LLOQ . In a Phase 2 Study (Protocol No . C3J14- 201B -00), C16G2 administered at a 
concentration of 3.2 mg/mL could not be detected above the LLOQ (10 ng/mL) in any 
pharmacokinetic sample after multiple manual brush gel applications and during and after tray 
gel applications . The clinical PK evaluations are consistent with nonclinical data that 
demonstrate a lack of systemic exposure after sublingual, buccal, and oral gavage . After 
parenteral administration of C16G2 to rats and dogs for 28 days, C16G2 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_243211] (t 1/2 = 1.1 to 3.92 hours) . In vitro stability studies performed with C16G2 diluted 
in human saliva indicated degradation occurs within 1 hour (t 1/2 = 18.8 minutes) . Furthermore, in 
vitro studies in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids demonstrated that C16G2 is quickly 
destroyed and undetectable, and thus swallowing of C16G2 is not expected to result in any 
systemic exposure.

CONFIDENTIAL adverse events will be followed in accordance with good medical practice until resolution or the 
adverse event or condition has stabilized. AEs that occur after exposure to study drug will be 
classified as treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs). 
 
All AEs, whether observed by [CONTACT_11219]/or study staff or reported by [CONTACT_423], will 
be entered in the source records and electronic data capture ( EDC ) system. 
 
AEs will be graded according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0 and coded according to Medical Dictionary of 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). 
1.5.3 Vital Signs 
Vital signs (blood pressure [systolic and diastolic], heart rate and temperature) will be obtained 
for safety monitoring at time points specified in Section [ADDRESS_295075] is in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_51115]. 
1.5.4 Oral Cavity Assessments & Targeted Physical Exam 
At the scheduled time points, according to the Schedule of Study Assessments and Procedures 
in Appendix B , investigators will perform a comprehensive oral exam consisting of an evaluation 
of oral hard and soft tissue structures for each subject . Oral hard tissue assessments will be 
performed with a dental mirror on the teeth and bony structures . Oral soft tissues will be 
performed by [CONTACT_243246]’s mouth and pharynx, including lips, tongue, floor of the 
mouth, palate, gingiva, alveolar mucosa, buccal mucosa, oropharynx, tonsils, uvula, and 
salivary glands using palpation techniques and visualization . Targeted extraoral examination of 
the head and neck regions will also be performed by [CONTACT_243247]. 
At Screening and prior to the first study drug administration, any abnormal examination findings 
should be documented and evaluated for clinical significance . If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_684], the findings are not clinically significant and/or do not disqualify a subject from 
participation in the study, this clinical impression should be documented and the findings should 
be adequately described to allow comparison at subsequent visits . If there are questions about 
the clinical significance of any finding(s), a discussion with the Medical Monitor is 
recommended. 
The types of abnormalities that should be recorded include, but may not be limited to, amalgam 
tattoos, bony exostoses, Fordyce granules, and extrinsic tooth stains. 
At the time of study drug administration or post-dose, should an AE be reported, the Investigator 
will determine if an oral hard/soft tissue exam should be performed . All findings will be recorded 
on the respective source document and in the EDC system. 
Any non-clinically significant and clinically significant findings, signs or symptoms that are 
present at Screening and worsen in severity or frequency during or after study drug 
administration, will be recorded as adverse events in the source record and EDC system. 
1.5.[ADDRESS_295076] will be administered for 5 minutes.

Upon arrival at C3 Jian, samples will be inventoried and entered into a database for tracking 
through the analysis process . Saliva samples will then be re-suspended and aliquoted for 
immediate processing for plating . Remaining saliva samples will be aliquoted in sterile labeled 
sample tubes and stored at -80°C for qRT- PCR analysis and/or bacterial community analysis. 
 
Dental plaque and stimulated saliva samples collected at protocol specified time points will be 
analyzed for S. mutans  using mitis-salivarius bacitracin (MSB) agar plates (see Appendix C) . 
Upon arrival at C3 Jian laboratories, plaque and saliva samples will be diluted in microbiology 
growth medium (TH Broth) and plated on MSB agar in triplicate . After anaerobic incubation at 
37°C for 48-[ADDRESS_295081] been 
traditionally isolated from oral cavity samples using MSB agar plates . The antimicrobial activity 
of crystal violet dye, high sucrose content, sodium tellurite and bacitracin effectively prevent the 
growth of all bacteria except for streptococci . Further differentiation of streptococci is

CONFIDENTIAL accomplished by [CONTACT_243249]. S. mutans  grows in large blue colonies with dry 
frosted tops or pale blue gumdrops and can be differentiated from other bacterial colonies. 
 
Upon arrival at C3 Jian laboratories, plaque and saliva samples will be diluted in bacterial 
growth medium (TH Broth) and plated on non-selective media in triplicate at protocol-specified 
time points (see Appendix C) to enumerate total bacteria present in a sample . After anaerobic 
incubation at 37°C for 24-48 hours, all growth on the plates will be quantified by [CONTACT_243250]. 
 
The qRT-PCR method has been successfully used to quantitate bacteria present in the oral 
cavity and their association with disease states, such as dental caries and periodontitis . Dental 
plaque and saliva samples will be used for S. mutans  and total bacteria testing using qRT- PCR . 
Genomic DNA will be extracted from plaque and saliva samples that will be aliquoted and stored 
at -80°C . Bacterial genomic DNA samples will be analyzed by [CONTACT_16641]-PCR for levels of bacteria 
present. 
 
Metagenomic analysis using next-generation sequencing is a powerful tool to compare entire 
microbial communities and evaluate the bacterial community composition in healthy and 
diseased states . Genomic DNA extracted from dental plaque and saliva samples will be 
aliquoted and stored at -80°C for metagenomics analysis by [CONTACT_243251] (see 
Appendix C). 
1.6 Potential Risks to Participants 
Potential risks to subjects participating in this study are as follows: 
 S creening Laboratory Tests   
Venipuncture to obtain blood samples may cause some temporary discomfort . There is a 
minimal risk of surrounding nerve damage or wound infection . Some known risks, although rare, 
that can be associated with blood drawing are pain, burning, local infection, or the development 
of a bruise at the site where the needle is placed to draw the blood. 
 Oral Examinations: 
The oral examination will involve procedures that are routinely performed in dental practice . A 
licensed dentist/hygienist will perform the procedures . The risks from the oral examination 
include minor discomfort or pain during the procedures. 
 Biological Sample Collection: 
Dental plaque, stimulated saliva and urine (females only) will be collected . These collection 
processes confer minimal risk to the subject. 
 
 
Protocol No. C3J16-S205- 00                January 25, 2017 Page 29 of 75  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Radiographs 
Standard radiographs will be taken, unless radiographs that are deemed appropriate for the 
study and taken within [ADDRESS_295082]. 
 Photographs 
Photographs will be taken to evaluate the application of the dental strips on the subject’s molars 
and bicuspi[INVESTIGATOR_243214] . The risks from taking these pi[INVESTIGATOR_243215], and on rare occasions, minor bruising, cracking or bleeding of the lips. 
 C16G2 Administration:  
Phase 1 
 
A total of 36 adult healthy subjects were enrolled, of which 24 subjects received C16G2, and 
12 subjects received placebo . C16G2 was administered in mouth rinse formulation as a single 
dose of three concentrations (4 mg [50 µM], 8 mg [100 µM] and 32 mg [400 µM]) by [CONTACT_243236] 
[ADDRESS_295083] C16G2. 
C16G2 was not detected above the lower level of quantitation (LLOQ 10 ng/mL) in any 
pharmacokinetic sample, with a single exception most likely related to a high background 
signal,, suggesting there is minimal or no systemic absorption of C16G2 into the circulation after 
a single C16G2 administration up to a dose of [ADDRESS_295084] study drug administration . The C16G2 concentrations were 3.2 mg/mL (800 µM) in gel 
formulation and 1.6 mg/mL (400 µM) in liquid formulation. 
C16G2 was well-tolerated with no deaths and no other serious or severe adverse events (AEs) . 
The majority of AEs were deemed mild in severity and unrelated to study drug administration 
and study procedures. Two subjects discontinued from the study due to adverse events; one 
subject experienced a mild rash and pruritus, the other subject moderate tonsillitis and fever . All 
events resolved without sequelae . In the clinical study C3J14- 201B -00, one serious adverse 
event (SAE) was reported (acute abdominal pain – infarcted sigmoid appendix epi[INVESTIGATOR_243216]), and assessed as unrelated to study drug administration by [CONTACT_1275]. 
Protocol No. C3J16-S205- 00                January 25, 2017 Page 30 of 75  
 
CONFIDENTIAL Pharmacokinetic data from study C3J14- 201B -00 indicate no detectable systemic levels of 
C16G2 (all samples below the LLOQ of 10 ng/mL) . PK samples were obtained: 1) during and 
after a 4 hour gel tray administration of 3.2 mg/mL C16G2 in gel (C16G2 administered after 
manual brushing with a conventional toothpaste without C16G2), and 2) immediately after 
3 manual brushings with C16G2 and one 15 minute tray administration with C16G2 (3.2 mg/mL 
C16G2 in gel). 
In an ongoing Study C3J15- 202-00, subjects will receive [ADDRESS_295085] day of dosing followed by [CONTACT_243252] 6 consecutive days . 2 mL or 4 mL of 
800 µM C16G2 Gel or Placebo will be administered via manual toothbrush and custom dental 
trays . The doses, duration of application and schedule of study drug administrations in Study 
C3J15- 202-00 are well supported by [CONTACT_243253] C3J13- 201-01, 
which also administered multiple daily doses of C16G2 for 7 consecutive days, with a maximum 
daily exposure of 115.2 mg C16G2 . The maximum daily exposure in this study will be 51.2 mg, 
which is approximately half of the exposure i n Study C3J13- 201-01. 
In the completed Study C3J15- 203-00, subjects received study drug ranging from a single day 
of dosing to 28 days of daily dosing . The C16G2 concentrations in this study will be 3.2 mg/mL 
(800 µM) and 6.4 mg/mL (1600 µM) . The maximum daily exposure in this study was 102.4 mg, 
which is less than the exposure in Study C3J13-201- 01. 
In an ongoing Study C3J16-V204-00 subjects will receive 13.6 mg, 27.2 mg or 54.4 mg C16G2 
Varnish or Placebo applied to all tooth surfaces. The maximum daily exposure will be 54.4 mg 
which is less than half of the exposure in Study C3J13- 201-01.  
In Study C3J16-S205- 00 subjects will receive study drug on multiple days of dosing . 
A
pproximately 9.2 mg, 18.4 mg, and 36.8 mg C16G2 Strip or Placebo will be applied to molars 
and bicuspi[INVESTIGATOR_805] . The maximum daily exposure in this study will be 73.6 mg, which is less than the 
exposure in Study C3J13- 201-01. 
Potential risks to subjects are minimized in this Phase 2 study by [CONTACT_716]: 
 Study arms will be enrolled in an ascending dose escalation manner (9.2 mg, 18.4 mg, 
and 36.8 mg C16G2 Strip or Placebo) 
 Requirement that all women of child-bearing potential, defined as not surgically sterile or 
at least two (2) years postmenopausal, must agree to use one of the following forms of 
contraception from screening through the last study visit: hormonal (oral, implant, or 
injection) begun >30 days prior to screening; barrier (condom, diaphragm, or cervical 
cap with spermicide); intrauterine device (IUD) . Acceptable contraceptive options may 
also include abstinence, relationship with a same sex partner or partner who has had a 
vasectomy at least six (6) months prior to the screening visit 
 Requirement that women are not lactating or pregnant, as verified by [CONTACT_243254] 
 Requirement for male subjects to use contraception or abstain from sexual activity

 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SAFETY MANAGEMENT  
7.1 Definition of Adverse Events 
An AE is “any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related.” 
For the purposes of this definition, “untoward” means unfavorable, negative, or harmful . Note 
that an AE is any event observed or reported that is associated with the use of the drug, without 
regard to causality. 
Adverse events will be collected and reviewed to evaluate the safety of C16G2 or Placebo Strip. 
All AEs will be recorded from the first exposure to study drug up to [ADDRESS_295103] 
administration of study drug. After that time point, all ongoing adverse events will be followed in 
accordance with good medical practice until resolution or the adverse event or condition has 
stabilized. AEs that occur after exposure to study drug will be classified as treatment-emergent 
AEs (TEAEs). All AEs whether observed by [CONTACT_11219]/or study staff or reported by [CONTACT_1560], will be recorded in the source records and EDC system. 
Medical or dental conditions that are present at or before the administration of study drug that 
manifest with the same intensity or frequency subsequent to administration of study drug will not 
be recorded as AEs . Similarly, signs or symptoms related to a pre-existing disease will not be 
recorded as AEs unless there is an increase in the intensity, frequency or duration of the signs 
or symptoms . These pre-existing events, signs, or symptoms will be entered in the source 
records and EDC system. 
Diagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not be reported as 
AEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be 
reported, if it meets the definition of an AE . For example, an acute appendicitis that begins 
during the AE reporting period should be reported as an AE and the resulting appendectomy 
should be recorded as treatment of the AE. 
7.2 Assessment of Severity (Intensity) of Adverse Events 
The severity or intensity of an AE describes the degree of impact upon the subject and/or the 
need for, and the extent of medical care required to treat the AE. 
Symptoms should be graded as mild, moderate, severe, or life threatening according to the 
grading scale noted in Table 1. Please refer to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0. 
  
Protocol No. C3J16-S205- 00                January 25, 2017 Page 43 of 75  
 
CONFIDENTIAL Table 1 : Adverse Events Intensity Description 
Grade  Description  
Mild (1)  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.  
 
Moderate (2)  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; 
limiting age -appropriate instrumental ADL*.  
 
Severe (3)  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; 
limiting self -care ADL**.  
 
Life Threatening (4)  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated   
 
Activities of Daily Living (ADL) 
 
*Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the 
telephone, managing money, etc. 
**Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden.  
Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE . A severe event is not 
necessarily a serious event . For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantly 
with subject’s usual function), but would not be classified as serious unless it met the criteria for 
an SAE (See Section 7.7). 
7.3 Assessment of Causality (Relationship to Study Drug) 
An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a 
reasonable possibility that the study drug caused or contributed to an AE . The Investigator’s 
assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and non-serious). 
Several factors to consider when assessing the relationship of an event to the study drug: 
 Alternative etiology - Is the event due to the underlying disorder being studied or to 
another known disorder? 
 Known relationship - Has the event been observed before in patients treated with this 
study drug or similar products? 
 Temporal relationship - Is there a reasonable temporal relationship between the time of 
onset of the event and the administration of the study drug? 
 Concomitant medication - Is the event a known side effect of a concomitant medication? 
Protocol No. C3J16-S205- 00                January 25, 2017 Page 44 of 75  
 
CONFIDENTIAL The Investigator will document his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_243221] 2 below. 
Table 2 : Adverse Event Relationships Description 
Relationship  Description  
None  The event can be readily explained by [CONTACT_423]'s underlying medical condition, a 
concomitant therapy or other cause and the Investigator believes no relationship 
exists between the event and study drug . In this case, the Investigator should 
document the condition, concurrent / underlying illness, medication, study 
procedur e or other cause they believe to be the cause of the adverse event.  
Unlikely  The event does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
study drug nor does the event follow a known or expected response pattern to study 
drug and may have another cause . In this case, the Investigator should document 
the condition, concurrent / underlying illness, medication, study procedure or cause 
they believe may have contributed to the adverse event.  
Possible  The subject’s condition, concurrent/un derlying illness, medication, or study 
procedures cannot explain the event, and there is a plausible temporal relationship 
between the event and study drug administration.  
Probable  The temporal relationship between the administration of study drug and the  adverse 
event strongly suggests a relationship, and/or the adverse event cannot be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_5002], concurrent / underlying illness, 
medication, study procedure or other cause, or the adverse event abates with 
discontinuation of study drug, and recurs with re -administration.  
For reporting purposes, AEs assigned a relationship to study drug of “Probable,” and “Possible” 
will be classified as related to study drug . AEs assigned a relationship to study drug of “Unlikely” 
and “None” will be classified as not related to study drug. 
7.4 Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR) and Adverse Reaction (AR) 
Suspected adverse reactions (SARs) are the subset of all AEs for which there is a reasonable 
possibility to conclude that the study drug caused the event . For the purposes of IND safety 
reporting, 'reasonable possibility' means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the study drug and the AE. 
An “adverse reaction” (AR) is any AE caused by a drug . ARs are a subset of all SARs for which 
there is reason to conclude that the study drug caused the event. 
An SAR implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than an AR, which means any AE 
caused by a drug. 
For reporting purposes, AEs assigned a relationship to study drug of “Probable,” and “Possible” 
will be classified as SARs. 
AEs assigned a relationship to study drug of “Unlikely” and “None” will not be classified as 
SARs . 
Protocol No. C3J16-S205- 00                January 25, 2017 Page 45 of 75  
 
CONFIDENTIAL 7.5 Unexpected Adverse Events 
The Investigator's Brochure (IB) provides Investigators with information (clinical and nonclinical) 
about the study drug . The IB includes those AEs for which a causal relationship is suspected or 
confirmed (SARs or ARs), as well as adverse events that may be predicted to occur based on 
the pharmacological properties of the drug . The IB is used as the basis for the Sponsor’s 
determination of “unexpected” for reporting purposes. 
“Unexpected” SARs are AEs not currently listed in the IB . An AE or SAR may also be 
considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the IB at the specificity or severity that has been 
observed. 
7.[ADDRESS_295104] be reported in accordance with the 
reporting requirements defined below. 
7.7 Serious Adverse Events 
7.7.1 Definition o f Serious Adverse Events 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) are  defined as those AEs that meet any of the following criteria: 
 Life threatening, that is, any event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], poses an 
immediate risk of death from that event 
 Results in death  
 Results in or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
 Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions 
 Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Is an important medical event that may require an intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above 
 For clarification, an AE or suspected adverse reaction ( SAR) is “life-threatening”, if, in the 
view of the Investigator or the Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk 
of death . It does not include an AE or SAR that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death 
The Investigator should exercise medical and scientific judgment when deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations not strictly meeting the listed criteria above . Examples 
of important medical events which may meet the definition of an SAE include: intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, certain laboratory 
abnormalities (e.g., blood dyscrasias), convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Pre-planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4355]/or elective surgical procedures may not be considered SAEs. 
Protocol No. C3J16-S205- 00                January 25, 2017 Page 46 of 75  
 
CONFIDENTIAL Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]: 
 Rehabilitation facilities; 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593]; 
 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] (e.g., caregiver relief); 
 Skilled nursing facilities; 
 Nursing homes; 
 Routine emergency room admissions; 
 Scheduled or elective same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory 
procedures). 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4595] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], clinical 
adverse event is not in itself an SAE. Examples include: 
 Admission for treatment of a pre-existing condition not associated with the development 
of a new AE or with a worsening of the pre-existing condition (e.g., for work-up of 
persistent pre-treatment lab abnormality); 
 Social admission (e.g., subject has no place to sleep); 
 Administrative admission (e.g., for yearly physical exam); 
 Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_10244] (e.g., for 
elective cosmetic surgery); 
 Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject. 
Diagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not be reported as 
AEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be 
reported, if it meets the definition of an AE . For example, an acute appendicitis that begins 
during the AE reporting period should be reported as an AE and the resulting appendectomy 
should be recorded as treatment of the AE. 
The Investigator should contact [CONTACT_1034]'s Medical Monitor immediately if there is a question 
as to whether or not an AE meets the criteria for serious. 
7.8 Procedures for Reporting and Recording Serious Adverse Events & Suspected 
Serious Adverse Reactions 
All SAEs, irrespective of relationship to study treatment, must be reported to the Sponsor and 
the Medical Monitor as soon as possible, but no later than 24 hours from the time of notification . 
All AE/SAE information and appropriate supporting documentation must be sent electronically to 
the Medical Monitor & Sponsor.

CONFIDENTIAL Urgent safety issues should be discussed by [CONTACT_243262]. 
It is very important that the SAEs be reported as soon as possible via the EDC and the 
information be filled out as completely as possible at the time of the initial report . This includes 
the Investigator’s assessment of causality . A brief description of the event must be provided at 
the time of the initial report . After the initial SAE report has been submitted, relevant follow- up 
information should be submitted as soon as possible, preferably within one (1) business day of 
receipt . If the follow-up information changes the Investigator’s assessment of causality, this 
should also be added as follow-up information in the EDC system. 
Additional SAE-related supporting documents, such as copi[INVESTIGATOR_243222], lab reports, 
discharge summaries, and autopsy reports, if applicable, may be requested . All subject 
identifiers, except the subject’s initials and unique study identification number, must be removed 
from documents prior to submission to the Medical Monitor and other Sponsor designees . 
Subjects’ names, personal identification numbers (i.e., medical record numbers), and 
addresses, etc., should be removed or blocked-out. 
Reporting of a suspected serious adverse reaction (SSAR) should not be delayed in order to 
obtain additional information . Any additional information, if collected, can be reported as a 
follow-up to the initial report . Any SAE that occurs at any time during the study, whether or not 
related to study drug, must be reported to the Medical Monitor within [ADDRESS_295105] awareness 
at the site. 
The Investigator is responsible for the information recorded on SAE reports . It is the 
Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that the SAE information in the EDC system and source 
documents are accurate, consistent and in agreement . The Investigator is responsible for 
continuing SAE follow- up. The results of any additional assessments of the SAE must be 
reported to the Medical Monitor as an update to the SAE as soon as possible, but no later than 
[ADDRESS_295106]’s condition has 
stabilized.

years postmenopausal, must agree to use one of the following forms of contraception from 
screening through the last study visit: hormonal (oral, implant, or injection) begun >30 days prior 
to screening; barrier (condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap with spermicide); intrauterine device 
(IUD) . Acceptable contraceptive options may also include; abstinence, monogamous 
relationship with same sex partner or partner who has had a vasectomy at least six (6) months 
prior to the screening visit . In the unlikely event a subject becomes pregnant during the study, 
the
 subject will be withdrawn from the study immediately upon confirmation of pregnancy . These 
subjects will be required to return to the study center to undergo early termination procedures 
(Sections 9.3.2 and 9.3.3). 
In addition, any documented pregnancy will be tracked and followed through outcome . While 
pregnancy itself is not considered an AE or an SAE, any pregnancy complications or elective 
termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE and evaluated as a 
possible SAE. 
All pregnancies are to be reported immediately to the Medical Monitor. 
7.10 Management of Medical Emergency (Hypersensitivity)  
If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs during the administration of study drug, the Investigator will 
discontinue the administration of study drug and provide general supportive measures . If an 
adverse event occurs after administration of study drug, the Investigator will provide general 
supportive measures. 
7.11 Management of Dosing Error 
If a dosing error does occur, the Investigator will; 1) monitor the subject, 2) provide general 
supportive measures, as needed, 3) notify the Medical Monitor and the Sponsor within 24 hours, 
and, 4) report the dosing error to the IRB, per site’s policy.

continuous variables, and frequency counts and percent for categorical variables. 
8.2 Randomization 
Subjects will be sequentially assigned to one of three study arms in the order of enrollment . 
Each study arm will be fully enrolled (i.e., the last subject in an arm has completed Visit 3) 
before enrollment is initiated in the next study arm . After confirmation of study eligibility, subjects 
will be randomized at Visit 3 (Day 0) by [CONTACT_243263]’s study statistician . The randomization 
schedule and associated documentation will be kept in a secure location. 
A total of 30 subjects will receive three doses of C16G2 Strip or Placebo. Study subjects will be 
randomized to receive a single dose of study drug, C16G2 Strip or Placebo, in a 4: 1 allocation 
ratio (eight C16G2 Strip subjects: two Placebo subjects) for each of the three study arms . The 
three C16G2 Strip doses planned are 9.2 mg, 18.4 mg and 36.8 mg. 
8.3 Blinding 
The study will be conducted in a single-blind manner . All study subjects will be blinded to the 
treatment assignment, while the Investigator, study staff/clinicians and the Sponsor’s assigned 
team members (e.g., the Clinical Monitor and the Medical Monitor) will be unblinded as to 
whether subjects are receiving C16G2 or Placebo. 
To ensure blinding, study drug (C16G2 Strip or Placebo) will be prepared in an area outside the 
purview of study subjects. 
8.4 Sample Size Determination 
The total number of subjects planned for this study is approximately 24 (n = 8 per arm) . There 
are no data on which to base formal sample size calculations for this study . The data generated 
in this study will assist with ongoing clinical development of C16G2 Strip . Subjects’ data in all 
three study arms will provide information on the safety and microbiology of a single C16G2 Strip

CONFIDENTIAL or Placebo administration . Subjects who do not return for assessments after study drug 
administration for any reason may be replaced at the Sponsor’s discretion. 
8.5 Analysis Sets 
There will be two analysis sets; the safety analysis set and the microbiology analysis set. 
The safety analysis set will be defined as those subjects enrolled and have received any 
amount of C16G2 Strip or Placebo. 
The microbiology analysis set will be comprised of two subsets, the microbiology saliva and 
microbiology dental plaque subset . These subsets will be based on the subjects who received 
study drug (C16G2 Strip or Placebo) and have at least a baseline and one post-baseline saliva 
and dental plaque sample. 
8.6 Interim Safety Analysis 
There are no interim analyses planned; however, microbiology data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_429]’s assigned team in an ongoing manner throughout the course of the study. 
8.7 Statistical Analyses 
8.7.1 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic and baseline characteristics (i.e., age at screening, gender, weight, height, body 
mass index (BMI), race, ethnicity, medical history, physical examination, prior medications) will 
be listed for individual subjects and summarized by [CONTACT_30157] / treatment group using summary 
statistics for continuous variables and frequency distributions for discrete variables. 
8.7.2 Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary 
and will be summarized for each study arm/treatment group by [CONTACT_243264] (WHO ATC) class and medication name . These summaries will present the number 
and percentage of subjects using each medication. 
8.7.3 Completion of the Study and Withdrawals 
Withdrawals and the reason for withdrawal (i.e., AE(s), protocol non-compliance, requirement 
for an unacceptable concomitant medication, lost to follow-up, failed to return, voluntary 
withdrawal, and other reasons) will be listed . The number and percentage of subjects who 
complete the study will be summarized . The number and percentage of subjects who withdraw 
from the study will be tabulated by [CONTACT_30157] / treatment group at time of withdrawal. 
8.7.4 Protocol Deviations 
Protocol deviations will be listed  and categorized (i.e., Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria, 
Randomization, Study Procedures, Missed Study Visit, Visit out of Study Window, Informed 
Consent, Safety Reporting, Study Drug Administration, Study Drug Accountability, and Other) 
and summarized based on these categories.

CONFIDENTIAL 8.7.5 Safety Analysis 
Adverse events (AE) will be classified into standard terminology (preferred term and system 
organ class) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities . The severity of each adverse 
event will be graded as 1) mild, 2) moderate, 3) severe, or 4) life-threatening, according to the 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. 
In addition, all adverse events will be classified as to whether the relationship to study drug was 
1) None, 2) Unlikely, 3) Possible, or 4) Probable and followed to resolution or until the adverse 
event or condition has stabilized. 
The incidence and duration of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be summarize d 
by [CONTACT_30157]/treatment group according to MedDRA-preferred term and MedDRA system organ 
class term . An AE will be considered treatment emergent if the onset date and time occur on or 
after the recorded clock time of study drug administration . Tabulations of adverse events by 
[CONTACT_243265] (related, unrelated) will be provided. 
For reporting purposes, AEs assigned a relationship to study drug of “Possible” and “Probable” 
will be classified as related to study drug . AEs assigned a relationship to study drug of “Unlikely” 
or “None” will be classified as not related to study drug. 
The number and percentage of subjects with reported serious adverse experiences (SAEs) and 
subjects who withdrew due to an AE will be tabulated by [CONTACT_30157]/treatment group. 
All adverse events will be presented in by-subject listings by [CONTACT_243266]-preferred term, MedDRA system organ class, start and stop date and time, study day, 
duration, severity, relationship to study drug, seriousness, and outcome . All reported serious 
adverse events will also be displayed in by-subject listings. 
Oral cavity assessment (hard and soft tissues) findings will be documented at Screening and at 
each protocol-specified study visit. 
Clinically significant examination findings identified at Screening will be added to the subject's 
Medical History. 
After study drug administration clinically significant changes in the oral cavity assessment will be 
recorded as AEs and these TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_30157] / treatment group for each 
of the protocol specified assessments by [CONTACT_243267]. 
Targeted physical examination (general, extraoral, head and neck) findings will be documented 
at Baseline and at each protocol-specified study visit. 
 
Prior to administration of study drug, clinically significant examination findings will be added to 
the subject's Medical History.

CONFIDENTIAL After study drug administration clinically significant changes in the targeted physical 
examination will be recorded as AEs. 
Vital sign results (blood pressure, heart rate and temperature) will be summarized at Visit 1 
(Day -30 to Day -7 ), Visit 3 (Day 0) and Visit 8 (Day 7 /AM) and 17 (Day 11/PM pre- and post-
study drug administration for all study arms by [CONTACT_61187], median, standard 
deviation, and range . Mean change from baseline will also be presented where baseline is 
defined as prior to study drug administration at Visit 3 (Day 0) for each study visit.  
Stimulated saliva and dental plaque samples will be analyzed for the number of S. mutans  and 
total number of bacteria present . Samples will be analyzed by [CONTACT_243268] . 
Samples will be stored for analysis using qRT-PCR and bacterial community analysis. Bacterial 
community analysis and qRT- PCR data will be analyzed at appropriate time points based on 
plating assessments. Descriptive statistics utilizing mean, standard deviation, median and range 
of oral microbes at each time point for each study arm will be determined and compared to 
Baseline, as applicable. 
Further details regarding Microbiology analysis will be presented in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP).

CONFIDENTIAL APPENDIX H : C16G2 AND PLACEBO STRIP APPLICATION PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGING 
Adapted with modifications from www.dentistrytoday.com  
 
Study staff will image the subject’s teeth as follows using the camera provided by [CONTACT_456]   
 
a. Immediately after study drug application (maxillary and mandibular occlusal view 
at Visit 3 only) 
 
NOTE: When using retractors and mirrors for imaging it is important not to disrupt the 
strip application. 
 
Shot No. 1: Maxillary Occlusal View  
For many practitioners the maxillary and mandibular occlusal shots present the most difficulty 
(Figures 1a and 1 b). This photographic image is always taken with both retractors and an 
occlusal mirror . Camera settings are identical to the anterior retracted shot, although patient and 
operator positioning are different and ultimately critical to success . The patient should be 
reclined to approximately 45° and asked to raise his or her chin . The operator should be in front 
of the patient . Cheek retractors should be placed so that the lips can be pulled upward and 
outward; in some cases the medial corners of the cheek retractors will touch at the middle of the 
upper lip. If properly used, the cheek retractors will keep the buccal soft tissue and lips away 
from the teeth, allowing for proper visualization of not only the posterior teeth but the anterior 
teeth as well . Standard cheek retractors or “fork” retractors may be used. 
 
The mirror should be inserted so that the edge extends behind the most posterior tooth . It may 
sometimes rest on the tuberosity as a means of stabilization . Rotate the mirror downward so 
that the back side is touching the lower incisor teeth . In doing so, the operator can help the 
patient “open wide” but also attain the 45° angle needed to properly capture the image. Fogging 
of the mirror can again be a challenge with preventive strategies including warming the mirror, 
gentle bursts of air, or asking the patient to breathe in and hold his or her breath. 
 
The image captured should ideally include all maxillary teeth and allow visualization of incisal 
edges and embrasures . The vertical midline should be the anatomic midline of the patient, and 
the point of focus should be the premolars . In some cases the operator must allow the camera 
to focus on the premolars (e.g . hold the camera shutter button half-way, locking the focus), and 
then recompose the image to achieve better framing . If the center of the palate is used as the 
point of focus, the teeth may appear out of focus because of limited depth of field. 
 
Shot No. 2: Mandibular Occlusal View  
The mandibular occlusal shot is accomplished with the same camera settings, and similar 
positioning of the patient and operator as the maxillary occlusal (Figures 1c to 1 e). The patient 
should be reclined at a minimum of 45°, and should raise the chin as far as possible (neck 
extended maximally) . Standard retractors (or a fork retractor) should always be used to keep 
soft tissue and lips away from the teeth . If standard cheek retractors are used, they should be 
positioned to pull the lips downward and outward . Insert the mirror so that the end rests on soft 
tissue behind the most posterior teeth, making sure that it is not touching the teeth . Rotate the 
mirror upward so that the back of the mirror is resting against the maxillary incisor teeth; the 
image should be taken at approximately 45° to the mirror.

from the teeth . The back of the mirror 
is behind the teeth and resting on 
soft tissue.

CONFIDENTIAL Too often, the patient’s tongue may prevent visualizing all of the mandibular teeth . It is 
sometimes helpful to ask the patient to “lower their tongue” having the patient practice doing so 
in a facial mirror . Other times it may be possible for the patient to move the ir tongue to the 
posterior, or the mirror could be used to hold the tongue out of the way. 
 
The image should be framed so that the vertical midline is the anatomic midline of the patient . 
Like the maxillary occlusal image, ideally all mandibular teeth are visible and the anterior incisal 
edges and embrasures are discernable . The point of focus for the mandibular occlusal shot are 
the premolars . Recomposition may be necessary after focusing as described for the maxillary 
photographic image. 
 
Common errors for the occlusal images include: allowing the end of the mirror to rest on the 
teeth, potentially producing a double image or viewing unreflected teeth; capturing the image at 
less than 45°, which results in unreflected teeth being seen in the image; fogging of the mirror; 
inadequate framing; and obscuring of the teeth by [CONTACT_243285]. 
 
Labelling and Uploading Images 
 
Image Labeling 
Label each of the two images taken with the subject identifier followed by [CONTACT_243286]’s 
number and the time point as follows in the examples below: 
 
For subject #V 102-01-001, Photo [ADDRESS_295137] #V 102-01-001, Photo 2 
S205- 01-001 P2 
 
Image Uploading 
Within the main clinical site folder (e.g. C3J16-S205- 00 Site 01) there is a sub folder for “Strip 
Images” . Create a new folder for each subject within the “Strip Images” folder using the subject 
identifier (e.g. S205- 01-001) . Upload one image for each required photo to this folder . There will 
be a total of [ADDRESS_295138] day of dosing (Visit 3).

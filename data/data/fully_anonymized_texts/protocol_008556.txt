should be questioned about AEs ateach study  visit following randomization .The question 
asked should be,“Since your last clinical visit have you had any health problems?” 
Informat ion on AEs can also be obtained from signs and symptoms detected during each 
examination.  
When an AE is related to a device deficiency  including technical device malfunction, the 
AE should be recorded in the AE eCRF and technical complaint should be reported 
separately  on the study  complaint form.  
Investigators, or other study  site personnel, should record all AEs in the eCRF, including:
a)Event term (recorded in standard medical terminology  and avoiding abbreviations)
b) Description of event and affected ar ea 
c)Start date (first day  with sy mptoms)
d)Stop date (last day  with sy mptoms)
e)Intensit y (mild, moderate, or severe according to definition in Section [IP_ADDRESS])
f)Seriousness (serious or not serious, according to definition in Secti on [IP_ADDRESS])
g)Causal relationship to study  product or study  product injection procedure (y es or no)
h)Action taken (none, medication treatment, non-medication treatment, or other 
procedures/tests, subject withdrawn)
i)Outcome of the AE(ongoing, recovered, recovered with sequelae, death, chronic/ 
stable, not recovered at the end of the stud y)
The pre -defined, expected post-treatment events should be assessed separately . These 
events should be collected by  [CONTACT_132149] a diary  used daily  for 28days after the treatment .
[IP_ADDRESS] Intensity
Intensit y will be recorded for each reported AE. The following definitions of intensity  are to 
be used:
Mild : Awareness of s ymptoms or signs, but easily  tolerated (acceptable )
Moderate: Enough d iscomfort to interfere with usual activity  (disturbing) 
Severe: Incapacity  to work or to do usual activity  (unacceptable) 
If the intensity  changes within one day, the maximum intensity  of the AEduring that day 
should be recorded.

Page 56of [IP_ADDRESS] Causal relationship and seriousness
Each AE, serious as well as non-serious, should be assessed by [CONTACT_132150](the injection procedure) and for seriousness
(Yes or No)of the event . 
A two -point scale (Yes or Noresponse ) should be used for the causalit y assessments . The 
Investigators should be asked to indicate aresponse to each of the following questions in the 
eCRF :
“Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility  that the event may have been 
caused b y the study product ?”,and 
“Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility  that the event may have been 
caused b y the device injection procedure?”
If any of these questions is answered ‘Yes’, the AE is considered related.
Each AEwill also be ass essed for causal relationship and seriousness by  [CONTACT_1034] , in order 
to fulfil regulatory  requirements. 
8.9.[ADDRESS_149232] has been randomized .  
The reporting should contin ue during each follow -up visit (including telephone contacts 
and extra visits between planned visits) until the last scheduled visit in the study .
All AEs, non -serious as well as serious, are to be reported as an AE in the eCRF.
8.9.5 Reporting of serious adver se events
The Investigator should report any  SAE to the Sponsor immediately but not later than 24 
hours of awareness of the event . This initial report can be made via e- mail.
In case of difficult y to obtain all the required information within 24 hours, an initial report 
can be submitted, with the following information as a minimum, irrespective of whether 
some of it is regarded as preliminary :
CTN: 43USCH1702
Subject identification (age, gender, subject number)
Adverse event description
Date when AE occurre d
Date when AE became serious
Name [CONTACT_132165] (if other than the Investigator) 
Name [CONTACT_132166]: Restylane®Defyne (investigational) 
Treatment specification
Follow -up information and data missing in the initial SAE reporting should be gathered as 
soon as possible and reported immediately  but not later than [ADDRESS_149233] be documented by  [CONTACT_132151].

fully  completed SAE form should be kept at the site.
In addition, the Investigator should report SAEs to the responsible IRB without undue 
delay, if applicable according to national regulations.  The Investigator is responsible for 
checking what reporting procedures are applicable for his/her IRB regarding SAEs and 
final report of the outcome of the study  and to comply  with such reporting procedures 
during the study  period . For non-urgent complementary  information not possible to send by

vascular embolic event thatlead to skin necrosis, vison loss, or stroke andis determined by 
[CONTACT_132152].  
The SAE will be investigated b y the Sponsor.  If the Sponsor’s investigation conc ludes:
The SAE was unanticipated, directl y related to the study  product or device injection 
procedure, and presents an unreasonable risk to study  subjects, the study  will be 
terminated and the Investigators notified.  The IRB and RA will also be notified if the 
study  is prematurel y terminated due to safet y concerns.  
If the SAE does not meet the above criteria, then enrollment in the study  will 
continue.

9.Data Handling and Management 
9.1 Data management
Data management based on GCP refers to the activities defined to achieve safe routines to 
enter clinical data information into a database, efficientl y and avoiding errors. The data 
management routine includes procedures for handling eCRFs, database set -up and 
management, data entry  and verification, data validation, and documentation of the 
performed activities including information of discrepancies in the process. The data 
management process will be described in detail in the data management plan (DMP).
The database, the data entry  screens and program will be designed in accordance with the CI P 
and the eCRF. Data validation will be performed by [CONTACT_132155]. Drugs and events will be coded in accordance with World Health Organization 
(WHO) Drug and medical dictionary  for regulatory  activitie s (MedDRA) dictionaries as 
specified in the DMP. SAEs in the clinical database will be reconciled against the data in the 
safet y database.
When all efforts have been made to ensure that the data recorded in the eCRFs and entered in 
the database is as corre ct and complete as possible, the clinical database will be locked. Study  
data will be transferred to SAS datasets which thereafter will be write -protected. Statistical 
analyses will be generated in SAS using data from the locked datasets.

always remain confidential, i.e. the name [CONTACT_132167]. The Investiga tor must verify  that all data entries in the 
eCRFs are accurate and correct. If some assessments are not done, or if certain information 
is not available, not applicable or unknown, the Investigator should indicate this in the 
eCRF. The Investigator should electronicall y sign off the study  data. By [CONTACT_2960], the 
Investigator takes responsibility  for the accuracy , completeness, and legibility  of the data 
reported to the Sponsor in the eCRF . 
9.2.2 The query  process
The monitor should review the eCRFs and evaluate t hem for completeness and consistency . 
Each eCRF should be compared with the respective source documents to ensure that there 
are no discrepancies between critical data. All entries, corrections, and alterations should be 
made by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her authorize ddesignee. The monitor cannot enter data in the eCRFs. 
Once study  data have been submitted to the central server via the eCRF, corrections to the 
data fields will be audit trailed, meaning that the reason for change, the name [CONTACT_132168], together with time and date will be logged. Roles and rights of the 
site personnel responsible for entering study  data into the eCRF should be determined in 
advance. If discrepant data is detected during review of the data, either by  [CONTACT_18484] i ts 
representatives, the responsible data manager or monitor should raise a query  in the 
electronic data capture application. The query  should state the question or data to be 
changed and should be resolved in the sy stem by  [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her authorized designee. The 
appropriate study  site personnel should answer the queries in the eCRF. This will be audit 
trailed by [CONTACT_132156], time, and date is logged .
9.2.3 U seridentification
eCRF records will be automatically  appended with the identification of the creator, by 
[CONTACT_5248]. Specified records should be electronically  signed by [CONTACT_132157]/her review of the data and acknowledgement that the data are 
accurate. This will be facilitated by [CONTACT_132158]’s unique User ID and 
password; date and time stamps will be added automatically  at time of electronic signature.

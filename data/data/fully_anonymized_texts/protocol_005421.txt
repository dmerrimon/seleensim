 Introduction  
This protocol is for the evaluation of the Alinity s Anti-HCV II investigational assay 
using the Alinity s System .  
The A linity s  Anti-HCV II  assay is a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay 
(CMIA) used for the qualitative det ection of antibody to hep atitis C  virus (H CV) in 
human serum and plasma specimens on the Alinity s System.  The Alinity s Anti -HCV II 
assay is intended to screen individual human donors, including volunteer donors of whole 
blood and blood components, and other living donors for the  presence of anti -HCV.   
The performance of the Alinity s Anti -HCV II assay will be evaluated  by [CONTACT_582763] , specificity, and sensitivity testing of the Alinity s Anti -HCV II assay  as 
described in the Testing Procedure section of this protocol . 
The Abbott monitor will provide the Alinity s Anti -HCV II  Reagent Kit Clinical 
Brochure , which contains the relevant referenced literature, applicable technology, and 
summary of any known and potential risks and benefits to humans. Clinical brochures 
will also be provided for the Alinity s Anti -HCV II Calibrator  Kit, the Alinity s Anti -
HCV II Assay Control  Kit, and the Alinity s Anti -HCV II Release Control  Kit. 
This study will be conducted in compliance with this protocol, Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) , and the applicable regulatory requirements.  
 
 Objectives  
The objective  of this study is to demonstrate  the performance and intended use of the 
Alinity s An ti-HCV II  investigational  assay in a donor screening environment using 
clinical samples to evaluate assay performance . The Alinity s Anti -HCV II a ssay 
performance will be evaluated utilizing the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
licensed Alinity s Anti -HCV assay  as the comparator method . The data will be used to 
support regulatory submissions and/or publications.  
 
 Study Design  
A. Overview  
Protocol directed testing will be performed a t a minimum of 3 external clinical  sites to 
evaluate reproducibility , specificity, and sensitivity  of the investigational Alinity s Anti -

minimum of 3 volunteer  blood donor centers and 1 plasmapheresis center. Sensitivity 
specimens and panels will be provided by [CONTACT_69735] . A minimum of 3 lots of Alinity s Anti-
HCV II  investigational assay reagent s, calibrator s, and controls will be used throughout 
the study.  
D000096563  Rev A, Released  - Effective  on: 19-Nov-[ADDRESS_766390] approximately 20  to 60 mL  of blood drawn 
for testing.  
To evaluate sensitivity, Abbott will provide  a minimum of  400 frozen samples from U.S. 
individuals characterized as HCV positive and a minimum of  400 frozen specimens from 
U.S. individuals  at increased risk for HCV  infection . The specimens will be designated by 
[CONTACT_582764] .  
All specimens will be identified using a sample identification number (SID).   
1. Reproducibility  
Abbott will provide reproducibility panel members that will be randomized during 
testing. Reproducibility  will be performed in two runs per day o n each of 5 non-
consecutive days with a minimum of 1 break of 1 day  with a minimum of 3 lots of Alinity 
s Anti -HCV II reagents , calibrators , and controls  at a minimum of 3 clinical sites. 
2. Specimen Testing  
To evaluate specificity for the Alinity s Anti -HCV II assay, t he donor center s will provide 
leftover specimens  from the following:  
 
• Volunteer blood donors  (EDTA plasma or serum)  
• Plasmapheresis donors . 
To evaluate sensitivity for the Alinity s Anti -HCV II assay, Abbott will provide frozen 
preselected anti -HCV positive specimens  from U.S. individuals and specimens from U.S. 
individuals at increased risk for HCV  infection . These specimens  were prospectively 
collected under separate protocols and are not individually identifiable .   
B. Ethics  
The protocol will be reviewed by [CONTACT_4707] (IRB)  as part of study 
oversight.  
The clinical sites will provide leftover specimens that  will be collected as part of the 
routine blood donation process. The blood donor will be informed that the donor center 
may use their donation for research studies. The blood donor will review an IRB -
approved  study  information sheet as part of the consent  process. The information sheet 
D000096563  Rev A, Released  - Effective  on: 19-Nov-[ADDRESS_766391] data. The clinical sites will be blinded 
from knowledge of the specimen categories for specimens provided by [CONTACT_69735]. All 
specimen s obtained prospectively were collected using IRB/IEC  (Independent Ethics 
Committee) -approved specimen collection protocols and informed consent forms that 
comprehend the testing of these specimens as outlined in this protocol. These specimen 
collection studies were either sponsored by [CONTACT_582765]. 
Refer to the Section VI.A.1 Study Population/Sample Size . 
Specimens that are identified as “ leftover ” or “waste” , are not individually identifiable 
and were obtained according to the FDA Guidance on Informed Consent for In Vitro  
Diagnostic Device Studies using Leftover Human Specimens that are not Individually 
Identifiable, April 25, [ADDRESS_766392]’s medical history.  
Until the clinical study is completed, the Investigator will advise their IRB of the progress 
of this clinical study,  per IRB requirements. Written approval must be obtained from the 
IRB annually (or more frequently if required by [CONTACT_1201]) to continue the clinical study, 
according to each institution’s IRB requirements. Further, any change  to the protocol , 
study informat ion sheet , or informed consent form will be submitted to the IRB and 
written  IRB approval  must be  obtained prior to implementation  of change , according to 
each institution’s IRB. 
All reports transferred to and communications with Abbott which pertain to sp ecimens in 
the study must identify each specimen by a  SID to ensure subject confidentiality  and 
documentation . 
C. General Schedule of Events  
The clinical sites will configure and calibrate the investigational Alinity s Anti -HCV II 
assay on the Alinity s System.  
Testing personn el will be required to demonstrate acceptable performance with the 
investigational assay prior to beginning reproducibility  or specimen te sting. The Abbott

Page 7 of 30 evaluation . It is used for training and to confirm  the clinical  site’s ability t o perform the 
assay . 
After succe ssful completion of training , testing  personnel will  perform reproducibility  
and specimen testing using the  investigational  Alinity s Anti -HCV II Reagent  Kit, 
Calibrator  Kit, Assay Control  Kit and Release Control Kit C linical Brochures and the 
procedures as described in this protocol.  
Case Report Forms (CRF s) will be utilized to document completion of the test 
procedures. The Abbott monitor  will review the data and CRF s to assure compliance to 
the study -directed procedures and to monitor the progress of the study.  
The study will take up to approximately 4-5 months  to complete.  
D. Comparator Method  
Each donor specime n and each frozen specimen will be tested using the FDA -licensed 
Alinity s Anti -HCV  assay  as the comparator . Testing will be performed  at a minimum of 
3 clinical site s. Testing will be performed following the Instructions  for Use (IFU) and 
will include retesting, where required.  
The comparator assay results will be compared to the corresponding results of the 
investigational assay.  
E. Supplemental Testing  
HCV  nucleic acid testing (NAT) results for each of the donor specimens will be provided 
to Abbott to further characterize the donor specimens.  
Specimens from donors and U.S. individuals at increased risk f or HCV infection that are 
repeatedly reactive by [CONTACT_582766] s Anti -HCV II a ssay and/or the comparator method will 
be further tested using FDA -licensed  assays or research use only methods. This 
supplemental testing will be  performed either at the clinical site s or at external reference 
laboratories. Resu lts obtained from this testing will be used to better characterize the 
specimen and assess final status.  
The detailed algorithm s for supplemental testing are provided in  Append ix 1 of this 
protocol. Supplemental testing will be performed per the algorithm s and if a specific 
assay is no longer commercially avail able or changes occur in the clinical site  or 
reference laboratory ’s routine procedure, a revised version of the clinical proto col will be 
supplied  to the sites . Additional testing may be performed based on the clinical site’s 
internal supplemental testing procedures.  Data generated will be provided to Abbott a nd 
will be used for informational or investigational purposes.  
Presele cted HCV positive specimens will have documented positive results prior to 
testing at the clinical site s. Suppl emental testing is not required  but may be requested by 
[CONTACT_582767].   
D000096563  Rev A, Released  - Effective  on: 19-Nov-[ADDRESS_766394] will sign a study -specific informed consent form for collection of the 
additional specimen. The follow -up specimen will be tested by [CONTACT_582768] 
s Anti -HCV II assay, the comparator m ethod, and supplemental testing as required . 
The follow -up result will be used to better characterize the initial donation and may be 
used to indicate seroconversion (or rule out seroconversion).  If seroconversion occurs 
and the follow -up results are repe atedly reactive for comparator  assay  and positive on 
supplemental testing, the status for that donor will be considered positive and the index 
sample results will be removed from the specificity calculation.  
In case of a positive result with the investigat ional Alinity s Anti -HCV II assay, each 
clinical site will perform donor management according to their internal procedures.

supplemental testing needed.  
For frozen specimens, Abbott has documentation for collecti on, processing, and storage 
of clinical specimens from the vendors . Frozen specimens will be shipped to the clinical 
sites and must be stored frozen at -20°C or below until tested. All frozen aliquots must be 
handled and stored at the clinical site s as des cribed in the Alinity s Anti -HCV II Reagent 
Kit C linical Brochure. Testing with the investigation al assay will be performed using 
specimens subjected to the same number of freeze/thaw cycles (one thaw cycle)  as the 
comparator method. Sample aliquots used for testing on the comparator method must  be 
handled or processed per the comparator method IFU. If a specimen is thawed and 
refrozen prior to testing or retesting, the occur rence must be documented on an I ncident 
CRF and the Abbott monitor notified.  
The clinical site s must maintain records (e.g., packing slips) of the  delivery and receipt  of 
each shipme nt, as  well as document the condition of the clinical specimens upon arrival 
and the location where the specimens are being stored . Specimen accountability

for validity using the ranges described in the Alinity s Anti-HCV II Assay Control Kit 
Clinical Brochure.  
6. Troubleshooting Quality Controls  
The following steps must be used when troubleshooting and documenting quality control 
failures.  
1) Determine if an assignable cause can be found (e.g., incorrect placement, bubbles). If 
an assignable cause can be found, correct the identified problem.  
2) Retest the quality control from the original control bottle . If the quality controls are 
within the v alidity criteria, testing may continue.  
3) If the quality control value still does not meet the validity criteria, test the quality 
control substituting a new control bottle . If the quality control value is within the 
estab lished range, continue testing.  
4) If the quality control value still does not meet the validity criteria, repeat  assay 
calibration  on the instrument and repeat all quality controls . If the quality control 
values are within the established range, continue tes ting. 
5) If the quality control value still does not meet the validity criteria, place new reagents  
on the instrument, repeat assay calibration , and repeat all quality control testing . If 
the controls are within the validity criteria, testing may continue.  
D000096563  Rev A, Released  - Effective  on: 19-Nov-[ADDRESS_766403] caused the out of 
range results.  
6) If the quality control value still does not meet the validity criteria, contact [CONTACT_582775]. Any test results generated since the last acceptable control 
run must be evaluated to determine if test results may have been adversely affected.  
An Incident CRF must be completed, documenting the troubleshooting steps performed 
and any additional action required for resolution (e.g., rec alibration, opening a new 
control bottle). The Abbott monitor must be notified when control failures are 
observed.  
7. Method for Handling Retests, Exceptions, and Dilutions  
The following conditions may require retesting:  
• Specimens with  initial  S/CO values ≥ 1.[ADDRESS_766404] be retested 
in duplicate . Specimens with an initial Alinity s Anti -HCV II S/CO result ≥ 0.80 to < 
1.00 should  be removed from  the clot and stored frozen ( -20°C or colder) . 
• Testing of a specimen may be repeated if assignable cause (e.g., operator error, 
instrument malfunction) can be determined and documented by [CONTACT_977]. 
• For tests that  cannot be completed and result in an error code, the test is to be 
repeated. If u nable to retest the specimen or additional troubleshooting steps are 
required to resolve the error, an Incident CRF must  be completed. A copy of the error 
report or screen display should  be printed  and electronically transferred, when possible.  
The origina l SID will be used for all repeat testing. Refer to the “Specimen Collection 
and Preparation for Analysis ” Section of the Alinity s Anti -HCV II Reagent Kit 
Clinical Brochure. If re -centrifugation is required, document using  an Incident CRF.

method will be performed according to the comparator IFU. 
Each of the donor centers  will provide specimens from random donors representing 
unique ind ividuals for a tot al of minimum  15,[ADDRESS_766406] igational Alinity s Anti -
HCV II assay, comparator assay , and supplemental testing , as needed.   
A minimum of  400 frozen  preselected Anti -HCV positive specimens from U.S. 
individuals and a minimum of  400 frozen specimens from U.S. individuals at increased 
risk f or HCV  infection  will be provided by [CONTACT_582770] 3 clinical site s 
for sensitivity testing . Specimens will be tested across  a minimum of  3 lots of 
investigational Alinity s Anti -HCV II reagen ts, calibrator s, and controls. In addition, the 
D000096563  Rev A, Released  - Effective  on: 19-Nov-[ADDRESS_766407]  as well as the 
investigational Anti -HCV II reagent/calibrator/control lot combination , if required . 
Note: After testing of a specimen, any remaining specimen volume must be retained 
frozen  (at -20°C or colder) . The Abbott monitor may request certain procedures or 
additional testing to be performed for troubleshooting purposes. The additional testing 
may require various procedures to be repeated.  
Note : Specimens must  be tested on the same freeze thaw cycle for the Alinity s assay 
and the comparator method. If the sample has been tested or retested on  a subsequent 
freeze thaw cycle, the event must  be documented on an Incident CRF  and the Abbott 
monitor notified . 
Procedure  
1) Test each Alinity s Anti -HCV II quality control, if daily Alinity s quality controls 
have not been already tested and assessed for validity.  
2) Refer to the “Specimen Collection and Preparation for Analysis” section of the 
Alinity s Anti -HCV II Reagent Kit C linical Brochure for detailed procedures on handling 
of samples prior to placing specimens on the Alinity s System.  
3) A single replicate of each specimen must  be tested with the investigational Alinity s 
Anti-HCV II assay. Specimens must  be placed in barcoded tubes in a sample rack and 
placed on the Alinity s System to schedule testing.  
4) Schedule an Alinity s Anti -HCV II Rele ase Control. If the release control is not 
already on the system, place the calibrator and control rack on the Alinity s System in the 
priority bay to schedule testing.  
5) Specimens with an initial S/CO result of ≥ 1.00 are initially reactive and  should  be 
retested in duplicate with the investigational Alinity s Anti -HCV II assay. Specimens with  
an in itial S/CO result of <  1.00 do not require further testing . 
6) Repeat testing should be performed using the same reagent lot and be done on the 
same day or the following workday. If greater than 48 hours has elapsed from the initial 
centrifugation, re -centrifuge the sample and document on the Incident CRF. Refer to th e 
Alinity s Anti -HCV II Reagent Kit C linical Brochure for further information regarding 
centrifugation of specimens.  
7) Initially reactive specimens with  both duplicate retest results nonreactive (S/CO <  
1.00) are negative and no further testing is required. If either retest result has S/CO  > 
1.00, then supplemental testing will be performed.  
8) Each specimen must  be tested with the comparator Alinity s  Anti-HCV method . 
Specimens with an in itial S/CO result of < 1.00 do not require further testing . Specimens

centrifugation is required for the comparator method testing, document on the Incident 
CRF. Refer to the comparator  Alinity s  Anti-HCV IFU for further information regarding 
centrifugation of specimens . 
9) If the comparator  method result is repeatedly reactive, then supplemental testing will 
be performed . 
10) Refer to the protocol Appendix 1 for the Alinity s Anti -HCV II Supplemental 
Algorithm s and instructions from your Abbott monitor regarding supplemental testing.  
11) After supplemental testing is complete for donor specimens, the Abbott monitor will 
notify the collection site of any donors that need to be contact[CONTACT_51095] -up blood

Assay reproducibility  will be determined by [CONTACT_582781] a panel at a 
minimum of 3 clinical sites using a minimum of 3 lots each of Alinity s Anti -HCV II 
assay reagents , calibrators, and controls . 
b. Analysis Variables  
The analysis variable is the Alinity s Anti -HCV II S/CO values for all panel members and 
controls.  
c. Statistical Analysis Method  
The analysis method is based on CLSI EP 05-A3. The reproducibility  panel members and 
the Negative and Positive controls will be tested twice a day (minimum [ADDRESS_766414] result of the same 
sample from the second run)  for a minimum of 5 days per site and per reagent lot. Within 
each run, each panel member/control will be te sted in two aliquots and two replicates will 
be assayed per aliquot, resulting in four results per sample.  
Overall Reproducibility Analysis  
Data from all sites and reagent lots for each reproducibility panel/control member will 
be used for the reproducibil ity analysis. The following individual variance components 
will be estimated: within -run, between -run, between -day, between -lot, between -site, and 
site-lot interaction. The within -laboratory variance is defined as the summation of 
within -run, between -run, and between -day variance components. Reproducibility  is 
defined as the summation of within -run, between -run, between -day, between -lot, 
between -site, and si te-lot interaction variance components. The estimates of the mean 
S/CO, standard deviation (SD) and %CV will be calculated.

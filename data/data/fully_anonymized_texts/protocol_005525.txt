Initial Screening Questions
Updated June 2017
4.1  : * PROJECT SUMMARY  (REQUIRED) Give a brief overview of this project (250 words or less). Tell us 
what this study is about, who is being studied, and what it aims to achieve. If you have an NIH 
  Abstract, paste it here:  Click on the orange question mark to the right for more detailed instructions.
Among 13 million informal caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease or related 
dementias, an estimated 1.4 million live in rural areas of the US. These caregivers are a 
vulnerable group due to their physical isolation and well-documented rural disparities in health 
care access and quality. Many rural dementia caregivers experience serious health consequences 
due to caregiving responsibilities that can limit their ability to maintain their caregiving role. Thus, 
there is an pressing need for effective, scalable, and accessible programs to support rural 
dementia caregivers so that they can sustain their own well-being and effective caregiving within 
the home environments of their loved ones.
Online programs offer a convenient and readily translatable option for program delivery because 
they can be accessed by [CONTACT_909787]. 
 is an online 6-week, interactive, small-group self-management, social Building Better Caregivers
support, and skills-building workshop developed for caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer’s 
disease or related forms of dementia. In our evaluations of the program in non-randomized 
studies, caregivers experienced significant improvements in stress, depression symptoms, and 
self-efficacy and partners experienced improved well-being.
Building on these encouraging preliminary findings, we now propose to conduct a hybrid 
effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial that will enroll and randomize 640 rural 
dementia caregivers into two groups: 320 in the intervention (workshop) group and 320 in the 
attention control group. Caregivers will be recruited through 19 community organizations (serving 
rural communities in 17 states). Primary outcomes will be caregiver stress and depression 
symptoms. We hypothesize that stress scores and depression symptoms will be significantly 
improved at 12 months in the intervention group versus control group. We will also identify key 
strengths (facilitators) and weaknesses (barriers) of workshop implementation. We will use the 
RE-AIM implementation framework and a mixed methods approach to identify implementation 
characteristics pertinent to both caregivers and rural community organizations.
If the  workshop is proven to be effective, this research has the Building Better Caregivers
potential to open new research horizons, particularly on how to reach and effectively support 
isolated dementia caregivers in rural areas with an intervention that is scalable, even in low-
resourced settings. If the workshop can achieve its goals with rural dementia caregivers, some of 
those most isolated, it would also be expected to be scalable in other low-resourced settings (e.
g., in urban or suburban environments).

8.2  Describe the hypothesis or what the study hopes to prove : HYPOTHESIS: (Help Text updated 9/13)
We propose to conduct a hybrid effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial of the B
 online self-management workshop among rural caregivers of partners uilding Better Caregivers
with Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia. We hypothesize that stress scores and 
depression symptoms will be significantly improved at 12 months in the intervention vs. control 
group (Aim 1). We also will identify the key strengths (facilitators) and weaknesses (barriers) of 
workshop implementation to characterize its potential to achieve widespread, community-based, 
real-world implementation in rural America (Aim 2).
8.[ADDRESS_1277266] the specific aims: AIMS: 
Aim 1 : Evaluate the effectiveness of an online self-management workshop for rural 
informal caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease. We will perform a 12-month 
randomized controlled trial of the  workshop by [CONTACT_909791]-reported outcomes for participants in the intervention group (n=320) and attention control 
group (n=320) on the primary outcomes of caregiver stress and depression symptoms. Nineteen 
community organizations and three national organizations serving rural communities in [ADDRESS_1277267] agreed to partner with us on the proposed trial. We will recruit rural dementia caregivers 
from the many rural communities they serve.
Aim 2 : Identify key strengths (facilitators) and weaknesses (barriers) of workshop 
implementation . For our implementation evaluation, we will use the RE-AIM framework and a 
mixed methods approach. To identify implementation characteristics pertinent to , we caregivers
will identify patterns of experience across all workshop participants via analysis of implementation 
questions embedded in trial surveys administered to all participants. To more deeply understand 
these experiences, we will interview a sample of 60 caregivers—15 per US region (West, Midwest, 
Northeast, South). To determine implementation characteristics pertinent to community 
, we will collect data from our partner community organizations on experiences of organizations
barriers and facilitators. Analyses will compare and contrast characteristics within and between 
organizations. Findings will identify essential elements of workshop implementation that should be 
incorporated into future implementation efforts. Findings on effective and ineffective strategies 
will inform the implementation of other online programs for rural, caregiver, and Alzheimer’s 
disease populations.
8.4  Briefly describe the study design (e.g., observational, interventional, randomized, placebo- DESIGN: 
controlled, blinded, cross-over, cross-sectional, longitudinal, pharmacokinetic, etc.):   
We will recruit 640 rural dementia caregiver adults through 19 community organizations (serving 
rural communities in 17 states to implement a randomized, attention controlled clinical trial. 
Caregivers will be randomized to receive the online intervention (workshop) group or attention 
control group. The online workshops will be facilitated by [CONTACT_909792]. We will assess both primary and secondary outcomes at baseline, 1.5 months (post 
intervention), 6 and 12 months, with the main intervention group comparison being at 12 
months. Interested control group caregivers also will be offered the workshop after the trial is 
completed.
Using mixed methods approach we will identify implementation characteristics pertinent to 
caregivers, identify patterns of experience across all workshop participants via analysis of 
implementation questions embedded in trial surveys administered to all participants. To more 
deeply understand these experiences, we will interview a sample of 60 caregivers—15 per US 
region (West, Midwest, Northeast, South).
To determine implementation characteristics pertinent to community organizations, we will collect 
data from our partner community organizations on experiences of barriers and facilitators. 
Analyses will compare and contrast characteristics within and between organizations. Findings will 
identify essential elements of workshop implementation that should be incorporated into future 
implementation efforts. Findings on effective and ineffective strategies will inform the 
implementation of other online programs for rural, caregiver, and Alzheimer’s disease populations.
8.5   Briefly provide the background and significance of this study (e.g. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE:
 why is this study needed) (space limit: one half page):
Approximately 13 million informal caregivers provide critical support to US adults with Alzheimer’s 
disease and other forms of dementia—enabling them to live safer, healthier, and more fulfilling 
lives in their homes and local communities. Informal caregivers (“caregivers”) are usually unpaid 
family members or friends who help patient care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (“partners”) manage their health 
conditions and day-to-day activities. Among dementia caregivers, an estimated 1.[ADDRESS_1277268] been evaluated among 
rural caregivers, and neither used a randomized study design. In addition, well-established 
dementia caregiver programs (e.g., REACH, COPE, Tele-Savvy) are delivered in-person, one-on-
one (e.g., by [CONTACT_648]), or at set times of day, which can diminish uptake by [CONTACT_909793], cannot leave their partners alone, or have difficulty keepi[INVESTIGATOR_909742]. Isolated rural dementia 
caregivers also crave social interactions with peers. Online small group programs that are 
accessible at home at any time of day would be an ideal option for many such caregivers.
8.6  Briefly summarize any preliminary studies relevant to your proposed PRELIMINARY STUDIES: 
research : (space limit: one half page)
Our team has developed and pi[INVESTIGATOR_909743] 6-week, highly interactive, small-group self-
management and skills-building workshop for caregivers of loved ones with dementia or cognitive 
impairment. The workshop, called Building Better Caregivers, is based on Self-Efficacy Theory 
boosted by [CONTACT_909794]-management programs. Every part of the workshop is designed 
to enhance caregiver self-management behaviors, dementia caregiving skills, and peer social 
support. In our evaluations of the program in non-randomized studies, caregivers experienced 
significant improvements in stress, depression symptoms, and self-efficacy (Cohen’s d 
standardized effect size range 0.27-0.70), and partners experienced improved well-being (effect 
size = 0.40). Participation by [CONTACT_909795] 30-50%, and the community 
organizations that partnered with us expressed enthusiasm for expanding the workshop reach to 
a greater number of rural dementia caregivers.
Building on these encouraging preliminary findings, we now propose to conduct a hybrid 
effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial of the Building Better Caregivers online 
self-management workshop among rural caregivers of partners with Alzheimer’s disease or other 
forms of dementia. Effectiveness-implementation trials focus a priori on assessing both clinical 
effectiveness and implementation and can therefore reduce time to translation.

Only #1 below will be done if a potential participant does not enroll in the study.
1.    Eligibility will be determined by [CONTACT_909796]. Potential Eligibility: 
participants will also be given the option to complete it by [CONTACT_335146], if they prefer.  Potential 
participants will be asked their age, gender, to indicate the outreach effort(s) they are responding 
to in which targeted rural communities, followed by [CONTACT_99099]: caring for patient with 
dementia (PWD); able to read and write in English; able to access the internet; providing care for 
≥ 10 hours per week.
2.    After confirming eligibility they will read all consent forms (written at Informed consent: 
the 6th grade level) online. These will be formatted so that they can print them out if desired. 
They will be offered the opportunity to discuss the study by [CONTACT_909797]. Those comfortable doing so will then complete the online consent form (or a 
mailed hardcopy, if they prefer).

workshop.  Building Better Caregivers is an online 6-week, interactive, small-group self-
management, social support, and skills-building workshop developed for caregivers of 
individuals with Alzheimer’s disease or related forms of dementia.  Workshop content 
encompasses two complementary categories—topi[INVESTIGATOR_909744]-
management and topi[INVESTIGATOR_909745]. Workshops consist of 20-
[ADDRESS_1277269] 2-3 times for a total time 
of approximately two hours. Activities are guided by [CONTACT_909798]-facilitators (caregivers 
themselves). Caregiver participation does not require “real time” attendance at pre-
determined times.  Caregivers interact in group discussions and person-to-person 
communications by [CONTACT_909799]. They can write these at any time of day or night. Such participant interactions 
are frequent and similar to email, Facebook, or texting exchanges. Each week focuses on 
the introduction of 2-3 new topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], with some key topi[INVESTIGATOR_909746]. 
Lessons are then reinforced in the Discussion Center section of the website, where the 
peer social support occurs.
Information on the workshop facilitators :
All facilitators are originally leaders of another onlinee small group workshop called the 
chronic disease self-management program and have completed 4 days of training for that 
program. There are more than 5000 of these people nationwide. Those who are caregivers 
(of persons with dementia or other chronic conditions) and are interested in receiving 
additional training are offered the opportunity to become  Building Better Caregivers
facilitators. They then receive additional training in a series of webinars that familiarize 
them with the workshop and train them to follow the workshop facilitator manual. The 
manual guides them through all workshop topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], activities, and anticipated participant 
interactions. Facilitators must demonstrate mastery of the material. Finally, they co-
facilitator their first workshop with an experienced facilitator and are mentored by [CONTACT_909800]. Only after this do they become a fully-qualified facilitator. Canary 
Health (the health technology company that is licensed by [CONTACT_909801]) already has a robust cadre of these facilitators that guide 
workshops for Veteran caregivers. Facilitators can lead workshops remotely from 
anywhere in the US and are paid to do so. All workshop interactions are recorded on the 
workshop platform, such that fidelity tracking is streamlined. We will use this to perform 
fidelity monitoring in the current study. [CONTACT_909862] and research staff will perform 
intervention fidelity monitoring. We will use a fidelity assessment instrument  to evaluate 
online recordings on a weekly basis. If facilitators stray from the facilitator manual they 
will receive immediate remedial training from [CONTACT_909862] or [CONTACT_909863]. If they continue to 
depart from the manual they will be removed from their role and another facilitator will be 
brought in to serve as co-facilitator.
Weekly topi[INVESTIGATOR_909747], activities,and discussions include those that 
focus on caregiver self-management and those that focus on dementia caregiving:

week, new content is made available.  Past weeks’ content also remains 
available.  The Learning Center is self-directed in that participants can control the 
speed and timing of their reading and lessons.
The  is interactive and includes four directed bulletin boards where Discussion Center
discussions and interaction occur and are facilitated by [CONTACT_909802]: the 
action-planning board, the problem-solving board, the difficult emotions board, and 
the celebrations board.
My Tools  is a personal area accessible only by [CONTACT_909803], exercise monitoring logs, and medication records.
For intervention group fidelity purposes. All workshop interactions are recorded via 
screen shots on the workshop platform, such that fidelity tracking is streamlined. [CONTACT_909864], [CONTACT_909863] or research staff will perform intervention fidelity monitoring. We will use 
the fidelity assessment instrument to evaluate online recordings on a weekly basis. If 
facilitators stray from the facilitator manual they will receive immediate remedial training 
from [CONTACT_909863] or Yank. If they continue to depart from the manual they will be removed 
from their role and another facilitator will be brought in to serve as co-facilitator.

research coordinator will evaluate recordings using a fidelity assessment instrument. Staff 
who stray from the phone call protocol will receive immediate remedial training. If an RA 
strays from the protocol again, he/she will be removed from making phone calls. At the 
outset of the trial, fidelity assessment will occur approximately every 4-5 calls to assure 
fidelity patterns are quickly established and reinforced. Subsequent checks will occur every 
10-12 calls.
5.    Data will be collected at baseline, 1.5 months (post intervention), 6 months, Assessments: 
and [ADDRESS_1277271]-intervention (1.5 months), and 6, and 12 months using the secure 
REDCap application. Assessments are expected to be 20 minutes each. Participants will be given 
the option to complete surveys by [CONTACT_909804].
a.     questions will ask about caregiver and PWD demographic information (e.g., Baseline
age, gender, race/ethnicity, education); caregiving relationship to PWD (e.g., spouse, 
child), and resources participants are accessing (e.g., paid in-home care). Baseline 
questions also will identify caregiver and partner chronic conditions (e.g., using the 
Charlson comorbidity index), partner need for assistance with ADLs and IADLs, and 
dementia characteristics (e.g., diagnosis, length of diagnosis, degree of impairment, 
presence of behavioral symptoms). Caregiver (CG) stress level (Stress visual numeric 
scale), CG depression symptoms (PHQ-8 score), Self-efficacy (Revised Scale for Caregiver 
Self-efficacy), Burden (Zarit Burden Inventory), Strain (Caregiver Strain Index), Global 
health score, and Healthcare utilization items.
b.    . We will administer the Caregiver (CG) stress level (Stress visual 1.5 months
numeric scale), CG depression symptoms (PHQ-8 score), Self-efficacy (Revised Scale for 
Caregiver Self-efficacy), Burden (Zarit Burden Inventory), Strain (Caregiver Strain Index), 
Global health score, and Healthcare utilization items. For participants randomized to the 
intervention group will be given additional questions on Reach (e.g., how heard about 
trial, reasons for participation); Implementation (e.g., ease of/barriers to logging into 
workshop and performing online activities, whether completed the workshop and, if not, 
why not); and Maintenance (e.g., whether workshop experiences have continued to 
influence their self-care or caregiving practices or own/partner’s health).
c.     . We will administer the Caregiver (CG) stress level (Stress visual numeric 6 months
scale), CG depression symptoms (PHQ-8 score), Self-efficacy (Revised Scale for Caregiver 
Self-efficacy), Burden (Zarit Burden Inventory), Strain (Caregiver Strain Index), Global 
health score, and Healthcare utilization items.  For participants randomized to the 
intervention group will be given additional questions on Reach (e.g., how heard about 
trial, reasons for participation); Implementation (e.g., ease of/barriers to logging into 
workshop and performing online activities, whether completed the workshop and, if not, 
why not); and Maintenance (e.g., whether workshop experiences have continued to 
influence their self-care or caregiving practices or own/partner’s health).
d.    . We will administer the Caregiver (CG) stress level (Stress visual numeric 12 months
scale), CG depression symptoms (PHQ-8 score), Self-efficacy (Revised Scale for Caregiver 
Self-efficacy), Burden (Zarit Burden Inventory), Strain (Caregiver Strain Index), Global 
health score, and Healthcare utilization items. For participants randomized to the 
intervention group will be given additional questions on Reach (e.g., how heard about 
trial, reasons for participation); Implementation (e.g., ease of/barriers to logging into 
workshop and performing online activities, whether completed the workshop and, if not, 
why not); and Maintenance (e.g., whether workshop experiences have continued to 
influence their self-care or caregiving practices or own/partner’s health).
For Aim 2-Procedures for In-depth Interviews.
We will randomly select a sub-set of intervention group caregivers for semi-structured telephone 
interviews regarding workshop implementation characteristics. We will sample for caregivers 
(n=60 total) from all US regions (n=15 per region—West, Midwest, South, Northeast) to achieve 
the expected saturation of themes within 12-15 interviews/region.
In the 30-minute telephone interview we will probe for deeper understanding of the caregiver’s 
impressions of and responses to the workshop. Interviews will be audiorecorded and electronically 
stored on secure computers. Following each interview, the interviewer will write a summary of the 
content of the interview to assist with subsequent analysis of audiorecordings. Professionals will 
transcribe and anonymize recordings.
Interviewers will ask caregivers questions about workshop Implementation and Maintenance (e.
g., What helped you be able to participate in the workshop? Are there other things that would 
have made it easier for you?, What got in the way of your participation in the workshop? Can you 
describe things that would help you overcome these problems?, What workshop activities did you 
participate in and why did you? What activities did you not participate in and why not?, What 
aspects of the workshop most impacted your caregiving? What workshop lessons or skills have 
you continued to use?, Can you describe the impact the workshop has had on you or your 
partner?).
For Aim [ADDRESS_1277272] half will be devoted to a discussion of aspects of workshop 
implementation. We also will track the use of different outreach strategies and subsequent 
successful (or unsuccessful) recruitment to inform future implementation efforts. The second half 
of the webinars will include lectures on and discussion of caregiving and Alzheimer’s disease 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_909751]. Organizations will be invited to nominate topi[INVESTIGATOR_909752] [ADDRESS_1277273]-serve for learning from each other (e.g., discussing 
challenges, exchanging tips). Periodically, the research team will make posts to the list-serve to 
prompt group discussion of specific implementation questions, concerns, or success stories.  We 
will also ask for descriptive data related to their organization.

Aim 1 Instrument.
Descriptive variables.
Baseline questions will ask about caregiver and patient with dementia (PWD) demographic 
information (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity, education);
caregiving relationship to PWD (e.g., spouse, child),
resources participants are accessing (e.g., paid in-home care).
 caregiver and PWD chronic conditions (e.g., using the Charlson comorbidity index),
PWD need for assistance with Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and Instrumental Activities 
of Daily Living (IADLs),
 PWD dementia characteristics (e.g., diagnosis, length of diagnosis, degree of impairment, 
presence of behavioral symptoms).
Primary outcomes.
Caregivers describe high personal stress as one of the most challenging aspects of being a 
caregiver. We will use a single-item visual numeric scale (range 1-10) developed by [CONTACT_67039]. Visual numeric scales [VNS] have been shown to correlate well [r = .72] with same-
worded visual analogue scales [VAS] and generate higher completion rates.
 We will measure the co-primary outcome of caregiver depression symptoms with an 8-
item modified and validated version of the PHQ-9.
Secondary outcomes.
Self-efficacy will be measured with the 15-item Caregiver Self-Efficacy scale.
Caregiving burden will be assessed with the 12-item short form of the Zarit Burden 
Inventory.
The modified 13-item Caregiver Strain Index will measures caregiver strain.
Single-item caregiver-reported data will be collected on caregiver and PWD global health, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and emergency room visits.
We will use the National Health and Nutrition Survey question on global health.
We will measure healthcare utilization using single-item questions on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_909753] 6-month recall time frame we are using, including among dementia caregivers.
For intervetion arm only: We will embed implementation questions administered to all 
intervention group caregivers at baseline and months 1.5, 6, and 12. Questions will ask about 
various aspects (e.g., how heard about trial, reasons for participation, ease of/barriers to logging 
into workshop and performing online activities, whether completed the workshop and, if not, why 
not; whether workshop experiences have continued to influence their self-care or caregiving 
practices or own/partner’s health).
 
Fidelity monitoring assessment. We will use the fidelity assessment instrument from pi[INVESTIGATOR_909754] a weekly basis for the intervention group. Similarly, we 
will use a fidelity assessment instrument to evaluate phone calls for the attention control group.
 
Aim 2 Instrument.
We will develop an instrument that will be adminsted to a randomly selected sub-set of 
intervention group caregivers for semi-structured telephone interviews regarding workshop 
implementation characteristics. We will probe for deeper understanding of the caregiver’s 
impressions of and responses to the workshop. This instrument will ask caregivers questions 
about workshop  and .  (e.g., ease of/barriers to Implementation Maintenance Implementation
logging into workshop and performing online activities, whether completed the workshop and, if 
not, why not) and  (e.g., whether workshop experiences have continued to influence Maintenance

performed:
Aim 1 Data Analysis Methods.
Descriptive analyses. Caregiver and caregiver-reported partner socio-demographic 
characteristics, chronic conditions, and health utilization outcomes will be summarized as means 
(±SD), frequencies, percentages, and 95% confidence intervals at baseline and 1.5, 6, and 12 
months. The distributions of covariates at baseline will be checked for balance between the two 
groups with histograms and/or boxplots.
Primary analyses.  Primary analyses will compare caregiver stress (stress score) and depression 
symptoms (PHQ-8 score) between intervention and control groups over time with respective 
linear mixed effects models. Linear mixed effects models use all available observations in the 
data, assume data are missing at random, and provide an intention-to-treat analysis. Models will 
include group, time, and (group*time) interaction terms as fixed effects and community 
organizations and subjects as random effects to account for the correlation within organizations 
and subjects due to measurements over time. Covariates with imbalanced distributions between 
the two groups will also be included in the models to control for potential confounding. The 
(group*time) interaction term will be used to evaluate if the two groups differ in outcomes over 
time. The study is powered to allow 30% loss to follow up. To assess for potential differential 
withdrawal between groups, comparisons of withdrawal rates and time to withdrawal will be 
performed. Models based on a potential outcome framework will be used to assess treatment 
effect while accounting for noncompliance and missing data and to examine potential treatment 
mechanisms/pathways via intermediate variables (such as social support, self-efficacy, caregiving 
skills). Multiple imputation based on reasonable assumptions on mechanisms of missing data will 
be used to perform sensitivity analyses.
Secondary analyses. Secondary analyses will use (generalized) linear mixed effect models 
similar to the primary mixed effect models for continuous, categorical, and count secondary 
outcomes. Treatment effects in subgroups (e.g. by [CONTACT_4321]) of our interest will be evaluated using 
(generalized) linear mixed effect models with corresponding interactions of group, time and sex 
while controlling for false discovery rate. We expect a small and balanced recall error between the 
two groups but if recall error is unbalanced, measurement error models will be considered for 
treatment evaluation. We will examine loss to follow-up by [CONTACT_909805]-up 
to those who complete the study.   
 
Aim 2 Data Analysis Methods.
We will use mixed methods and multiple data sources to generate findings. We will identify 
facilitators and barriers of workshop implementation pertinent to caregivers.
Data analyses using all intervention caregivers' :  We will embed implementation questions 
in the web-based trial surveys administered to all intervention group caregivers at baseline and 
months 1.5, 6, and 12.  We will perform descriptive and comparative analyses of the survey-
based and platform-derived data to identify notable barriers and facilitators of workshop 
implementation for intervention group caregivers. For example, we will analyze participation rate 
by [CONTACT_909806]-groups (e.g., region, age, gender, race/ethnicity). Findings will identify the 
degree to which  successfully achieves the Reach, Implementation, and Building Better Caregivers
Maintenance domains of RE-AIM for caregivers.

5.  Data analyses using a subest of intervention caregivers:  We will sample for caregivers 
(n=60 total) from all US regions (n=15 per region—West, Midwest, South, Northeast) to achieve 
the expected saturation of themes within 12-15 interviews/region. Using data collected through 
telephone-based 30 minute interviews we will probe for deeper understanding of the caregiver’s 
impressions of and responses to the workshop. Interviews will be audiorecorded and electronically 
stored on secure computers. Professionals will transcribe and anonymize recordings. A code key 
linking transcripts to participants will be kept in a secure electronic file accessible to only the 
study PI [INVESTIGATOR_67880].  Data analysis will be conducted concurrently with ongoing 
data collection to ensure timely generation of findings. Interview transcripts and summary notes 
will be uploaded into NVivo qualitative data management and analysis software.  Using NVivo the 
coding team will perform thematic analysis of interview transcripts. The coding team will consist 
of the research coordinator and RA. They will read each transcript and assign codes to identify 
emergent themes and also apply deductive codes derived from the RE-AIM framework. a priori 
After coding approximately 6-7 transcripts, the coding team will convene with Drs. Yank and 
Chesla (investigators with qualitative research expertise) to compare and discuss individual styles 
of coding and approaches to achieve coding consistency and begin to identify among emergent 
codes whether there are relevant sub-codes to be agreed upon. The coding team and 
investigators will meet for a similar discussion following coding of an additional 6-7 transcripts to 
assure consistency. After coding is completed, the same group will convene, discuss, and reach 
consensus on interview themes, qualitative findings, and illustrative quotes.

10.0  Sample Size and Eligibility Criteria
10.1   How many people will you enroll: ENROLLMENT TARGET: 
678
 If there are multiple participant groups, indicate how many people will be 
in each group:
For Aim [ADDRESS_1277278].  We will recruit 640 rural dementia caregiver adults through 19 
community organizations (serving rural communities in 17 states to implement a randomized, 
attention controlled clinical trial. 320 in the intervention group and 320 in the control group for a 
total of n=640.
 
For Aim [ADDRESS_1277279] a sub-set of intervention 
group caregivers for semi-structured telephone interviews regarding workshop implementation 
characteristics. We will sample for caregivers (n=60 total) from all US regions (n=15 per region—
West, Midwest, South, Northeast).
 
For Aim 1 and Aim 2 Sample for Learning Collaborative.  19 community organizations 
(serving rural communities in 17 states) will have at most 2 representatives participating in the 
Learning Collaborative (n=2*19=38).
10.3  Explain how and why the number of people was chosen. For multi-site SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION: 
studies, this is referring to the number that will be enrolled across all sites:
The study is powered on the co-primary outcome with the lowest effect size in pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602]—the 
PHQ-8 depression symptoms score (effect size 0.27). We will use a recruitment target of 640 
participants. We assume 30% loss to follow-up, thus expecting 448 caregivers (224 per group) 
will complete the study at [ADDRESS_1277280] size of 0.265 with a power of 0.8 at a significance level of 0.05 (two-sided). The effect size 
of 0.265 corresponds to a 1.5 difference in PHQ-8 score (range 0-24) between groups assuming a 
common standard deviation of 5.6.  We also will have the power to detect a 1.4 difference in the 
co-primary outcome of stress score (range 0-10) between the two groups.
If we encounter problems meeting trial enrollment benchmarks, we will work with local 
organizations and others to find alternative recruitment strategies such as health system-based 
patient portals or recruitment through national caregiver discussion groups.  We also can add 
additional partner organizations after the start of the study.

10.7   Briefly describe the population(s) that will be involved in this study. Include INCLUSION CRITERIA: 
anyone that data will be collected from or about (e.g. patients, healthy controls, caregivers, 
providers, administrators, students, parents, family members, etc.):
For Aim [ADDRESS_1277281] Sample Inclusion Criteria. We will include participants 1) who are 18 years or 
older, 2) responding to outreach efforts in targeted rural communities, 3) caring for person with 
dementia (PWD), 4) able to read and write in English, 5) able to access the internet, and 6) 
providing care for ≥ 10 hours per week*.
 
*We define “care” as the full range of caregiving activities, rather than a specific sub-set, because 
national data indicate that most caregivers perform a mixture of tasks.  Caregivers performing 
medium-to-high burden care do so for, on average, ≥ 10 hours/week, assist with ≥ 2 activities of 
daily living (ADLs) (e.g., dressing) and ≥ 4 instrumental ADLs (e.g., meal preparation), and 
perform medical tasks, health care coordination, and advocacy.  The time threshold of ≥ 10 hours
/week is therefore pragmatic, similar to criteria used in other studies, and will identify caregivers 
experiencing higher burden—those at increased risk for poor personal health outcomes and thus 
most likely to benefit from the intervention.

For studies using online recruitment and consent or consent via mail, provide details here.
For Aim [ADDRESS_1277288], they will read all informed consent information (written at the 6  th
grade level) online or by [CONTACT_548485] a copy from online. The consent information will be formatted to 
be easily printed and  read as paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_909757]. If caregivers prefer, they will have the 
option of having study personnel send them the consent information sheet by [CONTACT_909809]. Interested caregivers will be scheduled for a phone-based informed consent 
discussion with qualified study personnel. During that call the study personnel will review the 
informed consent information sheet out loud, conduct a discussion of it with the potential 
participant, and address all questions or concerns. At such time as the caregivers confirm 
that their questions or concerns have been met and the study personnel determines the caregiver 
understands the study and consent process, study personnel will then obtain verbal 
consent. Caregivers will verbally indicate that they consent ot participate in the study at that time 
during the phone call. This will be considered to be verbal informed consent to participate. Once 
verbal consent is obtained we will mail them a copy of the information sheet.
For Aim [ADDRESS_1277289] agreed to partner with us in this study, the research staff will explain over the phone the 
purpose of the biannual webinars (to provide input on recruitment preferences for the caregivers 
they serve, and their experience with implementing and maintaining the Building Better 
Caregivers online workshop and your suggestions for improving it) community members will be 
told that some webinars will be audiorecorded and notes will be taken by [CONTACT_3647]. These 
will be electronically stored on secure computers, answer any questions community members 
may have, read the information sheet out loud, and obtain verbal informed consent prior to their 
participation in the webinars.  Once verbal consent is obtained we will mail them a copy of the 
information sheet.
 It is important that the people obtaining consent are qualified to do so. *

For the  telephone surveys , an experienced staff member will obtain verbal informed consent by 
[CONTACT_14662] a low-literacy script to explain the purpose interview (learn more about their experience 
in the intervention), answer any questions or concerns, and ask explicitly if the potential 
participant agrees to participate in the relevant portion of the project under questions (RCT 
or one-time 30-minute phone interview for Aim 2 ).  The interviewer will ask questions to make 
sure that the participant has understood the information.
For Aim 1 and 2 Learning Collaborative. For the  Learning Collaborative , the PI [INVESTIGATOR_909758] a low-literacy script to explain the

12.0  Risks and Benefits
12.1  Check if your study involves any of these specific research-related risks RESEARCH-RELATED RISKS: 
to participants that may need to be disclosed in the consent form:
Physical discomforts or pain
Risks to employment, or social or legal standing
Possible personal discomfort due to sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102] (stress, embarassment, trauma)
Risk that the study team may observe possible evidence of child abuse, elder abuse, or a 
threat to self or others that they are required to report
For any boxes checked above, describe how you will minimize these risks * 
and discomforts, e.g., adding or increasing the frequency 
of monitoring, additional screening to identify and exclude people with 
diminished kidney or liver function, or modification of procedures such as 
changing imaging studies to avoid giving contrast agent to people who are 
more likely to suffer side effects from it, etc.: (REQUIRED)
This is a behavioral intervention with minimal risks.
Potential risks for caregivers taking part in the study may make respondents feel uncomfortable, 
upset or other emotional responses as a result of answering survey questions or during the 
interview, but they can refuse to answer or stop the interview at any time.  
There is also a risk of loss of confidentiality. We will take steps to protect the privacy of patient 
information, however we cannot guarantee total privacy. All participant data will be coded in a 
confidential manner that will protect the identity of the participant. Participants will be assigned a 
unique identifier, and all data entered into the study database will only utilize this identifier. A list 
of the participant names and the associated codes will be stored on a secured encrypted 
server.   All study-specific data files will be kept on secure servers that are password-protected 
and shielded from unauthorized access by [CONTACT_112331]. Only key study personnel will have access.
There is also slight risks for participating in the online workshop intervention (for those who are 
randomized to receive the Building Better Caregivers workshop initially or who choose to attend it 
later after the trial is completey (control group participants)). Because workshops consist of 20-
[ADDRESS_1277294] 2-3 times 
for a total time of approximately two hours. Activities are guided by [CONTACT_909798]-facilitators 
(caregivers themselves). Caregiver participation does not require “real time” attendance at pre-
determined times. Instead, caregivers interact in group discussions and person-to-person 
communications by [CONTACT_909811]. They 
can write these at any time of day or night. Participants may respond to workshop modules by 
[CONTACT_909812]/or disclosing their experiences of stress and difficult emotions. The workshops 
are facilitated by [CONTACT_909813], which includes when and how to activate built-in 
safety protocols—such as contact [CONTACT_909814] a participant indicates 
they are at any risk for self-harm. Facilitators keep track of all participants by [CONTACT_909815] 6-week workshop. They also observe all 
online interactions and postings daily throughout the workshop. The activities of the facilitators 
are themselves reviewed by “Master Trainers” who monitor the fidelity, quality, and safety of 
workshop delivery. Workshop participants also receive training on how to contact [CONTACT_909816].
12.2  Describe any anticipated risks and discomforts not listed above: RISKS: 
see section 12.1 above.
12.3  
MINIMIZING RISKS: Describe the steps you have taken to minimize the risks/discomforts to 
subjects. Examples include:
designing the study to make use of procedures involving less risk when appropriate
minimizing study procedures by [CONTACT_25943] a plan for evaluation and possible referral of subjects who report suicidal ideation
Efforts to provide protection against risks will occur during all stages of the project. Prior to 
enrollment, the study investigators will explain the study in a clear manner, using language at a 
6th grade level. We will attempt to make our informed consent forms at an 6th grade reading 
level and used bulleted formats to enhance comprehensibility of the forms for persons with lower 
educational levels. Participants will be given several opportunities to ask questions. To prevent 
the perception of coercion to participate, study investigators and research staff will inform the 
participants that they can drop out of the study at any time, and droppi[INVESTIGATOR_909760]. A copy of the 
consent form will be given to the participant (online or by [CONTACT_2319]). The consent form will have 
contact [CONTACT_909817] (PI) and the IRB if they have any 
questions or concerns.
The Research Assistant (RA) will be trained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Yank, the PI, who is a self-management expert 
and practicing primary care physician, with expertise in chronic disease management and 
caregiver and self-management research.  In the course of the study, we will have several 
safeguards in place to quickly identify and respond to participants who we feel might require 
professional mental health assessment and services or other forms of medical assessment or 
care. To decrease the likelihood of an adverse event during the study, the RA will receive 
intensive training from the PI, [CONTACT_909862], and the Project Coordinator on procedures for reporting 
adverse events, how to recognize symptoms of clinical depression or anxiety, and the need to call 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_909761] a participant requires additional services from a mental health or 
health care professional. 
All participant data will be coded in a confidential manner that will protect the identity of the 
participant. Participants will be assigned a unique identifier, and all data entered into the study 
database will only utilize this identifier. A list of the participant names and the associated codes 
will be stored on an encrypted server. Only key study personnel will have access.
The workshop intervention is designed to be appropriate for caregivers of patients with dementia 
living in rural areas. Participants may respond to workshop modules by [CONTACT_909812]/or 
disclosing their experiences of stress and difficult emotions or situations. The workshops are 
facilitated by [CONTACT_909813], which includes when and how to activate built-in

postings daily throughout the workshop. The activities of the facilitators are themselves reviewed 
by “Master Trainers” who monitor the fidelity, quality, and safety of workshop delivery. The 
Master Trainer also has the option (and in the case of a harm protocol activation a requirement) 
of consulting the "Super Trainer" who oversees and trouble-shoots all major workshop deviations 
or concerns. Workshop participants also receive training on how to contact [CONTACT_909819]-help materials in the workshop and also have available to them 
a "crisis tab" that contains phone numbers, weblinks and other information for relevant crisis 
hotlines and related resources.
The  safety protocol is attached to the IRB application and includes the Building Better Caregivers
following characteristics:
Instructions to facilitator to activate the harm protocol in any situation when the facilitator 
"perceives there is a possible imminent threat to a participant's or other third party's well 
being based upon a participant contribution(s) on the Program website"
Protocolized communication by [CONTACT_909820] ("Post Office")
The letter language is pre-populated and instructs the participant on what to do (e.
g., call 911, contact [CONTACT_221003]) and that a member of the research team will 
reach out to them. That person will be the study physician and PI, [CONTACT_909862].
Generation of that letter automatically activates the harm protocol and the other 
harm protocol actions below
The workshop platform generates automatic emails to the workshop co-facilitator, Mentor, 
Super Mentor, and study PI [INVESTIGATOR_909762]. Yank
Once the study physicians receives a harm protocol activation notification, she will telephone the 
participant or relevant local professionals to assess the situation and determine teh required next 
steps. If the situation meets the standards of requiring mandatory reporting (e.g., of concern for 
imminent harm to participant or others), the study physician will perform those activities.
The equivalent harm protocol has been used successfully in the existing provision of a version of 
the workshop to over 3,000 caregivers of veterans by [CONTACT_909821] 
(see Preliminary Studies section of the Research Strategy for details on the workshop for veteran 
caregivers), with activations of the safety protocol being extremely rare (e.g., average of 3 times 
in 24 months) with successful resolution with participant safety being assured in all cases. The 
protocol has never been activated for elder abuse but has been activated in rare instances for the 
following circumstances:
Concern about the safety/welfare of the workshop participant (caregiver) in a situation 
where 
potential harm might be imposed on him/her by [CONTACT_572418] (e.g., loved one 
with dementia for whom they are caring)
the participant (caregiver) suggested that he/she might be severely depressed 
and in danger of self-harm/suicide
Concern about the care partner (not the study participant) hurting himself/herself—in 
other words, not that they are going to harm the caregiver but that they might harm 
themself
In the case of the VA workship, when the harm protocol is activated, the systems sends a VA 
social worker the activation alers and the social worker has performed the function that the study 
physician will perform in the current workshop being studied. Of note, mandatory reporting of 
elder abuse is required in all states involved in the study. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Yank, who is a general 
internal medicine physician will act as the study physician and mandatory reported. She has 
experiences serving as study physician on multiple studies in the past. If she is on vacation or 
otherwise unavailable to serve as study physician, the study physician responsibilities will be met 
by [CONTACT_220517]-up study physician, [CONTACT_909865], who also is a physician investigator and colleague of 
[CONTACT_909862] in the UCSF Division of General Internal Medicine and the UCSF Mt. Zion General 
Internal Medicine Clinic. 
In all cases when the PI [INVESTIGATOR_909763] a potential safety issue, whether by [CONTACT_909822], The PI [INVESTIGATOR_909764]. If the event is determined to be an AE that is moderate or 
higher in degree, [CONTACT_909862] will then contact [CONTACT_909823], make 
appropriate referrals, make appropriate contact [CONTACT_909824]'s home state and region, and follow-up with the participant. The participant will have 
given previous consent for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_909765]/her directly when such an assessment is 
indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_909766]. Furthermore, study participants will have the full contact [CONTACT_909825], including email and telephone contact [CONTACT_8972], so that problems will be identified in a timely 
manner, and should be alleviated by [CONTACT_909826][INVESTIGATOR_909767].  Finally, at the time of enrollment in the study, the study team will 
provide participants with a list of health resources available to them, which will include mental 
health services and hotline numbers.
12.5  BENEFITS: * (REQUIRED)  Note: These are the benefits that the IRB will consider during their review. 
They are not necessarily appropriate to include in the consent form.
Possible immediate and/or direct benefits to participants and society at 
large (check all that apply):
Positive health outcome (e.g. improvement of condition, relief of pain, increased mobility, 
etc.)
Closer follow-up than standard care may lead to improved outcomes or patient engagement
Health and lifestyle changes may occur as a result of participation
Knowledge may be gained about their health and health conditions
Feeling of contribution to knowledge in the health or social sciences field
The research presents a reasonable opportunity to further the understanding, prevention, or 
alleviation of a serious problem affecting the health or welfare of children
Other benefit (describe below)
None
12.6  Explain why the risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated RISK TO BENEFIT RATIO: 
benefits, if any, to the participant or society:
The potential risks are outweighed by [CONTACT_909827]. Caregivers will receive caregiver self-
management and information on dementia caregiving skills, thus potentially can receive direct 
benefit from the study in terms of greater access to caregiving information and methods for 
relieving distress. The burden of participating in [ADDRESS_1277295] isolated, it would also be expected to be scalable in other low-resourced settings (e.g., in

Describe the plan for monitoring data quality and participant safety. Key 
areas that should be included in the plan are:
An explanation of the plan to monitor data collection, study progress, 
and safety
A description of who will perform the monitoring and at what 
frequency (e.g., the PI [INVESTIGATOR_13701], a contract research organization, a Data 
and Safety Monitoring Board or Data Monitoring Committee, etc.)
The type of data and events that will be reviewed (e.g., adverse 
events, breaches of confidentiality, unanticipated problems involving 
risk to participants or others, unblinded efficacy data, etc.)
Procedures and timeline for communicating monitoring results to the 
UCSF IRB, the study sponsor, and other appropriate entities
Assurance that the research team will adhere to the UCSF IRB 
reporting requirements
As appropriate:
A plan for conducting and reporting interim analysis
Clearly defined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_909768] a Data Safety and Monitoring Plan (DSMP) at the University of 
[LOCATION_004] San Francisco have been developed on a campus-wide basis in conjunction with the 
Institutional Review Board (called the Committee on Human Research at UCSF), the Office of the 
Vice-Chancellor for Research, and the Office of Clinical Research in the School of Medicine.  The 
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan for the proposed project incorporates the policies on human 
subject data and safety monitoring specified by [CONTACT_14231] (i.e. 
UCSF IRB).
 
1.         Risk Assessment – Minimal Risk
This study represents a minimal risk non-therapeutic behavioral intervention.  It encompasses a 
randomized controlled trial among 640 participants with the intervention tested being an online 
workshop ( ) that focuses on improving participants’ self-care practices Building Better Caregivers
and skills for dementia caregiving. Data collection is performed through use of online surveys and 
phone-based interviews. The Research Assistant (RA) will be trained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Yank, the PI, who is a

4.  
5.  self-management expert and practicing primary care physician, with expertise in chronic disease 
management and caregiver and self-management research.  In the course of the study, we will 
have several safeguards in place to quickly identify and respond to participants who we feel might 
require professional mental health assessment and services or other forms of medical assessment 
or care. To decrease the likelihood of an adverse event during the study, the RA will receive 
intensive training from the PI, [CONTACT_909862], and the Project Coordinator on procedures for reporting 
adverse events, how to recognize symptoms of clinical depression or anxiety, and the need to call 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_909761] a participant requires additional services from a mental health or 
health care professional. 
 
For participants who are randomized to receive the  workshop initially Building Better Caregivers
or who choose to attend it later after they have finished participation in the control group, during 
the workshop they will receive training on healthy self-care practices and perform self-efficacy 
building activities, including those that may improve their mental and physical well-being.  For 
example, the workshop contains modules on managing stress and difficult emotions including 
symptoms of anxiety, depression, anger, and fatigue. Participants may respond to these modules 
by [CONTACT_909812]/or disclosing their experiences of stress and difficult emotions. In light of 
this, the  workshop itself is staffed by [CONTACT_909828], 
which includes when and how to activate built-in safety protocols—such as contact [CONTACT_909829] a participant indicates they are at any risk for self-harm. 
Facilitators keep track of all participants by [CONTACT_909830] 6-week workshop. They also observe all online interactions and postings daily 
throughout the workshop. The activities of the facilitators are themselves reviewed by “Master 
Trainers” who monitor the fidelity, quality, and safety of workshop delivery. Workshop 
participants also receive training on how to contact [CONTACT_909831]. The workshop 
safety protocols already in place have been used successfully in the existing provision of a version 
of the workshop to over 3,000 caregivers of veterans by [CONTACT_909821] 
(see Preliminary Studies section of the Research Strategy for details on the workshop for veteran 
caregivers), with activations of the safety protocol being extremely rare (3 times in 24 months) 
with successful resolution with participant safety being assured in all cases. The Building Better 
 workshop safety protocol for the purpose of this study will include the addition of the Caregivers
study PI [INVESTIGATOR_909769].
 
In all cases when the PI [INVESTIGATOR_909763] a potential safety issue, whether by [CONTACT_272003], Project 
Coordinator, or the  workshop safety protocol, The PI [INVESTIGATOR_909770]. Adverse events will be graded according to their 
significance for severe consequences, such as injury or death. If the event is determined to be an 
AE that is moderate or higher in degree, [CONTACT_909862] will then contact [CONTACT_909832], make appropriate referrals, and follow-up with the participant and RA. The 
participant will have given previous consent for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_909765]/her directly when such an 
assessment is indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_909771]. Furthermore, study participants will have the full contact [CONTACT_909833], including email and telephone contact [CONTACT_8972], so that problems will be 
identified in a timely manner, and should be alleviated by [CONTACT_909826][INVESTIGATOR_909772].  Finally, at the time of enrollment in the study, the 
study team will provide participants with a list of health resources available to them, which will 
include mental health services and hotline numbers.
 
2.         Description of Adverse Event Grading and Anticipated Adverse Events
An adverse event (AE) is here defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, injury 
or disease temporarily associated with an intervention or procedure, regardless of whether it is 
considered related to an intervention or procedure that occurs during the course of the study. AEs 
will be scored as follows:
 
= No adverse event or within normal limits
= Mild AE – not requiring treatment/follow-up
= Moderate AE – resolved with follow-up
= Severe AE – resulted in inability to carry on normal activities, requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
= Life-threatening or disabling AE – results in an immediate risk of death and/or results in 
persistent or significant disability
= Fatal AE
1.  
2.  
3.  
4.   
Adverse events categorized as severe, life-threating/disabling, or fatal are by [CONTACT_909834]. Examples of the types of adverse events we might encounter in the proposed 
study are as follows:
 
Mild AE (ones that do not require treatment/follow-up): reports of depressive symptoms, 
anxiety, and stress that do not interfere with normal activities; fatigue from answering 
study questions (via online survey—and for a sub-set, phone-based interviews); 
frustration when learning to use the online workshop site; anxiety about the ability to 
complete activities for the workshop; and worry about loss of confidentiality/privacy.
Moderate AE (ones that resolve with treatment/follow-up): experiences of transient 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_909773], stress management, or usual care approaches.
Severe AE (ones that result in inability to carry on normal activities, those requiring 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]): patient is so anxious or depressed that they enter a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_735557]-
treatment facility.
Life-threating or disabling AD (ones involving immediate risk of death or persistent 
disability): participant threatening or attempting self-harm or harm to others. These 
events are extremely rare and occur more often in participants with a history of 
depression.
 
Given that the proposed intervention is behavioral and educational in nature, we anticipate that 
mild AEs will comprise the overwhelming majority of reported AEs.  The PI, in consultation with 
the research team, is responsible for evaluating each AE and for and for notifying the project’s 
Data and Safety Monitoring Board and the UCSF Committee on Human Research of the 
occurrence of adverse events.
 
3.         Description of Monitoring Study Progress and Safety of Human Subject 
Participants
The Principal Investigator (PI), Veronica Yank, has primary responsibility for the overall conduct 
of the study and for the safety of research participants.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_67416] (1) the informed 
consent process is conducted appropriately and that informed consent is obtained prior to 
proceeding with any study procedures; (2) only eligible subjects, per protocol eligibility criteria, 
are enrolled in the study; (3) data are collected and analyzed per protocol requirements; (4) 
procedures are implemented to ensure that the project is consistently monitored for possible 
adverse events; (5) adverse events are reviewed promptly and reported as required to the UCSF 
Committee on Human Research (CHR) (i.e., UCSF IRB); and (6) the privacy and confidentiality of 
study subjects is maintained.  While implementation of aspects of the DSMP may be delegated to 
members of the research team, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_909774]. 
 
The Research Team of PI, Co-Is/Consultants (Drs. Kate Lorig, Ken Covinksy, Catherine Chesla, 
Leah Karliner, Jing Cheng, Dolores Gallagher Thompson, and Nancy Fahrenwald), Project 
Coordinator, Data Analyst, and RA will meet quarterly by [CONTACT_909835]. These discussions may involve 
adverse event prevention measures, subject accrual issues, research staff training on protection 
of human subjects, as well as occurrence of adverse events.
 
The Data Safety Monitoring Plan provides for an external, objective Data and Safety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB). The DSMB will meet on a scheduled basis as outlined in the DSMB Charter below. 
The DSMB will review on a scheduled basis reports prepared by [CONTACT_978], statistician, and data 
management staff on the progress of the project including data on enrollments, comparison of 
target to actual enrollment, overall status of the study participants, information on race/ethnicity, 
gender, adverse events, serious adverse events and other information listed in the DSMB Charter 
below. The DSMB will also determine whether additional effort is required to foster the progress 
of the study, whether adverse events were scored and dealt with appropriately (i.e., was the 
safety and health of the subject addressed, did the subject receive medical attention or medical 
referral as needed, etc.) and whether adverse events were correctly and immediately reported to 
the UCSF Committee on Human Research. The DSMB will determine whether the study should 
continue, be terminated, or be modified based on observed beneficial or adverse effects.
 
4.         Plans for Assuring Compliance with Requirements Regarding the Reporting of 
Adverse Events
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_909775], to the DSMB, and to the 
CHR.  Mild and moderate adverse events will be reported within [ADDRESS_1277297] adverse events when they 
occur or immediately after they occur to insure the safety of the human subjects; and to report 
adverse events to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a timely manner to insure compliance with institutional policies on 
human subject protection. This also means that research assistants engaged in data collection will 
be able to contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_909776]. Specifically, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_909777]: 1) all severe adverse events 
associated with the study procedures, and/or 2) any incidents or problems involving the conduct 
of the study or patient participation, including problems with the recruitment and/or consent 
processes and/or education of participants about managing stress and copi[INVESTIGATOR_909778]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_909779] a written report of adverse events of moderate or greater 
severity during the course of the study to the CHR on an annual basis.
 
Severe adverse events are very rare in persons engaging in self-management and educational 
activities, although it is possible that a person with previously unidentified depression, anxiety 
disorder, or other mental illness may experience an aggravation during times of stress.  We will 
stop the study based on instructions from the DSMB or CHR, which will be notified immediately if 
a participant in this study experiences a severe adverse event while enrolled in the study.
 
5.         Plans for Performance of Safety Reviews, for Assuring Data Accuracy and 
Security, and Assuring Protocol Compliance
Safety reviews will be performed by [CONTACT_909836].  Under the direction of the PI, 
the security of the data will be safe guarded. As part of the data management and analysis plan, 
all of the data files will be kept in a secure, locked file. All computer data will likewise be 
protected. Data will be entered directly into a computer and files will be matched to verify the 
accuracy of the data. Data will be entered into data files by [CONTACT_283941]. 
Participants’ names will be separated from the data and kept in a locked file cabinet. Access to 
the file cabinet will be strictly controlled by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1238] a project director.  The co-investigators will 
have access to this information only in the event of an adverse event.
 
To assure protocol compliance, the UCSF School of Medicine Office of Research will conduct an 
audit of the project on a periodic basis and evaluate compliance with adverse events reporting 
and the data safety and monitoring plan as outlined in the proposal.
 
6.         Steps Emanating from Data Review
The review of data may result in early termination of the study (see stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_909780]), in protocol amendment, or in changes to the data collection plan or study forms. Should 
the protocol be amended as a result of data review, the UCSF CHR will be notified and the 
amendment approved prior to study amendment implementation unless the protocol amendment 
must be implemented to protect the immediate safety of the study subjects. In such a case, the 
protocol amendment will be immediately implemented and the UCSF CHR will be notified directly 
after protocol amendment implementation.
 
7.         Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_909781] a significantly large number of adverse events.
 
8.         Plans for Reporting Temporary or Permanent Suspension of a Funded Clinical 
Trial

e., the Program Officer responsible for the grant), any temporary or permanent suspension of the 
project and the reason for the suspension.
 
 
 
DSMB CHARTER
 
This Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) will act in an advisory capacity to the NIH to 
monitor participant safety and evaluate the efficacy of the intervention that is described in the 
research plan.
 
After the DSMB is formed, the initial tasks of the DSMB are to:
Review the entire IRB-approved study protocol and the Manual of Procedures, with regard 
to subject safety, recruitment, randomization, intervention, data management, quality 
control and analysis and the informed consent document with regard to applicability and 
readability.
Recommend changes to the protocol to the PI.
Identify the relevant data parameters and the format of the information to be regularly 
reported.
Recommend subject recruitment be initiated after receipt of a satisfactory protocol. If the 
need for modifications to the protocol, the MOP, consent form, or anything else is 
indicated by [CONTACT_28011]/or the Program Administrator, the DSMB will postpone its 
recommendation for the initiation of subject recruitment until after the receipt of 
satisfactory revised protocol(s), etc.
 
After completion of these initial tasks, The DSMB will meet on a regular schedule approximately 
two times a year (with additional meetings as needed). Meetings may be convened as conference 
calls as well as in person.  DSMB meetings will be attended by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_909783], 
NIA program staff and the DSMB members. During closed sessions of the DSMB meetings only 
DSMB members and the NIA Program Officer may attend. The DSMB may request that a 
designated individual from the study (often the study’s biostatistician) who has been approved to 
have access to unmasked data will also attend the closed session. At these regular meetings, the 
DSMB tasks are to:
Review masked or unmasked data as needed and appropriate during the trial.
These data can be related to efficacy, recruitment, randomization, compliance, retention, 
protocol adherence, trials operating procedures, form completion, intervention effects, 
gender and minority inclusion, and subject safety.
Identify problems relating to safety during the study.
Identify needs for additional data relevant to safety issues, and request these data from 
the study investigators.
Propose appropriate analyses and periodically review developi[INVESTIGATOR_482210].
Semi-annually (and on other occasions if necessary), consider the rationale for 
continuation of the study, with respect to progress of randomization, retention, protocol 
adherence, data management, safety issues, and outcome data (if relevant) and make a 
recommendation for or against the trial's continuation.
Review and make recommendations on proposed protocol changes, and or new protocols 
proposed during the trial.
Send written reports following each DSMB meeting to the Program Officer and PI. Send 
additional reports on all issues reviewed by [CONTACT_909837].
Provide timely advice on issues regarding data discrepancies found by [CONTACT_531177].
Review manuscripts of trial results as requested; the NIA Program Officer may seek DSMB 
review of manuscripts reporting major outcomes prior to submission for publication.
 
Membership
The Data Safety Monitoring Board is expected to consist of [ADDRESS_1277298]. If necessary, an executive session may be requested by [CONTACT_909838]. The NIA Program Officer is not permitted to 
attend the executive sessions.
 
Reports

information on study aspects such as accrual, baseline characteristics, and other general 
information on study status. Part 2 (Closed Session Report) will contain data on study outcomes 
and safety data. Data files to be used for interim analyses will have undergone established editing 
procedures to the greatest extent possible.

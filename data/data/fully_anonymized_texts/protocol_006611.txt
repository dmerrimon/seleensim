Planned Analyses
1. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Background and Specific Aims
Dietary assessment is used to determine the nutrient intake of individuals and groups.  Accurate1
dietary assessment is essential to nutrition research to understand how diet impacts health.[ADDRESS_1092130] a systematic bias, in which populations with obesity are more
likely to underreport intake.  Subjective methods are also labor-intensive in regards to data5-12
collection and/or analysis.  Objective dietary assessment can limit human errors and provide ,[ADDRESS_1092131]. Thus, there is a need for a 
wearable device that has the function of passive image capturing, with complete automated 
image analysis software to provide accurate and inexpensive dietary information.
Therefore, the purpose of this investigation is to validate a passive image-assisted dietary 
assessment method using images taken by [CONTACT_792139], DietCam, to identify food items and estimate portion sizes. The specific aims 
of this investigation are: 1) to determine the accuracy of DietCam in identifying foods in different 
shapes (Regular vs Irregular) and complexities (Single food vs Mixed food); and 2) to determine 
the accuracy of DietCam to estimate food volumes comparing with weighed food intake 
measured from plate waste method.
2. STUDY POPULATION
Study Design
To validate the accuracy of DietCam in analyzing food images taken by [CONTACT_792140], a 2x2x2x2x3 mixed factorial design will be used, with a
between-subject factor of the order of meals (Order 1 and 2) and within-subject factors of food
shapes (Regular and Irregular), food complexities (Single food and Mixed food), meals (Meal A
and B), and methods of measurement (DietCam, weighed food intake [WFI], and 24-hour dietary
recall) (see Table 1). Individuals will be randomized into one of the two orders of meals. In each
meal, participants will be given a meal that includes a regular-shaped single food (i.e., cookie),
an irregular-shape single food (i.e., ice cream), a regular-shaped mixed food (i.e., sandwich),
and irregular-shaped mixed food (i.e., pasta dish). Dependent variables will be the identification
of foods and amount of foods consumed .

Participants
Thirty men and women will be invited to participate in the validation study. Eligibility of this 
investigation will be based upon the following criteria: 1) between the ages of 18 and 65 years; 
2) body mass index (BMI) 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m 3) no food allergies/intolerance to foods used in2;  
the investigation; 4) report not having a dietary plan or dietary restrictions that prevents
consumption of the foods used in the investigation; 5) report a favorable preference for the
foods served in the meal (listed in Table 2), with participants rate each food item ³ 3 on a Likert
scale during the phone screen; 6) able to complete all two meal sessions within four weeks of 
the screening session; 7) are not legally blind without corrected lenses; and 8) are able to eat a 
meal while wearing the Sony Smarteyeglass. Participants will be excluded if they wear electronic 
medical devices such as pacemakers and implantable defibrillators. 
Recruitment
Participants will be recruited from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville campus by [CONTACT_792141]. Participants will be asked to contact [CONTACT_792142] (HEAL) by [CONTACT_792143] a study that 
investigates dietary assessment via digital images. Interested participants will be screened over 
the phone and scheduled for a face-to-face screening session. Participants who sign the consent 
form at the screening session and meet eligibility criteria will be randomized to one of two orders.
3. STUDY PROCEDURES
Procedures
All participants will be asked to come to HEAL for 1, 30-minute screening session, and then for 2,
40-minute meal sessions, with approximately one week occurring between each session.
Sessions will be scheduled between 11:00am and 5:00pm, Monday to Friday. During the
screening session, interested participants will sign the consent form. After signing the consent
from, eligibility will be confirmed by [CONTACT_792144]. Participants will also be
given questionnaires related to demographics. Prior to the start of the first meal session, eligible
participants will be randomized to one of the two orders described in Table 1, using a random
numbers table.  Participants will be instructed for the meal sessions to stop eating a minimum of
two hours prior to the scheduled meal sessions and only consume water during that period.
During both meal sessions, instructions on how to use Sony Smarteyeglass will be provided to
participants. These instructions will include how to wear and use the eyeglasses. Participants will
be instructed that, after putting on the Smarteyeglass, to initiate the recording via the controller
of the Sony Smarteyeglass. After the recording is initiated and prior to starting to eat,
participants will be instructed to look at each provided food at the table. Then, participants will
also be instructed to turn their head toward the left shoulder, look at each food from the side,
and then repeat the same step for turning their head toward the right shoulder. Participants will
be asked to start the meal by [CONTACT_792145].  For the first bite of each
food, participants will be instructed to hold the food, either in their hand or on a fork or spoon
(depending on the food), approximately [ADDRESS_1092132]
the room while the participant is eating. The investigator will check in with participants every 10
minutes. At the end of 30 minutes, participants will be instructed to again look at each provided
food on the table at three different angles (looking straight at each food, from left side and the
right side) following the exact same procedure at the beginning of the meal. The second meal
session will follow the same procedure as the first session.
On the day following each meal session, participants will be called to complete a 24-hour dietary
recall, which will take 20 minutes to complete. Instructions will be provided to participants at the
end of each meal session about how to complete the dietary recall and a two-dimensional visual
aid will be provided to aid participants in estimating the consumed portions for each food and
beverage item consumed.
At the end of second meal session, participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire to
provide feedback on their use of the Sony Smarteyeglass. After the second session is completed,
the participants will be thanked for their participation and given a $[ADDRESS_1092133] and second meal session, the meals will contain foods that are categorized into two
food shapes (Regular and Irregular) and two food complexities (Single food and Mixed food).
Each meal will contain four foods (see Table 2 for detailed description of foods), with the four
foods representing the four potential food categories (regular-shaped single food, irregular-
shaped single food, regular-shaped mixed food, irregular-shaped mixed food). Along with the
four foods, participants will be given 20oz of water in each meal session. Foods will be weighed
prior to being provided to participants and the amount provided to participants will be within +/-
3g of the amount described in Table 3. Mixed foods will be broken down into their individual food
components and measured. Each meal will provide approximately 50% of daily estimated energy
need for each sex. The Estimated Calories Needed Per Day for males and females aged 19 to 35
years are 2450 kcal/day and 1900 kcal/day, respectively.  Thus, each meal will provide22
approximately 1225 kcal for males and 950 kcal for females. Each food will provide
approximately 25% of the energy for each meal.

Measures
All measures will be collected at HEAL by [CONTACT_49165].
Anthropometrics: Weight, height, and BMI- During the initial phone screen height and weight will 
be asked by [CONTACT_792146]. During the initial 
screening session, weight will be assessed by [CONTACT_792147], and height will be assessed 
using a stadiometer, using standard procedures, with participants wearing light clothing, without 
shoes.23  BMI (kg/m2) will be calculated from these measures. A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is 
required to be eligible for this study.
Demographics - At the initial screening session, basic demographic information (e.g., gender, 
age, education level) will be obtained.
Sony Smarteyeglass – Digital images will be recorded during each meal session using Sony 
Smarteyeglass. Number of blurred images and times that Sony Smarteyeglass fail to capturing 
images will be documented.
Weighed Food Intake- Before and after each meal session, each food items will be weighed to 
the nearest tenth of a gram using an electronic food scale. The weight of the containers will also 
be measured. The total grams of each food items will be recorded and total food consumed will 
be calculated by [CONTACT_792148]-meal weight. Results of total grams 
of each food items and total food consumed will be entered into Nutrition Data System for 
Research (NDS-R) dietary software developed by [CONTACT_88246], University of 
Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.
DietCam- DietCam is developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. JinDong Tan and colleagues24 and is an application 
designed to automatically recognize foods and estimate volumes of a meal from images or 
videos. DietCam has an algorithm called multi-view food classification that recognizes foods and 
beverages in images or videos and estimates volumes without any reference objects.24 DietCam 
has the average accuracy rate of 84% in recognizing regular shape food items.24 DietCam will 
be used to analysis digitial images taken by [CONTACT_792149]. In this investigation, DietCam will be used to identify 
food items with different shapes (Regular vs Irregular) and complexities (Single food vs Mixed 
food).  DietCam will also be used to estimate volume of foods in the unit of cubic meters (m3). 
Results of volume estimation of foods from DietCam will be entered to NDS-R to convert to 
commonly used measurements.
24-hour Dietary Recall - On the following day of each meal session, the investigator will ask the  
participant to recall their dietary intake by [CONTACT_792150] 24 hours.  
Participants will be asked what time of day the foods and beverages were consumed and will be  
shown two-dimensional food shapes to help with estimating portion sizes. Only dietary intake for  
the meal session will be entered into NDS-R to convert to commonly used measurements.  
Participants’ Feedback- At the end of last meal session, participants will be asked to complete a  
questionnaire regarding their experience on using Sony Smarteyeglass. A total of six structured  
questions will be included in the questionnaire and each question will be associated with an open-
ended question. Structured questions will consist of a five-scale rating regarding ease of use,  
clearness of instructions, satisfaction, likelihood, and comfortableness. Percentages of  
participants answering in responses to each structured question will be tabulated and open-
ended questions will be summarized.

1.0 Objectives 
 
This study plans to address the following hypotheses:  
 
1.1 The addition of Ibandronate initiated immediately after the transplantation (21 to 60 
days) will prevent bone loss in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow 
transplantation (BMT) with underlying hematologic malignancies  or hematological 
disord ers. 
 
1.[ADDRESS_751536] Diseases (GVHD) have a higher rate of bone loss, which can 
be prevented or attenuated by [CONTACT_572349].  
 
Specific objectives to test these hypotheses are:  
a. Primary Objective:  
1. To prospectively compare the bone mineral density changes of lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], femoral 
neck and total hip between patients randomly assigned to I bandronate and control  group 
over [ADDRESS_751537] bone marrow transplantation at the Uni versity of [LOCATION_007] MD 
Anderson Cancer Center.  
b. Secondary Objectives:  
1.   To measure and compare the accumulated level of steroid used in both treatment and                       
control  groups. 
2. To collect and compare the level of serum C -terminal telopept ide (CT X) in both 
treatment and control  groups to monitor the bone turnover rate for the duration of the 
study. 
3. To conduct a cost -effectiveness analysis of participating patients for both outcomes on 
bone mineral density (measured data) and skeletal -related events (modeled data).  
4. To record incidence of bone fractures and the graft  rate in both treatment and control  
groups.  
 
 
2.0 Background  
 
Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is performed with increasing frequency and for expanding indications, with the majority of patients surviving for many years.  In this context, bone loss is a 
common and serious post -transplant complication.  Bone loss, occurs early and most rapi[INVESTIGATOR_572337], and is often more severe at th e 
femoral neck (1, 2).  The degree of bone loss can be severe enough to cause fractures.   Lower

bone mineral density in femoral neck in this population has also been associated with avascular 
osteonecrosis (3).  
 
Osteoporosis developed after BMT has a comp lex mechanism involving both the direct effect of 
the transplanted bone marrow on the stromal cell compartment and the effects from 
immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (3).  As a result of the decreased osteoblast and increased osteoclast 
activity, there is both increased bone resorption and decreased bone formation.  After the 
transplantation, over 50% of BMT patients develop some form of Graft Versus Host Disease 
(GVHD), which requires prolonged use of glucocorticoid as well as other forms of 
immunosuppression.   In addition, BMT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_572338] (4), that is related to their underlying disease and the modalities used to treat 
them.  Their prior treatment may result in a variety of effects associated with bon e loss, including 
glucocorticoid- induced decreases in bone formation and serum 1,[ADDRESS_751538] 6 months before the treatment, spi[INVESTIGATOR_572339] (B MD) did not change significantly in patients on Risedronate 
and decreased in those taking placebo (5).   However, this study did not answer the question of whether bisphosphonates could prevent the rapid bone loss commonly seen during the first three 
months post -BMT.   In another uncontrolled observational study, three monthly intravenous 
Pamidronate infusions attenuated femoral neck bone loss in the first six months after allogeneic 
BMT (2).  In a recent randomized, controlled study in patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation, using Pamidronate initiated before the transplantation decreased the bone loss 
significantly at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], hip, and the femoral neck.  However there was still significant bone loss at the hip and femoral neck th at was not completely prevented by [CONTACT_572350], 
warranting the use of a more potent bisphosphonate for more durable maintenance of bone mass 
after transplantation (6).  
 
Ibandronate (Boniva) has been shown to significantly increase bone mineral density in t he lumbar 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_572340].  Compared to placebo, Ibandronate taken orally at 150 mg once monthly or 3 mg intravenously quarterly significantly increased bone 
mineral density and decreased the rate of new vertebral fractures (7).  Ibandronate is more potent 
than other bisphosphonates such as Pamidronate, Risedronate and Alendronate.  
 
So far there is no consensus on how to effectively prevent and treat osteoporosis associated with 
bone marrow transplantation.  As for steroid induced osteoporosis, the American College of 
Rheumatology Ad Hoc Committee on Glucocorticoid- Induced Osteoporosis recommends 
obtaining a baseline measurement of bone mineral density at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_20793]/or hip when initiating long -term (i.e., in a dose  of 5 mg/day or higher for more than 3 months) glucocorticoid 
therapy with longitudinal follow ups.  The committee also recommends bisphosphonates used in such patients in conjunction with calcium and vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of 
osteoporosis (8).  Such consensus has not been tested in cancer patients receiving BMT.  
 
Although there are known risk factors of osteoporosis associated with bone marrow transplantation and the subsequent immunosuppressive treatment, guidelines for the preventio n 
and effective treatment of bone loss in this high risk population are lacking. Data on whether therapy for osteoporosis treatment or prevention initiated around the time of the transplantation 
reduces fracture risk after transplantation is limited.  Bisp hosphonates, in particular, suppress 
  
Protocol# 2006- [ADDRESS_751539] -transplant bone loss.  
Moreover, anti -resorptive therapy clearly increased bone mineral density and reduces fracture in 
other populations, including patients undergoing solid organ transplant.  Given such, this proposal 
is designed for the prevention of osteoporosis in this high risk population.

4.0 Treatment/study  Plan  
 
  
Protocol# 2006- [ADDRESS_751541] their 25(OH) Vit D levels 
checked.  Patient with vitamin D deficiency (< 20 ng/ml) will be supp lemented to adequate level 
(>= 2 0 ng/ml).  
 
Patients will then be randomized into the following two groups: 1) treatment:  Ibandronate 3 mg 
intravenously over 15- 30 seconds for 4 doses at 0- 1.5, 3, 6, and 9 months free of charge; or 2) 
control: Patients will only recei ve daily oral calcium and vitamin D supplements.  Patient’s prior 
vitamin D supplement status will be considered as one of the randomization factor.  After 
entering the trial, all patients will receive 500 mg of elemental calcium carbonate and Vitamin D 
Analog 400 IU orally twice daily for 12 months to be taken at home during the trial.  Patients who 
do not tolerate the calcium pi[INVESTIGATOR_572341]/vitamin D at home as tolerated with equivalent dosing.   Patients who are still on weekly 
Ergocalciferol have the option of holding their daily vitamin D [ADDRESS_751542] 
resume the daily vitamin D when they are off the weekly Ergocalciferol.  
 
BMD at lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], femoral neck and total hip will be dete rmined at baseline (up to 3 months 
prior to the transplant or prior to the enrollment) , 6, 12 months (+/ - 4 weeks) post transplants for 
all patients in both groups by [CONTACT_572351].  The change of BMD between baseline and [ADDRESS_751543] data and/or blood for the following:  
1. Bone turnover marker, the serum CTX will be measure d at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 m onths (+/ - 4 
weeks)  
 
2. Routine laboratory monitoring includes calcium, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, 
and creatinine at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months (+/ - 4 weeks) post -transplant.  
 
3. Other factors affecting bone metabolism will be me asured which include 25(OH) Vit D and 
intact PTH levels at baseline (as part of pre- transplant workup, or prior to the enrollment ) and at 
the end of the trial. If a patient was found to have vitamin D deficiency 3 months  prior to the 
transplant and if a pa tient had  been on weekly  Ergocalciferol supplement, the patient will be 
eligible for this study and their vitamin D supplementation status will be considered as one of the randomization factor .  Patient had prior Ergocalciferol supplement are randomized to  either 
treatment or control group  following the stratum 1 of the Randomization Scheme, Appendix F.  
Patients with no prior Ergocalciferol supplement  are randomized according to the stratum 2 of the 
Randomization Scheme, Appendix F.  
 Sex hormones will be m easured at the baseline ( -/+ 8 weeks) and the 12 months ( -/+ 8 weeks) 
(Testosterone or Estradiol, FSH and LH).  Female patients who have documented laboratory  
values indicating postmenopausal state prior to the study entry will not be required to have new 
level s drawn. Female patients whose sex hormone levels showing menopausal state at baseline 
will not have repeat sex hormone study at the end of the trial.   Serum for future research will also

5.0 Statistical Consideration  
 
This is a randomized phase III trial to determine whether the use of Ibandronate significantly 
decreases the amount of bone loss in patients with BMT, compared to those in the control group.  Patients will be equally randomized to control or treat ment groups at baseline  All transplant 
patients will receive oral calcium 500  mg and vitamin D 400 IU twice daily throughout the trial.  
 The primary endpoint is the percent reduction in bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], femoral neck, and total hip measured at 12 month relative to baseline, which we denote 
here as Diff _BMD.  Assuming that the mean Diff_BMD is 12% decrease in the control group and 
is 0.1% in the treatment (Ibandronate) group, a maximum of 120 patients (60 patients per group) 
  
Protocol# 2006- [ADDRESS_751546] an 80% power to detect this difference at a two -sided significance 
level of 0.05, assuming a common standard deviation of 0.23. Assuming a drop- out rate of 40% 
for the patients due to mortality and relapse in the first year, a maximum of [ADDRESS_751547] been accrued into the study and 
followed for one year, respectively.  A Lan -DeMets spending function with O’Brian- Fleming 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_572342]. The two- sided Z -score cut -off values for rejecting the null 
hypothesis are +/ - 3.71 and +/ - 2.[ADDRESS_751548] at 
different time points and if the pattern of BMD change over time differs between two groups.  
Similar analysis will also be performed for graft rate, serum C-telopeptide (CTX)  measured over 
time, as well as for cytokines associated with bone loss. The incidence rate of fracture will be 
estimated for each arm and will be compared between the two arms using Fisher’s exact test . 
 
The change of BMD between baseline and [ADDRESS_751549] will be used to assess the difference in BMD change between 
patients with and without prolonged steroid and other immunosuppressant use for the treatment of 
GVHD, either in all patients or by [CONTACT_1570].  A multiple linear model will be fit for the 
BMD at 12 months, adjusting for baselin e BMD and using steroid doses in GVHD, treatment as 
well as steroid use in GVHD and treatment interaction as predictors.  
 
We will summarize the change of BMD between baseline and 12 months by [CONTACT_55542] (i.e., 
hematological malignancies vs. hematological  disorders). Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to 
assess the difference in BMD change between patients with hematological malignancies and those with hematological disorders.  A multiple linear model will be fit for the BMD at [ADDRESS_751550] is similar in these two disease types.  
 Based on already published data (9) on risk of skeletal -related events (SRE) with ibandronate, 
modeling will be conducted to determine cost -effectiveness ratio of cost per SRE avoided, with 
sensitivity analysis.  Costs will include the potential cost of treating for SREs and the potential 
cost of treat ing adverse events due to i.v. I bandronate.  One -way sensitivity analysis varying the 
key assumption (SRE relative risk reduction rate from 0% to 50% in 5% intervals) over the base case will be conducted to determine if it might  impact the cost -effectiveness ratio.

5.2 Safety Monitoring  
In addition, a safety monitoring rule will be implemented using the method of Thall, Simon and 
Estey (1995, 1996). We define the adverse event (AE) as “the percent reduction in BMD is 
greater than or equal to 15% from baseline to 6 months” and denote its probability as p.  The trial 
will be stopped if, for any arm, there is more than 95% chance that p is greater than 30%, ie, stop 
the trial if Prob (p >20% | data) > 0.95. For each arm, assuming a beta (1, 1 ) prior and applying 
the above stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_572343] [ADDRESS_751553] been t reated and evaluated after 1 -year 
follow -up, the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_572344]:  The trial will be stopped if for any one of the 
two arms, [# patients with AE] / [# patients evaluated at 6  months] >=6/10, 10/20, 14/30, 17/40, 
21/50, 24/60.   
Osteonecro sis, primarily in the jaw, has been reported in patients treated with bisphosphonates. 
Most cases have been in cancer patients undergoing dental procedures, but some have occurred in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis or other diagnoses. All patient s will have dental 
screening for jaw osteonecrosis at baseline and every 6 months thereafter.  Patients with recent 
tooth extraction and signs of incomplete healing and/or uncontrolled infection will be excluded.  
During the trial, any dental condition should be treated immediately but conservatively, avoiding 
any invasive surgical procedure.

5.4     Benefit  
 
Bone marrow transplantation is performed with increasing fre quency and success, with the 
majority of patients surviving for many years.  In this context, bone loss is a common and serious 
  
Protocol# 2006- [ADDRESS_751557] three to 
six months after the transplantation, and is often more severe at the femoral neck.  This study will 
address the issue of whether bisphosphonates given immediately following the transplant can 
prevent the early bone loss.   Since bone loss is tightly correlated with the fracture risk, early 
prevention of bone loss potentially prevent the fracture later in patient’s life.   
 
We plan on presenting our findings at national and international meetings and publishing these in peer-reviewed journals.  This work will contribute to the managemen t of post -transplant bone loss 
and may facilitate other intervention studies to address such issues.

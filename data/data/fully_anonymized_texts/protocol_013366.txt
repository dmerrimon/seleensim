2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia  
 
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is one of the most aggressive adult leukemias.  
Each year more than six thousand are diagnosed with ALL in the US (1).  One of the 
most commonly used regimens for  ALL typi[INVESTIGATOR_259716] -CVAD, a regimen consisting 
of cycles of high dose cyclophosphamide, vincristine , doxorubicin and dexamethasone 
alternating with methotrexate and cytarabine, with or withou t the addition of a Bcr/abl 
kinase inhibitor depending upon the presence or absence of a t(9;22) chromosomal 
translocation  (2, 3).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_259717], more than half of these patients 
will not sur vive past four years from diagnosis.  Accordingly, there has been substantial 
interest in testing  new therapeutic agents for ALL, including various monoclonal 
antibodies, N OTCH1 inhibitors , hypomethylating agents such as decitabine, folic acid 
antagonists,  flavopi[INVESTIGATOR_106540], bortezomib, and mTOR inhibitors  (4, 5).  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_259718] , relapsed ALL is very resistant to available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   
In a retrospective study, O’B rien et al reported an 18% complete remission (CR) rate and 
a 3-month median survival rate for relapsed ALL treated at MD Anderson with various 
regimens (6).  Moreover, because the median age at onset for adult ALL is roughly age 
65 (7), a substantial proportion of patients are not candidates for rigorous therapy such as 
hyper -CVAD.  Therefore, novel and targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_259719].   Finally, patients who relapse afte r allogeneic bone marrow transplant pose a 
difficult therapeutic dilemma , coupled with graft versus host disease and/or  difficulty to 
find a second donor, making them suitable candidate s for clinical trials  of novel agents . 
 
2.2 MLN0128 (TAK -228) 
 
2.2.1 Mechanism of Action  
 
MLN0128 (TAK -228) is an inhibitor of the mechanistic  target of rapamycin (mTOR).  
This serine/threonine kinase is a major integrator of various types of signals within cells 
(8). Two distinct complexes exist, mTOR complex 1 and 2 (TORC1 and TORC2) (9). 
TORC1 phos phorylates p70 S6 kinase and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E 
(eIF4E) binding protein 1 (4EBP1) to regulate protein synthesis and, indirectly, 
progression from G1 into S phase, while TORC2 phosphorylates AKT  on Ser473, 
contributing to activation of this kinase and affecting survival pathways. MLN0128 
(TAK -228) (previously called MLN0128 ; INK -128) has been shown to target both 
mTORC1 and mTORC2  (10-14), which is thought to provide improved inhibition of 
mTOR and enhanced cytotoxicity in lymphoid malignancies as described below.  
 
MLN0128 (TAK -228) inhibited m TOR  kinase in vitro with an IC [ADDRESS_315893] class I, class II and class III phosphatidylinositol -3 
(PI3) kinase activit ies as well as PI4 kinase isoforms (15).  Among a panel of 222 protein 
kinases, TAK -228 inhibited only 4 kinases (DNA -PK, PDGFR α, Flt3 and CK1 ε) in 
addition to mTOR by 80% at 1 µM.

2.2.2 Nonclinical Studies  
 
Preclinical efficacy studies  (15): MLN0 128 (TAK -228), like other dual mTOR inhibitors, 
inhibits proliferation in a wide range of human tumor  cell lines  in vitro .  In particular, 
when examined in 105 cell lines, MLN0128 (TAK -228) inhibited growth  with IC 50 
values ranging from 1 nM (SW620 colorectal cancer cells) to 2700 nM (HepG2 
hepatoma cells).   
 
Immunoblotting studies in PC -[ADDRESS_315894] cancer,  786-O renal cell 
carcinoma lines  and multiple myeloma cell lines  demonstrated that MLN0128 (T AK-
228) inhibits phosphorylation of the translation inhibitor 4EBP1 (an mTORC1 substrate) 
and the serine/threonine kinase AKT  (Ser473, an mTORC2 substrate) in intact cells, with 
almost complete inhibition at 100 nM (10, 16).  In contrast, the allosteric mTORC1 
inhibitor rapamycin inhibited phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 (downstream of another 
mTORC1 substrate p70 S6 kinase) but had little impact on either 4EBP1 or AKT  Ser473 
phosphorylation.  Likewise, when administered to mic e bearing U87G glioblastoma 
xenografts, MLN0128 (TAK -228) inhibited phosphorylation of 4EBP1, ribosomal 
protein S6 and AKT  Ser473 at 1, 2, 4 and 8 hours, although some recovery of signal was 
observed at 24 h.  
 
In vivo efficacy studies in mice bearing of hu man tumor xenografts, including U87MG 
(PTEN -mutan t glioblastoma), A549 ( KRAS/LKB 1-mutant NSCLC), ZR -75-1 (PTEN -
mutant breast cancer), MDA -MB361 ( PIK3CA/HER2 -mutant breast cancer), 786 -O 
(PTEN/VHL -mutant renal cell carcinoma) and HEC -1 (PIK3CA/KRAS -mutant 
endometrial cancer) MLN0128 (TAK -228) demonstrated strong tumor growth inhibition 
at tolerable oral doses ranging from 0.15 mg/kg/d to 3 mg/kg every other day or 3 mg/kg 
every week.    
 
Preclinical  toxicology studies : Preclinical toxicology studies were performed in rats and 
monkeys.  The dose -limiting toxicities in single -agent toxicology studies in both species 
were GI distress, decreased activity, hypothermia, decreased food intake, hyperglycemia, 
hyperinsulinemia, a nd lymphoid depletion.  
 
In 28 -day GLP -compliant toxicology studies, rats treated with 3.0 mg/kg MLN0128 
(TAK -228) exhibited reduced body weights compared to controls; increases in aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) that was attributed to nonspecific muscle injury (creatine kinase 
was also higher in affected animals); increases in glucose and insulin; decreases in 
leukocytes, lymphocytes, and eosinophils; and microscopic changes in the bone marrow    
(hypocellularity), thymus (lymphoid necrosis), testes (degen eration/atrophy), 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_26612]  (oligospermia), nonglandular stomach (epi[INVESTIGATOR_59460]/ulceration/ 
hyperplasia; males  only), and lungs (alveolar histiocytosis).  
 
In 28 -day GLP -compliant toxicology studies in cyn omolgus monkeys, MLN0128 (TAK -
228)-related effects observed at 0.30 mg/kg included decreased body weight, appetite, 
activity, and body temperature, abnormal posture, and skin cold to touch.  Two of 10

NCI Version Date:  October 2, [ADDRESS_315895], creatine kinase MM  isoform, 
cholesterol, triglycerides, and insulin, and decreased serum sodium, potassium, and  
phosphor ous.  Hematology parameter alterations consisted of decreased lymphocytes  
(females only) and increased leukocytes and neutrophils, with sporadic increases in  
monocytes and eosinophils.   Microscopic changes at 0.15 and 0.3 mg/kg were seen in the 
thymus, spleen, lymph nodes,  gut-associated lymphoid tissue (0.30 mg/kg only), bone 
marrow, adrenal glan ds, salivary glands, pancreas, GI tract, and skin (0.3 mg/kg only).   
Specific MLN0128 (TAK -228)-related microscopic findings in the lymphoid organs,  
including gut-associated lymphoid tissue , were multicentric lymphoid depletion and 
splenic red pulp depleti on.  At 0.30 mg/kg, the spleen had moderate to severe depletion of 
RBCs and hematopoietic cells.   These changes correlated with decreased spleen weights 
in males at 0.30 mg/kg and  decreased thymus weights in females at 0.15 and 0.30 mg/kg.   
Other microscop ic changes included mixed cell depletion in bone marrow; minimal to 
moderate bilateral cortical  hyperplasia in adrenals ( thought to be  stress induced ); acinar 
cell secretory depletion  in the pancreas, parotid and mandibular  salivary glands (thought 
possibl y due to decreased food consumption); erosion/ulceration, edema, hemorrhage, 
and acute  inflammation  of the cardia and pylorus of the stomach; and mild and spora dic 
changes in the duodenum, jejunum, colon,  and rectum.   At 0.3 mg/kg, some monkeys 
exhibited mild to moderate erosion/ulceration and minimal to  moderate epi[INVESTIGATOR_259720], neck, and forelimbs.   Electr ocardiograph y 
demonstrated no MLN0128 (TAK -228)-related effects, consistent with lack of  significant 
findings i n a GLP -compliant cardiovascular  safety pharmacology study conducted in  
conscious monkeys.  
 
2.2.3 Clinical S tudies   
 
MLN0128 (TAK -228) has been evaluated in two single -agent oral dose -finding studies, 
one in patients with advanced solid malignancies and one in patients with relapsed and/or 
refractory multiple myeloma, non -Hodgkin lymphoma, and Waldenstrom’s 
macroglobulinemia.  
 
In INK128 -001, single -agent MLN0128 (TAK -228) has been administered to patients 
with advanced solid tumors in 28 -day cycles according to four schedules:  q day, q week, 
3 consecutive days q week, and 5 consecutive days q week.  The maximum tolerated 
doses were 6 mg q day, 40 mg q week, 16 mg q day x 3 each week, and 10 mg q day x 5 
each week (15).  
 
Treatment related adverse events, serious adverse events, and events causing withdrawal 
from study INK128 -001 (15): In this study , ≥ 1 treatment -emergent adverse event 
(TEAE) was reported for 139 (98%) of [ADDRESS_315896] frequent TEAEs were hyperglycemia (65% of patients), nausea (63% of 
patients), and vomiting (54%).   In general, TEAEs were  mostly Grade 1 or 2 and 
manageable with supportive care and/or interruption or dose reduction of study drug.   
Severity ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs  (SAEs)  that were reported in 6% or more of  patients, 
regardless of causality, were h yperglycemia (13% of patients), asthenia (8%), anemia 
NCI Protocol #: 9775  
Local Protocol #: MC1482  
NCI Version Date:  October 2, 2017  11 
 
(7%), and hypophosphatemia (6%) and lymphopenia (6%).   As of the clinical database 
cutoff date, SAEs had been reported for  58 patients (41%), with the most common terms 
being mucosal inflammation (4%), asthenia  (3%),  pneumonia (3%),  abdominal pain  
(2%) , stomatitis  (2%) , and renal failure (2%) .  Of the 142 patie nts treated in Study 
INK128 -001 as of the clinical data cutoff, 29 (20%)  discontinued because of 1 or more  
AEs, which included rash (6 patients), mucosal inflam mation (4 patients), asthenia (3 
patients ), hyperglycemia  (2 patients) , nausea  (2 patients) , performance status decreased  
(2 patients) , pruritus  (2 patients) , and acute renal failure  (2 patients) .  Of the total 40 AEs 
present at study withdrawal, 21 events  (53%, including 11 nonserious AEs) were reported 
as severity Grade 3, and 4 SAEs were  Grade 5 (fatal).  
 
A death on INK128 -[ADDRESS_315897] was assessed as 
possibly related to MLN0128 (TAK -228).  After discussion with t he FDA, study C31002, 
a phase [ADDRESS_315898] of a single dose of 40 mg MLN0128 
(TAK -228) on the QT/QTc interval was initiated in patients with advanced solid tumors.  
After completing the per -protocol PK/ECG/cardiac contractility  monitoring, the patients 
continued  MLN0128 (TAK -228) 30 mg QW with continued cardiac monitoring.  The 
study results showed that treatment with MLN0128 (TAK -228) was not associated with 
clinically meaningful effects on the overall electrocardiographic safety profile, and that 
ECHO/MUGA at screening is not required on MLN0128 (TAK -228) trials.  [COMPANY_005] and 
CTEP have agreed that ECG monitoring should be performed on patients prior to 
entering MLN0128 (TAK -228) trials, at the time of completing treatment with MLN0128 
(TAK -228), and periodically during the trial when clinically appropriate.     
 
In INK128 -002, which was reported by [CONTACT_259757]. (17) MLN0128 (TAK -228) was 
administered orally to 37 patients in two d ifferent schedules, either daily or three days 
on/four days off every week schedule with 28 -day cycles.  The maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) was 6 mg for the daily schedule and was not defined in the 3 days on/four days 
off schedule.  Common side effects incl uded nausea ( 56%), fatigue (4 9%), 
hyperglycemia (3 8%), thrombocytopenia (3 6%), diarrhea (28%), anorexia (23%), emesis 
(23%), stomatitis (21%), anemia (21%), and constipation (18%). 27% discontinued drug 
due to an adverse event.  Among 27 patients evaluable  for confirmed responses, 1 
multiple myeloma patient (7 mg QD) achieved a major response lasting 2 months, and 13 
myeloma patients (2 at 2 mg QD, 4 each at 4 mg QD and 7 mg QD, 2 at 9 mg QDx3d 
QW, and 1 at 12 mg QDx3d QW) and 2 Waldenstrom’s macroglobuline mia patients (at 6 
mg QD and 9 mg QDx3d QW) had stable disease.  
 
Subsequent experience with the daily schedule has indicated that MLN0128 (TAK -228) 
at 6 mg/day is intolerable for  prolonged administration  in some patients  (L. A. Doyle, 
personal communication) .  Accordingly, the recommended phase 2 dose is 5 mg/day  for 
daily administration . 
 
2.2.4 Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics   
 
Preclinical pharmacokinetic studies  were examined in mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys.  
After intravenous administration, MLN0128 (TAK -228) displayed a volume of 
NCI Protocol #: 9775  
Local Protocol #: MC1482  
NCI Version Date:  October 2, 2017  12 
 
distribution of 1.4 (dogs) to 14.3 liters/kg (rats) and a terminal half -life of 1.1 (mice) to 
18.9 hours (dogs).  These studies  also demonstrated that MLN0128 (TAK -228) is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_259721] t and displays high  bioavailability (64-73%) in all species tested 
except rats (15).  MLN0128 (TAK -228) crossed the blood -brain barrier poorly, with 
plasma:brain  concentrations of 5:1 in mice receiving a single oral dose  (15). 
 
MLN0128 (TAK -228) binding to plasma proteins was  examined across species.  Plasma 
protein binding ranged from 47% (dogs) to 70.4% (humans).   MLN0128 (TAK -228) 
inhibi ted both drug exporters and drug importers, but only at concentrations that far 
exceed the anticipated clinical concentrations.  In particular, MLN0128 (TAK -228) 
inhibited the exporter ABCG2 (BCRP) with an IC 50 of 52 micromolar  and the drug 
importers OCT1 a nd OCT2 with IC 50s of 19 -28 micromolar  and 1.9  micromolar , 
respectively  (15). 
 
2.2.5 Clinical  Pharmacokinetics  
 
Pharmacokinetic analysis performed in conjunction with the INK128 -001 study 
demonstrated rapid oral absorption, with a C max at approximately 2 h, and a mean 
terminal half -life in the plasma of 6 -8 hours across dose levels (15).  After the initial 
dose, exposures (measured as the area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve) 
were dose -proportional over the range of 2 to 40 mg.  MLN0128 (TAK -228) did not 
accumulate to any appreciable extent with repeated oral dosing.  
 
Pharmacokinetic analysis performed in conjunction with the INK128 -002 study in 
hematological malignancies  yielded similar results (15).  After oral administration,  Cmax 
was achieved within 1 -2 hours.  Once again the  mean plasma half -life was 8 hours and a 
dose-dependent increase in exposure  was observed .  The mean plasma C max at the MTD 
of 6 mg/d was 46 ng/ml on cycle 1/day 1 and 31 ng/ml on cycle 2/day 1, corresponding to 
plasma levels of 150 and 100 nM, respectivel y.  These results again indicate that 
MLN0128 (TAK -228) did not accumulate to any appreciable extent during daily oral 
dosing.  
 
Metabolism in humans  
Incubation of MLN0128 with human liver microsomes results in a single metabolite (M1) 
that is equipotent w ith the parent agent in inhibiting mTOR kinase.  While M1 represents 
as much as 30% of circulating drug in rats, it represents only 4% of circulating drug in 
humans and is not felt to contribute significant ly to MLN0128 (TAK -228) 
pharmacodynamic effects (15). 
 
The capacity for MLN0128 (TAK -228) to interact with the cytochrome P450 drug 
metabolizing machinery  has been examined (15).  In a study using recombinant human 
isozymes, CYP2C9, 2C19, and 3A4 metabolized MLN0128 in vitro , whereas CYP1A2, 
2B6, and 2C8 did not. MLN0128 (TAK -228) (up to 10 µ M) did not induce CYP1A2, 
2B6, and 3A4 activity and expressi on in human  hepatocytes .  MLN0128 (TAK -228) did 
not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4/5 in human liver microsomal 
incubations .

Potential for drug interactions  
Based on the high concentrations required to inhibitor drug transporters, as well  as the 
lack of induction or inhibition of commonly studied cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, 
MLN0128 (TAK -228) is felt to have limited potential for drug -drug interactions at the 
anticipated therapeutic concentrations  (15).  
 
2.2.[ADDRESS_315899] demonstrated that prolonged mTOR inhibition (at least  72 hours) 
is required to see signs of apoptosis induction in ALL cell lines by [CONTACT_259758]1/mTORC2 inhibitors in vitro (18).  Upon administration of these inhibitors to 
mice bearing human lymphoid xenografts, xenograft regression is not evident until days 
6-8 but  continues throughout the course of treatment (18).  These observations, along 
with studies in murine Ph+ ALL showing efficacy of  daily dosing (12), prompt this trial 
of MLN0128 (TAK -228) dosed on a daily schedule . 
 
Preclinical studies in the Kaufmann laboratory have demonstrated that uptake of the 
TORC1/TORC2 dual in hibitor OSI -027 is diminished in three of four lymphoid lines 
selected for resistance by [CONTACT_259759].  These lines are cross -resistant to 
MLN0128 (TAK -228).  The uptake defect is reversed by [CONTACT_259760] 3 days.  These 
observations lead to the proposal to administer MLN0128 (TAK -228) for 21 of every 28 -
day cycle.  
 
2.2.7 Milled MLN0128 (TAK -228) Drug S ubstance (DS, process B)  
 
In order to allow more predictable absorption of MLN0128 (TAK -228) after oral 
administration and to allow scale -up manufacturing of MLN0128 (TAK -228) capsules, 
Millennium /[COMPANY_005] developed a new milled formulation of the agent.  The physical 
milling step during the granulation process controls particle size distribution o f 
MLN0128 (TAK -228).  In order to observe whether this milling step altered the safety 
and PK profile of MLN0128 (TAK -228), the company performed in vivo studies with PK 
analysis of milled MLN0128 (TAK -228).  These studies indicated that the milled 
formula tion may result in faster absorption with possibly higher maximum concentration 
(Cmax), which could result in a different safety profile, compared to the previous 
unmilled API [INVESTIGATOR_259722].  In rats, the mean AUC milled/unmilled was 2.97    while in 
monkey s, it was      he C max ratios were    
[COMPANY_005] developed new MLN0128 (TAK -228) capsules containing milled active 
pharmaceutical ingredient (API) for clinical studies in 1 mg, 3 mg, and 5 mg strengths.  
Patients receiving the milled formulation were added onto ongoing studies C31001 and 
C31002, as well as a new study MLN0128 -1004, to determine the PK parameters of 
milled and unmilled MLN0128 in patients administered single doses under both fasted 
and fed conditions , with various treatment cohorts including daily and weekly 
administration of milled MLN0128 (TAK -228) 
The recommended dos e of milled MLN0128 (TAK -228) was evaluated in 17 patients of 
NCI Protocol #: 9775  
Local Protocol #: MC1482  
NCI Version Date:  October 2, 2017  14 
 
MLN0128 -1004, with PK, safety, and tolerability assessed.  Six patients were given a 4 
mg QD dose of milled MLN0128 (TAK -228) and 3 patients had observed DLT (rash, 
appetite loss and fatigue).  A dose of 3 mg QD was given to 11 patients with only 1 DLT 
(decreased platelets) observed.  The 3 mg QD dose of MLN0128 (TAK -228) was 
declared the RP2D, and was generally well tolerated and demonstrating objective 
responses in patients.   
 
A significant an d meaningful difference in tolerability was observed in the comparison of 
the MTDs between unmilled and milled MLN0128 (TAK -228) when administered QD.  
This difference in tolerability may be possibly explained due to the effect of food on the 
safety/tolera bility of unmilled MLN0128 (TAK -228) in study IND128 -001.  The 
GastroPlusTM simulation performed on study suggests that under fasting conditions, 
unmilled and milled MLN0128 (TAK -228) administrations result in comparable 
exposures to MLN0128 (TAK -228); whereas in the fed state, milled MLN0128 (TAK -
228) resulted in higher Cmax (1.5- to 2-fold higher ) and earlier T max than unmilled 
MLN0128 (TAK -228) with comparable AUCs.   Consequently, a  dose of 3 mg QD was 
chosen as the RP2D of milled MLN0128 (TAK -228) dose in empty stomach conditions.   
 
The RP2D for milled MLN0128 (TAK -228) on a weekly schedule was determined to be 
30 mg, the same weekly RP2D as seen for the older unmilled formulation.   Six patients 
treated at 30 mg weekly with the milled formulation did not demonstrate any DLT, but 
the agent was not escalated further.  No DLT had been demonstrated for milled 
MLN0128 (TAK -228) at the prior 20 mg QW dose as well.  
 
 
2.3 Rationale  
 
A number of  studies (19-24) have demonstrated that the rapalogs temsirolimus and 
everolimus, which inhibit TORC1, have clinical acti vity in lymphoid malignancies.  
Unfortunately, fewer than 5 patients with ALL were treated with rapamycin analogs in 
phase I clinical trials (25), so the single -agent activity of rapalogs in ALL is unknown.  
 
The rat ionale for the development of TORC1/TORC2 dual inhibitors has been 
extensively reviewed (26-33).  In brief, after binding to FKBP12, rapalogs inhibit 
TORC1 but do not directly inhibit TORC2.  As a result, there has been concern that 
rapalogs can activate survival pathways, either through increased TORC2 -mediated 
phosphorylation of AKT  or through derepression of insulin recept or substrate - (IRS -) 
mediated signaling to the PI3 kinase/ AKT  pathway in some cell types (34-36).  To 
overcome this potential limitation of rapalogs , agents that simultaneously target TORC1 
and TORC2 have been developed. OSI -027 and MLN0128 (TAK -228) are two such 
inhibitors.  Both are ATP -competitive inhibitors of TORC1 and TORC2, but MLN0128 
(TAK -228) is approximately [ADDRESS_315900] demonstrated that dual mTOR 
inhibitors such as  OSI-027 and  MLN0128 (TAK -228) appear to be particularly active in 
NCI Protocol #: 9775  
Local Protocol #: MC1482  
NCI Version Date:  October 2, 2017  15 
 
certain lymphoid neoplasms (18, 37).  When Gupta et al. compared the effects of dual 
mTOR inhibitor OSI -027 in cell lines derived from various lymphoid malignancies, 
including T -cell ALL (Jurkat, CE M, Molt3), B -cell ALL (Nalm6), diffuse large B cell 
lymphoma (HT, RL) and mantle cell lymphoma (Jeko, Mino), the ALL lines were 
consistently more sensitive than the other lymphoid cell lines in 5 -day MTS assays (18).  
Subsequent experiments demonstrated that OSI -027, but not rapamycin, induced 
apoptosis in the ALL lines that was mediated by [CONTACT_259761] -apoptotic 
BCL2  family members BCL2L11 (Bim)  and BBC3 (Puma)  (18).  Further investigation 
has shown that BCL2L1 1 (Bim)  upregulation reflects transactivation of the BCL2L11  
(Bim)  promot er downstream  of mTORC2 inhibition, whereas BBC3 (Puma)  upregulation 
reflects inhibition of mTORC1 -mediated 4EBP1 phosphorylation and consequent 
inhibition of translation of a BBC3 (P uma)  suppressor (14).  
 
Two studies performed in nude mice bearing Jeko (human mantle cell lymphoma) 
xenografts demonstrated marked tumor regressions, associated with induction of 
BCL2L11 (Bim)  and BBC3 (Puma) , after treatment with OSI -027 but not rapamycin  
(18). In contrast, the RL diffuse large B -cell lymphoma cell  line, which contains a 
t(14;18) translocation that results in marked upregulation of a BCL2  protein with a gain -
of-function mutation (38), did not respond to OSI -027 in vivo  (18). 
 
In further preclinical studies, clinical samples from patients with various lymphoid 
neoplasms were expo sed to varying OSI -[ADDRESS_315901] sensitive 
(18). In contrast, CLL and follicular lymphoma were highly resistant.  
 
In a more detailed study in primary ALL samples using the same assay (14), IC 50 values 
ranged from 80-2000 nM for O SI-027 and 2 -100 nM for MLN0128 (TAK -228). Clinical 
ALL isolates were generally as sensitive as Jurkat cells (14), an intermediate s ensitivity 
T-cell ALL line (18).  Direct comparison of the effects of 250 nM MLN0128 (TAK -228) 
and 10 nM rapamycin (the highest sustainable concentrations in humans) revealed that 
MLN0128 (TAK -228) exhibited greater cytotoxic effects in all six  clinical ALL isol ates 
treated with both agents.  
 
Further analysis indicated that similar biochemical effects were observed in ALL cell 
lines and primary ALL samples after treatment with mTORC1/mTORC2 dual inhibitors 
in vitro (14).  In particular, MLN0128 (TAK -228) abolished  4EBP1 phosphorylation in 
Jurkat T -cell ALL cells at 200 nM and in primary ALL cells at 62.5 nM in vitro  (N. 
Vincelette, K. Peterson and S. Kaufmann, unpublished observations ).  These observations 
provide part of the rationale for the correlative s tudies described in Section s 2.4 and 9 of 
this protocol  
 
In a separate study , MLN0128 (TAK -228) suppressed proliferation of B -ALL cell lines 
and reduced colony formation by [CONTACT_259762] 
B-ALL patients in vitro  (39).  In a syngeneic mouse model of lymphoid BCR -ABL 
NCI Protocol #: 9775  
Local Protocol #: MC1482  
NCI Version Date:  October 2, 2017  16 
 
positive disease, MLN0128 (TAK -228) cleared leukemic growth.  In this and additional 
in vivo  models, MLN0128 (TAK -228) was well tole rated and did not suppress 
endogenous bone marrow proliferation.   
 
Given the sensitivity of ALL cells and clinical ALL samples to TORC1/TORC2 dual 
inhibitors described above, as well as the limited treatment options for patients with 
relapsed ALL, the present study is  a phase II trial designed to assess the activity of  
single -agent MLN0128 (TAK -228) in relapsed and refractory ALL.  
 
2.4 Correlative Studies Background  
 
2.4.1 Plasma and Marrow P harmacokinetics  
 
Rationale:  These studies are necessary to characteriz e the pharmacokinetics of 
MLN0128 (TAK -228) in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia , to provide a basis 
for understanding  differences in toxicity and responses to MLN0128 (TAK -228) and to 
assess pharmacodynamic relationships with phosphorylated mTOR subst rates and 
expression levels of BCL2L11 (Bim) , BBC3 (Puma) , MCL1  and BCL2 . 
 
Assay description:  Plasma and marrow concentrations of MLN0128 (TAK -228) will be 
measured by [CONTACT_259763]/ms/ms methods developed in the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center 
Pharmacology Shared Resource.  
 
2.4.2 Phosphorylation of the mTOR Substrate  4EBP1 (Integrated B iomarker)  
 
Rationale: By [CONTACT_259764] 4EBP1 in marrows harv ested 
prior to treatment and again on day 8, we will assess whether levels of MLN0128 (TAK -
228) sufficient to inhibit mTOR  have been achieved in leukemic blasts in situ .  
Conversely, we have observed that Nalm6 B -cell ALL cells selected for resistance to 
mTORC1/mTORC2 dual inhibitors fail to exhibit inhibition of 4EBP1 phosphorylation 
upon tr eatment with OSI -027 or MLN0128 (TAK -228), suggesting that failure to inhibit 
the mTORC1/4EBP1 axis might represent a mechanism of resistance to this class of 
agent.   Thus, this assay is being performed to confirm mechanism of action of MLN0128 
(TAK -228) as well as assess a potential readout for resistance to this class of agent.  
 
Assay description:  Immunoblotting will be performed for phospho -Thr37,46-4EBP1 using 
techniques previously described by [CONTACT_259765] (40, 41).  Whole cell lysates 
(42, 43) will be prepared from  Ficoll/Hypaque -purified  marrow mononuclear cells 
(assayed for blast percentage by [CONTACT_259766]).  Aliquots containing  equal 
amounts of  protein from cells harvested prior to treatment and on day 8 will  be subjected 
to SDS -PAGE in adjacent wells of gels and probed for phospho -Thr37,46-4EBP1 and total 
4EBP1 . Further details related to the assay are found in Section 9 .1.3 of this protocol .   
 
2.4.3 Phosphorylation of the mTOR S ubstrate AKT  Ser473 (Exploratory Biomarker)  
 
NCI Protocol #: 9775  
Local Protocol #: MC1482  
NCI Version Date:  October 2, 2017  17 
 
Rationale: the assay for phosphorylated 4EBP1 examines inhibition of mTORC1.  As 
indicated in Section 2.3 , mTORC1/mTORC2 dual inhibitors have been developed based 
on the rationale that inhibiting mTORC2 will prevent feedback -mediated  upregula tion of 
pro-survival pathways.  In addition, recent results have demonstrated that mTORC2 
inhibition plays a major role in the MLN0128 (TAK -228)-induced upregulation of the 
proapoptotic BCL2  family member BCL2L11 (Bim)  (14).  By [CONTACT_259767]  (Ser473) in marrows harvested prior to treatment and again on 
day 8, we will assess whether TORC2  has also been inhibited in leukemic blasts in situ .  
Thus, this assay is being performed to provide further proof of the mechanism of action 
of this agent in clinical ALL in situ . 
 
Assay description: Whole cell lysates prepared from Ficoll/Hyp aque-purified  marrow 
mononuclear cells prior to treatment and on d ay 8 will subjected to immunoblotting for 
phospho -Ser473-AKT  and total AKT . Further details regarding the proposed assay are 
contained in Section 9. 1.4. 
 
2.4.4 Expression of BCL2L11 ( Bim), BBC3 ( Puma ), MCL1 and B CL2 (Exploratory 
Biomarkers)  
 
Rationale: Previous studies have demonstrated that the mTORC1/mTORC2 dual 
inhibitors induce apoptosis in vitro  and in xenograft models by [CONTACT_259768] -
apoptotic BCL2  family members BCL2L11 (Bim)  and BBC3 (Puma)  as well as, in some 
lymphoid lines, down regulating  MCL1  (14, 18).  Importantly, blunting BCL2L11 ( Bim) 
or BBC3 (Puma)  upregulation diminishes mTORC1/mTORC2 dual inhibitor -induced 
apoptosis (14, 18).  By [CONTACT_259769]2L11 ( Bim), BBC3 (Puma)  and 
MCL [ADDRESS_315902] shown that  BCL2  overexpression  is a mechanism of 
resistance to this class of agent (14, 18).  Thus, assessment of  pretreatment BCL2  as well 
as the degree of upregulation of BCL2L11 (Bim)  and BBC3 (Puma)  will begin to 
examine  potential mechanisms of resistance  as well . 
 
Assay description:  Immunoblotting will be performed for BCL2L11 ( Bim), BBC3 
(Puma) , MCL 1 and BCL 2 (40, 41).  As described in Section 2.4.2, w hole cell lysates (42, 
43) will be prepared from Ficoll/ Hypaque -purified marrow mononuclear cells (assayed 
for blast percentage by [CONTACT_259766]).   Aliquots containing equal amounts of 
protein  from  cells harvest ed prior to treatment and on day 8 will be subjected to SDS -
PAGE in adjacent wells of gels and probed with commercial antibodies to BCL2L11 
(Bim), BBC3 (Puma) , MCL 1, and BCL 2.  Blots will be reprobed for histone H1, a 
protein that should be present in simi lar amounts in different diploid cells, to provide a 
loading  control.   Further details regarding this assay can be found in Section 9 .1.5 of this 
protocol.   If sufficient material remains after this assay, additional BCL2 family members 
not currently implicated in mTOR inhibitor action in ALL samples, such as BCL2L1 
NCI Protocol #: 9775  
Local Protocol #: MC1482  
NCI Version Date:  October 2, 2017  18 
 
(Bcl-xL) and BCL2L2 (Bcl -w) that could in principle affect the outcome of treatment , 
will be co nsidered for assessment in a similar fashion.  
 
2.4.5 Phosphoproteomic A nalysis  (Exploratory B iomarker)  
 
Rationale:  Prior publications have identified differences in the pattern of protein 
phosphorylation between cell lines that are sensitive to kinase inhibitors and similar cell 
lines that are resistant  (e.g., 44, 45).  Preliminary studies  in the Kaufmann laboratory  
have likewise demonstrated differences in protein phosphorylation at key nodes between 
parental Nalm6  B-cell ALL  cells and Nalm6 cells selected for the ability to grow 
continuously in 8 µM OSI -027 (C . Correia, K . L. B. Knorr, S . Yun, A . E. Wahner 
Hendrickson, B . Madden, D . McCormick, S . Dasari, and S . H. Kaufmann, unpublished 
observations).  Thus, we hypothesize that pretreatment patterns of phosphorylation might 
differ between ALLs that respond to MLN0128 and those that do not.  
 
Assay description and analysis:  Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259723] 8 of treatment will be enriched for leukemic blasts on Ficoll -Hypaque  
gradients.   Whole cell lysates prepared as described in Sections 2.2 and 2.3 will be 
analyzed for a set of more than 60 key phosphorylations  and 200 key regulatory  proteins  
by [CONTACT_259770] (RPPA) in  the M.D. Anderson RPPA Core Facility. 
Further information regarding this assay is found in Section 9 .1.6. 
 
2.4.6 Transcriptional Profiling  (Exploratory B iomarker)  
 
Rationale:  Recent publications have identified  additional changes that correlate with 
resistance to mTOR dual inhibitors, including overexpression of eIF4E  (46).  To search 
for changes such as this and provide an opportunity for further unbiased analysis of 
potential markers of MLN0128 sensitivity vs. resistance, samples (when cell number is 
sufficient) will be saved for transcriptional profiling to assess whether t here is a particular 
gene expression profile that correlates with sensitivity vs. resistance to MLN0128 (TAK -
228). 
 
Assay description and analysis:  Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259724] 8 of treatment will be enriched for leuke mic blasts on Ficoll -Hypaque  
gradients. Samples will be lysed in RNAlater (Qiagen) and st ored at -80 °C until 
analyzed.  Further analysis will be performed only if the studies above do not yield robust 
testable hypotheses regarding responders vs. nonrespon ders. A further description of this 
assay is provided in Section 9. 1.7. 
 
2.4.[ADDRESS_315903] of mechanism.  
According to current understanding, the killing of A LL cells by [CONTACT_218525]1/mTORC2 dual 
inhibitors depends upon the activation of two pathways, one involving drug -induced 
inhibition of mTORC 1-mediated 4EBP1 phosphorylat ion, leading sequentially to 
decreased 4EBP1 phosphorylation, decreased eIF4E -facilitated tran slation of cMYC 
NCI Protocol #: 9775  
Local Protocol #: MC1482  
NCI Version Date:  October 2, 2017  19 
 
mRNA, decreased c -MYC protein, increased BBC3 (Puma) mRNA stability and 
increased BBC3  (Puma)  protein, and another pathway  involving decreased mTORC2 -
mediated phosphorylation of a transcription factor cascade leading to increased activation  
of the BCL2L11  promoter,  increased BCL2L11  (Bim)  mRNA, and increased BCL2L11  
(Bim)  protein.  One or both pathways are engaged in all clinical ALL samples exposed to 
MLN0128 (TAK -228) ex vivo  to da te.  To assure that the mechanism of action is  
thoroughly investigated in paired clinical samples, the order of priority will be to assay 
first those antigens that have been directly implicated  in mTORC1/mTORC2 dual 
inhibitor induced killing in human ALL cells, i.e., phospho -4EBP1 (integrated biomarker, 
a marker of mTORC1 inhibition), phospho -Ser473-AKT  (exploratory biomarker, a marker 
of mTORC2 inhibition), BBC3 (Puma) protein levels (exploratory biomarker, responsible 
for killing downstream of mTORC1 inhibition) and BCL2L11  (Bim) protein levels  
(exploratory biomarker, responsible for killing downstream of mTORC2 inhibition).   
Because some of the antibodies used in the RPPAs (notably anti -BBC3) are particularly 
problematic (recognize a band at the expected molecular weight in cells with targeted 
interruption  of the BBC3  gene), we have elected to perform the analysis by 
[CONTACT_259771] (the technique approved by [CONTACT_259772]) and will utilize the RPPA for confirmatory analysis of those 
antigens that  are in common.  Addition analytes recommended by [CONTACT_259773], including phospho -p70S6 kinase  (another biomarker of mTORC1 inhibition, but 
one that does not correlate with mTOR inhibitor killing [18]) and the anti -apoptotic 
proteins BCL2L1 (Bc l-xL) and BCL2L2 (Bcl -w), which might correlate with response 
but are not directly implicated in the mechanism of action of this class of compounds, 
have been prioritized  lower .  Likewise, because mTOR inhibitors affect translation of 
mRNA particularly dra matically, protein studies have been prioritized above mRNA 
studies.  The proposed cell -based studies are presented  above and in Section  9.1 in the 
order in which they are prioritized.

4.1.2  CTEP Associate Registration Procedures / CTEP -IAM Account  
 
The Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) Identity and Access Management 
(IAM) applicatio n is a web -based application intended for use by [CONTACT_33976] (i.e., 
all physicians involved in the conduct of NCI -sponsored clinical trials) and Associates 
(i.e., all staff involved in the conduct of NCI -sponsored clinical trials).  
 
Associates will use the CTEP -IAM application to register (both initial registration and 
annual re -registration) with CTEP and to obtain a user account.  
 
Investigators will use the CTEP -IAM application to obtain a user account only. (See 
CTEP Investigator R egistration Procedures above for information on registering with 
CTEP as an Investigator, which must be completed before a CTEP -IAM account can be 
requested.)  
 
An active CTEP -IAM user account is needed to access all CTEP and CTSU (Cancer 
Trials Support Uni t) websites and applications, and is critical to the conduct of this study, 
including document access, patient enrollment, and clinical data submission.  
 
Additional information can be found on the CTEP website at

4.3 Patient Registration  
 
4.3.1 OPEN / IWRS  
 
Patient enrollment will be facilitated using the Oncology Patient Enrollment Network 
(OPEN).  OPEN is a web -based registration system available to users on a 24/7 basis.  It 
is integrated with the CTSU Enterprise System for regulatory and roster data inter change 
and with the Theradex Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) for retrieval of patient 
registration/randomization assignment.   Patient enrollment data entered by [CONTACT_33979] / IWRS will automatically transfer to the NCI’s clinical data managem ent system, 
Medidata Rave.  
 
The OPEN  system will provide the site with a printable confirmation of registration and 
treatment information.   Please print this confirmation for your records.   
 
4.3.2 OPEN/IWRS User Requirements  
 
OPEN/IWRS users must meet the follow ing requirements:  
• Have a valid CTEP -IAM account (i.e., CTEP username [CONTACT_2383]).  
• To enroll patients or request slot reservations:  Be on an ETCTN Lead or 
Participating Organization roster with the role of Registrar.  
• To access cohort management:  Be iden tified to Theradex as the “Client Admin” 
for the study.  
• Have regulatory approval for the conduct of the study at their site.  
 
Prior to accessing OPEN/IWRS, site staff should verify the following:

authorization form.  
 
4.3.3 OPEN/IWRS Questions?  
 
Further instructional information on OPEN is provided on the OPEN tab of the CTSU 
website at https://www.ctsu.org  or at https://open.ctsu.org .  For any additional ques tions 
contact [CONTACT_25518] 1 -[PHONE_103] or [EMAIL_013] .  
 
4.4 General Guidelines  
 
Following registration, patients should begin protocol treatment within  7 days.  Issues 
that would cause treatment delays should be discussed with the Principal Investigator.  If 
a patient does not receive protocol therapy following registration, the patient’s 
registration on the study may be canceled.   
 
 
5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
Patients will be screened for eligibility within 7 days of day 1.  Starting dose will be 3 mg daily 
for days 1 -21 of  every 28 -day cy cle.  Concomitant corticosteroid administration  is not allowed 
for treatment of underlying malignancy (ALL) but is allowed for treatment e mergent  medical 
conditions that would ordinarily require corticosteroids, e.g., diffuse alveolar hemorrhage or 
severe treatment emergent dermatological conditions .  
 
Timing of treatment should be such that pretreatment and day 8 marrows can be shipped on 
Monday -Thursday as described in Section 9. 2.   
 
All patients will receive one dose of clinically indicated intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy  
prophylactically within one week of starting study treatment .  For patients with malignant CSF 
and due to poor penetration of CSF by [CONTACT_161767]0128 (TAK -228), patients can be treated with IT 
methotrexate or cytarabine per standard practice of participating institution.  At the time of ITl 
chemotherapy  performed prior to stud y treatment and any clinically indicated subsequent IT 
chemotherapy performed during the study , up to a 2 mL sample of CSF will be collected  for 
MLN0128 (TAK -228) pharmacokinetics  if possible .  
 
Responders  (CR/CRi/PR/ MLFS ) to therapy at any time can procee d to consolidation therapy at 3 
mg orally daily for 21 -days every 28 -day cycle until disease progression and  as long as they are 
tolerating MLN0128 (TAK -228).  Responders may go off study and  proceed to stem cell 
transplantation if candidate and donor are available  at any time .  
 
Patients who achieve a PR with MLN0128 (TAK -228) will, by [CONTACT_108], have normalization of 
NCI Protocol #: 9775  
Local Protocol #: MC1482  
NCI Version Date:  October 2, 2017  27 
 
platelet and neutrophil counts despi[INVESTIGATOR_259727].  It is 
unclear how long they might respond to MLN0128 (TAK -228) and whether they are at risk of 
rapid progression while on this agent.  Accordingly, all patients in P R after two cycles will be 
discussed with the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_259728] a timely fashion to determine on a case by [CONTACT_259777], escalation to a higher dose (per Section 6.0) or 
removal from study for an alternativ e regimen with a well described response rate in 
relapsed/refractory ALL is the best course of action  
 
Non-responders  and PR  after 2 cycles of therapy (with no evidence of significant drug -related 
toxicity) could proceed to dose level +1 (4 mg orally daily  for 21 days every 28 -day cycle).   
Non-responders and PR after 2 additional cycles (with no evidence of significant drug -related 
toxicity) of dose escalation (end of cycle 4) could proceed to dose level +2 (4 mg orally daily for 
28 days every 28 -day cycle ).  Non-responders after 2 cycles (end of cycle 6), will be taken off 
study.   
 
5.1 Agent Administration  
 
5.1.1 MLN0128 (TAK -228) 
 
Patients will receive MLN0128 (TAK -228) orally daily on days 1 -21 every 28 -day cycle .  
Patients will complete a pi[INVESTIGATOR_259729].  Leftover study medication will 
also be returned.  
  
Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis, but inpatient status is allowed too.  
Reported adverse events and potential risks are  described in Section 7.  Appropriate dose 
modifications are described in Section 6.  No investigational or commercial agents or 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_259730]'s malignancy.  
 
Antiemetics  and antidiarrheal agents are not required but may be administered  as needed 
for symptom control.  
  
If severe emesis or mucositis prevents the patient from taking scheduled doses, that dose 
will be skipped.  If emesis occurs after study medication ingestion , the dose will not be 
readministered, and patients should resume dosing at the next scheduled time with the 
prescribed dosage.  Patients should record the occurrence of the emesis in their dosing 
diaries.  Under no circumstance should a patient repeat a d ose or double -up doses.  
 
5.1.2 Intrathe cal chemotherapy:  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  For patients without known CNS involvement:   
 
Within one week (at most ten days) prior to start of therapy , patients will receive 
mandatory CSF prophylaxis consisting of an intrathecal regimen according to 
institutional or national guidelines, e.g., methotrexate 12 to 15 mg  and/or  cytosine 
arabinoside 40 mg  or dexamethasone 4 mg or equivalent steroid dose.  In case of 
NCI Protocol #: 9775  
Local Protocol #: MC1482  
NCI Version Date:  October 2, 2017  28 
 
anticipated safety risks caused by [CONTACT_259778], e.g., in case of thrombocy topenia, 
CSF prophylaxis may be omitted . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  For patients with CNS involvement:  
 
Intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy (methotrexate 12 to 15 mg and/or  cytarabine 100 mg) 
can be given for patient with malignant CSF (involved with ALL by [CONTACT_259779]) due to  poor penetration of MLN0128 (TAK -228) to CSF.  Treatment 
will be as per standard practice of each participating institution.  
 
5.2 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
As indicated in Section 2.2 .5, MLN0128 (TAK -228) has low potential for interaction 
with other drugs based on its limited ability to induce or inhibit cytochrome P450 
isoenz ymes.  Therefore, there are no proscriptions against particular concomitant 
medications.  
 
Supportive care: transfusions with packed  RBC or platelets will be done as per each local 
participating institution guidelines.  
 
G-CSF: Treatment with filgrastim (5  mcg/kg SC daily until ANC >  5000) or 
Pegfilgrastim (6  mg SC x1) will be allowed if severe neutropenia exists o r is suspected to 
occu r.  The s tart date will be left to the judgment of the treating physician , but dates of 
administration are to be recorded in the case report forms . 
 
Management of Hyperglycemia  
 
On the basis of the clinical experience in TAK -[ADDRESS_315915] their glucose closely 
monitored by [CONTACT_464].  The inv estigator may choose to continue close monitoring of 
patients who develop Grade 1 hyperglycemia (fasting glucose >ULN ≤160 mg/dL) or, 
alternatively, consider initiating treatment with an oral hypoglycemic agent, such as 
metformin.  All patients with ≥  Grad e 2 hyperglycemia (fasting glucose >160 mg/dL) 
must be treated aggressively with oral hypoglycemic agents and/or insulin as clinically 
indicated.  The investigator should consult an endocrinologist, if needed, to aid in 
optimizing the patient’s hyperglycem ia treatment plan.  
 
It is recommended that patients with elevated fasting blood glucose be initially treated 
with a fast acting insulin sensitizer such as metformin at 500 mg orally QD and titrate up 
to a maximum of 1000 mg orally BID as needed.   Concurren t addition to metformin of 
DPP-4 inhibitors ( e.g., sitagliptin or vildagliptin) and/or insulin should also be 
NCI Protocol #: 9775  
Local Protocol #: MC1482  
NCI Version Date:  October 2, 2017  29 
 
considered. Oral sulfonylureas ( e.g., glipi[INVESTIGATOR_53289]) should be used with caution, 
due to the higher risk of inducing hypoglycemia in pati ents.  The dose of oral 
hypoglycemic agents should be adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency.  In addition, 
patients should be encouraged to follow a low carbohydrate diet once hyperglycemia is 
first observed.   
 
If any fasting serum glucose reading performed at the site indicates hyperglycemia (>  
ULN or ≥  110 mg/dL), the study staff should first confirm that the patient was fasting at 
the time of blood specimen collection (ie, nothing by [CONTACT_24314] 8 hours before 
collection).  
 
In-Home  Daily Fasting Glucose Monitoring  
 
In addition to obtaining fasting glucose levels at the clinic visits as outlined in the 
Schedule of Events, all patients  receiv ing TAK -[ADDRESS_315916] a daily fasting blood 
glucose  level every morning (predose on dosing days), starting on Cycle [ADDRESS_315917] the site immediately if the value is abnormal (ie, 
≥150 mg/dL) for further instruction s on the management of their hyperglycemia. 
Hyperglycemia observed during home glucose monitoring should be confirmed in the 
clinic.  
 
If no irregularities in the fasting blood glucose level are observed during a minimum of 2 
consecutive months, then the fr equency of in -home fasting blood glucose testing can be 
reduced to a minimum frequency of once weekly, depending on the investigator’s 
judgment and approval.  Patients will continue to notify the investigator of fasting blood 
glucose levels that exceed 150  mg/dL and, if blood glucose  levels are not well controlled  
or if the patient requires either oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin to control blood 
glucose levels, then the frequency of in -home testing of fasting blood glucose levels will 
be reinstated to d aily. 
 
5.3 Duration of Therapy  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event (s), treatment may continue after 
response until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
• Disease progression  at any time , 
 
NCI Protocol #: 9775  
Local Protocol #: MC1482  
NCI Version Date:  October 2, 2017  30 
 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
 
• Unacceptable adverse event(s),  
 
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study,                                                                          
 
• General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
 
• No response after 6 cycles of MLN0128 (TAK -228). Response includes 
CR/CRi/PR  or MLFS on bone marrow  
 
• Dose delay of more than 1 cycle due to related toxicity or more than 2 cycles to 
unrelated toxicity  
 
• If responding , patient proceed s with allogeneic stem cell transplant.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_315918].  Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse event (s) 
will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.   Patients will be 
followed for survival status by a telephone call every [ADDRESS_315919] be documented in the Case Report Form.  
 
 
6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIF ICATIONS  
 
Dose de -escalation will be pursued if patients develop a significant related AE as below.  
 
Dose escalation could be chosen if patients fail to show a response (CR/CRi/  MLFS) and show 
no evidence of drug -related toxicity.  Dose escalation or re -escalation will be done after a dose 
has been tolerated  for 2 cycles.  
 
Dose delays are allowed for a maximum of 1 cycle if patient develops a related toxicity and 2 
months if unrelated toxicity  (disease related for example) .

remission (CR) . 
 
**Patients requiring > two dose reductions should go off protocol therapy.  
 
Non-hematological toxicity:  
 
Non-hematological toxicities of fatigue,  electrolyte abnormalities and abnormal liver function 
tests, including bilirubin, transaminases and alkaline phosphatase will only require dose 
modification if they are likely or definitely related to MLN0128 (TAK -228) and persist more 
than 7 days.   Neutropenic fever  and infectio us toxicities are only counted for if patients achieve 
remission and then develop these adverse events .

7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The 
following list of AEs (Section 7.1) and the characteristics of an observed AE (Section 7.2) will 
determine whether the event requires expedited  repor ting (via CTEP -AERS ) in addition  to 
routine  reporting.  
 
NCI Protocol #: 9775  
Local Protocol #: MC1482  
NCI Version Date:  October 2, [ADDRESS_315921] (CAEPR)  
 
The Comprehensive Adverse Event and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of 
reported and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a uniform 
presentation of events by [CONTACT_6764].  In addition to the comprehensive list, a subset  of AEs , 
the Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column 
and is identified with bold and italicized text.  Th e SPEER is a list of events that are protocol -
specific exceptions to expedited reporting to NCI via CTEP -AERS (except as noted below).  
Refer to the 'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements' 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/adverse_effects.htm  for further clarification.  
 
The CAEPR may not provide frequency data; if not, refer to the Investigator’s Brochure  for this 
information.  
 
NOTE :  The highest grade curr ently reported is noted in parentheses next to the AE in the 
SPEER.   Report ONLY AEs higher than this grade expeditio usly via CTEP -AERS .  If this 
CAEPR is part of a combination protocol using multiple inv estigational agents and has an AE 
listed on different SPEERs, use the lower of the grades to determine if expedited reporting is 
required.

Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR)  
for 
MLN0128 (TAK -228) (INK128, NSC 768435)  
 
The Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of 
reported and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated w ith an agent using a uniform 
presentation of events by [CONTACT_6764]. In addition to the comprehensive list, a subset, the 
Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and 
is identified with bold and italicized te xt. This subset of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that are 
protocol specific exceptions to expedited reporting to NCI (except as noted below).  Refer to the 
'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements' 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/aeguidelines.pdf  for 
further clarification. Frequency is provided based on 252 patients. Below is the CAEPR for 
MLN0 128 (TAK -228)(INK128).  
 
NOTE : Report AEs on the SPEER ONLY IF  they exceed the grade noted in parentheses next to 
the AE in the SPEER.  If this CAEPR is part of a combination protocol using multiple 
investigational agents and has an AE listed on different S PEERs, use the lower of the grades to 
determine if expedited reporting is required.

FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312)  
NOTE:   Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor (NCI) ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether or not 
they are considered related  to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:   
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1328] ≥ 24 
hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/bi rth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6721], based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. (FDA, 21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).  
ALL SERIOUS  adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST  be immediately reported to the NCI via AdEERS 
within the timeframes deta iled in the table below.

disorders  Anemia  Grade [ADDRESS_315928].   
 
7.5 Secondary Malignanc y 
 
A secondary malignancy is a c ancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy ( e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy).  A secondary 
malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  
 
CTEP requires all secondary malignan cies that occur following treatment with an agent under an 
NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP -AERS . Three options are available to describe the event:  
 
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy ( e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia 
[AML])  
• Myelodysplastic synd rome (MDS)  
• Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
 
NCI Protocol #: 9775  
Local Protocol #: MC1482  
NCI Version Date:  October 2, 2017  41 
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be 
reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
 
7.6 Second Malignancy  
 
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a 
metastasis from the initial malignancy).   Second malignancies require ONLY routine adverse 
event reporting unless otherwise specified .  
 
8. PHARMACEUTICAL  INFORMATION  
 
A list of the adverse events and potential risks associated with the investigational administered in 
this study can be found in Section 7.1.  
 
8.1 MLN0128 (TAK -228) (NSC # 768435)  
 
Other Names:  MLN0128,  INK128 , NSC# 768435  
 
Classification:  mTOR inhibitor, TORC1/2  
 
CAS Registry Number:  1224844  
 
Molecular Formula:  C15H15N7O  M.W.:  309.3  
 
Approximate Solubility:  MLN0128 (TAK -228) exhibits a pH -dependent  aqueous solubility: at 
physiological pH the solubility is approximately 0.1 mg/mL and at or  below pH 3 the solubility is 
greater than 15 mg/mL.  
 
Mode of Action:  MLN0128 (TAK -228) is a non -rapamycin analog mTOR (mechanistic target of 
rapamycin) kinase inhibitor.  The mTOR kinase regulates cell growth, translational control, 
angiogenesis, and cell  survival by [CONTACT_259780].  The mTOR complex 
(TORC) is an intracellular point of convergence for a number of cellular signaling pathways.  
MLN0128 (TAK -228) is a potent and selective adenosine tri -phosphate (ATP) -competitive 
inhibitor of mTOR complex 1 and 2 (TORC1/2).  
 
Description:  MLN0128 (TAK -228) drug substance is a white to off -white, crystalline powder.  
 
How Supplied:  MLN0128  (TAK -228)  is supplied by [CONTACT_24312], Inc. and 
distributed by [CONTACT_259781] M anagement Branch, CTEP/DCTD/NCI as size [ADDRESS_315929] gelatin 
capsules in the following strengths: 1 mg (white opaque color)  and 3 mg (orange opaque color).  
The composition of the drug product consists of a blend of MLN0128 (TAK -228) drug substance, 
microcrystal line cellulose, and magnesium stearate.  Milled  formulations will have a white label 
with a large watermark of the strength on the label.

short -term excursions between 2°C and 40°C.   
 
Route  of Administration:  Orally, given [ADDRESS_315930] prior to swallowing.  Each dose should be taken with 8 ounces 
(240 mL) of water.  
 
Potential Drug Interactions:   Multiple human metabolizing enzymes are involved in the Phase I 
metabolism of MLN0128  (TAK -228).  When normalized for human liver content, the CYP 
isoforms CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to contribute to MLN0128 (TAK -228) 
metabolism.  MLN0128 (TAK -228) displayed low potential (IC 50 > 25 μM) for inhibition of the 
major human CYP isoforms.  
 
Patient Care Implications:  Women of childbearing potential should use effective methods of 
contraception during and through [ADDRESS_315931] dose of MLN0128  (TAK -228).  Men should 
use effective methods of contraception and not donate sperm  during and through [ADDRESS_315932] dose of MLN0128  (TAK -228).

8.2 Agent Ordering  and Agent Accountability  
 
8.2.1 NCI-supplied agents may be requested by [CONTACT_079] (or their authorized 
designee ) at each participating institution.  Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB) 
policy requires that agent be shipped directly to the institution where the patient is to be 
treated.  PMB does not permit the transfer of agents between institutions (unless prio r 
approval from PMB is obtained).  The CTEP -assigned protocol number mus t be used for 
ordering all CTEP -supplied investigational agents.  The responsible investigator at each 
participating institution must be registered with CTEP, DCTD through an annual 
submission of FDA Form 1572 (Statement of Investigator), Curriculum Vitae, 
Supplemental Investigator Data Form (IDF), and Financial Disclosure Form (FDF).  If 
there are several participating investigators at one institution, CTEP -supplied 
investigational agents for the study should be ordered under the name [CONTACT_25559].  
 
In general, sites may order initial agent supplies when a subject is being screened for 
enrollment onto the study.

9.1 Biomarker Studies  
 
9.1.1 Plasma Pharmacokinetics  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hypothesis and R ationale   
 
Hypothesis:  In those patients with inadequate drug exposure, inhibition of 4EBP1 
phosphorylation and other cellular effects of mTOR dual i nhibitors assayed as 
described in Sections 9.1.2 -9.1.6 will be limited.  
 
NCI Protocol #: 9775  
Local Protocol #: MC1482  
NCI Version Date:  October 2, 2017  44 
 
Rationale:  These studies are necessary to characterize the pharmacokinetics of 
MLN0128 (TAK -228) in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and to assess 
pharmacodynamic relations hips with phosphorylated mTOR substrates and 
expression levels of BCL2L11 (Bim) , BBC3 (Puma) , MCL1  and BCL2 . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assay Validity and A ppropriateness for Study 
 
Plasma and marrow concentrations of MLN0128 (TAK -228) will be measured by 
[CONTACT_259763]/ms/ms methods developed in the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center Pharmacology Shared 
Resource.  The Shared Resource, directed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Reid, is fully equipped to carry out 
pharmacologic investigations, including two exquisitely sensitive Xevo  TQ-S mass 
spectrometers with Accuity UPLC systems to carry out the bioanalytical 
measurements, and licenses for Phoenix WINNONLIN, NONMEM and PsN Pi[INVESTIGATOR_259732]/PD analyses.  The laboratory has developed 
or modified assays for more than 75 antitumor agents, served as a central analytical 
and pharmacokinetics resource laboratory for 9 published NCI -sponsored Phase I and 
Phase II trials with vorinostat (for example, 47, 48, 49), and serves as one of the 
pharmacology resource laboratories for  the Children’s Oncology Group.  The 
approach to assay development and implementation of criteria for system suitability, 
quality  assurance and ongoing evaluation of specific assay data are consistent with 
recommendations from two FDA -sponsored  conferences on analytical methods 
validation (50, 51) that are described in a recent FDA guidance document "Guidance 
for Industry: Bioanalytical Method Validation" (52).  In particular, as we develop a 
specific HPLC or other method for measurement of  drug and relevant metabolites, we 
incorporate standard assessments of drug extraction efficiency, sensitivity, linearity, 
precision,  accuracy, storage stability and other parameters relevant to the particular 
method.   Assay perf ormance is thoroughly validated before implementation in the 
clinical tria l and monitored on a routine basis during the course of the clinical trial by 
[CONTACT_259782].  The plasma concentration -time 
data will be will be analyzed by [CONTACT_259783] W inNonlin (Pharsight Corp., St. Louis, MO) to determine Cmax, 
Tmax, half -life and accumulation.   If sufficient data are available, the data will also 
be analyzed by [CONTACT_105] -linear mixed effects modeling using the  program NONMEM 
7.2.0 (ICON Development Solutions , Ellicot City, MD) to determine oral clearance, 
volume of distribution,  sources of inter - and intra -subject variability, and 
pharmacodynamic relationships with phosphorylated mTOR substrates and  
expression levels of BCL2L11 (Bim) , BBC3 (Puma) , MCL1  and BCL2. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Performance Site   
 
The assay will be performed in the Pharmacology Shared Resource of the Mayo 
Clinic Cancer Center.  This lab has extensive experience with developi[INVESTIGATOR_007], validating 
and implementing assays for a variety of anticancer drugs, including m TOR dual 
inhibitors, as well as performing pharmacokinetic analysis after performance of the 
assays in preclinical and clinical studies.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Justification of the N umber of Patients and S pecimens   
 
The purpose of the assay is to provide information about drug exposure that can be 
utilized for interpretation of pharmacodynamic  and clinical response endpoints . 
Meaningful conclusions regarding the impact of drug exposure can only be drawn for 
those patients in whom the assays are performed.  Accordingly, the plan is to measure 
serum pharmacokinetics in all patients.  The number of samples (15 per patient) is 
required to assure sufficient data to allow calculation of standard pharmacokinetic 
parameters.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Description of B iological Samples R equired for Assay 
 
This assay of serum MLN0128 (TAK -228) levels requires procurement of 6 cc of 
blood at 15 time points as described in detail in Section 9. 2.1.2 .  Risks of blood 
sample procurement  include pain, infection and bleeding  at the site of venous heparin 
lock placement as well as development of heparin -induced thrombocytopenia.   Sterile 
technique is utilized to minimize risk of infection.  With an adequate platelet count 
(10,000 or more) and local pressure, the risk of bleedi ng is low.  Heparin -induced 
thrombocytopenia is rare; and patients’ platelet counts will be monitored daily for 
several days after the venipuncture, with platelet transfusions mandated for 
thrombocytopenia as indicated in Section 5.2 (generally for bleedin g or platelet count 
less than 10,000 unless a higher threshold is deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_259784], infection or invasive procedure) .  It is conceivable that 
infection s or bleeding  could be life threatening, but the risk of dea th after 
venipuncture is considered extremely rare (estimated to be 1 in 50 million) . 
 
9.1.2 Overview of Cell -Based Studies  
 
Cell-based studies in this section are presented in the order in which they are prioritized.  
The rationale for this prioritization, whic h is that proof -of-mechanism studies (including 
the integrated biomarker) take higher priority th an studies  outside the direct mechanism 
of action of this class of agents, is described in detail in Section 2.4.7.   Additional details 
regarding these assays,  including sample processing at the assay site and 
performance characteristics of the assays, are found in Appendix D. 
 
9.1.3 Phospho -Thr37,46-4EBP1 analysis of pretreatment and day 8 bone marrow samples by

[IP_ADDRESS]  Hypothesis and Rationale  
 
Hypothesis:  4EBP1 phosphorylation will be inhibited by [CONTACT_161767]0128 (TAK -228) in

Rationale:  Previous studies have shown that mTOR dual inhibitors such as 
MLN0128 (TAK -228) and OSI -027 diminish the mTORC1 -mediated

phosphorylation of the translation inhibitor 4EBP1, causing it to bind to and inhibit 
the translation factor eIF4E (14, 18).  In ALL cell lines the down  regulation  of 
4EBP1 produces resistance to mTOR dual inhibitors (14), demonstrating the critical 
role of this protein in killing by [CONTACT_259785].  We now propose to assess 
whether 4EBP1 has been dephosphoryla ted in leukemic blasts by [CONTACT_259786]0128 (TAK -228) concentration s in situ  as a proof of mechanism.

extent of phosphorylation observed in baseli ne ALL samples (Appendix C).  
Preliminary studies presented to the Biomarker Review Committee indicated a strong 
correlation ( R2  > 0.94) between results observed when samples with a wide range of 
4EBP1 phosphorylation were run on separate SDS -polyacrylami de gels and probed.

The purpose of the assay  is to determine whether MLN0128 (TAK -228) induces 
dephosphorylation of an mTORC1 target in leukemia  cells in situ  at clinically

Jeko mantle cell lymphoma xenografts after treatment of mice with the mTOR dual 
inhibitor OSI -027, which induced regression of the xenografts  (18). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Description of B iological Samples R equired for Assay  
 
This assay of paired samples depends upon procurement of bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259733] 8 of therapy.  A pretreatment bone marrow

downstream apoptotic pathways).  Risks of bon e marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259736],

provided to minimize pain.  Sterile technique is utilized to minimize risk of infection.  
With an adequate platelet count (10,000 or more) and local pressure, the risk of 
bleeding is low.  It is conceivable that bleeding, infection or complications of the

To assess whether this alteration in signaling can also conceivably be detected at 
earlier timepoints and in more accessible cells, for patients treated at Mayo Clinic

detection of multiple antigens on the same filter without interference.  Once phospho -
4EBP1 has been successfully detected, we propose to use the same filters for 
detection of additional antigens, which are presented below in the order in which they 
will be examined.  Because we routinely detect 10 -14 antigens on a duplicate pair of

corresponding total protein controls)  if the molecular weights do not over lap and 
suitable sec ondary antibodies are available , we do not anticipate difficulty in 
completing the proposed immunoblotting with the available samples.  
 
9.1.4 Phospho -Ser473 Analysis of Pretreatment and Day 8 B one Marrow Samples by 
[CONTACT_259788] ( Exploratory B iomarker)  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hypothesis and Rationale  
 
Hypothesis: AKT  Ser473 phosphorylation will be inhibited by [CONTACT_161767]0128 (TAK -228) 
in situ . 
 
Rationale:  Previous studies have shown that mTOR dual inhibitors such as 
MLN0128 (TAK -228) and OSI -027 diminish the mTORC2 -mediated 
phosphorylation of the pro -survival kinase AKT  on Ser473, leading to upregulation of 
the pro -apoptotic protein BCL2L11 ( Bim) and induction of apoptosis (14, 18). In 
ALL cell lines the down regulation  of the mTORC2 component Rictor reproduces 
these effects and down regulation  of BCL2L11 ( Bim) produces resistance to mTOR 
dual inhibitors (14), demonstrating the critical role of signaling cascade in killing by 
[CONTACT_259785]. We now propose to assess whether AKT  Ser473 has been 
dephosphorylated in leukemic blasts by [CONTACT_259789]0128 (TAK -
228) concentration in situ  as a p roof of mechanism for this class of agent.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Data S upporting the Degree  of Biomarker “Fit for Purpose”    
 
As indicated above, unpublished data using a commercially available anti-phospho -
Ser473-AKT  antibody demonstrate a 32-fold dynamic range for detection of this 
antigen that encompasses the baseline antigen phosphorylation in clinical ALL 
specimens.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Justification of the Number of Patients and Specimens    
 
The purpose of the  assay is to determine whether MLN0128 (TAK -228) induce s 
dephosphorylation of an mTORC2  target in leukemia cells in situ  at clinically 
achievable concentrations.  After the signal for phospho -Ser473-AKT  is quantitated, 
results will be examined graphically to assess the extent and frequency of down 
regulation  as described in Section 13.4.6.  This will be the first opportunity to assess 
AKT  phosphorylation in ALL after treatment with an mTOR dual inhibitor, so the 
extent and frequency of down regulation  cannot be estimated from precedent data.  
As a point of reference, however, complete dephosphorylation of AKT  Ser473 was 
observed  in Jeko ma ntle cell lymphoma xenografts  after treatment of mice with the 
mTOR dual inhibitor OSI -027, which induced regression of the xenografts (18). 
 
9.1.5 Expression of BCL2L11 ( Bim), BBC3 ( Puma ), MCL1 and B CL2 Proteins in 
Pretreatment and Day 8 Bone Marrow Samples by [CONTACT_259790] (Exploratory 
Biomarker s) 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hypothesis and Rationale  
 
Hypothesis: Levels of BCL2L11 ( Bim) and BBC3 ( Puma ) in ALL will increase 
during MLN0128 (TAK -228) treatment, whereas levels of MCL1  and possibly 
BCL2 will decrease.  
 
Rationale:  Previous studies have shown that mTOR dual inhibitors such as 
MLN0128 (TAK -228) and OSI -027 cause upregulation of the pro -apoptotic BCL2  
family members BBC3 ( Puma ) and BCL2L11 ( Bim) in malignant lymphoid cells  
(14, 18).  In ALL cell lines the down regulation  of BBC3 ( Puma ) or BCL2L11 ( Bim) 
produces resistance to mTOR dual inhibitors (14, 18), demonstrating the critical role 
of these proteins  in killing by [CONTACT_259785].  Conversely, the anti -apoptotic 
BCL2  family member MCL1  has been shown to decreas e after treatment with 
mTOR dual inhibitors in certain malignant human lymphoid cell lines (18).  
Overexpression of eponymous BCL2  has also been shown to convey resistance to 
mTOR dual inhibitors (18).  Accordingly, we propose to assess whether BCL2L11 
(Bim) and BBC3 ( Puma) have been upregulated or MCL1  down regulated  in 
leukemic blasts by [CONTACT_259789]0128 (TAK -228) concentration 
in situ  as a further proof of mechanism for this class of agent.

Immunoblotting will be performed to assess BCL2L11 (Bim) , BBC3 (Puma) , MCL1 
and B CL2 in mononuclear cells isolated from pretreatment and day [ADDRESS_315938].  The advantages of 
immunoblotting over qRT -PCR are i) the proteins that are regulating apoptosis are 
actually being measured rather than mRNA levels , which  might not correlate with 
protein levels; and ii) all of these proteins persist  in mitochondria as cells undergo 
apoptosis, whereas mRNA is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_259738].  The 
Kaufmann laboratory has previously used this immunoblotting approach to examine 
differences in B CL2 family members among different cell lines (41) and pretreatment 
acute leuke mia samples (58) as well as changes in B CL2, M CL1 and BCL2L11 
(Bim) during the cours e of acute leukemia (40) and lymphoma treatment (59).

BCL2 in ALL  cells in situ  at clinically achievable concentrations.  After the signal for 
BCL2L11 ( Bim), BBC3 ( Puma ), MCL1 and B CL2 is quantitated, results will be 
examined graphically to assess the extent and frequency of down regulation  as 
described in Section 13.4.6.  This will be the first opportunity to assess these B CL2 
family members  in clinical ALL after treatment with an mTOR dual inhibitor  in vivo , 
so the extent and frequency of altered expression  cannot be estimated from precedent 
data.  As a point of reference, however, induction of BBC3 ( Puma ) was observed in 
Jeko mantle cell lymphoma xenografts after treatment of mice with the mTOR dual

NCI Version Date:  October 2, 2017  51 
 
In the consensus review of this Protocol, CTEP reviewers suggested that additional 
BCL2 family members also be examined, specifically noting that BCL2L1 (Bcl -xL) 
and BCL2L2 (Bcl -w) would be of interest.  These analytes  are prioritized lower than 
the four BCL2 family members listed above because i) changes in BCL2L1 and 
BCL2L2 have not been directly implicated in the mechanism of cytotoxicity of 
MLN0128 (TAK -228) in ALL cells and ii)  we accordingly have not characterized  
assays for these proteins to the same extent as we have the proof -of-mechanism 
studies and cannot comment on the dynamic range, fitness of purpose, or appropriate 
standards that will encompass the expression levels likely found in clinical ALL 
samples.    
 
 
9.1.6 Reverse Phase Protein A rray for  Protein Phosphorylations and E xpression  (Exploratory 
Biomarkers)  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hypothesis and R ationale  
 
Hypothesis: Changes in phosphorylation of mTOR substrates and complementary 
pathway components will change during the course of mT OR dual inhibitor 
treatment.  
 
Rationale:  Prior publications have identified differences in the pattern of protein 
phosphorylation between cell lines that are sensitive to kinase inhibitors and similar 
cell lines that are resistant (e.g., 44, 45). Preliminary studies in the Kaufmann 
laboratory have likewise demonstrated differences in protein phosphorylation at key 
nodes between parental Nalm6 ALL cells and Nalm6 cells selected for the ability to 
grow continuously in mTOR dual inhibitor  (C. Correia, K. L. B. Knorr, S. Yun, A. E. 
Wahner Hendrickson, B. Madden, D. McCormick, S. Dasari, and S. H. Kaufmann, 
unpublished observations). Thus, we hypothesize that pretreatment patterns of 
phosphorylation might differ between ALLs that respond to MLN0128 (TAK -228) 
and those that do not.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assay Validity and Appropriateness for Study  
 
Reverse phase protein arrays (RPPAs) will be utilized to assess levels of 
phosphorylation of 60 key proteins, including 4EBP1, ribosomal protein S6, and 
AKT , as well as expression levels of 200 proteins , including BCL2 , BCL2L1 ( Bcl-
xL), MCL1, and BCL2L11 ( Bim).  Alternative approaches to assessing expression of 
these proteins include ELISA, immunohistochemistry , immunoblotting  and qRT -
PCR.  The major advantage of reverse phase protein array  is the ability to assess the 
signal s related to multiple antigens i n a quantitative fashion.  Like ELISA or 
immunohistochemistry , this method assumes that the signal is due to the antigen of 
interest; and there is no opportunity to rule out cross  reactivity with an antigen of a 
different molecular mass.   On the RPPAs, for example, the BBC3 ( Puma ) signal will 
be unreliable because the commercial antibody used recognizes a band that is present

even in BBC3-/- human cells  (K.L. Peterson and S.H. Kaufmann, unpublished 
observations) .  The advantages of RPPA  over qRT -PCR are that in RPPA  the proteins 
and posttranslational modifications that are  regulating apoptosis are actually being 
measured rather than mRNA levels , which  might not correlate with protein levels.  
This analysis of key signaling pathways will be u tilized to supplement the results of 
the more targeted immunoblotting assays.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Perform ance site    
 
After mononuclear cells are isolated on Ficoll -Hypaque  gradients, w hole cell lysates  
will be prepared  in the Kaufmann laboratory of the Mayo Clinic Cancer Ce nter.  
Based on preliminary results, the same lysates prepared for immunoblotting (see 
Section 9.1.2) are suitable for RPPAs.  The RPPAs will be probed and initial 
bioinformatic analysis performed in the RPPA Core Facility of the M.D. Anderson 
Cancer Cente r, which is a fee -for-service facility.

standard of Western blotting, has been published by [CONTACT_259791] e RPPA Core 
Facility at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (60). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Justification of the Number of P atients and Specimens   
 
The purpose s of this  assay are: i) to confirm the results obtained in the assays 
described in Sections 9.1.2-9.1.4 using different antibodies and a different analytical 
platform and ii) to assess the status of other signaling pathways before and after 
exposure to MLN0128 (TAK -228) in sit u. This will be the first opportunity to assess 
the performance of this assay  in ALL after treatment with an mTOR dual inhibitor, so 
the extent and frequency of altered phosphorylation or expression of various proteins 
cannot be estimated from precedent da ta.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Plans for comparison of immunoblotting and RPPA results  
 
Immunoblotting and blot quantification will be performed as described in Appendix 
C. Comparison of the relative signal in day 1 and day 8 samples from individual 
patients (run on adjacent lanes of the same gel and compared to a standard curve) will 
allow a calculation of % change in signal between the two samples.  Likewise, 
comparison of the two samples (day 1 and day 8) subjected to RPPA will allow a 
calculation of a % change bet ween day 1 and day 8.  To compare the assays for any 
particular analyte (e.g., the integrated biomarker phospho -Thr37,46-4EBP1 ), we will 
construct a scatter plot with the % change in the immunoblotting assay on the x axis 
and the % change in the RPPA assay  on the y axis, inspect the distribution of the 
values, and calculate a Spearman correlation coefficient.   Because these assays have 
not been previously performed in this manner, we cannot estimate the  value of that

protein (identified by [CONTACT_259792]3-/- cells) is detected by 
[CONTACT_259793] a spurious cross -reactive antigen is detected in the RPPA assays.   
If correlation coefficients closer to 1.0 are observed in assays of other analytes in 
common between the two platforms, we will take this as a sign that the RPPA is a 
reasonable approximation of the i mmunoblotting assay and examine RPPA results for 
other antigens (not included in the immunoblotting) for potentially interesting 
patterns, e.g., differences in BCL2L2 (Bcl -w) expression that might not be feasible 
with the limited material available for imm unoblotting.  
 
9.1.7 Transcriptional Profiling ( Exploratory Biomarker)  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hypothesis and R ationale  
 
Hypothesis: Treatment with MLN0128 (TAK -228) will activate two transcriptional 
pathways related to apoptosis.  
 
Rationale:  Previous studies have shown that the mTOR dual inhibitor OSI -[ADDRESS_315940] transcriptional pathways in ALL cell lines during the course of 
upregulating BCL2L11 (Bim)  and BBC3 (Puma)  to induce apoptosis  (14).  If 
sufficient material is available t o allow isolation of RNA (after samples for 
immunoblotting and RPPAs have been harvested), samples will be subjected to RNA 
sequencing (RNAseq) to determine whether MLN0128 (TAK -228) concentrations 
achievable in vivo  activate these same transcriptional pat hways as a proof of 
mechanism study.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assay Validity and Appropriateness for Study  
 
RNAseq will be performed using RNA isolated  from  Ficoll -Hypaque purified 
pretreatment and day 8 bone marrow cells to assess whether transcriptional changes 
observed in clinical ALL leading to BCL2L11 (Bim)  and BBC3 (Puma)  upregulation 
are also observed in clinical ALL treated in vivo.  Alternative approaches to assessing 
transcript levels include quantitative RT -PCR.  The major advantages of RNAseq are: 
i) message can be quantitated relative to total number of mRNA molecules rather than 
relative to an arbitrary standard, which might or might not change during the course 
of treatment; ii) the entire transcriptome is int errogated in a quantitative fashion one 
assay; and iii) the assay also provides sequence information that can be examined to 
search for alterations in splicing and mutations in various messages.  This is the same 
assay that was utilized to identify the tra nscriptional pathways that are altered in 
mTOR dual inhibitor -treated ALL cell lines, with subsequent confirmation of results 
by [CONTACT_16641] -PCR (14).

13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
13.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 
This is a phase II study in relapsed or refractory ALL patients treated with MLN0128 
(TAK -228). This study will use a one -stage design with an interim analysis to evaluate 
the efficacy of MLN0128 (TAK -228) in this patient population.  
 
13.1.1  Primary Endpoint   
The primary endpoint of this trial is complete response (CR, CRi) rate.  A complete 
response will be considered synonymous with “success”.   All patients meeting the 
eligibility criteria who have signe d a consent form and have begun treatment will be 
evaluable for response.  
 
13.1.[ADDRESS_315965] 6 months.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of Primary Endpoint   
The primary endpoint of this trial is complete response rate.  A complete response is 
defined to be a CR  or CRi noted as the objective status at any time during treatment.  
Response will be evaluated using all cycles of treatment.  All patients meeting the 
eligibility crite ria who have signed a consent form and have begun treatment will be 
evaluable for response.   
 
13.1.2 .2 Estimation  
The proportion of successes will be estimated by [CONTACT_124462].  Ninety -five percent Duffy -Santner  confidence 
intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated.   
 
13.1.2 .3 Primary Endpoint Evaluable Patient Exception  
Patients not being treated at the safe dose level (see section 13.5) will be summarized 
separately for the primary endpoint and will not be included when evaluating the final 
decision rule.   
 
13.1.[ADDRESS_315966] shown a CR rate ranging from 20 
to 47% (61, 62).  Responses can vary by [CONTACT_259801].  
Due to the heterogeneity of this disease, a response rate of 10% with MLN0128 (TAK -
228) would not be of interest.  The largest success proportion where the proposed 
treatment regimen would be considered ineffective in this population is 10%, and the 
NCI Protocol #: 9775  
Local Protocol #: MC1482  
NCI Version Date:  October 2, [ADDRESS_315967] success proportion that would warrant subsequent studies with the proposed 
regimen i n this patient population is 30%.  The following one -stage design with an 
interim analysis uses [ADDRESS_315968] 10%.   
 
13.1. 2.[ADDRESS_315969] 2, 
we will continue accrual.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Final Decision Rule  
Enter [ADDRESS_315970] 2 6 evaluable patients, we 
may recommend further testing of this regimen in subsequent studies in this population.  
 
13.1. 2.7 Over Accrual   
If more than the target number of patients are accrued  at the safe dose , the additional 
patients will not be used to evaluate the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_259745] i n any decision making 
process; however, they will be included in final endpoint estimates and confidence 
intervals.  
 
NOTE: We will not suspend accrual at the interi m analysis to allow the first 11  patients 
to become evaluable, unless undue toxicity is observed.   Given the limited overall 
sample size and  the inclusion of an adverse eve nts stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877], we feel it is ethical to 
not halt accrual for the interim analysis.  However, if accrual is extremely rapid, we 
may temporarily suspend accrual in order to obtain safety data on these patients before 
re-opening accrual to further patient s. 
 
13.1.3   Power and Significance Level    
Assuming that the number of successes is binomially distributed, the significance level is 
.09, i.e. there is a 9% chance of finding the drug to be effective when it truly is not.  The 
probability of declaring that this regimen warrants further study (i.e. statistical power) 
and the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_259746] a function of the true success proportion as shown in the following 
table.  
  
NCI Protocol #: 9775  
Local Protocol #: MC1482  
NCI Version Date:  October 2, 2017  68 
 
 
If the true success proportion is...  0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 
 
Then the probability of declaring that the regimen 
warrants further study is…  0.09 0.28 0.52 0.72 0.85 
and the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_259747] ...  
 0.70 0.49 0.32 0.20 0.11 
               
13.1.4  Other Considerations   
Adverse events, quality/duration of response, and patterns of treatment failure observed 
in this study, as well as scientific discoveries or changes in standard care will be taken 
into account in any decision to terminate the study.  
 
13.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 
13.2.1  Sample Size    
The one -stage design with an interim analysis to be utilized is fully described above. A 
maximum of 2 6 evaluable patients will be accrued onto this phase II study unless undue 
toxicity is encountered.  If there is undue toxicity in the initial safety cohort (see section 
13.5), an additional [ADDRESS_315971] pat ient has 
been on treatment for 6 months.  
 
13.2.3  Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  This study will be available to all eligible patients, regardless of race, gender, or ethnic 
origin.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  There is no information currently available regarding differential effects of this regimen 
in subsets defined by [CONTACT_545], gender, or ethnicity, and there is no reason to expect such 
differences to exist.   Therefore, although the planned analysis will, as always, look for 
differences in treatm ent effect based on racial and gender groupi[INVESTIGATOR_14839], the sample size is 
not increased in order to provide additional power for subset analyses.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  The geographical region served by [CONTACT_259802] a population that includes approxi -
mately 7% minorities.   Based on prior Mayo phase [ADDRESS_315972] about 7% of patients will be classified as minorities by [CONTACT_259803] #: 9775

13.4 Analysis of Secondary /Tertiary Endpoints  
 
13.4.1 The overall response rate will be estimated by [CONTACT_259805] (CR , CRi , PR, or MLFS ) divided by [CONTACT_128773].   
All evaluable patients will be used for this analysis. Exact binomial 95% confidence 
intervals for the true overall re sponse rate will be calculated.   
 
13.4.2 Duration of complete response (CR/CRi) is defined for all evaluable patients who have 
achieved a complete response as the time from the date at which the patient’s objective 
status is first noted to be a CR to the earliest date progression is documented.  The 
distribution of duration of complete response will be estimated using the method of 
Kaplan -Meier.  
 
13.4.[ADDRESS_315973] after achieving response (CR, CRi, PR, 
or MLFS) to MLN0128 (TAK -228) will be estimated by [CONTACT_259806] #: 9775  
Local Protocol #: MC1482  
NCI Version Date:  October 2, [ADDRESS_315974] binomial 95% confidence intervals for the 
true overall response rate will be calculated.   
 
13.4.[ADDRESS_315975] initiated treatment will be considered evaluable for 
assessing adverse event rate(s).  The maximum grade for each type of advers e event will 
be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine patterns.  
Additionally, the relationship of the adverse event(s) to the study treatment will be taken 
into consideration.  
 
13.4.[ADDRESS_315976] to the correlative component of this study (Goal 1.2.5 -1.2.9) are 
intended to be hypothesis -generating and descriptive in nature.  Due to the exploratory 
nature of the correlative endpoints, we will not adjust for multiple comparisons for t hese 
analyses.  
 
Descriptive statistics and simple scatterplots will form the basis of presentation of these 
data and any calculated changes from baseline .  Single sample t -tests, Wilcoxon signed 
rank tests or McNamar’s tests may be employed as appropriate.   Data may be compared 
between success and failure groups using two sample t -tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests.  
Correlations between these laboratory values and other outcome measures will be carried 
out by [CONTACT_259807] (Pearson’s and 
Spearman’s coefficients).

study  on dose 0 ( 3 mg, orally days 1 -21).  If [ADDRESS_315978] 6 patients experience a 
dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) as defined below, then 6 patients w ill be enrolled on dose -1 
(2 mg, orally days 1 -21).  If 2 or more of the second 6 patients experience DLT, then the 
study will be terminated.  
 
13.5.2  Toxicity will be measured per NCI -CTCAE version 4. DLT is defined as an adverse 
event possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment that meets one of the 
following:  
 •    Any grade 4 drug -related non -hematological toxicity  
•    Any grade 3 drug -related non -hemat ological toxicity that does not resolve to < 
grade 3 within 3 days, with the following exceptions:  
o Grade [ADDRESS_315979], ALT, Alkaline phosphatase will be 
considered DLT only if it does not recover to <grade 3 within 7 d ays  
•    Myelosuppression: hypoplasia (bone marrow cellularity <10%) >50 days

13.6 Data Monitoring  
 
The principal investigator(s) and the study statistician will review the study at least twice 
a year to identify accrual, adverse event, and any endpoint probl ems that might be 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  The accrual and safety data provided by [CONTACT_259808] (MCCC) Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) at least twice a year, or more frequently as warranted . 
 
13.6.1  Adverse Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_259748].  We note that the Adverse Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_257030] (1) the study re -opening to accrual or (2) at any time during the conduct of 
the trial and in consideration of newly acquired information regarding the adverse event 
profile of the treatment(s) under investigation.  The study team may choose to suspend 
accrual because of unexpected adverse event pr ofiles that have not crossed the specified 
rule below.  
 
Accrual will be temporarily suspended to this study if at any time we observe events 
considered at least possibly related to study treatment (i.e. an adverse event with attribute 
specified as  “possib le”, “probable”, or “definite”) that satisfy any of the following:  
 
• If [ADDRESS_315980] possibly related to treatment  excluding fatigue, 
fever, infection, and lab abnorm alities (hyper - or hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, 
hyperuricemia, hypophosphatemia) that resolve within 7 days without 
jeopardizing patient safety.  
 
• If after the first [ADDRESS_315981] been treated, 25% of patients experience grade [ADDRESS_315982] possibly related to treatment  excluding fatigue, 
fever, infection, and lab abnormalities (hyper - or hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, 
hyperuricemia, hypophosphatemia) that resolve within 7 days without 
jeopardizing patient safety.  
 
 We note that we will review grade 4 and 5 adverse events deemed “unrelated” or 
“unlikely to be related”, to verify their attribution and to monitor the emergence of a 
previously unrecognized treatment -related adverse event.

Local Protocol #: MC1482  
NCI Version Date:  October 2, [ADDRESS_315984] be assessed for response to treatment, even if there 
are major protocol tre atment deviations or if they are ineligible.  Each patient will be 
assigned one of the following categories:  1) complete response, 2) partial response, 3) 
stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6) early 
death from t oxicity, 7) early death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, 
insufficient data).  [Note:  By [CONTACT_480], category 9 usually designates the 
“unknown” status of any type of data in a clinical database.]  
 
All of the patients who me t the eligibility criteria (with the possible exception of those 
who received no study medication) should be included in the main analysis of the 
response rate.  Patients in response categories [ADDRESS_315985] a 
treatment failure (disease progression).  Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule or drug 
administration does not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response rate.  Precise 
definitions for categories [ADDRESS_315986] been identified ( e.g., early death due to other reasons, early 
discontinuation of treatment, major protocol vi olations, etc.).  However, these sub 
analyses  may not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions concerning treatment 
efficacy, and the reasons for excluding patients from the analysis should be clearly 
reported.  The 95% confidence intervals should also b e provided.

APPENDIX E: ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING PR OPOSED 
BIOMARKER STUDIES  
 
 
Per the instructions in the CTEP Protocol Template, this appendix is constructed to provide 
information on endpoint validation including additional background (as needed), description of 
the assay(s) used, materials and methods, a nd assay validation .  The integrated biomarker 
(phospho -Thr37,46-4EBP1 phosphorylation by [CONTACT_259812] 8 marrows) has previously been reviewed by [CONTACT_259813]; and that 
material is provided here in case that review is not provided to reviewers of this protocol.   
Similar information about the exploratory biomarkers is provided in more abbreviated form per 
our interpretation of the template instructions.   
 
Biomarkers are provided in the order of their priority, highest to lowest.  The rationale for this 
priority is provided in Section 2.4.7 of the main body of the protocol.  
 
1. Phospho -Thr37,46-4EBP1 Analysis of Pretreatment and Day 8 Bone Marrow Samples by 
[CONTACT_259788]  
 
1.1 Role in Trial: Integrated B iomarker.  This is the top priority assay and will be 
performed first on every available sample from the trial.  
 
1.2 Hypothesis and R ationale  
 
Hypothesis:  4EBP1 phosphorylation will be inhibited by [CONTACT_161767]0128 (TAK -228) in 
situ. 
 
Rationale:  Previ ous studies have shown that mTOR dual inhibitors such as MLN0128 
(TAK -228) and OSI -027 diminish the mTORC1 -mediated phosphorylation of the 
translation inhibitor 4EBP1, causing it to bind to and inhibit the translation initiation 
factor eIF4E (1, 2). In acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cell lines, the down 
regulation  of 4EBP1 produces resistance to mTOR dual inhibitors (2), demonstrating 
the critical role of this protein in killing by [CONTACT_259785].  We now propose to 
assess whether 4EBP1 has been dephosphorylated in leukemic blasts by 
[CONTACT_259814]0128 concentrations in situ  as a proof of mechanism.  
 
Results of these assays will not help individual patients on this trial but might be 
particularly useful to clinical investigators thinking about future development of this 
class of age nts:  If ALL fails to respond and 4EBP1 remains phosphorylated, this 
might imply that the 4EBP1 pathway has been inadequately targeted at therapeutically 
achievable concentrations, e.g., because toxicities in normal tissues preclude adequate 
drug levels, t ransport -mediated resistance diminishes ALL drug uptake, or signaling 
alterations restore 4EBP1 phosphorylation in the absence of mTOR. On the other

Local Protocol #: MC1482  
NCI Version Date:  October 2, [ADDRESS_316006] Operating Procedure 
previously provided to the Biomarker Review Committee (pp. 16 - 26 of this appendix).  
In brief, 4EBP1 phosphorylation will be assessed by [CONTACT_259815] (1).  Detailed procedures for immunoblotting have been previously published 
by [CONTACT_259765] (3, 4).  Sources of critical reagents are identified in the 
following description.  
 
After sequential samples of bone marrow blasts (harvested prior to treatment and on 
day 8 of therapy) are subjected to SDS -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in adjacent 
wells using standard techniques and electrophoresis grade reagents from BioRad as 
previously described (3, 4), proteins will be transferred to Biotrace NT nitrocellulose 
(Pall #[ZIP_CODE]) .  After blocking according to standard techniques (4), blots will be 
incubated overnight with rabbit anti -phospho -Thr36,47-4EBP1 monoclonal antibody 
236B4 (Cell  Signaling Technology product #2855) diluted 1:1000 in buffer consisting 
of 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma -Aldrich #A7906) in 150 mM NaCl -10 mM Tris -
HCl (pH 7.4 at 20 °C) containing 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mM sodium azide, 100 U/ml 
penicillin G, and 100 µg/ml st reptomycin.  Blots will be washed, incubated with 0.125 
µg/ml horseradish peroxidase -coupled goat anti -rabbit IgG (KPL #074 -1506) in 5% 
(w/v) powdered nonfat dry milk in [ADDRESS_316007] Dura enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Thermo 
#[ZIP_CODE]), and exposed to high sensitivity x -ray film (Phenix Research Products #F -
BX810).  
 
Because it is difficult to purify and reproducibly phosphorylate 4EBP1, aliquots of 
lysate from the Nalm6 human ALL cell line (aut henticated by [CONTACT_259816]) will be lyophilized in 
single -use aliquots and stored at -80 °C.  Serial dilutions of these lysates on each blot 
will serve as a positive control and provide a sta ndard curve for quantitation.  This cell 
line was chosen because our studies have shown that it contains high levels of phospho -
Thr37,46-4EBP1 (see Fig.  2 below).   Blots exposed in the linear range will be scanned on 
an Epson [ADDRESS_316008] Operating Procedure attached at the end of  
this appendix.    
 
1.4 Source of Samples   
 
Marrow mononuclear cells (typic ally at least 80% malignant lymphoid cells in ALL 
specimens —ref. 5, 6) will be harvested by [CONTACT_138789] -Hypaque  gradient centrifugation (7)

from bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259750] 8 ± 1 of treatment 
with single -agent MLN0128 (TAK -228).  Day [ADDRESS_316009] -treatment 
sample based several considerations:  
• In published murine xenograft experiments (1), 4EBP1 dephosphorylation is 
detectable in xenografts at early time points after dual mTOR inhibitor treatment 
and maintained for the duration of drug exposure.  This observation is presented in 
Fig. 4 below.   On the other hand, induction of critical signaling steps downstream 
of 4EBP1 s uch as PARP cleavage, which could be assessed in the same specimens 
in an exploratory manner, is not consistently evident at day 3 in the xenograft 
experiments but is evident at day 6 (1). 
• Xenograft regression was not extensive until beyond day 8 (1). 
• Day [ADDRESS_316010] time for follow up appointments and toxicity assessment in 
patients who are being treated in the outpatient sett ing. 
• Pi[INVESTIGATOR_259751] 5 or day 6 will harm patient accrual to the 
trial and sample acquisition: If samples were required on day 5, then patients could 
only start treatment on Monday, Thursday or Friday so that day [ADDRESS_316011] been 
evaluated:  
 
1.51 Characterization of antibody used in these studies : A critical antibody for this 
procedure, a rabbit monoclonal from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., 
recognizing phospho -Thr37,46-4EBP1, is supplied as a pre -titered reagent. In 
proprietary information provided to the Biomarker Review Committee, this 
antibody has been shown by [CONTACT_259817] -phosphorylated peptide.  Moreover, additional experiments 
have demonstrated that the antibody reacts with cells expressing 4EBP1 but not 
with 4EBP1 knockout cells (personal communication fr om Kimberly McCabe, 
Cell Signaling Technology, 11/19/14), further establishing specificity of the 
antibody.  The supplier’s practice of titering each lot of antibody before release 
helps assure that Western blots performed with the same dilution will yield  
similar results with different lots of antibody whenever the assay is run.  
 
1.52 Dynamic range of the assay :  To assess the dynamic range of the proposed assay, 
serial dilutions of the Nalm6 ALL cell line were subjected to immunoblotting.   
As indicated in Fig. 1, signal was detectable in undiluted sample and six 2 -fold 
dilutions (64 -fold range).   Moreover, this range encompassed the baseline 
phosphorylation of 4EBP1 observed in four ALL samples harvested from newly 
diagnosed ALL patients pr ior to therapy and processed as described above.

recognizes phospho -Thr37,46-4EBP1. Aliquots containing 50 µg of total cellular protein from four 
pretreatment human ALL samples were also contained on the blot (lanes 9 -12).  Two di fferent 
exposures of the same blot are shown. B, quantitation of integrated signals [area x (intensity –

in a lysate over 64 -fold range (lower panel of A, lanes  1-7), although the linear range is more 
limited (panel B).  
 
 
1.53 Reproducibility of the blotting for phospho -4EBP1 and quantification :  Lysates 
prepared from 15 different malignant human lymphoid cell lines were subjected to 
SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose on three separate days, and probed with 
replicate aliquots of anti -phospho -4EBP1 antibody as described above.  As 
indicated in Fig. 2, the blots were qualitatively similar. Quantification using NIH

Blots were probed with replicate aliquots of the same anti -phospho -4EBP1 antibody, visualized 
by [CONTACT_259819], and exposed to x -ray film exactly as proposed for the 
clinical samples. After blots were scanned, the integrated signal i n individual lanes [area x

harvested for blotting.  From ref. (1). B, after 
Jurkat cells were treated with diluent (lanes 1 
and 5); OSI -027 at 5, 10 or 20 µM (lanes 2 -4); 
MLN0128 (TAK -228) at 0.25, 0.5 or 1 µM 
(lanes 6 -8); or 10 nM rapamycin (lane 9), whole 
cell lysates were subjected immunoblotting.   
 
Image revealed a correlation between integrated signals for each cell line on pairs of 
blots as indicated on the figure.  
 
1.54 Assessment of the reproducibility of 4EBP1 dephosphorylation : To assess whether 
4EBP1 phosphorylation is reproducibly inhibited upon exposure to dual 
mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitors, multiple investigators in the Kaufmann laboratory 
assessed the impact of the dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor OSI -027 on 4EBP1 
phosphorylation in the ALL cell line Jurkat independently over a 5 -year period using 
diffe rent batches of phospho -Thr37,46-4EBP1 antibody from the indicated supplier. Two 
of these assays are shown in Figs. 3A (lanes 2 -6) and 3B (lanes 2 -4) below. These 
results show that 4EBP1 dephosphorylation is detectable by [CONTACT_259820], nitrocellulose, x -ray film, detection reagents and 
buffers as long as the Standard Operating Procedure is followed.  
 
1.55 Occurrence of the proposed 4EBP1 dephosphorylation in human neoplastic lymphoid 
cells after dual mTORC1/mTORC2  inhibitor treatment of xenografts in vivo :  To assess 
whether 4EBP1 phosphorylation would be inhibited by [CONTACT_259821] , mice bearing xenografts of the human mantle cell lymphoma 
cell line Jeko were treated with the max imum tolerated dose of OSI -027 for 3, 5 or 6 
days. Xenografts were snap frozen, then subjected to sample preparation and 
immunoblotting as described in Section 1.3  of this Appendix .  Results of this analysis 
demonstrated inhibition of 4EBP1 Thr37,46 phosph orylation in vivo  in all samples from 
treated mice compared to pretreatment samples (Fig. 4).

NCI Version Date:  October 2, [ADDRESS_316012] of dual mTOR inhibitors OSI -027 (OSI) and MLN0128 
(TAK -228) on 4EBP1 phosphorylation in clinical ALL samples exposed ex 
vivo. Clinical ALL specimens were subjected to Ficoll -Hypaque gradient 
centrifugation as described above.  Aliquots containing 5 x 106 cells were 
incubated for 48 h with 0.1% DMSO (lane 1) or dua l mTORC1/mTORC2 
inhibitor at the indicated final concentration in the presence of the broad -spectrum 
caspase inhibitor Q -VD-OPh to prevent caspase -medicated changes in protein 
expression. At the end of the incubation, cells were sedimented, washed in serum -
free medium, lysed, and subjected to immunoblotting for phospho -Thr37,46-
4EBP1 or total 4EBP1 as described above. Because degradation of 4EBP1 is 
phosphorylation dependent (explaining the increase in drug -treated cells), c -Raf 
and lamin B 1 were included a s loading controls.  
 
1.56 Occurrence of 4EBP1 dephosphorylation in clinical ALL samples upon treatment 
with dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitors ex vivo :  To assess whether the 
biochemical change previously shown to be critical for killing of ALL cells (2) 
could occur in clinical ALL, ALL specimens ha rvested from three newly diagnosed 
ALL patients were exposed to the dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitors OSI -027 and 
MLN0128 (TAK -228) ex vivo . Results of this analysis indicated that 4EBP1 
phosphorylation was reduced to undetectable levels in all samples upon dr ug 
exposure ex vivo  (Fig.  5A-C; see also Fig. 6B).  
 
1.57 Occurrence of 4EBP1 dephosphorylation in the range of MLN0128 (TAK -228) 
concentrations that are anticipated to be achievable in vivo : To assess the ability of 
MLN0128 (TAK -228) to inhibit 4EBP1 phosphorylation at submicromolar 
concentrations, Jurkat T cell ALL cells were treated for 24 h with various 
concentrations of MLN0128 (TAK -228) and blotted for 4EBP1. As indicated in 
Fig. 6A, 4EBP1 dephosphorylation was readily detectable  at MLN0128 (TAK -228) 
concentrations of 100 nM and above. To assure that 4EBP1 dephosphorylation 
would occur over the same MLN0128 (TAK -228) concentration range in clinical 
ALL specimens, a clinical specimen from a patient with newly diagnosed ALL 
(distinc t from those in Fig. 5) was treated with varying concentrations of MLN0128 
(TAK -228) for [ADDRESS_316013] concentration tested , 62.5  nM. These results compare favorably with the 

NCI Protocol #: 9775  
Local Protocol #: MC1482

peak MLN0128 (TAK -228) serum concentration of ~130 nM achieved in phase I 
solid tumor trials at the 6 mg dose level (9).

lane 1) or MLN0128 (TAK -228) at the indicated concentration, lysed, and subjected to 
immunoblotting for phospho -Thr37,46-4EBP1 or total 4EBP 1 as described above. B, replicate 
aliquots isolated from a pretreatment ALL specimen were treated for 48 h with 0.1% DMSO or 
the indicated concentration of MLN0128 (TAK -228) in the presence of 5 µM Q -VD-OPh, 
washed, and subjected to SDS -PAGE followed by b lotting for the indicated antigen.

2.1 Note on probing blots for multiple antigens  
 
Techniques previously reported from the Kaufmann lab (4, 10, 11) allow the sequential 
detection of multiple antigens on the same filter without interference. Once phospho -
4EBP1 has been successfully detected, we propose to use the same filters for detection of 
additional antigens, which are presented below in the order in which they will be 
examined. Because we routinely detect up to 14 antigens on a duplicate pair of filters 
from cell lines (including eight BCL2  family memb ers, three phospho -proteins and the 
three corresponding total protein controls), we do not anticipate difficulty in completing 
the proposed immunoblotting with the available samples.  
 
2.2 Role in trial:  Exploratory biomarker  
 
2.3 Hypothesis and rationale:  
 
Hypothesis: AKT  Ser473 phosphorylation will be inhibited by [CONTACT_161767]0128 (TAK -228) 
in situ . 
 
Rationale:  Previous studies have shown that mTOR dual inhibitors such as MLN0128 
(TAK -228) and OSI -027 diminish the mTORC2 -mediated phosphorylation of the pro -
survival kinase AKT  on Ser473 (e.g., Fig. 10 below), leading to upregulation of the 
pro-apoptotic protein BCL2L11 (Bim)  and induction of apoptosis (1, 2). In ALL cell 
lines the downregulation of the mTORC2 component Rictor reproduces these effects 
and downregulation of BCL2L11 (Bim)  produces resistance to mTOR dual inhibitors 

NCI Protocol #: 9775  
Local Protocol #: MC1482  
NCI Version Date:  October 2, 2017  91 
 
(2), demonstrating the critical role of signaling cascade in killing by [CONTACT_259822]. We now propose to assess whether AKT  Ser473 has been dephosphorylated 
in leukemic blasts by [CONTACT_259823]0128 (TAK -228) concentration 
in situ  as a proof of mechanism for this class of agent.  
 
2.4 Assay procedure:  
 
The assay procedure will be performed as described in Section 1.[ADDRESS_316014] 
Operating Procedure (pp. 16 -26) except that immunoblotting will use Cell Signaling 
Technology rabbit monoclonal antibody D9E, which recognizes AKT  when 
phosphorylated in Ser473 but not when unphosphorylated at this site (See p. 27 of this 
appendix).  
 
2.41 Characterization of antibody used in these studies : A critical antibody for this 
procedure, a rabbit monoclonal from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., recognizing 
phospho -Ser473-AKT , is supplied as a pre -titered reagent. The supplier’s practice of 
titering  each lot of antibody before release helps assure that Western blots 
performed with the same dilution will yield similar results with different lots of 
antibody whenever the assay is run.  The inability of the antibody to recognize 
unphosphorylated AKT is d ocumented by [CONTACT_259824] a ppended 
to the end of this Appendix.  
 
2.42  Reproducibility of the blotting for AKT Ser473 and quantification :  Lysates 
prepared from 15 different malignant human lymphoid cell lines were subjected 
to SDS -PAGE,  transferred to nitrocellulose on two separate days, and probed 
with replicate aliquots of anti -phospho -Ser473 antibody as described above.  As 
indicated in Fig. 7, the blots were qualitatively quite similar.  Quantification of 
integrated signal density [a rea x (intensity – background)] using NIH Image J 
revealed a correlation between integrated signal on blot 1 and blot 2 for the 
various cell lines on the two blots, with  = 0.95 (p = 0.0004).

NCI Version Date:  October 2, 2017  92 
 
SDS-PAGE followed by [CONTACT_259825]. Blots were probed 
with replicate aliquots of the same ant i-phospho -Ser473-AKT  antibody, visualized by [CONTACT_259826], and exposed to x -ray film exactly as proposed for the clinical 
samples.  
 
lymphoid cells after dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor treatment in xenografts 
in vivo :  To assess whether 4EBP1 phosphorylation would be inhibited by 
[CONTACT_259827] , mice bearing xenografts of the 
human mantle cell lymphoma c ell line Jeko were treated with the maximum 
tolerated dose of OSI -027 for 3, 5 or 6 days. Xenografts were snap frozen, then 
subjected to sample preparation and immunoblotting as described in Section 1.3  
of this Appendix .  Results of this analysis demonstra ted inhibition of AKT  Ser473 
phosphorylation in vivo  in all drug -exposed xenografts compared to pretreatment 
samples (Fig. 4).  
 
3. Expression of BCL2L11 (Bim) , BBC3 (Puma) , MCL1  and BCL2  proteins in pretreatment and 
day 8 bone marrow samples by [CONTACT_259828] 
 
3.1 Roles in study: exploratory biomarkers  
 
3.2 Hypothesis and rationale:  
 
Hypothesis: Levels of BCL2L11 (Bim)  and BBC3 (Puma)  in ALL will increase during 
MLN0128 (TAK -228) treatment, whereas levels of MCL1  and possibly BCL2  will 
decrease.  
 
Rationale:  Previous studies have shown that mTOR dual inhibitors such as MLN0128 
(TAK -228) and OSI -027 cause upregulation of the pro -apoptotic BCL2  family members 
BBC3 (Puma)  and BCL2L11 (Bim)  in malignant lymphoid cells (1, 2). In ALL cell lines, 
down regulation  of BBC3 (Puma)  or BCL2L11 (Bim)  produces resistance to mTOR dual 
inhibitors (1, 2), demonstrating the  critical role of these proteins in killing by [CONTACT_259822]. Conversely, the anti -apoptotic BCL2  family member MCL1  has been shown 
to decrease after treatment with mTOR dual inhibitors in certain malignant human 
lymphoid cell lines (1). Overexpression of eponymous BCL2  has also been shown to 
convey resistance to mTOR dual inhibitors (1). Accordingly, we propose to assess 
whether BCL2L11 (Bim)  and BBC3 (Puma)  have been upregulated or MCL1  down 
regulated  in leukemic blasts by [CONTACT_259829]0128 (TAK -228) 
concentration in situ  as a further proof of mechanism for this class of agent.  
 
3.3 Assay procedure and sources of critical reagents:  
 
The assay procedure will be performed as described in Section 1.[ADDRESS_316015], the 
following antibodies will be used (data sheets included at the end of  this Appendix):  
 
BCL2L11 (Bim) :  C34C5 rabbit monoclonal antibody, Cell Signaling Technology  
NCI Protocol #: 9775  
Local Protocol #: MC1482  
NCI Version Date:  October 2, 2017  93 
 
BBC3 (Puma) : G-3 murine monoclonal antibody (sc -374223), Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology  
BCL2 :  Clone 124 mouse anti -human BCL2  antibody (Dako)  
MCL1 :  D35A5 rabbit monoclonal antibody, Cell Signaling Technology  
 
Second, appropriate secondary antibody will be utilized. Third, as standard s for these 
studies, we currently plan to purify recombinant human BCL2  (12-14), MCL1  (12, 13), 
BCL2L11 (Bim)  (15) and BBC3 (Puma)  (16) and apply known amounts in a serial 
dilution to serve as a standard curve.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_316016] been evaluated:  
 
3.41 Characterization of antibodies used in these studies : Critical antibodies for these 
procedures are the antibodies listed above.  For the antibodies from Cell 
Signaling Technology, Inc., the supplier’s practice of titering each lot of 
antibody before release helps assure that Western blots perfo rmed with the same 
dilution will yield similar results with different lots of antibody whenever the 
assay is run. The absence of signal in lysates from gene -deleted cells ( BBC3 ) or 
diminished signal in cells with siRNA/shRNA -mediated knockdown 
(BCL2L11 , BCL2 and MCL1 ) has been documented in the Kaufmann laboratory 
for each of these antibodies (data not shown).  
 
3.42 Dynamic range of the assay :  To assess the dynamic range of the proposed assay, 
serial dilutions of the Nalm6 ALL cell line were subjected to i mmunoblotting 
with antibodies to BCL2  and BCL2L11 (Bim) . As indicated in Fig. 8, signals 
were detectable in undiluted sample and six 2 -fold dilutions 64 -fold range) for 
BCL2  and in the undiluted sample and four 2 -fold dilutions (16 -fold range) for 
BCL2L11 (Bim) . MCL1  likewise had a 16 - to 32 -fold dynamic range. BBC3 
(Puma)  could not be effectively assayed in these cells prior to treatment because 
its baseline levels are too low. Note, however, that we plan to utilize

(lanes 2 -7) were subjected to SDS -PAGE 
and probed with antibodies that recognize 
BCL2  (top) or Bim (bottom). The locations 
of th e extra -long, long and short splice 
variants of Bim (17) are indicated.

x-ray film exactly as proposed for the clinical samples.  
 
serial dilutions of purified BBC3 (Puma)  protein rather than a healthy cell line

3.43 Reproducibility of the blotting for BCL2  and BCL2L11 (Bim) :  Lysates from 15 
malignant human lymphoid cell lines were subjected to SDS -PAGE, transferred 
to nitrocellulose on multiple separate days, and probed with replicate aliquots of 
anti-BCL2  and anti -BCL2L11 (Bim)  antibody as described above.  As indicated 
in Fig. 9, the blots were qualitatively similar.  Quantification of integrated 
signals [area x (intensity – background)] using NIH Image revealed a strong 
correlation between the BCL2  signals obtained for each cell line on blot 1 vs. 
blot 2, blot 2 vs. blot 3 and blot 1 vs. blot 3 in A [  =  0.90 - 0.95 (p = 0.0004 – 
0.008)] or BCL2L11 EL (Bim EL) on blot 1 vs. blot 2 in B [  = 0.95 (p = 0.0004) 
in B].  
 
3.44 Assessment of BCL2L11 (Bim)  and BBC3 (Puma)  induction : To assess whether 
BCL2L11 (Bim)  and BBC3 (Puma)  are reproducibly upregulated upon exposure 
to dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitors, multiple investigators in the Kaufmann 
laboratory assessed the impact of the dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor OSI -
027 on levels of these proteins in the ALL cell line Jurkat independently over a 
5-year period using different batches of BCL2L11 (Bim)  and BBC3 (Puma)  
antibodies from the indicated suppli er. Two of these assays are shown in Figs. 
10A (lanes 2 -6) and 10B (lanes 2 -4) on the next page. These results show that 
upregulation of BCL2L11 (Bim)  and BBC3 (Puma)  is detectable by [CONTACT_259831], nitrocellulose , x-ray film, detection 
reagents and buffers as long as the procedure described in Section 1.3  of this 
Appendix  is followed.

cells were treated for 48 h with diluent (lanes 1); OSI -127 at 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10 or 20 µM (lanes 
2-6); or 10 nM rapamycin (lane 7) in the presence of the caspase inhibitor Q -VD-OPh (5 
µM—ref. 18 ) to inhibit apoptosis, whole cell lysates were subjected to SDS -PAGE followed 
by [CONTACT_259832]. PARP1 served as a 
loading control.  B, C,  in two separate experiments designed to assess various aspects of OSI -
027-induced signaling (2), control Jurkat cells were treated with diluent or 10 µM OSI -027 
for 48 h and harvested for immunoblotting for the indicated antigens.  
 
 
4. Reverse phase protein array for protein phosphorylations and expression (exploratory 
biomarkers)  
 
4.1 Hypothesis and rationale:  
 
Hypothesis: Phosphorylation of mTOR substrates and complementary pathway 
components will change during the course of mTOR dual inhibitor treatment.  
 
Rationale:  Prior publications have identified differences in the pattern of pro tein 
phosphorylation between cell lines that are sensitive to kinase inhibitors and similar cell 
lines that are resistant (e.g., 20, 21). Preliminary studies in the Kaufmann laboratory have 
likewise demonstrated differences in protein phosphorylation at key nodes between 
parental Nalm6 ALL cells and Nalm6 cells selected for the ability to grow continuously 
in mTOR dual inhibitor (C. Correia, K. L. B. Knorr, S. Yun, A. E. Wahner Hendrickson, 
B. Madden, D. McCormick , S. Dasari, and S. H. Kaufmann, unpublished observations). 
Thus, we hypothesize that pretreatment patterns of phosphorylation might differ between 
ALLs that respond to MLN0128 (TAK -228) and those that do not.  
 
4.2 Assay validity and appropriateness for study:  
 
Reverse phase protein arrays (RPPAs) will be utilized to assess levels of phosphorylation 
of 60 key proteins, including 4EBP1, ribosomal protein S6, and AKT , as well as 
expression levels of roughly 200 proteins, including BCL2 , BCL2L1 ( Bcl-xL),

blasts. This analysis of key signaling pathways will be utilized to supplement the results 
of the more targeted immunoblotting assays described above.  
 
4.3 Performance site:   
 
Whole cell lysates will be prepared in the Kaufmann laboratory of the Mayo Clinic Cancer 
Center. Based on prelim inary results, the same lysates prepared for immunoblotting are 
suitable for RPPAs.  The RPPAs will be probed and initial bioinformatic analysis 
performed in the RPPA Core Facility of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, which is a fee -
for-service facility. Se condary bioinformatic analysis will be performed at Mayo.  
 
4.4 Performance characteristics of the assay:  
 
The reproducibility and reliability of this method, as well as comparison to the gold 
standard of Western blotting, has been published by [CONTACT_259833] M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (22). 
 
To further assess the reproducibility of the assay in our hands, samples of control Jurkat 
cells harvested  on sequential days were submitted to the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center 
RPPA Core Facility. Quantitative results across 260 antigens were scored in each sample.  
Information returned from the Core Facility (Fig. 11) indicated a quality score of >0.8 for 
each antibody.  Variation between the replicates averaged 9.9%; and a correlation 
coefficient of 0.67 was observed between samples on day 1 and day 2.  
 
 
5. Transcriptional profiling (exploratory biomarker)  
 
5.1 Role in trial:  Exploratory biomarker  
 
5.2 Hypot hesis and rationale:  
 
Hypothesis: Treatment with MLN0128 (TAK -228) will activate two transcriptional 

NCI Protocol #: 9775

pathways related to apoptosis.  
Rationale:  Previous studies have shown that the mTOR dual inhibitor OSI -[ADDRESS_316017] transcriptional pathways in ALL cell lines during the course of upregulating 
BCL2L11 (Bim)  and BBC3 (Puma)  to induce apoptosis (2). If sufficient material is 
available to allow isolation of RNA (after samples for immunoblotting and RPPAs have 
been harvested), samples will be subjected to RNA sequencing (R NAseq) to determine 
whether MLN0128 (TAK -228) concentrations achievable in vivo  activate these same 
transcriptional pathways as a proof of mechanism study.  
 
5.3 Assay methodology:  
 
RNAseq will be performed on pretreatment and day 8 bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026] t o assess 
whether transcriptional changes observed in clinical ALL leading to BCL2L11 (Bim)  and 
BBC3 (Puma)  upregulation are also observed in clinical ALL treated in vivo . In brief, after 
Ficoll purification, total RNA will be extracted from marrow mononuclear  cells using  
Qiagen RNA extraction kit. After RNA sample quality is assessed in the Gene Expression 
Core of the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center  by [CONTACT_259834] (RIN), 
an Illumina TruSeq mRNA kit will be used to generate cDNA for ne xt generation 
sequencing. RNAs will be poly -A selected and fragmented, then subjected to reverse 
transcription with random primers and second -strand synthesis to generate double -
stranded cDNA. Ends will be  repaired and poly(adenyl)ated, followed by [CONTACT_259835]. The cDNAs will  then denatured and PCR -enriched to generate the final 
genomic library, which will be analyzed  on an Illumina HiSeq 2000. Data will analyzed 
according to a Mayo Clinic developed protocol for analyzing RNA -Sequencing data,  
(http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471 -2105 -15-224.pdf ). Each mRNA count 
number will be normalized to counts per million.  
 
5.4 Assessment of assay performance:  
 
To assess assay performance, on two successive days Jurkat T cell ALL cells were treated 
with diluent vs. [ADDRESS_316018] spectrum caspase 
inhibitor Q -VD-OPh (to prevent apoptosis -associated RNA degradation), RNA was 
extracted and subjected to the RNA sequencing procedure described in the preceding 
paragraph. As indicated in Fig. 12, results obtained with the duplicate samples under each 
condition were highly reproducible, with R values of 0.99 in diluent -treated cells an d 
0.97 in drug -treated cells, respectively.

Study 
Design  Parallel group  randomized controlled trial evaluating inpatient encounters  
Study 
Objectives  The Multiple Visit Patient (MVP) program was rolled out to the first cohort of [ADDRESS_340519] descriptive results show that the 2019 MVP cohort had 50% lower inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] a dmissions in 2019 than in 2018. While this is a promising outcome, 
without a randomized controlled trial (RCT) causal inferences cannot be made about 
the effect of the MVP program. Regression to the mean is a competing potential 
reason for observing the ra te decrease, with high utilizers having lower hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278893]. Thus, the Population Health 
leadership seeks to conduct a definitive trial to rigorously evaluate the MVP 
program effectiveness.    
 
Primary Objec tive: To evaluate the effectiveness of enrollment  in the MVP care 
management program compared to usual care on reducing 12- month total inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278894].  
 
The Secondary Objective s are to  
(1) evaluate the effect(s) of participation in the MVP program on:  
• 6-month inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85284]  
• 6-month and 12- month Combined IP and OBS hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278895]  
• 6-month and 12- month Combined IP and OBS hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278896]  
• 6-month and 12- month IP hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278897] 
(using CMS criteria)  
• 6-month and 12- month Readmissions   
• 6-month and 12- month ED visits  
• 6-month and 12- month Mortality  
• 6-month and 12- month Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278898] (length of stay, IP)  
• 6-month and 12- month Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7960]   
(2)  assess variability in MVP program treatment effects associated with predef ined 
patient and program factors, including:  
 insurance status  
 age, gender, race and ethnicity  
 English as second language  
 type of program (e.g., ACM, etc.)  
 community characteristics  
  clinical characteristics (e.g., CCI)

Study 
Procedures  The list of patients with four or more inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278900] 2019 will be pulled 
from the Atrium Health electronic data warehouse (EDW) by [CONTACT_278939], and eligibility for the MVP program of patients on this list will be 
determined by [CONTACT_278940]’s Care Management team based on predefined 
eligibility  criteria. IAS CORE will randomize eligible participants into one of two 
groups:  1) MVP program; or 2) usual care.  
 
Population Health’s Multiple Visit Patient (MVP) care management program aims to 
manage health and lower hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278901] s with a history of high 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278902]. Patients eligible for the program have four 
or more inpatient visits over the 12- month period prior to enrollment. Once enrolled, 
each MVP program participant receives on -going support from an assigned MVP 
care manager and larger care management team, including the following core 
program components:  
(1) customized care plan developed for each patient at the time of enrollment  
(2) routine, virtual health monitoring and collaborative care management  
team -based review  
(3) personalized navigation and coordination across multidisciplinary Atrium 
Health services, as needed  
(4) education, health coaching, and support via telephonic and in- person 
interactions, as needed  
 
The control group will receive usual care.

2. BACKGROUND 
A large portion of US health care costs is attributed to a small group of high- need, high- cost (HNHC) 
patients . The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality recently examined  nationwide Medical 
Expenditure Panel Survey data from 2014 and  reported that 1% of US civilian population was account able 
for more than 20%  of health care spending, and 5% of the population for 50% (Dzau, et al. 2017, Mitchell, 
2016). Similar patterns are seen at the health  system level; Johnson et al. (2015) found that 3% of patients in 
an integrated safety -net health system accounted for 30% of charges.  
 
To address HNHC p atients’ costs and high medical care utilization , health systems have been implementing 
a variety of care management programs  as part of population health initiatives . The rise of these programs 
has been prevalent especially for Accountable Care Organizati ons (ACOs) and other value -based payment 
contracts  (Peck et al., 2018). In general, these programs are characterized by [CONTACT_278941] s’ medical care and address social determinants of health thro ugh 
referrals to community resources. The programs vary widely in theoretical foundations  for interventions and 
individual  features, which are a mix of medical and social services, and can have either epi[INVESTIGATOR_278908] (Anderson, et al., 2015, Bodenheimer, 2013). There is not a consensus  definition of the 
HNHC patient, thus selection criteria  for these programs vary. One approach is based on clinical and 
functional  characteristics of the patient, and the other approach identifies eligible patie nts as “super -
utilizers” who accumulated a high number of ED  visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614] , with some programs us ing 
a combination of the two approaches  (AHRQ, 20 19, Johnson et al., 2015, Mann, et al., 2013).  
 
Evaluations of care management programs for HNHC patients have been conducted using pre -post analysis 
and randomized controlled trials, both have show n mixed results ( Baker, et al., 2018, Naylor et al, 2011) . 
Recently, Powers, et al . (2020) conducted a randomized trial to evaluate CareMore Health’s complex care 
management program on utilization of HNHC Medicaid patients  between  March [ADDRESS_340526]  healthcare use characteristics and randomi zed to 
receive the chronic care management program  or usual care. Those randomized into the program were 
contact[CONTACT_3012], and those who chose to enroll completed a comprehensive assessment and received a 
tailored care plan. The complex chronic program t eam consisted of a community health work, social worker 
and a primary care physician ( PCP). The authors found that  patients randomized to receive complex care 
management had  fewer total inpatient bed days (59% decrease) and fewer inpatient admissions (44% 
decrease) over a 12 -month period. Healthcare costs were also lower in the group who received care 
management , mostly driven by [CONTACT_278942]. On the other hand, in the recent 
randomized controlled trial conducted to evaluate the Cam den Coalition of Healthcare Providers  hotspotting

12 program , Finkelstein, et al. (2020) found no e ffect of a promising care management program on HNHC 
patients’ readmission rates [ADDRESS_340527] utilization characteristics.  In the evaluation of Camden’s program, patients were enrolled on a rolling 
base while in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , and upon return home they received help from a multidisciplinary team of 
clinicians, social and community workers.  
 
Several published studies used the pre -post approach (Lynch, et al., 2016). Pre -post analysis can , however, 
misleadingly suggest  huge benefits of the program, while the decrease in utilization i s simply an observation 
of regression to the mean; in other words, utilization would drop with or without the program. Johnson, et 
al. (2015) confirms this phenomenon. The authors found that  at the individual level, person’s high utilizer 
status changed over time , with less than 50% of super -utilizers remain ing in the high utilization category 
seven months after being identified as high utilizers , and only 28% a year later. Finkelstein, et al. (2020) 
addressed the importance of conducting a randomized trial evaluation instead of a pre -post analysis. While a 
pre-post analysis  using the same data as the RCT showed a 38 % decrease in readmissions  for the 
intervention group, the RCT results implie d that this decrease could not be attributed to the Camden 
hotspotting program. 
 
Another approach applied in care management program evaluations is a pre -post design with a comparable 
control group created in absence of an RCT ( Thompson, et al., 2018, Seva k, et al., 2018) . Thompson, et al. 
(2018) evaluated a community navigator program where eligibility was determined based on having 11+ 
encounters (ED, IP and OBS) during a 12- month period and primary residence at a specific zip code. The  
cohort received he lp from community navigators for one year. The authors created a control group that met 
the 11+ encounters criteria for super -utilizers  but had residence  in different zip codes. The authors found 
that that patients participating in the program had  a 13% la rger reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278909] 8% 
reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278910].  
 
The components of the M VP program at AH were adopted from the approach promoted by A. Boutwell , 
MD, Collaborative Healthcare Strategies (2018). Multi-visit utilization in the past is considered a 
manifestation of co -occurring medical,  behavioral, and social needs , likely unmet or not adequately 
addressed. C are managers are trained to identify underlying causes for high utilization through listening and 
asking patient questions beyond clinical diagnoses and looking for patterns in care seeking (e.g., problems 
with logistics, sense of urgency, uncertainty, or convenience ). The  MVP program aims to engage the 
patient, develop trusting relationships, offer recommendations tailored to patient  while  avoiding “over -
medicalization,” and over time help the patient achieve stability. An example of the  program 
implementation is the MAX series for Medicaid patients with high past utilization in [LOCATION_001] S tate. Both 
inpatien t and ED utilization for participants in the MAX series decreased after the program introduction; the 
evaluat ion method, however, was pre -post analysis ([LOCATION_001] State Department of Health, 2017).  
 
Evidence of effectiveness of care management programs var ies because of differences in program features, 
outcome s studied, the underlying studied population eligibility and characteristics (e.g., all patients, 
Medicaid, patients with heart failures), and statistical methods  employed for evaluation  (from pre -post to 
randomized trials ). Randomized trials such as this are needed to make causal inferences on a care 
management program s effectiveness , ability to identify subgroups of patients who benefit most from the 
programs, and to identify impactful program feature s.

13 3. RATIONALE  
The A H MVP program was established by [CONTACT_278940]’s Care Management group to address the 
complex needs of patients with the highest volume of inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278911]. Care management 
initiated its work with the first cohort of [ADDRESS_340528] descriptive results show ed that the 2019 MVP cohort’s inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278912] 2019 than in 2018. While this is a promising outcome, without a randomized controlled 
trial (RCT) causal inferences cannot be made about the effect of the MVP program. Regression to the mean 
is a competing potential reason for observing the rate decrease, with high uti lizers having lower hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278893]. Thus, the Population Health leadership seeks to conduct 
a definitive trial to rigorously evaluate the MVP program effectiveness.    
 
The randomized trial will allow us to make causal inferences regarding the effect of the MVP program on 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278913]. It will also address 
identification of patients who most benefit from the program by [CONTACT_278943], economic 
indicators of communities where they live, and clinical characteristics . The insights gained from the RCT 
will (1 ) inform  strategic decisions on how AH effectively deploys limited care management resources to its 
patients; ( 2) pro vide generalizable knowledge using a  rigorous RCT framework to improve care 
management  programs beyond AH; and (3) generate robust real -world data as  input to develop a novel 
machine learning model to advance  high risk patient  segmentation.  
 
This research project  is a parallel group, randomized trial of a  care management program  which seeks to 
evaluate inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278914] a 12- month period. Th e 
evaluation of this  intervention ha s been designed to integrate into  routine care and minimize frontline staff 
burden by [CONTACT_278944] a pragmatic evaluation in a real -world setting.

Screening and care manager assignment. A list of patients with four or more inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278924] 2019 will be pulled from the Atrium Health electronic data warehouse (EDW). The care 
management  team will review eligibility for the MVP program. The list of eligible participants will 
be randomized using parall el block randomization approach into the 2020 MVP program cohort 
(intervention) and the control group.  
 
Eligibility for the program is based on past utilization, with patients with  [ADDRESS_340529] to 
determine eligibility and assign s the patient to the appropriate care m anagement group. The 
number of patients accepted to the MVP program is constrained by [CONTACT_278945]’s 
capacity . Existing M VP enrollees  continue to receive care from their currently assigned team . 
Patients are assigned to a  distinct care management group based o n insurance/care needs : 
i. Ambulatory Care Management (AC M)  
• Commercial insurance  
Version Number: 1.2  
Version Date: 01 -13-2021 
  
 
17 • Medicare only  
• Medicare with Medicaid as second  
• Uninsured outside of Mecklenburg and Union counties  
• Non CA II Medicaid  
ii. Community Care Partners (CCP)   
• Medicaid CA II  
a. Priority list (determined by [CONTACT_278946])  
b. Provider preferred  
• Community Care of NC (CCNC)  
a. Medicaid CA II that are not being managed by [CONTACT_278947] (ie Mecklenburg, 
Union, Anson counties)  
iii. Community Care Bridge (CCB)   
• Uninsured in Mecklenburg and Union counties  
iv. Advanced Illness Management (AIM)  
• Patients with a limited prognosis but for whom hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278925]. 
This program is part of Continuing Care. 
 
Program Start Point. Patients in the intervention group are enrolled in the MVP program at one  
time point  determined by [CONTACT_278948]. The start point is marked by [CONTACT_1629] “Active ” 
indicator  in the Patient Pi[INVESTIGATOR_277657]. From that point , the assigned care manager starts receiving 
“pi[INVESTIGATOR_14839],” which are real time updates alerting the care manager about the MVP patient ’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278926]  (IP, OBS, ED) . The MVP care manager checks on the patient , communicates with 
providers  and helps coordinate care and the transition  to home.  
 
Initial Assessment and Customized Plan.  Shortly after the program start date , each MVP care 
manager calls patient s assigned to her/him  to conduct a full assessment . The case manager 
continues to try to reach the patient , and  there is no limit for the number of attempted phone ca lls 
over a period of time . The assessment contains  review  of med ications , upcoming appointments, 
social determinants  of health  (living arrangements, financial), and a PHQ9  survey. The care 
manager assesses a patient’s  motivation to change, provide s education, solicits questions about  
health, and how the  patient want s to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  The care manager uses the assessment to 
create a customized plan for each patient.  
MVP p rogram features : Care managers are alerted via P atient Pi[INVESTIGATOR_14839] w hen a patient is admitted 
to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278927] .  
• If a patient is admitted to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the care manager consults the inpatient case 
manager and calls the patient if needed  
• During monthly huddles, care management reviews charts of patient s who had an 
acute care encounter  during the past 30 days.  
 In general, if a  patient had 0 hospi [INVESTIGATOR_278928], care managers do 
not make any calls .  
 There are n o home visits.   
Version Number: 1.2  
Version Date: 01 -13-2021 
  
 
18  Face -to-face visits may take place if the patient is admitted to a facility at a close 
proximity to the care manager.  
The relationship between a patient and a care manager varies.  Care manager s strive to identify MVP 
drivers and resources needed (clinical, financial, social), coordinate  medical care and draw on resources 
from community program s. Community resource referrals  depend on the county and availability (e .g., 
Mecklenburg county has more resources for transportation, food pantry, access to specialists than rural  
counties ). The  goal is to e ngage the patient, develop trusting relationships, offer recommendations 
tailored to patient, help the patient avoiding unnecessary medical utilization, and over time help the 
patient achieve stability.  
 
 
5.3. Usual Care  
Patient’s post -discharge usual care depends  on the inpatient care management assessment at last hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47140] . Patient s can be discharged to home and receive no further care, or home with home health, or 
to a skilled nursing facility (SNF)  or another type of C ontinuing C are facility . Patient s can be referred to 
AIM, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125] , and C ommunity C are P artners  by [CONTACT_278949] . Patient  can be referred to 
Ambulatory C are M anagemen t for care management also via telehealth , by a PCP or the Transitions 
Clinic.  
 
 
5.4. Patient Graduation from the MVP program  
Participation in the MVP program ends if the care manager stops monitoring the patient’s health 
and stops reaching out to the patient. Reasons include : 
a) Patient died  
b) Patient relocated  
c) Patient was incarcerated  
 
The below reasons do not result in end ing the MVP participation . Instead, the  MVP care manager 
continues to quietly monitor the patient’s health and coordinate services if needed  but does not 
reach out directly to the patient . 
a) Patient no longer wishes to participate  
b) Patient enrolled in palliative/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278929]  
d) Patient moved to nursing home or assisted living while enrolled in the MVP program  
 
 
5.5. Continuation of the Intervention  
Patients enrolled in the  MVP  program  may continue participating after the study period has ended.

Data will be retrieved by [CONTACT_278950].  Data will be retrieved retrospective

6.1. Power A nalysis  
The outcome of interest is the number of IP hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278917] a 6- month period . The research 
(alternative) hypothesis is that the enrollment in the MVP program will lead to a larger  decrease in IP 
encounters  compared to usual care; the null hypothesis is  no change in the percentage decrease across 
both arms  of the study.  
 
In order to determine the outcome variable value for the power analysis  we used historical data of IP 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278931] [ADDRESS_340530] to be similar to 
MVP enrollees  in this study. To determine the sample size w e considered  the Care Management’s 
requested  size of 600 enrollees in the MVP program cohort . We estimated that t he MVP program will 
serve 146 existing enrollees, who are not eligible for the study, and 454 new enrollees, who are eligible 
for the study. W e used the following inputs  for the power analysis: the average number of IP encounters  
was 6.5 in 2018, and it decreased 54% in 2019. We assumed that there are equal variances in both the 
treatment group and the control group and performed the  calculations with a standard deviation of 0.45. 
We assumed there ar e 910 patients in the study population, with 454 patients randomized in the 
treatment group ( MVP program ) and 454 patient s randomized in the control group ( usual care) . We 
assumed that the attrition rate due to death and relocation i s 35% , resulting in 295 patients per group.  
 
The sample size of 295 (in each group ) achieves 8 0% power to reject the null hypothesis of equal 
percentage decreases in both groups when the mean difference is 10.4% points with a standard deviation 
of 0.45. In other words, with our sample size we would have the statistical power to detect a 10.4% point  
Version Number: 1.2  
Version Date: 01 -13-2021 
  
 
20 reduction in IP hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278932] t he MVP group compared to the control group. Th e 10.4% point 
difference (between the 54% drop for the MVP gro up compared to  43.6%  drop for the control gr oup) 
translates into a 21.3% relative reduction in the number of IP hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278933] . The level of significance is 0.05; a two -sided two sample t test was used (assuming the 
outcome follows a normal distribution).  The sample size calculation was performed using the PASS 
software (2020).  
 
6.2. Statistical analysis  
Analys es will include all patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All analys es will follow 
the intention -to-treat (“ITT”) principle, such that patients will be analyzed based on the assignment of 
their primary care site to the  MVP  program or usual care.   
 
Descriptive statistics will be calculated to screen all variables for accuracy and to examine distributions. 
Balance in baseline characteristics between the groups will be assessed.  
 
The primary and secondary outcomes will be estimated as function s of T reatment  (intervention / MVP 
program identifier) covariates X : 
 
Yi = β 0 + β 1 (Treatment) + β 2 Xi +εi 
where  
• β1  is the parameter of interest and measures the Intent to Treat: the causal effect of being 
randomized into the treatment group (in this study we expect the intent to treat and treatment 
to be almost the identical).   
• X are covariates, uncorrelated with Treatment, but they can aid in the precision of the 
estimate; β 2 are the corresponding parameter estimates . The covariates will include patient’s 
demographic and clinical characteristic, past utilization, insurance type, type of program 
management, community characteristics , care management groups, and discharge location.  
Generalized linear models will be used. Results will be presented as marginal effects (continuous and 
count outcomes) and odds ratios (binary outcomes).  Wal d test will be used to assess the statistical 
significance of the independent variable. The level of significance is set to 0.05. Appropriate model 
diagnostics will be performed on each model to assess fit. Data will be analyzed using SAS Enterprise 
Guide 7.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]) and the R programming environment. 
  
6.3. Data Collection Dates  
All participants in the MVP cohort will be enrolled at the same time and flagged as “ active” status in 
the PatientPi[INVESTIGATOR_278934]. Data accrual will take place during 365 days from the date of patient 
enrollment .

8. SAFETY RISK S AND REPORTING  
The data collection  and intervention for  this project presents no more than minimal risk to patients.  The 
MVP program is currently offered at  Atrium Health , the first [ADDRESS_340531] presents no more than minimal risk to patients.  There is 
always the risk of disclosure of a patient’s private health information  (PHI) or medical information. 
However, the processes identified in this protocol to enable the execution of this project, do not increase 
inherent risk of disclosure. Atrium Health  utilizes several  hard and soft safety controls in the protection of 
patient information and medical records. Security controls include, but are not limited to, multiple system 
firewalls, access restrictions to patient records and information, locked offices and bui ldings housing 
research and  patient data, and multiple layers of username [CONTACT_278955].  Statistical tools and programs that are developed are stored on secure restricted access file shares.  
Programs have versioning controls turned on and access to the file shares are restricted.  Access is granted 
through a request process that requires multiple  authorizations and is controlled centrally by [CONTACT_278952] .  
The CORE  project team will ensure that appropriate handling of patient PHI follows standard Atrium 
Health  procedure. Confidentiality will be maintained accord ing to ICH E6; 4.8.10, part 0: “Records 
identifying the subject will be kept confidential and, to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_29695]/or 
regulations, will not be made publicly available. If the results of the study trial are published, the pati ent’s 
Version Number: 1.2  
Version Date: 01 -13-2021 
  
 
22 identity will remain confidential.’ In the event of PHI disclosure, the appropriate internal departments will 
be informed and processed per legislation and privacy regulations. 
 
8.1. Data Quality Assurance  
 
This study will be organized, performed, and reported in compliance with the study protocol, 
standard operating procedures (SOPs) of the CORE  and Atrium Health , and other applicable 
regulations and guidelines (e.g. GCP).  
 
8.2. Safety Reporting to the IRB  
 
All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of a  reportable 
safety event per the IRB guidelines, will be reported to the IRB within  [ADDRESS_340532] operating procedures set forth by [CONTACT_278953] . The Principal Investigator s, statistician, and other team members will meet as 
needed to review  enrollment and retention, study progress , and validity/integrity of the data. 
Documentation of these meetings will be kept with  study records.  
9. RESEARCH COMPLETION

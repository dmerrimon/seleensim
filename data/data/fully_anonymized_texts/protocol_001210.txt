 PROTOCOL SUMMARY 
Protocol  
Number  ON-1003  
Title of Trial  A Phase 2, single -dose, open -label study to evaluate diagnostic performance and 
safety of pegsitacianine , an intraoperative fluorescence imaging agent for the 
detection of peritoneal metastases, in patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery  
Phase of Clinic al 
Trial  Phase 2  
Indications  Pegsitacianine  is indicated as an imaging agent for intraoperative detection of 
peritoneal metastases originating from intra -abdominal tumors such as ovarian, 
colorectal, and gastric cancers. Pegsitacianine is administered int ravenously as a 
single dose prior to surgery.  
Study Centers  up to 10  centers   
Trial Objectives  Primary Objective:  
The primary ob ective of this study is to determine if administration of 
pegsitacianine  m g / k g )  r e s u l t s  i n  t h e  d e t e c t i o n  o f  m e t a s t a t i c  d i s e a s e  l e f t  b e h i n d  
following standard of care surgical resection of peritoneal metastases . 
 
Secondary Objectives:  
Key secondary objectives are to demonstrate an acceptable safety profile, reliable 
sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive values, and positive predictive values of 
the imaging agent at the level of the individual specimens.  
Background  Pegsitacianine  is an intraoperative nanoparticle -based fluorescence imaging agent 
that was evaluated in the first -in-human Phase 1 study (ON -1001) completed in the 
Netherlands in patients with solid cancers undergoing  surgical excision of their 
tumors. In addition, it was also evaluated in the completed  Phase 2 study (ON -1002) 
in solid tumors. Pegsitacianine  fluorescence is quenched when exposed to normal 
physiological pH but becomes activated following micellar disassembly in the low -
pH tumor microenvironment. Pegsitacian ine was demonstrated to be well tolerated 
and showed no dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) .  
Trial Design  This Phase 2 study will be a two Group  interventional, open -label, single arm trial 
where each patient is his/her own “intra atient” control. All atients will receive a 
single  mg/kg dose of pegsitacianine  
prior to standard of care surgery. It is recommended by [CONTACT_159026] -related reaction.  
 
Patients enrolled in Group  [ADDRESS_184605] a  biopsy confirmed diagnos is of 
non-mucinous  (i.e., ≤50% mucin)  peritoneal carcinomatosis with a  suspected 
Peritoneal Carcinomatosis Index (PCI) greater than  or equal to  10. Group 2 of the 
study will include pa tients with a  suspected PCI greater than  or equal  to 10 and a 
biopsy confirmed diagnosis of mucinous  (i.e., >50% mucin)  peritoneal 
carcinomatosis. A total of approximately [ADDRESS_184606] to Group 1 with the opportunity to open 
Group 2 for enrollment following the demonstration of satisfactory pegsitacianine 
sensitivity and specificity values of 70% or greater  in Group 1.  
 
In both Groups  1 and 2, the surgeon will perform their SOC resection of visible 
metastases and image up to a total of 15 resected  tumor (n = 10) and normal (n=5)

1.1 Overview 
Peritoneal carcinomatosis  (PC) results  from the me tastasis of  a primary cancer of the  peritoneum 
(e.g., appendiceal, ovarian, uterine, co lorectal, an d gastric cancers)  that then d isseminates 
throughout the abdominal cavity .[ADDRESS_184611] option 
for patients.2 More recently, cytoreductive surgery (CS) has emerged as a means to prolong and 
improve p atient lives with a median increase in survival of up to ~5 years.3 It has been r eported 
that for every 10% increase in cytoreduction there is a 5.5% increase in median survival time.4,5 
In addition to surgical tumor debulking within the peritoneal space, it has also been shown that coupling surgical intervention with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) can have an even gr eater impact  on patient outcomes.
6  
The extent of survival benefit gained via CS is directly linked to the completeness of cytoreduction, or how much macroscopic disease (>2.5 mm deposits) has been removed.
7,8 
During CS, surgeons examine the peritoneal cavity for evidence of disease with the intent of removing all visible tumor deposits, and thus providing a complete cytoreduction. Any tumor deposits left behind, smaller than 2.5 mm, are believed to be treated efficiently with the follow-on H IPEC tr eatment.
9 These surgical procedures are lengthy in duration, with total CS and 
HIPEC  treatment  times taking upwards of 14 hours to complete. Additional intraoperative tools 
for the identification  of metastatic de posits ma y help to  reduce tot al surgical time,  as well as  help 
identify disease that may be microscopic or unable to be de tecte d with the naked eye (i.e., deep 
metastases).  In an effort to aid surgeons in disease detection, focus has been placed on the 
development of fluorescent imaging agents that can accurately detect small deposits of disease that may be missed under standard white light surgical procedures.
10,[ADDRESS_184612] of cellular metabolism, accumulates 
in the extracellular  space through excretion from tumor cells via the action of monocarboxylate 
transporters.13 The resulting acidific ation o f the extra-cellular space promotes remodelling of the 
extracellular ma trix f or further tu mor in vasion a nd me tastasis.14  
Pegsitacianine , a micellar fluorescence ima ging agent, exploits  the ubiquitous pH difference s 
observed between cancerous and normal tissues. This in turn, provides a highly sensitive and specific fluorescen ce response after localizing within the tumor microenvironment, thus allowing 
the detection of primary tumors, t heir margins,  metastatic disease, and tumor-containing lymph 
nodes.

Center Groningen and completed in 2019.19 The completed Phase 2 study, ON -1002: A Study to

([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  was a multicenter trial in the [LOCATION_002]. ON -[ADDRESS_184614] ion of tumors and 
metastatic lymph nodes in solid cancers. Additionally, the study investigated the optimal dose range of pegsitacianine for an adequate tumor- to-background/contrast- to-noise ratio of 
fluorescence obtained intraoperatively and with ex vivo  specimens using indocyanine green 
(ICG)  compatible cameras and imaging devices. A
 single pegsitacianine  micelle dose was 
administered intravenously (IV) as a one to five-minute infusion to patients in five dose cohorts (0.1, 
0.3, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.2 mg/kg) with three patients per cohort in Phase 1A, and 15 patients at a dose of 
1.2 mg/kg in Phase 1B. Near -infrared (NIR) imaging was conducted intraoperatively, on the back 
table, and postoperatively of the primary tumor, lymph nodes, and pegsitacianine  guided biopsies. 
Additionally, the bread loaf slices from the primary tumor were also imaged postoperatively. The 
median tumor-to -background (TBR) value from all bread loaf slice image analysis (n = 97 slices 
from 27 patients) was determined to be 4.5 with an interquartile range of 3.1. Additionally, 
pegsitacianine  demonstrated a sensitivity of 100% across all tumor types tested with a specificity of 
75% and 57% in breast cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), respectively.19  
 
The purpose of the ON-1002 study was  to investigate whether pegsitacianine can be used to 
image primary tumors and metastatic lymph nodes using an imaging schedule earlier than 24 ±[ADDRESS_184615] metastatic lymph nodes can be improved by [CONTACT_159027]. The study was  designed to be executed in three parts:

8. REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS 
All adverse events ( AEs) will be recorded in the eCRF, whether they are observed by [CONTACT_1275], reported by [CONTACT_423], observed from laboratory findings, or collected by [CONTACT_132067]. Adverse events will be monitored beginning on Day 0 through the end of the study (Day 28). Adverse events will be graded by [CONTACT_12214] a numerical score according to the defined National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 5.0 (2017). 
8.[ADDRESS_184630] the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_132037]. 
A treatment-emergent AE  (TEAE) is defined as any event not present before the first exposure to 
the study drug or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency 
following the first exposure to the study drug. 
OncoNano Medicine, Inc  
Study Protocol: ON -[ADDRESS_184631] to be stable. The description of the AE will include the onset date, duration, date of resolution, severity, seriousness, etiology, and the likelihood of relationship of the AE to study drug. 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any event that results in any of the following 
outcomes: 
• Results in death 
• Is life threatening, i.e., the subject was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that, hypothetically, might have caused death if it had occurred in a more severe form 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72010] 
• Results in persistent or significant disability and/or incapacity 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Is an important medical event 
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

Study Protocol: ON -1003   Page 36 of 51  
Version  03 09SEP 2022  Confidential  
 8.3 Assessment of Causality 
The investigator’s assessment of an AE's relationship to study drug is part of the documentation 
process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported. 
The relationship or association of the study drug in causing or contributing to the AE will be 
characterized using the following classification and criteria: 
• Unrelated: This relationship suggests that there is no association between the study drug 
and the reported event 
• Unlikely: This relationship suggests the temporal association between the AE and the study 
drug is such that the study drug is not likely to have any reasonable association with the AE 
• Possible: This relationship suggests that treatment with the study drug caused or 
contributed to the AE, i.e., the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of study drug administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the study drug, but could also have been produced by [CONTACT_1604] 
• Probable: This relationship suggests that a reasonable temporal sequence of the event 
with study drug administration exists and, based on  the known pharmacological action of 
the drug, known or previously reported adverse reactions to the drug or class of drugs, or judgment based on the investigator’s clinical experience, the association of the event with the study drug seems likely 
• Definite: This relationship suggests that a definite causal relationship exists between the 
study drug administration and the AE, and other conditions (concurrent illness, progression/expression of disease state, or concurrent medication reaction) do not appear to explain the event 
8.4 Assessment of Severity 
The intensity of the AE will be rated as mild, moderate, or severe using the following criteria: 
• Mild: These events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the 
subject’s daily activities 
• Moderate: These events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern wi th the 
therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning 
• Severe: These events interrupt a subject’s usual daily activity and may require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually incapacitating 
Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of intensity to be performed. Adverse events characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
OncoNano Medicine, Inc

the trial provided Serious Adverse Event Report Form. The following information should be entered into the EDC database at the time the SAE form is submitted: the demographics page(s), the medical history page(s), the AE page(s) and the concomitant medications page(s). If the subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_159012] a co  of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_159013]. Withdrawal from the study and all therapeutic measures will be at the 
discretion of the principal investigator. All SAEs, regardless of relationship to the study drug, will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the investigator deems the event to be chronic or the subject to be stable. 
9.STATISTICAL METHODS 
Additional statistical analyses, other than those described in this section, may be performed if 
deemed appropriate. Details of the analyses are described in the statistical analysis plan. 
9.[ADDRESS_184634] of all subjects who receive >75% of the intended dose of pegsitacianine, had a minimum of one (1) image collected during their procedure, and had the opportunity for post-SOC exploration of the peritoneal cavity. The safety population will include all subjects who were administered pegsitacianine whether it be a full or partial dose . 
9.3 Rate of Clinically Significant Events 
Determining the rate of clinically significant event s (CSE) detected by [CONTACT_159032]-level is the primary objective of this study. CSEs will include pegsitacianine detection of 
OncoNano Medicine, Inc  
Study Protocol: ON -[ADDRESS_184635] of CSEs and their definitions is provided below.  
• Detection of Occult Disease or Positive Surgical Margins– identification of tumor-
containing tissue due to pegsitacianine fluorescence, confirmed via histopathological analysis, that otherwise went undetected during pre-operative imaging (PET, MRI) or by [CONTACT_159033] 
o This occurs when a sample that (1) exhibits fluorescence in situ and (2) is pathologically-confirmed as a tumor, is obtained by [CONTACT_159034].  
 
• Tumor Negative SOC Biopsies – during SOC surgery, the surgeon will collect tissue 
specimens that are suspi[INVESTIGATOR_132040]. If those samples do not demonstrate pegsitacianine fluorescence and are found to be devoid of tumor pathologically, those specimens would be included as a tumor negative SOC biopsy 
o This occurs when a sample that (1) exhibits no fluorescence ex situ and (2) is 
pathologically-confirmed as normal tissue, is classified as suspi[INVESTIGATOR_159014].  
 
• Alteration to the Completeness of Cytoreduction (CC) Score – following the completion of 
the SOC surgery, the surgeon will document a CC score prior to fluorescence imaging using pegsitacianine. If the surgeon finds residual disease using fluorescence imaging that results in the increase of the CC score, this will be considered a CSE  
 
The number and proportion (with corresponding two-sided exact 95% confidence intervals) of 
subjects with any CSE will be reported.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_184636] ic performance of pegsitacianine will be assessed at the level of the specimen by 
[CONTACT_159035], specificity, PPV, and NPV of pegsitacianine in detecting tumor 
containing tissue. The ex situ  fluorescence status of collected SOC and pegsitacianine guided 
specimens will be compared to the histological analyses of the collected specimens (which is used 
to determine each sample’s status as true/false positive/negative). For determining these operating characteristics, consider the following definitions: 
• False positive is defined as “fluorescence was observed on the specimen but the specimen 
was not found to have tumor via histological analysis”. 
• False negative is defined as “no fluorescence was observed on the specimen but the 
specimen was found to have tumor via histological analysis”. 
OncoNano Medicine, Inc  
Study Protocol: ON -1003   Page 39 of 51  
Version  03 09SEP 2022  Confidential  
 • True positive is defined as “fluorescence was observed on the specimen and the specimen 
was found to have tumor via histological analysis”. 
• True negative is defined as “no fluorescence was observed on the specimen and the 
specimen was found not to have tumor via histological analysis”. 
The number of specimens in each category (each combination of true/false positive/negative), 
along with the true/false positive/negative rates (and corresponding exact two-sided 95% confidence intervals) will be reported. These rates will be used to determine pegsitacianine’s tumor detection sensitivity, specificity, PPV , and NPV  using the following equations:

 These rates will be reported along with exact two-sided 95% confidence intervals.
 
9.5 Quantification of Fluorescence Intensity 
Specimen- to-background (SBR) ratios and tumor- to-background (TBR) ratios will also be 
calculated using white light and NIR images of both SOC and pegsitacianine guided specimens. SBRs will be calculated using ex situ  images of collected specimens. The equation for calculating 
SBR is listed below.    
 
ࡾ࡮ࡿ= ݊ܽ݁ܯ ݁ܿ݊݁ܿݏ݁ݎ݋ݑ݈ܨ  ݕݐ݅ݏ݊݁ݐ݊ܫ( ݊݁݉݅ܿ݁݌ܵ)

TBR is calculated in the same way, but refers specifically to samples that are histologically confirmed as tumor.  
 
The mean fluorescence intensity of the specimen, of the background, and the SBR (or TBR) of each specimen will be summarized by [CONTACT_132073]-confirmed tumor status (either “tumor present” or “tumor not present/normal tissue”).

 9.6 Diagnostic Imaging Sensitivity Analyses 
In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_132041]. To assess 
how the amount of observed fluorescence (e.g., the SBR or TBR) may affect the diagnostic 
accuracy of pegsitacianine, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis will be performed on all specimens using the observed thresholds of SBR and TBR. The corresponding ROC curve will be provided along with the area under the curve (AUC).  
 
There is potential for within-subject correlation to bias our estimates of pegsitacianine’s diagnostic accuracy. To assess this issue, an ROC curve will be constructed from a mixed model that clusters specimens by [CONTACT_132074]. We will compare the AUC of the mixed effects ROC curve to the standard ROC curve to assess if within-subject correlation is causing significant bias in our analyses. If it is determined that significant bias has been introduced, additional analyses on secondary endpoints may be performed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of pegsitacianine. 
9.[ADDRESS_184637] deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values. Categorical data will be summarized by [CONTACT_132075] (frequency) and percentage of subjects at each level of response. Subject disposition will be presented and summarized.  Adverse events will be coded using MedDRA, Version 23.0 or higher, by [CONTACT_6657], and a listing of all AEs will be generated. Treatment -emergent AEs  (TEAEs), 
treatment-related TEAEs, TEAEs by [CONTACT_2236], TEAEs that lead to discontinuation of study drug, and SAEs  will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148], system organ class, and preferred term. 
The clinical laboratory data will be summarized by [CONTACT_7206], treatment group, and change from baseline. The values that are below the lower limit or above the upper limit of the reference range will be flagged. Those values or changes in values that are considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_132076]. Repeated or unscheduled results will not be included in the summary statistics but will be included in the individual data listings.

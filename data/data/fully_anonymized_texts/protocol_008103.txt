1 1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Study Synopsis  
We plan to enroll 29 patients in this open label, single arm, phase II study of the 
humanized monoclonal antibody (mAB) targeted against cell surface receptor 
programmed cell death -1 (PD -1), pembrolizumab, concomitant with and 
following standard of care definitive radiation for locally advanced SCCHN  
patients who are not good candidates for cisplatin.  We hypothesize that treatment 
with pembrolizumab and standard definitive radiation will result in a median progression free survival ( PFS) of 16 months, superior to a historic control of 10 
months. Secondary endpoints include PFS at 20  weeks , 1 year and 2 years, 
objective res ponse rate (OR R: complete respons e (CR)+ partial response (PR) ), 
rate of CR, overall survival (OS), time to locoregional recurrence and time to 
distant metastases . We will also characterize the toxicity profile of the treatment 
and describe quality of life over the course of therapy.  
 We may perform Multiplex next generation seque ncing of DNA and RNA for 
expression profiling and protein -level analys is for expression level of checkpoints 
that could influence the efficacy of pembrolizumab via co -enrollment of 
LCCC1509 patients into a separate tissue procurement study LCCC1108. These studies may allow us to explore associations between these immuno- based 
correlatives with clinical outcome.  
 It is standard of care to evaluate Human Papi[INVESTIGATOR_27509] ( HPV) status  in all 
oropharynx SCCHN patients, and we will also explore association between HPV status and outcome.   
1.2 Locally Advanced SCCHN: Cisplatin and Radiation as Standard of Care  
(SOC) 
The most common treatment of locally advanced SCCHN is the concomitant use 
of cisplatin and radiation.  This “bolus” or “high dose” regimen consists of daily (Mon -Fri) radiation for 7  weeks, and cisplatin 100mg/m
2 IV given every three 
weeks for a total of 3 doses starting day 1 of radiation.  This combination is highly accepted both in the [LOCATION_002] and internationally as a result of several studies.  Two such studies were particularly important.  The  meta -analysis of 
chemotherapy in  head and neck cancer (MACH -NC) [1] included all trials 
completed at the time of analysis that compared loco -regional treatment alone to 
loco-regional treatment plus chemotherapy ( n >16,000 patients), whether 
chemotherapy was given prior to (induction), concomitant with, or post local treatment. The greatest benefit was seen when chemotherapy was given concomitantly with radiation with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.[ADDRESS_936180] active  
chemotherapy agent , and the only drug recommended to be used alone when 
combined with definitive (i.e., curative intent) radiation.  The second study, RTOG 91 -11[2] was designed as a larynx -preservation trial, but its findings have 
LCCC1509  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_690095] 02, 2016 
    
2 been widely applied to other SCCHN anatomic sites as well.   In this study, 
patients with locally advanced larynx cancer were randomized to induction 
chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_54615], to concurrent chemoradiation or to radiotherapy alone.   The chemotherapy used in the chemoradiation arm of this 
trial was high dose cisplatin.  Five -year disease free survival (DFS)  improved 
from 27% with radiation alone to 36% with the addition of cisplatin, while overall survival (OS) at 5 years was unchanged.  These results are inadequate on an 
absolute basis, but are particularly unimpressive when toxicity is accounted for—82% of patients on RTOG91- 11 experienced severe toxicity.   
1.2.1 High -dose bolus Cisplatin with Radiation Therapy: A Standard of Care that 
roughly half of patients cannot receive  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_690096] “standard” regimen, a large proportion of patients are not eligible for high -dose bolus cisplatin.  Cisplatin is very ototoxic, and therefore 
poses increased risks to patients with any pre- existing high -frequency hea ring loss 
or tinnitus.  Its high degree of nephrotoxicity is of particular concern for patients with any pre -existing renal insufficiency, diabetes, or other risk factors for renal 
problems.  Cisplatin is highly neuropathic and therefore contraindicated in patients with pre -existing neuropathy and considered high risk in patients with 
diabetes.  Cisplatin is highly emetogenic; therefore, after appropriate counseling, many patients refuse it and many clinicians prefer to avoid it for patients with borderline performance status (PS).  
1.3 Locally Advanced SCCHN: Alternative Regimens  
Given the many problems with high dose cisplatin, it is surprising that there is no well-accepted, well -validated alternative.  The most frequently used alternative to 
high-dose cisplatin is weekly cisplatin. At a dose of 20mg/m
2, the existing data 
indicates a lack of efficacy [3].  At a dose of 40mg/m2, limited data suggest 
efficacy, but the toxicity starts to approach that of high dose cisplatin[ 4].  A mid -
range dose of 30mg/m2 weekly is very commonly used, but data on efficacy are 
very limited and it is not clear if this regimen is better than radiation alone or as good as bolus cisplatin[ 5, 6].  None of these weekly re gimens have ever been 
compared head to head with either radiation alone or with bolus cisplatin in a phase III randomized study.  
 Perhaps the best -validated alternative regimen is weekly cetuximab combined 
with radiation, approved for this indication by [CONTACT_34033] 2006.  Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody against the epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR).  A single randomized study comparing radiation combined with cetuximab to radiation alone [ 7, 8] demonstrated superior locoregional control, PFS and OS for 
the combination arm; the rate of distant metastases was not improved.  Cetuximab, however, is not widely used for a variety of reasons: concerns that it may be less effective than cisplatin, risk of anaphylaxis and controversy regarding subgroup analyses from the Bonner trial. Subgroup analysis from the Bonner study demonstrated that benefit was driven by [CONTACT_690107]+ population: young male patients with good performance status

3 (PS) and oropha rynx primary site [7, 8].  However, HPV+ tumors tend to be low 
expressers of EGFR [9] and, when final HPV data became available, there was no 
preferential effect by [CONTACT_33968] [10].  Novel agents for the treatment of locally 
advanced SCCHN are needed. Anticancer immunotherapeutics represent one 
exciting new class of novel agents worthy of further study in SCCHN.  
1.4 Pembrolizumab  (MK -3475) 
Pembrolizumab  (MK -3475) is a potent and highly selective intravenous 
humanized mAb of the immunoglobulin (Ig) G4/kappa isotype that directly blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. This blockade enhances functional activity of the target lymphocytes to facilitate an antitumor immune response, leading to tumor regression and immune rejection of the tumor. Indications currently under investigation by [CONTACT_353195]- small cell lung cancer and glioblastoma. 
Keytruda
TM (Pembrolizumab ) has recently been approved (at a dose of 2 mg/kg 
IV every 3 weeks) in the United Stated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with  disease pr ogression following 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_77972], if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. Further development of pembrolizumab in non- metastatic melanoma is ongoing. [11] 
1.4.[ADDRESS_936181] immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of 
neoplastic transformation has been known for decades [ 12].  Accumulating 
evidence shows a correlation between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in 
cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in various malignancies [ 13-17].  In 
particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector T -cells / 
FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells seems to correlate with improved prognosis and long-term survival in many solid tumors.  
 The PD -[ADDRESS_936182] hijacked by [CONTACT_70710].  The normal function of PD-1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T -cells under healthy conditions, is to down-modulate 
unwanted or excessive immune responses, including autoimmune reactions.  PD-1 (encoded by [CONTACT_464234]1) is an Ig superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA -4 that has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling 
upon engagement of its ligands (PD-L1 and/or PD- L2) [18, 19].  The structure of 
murine PD-1 has been resolved [9].  PD-1 and family members are type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable- type (V -type) domain 
responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding of signaling molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine-
based si gnaling motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif 
(ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM).    Following T- cell stimulation, PD -1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and 
SHP-2 to the ITSM motif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to the 
dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3ζ, PKCθ and ZAP70, all of

4 which are involved in the CD3 T- cell signaling cascade [18, 20-22].  The 
mechanism by [CONTACT_13209] -[ADDRESS_936183] from that of CTLA -4, as both molecules regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_199881] [13; 14].  PD-1 is expressed on activated lymphocytes 
including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T- cells, B -cells, T regs and Natural Killer 
cells [23, 24].  Expression has also been shown during thymic development on 
CD4 -CD8 - (double negative) T- cells as well as subsets of macrophages and 
dendritic cells [25].   
 The ligands for PD- 1 (PD -L1 and PD- L2) are constitutively expressed or can be 
induced in a variety of cell types, including non- hematopoietic tissues as well as 
in various tumors [ 25-28].  Both ligands are type I transmembrane receptors 
containing both IgV- and Ig  (constan t) C-like domains in the extracellular region 
and short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs.  Binding of either PD-[ADDRESS_936184] notably on vascular endothelium, whereas PD-L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antigen-presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments.  PD-L2 is thought to control immune T- cell 
activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD-L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T-
cell function in peripheral tissues [ 29].  Although healthy organs express little (if 
any) PD -L1, a variety of can cers are known to express abundant levels of this T-
cell inhibitor.  PD -1 has been suggested to regulate tumor- specific T -cell 
expansion in subjects with melanoma (MEL) [ 30].  This suggests that the PD-
1/PD-L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune evasion and should be considered as an attractive targ et for therapeutic intervention . 
1.4.2 Pre-clinical Findings   
Pembrolizumab  strongly enhances  T-ly mphoc yte immune  responses in 
cultured  blood cells from  healt hy human donors, cancer  patients,  and primates.   
In T- cell activation  assays using human donor blood cells,  the EC50  
(concentration wher e 50% of the maximum effect  is achieved)  has been  
reported to be  ~0.1 to 0.3 nM.  Levels of  interleukin -2 (IL- 2), tumor 
necrosis  factor  alpha (TNFα),  interferon  gamma  (IFNγ), and other cytokines 
are modulated by [CONTACT_90338]-3475.   The antibody potentiates  existing  immune 
responses only in the presence of antigen and does not nonspecifically activate  T-
cells. [11] 
 Using an  anti-m
 urine PD-1 analog antibody, PD-1 blockade has been shown to 
significantly inhibit tumor growt h in a variety of sy ngeneic murine tumor 
models.   In these experiment s in mice , anti-PD-1 therap y is sy nergistic  with 
chemotherapeutic agents such  as gemcitabine  and 5-fluorouracil (5- FU) and 
combination therapy results  in increased complete tumor regression rates in 
vivo.[ 11]

through an immunotherapeutic mechanism.  Recently, this hypothesis was tested in a mouse model in which tumor was injected into both flanks of the mice.  When only one flank was irradiated, there was no growth inhibition of the contralateral flank but when PD-L1 inhibition was added, there was growth inhibition . [34] 
 In vitro data also suggest that fractionated radiation increases tumoral PD -L1 
expression . [34, 35 ] Inhibition of PD-1 or PD- L1 concurrently with radiation 
enhances radiation  sensitivity and increases the cure rate in mice treated with 
radiotherapy [34].  Treatment with radiotherapy and PD-L1 inhibition leads to 
tumor antigen specific memory T cell responses that are protective against repeat tumor chal lenge.  Given the high rates of recurrence and second primary 
head/neck cancer, these results are potentially important to the treatment of human cancer.

part of treatment for locally advanced head/neck cancer and would remain so in any novel paradigm.  In RTOG91-[ADDRESS_936195] sequencing is concurrent treatment [1, 2, 36].  
As reviewed in section 1.2, the standard regimen for chemotherapy when administered concurrent with radiation is high -dose cisplatin administered every 
three weeks.  The standard schedule of pembrolizumab is also every three weeks 
(see section 1.8.2 for additional data) and this has therefore been maintained.  Historically, adjuvant therapy has not been efficacious, although it has never been studied with modern agents. Studies of neo-adjuvant treatment have focused on TPF (docetaxel, cisplatin and 5FU) where results have been negative [ 37-39] 
although the question is being re-asked with more modern agents (for example [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Because existing data on pembrolizumab indicate that efficacy can be delayed, it would be reasonable to utilize neo-adjuvant pembrolizumab or 
to at least to start p embrolizumab before radiation.  Such an approach might 
improve efficacy, but would also delay the initiation of radiation.  This approach is worthy of study, but is outside the context of this study of concurrent therapy.   Cell death from radiation is known to continue for weeks after the conclusion of active therapy; for this reason, we chose to administer additional pembrolizumab cycle s after the conclusion of radiation.  Given the lack of overlap between

9 pembrolizumab toxicity and the typi[INVESTIGATOR_690098], we believe that the relative ratio of potential 
benefit of this approach  vastly exceeds the risk of harm.  
 
1.8.2 Rationale for Dose Selection of Pembrolizumab   
An open- label [COMPANY_006] -sponsored Phase I trial (Protocol 001) evaluated the safety 
and clinical activity of single agent pembrolizumab.  The dose escalation portion of this trial evaluated three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) in subjects with advanced solid tumors.  All dose levels were well tolerated and no dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs) were 
observed.  This first in human study of pembrolizumab showed evidence of target engagement and objective evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels.  No maximally tolerated dose ( MTD) has been identified to date. Recent data from 
other clinical studies with in the pembrolizumab program have shown that a lower 
dose of pembrolizumab and a less frequent schedule may be sufficient for target engage ment and clinical activity.  
 Pharmacokinetic (PK) data analysis of pembrolizumab administered Q2W and 
Q3W showed slow systemic clearance, limited volume of distribution, and a long half-life. [11]  Pharmacodynamic (PD) data (IL -2 release assay) suggested that 
peripheral target engagement is durable (>21 days).  This early PK and PD  data 
provides scientific rationale for testing a Q2W and Q3W dosing schedule.    A population PK  analysis  of pembrolizumab has been performed using serum 
concentration time data from 476 patients. Within the resulting population PK model, clearance and volume parameters of pembrolizumab were found to be dependent on body weight. The relationship between clearance and body weight, with an allometric exponent of 0.59, is within the range observed for other antibodies and supports both body weight normalized dosing or a fixed dose across all body weights  ([COMPANY_006], written communication).   
 The choice of the 200 mg every 3 weeks  as an appropriate dose for the switch to 
fixed dosing of pembrolizumab (which is pending FDA approval, and which is incorporated into this study)  is based on simulations performed using the 
population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that the fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally consistent with those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks (the current FDA approved dose), 2) will maintain individual patient exposures in the exposure range established in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy response and 3) will maintain individual patients exposure in the exposure range established i n melanoma that 
are well tolerated and safe ([COMPANY_006], written communication) . A fixed dose regimen 
will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenient for physicians and to reduce potential for dosing errors.  A fixed dosing scheme will also reduce comple xity in the logistical chain at treatment facilities and reduce wastage.

seen at UNC  and s ites recruited to participate will be required to obtain HPV 
status , and we will explore association between HPV status and outcome.   
 
Exploratory objectives based on serial blood collections and tumor samples may include some or all of the following (depending on availability of archival diagnostic tissue): an evaluatio n of t he predictive capacity of PD -L1 expression, 
immune gene signatures, and a characterization of the change in phenotype in tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) before and after therapy.  We may also 
explore whether T cell and B cell repertoires  (TCRs and BCRs respectively; 
discovered via DNA and RNA sequencing) are enriched in tumors and/or blood at baseline and whether any change is seen in blood post treatment. We hypothesize that each of the following (increased PD -L1 mRNA expression, effector immune 
infiltrate, clonality in TILs  and decreased regulatory cell populations ) will be 
associated with a longer PFS.  Collection of samples for correlative studies  will be 
an option provided to patients in LCCC1509 and will involve co -enrollment in to 
the tissue  procurement study LCCC1108.  We will also collect serum for 
exploration of a  proteomic immune signature [CONTACT_690120], and its possible 
association with OR, PFS and OS. This proteomic immune signature [CONTACT_690121] [CONTACT_602761].  Additional details regarding correlative studies can be found in the laboratory manual.

16 4.1 Study Schema  
 
  
Also see section 6.1 for schedule of serial blood draws for biocorrelative studies. 
4.2 Radiation Therapy 
All patients will receive Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy Treatments (IMRT)  as 
per standard of care (details of which are outlined below).  One IMRT plan with 2 
to 3 planning target volumes (PTVs) will be created.  Dose painting is required.  
The total dose will be 70 Gy at 2Gy/fx, [ADDRESS_936212] mask. Patients will be positioned in the neck extended position. 
4.2.2 Target and Organ at Risk Volumes 
[IP_ADDRESS] Gross T umor Volume (GTV): is defined as all known gross disease determined 
on the CT simulation scan. 
[IP_ADDRESS] High Risk Clinical Target Volumes (CTV -HR) is defined as the GTV plus a 
non-uniformly expanded 5 to 10 mm to account for high risk areas of microscopic spread. For situations where the primary tumor was removed with the biopsy (e.g. tonsillectomy) and the primary tumor cannot be seen on radiographi c imaging the biopsy site will be included in the CTV -HR.  A CTV-
HR is required for all patients. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Intermediate Risk Clinical Target Volume (CTV -IR) is optional except for 
patients with an unknown primary.  For patients with an unknown primary (T0) the ipsilateral oropharynx (base of tongue, tonsil, soft palat e) will be included in 
the CTV -IR volume.  Other potential (but not required) indications for 
contouring a CTV-IR is to include the entirety  of nodal level that contains a 
positive node or to include adjacent nodal levels.  For example if there is a node positive in Level 2, the node will be encompassed in the CTV- HR and a CTV -
IR may be used to cover the remainder of Level 2 and adjacent Level 3.   The purpose in using a CTV- IR is to cover intermediate risk areas o f microscopic 
spread.   

LCCC1509  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_690095] 02, 2016 
    
17 [IP_ADDRESS] Standard Risk Clinical Target Volume (CTV -SR) is defined as the elective 
nodal regions. The consensus guidelines for the node negative and node positive 
necks published by [CONTACT_414413]. will be used as a guide to define the CTV -
SR.[40, 41 ] For the situation of the unknown primary (i.e. T0), the nasopharynx 
will be included in the CTV-SR. The following guidelines will be used in delineating the CTV -SR. 
• Node positive hemi- neck
 (ipsilateral or con tralateral to the primary site) 
[40]: The following elective nodal regions should be included in the CTV-
SR: Levels Ib -V.  The retropharyngeal  region should also be included in 
oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal primary tumors . The cranial extent to 
the base of skull of Level II and retropharyngeal nodes should be electively irradiated  for oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal primary 
tumors. 
• Ipsilateral node negative hemi- neck [ 41
] The following elective nodal 
regions should be included in the CTV- SR: Levels II –IV. The 
retropharyngeal region should also be included in oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal primary tumors. The cranial extent to the base of skull of 
Level II and retropharyngeal nodes should be electively irradiated for 
oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal primary tumors.   
• Contralateral node negative hemi- neck[ 41, 42 ]: The contralateral parotid 
may be spared by [CONTACT_690109], defined as the Level II, retropharyngeal region above the transverse process of the C1 vertebrae and/or where the posterior belly of  the digastric muscle crosses over the jugular vein.  
• Omission of Contralateral neck negative hemi- neck irradiation :  
Contralateral neck irradiation may be completely omitted for well 
lateralized tonsil cancers, defined as having no invasion of the base of tongue, and minimal invasion of the soft palate (i.e. > 1 cm from the uvula).  Bilateral neck radiation is required for larynx and hypopharyngeal 
primary tumors.   The contralateral node negative neck may be omitted in a 
well lateralized T1 -T2 oral cavity cancer (i.e. oral tongue, alveolar ridge, 
buccal cavity).    
• Unknown Primary : The above elective nodal irradiation guidelines will be 
used. Furthermore the nasopharynx will be included in the CTV- SR. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Planning Target Volumes (PTV): To account for daily setup errors, the CTV’s 
will be expanded uniformly by 3 mm to create a High Risk Planning Target Volume (PTV- HR), Intermediate Risk Planning Target Volume (PTV -IR), and 
LCCC1509  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_690095] 02, [ADDRESS_936213] Risk Planning Target Volume (PTV- SR).  The PTV -IR is optional 
except for unknown primary tumors (see above section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
[IP_ADDRESS] Organs at Risk (OAR):  The following normal tissues will be segmented on CT 
simulation sca n: spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], brainstem, parotids, cochleae, and larynx. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Planning Risk Volumes (PRV): OAR(s) will be uniformly expanded 3mm to

4.2.3 Dose Specification   
Dose painting IMRT will be used and all doses will be specified to the PTV. The 
PTV -HR, PTV -IR, and PTV- SR will be treated to the following respective total 
doses: 70 Gy, 63 Gy, and 54 Gy. The dose per fraction to the PTV- HR, PTV -IR, 
and P TV-SR will be 2 Gy per day, 1.8 Gy per day, and 1.54 Gy respectively. 
Thus the total number of fractions will be 35. All fields will be treated once a day Monday through Friday. 
4.2.4 IMRT Treatment Planning  
PTV’s and PRV will be included in the IMRT optimization. Seven to nine equidistant fields will be placed around the PTV. None of the beams will directly oppose one another. Tomotherapy® and other arc-based IMRT technologies (VMAT®, Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_292505]®) are allowed.  Dose objectives will be chosen for the IMRT optimization based on previous institutional experience. Dose painting (i.e. simultaneous integrated boost) will be used to create one IMRT plan. The PTV-SR contours will encompass the PTV -IR and PTV -HR contours . IMRT to treat 
the entire neck is preferred, however a matched low anterior neck field technique may be used only if it does not result in significant dose heterogeneity for the PTV -HR. 
4.2.5 Regimen  
Radiation continues for 35  consecutive weekdays . Patient will receive 2 Gy daily 
fractions of radiotherapy without a break except for  weekends and holidays.

pembrolizumab 200mg IV every 3 weeks for 6 doses . 
 
Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion.  Sites should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible.  However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of -5 minutes and +10 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: -5 min/+10 min).  The Pharmacy Manual contains specific instructions 
for the preparation of the pembrolizumab infusion fluid and administration of infusion solution. This manual is provided as a document separate from the protocol.  NOTE:  Subjects should be assessed for possible Events of Clinical Interest ( ECI;  
see the document provided separate from this protocol) prior to each dose.  Lab 
results should be evaluated and subjects should be asked for signs and symptoms suggestive of an immune-related event.  Subjects who develop an ECI thought to be immune-related should have additional testing to rule out other etiologic causes. If no other cause is found, then it is assumed to be immune- related.

Adverse events (both non- seriou s and serious) associated with pembrolizumab 
exposure may represent an immunologic etiology.  These adverse events may 
occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the last dose of treatment. Pembrolizumab must be withheld for drug- related toxicities and severe or life-
threatening AEs as per Table below. Also see section 4.3.4 for supportive care 
guidelines of drug -related events. See Section , including use of corticosteroids. 
 
Dosing interruptions are permitted in the case of medical/ surgica l events or 
logistical reasons not related to study therapy (e.g., elective surgery, unrelated 
medical events, patient vacation, and/or holidays). Subjects should be placed back on study therapy within 3 weeks of the scheduled interruption, unless otherwise discussed with the Sponsor. The reason for interruption should be documented in the patient's study record.  If a dose of pembrolizumab  is delayed, then the subsequent dose should be 
administered  3 weeks later.   When pembrolizumab is delayed or held, radiation 
may and should continue if clinically appropriate.  Patients may receive up to 6 total doses of pembrolizumab, even if doses are delayed to the point that they do not overlap with radiation. If radiation therapy is held, pembrolizumab therapy may continue as per the discretion of the investigator, and based on the nature of the toxicity.

24 4.3.4 Rescue Medications & Supportive Care  
Supportive Care Guidelines  
Patients should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary 
by [CONTACT_12707].  Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse events with potential immunologic etiology are outlined below. Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or intravenous treatment with corticosteroids as well as additional anti- inflammatory agents if 
symptoms do not improve with administration of corticosteroids.   Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule out other cause s such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, 
which might require additional supportive care. The treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when the investigator determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab.   Note:  if after t he evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the 
investigator does not need to follow the treatment guidance as outlined below . 
Refer to Section  4.3.3 for dose modifications.  
 It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin photography as part of evaluation of the event.   Hematologic (see table in Section 4.3.3 for what is considered hematologic ECI) 
 All attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metastases, sepsis and/or infection. Relevant diagnostic studies such as peripheral blood smear, reticulocyte count, LDH, haptoglobin, bone marrow biopsy or Coomb’s test, etc., should be considered to confirm the diagnosis.   
For Grade 2 events:  
• Hold pembrolizumab 
• Prednisone 1- 2 mg/kg daily may be indicated  
• Consider Hematology consultation 
• Permanently discontinue for inability to reduce corticosteroid dose to 10 
mg or less of prednisone or equivalent per day within 12 weeks. 
 Grade 3 events:  
• Hematology consultation  
• Hold pembrolizumab  
• Discontinuation should be considered at discretion of invest igator  
• Treat with methylprednisolone 125 mg iv or prednisone 1-2 mg/kg p.o. (or 
equivalent) as appropriate 
• Permanently discontinue for inability to reduce corticosteroid dose to 10 mg or less of prednisone or equivalent per day within 12 weeks.

Diarrhea/Colitis:  
Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).   
o All subjects who experience diarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink liberal quantities of clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion.  For Grade 2 or higher diarrhea, consider GI consultation and endoscopy to confirm or rule out colitis.  
o For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis,  administer oral corticosteroids.  
o For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis,  treat with intravenous stero ids 
followed by [CONTACT_78018].   
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.

4.7 Removal of Patients from Protocol Therapy  
Patients will be removed from protocol therapy and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_690103]  4.5 apply.  The reason for discontinuation of protocol 
therapy will be documented on the eCRF.    In case a patient decides to prematurely discontinue protocol therapy (“refuses  
treatment”), the patient should be asked if she or he may still be contact[CONTACT_690110]. The outcome of that discussion should be documented in both the medical records and in the eCRF. 
4.8 Study Withdrawal  
If a patient decides to withdraw  from the study (and not just from protocol 
therapy)  all efforts should be made to complete and report study assessments as 
thoroughly as possible. The investigator should contact [CONTACT_76409] a responsible relative by [CONTACT_353197] a personal visit to est ablish as 
completely as  possible the reason for the study withdrawal. A complete final 
evaluation at the time of the  patient’s study withdrawal should be made with an 
explanation of why the patient is  withdrawing from the study. If the reason for 
removal o f a patient from the study is an  adverse event, the principal specific 
event will be recorded on the eCRF. Excessive patient  withdrawals  from protocol

5.1.[ADDRESS_936229] common adverse reactions (reported in ≥20% of patients in clinical 
trials of pembrolizumab ) included fatigue, cough, nausea, pruritus, rash, 
decreased appetite, constipation, arthralgia, and diarrhea. The following warnings are associated with the use of pembrolizumab:   
   
Immune- Medi ated Pneumonitis  
Pneumonitis occurred in ~3% of melanoma patients treated in clinical trials of pembrolizumab. The median time to development of pneumonitis was 5 months with a median duration of 4.9 months.  The one patient with Grade 3 pneumonitis requir ed initial treatment with high -dose systemic corticosteroids (greater than or 
equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) followed by a corticosteroid taper.  Pneumonitis completely resolved in seven of the nine patients with 
Grade 2 -3 pneumonitis. 
 
Immune- Mediated Colitis  
Colitis (including microscopic colitis) occurred 1% of melanoma patients treated in clinical trials of pembrolizumab. The median time to onset of was 6.5 months with a median duration of 2.6 months. All three patients with Grade 2 or 3 colitis were treated with high -dose corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40 mg 
prednisone or equivalent per day).  
Immune- Mediated Hepatitis  
Hepatitis (including autoimmune hepatitis) occurred in 0.5% of melanoma 
patients treated in clinical trials of pembrolizumab. The time to onset was 22 days 
for the case of Grade 4 hepatitis which lasted 1.1 months. The patient with Grade 
4 hepatitis permanently discontinued pembrolizumab and was treated with high -
dose (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) systemic corticosteroids followed by a corticosteroid taper. Both patients with hepatitis experienced complete resolution of the event.     
Immune- Mediated Hy pophysitis
  
Hypophysitis occurred in 0.5% of melanoma patients treated in clinical trials of pembrolizumab. The time to onset was 1.7 months for the patient with Grade 4 hypophysitis and 1.3 months for the patient with Grade 2 hypophysitis. Both patients w ere treated with high -dose (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or 
LCCC1509  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_690095] 02, 2016 
    
31 equivalent per day) corticosteroids followed by a corticosteroid taper and 
remained on a physiologic replacement dose.   Renal Failure and Immune- Mediated Nephritis
  
Nephritis occurred in 3 (0.7%) patients of melanoma patients treated in clinical trials of pembrolizumab , consisting of one case of Grade 2 autoimmune nephritis 
(0.2%) and two cases of interstitial nephritis with renal failure (0.5%), one Grade [ADDRESS_936230] dose of pembrolizumab ([ADDRESS_936231] dose) and lasted 3.2 months; this patient did not have a biopsy. Acute interstitial nephritis was confirmed by [CONTACT_240322] 3 -4 renal failure. All three 
patients fully recovered renal function with treatment with high -dose 
corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) followed by a corticosteroid taper . 
 
Immune- Mediated Hyperthyroidi sm  
Hyperthyroidism occurred in 5 (1.2%) of 411 melanoma patients treated in clinical trials of pembrolizumab. The median time to onset was  1.5 months and 
the median duration was 2.8 months (range 0.9 to 6.1). One of two patients with Grade 2 and the one pa tient with Grade 3 hyperthyroidism required initial 
treatment with high -dose corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40 mg 
prednisone or equivalent per day) followed by a corticosteroid taper. One patient (0.2%) required permanent discontinuation of pembrolizumab due to hyperthyroidism. All five patients with hyperthyroidism experienced complete resolution of the event.  
Immune- Mediated Hypo thyroidi sm  
Hypothyroidism occurred in 34 (8.3%) of 411 melanoma patients treated in clinical trials of pembrolizuma b. The median time to onset of hypothyroidism was 
3.5 months. All but two of the patients with hypothyroidism were treated with long-term thyroidhormone replacement therapy. The other two patients only required short- term thyroid hormone replacement therap y. No patient received 
corticosteroids or discontinued pembrolizumab for management of hypothyroidism. Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment.  
 
Other Immune -Mediated Adverse Reactions  
Other clinically important immune -mediated adverse reactions can occur. The 
following clinically significant, immune -mediated adverse reactions occurred in 
less than 1% of patients treated with pembrolizumab, including exfoliative dermatitis, uveitis, arthritis, myositis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, partial seizures arising in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma, and  
adrenal insufficiency.  
 Across clinical studies with pembrolizumab in approximately 2000 patients, the following additional clinically significant, immune -mediated adverse reactions 
LCCC1509  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_690095] 02, 2016 
    
32 were reported in less than 1% of patients: myasthenic syndrome, optic neuritis, 
and rhabdomyolysis.  
Embryofetal Toxicity  
Based on its mechanism of action, pembrolizumab may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal models link  the PD -1/PD-L1 
signaling pathway with maintenance of pregnancy through induction of maternal immune tolerance to fetal tissue.

Acceptable methods of contraception are‡: 
Single method (one of the following is acceptable): 
• intrauterine device (IUD)  
• vasectomy of a female subject’s male partner  
• contraceptive rod implanted into the skin 
 Combination method (requires use of two of the following): 
• diaphragm with spermicide (cannot be used in conjunction with cervical 
cap/spermicide)  
• cervical cap with spermicide (nulliparous women only)   • contraceptive sponge (nulliparous women only)  • male condom or female condom (cannot be used together) • hormonal contraceptive: oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] ( estrogen /progestin pi[INVESTIGATOR_401115]-only pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]), contraceptive skin patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, or subcutaneous contraceptive injection . 
 
†Abstinence (relative to heterosexual  activity) can be used as the sole method of 
contraception if it is consistently employed as the subject’s preferred and usual lifestyle and if considered acceptable by [CONTACT_176742]/IRBs.  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulatio n, sympto- thermal, 
post-ovulation methods, etc.) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.   ‡If a contraceptive method listed above is restricted by [CONTACT_427]/guidelines, then it does not qualify as an acceptable method of contra ception for subjects participating at sites in this country/region.

doses were completed, or due to toxicity, progression etc., patients will be evaluated for [ADDRESS_936242] pembrolizumab safety. In patients who complete all doses on time, this visit should occur at week 20.  
Patients who  are still experiencing a treatment -related  ≥ Grade 2 adverse event will be contact[CONTACT_457] 2 
weeks until the event is resolved to Grade 0 or 1, determined to be irreversible by [CONTACT_093], or until the patient begins an alternate form of treatment.  
 
 
4At week 20 of the study, ( ~12 weeks  (+/- 7 days ) after the last dose of radiation ), a PET scan is required. If 
PET was done at baseline, remain consistent with the type of PET scan (either PET -CT or PET -MRI).  If a 
PET scan is refused by [CONTACT_22241], a neck CT or MRI (consistent with the  test ordered at baseline whether 
associated with PET or not) will be acceptable.

These are described in more detail in the laboratory manual.  
6.6.1 Archival Tissue  
Archival tumor tissue (paraffin -embedded blocks/slides) from the patient’s 
original diagnostic biopsy will be requested and collected from all enrolled 
patients.  See accompanying laboratory manual for additional details.  
6.6.[ADDRESS_936248] a three ACD tubes (whole blood, 3 x 8mL) and a serum 
separator tube (gel barrier) collected at the times as noted in the Time and Event 
table . Sample collection, storage, and shipment instructions for serum samples 
will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
6.7 Assessment of Safety  
Any patient who receives treatment on this protocol will be evaluable for toxicity.  Each patient will be assessed periodically for the development of any toxicity according to the Time and Events table (section 6.0).  Toxicity will be assessed according to the NCI CTCAE v4. Toxicities will be characterized in terms regarding seriousness, causality, toxicity grading, and action taken with regard to trial treatment.  Patient reported outcomes will be assessed via the PRO -CTCAE, 
see sect ion 6.5. 
 For subjects receiving treatment with pembrolizumab all AEs of un known 
etiology associated with p embrolizumab exposure should be evaluated to 
determine if it is possibly  an ECI  of a potentially immunologic etiology (termed 
immune -related adverse events, or irAEs); see the separate ECI guidance 
document (provided as a document separate from this protocol) regarding the identification, evaluation and management of potential irAEs.    Please refer to section 7.[ADDRESS_936249] 1 dose of pembrolizumab will be evaluable for 
assessment of response and progression.   Patients whose cancer growth is 
documented by [CONTACT_690113].  Patients who drop out of the study for any reason (ex.  toxicity of 
treatment , decide to withdraw) will still be followed for PFS and OS.

• >10mm by [CONTACT_3610] (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)  
• 10mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non -
measurable).  
• [ADDRESS_936251] be ≥15mm in short axis when assessed by [CONTACT_3610] (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5mm).  At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.    All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis) as well as truly non-measurable lesions, will be considered non- measurable.  Lesions co nsidered truly 
non-measurable include:leptomeningeal disease; ascites; pleural/pericardial 
effusion; inflammatory breast disease; lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_690114]. 
 All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically assessed. All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.  Imaging based evaluation should always be done rather than cl inical 
examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and ≥10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3606] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesions is recommended.  
6.8.2 Baseline Documentation of Target and Non- Target Lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline.   
 Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longer diameter) , be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those 
that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.

44 A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal 
lesions) for all target lesions will be ca lculated and reported as the baseline sum 
diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable dimension of 
the disease.  
 All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and these lesions should be f ollowed as “present” 
or “absent”, or in rare cases “unequivocal progression”.   
6.8.[ADDRESS_936252] 1.1 Criteria  
Complete response (CR)−
Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph node (LN) (whether target or non- target)  must have decreased in short axis 
to <10mm. 
 Partial response (PR)
−At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of the target 
lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD.  
 Progressive Disease (PD
)−At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of the 
target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started including baseline if that is the smallest on study.  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm.  The appearance of one or more new lesions also constitutes PD.  
 Stable disease (SD)−
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD taking as references the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.  
6.8.[ADDRESS_936253]  1.1 Criteria  
Complete response (CR)− Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker levels.  All LN must be non -pathological in size 
(<10mm short axis).   
 Non-complete response (non-CR)/non-progression (non- PD)
−Persistence of one 
or more  non- target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the 
normal limits.  
 Progressive disease (PD)
−Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions. 
7.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
LCCC1509  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_690095] 02, 2016 
    
45 7.1 Definition s  
7.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., an abnormal 
laboratory finding, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug) in a patient or clinical investigation  subject administered a pharmaceutical 
product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease tempor ally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product.   
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129297] (e.g., surgical insertion of central line) need not be considered AEs and should not be recorded as an AE.  Disease progression should not be recorded as an AE, unless it is attributable by [CONTACT_353202].  All adverse events that occur after the consent form is signed but before tr eatment 
must be reported by [CONTACT_26364], or are the result of a protocol-specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure.  
 From the time of treatment through [ADDRESS_936254] be reported by [CONTACT_093]. Such events will be recorded at each examination on the Adverse Event case report forms/worksheets.  The reporting timeframe for adverse events meeting any serious criteria is described in section 7.1.4. The investigator will make every attempt to follow all subjects with 
non-serious adverse events for outcome.  Adverse events will not be collected for subjects during the pre-screening period (for determination of archival tissue status) as long as that subject has not undergone any protocol-specified procedure or intervention.  If the subject requires a blood draw, fresh tumor biopsy etc., the subject is first required to provide consent to the main study and AEs will be captured according to guidelines for standard AE reporting.   
7.1.2 Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is any AE for which there is a reasonable 
possibility  that the drug is the cause.   Reasonable possibility  means that there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE.  A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.   
 
LCCC1509  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_690095] 02, 2016 
    
46 Causality assessment to a study drug is a  medical judgment made in consideration 
of the following factors: temporal relationship of the AE to study drug exposure, 
known mechanism of action or side effect profile of study treatment, other recent or concomitant drug exposures, normal clinical course of the disease under investigation, and any other underlying or concurrent medical conditions.  Other factors to consider in considering drug as the cause of the AE: 
• Single occurrence of an uncommon event known to be strongly associated 
with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson 
Syndrome) 
• One or more occurr ences of an event not commonly associated with drug 
exposure, but otherwise uncommon in the population (e.g., tendon rupture); often more than once occurrence from one or multiple studies would be needed before the sponsor could determine that there is reasonable possibility  that the drug caused the event.   
• An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial that 
indicates the events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group 
than in a concurrent or historical control group.  
7.1.[ADDRESS_936255] information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for an unapproved investigational product or package insert/summar y of 
product characteristics for an approved product).  Unexpected also refers to AEs 
or SARs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentio ned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.   
 
7.1.4 Serious AE or SAR  
An AE or SAR is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes : 
• Death;  
• Is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred);  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (>24 hours) or prolongation of 
existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];*  
• Results in  congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial 
disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; 
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious 
adverse drug experience when, based upon appropria te medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed

 *Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_353184], central line insertion, metastasis interventional therapy, resection of primary tumor, or elective surgery, will not be considered serious adverse events.  
 Pregnancy that occurs during the study must also be reported as an SAE. 
• Note: In addition to the above criteria, adverse events meeting either of 
the below criteria, although not serious per ICH definition, are 
reportable to the [COMPANY_006] in the same timeframe as SAEs to meet certain local requirements. Therefore, these events are considered serious by [CONTACT_131892]. 
● Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study); ● Is associated w ith an overdose. 
 For the time period beginning when the consent form is signed until tr eatment ,

7.3.1 Timing  
After informed consent but prior to initiation of study medications, only SAEs caused by a protocol -mandated intervention will be collected (e.g. SAEs related to 
invasive procedures such as biopsies, medication washout.   For any other experience or condition that meets the definition of an SAE or a 
serious SAR, recording of the event must begin from day 1 of study treatment and continue through the 90 day follow -up period after treatment is discontinued (or 
to the initiation of new anti- cancer treatment, whichever is earliest) .

UNC : 
• UNC will submit an aggregated list of all SAEs to the UNC IRB annually 
at the time of study renewal according to the UNC IRB policies and 
procedures. 
• The UNC -IRB will be notified of all SAEs that qualify as an

definitive radiation , for locally advanced SCCHN  patients who are not good 
candidates for cisplatin.  Objectives include estimating PFS and OS, response 
rates, safety & toxicity, and quality of life in these patients.  Correlative studies, 
based on serial blood collections and tumor samples, may be done under a separate protocol based on availability of archival diagnostic tissue (see section 1.9). 
8.2 Sample Size and Accrual  
In the Bonner study, me dian PFS (mPFS) was improved from 12.[ADDRESS_936274] 
decreased our null hypothesis from Bonner’s 12.4 months to 10 months.  However, we hope to provide a larger gain in PFS as we hope that pembrolizumab will be more active than cetuximab; in particular, where cetuxim ab had no impact on distant control, we believe that the existing data on 
pembrolizumab in the metastatic setting gives reason to believe that pembrolizumab should improve distant control.  We therefore hypothesize that the addition of pembrolizumab to radiotherapy will improve mPFS from 10 months to 16 months.  Assuming uniform accrual, no loss to follow-up, exponentially distributed times , and a one- side alpha of 0.1, 29 patients are 
needed to provide 80% power to detect this level of improvement.  We ant icipate 
accrual to take [ADDRESS_936275] 12 months.  This 
calculation was made using the SWOG Statistical Center online tool for one arm survival ( https://stattools.crab.org/# ).

using the Kaplan- Meier (KM) method .    The KM method will also be used to 
estimate all other “time to event” outcomes (ex. OS, time to locoregional recurrence, time to distant metastases) ; median times along with r ates at  20 
weeks,  1 and 2 years will be reported, along with 95% confidence int ervals.  All 
patients who receive at least one dose of pembrolizumab will be included in these estimates, with censoring used as needed (ex. if a patient drops out of the study, or analysis is done before all patients have had the event of interest).  The KM 
method, along with Log- rank tests , will be used for exploratory objectives which 
include comparisons between groups (ex. HPV status, biological markers).

54 Descriptive statistics (percentages and means/standard deviations) will be used to 
summarize the o verall response rate (OR R), complete res ponse rate (CRR)  and 
quality of life scores.  Depending on the availability of data, longitudinal models may be used to describe changes in quality of life scores over time.  Fisher’s exact tests and Wilcoxon rank sum tests will be used to explore the association of exploratory endpoints (ex. HPV status and tumor biomarkers) with response as 
appropriate.   
 
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_690115] <95% of the intended dose of radiation (i.e., <67 Gy) and by [CONTACT_690116] (both patient and physician reported).  Additionally, continuous monitoring for toxicity will be employed.  Sequential boundaries will be used to monitor for unacceptable toxicity.  For this study this will be defined as failing to receive at least 95% of the intended dose of XRT.   
 The accrual will be halted if excessive numbers of patients fail to receive at least 
95% of the intended dose of XRT --that is, if the number of patients  is equal to or 
exceeds b

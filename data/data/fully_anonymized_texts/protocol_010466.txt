3.4. Enrollment Strategy  
Study subjects will be recruited from the clinical site’s subject database and/or utilizing 
Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Inst itutional Review Bo ard (IRB) approved 
materials. 
CR-[ADDRESS_1142111] or Control group (60 subjects/arm) .The goal is for a sample size of 112after 
subjects who withdraw or are lost -to-follow -up.Subjects are scheduled for 3 study visits 
(screening/baseline, 7 -Day and 30 -Day follow -up visits) over a period of one month.
At Visit 1, subjects will be consented and screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria .  If a 
subject is found to meet all eligibility criteria, they will be dispensed with artificial tears 
eye drops based on the randomization scheme ; otherwise, the subject will be discontinued 
from the study .Subjects will be dispensed with their randomly assigned eye drops and 
instructed to use them in both eyes, 3-4times a day over a 7±1day period. The follow -up
evaluation (Visit 2) will occur 7±1days after Visit [ADDRESS_1142112] 30+/-2days after Visit 1.
At Visit 3, VAS and PRO questionnaires, SROS , NITBUT and slit lamp findings will be 
evaluated, and the subject will have a final evaluation before exiting from the study. 
4.2. Study Design Rationale  
Randomized, double masked, controlled de signs are the gold standard to perform 
scientifically sound evaluations of the intervention by [CONTACT_823677] a clinical trial a nd avoiding confounding from other factors.
A [ADDRESS_1142113] of cyclica l changes to tear 
quality in female subjects.9
4.3. Enrollment Target and Study Duration  
A total of up to 150subjects will be enrolled (informed consent signed) and randomized 
(60 per arm) from up to 7clinical sites in the US. The goal is for a sample size of 112
subjects (56 per arm) after s ubjects who withdraw or are lost tofollow -up.
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring th at all subjects entering the study conform to 
subject selection criteria. The number of subjects targeted for randomization and 
completion are as follows:

Completion 56 56 112
Number of sites 7 7 7
Number of subjects/site 
Min-Max 8-[ADDRESS_1142114] or Control group based on a computer -
generated randomization schedule prepared before the start of the study. The 
randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_823679] 4
assignments will be used within each study site. The randomizatio n scheme will be 
generated using the PROC PLAN procedure from the Statistical Analysis System (SAS)
Software version 9.[ADDRESS_1142115] baseline visit (Visit 1 ).The 
following must have occurred prior to randomization:
xInformed consent has been obtained
xSubject meets all the inclusion / exclusion criteria
xSubject history and baseline information has been collected
5.2. Masking  
This is a double -masked study where su bjects and the investigators are masked to the 
identity of the eye drops during the study period. Every attempt will be made to keep the 
other clinical trial personnel involved in the study (e.g., Data management, Biostatistician) 
unaware of the identity of the test articles .
The identity of the investigational products will be masked by [CONTACT_823680] a label containing the study number, expi[INVESTIGATOR_724315]. Only the personnel involved in the over labeling and the unmasked Statistician 
generating the randomization scheme will have access to the decode information translating 
the randomization codes into Test and Control eye drops .The medical monitor will als o
have access to the decode information in case bre aking the mask is necessary for the urgent 
medical treatment of a subject. 
5.3. Procedures for Maintaining and Breaking the Masking  
Under normal circumstances, the mask s hould not be broken until all subjects have 
completed the study and the datab ase is finalized. Otherwise, the mask should be broken 
only if specific emergency treatment/c ourse of action would be dictated by [CONTACT_823681]. In such cases, the Investigator may, in an emergency, contact 
[CONTACT_7195].  In the event the mask is broken, the Sponsor must be informed as 
soon as possible. The date, time, and reason for the unmasking must be documented in the 
CR-[ADDRESS_1142116] articles, the following steps should be followed to maintain 
randomization codes:
1.Investigator or designee (documented on the Delegation Log) will consult th e
randomization scheme to obtain the test artic le assignment for that subject prior to 
dispensing
2.Investigator or designee will record the subject’s number on the appropriate line of 
the randomization scheme 
3.Investigator or designee will pull the appropri ate test articles from the study supply.  
All test articles that are opened, whether dispensed (placed/fit on eye or dispensed 
outside the clinical site) or not, must be recorded on the Test Article Accountability 
Log in the “Dispensed” section

3.The number and reason for unplanned replacements  
The Investigator will collect all unused test articles from the subjects at the end of the 
subject’s participation . Subject returned unused test articles must be separated from the 
clinical study inventory of un -dispensed test articles and must be labeled with the subject 
number and date of return.  Following final reconciliation of test articles by [CONTACT_2037], 
the Investigator or monitor will return all unused test articles toJJV.
If there is a discrepancy between the shipme nt documents and the contents, contact [CONTACT_823682] .
  
 
CR-[ADDRESS_1142119] not successfully dispensed due to lack of efficacy orsafety
For discontinued subjects, the Investigator will:
xComplete the current visit (scheduled or unscheduled)
xComplete the Final Evaluation, indicating the reason that the subject was 
discontinued from the study
xCollect used test article(s) (brought to the visit) from the subject and discard them, 
unless otherwise stated in Section 7.[ADDRESS_1142120] article(s) from the subject
An additional subject may be enrolled if a subject discontinues from the study prematurely. 
In cases where a subject is lost to follow -up, every possible effort must be made to contact 
[CONTACT_823683]/withdrawal.  The measures taken 
to follow up must be documented including two written attempts and a certified letter (or 
equivalent) as the final attempt. 
9.PRE -STUDY AND CONCOM ITANT INTERVENTION/M EDICATION  
Concomitant medications will be documented during screening and updated during the 
study.  Disallowed medications for this study include: Current habitual use of Prescription 
Only Medicines for dry eye or ocular discomfort, ocular steroids, or any medicatio n (RX 
or OTC) that would interfere with the clinical study (at the discretion of the investigator).
Concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_35443]: Current habitual use of Prescription 
Only Medicines for dry eye or ocular discomfort, ocular steroids, or any medication (RX 
or OTC) that would interfere with the clinical study (at the discretion of the investigator).
10.DEVIATIONS FROM THE PROTOCOL  
Investigator will notify study sponsor upon identification of a protocol deviation. Major 
protocol de viations must be reported to the sponsor  within 24 hours after discovery of the 
protocol deviation.  The Investigator will report  deviations per IRB/IEC requirements.  All 
deviations will be tracked and correcti ve actions implemented as appropriate. 
If it becomes necessary for the Investigator to implement a deviation toeliminate an 
immediate hazard to the trial subject, the Investigator may implement the deviation 
immediately without notification to the sponsor. Within [ADDRESS_1142121] notify a nd provide the rationale to the Sponsor and, as 
required, the IEC/IRB. 
The prescribed visit window for Visit 2 is 7 +/ -1 days from Visit 1 (Day 0) , and for Visit 
3 is 30+/-2 days from Visit 1.Subjects that comple te Visit 2 five (5) days or nine (9) days 
from Visit 1, or complete Visit 3 twenty -seven (27) or thirty -three (33) days from Visit 1,
will be categorized as a minor protoc ol deviation. Subjects completing Visit [ADDRESS_1142122] ([LOCATION_003]DE), or 
any SAE where the relationship to study agent cannot be ruled out , may result in stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35446].  In the event of a [LOCATION_003]DE or SAE, the Sponsor may 
unmask the treatment regimen for the subject(s) and will discuss this with the Investigator 
before any further subjects are enrolled.
The Sponsor will determine when a study will be stopped.  The Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_823668]’s results are compromised.
JJVreserves the right to terminate the study at any time for any reason.  Additionally, the 
IEC/IRB reserves the right to terminate the study if an unreasonable risk is determined.  
The study can be terminated by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_823669], if in their opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], after a discussion with JJV, it is 
determined that it would be unwise to continue at the clinical site.   
JJV(and the IEC/IRB and DMC, if applicable) will evaluate all adverse events.  If it is 
determined that a n adverse event presents an unreasonable risk, the investigation, or that 
part of the investigation presenting the ri sk, will be terminated, as soon as possible.
Should the study be terminated (eithe r prematurely or as scheduled), the Investigator will 
notify the IEC/IRB and Regulatory Authority as required by [CONTACT_35512].
12.PROCEDURE FOR HANDLI NG PRODUCT QUALITY C OMPLAINTS  
A Product Quality Complaint (PQC) refers to any written, electronic, or oral 
communication that alleges deficiencies relate d to the identity, quality, durability, 
reliability, safety, effectiveness or performanc e of test articles after they have been relea sed 
for clinical trial use.  
Potential complaints may come from a variety of sources including but not limited to 
subjects, clinical research associates (CRA), clinical operations managers (COM), medical 
monitors, and site personnel, etc. The following a re not considered PQCs :
xSubject satisfaction inquiries reported vi a “Subjective Questionnaires” and “Patient 
Reported Outcomes (PRO)”
xClinical test articles that are stored improperly or damaged after receipt at the 
investigational site
xArtificial tear replacements that occur due to loss/run out
xDamage deemed by [CONTACT_288795] f to be caused by [CONTACT_288796], 
and not indicative of a quali ty deficiency, only in situations where there is no 
deficiency alleged by [CONTACT_171189] [ADDRESS_1142123] 
be recorded in the EDC system, which will tr igger an automatic email notification to the 
 
CR-6328 v4.0 
Page 34 of 94 JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
appropriate COM/CRA and Clinica l QA representative. In cases where the EDC system in 
use is not configured to send automatic notifications or when an EDC system is not used, 
the COM/CRA is responsible for notifying Clinical QA upon discovery that a PQC has 
occurred.  
Upon receipt of the EDC notification, the C OM/CRA will contact [CONTACT_19568]:
xDate the complaint was received/recorded in the EDC System (Date of Sponsor 
Awareness)
xWho received the complaint
xStudy number
xClinical site information (contact [CONTACT_2300], site ID, telephone number)
xLot numbe r(s)
xUnique Subject Identifier(s)
xIndication of who first observed complaint (site personnel or subject)
xOD/OS indication, along with whether thedrops wereinserted
xAny related AE number ,if applicable
xDetailed complaint description (scheduled/unscheduled visit, symptoms, resolution 
of symptoms, etc.)
xEye Care Provider objective (sli t lamp) findings if applicable
xConfirmation of product availability for return (and tracking information, if 
available), or rationale if product is not available for return 
Once a complaint is received, it will b e assessed by [CONTACT_19569], CRA, or trained site 
personnel to determine if it is an Adverse Ev ent/Serious Adverse Event (AE/SAE).  If the 
complaint results in an AE/SAE, the COM/ CRA, or trained site personnel will follow 
Section 13of this protocol. If the AE/SAE was po tentially the result of a product quality 
related deficiency, these procedures also applies and will be executed in parallel.  
In some ca ses, a PQC form may be generated in EDC by [CONTACT_35514].  In this event, the 
PQC forms will be marked “Intentionally Left Bl ank” or “ILB”.  Justification for ILB must 
be documented.
13.ADVERSE EVENTS  
13.1. Definitions and Classifications  
Adverse Event (AE) –An AE is “any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease 
or injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, 
users or other persons, whether or not related to the investigational medical device. 
Note 1 to entry: This definition includes events related to the investigational medical 
device or the comparator.
Note 2 to entry: This definition includes events related to the procedures involved.
Note 3 to entry: For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to

event, a significant persistent or permanent change, impairment, damage, or 
disruption to the subject’s body)
xIs a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or
xRequires intervention to prevent permanent damage (the u se of the test article 
resulting in a condition which requires medical or surgical intervention to preclude 
permanent impairment of the body struct ure or a body function).  Important medical 
events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or requ ire hospi[INVESTIGATOR_91403], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient or subject an d may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outco mes listed in the above definition

Non-Significant Adverse Events –Those conditions that are usually asymptomatic and 
usually do not warrant discontin uation (temporary or permanent) of the test article.  
However, the Investigator may choose to treat as a precautionary measure.  
Diagnoses and conditions that are considered Ocular Non -Significant Adverse Events 
include, but not limited to the following:
xNon-signifiant Infiltrative Event (NSIE)
xPapi[INVESTIGATOR_823670] (SPK)

which necessitates temporary discontinuation of the drops <[ADDRESS_1142125] (ADE) –An ADE is an “adverse event related to the use of an 
investigational medical device.
Note 1 to entry: This definition includes adverse events resulting from insufficient or 
inadequate instructions for use, deployment, implantation, installation, or operation, or 
any malfunction of the invest igational medical device.
Note 2 to entry: This definition includes any event resulting from use error or from 
intentional misuse of the investigational medical device.”[ADDRESS_1142126] (UADE) –Any serious adverse effect on health or 
safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, the test
article, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or 
degree of incidence in the investigational plan, Investigator’s Brochure or protocol, or any 
other unanticipated serious problem  associated with the test article that relates to the rights, 
safety and welfare of subjects.
13.2. Assessing Adverse Events  
In conjunction with the medical monitor, the In vestigator will evaluate adverse events to 
ensure the events are categorized correctly.  Elements of categorization will include:
xSeriousness/Classifications (see definition in Section 13.1)
xCausality or Relatedness –i.e. the relationship between the test articl e, study 
treatment or study procedures and the a dverse event (not related; unlikely related; 
possibly related; related -see definition in Section 13.2.1 )
 
CR-6328 v4.0 
Page 37 of 94 JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
xAdverse Event Severity –Adverse event severity is used to assess the degree of 
intensity of the adverse event (mild; moderate; severe for all events -see definition 
in Section 0)
xOutcome –not recovered or not resolved ;recovering or resolving ;recovered or 
resolved with sequelae ;recovered or resolved ;death related to adverse event ;
unknown
xActions Taken –none; temporarily discontinued ; permanently discontinued; other
13.2.1. Causality Assessment  
Causality Assessment –A determination of the relationship between an adverse event and 
the test article. The test article relationship for each adverse event should be determined by 
[CONTACT_093] u sing these explanations:
xNot Related -An adverse event that is not related to the use of the test article, study 
treatment or study procedures
xUnlikely Related –An adverse event for which an alternative explanation is more 
likely, e.g. concomitant treatment, concomitan t disease(s), or the relationship of 
time suggests that a causal relationship is not likely
xPossibly Related –An adverse event that might be due to the use of the test article, 
or to the study treatment or study procedures . An alternative explanation, e.g. 
concomitant treatment, concom itant disease(s), is inconclusive.  The relationship in 
time is reasonable.  Therefore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded
xRelated –An adverse event that is listed as a possible adver se effect (device) or 
adverse reaction (drug) and cannot be reas onably explained by [CONTACT_376706], e.g. concomitant treatment of concomitant disease(s).  The relationship 
in time is very suggestive, e.g. it is confirmed by [INVESTIGATOR_5328] -challenge and re -challenge
13.2.2. Severity Assessment  
Severity Assessment –A qualitative assessment of the degr ee of intensity of an adverse 
event as determined by [CONTACT_653830]/her by [CONTACT_423].  The 
assessment of severity is made irrespective of test ar ticle, study treatment or study 
procedure relationship or seriousness of the event and should be evaluated according to the 
following scale:
xMild –Event is noticeable to the subject, but  is easily tole rated and does not 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities
xModerate –Event is bothersome, possible requiring additional therapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities
xSevere –Event is intolerable, necessitates additi onal therapy or alteration of therapy 
and interferes with the subject’ s daily activities
13.3. Documentation and Follow -Up of Adverse Events  
The recording and documenting of adverse events (ocular and non -ocular) begins when the 
subjects are exposed to the test article, study treatment or study procedure.  Adverse events 
reported before the use of test article, start of stud y treatment, or study procedures will be 
recorded as medical history. However, if th e condition deteriorates at any time during the 
study it will be recorded and reported as an AE. Untoward medical events report ed after 
the subject’s exit from the study will be rec orded as adverse events at the discretion of the 
Investigator.
 
CR-[ADDRESS_1142127] and in the eCRFs. He/she will complete the Adverse Event /eCRF.  
Complete descriptions of all a dverse events must be availa ble in the subject record. All 
Adverse Events including local and systemic reac tions not meeting the criteria for “serious 
adverse events” shall be captured on t he appropriate case report form or electronic data 
system. All adverse events occurring while th e subject is enrolled in the study must be 
documented appropriately regardless of relationship.  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to maintain documentation of each reported adverse 
event. All adverse events will be followe d in accordance with applicable licensing 
requirements.  Such documentation will include the following:
xAdverse event (diagnosis not symptom)
xDrawings or photographs (where app ropriate) that detail the finding (e.g., size, 
location, and depth, etc.) 
xDate the clinical site was notified 
xDate and time of onset
xDate and time of resolution
xAdverse event classification, severity, and relationship to test articles, as applicable
xTreatment regimen instituted, including c oncomitant medications prescribed, in 
accordance with applicable licensing requirements
xAny referral to another health care provider if needed
xOutcome, ocular damage (if any)
xLikely etiology
xBest corrected visual acuity at the discovery of the event and upon conclusion of 
the event
In addition, if an infiltrate(s) is present, he/she will complete the Corneal Infiltrate 
Assessment eCRF.  Where necessary, a culture of  the corneal lesion will be collected to 
determine if t he infection is microbial in nature.  If cultures are collected, the date of culture 
collection and laboratory utilized will be recorded. 
Changes in the severity of an AE shall be documented to allow an assessment of the 
duration of the event at each lev el of intensity to be performed.  Adverse events 
characterized as intermittent require docu mentation of the onset and duration of each 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Changes in the assessment of relationship to the Test Article shall also be clearly 
documented.
Subjects who pr esent with an adverse event shall be followed by [CONTACT_737], within 
licensure, until all signs and symptoms have returned to pre -treatment status, stabilized, or 
been satisfactorily resolved.  If further treatment beyond licensure is required, the pa tient 
will be referred to the appropriate health care provider.  The Investigator will use his/her 
clinical judgment as to whether a subject reporting with an a dverse event will continue in 
the study.  If a subject is discont inued from the study, it will b e the responsibility of the 
Investigator to record the reason for disconti nuation.  The Investigator will also document 
the adverse event appropriately and complete the Adverse Event eCRF. Any subjects with 
ongoing adverse events related to the test articl e, study treatment or study procedures, as 
of the final study visit date, should be followe d to resolution of the adverse event or until 
referral to an appropriate health care provide r, as recommended by [CONTACT_737]. Non -
 
CR-[ADDRESS_1142128] article, study treatment, or study 
procedures may be recorded as “ongoing” without further follow -up.
13.4. Reporting Adverse Events  
The Investigator will notify the Sponsor of an adverse event by e -mail, facsimile, or 
telephone as soon as possible and no later than 24 hours from discovery for any serious 
/significant adverse events, and 2 days from discovery for any non -significant adverse 
event.  In addition, a written report will be submitted by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_823671]/I RB according to their requirements (Section 13.4.2 ).  The report will comment 
whether or not the adverse event was considered to be related to the t est article, study 
treatment or study procedures.
13.4.1. Reporting Adverse Events to Sponsor  
Serious/Significant Adverse Events
The Investigator will inform the sponsor of all se rious/significant adverse events occurring 
during the study period as soon as possibl e by e -mail, fax, or telephone, but no later than 
24 hours following discovery of the event.  The Investigator is obligated to pursue and 
obtain information requested by [CONTACT_823685]. All subjects experie ncing a serious/significant adve rse event must be followed up 
and all outcomes must be reported.
When medically necessary, the Investigator may break the randomization code to 
determine the identity of the treatment that the subject received.  The Sponsor and study 
monitor should be notified prior to unmasking the test articles.
In the event of a serious/significant adverse event, the Investigator must:
xNotify the Sponsor immediately
xObtain and maintain in the subject’s records all pertinent medical information and 
medical judgment for colleagues who a ssisted in the treatment and follow -up of the 
subject
xProvide the Sponsor with a complete case history which includes a statement as to 
whether the event was or was not related to the use of the test article
xNotify the IEC/IRB as required by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB reporting procedure according to 
national regulations
Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE)
In the event of an Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE), the Investigator
will submit a report of the UADE to the Sponsor and IEC/IRB as soon as possible, but no 
later than [ADDRESS_1142129] report the results of the 
evaluation to FDA, the IEC/IRB and participating Investigators within [ADDRESS_1142130].
Non-Serious Adverse Events
All non -serious adverse events, including non -serious adverse device effects, will be 
reported to the sponsor by [CONTACT_35521] 2 days from discovery.
 
CR-6328 v4.0 
Page 40 of 94 JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
13.4.2. Reporting Adverse Events to the Responsible IEC/IRB and Health Authorities  
Adverse events that meet the IEC/IRB requirements for reporting must be reported within 
the IEC/IRB’s written guidelines. Each clinical site will refer to and follow any guidelines 
set forth by [CONTACT_19581]/IRB. Each clinical site will refer to and follow any 
guidelines set for th by [CONTACT_19582].
The Sponsor will report applicable Adverse Events  to the local health authorities according 
the written guidelines, including reporting timelines. 
13.4.3. Event of Special Interest  
None .
13.5. Reporting of Pregnancy  
Subjects reporting pregnancy (by [CONTACT_6270] -report) during the course of the study will be 
discontinued after the event is recorded as an  Adverse Event.  Once discontinued, pregnant 
participants and their fetuses will not be  monitored for study related purposes.  At the 
Investigator’s discretion, the study participant may be followed by [CONTACT_615574]. However, this data will  not be collected as part of the clinical study database.  
Pregnant participants are not discontinued from contact [CONTACT_823686], but due to ge neral concerns relating to pregnancy and contact [CONTACT_19584].  
Specifically, pregnant women are discontinued due to fluctuations in refractive error and/or 
visual acuity that occur secondary to systemic hormonal changes, and not due to unforeseen 
health risks to the mother or fetus.
14.STATISTICAL METHODS  
14.1. General Considerations  
Statistical Analysis will be undertaken by [CONTACT_3433] e sponsor or under the authority of the sponsor. 
A general description of the statistical methods to  be implemented in this clinical trial is 
outlined below. More details will be provided in the stand -alone St atistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP). The SAP will be finalized and signed prior to the database lock.
All data summaries and statistical anal yses will be performed using the SAS software 
Version 9.4or higher10.Throughout the analysis of data, th e results for each subject/eye 
will be used when available for su mmarization and statistical analysis.  
Summary tables (descriptive statistics and/or frequency tables) will be provided for all 
baseline var iables, efficacy variables and safety variables as appropriate.  Continuous 
variables will be summarized with descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation [SD],
median, minimum and maximum). Frequency count and percentage of subjects or eyes 
within each category will be provided for categorical data.
14.2. Sample Size Justification  
The sample size was calculated to test fornon-inferiority of the Test relative to Control eye 
drops with respect to the ocular comfort score using VAS with a minimum powerof85%
and a two -sided type I error of 0.05. Assuming adifference between the Test and Control 
of [ADDRESS_1142131] deviation ( SD)of35, the estimated sample size for non -
 
CR-[ADDRESS_1142132] deviation u sed in the sample 
calculation was 35 in a VAS scale from 0 to 100 (35 = 10*(2.5 + 1)).      
The plan is to enroll 1 50eligible subjects (60 per arm )with a target completion of 112 (56 
per arm) .During the enrollment period, the subject dropout rate will be closely monitored, 
if unexpectedly high dropout rate is observed (>10%) in certain arm(s), the targeted total 
enrollment number might be increased accordingly in order to ensure a minimum of 56
subjects per group to complete the 1-month follow -up.
14.3. Analysis Populations  
Thefollowing analysis populations will be used in the analysis and presentation of the 
data.
Safety Population:
All subjects who were administered any test article excluding subjects who drop out prior 
to administering any test arti cle. At least one observation for safety endpoints should be 
recorded (e.g. slit lamp findings, ocular symptoms , etc.).
Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population:
All randomized subjects regardless of actual treatment and subsequent withdrawal from 
study or deviation from protocol. Subject will be analyzed as per randomized treatment.
Per-Protocol (PP) Population: 
All subjects who have successfully completed al l visits and did not substantially deviate 
from the protocol as determined by [CONTACT_20767] c ohort review committee prior to database lock. 
Justification of excluding subjects with protocol deviations from thePer-Protocol 
Population set will be documented in a memo to file. Per Protocol will be the primary 
analysis population.
14.4. Level of Statistical Significance  
All planned analysis will be conducted with an overall type I error rate of 5% .Unless 
otherwise specif ied, all statistical tests will be 2 -sided.
14.5. Primary Analysis  
Ocular Comfort (VAS) Score:
Ocular comfort scores will be analyzed using a linear mixed model for repeated measures 
to test for the difference between the Test and Control eye drop s.The regression model 
will inc lude treatment group (Test, Control), time (0, 7 -Day and 30 -Day) and group by [CONTACT_397056]; and invest igational site as random effect. Age and gender 
will be included in the model when appropriate. The correlation between measurements
from the same subject across time will be modeled using unstructured (UN) variance -
covariance matrix. If the estimation algorithm does notconve rge, then a Compound 
Symmetry matrix (CS) will be used. The log -likelihood ratio test will be used to test for the 
 
CR-[ADDRESS_1142133] and Roger method 11will be used to calculate the denominator degree of freedom.
Hypothesis Testing: 
The null and alternative hypotheses for non -inferiority of Test relative to Control are as 
follows:
ܪ଴:∆ ≤−20
ܪ஺:∆ >−20,
where ∆is the difference between treatment groups in mean change from baseline at 30-
Day follow -up (Test minus Control). The non -inferiority test will be based on the least
square mean change difference and corresponding 95% confidence interval from the final 
model .The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval will be compared to the 
non-inferiority margin of -20.If the lower bound is greater than -20,the null hypothesis 
will be rejected, and the Test will be considered non -inferior to Control .The primary 
analysis will be conducted on the Per-Protocol Population. As sensitivity analy siswill be 
conducted on the ITT Population.
14.6. Secondary  Analysis  
Corneal Staining (Grade 2 or higher) :
Corneal staining response using FDA grading scale (i.e. Grade 0 = None, Grade 1 = Trace, 
Grade 2 = Mild, Grade 3 = Moderate and Grade 4 = Severe) will be first categorized into a 
binary outcome as 1 if any grade 2 or higher corneal staining otherwise 0 .Events occurring 
during an unscheduled visit w ill be counted inthe subsequent visit. For example, if a
Grade 2 corn eal staining was reported at an unscheduled visit between Visit 1 and Visit 2, 
it would be counted in Visit 2.  Eyes with multiple reports will b e counted only once at 
each visit for the analysis purpose .The binary outcome will be then analyzed using a
generalized linear mixed model for binary data. The regression model will include 
treatment group (Test, Control), time (0, 7 -Day and 30 -Day) and group by [CONTACT_823687]; and investigati onal site and subject as random effects (G -side).
Baseline values ,age and gender will be included in the model as fixed covariates when 
appropriate. The correlation between measurements fr om the same subject/eye across time 
will be modeled using UN variance -covariance matrix (R -side). If the estimation algorithm 
does not converge, then a compound symmetry structure ( CS)will be used.  The Kenward 
and Roger method 11will be used to calculate the denominator degree of freedom.
Hypothesis Testing: 
The null and alternative hypotheses for no difference ofTest relative to Control are as 
follows:
ܪ଴:ܴܱ=1
ܪ஺:ܴܱ ≠1,
where ܴܱisodds ratio of having a Grade [ADDRESS_1142134] for no difference will be based on the estimated OR and 
corresponding 95% confidence inte rval from the final model. The null hypothesis will be 
rejected in favor of the alternative  if 1 does not fall with inthe 95% confidence interval of 
OR.The corneal staining analys is will be conducted on the Safety Population.
Overall Quality of Vision Score:
Overall quality of vision will be analyzed using the same statistical model described in the 
primary analysis. Comparisons betwee n Test and Control will be carried using t -tests on 
least square mean differences of change in quality of vision from baseline at [ADDRESS_1142135] reported Ocular symptoms (yes/No)
Reported ocular symptoms, problems or complaints (0 = No, 1 = Yes) at any visit will be 
analyzed using the same method descr ibed above for corneal staining. The reported ocular 
analysis will be conducted on the Safety Population.
14.7. Other Exploratory Analyses  
No exploratory analyses are planned for this study. Further analysis will be conducted at 
the discretion of the study r esponsible clinician at the end of the study if necessary. 
14.8. Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis is planned in this study. 
14.9. Procedure for Handling Missing Data and Drop -Outs  
Missing or spurious values will not be imputed as the number of missing values is expected 
to be low . The count of observed values will be included in the summary tables and listings. 
Subject dropout is expected to be one of the main reasons of missing data in this clinical 
trial. Past clinical trials don’t provide the evidence that subject dropout is systematic or not -
at-random. To evaluate the impact of missing data, asensitivity ana lysis will be conducted 
using multiple imputation methods.
14.10. Procedure for Reporting Deviations from Statistical Plan  
The analysis will be conducted according to that specified in theabove sections.  There are 
no known reasons for which it is planned to dev iate from these analysis methods.  If for 
any reason a change is made, the change will be documented in the study report along with 
a justification for the change.
15.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]/ARCHIVI NG 
15.1. Electronic Case Report Form/Data Collection  
The d ata for this study will be captured on electronic case report forms (eCRFs) using an

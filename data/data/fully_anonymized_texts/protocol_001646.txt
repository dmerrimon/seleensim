22.  BACKGROUND  
 
2.1  Disease  
Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a neoplastic disorder of unknown etiology characterized by [CONTACT_588941] a single immunoglobulin protein isotype (M-protein). It is estimated that 14,000 new cases of myeloma are diagnosed in the US each year
1 accounting for approximately 1% of all cancers, 
and 10-15% of all hematological malignancies2. The disease is twice as common in blacks as 
whites3. MM usually occurs in older individuals with a median age of [ADDRESS_775603]  of care for patients with recurrent lymphoma 
and, depending on the subtype and chemotherapy sens itivity, can result in cure or in prolonged 
remission.  2.2 Prognosis of myeloma 
 The overall median survival for patients with MM is 36 months, with stage I, II, and III patients surviving a median of >60, 41, and [ADDRESS_775604] 
been identified.  An elevated seru m level of beta-2 microglobulin (ß 2M), a component of the 
class I HLA molecule, is a powerful pr ognostic indicator of shortened survival5.  ß 2M is excreted 
by [CONTACT_588942] ß2M. The plasma cell labeling index (PCLI) identifies the percen tage of proliferating plasma cells in S-phase of the cell cycle 
and is a powerful independent predictor of progression and survival
6. An elevated serum lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) predicts an aggressi ve course with lymphoma-like features7. 
Translocations such as t(4,14) and t(14,16) confer poor prognosis8. Investigators have found that 
achieving a complete remission early in the dise ase may be important in  predicting long-term 
survival9,10.  Indeed, Kyle et al suggested that an objective response to standard therapy is by [CONTACT_588943]-term survivors11. Major controlled trials have confirmed this 
seminal observation even in the context on high-dose chemotherapy12. Based on those 
observations, the goal of achieving an early CR should allow patients to  sustain long-term 
survival and perhaps lead to a cure.  2.3  Rationale 
 
2.3.1 Treatment: Stem Cell Transplant and Mobilization 
 
Though more targeted and effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_588917] 10 years, multiple 
myeloma (MM) remains incurable
13,14. For newly diagnosed patients, treatment with high dose 
chemotherapy and stem cell transp lantation (PBSCT) has extended median survival from [ADDRESS_775605] transplant candidates received dexamethasone (Dex) 
based regimens. 15 However, PBSC harvests are not always  successful and still are associated 
with significant morbidity16. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_588918] G-CSF 
alone or in combination with high dose cyclophosphamide. Though a “successful” harvest 
usually describes a CD34+ yield of 2-5 x 106 cells/kg, the newer evidence for the efficacy of 
double autologous transplant would necessitate CD34+ collections closer to [ADDRESS_775606] of lenalidomide. 19 
The routine use of cyclophosphami de however is often complicated by [CONTACT_588944][INVESTIGATOR_602], hence, delaying the transplant and causing significant increase in 
morbimortality and costs.   Recently a new molecule, plerixafor (Mozobil™, Genzyme Corp.) a CXCR4 inhibitor has been 
FDA approved for use in combination with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells to the peripheral blood for collection and subsequent autologous transplantation in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and MM who fail prior mobilization attempts or w ho are at high risk of failure.  
The efficacy and safety of plerixafor in combination with G-CSF in NHL and MM were 
evaluated in two placebo-controlled studies. Patients were randomized to receive either plerixafor 0.24 mg/kg or placebo each evening prior to apheresis. All patients received G-CSF 10 micrograms/kg daily for four days prior to the first dose of plerixafor or placebo and prior to apheresis. Results from 302 patients with MM were analyzed. 
In the MM study, only 72 percent of patients who were mobilized with plerixafor and G-CSF 
collected ≥ 6 X 10
6 CD34+ cells/kg from the peripheral blo od in two or fewer apheresis sessions 
compared with 34 percent of patients who were mobilized with placebo and G-CSF (p <0.001). ). 
Of note only about 54% of pts reached target CD34+ collection after 1 pheresis, 78% after 2 pheresis sessions, 87% after [ADDRESS_775607])
 20. 
 Safety data for plerixafor in combination with G-CSF were obtained from 983 patients enrolled in 16 clinical studies (593 patients enrolled in  randomized Studies 1 and 2 plus 410 patients 
enrolled in 14 additional non-randomized studies). Patients were primarily tr eated with plerixafor 
at daily doses of 0.24 mg/kg SC. Median exposur e to plerixafor was two days (range one to 
seven days). 
The most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 10 percent) reported in patients who received plerixafor 
in conjunction with G-CSF that we re more frequent than in pa tients who received placebo were 
diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, injec tion site reactions, headache, ar thralgia, dizziness and vomiting. 
4Prescribing physicians and patients should be aware of the potential for tumor cell mobilization 
in leukemia patients, increased circulating leukocytes and decreas ed platelet counts, splenic 
enlargement, and fetal harm when administ ered to pregnant wo men. Plerixafor has a 
cumbersome dosing schedule:    GCSF is given for [ADDRESS_775608] dose of plerixafor 
then on each morning of apheresis. Plerixafor is  administered in the evening starting on day 5. 
Plerixafor should be given approx.  11 hours prior to the initiation of apheresis for up to 4 consecutive days. Dose modifications are required for renal impairment. Pts with a Cr CL < 50 
ml/min should have their plerixafor dose reduced by 1/3 to 0.16mg/kg not to exceed 27mg/day21.  
2.3.2 Treatment: Response and Outcomes  
A substantial body of data suggests that patients fare better if meaningful responses are achieved 
during therapy. Such evidence makes a case for the use of agents known to achieve an effective cell kill during stem cell mobilization and harvest, even if patients have just been subjected to a substantial amount of anti-myeloma therapy. Recent  studies, such as the French IFM [ADDRESS_775609] cyclophosphamide mob ilization regimen. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], included 22 
evaluable patients, whose prior th erapy consisted of six cycles of chemotherapy were mobilized. 
Patients received IV push bortezomib at 1.3 mg/m
2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 in combination with 
high-dose cyclophosphamide at 3 g/m2 on day 8. G-CSF was given for 10 consecutive days 
starting on day 9.  
2.5 Preliminary Findings (See Table Below)   
 
The number of CD34+ cells collected far exceeded the study goal of 10x106 cells/kg, a collection 
result typi[INVESTIGATOR_588919]/or G-CSF alone. Twenty-
two (100%) patients had more than adequate collections in a single day. Median CD34+ collection was 21x10
6 cells/kg in 1-5 collecti on days (range of 9.3-294.2 x 106). Mobilization 
with this regimen was not only robust but the mobilization window was highly predictable, eliminating the need for guess work in collection timing; furthermore, the amount of collection days was limited to only one day in the great majority of patients, thus suggesting that this regimen will allow efficient planning of phere sis sessions and will reduce the number of pheresis 
needed, ultimately reducing costs.  Noteworthy is  that all patients who began mobilization with 
less than a CR continued to respond positively to treatment, including one transition from nCR to CR and one from SD to PR. No patients progressed or moved to lower response categories. This suggests that this is the only regimen which contributes to tumor mass reduction, thus, improving ultimately outcomes. So far [ADDRESS_775610] protocol  mobilization. All showed typi[INVESTIGATOR_588920] 
5engraftment after CD34+ infusions. The median number of days to ANC recovery was 11 days 
(range 10-17). Platelet recovery median 18 days (range 13-24) 24.

through effects on SDF-1 where as CXCR4 is the target for plerixafor.  Data in mouse models shows the combination of G-CSF + Bortezomib is significantly better than either agent alone in terms of increasing the white blood count (WBC), colony-forming unit – granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM), and colony-forming unit – erythroid (CFU-E). The combination appears to be additive
26 . We can therefore conclude that the use of bortezomib for 
mobilization may offer a less cumbersome, safer and effective regimen.   2.6 Conclusions   
 Bortezomib in addition to high-dose cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) followed by G-CSF is a novel, well-tolerated and efficacious combination for stem cell mobilization in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). This regimen not only yi elds a high number of stem cells within a 
short collection time, but also provides the potential for further cytoreduction. Of particular 
6importance is that this regimen overcomes any in hibitory effect of lenalidomide, which is the 
most common induction regimen in MM. Our objectives , therefore, are to cri tically test this new 
mobilization regimen against standard of care (Cyclophosphamide and G-CSF) and a control 
group of Bortezomib and G-CSF in a prospective, ra ndomized fashion. This trial is of particular 
interest given the following issues:   
1) Consistency in number of collections required and predictability of the timing in stem cell collection when bortezomib is used.  
2) Potential benefit on engraftmen t and co-morbidities when a higher than average number 
of stem cell are infused  
3) Advantage of mega-mobilization in order to adequately cryopreserve for future use (in 
the relapse setting)  
4) Potential benefit in lenalidomide trea ted patients and high risk patients  
5) New biological insights in stem cell biology  
6) If this trial shows that bortezomib/GCSF is as good as cyclophosphamide/GCSF could potentially eliminate chemotherapy as mobiliz ing agent.  (Less toxicity in terms of 
myelosupression, renal/kidneys etc.)  
7) Not all patients with MM successfully collect with plerixafor and G-CSF alone.  This trial may show that adding bortezomib to plerixafor and G-CSF increases the chances of a successful collection.  
 Bortezomib, a recently approved 26S proteasome inhi bitor, appears to be effective even in 
patients with poor prognostic features for transpla nt such as del 13q14 and has been shown to be 
non-stem cell toxic. Our objective is to achieve ma ximum response before transplant as well as a 
successful mobilization and harv est of PBSCs, which we defined as at least 10 x 106 CD34+ 
cells/kg in under 2 leukapheresis procedures. 
 
Bortezomib also has activity in lymphoma and its use in stem cell mobilization may also be useful in this disorder.  Use of Peripheral Blood CD34 counts as a measure of stem cell mobilization and collection. The yield of a stem cell collection is determ ined by [CONTACT_588945]34, the volume of 
collection and   to a less er degree by a  number of other factors such as the instrument utilized for 
collection, the hematocrit, WBC and even serum albumin (see for example Hosing 2013, Ford 1998, Hollingsworth 1999). The peripheral blood CD34 on the first day of collection is the best measure of “mobilizing” efficiency and is widely  utilized (Hosing 2013) and will be the primary 
outcome measure for this study.

[CONTACT_24312], Inc., (Millennium) as a novel agent to treat human malignancies.  
7Bortezomib is currently approved by [CONTACT_588946] (US FDA) 
and it is registered in Europe for the treatment  of multiple myeloma patients who have received 
at least one prior therapy. 
  By [CONTACT_61670] a single molecular target, the proteasome, bortezomib affects multiple signaling pathways.  The anti-neoplastic effect of bortezo mib likely involves several distinct mechanisms, 
including inhibition of cell growth and survival  pathways, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition 
of expression of genes that control cellular adhesion, migration and angiogenesis.  Thus, the mechanisms by [CONTACT_588947], and 
the extent to which each affected pathway is criti cal to the inhibition of tumor growth could also 
differ.  Bortezomib has a novel pattern of cytotoxicity in National Cancer Institute (NCI) in vitro and in vivo assays (Adams et al., 1999).  In addition, bortezomib has cytotoxic activity in a 
variety of xenograft tumor models, both as a sing le agent and in combin ation with chemotherapy 
and radiation (Steiner et al., 2001; Teicher et al., 1999; Cusack et al., 2001; LeBlanc et al., 2002; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_149587]., 2002).  Notably, bort ezomib induces apoptosis in cells that over express bcl-2, a 
genetic trait that conf ers unregulated growth and resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics 
(McConkey et al., 1999).  Bortezomib is thought to be efficacious in multiple  myeloma via its inhibi tion of nuclear factor 
B (NF-B) activation, its atte nuation of interleukin-6 (IL-6)-mediated cell growth, a direct 
apoptotic effect, and possibly anti-angiogeni c and other effects (Hideshima et al., 2001). 
3.1.2     Nonclinical Pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic studies were conducted in the rat and cynomolgus 
monkey.  Upon intravenous (IV) bolus administration, bortezomib displays a rapid distribution 
phase (t½  <10 minutes) followed by a longer elimination phase (t½  5–15 hours).  Bortezomib 
has a large volume of distribution (range 5–50 L/kg).  The plasma PK profile is well described 
by a 2-compartment model. 
The pharmacodynamic action of bortezomib is well established and can be measured through an 
ex vivo assay (20S proteasome activity) (Light cap et al., 2000).  This assay was used to 
determine the duration of drug effect in lieu of the PK data in the early preclinical toxicology studies as well as to set a guide for dose escalation in humans.  Following dosing with bortezomib in the rat and cynomolgus monkey, pr oteasome inhibition in peripheral blood had a 
half-life less than 24 hours, with  proteasome activity returning to pretreatment baseline within 24 
hours in monkey and within 48 to 72 hours in ra t after a single dose of bortezomib.  Further, 
intermittent but high inhibition (>70%) of proteasome activity was better tolerated than sustained inhibition.  Thus, a twice-weekly clinical dosing regimen was chosen in order to allow return of proteasome activity towards baselin e between dose administrations. 
3.1.3 Nonclinical Toxic ity 
Single-dose IV toxicity studies were conducted with bortezomib in the mouse, rat, dog, and monkey to establish the single-dose maximum tolerated dose (MTD).  The MTDs were 0.25 
8mg/kg (1.5 mg/m2) and 0.067 mg/kg (0.8 mg/m2) in the [ADDRESS_775612] sensitive species, rat and 
monkey, respectively. 
 Repeat-dose multi-cycle toxicity studies of 3 and 6 months in the rat and 9 months in the monkey, each with 8-week recovery periods, were conducted to characterize the chronic toxicity 
of bortezomib when administered by [CONTACT_91820].  The MTD in the 6-month rat study was 0.10 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m
2) and the key target organs were the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tr act, hematopoietic and lymphoid sy stems.  The MTD in the 9-month 
monkey study was 0.05 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m2) and the key target organs were the GI tract, 
hematopoietic and lymphoid systems, peripheral nervous system, and kidney.  Full or partial reversibility was observed for each of the toxicities described to date.    In general, the nature of the toxicity of bortezo mib is similar across species , and target organs of 
toxicity in animals have been largely predictive of human toxicity.  The toxicity of bortezomib in animals is characterized by a steep dose-response with mortality seen at dosages above the MTD.  The cause of death at acutely lethal dosages is cons idered to be related to indirect cardiovascular 
(CV) effects of hypotension and vascular changes with secondary bradycardia and the cause of death in long-term studies has been attributed to  GI or hematologic toxi city.  The pharmacologic 
effects of bortezomib on the CV system have  been extensively characterized and have 
demonstrated that indirect eff ects on CV function occur only at acutely lethal dosages and are 
abrogated by [CONTACT_91821].  Additional detailed information regarding the nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology of bortezomib may be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
 3.1.[ADDRESS_775613] been treated with bortezomib, including 
patients treated through Millennium-sponsored clinical trials, Investigator-I nitiated Studies, the 
US NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), and with commercially available drug.  
Bortezomib has been commercially  available since 13 May 2003. 
 The overall goal of the Millennium phase 1 program was to determine the MTD and dose-
limiting toxicity (DLT) of bortezomib in a number of therapeutic settings  involving subjects with 
various advanced malignancies.  In a Phase I trial in patients with refractory hematologic 
malignancies, the MTD for a twice weekly for 4 weeks of a 42 day cycle was 1.04 mg/m
2/dose, 
with DLTs of thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, fatigue, and malaise (Orlowski et al., 2002).  The toxicity was greates t during the third and fourth weeks of therapy. In the 3-week 
schedule of bortezomib monotherapy (4 doses, given on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day treatment cycle), the DLT occurred at 1.56 mg/m
2/dose (3 subjects with Grade 3 diarrhea and 1 
with peripheral sensory neuropathy).  Theref ore, the MTD at this schedule was 1.3 mg/m2/dose.  
In a 35-day treatment cycle with 4 weekly doses of bortezomib monotherapy, the MTD was 1.6 
mg/m2/dose and DLT included hypotension, tachy cardia, diarrhea, and syncope.   
In phase 1 clinical studies, anti-tumor activ ity was reported in subjects with NHL, multiple 
myeloma, Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia, s quamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx, 
bronchoalveolar carcinoma of the lung, re nal cell carcinoma, and prostate cancer. 
9The safety and efficacy of bortezomib in subject s with multiple myeloma were investigated in 
two phase 2 clinical studies, studies M34100-024 (subjects  with first relapse)  (Jagannath et al, 
2004) and M34100-025 (subjects with second or greater relapse and re fractory to their last prior 
therapy) (Richardson et al, 2003).  In M [ZIP_CODE]-025, [ADDRESS_775614] 2 pr evious treatments received bortezomib, 1.3 mg/m2 
on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day treatment cycle. The European Group for Blood and Marrow 
Transplant (EBMT) response criteria , as described by [CONTACT_149617], (Blade et al., 1998) were utilized to 
determine disease response.  CRs were observed in 4% of subjects, with an additional 6% of patients meeting all criteria for CR but having a positive immunofixation test.  PR or better was observed in 27% of subjects, and the overall response rate (CR,  PR and minor response [MR] 
combined) was 35%.  Seventy percent of subjects experienced stable disease or better.    The phase 3 study (M34101-039) (Richardson et al , 2005), also referred to as the APEX study, 
was designed to determine whether bortezomib pr ovided benefit (time to progression [TTP], 
response rate, and survival) to patients with relapsed or refractory MM rela tive to treatment with 
high-dose dexamethasone.  The study was also designed to determine the safety and tolerability of bortezomib relative to high-dose dexamethasone, and whether treatment with bortezomib was associated with superior clinical benefit and quality of life re lative to high-dose dexamethasone. 
A total of 669 patients were en rolled and 663 patients receive d study drug (bortezomib: 331; 
dexamethasone: 332).  Patients randomized to bortezomib received 1.3 mg/m
2 I.V. push twice 
weekly on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 3-week cycle for up to eight treatment cycles as induction 
therapy, followed by 1.3 mg/m2 bortezomib weekly on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 5-week cycle 
for three cycles as maintenance therapy. Patie nts randomized to dexamethasone received oral 
dexamethasone 40 mg once daily on days 1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 to 20 of a 5-week cycle for up to four treatment cycles as i nduction therapy, followed by [CONTACT_149618] 40 mg once daily on 
days 1 to 4 followed of a 4-week cycle for five  cycles as maintenance therapy. The European 
Group for Blood and Marrow Transplant (EBMT) response criteria, as described by [CONTACT_149617] 
(Blade et al., 1998) were utilized to determin e disease response.  There was a 78% increase in 
TTP for the bortezomib arm. Median TTP wa s 6.2 months for the bortezomib arm and 3.5 
months for the dexamethasone arm ( P<.0001). CR (complete response) + PR (partial response) 
was 38% with bortezomib vs. 18% with dexamethasone ( P.0001). CR was 6% with bortezomib 
vs.  1% with dexamethasone (P <.0001). The CR + nCR rate was 13% with bortezomib vs. 2% 
with dexamethasone. In patients who had received only one prior line of treatment (bortezomib: 
132; dexamethasone: 119), CR + PR was 45% with bortezomib vs. 26% with dexamethasone (P=.0035). With a median 8.3 months of follow- up, overall survival was significantly longer 
(P=.0013) for patients on the bortezomib arm vs. patients on the dexamethasone arm. The 
probability of survival at one year was 80% for the bortezomib arm vs. 66% for the dexamethasone arm, which represented a 41% decrea sed relative risk of d eath in the first year 
with bortezomib (P =.0005). In patients who had received on ly one prior line of treatment, the 
probability of survival at one year was 89% for the bortezomib arm vs. 72% for the dexamethasone arm, which represented a 61% decrea sed relative risk of d eath in the first year 
with bortezomib (P =.0098). Updated response rates and survival data were reported for M34101-
039 (Richardson ASH, 2005). The updated CR (complet e response) + PR (partial response) rate 
was 43% with bortezomib. The CR + nCR rate was 16% with bortezomib. With a median 22 months of follow-up, overall surv ival was significantly longer fo r patients on the bortezomib arm 
10vs. patients on the dexamethasone arm. The median overall survival was 29.8 months (95% CI: 
23.2, not estimable) for the bortezomib arm vs. 23.7 months (95% CI: 18.7, 29.1) for the 
dexamethasone arm (hazard ratio = 0.77, P= 0.0272). The probability of survival at one year was 80% for the bortezomib arm vs. 67% for the dexamethasone arm ( P=0.0002).    
 Studies using bortezomib  as monotherapy and in combination with other chemotherapy agents 
are continuing.    3.2 High-dose Cyclophosphamide (CYTOXAN)
 
3.2.1 Scientific Background  
  Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent that pr events cell division primarily by [CONTACT_12783]-linking 
DNA strands. The cell continues to synthesize ot her cell constituents (R NA and protein), an 
imbalance occurs and the cell dies. Cyclophos phamide is considered cell cycle phase non-
specific. Cyclophosphamide is bio-transformed principally in the live r to active alkylating 
metabolites that cross-link to tumor-cell DNA.  3.3         G-CSF (NEUPOGEN)  
 3.3.1  Scientific Background   
 NEUPOGEN is the trademark name [INVESTIGATOR_8178] G-CSF also known as Filgrastim, a human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. It is a 175 amino acid protein manufactured by [CONTACT_10173]. NEUPOGEN is produced by [CONTACT_539883]  (E. coli) bacteria into which has been 
inserted the human granulocyte co lony-stimulating factor gene.  
 Colony stimulating factors are glycoproteins wh ich act on hematopoietic cells by [CONTACT_588948], differentiation commitment, and some end-cell functional activa tion. NEUPOGEN regulates the produc tion of neutrophils from 
the bone marrow. NEUPOGEN
® is indicated for the mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor 
cells into the peripheral blood for collection by [CONTACT_74886]. Mobilization allows for the 
collection of increased numbers of progenitor cells capable of engraftment compared with collection by [CONTACT_588949]. After myeloablative 
chemotherapy‚ the transplantation of an increased number of progenitor cells can lead to more rapid engraftment‚ which may result in  a decreased need for supportive care. 
NEUPOGEN
® is a sterile‚ clear‚ colorless‚ preservative-free liquid for pare nteral administration 
containing Filgrastim at a specific activity of 1.0 ± 0.6 x 108 U/mg (as measured by a cell 
mitogenesis assay).  The product is available in single use vials and prefilled syringes. 25 
 
3.4         Plerixafor  
 
Plerixafor (Mozobil), a hematopoietic stem cel1 mobilizer, is indicated in combination with 
grulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to  mobilize hematopoietic stem cells to the 
peripheral blood for collection a nd subsequent autol ogous transplantation in patients with non-
Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma.  Pl erixafor acts by [CONTACT_588950] 
11between SDF-1 (stem cell derived factor 1) a nd CXCR4 (chemokine receptor type 4) which 
abrogates the main force binding CD34 cells to the bone marrow stroma.  Plerixafor has been 
shown to enhance stem cell harvest yield when used in combination with G-CSF as opposed to G-CSF alone in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma.

6. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
6.[ADDRESS_775620] received primary induction therapy rev or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Up to 198 patients will be  enrolled. Effective January 16, 2013, Arm B is 
closed to further enrollment due to futility. Effective July 9, 2015, Arm C is closed to further enrollment due to futility. Patients eligible fo r treatment will be randomized to one of the 
following mobilization regimens:  
 
A. Arm A: 
 Bortezomib at 1.3 mg/m
2 IVP on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 in combination with high-dose 
cyclophosphamide at 2.0 g/m2 on day 8. G-CSF is given for ten (+/- two) consecutive 
days starting on day 9 at a dose of 10 micrograms/kg/day. Pheresis will commence once absolute neutrophil count  (ANC) of 1.0 is reached*. 
14B. Arm B: This Arm is closed to further accrual.  
 Bortezomib  at 1.3 mg/m2 IVP on days 1, 4, 8 and 11. G-CSF is started on day 9 at a 
dose of 10 micrograms/kg/day. Pheresis colle ction is started on Day 15 or whenever 
the total white blood cell count is > 50,000 / μl, whichever occurs first*. G-CSF is 
continued until pheresis goal has been met.  
 
C. Arm C: This Arm is closed to further accrual.  
High-dose cyclophosphamide at 2.0 g/m2 on day 1. G-CSF is given for ten (+/- two) 
consecutive days starting on day 2 at a dose of 10 micrograms/kg/day. Pheresis will 
commence once ANC of 1.0 is reached*. 
 
      D.   Arm D:  
G-CSF is given for ten (+/- two) consecuti ve days starting on day 1 at a dose of 
10 micrograms/kg/day. Plerixafor is give n on day 4, approximately 11 hours prior 
to stem cell collection attempt on Day 5.  Both G-CSF and plerixafor are 
continued daily until collection is comple te. Pheresis will commence for everyone 
on Day 5 regardless of ANC status. 
 D. Arm E: 
 Bortezomib at 1.3 mg/m2 IVP on days 1, 4, 8 and 11. G-CSF is given for ten (+/- 
two) consecutive days starting on da y 9 at a dose of 10 micrograms/kg/day. 
Plerixafor is given on day 12, approximately [ADDRESS_775621] is at the discretion of the primary physic ian/ Principal Investigator.  
 
* In study centers that have the equipment capability, ANC > 1.0 will not be the benchmark to start collection. Instea d, peripheral blood CD34
+ cells/ ml will be determined by [CONTACT_588954] a subject’s blood sample on each morning of proposed collection and will be the primary 
determinant of whether stem cell collection is a ttempted for the day.  A minimum requirement of 
≥ 20 x 106 CD34+ cells/ml will be required to start stem cell collection.  If the subject fails to 
reach this benchmark, stem cell collection for the day will be aborted for futility and the patient 
will return the next day for reevaluation.  If the subject fails to achieve an adequate peripheral blood CD34
+ cell count after 14 days of G-CSF on Arms  A and C, or 10 days of G-CSF on Arm 
B, D and E, the collection attempt will be deem ed a failure and the patient will be taken off 
study. HPC analysis will not be used to determine eligibility to start stem  cell collection. In study 
centers without ready access to flow cytometry analysis of CD 34+ cell content of peripheral 
blood, ANC will be the sole marker to start stem cell collection. 
 
6.2 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_588922] 10 patients are accrued in each arm and the rule will not allow more than 4 failures in the 10 accrued patie nts per arm.  Failure is defined as:  If > 40% 
15of patients fail to collect the target CD34+ cells in two or less collections in any arm, then the 
arm will be terminated. 
Due to futility, Arm B is closed to further accrual effective January 16, 2013. Arm C is closed to 
further accrual effective July 9, 2015. For arms A and C, three out of four subjects randomized to 
mobilize sufficiently. Accrual will conti nue on Arms A and D and E as planned. 
 After 10 patients are evaluated in  each arm we are going to attemp t to establish the predictive 
value and correlation of HPC and ANC in each arm.  We will later use that data to better define the optimal time for commencing leukapheresis. 
 
6.3  Risks of Insufficient Stem Cell Collection 
 
The risk of insufficient stem cell collection is a risk associated with any mobilization program.  
Usually a patient who fails to mobilize with one strategy will succeed at a second attempt by [CONTACT_1583] a medication called Mozobil (plerixafor). Failure to mobilize stem  cells successfully will 
preclude the performance of an au tologous stem cell tran splant.  In this protocol, patients who 
fail any of the three mobilization arms will be o ffered standard of care mobilization plerixafor.

At the time of study withdrawal or completion of the study, all st udy procedures outlined for the 
End of Treatment visit must be completed.  The primary reason for a patient’s withdrawal from 
the study is to be recorded in the source documents.  The duration of the study include s a 21-day treatment schedule, an end of study visit, and a 
specified period time for survival follow up.    
 
6.[ADDRESS_775625].  Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed for life, unless they withdraw consent.  
7. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS 
 
Patients will be evaluated for toxicity throughout treatment.  Doses of study medications will be 
held for neuropathy toxicity Grade  [ADDRESS_775626] 
occurred after the previous dose(s).  Toxicities are to be assessed according to the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0.   All previously established or new toxicities observed any time, w ith the exception of neuropathic 
pain and peripheral sensory neuropat hy, are to be managed as follows: 
 If the patient experiences febrile neutropenia,  a Grade 4 hematologic toxicity (including a 
platelet count <25   10
9/L) or any Grade 3 non-hematologic toxi city considered by [CONTACT_588955], then drug is to be held. 
 For hematologic toxicities, bortezomib is to be held for up to 2 weeks until the patient has a hemoglobin value of > 9.0 g/dL , platelet value of ≥ 50,000/mm
3 (≥ 30,000 for patients 
with bone marrow biopsy displaying >50% involvement by [CONTACT_557336]), and neutrophil 
18value of ≥1500 cells/mm3 (≥1000 for patients with bone marrow biopsy displaying >50% 
involvement by [CONTACT_557336]) 
 For non-hematologic toxicities, bortezomib is  to be held for up to 2 weeks until the 
toxicity returns to Grade 1 or better. 
 
No dose modifications or reductions will be made. Subjects are anticipated to receive four doses 
in each respective arm. If the four doses are interrupted at any point, no further attempts to re-dose will be made.   Patients who experience bortezomib-related neuropathic pain and/or peripheral sensory neuropathy are to be managed as presented in Table 7.1 Management of Patients with 
bortezomib Related Neuropathic Pain and/or Peripheral Sensory or Motor Neuropathy. Once the dose is reduced for peripheral neuropathy, the dose may not be re-escalated.

Schedule change: Schedule change from bortezomib twice per week (Days 1, 4, 8 and 11 on a Q3W cycle)       to once 
19per week (Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 on a Q5W cycle).  If the treatment schedule is alread y once weekly, then it should 
remain once weekly. 
Patients with mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin < 1.5  ULN) do not require a starting dose 
adjustment.  Please note that patients with bilirubin levels ≥  1.5  ULN are excluded from 
enrollment in this protocol.  If a patient develo ps moderate or severe hepatic impairment with 
bilirubin ≥  Grade 2 ( > 1.[ADDRESS_775627]) while on study, the investigator should hold bortezomib 
until the toxicity returns to < Grade 2. Restarting bortezomib at the next lower dose level could 
be considered at the Investigator’s discretion and following exclusion of bortezomib-induced liver impairment and careful consideration of live r disease due to other cau ses, such as, but not 
limited to, active infection and multiple myeloma-related liver disease.  The neurotoxicity-directed questi onnaire (see Appendix E) is a us eful tool for determining the 
presence and intensity of neuropathic pain an d/or peripheral neuropathy from the patient’s 
perspective.  Neuropathic symptoms are more prominent than abnormalities on the clinical examination.  After the patient completes th e neurotoxicity-directed  questionnaire, the 
questionnaire should be reviewed to assist with the evaluation of the onset and intensity of 
peripheral neuropathy and other ne urotoxicities that may possibly require intervention or dose 
modification. 
 
8.  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS   
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The 
investigator will be required to provide appropr iate information concerning any findings that 
suggest significant hazards, contraindications, side effects, or pr ecautions pertinent to the safe 
use of the drug under investigation.  Safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_207469], as well as by [CONTACT_588956], x-rays, el ectrocardiographs, etc.

8.4.3Reporting of SAE to Millennium 
Adverse events (AEs) may be spontaneously report ed by [CONTACT_5363]/or  in response to an 
open question from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination, or other diagnostic procedures.  AEs which are seri ous must be reported to Millennium. 
Pharmacovigilance (or designee) from first dose of bortezomib up to and including [ADDRESS_775633] dose of bortezomib.  When possible, signs a nd symptoms indicating a 
common underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event.  Any SAE that occurs at any time after completion of bortezo mib treatment or after the designated follow-up 
period that the investigator-sponsor  and/or sub-investig ator considers to be related to any study 
drug must be reported to the Millennium Pharma covigilance (or designee).  Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_151171] (e.g., surgery wa s performed earlier or later than planned).  
All SAEs should be monitored until they are resolv ed or are clearly determined to be due to a 
patient’s stable or chronic conditi on or intercurrent illness(es). 
This is an investigator-initiat ed study.  The principal investigator, [CONTACT_588980], (who 
may also sometimes be referred to as the investigator-sponsor), is conducting the study and acting as the sponsor. Therefore, th e legal/ethical obligations of th e principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_588925] a sponsor and those of an investigator. 
 
Investigator-sponsor must report all serious advers e events (SAE) regardle ss of relationship with 
any study drug or expectedness to Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee) as soon as 
possible, but no later than 5 calendar days of th e investigator-sponsor’s observation or awareness 
of the event.  In the event that this is a multis ite study, the investigator-sponsor is responsible to 
ensure that the SAE reports are sent to Mill ennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee) from all 
sites participating in the study.  Sub-investigators must report all SAEs to the investigator-
sponsor so that the investigator-sponsor can meet his/her foregoing reporting obligations to 
Millennium Pharmacovigilance, unless otherwise agreed between the inve stigator-sponsor and 
sub-investigator(s).  Millennium Pharmacovi gilance (or designee) may request follow-up 
27information to a reported SAE, which the inve stigator-sponsor will be responsible for providing 
to Millennium Pharmac ovigilance (or designee). 
The SAE report must include event term(s), seri ous criteria, and the investigator-sponsor’s or 
sub-investigator’s determination of  both the intensity of the event(s) and the relationship of the 
event(s) to study drug administration. 
Intensity for each SAE, including any lab abnormality, will be determined by [CONTACT_431260], version used at your inst itution, as a guideline, whenever possible.  The criteria are 
available online at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html.  
Relationship to all study drugs for each SAE will be determined by [CONTACT_093]-sponsor or 
sub-investigator by [CONTACT_588958] n: Is there a reasonable possibility that the 
AE is associated with  the study drug(s)?  
Investigator-sponsor must also provide Millennium with a copy of  all communicatio ns related to 
the Study or Drug with the applicable regul atory authority, includi ng, but not limited to, 
telephone conversation logs, as soon as possible but no later th an 5 calendar days of that

9. PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
  
9.1  Clinical Pharmacology 
 
9.1.1 Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics
 
The clinical pharmacology char acterization of bortezomib  has been determined from phase 1 
studies in subjects with solid tumors and hematological malignancies, and confirmed in phase 2 studies in subjects with multiple myeloma. 
Bortezomib  demonstrates multi-compartmental pharmacokinetics. Following intravenous 
administration of 1.0 mg/m
2 and 1.3 mg/m2 dose, the mean first-dose maximum observed plasma 
concentrations of bortezomib  were 57 and 112 ng/mL, respectively in 11 patients with multiple 
myeloma and creatinine clearance values >50 mL/min participating in a pharmacokinetics study.  
In subsequent doses, mean maximum observed pl asma concentrations ranged from 67 to 106 
ng/mL for the 1.0 mg/m2 dose and 89 to 120 ng/mL for the 1.3 mg/m2 dose.  The mean 
elimination half-life of bortezomib  upon multiple dosing ranged from [ADDRESS_775636] dose.  Mean Total Body Clearances 
were 102 and 112 L/h following the first dose for doses of 1.0 mg/m2 and 1.3 mg/m2, 
respectively, and ranged from 15 to 32 L/h fo llowing subsequent doses for doses of 1.0 and 
1.3 mg/m2, respectively.  Clinical experience has shown that the change in clearance does not 
result in overt toxicity from accumulation in this multidose regimen in humans. In subjects with advanced malignancies, th e maximum pharmacodynamic effect (inhibition of 
20S activity) occurred within 1-hour post dose.  At the therapeutic dose of 1.3 mg/m
[ADDRESS_775637] dose was approximately 
61%.  The time course of proteasome inhibition in subjects is characterized  by [CONTACT_588960], followed by [CONTACT_588961] 6 to 24 hours to within 50% of the pretreatment activity.  On the Day 1, 4, 
8, and 11 schedule, variable (10%–30%) levels of  proteasome inhibition have been observed at 
next scheduled dosing.  In theory, this advantage allows cells to recover proteasome activity for normal cellular housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_91780]. 
29The relationship between bortezomib  plasma concentrations and proteasome inhibition can be 
described by a maximum effect (E max) model.  The E max curve is initially very steep, with small 
changes in plasma bortezomib  concentration over the range of 0.5 to 2.0 ng/mL relating to large 
increases in the percent inhibi tion (0–60%).  After that, a pl ateau occurs where marginal 
increases of proteasome inhibiti on are observed in spi[INVESTIGATOR_588926]. 
 9.2 Bortezomib Supply and Dosage 
 Drug is available in sterile, si ngle use vials containing 3.5 mg of bortezomib.  Each vial of 
bortezomib for Injection should be reconstitute d under a laminar flow biological cabinet (hood) 
within eight hours before dosing with 3.5 mL of normal (0.9%) saline, Sodium Chloride 
Injection USP, so that the reconstituted soluti on contains bortezomib at a concentration of 
1 mg/mL.  Prior to reconstitution the vials should remain in the cartons to protect them from light.  Dissolution is completed in approximately [ADDRESS_775638] be kept of all disposed materials.  
 9.2.1 Bortezomib Administration  Drug will be administered only to eligible patient s under the supervision of the investigator or 
identified sub-investigator(s).  Patients may be treated on an out-p atient basis, if possible.   
The pharmacist will prepare the drug under aseptic conditions.  The amount (in mg) of drug to be administered will be determined based on body surface area.  Body surface area is to be 
calculated based on body weight using a standard  nomogram (see Appendix E).  The dose should 
be calculated on Day 1 of each cycle; the dose administered should remain the same throughout 
each cycle but should be recalculated at the start of the next cycle.  If a patient experiences a 
notable change in weight (e.g., loss or gain of 8 lbs or 3.6 kg) within a cycle, as determined by 
[CONTACT_149624], then the patient’s dose should be recalc ulated at that time 
based on clinical judgment.  The appropriate amount of bortezomib will be drawn from the injec tion vial and administered as 
an intravenous (IV) push over [ADDRESS_775639] saline flush or through a running IV line.  Vials are for single use administration. The initial dose of bortezomib administered will be 1.3 mg/m
2.  The dose may be modified.  Please refer to section 6.0.  
 There must be at least 72 hours between each dose of bortezomib.

329.4 High-dose Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) 
Commonly used brand name(s): Cytoxan; Neosar; Procytox. 
  
Cyclophosphamide is classed as an alkylating agen t of the nitrogen mustard type. An activated 
form of cyclophosphamide, phosphoramide mustard, alkylates or binds with many intracellular 
molecular structures, including nuc leic acids. Its cytotoxic action is primarily due to cross-
linking of strands of DNA and RNA, as well as to inhi bition of protein synthesis.

9.5 Plerixafor (Mozobil) 
 
Plerixafor is a macrocyclic compound and a bicyclam derivative.  It is a strong base; all eight 
nitrogen atoms accept protons readily. The two m acrocyclic rings form chelate complexes with 
bivalent metal ions, especially zinc, copper a nd nickel, as well as cobalt and rhodium. The 
biologically active form  of plerixafor is its zinc complex. 
 
9.5.1    Pharmacokinetics 
Following subcutaneous injection, plerixafor is absorbed quickly and peak concentrations are 
reached after 30 to 60 minutes. Up to 58% are bound to plasma proteins, the rest mostly resides 
in extravascular compartments. The drug is not metabolized in significant amounts; no 
interaction with the cy tochrome P450 enzymes or P-glycopro teins has been found. Plasma half-
life is 3 to 5 hours. Pler ixafor is excreted via the kidneys, with 70% of the drug being excreted 
within [ADDRESS_775644] (or perhaps more accurately a 
partial agonist) of the alpha chemokine r eceptor CXCR4 and an allosteric agonist of 
CXCR7.[10] The CXCR4 alpha-chemokine receptor and one of its ligands, SDF-1, are important in hematopoietic stem cell homing to the bone marrow and in hematopoietic stem cell quiescence. The in vivo effect of plerixafor with regard to ubiquitin, the alternative endogenous 
ligand of CXCR4, is unknown. Plerixafor has been found to be a strong inducer of mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells from the bone marrow to the bloodstream as peripheral blood stem cells.

 Toxicities 
10.2.2 Tumor Response  
Hematological parameters and paraprotein levels will be monitored at screening and end of 
treatment. Formal response evaluations will be  performed between 2-6 weeks after stem cell 
collection. This evaluation will be according to the International Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma (EBMT criteria) presented in  Appendix C. For quantitative immunoglobulins, 
and M-protein in serum and 24-hour urine, the in vestigator will use results provided by [CONTACT_588964]- Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_588927]. Serum free light chain data will be used for 
exploratory analysis only. 
 
Myeloma Protein Measurements in Serum and Urine: 
Blood samples for quantitation of immunoglobulins and M-protein by [CONTACT_159425] (SPEP), and a 24-hour urine sample for quantitation of M-protein by [CONTACT_588965] (UPEP) are to be collected from  all subjects during the Screening Phase and at 
the End of Treatment Visit. If the assessment of  progressive disease is based on one of these 
tests, then confirmation is required.  Blood and 24-hour urine samples for M-protein measurement (includi ng immunofixation at 
screening and after complete response [CR]) will be analyzed by [CONTACT_3433] e NewYork-Presby[CONTACT_124266][INVESTIGATOR_588927].

Response Criteria (IURC).  Therefore, no scans are required.    10.[ADDRESS_775650] to be i ssued according to local requirements (e.g., IRB, 
regulatory authorities, etc.).  The responsible Clinical Investigator and/or Mi llennium have the right to  discontinue this study 
at any time for reasonable medical or administ rative reasons in any si ngle center.  Possible 
reasons for termination of the st udy could be but are not limited to: 
 Unsatisfactory enrollment with respect to quantity or quality. 
 Inaccurate or incomplete data collection. 
 Falsification of records. 
 Failure to adhere to the study protocol. 
11. MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT 
11.1  Disease Response 
 
Disease response category (e.g. partial response, very good partial response, complete response, 
stringent complete response) will be as defined by [CONTACT_588966] (Appendix C). 
 
11.2  Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for complete response or partial response (whichever is first 
recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). 
3812.  DATA REPORTING / REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS 
12.1     Data Collection  
 
The data collection plan for this study is to utilize REDCap to capture all treatment, toxicity, and 
efficacy data for all enrolled patients.  
12.1.1 REDCap  
 
REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a free data manageme nt software system that is 
fully supported by [CONTACT_588967] 
(CTSC).  It is a tool for the creation of customized, secure data management systems that include 
Web-based data-entry forms, repor ting tools, and a full array of s ecurity features including user 
and group based privileges, authen tication using institution LDAP system, with a full audit trail 
of data manipulation and export procedures.  REDCap is maintained on CTSC-owned servers 
that are backed up nightly and support encrypted  (SSL-based) connections.  Nationally, the 
software is developed, enhanced and supported through a multi-institutional consortium led by 
[CONTACT_57422]. REDCap will be used by [CONTACT_588968].  12.[ADDRESS_775651] (DSMB) at Weill Cornell Medical College will be composed 
of medical and statistical independent reviewers and will meet to review the efficacy and safety 
data and determine a risk/benefit analysis in this s ubject population.  The purpose of the DSMB 
is to advise on serious safety considerations, lack of efficacy and any other considerations within the charge to the Committee.  The DSMB may reque st additional meetings or safety reports as 
deemed necessary upon discussion with Millennium  and its representatives.  The Principal 
Investigator, [CONTACT_588980], will be the safety contact [CONTACT_588969]. 
 [CONTACT_588981]’s office is  located at: 
 
  
The phone number to [CONTACT_588981]’s office is:   
The DSMB may stop the study following review of results from each interim analysis.  The first 
interim analysis will examine only safety information from the first ten patients accrued to each 
arm.  Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_588970].  Any grade 5 toxicity that is due to 
treatment will be considered unacceptable, and the study arm will be terminated.   The 
39second interim, conducted when the database is mo re mature (60 patients enrolled – 20 patients 
in each arm A, D and E), will examine both safety and efficacy, including toxicity data, 
protocol adherence, and protocol deviations.  Appropriate efficacy and safety data summaries 
will be provided to the DSMB after each interim analysis.  
13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
13.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 
13.1.1 Primary Endpoints 
 
 The primary endpoint in all five  treatment arms is the percenta ge of patients who are able to 
achieve greater than 6 x 10
6 CD34+ stems cells/kg harvested (def ined as effectiveness).  Ninety-
five percent confidence intervals will be estimated for the effectiveness proportions in all three treatment arms via binomial proportions.  As well,  95% confidence intervals for the differences 
in effectiveness proportions between the three treatment arms will be estimated via binomial proportions.  The chi-square test will be used to compare the effectiveness proportion between 
the three groups and pair-wise group comparis ons will be performed with adjustment for 
multiple comparisons (Scheffe).  Multivariate lo gistic regression will be used to compare the 
effectiveness proportions between pairs of tr eatment arms, controlling for demographic and 
prognostic factors that may not have been su ccessfully balanced after randomization.  
 
13.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate 
 With the closures of the CTX-GCSF (standard of care) arm and the Bortezomib-GCSF arm, approximately 66 patients each in the CTX-Bo rtezomib-GCSF arm (Arm A), Plerixafor-GCSF 
arm (Arm D), and Plerixafor-Bortezomib-GCSF arm (Arm E), will allow for the detection of 1) a ≥18% absolute difference between the percentage of patients in arm A vs. E who are able to 
achieve greater than 6 x 10
6 CD34+ stems cells/kg harvested (defined as effectiveness), and 2) a 
≥28% absolute difference between the percentage of patients in arm D vs. E who are able to 
achieve greater than 6 x 106 CD34+ stems cells/kg harvested (defined as effectiveness), with 
90% and 95% power, respectively, and a two-sided alpha level of 5% .  This calculation assumes 
an effectiveness proportion of 70% in the Plerixafor-GCSF arm, 80% in the CTX-Bortezomib-GCSF arm, and 98% in the Pler ixafor-Bortezomib-GCSF arm.  
 For the comparison of the CTX-Bortezomib-GCSF arm (Arm A) and the Plerixafor-GCSF arm (Arm D), with 66 patients per arm, an observed ≥10% absolute difference between the 
percentage of patients in each arm who experi ence effectiveness will only be considered 
exploratory (i.e., hypoth esis-generating) and not formally powered. 
 The above sample size/power calculation has been adjusted for the possibility of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_588929] 6.2 (i.e., stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_588930] 10 patients are accrued in each arm and the rule will not allow more than 4 failures in the 10 accrued patients per arm).  The overall alpha level (type I error rate) has been  modified to account for the possibility of early 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_588931] 10 patients per arm.  The final analysis comparing the efficacy proportions between the treatment arms (A vs. E and D vs. E) will use an adjusted 
40significance level that accounts for the possibility of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. 
13.3 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
Secondary endpoints include 1) th e mean and median number of stem cells collected for the 
patients in each treatment arm, 2) measures of tumor mass change (as defined by [CONTACT_588971]), 3) the prevalence of biomar kers as surrogate markers of mobilization, 4) 
patient safety, and 5) patient toxicity.  The ANOVA test (or nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test, 
as appropriate) will be performed for compari ng the mean (or median) number of stem cells 
collected in each treatment arm.  The chi-square test (or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate) will be used to compare tumor mass change response proportions (i.e., CR, PR, SD, etc.) between the 
three treatment arms and to compare the preval ence of specific biomarkers between the three 
treatment arms. 
The frequency of subjects experiencing toxicities will be tabulated.  Toxicities will be assessed 
and graded according to CTCAE v. 4.[ADDRESS_775652] 95% confidence intervals around the 
toxicity proportions will be calculated to assess the precis ion of the obtained estimates. 
13.4     Randomization 
Stratified and blocked randomization will be performed at all participating sites.  Randomization 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_170720].  A series of randomized blocks of 6 will be generated for each participating in stitution, using a 1:1:1 allocation ratio (for accrual into arms 
A, D, and E going forward).  This will provide as surance that after six patients are enrolled at 
any participating site, there will be two patient s assigned to each of the three treatment arms.  
After the closing of arms B and C, and the addi tion of arms D and E, randomization will still 
commence in a 1:1:1 allocation ratio.  Since some accrual has already occurred on arm A, however, it will finish accrual before arms D and E.  After arm A completes accrual, the 
randomization scheme will be adjusted to provide a 1:[ADDRESS_775653] 66 patients in each of the three treatment arms at study completion 
(assuming none of the current arms are subject to early closure). 
 14.  PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS AND DEVIATIONS  
 The investigator will conduct the study in complia nce with the protocol given approval/favorable 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_163788](ies).    All protocol amendments and consent form modifications will be made by [CONTACT_9532].  Changes to the protocol will require approval from Millennium and written IRB approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_588932], except when the modification is needed to 
eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to patients.  The investigator will submit all protocol 
modifications to Millennium and the regulatory au thority(ies) in accordance with the governing 
regulations.  
41Written verification of IRB approval will be obtained before any amendment, which affects 
subject safety or efficacy, is implemented.  Amendm ents that are administrative in nature do not 
require IRB approval but will be submitted to the IRB for information purposes.

be closed prematurely, all study materials must be returned to Millennium. 
15.7 Benefits of the Protocol 
 
The potential benefit of this study is the disc overy of a superior mobilization regimen for MM 
patients.  Knowledge will be acquired about th is treatment program, its tolerability, and the 
effectiveness of the combination of VELCADE, high-dose cyclophosphamide (CYTOXAN)  and 
G-CSF in mobilizing peripheral stem cells in patients with multiple myeloma.  
15.[ADDRESS_775660] treatments are free of side effects.  
We believe that this novel regimen will improve response rates and duration of remission. 
15.10 Incentives 
 
No incentives will be offered to patients/subjects for participation in the study.  Participation is 
voluntary. 
4415.11 Costs 
Patients and/or their medical insurance coverage will be responsible for paying for their 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], doctor visits, dia gnostic tests, chemotherapy drugs, and other medicines used in 
their care directly. These costs ar e expected to be equivalent to  those of standard treatment. 
Bortezomib will be provided to research subjects  by [CONTACT_24312], Inc. for the 
duration of their participa tion in this trial at no charge to th e subject or their insurance providers. 
G-CSF and high dose cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) will be obtained through normal commercial 
channels.

50APPENDIX C: International Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma  
Stringent Complete Response (sCR) requires all of the following: 
 All of the criteria of complete response  
 Normal serum free light chain ratio 
 Absence of monoclonal cells on bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_588936] (CR) requires all of the following: 
 Absence of the original monoclonal protein in serum and urine by [CONTACT_588976]. The presence of oligoclononal bands consisten t with 
oligoclonal immune reconstitution does not exclude CR. 
 ≤5% plasma in a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_588937], if biopsy is performed. If absence of monoclonal protein is sustained 
for [ADDRESS_775670] 6 weeks to confirm CR. 
 No increase in size or number of lytic bone lesions (development of a compression fracture does not exclude response)  
 Disappearance of soft tissue plasmacytoma.  
Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) requires all of the following: 
 Negative serum and urine protein electrophoeresis with persistence of monoclonal protein detectable on immunofixation OR 
 ≤90% reduction in serum monoclonal protein level with urine monoclonal protein level < 100mg in 24 hour collection.  
Partial Response (PR) requires all of the following: 
 50% reduction in the level of the serum monoclonal paraprotein. 
 Reduction in 24h urinary light chain excretion either by 90% or to <200mg. 
 For patents with  light chain only disease, then a 50% reduction in the difference between the involved and uninvolved free lig ht chain level 
may be substituted for the M-protein measurement.  
 For patients with non-secretory myeloma only, 50% reduction in plasma cells in a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_588938], if biopsy 
is performed. 
 50% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas (by [CONTACT_207131]). 
 No increase if size or number of lytic bone lesion (development of a compression fracture does not exclude response) 
Stable Disease (SD) requires the following: 
 Not meeting the criteria stringent complete response (sCR), comp lete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), or parti al response 
(PR) 
Plateau: 
 Stable values (within 25% above or below value at the time response is addressed) 
Patients in which no significant change (<50% decrease or <25% increase from baseline) in the production rate of the monoclonal  serum protein or 
Bence-Jones protein excretion and no new lytic lesions and/or plasmacytomas are detected. 
Relapse from CR requires at least one of the following: 
 Reappearance of serum or urinary paraprotein on immunofixation or  routine electrophoresis, confirmed by [CONTACT_588977]. 
 ≥5% plasma in a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_588939]. 
 Development of new lytic lesions of soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite increase in  the size of residual bone lesions (development of a 
compression fracture does not exclude continued response and may not indicate progression). 
 Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium >11.5m g/dl or 2.8 mmol/l) not attr ibutable to any other cause. 
Progressive disease (PD) for patients not in  CR requires one or more of the following: 
 >[ADDRESS_775671] 5g/L and confirmed by [CONTACT_588978]. 
 >[ADDRESS_775672] 200mg/24h and confirmed by [CONTACT_588979]. 
 >25% increase in plasma cells in a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_588938], which must also be an absolute increase of  at least 10%. 
 Definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas. 
 Development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas (development of a compression fracture does not exclude continued response 
and may not indicate progression). 
 Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium >11.5m g/dl or 2.8 mmol/l) not attr ibutable to any other cause. 
51APPENDIX D: Body Surface Area and C reatinine Clearance Calculations 
Body surface area (BSA) should be calculated us ing a standard nomogram that yields the 
following results in meters squared (m2): 
BSA = 3131) ( )(lbs Wt inches Ht 
or 
BSA = 3600) () (kg Wt cm Ht 
 
Creatinine clearance (CrCl) can be calculated using the Cockroft-Gau lt equation as follows: 
 CrCl (ml/min) =  (140-age) (actual wt in kg)               
      72 x serum creatinine (mg/dl) 
For females use 85% of calculated CrCl value. Note: In markedly obese patients, the Cockro ft-Gault formula will tend to overestimate the 
creatinine clearance. (Adipose tissue tends to contribute little creat inine requiring renal 
clearance.)

APPENDIX F: [LOCATION_001] Heart Association Classification of Cardiac Disease 
 The following table presents the NYHA classification of cardiac disease: 
Class Functional Capacity Objective Assessment 
I Patients with cardiac disease but without resulting limitations of 
physical activity.  Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue 
fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea, or anginal pain. No objective evidence 
of cardiovascular 
disease. 
II Patients with cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of physical 
activity.  They are comfortable at rest.  Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea, or anginal pain. Objective evidence of 
minimal 
cardiovascular disease. 
III Patients with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of 
physical activity.  They are comfortable at rest.  Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea, or anginal pain. Objective evidence of 
moderately severe 
cardiovascular disease. 
IV Patients with cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry on any 
physical activity without discomfort.  Symptoms of heart failure or 
the anginal syndrome may be present even at rest.  If any physical 
activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased. Objective evidence of severe cardiovascular 
disease.

multiple myeloma..Leukemia 2009; 23: 3–9. 
aThese criteria identify Stage IB and Stages II and III A/B myeloma by [CONTACT_79082]/Salmon stage. Stage IA becomes 
smoldering or indolent myeloma. 
bIf no monoclonal protein is detected (non-secretory disease), then >/= 30% monoclonal bone marrow plasma cells 
and/or a biopsy-proven plasmacytoma required. 
cA variety of other types of end-organ dysfunctions can occasionally occur and lead to a need for therapy. Such 
dysfunction is sufficient to support classification as myeloma if proven to be myeloma related. 
dIf a solitary (biopsy-proven) plasmacytoma or osteoporosis alone (without fractures) is the sole defining criteria, 
then >/= 30% plasma cells are required in the bone marrow. 
eLow is defined as serum M protein <3.0 g per 100 ml. 
fThese criteria identify Stage IA myeloma by [CONTACT_79082]/Salmon stage.

Page [ADDRESS_783738].[1] However, increasing data suggest that fever may be 
a protective adaptive response that should be allowed to run its course under most circumstances.[2, 
3] Although one randomized controlled trial using physical cooling of mechanically ventilated patients 
with septic shock found a reduction in vasopressor dose and reduced early mortality when treating 
fever,[4] a growing number of studies have found either no clinically important benefit, or harms, in 
treating fever of infectious origin. 
1.[ADDRESS_783739] found that higher early fever is associated with a lower risk of death among patients with 
an ICU admission diagnosis of infection [5, 6] and that fever may enhance immune-cell function,[7, 8] 
inhibit pathogen growth,[9-11] and increase the activity of antimicrobial drugs.[12] Fever potentially 
benefits infected patients via multiple mechanisms; in vitro and animal studies have shown that elevated 
temperatures augment immune function, increase production of protective heat shock proteins, directly 
inhibit microorganism growth, reduce viral replication, and enhance antibiotic effectiveness.[3, 13] More 
rapid recoveries are observed from chickenpox,[14] malaria,[15] and rhinovirus [16] infections with 
avoidance of antipyretic medication, and many innate and adaptive immunological processes are 
accelerated by [CONTACT_411].[17-19] The [LOCATION_006] National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 
recommend not using antipyretic agents “with the sole aim of reducing body temperature in children 
with fever.”[17, 20] As recently as the 1910’s, the “malaria fever cure” (inducing fever to treat a range 
of conditions, an approach known as “pyrotherapy”) was widespread, with the originator of the idea 
receiving the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology in 1927.[21, 22] 
A randomized control trial published in [ADDRESS_783740] of antipyretic therapy on outcomes 
in critically ill patients had to be terminated at the interim analysis as there were seven deaths in the 
aggressive group and only one death in the permissive group.[23] Another randomized controlled trial 
in critically ill patients (without neurotrauma or severe hypoxia) failed to support the treatment of fever; 
no significant differences in ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577], or mortality between those receiving 
external cooling for temperature ≥38.5 ℃ vs. no antipyretic treatment was found.[24] A prospective 
controlled trial randomized 700 patients with fever of known or suspected infectious etiology to receive 
either 1 g of intravenous acetaminophen or placebo every 6 hours until ICU discharge, resolution of 
fever, cessation of antimicrobial therapy, or death.[25] The primary outcome, ICU-free days until day 
28, was not decreased in the treatment arm, and secondary outcomes (28 and 90-day mortality, ICU 
and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577]) were also not significantly different between groups.[25] 
A systematic review and trial sequential analysis of randomized controlled trials found a total of 6 
randomized controlled trials including 819 patients.[26] Overall, there was no beneficial effect of 
antipyretic therapy on mortality risk in patients with established sepsis (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 
  
Version: 3.1 (2022-03-02) 
Page 8 of 28 0.50–2.05), and the review failed to identify any beneficial effect of antipyretic therapy on ICU patients 
with established diagnosis of sepsis.[26] Another systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised 
controlled trials investigating treatments administered to febrile patients found fifteen studies reporting 
results from 13 trials, and found that active temperature management neither increased nor decreased 
mortality risk, ICU, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_594042].[27] A meta-analysis examining the 
impact of antipyretic therapy on mortality in critically ill septic adults found 8 randomized studies (1,507 
patients) and 8 observational studies (17,432 patients).[28] Antipyretic therapy did not reduce 28-
day/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_594043] (relative risk, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.77–1.13; I2 = 0.0%) or 
observational studies (odds ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.54–1.51; I2 = 76.1%), and the authors concluded that 
antipyretic treatment does not significantly improve 28-day/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_594044].[28] 
A retrospective cohort study evaluated 1,264 patients requiring mechanical ventilation initiated in the ED 
with subsequent admission to an intensive care unit.[29] The authors found that high fever (≥39.5°C) was 
associated with increased risk for mortality in mechanically ventilated patients; however, in patients with 
sepsis, moderate fever (38.3°C-39.4°C) was protective, and antipyretic medication was not associated 
with changes in outcome.[29] An open, parallel-group pi[INVESTIGATOR_83021] (the FEVER pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251]) 
enrolled 87 pediatric intensive care unit patients who were randomly assigned to permissive (antipyretic 
interventions only at ≥ 39.5 °C) or restrictive groups (antipyretic interventions at ≥ 37.5 °C) whilst on 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413].[17] Length of stay, duration of organ support and mortality were similar between 
groups, and no pre-specified serious adverse events occurred.[17] Finally, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_594045] ( ClinicalTrials.gov  Identifier: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) has recently been completed, 
with initial analysis of results appearing promising (manuscript in preparation). 
Temperature has been suggested to influence the virulence of an earlier discovered coronavirus, SARS 
CoV, [30] and most isolates of human rhinovirus, the common cold virus, replicate more robustly at the 
cool temperatures found in the nasal cavity (33–35 °C) than at core body (lung) temperature (37 °C).[31] 
Rhinovirus replicates preferentially at cooler nasal cavity temperature due, in part, to a less efficient 
antiviral defense response of infected cells at cool temperature, raising the possibility that inhaling cool air 
might diminish resistance to respi[INVESTIGATOR_594046].[31] Influenza 
B virus viral hemagglutinin exhibits higher expression at 33°C (a temperature required for membrane 
fusion), indicating pronounced adaptation to the mildly acidic pH and cooler temperature of human 
upper airways.[32] Specifically, protein expression of influenza B virus viral hemagglutinin proved to be 
temperature dependent, with expression highest at 33°C and gradually decreasing at higher 
temperatures.[32] On the other hand, avian influenza A viruses, adapted to the temperature of the avian 
enteric tract (40°C), show restricted growth at cooler temperatures ( ∼32°C).[32] 
More recently, simulations of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_783741] a higher 
entropy penalty upon binding angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) compared to the RBD of SARS-
CoV.[33] Consequently, SARS-CoV-2 may be more temperature-sensitive in terms of human infection 
than SARS-CoV.[33]

Page 9 of 28 Hyperthermia induced by [CONTACT_594062] (as opposed to fever induced by [CONTACT_594063]) is normally limited to 41.8 to 42°C when used to kill tumor cells in 
cancer treatment, with minimal adverse effects.[34-37] Furthermore, hyperthermia and elevated 
temperature have been found to have positive impacts on the immune system. Cells have been found 
to exhibit increased levels of heat-shock proteins, specifically HSP70 [38] and HSP90, [39] which are 
directly related to and/or cause antigen presentation and cross ‐presentation, activation of macrophages 
and lymphocytes, and activation and maturation of dendritic cells,[40] all of which are essential antiviral 
immune responses. Notably, fever has often abated by [CONTACT_29623] a COVID-19 patient requires

1.3 Name [CONTACT_594080] (ensoETM, Attune Medical, 
Chicago, IL) This device is an FDA cleared device, and is  a multi-lumen silicone tube placed in the 
esophagus for the purpose of cooling or warming a patient while simultaneously allowing gastric 
decompression and drainage. Modulation and control of the patient’s temperature is achieved by 
[CONTACT_594064]. Two lumens connect to the external heat 
exchanger, while a third central lumen provides stomach access for connection to a fluid collection 
device with low intermittent suction for gastric decompression. Distilled water circulates within the device 
just like a water blanket.  The device can be placed by [CONTACT_594065], emergency 
room, or intensive care unit. It is a single-use, disposable, non-implantable device with an intended 
duration of use of [ADDRESS_783743] 
therapeutic hypothermia [42-45], warming of burn patients [46], warming general surgical patients,[47]

Page 10 of 28 2.1 Primary Objectives 
1. Determine the change in PaO2/FiO2 ratio at 0, 24, 48, and [ADDRESS_783744] of core warming on patient mortality. 
3 Investigational Plan 
3.1 General Design 
This is a small scale pi[INVESTIGATOR_594048]-19, allowing earlier weaning from ventilation, and greater 
overall survival. This prospective, randomized study will include 22 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 
and undergoing mechanical ventilation for the treatment of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]. Patients will be randomized 
in a 1:1 fashion with 11 patients (Group A) randomized to undergo core warming, and the other 11 patients 
(Group B) serving as the control group who will not have the ensoETM device used. Patients randomized 
to Group A will have core warming initiated in the ICU or other clinical environment in which they are being 
treated after enrollment and provision of informed consent from appropriate surrogate or legally authorized 
representative. 
3.1.1 Screening Phase 
Subjects will be recruited from the ICU or other clinical environment in which they are being treated 
(Emergency Department, step-down unit, etc.). Patients will be identified by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_594049]/coordinators as available. All patients without a DNR order with a diagnosis of COVID-19 
and meeting inclusion criteria will be eligible for screening for any exclusion criteria. Written informed 
consent for the research study will be obtained from patient’s surrogate or legally authorized representative 
prior to enrollment. 
3.1.[ADDRESS_783745] a signed research study consent form (via surrogate or legally authorized 
representative) will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to core warming with the study device (ensoETM) or to 
standard of care (standard temperature management and treatment). The device will be used as indicated 
(for warming). Patient temperature measurement will be collected for both the core warming and standard 
of care arms during the study period (72 hours). 
Core warming will be performed using standard technique per instructions for use for the esophageal 
heat transfer device. The esophageal heat transfer device will be set to 42°C temperature after initial 
placement, and maintained at 42°C for the duration of treatment. It is expected that patient temperature 
will increase from baseline by 1°C to 2°C, but due to ongoing

Page 11 of 28 heat loss from the patient, the expected maximum patient temperature is below 39°C. The time course 
of illness of COVID-[ADDRESS_783746] fever by [CONTACT_594066].[41] If patient temperature increases above this range and reaches 39.8°C, the device will 
be set to an operating temperature of 40°C, thereby [CONTACT_594067] (ambient heat loss precludes patient from reaching device operating temperature). 
Monitoring and Evaluation 
All patients will have usual standard of care labs, vital signs, and imaging for patients undergoing 
mechanical ventilation in the ICU. Specific parameters to be measured include PaO2 at regular intervals 
appropriate for patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, and FiO2 at the time of obtaining blood 
gases for PaO2 measurement, to allow calculation of P/F ratio. 
3.1.3 Follow Up (Day 30)  
Follow up data will be collected at [ADDRESS_783747] data in the study. Once the randomization form is entered into the system and saved, 
the back end algorithm will run and a participant will be assigned an arm corresponding to either study 
device (Group A – Core warming) or standard of care (Group B – Control). Patients will undergo 
randomization after being enrolled into the study and prior to the placement of the core warming device. 
Randomization will be performed in a 1:1 fashion and maintained on the limited access, encrypted, 
Redcap database. 
3.2 Study Endpoints 
The purpose of the proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_594050]2/FiO2 ratio 72 hours after initiation. 
3.2.1 Primary Study Endpoints 
The primary endpoint of this study will be:

approaching the patient and/or their surrogate / legally authorized representative about study 
participation. Written informed consent for the research study will be obtained from patient’s surrogate 
or legally authorized representative prior to enrollment. If a patient enrolled in the study gains the 
capacity to consent for him/herself while the study is in progress, the patient will be approached by a 
study team member and the consent document will be presented directly to the patient. All questions 
the patient might have will be answered. The patient will be given the opportunity to either withdraw 
from the study or sign the consent form. The patient will be informed that his or her decision to withdraw 
from the study will not affect his or her medical care 
4.[ADDRESS_783752] until the study is completed (72 hours). The device will be set to 42°C for the duration 
of the study period, with the exception of any elevations in patient temperature as described in section

Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint of this study will be the change in PaO2/FiO2 ratio at 0, 24, 48, and [ADDRESS_783760] care (standard 
temperature management, with or without antipyretics as needed). 
7.1 Secondary Endpoints 
Secondary endpoints include: 
1. Viral load measured in nasopharyngeal swab by [CONTACT_594061] 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours 
after initiation of core warming 
2. Duration of mechanical ventilation 
3. Patient mortality 
7.2 Sample Size and Power Determination 
Based on a prior study in patients with sepsis, a maximum temperature of 38.3°C to 39.4°C was 
associated with survival (aHR 0.61 [95% CI, 0.39-0.99]).[29] However, the effect of warming specific 
to COVID-[ADDRESS_783761] measures to report outcomes and measure differences between groups. 
Specifically, we will use descriptive statistics, including mean (standard deviation) and median 
(interquartile range). Normality will be assessed using histograms and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov 
test. Categorical variables will be compared using the chi-squared test or Fisher exact test. 
Continuous variables will be compared using the independent samples t or Mann–Whitney U test. 
7.3.[ADDRESS_783762] Population(s) for Analysis 
All patients enrolled, randomized to a study arm, and completed in the study will be included for 
analysis.

Page 17 of 28 8 Safety and Adverse Events 
8.1 Definitions 
8.1.1 Adverse Event 
An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in 
severity during the course of the study. Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as 
adverse events. Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if 
the abnormality: 
 results in study withdrawal 
 is associated with a serious adverse event 
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms 
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests 
 is considered by [CONTACT_594070]: 
Unanticipated adverse device effect is any serious adverse effect on health or safety, any life-
threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with a device, if that effect, problem, or death 
was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the application; or any 
other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or 
welfare of subjects. 
8.1.2 Serious Adverse Event 
Serious Adverse Event 
Adverse events are classified as serious or non-serious. A serious adverse event is any AE that 
is: 
 fatal 
 life-threatening 
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] 
 results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 an important medical event 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of 
major clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent 
one of the other serious outcomes noted above. For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure 
that did not result in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an 
emergency department would typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355]. 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious 
adverse events. 
8.1.3 Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others 
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria: 
Version: 3.1 (2022-03-02) 
Page 18 of 28  Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency (i.e. not described in study-related documents 
such as the IRB-approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc.) 
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research (i.e. possibly related means there 
is a reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused 
by [CONTACT_3459]) 
 Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm). 
8.1.4 Preexisting Condition 
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study. A preexisting condition should 
be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens 
during the study period. 
8.1.5 General Physical Examination Findings 
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition. At 
the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of 
an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event. 
8.1.[ADDRESS_783763] to 
report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might 
reasonably be related to participation in this study. 
8.1.7 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_594052] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol. 
Any condition responsible for additional surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the 
condition meets the criteria for an adverse event. 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an 
adverse event in the following circumstances: 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14841] 
a preexisting condition. Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event 
if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful. 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_201728]. 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], 
unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_49849]. 
  
Version: 3.1 (2022-03-02) 
Page [ADDRESS_783764], the investigator will seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_28812], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148]. Information on all adverse events will be recorded 
immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event case report form 
(CRF). All clearly related signs, symptoms, and clinically significant abnormal diagnostic procedures 
results should be recorded in the source document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis. 
All adverse events occurring during the study period (consent through 30 day follow up) will be 
recorded. The clinical course of each event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it 
has been determined that the study intervention or participation is not the cause. Serious adverse 
events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period will be followed up to determine the final 
outcome. Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be 
possibly related to the study intervention or study participation will be recorded and reported 
immediately. 
 8.3 Classification of Adverse Events 
Severity  
 Grade 1 : mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention is not indicated.  
 Grade 2 : moderate ; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention is indicated; limiting to age-
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL; instrumental ADL refers to preparing 
meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money, etc.).  
 Grade 3: severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_594053]; disabling; limiting to self-care ADL (self-care 
ADL refers to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden).  
 Grade 4: life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention is indicated.  
 Grade 5 : death due to an AE.  
Relatedness  
1) Definite: the AE is clearly related to the research procedures  
2) Probably: the AE is likely related to the research procedures  
3) Possible: the AE may be related to the research procedures  
4) Unlikely: the AE is doubtfully related to the research procedures  
5) Unrelated: the AE is clearly not related to the research procedures  
Expectedness   
AEs must be assessed as to whether they were expected to occur or were unexpected, meaning 
not anticipated based on current knowledge found in the protocol, investigator brochure, product 
insert, or label. 
Expected: an AE known to be associated with the intervention or condition under study.  
  
Version: 3.1 (2022-03-02) 
Page 20 of 28 OHRP defines an unexpected AE as any AE occurring in one or more subjects participating in a 
research protocol, the nature, severity, or frequency of which is not consistent with either: 
1) the known or foreseeable risk of AEs associated with the procedures involved in the 
research that are described in a) the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-
approved research protocol, any applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB-
approved informed consent document, and b) other relevant sources of information, 
such as product labeling and package inserts; or 
2) the expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the 
subject(s) experiencing the AE and the subject’s predisposing risk factor profile for the AE. 
 8.[ADDRESS_783765] be reported is defined as the period from 
the initiation of any study procedures (consent) to the end of the study follow-up (1-Month follow up 
visit/Visit3). Adverse events that do not require expedited reporting (see section 9.5 below) will be 
reported in summary to the IRB at continuing review. 
 8.[ADDRESS_783766], will be reported to the 
IRB in accordance with the institutional and FDA requirements. Investigators will use the appropriate 
SAE/UP CRF to record events and a line item will also be added to the AE log CRF. 
The minimum necessary information to be provided at the time of the initial expedited event report 
includes: 
 Study identifier • Current status 
 Study Center • Whether study intervention was 
 Subject number discontinued 
 A description of the event • The reason why the event is classified as 
 Date of onset serious 
 Investigator assessment of the association 
between the event and study intervention 
8.5.[ADDRESS_783767] has not resolved at the time of the initial 
report and new information arises that changes the investigator’s assessment of the event, a follow-
up report including all relevant new or reassessed information (e.g., concomitant medication, 
medical history) should be submitted to the IRB. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all 
events are followed until either resolved or stable. 
8.5.2 Sponsor reporting: Notifying the Funding Sponsor 
Electronic notification of any adverse events related to the use of the core warming device will be 
sent to the funding sponsor as determined by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_36749]. 
  
Version: 3.1 (2022-03-02) 
Page [ADDRESS_783768] of 1996 (HIPAA). Those 
regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following: 
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study 
 Who will have access to that information and why 
 Who will use or disclose that information 
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI. 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], 
retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization. For 
subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain 
permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled 
study period. 
9.2 Data Collection and Management 
Data will be collected by [CONTACT_286560]. Source and 
CRFs will be entered into a RedCap data management system. Participants will be assigned a 
Participant ID “PID” for use on CRF data collection for entry into the data management system to 
protect and ensure confidentiality. 
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a 
clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial. Source data are contained in 
source documents. Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], 
clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, 
pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_19093], microfiches, photographic negatives, 
microfilm or magnetic media, x-rays, subject files, and 
  
Version: 3.1 (2022-03-02) 
Page 22 of 28 records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico-technical departments involved in 
the clinical trial. 
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study. All data 
requested on the CRF must be recorded. All missing data must be explained. If a space on the CRF 
is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D”. If the 
item is not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”. All entries should be printed legibly in black 
ink. If any entry error has been made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line through 
the incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it. All such changes must be initialed and dated. 
DO NOT ERASE OR WHITE OUT ERRORS. For clarification of illegible or uncertain entries, print 
the clarification above the item, then initial and date it. The study data will be stored indefinitely. A 
de-identified data set may be shared with the funding sponsor. 
9.3 Records Retention 
Study records, including administrative and participant related source and CRFs, will be retained for 
7 years after the completion of the research (often marked by a final progress report). 
10 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting  
10.1 Study Monitoring Plan  
The investigator and research team will allocate adequate time for such monitoring activities. The 
Investigator will also ensure that the monitor or other compliance or quality assurance reviewer is 
given access to all the above noted study-related documents and study related facilities (e.g. ICU), 
and has adequate space to conduct the monitoring visit. 
10.2 Auditing and Inspecting 
The investigator will permit study-related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1201], 
government regulatory bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups of all study 
related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, 
study data etc.). The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study-related 
facilities. Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by 
[CONTACT_16478]. 
[ADDRESS_783769] (IRB), in agreement with local legal prescriptions, for formal approval of the study 
conduct. The decision of the IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the 
investigator and a copy of this decision will be provided to the funding sponsor before commencement 
of this study if required. The formal consent of a subject, using the IRB-approved consent form, must 
be obtained before that subject undergoes any study procedure. The consent form must be signed 
by [CONTACT_594071], and the 
appropriately delegated research staff obtaining the consent. 
  
Version: 3.1 (2022-03-02) 
Page 23 of 28 11.1 Risks 
Risks of the study procedures are described below: 
Core warming risks: Placement of the core warming device, similar to any device in the esophagus, 
can result in or exacerbate esophageal tissue damage, particularly in patients with known 
esophageal deformity or evidence of esophageal trauma. These risks are similar to those who 
receive the standard of care orogastric or nasogastric tubes inserted into the esophagus during 
routine clinical care of ICU patients. 
There is also a risk that placement of the core warming device may result in movement of the tongue 
to the side, which can persist after removal; however, it is unclear  whether this tongue deviation is 
caused by [CONTACT_594072]-19 infection. Tongue deviation is one of the known sequelae of infection with 
SARS-CoV-2, better known as COVID-19.[53][54][55] Electromyography of the muscles innervated 
by [CONTACT_594073], superior laryngeal, and recurrent laryngeal branches of the vagus nerve, and by 
[CONTACT_594074], have shown asymmetric patterns of acute or chronic 
neurogenic damage, or both.[54] Whether these findings reflect the direct (viral) or indirect (immune-
mediated) effect of SARS-CoV-2 remains to be established.[54]  
Loss of Confidentiality Risks: There is the potential for loss of confidentiality during data collection. 
Temperature modulation risks: Warming critically ill septic patients has been previously 
investigated, with no unforeseen risks identified. Whole-body hyperthermia (to core body 
temperatures > 39.0°C) has been tested in sedated patients undergoing colorectal surgery, as well 
as in oncological patients in combination with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy.[52] Patients in 
these studies suffered no serious hyperthermia-related side effects despi[INVESTIGATOR_594054]. 
Potential adverse effects of external warming/body temperature elevation include: 
(1) Vasodilation of arteriovenous shunts in the skin resulting in decreased blood pressure and an 
increase in vasopressor dose 
(2) Elevated heart rate 
(3) Increased respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] 
(4) Increased metabolic rate 
(5) Patient discomfort 
(6) Sweating 
(7) Worsened long-term neurological function in patients with acute stroke or post-cardiac arrest 
(8) Exacerbation of multiple sclerosis symptoms 
This study will only enroll COVID-[ADDRESS_783770], or multiple sclerosis. 
  
Version: 3.1 (2022-03-02) 
Page [ADDRESS_783771] benefits to the participants in this study. There may be a benefit to core 
warming of patients with COVID-19. The knowledge gained by [CONTACT_594075] a whole in the future and potentially lead to additional studies. 
11.3 Risk Benefit Assessment 
The risks of participating in the study are outweighed by [CONTACT_594076]. 
11.4 Informed Consent Process/ HIPAA Authorization 
Participants’ surrogate or legally authorized representative will be provided an IRB approved 
consent form describing this study and providing sufficient information to make an informed 
decision about their participation in this study. A verbal review of the consent form will take place 
with the participant and delegated personnel. This consent form will include HIPAA authorization 
language which will also be reviewed with the participant. The formal consent of a subject, using 
the IRB-approved consent form, will be obtained before that subject undergoes any study 
procedure. The consent form must be signed by [CONTACT_594077], and the investigator-designated research professional obtaining 
the consent. The participant will be consented in a private clinical space and will be given ample 
time to ask questions and have questions answered. As the majority of the procedures that will 
occur are standard of care, we will clearly discuss what the research part of the day and days after 
will include. The voluntary nature of the study will be reviewed and participants will be told that 
should they choose not to consent, their clinical care will not be effected. 
[ADDRESS_783772] 
All Investigators will follow the institution’s policies on Conflicts of Interest related to research. 
12.3 Participant Stipends or Payments 
Participants will not receive payment. 
13 Publication Plan 
Investigators will follow all applicable policies and guidelines relating to publishing study results. 
The research team will share materials planned for publication to the Funding Sponsor according 
to the terms of the Clinical Trial Agreement.

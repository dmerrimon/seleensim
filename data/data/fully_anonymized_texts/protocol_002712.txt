through the following aims:  
1.[ADDRESS_1271673] cancer survivors 
age ≥75 . This will bu ild off the work of a multidisciplinary expert panel which will come 
together for a meeting to develop draft recommendations ( OHRS exempt protocol # 18-
526). 
• Interview up to 30 patients through telephone -based patient interviews  and focus 
groups and interview oncologists and primary care providers (PCs) through  4-6 
focus  groups to learn their perceptions and thoughts about when to stop surveillance 
mammography, how to thoughtfully incorporate life expectancy into decision -
making,  how to communicate the benefits/risks of surveillance mammography, 
obtain feedback on the communication tool, and to explore optimal strategies for 
integrated and unified care between disciplines  
• Perform cognitive testing of the communication tool in up to [ADDRESS_1271674] cancer 
survivors and their oncology clinicians  
• In a pre -post intervention study, examine the effect of the co mmunication tool 
among [ADDRESS_1271675] cancer survivors age ≥75 years (with low risk of in -breast 
recurrences) seen by [CONTACT_905893]’s intentions for and knowledge of the 
pros and cons of surveillance mammography.  
 
We hypothesize that our communication t ool will lead to fewer women intending to receive 
surveillance mammography in the next year and women having more knowledge of the benefits and 
risks of surveillance mammography.

PROTOCOL TITLE:  
 Page [ADDRESS_1271678] cancer survivors regarding surveillance mammography and follow -up care lack 
consistency or specific attention to the needs of older patients. There are no prospectiv e 
studies which specifically examine the benefits of surveillance mammography in older 
patients, let alone those with limited life expectancy, and the use of indefinite 
mammography in this growing patient population has been questioned by [CONTACT_905894] (NCCN) Older Adult Guidelines21 and in a literature

ipsilateral or contralateral breast cancer in the 5 -10 year s after initial diagnosis (which is 
similar to the risk for breast cancer in aging, screening populations) ,1,8 but the risk for these

PROTOCOL TITLE:  
 Page [ADDRESS_1271685] cancer surveillance in older survivors, a 
growing population of women for whom prospective eviden ce and expert consensus is 
lacking. Strategies are needed to individualize follow -up care to avoid medical interventions 
from which patients are unlikely to benefit (or from which they will not benefit for many 
years) and are likely to inflict immediate ha rm. We anticipate that our framework for 
follow -up care for older breast cancer survivors will significantly improve survivorship care, 
decrease overuse of unnecessary testing, and improve quality of life, with an enhanced 
understanding of the pros/cons of  mammography  in the context of having a better 
understanding of one’s life expectancy. Our project will work on how to deliver this 
information in compassionate, thoughtful, and informative way . Further, we anticipate that 
clinicians will feel more informe d, empowered, and supported to make recommendations 
for their older breast cancer survivors if they are endorsed by [CONTACT_311470]. We 
recognize that conversations on cessation of mammography with breast cancer survivors 
may be particularly challenging b ecause of their personal experiences with cancer. 
However, if women understand their individualized risks and benefits, they will at least 
have the opportunity to make informed decisions rather than have the false security that 
routine mammograms may indef initely improve their longevity.  Figure [ADDRESS_1271686] . How to optimally address surveillance mammography in older 
patients has never been specifically addressed. We will develop a novel and much needed 
approach to optimize surveillance mammography use and follow -up care for older women, 
provide a foundation for discussion about cessation of mammography when appropriate, and 
better coordinate primary and specialty care. The key innovations of this proposal include: 
(1) This study focuses on follow -up care for older  breast cancer survivors, and will develop 
expert-based recommendations on mammography use and follow -up care for this 
population. (2) This is the first study to directly engage patients and clinicians in follow -up 
care of older breast cancer survivors which will foster consensus and optimize care 
integration. It will directly engage patients and national experts from complementary 
specialties around decision -making for mammography and communication of recommended 
approaches for when mammography cessation should occur. (3) This is the first study to 
evaluate how to optimally and sensitively incorporate life expectancy into the decision -
making process for surveillance mammography in older breast cancer survivors.  (4) This 
study will develop an easy -to-use novel communication tool describing the pros/con s of 
surveillance mammography for patients and clinicians that we anticipate will lead to more 
informed decisions on mammography use and less over -utilization.

This proposal builds nicely on our collective, prior work and combined expertise.  
Literature review: We recently completed a systematic review of the available literature on 
surveillance mammography in older populations,[ADDRESS_1271689] recurrences or new cance rs, the anticipated risks/benefits of testing, and 
preferences. In our review, we suggested specific approaches for follow -up care for older 
patients and provided talking points for discussing mammography cessation with patients. In 
Aim 1, we will engage a n expert panel of clinician and patient stakeholders to further refine 
our literature review and recommendations for surveillance mammography and follow -up 
care.

mammography decreased with worsening life expectancy, but 57% of those with estimated 
≤5-year life expectancy reported having mammography in the last year. Conversely, 14.1%

PROTOCOL TITLE:  
 Page [ADDRESS_1271693] . The long -term goals of this work are to optimize mammography use (and 
decrease overscreening) for older breast cancer survivors, a group in critical need of 
evidence -based, unified approaches to their follow -up care. Older patients are not 
adequately rep resented in any screening or surveillance clinical trials, and the proposed 
study will address significant knowledge gaps through expert consensus and prospective 
data collection.  In addition, the study will p rovide a framework for discussions on 
how/when to stop surveillance mammography in the context of life expectancy framing 
and how to prioritize follow -up strategies, with the goal to enhance communication 
between patients and clinicians as well as between PCs and specialists. This study will 
provide pr eliminary data for a prospective, randomized study evaluating the use of our 
expert recommendations among patients and PC and oncology clinicians in a larger, 
geographically diverse setting, with the ultimate goal to further assess impact, standardize 
practice, improve coordination of care, and disseminate our novel and urgently needed 
intervention.

4.0 Study -Wide Number of Subjects*  
4.1 For Aim 1.1, we will recruit up to  30 patients and up to 48 providers for the qualitative  
focus group/interview  component, and 5 -10 patients for the cognitive interviewing of the 
tool. For Aim 1.2, we will recruit 45 patients and the providers taking care of those 
patients.  
5.0 Study -Wide Recruitment Methods  
5.1 Procedures for i nterview  and focus gro up (and cognitive testing) recruitment - Patients  
(Aim 1.1). Due to due potential challenges in gathering multiple focus groups of older 
patients who may have issues with mobility and transportation, the potential sensitivity 
of topi[INVESTIGATOR_410690] (i.e.  life expectancy), and because we would like to obtain in -
depth, individualized opi[INVESTIGATOR_6153], we will conduct a mixture of one-on-one telephone 
interviews (30 -60 minutes each)  by [CONTACT_905897] . For this aim, w e will recruit 
approximately 10 patients ages 60 -74, 10  patients ages 75 -79 and 10 patients age ≥[ADDRESS_1271699] cancer (thus at low -average risk for in -breast 
recurrences) and ideally ≥1 Charlson comorbidity72 (targeting those with shorter life 
expectancy) who underwent breast surgery and have completed any active breast cancer 
therapy (i.e. any chemotherapy, radiation >3 months ago) and who are either entering or

are alread y in the follow -up phase of cancer care. This is an ideal time to recruit patients 
as they are transitioning to less frequent follow -up and  mammography plans are being 
made and even scheduled. We will purposively recruit a diverse sample based on 
race/ethn icity and socioeconomic status , including patient advocacy groups in [LOCATION_011] 
and beyond . In order to identify this focused population of patients, we will use our 
patient advocacy network (Patient and Family Advisory Council [PFAC] at DFCI, breast 
cancer ad vocates in New England, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_905867]). We will also reach out to 
our oncology providers at DFCI for any patients who come to mind that fit our 
eligibility and the clinical research coordinator (CRC) will also scan DFCI breast 
oncology clinician  schedules for patients who meet these criteria. Appendix G has a 
flyer/email content for advertising the project. The CRC or study PI [INVESTIGATOR_905868]’s oncologist  and/or NP/PA  for permission to contact [CONTACT_195345] , with providers 
having the option  to opt out if they feel that patient is not appropriate to be approached . 
We will then mail or email potential patients an invitation to the telephone interview  or 
focus group  and a number to call to opt out. The CRC will call patients who do not opt 
out [ADDRESS_1271700]. Freedman, the study PI, will 
also reach out to patient advocacy groups with an introductory email (Appendix G) to 
the study to assess for interest though the patient advocates working on  this project (on 
the expert panel). To accommodate scheduling, we will offer flexible interview and 
focus group times. Once an interview  or focus group  is scheduled, we will mail or email 
the patient the communication t ool (Draft tool in Appendix B and wi ll be further iterated 
based on feedback and Aims that precede its use) before the interview with a  sensitive 
introduction to the tool (to minimize any stress associated with receiving it in advance), 
explaining that the tool will be used during the interv iew. All patient phone interviews 
and focus groups will be led by a trained qualitative researcher from the DFCI Survey 
and Data Management Core (‘Core’) , [CONTACT_905932],  or a research assistant trained by 
[CONTACT_905898] . The Core is a very experienced and well -established team that readily 
organizes and facilitates focus groups , phone interviews,  and performs qualitative data 
analyses. They have a long track record of successful and effective work in this area and 
their expertise will also be utilized to adapt the  communication tool at completion of this 
qualitative aim.  For patients, a waiver of written consent will be requested and verbal 
consent will be obtained. Patients interviewed by [CONTACT_905899] a brief 
cognitive function ( Blessed Orientation -Memo ry-Concentration test [BOMC])73 and 
capacity evaluation (Appendix A) and  will proceed with th e interview if they score <10 
points on the BOMC and answer ≥[ADDRESS_1271701] for $50. Snacks and parking will be provided 
for any focus group that requires travel.  
5.2 Procedures for recruiting f ocus groups  - Providers  (Aim 1.1) . [CONTACT_905932]  will email 
her colleagues at Brigham and Women’s and DFCI to recruit them for a 60- minute 
focus group  discussion,  aimed to occur at a regular weekly/monthly meeting for a 
particula r PCP or medical oncology practice.  We will provide beverages and snacks for 
the me eting. We will visit the practice at BWH or DFCI to conduct the focus groups 
and any virtual focus groups will take place by [CONTACT_905900]. [CONTACT_905932]  will 
also reach ou t to her  broad  network of physicians outside of DFCI to recruit oncologists  
from around the country  for the virtual focus group (which will occur via 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  
 Page 11 of 65  
webex/phone) . [CONTACT_905932] (who is experienced in leading clinician -based focus 
groups) will lead all clin ician focus groups. All discussions will be recorded and 
professionally transcribed. At the start of the clinician focus groups, verbal  consent 
from each participant will be obtained  and providers will be provided a written copy of 
the verbal consent in pe rson or via email . We do not intend to register providers in 
Oncpro.  
5.3 Procedures for recruiting providers and patients  for the tool intervention (Aim 1.2) 
We will then test the communication tool at DFCI , DFCI at South Shore Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , and 
DFCI  at St. Elizabeth’s breast medical oncology practices. [CONTACT_905932] will recruit 
10-[ADDRESS_1271702] the communication tool in

and/or radiation ≥12 months prior and who are aged ≥[ADDRESS_1271705] -
conserving surgery. If a patient meets criteria for possible enrollment, the CRC will 
email the clinician  (Appendix H)  to confirm that mam mography would typi[INVESTIGATOR_905870].  
If the clinician agrees, the CRC will send informatio n and what will be used for verbal 
consent  (Appendix F) to the patient with an opt -out number and email followed by a 
phone call (to those who do not opt out) to explain the study’s purpose and obtain 
verbal consent for participation. The CRC will share a blank communication tool to the 
patient with the ‘pre’su rvey to be filled out before the visit  (clinic visit can be virtual or 
in person) , and notify the clinician when a patient enrolls.  This can be sent to the 
patient by [CONTACT_905901]/in person clinic visit. If the patient 
prefers the materials  to be given to them in person, the CRC will arrange to meet the 
patient [ADDRESS_1271706] clinical workflows  and may involve virtual 
substitution of office visits such as the use of Zoom Video Communications 
application. Although in -person office visits are preferred on site, virtual visits via 
Zoom co nferences , which are HIPPA compliant and protected, can provide a safer and 
efficient alternative  for patients . 
Visit Day . The day before the clinic  visit (virtual or in -person) , the CRC will call  or 
email  the patient to remind them to fill out the  ‘pre’-survey  and send it  to the study 
team. We will also remind the clinician that the patient is coming /being seen virtually  
and will email or hand -deliver a blank communication tool before the visit  so they are 
aware it may be discussed . The CRC may meet the patient in the waiting room or 
communicate by [CONTACT_648]/email before their appointment  to collect the ‘pre’ survey (if not 
already received via email/mail)  A copy of the verbal consent can also be gi ven in 
person or via email/mail  if not already done ahead of this visit. Clinicians will be 
reminded  to incorporate the communication tool in a way that feels comfortable to them 
to facilitate routine practice  but without specific instructions . After the v isit, the CRC 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  
 Page 12 of 65  
will ask the patient to complete the paper ‘post’ surveys  in person, by [CONTACT_2319], or by [CONTACT_519619] 7 days  of the appointment , concluding the study for that patient. To understand 
how providers feel about the communication tool, the experience u sing it, and the 
comfort with it as a guide for discussions, t he clinician will be asked to complete one 
brief survey per patient enrolled (no provider consent planned but a short introduction 
to the survey will be provided -see Appendix D ), after all of th eir participating patients 
have completed their visits. Each patient will be registered to document their 
participation by [CONTACT_905902] a $[ADDRESS_1271707]  for their participation 
and clinicians will receive a $[ADDRESS_1271708]  (Aim 1.2 only)  will be filled out and submitted by [CONTACT_905903] [ADDRESS_1271709]

The Study Coordinator will follow DF/HCC policy (REGIST -101) and register eligible 
participants on the protocol using  the Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS) 
OnCore . Following registration, the Study Coordinator will use the participant study 
number f or identification of all patients.  
 
Participant information, including receipt of verbal consent, will be tracked in a 
password -protected, secure, on -line, web-based system. We will also secure patient 
contact [CONTACT_905904] a tr acking sheets on the number of phone 
calls made and any contact [CONTACT_905905].  Anyone failing screening or 
declining enrollment will be logged internally (not centrally by [CONTACT_313867]) and confidentially

8.0 Study Endpoints , Statistical Plan, and Sample Size Considerations  
8.1 Aim 1.1 (provider focus groups and patient interviews).  For each discussion, the 
transcribed data will be analyzed according to standard comprehensive qualit ative analysis 
methods,74-76 which consists of a two -stage coding process: level 1 structural coding and 
level 2 thematic coding. All analyses will be conducting by [CONTACT_905907]. Structural 
coding will follow the structure of the focus group/interview guide, in which every 
question receives a code that is applied to the appropriate text. Thematic coding will be 
based on themes that arise from the structural coding and will be applied in a second pass 
analysis. Thematic coding allows for a grounded theoretical approach to analysis. Th ese 
methods will be enhanced by [CONTACT_905908] (N’Vivo). This 
state-of-the-art program uses an organizer indexing system for coding, categorizing, 
searching, retrieving, and attaching analytical memos, creating a conceptual relations hip 
network in textual data that has been taxonomically coded. Quotes that exemplify themes 
will also be extracted. Once the thematic analysis  is complete, [CONTACT_905932] will lead the 
preparation of the comprehensive thematic analysis report. Answers to the discrete items 
at the start of discussions will be tabulated.  
8.2 Sample Size Considerations (Aim 1.1).  In qualitative research, sampling is recommended 
until thematic saturation is reached and this typi[INVESTIGATOR_905871] 30 participants 
or ≥4 focus groups with 6 -8 participants per group.77,78 Therefore, we will recruit 30 patients 
and ≥24 clinicians (≥4 focus groups). We will begin with 1 DFCI oncology, 1 BWH PC, and 
1 oncology virtual focus groups. However, if we do not achieve thematic saturation, we will 
recruit 3 more groups to reach themati c saturation. The DFCI ‘Core’ will provide the 
analytic expertise for the qualitative data analyses an thematic summaries.  
8.[ADDRESS_1271711]. Schonberg’s prior s urvey study testing a decision aid for 
screening mammography for older women.66 We will focus on a primary outcome of 
intentions for mammography and will examine how various factors (race, health literacy, 
numeracy, anxiety, life expectancy) impact intentions. We use the sign rank and exact 
McNemar’s testing to compare the ‘pre’ vs. ‘post’ results for the continuous score for 
intention and proportion who indicate ‘yes’, respectively. To account for clustering by 
[CONTACT_30223], we will utilize random effects models if parametric assumptions hold, or 
alternatively using bootstrap resampling techniques to compute 95% confidence intervals 
for the change in intention. We anticipate a low number of missed surveys because of the 
CRC follow -up planned by [CONTACT_648] , mail,  or email if necessary. If a patient is missed for her 
‘pre’ test survey, we will replace her to ensure enrollment of 45 with ‘pre’ and ‘post’ 
surveys. We will compare characteristics of those with missing surveys and m issing

Outcome(s) of Interest  Outcome definitions, planned analyses  
PROTOCOL TITLE:  
 Page 14 of 65  
Primary Outcomes :  
Patients:  Frequency of change in intentions for 
mammography in the next year  15 point validated scale to assess ‘pre’ vs ‘post’ survey 
responses where scores 1 -5 = yes to having mammography, 6 -
10 = unsure, 11 -15 = no for mammography. We will use a 
continuous outcom e of 1 -15.66,79  
Patients & Clinicians : Acceptability & Feasibility  Length, clarity; tabulate responses80; 75% report the tool is 
useful  
Secondary Outcomes:  
Clinicians : satisfaction, time added/removed  Tabulate responses, prepare descriptive analyses  
Patients : preferred decision -making role  ‘Pre’ survey: Examine preferences for active, shared, passive 
decision -making 81 
Patients : Decisional co nflict  ‘Pre’ vs. ‘Post’ survey: 16 item scale, Calculate total and sub -
scale responses. Scores range 1 -100, lower scores indicating 
higher quality decision -making82,83 
Patients : Knowledge about mammography  Number of correct (10) knowledge questions on ‘pre’ vs. 
‘post’ surveys. 66,84,85 
Patients : intentions vs. actual decisions for 
mammography  ‘Post’: Examine whether patient intentions for mammography 
agree with whether mammography is scheduled or not (using 
chart abstraction)  
Patients & Clinicians : Agreement in intentions  ‘Post’ for patients and providers: degree of agreement on 
scores 1 -15 
Patients & Clinicians : life expectancy wishes  ‘post’ for patients and providers: tabulate responses for 
willingness to discuss  
 
8.5 Primary Outcomes for Aim 1.2 : We will focus on the primary outcomes of 
intentions for mammography and acceptability/  feasibility. We use the 
sign rank and exact McNemar’s  testing to compare the ‘pre’ vs. ‘post’ 
results for the score for intention and proportion who indicate ‘yes’, 
respectively. To account for clustering by [CONTACT_30223], we will utilize random 
effects models if parametric assumptions hold, or alternatively usi ng 
bootstrap resampling techniques to compute 95% confidence intervals for 
the change in intention. We anticipate a low number of missed surveys 
because of the CRC follow -up planned by [CONTACT_32627]. If a patient 
is missed for her ‘pre’ test survey, w e will replace her to ensure enrollment 
of 45 with ‘pre’ and ‘post’ surveys. We will compare characteristics of 
those with missing surveys and missing questions to those with complete 
surveys to assess for any notable differences. For feasibility, we will 
declare the tool feasible if ≥75% of patients and physicians report 
usefulness of the tool.  
 
At the conclusion of this am, we will have preliminary data on how the 
communication tool impacted care, its feasibility, and about multiple 
exploratory, secondary  endpoints. If we have difficulties with recruitment 
of patients or clinicians for this project, we will contact [CONTACT_905909]. Given the high 
volume of breast cancer patients and clinicians in our sy stem, we 
anticipate that accrual will occur with ease.  
 
9.0 Procedures Involved  
9.1  Procedures for provider f ocus groups/  patient i nterviews . [CONTACT_905932] 
(who is experienced in leading clinician -based focus groups) will lead all 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  
 Page [ADDRESS_1271713]. Freedman,  or a trained CRC 
from the DFCI Survey and Data Management Core (‘Core’). All 
discussions will be recorded and professionally transcribed. The Core is a 
very experienced and well -established team that readily organizes and 
facilitates focus groups and performs qualitative d ata analyses. They have a 
long track record of successful and effective work in this area and their 
expertise will also be utilized to adapt the communication tool at 
completion of this qualitative aim. At the start of the clinician focus groups, 
verbal consent from each participant will be obtained. For patients (who are 
interviewed by [CONTACT_648]), a waiver of written consent will be requested and 
verbal consent will be obtained. Patients will undergo a brief cognitive 
function (Blessed Orientation -Memory -Conce ntration test [BOMC])73 and 
capacity evaluation ( Appendix A ) and will  proceed with the interv iew if 
they score <10 points on the BOMC and answer ≥4 capacity questions 
correctly.  
9.2 Discussion Content . Clinicians will be asked to comment on (a) the panel 
recommendations from DFCI OHRS exempt protocol 18-526, (b) how 
they currently talk with patients about surveillance and whether and how 
they might incorporate risk or life expectancy in conversations, (c) the 
draft communication tool (including exploring whether electronic tools 
appeal to clinicians), and (d) ideal communication strategies for PCs and  
oncologists to coordinate follow -up care. Patients will first be asked a 
short series of discrete questions which will be followed by [CONTACT_905910][INVESTIGATOR_905872], whether they have ever discussed 
cessation of mammography, and their preferences for receiving the 
information presented on the communication tool (mailed to them ahead 
of time). We will also inquire about whether electronic versions of the tool 
might appeal to pa tients and clinicians or whether they prefer paper 
versions. Draft scripts for clinician and patient focus group and phone 
interviews are provided in Appendix C . These will be  amended as 
appropriate before initiation of this component of the study.  
 
9.3 Survey Instruments . The draft ‘pre’/’post’ patient surveys and a post -visit 
clinician survey (all three draft surveys ) are in Appendix D . Surveys 
contain closed -ended questions (exc ept for solicited comments at the end)  
and are adapted from [CONTACT_627297]’s prior, validated surveys conducted 
before and after the use of a decision aid for screening mammography in 
older women.66 We will ask about demographics, health literacy and 
numeracy (‘pre’ patient), mammography intentions (‘pre’ and ‘post’ 
patient), mammogr aphy knowledge (‘pre’ and ‘post’ patient), anxiety 
about recurrence (‘pre’ patient), acceptability of the communication tool 
(‘pre’ patient and clinician), comfort level and interest in discussions 
about life expectancy (‘pre’ and ‘post’ patient and clinic ian), decisional

protocol  
 
11.0 Data Management  and Confidentiality  
11.1 The data analysis plan and procedures are described in Section 8.  
11.2 Data Management Plan : We will use a secure, password -protected REDCap 
database  to capture information for the intervention part of this stud y (Aim 
1.2). Data elements to be included in the centralized study data repository 
will include baseline demographics, comorbidity, medications, date of 
diagnosis, disease characteristics, and s urvey information. All survey data 
will be specifically entered and maintained securely in password protected 
systems.  
All study components w ill be run from Dana -Farber Cancer Institute. Study 
staff will computerize the data from the patient questionnaire s in this 
observational study. In addition, study staff will computerize medical 
information on each of the study participants into the centralized, secure 
database. For patients invited into the study but who choose not to 
participate, there will be no re tention of patient identifiers. Study staff will 
record the age, race, date of diagnosis and surgery for all patients who 
decline participation to allow for demographic comparison of participants 
and nonparticipants. All original copi[INVESTIGATOR_905873] t in file cabinet

20.[ADDRESS_1271719]. Freedman (along with her collaborators) is well poised to execute the proposed research 
focusing on older breast cancer patients because of her training , expertise, and experiences as a 
clinician -researcher focused in this area of study. The work planned in this study logically builds 
on her prior work and on the prior work of her study collaborators.  [CONTACT_905932] will have all 
of the recourses available  to her at DFCI for the duration of this study, including  statistical, 
research, and nursing support in addition to grants support and the support of the collaborating 
institutions participating in this work (DFCI satellites and affiliates).  
 
21.0 Prior Approv als – N/A 
 
22.0 Recruitment Methods  – See Section [ADDRESS_1271720]  a limited review of a patient’s medical record in order to confirm eligibility; they may  
continue to access their records . 
 
25.0 Compensation for Research -Related Injury   
This study involves Minimal Risk to subjects. Therefore, there is no compensation available to 
subjects in the event of research -related injury.  
 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  
 Page [ADDRESS_1271721] s 
We plan to approach patients when they are already at their provider visits and will call them if 
time point is missed in person. We do not anticipate any additional costs to patients while 
participating in this study. Participants are given gift cards for their time.  
 
27.0 Consent Process  
All participating patients (interviews) and providers (focus groups) will provide informed verbal 
informed con sent at the start of their interview/focus group  (Appendix E ). All participating 
patients for Aim 1.2 (pi[INVESTIGATOR_52393]) will provide verbal informed consent (Appendix F) 
before any study procedures are performed. Patients and providers will receive a co py of their 
verbal conse nt. Ethical standards for human subjects will be strictly followed. We will not obtain 
written consent as it is practically prohibitive for this short survey -based intervention. The 
consent script will include all required informati on commonly included on signed consent forms.  
Moreover, the participant will explicitly be asked if he or she consents to participate prior to 
commencing the survey.  
 
All investigators and research assistants will have undergone full training in Human Su bjects 
Protection Certification. In addition, all research team members will undergo formal training 
regarding the research procedures, including the informed consent process. The purpose, 
procedures, duration, risks, and alternatives of the study will be explained to potential subjects. It 
will be emphasized in the verbal consent that participation is completely voluntary and that 
patients may choose to withdraw at any time without adverse consequence to their medical care 
or loss of benefits to which they  are otherwise entitled. Patients will be informed of the research 
nature of this project.  Extent of confidentiality provided and procedures for protecting 
confidentiality will be discussed in specifics, such as the need to review medical records to 
confi rm cancer treatments. Informed verbal consent will be contingent upon the patient’s full 
awareness and affirmation of these ethical standards. Once all questions have been addressed and 
the individual indicates  she would like to participate, informed conse nt will be obtained. 
Individuals who are unable to provide informed consent will be excluded from participation in 
the study.  
 
 
 
28.0 Process to Document Consent in Writing  
28.1 Because this research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to 
subjects and involv es no procedures for which written documentation of 
consent is normally required outside of the research context, we waive the 
requirement to obtain written documentation of consent  as noted above .

**Draft Focus Group Script Outline – Provider Discussions  
 
**Scripts will vary slightly with regard to focus surveillance vs. screening, depending  
on whether the group is comprised of primary care providers, oncologists, or both)**   
 
Total time = [ADDRESS_1271737]/LUNCH (during the first 10 minutes)  
Good morning/good afternoon. My name [CONTACT_905926] I am a medical oncologist who works 
at Dana -Farber. This is [insert note taker], she/he also works at Dana -Farber  and will be helpi[INVESTIGATOR_905878]. First, we would like to thank you for taking the time to participate in today’s 
discussion about follow -up care and mammography.  
 
There are no right or wrong answers in our discussion today, and your honest feedback and insight are 
the best way for us to better understand your opi[INVESTIGATOR_6153]. We want to welcome all perspectives, so while it 
is OK to disagree with each other, please be resp ectful towards your fellow group members, even if you 
have a different point of view.  We also want to make sure that we provide a welcoming space for 
everyone to participate.  I encourage you to speak to each other, and I will be here to listen and ask so me 
specific questions. In order to be respectful of your time and the task at hand, I may need to interrupt at 
times in order to move us on.  Thank you for your cooperation if those circumstances arise.  
 
Your ideas and perspective are tremendously importan t and we don’t want to miss anything. With your 
permission, I would like to audio record this interview to make sure that we capture your comments and 
accurately represent your perspectives. Our conversation will be kept strictly confidential and you will 
not be identified in any reports or write -ups.  Today’s discussion will last about 1 hour, and you will 
receive $[ADDRESS_1271738] name [CONTACT_905927] (purpose is to make people feel comfortable and encourage participation). Thank 
you all for sharing, I really look forward to learning more about your experiences.  
 
PART B (to be discussed during the next 35 -45 minutes)  
I will f irst provide an overview of this project, the intent, and will briefly review the current screening 
and surveillance guidelines for mammography in older patients. We will also briefly look at the data for 
recurrence with regard to the subtype and past trea tments a woman has received and risk factors for 
local recurrences. ([CONTACT_905932] will present a short slide presentation on these topi[INVESTIGATOR_905879].)  
 
DISCUSSION OUTLINE  
 
**START RECORDING**  
 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  
 Page 31 of 65  
Topic 1: Cessation of testing. We are interested in how you  approach an older patient with a 
history of breast cancer with regard to her surveillance mammography (or secondary screening) 
[for primary care clinicians can add that we realize they may do more screening discussions than 
surveillance - we are interested  in their opi[INVESTIGATOR_905880]]  
 
• In general, how would you describe your approaches/standards pertaining to mammography for 
patients (with a history of breast cancer) as they get older?  
• Who typi[INVESTIGATOR_905881] r survivors?  
o  In general, how comfortable do you feel having conversations about surveillance with 
older patients?  
• Thinking about women who have a history of breast cancer, what role does age, particularly 
advanced age, play in their mammogram recommendati ons from you?  
o When, if at all, do you think women should stop having routine screening 
mammography?  
o When do you think breast cancer survivors should stop having regular surveillance 
mammography?  
• Have you discussed cessation of mammography with your patients?  
o If so, how did you approach this topic? How did it go?   
o Does your approach differ in the screening vs. surveillance setting?  
• For those who discuss stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_905882], are the re any tools you use to help 
with these conversations? Decision aids? Life expectancy tools? Other graphics?  
 
Topic 2: Life expectancy discussions  
• What role does life expectancy play in your conversations about screening and or surveillance 
mammography?Do you routinely incorporate life expectancy into conversations about 
screening/surveillance?  
o If yes, how? And how does it go with patients?  
o If no, why not? (Have you done it in the past and it went poorly, anxious to have 
conversations, etc)  
• Do you feel comf ortable incorporating life expectancy into conversations with patients? What 
has worked or not worked? What are you concerns about this? How do you think this can be 
done well? Do you think it is important?  
• Do you think if you had more guidance on using li fe expectancy in conversations with patients, it 
would be easier?  
• How do you estimate your older patients’ life expectancy? (website, took, personal estimation)  
 
 
Topic 3: Communicating risks and benefits of surveillance mammography?  
• When discussing surveillance mammography, which topi[INVESTIGATOR_905883]?  
o Do you typi[INVESTIGATOR_905884]?  
o How do you discuss this?  
o If you don’t typi[INVESTIGATOR_905885], how do you 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_905886]?  
• Do you use any tools to help such as aids, graphics, etc. to help discuss mammography?  
PROTOCOL TITLE:  
 Page 32 of 65  
 
Topic 4: Communication tool review (pass out the tool [draft in  Appendix 1] for review to the 
group) This tool is meant to provide breast cancer survivors and their clinicians a framework for 
discussions on cessation of mammography, incorporating risks and benefits of surveillance 
mammography, information on life expe ctancy, and to help with decisions about mammography.  
• What are your initial impressions of this tool?  
• What do you think about the amount  of information this tool contains?  
• What do you think about the content/information  found in this tool?  
o How about the way risks and benefits are displayed?  
o How do you feel about how the information regarding life expectancy is displayed?  
• What do you think of the tool design? (layout, photos, colors, fonts, etc.)  
• Are you comfortable with the language used in the tool?  
• Coul d you envision using this tool in your discussions with patients? Why/why not?  
• Do you anticipate any barriers to incorporating this into your work?  
• How do you think the patients would react to receiving this handout?  
• How do you think the life expectancy co mponent looks and will go with patients?  
• How would you like to access this tool?  ( Probe : embedded in an electronic medical record or 
web-based rather than paper)  
 
Topic 5: Communication between primary care and oncology clinicians  
We also are exploring wa ys that follow up care can be better coordinated between oncology and primary 
care clinicians.  
• From your perspective, what issues are most important to consider when trying to improve 
communication around patient care and cessation of mammography between these patients?   
• Do you think this tool could help communication between disciplines?  
• What othe r ideas do you have about how to improve care coordination to promote unified 
messaging about use of surveillance mammography and other follow up care?

APPENDIX E: VERBAL CONSENT  FOR THE PATIENT PHONE INTERVIEWS  
AND FOCUS GROUPS  
 
Hi and thanks for participating in this interview today. I’m from Dana -Farber Cancer 
Institute and we’re doing a study on how we can better approach mammography in older 
breast cancer survivors. We’ve ask ed you to participate in this discussion because we’d like 
to hear your p erspectives on your experiences and how you feel about this topic .  This 
project is funded by a grant from the National Cancer Institute .  
 
I’d like to start off by [CONTACT_905918]. I’m [name [CONTACT_375271]]. I’ll be conducting this 
interview and will be recording  our discussion. As was mentioned to you when you were 
invited to participate , we will audio tape this session. We are doing this to make sure that 
we remember everything that you say. Your comments are really important to us. The tapes 
are confidential information. Your name [CONTACT_905929]. The tapes will be  listened to only by [CONTACT_905919] (the person who will type what is on the tape). 
Once the recordings have been typed and the data analyzed, we will erase the tapes. All 
records of the discussions will be kept in a locked file. Only the researchers will have 
access to these records. Any results of your  interview and those of other women (including 
the views of you and other women) will be reported or published as a group  and will not be 
associated with any ident ifiers.  
 
Everything that you say is confidential and will not be shared with anyone other than the  
research staff. Therefore, I want to encourage you to speak openly about your ideas. There 
are no right or wrong answers. The goal is to hear your views and experiences to fully 
understand  how you feel on the topi[INVESTIGATOR_905890] . We expect that you will find the 
questions generally easy to answer, but if you find that any parts of the discussion are 
upsetting, you can ask the interviewers to move on. If you  experience any distress during or 
after the discussion, please let us know and we will refer you to your doctor or nurse for 
follow -up care.  
 
This is a voluntary activity. Today’s discussion will last about 30-[ADDRESS_1271759]. We will mail you a  $[ADDRESS_1271760] after you complete the  interview. Thank you so much for agreeing to participate . .  
 
Are you ready to begin? [Then start recording and begin interv iew]

AIM 1.2 ( PI[INVESTIGATOR_905891] ) 
 
Dear potential p articipant:  
 
I’m from Dana -Farber Cancer Institute and we’re working on a research study  that looks to 
improve how we follow patients with breast cancer who are 7 5 and older. We’ve asked you 
to participate because we’d like to hear your perspectives on your experiences on this topic .  
This project is funded by a grant from the National Cancer  Institute . We will be calling you 
in the next week or so to review the information provided here to see if you are interested 
in participating. Your participation is completely voluntary. We have also enclosed a phone 
number and email  address in case you want to let us know ahead of time that you are 
interested or not interested in participating. If we do not hear back from you, we will call 
you to introduce you to this study and review this form again.  
 
Purpose: Our goal is to d evelop a communication tool that will provide  recommendations 
for clinicians and patients for surveillance mammography and follow -up care for breast 
cancer survivors  over the age of 75.  Specifically, this tool will help prevent over screening 
breast cancer  survivors by [CONTACT_905920] -up care. With your 
permission, we will provide you with an information sheet about mammograms. We will 
then ask you to answer some questions about your breast cancer, your intention s for  
mammography  before and after your next follow -up visit at Dana -Farber , and your decision -
making and  your experiences.   
 
Procedures: This is a two-time survey  that will occur before and after your upcoming Dana -
Farber follow -up appointment and will take approximately 20-30 minutes  in total . You can

[CONTACT_648]. You are free to skip any questions you do not wish to answer or end the survey  at any 
time. At this time, we  are also asking for your consent to review your medical record. The 
medical record review is an important part of this study because we can confirm information 
about your cancer, the treatments you may or may not have received, as well demographic 
data su ch as your age. Only members of the study team will have access to the information 
in medical records.  When we finish the surveys, we will arrange for a $[ADDRESS_1271761] to be sent 
to you.

Are mammograms still right for me?  
 
Goal of the Project  
Breast cancer is a disease of aging. With our aging U.S. population, 
we will see more breast cancers in o lder patients. However, older 
patients are often not included in clinical trials  that guide our care. This 
is part of the reason why there are  still many unanswered questions 
about how we should follow older breast cancer survivors over time .  
The goal of this study is to better understand when it may be the right 
time to stop mammograms in breast cancer survivors over time –as 
patients age –and how to have these conversations with them. The 
benefits of mammograms become less as people age, while the risks 
of the test, such as false alarms, may increase .  
 
What We are Asking  from You  
We have created an information tool to help women decide on whether 
having a mammogram is still right for them. We have also crafted a set 
of recommendations regarding getting a mammogram test. Now we 
would like to share this information with you to get your opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649].  
Would you be available to discuss the tool and our recommendations 
with us? This would take about 45 minutes over the phone, for a one -
on-one interview. You  could also attend one of our focus group 
sessions in which a group of 6 to 8 people would get together to review 
all the information and tell us what they think.  
In appreciation of your time, we would provide a $[ADDRESS_1271763] at the 
end of the interview.   
If you are interested, please let us know. We hope to hear from you!

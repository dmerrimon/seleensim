FHCRC current version: 10/10/2017  2 2. Introduction   
 
Patients with advanced lymphoma, multiple myeloma (MM), or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have 
poor curative treatment options. High dose therapy followed by [CONTACT_496734] 
(HCT) has been shown to be of benefit for patients with chemotherapy -sensitive relapsed lymphoma and 
multip le myeloma (MM) with 3 -year disease -free survival (DFS) in the range of 30 -65%. [1-7] Among 
lymphoma patients with chemotherapy -resistant or untested relapse, DFS ranged between 0 -13%. [1,8-12] 
Simila rly, patients with MM, though had survival prolongation compared with chemotherapy, eventually 
relapsed and died. [13] Limited data are available on the long - term efficacy of autologous HCT for CLL 
patients. [14-16] 
 
Allogeneic HCT after myeloablative conditioning resulted in prolonged remissions and low relapse rates for 
advanced lymphoma, MM, and CLL; but on the expense of relatively high (up to 60%) non -relapse mortality (NRM) 
even among patients younger than 50 years and with good performance status (PS). [16-20] Our nonmyeloablative 
conditioning regimen of 2 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) alone or with 90 mg/kg of fludarabine before allogeneic 
HCT have resulted in lessened NRM among a cohort of patients at least [ADDRESS_638551] with evidence of control of many hematological malignances. [21-28]  
 
Clinical studies at our institution have shown that nonmyeloablative allografts from HLA -related or unrelated 
donors for MM were most effective w hen performed in patients with low tumor burden. Cytoreductive 
autografts performed 40 -120 days before nonmyeloablative allografts significantly improved CR rates without 
increasing the low NRM rates seen with nonmyeloablative allografts alone.  [21,28]  A more recent prospective 
study using Mendelian randomization suggested superior overall survival among patients with newly diagnosed 
MM after t reatment with one autologous HCT followed by [CONTACT_496735] -identical 
sibling donors compared to those given tandem autografts.  This approach allowed temporal separation between 
the high dose conditioning and the GVT effects with NRM of 18% [29]. The same approach has been used for 
patients with advanced aggressive B cell malignancies with NRM and OS of 16% and 55% at 3 -years, 
respectively (protocol 1409 and unpublished results).  
 
Nevertheless, the chance of the patient’s sibling to be HLA genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_496675] 25%. The chances of 
finding suitabl y phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_496676] 60 -70% for Caucasians to <10% for ethnic 
minorities. [30,31]  [32] Recently, investigators at John Hopkins Medical School ( Protocol #J9966) and FHCRC 
(Protocol #1667.00) have used nonmyeloablative conditioning with 2 Gy TBI and fludarabine, 150 mg/m2, in 
addition to cyclophosphamide administered before and after HLA -haploidentical related HCT to facilitate 
engraftment and delete alloreactive donor T -cell clones presumably involved in GVHD. Sixty -eight patients with 
advanced hematological malignancies have been studied. While NRM was relatively low at 1 -year (19%), the rate of 
relapse was 50% at 1 -year resulting in overall survival (OS) and DFS rates of 4 5% and 32%, respectively. [33] 
 
Here, we propose to explore the tand em approach of cytoreductive autologous HCT followed by [CONTACT_496736] -haploidentical related donors for patients with relapsed/refractory MM, lymphoma, or CLL. We 
hypothesize that the high dose chemotherapy and/or myeloablative TBI precedin g the autologous HCT will provide 
powerful cytoreduction and achieve a state of minimal disease. This will be augmented [ADDRESS_638552] approach while preserving the low NRM associated with nonmyeloablative conditioning resulting in 
improved DFS in patients with advanced lymphoma, MM, or CLL.  
 
FHCRC 2241.00   
FHCRC current version: 10/10/[ADDRESS_638553]  
 1. Lymphoma or CLL pat ients  
 
Several different conditioning regimens involving chemotherapy +/ - TBI have been used before 
autologous HCT of patients with lymphoma or CLL. [34-36] Cy/TBI or BEAM given as proposed in 
this protocol should provide cytoreduction for refractory or relapsed lymphoma or CLL while being well 
tolerated, with rapid recovery allowing patients to the HLA -haploidentical allograft.  
  
The Cy/TBI conditioning regimen for autologous HCT has proven effective and resulted in high 
response rates (60 -80%) and low NRM (in the range of 1 -9%) in patients with refractory and relapsed 
lympho ma. Three -year DFS has ranged from 27 to55% suggesting that relapse remains the greatest 
cause of treatment failure. [5,37,38]  Similar to results after Cy/TBI, 100 day NRM after BEAM ranged 
between 2.7 to10%, while  3-year DFS ranged from 40 to 62%. [10-12,39 -42] The majority of clinical 
trials with autologous HCT for patients with CLL have investigated CY/TBI conditioning [16,43 -46] 
and one trial investigated Cy/TBI and BEAM [47] with similar incidences of NRM to that seen in 
patients with lymphoma (range 0 -9%).  
 
To date, however, no comparative randomized trials have been performed comparing regimens In 
general, a transplant center’s choice of regimen i s based on experience with the regimens through local 
or national clinical trials. [36] We have elected, based on our experience, to use either 
cyclophosphamide and TBI (Cy/TBI), or BEAM for conditioning before autologous HCT. Use of either 
regimen for each enrolled patient will be decided by [CONTACT_079] (P I) with preference for 
BEAM in patients who have previously received dose -limiting radiation or have high comorbidity 
scores.  
 
No randomized trials have compared conditioning with chemotherapy alone to chemotherapy + TBI for 
autologous HCT for relapsed ly mphoma or CLL and the optimal approach remains undetermined. In 
general, a transplant center’s choice of regimen is based on experience with the regimens through local 
or national clinical trials. [36] Retrospective reviews showed no differences in outcomes. [48-51] 
However, subset analyses have identified two main limitatio ns for the use of TBI -based conditioning 
regimens, one is the hazard of delivering TBI to patients who have received dose limiting radiation to 
vital organs. [52] The second limitation is the burden of pretransplant comorbidities, as summarized by 
[CONTACT_102937] -specific comorbidity index (HCT -CI) [53], where patients with scores of ≥3 experienced 2 -
year NRM of 25% versus 5% after TBI -based versus BE AM regimens, respectively. [54]  
We have elected, based on our experien ce, to use either cyclophosphamide and TBI (Cy/TBI), or BEAM 
for conditioning before autologous HCT. Use of either regimen for each enrolled patient will be decided 
by [CONTACT_496737] (PI) with preferenc e for BEAM in 
patients who have previously received dose -limiting radiation [52] or have high comorbidity scores.  
[54]  
 
2. MM patients  
 
High -dose therapy with autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for advanced -stage 
myeloma in patients less than 65 years of age has survival advantages compared with conventional 
therapy. [6,55]  In the Intergroupe Francais du Myélome (IFM) 90 trial, not only the CR rate, but the 7-
year DFS of 16% and OS of 43% were higher than those (8% and 25%) with conventional 
chemotherapy, respect ively. [6,7]  With high response rates and relatively low NRM of less than 10%, 
fewer than 30% of patients remain in remission 3 to 7 years later. [56-62] While a number of 
conditioning regimens have been used, melphalan at 200 mg/m2 has been well tolerated, even in patients 
FHCRC 2241.00   
FHCRC current version: 10/10/2017  4 in their seventh decade of life, [63-65] and has generally been accepted as the current standard. [64] 
Conditioning with melphalan at 140 mg/m2 will be reserved for patients older than 70 years, or those 
with significant renal insufficiency, or high comorbidity scores . 
 
B. Tandem autograft/ nonmyeloablative allograft with HLA -matched donors  
 
Initially, nonmyeloablative allografts from HLA -matched related donors were used to treat 13 patients 
with relapsed/refractory MM. This resulted in relatively low NRM (2 patients),  while 54% developed 
progressive disease. In a subsequent MM -specific protocol (#1383), the combination of a cytoreductive 
autograft using 200 mg/m2 melphalan with nonmyeloablative allograft was explored. Fifty four patients 
were enrolled in this tandem ap proach. [21] Median age was 52 (range 29 -71) years, and 48% of 
patient s had relapsed or refractory disease at time of HCT. Patients experienced medians of 0 days of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. With a median follow up of 552 days, OS was 78%. 
Overall response rate was 83% and 57% were in CR. A recent u pdate included 102 patients treated with 
the same approach with median follow up of 5 years. [29] Thirty -four percent of patients had chemo -
refractory disease at time of HCT. Grades II -IV and III -IV acute GVHD were seen in 41% and 8% of 
patients respectively, while 69% had extensive chronic GVHD. Cumulative incidences of NRM a t 100 
days, 1 -year, and 5 -year were 1%, 13%, and 19%, respectively. Overall response rate was 94% (63% 
were in CR). The 5 -year rates of OS and PFS were 63% and 35%, respectively. These results suggested 
that the low NRM after either transplant modality cou ld be preserved by [CONTACT_496738]. Longer 
follow up is required to determine the durability of the observed high response rates.  
 
Investigators from Italy have shown that planned tandem autografts/ nonmyeloablative allografts from 
HLA -matched related donors were associated with superior outcomes compared to tandem autografts. 
[66] In this trial 162 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed myeloma were enrolled. All patients 
were initially treated with vi ncristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (VAD), followed by [CONTACT_496739] -cell rescue. Patients with HLA -identical siblings then received 
nonmyeloablative HCT, while those without HLA -identical siblings received a second autologo us HCT. 
With a median follow -up of 45 months, the median OS and DFS were longer in the 80 patients with 
HLA -identical siblings than in the 82 patients without HLA -identical siblings (80 months vs. 54 months, 
P=0.01; and 35 months vs. 29 months, P=0.02, res pectively). Among patients who completed their 
assigned treatment protocols, NRM was comparable among recipi[INVESTIGATOR_496677] -autologous -
transplant group (46 patients) and the autograft -allograft group (58 patients, P=0.09), but disease -related 
mortality was significantly higher in the double -autologous -transplant group (43% vs. 7%, P<0.001). 
The authors concluded that among patients with newly diagnosed myeloma, survival in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22880] a 
tandem autologous/allogeneic HCT from HLA -identical siblings was s uperior to that of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_496678].  
 
The tandem autologous/ nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT from HLA -matched unrelated dono rs was 
explored in [ADDRESS_638554] had higher overall response rate (77% compared to 18%, respectively, p=0.01). 
PFS was 51% compared to 11%, respectively ( p=0.03).  
 
The tandem autologous -related HCT approach is also being investigated in the setting of lymphoma/CLL. 
To date, [ADDRESS_638555] from HLA -matched related (n=25) or unrelated donors (n=8).  Diagnoses 
were NHL (n=22), HL (n=7), or CLL (n=4). Median patient age was 49 years and number of prior regimens 
was 4 (range 1 -12). Thirty -six percent of patients had disease responsive to the last chemotherapy before 
autografting [6% were in complete rem ission (CR)] while 46% and 18% had refractory and progressive 
FHCRC 2241.00   
FHCRC current version: 10/10/[ADDRESS_638556] patients had aggressive disease (82%). Conditioning for autografts consisted of 
BEAM (48%) or Cy/12 Gy TBI (52%). At allografting, 52% of patients had CR/PR (15%/37%) , 12% stable 
disease, 3% relapse, and 33% refractory disease. After allogeneic HCT, 24 patients became neutropenic for 
a median of 13 days and 23 patients had thrombocytopenia (<20,000 cells/ul) for a median of 5 days. All 33 
patients had sustained engraft ment. Incidences of grades II, III, and IV acute GVHD were 44%, 19%, and 
0% respectively, and chronic GVHD was 51%. With median follow up of 39 (range 10 -87) months, the 
overall response rate was 63% (51% CR). Estimated 2 -year rates of non -relapse mortalit y, relapse, overall, 
and progression -free survivals from the time of autografting were 16%, 38%, 55%, and 47% respectively.  
 
C. John Hopkins and FHCRC experience of nonmyeloablative conditioning and HLA -haploidentical 
HCT  
 
Pre-clinical data from a mouse mo del of H -[ADDRESS_638557] was synergistic with fludarabine in preventing graft rejection and 
increasing the percent of donor chimerism. [67, 68]  In addition, post transplantation Cy attenuated lethal 
and non -lethal GVH reactions. [67] Based on these data, two subsequent clinical trials were initiated for 
treatment of patients with high -risk hematological malignancies  with nonmyeloablative HCT from 
related, HLA -haploidentical donors (Protocol J9966, Johns Hopkins and 1667 at FHCRC). Conditioning 
regimen was modified from the regimen developed by [CONTACT_496740] [69] and is detailed in 
Figure 1. Preliminary results demonstrated that partially HLA -mismatched bone marrow can en graft 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_496679] -transplantation Cy. [70] 
 
A recent update of the results of these two trials incorporated 68 consecutive patients diagnosed with 
poor risk hematological malignancies except for one patient with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. 
{Luznik, O'Do nnell, et al. 2008 [ZIP_CODE] /id} Patients were treated on two protocols (Protocol J9966, 
Johns Hopkins and 1667 at FHCRC), which differed by [CONTACT_496741].  
Twenty -one patients (31%) had failed at least one autologous HCT: 12 of 13 patients wi th HL, 4 of 10 
patients with NHL, 3 of 27 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and one patient each with CLL 
and MM. Twenty -five percent of patients were from ethnic minority groups. Half (33 of 68) of the 
donors were siblings of patients, and about  a quarter each were either parents or children (19 of 68 and 
16 of 68, respectively). Donors and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_496680] a median of [ADDRESS_638558]-versus -graft (HVG) and GVH directions.  
 
Median times to neutrophil and platelet 
recoveries were 15 and 24 days, 
respectively. Graft rejections occurred in 9 
of 66 evaluable patients (13%). All but 1 
patient with graft failure experienced 
recovery of autologous hematopoiesis. 
Among engrafting pat ients, achievement 
of full donor chimerism was rapid and 
>95% by 2 months after transplantation.  
 
The median number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496681] 60 was 1 (range: 0 -4), and the 
median length of stay was 4 days (range: 
0-66). Neutropenic fever accounted  for 51% of the admissions, nonneutropenic infections accounted for 
22%, aGVHD accounted for 9%, and other causes were the reason for the remaining 19% of admissions. 
A total of 22 patients (32%) did not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496682] 60 days of transplantation.

FHCRC current version: 10/10/2017  6 CMV reactivation was observed in 17 of 45 (38%) high -risk patients with a median time to reactivation 
of 34 days. Acute GVHD was present in 7 patients on or about the time of CMV reactivation. There 
were no cases of CMV pneumonia and ther e was no CMV -associated mortality. Proved or probable 
invasive mold infections posttransplant, all caused by [CONTACT_207106], were observed in 5 of 68 (7%) 
patients. Two patients died from Aspergillus infection: 1 while persistently neutropenic following gr aft 
failure, and 1 with fungal sinusitis.  
 
The probabilities of 
grades II -IV and 
III-IV acute GVHD 
by [CONTACT_4475] 200 were 
34% and 6%, 
respectively (Figure 
2A). There was no 
statistically 
significant 
difference in the 
probability of acute 
GVHD between 
patients who  
received 1 versus 2 
doses of 
posttransplantation 
Cy. However, 
Figure 2B shows 
that the incidence of 
extensive cGVHD 
at 1 year in the group of patients who received 2 doses of posttransplantation Cy (5%) was suggestively 
lower than the incidence of extensi ve cGVHD in the group of patients who received 1 dose of 
posttransplantation Cy (25%; hazard ratio [HR] 0.21; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04 -1.01; P = .05).

FHCRC 2241.00   
FHCRC current version: 10/10/2017  7 The probabilities of 
NRM at 100 days 
and at 1 year after 
transplantation 
were 4% and 15%, 
respectively, and 
the probabilities of 
relapse at 1 and 2 
years after 
transplantation 
were  51% and 58%, 
respectively ( 3A). 
There was no 
statistically 
significant effect of 
the dose of 
posttransplantation 
Cy on either NRM 
or relapse (data not 
shown). Patients 
with lymphoid malignancies had a significantly lower risk of relapse than patients with my eloid 
malignancies (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.30 -0.97, P = .04), suggesting efficacy of the GVL effect in patients 
with lymphoid malignancies.   
 
At a median follow -up among survivors of 745 days (range: 112 -1483 days), the actuarial OS at 1 and at 
2 years was 46%  and 36%, respectively (Figure 3B). The actuarial EFS at 1 and at 2 years was 34% and 
26%, respectively (Figure 3B). OS and EFS were not statistically significantly different between groups 
(data not shown). Causes of death included disease progression (n= 31), GVHD (n=2), infection (n=4), 
and other causes (n=5).  
 
 Overall, 10 patients diagnosed with indolent or aggressive NHL were enrolled in these trials (O’Donnell 
P, 2007, Personal communications). Median number of prior regimens was [ADDRESS_638559], respectively. {Burroughs, O'Donnell, et al. 2008 [ZIP_CODE] /id}  Fifty -two percent of 
haploidentical recipi[INVESTIGATOR_496683]/refractory disease a t time of HCT, which was higher than that 
among related recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (21%) and comparable to the percentage among unrelated recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (46%). 
Haploidentical recipi[INVESTIGATOR_496684] 31 years and 14% of patients had bulky disease, 62% had 
HCT -CI scores of  ≥3, 57% had >5 prior regimens, 90% failed prior autologous HCT, and none of these 
characteristics differ from those among related or unrelated recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. OS rate at 18 -months among 
haploidentical recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (71%) was comparable to that among unrelated re cipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (74%) but superior to 
that among related recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (47%, p=0.009). This was mainly due to exceptionally low cumulative 
incidences of NRM at 18 months among both haploidentical (5%) and unrelated recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (8%) 
compared to that among related reci pi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (25%, p=0.02). Relapse rates were relatively high among the

FHCRC 2241.00   
FHCRC current version: 10/10/2017  8 three patient groups (39%, 56%, and 55%, respectively), which leaves room for improvement of relapse 
rate among haploidentical recipi[INVESTIGATOR_496685] 
76% of those patients had active disease at HCT.  
 
Three patients aged, 56, 71, and [ADDRESS_638560]. This is unfortunate since the median age of patients with NHL, MM, or CLL 
ranges between 60 and 70 years, [71,72]  suggesting that the majority of those patients are excluded from 
curative treatment clinical trials. Limited data are available on the feasibility and efficacy of autolog ous 
HCT in patients above 60 years. Comorbidities are more common in elderly patients where i ndividuals who 
are older than 65 years suffer on average from three different diseases. [73] Similarly, older cancer patients 
presented high levels of comorbidity. Comorbidities could be, in part, responsible for the poor tolera nce of 
some elderly cancer patients to intensive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_496686].  
 
We have recently evaluated impact of comorbidities on outcomes of [ADDRESS_638561]. [54] Median age was [ADDRESS_638562] -CI scores of >0, were found among 65% of patients, of whom 26% had scores of 3 -4 
and 4% scores ≥5. Several pretransplant risk factors were tested in Univariate and then multivariate analyses 
for their impacts on outcomes . Interestingly, only age ≥[ADDRESS_638563] -CI scores of ≥3 were associated 
with increased risk for NRM in Univariate analysis. However, when all factors were entered into a Cox 
regression model, age ≥[ADDRESS_638564] a statistically significant impac t on NRM ( p=0.73) or OS 
(p=0.73), while comorbidities significantly impacted NRM ( p=0.0009) and OS ( p<0.0001). The non -
significant impact of age persisted after resetting the age cut -off to ≥50 years. Patients with scores 3 -4 and 
≥5 had NRM of 15% and 42% and OS of 57% and 25%, respectively, compared to NRM of 3% and 8% and 
OS of 80% and 78% among patients with scores of 0 and 1 -2, respectively. Of note, 8 patients in this cohort 
were aged >70years with upper limit of [ADDRESS_638565], 
respectively. Five patients are currently alive after a median follow up of 740 (range: 441 -1187) days. These 
findings suggest that biological rather than chronological age should be considered  for eligibility for 
autologous HCT.  
 
Age per se does not seem to affect progenitor cell yield or success of mobilization in NHL or MM patients. 
[74-76] Several recent reports summarized outcomes of MM or NHL  patients aged >60 years and given 
intensive chemo/radiotherapy and autologous HCT (Table 1). For NHL patients, NRM was in the range of 
5-10%. [54] For MM patients, low incidences of NRM have been reported (range of 0 -5%) even after 
melphalan of 200 mg/m2. [76] 
 
The use of nonmyeloablative conditioning before allogeneic HCT has extended the eligibility of this 
treatment option to patients above [ADDRESS_638566] will be determined by [CONTACT_496742].

FHCRC 2241.00   
FHCRC current version: 10/10/2017  10 4. Objectives  
 
A. Proposal:  
Patients with chemotherapy -resistant or bulky lymphoma, high -risk MM, or fludarabine -refracto ry CLL 
have limited curative treatment options. The use of GVL effects is one way of eradicating residual and 
chemotherapy -resistant disease.  However, there are two potential problems. One is high NRM following 
conventional, myeloablative allogeneic HCT. The other is the unavailability of HLA -matched related or 
unrelated donors (for about 30% of patients) or the lack of time to identify unrelated donors due to rapid 
disease progression. Allogeneic HCT from HLA -haploidentical related donors following 
nonmye loablative conditioning with [ADDRESS_638567] -transplantation 
immunosuppression with high dose Cy, tacrolimus, and thrice daily MMF was associated with acceptably 
low incidences of fatal graft rejection (2%), severe opportunistic infection s (8%), severe acute GVHD 
(10%), and chronic extensive GVHD (22%) while allowing prompt engraftment (82%). However, relapse 
rates were 50% at 1 year resulting in 1 year EFS of 32%. We hypothesize that by [CONTACT_2931] a tandem 
approach of autologous high -dose H CT used for cytoreduction followed [ADDRESS_638568], we can capture the benefits of high -dose autografting and 
HLA - haploidentical allografting (GVL effects). This approach would preserve the low GVHD and NRM 
observed after nonmyeloablative HLA -haploidentical HCT, while lowering the rate of relapse resulting in 
improved EFS.  
 
B. Primary objectives  
1. EFS at 1 -year after autograft.  
C. Secondary objectives  
1. Relapse rates at 1 -year after autograft.  
2. OS at 1-year after autograft.  
3. Incidence of grades II -IV acute GVHD and chronic extensive GVHD  
4. NRM at 200 days and 1 year after allograft  
5. Donor engraftment at day +84  
6. Incidence of infections

      blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) could be used as stem cell source, after clearance with the  
      FHCRC principal investigator , in the case of difficulties or contra indications to bone marrow  
      harvest from the donor.         
7. Cross -over to other tandem autologous -allogeneic research protocol (#1409  or other appropriate 
protocol ) will be allowed if a suitable HLA -matched related or unrelated donor is identified  before 
receiving the allogeneic transplantation and if the patient meets the eligibility criteria of the 
subsequent study.   
8. Cross -over from other tandem autologous -allogeneic research protocol (#1409  or other appropriate 
protocol ) will be allowed if t he patient loses the suitable HLA -matched related or unrelated donor

FHCRC 2241.00   
FHCRC current version: 10/10/2017  13 7. Evaluation and Counseling of Patient and Donor  
 
A conference with the patient and family will be held to discuss this study and alternative treatments available for 
the treatment of lymphoma, MM, or CLL. The conferences will be conducted by [CONTACT_496746]. All potential risks associated with the use of melphalan, Cy, TBI, BEAM, fludarabine, 
immunosuppressive drugs, and autologous and allogeneic transplantation should be discussed as obj ectively as 
possible to the patients or, in the case of minors, to the patient's responsible family members. It should be 
explained that patients offered this protocol have high -risk disease. Transplant -related risk of autologous and 
conventional allogenei c HCT for MM, lymphoma, or CLL; and poor disease control seen with non -myeloablative 
HCT without preceding cytoreduction should be described as the rationale for this trial.  
Informed consent from the patient and the donor will be obtained using forms appro ved by [CONTACT_496747]. A summary of the conference will be dictated for 
the medical record detailing what was covered.  
 
8. Protocol Registration  
 
 A. FHCRC patients: Eligible patients will be identified by [CONTACT_496748] (206 -667-4728) between 8:30  am and 4:00 pm, Monday 
through Friday. After hours, the Registration Office can be reach by [CONTACT_183627] (206) 995 -7437.  
 
B. Col laborating institutions:  Eligible patients will be identified by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_496691]. Registration 
will include completion of the eligibility checklist /demographic form (Appendix J). This form and a copy 
of the signed informed consent will be faxed to (206 -667-5378). Questions regarding eligibility or 
protocol information should be directed to Michelle Bouvier, R.N., Research Nurse (206 -667-6993)  
 
9. Pl an of Treatment  
 
A. Conventional Cytoreductive Therapy  
Cytoreduction will be given to select patients with advanced disease prior to HCT to reduce tumor bulk. 
The need for cytoreductive therapy will be determined on clinical grounds by [CONTACT_496749]. Therapy may be given prior to arriving at the transplant center by [CONTACT_332205]. Cytoreduction can be performed with any appropriate therapy for NHL, HL, Waldenstrom’s 
Macroglobulinemia, CLL, MM, or plasma cel l leukemia . The choice of therapy will depend on prior 
regimens and the current disease status and may be selected at the discretion of the attending physician 
and/or the referring physician. In general, cytoreductive therapy should be given to patients wi th bulky 
disease.  
 
B. CNS prophylaxis  
Patients at high risk for CNS disease will receive a diagnostic lumbar puncture  per standard practice 
guidelines . Patients with history of CNS disease or positive lumbar puncture pre -transplant, will have 
instillation of IT MTX 12 mg on 2 occasions prior to transplant (between days -20 to -3) and 4 -6 
occasions after engraftment starting approximately day 32 and given every 14 days until completion. If the 
patient has an Ommaya Reservoir, the dose should be 6 mg. The IT MTX schedule can be individualized 
for patients at high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_496692]. For other drug information, see 
section# 11.  
 
C. Ursodeoxycholic Acid Prophylaxis  
Patients will receive ursodeoxycholic acid prophylax is for hepatic complications per standard practice.  
 
FHCRC 2241.00   
FHCRC current version: 10/10/2017  14 D. Autografting  
 
1. Peripheral Blood Stem Cell (PBSC) mobilization  
Patients may have autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) mobilized and stored prior to 
enrollment on this protocol. If previously  stored PBSC are used on this protocol, patients proceed 
directly to autologous conditioning regimen [ADDRESS_638572]. For 
patients without previously stored stem cells, autologous PBSC may be mobilized and collected 
according to a vailable FHCRC or Outside Institution protocols (i.e. FHCRC 506), or on a 
treatment protocol at the discretion of the attending physician.  
 
2. PBSC collection  
The leukapheresis goal  will be  > 5x106 CD34+ cells/kg. Transplant will NOT be carried out 
unless >  2.5 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg are obtained . The principle investigator should be consulted for 
recommendations if mobilization is inadequate.  
At FHCRC, PBSC collections will be performed in the leukapheresis unit until the target dose of > 
4x106 CD34+ cells/kg  has been collected and cryopreserved. Leukapheresis will begin 24 hours 
after the WBC recovers to 1,000/μl  or by [CONTACT_421086]34 me asurement of >10 x 106 CD34+ 
cells/μl. Note that CD34 measurements more accurately correlate with higher CD34+ cell 
collections at the time of leukapheresis than does the WBC and should be used if available. 
Collections will last approximately [ADDRESS_638573] practice guidelines for t he platelet count 
prior to initiating  leukapheresis.  
 
3. Conditioning regimens  
Conditioning chemotherapy for the autologous PBS C transplant is begun after recovery from 
mobilization/cytoreductive therapy. This should occur no earlier than [ADDRESS_638574] of the following regimens:  
 
  1. Regimen 1: TBI 1200 cGy and Cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg IV.  
2. Regimen 2: BCNU 300 mg/m 2 IV, Etoposide 800 mg/m 2 IV, Ara -C 800 mg/m 2 IV, Melphalan 140 mg/m 2 
IV. 
 
*Patients with lymphoma, Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulinemia,  or CLL and no dose limiting radiation or 
significant comorbidities will receive Regimen 1. Others receive Regimen 2.  Selection of the appropriate 
regimen is the discretion of the attending phy sician after discussing with the PI.  
 
     3. Regimen 3: Melphalan 200 mg/m2 
     4. Regimen 4: Melphalan 140 mg/m2 
 
*Patients with multiple myeloma or plasma cell leukemia with no significant renal insufficiency or other 
significant comorbidities will receive Regimen 3. Others receive Regimen 4.  Selection of the appropriate 
regimen is at the discretion of the attending physician after discussing with the PI.

common tubing or site with solutions containing sodium bicarbonate.  
 
Maintenance hydration : Follow standard practice guidelines.  
 
iii. Etoposide (VP -16, Vepesid):  
Dosage:  Etoposide 100 mg/m2 IV BID will be administered in 500 -1000 cc normal 
saline over 2 hours on autografting days -6, -5, -4, and -3 for a total dose of 800 
mg/m2. Etoposide may not be infused with sodium bicarbonate soluti ons.  
 
Availability, reconstitution and administration:  Etoposide is commercially available 
in 100 mg/5 ml, 150 mg/7.5 ml, 500 mg/25 ml or 1000 mg/50 ml sterile multiple 
FHCRC 2241.00   
FHCRC current version: 10/10/2017  17 dose vials. VP -16 should be diluted prior to use with either 5% Dextrose Injection, 
USP, or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, to give a final concentration of 0.2 
or 0.4 mg/ml. Precipi[INVESTIGATOR_496693] 0.4 mg/ml concentration. 
It is recommended that VP -16 solution be administered IV over 2 hours. However, 
a longer durat ion of administration may be used when infusing large volumes of 
fluid. VP -16 should not be infused rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375].  
 
Supportive Care:  Appropriate anti -emetics and sedatives should be given before the 
infusion begins. Before and 2 hours into the infusion, the patient is to receive 25 mg 
of diphenhydramine, and 100 mg of hydrocortisone to prevent allergic reactions. 
Normal saline plus 20 mEq KCL is to be continued at 2 liters/ m2/day. If necessary, 
diuretics may be given. Since in rare cases metabolic acidosis has been observed 
after high dose VP -16, additional NaHCO 3 may be added to hydration, though not 
infused while VP -16 is infusing.

5. Radiation Therapy  
No radiation therapy is to be permitted concurrent with administration of melphalan. When blood 
count recovery is adequate (ANC >1000 /uL, platelets > 80,000/uL) after the autologous 
transplant, radiation may be administered for the follo wing indications after consultation with the 
primary investigator and a radiation oncologist: (1) palliation of pain from bone lesions, (2) 
prevention of pathologic fractures, (3) relief of spi[INVESTIGATOR_496694], 
(4) progression  of solitary plasmacytomas of bone or solitary extramedullary plasmacytomas, or 
(5) bulky disease. A radiation oncology consultant in consultation with the attending physician will 
determine dose and duration of radiation to be administered. Radiation to t he liver or lungs should 
be avoided.  
 
  6. Antibiotic Prophylaxis  
 
a. All patients should receive prophylactic antibiotics when their granulocyte count is less 
than 500/mm3. Refer to standard practice in Appendix C.  
  
 b. All patients should receive prophy lactic Bactrim, Fluconazole  and Acyclovir for 
prophylaxis against pneumocystis car inii pneumonia, systemic fungal infection, VZV and 
HSV, respectively.  Refer to standard practice in Appendix C . 
 
c. Patients shedding CMV will receive prophylactic Ganciclov ir per standard practice in 
Appendix C.  
 
  7. Blood Products  
 
Only irradiated blood products should be infused (RBC's and platelets).  DO NOT  IRRADIATE 
PERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM CELLS.  CMV negative patients should receive only CMV 
negative or leukoreduced blood products.  
 
E. Nonmyeloablative HLA -haplo -identical HCT  
1. Pre-conditioning:  
Upon recovery from autologous HCT, between [ADDRESS_638581] autografting (preferably within 
60 days) patients will proceed to the nonmyeloablative allograft. If the interval exceeds 120 days, 
patients should be presented to PCC for discussion and approval.   
 
 
 
 
FHCRC 2241.00   
FHCRC current version: 10/10/2017  20 “Recovery” from autologous HCT will be defined as follows:  
a. Mucositis and gastrointestinal symptoms have resolved and TPN/ IV -hydration have 
been discontinued;  
b. Steroid treatment for autologous GVHD has been discontinued;  
c. LFTs, pulmonary and cardiac function are within the inclusion criteria for the initial 
autograft;  
d. No evidence of radiological progression of previously documented fungal infections 
following treatment of amphotericin B or active triazole;  
e. No detectable CMV -antigenemia;  
f. Patients who experienced CMV -infection/reactivation following autografting: 
Ganciclovir or Foscarnet therapy has been completed more than two weeks ago and patient 
remains CMV -antigenemia negative (ID should be consulted if CMV -antigenemia  
persists);  
g. Radiotherapy has been completed;  
 
Any patient who does not fulfill these criteria may be discussed with the principle 
investigator for recommendations as to the timing of the allograft.  
 
2. Venous access device:  
A double -lumen central venou s catheter will be required.  
 
3. Conditioning regimen : 
Treatment will be initiated in the outpatient department and patients will be admitted as medically 
necessary for control of transplant complications.  
 
a. Outline of treatment plan  (Scheduling is shown in Table 6A and 6B ):

b. Agent:  
 
Menstruating female patients should be placed on an anti -ovulatory agent prior to initiating 
the conditioning regimen.  
i. Fludarabine  will be administered by [CONTACT_12781]  30 minutes  on day -6 to 
day-2. The dose will be 30 mg/M 2 with dose -reduction for decreased creatinine 
clearance*:  
FHCRC 2241.00   
FHCRC current version: 10/10/2017  23  
Fludarabine dosage should be reduced as follows:  
 
CCr 46-60 ml/min, fludarabine = 24 mg/m2 
CCr 31-45 ml/min, fludarabine = 22.5 mg/m2 
CCr 21-30 ml/min, fludarabine = 19.5 mg/m2 
CCr <20 ml/min, fludarabine = 15 mg/m2 
 
*For adult patients, creatinine clearance may be estimated by [CONTACT_496752]:  
CCr = (140 – age) x IBW (kg) x 0.85 (for women) P Cr x 72 
For pediatric patients, a formal measurement of creatinine clearance should be 
performed.  
 
ii. Cyclophosphamide  (14.5 mg/kg Adjusted BW*, unless IBW>ABW, then ABW 
per Standard Prac tice Guidelines) will be administered as an IV infusion over [ADDRESS_638585] p ractice guidelines. For adult patients, hydration with normal 
saline at 3 cc/kg/hr iv will be started 2 hr prior to cyclophosphamide, then the rate 
will be reduced to 2 cc/kg/hr for [ADDRESS_638586] -cyclophosphamide. Mesna dose will be based on the 
cyclophosphamide dose being given. The total daily dose of Mesna is equal to 
100% of the total daily dose of cyclophosphamide. Ur ine output over [ADDRESS_638587] 3.0 cc/kg. Per 
standard practice guidelines , urine output must be maintained at 120mL over the 
first four hours post cyclophosphamide. Urine testing per institu tional guidelines  
will be performed prior to administration of cyclophosphamide and on the day 
following cyclophosphamide to monitor for hematuria. Hemorrhagic cystitis is a 
known complication of high -dose cyclophosphamide therapy. It is crucial that no 
immunosuppressive agents are given until [ADDRESS_638588]-transplant Cy. This includes corticosteroids as anti -emetics.  
 
*Adjusted BW = [(ABW – IBW) 0.25] + IBW  
 
iii. TBI (200 cGy)  will be given on day –1 at a rate of 6 -7 cGy/min per  
Standard Practice Guidelines.  
 
 
4. Bone marrow infusion  
 
All patients will receive infusion of a mononuclear cell (MNC) preparation of donor marrow on 
day 0. Red blood cell and plasma depletion will be done following the standard practice guidelines . 
Donor bone marrow will be harvested with a target yield of 4 x 108 nucleated cells/kg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_496695]. The minimum acceptable yield should be 1 x 108 nucleated cells/kg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_43223]. Yields of 
nucleated cells and MNC are about 25% and 85%, respectively. The CD34 and CD3 composition 
of allografts will be determined by [CONTACT_4133].  
  
 
FHCRC 2241.00   
FHCRC current version: 10/10/[ADDRESS_638589] from the donor.  
 
Donors who consent to PBMC donat ion will receive 5 daily doses of GCSF, 16 μg/kg/day by 
[CONTACT_496753] –5. PBMC’s will be collected in the afternoon of day -
1, stored at 4C overnight, and infused as soon as possible on day 0. If the collection on day –1 
contains  less than 5.0 X 106 CD34+ cells per kg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22593], a second collection will be 
performed the following morning and transfused on day 0. Quantitation of CD34 and CD3 cells 
will be performed by [CONTACT_496754]. For all patients, the target nu mber of CD34 cells 
to be infused should be 5 -6 X 106 cells per kg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22593]. PBSC in excess of 6.0 x 106 CD34 
cells/kg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_496696].  
 
6. Post -transplant immunosuppression  
a. Cyclophosphamide  
 
i. For patients receiving marrow as stem cell graft: A single dose of 
cyclophosphamide [50mg/kg Adjusted BW*, unless IBW>ABW, then ABW per 
Standard Practice Guidelines] will be given on day +3 after transplant (within 60-72 
hr of marrow infusion).  
ii. For patients receiving PBMC as stem cell graft: Two doses of Cyclophosphamide 
[50mg/kg Adjusted BW*, unless IBW>ABW, then ABW per Standard Practice 
Guidelines] will be given on Day [ADDRESS_638590] -transplant (between 60 and 72 hours after 
PBMC infusion) and on Day 4 posttransplant (approximately 24 hours after Day 3 
cyclophosphamide).  
 
Cyclophosphamide will be given as an IV infusion over [ADDRESS_638591]-transplant Cy. This includes corticosteroids as anti -emetics.  
 
b. Tacrolimus and MMF  
i. Starting on day +4  (Day +5 for PBMC  grafts) , tacrolimus will be given at a dose of 0.03 
mg/kg/d (for patients <30 kg) and 1mg/d (for patients >30kg) IV over 1 -2 hr and should be 
changed to a PO dosing schedule as tolerated once a therapeutic level (5 -15 ng/ml) is 
achieved. Serum levels of t acrolimus should be measured on day +8 and then weekly 
thereafter and the dose adjusted accordingly to maintain a level of 5 -15 ng/ml.  
 
Tacrolimus will be tapered after day +86 (adapted dose -reduction to be discontinued by [CONTACT_4475] 
+180) if there is no evidenc e of GVHD.  
 
ii. Starting on day +4  (day +5 for PBMC grafts) , MMF will be given orally at a dose of 15 
mg/kg tid. Doses will be rounded to the nearest 250 mg (capsules are 250 mg). If an 
observed toxicity related to MMF administration occurs in the clinical  judgment of the 
investigator, the MMF dose will be adjusted. Based on previous observations in patients 
after nonmyeloablative HSCT, the side effect most likely to occur will be neutropenia due 
to myelosuppression. Severe gastrointestinal toxicity such as  gastrointestinal hemorrhage 
FHCRC 2241.00   
FHCRC current version: 10/10/[ADDRESS_638592]. A thorough evaluation of neutropenia 
should occur including peripheral blood chimerism studies, marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_496697] (e.g. co -trimoxazole ). Dose adjustments will not be 
made for neutropenia unless it is severe or persists after day +21. In the rare event of 
gastrointestinal toxicity that requires medical intervention including medication for control 
of persistent vomiting or diarrhea that i s considered to be due to MMF, a 20% dose 
reduction will be made or the drug may be given IV at the same dose. For severe toxicity 
related to MMF (grade IV neutropenia refractory to G -CSF, severe refractory diarrhea, or 
overt gastrointestinal bleeding), th e MMF may be temporarily stopped. MMF should be 
restarted at 20% reduced dose when the underlying toxicity subsides. The discontinuation 
of MMF at any point should be discussed with the Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_496698] (CRF).  
 
MMF will be discontinued on day +35  if there is no GVHD . 
 
7. Modification of immunosuppression for early disease progression or relapse  
 
Guidelines provided in this section are for patients who demonstrate either (i) progression of stable 
disease present at the time of transplant or (ii) relapse of their underlying disease before 
discontinuation of immunosuppression has been completed. Sign ificant progression of disease is 
defined in Table [ADDRESS_638593] GVHD, immunosuppression should 
be di scontinued. Persistence of stable, underlying disease itself does not mandate accelerated 
reduction of immunosuppression.

• increase of  25% bone marrow involvement or  
• increase of  25% blood involvement (of lymphocyte count > 
50x103/µl) with clo nal B -cells (CLL)  
 
 
If there is no disease response 4 weeks after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_496699], patients may be considered for DLI (which is not part of this protocol) and further 
therapy as per institutional protocols for disease relapse or progression after allogeneic HCT.  
 
Patients deemed to be at high risk for graft rejection based on low donor chimerism may also be 
eligible for DLI (which is not part of this protocol) or a second allogeneic HCT on other protocols. 
In the setting of low donor chimerism without  evidence of disease progression, 
immunosuppression should be continued at full dose so that DLI on other protocols can be 
considered.  
 
8. Growth Factor Support  
 
Patients will receive G -CSF at 5 μg/kg/d [rounded to t he nearest vial size (300 μg or 480 μg )] IV 
or SC starting at day +4  (Day +5 for PBMC grafts) ,  and continuing until the ANC > 1000 /mm3 for 
[ADDRESS_638594] practice per Appendix C

FHCRC 2241.00   
FHCRC current version: 10/10/2017  41 11. Irradiation and Marrow Administration - Toxicities and Complications  
 
A. Total Body Irradiation : TBI will be given in one 2.0 Gy fraction at a rate of 6 -7 cGy/min. 
Dosimetry calculations are performed by [CONTACT_450439][INVESTIGATOR_541]. Refer to Standard Practice of the 
institution for information regarding administration, toxicity and complications.  
 
B. Fludarabine : 
 
1.  Description:  Fludarabine monophosphate is a purine antimetabolite that, after administration, 
undergoes rapid conversion in plasma to the nucleoside 2 -fluoro ara -A (F-araA). F -araA 
subsequently enters cells where it is phosphorylated to F -araATP and the monophosphate F -
araAMP.  Once activated, F -araATP inhibits DNA polymerase and ribonucleotide reductase. The 
monophosphate F -araAMP, once incorporated into DNA, is an effective DNA chain terminator. 
Following IV administration, the drug is met abolized to 2 -F-araA and widely distributed in 
tissues. 2 -F-araA is excreted primarily in urine and has a terminal elimination half -life of 7 -12 
hr. 
 
2.  Storage and Administration:  Fludarabine monophosphate is commercially available as a 50 
mg/vial which  is reconstituted with 2 ml of sterile water, resulting in a 25mg/ml solution. The 
desired dose is further diluted to concentrations of 0.04 -1 mg/ml in normal saline or 5% dextrose 
(50-100ml) for injection and will be administered by [CONTACT_12781] 30 mi nutes or longer. 
Fludarabine will be administered by [CONTACT_12781] 1 hr in a dose of 30 mg/m2/day on days -6 
to -2. 
 
3.  Side Effects and Toxicity:  Clinical toxicities of fludarabine monophosphate include: 
myelosuppression, primarily lymphopenia and gr anulocytopenia, alopecia, rash, dermatitis, 
nausea, vomiting, anorexia, stomatitis, diarrhea, somnolence, fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, 
mental status changes, cortical blindness, hepatocellular toxicity with elevation in serum 
transaminases, and intersti tial pneumonitis. These effects are reversible when the drug is 
discontinued.  Immunosuppression observed with the use of fludarabine increases the risk of 
infection which can be life -threatening  
 
C. Cyclophosphamide :  
 
1. Description:  Cyclophosphamide is an  alkylating agent which prevents cell division primarily 
by [CONTACT_12783] -linking DNA strands.  Cyclophosphamide is cell cycle non -specific.  
Cyclophosphamide is not stem cell toxic.  
 
2.  Storage and Administration:  Cyclophosphamide for injection is commercially available in 
[ADDRESS_638607] is 20 mg/ml.  The calculated dose wi ll be diluted further in 250 -500 
ml of Dextrose 5% in water.  Each dose will be infused over 1 -2 hr (depending on the total 
volume). It is crucial that no immunosuppressive agents are given until [ADDRESS_638608] -transplant Cy. Thi s includes corticosteroids as anti -emetics.  
 
3.  Side Effects and Toxicity:  Clinical toxicities of cyclophosphamide include alopecia, nausea 
and vomiting, headache and dizziness, hemorrhagic cystitis, cardiotoxicity, immunosuppression, 
myelosuppression, p ulmonary fibrosis, increased hepatic enzymes and syndrome of 
inappropriate anti -diuretic hormone (SIADH).  
FHCRC 2241.00   
FHCRC current version: 10/10/2017  42  D. Mesna  
 
1. Description:  Mesna is a prophylactic agent used to prevent hemorrhagic cystitis induced by 
[CONTACT_496757] (cyclophosphamide and ifos famide).  It has no intrinsic cytotoxicity 
and no antagonistic effects on chemotherapy.  Mesna binds with acrolein, the neurotoxic 
metabolite produced by [CONTACT_496757], to produce a non -toxic thioether and slows 
the rate o f acrolein formation by [CONTACT_12787] 4 -hydroxy metabolites of 
oxazaphosphorines.  
 
2. Storage and Administration:  Mesna is commercially available in 200 mg, 400 mg and 1000 
mg vials containing a 100 mg/ml solution. Each dose of mesna will be diluted further  in 50 
ml of normal saline to be infused over 15 min.  Mesna dose will be based on the 
cyclophosphamide dose being given.  The total daily dose of mesna is equal to 80% of the 
total daily dose of cyclophosphamide.  
 
3. Side Effects and Toxicity:  At the doses  used for uroprotection mesna is virtually non -toxic.  
However, adverse effects which may be attributable to mesna include nausea and vomiting, 
diarrhea, abdominal pain, altered taste, rash, urticaria, headache, joint or limb pain, 
hypotension and fatigue.  
 
E. Tacrolimus  
 
1.  Description:  Tacrolimus, also known as FK -506, is a macrolide immunosuppressive agent. 
Tacrolimus inhibits lymphocytes by [CONTACT_12789] a complex with FKBP -12, calcium, and calmodulin, 
leading to the decrease in the phosphatase activity of  calcineurin.  Calcineurin mediates the first 
intracellular signal required for T -cell activation after antigen recognition by [CONTACT_941] T -cell receptor.  
This drug is used with corticosteroids for prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients receiving 
allogeneic liver transplants and for prophylaxis of GVHD in the setting of HSCT. It is also used 
for immunosuppression after kidney, cardiac, pancreas, pancreatic islet cell and small bowel 
transplantation. This drug is well -absorbed orally. It is metabolized in the liver by [CONTACT_496758], but demethylation and hydroxylation have been proposed based on in vitro  studies. 
The metabolized products are excreted in the urine.  
 
2.  Storage and Administration:  Tacrolimus is commercially available in capsule form (0.5, 1.0 
and 5.0 mg) and as a sterile solution in 1 mL ampules (5 mg/mL) for IV administration.  
 
3.  Side Effects and Toxicity: Adverse reactions include tremor, headache, insomnia, nausea, 
diarrhea, hypertension, and renal dysfunction (hyperkalemia, increased BUN and creatinine).  
 
Drugs that may increase blood levels of tacrolimus include: macrolide antibiotics, antifungals 
(fluconazole and itraconazole), calcium channel blockers, cimetidine, danazol, 
methylpredniso lone and metocloprami de.  Drugs that may decrease blood levels of tacrolimus 
include: phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifamycins and the anti -fungal agent 
caspofungin.

F. Mycophenolate Mofetil   
 
1.  Description:   Mycophenolate Mofetil is the morpholinyl  ethyl  ester prodrug of the active 
immunosuppressant mycophenolic acid (MPA). This active metabolite is a noncompetitive, 
reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, particularly the type II isoform 
that is more prominent in activated lymphocytes. A s a result of the inhibition of de novo purine 
synthesis, proliferation of T - and B -lymphocytes is blocked and antibody production is inhibited.  
There are no pharmacokinetic interactions with ganciclovir, cotrimoxazole, oral contraceptives 
or cyclosporine . 
 
2.  Storage and Administration: MMF is commercially available in an oral and an intravenous 
formulation. The oral formulation is supplied in 250mg hard gelatin capsules and can be stored at 
room temperature. MMF for i.v. administration is supplied as a lyophilized powder in a glass vial 
containing the equivalent of 500mg.  
  
3.  Side effects and toxicity:  Side effect profiles include diarrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, allergic 
reactions, and vomiting. An increase in certain types of infection mainly from the herpes virus 
family (CMV, HSV & VZV) and candida has been reported.   MMF has been studied extensively 
among patients after nonmyeloablative HCT. Previous clinical studies in patients after allografting 
suggest that the principal adverse reactions associate d with the administration of MMF include nausea, 
vomiting, neutropenia, diarrhea, and on one occasion bloody diarrhea. In the setting of marrow 
transplantation, several etiologic factors may contribute to alterations in gastrointestinal and hematologic 
parameters.  MMF has an increased incidence of digestive system adverse events, including GI tract 
ulceration, and hemorrhage (3% of patients receiving MMF). GI tract perforations have rarely been 
observed. Most patients in these studies were also on other dr ugs known to be associated with these 
complications. Up to 2% of patients receiving MMF for prevention of rejection developed severe 
neutropenia (ANC <500). The development of neutropenia may be related to MMF itself, concomitant 
medications, viral infecti ons or some combination of these causes. MMF dose adjustments will be made if 
clinically indicated if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_443861], no other cause is thought to be responsible 
for the abnormality.  These adjustments should be discussed with th e principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_496711] (CRF). Dose adju stments are described 
in section  9E.6.h.  With the exception of hypophosphatemia there seems to be no difference in side 
effects between i.v. and  oral MMF administration and efficacy is the same with both 
administration routes.

H. Graft -versus -host disease (GVHD)  
 
The major toxicity of T -replete HSCT from related, HLA -haploidentical donors is GVHD. In the Phase 
II trial of cyclophosphamide -induced immunosuppression discussed above in Section 3 (Preliminary 
Results), cumulative incidence of grade II and grades III -IV GVHD were ─ and 10%, respectively. 
Chronic extensi ve GVHD was observed in 22% of patients. Mortality secondary to complications of 
GVHD therapy was 1/[ADDRESS_638609] resulted in these relatively l ow rates of the clinically 
significant GVHD.

13.   Guidelines for Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
 
 A. Monitoring the progress of trials and the safety of participants  
Protocol 2241 will become a multi -institutional clinical trial that is monitored by [CONTACT_1961] (PI), [CONTACT_496784], with oversight by a Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB), 
the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee  (DSM C) and the Institutional Review Board (IRB). The PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_496713] a minimum of [ADDRESS_638610] and the updated 
data are presented at Mixed Chimerism Meetings (includes co -investigators).  
 
Serious a dverse events are reported to the trial coordinator, the study nurse or directly to the PI. The trial 
coordinators at collaborating centers or the local PIs will fax an official report of a serious adverse event 
to the coordinating center (FHCRC) within ten days. The serious adverse event report is reviewed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Sorror. If the serious adverse event meets the FHCRC criteria for reporting then an official signed report 
is submitted to the FHCRC Institutional Review Office (IRO). All deaths, regardless of th e cause, are 
reported to the IRB. Protocol 2241 has a DSMB responsible for monitoring patient safety on this clinical 
trial. The DSMB meets twice a year and all outcome data is reviewed including all adverse events 
reported to the coordinating center (FHCR C) along with those officially reported to the FHCRC IRO. 
The DSMB confirms that the trial has met not any stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_496714]. A report from the DSMB is submitted to the FHCRC 
FHCRC 2241.00   
FHCRC current version: 10/10/2017  45 IRB as well as the trial coordinators/local PIs of this protocol. The DSMB will discontinue the review of 
outcomes when this protocol is closed to accrual.  Furthermore, the FHCRC also has a DSMC that 
reviews the progress of the protocol with respect to the  monitoring plan at the time of each annual 
renewal. As with initial review, annual IRB review and approval is also required.  
 
With respect to safety, patients are monitored for the development of graft versus host disease (GVHD), 
myelosuppression and inf ections.  All patients, regardless of diagnosis, will be considered in the safety 
analysis.  Because of the older age profile of the patients, complications of HSCT and donor lymphocyte 
infusions (DLI), primarily GVHD and infections, may be more severe tha n usually encountered. These 
events will be closely monitored and severity of GVHD graded. Formal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_496715]. 
Transplant -related mortality (TRM), defined as death before day [ADDRESS_638611] . This documentation is 
extracted by [CONTACT_450446] 140 days +/ - after HCT via chart review and collection of copi[INVESTIGATOR_496716] a hard copy or electronic Case Report Form (CRF).  Thus, multiple 
health care providers  provide independent observations and participate in monitoring this trial.  The PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_443875] a clinician for some patients entered on this trial.  However, assessments are the sum total of the 
primary health care provider (fellow or physician assistant), flo or or outpatient nurse and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_496717]. If determination of adverse events is controversial, co -
investig ators will convene on an ad hoc basis as necessary to review the primary data and render a 
decision.  
 
B. Plans for assuring compliance with requirements regarding the reporting of adverse events  
 
The adverse event reporting in this multi -institution clini cal trial will follow an adapted version of the 
FHCRC Guidelines for serious adverse event (SAE) reporting. These guidelines detail the expedited 
reporting requirements, definitions of particular events. All SAEs  that meet expedited reporting  are 
reported to the IRO within [ADDRESS_638612] fulfilled all NIH requirements for training in human subjects 
protection.  
                                
FHCRC 2241.00   
FHCRC current version: 10/10/2017  46  C. Plans for assuring that any action resulting in a temporary or permanent suspension of an NCI -
funded clinical trial is reported to the NCI grant program director responsible for the grant  
 
This clinical research trial uses commercial agents and there is no associated Investigational New Drug 
(IND) or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE). Any temporary or permanent suspension, as 
determined by [CONTACT_978], IRB, or DSMC , of this clinical research trial will be reported to the NCI grant 
program director by [CONTACT_978].   
 
  D. Plans for assuring data accuracy and protocol compliance  
   
Collaborating sites send signed consents, eligibility forms, and CRFs with source documents 
demonstrating eligibility, treatment, and serious adverse events (if applicable) to the study staff. These 
are reviewed for eligibility, adherence to the protocol, accuracy, and completeness by [CONTACT_5984]. 
Queries are sent to the collaborating investigators if CRFs are inaccurate or incomplete.  
 
The study is monitored under the FHCRC Mon itoring Plan. The FHCRC Data and Safety Monitoring 
Plan detail the full scope and extent of monitoring and provides for immediate action in the event of the 
discovery of major deviations.  
 
 
14. Records  
Clinical Statistics maintains a patient database at FHCRC to allow storage and retrieval of patient data collected 
from a wide variety of sources. The investigator will ensure that data collected conform to all established 
guidelines for coding collection, key entry and verification. Any publica tion or presentation will refer to 
patients by [CONTACT_249382]. The licensed medical records department, affiliated with the 
institution where the patient receives medical care, maintains all original inpatient and outpatient chart 
documents. P atient research files are kept in a locked room. They are maintained by [CONTACT_496760] A.R.T.  Access is restricted to personnel authorized by [CONTACT_496761].  
 
Standard data collection procedure s have been developed and agreed upon by [CONTACT_496762]. Ongoing data collection will be monitored 
by [CONTACT_496763]. Follow -up once the 
patient leaves the research center will be primarily through the patient’s physician and through annual clinic 
visits at the transplant research center.  
 
Collection of Survival and Disease Response Data  
Centers enrolling patients will complete case report forms within [ADDRESS_638613] (Appendix K).  The case report form provides detailed descriptions of the 
transplantation procedure, disease response, and complications. Detailed treatment -related adverse events will 
be reported using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (Appendix M).  The coordinating center will contact 
[CONTACT_496764] -up at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 2 4 months and then 
annually time five years, to ascertain the patient’s disease status and survival. Referring physicians are required 
to report the date and cause of death within [ADDRESS_638614] to substantiate data on the case report forms. Death information including date and cause 
will be reviewed from these medical records, and will be confirmed by [CONTACT_496765].  
 
FHCRC 2241.00   
FHCRC current version: 10/10/[ADDRESS_638615] from a HLA -
haploidentical related donor. We anticipate average annu al accrual of 4 patients per year from SCCA with an 
average duration of 12 years to complete the study.  
 
In case of a cross -over from this protocol to another tandem autologous -allogeneic research protocol (#1409  or 
other appropriate protocol ) or vice versa, enrollment will be counted on the crossed -over protocol if the patient 
receives the allogeneic transplantation on that protoc ol. If the patient is crossed -over but does not receive the 
allogeneic transplantation, enrollment will be counted on the initial protocol.  
 
The primary objective of this study is to examine the potential efficacy of this treatment plan in terms of 
progre ssion free survival (PFS) . PFS will be calculated for all patients from the date of autologous transplant 
until the time of death. Nonmyeloablative conditioning and HCT from HLA - haploidentical related donors 
resulted in 1 -year PFS of 32% among patients wi th high -risk hematological malignancies. Our hypothesis is that 
the addition of planned autologous HCT will improve PFS by [CONTACT_496766]. Given the relatively 
poor prognostic characteristics of patients eligible for this study, an observed  1-year PFS of ≥50% would be 
considered efficacious and worthy of further study. With 30 patients, the width of an 80% binomial confidence 
interval for the PFS probability would be +/ - 10 percentage points; the width of the 95% confidence interval 
would be +/- 18 percentage points. With 30 patients, the probability of observing 1 -year PFS of 0.50 or greater 
is 57% if the true rate is 0.50, 77% if the true rate is 0.55, and 90% if the true rate is 0.60.  
 
The secondary objectives of this study are to assess rates of relapse at 1 year, early NRM and incidence/severity 
of acute and chronic GVHD, and immune reconstitution after allografting.  
 
Reconstitution of lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood at is a secondary endpoint.  Absolute counts of B -cells 
(CD19+ ), T-cell subsets (determined by [CONTACT_496767]4, CD8 or CD45 isoforms on CD3+ cells) 
and NK cells (CD16+/CD56+ ) in peripheral blood determined on day +84 should be compared to pre -transplant 
lymphocyte counts on day –6. 
 
NRM after no nmyeloablative HLA -haploidentical HCT was 15% at 1 -year. Therefore, we will choose a NRM 
at 200 days after allograft of 30% as a threshold for a safety stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]. This allows for some increase in 
NRM due to additional patients being exposed to the risk  of NRM if we are successful in reducing the rate of 
relapse/progression. It also allows for a small amount of NRM after the autograft. Early NRM will be monitored 
in a sequential fashion. A stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_496718] : 
 
• NRM within 200 days of th e allograft  exceeds 30%. 
 
Reasonable evidence will be taken to mean that the lower bound of a one -sided 80% confidence interval for the 
true rate of NRM is above 0. 30. Operationally, these limits would be realized if any of the failure rates below 
are obse rved:  
 
• NRM within 200 days of allograft (30 % threshold ): 5/10, 9/20, 12/[ADDRESS_638616] every 10 patients. Patients may continue to be enrolled pending 
evaluation of the safety endpoints in each cohort of 10 patients; however, the outcome of subsequent patients 
cannot be used to override a stopp ing rule triggered in the earlier cohort.  The operating characteristics of these

Since there is limited experience treating patients with lymphoma, Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulinemia, CLL, 
MM, or plasma cell leukemia  with the treatment plan proposed in the current study, this trial will be carefully 
monitored for potential complications that could render this proposal a failure relative to more conventional 
treatment plans for eligible patients.  In addition to the ab ove outcomes, secondary endpoints to be examined 
include overall survival, relapse rate, and engraftment. Overall survival will be estimated by [CONTACT_496768], and relapse rate will be summarized using cumulative incidence estimates. Confid ence 
intervals for all these outcomes will be also be estimated.  Engraftment will be monitored in a sequential 
fashion. Given the preliminary experience with nonablative HCT in patients with lymphoma, Waldenstrom’s 
Macroglobulinemia, CLL, MM, or plasma ce ll leukemia,  we do not expect engraftment failure or rejection to be 
a problem in this population undergoing reduced -intensity allografting, but we will be concerned should the 
observed rejection - or engraftment -failure rate exceed 20%. Should this occur, the study would be suspended 
pending review by [CONTACT_4318].  
 
As stated above, should the results of this study indicate that the current treatment plan is potentially 
efficacious, a more definitive analysis of efficacy will be undertaken in a subsequent Phas e II study. This future 
study would be designed to show a statistically significant difference in PFS compared to a predetermined fixed 
target rate.

FHCRC 2241.00   
FHCRC current version: 10/10/[ADDRESS_638630] DISEASE (GVHD)  
 
Chronic GVHD in allogeneic transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_496724], Sjogren syndrome, primary  biliary cirrhosis, lichen planus, wasting syndrome,  
bronchiolitis obliterans among others manifestations (see below). Approximately 50% of  
patients will develop this complication within [ADDRESS_638631] 2 years after allogeneic stem cell transplantation so that appropriate treatment can be  
instituted promptly in patients who develop chronic GVHD. Debilitation, joint contractures  
and profound immunosuppression resulting in recurrent bacterial infections are prominent  
characteristics of untreated chronic GVHD.  
 
A. Classification of Chronic GVHD  
The purpose of this classification is to identify patients with cGVHD who need long -term 
systemic immunosuppression according to clinical and laboratory findings and risk factors at  
the time of initial diagnosis. In addition, a morbidity scale has been developed to help grade  
the severity of manifestation of chronic GVHD (Appendix D) at the time of diagnosis, when  
changes in treatment are made and when assessing treatment response.  
 
1.  Chronic GVHD not requiring systemic treatment: mild abnormalities involving a single site, 
with platelet count >100,000 and no steroid treatment at the onset of  
chronic GVHD  
a)  Oral abnormalities consistent with cGVHD, a positive skin or lip biopsy, and no other 
manifestations of cGVHD  
b)  Mild liver test abnormalities (alkaline phosphatase ≤[ADDRESS_638632] or ALT ≤3 x 
upper limit of normal and total bilirubin ≤1.6) with positive skin or lip biopsy, and no other 
manifestations of cGVHD  
c)  Less than 6 papulosquamous plaques, macular -papular or lichenoid rash involving <20% of body 
surface area (BSA), dyspi[INVESTIGATOR_450390] <20% BSA, or erythem a involving <50% BSA, 
positive skin biopsy, and no other manifestations of cGVHD  
d)  Ocular sicca (Schirmer’s test ≤5mm with no more than minimal ocular symptoms), positive skin 
or lip biopsy, and no other manifestations of cGVHD  
e)  Vaginal or vulvar abno rmalities with positive biopsy, and no other manifestations of cGVHD  
 
2.  Chronic GVHD requiring systemic treatment: more severe abnormalities or  
involvement of multiple sites, or platelet count <100,000, or steroid treatment  
at the onset of chronic GVHD  
a)  Involvement of two or more organs with symptoms or signs of cGVHD, with biopsy 
documentation of cGVHD in any organ  
b)  ≥15% base line body weight loss not due to other causes, with biopsy documentation of cGVHD 
in any organ  
c)  Skin involvement more ext ensive than defined for clinical limited cGVHD, confirmed by [CONTACT_9256]  
d)  Scleroderma or morphea  
e)  Onycholysis or onychodystrophy thought to represent cGVHD, with documentation of cGVHD 
in any organ  
f)  Decreased range of motion in wrist or ankle extension  due to fasci itis caused by [CONTACT_57942]  
g)  Contractures thought to represent cGVHD  
h) Oral involvement with functional impairment, refractory to topi[INVESTIGATOR_35786]  
i)  Vaginal involvement with functional impairment, refractory to topi[INVESTIGATOR_496725] 2241.00   
FHCRC current version: 10/10/2017  65 j)  Bronchiolitis obliterans not due to other causes  
k)  Positive liver biopsy; or abnormal liver function tests not due to other causes with  
alkaline phosphatase >[ADDRESS_638633] or ALT >3 x upper limit of  
normal, or total bilirubin >1.6, and d ocumentation of cGVHD in any organ  
l)  Positive upper or lower GI biopsy  
m)  Fasciitis or serositis thought to represent cGVHD and not due to other causes  
 
B. Physical manifestations of Chronic GVHD  
Manifestations that are distinctive for chronic GVHD can begin before day [ADDRESS_638634] one manifestation that is distinctive for chronic GVHD ( identified by [CONTACT_496773] ) as opposed to acute GVHD. In all cases, infection and others causes must be  
ruled out in the differential diagnosis of chronic GVHD.  
 
Karnofsky or Lansky Clinical Performance scores <60%, ≥15% weight loss, and recurrent  
infections are usually signs of clinical extensive chronic GVHD. Abnormalities that could  
indicate chronic GVHD are categorized b y organ system are listed below ( italic print  
identifies manifestation more distinct of chronic GVHD):  
 
Skin Erythema, dryness, pruritis, macular -papular or urticarial rash, pi[INVESTIGATOR_211485] (i.e., hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], vitiligo), mottling, papulosquamous or 
lichenoid plaques, hyperkeratosis, exfoliation (icht hyosis), nodules, scleroderma, 
morphea (one or several circumscribed, indurated and shiny lesions) . The extent 
of skin involvement and the skin thickness score for patients with sclerode rma 
needs to be recorded at the time of diagnosis, when changes in treatment are 
made and when assessing treatment response. Medical photos are also useful for 
assessing the extent of skin involvement and response to treatment.  
Nails  Ridging, onychodystro phy, onycholysis  
Hair Premature graying (scalp hair, eyelashes, eyebrows), thinning scalp hair, 
alopecia, decreased body hair  
Mouth  Dryness, burning, gingivitis, mucositis, striae, dryness, atrophy, erythema, 
lichenoid changes, ulcers, labial atrophy or pi[INVESTIGATOR_9491], tightness 
around the mouth, sensitivity to acidic, strong flavors, heat or cold, tooth decay  
Eyes  Dryness, burning, blurring, gritty eyes, photophobia, pain  
Vagina/vulva  Dryness, dyspareunia, stricture or stenosis, erythema, atrophy or lichenoid 
changes not induced by [CONTACT_443966] (see laboratory 
tests)  
Lung  Bronchiolitis obliterans (see diagnostic indicators), cough, wheezing, dyspne a on 
exertion, history of recurrent bronchitis or sinusitis  
GI Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption, dysphagia, odynophagia  
Myofascial  Stiffness and tightness with restriction of movement, occasionally with swelling, 
pain, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], erythe ma and induration, most commonly affecting the forearms, 
wrists and hands, ankles, legs and feet, inability to extend the wrists without 
flexing the fingers or the elbows, contractures  
Muscle  Proximal muscle weakness, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_496726] 2241.00   
FHCRC current version: 10/10/2017  66 Serosal  Unexplained effusions involving the pleural, pericardial, or peritoneal cavities 
not due to venocclusive disease of the liver, cardiac insufficiency, malignancy, 
infection, GM -CSF toxicity or other causes  
 
  
C. Laboratory Testing and Diagnostic Indicators of Chronic GVHD  
 
Eye Schirmer’s test with a mean value ≤ [ADDRESS_638635] sicca symptoms, or keratitis detected by [CONTACT_443967] (alkaline phosphatase ≥[ADDRESS_638636] or ALT >3 x upper limit of normal or total serum 
bilirubin ≥1.6)  
Lung  New obstructive lung defect defined as an FEV 1 <80% of predicted with either an 
FEF 25 -75 <65% of predicted or RV >120% of predicted, or a decrease of 
FEV 1/FVC by >12% within a period of less than [ADDRESS_638637] more severe intestinal mucosal lesions 
including ulcers and mucosal sloughing.  
Muscle  Elevated CPK or aldolase, EMG findin gs consistent with myositis with biopsy 
revealing no other etiological process  
Blood  Thrombocytopenia (usually 20,000 -100,000/
 l), eosinophilia (> 0.4 x 103/uL), 
hypogammaglobulinemia. Hypergammaglobulinemia and autoantibodies occur in 
some cases.  
 
 
D. Guidelines for Treatment of Chronic GVHD after allogeneic HSCT  
 
We strongly recommend that you consult the LTFU office before beginning treatment for chronic GVHD and 
before making changes in immunosuppressive treatment. Clinical trials should always be co nsidered because 
current standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_496727] (1mg/kg/day) 
followed b y taper to eventually reach an alternate -day regimen, with or without daily cyclosporine or tacrolimus 
(FK506). Other medications used for treatment of corticosteroid -resistant chronic GVHD are summarized on 
the next page. Telephone consultation with the L TFU medical team is available to you, seven days a week, to 
discuss appropriate treatment and provide other follow up recommendations. In addition to immunosuppressive 
treatment, antibiotic prophylaxis for encapsulated bacterial infections and PCP must be  given to all patients 
being treated for chronic GVHD (see Appendix C ). 
 
FHCRC 2241.00   
FHCRC current version: 10/10/[ADDRESS_638638] one year 
of therapy. Approximately 80% of patients require systemic immunosuppressive for 2 years and 40% of them 
requires therapy for at least 4 years.

Study Coordinator’s Manual  
 
I.  Introduction  
 
The mixed chimerism protocols have been opened to multiple sites to increase the referral base and accrual. 
Because of this expansion of collaborators, the data collection procedures are being revised. The procedure 
manual was created to assure consistency of data reporting across the cente rs and to assure compliance with 
regulations. General expectations of collaborators are that they will comply with appropriate regulatory 
requirements, specified protocol requirements, and provide outcome data.  
 
The manual translates working procedures for  study coordination. Its goal is to describe the procedures with 
sufficient clarity to ensure that all study centers will use the same procedures and follow -up schedules for 
participant data management and reporting. Changes to the manual and relevant form s will be made as soon as 
practical and will become effective on receipt of the revised procedures at the study centers, unless otherwise 
noticed.  
 
II. Institutional Review Board Review of Protocols and Modifications  
 
All research protocols proposed for use th at involves human subjects must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_5030] (IRB) prior to implementation. New protocols will undergo review at the FHCRC 
IRB and then will be distributed to sites that wish to participate for their IRB’s revi ew. For Centers that have a 
Federal Wide Assurance (FWA), formal collaboration includes submission of a form [ADDRESS_638641] be completed  before collaboration on a protocol can begin.  
 
In addition, all amendments and/or revisions to on -going, approved activities must be submitted for review and 
approved prior to implementation at an institution.  No revisions may be implemented at outside institutions 
without the prior approval of the FHCRC Principal Investigator.  The FHCRC and the local site’ s IRB must 
review all protocol activities at least once annually. This must be done within [ADDRESS_638642] be received for 
collaboration to continue for the next year.  
 
III. Registrations  
 
Collaborating Institutions : The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_496729]. Registration will include completion of the eligibility 
checkli st/demographic form. This form will be faxed (206 -667-5378) prior to treatment initiation. Patients must 
be registered prior to treatment initiation for valid registration  
 
IV. Reporting Adverse Events  
 
The following guidelines are the minimum serious adverse event (SAE) reporting guidelines for Category 1 and 
2 studies conducted at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.   
FHCRC 2241.00   
FHCRC current version: 10/10/[ADDRESS_638643] a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal l aboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal product, medical treatment or procedure whether or not considered related to the medicinal 
product.  
 
Life-threatening Adverse Event   – Any adverse event  that places the patient or subject, in view of the 
investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction.  Study toxicities are graded using the NCI Common 
Toxicity Criteria (where appropriate use the criteria for transplant patients.)  All Grade 4 ( life-threatening) 
toxicities in Appendix M occurring between start of conditioning and day [ADDRESS_638644] 10 calendar days of the investigator 
learning of the event.  
 
Unexpected Adverse Event  – An adverse event, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the 
applicable product information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure for an unapproved investigational product or 
package insert/summary of product characteri stics for an approved product).  If applicable product information 
is not available, such as for studies that do not involve pharmaceutical products or devices, an unexpected 
adverse event is an adverse event that was not described in the study protocol or  informed consent.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  – Any adverse event occurring that results in any of the following outcomes:   
➢ Death – start of conditioning to day 200, regardless of cause,  
➢ a life -threatening adverse event (see above)  
➢ a persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
➢ a congenital anomaly  
➢ requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], in general, will not be considered a serious adverse  event as approximately half of evaluable 
MRD patients AND the majority of evaluable URD patients receiving nonmyeloablative transplants were 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_123324] a serious adverse event if it fulfills the criteria for a seriou s and 
unexpected adverse event as described above.  
 
To ensure no confusion or misunderstanding exist of the differences between the terms “serious” and “severe,” which are not s ynonymous the following note 
of clarification is provided:  
 
The term “severe” i s often used to describe the intensity (severity) or a specific event (as in mild, moderate or 
severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance 
(such as severe headache).  This is not the same as “se rious,” which is based on patient/event outcome or 
action  criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or functioning.  Seriousness 
(not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory obligations.  
 
FHCRC 2241.00   
FHCRC current version: 10/10/[ADDRESS_638645], treatment or procedure will be as follows:  
➢ Related – includes adverse events that are definitely, probably, or possibly related to the medical treat ment 
or procedure.  
➢ Not Related – includes adverse events are doubtfully related or clearly not related to the medical treatment 
or procedure.  
 
 
The FHCRC Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form should be completed for all adverse events that meet 
the exped ited reporting requirements.   All available information should be submitted but it is acceptable to fax 
an incomplete report form at the initial report.  A completed report should be faxed as soon as possible but must 
be received within 1 0 calendar days.  
 
It is the responsibility of the FHCRC Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_443890], NIH, FDA or other agencies 
of serious adverse events as required in the protocol.  
 
Serious adverse events that do not meet the requirement for expedited reporting (not related to study treatment 
or expected) will be reported to the IRB as part of the annual renewal of the protocol.  
 
FHCRC is acting as the Coordinating Center for this multi -institutional study, and it is the responsibility of the 
FHCRC Principal Investiga tor (or designee) to complete the FHCRC Serious Adverse Event Report for all 
serious adverse events that meet the expedited reporting requirements that are received from the participating 
sites.   
 
Procedure for Reporting Serious and Unexpected Adverse Eve nts from Participating Sites  
Regulations defining the responsibilities for reporting serious and unexpected adverse reactions are defined 
above.  Serious and unexpected adverse events must be reported to the FHCRC Investigator within 10 days  of 
learning of  the event. This includes patient deaths, regardless of cause  (serious, unexpected, and related/possibly 
related) , occurring start of conditioning - day [ADDRESS_638646] be followed by [CONTACT_496780] e Trial Coordinator at (206) 667 -5378. This will be followed by 
[CONTACT_370433] (See Appendix “ H”) within [ADDRESS_638647] be submitted as soon as the relevant information is 
available.  
 
Obligation of Investigators  
All grade 3 or 4 adverse events (or highly unusual grade 2 adverse events), which o ccur between start of 
conditioning and day 100 during the study will be recorded on the Case Report Form ( Appendix K).  These 
adverse events which are observed by [CONTACT_183633], whether or not attributed to the 
study, will be reported on the Case Report Form using the modified (for HSCT) NCI Common Toxicity Criteria 
(Appendix M). Attributes will include a description, date of onset, maximum severity, and assessment of 
relationship to the study agent or other suspect agent(s) . 
 
Adverse events will be graded accordingly: 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = life threatening or 
debilitating, and 5 = fatal.   All Grade 4 (life -threatening) or Grade 5 (fatal) events on the Adapted HSCT NCI 
scale meet expedited reporti ng requirements.  
 
Association or relatedness to the study agent will be graded as follows: 1 = unrelated, 2 = unlikely, 3 = possibly, 
4 = probably, and 5 = definitely related.  
  
FHCRC 2241.00   
FHCRC current version: 10/10/[ADDRESS_638648] case report form (day  28) is due on day  50.  For outside centers a Staging Form must 
accompany the form with t he patient staging at registration, day  28, day 56, day [ADDRESS_638649] be completed and submitted for every infusion given.  
 
VI. Protocol Monitoring  
 
As the coordinating center, FHCRC will monitor accrual at the outside ins titutions. The guidelines below are 
intended to guide the reviewers in their assessment of items that significantly alter the clinical effectiveness of 
the treatment or the evaluation of its toxicity.

Outside Center – PI [INVESTIGATOR_443923]  
 
I. Study Management, data analysis, and Data and Safety Monitoring  
 a. Study Management:  
i. Each local PI [INVESTIGATOR_443924], training and oversight of loca l study coordinators  
ii. The Coordinating Center registers subjects on the study and assigns study IDs  
iii. One copy of the research data is retained by [CONTACT_779]. Another data set (identified only by 
[CONTACT_443984]) is transmitted to the Coordinating Center to create th e master data file. All data 
are kept in locked areas and password protected databases accessible only to study staff  
iv. The quality of data is monitored in an ongoing fashion with the study team and corrective 
action plans instituted as necessary  
b. Data An alysis:  
i. Study staff review data for completeness as it is submitted by [CONTACT_443985]. The study statistician is responsible for data cleaning and the conduct of analyses as outlined 
in the protocol and grant  
c. Data Safety and Monitoring:  
i. The trial coordinators at collaborating centers or the local PIs will fax an official report of an 
SAE to the Coordinating Center within ten days 
ii. The SAE report is reviewed by [CONTACT_52488]. If the SAE meets the FHCRC criteria for 
reporting then an offici al signed report is submitted to the IRB  
iii. An independent DSMB will meet at six -month intervals and all outcome data is reviewed 
including all adverse events and SAEs reported to the Coordinating Center along with those 
officially reported to the IRB  
iv. A repor t from the DSMB is submitted to the IRB as well as the trial coordinators/local PIs 
participating in the protocol  
 
II.  Protocol and informed consent document management  
a. A master protocol is maintained by [CONTACT_450464] s for 
customization and local IRB review  
b. All protocol and consent modifications initiated by [CONTACT_443987], for review and approval 
by [CONTACT_1036]  
c. Changes req uired by [CONTACT_496783]. Assurance of local IRB OHRP -approved assurance  
a. Each site provides their OHRP assurance number and evidence of IRB certification  
b. Study staf f monitor maintenance of institutional assurance and IRB certification  
 
IV. Assurance of local IRB approvals  
a. The Coordinating Center maintains copi[INVESTIGATOR_496733]  
b. No site may enroll subjects until the Coordinating Center has received confirmation of local IRB 
approval  
c. Each site is responsible for preparation and submission of their continuing reviews. Any changes 
to the protocol or consent form will be communicated to the Coord inating Center  
d. Sites are required to have active IRB approvals to participate in any study related activities

Salmon and Durie Criteria for Diag nosis of Multiple Myeloma  
1. Major criteria  
 
i. Plasmacytoma on tissue biopsy.  
ii. Bone marrow plasmacytosis with > 30% plasma cells.  
iii. Monoclonal globulin spi[INVESTIGATOR_58092] 3.5 g/dL for IgG peaks or 2.0 g for 
IgA peaks, > 1.0 g/24 h of k or l light chain excretion on urine electrophoresis in the absence of 
amyloidosis.  
 
2. Minor criteria  
 
a. Bone marrow plasmacytosis with 10% to 30% plasma cells.  
b. Monoclonal globulin spi[INVESTIGATOR_58093], but less than the levels defined above.  
c. Lytic bone lesions.  
d. Normal IgM <50 mg, IgA <100 mg, or IgG <600 mg/dL.  
 
 
Diagnosis will be confirmed when any of the following features are documented in  
symptomatic patients with clearly progressive disease. The diagnosis of myeloma requires a minimum o f 
one major + one minor criterion or three minor criteria that must include a + b.  
 
1. i + b, i + c, i + d (i + a not sufficient)  
2. ii + b, ii+ c, ii + d.  
3. iii + a, iii + c, iii + d.  
4. a + b + c, a + b + d.

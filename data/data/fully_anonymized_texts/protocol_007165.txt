Confident ial and Propri etary 6 MEDI4736 -NHL -001 Amendment #4 Final :22 Apr2020PROTOCOL SUMMARY
On 05 Sep 2017 , a Partial Clinical Ho ld was placed on this study by [CONTACT_24623] (US) Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA). The decisio nby [CONTACT_432848] i-PD-1 ant ibody , pembrolizumab, in patients with mult iple myelo ma in 
combinat ion with immuno modulatory  agents. As a result, e nrollment into Arm A (durvalumab 
plus len alidomide with or with out ri tuximab) wasdiscontinued. Subjects al ready enrolled and 
treated in Arm A who are receiving clinical benefit, based on the discret ion of the invest igator, 
may cont inue study  treatm ent after being reconsented .
In December 2017, Cel gene stop pedenrollm ent and discontinuedthe dose expansio n part of the 
study .
Following completion or discont inuat ion of durvalumab therapy  per protocol  for all subjects 
(n=106) ,and complet ion of the primary analys is (data cutoff date [ADDRESS_548363]’s 90- day Safety Follow-up V isit), there are no further plans to evaluate long-
term efficacy , including overall survival for the remaining subjects on study . Therefore, the
Follow-up P eriod will be discontinued, and data collect ion will stop under this amendment. No 
additional stati stical analysis on safet y and efficacy  will be performed. 
At the time of primary  analysis data cutoff, 36 subjects were in follow -up.There were 13 
subjects on ibrutinib treatment (Arm B), and no subjects on treatm ent wi th lenalido mide or 
bendamustine. Subjects who continue ibrut inib on -study  will be treated per i nvest igator’s 
medical judgement and standard of care at the investigat ive site or discont inue study  to receive 
ibrutinib co mmercially as standard of care treatm ent (off-study ). 
Subjects who received lenalido mide will cont inue to be fo llowed for second primary  
malignancies (SPMs) as required by  [CONTACT_432849][INVESTIGATOR_432758], any SPM events will continue to be co llected in the safet y database. 
Study Title

cArm A will exclude subjects with CLL/SLL.
dArm A dose confirmation and dose expansion cohorts are discontinued and will notenroll new subjects .
eCelgene decided to not continue with the dose expansion part of the study. 
In the dose finding part (Phase 1), a preliminary RP2D will be established for each durvalumab 
combinat ion treatment using a 3 + 3 design ( Storer, 1989 ).  For Arms A and C, prior to enrolling 
subjects to receive all 3 drugs, the doublet combinations (ie, Arm A: durvalumab and 
lenalido mide and Arm C: durvalumab and rituximab) will be evaluated.  Once the doublet 
combinat ions are deemed tole rable, the eventual triplet combination swill be tested.  The 
durvalumab starting dose is fixed in each of these arms.  Three to 6 subjects will be evaluated in 
each dose finding cohort; therefore, approximately 15to 60 (DLT evaluable )subjects with B -cell 
non-Hodgkin lympho ma (NHL) or CLL are ant icipated to be enro lledin the dose finding part (6 
to 30subjects in Arm A; 6 to 12 subjects in Arm B; and 3 to 18 subjects in Arm C).  Subj ects 
with CLL/small lymphocy tic lymphom a (SLL) will not be eligible for Arm A.  The final number 
of subjects will depend on the number of dose levels tested and the number of dose limit ing 
toxicities (DLTs) observed within each cohort.

safety physician, and a subset of invest igators will determine a preliminary RP2D for each 
combinat ion treatment arm (except Arm D) based on the assessment of the safet y, available PK 
and Pd data, and preliminary efficacy  informationas needed . 
In the dose confirmation part (Phase 1), once the preliminary RP2D is established, each 
combinat ion treatment arm will enro ll approximately 10 subjects with each prespecified disease 
histol ogy (7 cohorts of 10 subjects) into Arms A, B, and C to confirm the tolerabili ty and safety  
of the RP2D and ident ify the strongest antitumor signal in those histologies. The Arm D dose 
confirmat ion cohort will be open at study  start and enroll a total of approximately 30 subjects 
into up to 5 cohorts.  In total, approximately 100 subjects are ant icipated to enroll in the dose 
confirmat ion part.
If a promising ant itumor signal is detected in any dose confirmation cohort, that cohort will 
expand and enroll approximately 15 addi tional subjects to further assess the efficacy in the dos e 
expansio n part (Phase 2).  In total, approximately [ADDRESS_548365] relapse d or ref ractory  lympho ma or CLL (high risk) requi ring therapeut ic

systemic abscopal  antitumor effect) if they meet the criteria defined in Section 3.1.[ADDRESS_548374] consul t with the 
sponsor’s medical mo nitor.
Treatment arms and dose levels for each arm are described and tabulated in Section7and 9.3.
Overview of Key Efficacy Assessments
Disease response to treatment in lympho ma is determined by [CONTACT_165878] 
(Cheson 2014) and in CLL by [CONTACT_432851] ( Hallek, 2008 ; 
Hallek , 2012
; Hallek, 2013 ) including a careful review of laboratory assessments (eg, com plete 
blood coun ts wi th different ial, bone marrow/tum or biopsy  assessments, immunophenoty pi[INVESTIGATOR_432759]) and imaging studies (eg, CT or fluorodeoxy glucose -positron 
emissio n tom ography  [FDG -PET]scan) as well as clinical findings (eg, physical  examinat ion, 
constitutional symptoms) . 
Integrated FDG -PET with CT (FDG -PET-CT) is preferred for r esponse assessment of FDG -avid 
lympho mas (eg, DLBCL, Hodgkin lympho ma [HL] , or FL), while dedicated CT scan alone is 
preferred for FDG -
non-avid and variably  FDG-avid histol ogies (eg, CLL/SLL, orMZL).
Overview of Key Safety Assessments
Safety assessments include mo nitoring for AEs; physical examinat ion; vital signs and body  
weight measurement; Eastern Cooperative Oncology  Group (ECOG) performance status; 
hepat itis Bvirus (HBV) screening; hematol ogy (complete blood count [CBC] with diffe rential 
and platel ets); serum chemistry; urinalysis; serum  immunogl obulins; concomitant medicat ions, 
therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014], and procedures; pregnancy  testing (for fem alesubjects of childbearing potenti al 
[FCBP] only); and electrocardi ogram .
Safety assessments will b e perform ed during screening and will be repeated weekly in Cycle 1, 
bi-weekly  in Cycle s 2through 4in Arms A, B, D or Cycles 2through [ADDRESS_548375] igator’s discretion fo llowing standard of care .
The invest igator remains responsible to monitor safet y, record adverse events (AEs)/serious 
adverse events (SAEs)/s econd primary malignancies(SPMs) in source documents, and report 
SAEs and SPMs to Cel gene Drug Safety
.
Overview of Pharmacokinetic Assessments
Serum  or pl asma samples will be co llected to assay concentrations of durvalumab and other 
combinat ion agents (ie, lenalido mide oribrutinib). 
Overview of Biomarker Assessments
Pharmacodynamic markers for durvalumab and other combinat ion agents will be measured, such 
as soluble programmed cell death ligand 1 (sPD -L1)levels for durvalumab andproliferat ion of 
immune cell subsets, and soluble cytok ines and chemokines. 
Exploratory  biomarkers predictive of response or disease/mechanist ic related will be measured 
including , but not limited to PD -L1 protein levels, immune cell subsets ,and other markers that

celloforigins, T -cell receptor clonality, neoant igen assessments, or genetic alterations.
Overview of Immunogenicity Assessments
Blood sam ples f or immunogenicit y will be collected fro m all subjects.  Antidrug antibody  
(ADA) for durval umab will be explored using these samples .
Statistical Methods
There are 3 treatm ent arms in the dose finding part, ie, Arm A (discontinued to the enrollment of 
new subjects), Arm B, and Arm C. The standard 3 + 3 design will be used to i dentify the 
maximum tolerated dose ( MTD) and preliminary RP2D in each treatment arm.   The sample size 
for the dose finding part (Phase 1) is expected to range fro mapproximately 15 to 60 (DLT 
evaluable )subjects. The final number of subjects will depend on the number of dose levels 
studi ed and number of DLTs observed within each cohort.
The planned sam ple size for the dose confirmat ion (Phase 1) and dose expansio n (Phase 2 ) parts
is based on clinical ,empi [INVESTIGATOR_10477],and practi cal considerati ons tradi tionally used for Phase 1/2 
studi es. Please see Section 9.3for further details.
Shoul d the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_432760] 34for the dose confirmat ion part befulfilled, the 
SRC for that cohort and global scient ific steering committee (GSSC) will be consulted to 
determine whether the clinical trial should co mpletely stop further enro llment of subjects with a 
particular histol ogy (ie, not advance to the dose expansio n part), temporarily halt enrollment and 
await maturati on of  efficacy  data to examine for example durabilit y of responses, or enroll 
additional subjects either in the dose confirmat ion part or by  [CONTACT_432852] n part.
For the efficacy analysis, in order to make use of all available data, the data from the dose 
expansio n and dose confirmat ion parts will be pooled together for a part icular histo logy for the 
evaluat ion of treatm ent efficacy. A total of approximately [ADDRESS_548376] hi stology cohort will  provide amoderate estimate of the response rate with 95% 
confidence interval ( CI)no wider than ± 20%. Efficacy analys es will  also be perform ed 
separately  for the dose confirmat ion part and thedose expansio n part as well .
The s afety analysis will include all subjects in the safety popul ation. 
All analyses will use descript ive statist ics.

Confident ial and Propri etary 25 MEDI4736 -NHL -001 Amendment #4 Final : [ADDRESS_548393] asms ori ginate from  cells that normally  devel op into B lymphocy tes 
(lymphocytes or plasma cells) or T lymphocy tes (cy totoxi c T lymphocy tes, helper T 
lymphocy tes, or regulatory  T lymphocy tes).  
In the 2008 World Heal th Organizat ion (WHO) classificati on of  lympho id neoplasms 
(Swerdlow, 2008), the diagnosis o f the various lympho id neoplasms depends not on the anatomic 
location of tumor cells, but rather on the cell o f origin of th e tum or, as j udged by [CONTACT_432854], 
immunophenoty pe, and genet ic findings.   As a result, several ent ities previously considered 
distinct are now grouped together under single diagnostic categories (eg, chronic lymphocyt ic 
leukemia [CLL] and small lymphocy ticlymphoma [SLL]).
1.1.1. Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and CLL
Non-Hodgkin Lympho ma (NHL) is a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferat ive neopl asm 
with differing patterns of behavior and responses to treatment ( Armitage, 1993 ).Currently, th e 
WHO Lympho ma Classificat ion scheme is utilized to define specific subt ypes of lymphoma and 
subdivides them based on cell o f origin (B, T or natural killer [NK] ) and whether they  are 
derived fro m precursor lymphocy tes versus mature lymphocy tes (Swerdl ow, 2008 ).  Most (ie, 
80% to 90%) NHLs are of B -cell origin.  In the [LOCATION_002] (US) , 80-85% of lympho mas are 
diagnosed as B -cell lympho mas and 15 % to 20% as T -cell lymphomas. Natural  killer-cell 
lympho mas are very rare. 
The pathogenesis o f lympho mas represents a complex process invo lving the accumulat ion of 
multiple genet ic lesio ns affect ing proto -oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.   
The lymph node 
microenvironment, which includes stromal cells, macrophages, regulatory  T-cells, and the lymph 
node vasculature, has been implicated in the promotion of lympho magenesis ( Coupl and, 2011 ).
In 2015, it is est imated that there will be 71,[ADDRESS_548394] e will  die f rom this di sease annually in the US(Siegel, 2015 ).   
Chronic lymphocy tic leukemia is the most commo n leukemia in North America and Europe with 
an incidence of 4 .0 cases per 100,000 persons per year and has a median age of diagno sis of 72
years .  It consists of an accumulat ion of mature B -cells t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_432763], blood and 
lympho id organs with a unique cluster of differentiation ( CD) 19+, CD5+, and CD23 +
phenoty pe. The e tiology of CLL is unknown and its pathogenesis is not clearly understood, 
however it is likely  that the foll owing f actors pl ay a significant rol e: accumulat ion of geno mic 
events over time, chronic ant igen st imulation, and age -related changes in immunosurveillance 
and in the tumor microenvironment.
Chro nic lymphocy tic leukemia is a heterogeneous disease wit h a variable disease course from 
indolent disease (at times requiring little to no therapy ) to aggressive disease (fatal disease poorly  
responsive to aggressive therapeutic intervention). Prognostic f actors in CLL include clinical, 
serum , genetic, as well as cy togeneti c markers.

Confident ial and Propri etary 26 MEDI4736 -NHL -001 Amendment #4 Final : 22 Apr [ZIP_CODE].1.2. Hodgkin Lymphoma 
Hodgkin lympho ma (HL), formerly called Hodgkin ’s disease, ari ses from  germinal  center or 
post-germinal center B -cells. Hodgkin lymphoma has a unique cellular composit ion, containing a 
minori ty of neoplastic cells (Reed -Sternberg cells and their variants) in an inflammatory  
background. It is separated from the other B -cell lympho mas based on i ts uni que 
clinicopathologic features. 
Hodgkin lympho ma is a B -cell lympho ma that accounts for approximately 10% of all 
lympho mas in economically advanced countries.  This amounts to approximately 9,050 new 
cases and about 1,150 deaths due to HL in the USannually ( Siegel, 2015).  The incidence in 
Europe i s approximately 2.4 cases per 100,000 persons ( Sant, 2010 ; Smit h, 2011).  
The treatment of pat ients with HL i s primarily guided by  [CONTACT_432855] (Lister, 1989 ).  While the majorit y of treated patients 
will be cured of their lympho ma, treatment -related toxi cities have become a contribut ing cause 
of mortali tylater in life .  
As such, the select ion of therapy must balance the desire to maintain a 
high rate of cure and the need to minimize long -term com plicati ons.
Recent m ajor advance sin the therapeutic field have been the result sof treatm ent strategi es 
utilizing agents that target unique ant igens (eg,anti-CD30 -drug immunoconjugate [brentuximab 
vedotin], check- point inhibit ion via anti-programmed cell death -1 (anti-PD-1)monoclonal  
antibodies [nivo lumab, pembro lizumab, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_165817] ]) which have antitumor activit y in 
patients wi th R/RHL. Although these novel agents appear to prol ongpatient survival, they  are 
not curative .  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_432764], largely secondary to the 
addition of  novel  targeted or bi ologic-based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_432765] y ears, a high percentage of 
patients experience R/R disease .  
Overall, lymphoma or CLL remains mostly incurable in the 
majorit yof patients treated wi th convent ional therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014].  New therapi [INVESTIGATOR_432766] R/Rlympho maor CLL pati ents.
1.2. Compound Background 
1.2.1. Durvalumab (MEDI4736)
Durvalumab ( MEDI4736) is a human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1к monoclo nal ant ibody (mAb)
that blocks programmed cell death ligand -1 (PD -L1) by [CONTACT_432856], allowing T -cells 
to recognize an d kill  tumor cells as illustrated i nFigure 1.  Durvalumab select ively binds to 
human PD -L1 wi th high affini ty and bl ocks i ts abili ty to bind to programmed cell death -1 (PD -1) 
and cluster of different iation (CD80 )
.  The fragment crystall izable (Fc) domain of durval umab 
contains a triple mutation in the constant domain of the IgG1 heavy chain that reduces binding to 
the com plement com ponent C1q and the Fcγ receptors responsible for mediating ant ibody -
dependent cell -mediated cy totoxi city (ADCC) ( Oganesyan , 2008; Ibrahim, 2015 ). 
On 01 May 2017, the US FDA granted accel erated approval to durvalumab (IMFINZI™) for the 
treatm ent of patients with locally  advanced or m etastati c urothelial carcino ma who have disease 
progression during or following plat inum -containing chemotherapy  or who have disease 
progression wit hin 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with plat inum -containing 
chemotherapy.

have received at least one prior therapy , or in first line for patients unsuitable for 
chemo immunotherapy .
Ibrutinib is current ly being studied in mult iplehistol ogies as monotherapy  or in co mbinat ion 
therapy .
1.2.4. Bendamustine
Bendamust ine (Treanda®, Bendeka®, Levact®) is an alkylat ing drug whose m echanisms of action 
involve induction of apoptosis through activation of DNA -damage stress responses, inhibit ion of 
mitoti c checkpo ints, and induction o f mitotic catastrophe ( Leoni, 2008 ).

1.3. Rationale
1.3.1. Immune -checkpoint Inhibition
Tumor-infiltrat ing lymphocy tes (TILs) have the capacit y to control  the growth of many ty pes of  
cancers ( Gooden, 2011 ).  Most tumors show infiltration by [CONTACT_27638], but tumors modulate the local 
microenvironment through expressio n of inhibitory mo lecules.  Engage ment of TIL cell -surface 
receptors with these inhibitory  ligands leads to a dysfunct ional immune response, causes T -cell 
exhaust ion, and facilitates tumor progression ( Baitsch, 2012 ;Crespo, 2013 ).  It i s increasingly  
appreci ated that cancers are recognized by  [CONTACT_27639] , and under som e circumstances, 
the immune system may control or even eliminate tumors ( Dunn, 2004 ).   Novel  monocl onal 
antibodies (mAbs) that block these inhibitory  receptor s have shown significant clinical act ivity 
across a number of tumor ty pes ( Wolchok, 2009 ;Hodi , 2010 ;Robert, 2011 ;Brahmer, 2010; 
Topalian, 2012 ).  Specifically , blockade of immune -checkpo int inhibitors such as cy totoxi c T-
lymphocy te-associ ated ant igen 4 (CTLA -4), PD -1, and PD -L1 have shown clinical activit y not 
only in convent ionally  immune -responsive tum ors such as m elano ma and renal cell carcino ma 
but also in non -small  cell lung cancer ( Brahmer, 2010; Brahmer, 2012 ;Topalian, 2012; Gordon, 
2013) and prostate cancer ( Harzstark, 2010 ).  
Pembrolizumab and nivo lumab are both PD -[ADDRESS_548397]  family of checkpoint inhibitors to gain regul atory  approval  from the US FDA and 
European Commissio nfor melano maand non-small  cell lung cancer (NSCLC) .  Nivo lumab has 
also been approved for melano ma in combinat ion therapy with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], another checkpo int 
inhibitor (anti -CTLA -4 ant ibody ).  Both anti -PD-1 antibodies (nivo lumab and pembro lizumab ) 
have gained approvals for addit ional indicat ions from the US FDA and/or the European 
Commissio n (ie, nivo lumab for renal cell carcino mafrom the FDA and European Commissio n;

Several anti-PD-1 and ant i-PD-L1 ant ibodies are currently being studied in mult iple other 
oncol ogic and hematol ogic indicat ions either as monotherapy  or in combinat ion therapy .
1.3.2. Study Rationale and Purpose
Lympho ma/CLL is comprised of multiple histologies. It is hypothesized that durvalumab will 
have act ivity in mul tiple indicat ions based on known expression pattern of PD -L1/PD -1, 
available preclinical data, and recent clinical data utilizing nivo lumab ( Ansell, 2015) or 
pembro lizumab ( Moskowi tz, 2014 )in R/Rclassical HL and promising early data of pi[INVESTIGATOR_432768] ( West in, 2014 )in DLBCL or FL , respectively; also 
nivolumab monotherapy  (Lesokhi n, 2014 ) has shown antitumor activit y in DLBCL, FL ,and T -
cell lympho mas.    
The programmed cell death -1 (PD -1) plays an important role in the regulat ion of the immune 
response.  The PD -[ADDRESS_548399] ions 
to regulate the immune system primarily by  [CONTACT_432858] T -cell receptor.  PD -
L1 expressed on tumor cells binds to PD -1 on T -cells which leads to down -regulation o f T-cell 
activit y and allows tumor cells to evade the immune response.  
Based on in vitro studies, an ant ibody  that bl ocks the interaction between PD
-L1 and i ts 
receptors can relieve PD -L1-dependent immunosuppressive effects and enhance the cytotoxic 
activit y of antitumor T -cells ( Blank, 2007 ). The l evels o f tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and 
more specifically  cytotoxi c T-cells, have been cor related with improved prognosis in a number 
of cancers including co lorectal , melano ma, and lung ( Galon, 2006; Clemente, 1996; Dieu -
Nosjean, 2008, Hodi 2010 ). Based on these findings, an ant i-PD-L1 antibody  coul d be used 
therapeuti cally to enhance ant itumor immune responses in mult iple forms of cancer. Results of 
several preclinical studies using mouse myelo ma models support this hypothesis ( Gorgu n, 2015; 
Hirano, 2005; Iwai, 2002; Kearl , 2013; Okudai ra, 2009; Zhang, 2008 ). In these studies, 
antibodies directed against PD -L1 or its receptor, PD -1, dem onstrated antitumor activit y by 
[CONTACT_432859] -MM immune responses. In addit ion to the limited aforement ioned clinical data in 
NHL wi th agents that in hibit PD- 1, there are several other preclinical and prognostic 
observat ions in various lympho ma subt ypes that lead us to believe that PD- 1/PD -L1 inhibit ion 
may prove to be efficacious:

1.3.3. Rationale for the S tudy Design
The safet y of durvalumab has already  been expl ored and assessed in other hematology  and 
oncol ogy patient populat ions. No dose limit ing toxicit y has been defined to date. Dosing was 
originally based on weight and ranged up to 10 mg/kg once every  2 weeks (Q2W) and 20 mg/kg 
once every 4 weeks (Q4W). Pharmacokinet ic analysis demo nstrated that fixed dosing had 
equivalent vari abilit yto wei ght based dosing.  Based on an average weight of 75 kg, a fixed dose 
of 1500 mg Q4W is now being explored as a dose that provides continuous plasma concentration 
of antibody  above the thresho ld needed for in vitro activit y. The dose of 1500 mg Q4W is the 
recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) across the durvalumab clinical program (for ongoi ng or 
planned studi es in both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies).  Over 1000 patients with 
solid tumors and myelodysplastic syndrome were treated at a dose schedule equivale nt to 
1500 mg Q4W (ie, 10 m g/kg Q2W or 20 m g/kg Q4W which show similar exposure levels based 
on the area under the curves steady  state ),and available safet y data support this as an appropri ate 
dose for durvalumab in this study .  Please refer to the Durvalumab IB for further informat ionand 
Secti on 1.3.4 .
There i s no pri or clinical experience wit h durvalumab monotherapy in lymphom a/CLL or in 
combinat ion with lenalido mide, bendamust ine, ibrutinib, or rituximab.  A parallel dose -
finding/confirmat ion or expansio n design was selected to confirm the safet y of the 1500 m g

to obtain addit ional safet y, pharmacokinet ics (PK), pharmacodynamics (Pd)and efficacy data in 
specific lympho ma histologies and CLL , and thereby  [CONTACT_432860].
1.3.4. Rationale for Dose, S chedule ,and Regimen Selection
The dose and schedule for durvalumab monotherapy  (20 m g/kg Q4W) were selected based on 2 
sets of data: ( i) the safet y analysis o f doses (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg Q2W) administered in 
Study  CD-ON-MEDI4736- 1108 (a Phase 1/2 study to evaluate th e safet y, tolerabilit y, and PK of  
durvalumab IV given as monotherapy  in subjects with advanced so lid tumors ); and ( ii) PK 
profile simulat ions for durval umab administered using 10 mg/kg Q2W and 20 mg/kg Q4W 
schedules.
Safety and PK characteristics of the studied dose and schedule 10 mg/kg Q2W:
After evaluat ion of the PK data fro m subjects enrolled in Study  CD-ON-MEDI4736- 1108, 
durvalumab exhibited nonlinear (dose dependent) PK consistent with target -mediated drug 
disposi tion.  Linear PK was observed at dos es of 3 mg/kg and higher and is consistent with near 
complete target suppression, as reflected in target trough plasma concentrations of drug 
> 100 ug/mL .This trough concentration is supported by  [CONTACT_27641] -L1 (sPD -L1) suppressio n 
data. Furthermore, the 10 mg/kg Q2W dose was not associated with any dose limit ing toxicit ies 
(DLTs) in the dose escalation portion and was, therefore, selected for further evaluation in the 
dose expansio n porti on of  Study  CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108.
Extrapolation of dose and schedule of 10 mg/kg Q2W to 20 mg/kg Q4W through population PK 
modeling:
A population PK model was developed using durvalumab mo notherapy  data from  Phase 1 of 
Study  CD-ON-MEDI4736- 1108 ( N =292; doses = 0.1 to 10 mg/kg Q2W or 15 mg/kg once 
every 3 weeks ; solid tumors) ( Fairman, 2014 ). This populat ion PK model adequately described 
monotherapy  PK data and was utilized to predict expected PK exposures fo llowing 20 mg/kg
Q4W dosing regimens (since none o f the monotherapy  studi es explored Q4W regimens).   
Pharmacokinet ic simulat ions indicate that a similar overall exposure as represented by [CONTACT_432861] (AUC ss)(4 weeks) is expected fo llowing both 10 m g/kg Q2W and
20mg/kg Q4W regimens. However, median maximum plasma concentrati on (Cmax)at steady  
state i s expected to be higher with 20 mg/kg Q4W (~1.5 fold) and median trough concentration 
at steady  state i s expected to be higher with 10 mg/kg Q2W (~1.25 fold). 
Justification for fixed dos ing over w eight -based dosing:
Popul ation PK analysis indicated only minor impact of body  weight on PK of durvalumab 
(coefficient of ≤ 0.5). The impact of body weight -based (10 mg/kg Q2W) and fixed dosing 
(750 mg Q2W ) of durvalumab was evaluated by  [CONTACT_432862] (5th, median, and 95th percent iles) using the populat ion PK m odel. A fixed dose 
of 750 m g was selected to approximate 10 mg/kg (based on median body  weight of ~75 kg).   A 
total of 1000 pati ents were simulated usi ng body  weight distribut ion of 40 to 120 kg. Simulat ion

1.3.5. Rationale for Choice of Combination Compounds
[IP_ADDRESS]. Rituximab and Lenalidomide
Lenalido mide has pl eiotropi c act ivities including a capacit y to activate NK cells, to increase T -
cell proliferat ion and function, and to enhance macrophage -mediated ADCC of rituximab -coated 
tumor cells.  The main mo lecular target of lenalidomide is the E3 ubiquit in ligase cereblo n that 
was recent ly shown to trigger induct ion of cy tokine producti on by  T-cells.  F ollicular lympho ma
infiltrat ing CD4+ and CD8+ tumor induced immunosuppressio n in the context of increased 
expressio n of B7 -related inhibitory  ligands (including PD -L1) down -regulates activated Rho -
GTPases RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, key  regul ators of T -cell synapse act in dynamics.  T -cells 
display immunological synapse dysfunct ion with impaired F -actin polymerizat ion and reduced 
effector funct ion.  Lenali domi de can repai r the Rho A m ediated T -cell synapse defect present in 
cancer patients thereby  [CONTACT_89511] T -cell funct ions and potentially enabling the effect of 
immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ( Greaves ,2013; Ramsay , 2013
;Gribben, 2015). 
Lenalido mide clinical trials wit h registration intent are ongoing with the combinat ion of 
lenalido mide and rituximab in relapsed, refractory and first line FL, based on Phase [ADDRESS_548404] ing that this co mbination may be a reasonable alternative to tradit ional chem o

immunotherapy  (Fowler , 2014; Leonard, 2015 )
Preclinical studies wit h respect to MM have demo nstrated that lenalido mide enhances immune 
checkpoint blockade ( ie,anti-PD-1/PD -L1)induced immune response in pat ient-derived 
primary  myel oma cells; this may represent a novel immune -based therapeutic strategy  to treat 
MM and other B -cell neopl asms ( Gorgun, 2015 ). Other studies dem onstrate that l enalido mide 
reduced PD -L1 expressio n on myelo ma cells ( Benson, 2010 ), and that lenalido mide exposure 
resul ted in a decrease in the expressio n of PD -1 on T -cells and induced amplified responses t

Ibrutinib is a covalent BTK inhibitor which affects 3 key  neoplastic B-cell processes: a) inhibit s 
proliferat ion/survival; b) inhibits adhesio n; and c) modulates chemotaxis . It is US FDA 
approved for patients with 17p -deleti on CLL and for CLL or MCL patients who have received at 
least one prior therapy . Ibrutinib has also demonstrated preferent ial clinical response activit y in 
activated B -cell-like versus germinal center B -cell like DLBCL in a mo notherapy  clinical trial of 
relapsed DLBCL ( Wilson, 2015) as well as moderate single -agent activit y in R/RFL 
(Fowler , 2012). Recent ly, Stanford Universit y investigators demonstr ated that the combinat ion 
of anti-PD-L1 antibodies and ibrutinib suppressed tumor growth in mouse models of lympho ma 
insensit ive to ibrutinib and enhanced antitumor T -cell immune responses , based in part on the 
abilit y of ibrutinib to inhibit interleukin -
2-inducible T -cell kinase and thus potentially  enhance 
Thelper 1 based immune responses (Sagiv -Barfi, 2015). These findings, along with ibrut inib’s 
favorable toxicity profile, m ake i t a good choi ce to study  in combinat ion with durvalumab in a 
variet y of lympho ma histol ogies. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Bendamustine and Rituximab
Bendamust ine is an alkylat ing agent which structure also shows similarit ies to purine analogues. 
It has ant itumor activit y in both hematologic and solid tumors. The combinat ion of 
bendamustine and rituximab is highly ut ilized clinically to treat FL, CLL/SLL, and MCL around 
the world. 
Of interest, a Phase 2 mult icenter study  of bendamustine and rituximab in o lderpatients wi th 
previously untreated DLBCL ( N =
23) demonstrated an overall response rate of 93% ( complete 
response [CR] rate of 60%) in 15 evaluable patients with a time to progression of 7.4 months 
(Spi[INVESTIGATOR_28947], 2014); in addit ion,2 sm all clinical tri als o f bendamustine and rituximab in R/R DLBCL 
demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 50 to 60% and a median progressi on-free 
survival (PFS) of approximately 7 months (Arcari, 2014; Ohmachi, 2013 ).  Bendamust ine has 
also been used in R/R FL, MCL ,and other indo lent lympho mas (Rummel, 2005 ) as well as CLL 
(Fischer, 2011 ).
It may seem counterintuit ive to use bendamust ine in a trial init ializing an ant i PD-L1 m onocl onal 
antibody .The use of rituximab maintenance therapy  following bendamust ine plus rituximab 
induct ion in lympho ma has been shown to be associated with sustained CD4 lymp hopenia 
(Yutaka , 2015) ; however, it appears that fludarabine andrituximab based therapy  (without 
rituximab maintenance) in low grade lympho ma appears to result in an even lo nger recovery  
time for circulat ing T -cells in peripheral blood ( Czuczman, 2005
).  The correlation of T -cell 
subsets between blood versus marrow/nodal co mpartments and their changes fo llowing exposure 
to durvalumab is unknown and is part of the correlative studies on this trial. It may be 
hypothesized th at T-cells wit hin the tum or/marrow microenvironment may st ill be present and 
responsive to agents targeting the PD -1/PD -L1 axis (even if they are significant ly decreased or 
even absent in peripheral blood).

check -point inhibitor plus IFRT requires further elucidat ion.
Immunologicresponses to l ocalized radiation therapy  leading to sy stemic antitumor effects in 
non-radiated tum or sites (called the abscopal effect) is ver y rare event and l argely  reported as 
case studi es in the past ( Reynders, 2015) . Theoretically, recent advances in the field of immune -
oncol ogy indicates that si gnificant increase in the incidence of “abscopal” effects may  become 
realit y when immune checkpoint inhibitors are combined with limited field radiation therapy  
(Almo, 2014).
A review on this topic describes the critical ro le of radiat ion therapy  (with appropri ate dose and 
fraction [not kno wn]) causes an “in situ” vaccination by [CONTACT_432863] “neoant igen” release for 
dendtri ticcross -presentation; if this occurs in the setting of immune check -point bl ocked 
immunotherapy  (eg,anti-PD-L1), the tum or-specific immune response is triggered/enhan ced and 
can lead to a systemic antitumor activit y in the host. It is unknown which regimen of radiat ion 
therapy is optimal in maximizing this abscopal effect, but it is suggested that hy pofractionated 
radiation therapy may be better than convent ional or hy per-fractionated techniques ( Teng, 2015 ).
Therefore, for subjects enrolled in all study  arms, at time of progressive lymphoma or CLL , 
IFRT (to evaluate for possible abscopal effect) is all owed.  
1.3.6. Rationale for Pharmacodynamics and Potential Predictive Biomarkers 
Durvalumab binds human PD -L1 wi th high affinit y and blocks i ts abili ty to bind PD -1.  This 
restores immune activation wit h downstream effects on cy tokine producti on, proliferation, cell 
survival, and transcription factors associated with effector T- cell function.  Measurements of 
pharmacodynamic bio markers, such as so luble PD -L1 saturation and immune cell act ivation 
status, could help with understanding the pharmacological effect of durvalumab and contribute to 
the deci sion of dose and schedule select ion. 
A key  scientific object ive of this clinical study  is to evaluate the dynamic changes in the 
microenvironment of the tumor.  While understanding the immunologic characteristics at 
baseline m ay be both predi ctive and prognostic, it will be extremely crit ical to understand the 
changes in the local immune system fo llowing treatm ent wi th durval umab and the combinat ion 
agents.  Bio marker analysis o f durvalumab in NSCLC patients demonstrat ed a statistically 
significant increase in CD8+ infiltrating lymphocytes from on -treatm ent tum or sam ples 
compared wi th pretreatm ent bi opsies (Rizvi, 2015 ).  Furtherm ore, durval umab treatment induces 
IFNγ and effector T -cell an d type 1 T -helper (Th -1) cell gene expression wit hin the NSCLC 
biopsies within 4 to 8 weeks of treatment ( Higgs, 2016), indicat ing a more inflamed tumor 
microenvironment.  This data is consistent with the pharmacodynamic effec ts observed in tumor 
biopsies fro m patients treated wi th atezolizumab (PD -L1 inhibitor) and pembrolizumab (PD -1 
inhibitor).  For pembro lizumab, increasing o f CD8+ densit y at tum or or invasive margin after 
treatm ent is observed in responders while absent in progressors in melano ma, indicat ing that the 
CD8+ TILs were activated and targeting the tumor ( Tumeh, 2014 ).  Seri al biopsy analyses for 
atezolizumab showed that increases in PD -L1 protein expression and genes indicat ive of 
activated T cells (eg, granzyme, IFNγ) were more frequently observed in pat ients who respond to 
the therapy  com pared wi th the non -responders ( Herbst, 2014 ).  Notably, while pharmacodynamic

clinical decisio ns early in pat ient treatment and reveal  new targets/addi tional immune system  
pathways that may  be targeted to improve therapeutic outcomes.
Pretreatment biopsies will be used to assess bio markers that may be predict ive of response to 
durvalumab combinat ion therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014].  Experi ence o f durvalumab in so lid tumors showed that 
greater responses were observed in subjects with PD- L1-positive, and a much lower rate of 
responses in subjects with PD- L1-negat ive tumors ( Segal, 2014 ). Thus, con tinue d evaluat ion of 
these bio markers and a broad exploration of addit ional bio markers related to immuno logical and 
disease factors are needed to help the identificat ion of potenti al predict ive bio markers for the 
therapy .
A number of recent studies have reporte d correlation between several mo lecular markers, 
including expressio n level o f PD-L1 in tumor and immune cells, gene expressio n patterns, 
neoant igen presentation and T cell clo nality, and the clinical  activi ty of immune checkpoint 
inhibitors ( Topalian, 2012; Herbst, 2014 ).  More recent data indicates that a combinat ion of 
elevated PD -L1 protein expressio n and elevated IFNγ gene expressio n in pretreatment tumor 
biopsies may predict the best response to durvalumab mo notherapy  (Higgs, 2015 ; Higgs, 2016 ). 
Non-Hodgkin lympho ma is a heterogeneous patient populat ion with multiple diseases. 
Genet ic/cytogeneti c changes have been shown to be ass ociated wi th disease prognosi s.  Gene 
expressio n signatures related to cell o f origin or other disease mechanism may define disease 
subtypes wi th different ial response.   Baseline disease specific bio markers such as genet ics/gene 
expressio n signatures will be measured in the study. The samples collected in the study  may be 
utilized for unbiased genet ic/geno mic analysis to understand disease or mechanism o f action for 
singl e or combinat ion therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
Multi-color flow cytometry techni ques will be used to m onitor minimal residual disease (MRD) 
in MCL and CLL as well as po lymerase chain reaction techni ques in FL.  Newer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_432769], have increased the partial response (PR)and complete response (CR)
rates dram atically in vari ous histol ogies. Consequent ly, to adapt treatment intensit y, extend 
durati on of  response, and prolong progression free survival, more sensit ive clinical assessment 
methods are necessary  to better define treatment outcomes at the molecular level.  The MRD 
assessments in MCL, CLL, and FL histologies in this study  will be an addit ional tool  for 
assessment of response and outcome.
Overall, t hese bio marker data will facilitate better understan ding of the mechanism of act ion for 
durvalumab alone or in co mbination wit h other agents to facilitate future clinical trial designs.  
The data may also reveal new targets/addit ional immune system pathways to improve therapeut ic 
outcom es.

Protocol  MEDI4736- NHL -001 Celgene Internat ional II Sarl
Confident ial and Propri etary 45 MEDI4736 -NHL -001 Amendment #4 Final : 22 Apr 2020In the dose finding part (Phase 1) , a preliminary RP2D will be established for each durvalumab 
combinat ion treatment using a 3 + 3 design ( Storer, 1989 ).  For Arms A and C, prior to enrolling 
subjects to receive all 3 drugs, the doublet combinations (ie, Arm A: durvalumab and 
lenalido mide and Arm C: durvalumab and rituximab) will be evaluated.  Once the doublet 
combinat ions are deemed tolerable, the eve ntual tripl et combinati on will  be tested.  The 
durvalumab starting dose is fixed in each of these arms.  Three to 6 evaluable subjects will be 
evaluated in each dose finding cohort; therefore, approximately 15 to 60 (DLT evaluable )
subjects wi th B-cell NHL or CLL are anticipated to be enro lled in the dose finding part.  Subjects 
with CLL/SLL will not be eligible for Arm A.  The final number of subjects will depend on the 
number of dose levels tested and thenumber of DLTs observed wit hin each cohort.  The 
durvalumab monotherapy  arm will not have a dose finding cohort as the preliminary  RP2D has 
been established ,but it will need to be confirmed.
In Arms A, B, and C, an init ial cohort of 3 subjects will be enrolled to a specific dose level to 
assess toxicit ies, before addit ional subjects are treated i n that arm .  A dose l evel will be 
considered tolerable if 0 o f 3 evaluable subjects experiences a DLT during the DLT evaluat ion 
period (ie,from the first IPdose through complet ion of Cycle 1 in Arms A, B, and C ).  If 1 of 3
subjects experiences a DLT, up to 3 more subjects will be enro lled atthat dose level.  A dose 
will be considered tolerable if ≤ 1 of 6 evaluable subjects experiences a DLT during the DLT 
evaluat ion peri od (defined in Section 7.2.2 ).  A dose will be considered to be 
a non tolerated 
dose (NTD) if ≥2 of 3 or 6 evaluable subjects ata dose level experience a DLT.  The maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the highest dose level below the NTD with 0 of 3 or ≤[ADDRESS_548412] 
at the sam e dose level.
After full enro llment and co mpletion of the DLT evaluat ion peri od of  each dose l evel, the 
number and t ype of DLTs and adverse events (AEs) occurring during the DLT evaluat ion peri od 
of that dose l evel will be assessed by [CONTACT_49750] y review co mmittee (SRC ),which includes the 
sponsor’s medical mo nitor, drug safet y physic ian, and a subset of investigators who are 
participat ing in this cli nical study .  If a dose l evel is consi dered tol erable by [CONTACT_12217], the SRC 
may recommend to the sponsor that subsequent dose finding or dose confirmat ioncohorts may 
open for enrollment.
During the dose finding part, the decisio n to evaluate the subsequent dose level for a 
combinat ion agent, an intermediate dose leve l, different dosing schedule s not currently  specified
(eg,rituximab dosing Q4W, ri tuximab dosing in mid-cycle ,start of rituximab dosing after Cy cle 
1, or changes in dose and schedule of other s tudy drugs such as lenalido mide ), the need to add 
additional subjects wi thin any dose cohort, or to declare a dose level as tolerable will be 
assessed , recommended and docum ented by [CONTACT_432865] a given dose cohort. 
The SRC will identify a preliminary  RP2D for each treatment arm (except Arm D) based on an 
integrated assessment of the safet y, available PK and Pd data, and preliminary  efficacy 
inform ation.
In the dose confirmation part (Phase 1) , once the preliminary  RP2D i s established, each 
combinat ion treatment arm will enro ll approxim ately  10 subjects wi th each pre specified disease

tolerabilit y and safet y of the RP2D and identify the strongest antitumor signal in those 
histol ogies. The Arm D dose confirmat ion cohort will be open at study  start and enroll a total of 
approximately  30 subjects into up to 5 cohorts.  In total, approximately  100 subjects are 
anticipated to enroll in the dose confirmat ion part. The Arm D dose confirmat ion cohort 
(durvalumab mo notherapy) will start at the same time as the dose finding cohorts of the other [ADDRESS_548413] igated with durvalumab within 
this protocol  (eg, lenalido mide ± rituximab ; rituximab ± bendamust ine;rituximab; or ibrut inib) 
once a tolerable dose level is co nfirmed for that combinat ion (in Arm D it will be permissible for 
the invest igator to add rituximab alo ne if they consider that it is in the subject’s best interest), or 
the invest igator may add local IFRT (please see Section 6.2for further details) .  Pri or to addi tion 
of another therapy  to durval umab, the invest igator must consult with the sponsor’s medical 
monitor.
If a promising ant itumor signal is detected in any dose confirmation cohort, that cohort will 
expand and enroll approximately15 addit ional subjects to further assess the efficacy and to guide 
the future development of these invest igational treatments in th e dose expansion part 
(Phase 2).  In total, approximately [ADDRESS_548414] ion 6.4.  The 
efficacy  assessments for CLL will be based on the modified International Workshop on Chronic 
Lymphocy tic Leukemia (IWCLL) Response Criteria for CLL ( Hallek, 2008 ; Hallek, 2012 ; 
Hallek, 2013 ) and for lymphoma based on the Internat ional Working Group (IWG) Response 
Criteria for Malignant Lympho ma (the Lugano Classification) ( Cheson, 2014).
The SRC will continue to review safet y data regularly  throughout the study  for all cohorts in a 
treatm ent arm  for late toxi cities (which are clearly  not rel ated to disease progression or 
concurrent illness) which may result in the need for dose reduction or discont inuat ion to m ake 
recommendat ions on dose m odificat ions (eg, alternate schedule or dose levels not currently 
specified ) as appropri ate.  In addit ion, the SRC will review efficacy, PK or Pd data as available 
in order to make recommendations on, including, but not limited to, treatment cohort/study  
continuat ion and expansio n in specific disease hist ology .  Each treatm ent arm  may have a 
separate SRC as appropriate.
The study  will also have a gl obal scientific steering committee (GSSC) providing advice to the 
sponsor regarding study protocol design/amendments, study  conduct and scient ific integrit y of 
the study  as well  as provi ding gui dance to each SRC as appropriate.   The global scient ific 
steering co mmittee will serve in an adv isory  capaci ty to the sponsor. 
Operati onal details for the SRC and GSSC will be detailed in a separate charter document.
The sponsor will decide whether or not to open any dose confirmat ion or expansio n cohort as 
well as decide whether or not to adjust t he number of subjects enrolled into any planned cohort 
based on the recommendations of the SRC and/or GSSC and relevant emerging clinical or non -
clinical data. Please see Sect ion 9.3.2 for the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_432771] s for efficacy .

Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_432772].  These at ypi[INVESTIGATOR_432773], or by  [CONTACT_432866], with o rwithout regression of exist ing 
tumor lesions(Cheson, 2016).  
For subjects in all cohorts and treatment arms, if asubject demonstrates early “tumor 
progression” ( defined as occurring prior to or during Cycle 3 of durvalumab), the invest igator is 
responsible for evaluat ing whether the subject is experiencing a possible pseudoprogression (ie, 
tumor flare which is local inflammatory  react ion indicat ing early tumor response at sites of 
disease such as lymph nodes ) which has been described in subjects with so lid tumors being 
treated with durvaluma b.
In situations where subjects are experiencing pseu doprogression as assessed by  [CONTACT_3170], 
subjects may  cont inue the study  treatm ent until a repeat scan, within [ADDRESS_548415] be considered likely to tolerate continued treatment and 
not at ri sk of serious co mplicationsin case of further tumor growth. Please refer to “Refinement 
of Lugano Classification lymphoma response criteria in the era of immunomodulatory therapy ” 
for further gui dance ( Cheson, 2016).
In situations where subjects are experiencing documented true tum or progressi on as determined 
by [CONTACT_093] , subjects shoul d be di scontinued from  the study  treatment.
3.1.2. Criteria for Adding Combination Agent or Local Involved Field Radiation 
Therapy to Durvalumab Monotherapy at the time of Progression (Arm D)
For subjects in the durvalumab monotherapy  arm (Arm  D), at the time of disease progression, 
the invest igator m ay add study  treatm ents invest igated with durvalumab in this protocol (ie, 
lenalido mide ± rituximab *; bendamust ine± rituximab; ri tuximab ; or ibrut inib) once a dose l evel 
of a rel evant combinat ion therapy  is deemed as tolerable by  [CONTACT_12217] ,or subjects can receive 
local invo lved field radiat ion therapy  (IFRT) to a single invo lved nodal  site (ie, to evaluate for a 
systemic abscopal antitumor effect) .   
Subjects with CLL/SLL and RT will not be eligible to receive lenalido mide, and subjects with 
HL will not be eligible to receive ibrutinib.   
Decision sabout what addit ional treatment (s)will be 
added will be made in consultation wit h the sponsor’s medical mo nitor.
The add -on combination treatment with lenalidomide ± rituximab is no longer allowed.*
For adding a combinat ion agent , asubject must meet the fo llowing cri teria:
1.Has documented disease progression while on durvalumab mo notherapy .
2.Has not received other ant icancer/ant ilymphoma treatments for their disease following 
progression after durvalumab monotherapy .

Durvalumab must be administered at room temperature by  [CONTACT_62657] n via an infusio n 
pump into a peri pheral  vein or central  line. Please see the Pharma cy Manual for further details.
[IP_ADDRESS].1.2. Monitoring of Dose Administration
Vitals signs will be m onitored before, during and after infusio n at the times specified in the 
Schedule of Assessment. Subjects are monitored (pulse rate, blood pressure , and body  
temperature ) every  30 minutes during the infusio n period (including times where infusion rate is 
slowed or tem porarily stopped).
In the event of a ≤Grade 2 infusio n-related reaction, the infusion rate of durvalumab may be 
decreased by  50% or interrupted u ntil resolut ion of the event (up to 4 hours) and reinit iated at 
50% of the init ial rate until co mpletion o f the infusio n.For subjects with a ≤Grade 2 
infusio n-related reacti on, subsequent infusio ns may be administered at 50% of the init ial rate.
Acetam inophen/ paracetam ol and/or an ant ihistamine (eg, diphenhydramine) or equivalent 
medicat ions per inst itutional standard may  be administered at the discret ion of the invest igator.
If the infusio n-related reaction is Grade [ADDRESS_548548] infusio n time is one hour, however if there are interruptions during infusio n, the 
total allowed time from  infusio n start to completion of infusio n should not exceed 4 hours at 
room  temperature, wi th maximum  total  time at room  temperature not exceeding 4 hours 
(otherwise requires new infusio n preparation).  
As wi th any antibody , allergic reactions to dose administration are possible. Appropriate drugs 
and medical equipment to treat acute anaphylact ic reacti ons must be immediately available, and 
study  personnel must be trained to recognize and treat anaphylaxis. The study  site must have 
immediate access to emergency resuscitat ion teams and equipment in addit ion to the abilit y to

[IP_ADDRESS]. Dose Modification for Durvalumab
Based on the mechanism o f action of  durvalumab leading to T -cell act ivation and proliferat ion, 
there is the possibilit y of observing i mAEs during the conduct of this study . Potenti al imAEs 
may be similar to those seen with the use of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], BMS- 936558, and BMS -936559 and 
may include immune -mediate d enterocolit is, dermatit is, hepatit is, and endocrinopathies ( Hodi , 
2010; Brahmer , 2012 ;Topalian, 2013). Subjects shoul d be m onitored f or signs and symptom s of 
i
mAEs. In the absence of an alternate etio logy (eg, infect ion or disease progression ), an 
immune -related eti ology shoul d be considered for signs or symptoms of enterocolit is, dermatit is,

In addition to the criteria for perma nent discontinuation of 
IP/regimen based on CTC AE grade/severity (table below), 
permanently discontinue IP/study regimen for the following 
conditio ns: 
Inability to reduce corticosteroid to a dose of ≤ 10 
mg of prednisone per day (or equivalent) within 
12weeks after last dose of IP/regimen
Recurrence of a previously experienced Grade 3 
treatment -related AE following resumption of

mediated adverse events (imAEs) follow the 
guidelines presented below:
-It ispossible that events with an inflammatory or 
immune-mediated mechanism could occur in 
nearly  all o rgans, some of them not noted 
specifically in these guidelines.
-Whether specific immune -mediated events 
(and/o r laboratory indicators of such events) are 
notedin these guidelines or not, s ubjects should 
be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any 
alternative etiology (eg, disease progression, 
concomitant medications, infections) to a possible 
immune-mediated event. In the absence of a clear 
alternative etiology, all such events should be 
managed as if they were immune related. General 
recommendations follow.

etiology (eg, disease progression, infections, metab olic

diagnosis of immune -mediated peripheral neuromotor
syndromes can be particularly challenging in subjects with 
underlying cancer, due to the multiple potential 
confounding effects of cancer (and its treatments) 
throughout the neuraxis. Given the importance of prompt 
and accurate diagnosis, it is essential to have a low 
threshold to obtain a neurological consult

−The prompt diagnosis of immune -mediated myocarditis is 
important, particularly in subjects with baseline 
cardiopulmonary disease and reduced cardiac function. 
−Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study physician.
−Monitor subjects for signs and symp toms of myocarditis 
(new onset or worsening chest pain, arrhythmia, shortness 
of breath, peripheral edema). As some symptoms can 
overlap with lung toxicities, simultaneously evaluate for 
and rule out pulmonary toxicity as well as other causes (eg , 
pulmo nary embolism, congestive heart failure, malignant 
pericardial effusion). A cardiology consultation should be 
obtained early, with prompt assessment of whether and 
when to complete a cardiac biopsy, including any other 
diagnostic procedures.

Myositis/Po
lymyositis 
(“Poly/myo

−Monitor subjects for signs and symptoms of poly/myositis. 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] , muscle weakness/pain occurs in proximal 
muscles including upper arms, thighs, shoulders, hips, neck 
and back, but rarely affects the extremities including hands 
and fingers; also difficulty breathing and/or trouble 
swallowing can occur and progress rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] . Increased 
general feelings of tiredness and fatigue may occur, and 
there can be new -onset falling, difficulty getting up from a 
fall, and trouble climbing stairs, standing up from a seated 
position, and/or reaching up.
−If poly/myositis is suspected, a neurology consultation 
should be obtained early, with prompt guidance on 
diagnostic procedures. Myocarditis may co -occur with 
poly/myositis; refer to guidance under Myocarditis. Given 
breathing complications, refer to guidance under 
Pneumo nitis/ILD. 
Given possibility of an existent (but previously unknown) 
autoimmune disorder, consider rheumatology consultation.
−Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study physician.
−Initial work -up should include clinical evaluation, creatine 
kinase, aldolase, LDH, BUN /creatinine, e rythrocy te 
sedimentation rate or C- reactive protein level , urine 
myoglobin, and additional laboratory work -up as indicated, 
including a number of possible rheumatological/antibody 
tests (ie, consider whether a rheumatologist consultation is 
indicated and could guide need for rheumatoid factor, 
antinuclear antibody, anti -smooth muscle, antisynthetase 
[such as anti -Jo-1], and/or signal -recognition particle 
antibodies). Confirmatory testing may include 
electromy ography , nerve conduction studies, MRI of the
muscles, and/or a muscle biopsy. Consider barium swallowdurvalumab

−Obtain neurology consult, and initiate evaluation.
−Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study physician.
−If clinical course is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_10480] (particularly if 
difficulty breathing and/or trouble swallowing), promptly 
start IV methylprednisolone 2 to 4 mg/kg/day systemic 
steroids along with receiving input from neurology 
consultant 
−If clinical course is notrapi[INVESTIGATOR_432812], start systemic 
steroids (e g, prednisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day PO or IV 
equivalent); if no improvement within 3 to 5 days, continue

Assignment of subjects to Arms A, B, C, and D, or each planned disease cohort within a 
treatm ent arm  will be based on current open dose levels (DL) and available slots.  
Arm A is discont inued to the enrollment of new subjects. Only subjects currently enrolled and 
receiving clinical benefit, based on the discretion of the Invest igator, can remain on treatment 
after being informed and reconsent.
An IR T will be used to track subject assignments to the treatment arms and dose levels.   
7.4. Overdose
Overdose, as defined for this protocol, refers to durvalumab (IV), lenalido mide (PO), ibrutinib 
(PO), ri tuximab (IV), bendamust ine (IV) , or local IFRT (involved field radiat ion therapy ).  On a 
per-dose basis, an overdose is defined as the fo llowing amount over the protocol -specified dose 
of these drug(s) assigned to a given subject, regardless of any  associated AEs or sequel ae:
PO: any amount over the protocol -specified dose
IV:10% over the protocol -specified dose
Radiation therapy :any amount over the protocol -specified dose
On a schedule or frequency  basis, an overdose i s defined as any thing more frequent than the 
protocol  requi red schedule or frequency .  On an infusio n rate basis, an overdose is defined as any 
rate faster than the protocol -specified rate.
Com plete data about drug administration, including any  overdose, regardl ess of whether the 
overdose was accidental or intent ional, shoul d be reported in the CR F.  See Section 10for the 
reporting of AEs associated with overdose.

8.1. Permitted /Recommended Concomitant Medications and Procedures
Invest igators may prescribe concomitant medicat ions or treatments deemed necessary to provide 
adequate supportive care except for those medicat ions ident ified as “excluded” as listed in 
Secti on 8.2. 
Specifically , subjects shoul d receive full supportive care during the study , including transfusio ns 
of blood and bl ood products, and treatm ent wi th antib iotics, ant iemetics, ant idiarrheals , and 
analgesics, and other care as deemed appropriate, and in accordance with their inst itutional 
guidelines.
8.1.1. Growth Factors and Transfusions for Cytopenia (All Arms )
Growth factors (eg, G -CSF, GM -CSF, erythropoi etin,etc) may be prescribed during the 
Treatment and Fo llow-up Peri ods at the invest igator ’s discretion and should be used in 
accordance with the American Societ y of Clinical  Oncol ogy’s (ASCO) gui delines or the 
European Societ y for Medi cal Onco logy guidelines.  
Granulocyte co lony stimulat ing factor i s recommended to be used to mit igate the duration of 
neutropeni a for any  subject requi ring a dose modificat ion due to neutropenia.
Growth factors or platelet transfusio ns should not be administered during the Screenin g Period to 
increase a subject’s blood values in order to meet entry  criteria.
In Phase 1, Dose Finding :  Erythropoietic and hematopoietic growth factors ( eg, filgrastim 
and pegfilgrastim) as well as transfusional support (packed red blood cells and platel ets) 
should not be given during the DLT observation period .  If they  are administered thi s will  be 
an indicat ion of possible DLT .  Ho wever, it is permitted at the invest igator’s discretion after a 
subject completes the first cy cle or wi thin the first cy cleif a hematological DLT has already been 
declared for that subject .
8.1.2. Infection Prophylaxis (All Arms )
Invest igators may use their discret ion in administering infect ion prophylaxis for subjects 
regarded to be at high risk (including, for example, but not lim ited to: acy clovir or similar drug 
for herpes zoster; trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazo le for Pneumocystis jiroveci infect ion).  Moni tor 
patients f or fever, neutropenia and infecti ons and appropri ate ant iinfect ive therapy should be

It is not known whether prophylact ic ant icoagulation or antiplatelet therapy prescribed in 
conjunction with lenalido mide may lessen the potent ial for venous thromboembolism
(VTE) . The decisio n to take prop hylact ic measures should be made carefully after an assessment 
of an individual subject’s underlying risk factors.
As reference information, for subjects receiving lenalido mide in open -label trials, it is strongly 
recommended that subjects at risk for VTE receive either aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (70 –325 m g PO daily) or 
another prophylaxis agent while on lenalido mide.   In those subjects with a high risk of VTE, it is 
strongly  recommended that the subject receive prophylact ic ant icoagulation therapy  with low 
molecular weight heparin, or heparin (dose recommended for the prophylaxis of deep vein 
thrombosis / pulmo nary embo lism per the package insert), or warfarin (to maintain an INR of 
2.0).  The cho ice of VTE prophylaxis agent relies upon the investigator’s discret ion and shou ld 
be tailored to the subject’s individual risk/benefit profile by [CONTACT_210046] t the individual 
thrombotic risk, bleeding risk, and the qualit y of com pliance wi th the VTE prophylaxis.
8.1.4. Nausea Prophylaxis (Bendamustine)
Prem edicat ion with an ant iemetic pri or to bendamustine infusio n is recommended according to 
local practice.
8.1.5. Infusion Reaction Prophylaxis (Rituximab, Bendamustine, Durvalumab )
Prem edicat ion consist ing of acetaminophen and an antihistamine should be adminis tered before 
each ri tuximab infusio n (see package insert or where applicable refer to the instruction in the 
Pharmacy Manual). Steroids may also be administered before the start of the rituximab infusio n 
according to inst itutional pract ice.  Surveillance measures during and after infusio n of ri tuximab 
shoul d be applied as recommended by  [CONTACT_941] m anufacturer/current guidelines.
Infusio n react ions with bendamustine, which may include chills, fever, pruritus, and rash, are 
commo n.Rarely, anaphylact ic and anaphylactoi d reacti ons have occurred, particularly with the 
second or subsequent cy cle(s).   
Subjects who experienced grade [ADDRESS_548585] ine or durvalumab .
8.1.6. Early Anti tumor Response (eg, Pseudop rogression, Flare Reaction )Treatment
(All Arms )
Early antitumor response (eg, pseudo progression , flare reaction) is defined as a sudden and 
tender increase in the size of the disease bearing sit es, including the lymph nodes, spleen and/or 
the liver often acco mpanied by [CONTACT_6398] -grade fever, diffuse rash and in so me cases increase in the 
peripheral  blood lymphocy te counts.  Its treatment is up to the discretion o f the invest igator 
depending upon the severit y and clinical situat ion. It i s suggested that Grades 1 and 2 events be 
treated with nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory  drugs (NSAIDs) (i e, ibuprofen 400 to 600 mg orally  
every 4 to 6 hours as needed) , corti costeroi ds, and/or narcotic analgesics for pain management . 
In mild to m oderate (Grades 1 and 2) cases, it is suggested that IPbe continued alo ng with 
symptom atic treatment as above.

further instructions and dose modificat ions for Grades [ADDRESS_548586] igator’s discretio n.
8.1.7. Tumor Lysis Syndrome Prophylaxis or Treatment (AllArms )
It is recommended that subjects receive tumor lysis syndro me (TLS) prophylaxis or treatm ent 
(allopurino l or equivalent as per inst itutional guidelines) and be well hydrated (orally) during the 
first week of treatment administration in the first cycle, or as clinically indicated.  Hydration 
levels should be adjusted according to age and clinical status.  To moni tor for TLS, the subjects 
will have close monitoring of blood chemistry  during the first few cycles and addit ionally as 
clinically indicated.  
Tumor lysis syndro me will be assessed by [CONTACT_137785] -Bishop Grading system (Appendix D ) (not 
by [CONTACT_4652]) and the assessment includes both laboratory  tumor lysis syndrom e (LTLS) 
criteria and clinical TLS criteria.  If a subject develops L TLS (defined by [CONTACT_46917] 2 or 
more serum  value abnormalit ies of uri c acid, potassium, phosphorous, or calcium) or ≥ Grade 1 
TLS (defined by [CONTACT_432902]: 
creatinine ≥ 1.5 ×ULN, arrhythmia, or seizures), appropriate medical management should be 
initiated according to the local standard of care in each ins titution, al ong wi th vigorous IV 
hydrat ion.  
Rasburicase for treatm ent of TLS is considered appropriate if it is approved by  [CONTACT_941] l ocal Heal th 
Authori ty.
8.1.8. Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (Rituximab )
John Cunningham (JC) virus infection result ing in progressive mult ifocal leukoencephalopathy  
(PML), which can be fatal, has been observed in subjects treated with rituximab. Subjects with 
new onset or changes to preexist ing neurologic manifestations should be evaluated for PML. The 
symptoms of PML are unspecific and can vary  depending on the affected region of the brain. 
Motor symptoms with corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_380619] (eg, muscular weakness, paralysis, and sensory  
disturbances), sensory  abnormalit ies, cerebellar symptoms, and visual field defects are c ommon. 
Some signs/symptoms regarded as “cortical” (eg, aphasia or visual -spatial disori entati on) may  
occur. Evaluat ion of PML includes, but is not limited to, consultation with a neurologist, brain 
MRI, and lumbar puncture (cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_432813]). Study  treatm ent 
shoul d be discont inued in subjects who develop PML. The subject should be referred to a 
neuro logist for the evaluat ion and treatment of PML.
8.2. Prohibited Concomitant Medications and Procedures
Subjects m ust be instructed not to take any  medicati ons, including over- the-counter products, 
without fi rst consul ting wi th the investi gator.

The primary  object ive of the dose finding part is to assess the safet y and tol erabili ty of 
durvalumab when given in co mbinat ion with lenalidomide ±rituximab ;ibrutinib ;or 
bendamustine ±rituximab to determine the RP2D of each combinat ion in subjects with 
lympho ma or CLL.
The primary  object ive of the dose confirmat ion part is to assess the safet yand expl ore the 
preliminary efficacy  of durvalumab as mo notherapy and w hen given in co mbinat ion wi th 
lenalido mide ±rituximab ;ibrut inib;or bendamustine ±rituximab at the RP2D in subjects with 
lympho ma or CLL.
The primary  object ive of the dose expansio n part is to further evaluate the preliminary  efficacy 
of durvalumab when given in co mbinat ion with lenalido mide ±rituximab ;ibrutinib ;or
bendamustine ±rituximab in subjects with lymphoma or CLL.
Arm A (durvalumab plus lenalidomide with or without rituximab) is discontinued to the 
enro llment of new subjects. Subjects already enrolled and treated in Arm A who are 
receiving clinical benefit, based on the discretion of the investigator, may continue study 
treatment after being reconsented.

9.3.2. Dose Confirmation Part (Phase 1)
In the dose confirmat ion part ,the planned sample size is based on clinical empi[INVESTIGATOR_432815] f or Phase 1/2 studies .
For the dose confirmat ion, expected rate of overall response (CR/PR ) was used in order to 
determine the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_432816] 10 subjects a probabilit y of less than 20% of 
observing a certain number of responses or fewer on the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877] s (eg,for Arm C, histol ogy 
R/RCLL/SLL , given expected ORR is 65%, the probabilit y of observing 4 or l ess responses out 
of 10 subjects is equal to ~9.5%, and probabilit y of observing 5 or less responses out of 10 
subjects is equal to ~24.9%).
Shoul d the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877] s described in Table 34for the dose confirmat ion part be fulfilled, the 
SRC for that cohort and GSSC will be consulted to determine whether the clinical t rial shoul d 
completely stop further enrollment of subjects with a particular histology  (ie, not advance to the 
dose expansio n part), temporarily halt enro llment and await maturation of efficacy data to 
examine for example durabilit y of responses, or enroll additional subjects ei ther in the dose 
confirmat ion part or by  [CONTACT_432905] n part.   If there is no expected
activit y and/or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_432817] a certain dose level, other potential dose 
levels /schedules can be explored in the dose finding and confirmation parts based on the SRC
and/or GSSC recommendat ion.  The Sponsor may decide not to expand in any arm based on 
emerging internal or external data in relevant disease andtherapeut ic field or other reasons in

9.6. Efficacy Analysis
In the dose confirmat ion part (dose expansio n part was not opened as originally planned) , 
treatm ent efficacy will be evaluated by  [CONTACT_432906]. For 
each subject in Arms A (indo lent NHL : FL or MZL ),C, D , treatment eff icacy  will be evaluated 
from his/her last durval umab dose until 24 months; in Arms A (aggressive NHL) and B, 
treatm ent efficacy will be evaluated fro m his/her l ast durvalumab dose until [ADDRESS_548596] histol ogycohort by  
[CONTACT_432907] n part was not opened .
For lympho ma subjects, response evaluat ion will be based on IWG Response Criteria for 
Malignant Lympho ma(the Lugano Cl assificati on)
(Cheson 2014). The overall response rate 
(ORR) is de fined as the percent of subjects with best response of CR or PR.  Duration of 
response (DoR) is defined for responders only  as the time from  the fi rst response (CR or PR) to 
disease progressi on or death.
For CLL subjects, response evaluat ion will be based on IWCLL guidelines for diagnosis and 
treatm ent of CLL ( Hallek, 2008 ), as m odified by  (Hallek, 2012 ) and ( Hallek, 2013 ). The overall 
response rate (ORR) is defined as the percent of subjects with best response of CR , com plete 
response with inco mplete marrow recovery  (CRi), nodul ar parti al response (nPR), PR, or partial 
response with lymphocy tosis (PRL) . Duration of response (DoR) is defined for responders only 
as the time from the first response (CR, CRi, nPR, PR, or PRL) to disease progression or death.
The response rate based on the best response during durvalumab treatment as well as during the 
entire efficacy evaluat ion peri od will be summarized by  [CONTACT_432908] .
For subjects with response but no progression, or death , durati on of  response will be censored at 
the last date that the subject was known to be progressio n free. Duration of response will be 
analyzed using the Kaplan- Meie r method. Medi an DoR along with two -sided confidence interval 
will be provided for each treatment arm and subject histol ogycohort.
Progression -free survival (PFS) is calculated as the time fro m first IP dose to the first 
docum ented progressi on or death du e to any  cause during the ent ire efficacy  evaluat ion peri od. 
For subjects with no progression or death, PFS will be censored at the last date that the subject 
was known to be progression free. Median PFS including 2

A qualified investigator will evaluate all AEs as to: 
10.2.1. Seriousness 
An SAE is any AE occurring at any  dose that:
results in death;
is life-threatening (i e, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the investigator, the subject is at immediate 
risk of death fro m the AE);
requi res inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_81644] 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_208838] n, regardl ess of l ength of stay );
resul ts in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapaci ty (a substant ial disrupt ion of the 
subject’s abilit y to conduct normal life functions);
is a congeni tal anomaly/birt h defect; or
constitutes an important medical event.
Important m edical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately  life-
threatening or result in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094], or disabilit y, but may  jeopardi ze the subject or 
requi re medica l or surgi cal intervent ion to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be 
considered serious.
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_208839]:
a standard procedure for protocol therapy administration.  However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_208840] a com plicat ion of therapy  administrati on will be 
reported as an SAE. 
routi ne treatm ent or m onitoring of the studied indication not associate d with any 
deteri oration in condit ion.
the administration o f blood or pl atelet transfusio n as routine treatment of studied 
indicat ion.  However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_414444] a complication 
of such transfusion remains a rep ortabl e SAE.
aprocedure for protocol/disease -related invest igations (eg, surgery , scans, endoscopy , 
sampling for laboratory  tests, bone m arrow sam pling).  However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_208840] a com plicat ion of such procedures remains a reportabl e 
SAE.
hospi [INVESTIGATOR_372085] , practical , or s ocial 
reasons, in absence of an AE.
a procedure that is planned (ie, planned prior to start of treatment on study); must be

2004; Appendix D) and laboratory  abnorm alities as recommended by  [CONTACT_432911] (Hallek, 2008 ; Appendix E ); 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applicat ions/ctc.htm#ctc_40
Adverse events that are not defined in the NCI CTCAE should be evaluated for severit y/intensity 
according to th e following scale:
Grade 1 = Mild –transi ent or mild disco mfort; no limitat ion in act ivity; no m edical  
intervent ion/therapy  requi red
Grade 2 = Moderate –mild to moderate limitat ion in activity, som e assistance may  be 
needed; no or minimal medical interve ntion/therapy  required
Grade 3 = Severe –marked limitat ion in act ivity, som e assistance usually required; 
medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n is possible
Grade 4 =Life-threatening – extreme limitation in activit y, significant assistanc e 
requi red; significant medical intervent ion/therapy  requi red, hospi [INVESTIGATOR_372087]
Grade 5 =Death -the event results in death]
The term  “severe” is often used to describe the intensit y of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or sev ere my ocardi al infarct ion); the event itself, however, may be of relat ively minor medical 
significance (such as severe headache).  This criterio n is notthe same as “serious” which is 
based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associ ated wi th events that pose a threat to a 
subject’s life or funct ioning.  
Seriousness, not severit y, serves as a gui de for defining regul atory  obligat ions.

occurrenc e of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below:
Not suspected: Acausal  relati onship of the adverse event to IP administration is 
unlikely or remote , or other m edicat ions, therapeutic 
intervent ions, or underlying condit ions provi de a sufficient 
explanat ion for the observed event.
Suspected: There is a reasonable possibility that the administration of 
IP(s)caused the adverse event.  ‘Reasonable possibilit y’ means 
there is evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship between the 
IP(s)andthe adverse event.
Causalit y shoul d be assessed and provided for every  AE/SAE based on currently available 
inform ation.  Causalit y is to be reassessed and provided as addit ional inform ation beco mes 
available.
If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a com parator, ancillary or addit ional IP 
that has not been manufactured or provided by [CONTACT_27718], please provide the name [CONTACT_208924].
10.2.4. Duration
For both AEs and SAEs, the investigator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the 
event.
10.2.5. Action Taken
The invest igator will report the action taken with IP as a result of an AE or SAE, as applicable 
(eg, discont inuat ion, interruption, or dose reduction of IP, as appropriate) and report if 
concomitant and/or addit ional treatments were given for the event. 
10.2.6. Outcome
The invest igator will report the outcome of the event for both AEs and SAEs.
All SAEs that h ave not resolved upon discont inuatio n of the subject’s participat ion in the study  
must be fo llowed until recovered (returned to baseline), recovered with sequelae, or death (due to

process and/or organ toxicit y, or is an exacerbat ion or worsening of an exist ing 
condi tion.
Regardless of severit y grade, only  laboratory  abnorm alities that fulfill a seriousness criterion 
need to be document ed as a serious adverse event.
If a laboratory  abnorm ality is one com ponent of a di agnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/screen of the CRF.  If the abnormalit y was not a 
part of a diagnosis or syndro me, then the laboratory abnormalit y should be recorded as the AE. If 
possible, the laboratory  abnorm ality should be recorded as a medical term and not simply as an 
abnorm al laboratory  resul t (eg, record thrombocy topeni a rather than decreased platelets).
10.4. Pregnancy
All pregnancies or suspected p regnancies occurring in eit her a female subject of childbearing 
potenti al or partner of childbearing potential of a male subject are immediately reportable events .  
The exposure of any  pregnant female (eg, caregiver, pharmacist, study  coordinator or m onitor) to 
lenalido mide is also an immediately reportable event.
10.4.1. Females of Childbearing Potential
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including elevated βhCG or posi tive pregnancy  test in a 
female subject of childbearing potential regardless of disease sta te) occurring while the subject is 
on IP , or wi thin90 days after the last dose of durvalumab , ibrutinib, or bendamust ine;[ADDRESS_548603] dose of rituximab ; or28 days after last dose of lenalido mide, whi chever occurs 
later, are considered immediately reportable events. 
Invest igational product is to be discont inued immediately and the subject instructed to return 
any unused portion of the IP (ie, lenalido mide or ibrutinib) to the invest igator .  The pregnancy , 
suspected pre gnancy , or posi tive pregnancy test must be reported to Celgene Drug Safet y 
immediately  by [CONTACT_6968] , phone or facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the Pregnancy  
Initial Report Form , or approved equivalent form.   
The female subject should be referred to an obstetrician -gyneco logist, preferably  one 
experienced in reproductive toxicit y for further eval uation and counseling.
The invest igator will fo llow the female subject until co mpletion of the pregnancy , and m ust 
notify Celgene Drug Safet y immediately  about the outcome of the pregnancy  (either norm al or 
abnorm al outcom e) using the Pregnancy  Follow-up Report Form , or approved equivalent form.
If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (eg, spontaneous abortion), the invest igator 
shoul d report the abnorm al outcom e as an AE.  If the abnormal outcome meets any  of the seri ous 
criteria, i t must be reported as an SAE to Celgene Drug Safet y by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate

If a female partne r of a male subject taking IP becomes pregnant, the male subject taking IP 
shoul d notify the invest igator, and the pregnant female partner should be advised to call their 
healt hcare provider immediately .  
10.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Any AE that me ets any cri terion for an SAE requi res the com pletion of an SAE Report Form in 
addition to being recorded on the AE page/screen of the CRF.  All SAEs must be reported to 
Celgene Drug Safet y within [ADDRESS_548606] igator ’s knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_432912], 
or other appropriate method (eg, via email), using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent 
form.  This instruction pertains to init ial SAE reports as well as any  follow-up reports.
The invest igator is required to ensure that the data on these f orms is accurate and consistent.   
This requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relat ionship to IP) that occur during the study  
(from the time the subject signs informed consent unt il [ADDRESS_548607] dose of any other study treatment [ie, lenalido mide, ibrut inib, rituximab, 
bendamustine, or local IFRT ], whichever occurs later ) or any  SAE m ade known to the 
investi gator at any time thereafter that are suspected of being related to IP or parti cipat ion in the 
study  (eg, a study -related procedure) .In case of local regulations and/or requirements, a ny SAE 
made known to the invest igator beyond theprotocol -defined safet y follow-up peri od above may  
be reported to Celgene Drug Safet y even if not suspected of being related to IP or participat ion in 
the study  (eg, a study -related procedure) 
Serious adverse events occurring prior to treatment (after signing the ICF) will be captured.
The SAE report should provide a detailed descript ion of the SAE and include a concise summary 
of hospi [INVESTIGATOR_27598].  If a subject died and an autopsy  has been 
perform ed, copi [INVESTIGATOR_348863].  Any fo llow-up data should be detailed in a subsequent 
SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form, and sent to Celgene Drug Safet y.  
Following com pletion of the primary  analysis (data cut off date 06 Mar 2019), AEs and SAEs are 
no longer requi red to be collected in the CRFs. 
For subjects still receiving ibrutinib on -study , investi gators will  cont inue to record all AEs/ SAEs 
in the subject’s source documents and report SAEs to Celgene Drug Safet y, as well as those 
SAEs m ade known to the invest igator at any  time thereafter ,that are suspected of being related 
to study  treatm ent.    
Where required by  [CONTACT_81689], the invest igator is responsible for informing the Inst itutional 
Review Boa rd/Ethi cs Co mmittee (IRB/EC) of the SAE and providing them wit h all relevant 
initial and fo llow-up informati on about the event.   The invest igator must keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_208843] h Celgene and the IRB/EC.

10.6. Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events
For the purpose of regulatory  reporting, Cel gene Drug Safet y will determine the expectedness of 
events suspected of being related to durvalumab orlenalidomide based on the Investigator ’s
Brochure.
In the US, all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be reported in an 
expedited manner in accordance wit h 21 CFR 312.32.
For countri es wi thin the European Economic Area (EEA), Celgene or its authorized 
representative will report in an expe dited manner to Regul atory  Authori ties and Ethi cs 
Committees concerned, suspected unexpected S[LOCATION_003]Rs in accordance with Direct ive 
2001/20/EC and the Detailed Guidance on collect ion, verification and presentation of adverse 
reaction reports ari sing fro m clinical tri als on investi gational products for human use 
(ENTR/CT3) and also in accordance with country -specific requirements. 
For the purpose of regulatory  reporting in the EEA, Celgene Drug Safet y will determine the 
expectedness of events suspected of bein g related to the other IP s(ie, rituximab, bendamust ine, 
or ibrutinib) based on the EU Summary  of Product Characteri stics (Sm PC).Any SAE that is 
suspected of being be related to local IFRT alone will not be assessed for expectedness or
reported inan exp edited manner.
Celgene or i ts authori zed representative shall notify  the investigator of the fo llowing inform ation
(in Japan, Celgene KK shall notify the Heads of the Inst itutes in addit ion to the investigators):
Any AE suspected of being related to the use of IP (s)in this study or in other studies 
that is both serious and unexpected (ie, S[LOCATION_003]R);
Any finding fro m tests i n laboratory  animals that suggests a significant risk for 
human subjects including reports of mutagenicit y, teratogeni city, or carcinogen icity;
In Japan, measures taken in foreign countries to ensure subject safet y, study  reports 
that indicate potential risk of cancer, etc, or annual SAE report according to the local 
regul ations.
Where required by  [CONTACT_81689], the invest igator shall notify his/her IRB/EC promptly o f 
these new serious and unexpected AE(s) or significant risks to subjects.
The invest igator must keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_81646] y information on file including

monitoring and/or interventions such as steroids, immunosuppressants and/or hormone 
replacement therapy .  These AESIs are being closely  monitored in clinical  studi es wi th 
durvalumab monotherapy  and combinat ion therapy. An immune -mediated adverse event (i mAE) 
is defined as an adverse event that is associated with drug exposure and is consistent with an 
immune -mediated mechanism o f action and where there is no clear alternate etio logy. Serol ogic, 
immuno logic, and histologic (biopsy) data, as appropriate, should be used to support an imAE 
diagnosis.  Appropri ate efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, 
toxin, or other etio logic causes of the i mAE.
If the i nvest igator has any quest ions in regards to an adverse event (AE) being an i mAE, the 
investigator should prompt ly contact [CONTACT_456]’s medical monitor.
Further informat ion on these AESI (eg, present ing symptoms) can be found in the current 
versio n of the Durvalumab Invest igator ’sBrochure . 
10.7.1. Second Primary Malignancies (SPMs)
Second primary malignancies will be monitored as events of interest and must be reported as 
serious adverse events regardless of the treatment arm the subject is in and must be conside red as 
“Important Medical Events” if no other serious criteria apply.  This includes any second primary 
malignancy, regardless of causal relat ionship to IP (study  drugs), occurring at any  time for the 
durati on of  the study , from the time of signing the ICF for at least until: 
[ADDRESS_548610] dose of durvalumab;
[ADDRESS_548611] dose of other IPs; or
Up to [ADDRESS_548612] subjects’ first lenalido mide dose in the study, whichever is the 
later date for an individual subject,
as well as those SPMs made known to the invest igator at any  time thereafter that are suspected 
of being related to any  IP.  
These events must also be documented in the appropriate page(s) of the CRF (ie, AE and SPM 
CRF) and subject’s source documents.  D ocum entati on on the diagnosis of the second primary 
malignancy must be provided at the time of reporting as a serious adverse event (eg, any 
confirmatory  histol ogy or cy tology resul ts, x-rays, CT scans, etc). 
Following com pletion of the primary  analysis (data cutoff date 06 Mar 2019), SPMs will no 
longer be co llected in the CRFs. For all subjects, investigators will continue to record SPM sin 
the subject’s source documents and report SPM events to Cel gene Drug Safet y.

consider a score of 3 as inadequate response s(to avoid undertreatment). 
Measured dominant lesions: Up to six of the largest dominant nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal lesions 
selected to be clearly measurable in two diameters. Nodes should preferably be from disparate regions of the 
body  and should include, where applicable, mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas. Non -nodal lesions include 
those in solid organs (eg, liver, spleen, kidneys, and lungs ), GI involvement, cutaneous lesions, or those 
noted on palpation. Nonmeasured lesions: An y disease not selected as measured, dominant disease and truly 
assessable disease should be considered not measured. These sites include any nodes, nodal masses, and 
extranodal sites not selected as dominant or measurable or that do not meet the requiremen ts for 
measurability but are still considered abnormal, as well as truly assessable disease, which is any site of 
suspected disease that would be difficult to follow q
uantitatively with measurement, including pleural 
effusions, ascites, bone lesions, lepto meningeal disease, abdominal masses, and other le sions that cannot be 
confirmed and followed by [CONTACT_9661]. In Waldeyer’s ring or in extranodal sites (eg, GI tract, liver, bone 
marrow), FDG uptake may be greater than in the mediastinum with 
complete metabolic response, but should 
be no higher than surrounding norma l physiologic uptake (eg, with marrow activation as a result of 
chemotherapy or myeloid growth factors).

level of decrease from pretreatment will be recorded as Grade 5.
bPlatelet counts must be below normal levels for Grades 1 -4.  If, at any level of decrease the platelet count 
is<20,000/mm3, this will be considered Grade 4 toxicity, unless a severe o r life -thre atening decrease in the initial 
platelet count (eg, 20,000/ mm3) was present pretreatment, in which case the subject is not evaluable for toxicity 
referable to platelet counts.
cHemoglobin (Hgb) levels must be below normal levels for Grades [ADDRESS_548657] be performed before any given transfusions.  The use of er ythropoietin is irrelevant for the 
grading of toxicity, but should be documented.
dIf the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) reaches less than 1000/ mm3, it should be judged to be Grade 3 toxicity.  
Other decreases in white blood cell count, or in circulating granulocytes, are not to be considered, since a decrease 
in white blood cell count is a desired therapeutic end point.  A gradual decrease in granulocytes is not a reliable 
index in chronic lymphocytic leukemia for stepwise grading of toxicity.  The use of granulocyte -
colony-stimulating factor (G -CSF) is irrelevant for the grading toxicity, but should be documented.

(Adopted and Modified from the IWCLL Guidelines for CLL Section 4)
Active disease should be cl early docum ented for protocol therapy . At least one of the following 
criteria shoul d be met:
1.Evidence of progressive marrow failure as manifested by  [CONTACT_66867], or 
worsening of, anemia and/or thrombocy topeni a; 
2.Massive (i e, at l east 6 cm  below the l eft cos tal margin) or progressive or symptomatic 
splenomegaly;
3.Massive nodes (ie, at least [ADDRESS_548658] di ameter) or progressive or symptomatic 
lymphadenopathy;
4.Progressive lymphocy tosis with an increase of more than 50% over a 2 -month peri od or
lymphocy te doubling t ime (LDT) of less than 6 months. LDT can be obtained by [CONTACT_432924] 2 weeks 
over an observat ion peri od of  2 to 3 m onths.  In pati ents wi th initial blood lympho cyte 
counts of less than 30 × 109/L (30 000/μL), LDT should not be used as a single parameter 
to define a treatment indicat ion.  In addit ion, factors contributing to lymphocy tosis or 
lymphadenopathy  other than CLL (eg, infect ions) shoul d be excluded.
5.Autoi mmune anemia and/or thrombocy topeni a that is poorly  responsive to corti costeroi ds 
or other standard therapy  (see the IWCLL Guidelines for CLL section 10.2)
6.Const itutional symptom s, defined as any one or more of the fo llowing disease -related 
symptoms or sig ns:
a.Unintent ional weight l oss of 10% or m ore wi thin the previous 6 months;
b.Significant fatigue (ie, ECOG PS 2 or worse; inabilit y to work or perform  usual  
activit ies);
c.Fevers higher than 100.5°F or 38.0°C for 2 or more weeks without other evidence of 
infec tion; or 
d.night sweats for more than [ADDRESS_548659] ion.
Hypogammaglo bulinemia or monoclonal or oligoclo nal paraproteinemia does not by  [CONTACT_432925] a basis for init iating therapy.  However, it is recommended to assess the change of
these protein abnormalit ies if pat ients are treated.  Patients with CLL may present with a 
markedly  elevated l eukocy te count; however, the symptoms associated with leukocy te 
aggregates that develop in pat ients with acute l eukemia rarely occur in pat ients with CLL. 
Therefore, the abso lute lymphocy te count shoul d not be used as the sole indicator for treatment.
7.Patients who have resistant disease, a short time to progression after the first treatment, 
and/or leukemia cells wit h del(17p) often do not respond to standard chemotherapy  and 
have a relat ively short survival. Therefore, such patients should be offered investigative 
clinical protocols, including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

RATING SUGGESTIONS (GENERAL PRINCIPLES)
Every  single disease must be classified in the appropriate sy stem . If there are several problems in 
the sam e system , only  the m ost severe is rated. Example: For a pati ent suffering from  a well -
controlled angina (Rated 2) and terminal heart failure (Rated 4 ), only the higher rated condit ion 
woul d be scored in the Cardiac system ( eg,rating is 4).
The spread of a cancer may lead to rat ingthe condit ion in more than one category . For exam ple, 
a lung cancer wi th bone m etastases treated with nonsteroidal ant i-inflammatory  drugs (NSAID) 
is Rated 4 in Respi[INVESTIGATOR_432829] 2 in Musculo skeletal .
General rules for severit y rating:
[ADDRESS_548660] significant problem.
2 -Moderate disabilit y or morbidi ty and/or requi res fi rst line therapy .
3 -Severe problem and/or constant and significant disabilit y and/or hard to control chronic 
probl ems (com plex therapeut ic regimen).
4 -Extrem ely severe probl em and/or immediate treatment req uired and/or organ failure 
and/or severe funct ional impairment.
LEVEL 0
No problem or healed minor injuries; past childhood illnesses (chickenpox); minor surgery  
(carpal  tunnel co mpletely healed, caesarean); uncomplicated healed fractures; other past 
probl ems healed without sequel, residual or complication (pneumo nia).
LEVEL [ADDRESS_548661] on morbidit y (asthma controlled with PRN [“as 
needed”] bronchodilators, occasional heartburn relieved wit h PRN ant iacids). Medical problems 
that are not currently active but were significant problems in the past (passage of a kidney stone) 
or requi red m ajor surgery  (hysterectomy , chol ecystectomy, appendectomy ).

RATING MALIGNANCIES
Consistent scoring of severit y ratings for vari ous malignancies is a difficult problem. Each 
malignancy has it s own rating system and prognostic indicators, the complexit y of which would 
quickly exceed the aim of the intended simplicit y and ease of use of CIRS.
The fo llowing general guidelines are intended to provide a reasonably accurate delineat ion of 
medical burden for cancer without excessive co mplexity.
Level 1: Cancer diagnosed in the remote past without evidence of recurrence or sequel in the past 
[ADDRESS_548664] without major sequel (other than melano ma).
Level 2: No evidence of recurrence or sequel in the past 5 y ears.
Level 3: Required chemotherapy , radi ation, horm onal therapy  or surgi cal procedure for cancer in 
the past 5 y ears.
Level 4: Recurrent malignancy or metastasis (other than to lymph glands) or palliat ive treatment 
stage.
These ratings are to be made in the appropriate organ category  for a given m alignancy .
ORGAN- SPECIFIC CATEGORIES
The fo llowing organ specific categories will attempt to provide guidelines for consistent rating of 
comparable severit y. Comm on condi tions will be stressed with the focus on the “judgment 
strategy ” that can be applied to other problems not listed. 
If ther e are several condi tions in the same system, only the most severe is rated.
HEART
In thi s category  only heart and coronary  disease shave to be considered (not vascular): coronary  
arteri es disease, heart failure, valvular heart diseases, heart disease secondary  to hy pertensi on, 
endocardit ies, miocardit ies, pericardit ies, arrhy thmias (extrasy stoles, bundle -branch blocks, atrial

Confident ial and Propri etary 3 MEDI4736 -NHL -001 Amendment # 2 Final: 14 Dec [ZIP_CODE]. JUSTIFICATION FOR AM ENDMENT
Protocol  Amendment 2 is written to update the Toxicit y Management Gui delines (TMGs) and to 
reflect that on 05 Sep 2017 the [LOCATION_002] (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) placed a 
Partial Clinical Hol d on this study. The decisio n by [CONTACT_432848] i-PD-1 antibody , pembro lizumab, in patients with multiple myeloma in 
combinat ion with immuno modulatory  agents.
Significant changes included in this amendment are summarized below:
Discontinuation of Arm A to the enrollment of new subjects
Arm A (durvalumab plus lenalidomide wit h or wi thout ri tuximab) is discont inued to the 
enrollment of new subjects . Onlythosesubjects already  enrolled and treated who are receiving 
clinical benefit, based on the discret ionofthe investigator, can remain on treatment after being
inform ed and reconsent edon the safet y concerns wi th the combinat ion of a programmed cell 
death -1(PD-1)pathway inhibitor and a nimmunomodulatory agent .In addit ion, the add -on 
combinat ion treatment with lenalido mide ± rituximab is no longer allowed. Other treatment arms 
in this study  will cont inue unchanged. 
Changes to the protocol have been made in the Protocol  Summary  and Secti ons 2through [ADDRESS_548679] di scontinuat ion of enro llment to Arm  A.
Updates to the Toxicity Management Guidelines (TMGs)
Update have been made to the general dose modification and TMGs (Tables 30, 31, and 32).
Other changes:
Addit ion of approved durvalumab indicat ion for the treatment of locally advanced or 
metastati c urothelial carcino ma (Section 1.2.1)
Addit ion of ri tuximab intravenous biosimilars and rituximab subcutaneous usage for 
dose administration as they  are becoming standard of care in some study  sites
(Secti on 7.1.3)
Inclusio n of risk of hepatit is B virus react ivation for ibrutinib as per ibrut inib 
summary of product characterist ics (Secti on 8.3.1)

Confident ial and Propri etary 3 MEDI4736 -NHL -001 Amendment #1 Final : 04 May [ZIP_CODE]. JUSTIFICATION FOR AMENDMENT
Significant changes included in this amendment are summarized below:
Addition of 2new dose level s(ie, dose level s -2 and -3) totheArm A dose finding 
part
Initially, 4 potent ial dose l evels were planned in Arm  A.  The doubl et combinat ion of 
durvalumab and lenalido mide 20 mg (dose l evel 1) wasstudi ed and deemed tol erable by  [CONTACT_432936] y Review Co mmit tee (SRC) as 0 of 3 subjects dosed was reported with a dose 
limit ing toxicit y (DLT) during Cycle 1.   Thus , thetriplet combinat ion of durvalumab 1500 mg 
every 4 weeks (Q4W) and l enalido mide 20 mg plus rituximab (375 mg/m2weekly × 4in Cycle 1
and then Day 1 of Cycles 2 through 5)(dose level 2) followed.  Thi s dose l evel was deemed not-
tolerated by [CONTACT_432937] [ADDRESS_548680] 1 DLT d uring Cycle 1.  
Consequent ly, the next 3 subjects were assigned to the subsequent lower dose level which is the
same triplet combinat ion with a reduced dose of lenalidomide 10 m g (dose l evel -1B).  This dose 
level is current ly being evaluated for DLTs.   
In case dose l evel 
-1B is found to be not-tolerated by [CONTACT_12217], new dose level s(ie, dose level s -2 
and -3) areplanned wit hthetriplet regimen described in this protocol amendment.  In dose 
level s -2 and -
3, the combinat ionsof durvalumab 1500 mg Q4W , lenalido mide 15 or 10 mg with
rituximab at a less dose-intense schedule ( ie, 375 mg/m2 Q4W in Cycles 1 through 8)will be 
studi ed for tol erabilit y.  
For th ese new 2 dose level s, up to 12 additional D LT evaluable subjects may need to be treated 
to confirm a preliminary recommended Phase 2 dose ( RP2D )
.  
(Protocol S ummary , Sect ions 3.1, 3.2.2, 4.1, 7 .2.1.1, and 9 .3.1.1 , Figures 2and 4 , Table s 7 and
20)
Change to the allowed time window sfor pretreatment archival lymph 
node/tumor biopsy and on treatment Cycle [ADDRESS_548681] likely  to benefi t from these agents.  
Experi ence with the use of durvalumab in pat ients with solid tumors showed that higher response
rates were observed in subjects with programmed cell death ligand -1 (PD-L1)-positivetumors, 
compared wi thsubjects wi th PD-L1negat ive tumors in their pretreatment biopsy samples (Segal , 
2014).  Thus, further evaluat ion of these bio markers and a broad exploration of addit ional 
biomarkers related to immuno logical and disease fac tors are needed to ident ifypredict ive 
biomarkers for durvalumab therapy in lympho id malignancies .
As tumors may change their bio logic profile over time and potentially  in response to intervening 
treatm ents, an archival lymph node/tumor biopsy  sample collected 18 months before study  
treatm ent start (as init ially allowed) might not accurately  reflect current m olecular characteri stic 
of tumor. To allow for an accurate assessment of tumor characterist ics at baseline, a n archival 
lymph node/tumor formalin fixed ,paraffin embedded (FFPE) sample acqui red by a surgi cal or 
core needl e biopsy  within [ADDRESS_548682] with a poorly accessible 
tumorfor biopsy following discussio n with the sponsor’s medical mo nitor.

Confident ial and Propri etary 4 MEDI4736 -NHL -001 Amendment #1 Final : 04 May 2017Initially an on -treatm ent bi opsy  sample collecti on (strongly  recommended) was planned at 
Cycle 2 Day 15 (± 3days).  The collect ion of this biopsy sample will be allowed at any time 
during Cycle [ADDRESS_548683] made it possible to run the planned 
analyses on FFPE samples alone, a fresh frozen biopsy  sample will  not be necessary  to submi t 
for biomarker stu dies. 
(Secti ons3.2.1 , 4.2, 6.1, and 6.2 )
Removal of Aiolos/Ikaros analysis (Arm A)
Aiolos and Ikaros are the downstream substrates of Cereblo n which is the mo lecular target of 
lenalido mide and other immuno modulatory (IMiDs®)compounds .  The analyses in other 
durvalumab studies suggest that durvalumab has no effect on degradation of those substrates 
when given in co mbinat ion with an IMi Dcompound . Thus, the planned blood collect ionsand 
analys e
s(ie, pre -and [ADDRESS_548684] dose at Cycle 1 Day 1, and Cycle 2 Day  1 and Day  15) f or 
Aiolos and Ikaros in Arm A were removed.  
(Protocol Summary, Sections 1.3.6, 2, and 6.8.3 and Table 2 )
Change to the secondary efficacy endpoints (Phase 1/2)
Time to first response has been added as an addit ionalsecondary endpo int for further 
characterizat ion of disease response.  The timeframe for secondary overall response rate
endpo int has been changed fro m ‘during the study  treatm ent’ to ‘during the study’ which will be 
inclusive o f any study  treatment rel ated response docum ented during the treatment and follow -up 
periods of  the study  asobjective responses to immune checkpo int inhibitors can take 
considerably longer to become apparent compared with convent ionaltherapi[INVESTIGATOR_432845] n canbereported well after completion of the treatm ent.  
(Secti on 2 and Table 2)
Revision of inclusion criterion #6
Inclusio n criterion #6 which defines subjects with high -risk chronic lymphocy tic leukemia
(CLL)/small  lymphocy tic lymphoma (SLL), will be changed to a llowtheinclusio n of subjects 
who failed therapy  on any  Bruton’s t yrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor (not only  ibrutinib).  As 
clinical trials wit h other BTK inhibitors (eg, acalabruti nib, tirabrutinib ) are currently ongo ing, 
there is an emerging patient populat ion who fail on these newer or experimental BTK inhibitors , 
and who are considered to meet the criteria of high -risk CLL/SLL, too .   
(Secti on 4)
The amendment also includes several other updates, clarifications and corrections :
Addition ofthe inform al study  name “FUSION NHL 001” to the title page. The study  
name [CONTACT_432946] h care professio nals.  (Title Page and Protocol  Summary) 
Addit ion of an exploratory  objective and endpoint for assessment of abscopal effect 
(ie, immune -mediated tum or response outside the radiat ion field) with local IFRT

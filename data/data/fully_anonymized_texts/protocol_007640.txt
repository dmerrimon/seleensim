Aims, purpose, or objectives:  The overarching purpose of this study is to  obtain preliminary evidence 
regarding the efficacy of LLLT treatments for obtaining  fat mass  loss and to produce a reduction in waist 
circumference by [CONTACT_5875] 6  (end of treatment).  
Primary Aim: 
To compare the amount of fat mass loss at the end of week 6 (end of LLLT treatment) for people who are 
overweight and obese who are receiving Wellness Coaching  with lifestyle modifications , with and 
without adjunct LLLT. 
Secondary  Aim:  
To compare the change in waist circumference from baseline, at the end of week 6 (end of LLLT 
treatment) for people who are overweight and obese who are receiving Wellness Coaching and lifestyle modification instruction , with and without adjunct LLLT. 
Background:   Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may 
impair health , leading to reduced life expectancy and/or increased health problems1,  and results from an 
energy imbalance.  In basic terms, obesity  is defined as having more body fat than is considered healthy2, 
which, in turn, is defined as a body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2) of 30.0 or higher3.   Currently in 
the [LOCATION_002], about 38% of the American adult population is considered obese3-7, which translates to 
one in three Americans being obese.

 Background:   Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may 
impair health , leading to reduced life expectancy and/or increased health problems1,  and results from an 
energy imbalance. In basic terms, obesity  is defined as having more body fat than is considered healthy2, 
which, in turn, is defined as a body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2) of 30.0 or higher3.   Currently in 
the [LOCATION_002], about 38% of the American adult population is considered obese3-7, which translates to 
one in three Americans being obese.  
Low level laser therapy ( LLLT) is a new novel non -invasive procedure that removes excess fat without 
the negative side effects associated with surgical methods. LLLT also has the potential to enhance 
motivation for weight management as LLLT treatment can provide immediate feedback  to the patient or 
study participant in the form of lost inches which can be seen by [CONTACT_39359]. LLLT has been associated with a reductions in waist circumference of 6 inches as reported in prior studies, with some noting more extensive reductions of up to 12 inches with 6 treatments.   
Clinically, the LLLT treatments  can vary from 6 to 28 treatments and a frequency of 1- 3 times per week 
depending on the patients’ preference and ability to pay.  Our research team conducted a previous 
feasibility study of 45 overweight/obese subjects looking at the use of 12 LLLT treatments over the course of 12 weeks (one treatment per week) with the end goal of reducing central adiposity.  In this prior study (IRB 14 -002370), subjects were randomized to 
1 of 3 conditions (LLLT, lorcaserin, and LLLT + lorcaserin).  This study demonstrated feasibility by [CONTACT_379066] [ADDRESS_1145561] any adverse events reported during the 6 months of the trial and although the sample size was too small f or 
any significant findings, the LLLT did show a reduction in body circumference (2.3 to 4.0 cm reduction) and a reduction in weight (1 to 3.5 kg reduction).  This 2014 study was followed by [CONTACT_61921] (IRB 16-004817) in which our study team compared di fferent frequencies 
of administering 12 LLLT.  The compared frequencies were 12 treatments administered once per week, twice per week or 3 times per week. This latter study found that 12 treatments delivered twice per week (for up to 6 weeks) was the most optimal
[ADDRESS_1145562] this hypothesis. Figure 1 – Study Flow

 For the purposes of this study, we will define overweight as having a body mass index [BMI] of 25-29.9 
kg/m2 and obesity as a BMI of 30-39.9 kg/m2.  In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_379064] 60 overweight and 
obese individuals to one of two treatment  arms :  
• LLLT + Lifestyle Modifications  and Wellness Coaching  (GROUP 1 ),  
• Sham LLLT + Lifestyle Modifications and Wellness Coaching  (GROUP 2 ).  
 
Study Design and Methods  
Methods:   
Study Design: This will be a randomized clinical trial. We will obtain preliminary data on the efficacy of 
LLLT as an  adjunct to Lifestyle Modification and Wellness Coaching.   We will focus this study on [ADDRESS_1145563] circumference, A1C and CRP at end of LLLT treatment (week 6) and end of Lifestyle 
Modification/Wellness Coaching intervention (week 12).  Participants will be randomized to one of the following groups:   
• LLL
T biweekly for 6 weeks + Lifestyle Modification  and Wellness Coaching ( GROUP 1 ),  
• Sham LLLT biweekly for 6 weeks + Lifestyle Modification  and Wellness Coaching ( GROUP 2 ).  
Study Procedures : We will use standardized procedures to ensure that uniform instructions are provided 
to all participants and that recruitment and screening result in the enrollment of appropriate study participants. All Study Case Report Forms will be administered online using REDCap and will also function as study source documents. Study participant data on this system will be identified using unique subject IDs, not personal identifiers. This data entry system will provide immediate feedback on data integrity issues, in cluding implausible entries, and checks of consistency between variables. 
 Study Process  
Study Visit : 
• Each visit will have a window from midpoint of prior visit to midpoint of latter visit.   
• If a subject cannot reschedule their visit within the study visit window, that visit is categorized as “missed”.   
• A subject is allowed 3 consecutive missed visits before “drop” procedure is commenced.   
 Post Baseline, data collection options  for all self -assessments (i.e. surveys and questionnaires): 
• E-mailed via R EDCap program one week prior to the visit.  Subject will be asked to complete and 
submit back to the site prior to the visit. 
• In person/on paper at the clinic visit, if the email data was not received by [CONTACT_825973].

Study Measures  
 
Safety Measures : 
• Patient Health Questionnaire -2 (PHQ -2):9,[ADDRESS_1145566] 2 items of the PHQ-
9 by [CONTACT_825974].  The scoring ranges from 0 to 6. A cut- off score of 3 as the 
optimal cut point for screening purposes
 and a determination will be made if the participant should 
be referred for mental health services (see DOM CRO Standard Crisis Policy in the DSMB section of the IRBe application).  
• Pregnancy tests :  A self -report of negative pregnancy status will be required at screen for all 
female participants who are of childbearing potential.  In addition, a pregnancy test will be available at the patient ’s request during the study.  
• I
nBody Measurements :  The InBody bioelectrical impedance scale will measure the subject ’s 
weight, height, BMI, body composition analysis (total body water, proteins, minerals, and body fat mass), visceral fat area and lean balance ( http://www.e -
inbody.com/global/product/InBody770.aspx ). 
• Safety Phone Visit :  Study team member will contact [CONTACT_825975] 1 week after complet ion 
of their  Erchonia® EMERALD Laser randomized treatment (LLLT or sham LLLT)  (week 7).   
• A dverse Events/Concomitant Medications:  IRB policy will be adhered to for the collection and 
reporting of all Adverse Events and Concomitant medications as well as all adverse events determined to be Reportable Events and Serious Adverse Events as defined by [CONTACT_825976].  These are standard safety collection measures which will be collected at every patient 
contact, by [CONTACT_14676]. ( http://mayocontent.mayo.edu/irb/DOCMAN-
[PHONE_17225]?qt=reportable%20event )  
Outcome Measures : 
• Weight Motivation Assessments (MVA): Likert Scale to assess participants’ motivation to reduce 
their weight (on a scale of [ADDRESS_1145567] motivated and 0 is not motivated at all), follow a healthy diet (0 to 10) and have a physically active lifestyle (0 to 10) will be assessed weekly during the study.   
• Linear Analogue Self -Assessment (LASA ):11-13  A six -item measure of quality of life (QOL), in 
which QOL is conceptualized as a multidimensional construct with five domains (physical, functional, emotional, spi[INVESTIGATOR_37312], and social).  
This data will be collected at screen (prior to any 
treatment), week 4, week 6, week 12 and at end of study ( [ADDRESS_1145568] treatment).

 • Body Areas Satisfaction Scale (BASS) : 14-16 10 questions concerning self -perceived body image 
and the body satisfaction (excerpt from MBSRQ).  The Multidimensional Body- Self Relations 
Questionnaire (MBSRQ) has been used to assess body image satisfaction. Respondents are asked 
how satisfied they are with [ADDRESS_1145569] 
reliability of 0.81 and consistency of 0.88. This data will be collected at screen (prior to any treatment), week 4, week 6, week 12 and at end of study ([ADDRESS_1145570] treatment).   
• B
ody Appreciation Scale (BAS) :17  This is a 13 -item validated questionnaire assessing positive 
body image.  This data will be collected at screen (prior to any treatment), week 4, week 6, week 12 and at end of study ( [ADDRESS_1145571] treatment).

leep  Quality  (ASCQ -Me® v2.[ADDRESS_1145572] - Short Form18): is an effective instrument used to 
measure the impact sleep has on overall health in adults.  The ASCQ- Me Sleep Impact SF is 
equivalent to the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance and Sleep -Related Impairment Surveys except the 
scoring is reversed.[ADDRESS_1145573] 
Scale consists of 5 -item, likert scale, validated, scoring system.19  The 5 questions focus on 
experiences in the prior 7 days. Self -efficacy  (Short Form 4a – 4 items )20:  This PROMIS Self -
efficacy Scale defines self -efficacy as confidence in one’s ability to successfully perform specific 
tasks or behaviors. It assesses confidence in one’s ability to successfully perform specific tasks or behaviors related to one's health in a variety of situations. Each item on the measure is rated on a 5-point scale (1=I am not at all confident; 2=I am a little confident; 3=I am somewhat confident; 
4=I am quite confident; 5=I am very confident).This data will be collected at screen (prior to any treatment), week 4, week 6, week 12 and at end of study ([ADDRESS_1145574] treatment). 
 
• Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) : The PSS is a 10 -item Likert scale that measures global life stress by 
[CONTACT_825977].21 
Scores can range from 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating greater perceived stress. Reliability is reported as 0.85, with Cronbach alphas ranging from 0.75-0.86. 
22 
• A nthropomorphic Measurements : Measurements will be performed on all participants during all 
study clinic visits. BMI and WHR will be derived from measurement of weight, height, and waist and hip circumference. The measurements will be as follows: Height  and Weight  will be measured 
using the InBody standiometer scale. Body Mass Index (BMI)  will be calculated by [CONTACT_825978]. Waist 
circumference (WC)  will be measured while participants are upright. A soft measuring tape will 
be placed in a horizontal plane at the level of  the superior border of the iliac crest. The tape will be 
snug but not compressing the skin and parallel to the floor. The measurement will be made at the end of a normal expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. 
• B
iomarkers : Levels of A1C, CRP, Lipid Panel, Leptin, CRP, IL-6, Adiponectin, fasting insulin 
will be collected at baseline, week 6 (end of treatment) and week 12 (end of study). 
• W as it Worth it Questionnaire (WIWI)23: This a satisfaction survey will be administered to the 
participants at the end of the study, probing their satisfaction with the research study. These data could be used to assess the feasibility of the intervention by [CONTACT_629658].

 Adherence to Intervention: 
• Diary to collect Calorie Intake and Water Intake: My Fitness Pal® will be utilized as an online 
diary log which the parti cipants can use to record calorie and water intake. This program is linked 
to the FitBit® (see below) .  The study staff will educate and assist the participant in setting up a 
study ID, enrollment and use of both online apps for study purposes.  Data from Diary collected 
on weekly basis. 
• S teps : Fitbit® Data from these devices will be collected on weekly basis to download activity 
levels.  A Fitbit® account will be created by [CONTACT_825979].  A weekly report will be sent to their email and this will be logged into the database. 
• T
reatment Tracking : the study staff will log in the days and times each patient attended an LLLT 
intervention session  during the clinical trial and record the self -report on the lifestyle 
modifications  by [CONTACT_2299]. 
Intervention : 
• Lifestyle Modifications :  At Baseline, the study assistants will complete an additional brief (10 -
minute) individual behavioral intervention.  Introduce and review the key tenets of lifestyle modification utilizing the  “My Weight Solution
©” manual  and motivate the patient toward a steps 
goal using Wellness Coaching Approaches.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_825972]: motivational strategies, social support, goal setting strategies, nutritional recommendations and strategies for physical activity. A copy of “ My Weight Solution
©” will be given to the study participant to keep 
and to be used by [CONTACT_825980]. The book chapters include: Introduction [Not just another diet, Getting started, Are you Ready]; Part 1: Lose It! [Add 5 Habits, Break 5 Habits, Adopt 5 Bonus Habits], Part 2: Live It! [Your Live It! Strategies, Strategy 1: Set Realistic Goals, Strategy 2: Follow the pyramid, Strategy 3: Burn calories by [CONTACT_825981]], Bonus section: How to stick with your commitment [Change Behaviors, Change Your Mind, Stay Connected, Overcome Challenges].   
• Wel
lness Coaching : Study Staff, who are trained as Wellness Coaches (SF and SL) will introduce 
the patient to Lifestyle Modification  approaches , and 
review and discuss the different chapters of the book “My Weight Solution
©”, at the baseline visit.  Lifestyle 
modification will consist of caloric reduction of 500 -750 calories from current needs depending on BMI. Additionally, subjects will be advised to target 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity with the type of activity varying by [CONTACT_4676]'s current d egree of mobility. 
This visit will be approximately [ADDRESS_1145575] of the lifestyle modifications  utilizing “ My Weight Solution
©”.  Each of these follow up 
sessions can last anywhere from 10-[ADDRESS_1145576] 6 weeks of study participation  
(during the LLLT/Sham LLLT treatments) the sessions will be individualized and in person.   
• LLLT:  In this trial, subjects randomized to receive LLLT or sham LLLT with Lifestyle 
Modification/Wellness Coaching will undergo 12 treatments – twice per week for 6 weeks.

  Each LLLT device consists of a multiple -head low -level diode laser with 10 independent Class 
2 Line Generating Diode laser heads ( Figure 2 ). This process produces a line 7 mm wide with 
a length of approx. 152 mm at 6 in (15.2 cm) away (rounded up to .0001 joules per cm² / 
second). With the treatment time being 30 minutes, the total fluence of all lasers is 288J and the total treatment area of all lasers is 5161.28cm
².  
 The Erchonia® Emerald emits a 532- nanometer  (nm) wavelength with a tolerance of ±10 nm r, 
from each of the ten specially created and patented electronic diodes. In the active device (Erchonia Emerald Laser , Erchonia Medical, Inc., Melbourne, FL)
24 each diode generates a 1 6 
mW ± 2mW  output. The average number of treatments can vary, depending on the adipose 
make up on the patient.25  
 Erchonia® EMERALD Laser ( which will be used in this study) has been approved by [CONTACT_1622] 
(K192544) on January 13, 2020, as a non -invasive dermatological aesthetic treatment which 
can be used by [CONTACT_379069], waist, and thighs.   
♦ Justification for the assertion of anticipated safety and effectiveness of the Erchonia® 
Emerald 10  Headed Scanner for application to reducing body circumference is found 
through several FDA clearances for Erchonia® Low Level Laser devices for body circumference reduction indications. For all of the 510(k) clearances, the assigned Product Code is OLI, defined as follows:  
 Device:  Fat reducing low level laser  
 Regulation Description:  Low level laser system for aesthetic use (878.5400) 
 Definition : Non -invasive reduction in fat layer for body contouring 
 Technical Method:  Use of low- level laser energy to create pores in adipocyte cells to 
release the lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805].    
 Target Area : Adipocyte cells within the subcutaneous fat layer of the body, this could 
include abdomen (waist), thighs and hips  
 Under 21 CFR 878,5400, the FDA identifies this generic type of device as: “A Low Level Laser System for Aesthetic Use” is a device using low level laser energy for the disruption of adipocyte cells within the fat layer for the release of fat and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_379065] -
invasive aesthetic use.”  
The study team will register the subject in the redcap database and once registered, the randomization program within the redcap patient record will identify the subject as being enrolled in Group 1 (LLLT) or Group 2 ( Sham LLLT).  The study team will then flip a switch on the LLLT machine to A or B depending 
on the group assigned and then follow the procedure administration protocol for the LLLT for each session  (note, the same process is followed regardless of the group assigned to patient – after the switch is 
placed in the correct setting) : 
• The study participant is correctly fitted with the safety glasses  (see manual for specifics of the safety 
glasses) . 
• The participant lies comfortably flat on his or her back on the procedure table such that the front area of the subject’s body is facing upwards.

 • The Erchonia® Emerald [ADDRESS_1145577]’s 
lower and upper abdomen, stomach, centered along the body’s midline (the “line” that vertically 
“dissects” the body into two equal halves).  
• The Erchonia® Emerald [ADDRESS_1145578]’s 
anterior  (frontal) region. Each scanner emits to the subject a laser beam of approximately 16 mW ± 
2mW  with a wavelength of [ADDRESS_1145579] pattern that is totally random and 
independent from the others. These patterns overlap each other to guarantee total coverage within the 
target area of approximately 80 in²/516 cm². 
• The participant then turns over to lie flat on his or her stomach such that the posterior treatment area of the subject’s body encompassing the region spanning from the participant’s back down though the central body region is facing upwards. 
• The Erchonia® Emerald 10 Headed Scanner diodes are positioned at a distance of approximately 6 inches above the posterior treatment area, centered along the body’s midline, the same as for the anterior region.   
• The Erchonia® Emerald [ADDRESS_1145580]’s posterior  (back) region. Each scanner emits to the subject a laser beam of approximately 16 mW 
± 
2mW  with a wavelength of [ADDRESS_1145581] pattern that is totally random and 
independent from the others. These patterns overlap each other to guarantee total coverage within the target area of approximately 80 in²/516 cm². 
• The participant’s safety glasses are removed and the procedure administration session is over. 
The Erchonia experts (Steve Shanks and Travis Sammons ) trained the study staff in -person on the use and 
maintenance of the LLLT on March 18, 2020.  This training session has been documented.  A refresher training zoom session is scheduled to take place two weeks prior to study start up. In addition, t hey will 
be available for on-the-spot questions and for any online retraining, as needed.  The study coordinators will be under the direction of the study lead (SF).  
Tracking Vitals: 
 Fitbit Tracker:  
Participants will be asked to wear their Fitbit
® 24/7 except during a time of recharging.  Fitbit® Data will 
be collected weekly  during intervention by [CONTACT_825982]® app that has been 
downloaded on their personal electronic device.  The data collected will include Heart Rate, steps, water intake, and sleep quality. A Fitbit
® account will be created by [CONTACT_825983].  Information collected from the Fitbit® app will be logged into the database.  This approach for working with the Fitbit has been successfully used in the past by [CONTACT_825984].   
Participant Retention: All participants will also be provided with parking vouchers if they park in a 
Mayo parking lot (Damon or Graham).  Each visit is estimated to be up to [ADDRESS_1145582] of the vouchers can as much as $72 per person based on the number of study visits attended (14 in person visits, 
2 hours each, $3/hour).  This breaks down to a consent/baseline visit, 2 visit per week for 6 weeks during treatment and one final study visit thereafter (N=14).  At the end of the study, participants that complete the study will be allowed to keep the Fitbit®  for their continued use.

Target accrual: We plan to enroll and screen up to 80 people with a BMI of 25-39.9 kg/ m2 in order to 
accrue [ADDRESS_1145584] population:  Participants will be recruited from the local community through internet postings, 
Mayo Clinic physician referrals, and word of mouth.   
Based upon our recruitment data from recent weight loss studies and a wait list of participants who are 
interested in this treatment, we estimate recruiting on average 3-4 study participants per week. Those who meet study criteria will be invited to participate in this study.  In this study, all 60 study participants will receive some form of treatment and be in the study for 3 months.  The following is a listing of interventions each participant will receive and the LLLT/sham LLLT aspect is based on the randomization group assigned:  
1. 12 individual treatments of LLLT  or sham LLLT (twice per week for 30 min each), while also 
utilizing Lifestyle  Modification/Wellness Coaching.

 Data Analysis  
 
Statistical Considerations The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and potential efficacy of using LLLT combined with 
Lifestyle  Modification/Wellness Coaching to reduce fat mass and WC  in people with obesity or 
overweight.  
The purpose is to decide whether additional studies of the experimental regimen are warranted and to 
provide preliminary data for designing a larger trial to confirm efficacy.  Although there has been debate about the value of formal statistical comparison s in phase II trials, we agree with those who propose that 
formal comparisons are appropriate under the caveat that phase II studies are not expected to provide reliable definitive comparisons using a traditional two -sided type I error rate of 0.05.  Nonetheless, for the 
present study, a two -sided test with a false -positive (type I error) rate of 0.05 will be used for the primary 
comparison.  
The primary endpoint of the current study is the change in fat mass  from baseline. For the primary 
analysis, the change in WC  and fat mass  from baseline to week 6 will be compared between  groups.   
Data Analysis Plan:  
Data related to subject recruitment , including the frequency of calls and the reasons for failing screening 
criteria, will be summarized .   
Baseline characteristics and treatment compliance of the enrolled participants will be presented overall 
and also separately for each of the treatment groups. In all cases, data will be summarized using mean ± SD for continuous variables and frequency perc entages for nominal variables. Treatment adherence will 
be quantified for each person by [CONTACT_825985].  The percentage 
of subjects who discontinue study participation and the reasons for discontinuing study participation will be summarized.  Changes in measures of central adiposity and weight from baseline will be summarized at each study visit. The primary outcome of interest is the change in  fat mass from baseline to week 6 . For 
the primary analysis, the change in fat mass from baseline to week 6 will be compared between treatment groups using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with the baseline value included as the covariate. For this analysis, a two -tailed p -value of 0.05 will be considered statistically sign ificant . Similar analyses will 
be performed for all secondary outcomes. In all cases, findings will be summarized by [CONTACT_825986] 95% confidence interval for the difference between treatment groups.  
Sample -size Justification :  
From  our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the mean ± standard deviation ( SD) body fat mass change from baseline to 6 weeks  
was -1.1±1.[ADDRESS_1145589] deviation is 1.6 kg, a sample size of N=30 per group will provide statistical power ( two-
tailed, alpha=0.05) of 75% to detect a difference of 1.1 kg for the comparison of LT vs. sham. Therefore, a total sample size of N=60 (N=30 per group) is proposed.

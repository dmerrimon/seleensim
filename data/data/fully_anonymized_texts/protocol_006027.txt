to understand the relapse rates of the surgical series.  
 
Scientific Background: Tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) is a 
rare, benign, but potentially locally aggressive and recurrent disease. 
It is characterized by [CONTACT_148736][INVESTIGATOR_148721], tendon sheaths and bursae. Evidence shows that it 
mainly affects large joints such as the knee and the hip and is 
extremely rar e in the temporomandibular joint and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] .  There are 
two forms of TGCT, localized and diffuse. When the tumor involves 
the tendons that support the joint, or occurs in just one area of the joint, it is called localized TGCT . This type usually responds we ll to 
surgical treatment. The diffuse type is more widesprea d and involves 
an entire joint. It tends to be more destructive and is more difficult to 
treat.  
 
TGCT is rare, with an estimated annual incidence of 1.[ADDRESS_170952] -TS, in the 
[LOCATION_002] (Myers 1980). TGCT is a challenging disease to 
manage and the aggressiveness of the tumour is often 
underestimated. The current standard of care is surgical resection of the tumor as completely as possible in order to: (1) reduce pain, 
stiffness, and joint destruction caused by [CONTACT_148737]; (2) 
improve function; and (3) minimize the risk of recurrence. Patient 
outcome following surgery depends on multiple factors including the 
location and extent of disease as well as on a thorough diagnostic 
evaluation and quality of surgery.  Currently, there are no systemic 
   DS-ONC -01-15- EU 
 Observational Plan , Version 4.[ADDRESS_170953] ( including functional details 
measured pre and post treatment), to explore the patient pathway in a 
real world setting and collect data on patients’ quality of life. 
Study Design  Multinational, multicentre, prospective, non-interventional 
observational disease registry.  
Setting  • 2 year recruitm ent period 
• 2 year follow up per patient  
• Electronic data capture  
• Number of recommended data collection points:  1 baseline and 
 2 follow up data collections at 12 and 24 months  
Population/Patients  It is the aim to document [ADDRESS_170954] patient regardless of the total number of 
patients enrolled.  
Inclusion/exclusion 
criteria  As this is a non -interventional study, there are no explicit selection 
criteria besides:  
- Written informed consent for participation in the study (IC F) 
- Age ≥ [ADDRESS_170955] (diagnosed histologically) confirmed  
naïve or recurrent case 
Variables  
(Observation Criteria)  Data on the patients ’ TGCT (both current status and history) will be 
collected at an initial baseline data collection point . Patient reported 
outcomes on TGCT symptoms and quality of life will also be assessed 
at this time as well as health resources used in the past 24 months.  
The patient will also attend two further data collections at 12 months 
and 24 months (as this is ro utine clinical practice). Details of the 
patients’  TGCT will be recorded and associated patient reported 
outcomes and health resource utilization will be assessed again. This will also be done at any time the patient attends the site.  
Optionally, t he patie nts may also complete the PRO questionnaires on 
pain, stiffness, physical function, quality of life and health resource 
utilization between the data collection points at [ADDRESS_170956] 
statistics. In addition, adequate graphs (e.g. bar charts, box-whisker 
plots) may be presented. The purpose of all analyses will be purely 
descriptive/exploratory.  
Quality Control This study will be conducted according to the rules Good 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_148722] (GEP)  and STROBE guidelines. Related 
quality control mechanisms (e.g. data plausibility checks, monitoring 
of data) will be performed  accordingly

8. RATIONALE AND BACKGROUND  
8.1. Backg round  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_134364] (PVNS)  and giant cell tumors  of the tendon sheath  (GCT -
TS) are members of  a single  condition referred  to as tenosynovial giant cell  tumor (TGCT),  
localized  and diffuse type, and have a common pathogenesis.[ADDRESS_170960] tends to be more  aggressive,  often  
recurring  locally (8%–56%) after surgery, and  is capable of malignant transformation.2 In a 
retrospective analysis  of 49 previously untreated patients  with  PVNS  of the knee (12 
localized,  37 diffuse),  the overall  relapse rate after surgery was  43%, with  52% of diffuse -type 
relapsing within [ADDRESS_170961] now also compete with 
technologies for other indications, in terms of their benefits and risks for the patients and 
resources needed . A range of access hurdles are already in use by [CONTACT_148738]/budget holders to 
curb physicians’ prescriptions. At their heart is the goal of improving effectiveness and value 
in healthcare as a way of balancing growing costs and increasingly limited resources. 
Constantly higher levels of performance are demanded in terms of improved patient- relevant 
outcomes without additional risks. The need for proven evidence of effectiveness and cost-
effectiveness  has become imperative.  
Current  studies in TGCT focus on its radiological and pathological characteristics and 
surgical outcomes. Little effo rt has been made to address its clinical characteristics and 
natural history.  
Therefore, this prospective registry will be conducted to evaluate the routine clinical care the 
clinical profile , management of the disease, clinical and patient -reported outcomes and 
resource usage in Europe. This registry will be the first comprehensive European disease 
registry to increase transparency on TGCT patients’ pathways, treatment patterns, health 
outcomes and health economics. Data collected th rough this registry could also be used to 
assess the unmet medical need.

 Observational Plan , Version 4.[ADDRESS_170962] for 
patients (including pain, joint stiffness, swelling, reduced mobility and quality of life) or the 
economic impact of TGCT. This study aims to collect data by [CONTACT_148739] i nvestigators treatment 
decisions.  
   DS-ONC -01-15- EU 
 Observational Plan , Version 4.[ADDRESS_170963]. Specifically this registry will 
explore the following: 
• Patient pathway to diagnosis 
• To provide insight into the routine clinical care for patients with TGCT  
• Requirement for surgery  
• Severity of disease on MRI 
• Rate of complications due to surgery 
• Rate of recurrence  
• Patient reported outcomes on pain, stiffness and physical function 
9.2. Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objective is to assess the economic health and quality of life burden for patients 
with diffuse TGCT. Specifically this registry will collect information on the following: 
• Patient Reported Outcomes on Quality of Life  
• Health Resource Utilization   
• Patient daily life activity  
• Collection of ADR for those patients treated with Pexidartinib after [ADDRESS_170964] 
influence payment or reimbursement for any treatment received by [CONTACT_99353]. 
It is the responsibility of the investigator and his study staff to enter all relevant patient data 
required for this registry  in the eCRF and in the patients’ medical records. 
Patients from several European  countries and care settings will be enrolled and followed up for 
2 years. A 2- year patient recruitment period is planned. 
10.2.1. Participating Centres  
Up to 20 sites located in [LOCATION_009], [LOCATION_013], Austria, Italy, t he Netherlands , Spain, the United 
Kingdom and US ) are planned to participate in the study.  The sites will be specialized sites 
that treat TGCT regularly; no referral sites will be used.  
10.2.2. Eligibility Criteria  
As this is a non-interventional study, there are no explicit selection cr iteria besides:  
• Written informed consent for participation in the study ( ICF) 
• Age ≥ 18 years  
• Patients with diffuse TGCT (diagnosed histologically ) confirmed naïve or recurrent case

performed at 12 and 24 months as this is routine clinical practice . Patients will be followed up 
according to normal clinical practice;  therefore  if they attend the site more frequently then this 
data will also be  documented in the clinical notes and enter ed in the eCRF. Patients will be 
given questionnaires to optionally complete at the [ADDRESS_170966] 2020

10.4.4.  Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting  
In case a patient experiences an adverse drug reaction that th e investigator judges to be related 
to pexidartinib, this needs to be documented independent from the data collection point, in the 
respective eCRF section. ADRs will be collected starting from August 02, 2019, which is the 
date pexidartinib became  available on the US market . ADRs occurred prior this date, were 
collected within the follow -up phase of the ENLIVEN study in which all study patients who 
were treated with pexidartinib, were participating.  
The ADR documentation and processing follows the Guideline on Good Pharmacovigilance 
Practices (GVP) Module VI ( Collection, m anagement and submission of reports of suspected  
adverse reactions to medicinal products) 
10.5. Sample Size Calculation  
As this is a rare disease the recruitment of patients within the  scheduled 2- years treatment 
period will be difficult. Therefore, no formal sample size consideration has been performed. 
All collected variables will be used in the statistical analysis.  
10.6. Data Management  
Data will be collected on standardised electronic C RFs (eCRF , Clincase ) in English. During 
data entry  performed at the investigational sites  automated plausibility checks (e.g., range 
checks, conditional checks, etc.) will be performed. Additional manual queries resulting from 
medical/manual data review may be raised by [CONTACT_29018].  
All patient reported outcome  questionnaires will be completed on paper forms  in local language  
and will be entered in the clinical database directly by [CONTACT_29018].  
Data from the project specific database will be exported into SAS data sets for further validation and analysis. Data Management details will be described in a separate Data Management Plan.  
For (S)ADRs a reconciliation between the data available in the Daiichi Sankyo safety database and the data in the eCRF will be performed as described in the separate (S)ADR Reconciliation Plan.

Proprietary and Confidential   Page 27 of 47  
10.7. Data Analysis  
All statistical methodology will be described in detail in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP ) 
which will be finalised at the latest prior to data snapshot . All variables collected in the eCRF 
as well as the data obtained from the patient reported outcomes assessments and all derived 
parameters will be used in the statistical analysis.  
Binary, categorical, and ordinal parameters will be summarised by [CONTACT_148740] (including ‘missing data’ as valid category 
at baseline) . Numerical data will be summarised by [CONTACT_148741]. In addition, 
adequate graphs (e.g. bar charts, box-whisker plots) may be presented. The purpose of all 
analyses will be purely descriptive/exploratory. Adverse drug reactions will be analysed 
overall and by [CONTACT_148742], based on MedDRA preferred terms and primary system organ class . 
 
10.8. Quality Control/Monitoring  
This study will be performed according to Good Epi[INVESTIGATOR_148728], specifically following the RECORD statement ( http://www.record -statement.org
).  
Remote monitoring will be performed on regular basis. The purpose is to ensure that the rights of the patients are protected, that the reported data is  complete  and that the conduct of 
the study is in compliance with the Observational Plan and applicable regulatory requirements.  
Onsite monitoring may be performed at  the sponsor’s discretion (e.g. at sites that have 
enrolled a pre-specified number of patients or depending on findings during remote monitoring).

10.9. Limitations of the Research Methods  
As this study aims at collecting and evaluating real world evidence, some limitations common 
to non-interventional studies apply. In addition to this, the following aspects need to be considered: 
• Only specialized centres will be used for the study which limits the number of sites per country. This may influence the sites’ representativeness for this specific patient population. 
• Eligible patients may choose not to participate in the Registry . Therefore,  this may 
impact the co nsecutive enrolment at a site.  To be able to assess the consecutiveness of 
enrolment, eligible patients will be liste d in the patient screening log. 
• At the follow up documentation time point all relevant ch anges/events since the last 
documentation time point need to be entered. Due to the long time between data collection  an underreporting of data might occur that are not considered essential or 
that are difficult to remember.  The patient memory aid and the patients’ medical 
records at the site shall support the precise documentation of the time between two data documentation time points. The utility of both records is however influenced by [CONTACT_148743].  It is expected that possible underreporting will not 
appear in case of severe events and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_148729].  
• Due to the nature of the disease the number of patients enrolled in this study is limited . 
• As the study is non-interventional, only data from the clinical routine treatment can be 
obtained. Therefore,  some information may be missing or unavailable. This needs to 
be taken into account when data is  analysed and reported.  
• No explicit non- eligibility criteria are defined to avoid selection of patients and thus 
violation of the ‘real- life’ principle.  
   DS-ONC -01-15- EU 
 Observational Plan , Version 4.[ADDRESS_170974] 02, 2019, which is the date pexidartinib became  available on the US market  (please refer to section 10.4.4)  
 In the US, Turalio (pexidartinib) was approved by [CONTACT_148744] a boxed warning for hepatotoxicity and is available only through a restricted program called the TURALIO Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program Safety reporting of initial hepatotoxicity event(s) will occur through the REMS program (i.e., REMS Liver Adverse Event form) and/or through routine pharmacovigilance. Reporting of non- hepatic, TURALIO -related 
safety events will occur only through routine pharmacovigilance, regardless of seriousness.  
 Safety reporting of initial hepatotoxicity event(s) will occur through the REMS program (i.e., REMS Liver Adverse Event form) and/or through routine pharmacovigilance. Reporting of non-hepatic, TURALIO -related safety events will occur only through routine 
pharmacovigilance, regardless of seriousness.  All Adverse Drug Reactions will need to be documented in the eCRF, independently whether they have already been reported through the REMS program or not.  
Adverse drug reactions that occurred from August 022019 onwards are to be collected as 
pexidartinib has become commercially available in the US  on that date . The documentation and 
reporting follows the Guideline on Good Pharmacovigilance Practices (GVP Module VI). The ADR documentation and processing follows the Guideline on Good Pharmacovigilance 
Practices (GVP) Module VI (Collection, management and submission of reports of suspected  adverse reactions to medicinal products).

normally used in man for the prophylaxis, diagnosis or therapy of disease or for the restoration, correction or modification of physiological function. 
Response in this context me ans that a causal relationship  between a medicinal product and an 
adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility. 
Adverse reaction also includes adverse clinical consequences associated with use of the product outside the terms of the Summary of Product Characteristics or other conditions laid down for 
   DS-ONC -01-15- EU 
 Observational Plan , Version 4.[ADDRESS_170975] be followed to conclusion to determine their outcome.  This information is 
important for both drug safety and public health concerns.  It is the responsibility of the 
Investigator, or designee, to report any pregnancy in a female patient  using the Exposure In 
Utero (EIU) Reporting form.  
Please contact [CONTACT_148745] a 
pregnancy.  The Investigator should make every effort to follow the patient  until completion of 
the pregnancy and complete the EIU Reporting Form with complete pregnancy outcome information, including normal delivery and induced abortion.  
The adverse pregnancy outcome, either  serious or non- serious, should be reported in accordance 
with study procedures.  If the outcome of the pregnancy meets any criteria for immediate 
classification as a SADR (e.g., post -partum complications, spontaneous or induced abortion, 
stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly, including that in an aborted fetus), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting ADRs outlined in Section 11.2.

12. PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
12.1. Review by [CONTACT_148734]/Competent Authorities  
Notification to or approval by [CONTACT_148746] a study centre. 
12.2. Insurance and Liability  
All treatments of patients included in this disease registry  are local standard of care and occur 
as part of the daily routine practice. Claims of the patient upon his physician will not be 
covered by [CONTACT_148747]. A specific patient’s ins urance for  disease registry  is not 
necessary.  
12.3. Patient Information, Informed Consent  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to inform the patient about his/her disease, 
possibilities for diagnostic and therapeutic measures, independent of a possible participation 
in any survey and therefore this information will not be part of the ICF.  
The written ICF will be provided to the study centres in the local language(s ). The ICF and 
any revision(s) should be approved by [CONTACT_11390] (IEC) prior to being 
provided to potential patients. 
The patient’s written informed consent will be documented in the patient’s medical records of 
the investigator. The ICF should be signed and personally dated both by [CONTACT_148748]. The original signed ICF should be retained at  the study site  (preferably in the patient’s medical records). A copy of the signed 
consent form should be provided to the patient. The date of informed consent will also be recorded in the electronic CRF (eCRF).  
12.4. Data Protection  
The patients' privacy will be kept according to the requirements of Directive 95/[ADDRESS_170977]. An 
identification number assigned to each patient will be used in lieu of the patient’s name [CONTACT_148751] e patient’s identity when reporting study- related data.  
Only authorised personnel such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33717], representatives of the sponsor and contract 
research organisation (CRO), and Competent Authorities (CAs) should have access to 
personalised patient data e.g. in original source documents (medical records). The patient will 
agree to this by [CONTACT_2960] a respective statement on the ICF.  
12.5. Numbering and Identification of Patients  
A unique identification number will be assigned to each patient, for the eCRF.  
At each study site  a patient identification list (‘Enrolment log’) will be kept linking the 
identification number to the patient’s identity.

12.6. Assessments (according to the study type)  
The investigators will be instructed about the correct documentation of the required data for 
each patient in the CRF. These data are available as part of the routine treatment. No 
diagnostic or monitoring procedures are applied to the patients in the study other than those performed as standard of care.  
12.6.1. Patient Reported Outcomes  
While physicians in daily routine assess health-related quality of life (QoL) in a non-
standardised manner (usually by [CONTACT_148749]), in the context of this registry they will be provided with validated questionnaires (EQ-5D-5L, Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), Worst Stiffness NRS item and PROMIS Physical Function Scale ), these will be available in the local 
language. Generally, questions in quality-of-life questionnaires are not more upsetting than those posed 
by a patient’s physician or by [CONTACT_148750] a day- to-day basis. The use of 
the questionnaires is considered to be non- interventional, as the questions raised are similar to 
those asked in routine care. Patients are free to accept or refuse to fill in the proposed 
questionnaires in this registry. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. EQ-5D-5L 
The EQ -5D- 5L is a preference -based general health status or health -related quality of life  
instrument consisting of two parts (Appendix 16.1).  The first part comprises five domains 
(mobility, self -care, u sual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each of which can 
have five levels ranging from no problems through profound difficulties. Accordingly, [ADDRESS_170979] rates their 
current health, with 0 representing the “worst health you can imagine” and 100 representing the “best health you can imagine. ” 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) short form  
The BPI [INVESTIGATOR_148730] a [ADDRESS_170980] week.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Worst Stiffness NRS item 
The Worst Stiffness NRS item is a one -item self -administered questionnaire assessing the 
“worst ” stiffness in the last 24 hours (Appendix 16.3).  The NRS for this item ranges from 0 
(“no stiffness ”) to 10 (“stiffness as bad as you can imagine” ). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. PROMIS Physical Function Scale  
Physical function items relevant to the assessment of lower and upper limb function are to be selected from the PROMIS physical function item bank (Appendix 16.4).  Items assessing 
lower  limb function will be administered to subjects with the lower extremity tumors, and 
items  assessing upper limb function will be administered to subjects with upper extremity 
tumors. The results from both sets of items will be combined and analysed together.

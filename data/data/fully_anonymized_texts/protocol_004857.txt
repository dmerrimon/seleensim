Chronic liver disorders (CLD) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality for individuals in the US.  Though  serologic analysis will often lead to a  conclusive diagnosis,  liver biopsy remains an  
important method for helpi[INVESTIGATOR_629188].  Percutaneous liver 
biopsy (PLB), transjugular liver  biopsy (TLB) and surgical liver biopsy (SLB) are alternative 
methods for  obtaining  hepatic tissue.  In recent  years endoscopic ultrasound guided-liver biopsy 
(EUS-LB) has come to the forefront as  a safe  and effective method for obtaining tissue  in CLD.  
There are several studies of the  safety  of EUS-LB as well as the adequacy of specimens obtained 
in this  fashion.  Most studies involve a 19-g needle, therefore in  this study we hope to compare 
the tissue yields of a  19-g  FNB  needle, in comparison to conventional  19-g FNA needle.   We 
predict that 19-g FNA and 19-g FNB needle will demonstrate similar diagnostic accuracy, with  
less visible blood artifact.  Similarly, we predict  the safety to be  equal.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY63BACKGROUND AND  SIGNIFICANCE
Chronic liver disease has  a number of causes, and leads to  significant mortality and morbidity in  
the [LOCATION_002].  It has  been estimated  that roughly 36,000 individuals die annually from the 
burden of chronic liver disease, thus early diagnosis and  intervention  are paramount to 
preventing such  complications [1].   Though serologic markers and non-invasive  diagnostic  
imaging modalities are used as a  method for determining the  underlying  disease process,  these 
methods lack the specificity of determining  etiology of a  patient’s  chronic liver  disease [2-5].   
Therefore, liver biopsy remains  the “gold standard” for obtaining valuable diagnostic and 
prognostic information.  
At present there exist  several methods for liver tissue acquisition.   The most  widely accepted 
method remains  percutaneous route  (PLB), which utilizes percussion  or imaging to  localization 
the biopsy site [6-8].  The issue with this approach  is its potential complication  of post-
procedural pain in  up to 84%, bleeding in 1/2500-10,000 procedures, with under 1/10,000  of 
these cases being fatal  [7-17].   Another  means for obtaining tissue samples is the transjugular  
route (TLB),  which also allows for  portal pressure measurement, and is usually reserved  for 
patients with coagulopathy[18,19].  
More recently, endoscopic  ultrasound  guided liver biopsy (EUS-LB) has been developed  as a 
newer LB technique [23, 24].  The feasibility of EUS-LB for liver lesions has been validated  
yielding excellent  diagnostic results in several studies [25-27].  This technique has also  been  
evaluated for hepatic  parenchymal disease with up to 90% diagnostic yield.  Subsequently, EUS-
LB using  a 19-g needle was compared to percutaneous/transjugular routes  showing  at least 
comparative, and in some instances  improved  sample acquisition, versus  other  methods [28].  
Different 19-g needles have  been  utilized in this  setting yielding variable  diagnostic specimens  
[29-33].  However, there  has yet to be comparison  of 19-g FNA versus a  19-g core  biopsy needle 
for EUS-LB.  
Primary End  Points
1.Proportion of cases for which a histologic  diagnosis could be made based  upon the  
amount of  tissue  obtained with the needle.
2.Number of portal tracts (PT)  in the specimen. [34-36]
3.Aggregate specimen length (ASL), length  of the longest pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959] (LLP), and  degree of

regarding alcohol  intake per  week and hepatotoxic medications (i.e.  acetaminophen).   A baseline 
INR and platelet count shall be  performed on all individuals  prior  to EUS-LB, as is the standard 
of care.
EUS-LB Protocol
Patients undergoing EUS-LB  receive anesthesia during the procedure, as per normal practice.  
This is  provided by a  certified registered  nurse  anesthetist (CRNA). The endosonographic study 
will be conducted with a linear array echoendoscope (GF-UC140-AL5; Olympus America, Center Valley, PA). Before needle  puncture of the desired lobe,  color Doppler  imaging  will be  
used to ensure the lack of vascular structures  in the  trajectory of the needle.  The EUS-LB will be  
performed in widely  separated regions of  the liver using a 19-g EUS-FNA needle (Expect 
Flexible 19g, [LOCATION_011] Scientific, Marlborough, MA) or a 19-g FNB needle (Acquire 19g, [LOCATION_011]  
Scientific, Marlborough, MA). A computer-generated randomized schema shall determine needle type selection.  
The left lobe is described as liver  parenchyma  identified a few centimeters below the 
gastroesophageal junction with the echoendoscope torqued clockwise. The right lobe is considered the large area of liver tissue can be seen through  the duodenal bulb, near the 
gallbladder [37]. The stylet is removed, heparin  flushed through the needle  lumen,  and the 
suction device set and attached  to the needle hub. The prepared needle is then inserted into the 
echoendoscope. A transgastric approach will be used to obtain samples from  the left lobe of the  
liver; a transduodenal approach, with the linear echoendoscope positioned  in the duodenal bulb, 
will be used  to obtain  samples from the large amount of liver parenchyma seen in  that location. 
Once adequate liver parenchymal penetration will be  achieved with the needle (∼2-6  cm), full 
suction will be  applied with a 20-mL vacuum syringe. One pass consists of a total of [ADDRESS_976049] and continuous 
endosonographic visualization of the tip of the  needle.
The needle  will then  be removed from  the echoendoscope. The specimen will be pushed from the 
needle with the stylet directly  into a microseive, and blood washed from the specimen with a  
gentle saline  rinse.  The endosonographer looks for multiple pi[INVESTIGATOR_629190] 5 to 15 mm  in length.  The  tissue cores are  then “floated”  off the microseive into 
formalin solution.   Heparin is flushed through the needle lumen prior  to the next pass. The 
biopsy process  is then  repeated on the opposite liver  lobe.  A pass per  liver lobe will be 
performed in each  patient; using the standard  19-g EUS-FNA needle  or the 19-g EUS FNB

6.8 Statistics
A representative from the  Biostatistics & Research Data Core will be  doing the statistical 
analysis. 
6.8.1 Statistical Analysis Plan
Assuming the 19-g FNB needle  has a success  percentage  of 98% (ie,>= 5 portal triads), and 
margin over  FNA needle  of 5% (98% vs. 93%), the study needs to evaluate 32 patients to 
achieve 80%  power for a  1-sided non-inferiority test. This also assumes each patient provides  2 
specimens.  If the margin  is increased  to 10% (98% vs.  88%), then the study needs to evaluate 18 
patients to achieve 80% power.
Descriptive statistics will be utilized to represent continuous and categorical variables, with results expressed as medians with ranges.  Multiple comparisons between the aggregate tissue 
length and CPT yield  from bilobar, left lobe  only, and right lobe only  biopsies will be carried  out 
using the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test. A P-value  of < 0.[ADDRESS_976056] been found  to provide adequate cores. It is felt  that 32 cases collected 
prospectively should  be adequate  to learn how the 19g  FNB  needle  compares to the  19g FNA 
needle in different patients with different liver conditions.

Records shall be retained for a  total of 6 years  as per Geisinger policy
7SAFETY MONITORING 
7.1 Adverse  Event Reporting
Clinical adverse events (AEs) will be monitored  throughout  the study.  All  AEs will  be reported 
to the institutional review board (IRB) regardless  of whether they are  considered study related.  
The date and time  of onset and outcome, course, intensity, action taken, and causality  to study 
treatment will  be assessed by [CONTACT_9154].  In the event of a serious AE (SAE),  this will be  
reported to the Geisinger IRB (GIRB) according to the GIRB guidelines.   All other AEs  will be  
summarized and submitted to GIRB during continuing review.
7.2 Definitions
An adverse event (AE) is  any untoward,  undesired,  or unplanned  event in the form  of signs, 
symptoms, disease, or  laboratory or physiologic observations occurring in a person given a test 
article or in a clinical  study. The  event  does not need  to be causally related to the  test article  or 
clinical study. 
[Include as applicable to study]
An AE  includes, but is not limited to, the  following:
Any clinically  significant worsening of  a preexisting condition.
An AE  occurring from  overdose of a  test article, whether accidental or intentional.  Define 
overdose for each test article  here  or in the  Overdose section.  Overdose is a dose greater  than

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY14that specified in the protocol.  OR Overdose is a dose greater  than  that specified  in the 
investigator’s brochure/label.  OR define overdose
An AE  occurring from  abuse (e.g.,  use for nonclinical reasons) of a test article.
An AE  that has been associated with the discontinuation of the use of a test article.
For reports from  post marketing studies, any failure of expected pharmacologic  action of a 
test article.   For over-the-counter products,  the recommended daily  dose must  be 
administered before failure of expected  pharmacologic action can  be attributed.
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that:
Results in death.
Is life-threatening (see below).
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_231321] (see below).
Results in a persistent  or significant disability or incapacity (see below).
Results in cancer.
Results in a congenital anomaly or birth  defect.
Additionally, important medical events  that may not result in death,  be life-threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_629191], based on appropriate medical  
judgment, they  may  jeopardize the  subject and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent  one of the  outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such events include  
allergic bronchospasm  requiring intensive  treatment in  an emergency room  or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or  convulsions that  do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development  of drug 
dependency or drug  abuse.
Life-threatening refers to immediate risk of death  as the event occurred per the reporter. A  
life-threatening experience does not include an  experience, had  it occurred  in a more severe 
form, might  have  caused  death, but as it actually occurred, did  not create an immediate risk of 
death. For example, hepatitis that  resolved  without evidence of hepatic failure would not be  
considered life-threatening, even though hepatitis of a more severe  nature can  be fatal.  Similarly, 
an allergic reaction resulting in angioedema  of the face would not  be life-threatening,  even 
though angioedema of the larynx,  allergic  bronchospasm, or anaphylaxis can  be fatal.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY15In addition,  a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a  preexisting condition that has not  worsened  does not constitute 
an SAE.
Disability is defined as  a substantial disruption in a person’s ability  to conduct  normal life 
functions.
If there is  any doubt about  whether the information  constitutes  an SAE, the  information  is treated 
as an SAE.
A protocol-related adverse event is an  AE occurring during a  clinical study that is not  related 
to the test  article, but is considered by [CONTACT_55886]  (or designee) to  be 
related to the research  conditions,  i.e., related to the fact that a subject  is participating in the 
study. For example, a  protocol-related AE may be an  untoward event occurring during  a washout 
period or an event  related  to a medical procedure  required by [CONTACT_760].
Other Reportable Information.  Certain  information, although not  considered  an SAE,  must be 
recorded, reported, and followed up as  indicated  for an SAE.   This  includes:  
Pregnancy  exposure to a test  article, except for exposure to  prenatal vitamins.  If a pregnancy 
is confirmed, use  of the test article  must  be discontinued immediately.   Information  about 
pregnancy exposure includes the  entire  course of pregnancy and delivery, and perinatal  and 
neonatal outcomes, even if there  are no abnormal findings.  Both  maternal  and paternal 
exposure are considered other  reportable  information.  For  exposure involving  the female 
partner of a male  subject,  the necessary  information  must be  collected  from  the subject, while 
respecting the confidentiality  of the  partner.
Lactation exposure to a test article  with  or without  an AE.   
Overdose of a test article as  specified  in this protocol with  or without an AE.  Baby [CONTACT_629209].
Inadvertent or accidental exposure to a test article with or without an AE.

8.[ADDRESS_976064] Risks
Potential Risks due to Study participation -  
A potential risk is loss of the patients’  privacy and loss of the confidentiality  of their  data.  
Upper endoscopy possesses a 0.0004-0.[ZIP_CODE]% risk of perforation, and less than 0.5% risk of bleeding [38].  Adverse events described with the EUS and fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_716258] a 
complication rate of 1.72% in prospective  studies and 0.64% in retrospective studies.   The risk of 
perforation for  EUS is roughly 0.06% and bleeding  0.13%.  There have not  been established 
increased risks of complication in patients  who undergo  EUS  with  different biopsy needles. 
However, the 19g needle  is the standard needle size  in use for EUS-LB, and has been found to be 
very safe.  
Potential Benefits
Included patients are already undergoing the  procedure to  make a  clinical diagnosis of the liver 
abnormality, and also have  the benefit of requiring only  one endoscopic procedure to  evaluate  
digestive system  problems  while at the same  time obtaining liver  biopsy.  As the potential 
complications with EUS-LB  seem to be lower  than other means of liver biopsy,  a potential 
benefit is sparing  patients from the  complications  caused by [CONTACT_629210].  This  
study shall also benefit future patients  by [CONTACT_629211]-LB with 19-g FNA versus 19-g FNB needles.

IRB Approved:  10/09/[ADDRESS_976065] Modified: 10/2/2017
IRB # 2017-0391
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY17Risk: Benefit Ratio 
A potential risk in this study involves loss of confidentiality.  The use of  password protected data 
storage, removal of  PHI and assignment  of randomly generated patient number and  limitation  of 
data to the study investigators shall limit this risk.  Additionally, there is a  small risk of 
perforation or bleeding in diagnostic endoscopy  and EUS-LB.  These risks  are outweighed by [CONTACT_629212]  a diagnosis behind their liver-related abnormality.   
Procedures to  Maintain Privacy  and Confidentiality  
As exposure of confidential information  is a potential risk, subject identifiers shall not  be 
recorded and subjects shall be given  a randomly generated number.   The project investigators 
shall be  the only ones with access to the study data, which  shall be kept on a password 
protected/locked Geisinger  computer.  All data will be destroyed at the completion  of this 
study’s manuscript completion.
Vulnerable Subjects
It is possible that terminally  ill patients may be involved in this study.  This  study will however  
not involve direct intervention  and not impact/delay the procedure for  which  they are  
undergoing.  The observational  nature  of the  study  and the subject’s ability to  exclude  them  from 
the study at any time shall be reinforced by [CONTACT_978]/Co-I.
No individuals who require substituted consent shall be involved  in this study, nor any children.
Compensation to Subjects
No compensation shall be granted to subjects as this is an  observational study and does not 
deviate from the standard  of care.
Treatment of Research-Related  Injuries
Potential procedure-related injuries would include  perforation or bleeding,  which  would be 
managed in a standard fashion.  There are no additional “research-related” injuries.  Any  injuries 
in the study cohort will be  a result of risks inherent to the  procedure.  This  is always explained 
during the consent  process for the  procedure  and is the standard  of care.

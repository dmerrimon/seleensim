Overall Study Design: This first -in-human  study is a Phase  1/2, randomized, observer -blind, 
dose-ranging study to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of mRNA -1010 
vaccine in adult participants ≥  18 years of age. The study comprises 3  parts: Phase  1/2, Phase  2 
NH, and Phase 2 E xtension.  
The Phase 1/2 part of the study will be a randomized, observer -blind, dose -ranging, 
placebo -controlled study to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of 
mRNA -1010 vaccine in healthy adult participants ≥  18 years of age. The Phas e 2 NH and 
Phase  2 Extension parts of the study will be randomized, observer -blind, dose -ranging, 
active -controlled studies to evaluate the immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety of 
mRNA -1010 vaccine in medically stable adults 18 years and older.  
All p articipants in each part of the study will participate in a screening period (up to 28  days 
before Day  1), treatment period (single dose of vaccine on Day  1), and a follow -up period (up 
to 6 months after vaccination).  
In the Phase 1/2 part of the study, the mRNA -1010 vaccine to be tested includes messenger 
RNAs (mRNAs) that encode for the surface glycoprotein hemagglutinins (HAs) of the following 
influenza virus strains recommended by [CONTACT_38375] (WHO) for 2020 -2021

of mRNA -1010 (6.25, 12.5, or 25 µg total mRNA; Vaccination Groups 1 to 3) and the active 
comparator (Vaccination Group  4). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_46326] (18  to 
< 50 years, or ≥  50 years).  
The Phase 1/2 part of the study comprises 6 scheduled study site visits: screening, Day  1, Day  8, 
Day 29 (Month  1), Day 57 (Month 2), and Day 181 (Month 6). The Phase 2 NH and Phase  2 
Extension parts of the study comprise 5 scheduled study site visits: Screening, Day 1, Day 29 
(Month  1), Day 91 (Month  3), and Day  181 (Month  6). The Phase [ADDRESS_83648] medically attended adverse events (MAAEs), adverse events (AEs) 
leading to withdrawal from study participation, serious AEs (SAEs), AEs of special interest 
(AESIs), information about concomitant medica tions associated with these events, and 
information about receipt of nonstudy vaccinations temporally associated with these events. 
These phone calls are scheduled monthly from Day  91 through Day  151 in the Phase 1/2 part 
and on Days  8 and 15 in the Phase  2 NH and Phase 2 Extension parts of the study.  
The study duration will be approximately 7  months for each participant enrolled in each part of 
the study: a screening period of up to 1  month and a study period of 6  months that includes a 
single dose of vacc ine on Day 1. The participant’s final visit (ie, end of study [EoS]) will be on 
Day 181 (Month 6), six  months after the study vaccination.  
All participants in each part of the study will be followed for safety and reactogenicity. On 
Day 1, participants wil l be instructed how to document, and report solicited adverse reactions 
(ARs) and influenza -like illness (ILI) symptoms (for Phase 2 NH part only) with a provided 
electronic diary (eDiary). Solicited ARs will be assessed for 7  days (the day of injection an d the 
following 6 days) after the study vaccination, and unsolicited AEs will be assessed for 28  days 
after the study vaccination; SAEs, AESIs, and MAAEs will be assessed from Day  1 throughout 
the study.  
All participants in the Phase 1/2 part of the study will provide nasopharyngeal (NP) swab 
samples before the injection on Day  1 for assessment of asymptomatic infection with respi[INVESTIGATOR_46264], including influenza virus and severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507]  2

Confidential  Page 14 For the Phase 2 NH part, as part of the safety assessments, active and passive surveillance for 
ILI will be conducted between Day 1 through Day  181/EoS. For active su rveillance, participants 
will be instructed to report whether ILI symptoms have been experienced, 3 to 4  times weekly 
from Day  1 through Day  29 and twice weekly from Day  30 through Day  181/EoS, via eDiary 
or telephone calls. If symptoms occur, participants  will be directed to return to the study site as 
soon as possible, but no later than [ADDRESS_83650] the participant by [CONTACT_756]. For passive surveillance, participants will be 
instructed to report symptoms of ILI any time from Day  1 through Day  181/E oS. Participants in 
the Phase  [ADDRESS_83651] protocol -defined ILI between Day  1 through Day  29 will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_5203] -time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT -PCR) testing of an 
NP specimen for influenza (and other respi[INVESTIGATOR_76803] ). An NP swab specimen for 
pathogens, including influenza virus and SARS -CoV -2 will be collected any time from Day 1 
through Day 181/EoS if participants have protocol -defined ILI or symptoms suggestive of

For the Phase 2 Extension part, a study site visit or a consultation (unscheduled study visit) will 
be arranged within [ADDRESS_83652] an NP swab sample if 
participants experience  symptoms consistent with the US CDC definition of ILI and/or 
COVID -19 during the course of the study.  
All participants in the Phase 1/2 part of the study will provide a blood specimen before injection 
on Day  1 and additional blood specimens through the ne xt 6 months  for immunogenicity (on 
Days  8, 29, and 181/EoS). In the Phase  [ADDRESS_83653] es from a subset of participants at Days 91 and 181/EoS 
may be used for additional assessments. The Phase 2 Extension part also contains an optional 
study site visit on Day 4 for blood sample collection for potential biomarker analysis. 
Furthermore, blood samples for safety or other medical concerns may be collected according to 
the Investigator’s judgment at scheduled study site visits during each part of the study.  
Participants may experience AEs that necessitate an unscheduled visit. There may also be 
situations in which the Investigator asks a participant to report for an unscheduled visit following 
the report of an AE. Additional examinations may be conducted at these visits as necessary to 
ensure the safety and well -being of participants during the stu dy. Electronic case report forms 
should be completed for each unscheduled visit.

For the Phase 1/2 part, there is 1 planned interim analysis (IA), which will include safety and 
immunogenicity data of all participants (all vaccination groups) after completion of the Day  29 
Visit. For the Phase 2 NH and Phase 2 Extension parts, an IA  of safety (reactogenicity and 
immunogenicity as applicable) will be performed after participants have completed the Day  29 
Visit for each part of the study.  
Immunizations for the Phase 1/2 part of the study are planned during the NH summer and all 
partici pants will be recommended to receive a licensed 2021 -22 NH seasonal influenza vaccine 
during their participation in the study after completion of the Day  29 Visit. Immunizations for 
the Phase 2 NH part of the study are planned during the NH influenza seaso n. Immunizations 
for the Phase 2 Extension part are planned during the NH spring.  
Safety Oversight: Safety monitoring for this study will include blinded study team members, 
inclusive of, at a minimum, the Sponsor’s medical monitor, medical monitor of the  contract 
research organization (CRO), a blinded IST, and an unblinded Data and Safety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB). The study team will conduct ongoing blinded safety reviews during the study 
and will be responsible for notifying the IST and DSMB of potential safety signal events or the 
triggering of pause rules.

Hypothesis:  
No formal hypotheses will be tested.  
Sample Size:  
The sample size for this study is not driven by [CONTACT_76850]. The number of proposed participants is considered sufficient to provide a descriptive 
summary of the safety and immunogenicity of di fferent dose levels of mRNA -1010.  
For the Phase 1/2 part of the study, approximately 180 participants will be randomly assigned 
in this study, with approximately 45  participants in each vaccination group . With 45  participants 
receiving an investigational v accine, there is a probability of approximately 90% to observe at 
least 1 participant with an AE, if the true incidence rate of the AE is 5%; if the true incidence 
rate is 10%, then the probability to observe it will be approximately 99%.  
For the Phase 2 NH part of the study, approximately 500 participants will be randomly assigned 
in a 3:3:3:1 ratio to the mRNA -1010 25, 50, 100 µg groups, or the Active Comparator Group. 
A total of 450 participants will receive the mRNA -1010 vaccine (150 participants at ea ch dose 
level). A sample size of [ADDRESS_83667] a 95% probability to 
observe at least 1  participant with an AE , if the true incidence rate is 2%; if the true incidence 
rate is 3%, then the probability to observe it will be  99%. 
For the Phase 2 Extension part of the study, approximately 200 participants will be randomly 
assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to the mRNA -1010 6.25, 12.5, 25 µg groups, or the Active 
Comparator Group. A total of 150 participants will receive the mRNA -1010  vaccine 
(50 participants at each dose level). With  50 participants receiving an investigational vaccine, 
there is a probability of approximately 92% to observe at least 1 participant with an AE, if the 
true incidence rate of the AE is 5%; if the true inci dence rate is 10%, then the probability to 
observe it will be approximately 99%.

1 The Screening Visit and Day 1 Visit may be performed on the same day or a different day. Additionally, the Screening Visit ma y be performed over multiple visits if within the 
28-day screening window.  
2 Verbal confirmation of medical history is acceptable.  
3 Physical examination: A full physical examination, including height and weight, will be performed at screening; symptom -directed physical examinations will be performed at all 
other clinic visits (ie, study site visits). Interim physical examinations will be performed at the discretion of the Investi gator. Any clinically significant finding identified by a 
healthcare professional during study visits should be reported as an MAAE.  
4 Vital sign measurement: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body temperature. The prefer red route of temperature assessment is oral. 
Participants must not eat or drink anything hot or cold within [ADDRESS_83680] 5 minutes before all 
measurements are taken. Vital signs will be collected on the day of vaccination, once before vaccination and approximately 1 hour after vaccination. Vital signs may be collected 
at other study site visits in conjunction with a symptom -directed physical examination. If any of the vital sign measurements meet the toxicity grading criteria for clinical 
abnormalities of Grade  3 or greater, the abnormal value and grade  will be documented in the AE section of the eCRF (unless there is another known cause of the abnormality that 
would result in an AE classification). The Investigator will continue to monitor the participant with additional assessments until the vital sign  value has reached the reference 
range, returns to the vital sign value at baseline, is considered stable or until the Investigator determines that follow -up is no longer medically necessary.  
[ADDRESS_83681] will be performed at the Screening Visit (and before the vaccine dose on Day 1 if Day 1 is not on the same day as the Screening Visit). At the 
discretion of the Investigator, a pregnancy test either via blood or point -of-care urine can be performed at any time. The FSH level may b e measured at the Screening Visit as 
necessary and at the discretion of the Investigator, to confirm postmenopausal status.  
6 See Table 9 for dose levels and vaccination groups. All participants will be randomized to receive a single 0.5 -mL IM injection.

2.1. Study Rationale  
Seasonal influenza viruses are estimated by [CONTACT_38375] (WHO) to cause 3 to 
5 million cases of severe illness and up to 650,000 deaths each year, which is a severe challenge 
to public health ( WHO 2018 ). Influenza epi[INVESTIGATOR_14258] a seasonal 
circulation pattern with increased cases during the winter months in the Northern Hemi sphere 
(NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH) ( Riedel et al 2019 ). Since influenza viruses continuously 
change through a process termed antigenic drift, the circulating viruses are actively monitored by 
a worldwide monitoring network c oordinated by [CONTACT_14300] ( Monto 2018 ). An expert panel 
recommends certain influenza virus strains for vaccine manufacturing, based on observed 
circulation patterns and antigenic changes, twice a year (once for NH and once for SH). 
Influenza  A and B viruses are the most relevant influenza viruses for human infection. Therefore, 
current vaccine recommendations include 1 influenza A H1N1 strain, 1 influenza  A H3N2 strain, 
and 2 influenza B strains (covering the B/Victoria and B/Yamagata l ineages).  
Currently licensed seasonal influenza virus vaccines rarely exceed 60% overall effectiveness and 
are less effective during the years when the circulating viruses do not match the strains selected 
for the vaccine antigens ( CDC 2020a ). Influenza vaccines based on messenger RNA (mRNA) 
technology could provide several benefits compared with current vaccines, including the ability to 
respond to strain changes more quickly; avoidance of mutations that may be acquired during 
vaccine production in eggs or cell culture; stronger immune responses; and improved protection 
in older adults ( Rockman et al 2020 ). 
2.2. Background and Overview  
ModernaTX, Inc. (Sponsor) has developed a rapid response proprietary vacc ine platform based on 
the mRNA delivery system. The platform is based on the principle and observations that cells 
in vivo can take up mRNA, translate it, and then express protein viral antigen(s) on the cell surface. 
The delivered mRNA does not enter the cellular nucleus or interact with the genome, is 
nonreplicating, and is expressed transiently.  
Two mRNA vaccines against the severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS -CoV -2), 
including [COMPANY_007] Inc.’s BNT162b2 ( Polack et  al 2020 ) and the Sponsor’s mRNA -1273 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] , [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] , and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) have been issued emergency use 
authorizations by [CONTACT_24623] (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  
2.2.1.  mRNA -1010  
The Sponsor is using its mRNA -based platform to develop a novel lipid nanoparticle 
(LNP) -encapsulated mRNA -based vaccine against diseases caused by [CONTACT_46311]  A 
ModernaTX, Inc.  03 Feb 2022  
Protocol: mRNA -1010 -P101 Amendment  4 mRNA -1010  
 
Confidential  Page 52 and B. The proposed development candidate mRNA -1010 is a quadrivalent vaccine containing 
mRNAs that encode for the hemagglutinins (HAs) of the 4 strains recommended by [CONTACT_76858]- or recombinant -based vaccines. Equal amounts of mRNAs that encode for membrane -bound 
wild-type versions of each of the 4 different strains will be used for the HA components. The 
mRNA -1010 development candidate will be administered as a single intramuscular (IM) injection 
and aims to elicit protection from all seasonal influenza viruses covered by [CONTACT_29500].  
The S ponsor is conducting this first -in-human (FIH) Phase 1/2 study of mRNA -1010, a seasonal 
influenza vaccine, to establish preliminary safety, reactogenicity,  and immunogenicity data to 
support the initiation of a Phase 3 program for this vaccine. The design of this study will include 
an immunogenicity objective for the HA component, using HA inhibition (HAI) as a correlate of 
protection against influenza illness. The rationale for this approach is based on the established 
precedent of using HA -based immunolog ic correlates for clinical assessment and licensure of 
influenza vaccines ( DHHS  2007a ; Dunning et al 2016 ; EMA 2016 ). In this FIH study, the safety, 
reactogenicity, and immunoge nicity of mRNA -1010 vaccine will be compared with placebo 
(Phase  1/2 part) and with an active comparator (Phase  2 NH and Phase 2 Extension part s). The 
vaccine administration in the Phase  1/2 part and the Phase 2 Extension part of the study are planned 
outside the NH influenza season. In the Phase  2 NH part, the vaccine administration is planned 
during the NH influenza season.  
2.2.2.  Nonclinical Studies  
Using individually formulated HA -encoding mRNAs (preclinical material), 2  mouse 
immunogenicity studies were perfo rmed. The HA sequences used for preclinical formulation were 
from wild -type HAs.  
Both studies used a prime/boost regimen with a 3 -week interval. Immunized mice were bled on 
Day 21 (3  weeks after the prime dose) and Day 36 ([ADDRESS_83691] dose), an d 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody titers were determined with an enzyme -linked immunosorbent 
assay using recombinant HA proteins.  
The first study compared mice immunized with individual mRNAs or a combination of all 4  HA 
mRNAs at 2 different doses (2 or 0. 4 µg of each mRNA), based on the following strains 
recommended for the 2020 -2021 NH influenza season:  
• A/Hawaii/70/2019(H1N1)pdm09  
• A/Hong Kong/45/2019(H3N2)  
• B/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria lineage)  
• B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata lineage)  
ModernaTX, Inc.  03 Feb 2022  
Protocol: mRNA -[ADDRESS_83692] mRNA constructs (individual and combinations).  
The second  mouse immunogenicity study aimed to confirm that the 2021 SH composition is 
similarly immunogenic with the 2020 -2021 NH composition. The compositions differed only for 
the H1N1 strain; the SH composition included A/Wisconsin/588/2019(H1N1)pdm09 instead of  
the A/Hawaii/70/2019(H1N1)pdm09 strain.  
No difference in immunogenicity (HA IgG antibody titers) based on the strain/mRNA construct 
used for immunization (A/Hawaii/70/2019 in the NH composition versus A/Wisconsin/588/2019 
in the SH composition) was observ ed, suggesting that the mRNA platform will support annual 
strain updates.  
Additional studies to assess protection of mice from challenge with mouse -adapted H1N1 and 
H3N2 viruses after a single immunization and a study to assess immunogenicity and protectio n 
from H1N1 challenge after 2 immunizations in ferrets are currently ongoing. Results will be 
available in the planned investigational new drug (IND) application.  
A detailed review of the nonclinical experience with mRNA -1010 vaccine will be provided in th e 
investigator’s brochure (IB).

2.3.1.  Known Potential Benefits  
The following benefits may accrue to participants who receive the mRNA -1010 vaccine:  
• The mRNA -[ADDRESS_83694] seasonal influenza strains as 
defined by [CONTACT_46314] 2020 -2021 SH flu season (Phase  1/2) or against the 
seasonal influenza strains as defined by [CONTACT_46314] 2021 -2022 NH flu season 
(Phase  2 NH  and Phase 2 Extension).  
• Participants will have a baseline (Day 1) evaluation for respi[INVESTIGATOR_13531] 
(Phase  1/2 part), including influenza virus and SARS -CoV -2, and ongoing 
surveillance for influenza -like illness ( ILI) and/or coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID -19) thro ughout the study (Phase 1/2,  Phase 2 NH, and Phase 2 Extension).  
• The study will contribute to the development of a potentially efficacious vaccine 
against seasonal influenza.

Adverse events (AEs) ranging from immediate mild allergic reactions (eg, urticaria) to systemic 
allergic reactions (eg, anaphylaxis) may occur following any vaccination. Systemic allergic 
reactions are very rare and are estimated to occur once per 450,000 vaccinations for vaccines tha t 
do not contain allergens such as gelatin or egg protein ( Zent et al 2002 ). Since the authorization of 
the mRNA -1273 vaccine for COVID -19, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) estimate of the rate of anaphylaxis based on reporting in the Vaccine Adverse Event 
Reporting System is approximately 2.5 cases/million doses administered 
(Shimabukuro  et al 2021 ). As a precaution, all participants will remain under observation at the 
study sit e for at least 60 minutes after injection.  
Vasovagal syncope (fainting) can occur before or after any vaccination, is usually triggered by 
[CONTACT_76859]. Therefore, 
it is importan t that standard precautions and procedures are followed to avoid injury from fainting.  
Intramuscular injection with other mRNA vaccines manufactured by [CONTACT_76860] -102 (heptadecan -9-yl 8 -((2-hydroxyethyl)(6 -oxo-6-
(undecyloxy)h exyl)amino)octanoate) lipid formulation have commonly resulted in transient and 
self-limiting local inflammatory reactions. These typi[INVESTIGATOR_46274], erythema (redness), or 
swelling (hardness) at the injection site, which were mostly mild to moderate in severity and 
usually occurred within 24  hours of injection. Laboratory abnormalities (including increases in 
liver function tests and serum lipase levels) following injection have been observed in early phase 
clinical studies with similar mRNA -based vac cines. These abnormalities were without clinical 
symptoms or signs and returned toward baseline (Day 1) values over time.  
In a recently completed Phase  [ADDRESS_83695] cases, the reactions resolved spontaneously within several days 
(Baden et al 2021 ). 
Similarly, safety results from Phase  1 studies conducted by [CONTACT_17190] 2 mRNA vaccines 
containing the HA glycoprot eins from the H10N8 and H7N9 avian influenza viruses were well 
tolerated, although the Sponsor’s LNP/mRNA platform has since been updated (eg,  SM-102 is 
used in mRNA -1010 and mRNA -1273; Feldman et al 2019 ). 
There have been very r are reports of myocarditis and pericarditis occurring after vaccination with 
COVID -[ADDRESS_83696] been reported in young males shortly 
after the second dose of the vaccine. These are typi[INVESTIGATOR_76812], Inc.  03 Feb 2022  
Protocol: mRNA -[ADDRESS_83697]. Investigators and study participants 
should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis ( Gargano et al 2021 ). 
2.3.3.  Overall Benefit/Ris k Conclusion  
Three dose levels (50, 100, and 200 µg of total mRNA) of mRNA -1010 vaccine administered as a 
single IM injection will be evaluated in the Phase 1/2 part of the study. The safety, reactogenicity, 
and immunogenicity of the 3 dose levels of mRNA -1010 will be compared with placebo. The study 
schema for the Phase 1/2 part of the study is provided in Figure 1. 
In the Phase 1/[ADDRESS_83698] 2 stages: initial stage and 
expansion stage. A total of 36  participants (9 participants in each vaccination group) will be  
randomly assigned in the initial stage in parallel fashion. Enrollment and vaccination in the 
expansion stage will begin only after an internal safety team (IST) performs a blinded review of 
all available safety data up to [ADDRESS_83699], the vaccine 
administration in the Phase 1/2 part of this FIH study is planned outside the NH influenza season.  
In the Phase 2 NH part, the three dose levels of mRNA -1010 vaccine to be evaluated are 25, 50, 
and 100 µg of total mRNA  based on interim analysis (IA) of the Phase 1/2 part . In addition, the 
Phase  2 NH part of the study will also include a composition change of mRNA -1010 (strain upda te 
for the 2021 -2022 NH season), as well as the inclusion of a licensed active comparator. In this 
part, vaccine administration is planned during the NH influenza season. The study schema for the 
Phase  2 NH part of the study is provided in Figure 2. 
In the Phase 2 Extension part, the 3 dose levels of mRNA -1010 vaccine to be evaluated are 6.25, 
12.5, and 25 µg of total mRNA based on IA of the Phase 1/2 part . The Phase  2 Extension part of 
the study will include the same composition of mRNA -1010 as the Phase 2 NH part. In this part, 
vaccine administration is planned outside the NH influenza season. The study schema for the 
Phase  2 Extension part of the study i s provided in  Figure 3. 
Serological data from all participants will be used to infer vaccine immunogenicity. All 
participants will be followed up for 6  months after the study vaccination. Safety will be monitored 
throughout the study ( Section 8.4). 
Considering the nonclinical data for the mRNA -1010 vaccine and the safety data for the other 
mRNA vaccines manuf actured by [CONTACT_76861] -102 lipid 
formulation, the Sponsor considers the potential benefits of participation to exceed the risks.

safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of mRNA -1010 vaccine in adult participants 
≥ 18 years of age. The study comprises 3 parts: Phase 1/2,  Phase  2 NH, and Phase  2 Extension.  
The Phase 1/2 part of the study will be a randomized, observer -blind, dose -ranging, 
placebo -controlled study to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of 
mRNA -1010 vaccine in healthy adult participants ≥  18 years of age. The Phase 2 NH and Phase  2 
Extension parts of the study will be randomized, observer -blind, dose -ranging, active -controlled 
studies to evaluate the immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety of mRNA -1010 vaccine in 
medically stable adults 18 ye ars and older.  
All participants in each part of the study will participate in a screening period (up to 28  days before 
Day 1), treatment period (single dose of vaccine on Day 1), and a follow -up period (up to 6  months 
after vaccination).  
In the Phase 1/2 p art of the study, the mRNA -1010 vaccine to be tested includes mRNAs that 
encode for the surface glycoprotein HAs of the following influenza virus strains recommended by

Confidential  Page 65 samples for safety or other medical concerns may be collected according to the Investigator’s 
judgment at scheduled study site visits during each part of the study.  
Participants may experience AEs that necessi tate an unscheduled visit. There may also be 
situations in which the Investigator asks a participant to report for an unscheduled visit following 
the report of an AE. Additional examinations may be conducted at these visits as necessary to 
ensure the safet y and well -being of participants during the study. Electronic case report forms 
(eCRFs) should be completed for each unscheduled visit.  
The study will be observer -blind as to which investigational product (IP; mRNA -1010 or placebo 
in the Phase  1/2 part ; mRNA -1010 or the active comparator in the Phase 2 NH and Phase  2 
Extension parts) or dose level is administered. Participants will receive the IP by 0.5 -mL IM 
injection on Day  1. All participants, study site staff involved in participant assessment, and 
Sponsor personnel (or its designees) will be blinded to individual dosing assignment until the study 
database is locked and unblinded. Details regarding blinding are provided in Section 9.1 and the 
study Data Blinding Plan. Preparation of IP for administration will be conducted on site by [CONTACT_76868].  
Safety monitoring fo r this study will include blinded study team members, inclusive of, at a 
minimum, the Sponsor’s medical monitor, medical monitor of the contract research organization 
(CRO), a blinded IST, and an unblinded Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The study  
team will conduct ongoing blinded safety reviews during the study and will be responsible for 
notifying the IST and DSMB of potential safety signal events or the triggering of pause rules 
(Section  7.1). 
For the initial stage in the Phase 1/[ADDRESS_83716] 36  participants (9  participants per vaccination group) have 
completed their Day  [ADDRESS_83717] a 
blinded review of available safety data from the Phase  1/[ADDRESS_83718] of this study. This committee will be 
composed of independent members with relevant therapeutic and/or biostatistical expertise to 
allow for the ongoing unblinded review of safety data from this study population. Safety data will  
be reviewed according to intervals defined in the DSMB charter and will also occur as needed 
when study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_76813], or as otherwise requested by [CONTACT_76846]/or 
IST. See Section  11.1.[ADDRESS_83719] and DSMB constituted in this study.

Confidential  Page 66 For the Phase 1/2 part, there is 1 planned IA, which will include safety and immunogenicity data 
of all participants (all vaccination groups) after completion of the Day  29 Visit. For the Phase  2 
NH and Phase 2 Extension parts, an IA of safety ( reactogenic ity and immunogenicity as 
applicable) will be performed after participants have completed the Day  29 Visit for each part  of 
the study . See Section  9.6 for details.  
Immunizations for the Phase 1/2 part of the study are planned during the NH summer and all 
participants will be recommended to receive a licensed 2021 -2022 NH seasonal influenza vaccine 
during their participation in the study after completio n of the Day  29 Visit. Immunizations for the 
Phase  2 NH part of the study are planned during the NH influenza season. Immunizations for the 
Phase 2 Extension part are planned during the NH spring.  
4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
This study is designed as an observer -blind study. In the Phase  1/2 part of the study, participants 
in Vaccination Groups 1 to 3 will receive mRNA -1010 vaccine and those in Vaccination Group  4 
will receive placebo. The placebo will be used for descriptive comparisons of safety and 
immunogenicity. In the Phase  2 NH part, participants in Vaccination Groups 1 to 3 will receive 
mRNA -1010 vaccine and those in Vaccination Group  4 will receive a licensed quadrivalent 
seasonal influenza vaccine in order to assess n oninferior immunogenicity.  In the Phase  2 Extension 
part, participants in Vaccination Groups 1 to 3 will receive mRNA -1010 vaccine and those in 
Vaccination Group  4 will receive a licensed quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine in order to 
compare immunoge nicity.  
In this observer -blind study, all participants, study site staff involved in participant assessment, 
and Sponsor personnel (or its designees) will be blinded to participant vaccine allocation. A limited 
number of Sponsor and/or CRO personnel will b e unblinded to conduct safety data analyses for 
the DSMB safety data reviews (as described in the DSMB charter) and perform the IA. Unblinded 
study personnel, who will not participate in any other aspect of the study, will perform IP 
accountability, dose p reparation, and IP administration.  
In the Phase 1/2 part, all participants will provide NP swab samples before the injection on Day  1 
for assessment of asymptomatic infection with respi[INVESTIGATOR_13531], including influenza virus 
and SARS -CoV -2, as influenz a or COVID -19 symptoms may confound reactogenicity 
assessments. Furthermore, if a participant experiences an MAAE or any signs or symptoms 
suggesting ILI and/or COVID -19, an additional NP swab sample will be collected to confirm the 
diagnosis via RT -PCR. In the Phase 2 NH and Phase 2 Extension parts, the NP swab samples for 
assessment of infection with respi[INVESTIGATOR_13531], including influenza virus and SARS -CoV -2, 
will be collected anytime from Day  1 through Day  181/EoS if the participants have 
protocol -defined ILI (Phase 2 NH) or CDC -defined ILI (Phase 2 Extension) or symptoms

Confidential  Page 67 suggestive of COVID -19 or other upper or lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_76810]’s 
discretion. Participants who manifest ILI between Day  1 through Day  29 will be evaluated b y 
RT-PCR testing of an NP specimen for influenza (and other respi[INVESTIGATOR_13531]). Additionally, 
in all parts of the study, clinical information may be collected to evaluate the severity of the clinical 
case.  
4.3. Choice of Vaccine Dose  
No clinical studies of mRNA -[ADDRESS_83720] been completed to date.  
Previous studies of the Sponsor’s mRNA/LNP SM -[ADDRESS_83721] assessed dose levels as high 
as 250  µg for mRNA -1273, a SARS -CoV -2 vaccine ( Jackson et al 2020 , [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), and 
mRNA -1893, a Zika vaccine (unpublished data, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). Additionally, doses up to 300  µg 
of the multivalent mRNA -1647, a cytomegalovirus vaccine (unpublished data, NCT03382 405), 
and the multivalent mRNA -1653, a combination vaccine against human metapneumovirus and 
parainfluenza virus type  3 (unpublished data, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), have been tested in Phase  1 studies. 
The vaccines were generally well to lerated at these dose levels.  
The Sponsor has previously evaluated the immunogenicity of 2 mRNA vaccines containing the 
HA glycoprotein from the H10N8 and H7N9 influenza viruses. Although differences in the 
mRNA/LNP platform and the administration schedule  (2 doses were given 3 weeks apart) limit 
extrapolation of the safety data, these mRNA vaccines against H10N8 and H7N9 influenza viruses 
elicited robust humoral immune responses and were well tolerated up to dose levels of 100  µg (for 
each HA type; Feldman et al 2019 ). 
The FIH Phase 1/2 clinical study of mRNA -1010 vaccine will evaluate the immunogenicity of 
mRNA -1010 at proposed total dose levels of 50  µg (12.5  µg/mRNA), 100  µg (25  µg/mRNA), and 
200 µg (50  µg/mRNA), administered as a single IM injection in healthy adults ≥  18 years of age. 
Based on IA results of the Phase 1/2 study, the 200 µg dose of mRNA -1010 di d not meet the 
Sponsor's desired reactogenicity profile. In the Phase [ADDRESS_83722] a lower dose level of 25 µg in lieu of 200 µg, keepi[INVESTIGATOR_76814] 50 and 
100 µg unchanged. Thus, t he Phase 2 NH part will evaluate the immunogenicity of mRNA -1010 
at proposed total dose levels of 25  µg (6.25  µg/mRNA), 50  µg (12.5  µg/mRNA), and 100  µg 
(25 µg/mRNA), administered as a single IM injection in medically stable adults ≥  18 years of age.  
Based on IA of the Phase  1/[ADDRESS_83723] lower 
dose levels of 6.25 and 12.5  µg of mRNA -1010, and to keep the Phase  2 NH mRNA -1010 dose 
level of 25 µg and the active comparator unchanged. Thus, the Phase  2 Extension part will evaluate 
the immunogenicity of mRNA -1010 at proposed total dose levels of 6.25, 12.5, and 25  µg, 
administered as a single IM injection in medically stable adults ≥  18 years of age.

6.2.1.  Phase 1/2  
The Sponsor’s Biostatistics Department  or designee will generate the randomized allocation 
schedule(s) for vaccination group assignment. Overall, approximately 180 participants will be 
randomized in a 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_83740] bo, with approximately 45  participants randomly assigned to each 
vaccination group. A total of 36 participants (9 participants in each vaccination group) will be 
randomly assigned in the initial stage of the study. A total of 144  participants (36  participa nts in 
each vaccination group) will be randomly assigned in the expansion stage of the study. 
Randomization in the expansion stage will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (18 to < 50  years versus ≥  50 years) 
and will be balanced across the 2 age groups within each vacci nation group.  
6.2.2.  Phase 2 Northern Hemisphere  
The Sponsor’s Biostatistics Department or designee will generate the randomized allocation 
schedule(s) for vaccination group assignment. Overall, approximately 500 participants will be 
randomly assigned in a 3:3:3: 1 ratio to receive either mRNA -1010 25 μg, mRNA -1010 50  μg, 
mRNA -1010 100  μg, or licensed quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine (active comparator), 
with approximately 150  participants randomly assigned to each mRNA -1010 vaccination group 
and 50  particip ants to the Active Comparator Group. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] 
(18 to < 50 years, 50 to < 65  years, or ≥  65 years) and vaccination status in the previous flu season 
(received or not received) . 
6.2.3.  Phase 2 Extension  
The Sponsor’s Biostatistics Department or designee will generate the randomized allocation 
schedule(s) for vaccination group assignment. Overall, approximately 200 participants will be 
randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive either mRNA -1010 6.25 μ g, mRNA -1010 12.5  μg, 
mRNA -1010 25  μg, or licensed quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine (active comparator), with 
approximately  50 participants randomly assigned to each mRNA -1010 vaccination group and  
50 participants to the Active Comparator Group. Ran domization will be stratified by [CONTACT_654]

volume of 0.5  mL and will contain mRNA -1010 at a dose of 25  µg (Vaccination Group  1), 50  µg 
(Vaccination Group  2), or 100  µg (Vaccination Group  3). For the Pha se [ADDRESS_83743] a volume of 0.5  mL and will contain mRNA -1010 at a 
dose of 6.25  µg (Vaccination Group  1), 12.5  µg (Vaccination Group  2), or 25  µg (Vaccination 
Group  3). For Vaccination Group 4 in the Phase  1/2 part of the study, placebo will be administered 
at a volume of 0.5  mL. For Vaccination Group 4 in the Phase  2 NH part of the study, the active 
comparator will be administered at a volume of 0.5  mL. For Vaccination Group 4 in the Phase  2 
Extension part of the study, the active comparator will be administered at a volume of 0.5  mL. The 
IP (mRNA -1010, placebo, and active comparator) preparation instructions are detailed in the 
Pharmacy Manual.  
6.3.2.  Investigational Product Administration  
The IP ( mRNA -1010 or placeb o during the Phase  1/2 part  and mRNA -1010 or the active 
comparator during the Phase 2 NH and Phase 2 Extension parts ) will be administered as a single 
IM injection into the deltoid muscle on Day 1. Preferably, the IP should be administered into the 
nondominant arm.  
Participants will be monitored for a minimum of 60 minutes after administration of the IP. 
Assessments will include vital sign measurements and monitoring for local or systemic reactions 
as shown in the SoE for Phase  1/2 (Table  1), Phase  2 NH (Table  2), and Phase  2 Extension ( Table 
3) parts of the study.  
The study site will be appropriately staffed with individuals with basic cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation training/certification. Either onsite resuscitation equipment and personnel or 
appropriate protocols for the rapid transport of a participant to a resuscitation area or facility are 
required.  
6.3.3.  Investigational Product Delivery and Receipt  
The Sponsor or designee is responsible for the fol lowing:  
• Supplying the IP (mRNA -1010, placebo, and active comparator).  
• Confirming the appropriate labeling of the IP for clinical study use, so that it 
complies with the US legal requirements.  
The Investigator is responsible for acknowledging receipt of the  IP by a designated staff member 
at the site, which includes the following:  
• Confirming that the IP was received in good condition.

technique.  
Further description of the IP and corresponding instructions for the receipt, storage, preparation , 
administration, accountability, and destruction are described in the Pharmacy Manual.  
6.3.4.  Investigational Product Packaging and Labeling  
The Sponsor will provide the Investigator (via the study site pharmacy) with adequate quantities 
of the IP. Sterile mRNA -1010 for the Phase 1/[ADDRESS_83744] all required labeling per regulations and will be 
supplied to the pharmacy in an unblinded manner. The Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee will supply 
the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for use as both placebo (Phase 1/2) and diluent for the 
mRNA -1010 vaccine (as applicable) as well as the active c omparator (Phase  2 NH  and Phase  2 
Extension ). The 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP bears a commercial label and does not 
contain study -specific identification.  
The IP will be packaged and labeled in accordance with the standard operating procedures of t he 
Sponsor or of its designee, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title  21 Good Manufacturing 
Practice guidelines, International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
guidelines, guidelines for Quality System Regulations, and applicab le regulations.

access and must be protected from moisture and light until it is prepared for administration 
(Section  6.3.1 ). The freezer should have automated temperature recording and a [ADDRESS_83746] of compliance with 
these storage conditions. The study s ite is responsible for reporting any IP that was not temperature 
controlled during shipment or storage. Such IP will be retained for inspection by [CONTACT_76869].  
The 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP should be s tored at 20 °C to 25 °C (68 °F to 77 °F) in a 
restricted access area.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  03 Feb 2022  
Protocol: mRNA -[ADDRESS_83747] observation of medically qualified study 
staff, and IP administration will be appropriately recorded (date and time) in the eCRF. Qualified 
staff will confirm that the participant has received the entire dose o f the IP. If a participant does 
not receive the IP, the reason for the missed dose will be recorded. Data will be reconciled with 
site accountability records to assess compliance.  
The study site staff are responsible for ensuring that participants comply w ith the allowed study 
visit windows. If a participant misses a visit, every effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_76870] a visit within the defined visit window specified in the SoE (Table  1, Table  2, and 
Table 3). If a participant does not complete a visit within the time window, that vi sit will be 
classified as a missed visit and the participant will continue with subsequent scheduled study visits. 
All safety requirements of the missed visit will be captured and included in the subsequent visit.

• All concomitant medications taken through 28  days after the IP injection. 
Antipyretics and a nalgesics taken prophylactically (ie, taken in the absence of any 
symptoms in anticipation of an injection reaction) will be recorded as such.  
• Systemic steroids (≥ 10  mg/day of prednisone or equivalent ), immunosuppressants, 
immune -modifying drugs, immunogl obulins, and/or blood products administered at 
any time during the study period after the IP injection.  
• Any concomitant medications relevant to or for the treatment of an SAE, AESI, or an 
MAAE from Day  1 through Day  181/EoS.  
• The participant will be asked i n the eDiary if they have taken any antipyretic or 
analgesic to treat or prevent fever or pain within 7  days after the study vaccination, 
including the day of injection. Reported antipyretic or analgesic medications should 
be recorded in the source documen t by [CONTACT_76871] (eg, telephone calls).  
Concomitant medications (including vaccinations) will be coded using the WHODrug Global.  
If a participant takes a prohibited dr ug therapy, the Investigator and the CRO’s medical monitor 
will make a joint decision about continuing or withholding the study vaccination of the participant 
based on the time the medication was administered, the drug’s pharmacology and 
pharmacokinetics, and whether use of the medication will compromise the participant’s safety or 
interpretation of the data. It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that details regarding the 
concomitant medications are adequately recorded in the eCRF.

If a pause is triggered in the study, each participant’s study site visits will continue until EoS. If a 
pause affects a participant’s vaccination visit, the window for that participant’s vaccination visit 
will be suspended until the pause is lifted and vaccination can resume. Once the pause is lifted, 
vaccination should be reinstated as soon as possible.  
If a participant is in the screening period for more tha n 28  days as the result of a pause, the 
participant may be rescreened for study eligibility (and will receive a new screening number) as

Abbreviations: AR = adverse reaction; SAE = serious adverse event.  
7.2. Criteria for Delay or Withholding of Study Vaccination  
Body temperature must be measured at the dosing visit before vaccine administration. The 
following events const itute criteria for delay of injection, and if either of these events occur at the 
time scheduled for dosing, the participant may be injected at a later date within the time window 
specified in the SoE ( Table  1, Table  2, and Table 3): 
• Acute moderate or severe infection with or without fever at the time of dosing.  
• Fever, defined as body temperature ≥  38.0°C (100.4°F) at the time of dosing.  
• Receipt of COVID -19 vaccination within 7 to 14 days of planned Day 1.  
Participants with a minor illness without fever, as assessed by [CONTACT_737], can be vaccinated. 
Participants with a fever ≥  38.0°C (100.4°F) will be contact[CONTACT_76873]. If the Investigator determines that the participant’s 
health on the day of dosing temporarily precludes injection, the visit should be rescheduled within 
the allowed interval for that visit.  
The Investigator, in consultation with the Sponsor’s medical monitor, may withhold the IP 
injection if the participant meets any of the following criteria:  
• Becomes pregnant.  
• Develops symptoms or conditions listed in the exclusion criteria.  
• Experiences a clinically significant change in clinical laboratory te st results, vital sign 
measurements, or general condition that, in the judgment of the Investigator, requires 
withholding of vaccine.

Protocol: mRNA -1010 -P101 Amendment  4 mRNA -1010  
 
Confidential  Page 88 The reason(s) for withholding the injection will be recorded in the eCRF.  
If a participant takes a prohibited drug therapy , the Investigator could delay the IP injection within 
the visit window or withhold the IP injection based on a joint decision of the Investigator and the 
CRO’s medical monitor ( Section  6.5.3 ). 
7.3. Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal From the Study  
Participants who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study will not be replaced unless otherwise 
stated in the protocol.  
A “withdrawal” from the study refe rs to a situation wherein a participant does not return for the 
final visit planned in the protocol.  
Participants can withdraw consent and withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, 
without prejudice to further treatment the participant may need to receive. The Investigator will 
request that the participant complete all study procedures pending at the time of withdrawal.  
If a participant desires to withdraw from the study because of an AE, the Investigator will attempt 
to obtain agreement to follo w-up with the participant until the event is considered resolved or 
stable and will then complete the EoS section of the eCRF.  
Information related to the withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF. The Investigator will 
document whether the decision to with draw a participant from the study was made by [CONTACT_76874], as well as which of the following possible reasons was 
responsible for withdrawal:  
• AE (specify)  
• SAE (specify)  
• Solicited AR or reactogenicity event (specify)  
• Death  
• Lost to  follow -up (LTFU)  
• Physician decision (specify)  
• Pregnancy  
• Protocol deviation  
• Study terminated by [CONTACT_2728]  
• Withdrawal of consent by [CONTACT_3445] (specify)  
• Other (specify)

Confidential  Page 89 Participants who are withdrawn from the study because of AEs (including SAEs, solicited ARs, 
or reactogenicity events) must be clearly distinguished from participants who are withdrawn for 
other reasons. Investigators will follow -up with participants who are withdrawn from the study as 
a result of an AE, SAE, solicited AR, or reactogenicity e vent until resolution of the event.  
A participant withdrawing from the study may request destruction of any samples taken and not 
tested, and the Investigator must document this in the site study records.  
If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure  of future information, the Sponsor may retain 
and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent ( Section  11.1.6 ). 
The Sp onsor will continue to retain and use all research results that have already been collected 
for the study evaluation, unless the participant has requested destruction of these samples. All 
biological samples that have already been collected may be retained  and analyzed at a later date 
(or as permitted by [CONTACT_427]).  
7.4. Lost to Follow -Up 
A participant  will be considered LTFU if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits 
without stating an intention to withdraw consent and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_9298]. 
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the study site for a required 
study visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_14315], counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the 
assigned visit schedule, and ascertain whether the  participant wishes to and/or should 
continue in the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed LTFU, the Investigator or designee must make every 
effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if 
necessary, a certified le tter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local 
equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_14386] (eg, dates of telephone calls and 
registered letters) should be documented in the participant’s medical record.  
• A participant who continues to be unre achable or continues to be noncompliant with 
study visits or procedures will be considered to have withdrawn from the study.  
• A participant should not be considered LTFU until due diligence has been completed.

Before performing any study procedures, all potential participants will sign an informed consent 
form (ICF; Section 11.1.6 ). Participants will unde rgo study procedures at the time points specified 
in the SoE ( Table  1, Table  2, and Table 3). A participant can also be seen for an unscheduled visit 
at any time during the study. Reasons for an unscheduled visit may include, but are not limited to, 
reactogenicity issues, symptoms of potential ILI, and/or COVID -19, or new or ongoing AEs. The 
site also has the discretion to make reminder telephone calls or send text messages to inform the 
participa nt about visits, review eDiary requirements, or follow -up on ongoing or outstanding 
issues.  
In accordance with “FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during 
COVID -19 Public Health Emergency” ( DHHS 2020 ), Investigators may convert study site visits 
to home visits or telemedicine visits with the approval of the Sponsor. Such action should be taken 
to protect the safety and well -being of participants and study site staff or to comply with state or 
municipal mandates.  
General considerations for study assessments and procedures include the following:  
• Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. The study procedures and their 
timing must be followed as presented in the SoE (Table  1, Table  2, and Table 3). 
Adherence to the study design requirements is essential and required for study 
conduct.  
• Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awarenes s to determine if the participant should continue participation 
in the study.  
• All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The Investigator will maintain a screening log 
to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record 
reasons for screening failure, as applicable.  
• The Screening Visit and Day 1 Visit cannot be completed on the same day for the 
Phase 1/2 part but may be completed on the same da y for the Phase 2 NH and Phase  2 
Extension parts. Additionally, the Screening Visit may be performed over multiple 
visits if within the 28 -day screening window.

• Solicited local and systemic ARs ( Section 8.4.3 ) that occur during the 7  days 
following vaccine administration (ie, the day of injection and 6  subsequent days). 
Solicited ARs will be recorded daily using eDiaries ( Section 8.1.1 ). 
• Unsolicited AEs observed or reported during the 28  days following vaccine 
administration (ie, the day of injection and 27 subsequent days). Unsolicited AEs are 
defined in Section  8.4.1 . 
• AEs leading to discontinuation from study participation from Day  1 through 
Day 181/EoS or withdrawal from the study.  
• MAAEs from Day 1 through Day 181/EoS or withdrawal from the study . 
• SAEs and AESIs from Day 1 through Day 181/EoS or withdrawal from the study.  
• Results of safety laboratory tests (Phase 1/2 only; Section 8.1.3 ).

through Day  181/EoS.  
Participants will be instructed on Day 1 on thermometer usage to measure bo dy temperature, ruler 
usage to measure injection site erythema and swelling/induration (hardness), and self -assessment 
for localized axillary swelling or tenderness on the same side as the injection arm.  
Participants will record data into the eDiary starti ng approximately [ADDRESS_83753] the following data in the eDiary:  
• Solicited local and systemic reactogenicity ARs, as define d in Section  8.4.3 , that 
occur on the day of IP administration and during the 7  days after the IP administration 
(ie, the day of injection and 6 su bsequent days). Any solicited AR that continues 
beyond Day  7 will be reported in the eDiary until it is no longer reported but only 
until 28 days after vaccination. Adverse reactions recorded in the eDiary beyond 
Day 7 should be reviewed by [CONTACT_76875].  
• Passive and active surveillance of ILI (Phase 2 NH part only; Section  8.1.6 ). 
Participants will record symptoms of ILI that they may experience anytime from 
Day 1 through Day  181/EoS as part of the passive ILI surveillance. For active ILI 
surveillance, participants will be instructed to report whether ILI symptoms ha ve been 
experienced, 3 to 4 times weekly from Day 1 through Day 29 and twice weekly from 
Day 30 through Day  181/EoS, via eDiary or telephone calls. If symptoms occur, 
participants will be directed to return to the study site as soon as possible, but no lat er 
than [ADDRESS_83754] the participant by [CONTACT_756] ( Section  8.1.6 ). 
• Daily oral body temperature measurement should be performed at approximately the 
same time each day using the thermometer provided by [CONTACT_3452]. If body 
temperature is taken more than once in a given day, only the highest temperature 
reading should be recorded.

• Any medications taken to treat or prevent pain or fever on the day of injection or for 
the next 6  days.  
The eDiary will be the only source docu ment allowed for solicited systemic or local ARs 
(including body temperature measurements). Participants will be instructed to complete eDiary 
entries daily. Quantitative temperature recordings and measurement of any injection site erythema 
or swelling/ind uration reported on the following day may be excluded from the analyses of 
solicited ARs.  
Study site staff will review eDiary data with participants at a visit 7  days after the injection.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Ancillary Supplies for Participant Use  
Study sites will distribute S ponsor -provided oral thermometers and rulers for use by [CONTACT_76876], for recording solicited ARs in eDiaries. 
Based on availability, smartphone devices may be provided to those participants who do  not have 
their own device to use for eDiary activities.  
8.1.2.  Safety Telephone Calls  
A safety telephone call is a telephone call made to the participant by [CONTACT_1146]. This 
call will follow a script, which will facilitate the collection of relevant safety information. Safety 
telephone calls follow a schedule for each participant, as shown in the SoE (Table  1, Table  2, and 
Table 3). The participant will be interviewed according to the script about occurrence of AEs, 
MAAEs, SAEs, AESIs, AEs leading to withdrawal from study participation, concomitant 
medications associate d with those events, and any nonstudy vaccinations ( Section 8.4.9 ). All 
safety information collected from the telephone contact [CONTACT_76877]. An unscheduled follow -up safety call may be triggered if an eDiary record results in 
identification of a relevant safety event.  
8.1.3.  Safety Laboratory Assessments  
In the Phase 1/2 part of the study, planned blood sampling for safety laboratory assessments will 
occur as indicated in the SoE ( Table  1). Tests will include WBC count, hemoglobin, platelets, 
ALT, AST, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and creatinine. Laboratory tests will be performed 
by [CONTACT_2237], unless otherwise specified.  
Pregnancy testing (applicable for all parts of the study) include the following:

Protocol: mRNA -1010 -P101 Amendment  4 mRNA -1010  
 
Confidential  Page 94 • A point -of-care urine pregnancy test will be performed at the Screening Visit and 
before the study vaccination on Day 1. At any time, a pregnancy test either via blood 
or point -of-care urine can be performed, at the discretion of the Investigator.  
• If not documented in a female participant’s medical records, an FSH test may be 
performed at the Screening Visit, as necessary and at the discretion of the 
Investigator, to confirm postmenopausal status.  
No scheduled safety laboratory assessments (except for pregnancy testing) will be conducted in 
the Phase  2 NH or Phase  2 Extension parts of the study.  
8.1.4.  Vital Sign Measurements  
Vital sign measurements will include systolic and diastolic BP, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and 
body temperature (preferred route is oral). The participant will be seated for at least 5  minutes 
before all measurements are taken. Vital signs will be measured at the time points indicated in the 
SoE (Table  1, Table  2, and Table 3). On the day of IP administration, vital sign measurements will 
be collected once before injection and approximately 1 hour after injection (before participants are 
discharged from the study site). Vital signs may be collected at other study visits in conjunction 
with a symptom -directed physical examination.  
If any of the vital sign measurements meet the toxicity grading criteria for clinical abnormalities 
of Grade  3 or greater, the abnormal value and grade will be doc umented in the AE section of the 
eCRF (unless there is another known cause of the abnormality that would result in an AE 
classification). The Investigator will continue to monitor the participant with additional 
assessments until the vital sign value has r eached the reference range, returns to the vital sign value 
at baseline, is considered stable, or until the Investigator determines that follow -up is no longer 
medically necessary.  
Febrile participants on the day of IP administration (fever is defined as a  body temperature 
≥ 38.0°C/100.4°F) may be rescheduled within the relevant window periods. Afebrile participants 
with minor illnesses may be injected at the discretion of the Investigator.  
When procedures overlap and are scheduled to occur at the same time  point, the order of 
procedures should be vital sign measurements and then blood collection.  
8.1.5.  Physical Examinations  
A full physical examination, including height and weight, will be performed at scheduled time 
points as indicated in the SoE (Table  1, Table  2, and Table 3). The full examination will include 
assessment of skin, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck, thyroid, lungs, heart, cardiovascular

significant finding identified during a study visit should be reported as an MAAE.  
Symptom -directed physical examinations may be performed at other time points at the discretion 
of the Investigator. On the day of vaccination, p rior to injection, both arms and associated lymph 
nodes should be examined, and any abnormalities should be documented . 
Body mass index will be calculated at the Screening Visit only.  
8.1.6.  Assessments for Respi[INVESTIGATOR_76817] -19 pandemic, participants may get infected with SARS -CoV -2 or 
experience symptoms consistent with ILI during the study.  
Phase 1/2  
All participants will provide NP swab samples before the injection on Day 1 for assessment of 
asymptomatic infection with respir atory pathogens, including influenza virus and SARS -CoV -2, 
as influenza or COVID -19 symptoms may confound reactogenicity assessment ( CDC  2020b ). 
A study site visit or a consultation will be arranged within [ADDRESS_83755] 
an NP swab sample if a participant experiences symptoms consistent with the CDC definition of 
ILI (see Section  8.4.6  for definition) and/or COVID -19 during the course of the study. The NP 
swab sample will be tested by [CONTACT_76878] -PCR for respi[INVESTIGATOR_13531], including influenza 
viruses and SARS -CoV -2. Add itionally, clinical information may be collected to evaluate the 
severity of the clinical case. All findings will be recorded in the eCRF.  
If scheduled, a study site illness visit may include additional assessments such as medical history, 
physical examina tion, and blood sampling for clinical laboratory testing. Radiologic imaging 
studies may be conducted. Blood samples will be collected for potential future immunologic 
assessment of influenza and/or SARS -CoV -2 infection.  
If participants are confirmed to ha ve SARS -CoV -2 infection during the study and are 
asymptomatic, the Investigator will notify the participant's primary care physician and local health 
authority, per local regulations. If the participant had known exposure to COVID -19 (eg, exposure 
to someo ne with a confirmed case of COVID -19) prior to Day 1, it will be captured on the 
COVID -[ADDRESS_83756] 
14 days.  
All cases of RT -PCR -confirmed ILI and/or COVID -19 should be captur ed as MAAEs (unless the 
definition for an SAE is met) along with relevant concomitant medications and details about 
severity, seriousness, and outcome.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  03 Feb 2022  
Protocol: mRNA -[ADDRESS_83757] protocol -defined ILI (see Section  8.4.6  for 
definition ) between Day  1 through Day  29 will be evaluated by [CONTACT_5203] -time RT -PCR testing of an 
NP specimen for influenza (and other respi[INVESTIGATOR_13531]).  
Both active and passive surveillance for ILI (see Section  8.4.6  for ILI definitions) will be 
conducted between Day 1 through Day  181/EoS. For active surveillance, participants will be 
instructed to report whether ILI symptoms have been experienced, 3 to 4 times weekly from Day  1 
through Day  29, and twice weekly from Day  30 through Day  181/EoS, via eDiary or telephone 
calls.  
If symptoms occur, participants will be directed to return to the study site as soon as possible, but 
no later than [ADDRESS_83758] the 
study participant by [CONTACT_756]. For passive surveillance, participants will be  instructed to report 
symptoms of ILI any time from Day  1 through Day  181/EoS.  
Participants who manifest protocol -defined ILI (see Section  8.4.6  for definition ) will have a study 
site visit or a consultation (unscheduled study visit) arranged within [ADDRESS_83759] an NP swab sample if participants experience symptoms consistent with the 
US CDC definition of ILI and/or C OVID -19 during the course of the study.  
Phase 2 Extension  
For the Phase  2 Extension part, a study site visit or a consultation (unscheduled study visit) will 
be arranged within [ADDRESS_83760] an NP swab sample if 
participan ts experience symptoms consistent with the US CDC definition of ILI and/or COVID -19 
during the course of the study.  
8.2. Immunogenicity Assessments  
Blood samples for immunogenicity assessments will be collected at the time points indicated in 
the SoE (Table  1, Table  2, and Table 3). The following assessments are planned:  
• Serum antibody level as measured by [CONTACT_14294] (primary, secondary, and 
exploratory endpoints).  
• Serum neutralizing antibody level as  measured by [CONTACT_76849] (secondary [Phase 1/2 part only] and exploratory endpoints).  
ModernaTX, Inc.  03 Feb 2022  
Protocol: mRNA -1010 -P101 Amendment  4 mRNA -1010  
 
Confidential  Page 97 • Cellular immunogenicity, in a subset of participants  (Phase 1/2 cohort only) , as 
assessed by [CONTACT_4133]/intracellular cytokine stainin g and/or enzyme -linked 
immune absorbent spot (exploratory endpoint).  
Sample aliquots will be designed to ensure that backup samples are available and that vial volumes 
are likely to be adequate for future testing needs. The actual time and date of each sam ple collected 
will be recorded in the eCRF, and unique sample identification will be utilized to maintain the 
blind at the laboratory at all times and to allow for automated sample tracking and housing. 
Handling and preparation of the samples for analysis,  as well as shippi[INVESTIGATOR_76818], 
will be provided in a separate study manual.  
Measurement of antibody levels will be performed in a laboratory designated by [CONTACT_1034].  
According to the ICF ( Section 11.1.6 ), serum from immunogenicity testing may be used for future 
research, which may be performed at the discretion of the Sponsor to further char acterize the 
immune response to influenza viruses, additional assay development, and the immune response 
across influenza viruses.  
The maximum amount of blood collected from each participant over the duration of the study, 
including any extra assessments t hat may be required, will not exceed blood limits specified by 
[CONTACT_427]. Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical 
issues with the samples. Further details are provided in both the ICF and Laboratory Reference 
Manual.  
8.3. Efficacy Assessments  
While the study will not be powered for efficacy assessments, ILI will be tracked as an exploratory 
objective in the Phase 1/2, Phase [ADDRESS_83761] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug/vaccine 
in humans, whe ther or not considered related to the drug/vaccine.

Protocol: mRNA -1010 -P101 Amendment  4 mRNA -1010  
 
Confidential  Page 98 Events Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition, including an increase 
in frequency and/or intensity of the condition, after the IP injection.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after the IP injection even though they may 
have been present before the start of the study.  
Events NOT Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
• Procedures planned before study entry (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_76819]).  
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that 
leads to the procedure should be the AE.  
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
An AR is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the vaccine caused the AE 
(Section  8.4.3 ). For the purposes of IND safety reporti ng, “reasonable possibility” means that there 
is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the vaccine and the AE.  
An unsolicited AE is any AE reported by [CONTACT_46354] a solicited AR in 
the protocol or is specified as a solicited AR but starts outside the protocol -defined period for 
reporting solicited ARs (ie, 7 days after vaccine administration).  
8.4.2.  Serious Adverse Events  
An AE (including an AR) is considered an SAE if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, 
it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
A death that occurs during the study or that comes to the attention of the Investigator 
during the protocol -defined follow -up period must be reported to the Sponsor, 
whether or not it is considered related t o the IP.  
• Is life -threatening  
An AE is considered life -threatening if, in the view of either the Investigator or the 
Sponsor, its occurrence places the participant at immediate risk of death. It does not 
include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe  form, might have caused death.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12993], inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_76820] 1 overnight stay for observati on and/or

setting. The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_76821]. 
Compl ications that occur during inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_76822]; 
however, if a complication/AE prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_76823], the complication/AE will be recorded as a separate SAE.  
• Persistent or significant incap acity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal  life functions  
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accide ntal trauma (eg, sprained ankle) that may interfere with or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Medically important event  
Medical judgment should be exercised in deciding whethe r SAE reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_76824] t 1 of the other 
outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered 
serious. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
8.4.3.  Solicited Adverse Reactions  
The term “reactogenicity” refers to the occurrence and intensity of selected signs and symptoms 
(ARs) occurring after the IP injection. The eDiary will solicit daily participant reporting of ARs 
using a structured checklist ( Section  8.1.1 ). Participants will record such occurrences in an eDiary 
on the day of injection and for the 6  days after the day of injection.  
Severity grading of reactogenicity will occur automatically based on participant entries into the 
eDiary according to the grading scales presented i n Table  13, which are modified from the toxicity 
grading scale for healthy adult and adolescent volunteers enrolled in preventive vaccine clinica l 
trials ( DHHS 2007b ). 
If a participant reported a solicited AR during the solicited period and did not record the event in 
the eDiary, the event should be recorded on the Reactogenicity page of the eCRF.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  03 Feb 2022  
Protocol: mRNA -1010 -P101 Amendment  4 mRNA -1010  
 
Confidential  Page 100 If the event starts du ring the solicited period, but continues beyond 7  days after dosing, the 
participant should notify the site to provide an end date to close out the event on the Reactogenicity 
page of the eCRF.  
If the participant reported an event after the solicited perio d (ie, after Day  7), it should be recorded 
as an AE on the AE page of the eCRF.  
All solicited ARs (local and systemic) will be considered causally related to study vaccination.

8.4.4.  Medically Attended Adverse Events  
An MAAE is an AE that leads to an unscheduled visit to an HCP. This would include visits to a 
study site for un scheduled assessments (eg, abnormal laboratory follow -up, and/or COVID -19

physician). Investigators will review unsolicited AEs for the occurrence of any MAAEs. 
Unsolicited AEs will be recorded in the AE section of the eCRF.  
All cases of RT -PCR -confirmed ILI and/or confirmed COVID -19 will be recorded as MAAE s. 
8.4.5.  Anaphylaxis  
All suspected cases of anaphylaxis should be recorded as MAAEs and reported as an SAE, based 
on the criteria for a medically important event, unless the event meets other serious criteria. As an 
SAE, the event should be reported to the Sponsor or designee immediately and in all circumstances 
within 24  hours, per Section  8.4.13 . The Investigator will submit any updated anaphylaxis case 
data to the Spo nsor within 24 hours of it being available. For reporting purposes, a participant who 
displays signs or symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis (as described below) should be reported 
as a potential case of anaphylaxis. This is provided as general guidance fo r Investigators and is 
based on the Brighton Collaboration case definition ( Rüggeberg et al 2007 ). 
Anaphylaxis is an acute hypersensitivity reaction with multi -organ system involvement that can 
present as, or rapi[INVESTIGATOR_76828] t o, a severe life -threatening reaction. It may occur following 
exposure to allergens from a variety of sources.  
Anaphylaxis is a clinical syndrome characterized by [CONTACT_716]:  
• Sudden onset AND  
• Rapid progression of signs and symptoms AND  
• Involves 2 or more organ systems, as follows:  
− Skin/mucosal:  urticaria (hives), generalized erythema, angioedema, generalized 
pruritus with skin rash, generalized prickle sensation, red and itchy eyes.  
− Cardiovascular:  measured hypotension, clinical diagnosis of uncompens ated shock, 
loss of consciousness or decreased level of consciousness, evidence of reduced 
peripheral circulation.  
− Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]:  bilateral wheeze (bronchospasm), difficulty breathing, stridor, upper 
airway swelling (lip, tongue, throat, uvula, or larynx), r espi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], persistent 
dry cough, hoarse voice, sensation of throat closure, sneezing, rhinorrhea.  
− Gastrointestinal:  diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.

An RT -PCR -confirmed ILI is defined as a positive influenza result by [CONTACT_937] -PCR done at any setting 
during the study period.  
8.4.7.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An AESI is an AE (serious or nonserious) of scientific and medical concern speci fic to the 
Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and immediate notification by [CONTACT_56864]. Such events may require further investigation to 
characterize and understand them.  
Adverse events of special i nterest for this protocol are listed in Appendix 3 ( Section  11.3). 
All AESIs will be collected through the entire study period and must be reported to the Sponsor or 
designee immediately and in all circumstances within 24  hours of becoming aware of the event via 
the electronic data capture (EDC) system. If a site receives a report of a new AESI from a 
participant or receives updated information on a p reviously reported AESI at a time after the eCRF 
has been taken offline, then the site can report this information on a paper AESI form using the 
SAE Mailbox.  
Myocarditis/Pericarditis  
A case of suspected, probable, or confirmed myocarditis, pericarditis, o r myopericarditis should 
be reported as an AESI, even if it does not meet criteria per the CDC case definition. The event

Confidential  Page 104 should also be reported as an SAE if it meets seriousness criteria ( Section 8.4.2 ). The CDC case 
definition is provided in Section  11.[ADDRESS_83765] at screening should not be enrolled; 
participants who have a positive pregnancy test at Day 1 should not receive the IP.  
Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the study vaccination on 
Day 1 and until the end of their participation in the study. If a pregnancy is reported, the 
Investigator should inform the Sponsor within 24  hours of learning of the pregnancy and should 
follow the procedures outlined in thi s section. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous 
abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs.  
Pregnancies occurring in participants after enrollment must be reported to Sponsor or designee 
within 2 4 hours of the site learning of its occurrence, using the SAE Mailbox, the SAE Hotline, or 
the SAE Fax line ( Section  8.4.13 ). If the participant a grees to submit this information, the 
pregnancy must be followed to determine the outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary 
termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital 
abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. This follow -up should occur even if 
intended duration of the safety follow -up for the study has ended. Pregnancy report forms will be 
distributed to the study site to be used for this purpose. The Investigator must immediately (withi n 
24 hours of awareness) report to the Sponsor any pregnancy resulting in an abnormal outcome 
according to the procedures described for SAEs.  
8.4.9.  Eliciting and Documenting Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs are re corded in the eCRF and 
reported to the Sponsor.  
Solicited ARs will be collected from Day 1 through 7 days after the vaccine dose. Other 
(unsolicited) AEs will be collected from Day 1 through 28 days after the vaccine dose.  
The MAAEs, SAEs, and AESIs will b e collected from participants as specified in the SoE (Table  1, 
Table  2, and Table 3) until the end of their participation in the study. Any AEs occurring before  
receipt of the IP will be analyzed separately from AEs.  
At every study site visit or telephone contact, participants will be asked a standard question to 
elicit any medically related changes in their well -being (including respi[INVESTIGATOR_76830]) according to the scripts provided. Participants will also be asked if they have been 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any accidents, used any new medications, changed concomitant medication 
regimens (both prescription and over -the-counter medications), or had any no nstudy vaccinations.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  03 Feb 2022  
Protocol: mRNA -1010 -P101 Amendment  4 mRNA -1010  
 
Confidential  Page 105 In addition to participant observations, physical examination findings and other documents 
relevant to participant safety classified as an AE will be documented in the AE section of the 
eCRF.  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Invest igator is required to proactively follow each participant 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All AEs and SAEs will be treated as medically appropriate and 
followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is LTFU 
(as defined in Section  7.4). 
8.4.10.  Assessment of Intensity  
An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described 
in the definition of an SAE ( Section  8.4.2 ), NOT when it is rated as severe.  
The severity (or intensity) of an AR or AE refers to the ext ent to which it affects the participant’s 
daily activities. The toxicity grading scale for healthy adult and adolescent volunteers enrolled in 
preventive vaccine clinical trials ( DHHS 2007b ) will be used to categorize local and  systemic 
reactogenicity events ( solicited ARs ), clinical laboratory test results, and vital sign measurements 
observed during this study. Specific criteria for local and systemic reactogenicity events are 
presented in Section  8.4.3 . 
The determination of severity for all unsolicited AEs should be made by [CONTACT_76880]:  
• Mild: These events do not inte rfere with the participant’s daily activities.  
• Moderate: These events cause some interference with the participant’s daily activities 
and require limited or no medical intervention.  
• Severe: These events prevent the participant’s daily activity and require intensive 
therapeutic intervention.  
Study staff should elicit from the participant the impact of AEs on the participant’s activities of 
daily living to assess severity and document appropriately in the participant’s source 
documentation. Changes in the sev erity of an AE should be documented in the participant’s source 
documentation to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of intensity to be 
performed. An AE characterized as intermittent requires documentation of onset and duration o f 
each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. An AE that fluctuates in severity during the course of the event is reported once in 
the eCRF at the highest severity observed . 
8.4.11.  Assessment of Causality  
The Investigator’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to the IP is part of the documenta tion process 
but is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  03 Feb 2022  
Protocol: mRNA -1010 -P101 Amendment  4 mRNA -1010  
 
Confidential  Page 106 The Investigator will assess causality (ie, whether there is a reasonable possibility that the IP 
caused the event) for all AEs and SAEs. The relationship will be char acterized using the following 
classification:  
• Not related:  There is not a reasonable possibility of a relationship to the IP. 
Participant did not receive the IP OR the temporal sequence of AE onset relative to 
administration of the IP is not reasonable OR the AE is more likely explained by 
[CONTACT_76881].  
• Related:  There is a reasonable possibility of a relationship to the IP. There is 
evidence of exposure to the IP. The temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to the 
administration of the IP is  reasonable. The AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_76882].  
8.4.12.  Reporting Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs that are observed or reported during the study 
regardless of their relationship to the IP or their clinical significance. If there is any doubt as to 
whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported.  
All unsolicited AEs reported or observed during the study will be recorded in the AE section of 
the eCRF. Information to be collected includes type of event, time of onset, Investigator -specified 
assessment of severity (impact on activities of daily living) and relationship to the IP, time of 
resolution of the event, seriousness, any required treatment or evaluations, and outcome. The 
unsolicited AEs resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent illnesses, reactions to 
concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must also be reported. All AEs will be 
followed until they are resolved or stable or judged by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator to be not clinically 
significant. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) will be used to code all 
unsolicited AEs.  
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened but does not 
deteriorate sh ould not be reported as an unsolicited AE. However, if it deteriorates at any time 
during the study, it should be recorded as an unsolicited AE.  
8.4.13.  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Prompt notification by [CONTACT_76883] a study 
intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
Any AE considered serious by [CONTACT_46350] ( Section  8.4.2 ) must be 
reported to the Sponsor immediately (within 24  hours of becoming aware of the SAE) via the EDC 
ModernaTX, Inc.  03 Feb 2022  
Protocol: mRNA -[ADDRESS_83766] (IRB) directly.  
If the eCRF is unavailable at the time of the SAE, the following contact [CONTACT_76884]:  
• SAE Mailbox:  
• SAE Hotline ([LOCATION_003]):  
• SAE Fax Line ([LOCATION_003]):  
Regulatory reporting requirements for SAEs are described in Section  8.4.[ADDRESS_83767]  
The following process for reporting an AESI ensures compliance with 21 CFR 312 and ICH GCP 
guidelines. After learning that a participant has experienced an AESI, the Investigator or designe e 
is responsible for reporting the AESI to the Sponsor, regardless of relationship or expectedness, 
within 24  hours of becoming aware of the event. If the AESI meets the criteria for an SAE, the 
SAE reporting procedure should be followed.  
8.4.15.  Time Period and F requency for Collecting Adverse Event and Serious Adverse 
Event Information  
Medical occurrences that begin before the start of IP administration but after obtaining informed 
consent will be recorded in the Medical History/Current Medical Conditions section  of the eCRF 
and not in the AE section; however, if the condition worsens at any time during the study, it will 
be recorded and reported as an AE.  
Adverse events may be collected as follows:  
• Observing the participant.  
• Receiving an unsolicited complaint fro m the participant.  
• Questioning the participant in an unbiased and nonleading manner.

Confidential  Page 108 Solicited ARs will be collected from the day of injection through 6  days after the injection. Other 
(unsolicited) AEs will be collected from the day of injection through [ADDRESS_83768] day of study 
participation.  
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor  or designee immediately and under no 
circumstance should this exceed 24 hours of becoming aware of the event via the EDC system. If 
a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data on a 
previously reported SAE and the  eCRF has been taken offline, then the site can report this 
information on a paper SAE form using the SAE Mailbox, the SAE Hotline, or the SAE Fax line 
(Section  8.4.13 ). 
An abnormal value or result from a clinical or laboratory evaluation can also indicate an AE if it 
is determined by [CONTACT_16426] (eg, meets any serious criteria). If this 
is the case, it must be reco rded in the source document and as an AE on the appropriate AE form(s). 
The evaluation that produced the value or result should be repeated until that value or result returns 
to normal or is stabilized and the participant’s safety is not at risk.  
Investiga tors are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs after EoS. However, if the 
Investigator learns of any SAE (including a death) at any time after a participant has withdrawn 
from or completed the study and the Investigator considers the event to be reaso nably related to 
the IP or study participation, the Investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor.  
Participants who develop ILI will be followed through 30 days from the onset of ILI even if Day  30 
is beyond Day 181/EoS.  
8.4.16.  Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Electronic diaries have specifically been designed for this study by [CONTACT_1034]. The diaries will 
include prelisted AEs (solicited ARs) and intensity scales; they will also include blank space for 
the recording of information on  other AEs (unsolicited AEs) and concomitant 
medications/vaccinations.  
The Investigator is responsible for the documentation of AEs regardless of the vaccination group 
or suspected causal relationship to the IP. For all AEs, the Investigator must pursue an d obtain 
information adequate to determine the outcome of the AE and to assess whether the AE meets the 
criteria for classification as an SAE, which requires immediate notification to the Sponsor or its 
designated representative.  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrences.

Confidential  Page 109 8.4.17.  Follow -Up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively follow each participant 
at subsequent visits and contacts.  
All AEs and SAEs will be treated as medically appropriate and followed until resolution, 
stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the particip ant is LTFU, as defined in Section  7.4. 
8.4.18.  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events  
Prompt notification by [CONTACT_76885] a study 
intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the sa fety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The 
Sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to 
the regulatory authority, IRBs, and Investigators.  
Investigator safety reports must be prepared  for suspected unexpected serious ARs according to 
local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to Investigators as necessary.  
An Investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific 
safety informati on (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will review and then file it 
along with the IB and will notify the IRB, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
8.5. Safety Monitoring  
The CRO’s medical monitor, the Sponsor’s medical monitor, and the  individual Site Investigators 
will monitor safety throughout the study. The roles of the IST and DSMB are outlined in 
Section  11.1.11 . 
8.6. Treatme nt of Overdose  
Because the IP is to be administered by [CONTACT_76886], it is unlikely that an overdose will occur. Dose 
deviations will be tracked as protocol deviations ( Section  11.1.8 ). 
8.7. Pharmacokinetics  
Pharmacokinetic parameters are not evaluated in this study . 
8.8. Pharmacodynamics

This section summarizes the planned statistical analysis strategy and procedures for the study. The 
details of statistical analysis will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be 
finalized before the clinical database lo ck for the study. If changes are made to primary and/or key 
secondary objectives or the related statistical methods after the study has begun but prior to any 
data unblinding, then the protocol will be amended (consistent with ICH Guideline E9). Changes 
to other secondary or exploratory analyses made after the protocol has been finalized, along with 
an explanation as to when and why they occurred, will be listed in the SAP or clinical study report 
(CSR) for the study. Ad hoc exploratory analyses, if any, wi ll be clearly identified in the CSR.  
9.1. Blinding and Responsibility for Analyses  
This is an observer -blind study. The Investigator, study staff, study participants, site monitors, and 
Sponsor personnel (or its designees) will be blinded to the IP administered  until the study database 
is locked and unblinded, with the following exceptions:  
• Unblinded personnel (of limited number) will be assigned to vaccine accountability 
procedures and will prepare the IP for all participants. These personnel will have no 
study  functions other than IP management, documentation, accountability, 
preparation, and administration. They will not be involved in participant evaluations 
and will not reveal the identity of the IP to either the participant or the blinded study 
site personn el involved in the conduct of the study unless this information is 
necessary in the case of an emergency.  
• Unblinded medically qualified study site personnel will administer the IP. They will 
not be involved in assessments of any study endpoints.  
• Unblinded site monitors, not involved in other aspects of monitoring, will be assigned 
as the IP accountability monitors. They will have responsibilities to ensure that sites 
are following all proper IP accountability, preparation, and administration procedures.  
• An independent unblinded statistical and programming team will perform the 
preplanned IA ( Section  9.6). Sponsor team members will be prespecified to be 
unblinded to the IA results and will not communicate the results to the blinded 
Investigators, study site staff, clinical monitors, or participants.  
• The DSMB will review the IA data to safeguard the interests of clinical study 
participants and to help ensu re the integrity of the study. The DSMB will review 
unblinded IA results provided by [CONTACT_76887]. The DSMB 
will also review unblinded statistical outputs for ad hoc safety reviews triggered by

DSMB and safety review.  
The dosing assignment will be concealed by [CONTACT_76888] a secure location that is not accessible or visible to other study staff. An opaque sleeve over 
the syringe used for injection will maintain the blind at the time of injection, as the doses containing 
mRNA -1010 will look different  from those of placebo/active comparator. Only delegated 
unblinded study site staff will conduct the injection procedure. Once the injection is completed, 
only the blinded study staff will perform further assessments and interact with the participants. 
Access to the randomization code will be strictly controlled at the pharmacy.  
9.1.1.  Breaking the Blind  
Except in the case of medical necessity, a participant’s vaccine assignment should not be unblinded 
without the approval of the Sponsor. If a participant becomes seriously ill or pregnant during the 
study, the blind will be broken only if knowledge of the vaccine assignment will affect that 
participant’s clinical management. In the event of a medical emergency requiring identification of 
individual vaccine assignme nt, the Investigator will make every attempt to contact [CONTACT_2024]’s 
medical monitor, preferably via electronic protocol inquiry platform, to explain the need for 
unblinding within 24 hours of opening the code. The Investigator will be responsible for 
documen ting the time, date, reason for unblinding, and the names of the personnel involved. The 
Investigator (or designee) will have access to unblind participants within interactive response 
technology (IRT). All unblinding instances will be tracked via an audit  trail in IRT and documented 
in the final study report.  
In addition to the aforementioned situations where the blind may be broken, the data will also be 
unblinded to a statistical team at specified time point(s) for analysis as outlined in Section 9.6. 
9.2. Statistical Hypotheses  
No formal hypotheses will be tested.  
9.3. Sample Size Determination  
The sample size for this study is not driven by [CONTACT_76889]. 
The number of proposed participants is considered sufficient to provide a descriptive summary of 
the safety and immunogenicity of different dose levels of mRNA -1010.  
Phase 1/2  
Approximately 180 participants will be randomly assigned in this part of the study, with 
approximately 45  participants in each vaccination group. Details regarding the number of 
participants in each vaccination group and the randomization ratio are presented in Section  6.2.1 .

The number and percentage of participants with seroconversion due to vaccination will 
be provided with 2 -sided 95% CI using the Clopper -Pearson method at Day 29. The 
seroconversion rate difference with 95% CI at Day 29 will be provided.  
In addition, the GMT of HAI titers with corresponding 95% CI will be provided at each time point. 
The 95% CI s will be calculated based on the t -distribution of the log -transformed values and then 
back transformed to the original scale. The GMFR of HAI titers with corresponding 95% CI at 
each postbaseline time point over baseline will be provided. Descriptive sum mary statistics, 
including median, minimum, and maximum, will also be provided.  
For summarizations of GMTs, antibody titers reported as LLOQ will be replaced by 0.5  × LLOQ. 
Values that are greater than ULOQ will be converted to the ULOQ.  
Rate of seroconver sion is defined as  (1) if LLOQ is 1:10 , the proportion of participants with either 
a prevaccination HAI titer < 1:10 and a postvaccination HAI titer ≥ 1:40 or a prevaccination HAI 
titer ≥ 1:10 and a minimum 4 -fold rise in the postvaccination HAI antibody t iter; or (2) if LLOQ 
is greater than 1:10, the proportion of participants with either a prevaccination HAI titer < LLOQ 
and a postvaccination HAI ≥ 4 times of LLOQ, or a prevaccination HAI ≥ LLOQ and a minimum 
4-fold rise in the postvaccination HAI .  
The HAI titers at Day 29, GMTr at Day 29, and the difference in seroconversion rate at Day  29 
may also be performed with the Full Analysis Set as supplementary analyses.  
Phase  2 Extension  
Immune responses, as measured by [CONTACT_56840] -1010 groups 
based on Day 29 HAI titers, will be compared with that of participants receiving active comparator 
for all 4 strains.

9.5.4.  Exploratory Analyses  
Exploratory analyses not addressed in Section  9.5.3  will be described in the SAP before database 
lock.  
9.5.5.  Subgroup Analyses  
The protocol does not define any formal subgroup analyses, and the study is not adequately 
powered to perform subgroup anal yses.  
9.6. Study Analyses  
A Day 29 IA is planned in this study for the Phase 1/2 , Phase 2 NH , and Phase  2 Extension parts 
separately . The IA for the Phase 1/[ADDRESS_83773] completed 
the Day  29 Visit. All relevant data to th e IA will be cleaned (ie, data that are as clean as possible).  
For the Phase 2 NH and Phase  2 Extension part s, an IA of safety ( reactogenicity  and 
immunogenicity as applicable) will be performed after participants have completed the Day  29 
Visit  for each  part of the study . All data relevant to the IA through the Day  29 Visit will be cleaned 
(ie, data that are as clean as possible). An interim study report may be generated, in which case a 
formal database lock will be performed to support the interim study  report.  
The IA will be performed by a separate team of unblinded programmers and statisticians. The 
analysis will be presented by [CONTACT_76855]. Except for a limited number of Sponsor and CRO 
personnel who will be unblinded to perform the IA, the stu dy site staff, Investigators, study 
monitors, and participants will remain blinded until after the final database lock for final analysis.  
The final analysis of safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity will be performed after all 
participants have comple ted all planned study procedures. The results of this analysis will be 
presented in a final CSR, including individual listings.  
Further details can be found in the SAP.

• Consensus ethical principles derived from international guidelines, including the 
Declaration of Helsinki and Council for International Organizations of Med ical 
Sciences International Ethical Guidelines.  
• Applicable ICH GCP guidelines.  
• Applicable laws and regulatory requirements.  
• The protocol, protocol amendments, ICF, IB, and other relevant documents 
(eg, advertisements) must be submitted to an IRB by [CONTACT_76892].  
• Any amendments to the protocol will require IRB approval before implementation of 
changes made to the study design, except for changes necessary to eliminate an 
immediate haza rd to study participants.  
• The Investigator will be responsible for the following:  
− Providing written summaries of the status of the study to the IRB annually or 
more frequently in accordance with the requirements, policies, and procedures 
established by [CONTACT_36985].  
− Notifying the IRB of SAEs or other significant safety findings as required by [CONTACT_27491].  
− Providing oversight of the conduct of the study at the site and adherence to 
requirements of 21 CFR, ICH GCP guidelines, the IRB, and all other applicable 
local regulations.  
11.1.2.  Study Monitoring  
Before an investigational study site can enter a participant into the study, the Sponsor or its 
representatives will visit the study site for the following:  
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities.  
• Discuss with the Inves tigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard 
to protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of the Sponsor or its representatives. 
This will be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between the Sponsor, the 
designated CRO, and the Investigator.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  03 Feb 2022  
Protocol: mRNA -[ADDRESS_83776] to protocol adherence and validity of data recorded on the eCRFs. 
The study monitor’s duties are to aid the Inve stigator and the Sponsor in the maintenance of 
complete, accurate, legible, well -organized, and easily retrievable data. The study monitor will 
advise the Investigator of the regulatory necessity for study -related monitoring, audits, IRB review, 
and inspec tion by [CONTACT_76893]/or documents. In addition, the 
study monitor will explain to and interpret for the Investigator all regulations applicable to the 
clinical evaluation of IP as documented in ICH guidelines.  
It is the st udy monitor’s responsibility to inspect the eCRFs and source documentation throughout 
the study to protect the rights of the participants; to verify adherence to the protocol; to verify 
completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data; and to confirm ad herence of study conduct 
to any local regulations. Details will be outlined in the clinical monitoring plan. During the study, 
a monitor from the Sponsor or a representative will have regular contacts with the study site, for 
the following purposes:  
• Provid e information and support to the Investigator(s).  
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable.  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that the data are 
being accurately recorded in the eCRFs, and that IP accountability checks are being 
performed.  
• Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the eCRFs 
with the participant’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_76831]. This will require direct access to all origin al records for each 
participant (eg, clinical charts or electronic medical record system).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent . 
• Confirm that AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on eCRFs, that any 
SAEs have been forwarded to  the SAE Hotline, and that those SAEs that meet criteria 
for reporting have been forwarded to the IRB.  
The monitor will be available between visits if the Investigator(s) or other staff needs information 
or advice.  
11.1.3.  Audits and Inspections  
The Sponsor, their  designee(s), the IRB, or regulatory authorities will be allowed to conduct site 
visits to the investigational facilities for the purpose of monitoring or inspecting any aspect of the 
study. The Investigator agrees to allow the Sponsor, their designee(s), the IRB, or regulatory

Confidential  Page 134 11.2. APPENDIX 2: Contraceptive Guidance  
Definitions: Woman of Childbearing Potential  
Females of childbearing potential are those who are considered fertile following menarche and 
until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile (as follows). If fertility is unclear (eg, 
amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot be confirmed before study 
vaccination, additional evaluation shou ld be considered.  
Females in the following categories are not considered females of childbearing potential:  
1. Premenarchal  
2. Premenopausal  surgically sterile female with 1 of the following:  
a. Documented complete hysterectomy  
b. Documented surgical sterilization  
For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the 
above (eg, Müllerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), Investigator’s discretion should be 
applied when determining study entry.  
Note: Documentation can come from the  site personnel’s review of the participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
3. Postmenopausal female  
• A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12  months without an alternative 
medical cause. The following age -specific requirements apply:  
− Females < [ADDRESS_83790] luteinizing hormone and FSH levels in the 
postm enopausal range for the institution.  
− Females ≥ [ADDRESS_83791] 
menses >  [ADDRESS_83792] menses 
> 1 year ago.  
• A high FSH level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women not using hormone replacement therapy (HRT).  
• Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use 1 of 
the nonestrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to 
ModernaTX, Inc.  03 Feb 2022  
Protocol: mRNA -[ADDRESS_83793] discontinue HRT to allow 
confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.  
Contraception Guidance:  
Adequa te female contraception is defined as consistent and correct use of an FDA -approved 
contraceptive method in accordance with the product label. The following are examples:  
• Barrier method (such as condoms, diaphragm, or cervical cap) used in conjunction 
with spermicide.  
• Intrauterine device.  
• Prescription hormonal contraceptive taken or administered via oral (pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]), transdermal 
(patch), subdermal, or IM route.  
• Sterilization of a female participant’s monogamous male partner prior to entry into 
the study.  
Note th at periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and 
withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

updated to include assessment of 
AESIs for the Phase  1/2 part.  
Section 9.6 (Study Analyses)  • Added text for the planned IA for the 
Phase 2 NH part of the study.  • For the Phase 2 NH part, an IA 
of safety (and immunogenicity as 
applicable) will be performed 
after participants have completed 
the Day  29 Visit. In addition, an 
interim study report may be 
generated, in which case a 
formal database lock will be 
performed to support the interim 
study report.

initial stage in the Phase 1/[ADDRESS_83801] 36 participants 
(9 participants per vaccin ation group) 
have completed their Day  8 Visit.  
• Clarified that vaccination of the 
remaining participants in the 
expansion stage will continue in each 
vaccination group if no pause rules 
have been met and the safety and 
tolerability are acceptable.  • Added tha t prior to the start of 
the Phase [ADDRESS_83802] a 
blinded review of available 
safety data from the Phase  1/2 
part of the study.

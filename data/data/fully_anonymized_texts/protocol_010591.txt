1.Synopsis
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading  cause  of death in the US.  Five modifiable risk 
factors: smoking,  hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035],  diabetes, hypertension and obesity,  account for 50% of CVD 
mortality between  the ages of 45 – 79.[ADDRESS_629931]  those 30 – 39 and again  
between 50 – [ADDRESS_629932]  yielded 
an overall relative risk (RR) of 1.5 for ischemic  heart disease.5  Young adults are at even higher 
relative risk (RR) higher risk, with a RR for myocardial infarction  of 3.[ADDRESS_629933] noted the increased risk of CVD  remains after adjustment  for these  traditional  CVD risk 
factors.6  
The mechanism(s) between psoriatic disease  and CVD  are still being  characterized.7  The systemic  
inflammation is linked to the production of numerous inflammatory cytokines such as interferon – γ, 
tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-[ADDRESS_629934] been  studies evaluating the effects of psoriatic specific treatment on endothelial 
dysfunction, there is a lack of evidence  on the use of medications  typi[INVESTIGATOR_489932].10  The goals of the proposed study are three fold:  
As a first step  to assess  endothelial  dysfunction, we will assess vascular function in psoriasis patients  
through non-invasive ultrasound imaging and through a novel technique:  direct analysis of 
endothelial cells with  minimally invasive endothelial vein  harvesting.13  As a second  goal, we will 
assess thrombotic risk through platelet activation and platelet – endothelial interaction.  Finally,  as a 
third goal,  we will assess  in patients with moderate  to severe psoriatic disease changes to the 
endothelial function and platelet activation  over time with the use of 81mg  of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34251]/or 40mg  
of atorvastatin.

Recruitment goals are listed  in the schedule of assessments  below.   Both female and males  will be 
recruited.  Patients  will be recruited from the outpatient general medicine, 
musculoskeletal/rheumatology and dermatology  clinics  at the NYU  Faculty  Group Practice (FGP) clinics 
including the Psoriasis,  psoriatic arthritis ambulatory  clinic, psoriasis and dermatology ambulatory care 
center and Bellevue Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489934].  We will also recruit from the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489935].  Patients fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria 
will be identified by [CONTACT_489955], who will obtain verbal consent for contact [CONTACT_3265] a 
member of the research  staff.  Study brochures will also be left at the front desk of these practices  in the 
even that subjects  would  like more information from study staff.   Patients will be approached after  their 
visit with the health care  provider in the clinic setting. Subjects and healthy  controls  will also be 
recruited from posted fliers across the medical center.  Additionally, subjects who have previously 
enrolled in any study  (10-[ZIP_CODE], S12-[ZIP_CODE], S14-[ZIP_CODE],  s14-[ZIP_CODE]) by [CONTACT_22888] - PI (Jeffrey  Berger) and 
who checked off the box that they may be contact[CONTACT_426] a member of the study staff for potential 
enrollment will be included.  
Additional recruitment will be done  through posted fliers and approved brochures at private 
dermatology offices  with dermatology office  staff  permission.  We will also recruit through social media 
postings including Craigslist, Facebook, psoriatic support groups and national  psoriatic society patient

advocacy groups as well the NYU approved research match  The advertisement for these postings  will 
contain the same content  as noted on the IRB approved  flyer.   This social  media  advertisement  will also 
includes the health-union psoriasis advocacy website.  
Working with  MCIT and DataCore we will be using Epic’s Reporting Workbench tool to identify potential 
subjects that have psoriasis and present to the dermatology FGP,  arthritis or phototherapy  clinics.  We 
will screen these subjects and then if they meet study inclusion criteria and has agreed to be contact[CONTACT_489956].  Contact [CONTACT_489957], MyChart, via Epic’s Research Recruitment functionality.  The  information used to send the 
MyChart message will be the same  as that used for other study advertisements.
Only subjects  that have  the capacity  to consent  will be asked to consent.

We will not be enrolling any vulnerable populations.
4.[ADDRESS_629936], and sample  storage.  Subjects will be given  a “Subject 
history form”  to fill out asking for a complete medical history. They  will also be given an appointment  
reminder sheet to bring with their consent form.   They will bring the subject history form to their first 
baseline assessment appointment.   Participants  will consent to complete the baseline assessments (see 
table 1).  Participants  may  opt to decline  participation  in any baseline assessment they feel 
uncomfortable with or time constraints do not allow.  Follow-up assessments will be completed in those 
who agree to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_489936].  Participation in 
follow-up assessment is not required for participation  in the baseline assessment.  The  consent  process 
will take  place  in private offices at the NYU  FGP,  CTSI, ambulatory care center, Seligman Center  for 
Advanced Therapeutics and Bellevue adult clinics.  Subjects will be given the opportunity to be 
contact[CONTACT_489958].  A member of the research  team  will 
conduct the baseline interview with the subject and review the clinical history, demographic  information 
and medication use with  the individual.   All information  including the consent will be kept under double  
lock and key at the PI’s office in NYU Skirball 9th floor.
4.[ADDRESS_629937] one baseline assessment is required  for all study participants where both a blood draw of 60ccs 
(for the use of platelet  function  testing,  biospecimen collection), non-invasive vascular function imaging 
testing and endothelial vein harvesting will occur (table 1).  A subject can choose not to participate in 
any baseline testing they feel uncomfortable with but must participate in one baseline assessment  to be 
included in the study.
Protocol version March  22nd 2018 V10 s17-[ZIP_CODE]  
4.5.2 Longitudinal component (Group 1 only)
After baseline assessment, those  with moderate to severe psoriatic disease will be offered by [CONTACT_489959][INVESTIGATOR_34251]/or 
atorvastatin.   For 2 weeks +/- 4 days, 1/4th  of the subjects enrolled will be offered 81mg of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248],  1/4th  
of the subjects  enrolled will be offered  atorvastatin 40mg, ¼ will be offered both aspi[INVESTIGATOR_489937] 1/4th will be offered nothing.  Participants will be given the opportunity to only 
participate in the baseline assessment and opt out of the opportunity to take aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34251]/or atorvastatin  
and longitudinal component.   
Both aspi[INVESTIGATOR_489938].  These medications are frequently used  in the psoriatic 
population based  on national guidelines when  a calculated cardiac risk score  is elevated  (considered at 
moderate to high risk of cardiovascular events).  These medications will be obtained  from the Tisch 
outpatient pharmacy.  They will be stored and dispensed with CTSI oversight.  A  drug accountability and 
storage log will be kept  as per NYU research  protocol.
A follow up assessment will be planed (table  1) at 2 weeks +/- 4 days  and will include  repeat blood draw  
(60 ccs, for the use of platelet function testing, biospecimen collection) and repeated  endothelial vein 
harvesting.  The end of the study is considered when the subject completes the follow up assessment.   
All study drugs  will be stopped at this time.  If the subject wishes to continue  the study drugs they will 
be referred  to their primary  medical provider  for further management.  
A subject will be able to opt out of any part of the follow up assessment they desire.    If a subject agrees 
to be started on aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34251]/or atorvastatin for the longitudinal part of the analysis  and therapy for 
psoriasis is planned by [CONTACT_489960], we will attempt to perform the longitudinal follow up 
prior to their starting  medication.  Participation in this study will not impact planned treatment of the 
subjects by [CONTACT_489961].     
All subjects may be asked to provide additional information about  their  medical history,  update  any 
interim history and provide  additional samples as noted above. Health information  will be monitored 
overtime by [CONTACT_78026]. Additional questions may be asked by [CONTACT_489962]-up, as appropriate.

4.5.3 Vascular  function assessment  
Vascular function may be assessed  either  using brachial artery flow  mediated  dilatation (FMD) or  pulse 
wave velocity (PWV), both non-invasive ultrasound  measures of vascular function.  FMD  and PWV will 
be measured  using a duplex ultrasound imaging  system (2D, grayscale B-mode imaging,  pulsed Doppler 
and color  flow Doppler) with a 11 MHz  linear array  probe (Sonosite Inc., Bothell WA).  Collection  of the 
ultrasound vascular function  data will occur in the Clinical Research  Center  of the NYU  Clinical  and 
Translational Science Institute (CTSI),  under the direction of [CONTACT_489982], who  is on this proposal.  
Before each study, participants  will provide answers  to a brief series of questions  to determine  eligibility 
for the FMD/PWV  measurements and to determine which arm to use. Participants will rest supi[INVESTIGATOR_290601] 20 minutes before measurements are made.  We will attempt to use the right  arm for imaging  
except in a few uncommon circumstances among patients eligible for this study  (recent injury with or 
without casting  on the right arm, right mastectomy with  lymph node removal, or any other condition 
that results in immobility, pain, and/or swelling in the right arm or hand).   The  participants will be 
positioned to maximize their  comfort and to facilitate  image acquisition by [CONTACT_489963].  A standard 
3-lead electrocardiogram will be placed on the torso (right upper torso, left upper torso, and left lower 
torso) as per protocol. Resting supi[INVESTIGATOR_489939].  
Mean blood flow velocity  (MBFV, cm/sec) will be determined by [CONTACT_489964]-
traced curve of the spectral display. Brachial artery diameter and MBFV will be measured at rest, and 
after transient arterial  occlusion induced  by [CONTACT_16131] a forearm  blood pressure cuff to suprasystolic 
pressure for 5 minutes.  MBFV will be measured  for 15 seconds immediately upon release  of the 
occluding cuff; the first 5 beats after release will be averaged.  Occlusion of brachial  artery blood flow 
for 5 minutes with suprasystolic pressures may  result in mild  hand numbness and discomfort that 
resolves quickly with decompression of the blood pressure cuff without any known  clinical sequelae.   
Brachial artery diameter  will be measured over a 1 cm vessel length at end-diastole 60-75 seconds 
following release  of the occluding cuff;  3 diameter measurements will be averaged. FMD will be 
calculated as the % change  in brachial artery diameter after cuff release  compared with the resting  
diameter. Internal and external landmarks  will be used to make repeated  measurements  at the same 
vessel site. In our laboratory, mean FMD  in normal adult subjects mean age 43 years is 5.89% (95% CI 
4.53%, 7.23%). Intraobserver coefficient of variance for FMD measurements of the same vessel is 1-2%.  
Within-subjects coefficient of variance  ranges from 5-10%  for same day measurements  (reliability  
coefficient for repeated  measures 72%) and 15-30% for day-to-day measurements (reliability coefficient 
for repeated  measures 46%).  Carotid-to-femoral  arterial pulse wave velocity as well as central arterial

after informed consent and completion of the screening interview.  If willing to the subjects  will be 
preferably fasting > 4 hours and water intake is allowed.  They will be in a reclined position  with feet 
elevated.  An angiocatheter ≤ 21 gauge will be inserted into a peripheral vein on the upper extremity 
using aseptic technique. A 0.021in. diameter  J-shaped wire (Daig, Minnetonka, MN) or a 0.018in.  
diameter J-shaped wire (Arrow, Reading, PA) will be then advanced into the angiocatheter, to a distance  
of 4cm beyond the end of the angiocatheter.  Angiocatheters and J shaped wire  described  above  are 
routinely used  for intravenous fluids and medication administration in this hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Venous endothelial 
cells will be scraped from the intimas of superficial forearm veins by [CONTACT_491] (3 times) insertion and 
removal of the wire. The distal portion of the wire will be transferred  to a 50ml conical tube containing 
dissociation buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin,  2 mM EDTA, and 100 microg/ml heparin in PBS,  pH 7.4) 
and maintained at 4°C until study.  Half of retrieved endothelial cells will be used for RNA extraction and 
a half for immunofluorescence.
The angiocatheter used will be a ≤ 21 gauge (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897]  20 gauge) INSYTE  autoguard  IV catheter  which  is 
routinely used  for clinical care, IV hydration and administration of medications.   In this case  we will using 
this angiocathter off label as a method to safety access the peripheral vein.   This poses  a non-significant  
risk for the device  according  to 21 CFR 812.3 (m) because:  1)  There is NO implantation of the device.   
2) This device will not be used to sustain human life and does not pose  a serious risk to health or safety 
of the subject.   3) This device will not be used to diagnose, cure, mitigate or treat  a disease.   4)  This 
angiocatheter device is routinely used across  the country in clinics and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489940] a 
serious risk to health, safety or welfare of the subject. 
The J – wire used  will be either a  0.021in.  diameter J-shaped wire (Daig, Minnetonka, MN) or a 0.018in.  
diameter J-shaped wire (Arrow, Reading, PA).  This device will be used off label as a means of accessing 
and collected endothelial cells.  In  clinical  practice  these  devices are typi[INVESTIGATOR_489941] 
a guidewire for accessing human  veins  and threading  other catheters into the vein.   These wires  
therefore routinely come into contact  [CONTACT_489965].  HOWEVER, our use is to harvest 
endothelial cells that come into contact  [CONTACT_489966].  Therefore, this is considered  off label.  This 
poses a non-significant risk for the device according to 21 CFR 812.3 (m) because:  1)  There is NO 
implantation of the device.   2) This device will not be used to sustain human life and does  not pose  a 
serious risk to health or safety of the subject.   3) This device will not be used  to diagnose, cure, mitigate 
Protocol version March  22nd 2018 V10 s17-[ZIP_CODE]  
or treat a disease.   4)  This j-wire device  is routinely used across the country in clinics  and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489942] a serious risk to health, safety or welfare of the subject.  
   
 
4.5.[ADDRESS_629939] techniques of blood drawing will 
be used  as follows.  After cleansing of the venipuncture site with  an alcohol  wipe  and removal of excess 
alcohol with  sterile gauze,  a tourniquet will be applied to the patient’s bicep region.  A 20G butterfly 
needle or less will be inserted into the antecubital  vein,  the tourniquet will be removed, and free-
flowing blood  will be collected with minimal trauma and stasis.  The needle will be removed when blood 
collection is complete and sufficient pressure  will be applied using sterile gauze at the puncture  site until 
cessation of bleeding.  A sterile  band-aid will be applied to cover the venipuncture site.  .  
For each patient, no more than  60 ml (≈4 tablespoons and 1/[ADDRESS_629940] blood donation) of blood 
will be collected at the baseline visit in red (no anticoagulant) top, lavender (EDTA anticoagulant)  top, 
green (heparin) and blue (sodium citrate  anticoagulant) top tubes).  We believe this amount of blood  is 
negligible and presents  minimal  risk for the patient.  Approximately 30 cc of blood will be used  for the 
different measurements of platelet function, lipid levels, coagulation, inflammation, and approximately 
30 cc of blood  will be used for isolation of RNA, microRNA and storage  of DNA at -80C.  . The samples will 
be stored in the PI’s lab at the NYU Science building  7th floor without any identifying information other 
than a code number.  These samples will be barcoded system and lab vantage and stored in a freezer 
with back-up power supply.   
4.5.6 Longitudinal Follow  Up Data Collection
Participants enrolled in the longitudinal part of this study will be offered the option  to participate in 
follow-up biospecimen collection.  This  follow-up will allow us to assess  how aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34251]/or  atorvastatin  
affect platelet  and endothelial function and inflammation.  This  follow-up  component  will consist  of 
additional blood samples of ≈ 30ml  (2 tablespoons or less) that will be collected  for different 
measurements of platelet  function, lipid levels, coagulation, inflammation, and approximately 30 ccs of 
blood will be used for isolation  of RNA, microRNA and storage of DNA at -80C.  The samples will be 
stored in the PI’s lab at the NYU Science building 7th floorwithout any identifying information other than 
a code number.   Repeat endothelial vein harvesting will also be performed as described  above.  
Overall, code  numbers  used for collection  of samples will not be based on any information that could be 
used to identify the subject  (for example, social security  number, initials or birth date).  The master  list 
linking names to code numbers will be kept in a locked file cabinet, separate  from all research 
information.  
Protocol version March  22nd 2018 V10 s17-[ZIP_CODE]  
If participating in the optional follow-up collection, the total amount of blood  withdrawn (baseline plus 
follow up) will be no more  than 120 ml (approximately 7 tablespoons and 1/[ADDRESS_629941]  blood 
donation).  This amount of blood  collection is within established safety guidelines of research  blood 
collection in adults.  Blood collection at baseline and at the follow up time points will allow us to 
examine how the treatment of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_489943] 1) endothelial vein function in psoriatic 
disease, 2) changes to platelet  activity and 3) alterations in coagulation  and inflammation in those  with  
psoriatic disease. 
For all cases and controls, we will call 1 week after each procedure to assess  how patients are feeling 
after endothelial vein  harvesting.   Adverse events will be managed as mentioned below.
4.5.7 Genetic Profiling
The blood and endothelial specimens will be analyzed upon completion of the study  for RNA, microRNA, 
and DNA profiling.  We will perform detailed molecular profile study,  describing  genetic  arrays of 
patterns of platelet and endothelial  vein analysis associated with atherosclerotic heart  disease and 
psoriasis.  We  will be looking at specific transcripts in various cell types  and endothelial cells  associated 
with cardiovascular diseases.  Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) will be isolated for platelet purification and 
subsequent genetic  analysis  will be performed.  The samples will be stored in dedicated freezer space in 
the Marc and Ruti Bell Program for Vascular Biology (the NYU Science building 7th floor) for the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_489944] a unique code number.   The  code number  will not be 
based on any information that could be used to identify the subject (for example, social security 
number, initials, birth date,  etc.).  The  master list linking names to code numbers will be kept in a locked 
file cabinet,  separate  from all research information.  Genetic information will not be disclosed to 
anyone, including the participants  and their  physicians. Samples shall  be destroyed at the end of the 
testing process.    
4.[ADDRESS_629942]  their blood stored for future processing.  If patient does 
not agree  to store his/her  blood for future tests not related  to this study, then his/her blood will be 
destroyed after all planned laboratory  tests  have been  performed.   
Blood samples  for future  analysis will be assigned a unique code  number  and stored in the dedicated 
freezer storage by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_489945] a code number. The unique  
code number will not be based on any information that could be used to identify  the subject (for 
example, social security number, initials, or birth date).  The master list linking names  to code  numbers  
will be kept  in a locked file cabinet, separate from all research information placed under double  lock and 
key at PI’s office. All confidential data will be stored with a unique code  as an identifier  and will be 
protected by a double electronic lock.  All physical data will be kept under double  physical lock.  Access  
to the data  will be given  to the study personnel only.  
Protocol version March  22nd 2018 V10 s17-[ZIP_CODE]  
Samples will be stored for no more than  10 years.  The specimens for future analysis  may be analyzed 
upon completion of the study for RNA, microRNA,  and DNA as described  above.  Genetic information will 
not be disclosed to anyone, including the participants.  Samples could also be used  for testing other 
potential biomarkers in patient  plasma and/or  serum related to psoriatic  disease and CVD that may 
occur with exception of those which  are already part of the protocol.  Results of the future  research  will 
not be shared with the subjects or their  study doctor, and will not become part of the medical records. 
In the future,  other institutions or future collaborators at or outside of NYU Medical Center may want to 
study a portion  of these  samples,  too. If that happens,  samples would be sent to other places so other  
people interested  in studying these diseases and conditions could do that. The samples  sent  to other 
researchers will be de-identified without  PHI. Samples will be stored for no more than [ADDRESS_629943] may not withdraw his/her Authorization for uses  or disclosures that have  previously been made 
or must continue  to complete analyses or report data from the research. 
5.RISKS
The potential  risks of phlebotomy are pain, bruising, fainting, or small  infection at puncture site.   The 
procedure to perform endothelial vein  harvesting is identically to the placement  of an IV and routine 
phlebotomy blood draw.  These risks  are pain, bruising, fainting or small  infection at the puncture  site.  
Sterile gloves and sterile  wires are used  to harvest the endothelial cells.  The  wires  are advanced < [ADDRESS_629944] cohort.  
Regarding non-invasive imaging of vascular function,  there are no known risks associated with  taking  
ultrasound pi[INVESTIGATOR_499].  The cuff on the forearm  and the “pi[INVESTIGATOR_5625]” sensation may be 
uncomfortable for participants. At their request, the cuff will be deflated and any discomfort should 
disappear within a few seconds. There are no known risks to the arterial tonometry measurements.   
Protocol version March  22nd 2018 V10 s17-[ZIP_CODE]  
Treatment risks:
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_489946].  
Nevertheless, there are risks associated with being on aspi[INVESTIGATOR_87458] [ADDRESS_629945] clinically effective dose (81mg) and for a very short period of time. 
There is also a risk of being on 40mg of atorvastatin.  There  are known side effects to short term therapy  
which includes  hepatotoxicity,  myositis,  muscle soreness,  stomach irritation and interaction with other 
medications (such  as antifungals) and foods  (such  as grapefruit).   We are using a statin (40mg of 
atorvastatin) which has been widely studied  with a low rate of interactions, hepatotoxicity and incidence 
of myositis. 
Genetic risks:
Genetic testing can generate  information about a subjects’ personal health risks  and can cause or 
increase anxiety, damage  family relationships, and/or compromise insurability, employability and can 
even lead  to discrimination.   In general, results from studies  that use data collected  as part of this 
research will be preliminary, and the clinical implications of any findings may not be understood  for 
years. Therefore, individual study results will not be shared with participants or their physicians.  
Potential loss of confidentiality: Confidentiality  will be preserved to the fullest extent by [CONTACT_489967]’t be guaranteed.  All data will be stored with a unique code  that 
does not identify  the participant.  Furthermore,  data will be saved using  a double  electronic lock.  All 
physical data  will also be kept under double  physical  lock.  Access to the data  will be given to the study 
personnel only thereby [CONTACT_489968], such as risk for employability or insurability or the risk of 
discrimination.
6. BENEFITS
The proposed study will examine the relationships between  psoriatic disease,  endothelial and vascular 
function and markers of thrombotic and CVD  risk.  Further, we will examine  how  treatment with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34311]/or statin will improve  markers of inflammation and vascular function in those  with psoriatic disease.  
The long-term goal is to develop a better  understanding of the role endothelial function and thrombotic 
risk in those  with psoriatic disease.  Furthermore we hope to understand the use of accepted  primary  
prevention CVD medications  in those  that show an elevated risk of CVD through chronic inflammation.  
This will lead  to improved personalized medicine.  There may be no direct benefit  to enrolled  subjects.
Protocol version March  22nd [ADDRESS_629946] benefit expected from the participation  
in this study.   This study may provide valuable  information to medical/cardiovascular physician  
scientist’s with minimal risk to study subjects.  It  is hoped that knowledge gained will be of benefit  to 
others in the future. 
8. Reimbursement:
Both control subjects and psoriasis subjects may be reimbursed up to [ADDRESS_629947] publication of this endothelial vein harvesting technique comparing subjects with and 
without severe decompensated heart failure, an n = [ADDRESS_629948] shown upwards 
of a 35% difference  in measurements of endothelial dysfunction between those  with  psoriasis and 
healthy controls.16  
Specific Power Analysis:
Based on the above  study  evaluating endothelial dysfunction in psoriatic patients,  we have a power  > 
80% with  an alpha level of 0.[ADDRESS_629949] a 35%  difference using  non-invasive  vascular imaging  in those 
with psoriatic disease compared to healthy controls with a goal n = 40 for the psoriatic group and n = 10 
for the control  group  (G*Power [IP_ADDRESS]).  We do not have comparable data on the use of endothelial 
harvesting techniques to compare psoriatic disease to healthy controls.  In previous studies using  
endothelial harvesting to study heart failure, staining for NF-kB (non-specific marker of inflammation 
and endothelial dysfunction) yielded a 16% difference between groups, a narrow standard deviation 
with an effect  size d of 1.2.  Extrapolating this measurement with an n = 40 for psoriatic disease and n = 
10 for controls  gives us > 90%  power to detect baseline endothelial  function differences between groups 
with an alpha  level of 0.05 (G*Power [IP_ADDRESS]).  For the longitudinal component assessing endothelial 
function with endothelial vein harvesting and staining for NF-kB, n = [ADDRESS_629950]  
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]/atorvastatin and assuming an effect size d of 0.817, we would  have  a 74% power with an alpha 
level of 0.[ADDRESS_629951] a difference between groups (G*Power [IP_ADDRESS]).   We believe given the pi[INVESTIGATOR_489947], the sample sizes are adequate to detect both cross sectional and longitudinal  
trends which would then  allow for further study  proposals.    
 
10. DATA ANALYSIS
All eligible subjects will be assigned a unique identification number  upon enrollment  in the study.   Initial 
study data will be recorded on a printed form, which will be later converted to electronic database  
(Redcap).  All potential  identifiers will be kept separately  in a safe location by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a locked file 
cabinet in a locked  room.  After verification of entered data  at completion of the study  all potential 
identifiers will be stripped  from  the database.
Protocol version March  22nd [ADDRESS_629952] into the model. Additional multivariable adjustment for other relevant  covariates  (e.g., body mass  
index, hypertension, renal  function, LDL cholesterol) will then be performed.
A similar analysis plan will be undertaken for central pulse pressure (CPP) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) 
which will be modeled  as continuous variables  in all analyses.  Multiple linear regression will be used to 
estimate the difference in CPP and PWV between those  with psoriasis and age and sex matched  
controls.  Conventional  adjustment for age and sex will be entered first into the model. Additional 
multivariable adjustment for other  relevant  covariates (e.g.,  body  mass index, hypertension, renal 
function, and LDL cholesterol) will then  be performed.
 
 For endothelial vein analysis quantitative Immunofluorescence will be performed. The human  
endothelial cells will be identified by [CONTACT_489969]  
(Abcam), followed by [CONTACT_489970]-conjugated donkey antirabbit antibodies (Jackson 
ImmunoResearch Laboratories) preconjugated with Streptavidin oregon green (Molecular Probes). 
Nuclear NFkB (fluorescence intensity) and expression of MCP-1,  ICAM-1,  VCAM-1, iNOS, COX-2, eNOS,  P-
eNOS will be assed.   Negative  control slides will be generated by [CONTACT_489971] (Sigma  
Chemical) as primary antibodies. Immunofluorescence  analysis will be performed in a blinded  fashion by 
[CONTACT_489972]. Staining will be visualized  with ultraviolet light under a fluorescent 
microscope (Nikon  ECLIPSE E600, Melville, NY) using a COHU charge coupled device  camera  (Danville, 
CA). Image processing will be performed by [CONTACT_489973] µm2. 
Slides will be systematically read left to right  and top to bottom. Only  cells with both cellular and nuclear 
integrity will be analyzed.  Cellular and nuclear integrity will be assessed morphologically. Intact cells  will 
be defined as those  with  continuous, unbroken cell membrane delineated by [CONTACT_489974],  as 
analyzed by [CONTACT_489975].  Intact  nuclei will be defined as well-circumscribed  oval bodies as 
delineated by [CONTACT_31121] [INVESTIGATOR_23053]. 
Additionally, real-time quantitative RT-PCR will be performed. One microgram of total  RNA  will be 
reverse-transcribed to cDNA with Superscript II reverse transcriptase and poly  dT priming  according to 
the manufacturer's instruction (Life Technologies). Real-time quantitative PCRs will be performed with a 
LightCycler thermal cycler (Idaho Technology, Salt Lake City, UT) as previously described.40 We will assess  
mRNA  expression of MCP-1, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, iNOS, COX-2, eNOS (fold change over healthy controls).  
Untargeted RNA-sequencing  will also be performed  for untargeted analysis to identify novel markers of 
psoriatic disease and activity. 
b.Aim 2
Protocol version March  22nd 2018 V10 s17-[ZIP_CODE]  
We will evaluate the association  between  moderate to severe psoriatic disease and measures of 
thrombotic risk.  As in Aim1, linear and nonlinear regression models will be employed to investigate the 
difference in platelet activity  between  those with and without  psoriasis.   This is gauged by [CONTACT_489976]  (MPA) and assessing monocyte – platelet interaction after adjusting for other covariates 
and applying model selection procedures.  We will collect data  including  maximal aggregation (%), slope 
of the aggregation curve,  and elapsed time  between addition of agonist and onset  of aggregation (lag 
phase). Regression models will unveil how these characteristics are influenced by [CONTACT_489977], adjusting for other covariates.
c.Aim [ADDRESS_629953] vascular function  and thrombotic risk in those  with moderate to severe psoriatic disease. We will 
assess baseline endothelial vein transcriptome  data, genetic expression for routine  markers of 
endothelial activation such as VCAM-1, ICAM-1, NF-kB  and platelet reactivity data.  Using paired t- tests, 
we will assess the changes to platelet reactivity  and endothelial  function  with the use of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248],  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_489948].  
11. Safety and Adverse  Events
11.1 Definitions
Unanticipated Problems Involving  Risk to Subjects  or Others
Any incident, experience,  or outcome that meets all of the following  criteria: 
Unexpected in nature,  severity, or frequency  (i.e. not described in study-related documents such 
as the IRB-approved  protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure,  etc)
Related  or possibly related  to participation  in the research (i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility  that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156])
Suggests  that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic,  or social harm).
Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity  
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent  illnesses or injuries will be regarded as adverse  events.  
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures  are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:
Protocol version March  22nd 2018 V10 s17-[ZIP_CODE]  
results in study withdrawal
is associated  with a serious  adverse event
is associated  with clinical signs or symptoms
leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic  tests
is considered by [CONTACT_489978]-serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is: 
fatal
life-threatening
requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]
results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity
a congenital anomaly or birth defect
an important medical event
Important medical  events are those that may not be immediately  life threatening,  but are clearly of 
major clinical  significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may  require intervention to prevent  
one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example,  drug overdose  or abuse, a seizure that 
did not result  in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency 
department would typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355]. 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious will be regarded as non-serious 
adverse events. 
Adverse Event Reporting Period
The study period during which adverse events will be reported is the period from the initiation of any 
study procedures to the end of the study treatment follow-up.  For this study, the study  treatment 
follow-up is defined as [ADDRESS_629954] administration of study treatment.  
Preexisting Condition
A preexisting  condition  is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting  condition  will be 
recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens 
during the study period.
General Physical Examination  Findings
At screening, any clinically  significant  abnormality  will be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the end 
of the study,  any new  clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse 
event will be recorded and documented as an adverse event. 
Post-study Adverse Event
Protocol version March  22nd [ADDRESS_629955]  to report any subsequent event(s)  that the subject, or the 
subject’s personal physician, believes  might reasonably be related to participation in this study.  The 
investigator will notify the IRB of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a subject has 
discontinued or terminated study participation that may  reasonably be related to this study.  
Abnormal Laboratory Values
A clinical laboratory abnormality will be documented as an adverse event if any one of the following 
conditions is met: 
The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm  the abnormality
The abnormality  suggests a disease and/or  organ toxicity
The abnormality  is of a degree that requires  active management; e.g. change of dose,  
discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow-up  assessments, further diagnostic 
investigation, etc.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489949] a serious adverse event  unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any  
condition responsible for surgery should  be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the 
criteria for and adverse event. 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  nor surgery are reported as an adverse 
event in the following  circumstances:
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489950] a 
preexisting condition.   Surgery  will not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the 
purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489951].
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489952], unless  
it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28690].
11.[ADDRESS_629956], the investigator  will seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_28812], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].   Information on all adverse events will be recorded 
immediately in the source  document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case  
report form  (CRF).  All clearly related signs,  symptoms,  and abnormal  diagnostic procedures results 
should recorded  in the source document, though should  be grouped under one diagnosis.
Protocol version March  22nd [ADDRESS_629957] be reported are those  that are:

initiated. Any protocol deviations initiated without  Sponsor and the investigator’s  IRB approval  
that may affect the scientific soundness of the study, or affect the rights, safety, or welfare of 
study subjects, must be reported to the Sponsor  and to the investigator’s IRB as soon  as a 
possible, but no later than 5 working  days  of the protocol deviation.
Withdrawal  of IRB approval
An investigator shall report to the sponsor a withdrawal of approval by [CONTACT_093]’s  
reviewing IRB as soon as a possible, but no later than  5 working days of the IRB notification  of 
withdrawal of approval.
11.3.2  Investigator reporting: notifying the IRB
Federal regulations require timely  reporting  by [CONTACT_489979].  The following  describes the NYULMC IRB reporting requirements, 
though Investigators  at participating sites are responsible  for meeting the specific requirements of their 
IRB of record. 
Report Promptly, but no later  than  5 working days:
Researchers are required  to submit reports of the following problems promptly but no later than 5 
working days  from the time the investigator becomes aware  of the event:
Unanticipated problems including adverse events  that are unexpected and related
–Unexpected : An event is “unexpected” when  its specificity and severity are not accurately 
reflected in the protocol-related  documents, such as the IRB-approved  research protocol,  any 
applicable investigator  brochure, and the current IRB-approved informed consent document  
and other relevant sources  of information, such as product labeling and package inserts.  
–Related to the research procedures : An event is related to the research  procedures if in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_28692], the event was more likely than  not to be caused 
by [CONTACT_28821]. 
–Harmful: either caused harm to subjects  or others, or placed them at increased risk
Other Reportable events:
The following  events  also require prompt reporting  to the IRB, though no later than  5 working days:
Complaint of a research subject when  the complaint indicates unexpected risks  or the complaint 
cannot be resolved  by [CONTACT_5051].
Protocol deviations or violations (includes intentional  and accidental/unintentional  deviations  
from the IRB approved protocol)  for any of the following situations: 
–one or more participants were placed at increased risk of harm 
Protocol version March  22nd 2018 V10 s17-[ZIP_CODE]  
–the event  has the potential to occur again
–the deviation  was necessary to protect a subject from immediate harm
Breach  of confidentiality
Incarceration of a participant when the research was not previously approved under Subpart C 
and the investigator believes  it is in the best interest of the subject to remain on the study.
New  Information  indicating a change to the risks or potential benefits of the research, in terms 
of severity or frequency. (e.g.  analysis  indicates  lower-than-expected response  rate or a more 
severe or frequent  side effect;  Other  research finds arm of study has no therapeutic  value;  FDA 
labeling change or withdrawal from market)
Reporting Process
The reportable events noted above will be reported  to the IRB using  the form:  “Reportable Event Form” 
or as a written  report  of the event (including a description of the event with information regarding its 
fulfillment of the above criteria,  follow-up/resolution  and need for revision to consent form and/or 
other study documentation).

12.  Data Handling  and Record  Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]
12.[ADDRESS_629961] of 1996 (HIPAA).   We are providing a consent 
form informing the subject of the following: 
What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study
oName, date of birth, MRN
Who will have access to that information and why
oOnly IRB approved  study investigators.  Statisticians will have access  to de-identified 
datasets.
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], 
retains the ability  to use all information collected  prior to the revocation  of subject authorization.  For 
subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts  will be made to obtain 
permission to collect at least vital  status  (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study  
period.
Source Documents
Source documents will be stored for a minimum  of 2 years after  study completion.  Source data is all 
information, original records of clinical  findings, observations, or other activities  in a clinical trial 
necessary for the reconstruction  and evaluation of the trial.   Source  data  are contained in source

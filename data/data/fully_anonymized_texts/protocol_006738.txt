A.SPECIFIC  AIMS 
Aim 1: Quantify the effects of treatment on post -stroke depression.   
Aim 2: Determine if depression influences response to locomotor rehabilitation.  
B.BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
Depression is the most common neuropsychiatric  manifestation following stroke.1  With a prevalence of 
~30%, post -stroke depression (PSD) affects ~[ADDRESS_727243], we will assess the effects of aerobic exercise training (AET), repetitive transcranial 
magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or their combination on depressive severity as well as locomotor function in 
persons with PSD. Both AET and rTMS are established stand- alone treatments for non -stroke related 
depression, though neither has been adequately studied post -stroke. Furthermore, substantive research 
indicates that AET improves post -stroke locomotor function, thus offering a novel approach for treating 
PSD as well as an established vehicle to study the effects of PSD on response to rehabilitation.  
Significance  
Post -stroke depression is common and treatment options are inadequate.  
Post-stroke depression (PSD)  is the most common neuropsychiatric consequence of stroke.  Four out of 
five individuals develop major depressive disorder (MDD) within seven years of stroke onset and point 
prevalence estimates for PSD are ~30 -40%.3 Thus, more than 2 million individuals with PSD are presently 
living in the U.S. Current pharmacological treatments for depression in older individuals are generally 
ineffective (65 -75% will not achieve remission) and often come at the cost of signifi cant side effects (e.g. 
seizure, delirium and falls).2 Concerns for these effects combined with disagreement about the underlying 
mechanisms as well as issues related to poly -pharmacy highlight the need for alternative (non- drug) 
treatments  with fewer side effects to successfully alleviate PSD symptoms.   
Stroke has profound effects on walking.  
With a surviving cohort of nearly 7 million individuals, stroke is the leading cause of long- term disability 
in the [LOCATION_002]. Of the ~795,000 new strokes occurring in the U.S. each year (CDC -  Medical University of South Carolina  
Protocol  
   
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/stroke.htm .), approximately two- thirds of survivors will have some 
degree of long term disability, [ADDRESS_727244], with 
more than 60% of persons post -stroke reporting limitations in mobility related to walking.[ADDRESS_727245] on healthcare 
delivery.  
D. RESEARCH DESIGN AND ME THODS (including data analysis)  The purpose of this project is to 
determine the impact of AET, rTMS and their combination (AET+rTMS) treatments on post -stroke 
depressive symptoms and locomotor function so as to guide the development of a future clinical trial. The 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_553393]. Specifically, we have extensive experience using left prefrontal rTMS to treat depression; 26-[ADDRESS_727246] -stroke18,31,32; performing neuromechanical 
assessments of walking;33-35 applying advanced neuroimaging techniques to clinical populations;36-[ADDRESS_727247] -stroke subjects will 
be randomly assigned to one of four groups 1) AET; 2) rTMS; 3) combined AET and rTMS (AET+rTMS) 
or 4) control (sham rTMS) group (n=10 per condition; equally distributed with mild and moderate MDD). 
Further , an additional [ADDRESS_727248] -stroke subjects will complete 8 weeks of AET so as to allow 
us to determine the effects of PSD on response to training (Aim 2).  Training (AET, rTMS and AET+rTMS) 
will take place over an 8- week  period, three times per week on non -consecutive days. Measures of 
depression ( QIDS-SR16) as well as self -selected walking speed (SSWS) will be performed each week.  
Additional measures of locomotor function (walking endurance) will be assessed prior to training (pre), 
following 4  weeks of training (mid), upon completion of 8 weeks  of training (post), allowing determination 
of the efficacy (and persistence) of training on these outcomes. (Figure 1)   
In addition, when possible full neuromechanical a ssessments of walking on an instrumented treadmill will 
be performed at the same time points by [CONTACT_54315]: (i) kinetics (3 - dimensional ground reaction forces 
and moments), (ii) kinematics and iii) EMG from each leg. A battery of clinical assessments to evaluate 
degree of function and disability will be performed pre and post -training time point.   We will also utilize a 
combination of voxel -based morphometry (VBM), diffusional tensor imaging (DTI) and transcranial 
magnetic stimulation (recruitment curves (RCs) and paired associative stimulation (PAS)) to determine 
the relationship between changes in indices  of neuroplasticity and (changes in) locomotor function. 
Figure 1 :  Proposed timeline  
   
Specifically,  our outcome measures will be: 1) cortical thickness of the area of M1 associated with the 
lower extremity via VBM; 2) corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_88735] (CST) integrity from DTI, reflected by [INVESTIGATOR_78243] f or fractional 
anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD); 3) excitability of CST circuitry, determined by [CONTACT_553407]; and 4) neuroplastic state 
assessed by [CONTACT_276754].  All TMS measur ements (but not treatment) will be performed bilaterally and t he data 
used to determine a) the relative contributions of these measures to baseline locomotor function and b) 
their relationship with individual responses to intervention.  
Aim1: Quantify the effects of treatment on post -stroke depression.  
Rationale for Aim 1:  Both AET and rTMS are effective as stand- alone treatments for non -stroke related 
MDD. AET is shown to provide benefit for depression both in otherwise healthy individuals,43,[ADDRESS_727249] longer than those of antidepressant drugs and 
exercising subjects achieve higher rates of remission. 51 Repeated left prefrontal TMS (rTMS) is an FDA 
approved treatment for depression with demonstrated antidepressant effects greater than sham 
treatme nt that are both statistically and clinically meaningful in non- stroke related depression. 26,27,29 In 
addition, r TMS has demonstrated effects in persons with vascular depression (inclusive of stroke) 52 and 
there is preliminary support for the use of TMS to treat PSD. 53  
Outcome measures  for Aim 1 : The primary outcome measure we propose is the absolute change in 
the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self Report (QIDS -SR16)  compared between the 
four groups. The QIDS -SR16 measures severity of depressive symptoms and is w idely used in efficacy 
studies of antidepressant treatments.  Response and remission will be secondary outcomes, with 
response defined as a 50% reduction in baseline symptom severity and remission  as a QIDS -SR16  score 
of ≤10. We will conduct weekly QIDS -SR16 each week.  
Rationale for Aim 2: Neurological sequelae following stroke produce a multitude of residual functional 
limitations that contribute to disability and compromised quality of life. Though not yet established in 
individuals with PSD, substantive research indicates that AET signifi cantly improves post -stroke 
locomotor function. 7-[ADDRESS_727250] to stroke rehabilitation. The 
driving rationale supporting the use of rTMS is that it reduces depressive symptoms, therefore facilitating 
locomotor recovery by [CONTACT_553408]. Preliminary evidence supports the use of  rTMS 
in treating PSD , 53 as well as plausible mechanisms by [CONTACT_553409].  
We propose to explore the potential synergy of AET and rTMS to determine if adjunctive treatment for 
depression with TMS improves response to AET.  
Outcome measures for Aim 2: Our primary outcome for response to training will be weekly measures 
of self -selected walking speed (SSWS).  Secondary assessments of locomoto r function will be the six 
minute walk test (6MWT).  We will also assess changes in brain tissues as indices of neuroplastic 
changes. Our primary measure of neuroplasticity will be changes in cortical excitability (Recruitment 
Curve) and neuroplastic state  via paired associative stimulation (PAS).  Secondarily, we will measure 
cortical grey matter volume and microstructural integrity (FA and MD via DTI) in the area of the lower 
extremity motor cortex. We will test if PSD subjects exhibit a reduced neuroplas tic state, as demonstrated 
in the motor cortex in response to PAS stimulation, compared with age (± 5 yrs.) and gender matched 
non-depressed stroke subjects. PAS is an extremely novel tool to assess neuroplastic state following 
stroke and has previously been used to demonstrate deficits in depressed (non- stroke) subjects 
compared with healthy controls.13,[ADDRESS_727251] -stroke.55,56 
Treatments:  
   
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) depression treatment:  Subjects will undergo 
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to the left prefrontal region as a treatment approach for 
depression. 26-30 Treatment will be performed three times per week for eight weeks (24 treatment 
sessions).  A total of 6000 pulses/session will be delivered at 10Hz with an intensity of 120% of motor 
threshold. All TMS sessions will be overs een by a licensed physician.  A lthough these parameters are 
greater than the FDA approval in terms of the number of stimuli in a session, we have treated over [ADDRESS_727252] 6 years and the rate of adverse reactions is 
extremely low (<5%). 58 This dose is well tolerated in non- stroke depressed patients. T he FDA approval 
is for 3000 stimuli, five sessions per week for 4 -6 weeks. Given the reduction from 5 sessions/week to 
3/week to accommodate the AET schedule, we did not want to under dose  and thus increased the number 
of stimuli in a single session from 3 000 to 6000.    
Aerobic Exercise Training (AET):  Depressed (Aim 1) and non -depressed (Aim 2) subjects participating 
in AET will complete 24 sessions (3 sessions per week; 40 minutes per session on non- consecutive 
days) .  Exercise intensity will initially be set at ~60% of heart rate reserve and progressed throughout the 
training period. [ADDRESS_727253] and/or a licensed physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. Overhead 
harness support will be provided for safety during all training sessions.   
Combined rTMS and AET (AET+rTMS) treatment :  Subjects receiving AET+rTMS will undergo 
treatment (3 sessions per week non -consecutive days) for 8 weeks.  In these subjects, AET and rTMS 
treatments will be performed on the same day with the order of treatment alternated from week to week 
(thus removing the possibility for order effect of delivering the two treatments).  
Comparison (control) condition:  We will compare treatments (AET, rTMS and AET+rTMS) to a 
separate control group of subjects in each of the proposed aims (Figure 7).  Our comparison group for 
Aim 1 will be PSD subjects undergoing sham rTMS  treatment, similar to the OPT -TMS trial.  This will 
allow us to determine the effects of our active treatments (AET, rTMS or AET+rTMS) on weekly QIDS -
SR16  measures while controlling for the regular social interaction and attention from study investigators  
received in these groups.  Sham rTMS has been shown to positively affect depressive symptoms, but to 
a lesser degree than active rTMS. 26,28-30  
In Aim 2, we will compare the effects of our 3 treatment approaches on locomotor function in depresed 
subjects to a group of non- depressed subjects undergoing AET.  This will allow us to determine if PSD 
limits response to rehabilitation (AET in depresse d subjects v s AET in non- depressed subjects) as well 
if adjunctive treatment with rTMS improves response to training (AET vs. AET+rTMS).   
Quantitative Measures:  
Assessment of cortical excitability  using TMS:  We will use TMS to determine each subject’s resting 
motor threshold (rMT) for both the paretic and non- paretic legs. The rMT is defined as the minimal 
magnetic pulse resulting in contraction of the target muscle (i.e. medial gastrocnemius or tibialis anterior) 
as detected by [CONTACT_42623] (EMG) recordings of the motor evoked potentials (MEP). We will also 
measure the cortical silent period, and recruitment curves to get a full spectrum of analysis of cortical 
excitability. We will assess this at baseline as well as after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment (or control).   
Assessment of cortical excitability and neuroplastic potential via PAS:  A means of testing 
neuroplastic potential, without dependence on subject motivation and effort (frequently impaired in 
depression) is via a non- invasive brain stimulation protocol called paired associative stimulation (PAS).  
PAS uses repeated, timed and paired peripheral nerve stimulation and TMS of the contralateral motor 
cortex and induces consistent changes in excitabilit y of the motor cortex in healthy subjects as 
demonstrated by [CONTACT_553410]. 61-[ADDRESS_727254] partially dependent on associative 
long-term potentiation (LTP) 64,[ADDRESS_727255] shown that PAS measured neuroplasticity i s decreased in depressed patients. 13,21 
We will utilize the PAS measures at baseline, after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment (or control) to assess 
whether the interventions change PAS measured neuroplastic potential. We will use PAS to assess 
cortical excitability (difference in pre-  vs. post -stimulation MEP amplitude) as well as neuroplastic 
potential (represented by [CONTACT_340570] -stimulation MEP amplitude). We will compare PAS 
measures at baseline to after either AET, rTMS or AET+rTMS. We will also compare PAS measures in 
PSD patients to non -depressed post -strok e subjects (Aim 2) to determine whether PSD inhibits 
neuroplasticity, and if effective treatments reverse the impaired potential for plasticity.   
Exercise Tolerance Testing : All subjects will undergo an Exercise Tolerance Test performed according 
to the protocol used in the recently completed LEAPS trial [ADDRESS_727256], blood pressure readings will be 
obtained every 3 minutes and heart rate measured conti nuously from a 12- lead EKG.  
Experimental protocol for walking data collections:  Overground self -selected and fastest comfortable 
walking speeds will be measured at the beginning of each session. Treadmill speeds will then be set to 
match overground speeds  for data collections. Subjects will be asked to complete three trials at each 
speed (~30 second trials) during which kinematic, kinetic and EMG data will be captured. Subjects will 
be allowed to wear their own shoes and be asked to walk without an assisti ve device or ankle- foot orthosis 
(see Potential Limitations ). A safety harness will protect the subject in the case of a loss of balance and 
all sessions will be overseen by a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541].  
Measure of neural activation coordination:  Neural activation coordination will be assessed as the 
number of independent co- activation patterns (ICPs) present during steady state walking determined 
from sixteen channels of EMG (bilaterally from the medial gastrocnemius, soleus, tibialis anterior, rectus 
femoris, va stus medialis, biceps femoris, semimembranosus, and gluteus medius) similar to our 
published work. 69  
Experimental protocol for MRI of  brain:  All subjects will undergo high -resolution MRI in a 3T scanner 
(TIM Trio, Siemens) equipped with a thirty -two channel head coil. From each subject, two sequences will 
be obtained. First, a T1 -weighted image with [ADDRESS_727257] 
and voxel -based morphometry (VBM) performed to measure cortical grey matter thickness over the lower 
extremity motor cortex. Second, diffusion- weighted images will be acquired and used to calculate 
corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_88735] (CST) axonal integrity.  Finally, subjects may undergo an  fMRI sequence at rest and 
with a simple finger tappi[INVESTIGATOR_338471] . 
Clinical Assessments: In addition to our clinical measures of locomotor function (e.g. 6MWT, Fugl -
Meyer LE subtest ), we will perform clinical assessments of balance (DGI and BBS) , quality of life 
measures and questionnaires (SIS, NHIS Falls Questionnaire) as  well as additional measures of 
depressive symptomology (PHQ -9 and Beck Depression Index) .  These clinical assessments are 
standard to most post -stroke locomotor rehabilitation trials. Including these asses sments strengthens our 
design by [CONTACT_553411]/or depressive symptoms. We feel that the proposed benefits of our 
treatment will be most significant i f they are shown to impact behaviors other than that which is targeted 
as the primary outcome and relate to other domains of function suggested to put individuals post -stroke 
at risk for disability. All the proposed clinical assessments will be performed by a staff physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_553394].  
Subjects: Subjects (male and female), ages 18-70, will be screened and recruited for the study greater 
than [ADDRESS_727258] self -report with characteristic deficits, or medical documentation will be 
accepted.   Inclusion criteria will be: 1) age 18-70, 2) stroke greater than 6 months  ago , 3) depressive 
disorder ( PHQ -9 > 5 ) 4) residual paresis in the lower extremity (Fugl -Meyer LE motor score <34), 5) ability 
   
to walk without assistance and without an AFO on the treadmill ≥ 30 seconds at speeds ranging from 
0.2-1.0 m/s, 6) no antidepressant medications or clinically able to discontinue medications, 7) provision 
of informed consent. In addition, all subjects who meet criteria for the training portion must complete an 
exercise tolerance test and be cleared for participation by [CONTACT_289897]. Exclusion criteria will 
be: 1) Unable to ambulate at least 150 feet prior to stroke, or experienced intermittent claudication while 
walking; 2) history of congestive heart failure, unstable cardiac arrhythmias, hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, angina or dyspnea at rest or during ADL’s; 3) H istory of COPD 
or oxygen dependence; 4) Preexisting neurological disorders, or dementia; 5) History of major head 
trauma; 6) Legal blindness or severe visual impairment; 7) history of psychosis or other Axis I disorder 
that is primary; 8) Life expectancy < 1 yr.;  9) Severe arthritis or other problems that limit passive ROM; 
10) History of DVT or pulmonary embolism within 6 months; 11) Uncontrolled diabetes with recent weight 
loss, diabetic coma, or frequent insulin reactions; 12) Severe hypertension with sys tolic >200 mmHg and 
diastolic >[ADDRESS_727259]; 13) attempt of suicide in the last 2 years or at suicidal risk; 14) Current 
enrollment in a clinical trial to enhance motor recovery; 1 5) Presence of non- MR compatible implants, 
pregnancy or severe claustrophobia.  
Subject screening and clinical assessments: After enrollment, participants will be thoroughly 
evaluated for functional and cognitive impairments as well as physical performance. Descriptive physical 
performance testing will include the lower extremi ty Fugl -Meyer  Assessment (FMA -LE), Dynamic Gait 
Index (DGI), Stroke Impact Scale (SIS), Berg Balance Scale (BBS) , and the NHIS Falls Questionnaire.   
The FMA -LE is a 34 -point scale assessing lower extremity function through a progression of items 
examining more complex movements, speed, and coordination. The SIS is a stroke -specific outcome 
measure that assesses physical function and other dimensions of health- related quality of life: emotion, 
communication, memory and thinking, and social role function. The  physical functioning domain includes 
strength, hand function, mobility, and activities of daily living. We will use a three -step motor command 
item as a primary screen for study eligibility. All clinical assessments will be performed by a licensed  
physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_553395] a licensed physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541].  
 
Assessment of post -stroke depression: Subje ct screening for depression will be performed using the 
PHQ -9. We will include only subjects with MDD (PHQ -9 ≥ 5). In addition, we will assess depression 
severity using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatol ogy-Self-Report (QIDS -SR16) and the 
Beck D epression Inventory (BDI) if applicable.  Initial d epression severity will be classified as mild ( PHQ -
9 score: 5-9)), moderate ( PHQ -9 score:  10-14), moderately severe (PHQ -9 score: 15- 19), or severe 
(PHQ -9 score: 20- 27).    Testing and monitoring of depression symptomatology will use the QIDS -SR16 
classifications of: None (0- 5), Mild (6 -10), Moderate (11- 15), Severe (16 -20), and Very Severe (21- 27).   
Potential Problems and Alternative Solutions:  
Results show no added benefit of combining AET and rTMS : In the event that there is no added benefit 
(e.g. same or smaller effect size) of combining AET and rTMS, there are still a number of future study 
directions that are exciting and innovative.  If both AET and rTMS positively affect the proposed 
outcomes, we will pose questions related to dosing and timing of delivery.  For example, what is the 
impact of performing AET following treatment with rTMS and vi ce-versa via a cross -over study design? 
Further, if rTMS proves beneficial in alleviating depressive symptoms but AET does not improve 
locomotor function, this would also suggest treatment with rTMS prior to enrollment in AET.  Given the 
proven effects of AET in non- depressed post -stroke subjects, this scenario (presumably supported by 
[CONTACT_553412] 2) would suggest depressive symptoms limit response to AET and thus depression 
might need to be treated prior to performing AET.  An additional possibility is that AET is effective in 
improving locomotor function but rTMS does not improve depression.  This set of findings would lead us 
to perform dosing (e.g. intensity and duration of exercise) studies with AET with the goal of maximizing 
the effects of AET on locomotor improvements in persons with PSD.  The final scenario would be that 
there is no effect of rTMS on depression, nor an effect of AET on walking.  In this case, we would need 
to explore approaches besides rTMS to treat depression prior to performi ng AET.  Given the known 
benefits of AET in non- depressed post -stroke subjects, this scenario would suggest PSD blocks response 
   
to AET and depression needs to be treated effectively with approaches other than rTMS prior to 
performing AET.   
Effects of lesion location or size are unknown: Lesion location, lesion size and their combination are 
broadly considered correlates of motor dysfunction and potential predictors of functional motor recovery 
post-stroke. [ADDRESS_727260] been wholly inconsistent. 75,76 These conflicting observations 
highlight the unresolved issue of identifying appropriate neuroanatomical predictors of depression or 
functional motor recovery.  
Many subjects normally wear ankle- foot orthoses (AFO) : The biomechanical outcome measures 
proposed depend on accurate assessment of muscle function during walking. The consequences of 
abnormalities in muscle force production need to be understood well without an AFO, which may lead to 
future specific suggestio ns with respect to task demands that can be met with an AFO. Anecdotally, we 
know that most post -stroke individuals can walk without an AFO at home as well as during clinical exams. 
The presence of the safety harness provides adequate reassurance of safety  in the event of loss of 
balance.   
Neuromechanical outcomes may be influenced by [CONTACT_553413]:  Traditional biomechanical variables 
are influenced by [CONTACT_141604].  As such, the possibility exists that as participants change their 
functional ability throughout training, these variables will increase (or decrease) simultaneously.  To 
account for the potential influence of changes in walking speed on our biomechanical outcome measures 
(i.e. joint powers and angles), we will perform assessments at both self -selected and fastest comfortable 
speeds prior to and following training, with additional conditions at the post -training time point that are 
performed at speeds matched to those performed during the pre -training assessment.  
Statistical Considerations:   
A primary goal of this project is to generate statistics that are 
useful in planning a larger randomized clinical trial. In this 
preliminary study subjects will be randomized to one of four 
treatment categories generated from our 2 x 2 factorial design 
(Figure 8). The factors in this design are AET (yes or no) and 
rTMS (yes or no). The outcomes ( QIDS -SR16  for Aim 1 and 
SSWS for Aim 2) will be measured longitudinally over an 8-
week period (total nine measurements). In this  pi[INVESTIGATOR_553396] [ADDRESS_727261] a large difference of 4.5 
units in QIDS -SR16  score at the end of 8 weeks is 8 subjects 
per group (assuming an Intra- class correlation of 0.[ADDRESS_727262] deviation of 5 units, 77 at 
80% power and 5% significance level). We will enroll [ADDRESS_727263] deviation of 0.135.  Statistical analyses will be performed through a longitudinal 
repeated measur es ANOVA (using PROC GLIMMIX in SAS©). Additional covariates (baseline QIDS -
SR16  and SSWS, gender, lesion laterality) will be considered in secondary analyses. If missing data 
occur appropriate missing data methods such as multiple imputations will be appl ied.   
E. PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS

with persistent motoric disability following a stroke,  the most recent no less than six months prior. Subjects

aerobic exercise training  (AET); 2) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS); 3) combined AET 
and rTMS (AET+rTMS) or 4) control gr oup.  All groups with include 10 subjects equally distributed with 
mild and moderate major depressive disorder (MDD). Subject screening for depression will be performed 
using the PHQ -9. We will include only subjects with MDD symptomology (PHQ -9 ≥ 5 In addi tion, we will 
assess depression severity using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology -Self-Report (QIDS -
SR16) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) if applicable.  Initial d epression severity will be classified 
as mild ( PHQ -9 score: 5 -9)), moderate ( PHQ -9 score:  10-14), moderately severe (PHQ -9 score: 15- 19), 
or severe (PHQ -9 score: 20 -27).    Testing and monitoring of depression symptomatology will use the 
QIDS -SR16 classifications o f: None (0- 5), Mild (6 -10), Moderate (11- 15), Severe (16- 20), and Very 
Severe (21- 27). Further, an additional [ADDRESS_727265] -stroke subjects  (PHQ -9<5) will complete 
8 weeks of AET.  Training (AET, rTMS and AET+rTMS) will take place over an 8- week  period, three times 
per week on non- consecutive days.  Measures of depression as well as self -selected walking speed 
(SSWS) will be performed each week.  Additional measures of locomotor function (walking endurance) 
will be assessed prior to training (pre), following 4 weeks of training (mid), upon completion of 8 weeks  
of training (post) .  In addition, full biomechanical assessments of walking on an instrumented treadmill 
will be performed at the same time points by [CONTACT_54315]: (i) kinetics (3-  dimensional ground reaction forces 
and moments), (ii) kinematics and iii) EMG from each leg. A battery of clinical assessments to evaluate 
degree of function and disability will be performed pre and post -training.   We will  also utilize a combination 
of voxel -based morphometry (VBM), diffusional tensor imaging (DTI) and transcranial magnetic 
stimulation to determine the relationship between changes in indices of neuroplasticity and (changes in) 
locomotor function. Specifically,  our outcome measures will be: 1) cortical t hickness of the area of M1 
associated with the lower extremity via VBM; 2) corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_88735] (CST) integrity from DTI, reflected by 
[CONTACT_553414] (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD); 3) excitability of CST circuitry, determined 
by [CONTACT_553415]; and 4) neuroplastic state assessed by [CONTACT_340580] (PAS).  All TMS 
measurements (but not treatment) will be performed bilaterally and t he data used to determine a) the 
relative contributions of these measures to baseline locomotor function and b) their relationship with 
individual responses to intervention.  
Subjects (male and female), ages 18-70, will be screened and recruited for the study greater than six 
months post -stroke, allowing for natural recovery during the first [ADDRESS_727266] -stroke. The pool of 
candidates for the study will be recruited from rehabilitation programs at the Medical University of South

and if appropriate will be accepted into the study for training.  
Inclusion criteria will be: 1) age 18-70, 2) stroke greater than 6 months  ago, 3) mild-major  depressive 
disorder  symptomology  (PHQ -9 > 5) 4) residual paresis in the lower extremity (Fugl -Meyer LE motor

medications, 7) provision of informed consent. In addition, all subjects who meet criteria for the training 
portion must complete an exercise tolerance test and be cleared for participation by [CONTACT_289897]. 
Exclusion criteria will be: 1) Unable to ambulate at least 150 feet prior to stroke, or experienced 
intermittent claudication while walking; 2) history of congestive heart failure, unstable cardiac 
arrhythmias, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, angina or dyspnea at rest or during

This research will include women and minorities to the extent reflected by [CONTACT_553416], SC and its surrounding areas. There are no exclusions for sex/gender or race/ethnic group.  
There will be no involvement of vulnerable populations.  At this time, children will not be recruited to be 
in this study as we are only investigating adults with motor control dysfunction. The targeted enrollment 
table reflects the 4% of the South Carolina population of Hispanic or Latino descent. There are no 
collaborating sites at this time.  
b.  Sources of Materials  
All data will be acquired for purposes of research only and will be kept confidential. Data will be c oded 
and not traceable to individuals in any publication. Files will be stored in locked offices or password-
protected servers dedicated to [CONTACT_290584] and key study personnel only.  
c.  Potential Risks  
The risks of the exercise tolerance tests are minimal but could include fainting, falling, irregular heartbeat, 
and very rarely heart attack, stroke, or death (less than 1 in 2500 cases). Professional staff (exercise 
physiologist, physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], and cardiologists) will be present and available throughout and 
emergency treatment will be available if it becomes necessary.  
There are no significant risks to the subjects in the proposed AET  methods. The risks to individuals 
participating in this portion of the study are no greater than the risks when providing conventional physical 
rehabilitation services to an individual after stroke. The same precautions and safety guidelines will be 
taken that are provided in patient care in rehabilitation settings. The AET program and the clinical testing 
should not present a risk for the patient but could result in muscle soreness and/or joint stiffness but these 
symptoms should not persist more than a few days. There is a minimal risk for muscle strains during the 
testing and training.  Under the conditions proposed for this project, MRI is not known to harm living 
systems. The locomotor assessments used in the proposed study are routine, clinical assessments of 
gait used in physical therapy clinics and rehabilitation facilities. The GAITRite  system has been used to  
assess walking performance with no adverse reactions or report of discomfort. The experimental protocol 
to be used in this portion of the proposal involves minimal risk, and is considered standard clinical 
practice. During all treadmill walking trials, a safety harness will be worn and a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_553397]. The harness will be designed to eliminate 
the consequences of falling as the device “catches” the subject should they trip or stumbl e. The presence 
of this device affords comfort and diminishes the “fear of falling” in subjects.  
2.  ADEQUACY OF PROTECTION AGAINST RISKS  
a.  Recruitment and Informed Consent  
A total of fifty subjects (male and female; n= 40), ages 18- 70, will be screened and recruited for the 
proposed study. The pool of post -stroke candidates for the study will be recruited from inpatient 
rehabilitation programs at the Medical University of S outh Carolina, Charleston, SC, t he Clinical Database 
for Rehabilitation Research ( Pro00015991), The Comprehensive Stroke Clinical Biological, Physical and 
Occupational Therapy Data Repository Pi[INVESTIGATOR_48540] (Pro00020549) surrounding clinics involved in the 
care and treatment of strok e survivors, community centers  and word of mouth.  This study will also recruit 
from the Registry for Stroke Recovery (RESTORE -Pro#00037803), which is a registry with subjects 
consented for future contact. RESTORE staff will query the registry for potential subjects and provide the 
Principal Investigator (PI) with the contact [CONTACT_247345]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_553398].  The Stroke Center at the 
Medical University of South Carolina will assist wi th recruitment by [CONTACT_553417] . Potential subjects will be given information while inpatient and 
again when they are seen for follow up in the outpatient clinic for the MUSC Stroke Cente r. The Stroke 
   
Center research team will establish communication with the potential subjects and act as a liaison with 
the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_482660]. The MUSC Stroke Center sees over [ADDRESS_727268] .  
 
b) Sharing Data  
If the subject agrees, the data collected and generated from this study will be shared and linked to 
RESTORE (Pro# 00037803) and/or to the Clinical Database for Rehabilitation Research in Neur ological 
Conditions (Pro# 00015991)  by [CONTACT_423]’s registry ID. Sharing data from this study with the registry 
will allow for more targeted recruitment efforts in the future and allow researchers at MUSC to have a 
more complete registry with key stroke r ecovery elements including common data and physical function 
characteristics that are applicable to multiple studies.  
 
Subjects enrolled in this study also will have the opportunity to participate in Pro00039095 concurrently.  
For those participants who agree to participate in Pro00039095, data collected and generated from 
participating in this study will be shared and linked to the data collected in Pro00039095.   
 
c.  Protection against Risk  
A licensed physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_553399] a licensed nurse or 
trained technician will be present for all rTMS sessions .  During all treadmill walking trials, a safety 
harness will be worn to provide assistance in t he event of loss of balance. The research staff will closely 
monitor the subject to ensure their comfort. Any adverse events will be recorded and monitored as 
required by [CONTACT_232730]. In the event of an adverse medical event, standard fa cility 
emergency procedures will be followed and proper personnel notified. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_482672] a 
licensed physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_553400]. Further, [CONTACT_95052]  is a psychiatrist with years of experience using rTMS to treat 
depression.  Any adverse events will be recorded and monitored as required by [CONTACT_1201]. On-site medical 
services will be available in the event of adverse events to the subjects. Subjects will be able to terminate 
the training or testing sessions at their request at any time without prejudice. Minimization of risk will be 
accomplished by [CONTACT_553418]. We 
will follow the Americ an College of Sports Medicine criteria for terminating an inpatient exercise session 
which includes: subject complaints of light -headedness, confusion, or dyspnea; onset of angina; 
excessive blood pressure changes (systolic BP greater than [ADDRESS_727269] olic BP greater than 110 
mmHg); and inappropriate bradycardia (drop in heart rate >10 beats per minute).  
Should a participant complete the PHQ -[ADDRESS_727270] to diagnose or treat anyone with mental illness.  Further action will not 
be taken unless study participation is affected by [CONTACT_553419].  
Confidentiality : All records regarding participation in this study will be kept in locked file cabinets in the 
appropriate laboratories and/or offices, and stored on password- protected computers/servers in the 
offices and laboratories of the PI’s research team. There will be no direct link to participant identifying 
information (other than subject code) without access to a password- protected computer containing the 
identifying information linking information to a given subject. Access to linked identifiers is limited to 
research personnel intimately involved with the human subjects. All data and records acquired from 
subjects is for research purposes only and will be kept confidential and maintained in a secure database 
identifiable only by [CONTACT_232729]. The results of the study may be published for scientific purposes; 
however, subjects’ identities will not be revealed and data will not be traceable to any individuals  in any 
resultant publications. The information gathered during this study will be kept confidential to the extent 
permitted by [CONTACT_2371].  
   
c. Payment  to Participants 
Participants will receive compensation for participating in this research study based on study r elated 
expenses. Reimbursement will be $20/day for each visit  and $5/visit for transportation related expenses 
(e.g. parking, cab or bus fare, metered parking) . Total compensation for the study is up to $650 ($520 for 
participation and $130 for travel related expenses).  
3.  POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH TO THE SUBJECTS AND OTHERS  
Subjects who participate in this study may see improvements in their own mood or functional ability, but 
any benefit cannot be guaranteed.  Others may benefit from advancement of scientific knowledge.  Given 
the minimal risks involved and the potential for improved functional capacity, the potential benefits of 
participation make the potential risks reasonable.  
4.  IMPORTANCE OF THE KNOWLEDGE TO BE GAINE D  
A better and more specific scientific understanding of effects of PSD and its impact on  rehabilitation 
may ultimately lead to a better understanding of neuroplasticity and the extent to which training restores 
locomotor ability. Given the minimal risks involved and the potential to add to the limited base of 
scientific knowledge describing this population, the potential risks are reasonable.  
5.  SUBJECT SAFETY AND MINIMIZING RISKS (Data and Safety Monitoring Plan)  
A licensed physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_553401].  In addition, during all treadmill 
walking trials, a safety harness will be worn to provide assistance in the event of loss of balance. The 
research staff will closely monitor the subject to ensure their comfort. Any adverse events will be recorded 
and monitored as required by [CONTACT_232730]. In the event of an adverse medical event, 
standard facility emergency procedures will be followed and proper personnel notified. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_553402] a lic ensed physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_553403]. Any adverse events will be recorded and monitored as required 
by [CONTACT_1201]. On-site medical services will be available in the event of adverse events to the subjects. 
Subjects will be able to terminate the training or testing sessions at their request at any time without 
prejudice. Minimization of risk will be accomplished by [CONTACT_553420]. We will follow the American College of Sports Medicine criteria for 
terminating an inpatient exercise session which includes: subject complaints of light -headedness, 
confusion, or dyspnea; onset of angina; excessive blood press ure changes (systolic BP greater than 220 
mmHg, diastolic BP greater than 110 mmHg); and inappropriate bradycardia (drop in heart rate >10 beats 
per minute).  
Brain Stimulation Data Safety and Monitoring Plan:  We will implement a screening tool for all par ticipants 
undergoing tDCS that is currently used in the Brain Stimulation Laboratory at MUSC.  In addition, [CONTACT_553426] will personally supervise the first several participants, and [CONTACT_239377] will function as on- site 
medical supervision for the tDCS trials.  Stimulation sessions will be stopped immediately with any 
complaints of pain or burning at the stimulation sites or for any complaints of dizziness or light -
headedness.  There are no reported serious adverse events in the literature for tDCS at this time.

H. FACILITES AVAILABLE  
Locomotor Energetics and Assessment Laboratory : This is a 1350 square foot laboratory located 
within the College of Health Professions Research Building on the campus of Medical University of South 
Carolina. The laboratory is a shared VA -MUSC resource, is supported in part by [CONTACT_553422], kinetic, 
electromyographic, strength, and metabolic data. The motion analysis laboratory is adjacent to a small 
workshop available for t he construction, repair, and alteration of simple mechanical devices.   
Locomotor Rehabilitation Laboratory : This laboratory encompasses an [ADDRESS_727284] relevant to the proposed work is a ZeroG mobile body weight support system (only 
the 6th one installed nationally), a Woodway split -belt treadmill and a Shuttle System lower extremity 
exercise machine.  The focus of this laboratory is on a multi -faceted approach to locomotor recovery after 
neurological injury, initially targeting stroke and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828].    
Neuromuscular Assessment Laboratory : This lab is also hous ed in the College Of Health Professions 
research building at the Medical University of South Carolina and is designed to investigate the neural 
and muscular mechanisms underlying abnormal muscle function and the development of effective 
interventions. Major equipment includes a  Biodex System 4 Pro isokinetic dynamometer, GE Logiq 
ultrasound and a 10 channel EMG system (Motion Lab Systems).  
   
Center for Advanced Imaging Research:  The Center for Advanced Imaging Research (CAIR) is a 
multidisciplinary collaboration of the Departments of Radiology , Neurology  and Psychiatry . CAIR’s main 
facilit y is centered on a new stand- alone imaging research suite, directly across the street from the main 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_553405], and houses a new Siemens 3T Trio MRI scanner. The 
scanner operates with a 100% mandate for research use, as delineated in the state- approved certificate 
of need, and is covered by a master research agreement with Siemens Medical Research. The suite also 
contains an image analysis laboratory and bioengineering facility along with patient interview and 
changing rooms. Researchers also have access to other equipment in associated departments, including 
clinical Siemens 1.5T and 3T Verio MR scanners. A significant component of CAIR is the informatics 
management system, which consists of an integrated system of Linux workstations surrounding a central 
core of Linux servers and a growing cluster facility, allowing network access for data retrieval and image 
analysis both locally and to CAIR members working remotely. A full -time informatics person manages 
the system, providing system design, trouble- shooting, data export, software maintenance, and 
systematic backup. Software maintained for CAIR researchers covers a wide range of commonly used 
contemporary applications for medical image analysis, including SPM , FSL, AFNI , FreeSurfer , Slicer , 
MedINRIA , MRIcron , Java Image , ImageJ , Camino, jMRUI , and LCModel , as well as a range of more 
generic analysis tools.  
The Brain Stimulation Laboratory (BSL) is located on the 5th floor of the Institute of Psychiatry. BSL 
studies use electromagnetic approaches as either research tools investigating neuroscience questions 
or as investigational or FDA approved treatments for  brain diseases. Techniques actively being used by 
[CONTACT_553423] (TMS) and transcranial 
direct current stimulation (tDCS). The BSL team has been a world leader in TMS research since 1995, 
performing research studies using TMS as well as using TMS and tDCS in clinical trials.  
 
CLINICAL  
MUSC Medical Center: MUSC has a comprehensive range of specialized care centers, including a 
JCAHO -certified Stroke Center . The Stroke Center at MUSC includes highly trained neuroscience 
nurses, a neuroscience service line administrator, stroke neurologists, neurointensivists, interventional 
neuroradiologists, diagnostic neuroradiologists, cerebrovascular neurosurgeons, medical intensivists, 
neurosonology tec hnologists, dedicated neurosciences critical care pharmacists, comprehensive 
rehabilitation services, dedicated case managers and social workers, and a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based ground 
transport system. The program holds Joint Commission's Certificate of Distinction for Primary Stroke 
Centers which recognizes centers that make exceptional efforts to foster better outcomes for stroke care. 
Subjects will be recruited from the inpatient stroke units as well as the outpatient clinic for the MUSC 
Stroke Center. The Stroke Center research team will assist with recruitment by [CONTACT_553424] . Potential participants will be given information while inpatient and 
again when they are seen for follow up in the outpatient clinic. The  Stroke Center research team will 
establish communication with the potential participants and act as a liaison with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_553406]. The MUSC Stroke Center sees over [ADDRESS_727285] recruitment, 
these facilities offer the investigators the opportunity to gain exposure to clinical problems by [CONTACT_553425], observing inpatient rehabilitation, and i nteracting with clinicians.

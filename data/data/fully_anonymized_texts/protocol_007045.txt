  PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Title of study:   Multi-center, randomized, double-blinded assessment of Tecfidera
® in extending 
the time to a first attack in radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) (ARISE) 
 
Purpose:  T o prospectively study the efficacy of Tecfidera in  extending the time to a seminal 
acute or progressive demyelinating event in a cohort of U.S. RIS subjects.     Rationale:  RIS subjects are frequently exposed to disease modifying therapi[INVESTIGATOR_882422].  Earlier treatment intervention may extend the time to the first acute or progressive clinical event resulting from CNS demyelination and reduce new radiological activity .  In addition, early treatment may result in more profound 
effects on reducing disability progression long- term.  
 
Primary outcome:  T he primary outcome measure for this trial is the time to the first acute or 
progressive neurological event resulting from CNS demyelination from randomization into the 
trial. 
 
Population:   This study will include RIS subjects from the U.S. who fulfill 2009 RIS Criteria
1. 
 
Inclusion/Exclusion criteria:

 Data analysis:  Primary analysis:  
- We will evaluate the time from randomization to the first demyelinating event (acute or 
development of an initial symptom resulting in a progressive clinical course) utilizing 
Kaplan-Meier survival analyses.  Log-rank tests will be used to compare survival  data 
between groups at univariate analysis.   
 
Secondary analyses:  
- Multivariate Bayesian Cox regression models will be created to assess the independent 
predictive value of demographic characteristics (i.e. sex, ethnicity, age at the time of RIS 
diagnosis), clinical data (i.e. MS family history, occult neurological examination findings, 
environmental exposure data, cognitive performance, PRO, CSF profiles, etc.), and 
imaging data (i.e. number of brain MRI lesions, the presence of gadolinium enhancing lesions, geographical distribution of lesions, involvement of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], brain atrophy, etc.) on the time to the first symptomatic event.   
 - The association of each covariate with time to the first clinical symptom will be 
quantified by [CONTACT_882445] (HR) along with their 95% confidence intervals (CI).  Assessments to determine differences between centers will also be performed with statisti cal adjustments planned for subsequent analyses depending upon the obtained 
results.  
 - MRI outcomes  (proportion of subjects with gadolinium enhancement and new radiologic 
activity ). 
 ABOUT THIS STUDY  
A strategic research alliance was formed between the Radiologically Isolated Syndrom e 
Consortium (RISC) and Biogen to explore this important initiative of investigating the impact of 
early treatment intervention in subjects who possess the first visible manifestation of multiple sclerosis.   This colla boration enabled the development and effective execution of an innovative 
approach in demyelinating disease more quickly and strategically .  The current home of RISC, 
the University of [LOCATION_007] Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas ([LOCATION_007], U.S.A.)  is proud to serve 
as the study sponsor for this novel research study.

 2.  INTRODUCTION  
2.1 Background Multiple sclerosis  (MS) is a common cause of severe neurological disability in young adults, 
resulting from an autoimmune interruption of both myelin and axons within the central nervous 
system (CNS). The diagnosis is made by [CONTACT_882446], by [CONTACT_882447][INVESTIGATOR_1831], along with criteria for time, by [CONTACT_5024] a history of at least a second clinical attack or the development of a new MS lesion on MRI after the seminal neurological event
2, 3.  Similar to many other chronic diseases, signs of impending 
disease may be observed in the months to years preceding the formal diagnosis.  In the case of 
MS, healthy individuals who do not exhibit signs of neurological dysfunction commonly have 
brain MRI studies performed for a reason other than an evaluation for MS that reveal unexpected anomalies highly suggestive of demyelinating plaques given their size, location, and morphology
1, 4, 5.  These healthy subjects lack symptomatology suggestive of MS and fulfill formal 
criteria for radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS), a recently described MS subtype that expands 
upon the phenotype of at-risk individuals for future demyelinating events.  A formal description of 
RIS was first introduced in [ZIP_CODE], to define this relevant cohort of individuals routinely 
encountered in clinical practice.  The discovery of such anomalies creates intersecting neuro-ethical, legal, social, and practical medical management quandaries  and is, therefore, of both 
immediate and long-term clinical significance.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_882423]
6-9, and in our understanding of risk factors for initial symptom development10, 11, the 
effect of treatment on such cases remain unclear.  I n addition, disease- modifying therapi[INVESTIGATOR_882424], placing 
subjects at risk for unnecessary exposure to both expensive and potentially harmful treatments.  2.2 Purpose & rationale 
The purpose of this investigation is to systematically study  the efficacy of Tecfidera in those 
individuals who possess incidental white matter anomalies within the brain following a MRI study 
that is performed for a reason other than for the evaluation of MS .  A recent multi -national effort, 
involving RIS subjects from 5 countries, revealed that in 16% (73/451)  of cases, regardless of the 
presence or absence of an asymptomatic spi[INVESTIGATOR_882425], a disease modifying therapy was 
prescribed prior to the development of a first clinical event
12.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_882426], there are no scientific data supporting the use of such treatments in RIS.  The rationale for the proposed research is that earlier treatment intervention may  extend the time to the fir st 
acute or progressive clinical event resulting from CNS demyelination and reduce new radiologic  
activity .  In addition, exposure to earlier treatment compared to traditional treatment patterns in 
symptomatic groups  may result in more profound effects on reducing disability progression long-
term.

5.  STUDY PROCEDURES  
5.1  Hypothesis We hypothesize that trea tment with Tecfidera
 will i) extend the time to the first acute or 
progressive demyelinating event by [CONTACT_882448]) reduce the development of new MRI lesions within the CN S compared to subjects  randomized to placebo. 
 5.2  C entral Clinical and Imaging Units 
To accurately identify subjects with RIS, formal units will be created to review data prior to study 
entry.  
 
5.2.1 Core Clinical Unit:  
A Core Clinical Data Unit, led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Okuda, will be formed and comprised of a prominent 
international collaborator  and trained MS specialist.  This group will evaluate clinical information 
from both existing and new cases within partnering centers, including results from para-clinical studies (i.e. blood work, CSF, electrophysiological studies, etc.) to ensure that subjects 
accurately fulfill criteria for study entry.  In addition, this group will be responsible for adjudicating all neurological events and post-attack clinical data during the study period.  If a discrepancy exists between reviewers following the independent review of submitted case s, [CONTACT_882459] will 
provide a decision on the final classification. The Core Clinical Unit will unify all screening data 
(including conclusions from the Central Imaging Unit (below) ) and will notify participating site PIs  
when entry criteria are met for potential study participants.  
 
5.2.2 Central Imaging Unit:  
A Central Imaging Unit will be formed and will be comprised of a board certified neuro -
radiologist and MS specialist with neuro-imaging exper tise. The MS specialist will confirm 
screened cases for study entry. MRI scans from subjects will be independently reviewed by [CONTACT_882449] -radiologist and determinations made if subjects fulfill MRI criteria for 
RIS.  If a discrepancy exists between the two reviewers following the independent review of a case  the MS specialist with neuro-imaging expertise will provide a decision on the final 
classification.  The MS specialist with neuro-imaging expertise will also be responsible for 
Version 8 /  , November 5, 2018

STU102014 -019, Okuda, Form A3, Mod_15, 12 -05-18 (3)   ensuring that a uniform protocol (“Dummy scans”) is implemented at specified sites for the 
collection of uniform, multi -center data for post processing.  In addition, this group will evaluate 
all MRI studies of the CNS for interval change (i.e. new and enlarging T2 lesion(s), gadolinium 
enhancement) during follow-up imaging studies and imaging studies acquired during clinical 
events.  At End of Study, changes in T2-lesion volumes, and brain atrophy (SIENA)  will be 
determined.   5.3 Study Design 
This is a multi -center, randomized, double-blinded study in which  approximately 90 RIS s ubjects 
(refer to section 12 for sample size justification) will be treated with either Tecfidera or placebo 
(1:1 randomization) for 3 years  or until End of Study (EOS) which is March 31, 2021.   The 
primary outcome measure is the time to the first acute or progressive neurological event r esulting 
from CNS demyelination.  The secondary outcome measures include the number of new or 
enlar ging T2 lesions, and the change in the number of contrast enhancing lesions , and T2-lesion 
and brain volumes.  Study participants , along with  the treating and examining physicians , will be 
blinded to treatment assignment.  Central 
Clinical  and Imaging Units will screen all  potential 
study subjects for inclusion/exclusion criteria. We expect to e nroll all RIS subjects within the U.S.   
 
Following informed consent and verification of entry criteria by [CONTACT_882450], study participants 
will be randomized 1:1 to either Tecfidera  (120mg by [CONTACT_6816] 7 days with dose 
escalation to 240mg by [CONTACT_104744] ) or placebo.  Clinical follow -up by [CONTACT_30780], as defined within this protocol, will occur at weeks  0, 48, 96, 144 and/or EOS   and 
during or immediately following clinical exacerbations.  (please refer to Study Schematic) .  
During clinical visits comprehensive medical history data, safety labs, and optional biological samples  will be obtained  by [CONTACT_1963] .   
  Patients will be scheduled for safety screenings (CBC & CMP) at weeks 12, 24, 72, 120; at which 
time they will be seen by [CONTACT_882451].   In addition to the face-to -face visits described above, study participants will be contact[CONTACT_882452] 4, 8, 36, 60, 84, 108, and 132 to assess for medical or treatment 
difficulties in addition to study medication compliance.   
 
Standardized MRI studies of the brain will be performed at week s 0 ,96, 144 or EOS ; an 
additional MRI will be obtained at week 46 for those patients enrolled at the UTSW site only. 
Clinical imaging studies of the brain and/or spi[INVESTIGATOR_882430] a clinical exacerbation will be performed at the discretion of the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_882431].   A clinical MRI of the cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_882432] [ADDRESS_1234236] party payers.  A recommendation to re-evaluate the patient within 3 months following the clinical event to assess for extent of recovery will be made.

STU102014 -019, Okuda, Form A3, Mod_15, 12 -05-18 (3)   5.[ADDRESS_1234241].  Site PIs will be responsible for 
confirming clinical events  and will perform the EDSS examination.  Data will be entered via 
electronic data capture ( EDC) for review by [CONTACT_882455] .  In the event of a suspected seminal acute or progressive 
demyelinating event, attempts will be made to evaluate the subject on an urgent basis within 48-
72 hours from symptom onset by [CONTACT_55794] (medical standard of care).  Repeat 
imaging of the brain and spi[INVESTIGATOR_882440].  Acute 
interventions (i.e. high-dose glucocorticosteroid treatment, etc.) will be prescribed and managed 
at the discretion of the treating physician at participating sites.   The study visit will be labeled as 
either an “unscheduled visit” or a “relapse visit”. Study participant may  be asked to provide 
additional biologic al specimens  (serum ) for future investigations.  Sites will be encouraged to re-
evaluate the patient within 3 months (medical standard of care) following the clinical event to assess the extent of recovery.  All subjects who experience a seminal neurological event related to CNS demyelination, or those who are found to be intolerant to the study medication, will be 
provided with options highlighted in section 5.8.  
 
RIS subjects will be made aware of any radiological progression identified on longitudinal 
imaging of the brain and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831].  As there is no FDA approved acute or long-term treatment for RIS, subjects will be extensively counseled by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_882441].  
 
5.8  Treatment options and safety monitoring following a confirmed r elapse, intolerance to 
the study medication, or low  absolute lymphocyte count s 
 
5.8.1  When eligible, subjects on blinded study treatment who experience a confirmed clinical 
relapse by [CONTACT_882456]: 
 
1. Remain on study treatment, with assignment remaining blinded 
2. Prematurely discontinue blinded study treatment, begin treatment with Tecfidera (covered by [CONTACT_882457] 3-years from study enrollment date or until EOS ) or subcutaneous 
peginterferon beta 1-a (Plegridy) if the study subject was randomized to Tecfidera, and remain in the study to complete a modified schedule of follow -up 
 Modified Schedule of Follow -Up: 
 - Re-evaluate patient within 3 mos of clinical event / relapse.  
 - Patient then presents every [ADDRESS_1234242]-relapse (PR) follow up; Week 48 
PR, Week 96 PR etc, until original EOS  date.  
   
 
3. Prematurely discontinue blinded study treatment, decline open-label treatment with Tecfidera or Plegridy, and remain in the study to complete the schedule of follow -up 
evaluations. Original treatment assignment remained bli nded 
 
5.8.2  Dose  reduction treatment option for intolerable flushing and/or gastrointestinal 
disturbances related to study medication:  
 
Patient-reported complaints of persistent, intolerable flushing and/or gastrointestinal 
disturbance to blinded study medication will be asked to reduce the blinded study medication administration to one capsule twice daily for one month. Following the one-month reduction in 
Version 8 /  , November 5, 2018 
20 
STU102014 -019, Okuda, Form A3, Mod_15, 12 -05-18 (3)   dose, patients will be asked to resume taking two capsules twice daily. If the patient is still unable 
to tolerate the blinded study treatment, the patient will be required to discontinue study treatment.  
 Any patient continuing to experience intolerance to study medication following the one-
month reduction in dose will be offered a switch to Plegridy as an alternative therapy. The patient will be unblinded to the study medication at this time.  Plegridy  will be administered per FDA-
dosing and titration instructions for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis.   
 
Any patient continuing to experience intolerance to study medication following the one-
month reduction in dose, refusing a switch in therapy to Pl egridy , and prematurely discontinuing 
dosing with blinded study treatment due to intolerance will be  asked to consider  remaining in the 
study and encouraged to continue participation in the trial  on a modified schedule of 
assessments. Patient treatment will remain blinded. 
Modified Schedule of Follow -Up: 
 - Re-evaluate patient within 3 mos of clinical event / relapse.  
  - Patient then presents every [ADDRESS_1234243]-relapse (PR) follow up; Week 48 
PR, Week 96 PR etc, until original EOS  date.  
   
       5.8.3  P arameters for low lymphocyte counts: 
 
 In the event that the absolute lymphocyte count is observed to be <500 cells/L during any 
time within the study, a repeat blood draw will be performed 3 months later.  If a sustained 
reduction of the absolute lymphocyte count is observed (<500 cells/L), the study subject will be 
unblinded to the study medication and removed from the randomized portion of the trial.  Repeat 
assessments will be performed monthly until the absolute lymphocyte count is >500 cells/L.   
Once the absolute lymphocyte count is found to be >500 cells/L, s tudy subjects randomized to 
Tecfidera will be given the opportunity to receive  Plegridy  (covered by [CONTACT_882458]) . 
 
The rationale for providing these options to subjects was 2-fold: to conduct this placebo-
controlled study ethically and to make every effort to continue to follow the subjects (for efficacy 
and safety evaluations), even after they discontinued the study treatment. 
 5.8.4 Parameters for drug non-compliance  
 
Patients who are non-compliant with medication dosing, or who discontinue taking their 
medication, may remain in the study in observation. They will remain on their original follow -up schedule but will no longer be dispensed medication. It should be noted in 
WebEz that medication has stopped.

5. MRI anomalies do not account for clinically apparent neurological  impairments  in  patients  
  
Exclusion criteria  
1. Women who are pregnant or nursing  
2. Incomplete medical history or radiological data 
3. History of remitting clinical symptoms consistent with multiple sclerosis lasting > 24 hours prior to CNS imaging revealing anomalies suggestive of MS  
4. History of paroxysmal symptoms associated with MS (i.e. Lhermitte’s or Uhthoff’s phenomena)  
5. CNS MRI anomalies are better accounted for by [CONTACT_882444]  
6. The subject is unwilling or unable to comply with the requirements of the study protocol  
7. Exposure to a disease modifying therapy for MS/RIS within the past [ADDRESS_1234246] to study participants.  
Study drug will be provided to the study sites by a study drug management vendor as triggered 
through an enrollment/randomization system. If patients are eligible to switch to Plegridy (due to 
study medication intolerance), this treatment will also be provided at no cost to the study participants  for the duration of three 48ars from the date of randomization into the trial. 
 Any patient that becomes pregnant during the trial will discontinue study medication and 
complete the early withdrawal assessments according to the schedule of assessments table 
(page 14).  8.  REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS (AEs) AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAEs)  
8.[ADDRESS_1234247] dose of study treatment through 
week 144 or EOS  visit or early withdrawal/discontinuation visit, whether or not considered related 
to study  treatment. Signs and symptoms existing prior to first dose and documented on the 
baseline Medical History form or Physical Examination Form are not considered AEs. Only baseline signs and symptoms that worsen while the subject is on the study drug are considered 
adverse events.  
 
At every visit, participant will be questioned regarding the occurrence and nature of any adverse experiences. If any signs, symptoms or the results of the laboratory tests indicate an adverse effect, the study physician should determine the severity (grade) of the AE and judge the relationship to the study treatment according to the current version of the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) . In 
addition, if an adverse event necessitates medical care, appropriate care will be provided. Adverse events should be documented on the Adverse Event Report form, regardless of relationship to the study drugs. Notably, AEs thought to be due to treatment with the study drug are still reported as AEs in this study. The following information will be collected for all Adverse

22 
STU102014 -019, Okuda, Form A3, Mod_15, 12 -05-18 (3)   Events:  
 
• Start and stop dates  
• Severity (See the Severity Grading section below)  
• CTCAE score   
• Relationship to study drugs (See the Association with the Study Drug below )  
• Action taken with study drugs  
• Treatment for the AE and outcomes  
 
Severity Grading 
For evaluation and reporting purposes, events will be graded by a numerical score according to 
their impact on the subject’s ability to perform daily activities as follows:  
  1 - Mild (causing no limitation of usual activities)  
  2 - Moderate (causing some limitation of usual activities)  
  3 - Severe (causing inability to carry out usual activiti es)  
 8.[ADDRESS_1234248] to their association with the use of the study drug. The classifications used include Not Related or Related.   8.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event means any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results 
in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience, requires 
participant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. An important medical event that may not result in death, be life-thr eatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a SAE, 
when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical / surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Notably, any 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18543], regardless of its nature, severity or etiology will be reported as an SAE. 
 SAEs 
are collected from signing of Informed Consent through week 144 /or EOS visit or early 
withdrawal/discontinuation visit.  8.[ADDRESS_1234249] submit to the FDA and all 
participating investigators in the study.  All PIs are responsible for ensuring that all SAEs are 
recorded on the CRF and are reported to respective IRBs.  
 
8.5 Withdrawal of Study Participants: 
The researchers may decide to withdraw the patient from the study if:  
•      The medical problem becomes worse 
•  The researchers believe that participation in the research is  no longer safe for the patient 
•  The researchers believe that other treatment may be more helpful 
•  The sponsor, IRB  or the FDA stops the research for the safety of the participants  
•  The sponsor cancels the research  
•  The patient is unable to keep appointments or to follow the researcher’s instructions

STU102014 -019, Okuda, Form A3, Mod_15, 12 -05-18 (3)   9.  DATA SAFETY MONITORING BOARD (DSMB)  
As Tecfidera is an approved FDA treatment for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, we do not 
anticipate any impediments to patient enrollment or significant adverse or serious adverse 
events.  As a result, no data safety advisory board is required during the study.  
 10.  INFORMED CONSENT  
The informed consent form must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_1744]. All revisions of the protocol must be reflected in the consent form and reviewed by [CONTACT_1201]. Obtaining informed consent is 
more than obtaining a signature [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a form. It is a process designed to:  
• Provide the participant with current and ongoi ng information about the study  
• Ensure the participant understands the information that has been presented and has an opportunity to ask questions   
• Discuss the participant’s rights as outlined in the consent form  
• Allow the participant the opportunity to agree or disagree to take part in the study, and  
• Allow the participant the opportunity to freely withdraw from the study in the future. The 
investigator or coordinator should discuss in detail with the potentially eligible subjects about the nature, aims, duration, potential hazards of the study, and procedures to be 
performed during the study. The investigator or coordinator will explain all aspects of the 
study in lay language and answer all of the candidate's questions regarding the study. The investigator must also explain that the participants are completely free to refuse to enter the study or to withdraw from it at any time. The written informed consent form should be signed and personally dated and timed by [CONTACT_2299]. Participants receive a copy of the informed consent form. The original copy of the signed and dated consent 
form should be kept in the participant’s source document file and a copy should be 
scanned into the patient’s medical record. Subjects who refuse to participate should be treated without prejudice.  
• Should be obtained prior to any study -related procedures  
 11.  DATA REVIEW AND DATABASE MANAGEMENT Clinical and radiographic  information will 
be transmitted to Core Clinical Unit via secure FTP – MOVEit DMZ.  
Quintiles will provide for support related to data management, safety management, and project management. Data should be entered into eCRF (Oracle Inform) within 7 days of the visit, except: Day [ADDRESS_1234250] with the result of the trial (which represents here the likelihood). The prior distribution for the effect of Tecfidera vs. placebo was built using the data from DEFINE and CONFIRM trials in RRMS.  
 12.1.1 Parameter estimates for the rate of events in the RIS cohort in a Bayesian framework  
Version 8 /  , November 5, 2018 
24 
STU102014 -019, Okuda, Form A3, Mod_15, 12 -05-18 (3)   The parameters for the expected treatment effect of a 50% reduction in the risk of the first clinical 
event are HR=0.50 (i.e. logHR=-0.69). A SD for logHR is set to 2.2 to get a power  of 80% to detect 
a 50% reduction in the hazard of events with 80 patients per arm (original design). This base scenario is set in order to use the same assumptions done as for the original calculations.  Several scenarios were considered to allow a sensitivity analysis for the power calculations.  
 12.1.2 Parameters for the prior distribution – Scenario 1 
 The 2 arms treated with Tecfidera are pooled together (i.e. same efficacy)  
Patients from DEFINE and CONFIRM are classified as “early RRMS” if they had:  
 - No previous treatment 
 - Less than 5 years from disease onset 
 - EDSS≤1.[ADDRESS_1234251] in the “Early” group (HR=0.24, risk reduction=76%)  logHR= -1.45; SE=0.31. 
Treatment effect in the rest of RRMS (HR=0.59, risk reduction 41%) 
 The parameters of the prior distribution, according to the Tecfidera effect in early RRMS in the DEFINE+CONFIRM studies, are: mean=-1.45, SD=0.31.   
12.1.3 Parameters for the prior distribution – Scenario 2 
 
The 2 arms treated with Tecfidera are pooled together (i.e. same efficacy)  
We take the Tecfidera effect form the merged trials: HR=0.58, risk reduction=42%; logHR=-0.548; SE=0.073. 
 
The parameters of the prior distribution, according to the Tecfidera effect all the patients included in the DEFINE+CONFIRM studies, are:  mean=-0.548, SD=0.073.

The 2 arms treated with Tecfidera are pooled together (i.e. same efficacy)  
We take the Tecfidera effect form the merged trials: HR=0.58, risk reduction=42%  
We assume the treatment effect on the RIS cohort to be reduced by 20% since there is a portion 
of RIS that are not subclinical MS.   HR=0.58*1.20 =0.70 
logHR=-0.36  
mean=-0.36, SD=0.073.   12.1.5 Parameters for the prior distribution – Scenario 4 
 
The 2 arms treated with Tecfidera are pooled together (i.e. same efficacy)  
We take the Tecfidera effect form the merged trials: HR=0.58, risk reduction=42%; SE=0.[ADDRESS_1234252] on the RIS cohort to be reduced by 30% since there is a portion of RIS that are not subclinical MS.  
  
HR=0.58*1.30 =0.75; logHR=-0.282; mean=-0.282, SD=0.073

STU102014 -019, Okuda, Form A3, Mod_15, 12 -05-18 (3)   We report here the different power estimates for a sample size of 80 RIS patients (40 per 
arm) according to the 4 scenarios and 4 different assumptions on SD (representing those 
observed multiplied by 2, 3, 4 and 5).

 Overall, the power analysis shows that the projected sample size of [ADDRESS_1234253] demyelinating event (acute or initial symptom resulting in a progressive clinical course) or new MRI focus  utilizing Kaplan-Meier survival analyses.  Log-rank tests will be 
used to compare survival data between groups at univariate analysis.  Multivariate Bayesian Cox 
regression models will be created to assess the independent predictive value of demographic characteris tics (i.e. sex, ethnicity, age at the time of RIS diagnosis), clinical data (i.e. MS family 
history, occult neurological examination findings, environmental exposure data, CSF profiles ,

covariate with time to the first clinical symptom will be quantified by [CONTACT_882445] (HR) along with 
their 95% confidence intervals (CI).  Assessments to determine differences between centers will 
also be performed with statistical adjustments planned for subsequent analyses depending upon the obtained results.  Corrections to co-variables will be made when necessary if baseline differences are detected.  13.  TIMELINE ESTIMATE  
• Contracting completion to IRB approval:  7 months  
• Last patient in: September 30, 2019 
• Last patient out: March 31, 2021 
• Study completion and submission of final manuscript for publication:  September 1, 2021  
 14.  BIOMARKER ASSES SMENTS  
Whole blood samples  and cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF)  for biomarker analysis may be collected 
from all subjects  and transferred to UT Southwestern biorepository . A portion of the biosamples 
will be stored at -80
oC prior to being shipped on dry ice to Biogen in batches every quarter where 
they will be centrally analyzed.  
 
• Whole blood may be collected at week 0, week  48, week 96, week 144/or EOS, , Early 
Withdrawal and at relapse. 
• CSF may be collected at week 0, week 48, week 96, and week 144/or EOS.  
 
A total of approximately 400mL (25-27-30 tablespo ons) of whole blood may be collected for the 
scheduled visits. Approximately 71 mL (5 tablespoons) of whole blood may be collected at each 
relapse or early withdrawal . 
 
Those subjects who are unable or unwilling to contribute CSF samples will still be included in the 
study.  Failure to acquire CSF will not be considered a protocol deviation.   
 
The samples collected may be utilized to identify or verify putative prognostic and predictive 
markers associated with disease and markers of therapeutic response to DMF treatment. 
Baseline and dynamic (on-study) clinical disease characteristics and associated biomarker data may be utilized to predict subsequent disease worsening (severity), identify high-risk patient 
subgroups, and identify predictors of response to DMF treatment. 
 
Specifically, whole blood , collected in EDTA coated and PAXgene tubes, and CSF, collected in 
PAXgene tubes, will be collected  for future analysis of DNA, RNA, and protein biomarkers, as 
follows:  
• Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from whole blood collected at Baseline may be used for an exploratory pharmacogenomics analysis. Experience with treatment in MS shows that there is heterogeneity in clinical response, and some of the heterogeneity may be associated with genetic variants in patients. Genome-wide studies have identified 
approximately 50 single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as MS -associated loci. DNA 
may be used for genome-wide or candidate gene SNP analysis. Allelic variants at SNP 
loci will be tested for association with efficacy and treatment response.  
• Ribonucleic acid (RNA) from whole blood and CSF cell pellet may be used for analysis of 
gene expression. RNA may be used for genome-wide or candidate gene expression studies. The transcriptional profile will be used to understand the heterogeneity and to define the sub-structure of the MS patient population. Additionally, potential predictive

STU102014 -019, Okuda, Form A3, Mod_15, 12 -05-18 (3)   markers at Baseline through identification of transcript pattern that may predict 
disease/treatment outcome may be assessed.  
• Serum and CSF samples may be used to determine the levels of markers of inflammation, pro- and anti -inflammatory cytokines related to T helper 1 (Th1)/Th2 and 
Th17 pathways, chemokines, and other proteins known to play a role in the transmigration of leukocytes and neurodegeneration. This targeted protein list is not all encompassing and may be expanded to include markers related to disease, efficacy or mechanism of action of DMF as more knowledge becomes available. 
• In addition, serum and CSF samples will be stored for future exploratory analyses  at UT 
Southwestern.

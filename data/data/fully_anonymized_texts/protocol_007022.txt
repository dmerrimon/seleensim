1. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
Post-operative delirium (POD), commonly encountered after surgery,[ADDRESS_703156] attributable to delirium is estimated between $143 and $[ADDRESS_703157] -
operative delirium (POD). Sleep deprivation, which is associated with increased pro -inflammatory cytokine levels 
including interleukin -6,4-[ADDRESS_703158], 2017 . We identified 1,238 
citations (328 studies in the MEDLINE database (PubMed), 939 in EMBASE, 86 in CINAHL, 266 in Web of 
Science and 76 in the Cochrane Library Database), and  included [ADDRESS_703159] -surgery but before the onset of delirium,35 39 4 0 and one study assessed sleep 
disorder occurring after the onset of delirium.31 Five studies evaluated orthopedic surgeries,30 34 36 37 39 four studies 
evaluated cardiac surgeries29 31 33 35 and others evaluated thoracic and non -cardiac surgeries.32 38 40 Eight studies 
utilized the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), a standardized evidence -based tool, 20, 21 to diagnose 
delirium ;29 30 32 -35 38 39 two studies used the Diagnosis and Statistical Manual of Men tal Disorders (DSM -IV);31 40 
and two studies utilized patient chart records and information obtained from caregivers to diagnose delirium.36 37 
We excluded cross -sectional studies, case reports and studies n ot reported in English language .

Version:  11/05/2018  Pooled Analysis  Summary  
  A total of 1,199 patients and 244 cases of 
delirium were analyzed. We found that the pooled 
odds ratio for the association between sleep 
disturbance and POD was 5.24 (95% CI: 3.61 to 
7.60, p <0.001; I2=0.0%, p=0.76). The pooled odds 
ratio for the association between pre -delirium sleep 
disturbance and POD of 5.24 (95% CI: 3.61 to 7.60, 
p <0.001; I2=0.0%, p=0.76; Fig 2b) was statistically 
significant. The odds ratio associated with 
obstructive sleep apnea and unspecified types of 
sleep disorder were 4.75 (95% CI: 2.65 to 8.54, p 
<0.001; I2=0.0%, p=0.85), and 5.60 (95% CI: 3.46 to 
9.07, p <0.001; I2=0.0%, p=0.41), respectively. We 
conducted a s ensitivity analysis using risk ratios 
obtained from the prospective studies, 29 30 32 -34 42 and 
found that the pooled risk ratio for the associatio n 
between sleep disturbance and POD of 2.90 (95% 
CI: 2.28 to 3.69, p <0.001; I2=0.0%, p=0.89; Fig 5) 
was significant.  
 
Evans et al., in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_539469] , 
found that diminished sleep time and increased sleep latency on POD  [ADDRESS_703160] actigraphy or the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (PSQI) to evaluate sleep disturbance. 
Unfortunately, the use of actigraphy or the  PSQI in isolation do not provide accurate details on sleep quality or 
microstructure  dynamics of sleep  such as slow-delta oscillations, sleep spi[INVESTIGATOR_86853] s, K-complexes or REM alpha 
oscillations . These dynamics, which may aid the pre -emptive identification of patients that are prone to 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_539470], can be obtained using a portable sleep polysomnography  (PSG)  device .  
 
Therefore, we aim to study  the association between preoperative sleep distur bance and POD. Our central 
hypothesis is that preexisting sleep dysfunction will correlate  with incidence of POD.  To enable assessment of 
objective sleep quality metrics, o ur cohort will be comprised of patients admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_539471]. We will perform cognitive  and delirium  assessments , polysomnography  and blood sample collection  
peri-operatively . Additionally, previous research has demonstrated a clear link between infection and sleep 
apnea. Thus, we will track subjects’ postoperative infection rates in order to assess the generalizability of this 
outcome to sleep disturbance overall.   At the concl usion of this study , we will have expanded our knowledge of 
the pathophysiology of POD . 
 
2. SPECIFIC AIMS  
The specific aims of this study are:  
 
AIM 1: To use PSG and a validated sleep questionnaire to characterize sleep quality in POD patients  
Hypothesis 1.1. POD will be associated with significantly decreased pre -operative total sleep time  
Hypothesis 1.2 . POD will be associated with a pre -existing history of sleep disruption as measured by [CONTACT_95584][INVESTIGATOR_539472]  (PSQI)  
 
AIM 2: To use serum profiling to understand the association between POD and circadian disruption  
Hypothesis 2. 1. POD  will be associated with decreased am  mRNA transcript levels of clock genes ( Bmal1, Clock, 
Per1 and Per2) .

Treatment Assignment and Randomization:  Not applicable.  
 
5. Study Design  
Pre-operative Visit: We will obtain a written consent prior to conducting the Long -CAM, PSQI, Patient Health 
Questionnaire (PHQ -9), Trust in Physician Scale (TPS)  and the abbreviated Montreal cognitive assessment. 
Next, we will  place  a portable PSG device at approximately [ADDRESS_703164] neurophysiological data using the 
Compumedics Portable PSG monitoring device.  Due to clinical care concerns, patient acuity, patient 
unavailability and several other unforeseen factors, PSG may not be placed on all study subjects . A minimum of 
the following electrodes will be placed for sleep staging: Two central channels (C3 and C 4), two electrooculogram 
channels to capture lateral eye movements, and two reference channels over the left and right mastoids.  
 
Post-operative Day 0: PSG electrodes will be removed at approximately 6am. Additionally, we will obtain 
approximately 13ml of  blood to be processed into mRNA to understand the association between peri -operative 
circadian cycle disruption of four circadian clock genes (Bmal1, Clock, Per1 and Per2)  and POD. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_539474] -identification procedures are in place for the collection and storage of 
blood. All MGH ORs are equipped with a four -channel frontal EEG device (Sedline, Masimo, Irvine, CA). Thus, 
we will collect intraoperative routine EEG data that is recorded as part of routine anesth etic management. Due 
to clinical care concerns, patient acuity, Sedline electrode unavailability and several other unforeseen factors, 
blood and Sedline EEG data may not be obtained on all study subjects .    
 
Post-operative Days 1 -3: On post -operative day 1, we will obtain approximately 13ml  of blood as a post -surgical 
measure of mRNA  levels  to understand the association between peri -operative circadian cycle disruption of four 
5 | P a g e  
Version:  11/05/2018  circadian clock genes (Bmal1, Clock, Per1 and Per2)  and POD.  Delirium assessments may be conducted twice 
daily (AM and PM with at least 6 hours between tests) beginning on postoperative day 1 using the Long 
Confusion Assessment Method (CAM).[ADDRESS_703165]  finds it diffic ult to complete an assessment (i.e. pain, 
clinical intervention), only the long -CAM domains necessary to dispel the presence of delirium will be assessed 
(i.e. acute onset, inattention, disorganized thinking and altered level of consciousness). Subjects  who cannot 
complete this shortened assessment will be re -approached several hours later. Long -CAM assessments for 
subjects  who are reintubated for clinical care or for further surgical management will be considered missing data.  
 
Post-operative Day 30: PHQ -9 and the Pain Interference 8a (PROMIS SF v1.0) questionnaires will be 
administered over the phone.  Subjects’ infection rates will also be tracked postoperatively.  
 
6. DATA ANALYSIS PLAN  
Hypothesis tests will be performed using a two -sided significance level (type I error) of α=0.05. Aim 1  
(Hypotheses 1 and 2) outcome will be evaluated using binominal regression models  with adaptive elastic net 
penalty to examine  the association between total sleep time  and POD. P atient characteristics of interest (i.e. 
age, gender, baseline cognitive score, pain, depression symptom score, frailty index, Charlson comorbidity 
index ) will be included into this regression model . Because missing data rarely occur entirely at random,  we will 
assess associations between patient characteristics with respect to missing data. If patients with at least one 
missing outcome value are different from those with complete outcomes data, we wi ll use multiple imputation to 
assign values to missing data risk factors and outcomes in regression modeling.  Aim 2 (Hypothesis 1) Wilcoxon 
rank-sum tests with correction s for multiple comparisons will be used to assess differences for each analyte or 
transcript. In other explo ratory analysis, we will assess differences in the EEG (PSG and intraoperative) 
dynamics of delirious and non -delirious patients.  To assess statistical significance for the difference in EEG 
spectra at each frequency, we will compute the 99% confidence interval of the median difference between groups 
by [CONTACT_539484][INVESTIGATOR_539475]. The null hypothesis will be rejected only if the confidence interval of 
the median difference at each frequency exceeds the significance threshold  over a contiguous frequency range 
≥ 2W.  We will also characterize  differences in sleep microstructure dynamics  (i.e. spi[INVESTIGATOR_539476], spi[INVESTIGATOR_539477], 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_539478], slow -delta phase - spi[INVESTIGATOR_539479])  between groups using algorithms 
developed in -house.  
 
7. POWER ANALYSIS  
The primary objective of this trial is to detect a difference in the duration of sleep  between deliriou s and non-
delirious patients . Assuming a delirium event rate of 15%, a type I error of 0.05, power of 0.90 and a SD of 60 
minutes, n = [ADDRESS_703166] an absolute total 
sleep time difference of 60 minutes between bot h groups  (i.e., 360 minutes versus 300 minutes). Therefore, 
anticipating a dropout rate of approximately 10%,  we aim to recruit 100  subjects . 
 
8. RISK AND DISCOMFORT  
PSG risks : The risks associated with PSG electrodes are redness, irritation at placement site, unpleasant odor 
from glue, and annoyance from having electrodes attached to the body.  
Questionnaire risks:  Minimal risks associated with completing questionnaires are subject fatigue and the 
possibility of minor psychological distress associated wit h answering  sensitive questions regarding psychological 
functioning.  
Data risks:  Procedures are in place to reduce the likelihood of a breach of confidentiality including the de -
identification of data and storage of data only on partners approved devices/p ortals. However, there is a small 
risk that people outside of this study may be exposed to information about study subjects.

Version:  11/05/[ADDRESS_703167] of the study 
is in compliance wit h the approved protocol and amendments.  
 
Serious Adverse Events:  Expedited review will occur for all events meeting the FDA definition of SAEs – i.e., 
any fatal event, immediately life -threatening event, permanently or substantially disabling event, event  requiring 
or prolonging inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or any congenital anomaly. This also includes any event that a study 
investigator judges to impose a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution.  Reporting to the 
IRB will be done wi thin 24 hours of the SAE.  
 
Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]:  If at any time during the course of the study, the PI s or CO -Is judge that risk to subjects 
outweighs  the potential benefits, the PI/CO -Is shall have the discretion and responsibility to recommend that the 
study be terminated.  
  
AE Reporting Guidelines : Unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others including adverse events 
will be reported  to the PHRC in accordance with PHRC unanticipated problems including adverse events

3 BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND RATIONALE  
3.1 Introduction  
The Cochlear ™ Osia®2 System was cleared by [CONTACT_75541] 15, 2019 
(K191921) for individuals aged 12 years and older who present with conductive or mixed hearing loss (up to 
55 dB HL) or single -sided -deafness (SSD). Published and unpublished data suggest significant pre to 
postoperative benefit and minimal risk in both children and adults who have received the Osia system. Due to 
the success of the Osia [ADDRESS_82108] since requested the ability to use the Osia 2 system in children aged 11 years and younger who 
meet the audiometric requirements. As the Osia 2 system is based on existing bone conduction and cochlear 
implant technologies which each possess a  younger age of implantation requirement (5 years for bone 
conduction and 9 months for cochlear implantation), the current proposal is to align the age at implantation 
requirement with existing surgical bone conduction technology such as the Baha Connect a nd Baha Attract 
Systems to 5 years of age. Therefore, the objective of this study is to examine the safety and effectiveness of 
the Cochlear Osia 2 system in a group of pediatric subjects aged 5 to 11 years who suffer from conductive or 
mixed hearing loss (up to 55 dB HL), or single -sided -deafness (SSD) with the intent of expanding the 
indications for use.

Goycoolea et. al. 2020 reported on a cohort of 9 subjects with conductive or mixed hearing loss (8 adults and 
1 child)  who met the study inclusion criteria. Subjects were fit and evaluated with a Baha [ADDRESS_82110] (HINT).  Patient reported outcomes were captured using the SSQ -[ADDRESS_82111] 10 
[LOCATION_008] patients. Five females and five males participated with a mean age of 52 years (range 30 – 
78) who presented with either mixed (n = 5) or conductive hearing losses (n = 3) or single sided deafness (n = 
2). All subjects had prior hearing aid experience and were fit with a Baha [ADDRESS_82112] implantation.  Additionally, when the subjects were segmented into the three different 
audiological indications, the mean gain was + 86.5 dB (range 79 –94, SD = 10.6) for single -sided deafness, + 31 
dB (range 12 –48, SD =  17.3) for mixed and + 22 dB (range 12 –31, SD = 9.5) for conductive. The mean 
functional gain improvement for the study population was +39.[ADDRESS_82113] -surgery. 
In addition to objective assessments of outcome, patient -reported outcomes measured by [CONTACT_75542] (COSI) indicated that being able to hear well in real -life situations as well as a 
decrease in hearing aid disability were significant findings.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Data from Non -Published Studies  
Cochlear sponsored a pediatric, newly implanted, prospecti ve, ITA clinical trial (Cochlear CAM5706, ITA#

to support a change in indications for use reducing the age at implantation to 5 years of age.     
4 MEDICAL DEVICE  INFORMATION  
4.1 Identity and Description of the Investigational Medical Device (IMD)  
The Osia 2 System is composed of the following components: the Osia Implant (OSI200); BI300 implant; and 
the Osia 2 Sound Processor.  The Osia implant consists of a receiver/coil and an  actuator/stimulator which is 
surgically implanted on the skull bone  via a bone conduction implant surgery  performed by a surgical 
physician trained in otolaryngology . The Osia implant connects to the BI300 implant which is secured within 
the skull bone.  The Osia Sound Processor is an off -the-ear device, which pi[INVESTIGATOR_75522], and sends the information to the implant via a transcutaneous inductive link. This link is also 
referred to as radiofrequency (RF) link. Each Osia System is c onfigured to meet an individual’s hearing needs, 
using dedicated fitting software. Because the device is commercially cleared , devices will not be labelled as 
investigational. The external components shall  be worn full -time during waking hours. The Osia Sy stem is 
illustrated in Figure 1 below.  
Figure 1: Overview of the Osia System, including the Osia Sound Processor  
In normal operation, the Osia System functions as follows (Figure 1):  
1. The external sound processor captures and digitally processes sound.  
2. The sound processor transmits power and digital information to the implant coil/receiver.  
3. The implant stimulator/actuator converts the digital information into an electric analogue signal that 
is converted to vibrations by [CONTACT_75544][INVESTIGATOR_75523] a ctuator.

4. This implant is fixed to the bone by [CONTACT_75545]300 implant.  
The actuator converts the electrical signal into an amplified mechanical stimulation, by[CONTACT_75546] (origin of the conductive part of the hearing loss) and providing so me level of mechanical 
amplification in order to compensate for the damaged inner ear (sensorineural part of the hearing loss, in 
case of mixed hearing loss).   
Devices are manufactured by [CONTACT_75547]. For additional device information refer to the Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB) and Instructions for Use (IFU) documents.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Informed Consent  
Informed consent and assent , as applicable,  will be obtained as outlined in section [ADDRESS_82136].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Unaided Audiometric Testing  
Unaided audiometric thresholds will be obtained for each ear independently, using the standard audiometric 
technique for pure -tone air and bone conduction testing preopera tively to establish candidacy for 
participation in the clinical investigation.  
• Air Conduction:  500, 1000, 2000, 3000 & 4000Hz  
Hearing thresholds that exceed the air conduction limits of the audiometer, where the participant reports 
feeling the acoustic  stimuli, shall be recorded as vibrotactile (VT). Appropriate masking will be employed 
where required.  
• Bone conduction: 500, 1000, 2000, 3000 & 4000Hz  
Where the participant reports feeling rather than hearing the acoustic stimuli, the response shall be r ecorded 
as vibrotactile (VT). Appropriate masking will be employed where required.  
For participants with conductive or mixed hearing loss, the bone conduction PTA will be captured and 
rounded to the nearest whole number  to document audiometric eligibility.  For participants with single -sided 
deafness (SSD), the air conduction PTA will be captured and rounded to the nearest whole number  to 
document audiometric eligibility.

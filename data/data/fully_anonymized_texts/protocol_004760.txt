 3 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS AND RESEARCH SUMMARY  
3.1 Purpose  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_791555] (VTE) among women with advanced ovarian cancer receiving NACT.  
 
Primary Objectives:  
1. To determine the efficacy of low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_791556] . 
2. To determine the safety of low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_791557] . 
3. To determine medication adherence with the use of low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_791558].  
 
Hypotheses  
1. Hypothesis -testing  
2. Use of daily low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_791559].  
3. Use of daily low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_791560].  
3.2   Background and Significance 
 
VTE is a known potential complication of malignancy and is particularly common among women with 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_76296] (EOC).[1,2] In addition to having active cancer, women with EOC are predisposed to other well -established risk factors for VTE, including impaired mobility, increasing age, and advanced 
disease.[3] The risk of VTE  is even greater among patients with clear cell histology, thrombocytosis, high grade 
tumors, and co -morbid cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., obesity, hypertension, diabetes).[4-7 ] In a recent study 
at our institution, we found that women with advanced ovarian cancer receiving NACT are at high risk for  VTE 
with an incidence of nearly 8% .[8] 
 
Importantly, the occurrence of VTE among patients with EOC is associated with increased mor bidity, 
decreased survival, and increased healthcare costs .[9-11] Timely interval debulking surgery and the ability to 
achieve of optimal surgical debulking also remain critical components of care for advanced EOC. In the 
aforementioned study, we observed that the average time from start of NACT  to interval debulking surgery 
was longer for patients who experienced a VTE during NACT as compared to those who had not; these 
patients were also less likely to have their disease optimally debulked at the time of interval surgery. The high 
incidence of VTE during NACT reported in our study as well as the associated morbidity contributes to a 
growing body of evidence suggesting that thromboprophylaxis during NACT is warranted.  
 
According to the current guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology, thromboprophylaxis 
with either api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], rivaroxaban, or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is recommended for high risk ambulatory cancer patients (defined as a Khorana score greater than or equal to 2) receiving systemic 
chemotherapy. Patients with a primary gynecologic malignancy receive one point in the Khorana score at 
baseline, and the majority of ovarian cancer patients would meet criteria for an additional point. High risk 
Khorana scores defined as [ADDRESS_1091403] a 6.7 -7.1% risk of VTE  which is similar to the incidence defined in 
the previously described study of patients receiving NACT for advanced EOC . These patients are therefore 
considered high risk for adverse thromboembolic events when initiating systemic chemotherapy.

 Considering the above recommended agents, our recent institutional data (unpublished) demonstrated 
that api[INVESTIGATOR_791561] a cost-effective strategy among women with ovarian cancer receiving NACT specifically, 
and insur ance coverage of api[INVESTIGATOR_791562]. A query of 
medical oncologists affiliated with the Duke Cancer Institute revealed that the majority of providers are generally not initiating direct oral anticoagulants despi[INVESTIGATOR_791563]. LMWH, another alternative 
injectable agent, is expensive and poorly tolerated by [CONTACT_791610].  
 Low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], in contrast, is an oral agent and performed better than api[INVESTIGATOR_791564]. It is also already used off-
label for a broad range of clinical indications, including as an acceptable alternative for thromboprophylaxis 
amo ng patients with multiple myeloma receiving antiangiogenesis agents with chemotherapy and/or 
dexamethasone as well as for postoperative prophylaxis after select orthopedic procedures. We therefore hypothesized that low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_791565] a safe and effective method of thromboprophylaxis for women 
with advanced ovarian cancer receiving NACT. 
 
The above ASCO guidelines were subsequently endorsed by [CONTACT_791611] 2021. Thus initiation of thromboprophylaxis with api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], rivaroxaban, or LMWH is 
recommended for high risk ambulatory gynecologic cancer patients receiving chemotherapy with a Khorana score ≥ 2. Interim analysis of the initial [ADDRESS_1091404] with a KS equal to 1 may also be at risk of a VTE given the high incidence previously 
documented, and although not candidates for DOAC therapy, may potentially benefit from initiation of low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_791566] 15  
  
3.3   Design and Procedure 
 
Subjects with advanced EOC (including primaries of ovarian, Mullerian, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], or peritoneal origin) will 
be screened for eligibility at Duke Gynecology Oncology clinic visits prior to initiation of NACT . Selection criteria are 
detailed in a subsequent section. Once determined eligible, a provider will approach the patient and inquire about 
interest in participating in the study. If the patient desires to receive more information, clinical research personnel 
will discuss the study with patient and obtain informed consent if all selection criteria are met (detailed in a 
subsequent  section). If the research team is unable to meet with a patient face to face but the patient is interested 
in participating, the same process will be facilitated via telephone once secure identifiers are met. If the patient consents, they will then be considered an enrolled study subject. Electronic consent will be performed in REDcap.  
Following enrollment, basic demographic information for each patient will be recorded in a secure REDCap database. Specific demographic data and security concerns are further outlined in a later section.  
 
Patients will be enrolled and will receive aspi[INVESTIGATOR_791567]. All study activities will be 
performed by [CONTACT_58041], so we do not anticipate needing assistance from the Duke Raleigh 
study team.  
 
The primary selection criterion is a Khorana score of 1; additional criteria are detailed in a subsequent 
section. The Khorana score will be calculated according to the following parameters in closest proximity to 
the first cycle of chemotherapy: 1 point for gynecologic cancer, 1 point for BMI ≥35, 1 point for Hgb <10 or use of red blood cell growth factors, 1 point for leukocyte count > 11,000, and 1 point for platelets 
≥350,000. Patients therefore have a baseline Khorana score of [ADDRESS_1091405] the option to remain on study and complete their aspi[INVESTIGATOR_791568] a 
Pro00105081:  Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_791552]:  5/12/[ADDRESS_1091406] already completed their 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_791569]  "on follow up" will remain on study.  
 
Once enrolled in the study, subjects will receive a [ADDRESS_1091407] of care performed by [CONTACT_4677]’s provider prior to in itiation of an additional cycle of NACT. Different patients may undergo  different 
numbers of NACT cycles, and thus the 30- day supply of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_791570] a member of the research team 
when the decision is made to proceed with an additional cycle.  
 
Participants who experience clinically significant adverse drug events such as bleeding or medication 
intolerance will be withdrawn from the st udy. Subjects with significant chemotherapy -induced thrombocytopenia 
(platelet count less than 50,000) will be instructed to stop taking daily aspi[INVESTIGATOR_87458] [ADDRESS_1091408]  for advanced EOC (including primaries of ovarian, Mullerian, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], or 
peritoneal origin)  will be recruited from the Duke Gynecology Oncology clinics and will be screened for 
eligibility by a member of the research team. Sarasota Memorial Health Care System has been added as an 
additional site for this study and will also recruit patients. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are detailed in a subsequent section. 
 
3.5   Duration of study 
 
Participants will be included in the study from the time of enrollment through the day of their interval debulking surgery or completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (for those who will not undergo surgery). The 
duration of the study will vary depending on the number of cycles participants undergo, but approximately [ADDRESS_1091409] Statistician: Gloria Broadwater, MS  
 
The goal for initiating accrual into thi s study will be September  1st, 2020. Patients will continue to be enrolled 
through December 30th , 2021. Subjects will be followed through the primary NACT  treatment course until  interval 
debulking surgery, with an estimated duration of 6 -9 months following enrollment depending on the number of 
Pro00105081:  Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_791552]:  5/12/[ADDRESS_1091410] clinical data for the 
predetermined follow up period.  
 
We will calculate the incidence of VTE during the study period defined above (enrollment to interval debulking 
surgery or 1 week after completion of the primary neoadjuvant chemotherapy course if debulking surgery is deferred) and estimate a 95% exact binomial confidence interval. Since this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the incidence of venous 
thromboembolism in the study population will be compared to a historical control from a previous research study of the incidence of venous thromboembolism among women receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for advanced 
ovarian cancer in which the majority of patients were from Duke. A drop greater than 20% (from approximately 8% to 6.4%) in the rate of venous thromboembolism would be considered clinically meaningful. We will also mon itor 
for adverse safety events related to low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34308], including major or minor bleeding events, gastrointestinal complications , and medication intolerance (side effects or adverse reaction). Further detail 
regarding AE monitoring and reporting is  outlined in a later section.  Finally, we will calculate medication adherence 
and correlation with patient- reported measures in Voils DOSE -Nonadherence measure quesitonnaires.

5 BACKGROUN D AND SIGNIFICANCE  
5.1 Study Condition  
 
In a recent study at our institution, we found that women with advanced ovarian cancer (including 
primaries of ovarian, Mullerian, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], or peritoneal origin)  receiving neoadjuvant  chemotherapy 
(NACT) are at high risk for VTE with an incidence of nearly 8% .[8]  
 
Importantly, the occurrence of VTE among patients with EOC is associated with increased morbidity, 
decreased survival, and increased healthcare costs .[9-11] Timely interval debulking surgery and the ability to 
achieve of optimal surgical debulking also remain critical components of care for advanced EOC. In the 
aforementioned study, we observed that the average time from start of NACT  to interval debulking surgery 
was longer for patients who experienced a VTE during NACT as compared to those who had not; these 
patients were also less likely to have their disease optimally debulked at the time of interval surgery. The high incidence of VTE during NACT reported in our study as well as the associated morbidity contributes to a 
growing body of evidence suggesting that thromboprophylaxis during NACT is warranted; there is currently no standard of care alternative for thromboprophylaxis during NACT.

 5.3 Study Purpose/Rationale 
 
As previously described, the incidence of VTE during NACT among women with advanced ovarian cancer is 
nearly 8%. Venous thromboembolic events are as sociated with increased morbidity, cost, and possibly a 
longer time to interval debulking surgery, which is a critical component of treatment for advanced ovarian 
cancer. Reducing the incidence of venous thromboembolism would therefore have a positive impa ct both on 
individual patients and on the healthcare system at large.  
 
At present, our institution does not utilize any thromboprophylaxis during NACT for advanced ovarian 
cancer  (including primaries of ovarian, Mullerian, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], or peritoneal origin) . According to the current 
guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology, thromboprophylaxis with either api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], rivaroxaban, or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is recommended for high risk ambulatory cancer 
patients (defined as a Khorana score greater than or equal to 2) receiving systemic chemotherapy. Patients 
with a primary gynecologic malignancy receive one point in the Khorana score at baseline, and the majority of 
ovarian cancer patients would meet criteria for an additional point. High risk Khorana scores defined as [ADDRESS_1091412] a 6.7 -7.1% risk of VTE which is similar to the incidence defined in the previously described study 
of patients receiving NACT for advanced EOC. These patients are therefore considered high risk for adverse thromboembolic events when initiating systemic chemotherapy.  
 Considering the above recommended agents, our recent institutional data (unpublished) demonstrated 
that api[INVESTIGATOR_791561] a cost- effective strategy among women with ovarian cancer receiving NACT specifically, 
and insurance coverage of api[INVESTIGATOR_791562]. In addition, a query of medical oncologists affiliated with the Duke Cancer Institute revealed that the majority of 
providers are generally not initiating direct oral anticoagulants despi[INVESTIGATOR_791563]. LMWH, another 
alternative injectable agent, is also expensive and poorly tolerated by [CONTACT_791612]. Low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], in contrast, is an oral agent and performed better than 
api[INVESTIGATOR_791582]. In 
addition, l ow dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_791583] -label  as an acceptable alternative for thr omboprophylaxis among 
low risk patients with multiple myeloma receiving antiangiogenesis agents with chemotherapy and/or dexamethasone as well as for postoperative prophylaxis after some orthopedic procedures.  As previously 
mentioned, there is no alternative agent routinely used for prevention of VTE among women with ovarian 
cancer receiving NACT.  
 
The above ASCO guidelines were subsequently endorsed by [CONTACT_791613] 
2021. Thus initiation of thromboprophylaxis with api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], rivaroxaban, or LMWH is recommended for high risk ambulatory gynecologic cancer patients receiving chemotherapy with a Khorana score ≥ 2. Interim analysis of the initial [ADDRESS_1091413] with a KS equal to 1 
may also be at risk of a VTE given the high incidence previously documented, and although not candidates for DOAC therapy, may potentially benefit from initiation of low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248].

Gynecology Oncology clinics at the Duke Cancer Center  and Macon Pond location (Duke Women’s Cancer Care 
Raleigh) or Sarasota Memorial Healthcare System . A provider will approach the patient and inquire about 
interest in participating in the study. If the patient desires to receive more information , clinical research 
personnel will discuss the study with the patient and obtain informed consent if all selection criteria are met 
(detailed in a prior section). If the patient consents, they will then be considered an enrolled study subject. Electronic consent will  be performed in REDcap. Following enrollment in the study, basic demographic

 care performed by [CONTACT_102]’s provider prior to ini tiation of an additional cycle of NACT. Different patients 
may receive dif ferent numbers of cycles, and thus the 30- day supply of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_791586] -filled when the 
decision is made to proceed with an additional cycle.  
This study will not impact standard of care treatment. The incidence of VTE will be calculated from the 
study population and compared with a historical control  from a similar population cohort . The incidence of 
adverse drug events will also be  monitored and reported as detailed in a subsequent section. 
3.1.1.  Dose Modification  
Not applicable  
3.1.2.  Safety Considerations  
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_33930] a well- established medication used routinely in a variety of clinical contexts. It is FDA -
approved for use as an antipyretic, anti -inflammatory, and analgesic medication  as well as for use 
following certain revascularization procedures (cardiac stent placement, e.g.). Low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_791587] -label uses, including for primary prevention of atherosclerotic disease, preeclampsia 
prevention, and for thromboprophylaxis. Specifically, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_791588].[12] Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_791589] -based chemotherapy and/or dexamethasone.[13]  
Since aspi[INVESTIGATOR_791590], the risks and side 
effects are well -established and primarily include medication intolerance, gastrointestinal complications, 
and adverse bleeding events.  Data regard ing bleeding events in the setting of limited duration low dose 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_791591]. In a retrospective study of low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_791592], the 90 -day bleeding rate was 0.52%.[14] 
Similarly, a systematic review of low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_791593]; the event rate for  major bleeding among patients receiving aspi[INVESTIGATOR_690231] 0.5% 
with a significant reduction in the incidence of bruising.[12]  
 
Patients receiving chemotherapy are already closely monitored in the outpatient setting with 
history, physical examination, and lab e valuations prior to every  NACT cycle. At each subsequent clinic 
visit for consideration of an additional NACT cycle, a member of the research team will review medication adherence diaries and AE symptom questionnaires. If symptoms are concerning for a pote ntial AE, the 
research team personnel will inquire further and discuss with the PI. Please see subsequent sections related to AE monitoring and reporting. No additional components of history and physical exam will be 
completed outside standard of care performed by [CONTACT_102]’s provider prior to initiation of an additional 
cycle of NACT. Different patients may receive different numbers of cycles, and thus the 30- day supply of 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_791586] -filled when the decision is made to proceed with an additional cycle.  
Any patient with medication intolerance or clinically significant bleeding will be withdrawn from the 
study to minimize harm. Patients who experience chemotherapy -related thrombocytopenia  with platelet 
count less than 50,000  will be monitored and asked to hold aspi[INVESTIGATOR_791594] 1 week until platelet 
counts normalize . A designated member of the research team will perform a cumulative review of

 adverse events every 3 months and determine if adverse event rates are greater than expected in this 
patient population.  
Performing a pi[INVESTIGATOR_791595] a historical control will help  delineate the feasibility of larger 
studies in the future. This approach mitigates  risk while also exploring the potential benefits for patients 
and the healthcare system overall. 
3.1.3.  Missed Doses  
Subjects will be asked to complete a medication adherence diary, but study analysis will occur in an intention-to-treat fashion. Thus there will be no consequences or alternative regimens for missed doses.  
3.1.4.  Concomitant Medications/Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_791596] (non-aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248])  antiplatelet agent for a specific 
indication (e.g., cardiac stent) will be excluded from this study. Subjects will be encouraged to disclose any 
other medications or supplements to their primary provider to  be reviewed for interactions with the 
study drug. Standard of care chemotherapy will not be altered in any way by [CONTACT_354430].  If subjects 
are already on low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_791597], they will still be eligible for the study but will be instructed to take the study drug such that adherence can be monitored.

As previously described, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_791598], anti -inflammatory, analgesic, and antiplatelet medication. It is also used off- label for 
postoperative thromboprophylaxis following total hip and total knee replacement and for 
thromboprophylaxis among low risk patients with multiple myeloma receiving thalidomide -based 
chemotherapy and/or dexamethasone. The dosing, regimen, and treatment duration were established in accordance with the guidelines for the aforementioned off-label uses to achieve an appropriate balance 
between safety and efficacy. In our study specifically, subjects will be instructed to take [ADDRESS_1091417]  treatment course.  
 
7.3 Rationale for Correlative Studies  
Not applicable.  
7.4 Definition of Evaluable Subjects, On Study, and End of Study

 10 TRIAL PROCEDURES AND ASSESSMENTS 
Eligible participants will be recruited from patients with advanced epi[INVESTIGATOR_76296] (including 
primaries of ovarian, Mullerian, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], or peritoneal origin ) who are initiating NACT  at the Duke 
Gynecology Oncology clinics at the Duke Cancer Center  and Macon Pond location (Duke Women’s Cancer Care 
Raleigh) or at Sarasota Memorial Healthcare System . A provider will approach the patient and inquire about 
interest in participating in the study. If the patient desires to receiv e more information, clinical research 
personnel will discuss the study with the patient and obtain informed consent if all selection criteria are met 
(detailed in a prior section). If the patient consents, they will then be considered an enrolled study subject. 
Electronic consent will be performed in REDcap. Following enrollment in the study, basic demographic 
information for each patient will be recorded in a secure REDCap database. The initial medical history and 
physical examination will be conducted per  standard of care by [CONTACT_102]’s provider at the clinic visit.  
 
Patients will be enrolled and will receive aspi[INVESTIGATOR_791567]. All study activities will 
be performed by [CONTACT_58041], so we do not anticipate needing assistance fr om the Duke 
Raleigh study team.  
An estimated 1 20 patients will receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer at Duke 
Gynecology Oncology clinics for the designated study recruitment period of 0 9/01/2020 to 12/30 /2021 with 
an estimated 5 0% accrual rate for a total of [ADDRESS_1091421] of 
care performed by [CONTACT_102]’s provider prior to initiation of an additional cycle of NACT. Different patients 
may receive different numbers of cycles, and thus the [ADDRESS_1091422] of care evaluation and documentation of the primary outcomes, including adverse drug events.

Pro00105081:  Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_791552]:  5/12/[ADDRESS_1091428] -Rated Measures at  Clinic Visits and/or in Daily Diaries  
Subjects will be asked to complete medication adherence diaries with each cycle of chemotherapy that 
will be evaluated by [CONTACT_5051]. Data from these diaries will be added to the REDCap database. An 
example is included in the appendix section 16.  Medication adherence diaries will also include a section in 
which subjects can detail symptoms or adverse events that may be related to use of the study drug. These will be reviewed by a member of the  study team at each clinic visit and additional inquiries made, if 
applicable, when the subject is seen by a member of the study team. At each clinic visit, subjects will also 
complete the Voils DOSE- Nonadherence questionnaire to evaluate medication adherence.

or evaluation of study assessments, w hether an AE or SAE has occurred.  
 
11.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject receiving study therapy and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  For this protocol, the definition of AE also 
includes worsening of any pre -existing medical condition.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended or worsening sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study ther apy, whether or not related to use of the study  therapy.  Abnormal 
laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the PI’s judgment) should not be recorded as AEs.  But laboratory value changes that require therapy or adjustment in prior therapy are considered adverse 
events. 
 
From the time the subject signs the informed consent form through the End of Study visit (as defined in Section 1 0.3), all AEs must be recorded in the subject medical record and adverse events case report form. 
 AEs will be assessed according to the CTCAE version 4.0.  If CTCAE grading does not exist for an AE, the severity 
of the AE will be graded as mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3), life -threatening (4), or fatal (5).  
 Attribution of AEs will be indicated as follows:  
- Definite:  The AE is clearly related to the study therapy  
- Probably:  The AE is likely related to the study therapy  
- Possible:  The AE may be related to the study therapy  
- Unlikely:  The AE is doubtfully related to the study therapy  
- Unrelated:  The A E is clearly NOT related to the study therapy  
7.1.1.   AEs of Special Interest  
Adverse events of special interest related to low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_791603]:  
- Major bleeding events (as defined by [CONTACT_791618], symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, or bleeding 
causing a decrease in hemoglobin of 2g/dL or more or leading to a transfusion of 2 or more units of blood)  
- Minor bleeding events (all other clinically significant bleeding events not a ddressed by [CONTACT_37405])  
- Medication intolerance  (defined as intolerable medication side effects or adverse 
medication reaction)  
7.1.2.   Reporting of AEs  
The study team, including PI, will be alerted in the event of an AE. AEs will be reported as required b y the 
Institutional Review Board as described above. 
11.2 Serious Adverse Events

 12 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
12.1 Monitoring  
 
This clinical research study will be monitored both internally by [CONTACT_978], and institutionally by [CONTACT_791620] (DCI). In terms of internal review the PI [INVESTIGATOR_33570]. 
Appropriate reporting to the Duke University Medical Center IRB will be made. If an unexpected frequency of 
Grade III or IV events occur, depending on their nature, action appropriate to the nature and frequency of these adverse events will be taken. This may require a protocol amendment, do se de -escalation, or potentially 
closure of the study. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_77998], data, and safety of this study to ensure that:  
 · Interim analyses occur as scheduled;  
· Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_9480]/or response are m et;  
· Risk/benefit ratio is not altered to the detriment of the subjects;  
· Appropriate internal monitoring of AEs and outcomes is done;  
· Over -accrual does not occur;  
· Under -accrual is addressed with appropriate amendments or actions;  
· Data are being appropr iately collected in a reasonably timely manner.  
·  
DCI Protocol Review and Monitoring systems (PRMS) review of this protocol begins with an initial review by [CONTACT_33665] (CPC). CPC new protocol review focuses on scientific relevance, study  design, 
adequacy of biostatistical input, protocol prioritization, feasibility of completing the study within a reasonable time frame and risk assessment of the trial. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_85531], which will 
determine the intensity of subsequent DCI monitoring. CPC also conducts annual scientific progress reviews on 
protocols that are open to enrollment and focus on protocol prioritization, accrual and scientific progress. 
These reviews are conducted at the time of IRB annual r enewals and documentation of all CPC reviews will be 
maintained in eIRB/iRIS systems.  
 A determination for the degree of monitoring conducted by [CONTACT_85554], phase, endpoints, degree of risk, 
size and complexity of the protocol. A formal, independent monitoring will be conducted by [CONTACT_791621] d 
to enrollment or subjects are no longer receiving study drug or other interventions that are more than minimal risk. Additional monitoring may be prompted by [CONTACT_12637], unexpected 
frequency of serious and/or unexpected toxicities, o r other concerns. Monitoring visits may also be initiated 
upon request by [CONTACT_33668], CPC, SOC, a sponsor, an investigator, or the IRB.  
 The DCI monitoring team reviews the adequacy of informed consent, enrollment of eligible patients, 
implem entation of protocol- specified procedures and treatment, adequacy of data collection, and 
appropriateness of adverse event monitoring and reporting. The DCI monitoring team presents final monitoring reports to the DCI Safety Oversight Committee (SOC) highlighting safety concerns and unresolved 
issues. The SOC, at a convened meeting, assigns an overall rating of satisfactory, marginal, or unsatisfactory to 
reflect the overall quality of data, regulatory, consent, eligibility, study conduct and AE reporting. Corrective 
action plans (CAPs) are developed, implemented, and evaluated as indicated. The SOC will notify the sponsor -
investigator and DUHS IRB when significant safety concerns are identified.  
 
The SOC in concert with DCI monitoring team conducts data and safety monitoring for DUHS sponsor -
investigator phase I and II, therapeutic interventional oncology studies that do not have an independent 
DSMB. These reviews occur at a minimum annually and more frequently for the high risk studies. The SOC 
safety reviews include review of safety data, enrollment status, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_12596], accrual, toxicities,

 reference literature, and interim analyses as provided by [CONTACT_456] -investigator. The SOC, at a convened 
meeting, assigns a rating of satisfactory when adequate accrual with lack of excessive toxicity is present.  
 
 
12.2 Data Management and Processing  
8.3.1.  Case Report Forms (CRFs)  
The electronic CRF in REDCap  will be the primary data collection document for the study.  The CRFs will be 
updated in a timely manner following acquisition of new source data.  Only approved study staff  as 
approved in Key Personnel  are permitted to make entries, changes, or correctio ns in the CRF.  
 
An audit trail will be maintained automatically by [CONTACT_791622] . 
Designated personnel  will complete user training, as required or appropriate per regulations.  
8.3.2.  Data Management Procedures and Data Verification 
Designated personnel using the electronic CRF will have access based on their specific roles in the 
protocol. These are outlined in the REDCap system and all requests must be approved by [CONTACT_791623] (PI, coordinators). Only individuals specified as Key Personnel will be included.   
 
Completeness of entered data will be checked automatically by [CONTACT_1624], and users will be alerted 
to the presence of data inconsistencies.  Additionally, the data manager and research team coordinators, 
Taylo r Hayes and Julia Salinaro, will cross- reference the data to verify accuracy.  Missing or implausible 
data will be highlighted for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_12598] (i.e. confirmation of data, correction of data, completion or confirmation that data is not available, etc.).  
 
The database will be reviewed and discussed prior to database closure, and will be closed only after 
resolution of all remaining queries.  An audit trail will be kept of all subsequent changes to the data. 
8.3.3.  Study Closure  
Following c ompletion of the studies, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_12599]:  
 
- Data clarification and/or resolution  
- Accounting, reconciliation, and destruction/return of used and unused study drugs  
- Review of site study records for completeness 
  
Pro00105081:  Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_791552]:  5/12/[ADDRESS_1091433] clinical data for the 
predetermined follow up period.  
 
We will calculate the incidence  of VTE during the study period defined above (enrollment to interval debulking 
surgery or 1 week after completion of the primary neoadjuvant chemotherapy course if debulking surgery is deferred) and estimate a 95% exact binomial confidence interval. Since  this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the incidence of venous 
thromboembolism in the study population will be compared to a historical control from a previous research study 
Pro00105081:  Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_791552]:  5/12/20

 of the incidence of venous thromboembolism among women receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for ad vanced 
ovarian cancer in which the majority of patients were from Duke. A drop greater than 20% (from approximately 8% 
to 6.4%) in the rate of venous thromboembolism would be considered clinically meaningful. If the true VTE rate is 
6.4%, the width of the 95% exact binomial confidence interval will be 0.098.  We will also monitor for adverse 
safety events related to low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34308], including major or minor bleeding events, gastrointestinal 
complications, and medication intolerance (side effects or adve rse reaction). Further detail regarding AE 
monitoring and reporting is outlined in a previous section.  
 
8.7.3.  Handling of missing values, censoring, and discontinuations  
An intention- to-treat analysis will be performed for all enrolled subjects. Due to the small  sample size, we 
will not impute missing data.  If a participant is censored due to the occurrence of a VTE or a significant AE, the 
study team will continue to collect clinical data until the predetermined follow up period is complete.  
13.5 Interim Analysis  
 
As this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we do not intend to perform any interim analysis. However the study team, 
including the PI,  will review cumulative adverse drug events every 3 months.  
13.6 Sample Size Calculation  
Sample size calculation is not applicable to this study. Since this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_115834], the incidence of venous 
thromboembolism in the study population will be compared to a historical control from a previous research 
study of the incidence of venous thromboembolism among women receiving neoadjuvant chemot herapy for 
advanced ovarian cancer in which the majority of patients were from Duke. A drop greater than 20% (from 
approximately 8% to 6.4%) in the rate of venous thromboembolism would be considered clinically meaningful.  
14 ADMINISTRATIVE AND ETHICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
14.1 Regulatory and Ethical Compliance

14.4 Study Documentation  
Study documentation includes but is not limited to source documents, case report forms (CRFs), monitoring 
logs, appointment schedules, study team correspondence with sponsors or regulatory bodies/committees, 
and regulatory documents that can be found in the DCI -mandated “Regulatory Binder”, which includes but is 
not limited to signed protocol and amendments, approved and signed informed consent forms, FDA Form 1572, CAP and CLIA laboratory certifications, and clinical supplies receipts and distribution records.  
 
Source documents are original records that contain source data, which is all information in original records of 
clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and 
evaluation of the trial.  Source documents include but are not limited to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office 
charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, 
recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_44641], microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and 
records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories and at medico- technical departments involved in the clinical 
trial.  When  possible, the original record should be retained as the source document.  However, a photocopy is 
acceptable provided that it is a clear, legible, and an exact duplication of the original document.  
 
An electronic case report form (CRF) will be the primary  data collection document for the study.  The CRFs will 
be updated within two weeks of acquisition of new source data.  Only study staff designated in Key Personnel 
and approved within the study REDCap database  are permitted to make entries, changes, or corrections in the 
CRF.  An audit trail will be maintained by [CONTACT_791624] . 
14.[ADDRESS_1091437]’s data will be 
maintained.  Research Data Security Plans (RDSPs) will be approved by [CONTACT_12644]. 
 
To protect privacy, every reasonable effort will be made to prevent undue access to subjects during the course 
of the study.  Prospective participants will be consented in an exam room where it is just the research staff, 
the patient and his family, if desired. For all future visits, interactions with research staff (study doctor and 
study coordinators) regarding research activit ies will take place in a private exam room. All research related 
Pro00105081:  Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_791552]:  5/12/[ADDRESS_1091438] data will be maintained using a dedicated database (REDCap) which is 
housed in the encrypted and password- protected laptop computers of study personnel .  Access to electronic 
databases will be limited to (please specify).  Subject data may be stored temporarily on encrypted and 
password -protected  portable memory devices such as flash drives and external hard drives, but only when 
absolutely necessary.  Data stored on portable memory devices will be de -identified.  Subject data will be 
deleted from the portable memory device at the earliest opportunity.  The security and viability of the IT infrastructure will be managed by [CONTACT_33678]/or Duke Medicine.   
 Upon completion of the study, research records will be archived and handled per DUHS HRPP policy.     
 Subject names or identifiers will not be used in reports, presentations at scientific meetings, or publications in 
scientific journals.

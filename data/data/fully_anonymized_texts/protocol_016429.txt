Title of trial: LUX -Lung 8 :  A randomized, ope n-label Phase III trial of afatinib versus erlotinib in 
patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the lung as second -line therapy 
following first -line platinum -based chemotherapy
Co-ordinating 
Investigators:
Trial sites: Multi -center trial
Clinical phase: III
Objectives: Primary:   Com pare efficacy of afatinib with erlotinib as second -line treatment for 
patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung , as measured by [CONTACT_3988] -free 
survival (PFS).  
Key secondary : Compare overall survival (OS) in both treatment groups
Secondary : Objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) ,tumour
shrinkage and the assessment of Health -related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and safety in 
both treatment groups
Methodology: Randomised, open -label , active control study comparing afatinib vs .erlotinib.  
Eligible patients will be randomized to receive either afatinib or erlotinib in a 1:1 
ratio.  Independent assessment of the primary endpoint will be completed in a 
treatment -blinded manner.  Random ization will be stratified based on race (Eastern 
Asian vs. non -Eastern Asian) .
No. of patient s: 
total entered : 795
each treatm ent: Afatinib: 398
Erlotinib: 397
Diagnosis : Patients with diagnosis of advanced NSC LCsquamous or mixed histology, who have 
completed at least 4 cycles of platinum -based doublet chemotherapy and who are 
eligible to receive 2ndline therapy.

Statistical m ethods: The primary analysis will compare afatinib vs erlotinib in terms o f progression -free 
survival (PFS ).  The randomised treatment regimens will be compared using a log-
rank test stratified by [CONTACT_545] (East ern Asian vs non -Eastern Asian ).  A stratified Cox 
proportional -hazards model will be used to derive the hazard ratio and 95% 
confidence interval (CI) betw een the two regimens. Kaplan -Meier estimates and 95% 
CI will be calculated at landmark time points. T hree hundred seventy -two PFS events 
would be expected to provide 90% pow er for the log -rank test, assuming a hazard 
ratio of 0.714 for afatinib relative to erlotinib (corresponding to median times of 14 vs 
10 w eeks, respectively) with two -sided α = 0.05. 
An interim analysis will be performed after at least [ADDRESS_1011076] 176 patients randomized into the trial.  
The analysis will be reviewed by [CONTACT_739982]:  1.) No change in planned accrual, 2.) partial curtailment of accrual, or 3.) 
stop of accrual.
Overall survival (OS) is a key secondary endpoint.  The analysis of OS will estimate 
the h azard ratio and the corresponding 95% confidence interval based on a Cox -PH 
model. Additionally, a stratified log -rank test will be performed.  Kaplan -Meier 
estimates of OS will be tabulated.  632 deaths w ould be expected to provide 80% 
power for log -rank test, presuming a hazard ratio of 0.800 for afatinib relative to 
erlotinib (corresponding to median survival times of 8.75 vs. 7.00 months, 
respectively) with tw o-sided α = 0.05.
OS will be analysed twice. The first analysis will be performed at the time of the 
primary PFS analysis using a Hay bittle -Peto stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_289842] (p-value 
<0.0001). The primary analysis of survival is planned at 632 deaths.  However, if the 
futility analysis curtails accrual at 500 patients, the primary analysis of OS will be 
performed after 80% of the randomized patients have died.

1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCL C) is a leading cause of cancer death globally .  It has been 
the most commonly  diagnosed cancer each y ear since 1985 w ith an estimated 1.35 million 
new cases diagnosed and approximately  1.2 million deaths each year worldwide ( R05-0876, 
R06-0221 ). The disease is associated with high mortality  and morbidit y with 5 -year-survival 
rates estimated in the U nited States at 16% for patients with metastatic disease ( R11-0764 ). 
Surgical re section is reserved as initial treatment option for eligible patients with earl y stage 
disease while s ystemic therap y is the mainstay  for those with advanced stage or metastatic 
disease. Man y patients carry  comorbidities from smoking history  and advanced age such as 
limited cardio -pulmonary  reserve that restrict streatment options. 
Patients with locally  advance d and/or metastatic NSCL C in good performance status and 
those able to tolerate are generall y treated with platinum based combination chemotherap yas 
afirst-line treatment . The goal is prolongation of survival and palliation of sy mptoms but
cure is rarel yseen. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_739940]
s, most patients eventually  
relapse and succumb to their illness. Many  patients such as elderl y and those with poor 
performance status or significant co -morbidit y may also not be able to tolerate the side ef fects 
associated with chemotherap y and thus choices may be limited further for these patients.  
Novel therap iesthat improve survival with a better tolerability  profile are thus needed .
Patients relapsing after first-linechemotherap y may be eligible for additional chemotherapy  
with alternate single agents such as docetaxel and pemetrexed. While sy stemic chemotherap y 
has been the mainstay  of treatment option sin advanced NSCL C,its activit y is at best modest 
with significant morbidity.  Several agents have shown activity  in this setting however onl y a 
few have been approved. In most instances, it has been difficult to identify  and select 
populations where individual chemotherapeutic agents have a higher likelihood of benefit. 
While docetaxel has been studie d and approved as second -linetherapy  across NSCL C 
histology , benefit from pemetrexed is limited only  to patients with adenocarcinoma histology . 
However, in the recent years novel targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_739941] s have emerged as a new treatment paradigm in select populations ,
offering an alternative to chemotherap y with an improved safety  and efficacy  profile. The 
targets most extensively  studied include the epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) or the 
Subclass I of the superfamily  oftransmembrane kinase inhibitors ( R06-1302, R07 - 1049 , 
R07-1135 ). 
Aberrant activation of EGFR is frequently  observed in a variet y of malignant tumour s and 
may be caused by  a variety  of molecular processes including mutations, receptor 
overexpression, ligand -dependent receptor dimerization, and ligand -independent activation.  
Overexpression of EGFR has been detected in 40 -80% of NSCL C, validated as a therapeutic 
target and has led to the development of specific small molecule EGFR antagonists to treat 
this disease ( R06-1301, R06- 1393 , R06-1394).  First -genera tion EGFR small molecule 
tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKI) act as ATP analogues, compete reversibl y for the tyrosine 
kinase (TK) catal ytic site, and include gefitinib (Iressa®) and erlotinib (Tarceva®).  Recent

unselected NSCL C patients ( R05-
0867, R06 - 1301 , and R06 -1306 ). This benefit has been 
demonstrated across NSCL C histol ogy in patients progressing after initial chemotherap y as 
well as in a maintenance setting following initial platinum based chemotherapy . While the 
most impressive responses are noted in the molecularly  defined select population of 
adenocarcinoma with acti vation mutations of EGFR ( R08-5155, R09 - 4437 , R11-1274 ), 
patients with wild ty pe(wt) EGFR including those with squamous histology  seem to benefit 
as well.  
Erlotini b, a first -generation EGFR TKI, is approved as monotherapy  in second -and third -line 
setting 
in patients with locally  advanced and/or metastatic NSCL C. Its approval was based on 
the BR21 trial conducted in patients with Stage IIIB/IV NSCL C that had failed one or two 
prior chemotherap y regimens. Patients randomized to erlotinib achieved improved r esponse 
rates (8.9% vs.0.9% )and prolongation of median overall survival ( MOS) (6.7 vs. 
4.7months) and progression free survival (PFS) (9.9 vs. 7.9 weeks) versus placebo
(R05-0867). Of the 488 patients randomized in a 2:1 fashion to erlotinib vs. 243 to placebo, 
29.5% had squamous histology  in the erlotinib arm vs. 32.1% in placebo arm. In addition 
erlotinib has demonstrated activity  as a single agent in the maintenance setting in 
non-progressive patients following first-linechemotherap y with a platinum doublet 
combination. I n the Sequential Tarceva® (erlotinib) in Unresec
table NSCLC (SATURN) 
study  [ADDRESS_1011089] progres sive disease following four cy cles of platinum 
based chemotherap y were randomized into the maintenance part of the study to receive either 
erlotinib (437 patients eligible for PFS anal ysis) or placebo (447 patients eligible for PFS 
analysis). Of these , 166 patients receiving erlotinib had squamous cell carcinoma compared 
to 194 receiving placebo. PFS was reported to be prolonged in patients independent of all 
histology  and irrespective of EGFR status : 12.3 weeks for patients in the erlotinib group vs. 
11.1 weeks for those in the placebo group ( HR 0.71, 95%CI= 0.62- 0.82; p<0.0001) .The 
objective response rate was 11.9% (52 patients) with erlotinib vs 5. 4% (24 patients) with 
placebo (P= 0.0006) 
(R11-1185).
In contrast docetaxel and pemetrexed , two of the most commonly  used agents in the 
second -linetreatment of advanced NSCL C
(R05-1054) have shown r esponse rate s of 8.8% 
and 9.1% respectivel y with median PFS and OS in similar ranges to erlotinib (median PFS of 
2.9 months in each arm, and median survival time of 8.3 months for pemetrexed versus 
7.9months for docetaxel , p=not significant) . Docetaxel is associated with significant risk of 
febrile neutropenia and the benefit of pemetrexed is restricted to non-squamous histology
(R04-
2230).
Thus, despi[INVESTIGATOR_739942] y advanced and/or metastatic 
NSCL C, further alternatives are need ed. Even patients eligible for these second -linetherapi[INVESTIGATOR_739943].   Similarly ,given the selective efficacy  of 
pemetrexed in patients with adenocarcinoma and improved efficacy  of EGFR TKIs in 
patients with EGFR mutations (most frequently  seen in patients with adenocarcinoma, 
non-smokers) these patients may  also have a wider selection of treatment options as 
compared to those with squamous histology  andprior smoking history  highlighting a high 
unmet medical need.

generation TKIs such as erlotinib and gefitinib ( U03-3218).
Afatinib has demonstrated activity  in the treatment of NSCL C in several clinical studies.  The 
results from LUX -Lung 1, a placebo -controlled, Phase III trial in patients who progressed 
after receiving chemotherap y and a first-line-EGFR TKI  demonstrated clinical activity  of 
afatinib in this NSCL C population with adenocarcinoma histology .  A tripling in the median 
PFS of afatinib compared to placebo (3.3 months vs. 1.1 month) was observed ( P10-[ZIP_CODE]). 
Similarly  significant responses have been noted in patients with mutated EGFR in the 
LUX -Lung 2 trial , reporting a confirmed ORR of 60% (78 of 129 patients), that support the 
hypothesis of improved efficacy  with the irreversible inhibition of th e target (P10-[ZIP_CODE], 
P10-[ZIP_CODE] ).At the time of publication for this protocol, two Phase III trials comparing 
afatinib to platinum based chemotherap y in patients harboring EGFR mutation as first-line
treatment are ongoing.
Albeit there is a preponderance of data of efficacy in adenocarcinoma histology  of NSCL C, 
there is growing evidence that patients with squamous histology  also derive benefit from 
EGFR TKIs. In addition to the data outlined above for erlotinib, additional proof of activity  
in this subset has been noted with another irreversible inhibitor of EGFR family  of TKI –
PF299804.  In a randomized Phase II study PF299804, a second -generation TKI, was 
compared to erlotinib in patients with a dvanced NSCL C who had failed at least one line of 
chemotherap y.  Of the 188 patients enrolled in this 1:[ADDRESS_1011091] of patients with non -adenocarcinoma histology  and approximately  60% with wild ty pe 
EGFR, PF299804 demons trated a significant improvement in median PFS compared to 
erloti nib (12.4 weeks vs. 8.3 weeks) ( R10-6208) .  The potential activity  of PF299804 in 
squamous histology  was also reported in a Phase II stud y in recurrent and/or me tastatic 
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) where ORR of 10.5% was noted. A 
median PFS of 3.4 months was reported along with 63.2% of patients achieving SD as their 
best response ( R11-1184 ).
In the current on going trials of afatinib additional proof of activity in cancers of sq uamous 
histolog y and bey ond NSCL C with mutated EGFR 
has been observed. In aPhase II trial 
(1200.40) of EGFR FI SH positive NSCL C patients, 12 of 59 (20%) evaluable patients on 
afatinib achieved an objective response with 8 confirmed responses (1 CR, 7 PR) so far and 
21 (36%) of all patients had disease control for at least 16 weeks. Of the 28 evaluable patients 
that tested negative for EGFR mutation so far the ORR was still 21% (6/28) and of the 
4patients treated with afatinib with squamous histology  [ADDRESS_1011092] 
evaluable response. In addition, LUX -Lung 5 (1200.42) is a large ongoing randomized Phase
III trial of afatinib plus weekl y paclitaxel versus investigator ’s choice of chemotherap y 
following afatinib monotherap y in NSCL Cpatients failing previous erlotinib or gefitinib 
treatment . At the time of publication of this protocol, preliminary  RECIST tumour 
assessment was available for 54 patients with squamous cell histology  receiving the initial 
afatinib monotherap y.  Two patients (3.7%) and 35 (65%) patients achieved an overall best 
assessment of PR and SD respectivel
y regardless of confirmation (Data on File).

clinically  enriched population for EGFR mutations and prior EGFR TKI therapy ; 5 patients 
with squamous histology were treated on afatinib (protocol violations). Four of these had SD 
and 1 an unconfirmed PR (Data on Fi le).
Additional proof of concept of afatinib in squamous histology  is derived from trial 1200.28 in 
patients with recurrent/metastatic SCCHN who had failed prior platinum -containing 
chemotherap y. Sixty -one patients were randomized to receive afatinib vs. 6 0 to receive 
cetuximab (a monoclonal antibody
 against the EGFR) and upon progression cross over were 
allowed. In a preliminary anal ysis reported in 2010, of the 34/74 patients randomized to 
afatinib in Stage 1 of the trial 6/34 patients achieved PR and 18/34 had SD ( P10- [ZIP_CODE] , 
P10-[ZIP_CODE] ). An expansion into two Phase III trials was in preparation at the time of initial 
publication of this protocol.
The 1200.125 trial (LUX -Lung 8) will build on the positive data to date observed with 
second -generation TKIs in squamous histology  cancers by  [CONTACT_739984]’s 
activity  in this NSCL C population. The patients with squamous histology  represent a 
significant population of patients with advanced NSCL C who have a large unmet medical 
need. With the inbuilt futility anal ysis into thistrial and the large unmet medical need in this 
population, it is conceived that the current design is a valid approach to test the hypothesis in 
a reasonable time frame.

Afatinib is a small molecule, selective and irreversible erbB family  blocker. I n preclinical 
models it effectivel y inhibits phosphory lation of erbB receptors resulting in tumour growth 
inhibition a nd regression of established subcutaneous tumours derived from four human 
cell-lines known to co -express erbB receptors. 
Afatinib is moderatel y fast absorbed after oral administration, with median t maxvalues 
approximately  3 hours after drug administratio n. In general, afatinib gMean maximum 
plasma concentration and exposure increased with increasing doses after a single dose and at 
steady  state. However, moderate to high inter -and intra -individual differences in plasma 
concentration were seen. Afatinib i s highl y distributed out of the blood and has a moderate to 
high clearance. The overall gMean terminal half -life at stead y state was 37.2 hours. The 
major route of elimination of afatinib was via faeces. After food intake, a decreased s ystemic 
exposure was observed compared to administration under fasted conditions. The PK 
characteristics in Caucasian cancer patients were comparable to those observed in Japanese 
cancer patients. 
Afatinib is bound covalently  to proteins to a variable extent and covalent protein adducts 
were the major circulating metabolites in the plasma. Afatinib did not show relevant

mutagenic in a single bacteria strain, but did not show genotoxic potential in vivo when tested 
up to overt toxic/lethal doses. Studies on embry o-foetal development in rats and rabbits up to 
life-threatening doses have revealed no indication of teratogenicity . 
Two Phase I open label dose- escalation studies determined t he MTD with continuous dosing 
of afatinib in patients with advanced solid tumours at 40mg and 50mg daily (U07-3128, 
U08-1023 ). Adverse events (AE s) observed with afatinib are consistent with those reported 
for other EGFR and dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitors. The most frequent drug -related toxicities 
were associated with gastrointestinal disorders ( including diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, and 
mucositis/stomatitis), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorde rs (including rash, pruritus, 
acneiform rash, acne), general disorders ( including fatigue and mucosal inflammation),

3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN AND PLAN
This randomized, open -label Phase III trial is designed to compare the efficacy  of afatinib 
with erlotinib for the second- line treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC of squamous or
predominantly  squamous histology .  The primary  endpoint of the trial will be progression-
free survival.  
Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive either afatinib or erlotinib.  
Patients will receive continuous daily  dosing of stud y drug assigned until disease progression, 
unacceptable adverse events or other reason necessitating withdrawal (see Appendix 10.1 and 
Section s 4.1.4 and 3.3.4).  Study  drug dose w ill be modified as in Section 4.1.[ADDRESS_1011098] 1.1 ( R09-0262) and assessment at the investigator site will be sufficient for 
decisions on continuation of treatment ( Appendix 10.1).  An independent analy sis of response 
will also be performed by  
[CONTACT_739985] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].1); however this w ill 
not be used to make treatment decisions. After approval of Protocol Version 3.0, the central 
imaging review of tumour response will be discontinued.
All patients will also have regular evaluations for assessment of safet y parameters as detailed 
in the flow chart .
An End of Treatment (EOT) evaluation is to be completed when a patient permanentl y 
discontinues study  drug , either for disease progression or any  reason listed in Section
3.3.4.  
The assessments required are listed in t he flow chart.  Patients who discontinue study  drug 
due to toxicity  will continue to have tumour assessments according to the Flow Chart until 
disease progression.
A Follow -up evaluation will be completed 28 (+7 ) days after permanent discontinuation of 
study drug.  Refer to the flow chart and diagram below for details.  This visit will be defined 
as the last visit for this trial.
Patients will subsequently be monitored for vital status in the Observation Period of this 
protocol. Once Protocol Version 3.0 is final (and where required locall y, approvals are 
obtained by [CONTACT_739986] 8.1), the collection of vital status data will no longer be 
required.

management of the trial will be minimized by  [CONTACT_739990]/or OS results to the trial team (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).Any data reviews 
will present patients in Dummy  treatment groups, and all options to complete reviews b y 
aggregate treatment group (i.e.by [CONTACT_739991] ) will be disabled to all 
trial team members. The treatment group assignment will be known on a per -patient basis in 
the eCRF.
Several studies enrolling al l NSCL C histologies have been completed with first -generation 
TKIs.  Details of these have been discussed in Section s 1and 2.
Initial a ctivity  of afatinib in squamous cell carcinoma including NSCL C has been assess ed in
several trials as described in Sections 1& 2. 
It is considered that a difference of four weeks improvement in PFS for afatinib compared to 
the approved treatment (erlotinib) is clinically  meaningful in this tough to treat patient 
population that has limited alternatives for treatment.
3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION
Approximately  800 patients will be randomized at approximately  200 study sites globall y.  
The study  will be conducted in approximately  24 coun tries.   The rate of randomization will 
vary by [CONTACT_82385], but is expected to be approximately  2-15 patients per site. 
A log of all patients included into the study  (i.e.having given informed consent) will be 
maintained in the I SF at the investigational siteirrespective of whether they  have been 
randomized into the trial or not.
3.3.1 Main diagnosis for study entry 
This study  will enroll patients with a diagnosis of advanced NSCL C squamous cell histology ;
who have disease progression after completion of at least 4 cy cles of platinum -based doublet

4.1.3 Selection of doses in the trial
Base d on earl y phase clinical trials, a dail y dose of 50 mg in the monotherapy  setting was 
identified as the dose for further development. This was used initially  in EGFR TKI 
refractory  population and several other Phase II/III and proof of concept trial s.  Gi vena 
higher propensit yof grade 3/4 AEs (es peciall y diarrhoea) andno loss of efficacy  especiall y in 
the EGFR mutation positive population , the dose wasreduced to 40 mg in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_739946] ( P10-[ZIP_CODE] , P10-[ZIP_CODE] , P10-[ZIP_CODE] ).  The 1200.22 
(LUX -Lung 2) study  enrolled [ADDRESS_1011112] frequent AEs, diarrhoea (96.7% in the 40 mg group compared to 93.9% in 
the 50 mg group) and rash/acne (90.0% in the 40 mg group compared to 92.9% in the 50 mg 
group); there was a substantial difference in the occurrence of grade 3 AEs for diarrhea (6.7% 
in the 40 mg group vs 24.2% in the 50mg group) and rash/acne (6.7% in the 40 mg group and 
25.3% in the 50 mg group).  Neither group had grade 4 or 5 AEs reported for these terms 
(P10-[ZIP_CODE]).  Refer to the current IB for additional details ( U03-3218 ).  In NSCL C and other 
indications, durable responses (>20 months) have been observed with daily  dosing of a fatinib 
of 40 mg and less ( P10- [ZIP_CODE] ).  Thedose selection for this trial follows the above principle
especiall y noting that the population in the trial will be naive to EGFR TKI ,and with 
associated comorbidities from smoking history  may  be at risk for higher rate of 
discontinuation if a starting dose of 50 mg daily  were chosen . Additionally , squamous cell 
NSCL C patients represent EGFR wt population that may  benefit from intensify ing maximal 
doses. Thus, i n this trial development of afatinib will continue at a starting dose of 40 mg to 
optimize the tolerability  and efficacy  balance.  The daily  dose will be modified following 
careful monitoring of patient’s drug- related adverse events and medica tion compliance; with 
option to dose-escalat eto 50 mg for patients mee ting the criteria specified in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
The starting dose for erlotinib is 150 mg daily  continuously  in accordance with the Tarceva® 
package insert.  In case of drug -related adverse events, the dose will be reduced to 100 mg 
and 50 mg daily , as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 .

4.2 CONCOMITANT THERAPY, RESTRICTIONS , AND RESCUE 
TREATMENT
4.2.1 Rescue medication , emergency procedure s,and additional treatments
Rescue medication
Rescue medications to reverse the actions of afatinib are not available. There is no specific 
antidote for overdosage with afatinib. Potential adverse events should be treated 
symptomaticall y. Common adverse events of treatment with afatinib include diarrhoea, 
nausea, vomiting, rash/acne and stomatitis . To improve tolerabilit y and the probability of 
clinical benefit, patients should receive prompt and appropriate supportive care at the first 
signs of s ymptoms. Suggested treatments for AEs are described below.

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.Concomitant medications or therap y to provide adequate supportive care may be given as 
clinically  necessary . 
After randomization, p alliative radiotherap y may be initiated for bone pa in or for other 
reasons (e.g. bronchial obstruction, skin lesions), provided that the total dose delivered is in a 
palliative range according to institutional standards. The irradiated area can not be used for 
tumour response assessment. During palliative radiotherap y, study treatment should be held 
and may  be resumed once the patient has recovered from an y radiation associated toxicity. If 
the medication is interrupted for more than 14 day s, the decision to continue will be made by  
[CONTACT_739996] . Continuous dose interrupt ion of 
>28 day sdue to palliative radiotherapy is not allowed.
All concomitant therap y, including anaesthetic agents, vitamins, homeopathic /herbal
remedies ,nutritional supplements, must be rec orded in the eCRF during the screening and 
treatment period, starting with any  medications taken within 4 weeks of the screening visit , 
and ending at the EOT  visit. After the EOT  visit, only  concomitant therap y indicated for 
treatment of an AE has to be repo rted. 
In case of major surgery  (as judged by  [CONTACT_093]) , it is recommended to stop treatment 
with afatinib around one week prior to the surgery, and to restart treatment after complete 
wound healing. If the medication is interrupted for more than 1 4 day s, the de cision to 
continue medication will be made b y the investigator in agreement with the BI Clinical 
Monitor.
Refer to the Tarceva® SPC/PI[INVESTIGATOR_739948].
Emergency  procedures
For patients receiving either afatinib or erlotinib, c areful assessment of all patients with an 
acute onset and/or unexplained worsening of pulmonary  symptoms (dy spnoea, cough, fever) 
should be performed to exclude interstitial lung disease (ILD). Study  drugs sh ould be 
interrupted pending investigation of these s ymptoms. I f interstitial lung disease is diagnosed, 
study  drug must be permanently  discontinued and appropriate treatment instituted as 
necessary . Refer to Table s [IP_ADDRESS] .2: 1 and [IP_ADDRESS].1:[ADDRESS_1011120] info rmation is provided in the I SF.

Erlotinib
Erlotinib is metabolized predominantly  by [CONTACT_097]3A4, and inhibitors of C YP1A2 would be 
expected to increase exposure to the drug.  Caution should be used during co -treatmen t with 
erlotinib and CYP3A4 inhibitors, and in some situations a decreased dose of erlotinib may  be 
required.  CYP3A4 inducers may  increase clearance of erl otinib.  See Appendix 10.[ADDRESS_1011121] 
of common CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers.  Alternate treatments should be considered.  If 
an alternate treatment is not possible, erlotinib dose modifications should considered.  
Grapefruit a nd grapefruit juice can reduce the availability  of CYP3A4 enough to significantl y

St. John’s Wort increases the activity  of CYP3A4, effectivel y decreas ing the bioavailability  
of drugs metabolized by [CONTACT_63931] s ystem.
Erlotinib is metabolized to a lesser extent by  [CONTACT_097]1A2.  Caution should be used during 
co-treatment with erlotinib and CYP1A2 inhibitors, and in some situations a decreased dose 
of erlotinib m ay be required ( R11-1186 ).  
Co-administration of erlotinib with omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, de creased the 
erlotinib AUC. The concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors should be avoided if possible.
Co-administration of erlotinib with ranitidine, an H2 receptor antagonist, decreased the 
erlotinib AUC.  Erlotinib and an y H2 receptor antagonist should be taken in a stagger ed 
manner.  Erlotinib must be taken once a day  [ADDRESS_1011122].

[IP_ADDRESS] Women of child-bearing p otential and pregnancy  prevention
Patients who are not of child- bearing potential due to being postmenopausal ([ADDRESS_1011123] 2 y ears without menstruation following chemotherapy ) (R11-1406 ) 
or surgical sterilization (oophorectom y, hysterectomy  and/or tubal ligation) do not need to 
use contraception to be eligible for part icipation in this trial.
All other patients are considered to have child-bearing potential and must use adequate 
contraception while participating in this trial (from screening until end of trial participation or 
[ADDRESS_1011124] dose of trial medicatio n, whichever is later).
Acceptable methods of birth control include surgical sterilization or double barrier method, 
and must be in accordance with local regulations where applicable.  Double barrier method of 
contraception is defined as two barrier method s used simultaneously  each time the patient has 
intercourse.  Acceptable barrier methods include diaphragm, female condom, cervical cap, 
male condom, and intrauterine device (IUD) (the diaphrag m and cervical cap must be used in 
conjunction with spermicidal jelly/cream).  Those using hormonal contraceptives, or with 
partners using hormonal contraceptives, must also be using an additional approved method of 
contraception (as described above). Partner vasectomy ,natural “rh ythm”, and spermicid al 
jelly/cream ar e not acceptable methods of contraception.
Women who become pregnant while participating in the st udy must discontinue study  
medication immediately .  The pregnancy  must be reported following procedures detailed in

Diarrhoea occurs at a high frequency  and generally  begins within 2 weeks of exposure to 
afatinib. Although usually  mild to moderate, diarrhoea may  lead to dehy dration and compel 
treatment modification or discontinuation, so early management is essential 
(Table [IP_ADDRESS]: 1). At the time of initiation of treatment with afatinib, site staff should ensure 
patients are counseled on prompt reporting of an y diarrh oea and instituting corrective 
measures such as h ydration and treatment with antidiarrhoeals.  Sites should confirm that a 
patient has read y access to antidiarrhoeal medication.
Patients must be advised to drink an adequate amount o f fluids to make up for the fluid lost 
through diarrhoea.

Personal hygiene Use of gentle soaps and shampoos for the body, e.g. pH neutral bath and shower 
formulations and tepid water.
Use of very mild shampoos for hair w ash.
Only clean and smooth towels are recommended because of potential risk of 
infection. The skin should be pat ted dry after a shower, whereas rubbing the skin 
dry should be avoide d.
Fine cotton clothes should be worn instead of synthetic material.
Shaving has to be done very carefully.
Manicure, i.e. cutting of nails, should be done straight across until the nails no 
longer extend over the fingers or toes. It is recommended that cuticles not be 
trimmed because this procedure increases the risk of nail bed infections .
Sun protection Sunscreen should be applied daily to exposed skin areas regardless of season. 
Hypoallergenic sunscreen with a high SPF (at least SPF 30, PAB A free, 
UVA/UVB protection), preferably broad spectrum containing zinc oxide or 
titanium dioxide are recommended .
Patients should be encouraged to consequently stay out of the sun.
Protective clothing for sun protection and wearing a hat should be recommended.
Moisturizer treatment It is important to moisturize the skin as soon as therapy is started.
Hypoallergenic moisturizing creams, ointments and emollients should be used 
once daily to smooth the skin and to prevent and alleviate skin dryness. 
Note: avoid greasy creams (e.g. petrolatum, soft paraffin, mineral oil based) and 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_739952] .
Prevention of paronychia Patients should keep their hands dry and out of water if ever possible.

The key  seconda ry endpoint of this trial is :
Overall survival
Other secondary  endpoints of this trial are: 
Objective response (CR, PR) according to RECI ST 1.1 ( R09-0262)
Disease control (CR, PR, SD) according to RECIST 1.1 ( R09-0262 ) 
Tumou rshrinkage

5.1.2 Assessment of efficacy
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumour Assessment
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using Response Evaluation Criteria 
in Solid Tumours (RECIST) guideline version 1.1 (R09-0262 ).Tumour response will be 
assessed b y investigator for clinical management of the patient and by  a retrospective central 
review.   Progression free survival will be defined as time from the date of randomization to 
the date of progression or to the date of d eath, whichever occurs first.
Full details of imaging procedures and RECI ST 1.1 assessment can be found in Appendix
10.1
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Central imaging
All image data will be sent to a central imaging unit to obtain an independent blin ded 
confirmation of tumour response assessment based on a uniform interpretation of 
radiographic image data for all patients enrolled in the trial. Upon receipt, the central imaging 
unit will log all image data into a tracking s ystem and perform quality  control of digitised 
radiographic images. An independent review of radiographic images including (i) sequential 
lesion selection and measurement and (ii) incremental radiological response assessment 
followed b y (iii) global review of tumour response or progr ession will be performed b y two 
blinded (with regard to patient, treatment, and visit) radiologists. In the case of disagreement

[ADDRESS_1011129] one of the primary  reviewer’s interpretations for all 
timepoints. The data will also be reviewed b y an oncologist who will provide a final 
assessment for each patient.
The review of the image data will be performed by [CONTACT_499847], who are not
affiliated with the stud y. All procedures will be done according to the specifications provided 
in the investigator site file. The purpose of the blinded reading is to independently  assess 
patient response to therapy and disease progression.
Modifications of the conventional RECI ST 1.1 lesion measurement criteria will be introduced 
into the measurement process in an attempt to reduce variability  in the measurements for the 
independent central imaging review.
Eligibility  and treatment decisions will be base d on the assessment of disease by  [CONTACT_1275]. Central imaging will not be used for this purpose and the results of the central 
imaging review will not be co mmunicated to the investigator.
After approval of Protocol Version 3.0 , the independent imagin g review will be discontinued
and sites will no longer require to send images to the c entral imaging u nit.
5.2 SAFETY
5.2.1 Endpoints of safety
Safety  of afatinib and erlotinib will be evaluated by  [CONTACT_740000], 
graded accordin g to NCI CTCAE version 3.0 ( R04-0474 ).  Safet y endpoints include:
The overall incidence and intensity  of adverse events
Gastrointestinal events (vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea)
Skin reactions (rash, acne)
Tolerability  of afat inib and erlo tinib will be assessed based on dosage reduction and 
discontinuation due to adverse events.

[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions of adverse events
Adverse event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence, including an 
exacerbation of a pre -existing condition, in a patient in a clinical investigation who received a 
pharmaceu tical product. The event does not necessarily  have to have a causal relationship 
with this treatment.

A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE which results in death, is immediately 
life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability  / incapacit y, requires or prolongs
patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], is a congenital anomaly  / birth defect, or is to be deemed serious for 
any other reason if it is an important medical event when based upon appropriate medical 
judgement wh ich may  jeopardise the patient and may  require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definitions.
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_688619] (SAEs) 
because there is no “adverse event” (i.e., there is no untoward medical occurrence) associated 
with the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]:

Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_739964] y of adverse event
The intensity  of adverse events should be classified and recorded according to the Common 
Terminolog y Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE )version 3.0 in the e CRF.
Causal relationship of adverse event
Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant 
factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re -challenge, 
confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant 
history . Assessment of causal relationship should be recorded in the case report forms. 
Yes: There is a reasonable causal relationship between t he investigational product 
administered and the AE. 
No: There is no reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product
administered and the AE. 
Worsening of underl ying disease or other pre- existing conditions
Worsening of the underly ing disease or of other pre-existing conditions will be recorded as an 
AE in the eCRF.
If progressive disease occurs and is associated with symptoms , the term “Progressive 
Disease” should not be reported as AE, however, signs and s ymptoms of progressive dis ease 
will be reported as an (S)AE (if applicable). Exception to this: Death due to progressive 
disease and where no signs or sy mptoms are available should be reported as “neoplasm 
progression (grade 5, outcome fatal).”

BI has set up a list of AEs which are defined to be alway s serious. In order to support the 
investigator with the identification of these “always serious adverse events”, if a non serious 
AE is identified to be serious per BI definition, a qu ery will be raised. The investigator must 
verify  the description and seriousness of the event.  I f the event description is correct, the

The patient perspective is considered a supportive contribution to inform phy sicians on the
clinical utility  of afatin ibcompared to erlotinib in the NSCLC population under investigation.
In addition, the EQ -5D, HRQoL  assessment will inform a later health economic 
(cost -effectiveness) analy sis.
EQ-5D
The EQ-5D is a disease generic instrument that has been widel y used and has been found to
capture HRQOL changes in NSCL C (R07-2129 , R07-2130 ). The EQ -5D comprises the
following two questionnaires:
1. The EQ -5D comprises 5 dimensions of health (mobility , self -care, usual activities,
pain/discomfort, anxiety /depression). Each dimension comprises three levels (no 
problems, some/moderate problems, extreme problems).
2. The EQ VAS records the respondents self -rated health status on a vertical graduated 
(0- 100) visual analogue scale.
For the EQ -5D the respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state by  [CONTACT_1299] a cross in
thebox against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions. Additional
instructions are provided in the I SF.
QLQ -C30 and LC -13
The QLQ -C30 is comprised of 30 questions. The QLQ -C30 incorporates both multi -items
scales and single -item measures. These inclu de one global health status/HRQo L scale, five
functional scales, three symptoms scales and six single items to assess d yspnea, insomnia,
appetite loss, constipation, diarrhoea and financial difficulties. Each of the mu lti-item scales
includes a different set of items – no item occurs in more than one scale ( R07-2064 ). The
QLQ -LC13 module comprises 13 questions. The module is designed for use in patients
receiving tre atment with chemotherap y and / or radiotherapy . The QLQ -LC13 incorporates
one multi -item scale to assess dy spnoea, and a series of single items assessing pain,
coughing, sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy , alopecia, and haemopty sis 
(R07-2064 ).

[ADDRESS_1011145] ICAL DESIGN -MODEL
This is a randomized, open -label Phase III trial to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of afatinib 
versus erlotinib in patients with squamous cell NSCL C eligible to receive therapy  in the 
second -line setting. Patients will be randomized t o afatinib or erlotinib in a 1:[ADDRESS_1011146] to race (Eastern Asian vs. non -Eastern Asian).
An interim anal ysis will be performed as described in Section 7.3.4.
Overall survival is the key secondary  endpoint. OS will be tested only  if the primary  endpoint 
of PFS shows statistical significance (p<0.05, two -sided). 
7.2 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHE SES
The alternative hy pothesis of the primary  anal ysis is that the progression -free survival time
for patients treated with afatinib is different from that of patients who receive erlotinib.  That 
is
HA: Safatinib (t)≠Serlotinib (t), for t>0
The null hy pothesis tested by  [CONTACT_740002]:
H0: Safatinib (t)=Serlotinib (t), for t>0
where S(t) is the probabi lity that a patient passes time t without dy ing or experiencing disease 
progression. The subscripts represent the two treatment groups of either afatinib or erlotinib. 
The null hy pothesis will be tested at the two -sided 0.05 level with an y adjustment neces sary 
for the interim anal ysis.
7.3 PLANNED ANALYSES
Two anal ysis datasets will be used:
Randomized Set (RS ):  this dataset includes all patients who are randomi sed, regardless of 
taking investigational treatment.
Treated Set (TS ):  the dataset includes al l randomi sed patients who take at least one dose of 
investigational treatment.
7.3.1 Primary analyses
The primary  efficacy  analy sis will include all randomised patients regardless of taking 
investigational treatment (RS) and patients will be anal ysed as ra ndomised.

The primary  anal ysis of PFS will be conducted after [ADDRESS_1011147] 1.1 criteria ( R09-0262 ).  The 
analysis will be based upon the evaluation of tumour imaging as determined by  [CONTACT_740003]. Clinical deterioration without image -based progression will be excluded from the 
primary  anal ysis, but will be examined as part of a sensitivity  anal ysis. 
For patien ts with known date of progression (or death):
 PFS [day s] = date of progression or death – date of randomisation + 1.
Patients with unknown disease progression status or date, or who are treated with new 
anti-cancer therap y will be handled as described in Section 7.4.
A stratified log -rank test will be used to compare afatinib to erlotinib. The test will be 
stratified by  [CONTACT_545] (Eastern Asian vs. non- Eastern Asian).
A stratified Cox proportional- hazards model will be used to derive the h azard ratio and 95% 
confidence interval (CI) between the two randomised regimens. Kaplan -Meier estimates and 
95% CI  will be calculated at landmark time points.
7.3.[ADDRESS_1011148] ratio and the corresponding 95% confidence 
interval based on a Cox -PH model. Additionally, a stratified log -rank test will be performed.  
Kaplan -Meier estimates of OS will be tabulated and K M estimates will be presented 
graphicall y.
OS will be analy sed twice. The first anal ysis will be performed at the time of the primary  PFS 
analysis using a Hay bittle -Peto stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3106]  (p-value <0.0001). The primary  anal ysis 
of survival is planned at 632 deaths.  However, if the futility  anal ysis curtails accrua l at 
500patients, the primary anal ysis of OS will be performed after 80% of the randomized 
patients have died.

Objective response is defined as CR or PR. Time to objective response is the time from 
randomi zation to the date of firs t documented CR or PR. The duration of objective response 
is the time from first documented CR or PR to the time of progression or death. Disease 
control is defined as CR, PR, or SD. 
Logistic regression will be used to test for a difference between regimens for objective 
response and for disease control. The statistical model will include the same stratification 
factors that will be used for the anal ysis of PFS. Nominal significance levels will be reported.
Descriptive statistics will be calculated for the duration of objective response and duration of 
disease control.
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Tumour shrinkage
The two treatment groups will be compared in t erms of the minimum sum of target lesion 
diameters recorded for each patient after randomisa tion. 
The anal ysis will compare the treatments using analy sis of covariance (ANCOVA) for 
minimum sum of diameters, using baseline sum of diameters as a covariate. The 
randomization strata will be included as classification factors.
Waterfall plots will di splay the maximum percentage reduction from baseline sum of target 
lesion diameters.
[IP_ADDRESS].4 Patient- reported Outcomes
The anal yses will focus on cough, d yspnea, and pain measured on the EQ-5D, EORTC QLQ -

The preferred method of assessment is a spi[INVESTIGATOR_739974], unless IV 
and/or oral contrast are medically  contraindicated. CT scans of the chest, abdomen and other 
areas of known or newl y suspected disease must be performed. Scans of the abdomen, pelvis 
and other areas of the body , but not chest, may  be done with MRI  instead of CT. 
Skin lesions fol lowed as target lesions must be documented b y colour digital photograph y 
and must include in the image a ruler with millimetre subdivisions and a label that includes 
the patients ID and date. 
Bone scans (using 99m-technetium poly phosphonate scintigraphy ) are recommended at 
baseline if the patient has any  signs and s ymptoms consistent with bone metastasis or a 
history  of bone metastasis. Bone metastasis identified at baseline must be documented and 
assessed according to RECI ST 1.[ADDRESS_1011188]/MRI /photographic method and 
acquisition technique (including use or non-use of IV contrast) as were used for screening 
assessments to ensure comparability . A chest x -ray or skeletal x -ray which clearl y 
demonstrates a new metastatic lesion may  be used to document progression in lieu of 
CT/MRI /bone scan.   
Only  those patients who have measurable disease present at baseline, have received at least
3weeks of therap y, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable for 
response.  These patients will have their response classified according to the definitions stated 
below.  
Measurability of tumour at baseline
Measurable lesions
Lesions that can be accurately  measured in at least one dimension with longest diameter 
≥10mm (by  [CONTACT_3610], MRI , caliper measurement) or ≥20 mm (by  [CONTACT_13190] X -ray).

measurable.
Measurable disease
Measurable disease requires the presence of at least one measurable lesion. 
Non-measurable disease
Non-measurable lesions are all other lesions, including small l esions (longest diameter 
<10mm with CT scan, MRI  or caliper measurement or <[ADDRESS_1011189] axis ≥10 and <15 mm) as well as truly non -
measurable lesions. Lesions considered trul y unmeasurable include leptomeningeal disease, 
ascites, pl eural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, l ymphangitic 
involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/ abdominal organomegal y identified by  
[CONTACT_522214] b y reproducible imaging techniques.
New lesions in irradiated fields
Previously  irradiated lesions should not be used as indicator lesions. However, new lesions 
occurring in previously  irradiated fields can be used to assess the antitumour response.
Methods of measurement
All measurements must be recorded in metric n otation, using a ruler or calipers. All baseline 
evaluations must be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 
[ADDRESS_1011190] be used to characterise each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up.
Clinical lesions will only  be considered measurable when they  are superficial (e.g., skin 
nodules, palpable l ymph nodes). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by  [CONTACT_740004] y including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is obligator y.
CT and MRI  are the best currentl y available and reproducible methods to measure target 
lesions selected for response assessment. Conventional CT and MRI  should be performed 
with cuts of [ADDRESS_1011191], abdomen and 
pelvis.
Ultrasound, endoscop y and laparoscop y should not be used to measure tumour lesions or 
evaluate tumour response. However, these techniques can be usefu l to supplement 
information from other techniques.

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.Cytology  and histology  can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases (for 
example, residual lesions in tumour ty pes such as germ cell tumours where known residual 
benign tumours can remain).
Baseline Documentation of Target and Non -target Lesions
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of two lesions per organ and five lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be 
recorded, measured (longest diameter = LD) and numbered at baseline. Target lesions should 
be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability  
for accurate repetitive measurements (either b y imaging techniques or clinically ). Lymp h 
nodes must be ≥15mm in order to be considered as target lesions. 
A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as 
the baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD will be used as reference to further characterise 
the objective tumour response of the measurable dimension of the disease (see Table 10.1: 1 ).
Table 10.1: 1 Evaluation of target lesions
Complete Response 
(CR)Disappearance of all target lesions.
Partial Response 
(PR)At least a 30% decrease in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as 
reference the baseline sum L D.
Progression (PD) At least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as 
reference the smallest sum L D recorded since the treatment started, 
together with an absolute increase in the sum of LD of at least 5mm.
OR
The appearance of one or more new lesions.
Stable Disease (SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify  for PR, taking as reference 
the baseline SoD , nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as 
reference the smallest SoD since the treatment started.
All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and should 
also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and these lesions should be 
followed as “present” or “absent” (see Table 10.1: 2).

In some circumstances it may  be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. 
When the evaluation of complete response depends upon this determination, it is 
recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy ) before 
confirming the complete response status.
Confirmation
In the case of SD, follow -up measure ments must have met SD criteria at least once after 
study  entry  at a minimum interval of six weeks.
Evaluation of Best Response to Study Treatment
The best response to study treatment (Table 10.1: 3) is the best response recorded from the 
start of treatmen t until disease progression or start of further anti -cancer treatment (taking as 
reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment 
started). In general, the patient’s best response assignment will depend on the achiev ement of 
both measurements and confirmation criteria (Table 10.1: 3).
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
“symptom atic deterioration ”. Every  effort should be made to document the objective 
progression even afte r discontinuation of treatment.

10.9.1 Introduction
Alterations of liv er parameters, as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] (AESIs ), are to be further 
evaluated using the following procedures:
10.9.2 Procedures
Any elevation of ALT/AST and bilirubin qualify ing as laboratory  alert would be confirmed 
by [CONTACT_740005] . If, due to technical error, the laboratory is 
not able to complete the confirmatory  testing, an alert will be generated.
If a site receives a potential DILI alert notice from the local laboratory , the foll owing must be 
completed:
1.) Evaluate patient within 48 hours and
2.)Perform following laboratory  tests locall y for confirmation
1.Repeat of AST, ALT, bilirubin (with fractionation to total and direct) 
2.Haptoglobin
3.Complete blood count and cell morphology
4.Reticuloc yte count
5.Creatinine kinase ( CK)
6.Lactate deh ydrogenase ( LDH )
7.Alkaline Phosphatase
If the initial alert values ( i.e.AST,ALT, and bilirubin) are confirmed on the second sample 
described as above, then an abdominal ultrasound or clinically  appropriate alter nate imaging  
(to rule out biliary  tract, pancreatic or intrahepatic pathology , e.g. bile duct stones or 
neoplasm) must be completed within 48 hours 
The findings from the hepatic imaging (including comparison to prior imaging if available) 
must be made av ailable as soon as possible as part of the adverse event reporting process.  In 
the event the etiology  of the abnormal liver tests results is not identified based on the imaging 
(e.g. biliary  tract, pancreatic or intrahepatic pathology ), then the “DILI che cklist” must be 
completed.  Details of the “DILI checklist” are provided in the I SF.  The following 
assessments need to be performed in order to complete the “DILI checklist” and results will 
be reported via the eCRF:
o obtain a detailed history  of current s ymptoms and concurrent diagnoses and 
medical history according to the “DILI checklist” provided in the I SF;
o obtain history  of concomitant drug use (including non -prescription 
medications, herbal and dietary  supplement preparations), alcohol use, 
recreatio nal drug use, and special diets according to the “DILI checklist” 
provided in the I SF;

- Long term follow -up
o Initiate close observation of subjects b y repeat testing of ALT, AST, and 
bilirubin (with fractionation to total and direct) at least weekl y until the 
laboratory  ALT and or AST abnormalities stab ilize or return to normal, 
then according to the protocol. Depending on further laboratory  changes, 
additional parameters identified e.g. b y reflex testing will be followed up 
based on medical judgement and Good Clinical Practices (GCP).

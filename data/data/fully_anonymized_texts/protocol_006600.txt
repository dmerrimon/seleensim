 1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Study Design 
 This is a randomized phase II open label study of pembrolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, in combination with radium-
223. A total of 45 patients with advanced metastatic CRPC will be randomized  in a 2:1 
fashion to the combination of pembrolizumab plus radium-223 (A rm A) or to radium -223 
alone (A rm B) .  
 1.2 Primary Objectives  
 
• To compare difference s in immune infiltrating cells (e.g., CD8+, CD4+, T cells) 
in bone biopsy specimens from baseline to  8 weeks on study therapy between the 
treatment arms . 
 1.3 Secondary Objective  
 
• To assess the safety and tolerability of combination therapy with pembrolizumab plus radium -223 
• To preliminarily investigate the efficacy of the combination of pembrolizumab 
plus radium-223 as evaluated by [CONTACT_3988] -free survival (PFS) and overall 
survival (OS) 
1.4 Exploratory Objectives 
 
• To characterize changes in immune cell response and function elicited by [CONTACT_834686]-
223 with or without pembrolizumab (PD-1 blockade). 
• To evaluate the PSA response including change in PSA and time to PSA 
progression 
• To assess the rate of symptomatic skeletal events (SSEs) and time to SSE in 
patients treated with radium- 223 and pembrolizumab.  
• To explore the use of quantitative SPECT/CT for evaluating changes in 
osteoblastic activity on bone scan after radium -223 and pembrolizumab  
• To assess the effect of radium -223 and pembrolizumab on quality of life, pain, 
and analgesic use.  
• To investigate the impact of genomic alterations including those in DNA damage repair pathways on clinical outcomes in patients treated with rad ium- 223 with or 
without pembrolizumab.  
• To identify biomarkers of response and to investigate mechanisms of treatment 
resistance through targeted sequencing of cell free DNA at baseline, on therapy, 
and at the time of disease progression .

2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)  
 Castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a fatal disease from which nearly 30,[ADDRESS_1159204] enzalutamide, the chemotherapy agent cabazitaxel, the therapeutic vaccine, sipuleucel -T, and the novel bone metastasis-homing 
radiotherapeutic, radium -223 dichloride --all of which improve survival. Bone metastases 
occur in over 90% of patients with metastatic CRPC .[ADDRESS_1159205] frequent 
cause of morbidity and mortality  in this disease and incur high treatment- related costs.    
 2.2 Study 
 Agents  
 2.2.1 Radium-223 (Xofigo)
[ADDRESS_1159206] frequently observed adverse events (AEs) of any grade in the phase 3 study were anemia (31%), thrombocytopenia (12%), constipation (18%), diarrhea (25%), nausea (36%), vomiting (18%), fatigue (26%), peripheral edema (13%), anorexia (17%), and bone pain (50%). Compared to placebo, radium- 223 increased median overall 
survival from 11.3 months to 14.9 months and reduced the risk of death by 30% (HR: 0.70; 95%CI: 0.58- 0.83; p<0.001).
[ADDRESS_1159207] symptomatic skeletal event (15.6 vs. 9.8 months) and the time to increase in total alkaline phosphatase (7.4 vs. 3.8 mo.) Compared to placebo, it elicited  a higher rate of normalization  of serum alkaline phosphatase (34 vs. 1%) and 
PSA declines ≥30% (16% vs. 6%).  
 Description  
Radium Ra 223 dichloride is an alpha particle-e mitting radio pharmaceutical. 
 
Radium -223 
is supplied as a cle ar, colorle ss, isotonic, and ster ile solution to be 
administered int raveno usly with pH betw een 6 and 8.  Each m illiliter of so lution 
contains 1, 000 kBq radium-223 dichlori de (27 microcuri e), correspondi ng to 0.53 ng 
radium -223, at 
the reference date. Radium is present in the solution as a fre e divalent 
cation. 
 Each vial contains 6 mL of solution (6,000 kBq (162 microcurie) ra dium-223 
dichlori de at the reference date). Th e inactive ingredients are 6.3 mg/mL sodium 
chloride USP (t onicity agent), 7.2 mg/mL sodium cit rate USP (for pH adjustment), 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-498 
Protocol Version Date:  15 November 2019 
 
 7 
 0.2 mg/mL hydrochloric acid USP (for pH adjustment), and water for inj ection 
USP. 
 
The mol ecular weight of ra dium-223 dichloride, 223RaCl 2, is 293.9 g/mol. 
 
Radium-223 has a half-life of 11.4 days. The specific ac tivity of radium- 223 is 1.9 MBq 
(51.4 microcuri e)/ng. 
 The six-stage-decay of ra di
 um-223 to stable lead-207 occurs via s hort-lived daughter s, 
and is a ccompanied predominantl y by [CONTACT_834687]. There are also beta and gamma 
emissions with di fferent energies and e mission probabi lities. Th e fraction of energy 
emitted fr om radium- 223 and its daughters as alpha-p articles is 95. 3% (energy range of 5 
- 7.5 MeV). The f raction e mitted as beta-particles is 3.6% (ave rage energies are 0.445 
MeV and 0.492 MeV), and the f raction e mit ted as gamma- radiation is 1.1% (energy 
range of 0. 01 - 1.27 MeV). 
 Mechan
ism of action  
The ac tive moiety of r adi um-223 is the alpha particle-e mitting isotope radium-223 (as 
radium Ra 223 dichloride), which mimics calcium and forms complexes with the bone 
mine ral hydroxyapatite at areas of increased bone turnover , such as bone metastases. The 
high linear energy t ransfer of alpha e mitters (80 keV/ micrometer) leads to a high 
frequency of double-st rand DNA breaks in adj acent cells, resulting in an anti-tumor effect 
on bone metastases. The alph a particle range from radium-223 dic hloride is le ss than 100 
micrometers (le ss than 10 cell diameter s), which limits damage to the surrounding normal 
tissue. 
 Phar
macodynamics  
Compared with placebo, there was a significant difference in favor of radium-223 for all 
five serum biomarkers for bone turnover studied in a phase 2 randomized study (bone formation markers: bone alkaline phosphatase [ALP], total ALP and procollagen I N propeptide [PI[INVESTIGATOR_680]], bone resorption markers: C- terminal crosslinking telopeptide of type I 
collagen [S -CTX- I] and type I collagen crosslinked C -telopeptide [ICTP]).  
 Pharmacokinetics: E limination 
The whole body mea surements indicated that approximately 63% of the administered 
radioac tivity was excreted from the body within 7 days after inj ection (after co rrecting 
for decay). Fecal excre tion is the major route of e limina tion from the body. At 48 hours 
after inj ection, the cumula tive fecal excretion was 13% (range 0 - 34%), and the 
cumula tive urine excretion was 2% (range 1 - 5%) . There was no evidence of hepato-
biliary excretion based on imaging data. 
 The rate of elimina tion o
f radium- [ADDRESS_1159208] is 
influenced by [CONTACT_62891] v ariability in intes tinal transit rates acro ss the popula tion. Patients 
with a slower intestinal transit rate could potentially recei ve a highe r intestinal radiation 
expo sure. It is not known whether this will result in increased gastrointestinal toxicit y.

stratified by [CONTACT_834688], bisphosp honate use, and prior docetaxel expo sure. Prior 
bisphosphonates were used by 41% of patients a nd 58% had received prior docetaxel. 
During t he treatment period, 83% of radium -223 patients and 82% of pl acebo patients 
re
ceived gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists and 21% of radium -223 patients and 
34% of pl acebo pa tients received conco mitant antiandrogens. Use of systemic steroids

 In a phase [ADDRESS_1159212] blocking antibodies such as Genentech’s anti- PD-L1 molecule

RECIST and oncology review/investigator assessed irRC, respectivel y.  These responses 
are remarkab ly durable. The  preliminary  1-year survival rate for patients, many of 
whom have had multiple therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  including ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125],  who receiv e MK-3475 is

previously- treated  NSCLC by c entral independent  RECIST/investigator  assessed  
irRC,  respectively, with these responses also remarkably  durable.    
 
Preliminary  data suggest higher levels  of PD-L1 expression in tumors of NSCLC 
are associated  with increased  activity  (ORR 67% by [CONTACT_834689]/57% by c entral  independent RECI ST); additional data ar e required  to define 
the optimal PD- L1 cut point.   
 The most commonl y reported treatment  emergent AEs  experienced were fatigue  
(43.8%), nausea (26.7%), cough (25.3%), pruritus (24.6%), diarrhea  (22.3%) and rash 
(21.5%).   Immun e-related  adverse events were  reported in 21.4% of melanoma  
patients;  most  of these events (15.8%) were  considered  drug- related by [CONTACT_093].  
The most commonly reporte d, immun e-related  adverse events across the dos e-schedules 
were  rash (3.2%), pruritus (2.9%), vitiligo (2.9%), hy pothyroidism (2.7%),  arthralgia  
(2.2%), diarrhea (2.2%), and pneumonitis (1.9%).  
 Rat
ionale for Dose Selection:  
 An open- label Phase I trial (Protocol 001) is evaluating the safety and clinical activity of 
single agent MK -3475.  The dose escalation portion of this trial evaluated three dose levels, 
1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) in s ubjects with 
advanced solid tumors.  All three dose levels were well tolerated and no dose- limiting 
toxicities were observed.  This first in human study of MK -3475 showed evidence of target 
engagement and objective evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W).  No maximally tolerated dose ( MTD ) has been identified to 
date.  10.0 mg/kg Q2W, the highest dose tested in PN001, will be the dose and schedule utilized in Cohorts A, B, C and D of this protocol to test for initial tumor activity.  Recent 
data from other clinical studies within the MK -3475 program has shown that a lower dose 
of MK -3475 and a less frequent schedule may be sufficient for target engagement and 
clinical activity.  
 PK data analysis of MK -3475 administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic 
clearance, limited volume of distribution, and a long half -life (see IB).  Pharmacodynamic 
data (IL -2 release assay) suggested that peripheral target engagement is durable (>21 days).  
This early PK and pharmacodynamic data provides scientific rationale for testing a Q2W and Q3W dosing schedule.    
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-498 
Protocol Version Date:  [ADDRESS_1159215] a wide 
therapeutic range based on the melanoma indication.  The differences in exposure for a 200 mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 2 mg/kg Q3W body weight based regimen are anticipated to remain well within the established exposure margins of 0.5 – 5.0 for MK -
3475 in the melanoma indication. The exposure margins are based on the notion of similar efficacy and safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. the proposed dose regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W (i.e. 5- fold higher dose and exposure). The population PK evaluation revealed 
that there was no significant impact of tumor burden on exposure. In addition, exposure was similar between the NSCLC and melanoma indications. Therefore, there are n o 
anticipated changes in exposure between different indication settings.  The rationale for further exploration of 2 mg/kg and comparable doses of pembrolizumab in solid tumors is based on: 1) similar efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab when dosed at eith er 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg Q3W in melanoma patients, 2) the flat exposure -response 
relationships of pembrolizumab for both efficacy and safety in the dose ranges of 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg Q3W, 3) the lack of effect of tumor burden or indication on distribution behavior of pembrolizumab (as assessed by [CONTACT_78013]) and 4) the assumption that the dynamics of pembrolizumab target engagement will not vary meaningfully with tumor type.  
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W as an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is 
based on simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab 
showing that the fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks  will provide exposures that 1) are 
optimally consistent with those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 we eks, 2) will 
maintain individual patient exposures in the exposure range established in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy response and 3) will maintain individual patients exposure in the exposure range established in melanoma that are well tole rated and safe.  
A fixed dose regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenient for physicians and to reduce potential for dosing errors.  A fixed dosing scheme will also reduce complexity in the logistical chain at treatment facilities and re duce wastage.  
 
2.3 Rationale for Study  
 We posit that tumor cell killing with radium- 223 will release tumor- associated antigens 
(TAAs). Dendritic cells will take up these antigens, process them, and present them to naïve T cells. These T cells will mature into tumor- specific effector cells that will 
proliferate and ultimately hone in on the cancer. The addition of PD -1 blockade may 
reverse any potential anergy of these PD -1+ infiltrating anti -tumor immune cells. Tumor 
heterogeneity and the dynamic nature of PD -L1 expression on tumor cells and PD -1 and 
PD-L1 expression on immune cells in the tumor microenvironment provides further 
rationale for this approach even in the absence of high PD -L1 expression upfront.

22 Modulation of circulating

  4. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES  
 4.1 General Guidelines for DF/HCC and DF/PCC Institutions  
 Institutions will register eligible participants in the Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS) OnCore. Registrations must occur prior to the initiation of protocol therapy. Any participant not registered to the protocol before protocol therapy begins will be considered ineligible and registration will be denied.  
 An investigator will confirm eligibility criteria and a member of the study team will complete the protocol- specific eligibility checklist.  
 Following registration, participants may begin protocol therapy. Issues that would cause treatment delays should be discussed with t he Overall Principal Investigator (PI). If a 
participant does not receive protocol therapy following registration, the participant’s 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-498 
Protocol Version Date:  [ADDRESS_1159235] be made in 
OnCore as soon as possible.  
 4.2 Registration Process for DF/HCC and DF/PCC Institutions 
 DF/HCC Standard Operating Procedure for Human Subject Research Titled Subject Protocol Registration (SOP #: REGIST-101) must be followed.   
 
 5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 5.1 Treatment Regimen  
 Following registration, participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either Arm A: a combination of Radium-223 and pembrolizumab or Arm B: Radium-223 alone.  Patients will be stratified based on:  
 
• Baseline alkaline phosphatase <220 or ≥220  
• Volume of bone metastases (high: ≥ 4 bone metastases including one beyond 
the axial skeleton vs. low: <4 bone metastases)  
-Based on CHAARTED (ECOG 3805) criteria
24    
 Given the varied dosing of the two agents, we will refer to weeks on study instead o f 
cycles.  
 Radium-223 55kBq /kg (1.49µ Ci)/kg will be administered intravenously (IV) slowly over 
1 minute every 4 w eeks for a maximum of 6 doses.  Weight used for dosing should be 
based on institutional standards. Radium-223 will be administered in the nuclear medicine suite  at DFCI and at the corresponding department for  participating 
investigational sites.  
  Pembrolizumab will be given only to pa tients randomized to the investigational arm 
(Arm A). Pembrolizumab will be given at a dose of 200mg intravenously every 3 weeks. It will be administered in the Yawkey Infusion Center at DFCI and at the corresponding department for participating investigational sites . 
 Treatment with both agents will be administered on an outpatient basis.  Reported adverse events and potential risks are described in Section 7. No investigational or commercial agents or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_834670]'s prostate cancer . 
 No dose modifications will be made for either agent.  If study agents are held  for more 
than 12 weeks (for pembrolizumab) or 8 weeks (for Radium-223) due to study drug-related  toxicity, the patient should be discontinued from the offending agent. Patients 
may continue on either agent alone if tolerating.

 5.2 Pre-Treatment Criteria  
 
5.2.1 Cycle 1, Day 1  Pre-Treatment Criteria for C1D1. D1 dosing criteria of subsequent cycles (2 and 
beyond) should follow Section 6 guidelines: 
 
C1D1 labs must  meet the following criteria prior to treatment but do not need to 
re-meet eligibility criteria : 
• Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL  
• Hemoglobin ≥ 10g/dL  
*transfusions and/or erythropoietin supplementation permitted 
• Platelets ≥100,000/mcL  
• Total bilirubin  ≤1.5x institution’s  upper limit of normal (unless known 
Gilbert’s syndrome)  
• AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal ULN 
• Creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min/1.[ADDRESS_1159237]. (Note: creatinine clearance should be calculated per institutional standard)  
• If screening assessments have been done within 72 hrs prior to  C1D1, they 
may be used in lieu of repeat C1D1 assessments (e.g., labs, ECOG, exam) . 
 
5.2.2 Subsequent Cycles  
 
• Day 1 complete metabolic panel  and c omplete blood count (CBC) with 
differential must be reviewed by [CONTACT_834693] [ADDRESS_1159238] to be reviewed prior to the dose 
• CBC with differential should be obtained prior to each dose of radium -223 or 
pembrolizumab and doses given only if eligible per guidelines in S ection 6  
• Day 1 assessments may be performed  within  72 hours prior to study drug 
administration . 
 
5.3 General Concomit ant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 If there is a clinical indication for medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria , discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may be required.  
The investigator should discuss any questions regarding the use of these agents with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_834671] .  The final decision on any 
supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the subject's p rimary 
treating physician.   
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-498 
Protocol Version Date:  [ADDRESS_1159239]’s welfare may be administered at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_77981].  All concomitant medication will be recorded on the case report form 
(CRF) including all prescription, over- the-counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV 
medications and fluids.  If changes occur during the trial period, documentation of drug  
dosage, frequency, route, and date may also be included on the CRF. 
All concomitant medications received within [ADDRESS_1159240] dose of trial treatment should be 
recorded for SAEs and ECIs as defined in Section 7.2. 
Treatment with non -conventional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_834672]/mineral supplements is 
acceptable provided that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], such treatment will not 
interfere with study treatment and the trial endpoints.  If they do, the subject may need to 
be discontinued from the trial and this should be discussed with the PI. 
 Subjects may receive standard of care for any underlying illness provided therapy does not interfere with study treatment and the trial endpoints.  
 In the event of neutropenia, anemia, or thrombocytopenia, subjects may receive appropriate supportive care (such as transfusion, biologic response modifiers su ch as G -
CSF or GM -CSF, prophylactic antibiotics, antifungals and/or antivirals, hematopoietic 
growth factors).   
 
If surgery is required during study drug treatment, the surgeon needs to be notified that 
the patient has been treated with a radioactive product and adequate precautions for radioactive protection should be applied during the surgical procedure.  The patient should continue with study treatment if considered safe in the treating investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649].  Radium-[ADDRESS_1159241] -targeting agents including 
bisphosphonates and denosumab if the patient is already on them for > [ADDRESS_1159242] -targeting agent prior to study entry, it 
may be continued or suspended during concurrent administration of radium -223 at t he 
discretion of the treating investigator.  
 Consideration should be given to using concomitant bone health agents such as bisphosphonates on either arm of the study. Patients receiving bisphosphonates, denosumab, zoledronic acid or similar therapy prior to randomization may be maintained on this therapy during the study. Bisphosphonates denosumab, zoledronic acid or similar therapy can be stopped or started at the discretion of the investigator throughout the study.   
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-498 
Protocol Version Date:  15 November 2019 
 
 22 
  
5.3.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
 Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_79394]:  
• Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy  
• Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol 
• Investigational agents other than pembrolizumab 
• Radiation therapy  other than radium-223 
o Note:  Patients may undergo palliative radiation to combat clinical (e.g., symptomatic) progression while on study if (1) the patient was achieving overall clinical benefit according to the treating investigator; and (2) the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_834673]. Study drugs should be continued during radiation unless discussed with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_834674] (e.g., concurrent toxicity 
concerns). 
• Live vaccines within [ADDRESS_1159243] dose of trial treatment and while participating in the trial.   Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, 
the following: intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid vaccine.  
• Systemic glucocorticoids are prohibited , with the following exceptions : 
o To modulate symptoms from an event of clinical interest (ECI)  of suspected 
immunologic etiology  while on study.   
o Baseline systemic steroids ≤ 10mg of prednisone or its equivalent for non-
autoimmune processes (e.g., COPD, physiologic replacement doses ) if on 
stable dose and asymptomatic. 
• Diethylstilbestrol, estrogens, saw palmetto or other preparatio ns thought to have 
endocrine effects on prostate cancer are allowed if the patient has been on a stable 
dose for at least [ADDRESS_1159244]- Treatment Follow -up Phase.  
5.3.3 Supportive C are M edications  
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-498 
Protocol Version Date:  15 November 2019 
 
 23 
 • Drugs needed for supportive care such as anti- emetics are permitted  
 
• Steroids for nausea : dexamethasone, prednisone and other systemic steroids 
should be avoided , if possible,  due to their immunosuppr essive properties. If 
clinically indicated, steroid dose should  not exceed 10mg of prednisone per day 
or equivalent.  
 • Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by 
[CONTACT_12707]. Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse events with potential immunologic etiology are outlined below. Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or intravenous treatment with corticosteroids as well as additional anti-inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with administration of corticosteroids. Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, atte mpts should be made to rule out other causes such 
as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might require additional supportive care. The se treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when the 
investigator determines the events to be  related to pembrolizumab. If not thought 
related, care is per investigator discretion.  
 
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin photography as part of evaluation of the event. 
 5.4 Criteria for Taking a Participant Off Protocol Therapy  
 Duration of therapy will depend on individual response, evidence of disease progression and tolerance. In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s) or the scheduled break after the first 3 doses of r adium -223 in arm A , treatment may continue for up to a 
total of 6 doses of radium -223 and up to 35 doses (24 months) of pembrolizumab if 
achieving clinical benefit and tolerating or until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
• Disease progression  
 
• Arm A:  
 - After 3 months on study therapy ( generally week 12 re -staging scans)  
 
• If the patient has stable disease or better, they will start on a radium-223 break, but continue on pembrolizumab.  
• If there have been treatment delays, the break should not commence until at least 3 doses of radium are given unless the radium- 223 is deemed intolerable/toxic.  
If pembrolizumab has been discontinued due to toxicity despi[INVESTIGATOR_834675]
e disease or better , radium -223 will be continued without a 
break , and study assessments will be conducted on the same 
schedule as Arm B.  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-498 
Protocol Version Date:  15 November 2019 
 
 24 
 • Due to the intricacies of assessing response/progression in bone 
only disease, in cases where the treating investigator feels the patient is clinically benefiting from the radium-[ADDRESS_1159245] of care. Study 
assessments during combination therapy will continue per the required data table in Arm A . Scans will continue to adhere to 
the study schedule (every 12 weeks). Alternatively, the patient or clinician may choose to stop study therapy and proceed with alternative systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_349933].   
 
• If 2 or more new bone lesions (“unconfirmed progression ”) are 
present on initial scans and the patient has received all 3 initial doses , radium -223 should be continued until reassessment with 
confirmatory scans ≥ 6 weeks.  
 
• If “unconfirmed progression” of nodal disease occurs, but no new visceral disease, the patient may continue on pembrolizumab and radium-223 until reassessment with confirmatory scans ≥ 6 wee ks 
or be discontinued per treating investigator’s discretion.  
• For patients with unconfirmed bone or nodal progression who continue on study therapy after initial restaging scans (~12 weeks), 
if subsequent scans (at least ≥ 6 weeks from initial scans) show : 
• The disease has stabilized or improved : they may continue on 
study therapy until disease progression or until 
intolerability/toxicity precludes further administration.  
• Continued radiologic progression per RECIST v1.1 or PCWG2 : the patient should be discontinued from study 
therapy. If the treating investigator believes the patient is 
clinically benefiting, contin uation of one or both study drugs 
may be permitted upon discussion with PI.  
• If there is evidence of new visceral disease at any point, the pa tient 
should be discontinued from both agents. 
 
- For all subsequent scans of patient who commence on radium-223 
break : 
 
• If the patient continues to have stable disease or better, they will continue on pembrolizumab alone.   
• If the patient went on r adium -223 break, it may be restarted : 
• Whenever the patient meets progressive disease criteria per 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-498 
Protocol Version Date:  15 November 2019 
 
 25 
 protocol as long as there is no new visceral disease. No 
confirmatory scans are required unless the treating investigator prefers to wait to confirm before restarting. The rationale to allow restarting of radium-223 in patients who are progressing in the nodes is the possible role of radium-223 as an immune modulator that may help stimulate the immune response to pembrolizumab.  
• In cases where treating investigator feels that patient would clinically benefit from restarting radium-223, even though not technically progressing by [CONTACT_393] v 1.1 or PCWG2, will be 
discussed and permitted only on a case-by- case basis with the 
PI. 
• If the patient meets protocol criteria for disease progression on the next scheduled scans after restarting radium-223 (and has received at least 2 more doses of radium -223), they should be 
discontinued from study therapy. If they do not meet these 
criteria or treating investigator believes they are clinically benefiting, they may be permitted to continue on a case-by-case basis after discussion with the PI.  Similarly, if treating 
physician feels the patient is clinically progressing prior to 2 more doses of radium- 223, the patient can be discontinued 
from study therapy. 
 
• If patient has signs of new visceral disease at any time meeting RECIST v1.1 criteria, they will be discontinued from study 
therapy.  
 
- For subsequent scans of   patient s who d o not commence on radium-
223 break: 
 
• If the patient continues to have stable disease or better, they will 
continue on combination study therapy.  
• If scans show progressive disease per protocol  criteria , they should 
discontinue therapy. In cases where treating investigator feels that 
the patient would clinically benefit from continuing study therapy even though they are technically progr essing by [CONTACT_393] v1.1 or 
PCWG2, continuation will be discussed on a case-by- case basis 
with th e PI. 
 
• Arm B 
 
- Continue on radium-223 until the patient meets protocol criteria for disease progression , up to a maximum of 6 doses.  
 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-498 
Protocol Version Date:  15 November 2019 
 
 26 
  
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)  
 
• Participant demonstrates an inability or unwillingness to comply with the 
documentation requirements 
 
• Participant decides to withdraw from the protocol therapy  
 
• General or specific changes in the participant's condition render the participant unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the treating investigator  
 
• Completed 24 months of uninterrupted treatment with pembrolizumab or 35 
administrations of study medication, whichever is later.  Note: [ADDRESS_1159246] be documented in the case report form (CRF). Alternative care options will be discussed with the participant.  An ODQ Treatment Ended/Off Study Form will be completed when a participant is removed from protocol therapy. This form can be found on the ODQ website or obtained from the ODQ registration staff.  
 In the event of unusual or life- threatening complications, treating investigators must 
immediately notify the Overall PI,    
 5.[ADDRESS_1159247] a follow up visit within 30 days of removal from protocol therapy (End of Treatment visit). Adverse event monitoring will continue through End of Treatment visit.  Subjects who discontinue for reasons other than progressive disease will 
have post- treatment follow -up for disease status until disease progression, initiating a 
non-study cancer treatment, withdrawing consent or becoming lost to follow-up. Follow up scans are not required for patients who do not progress, but will be captured if possible. After documented disease progression each subject will be followed by [CONTACT_756] , chart review, or clinic visit for overall survival until death, withdrawal of 
consent, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first. Regardless of reason for discontinuation, patients will be followed every 6 months until death or 2 years after treatment discontinuation.  
 5.6 Criteria for Taking a Participant Off Study   
 Participants will be removed from study when any of the following criteria apply:  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Withdrawal  of consent for data submission 

DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-498 
Protocol Version Date:  15 November 2019 
 
 27 
 • Death  
 
The reason for taking a participant off study, and the date the participant was removed, must be documented in the case report form (CRF).  
 An ODQ Treatment Ended/Off Study Form will be filled out when a participant c omes 
off study. This form can be found on the ODQ website or obtained from the ODQ registration staff.   5.7 Clinical Criteria for Early Trial Termination  
Early trial termination may occur if  the criteria specified below  are met : 
 1. Quality or quantity of data recording is inaccurate or incomplete  
2. Poor adherence to protocol and regulatory requirements 
3. Incidence or severity of adverse drug reaction , including those determined by [CONTACT_834694] a potential 
health hazard to subjects  
4. Plans to modify or discontinue the development of the study drug 
In the event of [COMPANY_006] decision to no longer supply study drug, ample notification will be provided so that appropriate adjustments to subject treatm ent can be made.  
  6. DOSING DELAYS  
 Dose delays will be made as indicated in the following table(s).  No dose 
lowering/modifications will occur; only dose holds.  The descriptions and grading 
scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for dose delays. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website  http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic applications/ctc.htm .  
 There will be no dose modifications for either pembrolizumab or Radium-223. Doses may be held for a maximum of [ADDRESS_1159248] art can be discussed with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_834676] a case-by-
case basis.  The patient may be continued on either agent if one is discontinued and the 
other is not thought to be contributing to the toxicity in question.  
 Doses of either agent will not be omitted but can be given when the patient meets protocol specified criteria  to treat . Interim reassessments between protocol specified 
dosing days are at the discretion of the treating physician.

Scans will stay on the same every 12 week  (+/- 7 days)  schedule even if doses are 
delayed.  6.1 Dose Delay Guidelines for Pembrolizumab
 
 Adverse events (both non-serious and serious) associated with pembrolizumab exposure may represent an immunologic etiology.  These adverse events may occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the last dose of treatment. Pembrolizumab must be withheld for drug- related toxicities and severe or life -threatening AEs as per the Table 
below.  
If an irAE is suspected, a  thorough evaluation should be conducted in an effort to 
possibl y rule out neoplastic,  infectious,  metabolic,  toxin or other  etiologic  causes prior  
to diagnosing an irAE. Serological, immunological,  and histological (biopsy) data 
should be considered to support the diagnosis of an immune- related  toxicity.

Dosing interruptions are permitted in the case of medical / surgical events or logistical reasons not related to study therapy (e.g., elective surgery, unrelated medical events, patient vacation, and/or holidays). Subjects should be placed back on pembroli zumab  
within [ADDRESS_1159254].  The reason for interruption should be documented in the patient's study 
record.  
 The following are considered events that  should be reported to the Sponsor-
Investigator within 24 hours of the site responsible investigator becoming aware of the event. The treatments are recommendations and the agents utilized should be determined by [CONTACT_834695].  
 Pneumonitis  
The following AE terms, if considered ≥ Grade 2, should be reported to the Sponsor-Investigator within 24 hours of the event: – Pneumonitis – Interstitial lung disease

 If symptoms indicate possible new or wors ening cardiac abnormalities additional testing 
and/or a cardiology consultation should be considered. All attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease, bacterial or viral infection . It is 
important that patients with a suspec ted diagnosis of pneumonitis be managed as 
per the guidance below until treatment -related pneumonitis is excluded. Treatment 
of both a potential infectious etiology and pneumonitis in parallel may be warranted. Management of the treatment of suspected pneu monitis with steroid 
treatment should not be delayed for a therapeutic trial of antibiotics. If an alternative 
diagnosis is established, the patient does not require management as below; however , the 
AE should be reported to the Sponsor-Investigator regard less of etiology. 
 Course of Action

 6.2 Dose Modifications for Radium-223  
 
Every effort should be made to administer the full dosing regimen  of radium-223. 
Adjustment of dose level is not permitted.  Study visits during the treatment period 
should occur at 4 week intervals (within a window of +/- 7 days). Dosing delays may be instituted under the following circumstances:  
 Myelosuppression:   
Treatment -related changes in hematology parameters may occur .  
 
• If a patient experiences CTCAE version 4.0 grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or anemia the administration of study drug should be delayed until recovery to grade 2 or better.  
• If a patient experiences CTCAE version 4.[ADDRESS_1159265] be discontinued.  
• Blood transfusion is acceptable between Radium-[ADDRESS_1159266] Compression:  
If the patient experiences spi[INVESTIGATOR_209534], the patient should be treated for the event, and may receive further study drug administration if adequately recovered.   Surgical Intervention:  
If surgery is required, the patient should continue with study treatment, if this is considered safe in the treating investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. The surgeon needs to be notified that the patient has been given radioactive drug, and needs to follow the guidelines for radioactive protection.

 7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical tr ial.  The 
following list of reported and/or potential AEs (Section 7.1) and the characteristics of an observed AE (Section 7.2) will determine whether the event requires expedited  reporting 
in addition  to routine reporting.  
 An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure.  Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the [COMPANY_006]’s product, is also an adverse event.  
 Adverse events may  occur during the course of the use of [COMPANY_006] product in clinical trials 
or within the follow -up period specified by [CONTACT_760], or prescribed in clinical practice, 
from overdose (whether accidental or intentional), from abuse and from withdrawal.  
 Adverse events may also occur in screened subjects during any pre- allocation baseline 
period as a result of a protocol-specified intervention, including washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure.  Progression of the cancer under study is not considered an adverse event unless it is considered to be drug related by [CONTACT_093].  All adverse events will be recorded from the time the consent form is signed through 30 days following cessation of treatment and at each examination on the Adverse Event case report forms/worksheets.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction 
rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

exposure to KEYTRUDA in an uncontrolled, open- label, multiple cohort trial (Trial 1). 
In Trial 1, the safety data are available from 411 patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and 550 patients with metastatic NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA at either 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks (n=61) or 10 mg/kg every 2 or 3 weeks (n=489). 
 
Among the 411 patients with metastatic melanoma enrolled in Trial 1, the median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 6.2 months (range 1 day to 24.6 months) with a median of 10 doses (range 1 to 51). The study population characteristics were: median age of 61 years (range 18 to 94), 39% age 65 years or older, 60% male, 97% white, 73% with M1c disease, 8% with brain metastases, 35% with elevated LDH, 54% with prior exposure to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], and 47% with two or more prior systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_657125].  
 KEYTRUDA was discontinued for adverse reactions in 9% of the [ADDRESS_1159270] two patients, that led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA 
were: pneumonitis, renal  failure, and pain. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 36% of 
patients receiving KEYTRUDA. The most frequent serious adverse drug reactions reported in 2% or more of patients in Trial 1 were renal failure, dyspnea, pneumonia, and cellulitis.  
 Table 9 presents adverse reactions identified from analyses of 89 patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg every three week s in one cohort of Trial 1. Patients had documented disease progression following 
treatment with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_164], if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. This cohort of Trial 1 excluded patients with severe immune- related toxicity related to 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], defined as any Grade 4 toxicity requiring treatment with corticosteroids or Grade 3 toxicity requiring corticosteroid treatment (greater than 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent dose) for greater than 12 weeks; a medical condition that required syste mic 
corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication; a history of pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease; or any active infection requiring therapy, including HIV or hepatitis B or C. Of the 89 patients in this cohort, the median age was 59 years ( range 18 
to 88), 33% were age 65 years or older, 53% were male, 98% were white, 44% had an elevated LDH, 84% had Stage M1c disease, 8% had brain metastases, and 70% receive two or more prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_657125]. The median duration  of 
exposure to KEYTRUDA was 6.2 months (range 1 day to 15.3 months) with a median of nine doses (range 1 to 23). Fifty- one percent of patients were exposed to KEYTRUDA 
for greater than 6 months and 21% for greater than 1 year.  KEYTRUDA was discontinued f or adverse reactions in 6% of the [ADDRESS_1159271] 
common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue, cough, nausea, pruritus, rash, decreased appetite, constipation, arthralgia, and diarrhea.

Immun e-Related Adverse Events  
 
An irAE  is defined as a clinically  significant  AE of any organ that is associated  
with stud y drug exposure, is of unknown etiolog y, and is consistent  with an immun e-
related mechanism. The most commonly reported immun e-related  adverse events 
across the dose-schedules in patients with melanoma were  rash, pruritus, vitiligo, 
hypothy roidism, arthralgia,  diarrhea,  and pneumonitis. All occurred in less than 5% of 
patients.   The organ most  frequentl y affected by [CONTACT_834696].   L ess frequentl y affected  tissues include thyroid gland, colon, lung, kidne y, and 
liver.  
 
These events can occu r after the first dose to several  months after the last dose of 
treatment. Mild  irAEs are usually treated  symptomatically  and do not require  dosing 
delays or discontinuation. Higher grad e and persistent lower grade irAEs typi[INVESTIGATOR_834680] s or other immunosuppressive agents (such as tumor necrosis factor blockers) , 
when sy stemic steroids  are not effective. E arly recognition of irAEs  and initiation  of 
treatment are critical to reduce the risk of complications, since the m ajority  of irAEs  are 
reversible  with the use of steroids and other immune suppressants.

A list of the adverse events and potential risks associated with the investigational or other agents administered in this study can be found in Section 7.1.  8.1 Pembrolizumab
4 
 8.1.1 Description  
 
Pembrolizumab (MK -3475) is a humanized anti-PD-1 mAb  of the IgG4/kappa 
isotype with a stabilizing  S228P sequence alteration  in the fragment  crystallizable  (Fc) 
region.  Pembrolizumab binds to human  PD-1 and blocks the interaction  between  PD-
1 and its ligands.   
 
The theoretical molecular  weight of the polypeptide is 146,288 Da and its 
theoretical pI [CONTACT_832] 7.5. The parental murine  anti-human PD-1 antibody ( hPD-1.09A) 
was produced by [CONTACT_834697]-1 DNA.  The pembrolizumab antibody 
was generated  by [CONTACT_834698] b y the Medical  Research 
Council (Cambridge, [LOCATION_006]) using complementari ly-determining region (CDR) grafting 
technology (U.S.  Patent No. 5,225,539). The gene segments  encoding the variable 
heavy and light chains of pembrolizumab , as well as human  IgG4 , were  codon-
optimized, synthesized, and ligated  into a vector.  
 
A single expression  plasmid,  pAPD11V1 -GA was constructed  for the expression of 
both th e heav y and light antibody chain s of pembrolizumab.  The nucleotide sequences 
encoding the hea vy and light chains, along with their respective promoters and  poly A 
signal sequences have been confirmed by [CONTACT_319799] A sequence ana lysis.  The pAPD11V1 -GA 
expression vector was subsequent ly used to transfect CHO -DXB-1 1 cells for the  
development of the pembrolizumab- producing cell line.  
 
PK dat 
a analysis of pembrolizumab administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic 
clearance, limited volume of distribution, and a long half- life (see IB).  
Pharmacodynamic data (IL -2 release assay) suggested that peripheral target engagement 
is durable (>21 days).

The bone biopsies will be core needle or excisional biopsies. These biopsies will be perf
ormed per standardized clinical guidelines at Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_834683] . Tissue will be 
embedded into paraffin. Sites that have been previo usly irradiated are not permitted .  The 
second biopsy should be done at the same site as the original biopsy when possible. If the 
first biopsy is non- diagnostic, a second pre-treatment biopsy should be performed if safe 
and acceptable to the patient and t reating physician. The patient will not be eligible  to 
enroll if no tumor tissue can be identified  by [CONTACT_834702] (touch prep evaluation 
will suffice). If the patient is enrolled and it is later determined that the first biopsy is not diagnostic or useful towards assessing the primary endpoint of increase in T cell infiltrate, then they will not be required to undergo the on- treatment biopsy.  If the patient

Informed written consent will be obtained following discussion of the risks (bleeding, infection, adjacent tissue injury, and pain) and benefits of the procedure. Biopsies will be performed using standard coaxial techniques under CT guidance without the administration of intravenous contrast. Several bone specimens ( when possible, ideally at least 4 -6 cores ) will be obtained. Samples will 
be given to a dedicated technician present during the procedure for sample processing. Conscious sedation will be administered by a trained radiology nurse using small doses of Versed and fentanyl titrated to the patient’s level of discomfort. Following th e biopsy, 
patients will be observed for [ADDRESS_1159303] dose of conscious sedation for any complications (severe pain, hematoma, neurologic deficit) prior to departing with a chaperone.

Appendix B.  
 Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form): The Brief Pain Inventory (short form) is a 15 item questionnaire. The BPI [INVESTIGATOR_613070]. When scoring the Brief Pain Inventory, two scores are calculated: the pain severity and pain inference score.  The pain severity score is calculated by [CONTACT_834704] 
3, 4, 5 and 6 and then dividing by 4. This gives a severity score out of 10. The pain interference score is calculated by [CONTACT_834704] 9a, b, c, d, e, f and g and then dividing by 7. This gives an interference score out of 10. Changes in mean scores for the two domains will be analyzed over time.   Analgesic Use: Participants will record all narcotic analgesic medications taken for pain in an analgesic diary provided by [CONTACT_834705]. Prior to each i nterval, a member of the clinical 
research team  will pre -populate the diary of each participant with the names and dosages 
of the narcotic medications prescribed, so that patients only have to indicate the number of doses taken by [CONTACT_489057] 24 hour period. For each interval, patients’ mean narcotics use will be calculated by [CONTACT_834706], averaged by [CONTACT_834707]. Changes in narcotic use will be qualified as decreased (including  discontinued), stable, or increased, based on the 
average daily narcotics use relative to the baseline interval.  
 Narcotics use will be considered stable if the average daily dose of a given narcotic was identical. Equianalgesia calculations will be requ ired to quantify narcotic use if patients 
changed narcotic type or if dosages were changed in patients concomitantly receiving different narcotic types. In cases where equianalgesia calculations were required, narcotics use will be considered stable if the calculated equivalents were within 5% of the baseline dose.

Substudy to be performed at DF CI only. 
 Bone scans will be routinely performed as part of the radiologic evaluations for measurement of tumor response. SPECT/CT will be obtained at the time of each bone 
scan required per protocol as part of standard of care for anatomic localization of lesions. Methods to quantitate bone tracer are not as established as the standardized uptake value (SUV) is for FDG -PET/CT, but new methods and software are now available to perform 
quantitation on SPECT/CT (Cachovan et al. EJNMMI; 3:45, 2013). Additional processing and quantitative analysis with newer software will be performed as part of research to e xplore if and how quantitative changes in bone tracer uptake on SPECT/CT 
correlate with markers of bone turnover, immune biomarkers , response on standard

If SPECT/CT is unable to be completed at screening or at on study timepoints for logistical reasons, it will not be considered a protocol violation.  9.5 Mutations in DNA Repair G enes in P rostate Cancer ( to be funded by [CONTACT_8996])  
 Prostate cancer represents a broad clinical and biological spectrum ranging from indolent tumors to aggressive disease resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Uncovering 
differences in the genetic makeup of tumors may improve our understanding of its clinical heterogeneity. Recent studies have helped define the molecular taxonomy of prostate cancer using comprehensive genomic analyses. Robinson et al. demonstrated the presence of a potential driver mutation in nearly all metastatic CRPC tumor samples which included frequent alterations in the AR (71.3%), PI3K (49%) and DNA damage repair (DDR) pa thways (22.7%).
25  
 It is estimated that human cells encounter thousands of DNA damaging events on a daily basis.
26 These events can be mediated by [CONTACT_4727] (deamination and hydrolytic 
reaction s, reactive oxygen species, DNA replication errors) and exogenous (ultraviolet 
light, ionizing radiation, alkylating agents and platinum compounds) sources.27,[ADDRESS_1159307] evolved several repair mechanisms such as base  excision repair (BER), mismatch repair (MMR), nucleotide excision repair 
(NER) and double strand DNA repair pathways which includes homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ).
[ADDRESS_1159308] and ovarian carcinom a and even some prostate cancers associated with germline 
BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 mutations (loss of function of these genes).   In addition to inherited germline mutations, these aberrations can be acquired through somatic changes. In advanced prostate cancer, germline and somatic mutations in DNA repair mechanisms have been reported in 11.8% and 22.7% of patients respectively.
25,[ADDRESS_1159309] mutations was associated with a shorter time to the emergence of castration res istance (11.8 months vs. 19.0 months; 
P=0.03) and an attenuated response to AR targeted therapy in castration resistant setting .
32 However, the presence of impaired DNA repair mechanisms also provides a 
therapeutic opportunity by [CONTACT_834708]. Exploiting the biological principle of “synthetic lethality”, the use of PARP inhibitors ha s 
been associated with impressive responses in patients with advanced ovarian cancer with somatic or germline BRCA mutations .
[ADDRESS_1159310] alterations in 33% of patients with CRPC who were treated with the PARP inhibitor olaparib in a phase 2 study and that it highly 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-498 
Protocol Version Date:  15 November 2019 
 
 67 
 correlated with response.34 Response rates were 33% in the overall study population 
compared to 88% in the cohort with DNA repair alterations, thus suggesting the potential 
role of these abnormalities as predictive  biomarkers of response. The impact of these 
mutations on the efficacy of radium-223, which induces double stranded DNA breaks and tumor cell death through alpha particles, is unknown.  We hypothesize that tumor cells with germline or somatic mutations in DDR genes will be more susceptible to the DNA damaging effects of radium- 223. Supporting this 
hypothesis, Steinberger et al recently reported a durable response with 2 courses of radium- 223 in a patient with a frameshift mutation in BRCA -2.
35 Further, the presence of 
impaired DNA repair pathways in the tumor cells has been associat ed with higher tumor 
mutational load, neo-antigen expression and response to immune checkpoint blockade across several solid tumors.
36-38 Through this proposed correlative work, we aim to utilize 
whole exome sequencing (WES) to assess the impact of DNA repair and other genomic alterations on the clinical efficacy of radium-[ADDRESS_1159311] 20% tumor nuclei. The DNA is then analyzed by [CONTACT_834709] g using a 
solution-phase Illumina hybrid capture kit and an Illumina HiSeq [ADDRESS_1159312] Institute using established methodology. In parallel, capture based whole transcriptome sequencing, which can be performed from either frozen or formalin -fixed 
samples will be done on all tumor samples to determine gene expression quantification through orthogonal methods, as well as identify fusion products and alternative splicing events. Furthermore, RNA analysis through whole transcriptome sequencing w ill enable 
quantification of immune cell compartments that may be related to specific DNA repair mutations (e.g. mismatch repair) and may impact predictions of response, and this analysis can enable enrichment of likely pathogenic DNA repair mutations by [CONTACT_834710].  
 
Circulating tumor derived cf -DNA in advanced prostate cancer 
 Genomic information derived from tissue based next generation sequencing is being increasingly employed in the clinic to guide treatment decisions. While it is an important step towards personalized medicine, there are limitations to tissue based sequencing assays. There can be significant genomic heterogeneity between the primary tumor and the metastatic sites.
39 As such, a biopsy of a single disease site might not be 
representative of the overall tumor clone. Further, genomic characteristics of tumors may change over the course of treatment with emergence of different resistant mechanisms .
40-
42 Although biopsy of a metastatic site can provide genetic information at a given stage in 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-498 
Protocol Version Date:  [ADDRESS_1159313] resistance or sensitivity to established and investigational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Supporting this concept, Salvi et al demonstrated that pretreatment copy number gain in AR and CYP17A1 genes detected in cf- DNA samples 
was predictive of poor overall survival and progression- free survival (PFS).
46 Further, by 
[CONTACT_834711], on treatment, and at the time of disease progression, it may be possible to uncover novel mutations, copy number alterations and somatic variants which can be acquired as a result of clonal evolution and lead to treatment failure .
47,48 A major advantage of cf -DNA is that the sample is obtained by a 
simple blood draw and does not require a more invasive tumor biopsy.  Whole genome sequencing of circulating tumor derived cell free DNA  
 
Blood samples will be obtained from patients enrolled in both arms prior to treatment initiation (week 1), on therapy at week 5 and week 13, and at the time of disease progression. Whole genome sequencing will be performed at 0.1x coverage, which we term ultra -low pass whole genome sequencing (ULPWGS). The sequencing information 
derived from ULPWGS will be used to estimate “tumor purity”, which is defined as percent of circulating DNA derived from tumor cells in th e blood, and to identify copy 
number alterations in the tumor using an adaptation of a probabilistic model, called ichorCNA.

DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-498 
Protocol Version Date:  [ADDRESS_1159320] – Solid Tumors  
 For the purposes of this study, participants should be re-evaluated for response every 12 weeks (+/ - 7 days).  In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be 
obtained 12 (not less t han 6) weeks following initial documentation of progressive 
disease.  Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1)
[ADDRESS_1159321] had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for non- target disease.  The response 
assessment is based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the 
lesions.  
 
11.1.2 Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease :   
 
Note: Patients are not  elig ible if they have measurable disease for this study.  
 Measurable lesions are defined as those t hat
  can be accurately measured in at least 
one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ [ADDRESS_1159322] x-ray or ≥[ADDRESS_1159323] be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of 
centimeters).  
 Note
: Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irra diated area can still be  
considered measurable if they have grown since the last time of radiation on at 
least 2 subsequent scans.   Malignant lymph nodes:  To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be ≥[ADDRESS_1159324] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-498 
Protocol Version Date:  15 November 2019 
 
 73 
 Non-measurable disease :  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small 
lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 
mm short axis), are considered non- measurable disease.  Bone lesions, 
leptomen ingeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions are all considered non -measurable.  
 Note
: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple 
cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non- cystic lesions are present in the same participant, these are 
preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 Non-target lesions.  All bone l
 esions should be identified as non- target lesions 
and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow up.  
 11.1.3 Me
thods for Evaluation  of Disease  
 Imaging studies will be reviewed by [CONTACT_834712].  Ultimately, all scans will undergo central review 
at DFCI  for final response analysis .  However, for eligibility and ongoing 
response assessment while on study therapy, UCSF review will be per investigator assessment.   All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler, calipers, or a digital measurement tool.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as close ly as possible to the beginning of treatment and not more than 
42 days before the beginning of the treatment.  
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during fo llow-up. 
Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_147877](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 Conventional CT and MRI. This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on 
CT scan based on the assumption that CT thickness is 5mm or less. If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size of a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).   
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-498 
Protocol Version Date:  [ADDRESS_1159325], spatial, and 
temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow -up should be the 
same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence paramete rs for all scanners, body parts, 
and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should be performed with breath- hold scanning techniques, if 
possible.  Tumor markers.  Tumor 
 markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If 
markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a participant to be considered in complete clinical response.   
 Cytology, Histology. The se te
 chniques can be used to differentiate between 
partial responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases.  The cyt
ological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears 
or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor h as met criteria for 
response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable 
disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive 
disease.  
 
11.1.4 Evaluation of Bone  Lesions 
 
Existing bone metastases will be the o nly lesions in some patients. Because bone lesions 
are notoriously difficult to follow, ‘progression’ in non -target lesions is defined as the 
appearance of [ADDRESS_1159326] reassessment only, a confirmatory scan performed 6 or more weeks later is required that shows a minimum of 2 or more additional new lesions (PCWG2 criteria).   
 Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target le
 sions and normalization of 
PSA.  All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).  
 Non-CR/Non -PD:  P
 ersistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of 
tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 Progressive Disease (PD) :  Appea
 rance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression  of existing non- targe t lesions. It must be representative of overall disease 
status change, not a single lesion increase.     
 

DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-498 
Protocol Version Date:  15 November 2019 
 
 75 
 Although a clear progression of “non- target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_343], and the progression status 
should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator).  
 Definitions of Progress ion: 
1. Bone Progression: Appearance of [ADDRESS_1159327] scan tha t shows the 
change.   2. Soft Tissue Progression: Soft tissue disease progression by [CONTACT_100694] v1.[ADDRESS_1159328] assessment be confirmed by a second scan 6 or m ore weeks later.  
Note that for some treatments, a  lesion may increase in size before it decreases.  
 3. Symptomatic Progression : 
Symptomatic progression is defined as evidence of unequivocal symptomatic or clinical progression defined by [CONTACT_2669] 1 of the following:  
• A marked escalation in cancer -related pain that is assessed by [CONTACT_834713].   Ignore 
early changes (≤ 12 weeks) in pain or health- related quality of life in absence of 
compelling evidence of disease progression.   Confirm progression of pain or 
health -related quality of life ≥ 3 weeks later  
• An immediate need for initiation of new anticancer treatment or surgical 
intervention for complications due to tumor progression. Palliative radiation is allowed while on therapy to combat symptomatic/clinical progression and does not require that the patien t discontinue study therapy unless treating investigator 
does not believe they are deriving any clinical benefit.   
• A marked deterioration in ECOG performance status to Grade 3 or higher, or  
• It is felt to be in the best interest of the patient to come off study due to clinical 
progression 
 
11.1.5 Evaluation of New Lesions 
 The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal (i.e. not due to difference in scanning technique, imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre -existing lesions). However, a lesion identified 
on a follow- up scan in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline 
is considered new and will indicate PD. If a new lesion is equivoca l (because 
of small size etc.), follow -up evaluation will clarify if it truly represents new 
disease and if PD is confirmed, progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan on which the lesion was discovered. 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-498 
Protocol Version Date:  [ADDRESS_1159329] response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  Th e patient's best response assignment will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.  
 
For Participants with Non- Measurable Disease ( i.e., Non- Target Disease) : all 
patients in this study will have non- measurable bone only disease

∗ ‘Non -CR/non -PD’ is preferred over ‘stable disease’ for non -target disease since SD is 
increasingly used as an endpoint for assessment of efficacy in some trials so to assign 
this category when no lesions can be measured is not advised  
 11.1.7 Duration of Response  
 Duration of overall response :  Th
 e duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progres sive disease is objectively documented 
(taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, or death due to any cause. Participants without events reported are censored at the last disease evaluation) . 
 Duration of overall complete response : The
  duration of overall CR is measured 
from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented, or death due to any cause. Participants withou t events reported are censored at the last disease evaluation.   
 Duration of stable disease :  St
 able disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded sinc e the treatment started, including the baseline 
measurements.  
 
11.1.8 Eva
luation of Time to Event Endpoints 
 Progression- Free S
 urvival : Progression -Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time 
from randomization (or registration) to the earlier of progression or death due to 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-498 
Protocol Version Date:  [ADDRESS_1159330] disease evaluation.  
 Time to Progression : Time
  to Progression (TTP) is defined as the time from 
randomization (or registration) to progression, or censored at date of last disease evaluation for those without progression reported.   Overall Survival : Ove
 rall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization 
(or registration) to death due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive.  
11.1.9 Me
thods for Evaluation of Changes in PSA 
 Biochemical Response:
53 
The laboratory will utilize a consistent method to check serum PSA at baseline, e very 
other cycle while on treatment, and at study termination.  
 PSA decline ≥50% from baseline to 12 weeks of therapy and which has been confirmed 
with a second PSA at ≥ 3 weeks later.  
 
Percent change in serum PSA :
23 
The percent change (rise or fall) from baseline at 12 weeks, and separately, the maximal change (rise or fall) at any time will be recorded using a waterfall plot.  
 PSA Progression: 
PSA progression is defined as ≥25% increase and ≥2 ng/mL increase above the nadir or 
baseline value for patients who had a PSA decrease on treatment which is confirmed by a 
second value 3 or more weeks later.    
For patients without a decrease on treatment, PSA progression is defined as ≥25% and a ≥2 ng/mL after [ADDRESS_1159331] be confirmed at the next study visit 4 weeks later.   PSA progression alone will not  be co
 nsidered diagnostic of  disease progression, and 
will not be used as a reason to discontinue study treatment.

13.4 Sample size justification  
 
The study plans to enroll 45 pa tients to ensure 36 patients to include in the primary analysis 
after taking into consideration that 20% patients may be lost to follow -up or have 
inadequate serum and tissue specimens for analysis.  The sample size justification is based on comparisons between the treatment arms of the 
increase in CD4+ T or CD8+T cell infiltration leve ls measured in the bone biopsy specimen 
from baseline to [ADDRESS_1159336] a higher increase in CD8+ and CD4+ T cell 
infiltration from baseline to 8 weeks on treatment than patients treated with radium -223 
alone. While little is known of CD8+ T cell levels in metastatic prostate cancer specimens, 
a 50% to 80% difference between the treatment arms for the increase in CD4+ or CD8+ T 
cells would represent a biologically meaningful treatment effect.  With a total of 36 patients 
with adequate tissue/specimens for analysis, the study would provide 24 patients treated 
with the combination and 12 patients treated with radium- 223 monotherapy. T here would 
be 91% statistical power to detect a difference of increase in CD4/8 cell infiltration levels

  13.5 Safety Monitoring Plan 
 Give there is no safety data for the combination therapy of pembrolizumab and radium-
223, an early safety monitoring will be conducted to en sure that the combination therapy 
is well tolerated. A  rate of targeted grade 3-5 AEs, particularly related to induction of 
immune phenomenon such as pneumonitis, colitis, and severe rash, in excess of 33% with 
combination therapy would be  of concern. The safety assessment s will be implemented 
after 15 (~50%) of the planned [ADDRESS_1159339] completed 
12 weeks of combination therapy (including those who discontinued treatment because of toxicity), a focused safety review will be conducted. An estimated targeted AE rate with a one-sided binomial 90% CI will be constructed.  If [ADDRESS_1159340] 15 subjects 
experience the targeted AEs (an observed 33% AEs rate, to have a upper bound of the CI 
<=53 %), then the enrollment of combination therapy arm may be suspended pending the 
study team and DSMC  review. The following table gives the operating characteristics of 
the early safety stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]; if the true unknown probability of grade ≥ 3 AEs rate is 40 % or 
higher , the probability of observing 5 or more subjects with grade ≥ 3 AEs will be greater 
than 78.3% at the time of AE assessment.

The trial will be reviewed semi -annually by [CONTACT_57954]/HCC Data and Safety Monitoring 
Board.  
 In addition to summarizing all AEs according to type and grade, all grade 4 (or higher) AEs will be listed for review.  
 
13.6 Definition of Analysis Populations  
 Safety p opulation: All patients who have received  at least one dose of radium -223 or 
pembrolizumab will be included in safety assessment.  
 Primary analysis population: All patients who receive at least one dose of radium -[ADDRESS_1159341] bone biopsy assessment at baseline 
and 8 weeks will be included to assess primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints.  13.7 Analysis of Primary Endpoints  
 The extent of immune cell infiltration  (in t
 he bone biopsy specimens): The comparison of 
an increase in CD4+ T or CD8+ T cell infiltration levels measured in the bone biopsy 
specimen from baseline and 8 weeks between the treatment arms will use Wilcoxon rank 
sum tests . The difference and the 95% confidence interval will also be provided. 
 13.8 An 
alysis of Secondary E ndpoints  
 Safety and Tolerability: All adverse events recorded during the trial will be summarized for the safety population. The incidence of events that is new or worsening from the time of first dose of treatment will be summarized according to system organ class term, severity (based on CTCAE version 4.0 grade), type of adverse event, and relation to study treatment. For the combination therapy, special interests include toxicities related to induction of immune phenomenon such as pneumonitis, colitis, and severe rash.  The frequency of AEs will be summarized separately according to treatment arms, with 9 0% 
exact binomial confidence intervals (CI). The proportion of patients in each arm with grade [ADDRESS_1159342] binomial 9 0% CI.  
 
Deaths reportable as SAEs and non -fatal serious adverse events will be listed by [CONTACT_834714], and type of adverse event.

PFS and OS:  The distributions of time to PSA progression, PFS and OS will each be 
summarized using the product- limit method of Kaplan -Meier according to treatment 
arms. Median times for each endpoint will be presented with two-sided 95% confidence intervals estimated using log(-log(survival)) methodology. Kaplan- Meier estimates of the 
endpoints at 6 or 12 months after treatment initiation may also be presented with two -
sided 95% confidence intervals.  13.9 Analysis of Exploratory Clinical Endpoints  
 The endpoints will be summarized descriptively and graphically by [CONTACT_15500]. Tests for intra -patient changes in values while on combination treatment will use 
Wilcoxon signed-rank for continuous endpoints; categorical endpoints at two timepoints will be cross -tabulated and relevant proportions will be reported with confidence 
intervals. Changes in values will also be compared between treatment groups using the Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous endpoints.  The Kaplan -Meier method will be 
employed to characterize the distributions of time to event endpoints.  Specifically,   Time to PSA progression: the distributions of time to PSA progression will be summarized using Kaplan -Meier according to treatment arms. Median times to PSA 
progression wil l be presented with two -sided 95% confidence intervals.  
 PSA response:  the proportion of patients with a PSA response will be presented with a 
two-sided 95% confidence interval  (CI) using exact binominal method according to the 
treatment arms. Change in PSA will also be summarized descriptively according to the treatment arms and the changes in PSA will also be compared between treatment groups using the Wilcoxon rank sum tests.  Symptomatic skeletal events (SSEs): the proportion of patients with SSEs will be presented with a two -sided 95% confidence interval  (CI) using  exact binominal method 
and the distributions of time to first SSEs will be summarized using Kaplan -Meier plots 
according to the treatment arms.   
 Quality of life: descriptive statistics at each time point and changes over time will be provided for quality of life, pain and analgesic use measures. Mixed models may be used to explore the impact of time on quality of life and pain adjusting for treatment arms and other relevant factors.  
 Time to introduction of analgesic use  will be summarized using Kaplan -Meier plots 
according to the treatment arms.

 Will be done at the Fong Lab at UCSF and DFCI Center for Molecular Oncology Core . 
 
We hypothesize that the number of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells will significantly increase following anti -PD-1 antibody treatment. IHC will be performed on bone metastasis 
biopsies obtained at baseline and on treatment to quantify tumor infiltration by [CONTACT_398]8+ T cells, Tregs (FoxP3+ CD4+ cells), and total CD4 T cells (in both normal and tumor tissue).   
We hypothesize that the treatment with Radium -[ADDRESS_1159343] - treatment will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_14202] 25th percentile of 
cumulative reads after sorting by [CONTACT_14203]. Repertoire change between sequencing experiments will be measured using Morisita’s distance.  
To detect circulating antibodies in sera derived from the pretreatment and  on therapy- 
timepoints, spotted antigen arrays will be used. After standard preprocessing of the protein array data, Cluster and Treeview software will be used for unsupervised clustering of the data with Pearson correlation and complete linkage. For each array,  an 
antigen is identified as being detected if its value is above the median. To determine the number of up- and down modulated antibodies, the difference in log2 intensity values of pretreatment and post- treatment samples will be taken for each patient to  identify 
antigens that are detected differentially due to treatment. Number of antibodies with at least [ADDRESS_1159344].  Tumor tissue from each patient’s biopsy will be evaluated by [CONTACT_505721] -L1 levels prior 
to administration of the drug. Two independent pathologists who are blinded to the patients ’ clinical outcomes (e.g., response, survival) will score the p ercentage of tumor 
cells exhibiting cell -surface staining for PD -L1. PD -L1 positivity is defined per core by a 
5% expression threshold.
54,55 Other levels of PD -L1 positivity will be explored. Patients 
with mu ltiple cores will be considered PD -L1–positive if any specimen meets this 
criterion. Similarly , tumor will be stained for other immune checkpoints such as TIM -3, 
LAG-3, and PD- L2. 
 The bone metastasis biopsies will be evaluated to assess whether increased levels of MDSCs, TGF -β, iNOS, arginase, or Tregs which have been linked with T cell 
suppression
[ADDRESS_1159345] -treatment 
levels will also be characterized.

We hypothesize that presence of these mutations would sensitize tumor cells to the DNA 
damaging effects of radium -223 and result in a longer PFS. The study is planned to enroll 
45 patients who will receive radium -223. Assuming 10% will not have adequate tissue 
for sampling, we estimate that we will have adequate samples from at least [ADDRESS_1159348] with a one- sided type I error of 
0.15, there is 80% statistical power to detect an improvement in median PFS from 6 months (patients without DNA repair mutation) to 12 months (patients with a DNA repair pathway mutation) corresponding to hazard ratio of 0.50 (Table 21).

 sided 95% CI estimated using log( -log(survival)) methodology. Log- rank test will be  used 
to compare the median PFSs between the DDR mutation groups. Kaplan- Meier estimates 
of the endpoints at 6 or 12 months after treatment initiation may also be presented with 
two-sided 95% confidence intervals.  
 For the cfDNA analysis, patients will be dichotomized based on baseline tumor purity status into 2 groups: high (tumor purity >7.5%) vs . low (tumor purity ≤ 7.5%). The cutoff 
choice was based on the prior study that demonstrated 7.5% to be the lower limit of accurate detection for tumor derived c f-DNA.
57 Kaplan -Meier estimates will be used to 
assess the distribution of PFS according to tumor purity status. Medians of time to PFS will be shown with two- sided 95% CIs.  
 An exploratory landmark analysis will be performed and will include all patients who have  
not progressed (no PFS event) by [ADDRESS_1159350] available cf -DNA at baseline and 
week 13.  Change in tumor purity from baseline to week 13 on therapy would be used as a binary variable (increase/stable tumor purity vs. decreased tumor purity) to assess  its 
impact on subsequent PFS. The [ADDRESS_1159351] restaging scans (12 weeks) after initiation of therapy and allow for sufficient exposure to pembrolizumab considering prior studies in melanoma and NSCLC have demonstra ted a 
median time to response of around [ADDRESS_1159352] ratio (increase/stable tumor purity vs. decreased tumor purity) and corresponding 95% CI.   The proportion of patients with PSA response (≥ 50% decline from baseline) will be presented with a two -sided 95% CI using exact binominal method according to bas eline 
genomic alternation (e.g., DDR mutations). Change in PSA will also be summarized descriptively according to the genomic alteration groups and the changes in PSA will also be compared between genomic alteration groups using the Wilcoxon rank sum tests  Other secondary objectives will be summarized descriptively.   13.[ADDRESS_1159353] be assessed for response/outcome to therapy, even if there ar e major protocol therapy deviations.   
 Subanalyses may then be performed on the basis of a subset of participants,

Protocol Version Date:  [ADDRESS_1159354] been identified (e.g., 
early death due to other reasons, early discontinuation of tr eatment, major protocol 
violations, etc.).  However, these subanalyses may not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions concerning treatment efficacy, and the reasons for excluding participants from the analysis should be clearly reported.  If applicable  to the 
endpoint, the 95% confidence intervals will be provided.

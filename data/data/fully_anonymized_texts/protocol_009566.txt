enable  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -addicted  individuals  to discontinue  the misuse  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_470072]. Buprenorphine's opi[INVESTIGATOR_470073], even  with further  dose  increases.  This "ceiling  effect"  lowers  
the risk of misuse, dependency, and side effects  (1). 
2.1.2  Clinical  Experience  
Monthly, injectable, buprenorphine extended -release (XRB, SublocadeTM, Indivior) is  the 
most recently approved pharmacotherapy for opi[INVESTIGATOR_470074] U.S.(2). XRB  is 
available as of March -2018 in a pre -mixed subcutaneous formulation, administered  monthly, 
and equivalent to a 16 -24mg/day maintenance dose of sublingual  buprenorphine -naloxone  
(SLB). In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_87921], Buprenorphine extended -release (XRB) or  sublingual 
buprenorphine (SLB) daily maintenance will be provided per usual Opi[INVESTIGATOR_470075]-jail and prior to release.  Both medications  will be available  through  the 
study and the Bellevue Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_470076] -of-charge. XRB consists of  a 
once monthly abdominal subcutaneous injection using a pre -filled syringe, per  usual  
package insert instructions. SLB is a delivered daily by [CONTACT_470153] -jail (controlled 
substances are not self -administered in -jail). Post -release, all participants may elect  to 
continue SLB maintenance with the Bellevue Primary Care Addiction Medicine clinic, or  may 
pursue SLB maintenance from non -NYU/Bel levue community providers. SLB is  available  
free of charge  to uninsured  patients  at Bellevue  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58578],  or participants  may fill SLB 
prescriptions at community pharmacies. SLB medication will not be provided by [CONTACT_470154].  
2.2 Background/preval ence of research  topic  
In 2016,  opi[INVESTIGATOR_470077] 42,249  deaths  and opi[INVESTIGATOR_470078] 1999  (3). On average,  115 Americans  die every  day from an opi[INVESTIGATOR_293279]  
(4). The opi[INVESTIGATOR_470079] (methadone, extended -release  
naltrexone,  buprenorphine)  in criminal  justice  and primary  care populations.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_470080], only  about  30% of individuals initiating buprenorphine maintenance in -jail successfully 
link to community treatment post -release. XRB is newly FDA approved and its effectiveness 
in a criminal justice setting is promising but  untested.

3 - Rationale/Significance  
3.[ADDRESS_602501] methadone and buprenorphine maintenance program for adults with opi[INVESTIGATOR_470081] (OUD). However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_470082] -of-care, outcomes for all OUD  patients,  
including buprenorphine patients, in NYC following release from jail are in need  of 
improvement. Overdose rates in NYC c ontinue to worsen, including among  recently 
incarcerated individuals (5). Only about 30% of individuals initiating  buprenorphine  
maintenance for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2537] (OUDs) in -jail currently successfully link to  community 
treatment post -release (6), which has been a finding in a previous NIDA clinical trial  and 
observational studies we have conducted at NYU -Bellevue (7,  8). 
3.2 Purpose of Study/Potential  Impact  
Monthly, injectable, buprenorphine extended -release (XRB, SublocadeTM, Indivior) is  the 
most recently approved pharmacotherapy for opi[INVESTIGATOR_470083]. XRB  is 
available as of March -2018 in a pre -mixed subcutaneous formulation, administered  monthly, 
and equivalent to a 16 -24mg/day maintenance dose of sublingual  buprenorphine -naloxone  
(SLB). 
XRB offers several advantages to other forms of 'medication treatment  for opi[INVESTIGATOR_470084]’ (MOUD), which currently consist of daily sublingual buprenorphine  (Suboxone 
films, Zubsolv, or generic buprenorphine -naloxone tablets), daily oral  methadone  
maintenance delivered in Opi[INVESTIGATOR_211783], or extended -release naltrexone  (XR- 
NTX). None of these earlier medications have proven to be 'killer apps', and uptake of   
MOUD in US correctional facilities (jails, prisons) and community -supervised po pulations  
(drug courts, parole programs) lag the public health need and high overdose risk in these  
settings and populations. Buprenorphine products in particular have been relatively 
shunned in  CJS,  likely due to staffing constraints required by [CONTACT_470155],  concerns regarding diversion and misuse, and common stigmas related to opi[INVESTIGATOR_470085]  (methadone or buprenorphine) maintenance approaches  (9). 
NYC jails are an exception to this sub -par US CJS standard, in part due to the  current 
leadership  of this proposal's  Co-Investigators  at NYC  Health+Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_470086], Ross MacDonald MD and Jonathan Giftos MD, who are, respectively,  Chief  
Medical Officer and Clinical Director of Substance Use Treatment/Medical Dir ector of  the 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_470087]. NYC has a robust methadone  and 
buprenorphine maintenance program for adults with OUD. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_470088] -of-care, 
outcomes for all OUD patients, including buprenorphine patients, in NYC follo wing release 
from jail are in need of improvement. Overdose rates in NYC continue to worsen,  including  
among recently incarcerated individuals (5). Only about 30% of individuals  initiating  
buprenorphine maintenance for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2537] (OUDs) in -jail currently  successfully 
link to community treatment post -release (6) which has been a finding in a previous  NIDA  
clinical trial and observational studies we have conducted at NYU -Bellevue (7, 8) .  Major 
obstacles  to office -based  opi[INVESTIGATOR_433696]  (OBOT)  with  MOUD following re -entry include 
limited mobility and communication due to  incarceration,  administrative support for bridging 
Study Numbe r s18 -[ZIP_CODE]  December 11 , 2019 Version 10 
13  
 to a new clinic, high risks of drug/alcohol relapse,  and rigid,  impersonal  treatment  'systems'  
which  are often  not customized  to or welcoming  of the recently  incarcerated.  
The new buprenorphine  extended -release  formulation  (XRB)  has several  potential  feasibility  
and effectiveness  advantages  vs. daily sublingual  buprenorphine  (SLB),  including:  1) fewer  
overall medical, nursing, and pharmacy visits, fewer correctional staff hours, and  potentially  
lower  program  costs  vs. daily  observed  dosing,  2) near zero probability  of diversion/misuse  
vs. frequent diversion, 3) an improved, long -acting 'bridge' of medication adherence  at 
release, which is crucial as patients struggle to continue daily SLB adherence,  avoid  
relapse, and connect to community treatment. The current NYC jail  high-volume  
buprenorphine maintenance program provides an ideal setting in which to pi[INVESTIGATOR_470089]. 
SLB.  
Rikers  Island  and the [LOCATION_001] City Department  of Corrections  administered  jail system  in 
NYC  is a prominent  exception  to US norms.  NYC  Health+Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_470090], which administers all jail -based health care in NYC,  and has a  high- 
volume program for both continuing existing SLB patients through incarceration  and 
initiating  SLB in new patients  prior to release.  NYC  jails provide  an ideal  setting  in which  to 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_470091]-based  use of newer  extended -release  buprenorphine  comp ounds.  Two members  of 
NYC  Health+Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_470092],  are key co-investigators  in this proposal.  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_470093] 
a first of its kind evaluation  of XRB in a criminal  justice,  underserved  population  at high risk 
or relapse and  overdose.  
3.3.[ADDRESS_602502] community treatment visit, and potentially a  lower  
risk of relapse to heroin and other drug/alcohol use vs. SLB.  In addition the XRB  is 
delivered free of charge. The SLB treatment -as-usual group will receive the  same 
compensation and encouragement to continue care both in custody and following  release, 
which will be above and beyond u sual care.  Both arms, however, may experience  no 
benefit from study participation, if the medications are not effective, acceptable, or if  post- 
release follow -up is not pursued or completed. The extra XRB medical treatment, pre - and 
post-release counseli ng (both arms), and monetary compensation (both arms) is  intended  
and unlikely  to be coercive  – that is, motivate  persons  to participate  in the trial against  their 
preferences or wishes. These benefits are on par with other recent and approved NYC  jail 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_470094] -coercive benefits to  all 
participants. The XRB medication free of charge or the modest monetary compensation  is 
unlikely to sway an individual with other good options including jail -based me thadone  and 
buprenorphine  treatment  and no other  interest  in participating  in or following  up during  the 
trial.

3.3.2  Potential Risks  
Any relapse  to illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_470095] (or while  incarcerated)  implies  a risk of death  and disability,  and 
some proportion of participants in all three arms can be expected not to respond  to 
treatment and resume opi[INVESTIGATOR_74527]/or other drug and alcohol use. All participants  relapsing 
post-release and struggling with on -going drug and alcohol use will be counseled  and 
referred  by [CONTACT_470156],  including  the immediately  available  
addiction services available at Bellevue Hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (emergency detoxification with referral  to 
residential treatment or supportive housing, methadone treatment, buprenorphine,  intensive  
outpatient, dual  diagnosis).  
Sublingual Buprenorphine -Naloxone Treatment Arm . The risks of SLB are the usual  risks 
experienced  by [CONTACT_470157],  which  is 
first-line treatment for opi[INVESTIGATOR_470096].  Persons  
receiving SLB may experience several common side effects such as drowsiness,  dizziness,  
constipation, or headaches. The SLB arm will otherwise not be exposed to risks  beyond  
those  of usual  care,  which  will be provided  by [CONTACT_470158].  Further,  
participants in the SLB arm will have already agreed to these risks and benefits of an  SLB 
treatment program prior to recruitment and enrollment, as their choice to engage in jail  SLB 
will have been established well before enrollment, which will occur at the end of  the 
incarceration  period.  
Buprenorphine  Extended -Release  Treatment  Arm. XRB carries  the same  potential  systemic 
buprenorphine -related  side effects  as SRB.  XRB also carries  risks from the injection.  
Injection site soreness is possible and usually well tolerated. More severe injection  site 
reactions, although rare, include swelling, itching, and pain. All injections sites will  be 
inspected and monitored by [CONTACT_470159].  
Concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_470097], respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341],  and 
death.  Urine  toxicology  biometric  tests  will be used  to ensure  persons  receiving  both SLB 
and XRB have not taken any other substances. Participants will be educated regarding  the 
risks of concomitant  use of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651],  sedatives,  opi[INVESTIGATOR_470098].  
Additionally, if a participant requires opi[INVESTIGATOR_470099],  they will likely  not have  adequate  pain relief  from usual  doses  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_470100]. Particip ants should tell the treating clinician that they are participating in  this 
clinical study and will need non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_470101], which they should receive only in a monitored medical setting, such as  an 
emergency  room.  As a result,  participants  may experience  higher  level of pain.  
Risk/Benefit  Ratio:  Most  of the risks described  are expected  adverse  events  associated  with 
XRB and SLB,  or those  of baseline  opi[INVESTIGATOR_470102]-to-community  ETAU  or MTP.  
The risks of the active treatment arms, XRB and SLB are likely small compared to  the 
expected benefit of discontinuing opi[INVESTIGATOR_20856].

4 - Study  Objectives  
4.1 Hypothesis  
Primary Aim hypothesis: We hypothesize that XRB will be a feasible, effective,  and 
preferred/accepted  medication  assisted  therapy  for OUDs  in jail as compared  to SLB.  
Secondary  Aim 1 hypothesis:  We hypothesize  that XRB will be more  effective  in improving  
rates  of community  treatment  initiation/continuation  post-release  as compared  to SLB.  
Secondary  Aim 2 Hypothesis:  We hypothesize  that XRB will be more  effective  in decreasing  
illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_470103] -release as compared to  SLB.  
Secondary Aim 3 Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the use of  XRB vs. SLB will lead  to 
better outcomes in the context of XRNTX, ETAU, and Methadone outcomes accrued in  the 
larger SOMATICS -XOR  RCT.  
4.2 Primary Objective  
Feasibility  and Implementation:  Estimate  the feasibility  and ease  of use of XRB vs. SLB as 
measured  by [CONTACT_470160],  in-treatment  patient  satisfaction, 
patient qualitative interviews,  jail visit frequency and program cost estimates, and rates of 
medication  diversion.  
4.3 Secondary Objectives  
Treatment  Retention:  Estim ate the effectiveness  of XRB vs. SLB in improving  rates  of 
community treatment initiation/continuation  post-release.  
Clinical  Effectiveness:  Estimate  the effectiveness  of XRB vs. SLB in decreasing  illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]  
(e.g. heroin) use  post-release.  
Naturalistic  Comparative  Effectiveness:  Evaluate  outcomes  of XRB vs. SLB in the context  of 
the XRNTX,  ETAU,  and Methadone  outcomes  accrued  in the larger  SOMATICS -XOR  RCT.

5 - Study  Design  
5.1 General Design  
This is a phase  IV, 8 week,  pi[INVESTIGATOR_370065] -of-concept  randomized  controlled  trial, open -label  and 
unblinded  of XRB vs SLB (N=50)  that takes  advantage  of the existing  SOMATICS -XOR  U01 
(NIDA) trial  design.  
5.1.[ADDRESS_602503] study visit 5 week 8. Active treatment w ill continue after the Week 8 study visit 
through Week 20 wherein participants will be eligible to receive initial and/or additional XRB 
injections. A safety visit, in which no medication is administered, will be conducted at Week 
[ADDRESS_602504]. Participants (N=50) will be recruited from Rikers Island  NYC  
Jail and will then complete  all follow -up visits  at Bellevue  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_470104]. The NYU 
School of Medicine Institutional Review Board (IRB) is serving as the IRB of record for 
Health+Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_470105].  
Sites : The NYC jail system houses approximately 8,000 -9,000 inmates daily in 11+  inmate  
facilities, [ADDRESS_602505] (90%) are adults detained  on  
charges or sentenced to misdemeanor charges and likely to leave jail and return to  the 
community following an average pretrial detention of several weeks or after serving  a 
misdemeano r sentence of less than one year. The jail Opi[INVESTIGATOR_470106], a male admission facility (Anna M Kross Center), a  male 
sentenced -inmate facility (Eric M Taylor Center), and a single female facility (Rose M  Singe r 
Center),  all located  on Rikers  Island  in the Bronx.  For the purposes  of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268],  participants  
will be recruited from the Eric M Taylor Center and the Rose M Singer Center. The  jail 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_470107] 100 -200 patients daily with  sublingual 
buprenorphine,  this pi[INVESTIGATOR_470108],  and 500-800 daily with methadone  maintenance.  
All  follow -up  will  be  conducted  at  the  Bellevue  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58578]'s  Adult  Primary

 per participant, rates of medication diversion, and open -ended interviews with  patients  
regarding treatment satisfaction and ease of  use. Additional qualitative interviews will be 
conducted with eligible participants to further examine opi[INVESTIGATOR_470109] -release buprenorphine, in -jail and within the community.  
5.2.2  Secondary and Exploratory Outcome  Variables  
Seconda ry Aims 1 -3 will be measured utilizing the following assessments:  baseline  
demographics, baseline ASI -Lite, baseline MOUD (medication treatment for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2428]) exposure/preference, Timeline Followback, urine  toxicology  results, treatment 
retention , and NYS Prescription Monitoring Data. XRNTX, ETAU,  and Methadone outcomes 
will be taken from the SOMATICS -XOR U01 parent  study.  
5.3 Study  Population  
Adult jail inmates with upcoming release date, current opi[INVESTIGATOR_470110] -naloxone  (N=50).  
5.3.1  Number of  Participants  
N=50.  A total sample  size of N=[ADDRESS_602506]- 
release (71% vs. 30% success favoring XRB; two -sided alpha of 0.05; 80+%  power).  
5.3.2  Eligibility Criteria/Vulnerable Populations  
Inclusion  criteria  
1) Adults >18yo incarcerated in NYC jails with known release  dates.  
2) DSM -V criteria for current opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (DSM -IV opi[INVESTIGATOR_2495] d dependence).  
3) Currently maintained on sublingual buprenorphine -naloxone in the NYC jail  opi[INVESTIGATOR_470111].  
Exclusion  Criteria  
1) Individual  not interested  in XRB treatment.  Current  SLB patients  are otherwise  by 
[CONTACT_470164].  
2) Pregnant or planning conception. As female participants are incarcerated & active in the 
jail opi[INVESTIGATOR_470112], a 
pregnancy test is not required by [CONTACT_5984]. A urine dipstick pregna ncy (hCG) test will  
be administered  at week [ADDRESS_602507] detects  human  chorionic  gonadotropin  (hCG)  in 
urine  with a sensitivity/specificity of: 25 mIU hCG/ml, >99%. Time to result is four minutes. If  
negative,  a urine  pregnancy  test will be administ ered at the final week 8 visit 5  and final week 
20 visit 8 (if applicable) to ensure  that a participant  is not  pregnant.  
3) No severe  or acute  medical  or psychiatric  disability  preventing  safe study  participation  or 
making follow -up unlikely.  
Federal Research among Prisoners . Study participants are clearly considered prisoners  at 
the time of enrollment.  The NYU SOM IRB will contact [CONTACT_470165]/OHRP to address this  topic  
and for permission to enroll prisoners in a federally funded research trial. However,  we 
believe this study carefully conforms to the Federal guidelines for research among  prisoners  
(CFR 46.306) in the following  manner:  
Study Numbe r s18 -[ZIP_CODE]  December 11 , 2019 Version 10 
18  
 1.) Research on practices, both innovative and accepted, which have the intent  and 
reasonable  probability  of improving  the health  or well-being  of the subject.  In cases  in which  
those studies require the assignment of prisoners in a manner consistent with  protocols  
approved by [CONTACT_470166], the  study 
may procee d only after the Secretary has consulted with appropriate experts,  including  
experts in penology medicine and ethics, and published notice, in the Federal Register,  of 
his intent to approve such  research.  
2) Any possible  advantages  accruing  to the prisoner  through  his or her participation  in the 
research, when compared to the general living conditions, medical care, quality of  food,  
amenities  and opportunity  for earnings  in the prison,  are not of such  a magnitude  that his or 
her ability  to weigh  the risks of the research  against  the value  of such  advantages  in the 
limited choice environment of the prison is impaired. Incentives and benefits  from 
participation  are not coercive  and are fair value  of participant's  time and, following  release, 
travel.  
(3) The risks involved in the research are commensurate with risks that would be  accepted  
by [CONTACT_105] -prisoner volunteers. This study's methods and interventions are consistent with  good  
clinical practices in community  settings.  
(4) Procedures for the selection of subjects within the prison are fair to all prisoners  and 
immune  from arbitrary  intervention  by [CONTACT_470167].  Unless  the principal  
investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_470113],  
control subjects must be selected randomly from the group of available prisoners who  meet 
the characteristics  needed  for that particular  research  project.  Jail authorities  have  no role in 
this study or in treatment assignment, which is  random.  
(5) The information is presented in language which is understandable to the  subject 
population.  The informed  consent  and consent  quiz are intended  to be understandable  to 
adults in  jail. 
(6) Adequate assurance exists that parole boards will not take into account a  prisoner's  
participation in the research in making decisions regarding parole, and each prisoner  is 
clearly  informed  in advance  that participation  in the research  will have  no effect  on his or her 
parole; There is no role for, relationship, or ot her interaction with parole or  probation  
authorities and this  study.  
(7) Where the Board finds there may be a need for follow -up examination or care  of 
participants  after the end of their participation,  adequate  provision  has been  made  for such 
examination or care, taking into account the varying lengths of individual  prisoners'  
sentences, and for informing participants of this fact. The study primarily consists  of 
community follow -up of adults released from NYC jails. Follow -up  consists of  research 
visits conducted weekly then bi -weekly for both medication arms post -release (week [ADDRESS_602508]- 
release, week 2, week 4, week 6, week  8). After the completion of Visit 5 Week 8, all 
participants will be eligible for a 24 week therapeutic extension study wh erein they are 
offered initial and/or additional XRB injections. These will occur monthly post study week 8: 
week 12, week 16, week 20, week 24, and week 28. A final safety  visit, no medication 
administered, will be conducted at week [ADDRESS_602509]/New  Drug  
Monthly, injectable, buprenorphine extended -release (XRB, SublocadeTM, Indivior) is  the 
most  recently  FDA approved  pharmacotherapy  for opi[INVESTIGATOR_470114] U.S.(2).  XRB 
is available as of March -2018 in a pre -mixed subcutaneous formulation,  administered  
monthly, and equivalent to a 16 -24mg/day maintenance dose of sublingual  buprenorphine - 
naloxone (SLB). Sublingu al buprenorphine was approved by [CONTACT_34033] 2002 and  is 
delivered  daily by [CONTACT_470168] 5 to 10 minutes  and letting  it 
dissolve  completely.  
6.1.2  Dosage, Admin,  Schedule  
Buprenorphine Extended Release: XRB is a 300mg or 100mg pre -mixed subcutaneous  
injectable  formulation to be administered monthly. XRB is for abdominal subcutaneous 
injection  only.  Participants  in the XRB treatment  arm will be given  [ADDRESS_602510]-release,  depending  
on their release  date.  
Sublingual Buprenorphine: SLB (SUBOXONE, Zubsolv, or generic tablets) is a  daily 
sublingual film or tablet ranging from 8-24mg/day or equivalent (Zubsolv is dosed  5.7-17.1 
mg/day). The film or tablet is placed under the tongue for 5 to 10 minutes until  dissolved  
completely. Participants in the SLB treatment arm will be provided SLB daily by  [CONTACT_470169] -jail (controll ed substances are not self -administered in -jail) and encouraged  to 
continue SLB treatment in weekly, bi -weekly, or monthly quantities for unobserved,  daily,  
self-administration through week 5. Patients may obtain SLB care free -of-charge from  the 
Bellevue  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_470115]-NYU/Bellevue  providers  and 
pharmacies per usual care  standards. After the completion of Visit 5 Week 8, SLB 
participants will be offered XRB treatment in the 20 week therapeutic extension. If 
interested,  participants would receive one or more XRB injections during the period of 
Weeks 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28 followed by a final safety documentation visit at Week 32.  
6.1.3  Method of  Assignment/Randomization  
Screening and  Randomization  
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_470116] -of-care NYC jail opi[INVESTIGATOR_63569],  led 
by [CONTACT_252167], Jonathan Giftos, MD. Potential participants currently maintained  on 
sublingual buprenorphine (currently a NYC jail standard of care) will be offered  study 
information and encouraged to enroll. Interested participants will be referred by [CONTACT_470170][INVESTIGATOR_470117] a comprehensive screening visit. Cons ented and  eligible  
participants will be randomized by [CONTACT_470171] a web -based randomizer 1:1 to the  2 
study cells: XRB and  SLB.  
6.1.4  Blinding and Procedures for  Unblinding  
This is an 8 -week, open -label, single site, proof -of-concept randomized controlled  trial. 
There  is no blinding  of treatment  assignment  or of outcomes  assessments.

 6.1.5  Packaging/Labeling  
Buprenorphine Extended Release (SUBLOCADE): XRB is available in dosage strengths  of 
100 mg/0.5  mL and 300 mg/1.5  mL buprenorphine.  Each  dose  is provided  in a prefilled  
syringe with a 19 gauge 5/[ADDRESS_602511] -release.  Each dose is 
supplied in an individual kit and will be acquired  in bulk shipments from the supplier  Indivior.  
At the outset of this study and original IRB approval, it was proposed that each participant 
randomized to the XRB (SUBLOCADE) treatment arm would receive up to two injections of 
XRB, each 300mg according to the medication package insert. However, the stud y has 
since been modified to include a therapeutic treatment extension of [ADDRESS_602512] Visit 5 Week 8 in which initial and/or additional XRB injections would be offered to all 
interested participants (see section 5.1.1). With this therapeutic e xtension, eligible & 
interested participants could receive 4+ XRB injections in the community. With this in mind, 
the study must expand the planned XRB dosage to include the 100mg formulation of XRB. 
As the XRB package insert states, the recommended dose o f XRB following induction is 
300mg monthly for the first two months followed by a maintenance dose of 100mg or 
300mg monthly. The study must have the capability to offer eligible participants receiving a 
third XRB injection the lower, recommended maintenan ce dose of 100mg in addition to the 
standard 300mg.  
Sublingual Buprenorphine (SUBOXONE, Zubsolv, or generic tablets): SLB is  administered  
sublingually or buccally as a single daily dose. Medication should be prescribed  in 
consideration of the frequency of  visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised in  early  
treatment or without appropriate follow -up visits. After treatment induction and  stabilization, 
the maintenance  dose  of SLB is generally  in the range  of 4mg/1mg  buprenorphine/naloxone  
to 24mg/6 mg buprenorphine/naloxone per day depending on the individual patient  and 
clinical response, as determined by [CONTACT_15370]. Daily doses will vary by [CONTACT_29569].  The 
recommended target dose of SLB during maintenance is  16mg/4mg  
buprenorphine/naloxone. SLB will be prescribed and provided via observed dosing  in-jail 
(controlled substances are not self -administered in -jail) per usual care protocols.  Post- 
release, all participants may elect to continue SLB maintenance with the Bellevue  Primary  
Care Addiction Medicine clinic, or may pursue SLB maintenance from  non-NYU/Bellevue  
community providers. SLB is available free of charge to uninsured patients at  Bellevue  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54246], or participants may fill SLB prescriptions at community pharmacies.  SLB 
medication will not be provided by [CONTACT_470172]. Self -report, BHC EMR records, and  NYS 
Prescription Monitoring Plan audits will document SLB post -release community  treatment  
retention, daily dose, and refill  frequencies.  
6.1.6  Storage Conditions  
XRB Storage C onditions: Store refrigerated at 2 - 8ºC (35.6 - 46.4ºF). Once outside  the 
refrigerator XRB may be stored in its original package at room temperature 15 -30ºC (59  - 
86ºF), for up to 7 days prior to  administration.  
SLB Storage  Conditions:  Store  at room  temperature  between  20 - 25ºC  (68 - 77ºF).  
6.1.7  Concomitant  therapy  
Study Numbe r s18 -[ZIP_CODE]  December 11 , 2019 Version 10 
21  
 It is advisable for both XRB and SLB treatment arms that patients refrain from use  of 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651],  sedatives,  tranquilizers,  antidepressants,  stimulants,  or alcohol.  Urine  
toxicology will be collected at medication dispensation visits in order to ensure  no 
contraindications.  
6.1.8  Restrictions  
XRB Restrictions: For abdominal subcutaneous injection only. Do not administer  XRB 
intravenously  or intramuscularly.  Only a healthcare  provider should  prepare  and administer  
XRB. Administer monthly with a minimum of 26 days between  doses.  
SLB Restrictions:  Take  the prescribed  dose  once  a day. SLB must  be taken  whole.  Do not 
cut, chew, or swallow. SLB film should not be moved after placement. Proper  administering  
technique  should  be demonstrated  to the patient  by a healthcare  provider.

6.2 Assessments  
Measures and  Assessments:  
a) Baseline assessments include a drug and alcohol use history (ASI -Lite), a  pre-arrest   
recall of drug and alcohol use (Timeline Followback), a medication treatment for opi[INVESTIGATOR_470118]/preference form (MOUD preference), demographic information, and  jail 
Electronic  Medical  Record  medical  and psychiatric  history  and laboratory  data,  including  HIV 
and HCV status.  
b) In-jail feasibility assessments of XRB vs. SLB include logging the % eligible enrolling  in 
the study; the density of medical/nursing/pharmacy visits per arm and per participant;  the 
incidence  rates  of medication  diversion;  open -ended  interviews  with participants  surrounding 
XRB vs. SLB and ease -of-use and  satisfaction;  
a) Post-release follow -up assessments include administrative data for SLB medication  refills 
and post -release XRB injections, self -reported  opi[INVESTIGATOR_74480]  (Timeline 
Followback), urine toxicology testing, pregnancy testing, treatment retention (treatment 
retention form),  Adverse  Event and Serious Adverse Event monitoring (SAFTEE), and NYS 
Prescription  Monitoring Data for community S LB pharmacy refill  reporting. The I -STOP/PMP 
(prescription monitoring program) registries will be accessed in order to track participant 
data related to respective treatments. Additional qualitative interviews will be conducted with 
eligible XRB participan ts to further examine opi[INVESTIGATOR_470119] -
release buprenorphine, in -jail and within the community . 
6.2.1  Efficacy  
The primary  outcome  of in-jail feasibility  and acceptability  will be measured  by [CONTACT_470163], the mean medical/medication visits per arm  and 
per participant,  the incidence  rates  of medication  diversion,  and open -ended  interviews  with 
patients regarding treatment satisfaction and ease of  use. 
Secondary Aims 1 -3 will be measured utilizing the following assessments:  baseline  
demographics, baseline ASI -Lite, baseline MOUD exposure/preference,  Timeline 
Followback, urine  toxicology  results, treatment retention, and NYS Prescription Monitoring 
Data. XRNTX, ETAU,  and Methadone outcomes will be taken from the SOMATICS -XOR 
U01 parent  study.  
6.2.2  Safety/Pregnancy -related  policy  
XRB and SLB are both FDA approved, safe, efficacious medications for the treatment  of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427]. As with most medications both XRB and SLB carry side effects  as 
detailed  above.  Participants  will be monitored  throughout  this pi[INVESTIGATOR_470120],  
all adverse  events  and/or  serious  adverse  events  will be documented  and medication  will be 
discontinued if necessary. Women who are pregnant  or plan to become pregnant will  be 
excluded from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_20635].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events Definition and  Reporting  
For the purposes of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], proof -of-concept, RCT, an adverse event (AE) is  any 
symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity during the  course 
of the study.  Intercurrent  illnesses  or injuries  should  be regarded  as adverse  events.  
Study Numbe r s18 -[ZIP_CODE]  December 11 , 2019 Version 10  
21   
 
Abnormal  results  of diagnostic  procedures  are considered  to be adverse  events  if the 
abnormality:  
• results in study  withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse  event  
• is associated with clinical signs or  symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic  tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_1372] (i.e. medication  side 
effects)  
All adverse  events  will be documented  in the attached  clinical  research  form and reported  to 
the IRB where  necessary.  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE that  is: 
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41836] 
• results in persistent or significant disability or  incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth  defect  
• an important medical  event  
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but  are 
clearly of major c linical significance. They may jeopardize the subject, and may  require 
intervention  to prevent  one of the other  serious  outcomes  noted  above.  For example,  drug 
overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or  intensive  
treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would typi[INVESTIGATOR_470121].  
All serious adverse events will be documented in the attached clinical research form  and 
reported to the IRB where  necessary.  
Classification  of an Adverse  Event:  for AEs in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_470122].  
• Mild — Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with  the 
participant's daily  activities.  
• Moderate — Events result in a low level of inconvenience or co ncern with  the 
therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference  with 
functioning.  
• Severe — Events interrupt a participant's usual daily activity and may  require 
systemic  drug therapy  or other  treatment.  Severe  events  are usually  potentially  life- 
threatening or incapacitating.  
Study Numbe r s18 -[ZIP_CODE]  December 11 , 2019 Version 10  
22   
 
Relationship  to Study  Medication:  To assess  whether  an AE may be associated  with the 
study medication (XRB vs. SLB) the following guidelines will be  used:  
 
 
• Definitely Related — There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship,  and 
other possible contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including  an 
abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to  drug 
administration and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_470173]. The response to withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) should be  clinically 
plausible. The event must be pharmacologically or phenom enologically  definitive,  
with use of a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if  necessary  
• Probably Related — There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and  the 
influence of other factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an  abnormal  
laboratory test result, occurs within a reasonable time after administration of  the 
drug, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or  chemicals, 
and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal  (dechallenge). 
Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this  definition.  
• Possibly Related — There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship  (e.g., 
the event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the  trial 
medication). However, other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g.,  the 
participant's clinical condition, other concomitant events). Although an AE may  rate 
only as "possibly related" soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring  more 
information and later be upgraded  to "probably related" or "definitely related,"  as 
appropriate.  
• Unlikely  to be related  — A clinical  event,  including  an abnormal  laboratory  test result, 
whose temporal relationship to drug administration makes a causal  relationship 
improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time  after  
administration of the trial medication) and in which other drugs or chemicals  or 
underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the participant's  clinical 
condition, other concomitant  treatment s). 
• Not Related — The AE is completely independent of study drug  administration,  
and/or  evidence  exists  that the event  is definitely  related  to another  etiology.  There  
must be an alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_271896].  
Study clinician s will be responsible for determining whether an AE is expected  or 
unexpected.  An AE will be considered  unexpected  if the nature,  severity,  or frequency  of the 
event  is not consistent  with the risk information  previously  described  for the study  agent.  
The pi[INVESTIGATOR_470123] 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after  the 
last day of study participation. At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about  the 
occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit. Events will be followed for outcome  information  
until resolution or  stabilization.

6.3 Study  Procedures  
The study procedures are detailed  below.  
6.3.1  Study  Schedule  
The total number of expected visits per participant is 6 visits. All participants will be given 
the option to participate in a 24 week therapeutic extension study of XRB treatment 
following  completion of Visit 5 Week 8. If a participant elects to continue and/or initiate XRB 
treatment, there will be 12 total visits per participant. The average time needed  to complete 
each visit will be approximately one hour. The initial week 0 screening  and randomization 
visit will be conducted in a Rikers Island jail facility in the Opi[INVESTIGATOR_470124]. Once 
consented, enrolled, and randomized, buprenorphine  extended -release  (XRB) or sublingual 
buprenorphine (SLB) daily maintenance will provided per us ual Opi[INVESTIGATOR_470125] -jail and prior to release. The timing between  randomization and release will 
vary. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_470126] [ADDRESS_602513] -
release, all study visi ts will be conducted at Bellevue Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54246]'s  (BHC) Addiction 
Medicine clinic. Medical and research visits will be conducted weekly and then  bi- weekly for 
both medication arms post -release (week [ADDRESS_602514] -release, week 2, week 4,  week  6, week 8). 
The me dication schedule for both arms is as  follows:  
Buprenorphine Extended -Release: Participants randomized to this arm will receive at   least  
two doses of XRB. The first will be administered at study week [ADDRESS_602515] one  week  
prior to release. Particip ants incarcerated for greater than 4 weeks following  randomization 
will receive 2+ XRB doses prior to release. Post -release, XRB injections will  be administered  
at study  week  1-16 in the BHC  Addiction  Medicine  clinic  depending  on the timing of the 
previous pre -release/community  injections.  
Sublingual Buprenorphine: Participants randomized to this arm will be provided SLB  daily 
maintenance per usual Opi[INVESTIGATOR_470127] -jail. Post -release, SLB  arm 
participants wil l receive follow -up care at Bellevue Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s Addiction Medicine or at  non- 
BHC/NYU community providers, per their preference. We expect and will encourage  most 
participants to follow -up at Bellevue, though this is not mandated. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_470128] 's 
supply of SLB is prescribed within one week of release. At visit 2, week 2, SLB  participants  
typi[INVESTIGATOR_470129] a two week's supply of daily maintenance SLB. SLB participants will  continue 
to receive 2 -4 week refill prescriptions for SLB from visit 2, wee k 2 through visit 6, week  8. 
Regardless  of SLB prescribing  patterns,  they are encouraged  to attend  study  follow -up visits 
at BHC per the same study schedule (Weeks  1,2,4,6,8). After the completion of Visit [ADDRESS_602516]/Procedures  Screening/

6.3.2  Informed Consent  
Potential participants interested in buprenorphine maintenance (currently a NYC  jail 
standard  of care)  will be offered  study  information  and encouraged  to enroll.  The study  
team  will receive  IRB-approval  for all study  documents,  informational  handouts,  informed  
cons ent forms, informed consent quizzes, and all CRFs prior to screening and  
randomizing participants.  Consent  forms  describing  in detail  the study  agent,  study  
procedures,  and risks are  given  to the participant  and written  documentation  of informed  
consent  is required  prior to starting  intervention/administering  study  product.  Written  
informed  consent  including  a consent quiz adapted from the parent grant protocol will be 
used to document  informed  consent. Participants will have the opportunity to ca refully 
review the written consent  form and ask questions prior to signing. The participants may 
withdraw consent at any  time throughout the course of the trial. A copy of the signed 
informed consent document will  be given  to the participants  for their records.  The rights  
and welfare  of the participants  will be protected  by [CONTACT_470175].  
A copy of the signed informed consent doc ument will be stored in the subject's  research 
record.  The consent  process,  including  the name  [CONTACT_470183],  will be 
thoroughly documented in the subject's research record. Any alteration to the  standard 
consent process (e.g. use of a translator, consent from a legally authorized  representative, 
consent  document  presented  orally,  etc.) and the justification  for such  alteration  will likewise  
be documented.  
6.3.[ADDRESS_602518] udy procedures,  
buprenorphine (XRB and SLB) treatment, and follow -up protocols. A pre -screen  checklist 
will evaluate eligibility. All adult jail inmates with an upcoming release date, current  opi[INVESTIGATOR_470130], and currently maintained on subli ngual buprenorphine -naloxone  will 
be potential participants. If interested and eligible, participants will complete the  informed  
consent process (ICF and ICF quiz). Once informed consent is obtained,  baseline  
assessments  will be administered  prior to randomization.  The baseline  assessments  include  
a drug and alcohol use history (ASI -Lite), demographics, a pre -arrest recall of drug  and 
alcohol use (Timeline Followback), prior medication treatment for opi[INVESTIGATOR_470131] (MOUD Pr eference form), and jail Electronic Medical Record 
medical  and psychiatric  history  and laboratory  data,  including  HIV and HCV  status.  
6.3.4  Recruitment, Enrollment and  Retention  
Recruitment:  Adult  inmates  with known  Department  of Corrections  release  dates  and recent 
or on-going  opi[INVESTIGATOR_470132],  both on Rikers  Island;  the 
Eric M. Taylor Center (male) and the Rose M Singer Center (female). Approximately  [ADDRESS_602519]  this facility  with an opi[INVESTIGATOR_470133] (e.g. buprenorphine, methadone, naltrexone, or counseling). NYULMC study  staff

(currently a NYC jail sta ndard of care) will be offered study information and encouraged  to 
enroll. As current daily maintenance of sublingual buprenorphine is required in order to  be 
eligible  for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268],  participants  will be already  be affiliate  with the in-jail Opi[INVESTIGATOR_470137] a  comprehensive 
screening visit. Monetary compensation for time and travel are intended to facilitate  and 
encourage follow -up visit attendance; transportation services for follow -up visits  are 
otherwise not  provided.   
 
Informed Consent and Enrollment/Randomization: Study staff will obtain informed  consent 
via the completion of the in formed consent form and informed consent quiz. Consented  and 
eligible participants will be randomized by [CONTACT_470171] a web -based randomizer  1:1, 
XRB vs. SLB. Medications will be dispensed at the screening/randomization visit in -jail (visit 
1, week 0) for both arms. All follow -up visits (visit 1 -6) will take place at Bellevue  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_470138]'s  Addiction  Medicine  clinic  and medication  (XRB)  will be provided  free-of-charge.

6.3.6  End of Study and  Follow -up 
After completion of the final visit (Visit 5, Week 8), study participation is complete for all 
participants who do not elect to continue and/or initiate treatment in the [ADDRESS_602522]  the option  of accessing  services  at 
Bellevue,  including  buprenorphine  and methadone maintenance treatment. It is likely that 
the majority of participants in  both arms will conti nue on SLB maintenance with the BHC 
Addiction Medicine clinic. XRB  may become a usual care option at BHC during the course 
of this trial, depending on  NYS Medicaid policies and H+H formulary  updates.  
For participants who continue in the 24 week therapeutic  extension, after completion of the 
final safety visit (Visit 11, Week 32), study participation is complete. All participants will be 
provided the same information as highlighted above. It is likely that the majority of 
participants in  this arm will continue on SLB maintenance with the BHC Addiction Medicine 
clinic.  
In-jail feasibility will be assessed during and post study completion as the data is  made 
available.  All adverse  event  and serious  adverse  event  monitoring  (SAFTEE)  will take place  
through out the study  and will be documented/reported  as necessary.  
6.3.[ADDRESS_602523] is entirely  voluntary  and participants  are free 
to withdraw at any time. In the event of early study termination, study staff will complete  the 
study termination form, modeled from a CRF of the parent XOR study. Any  participant  
withdrawing from the study prior to full study completion, regardless of study group, stands  a 
risk of relapsing to illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_74504]/alc ohol misuse. The study will assist  with 
treatment referrals for detox services at Bellevue Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54246], but will not  otherwise  
directly provide such services or medications. Otherwise any XRB or SLB patient who  has 
relapsed and is not interested in con tinuing their baseline study condition (i.e., an  XRB 
participant does not wish to continue injections due to side effects or for any other  reason) 
will be encouraged to pursue other appropriate community treatment, the menu of  which  
includes the robust add iction service offerings at Bellevue Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54246] (BHC).  BHC's  
services are available to all persons, regardless of insurance status or an ability to pay,  and 
include emergency detox inpatient services, methadone treatment,  office -based  
buprenorphine, a nd intensive outpatient and dual diagnosis programs. These services  will 
consist of usual care occurring outside of the study and will not be directly provided by  [CONTACT_470177].  
6.4.[ADDRESS_602524] (A>>B) of XRB vs.  SLB 
surround ing Aim 2, retention in treatment post -release. Current rates of successful  retention 
in community buprenorphine treatment immediately at one month post -release are 30%  or 
lower (6). This current administrative data reflects closely results seen in an orig inal BUP  vs. 
methadone NYC jail RCT conducted in 2006 -2008 (7). If XRB retention at one month  post- 
release (Week 4) is 70% or greater, the study would be powered to detect a  significant 
difference  between  arms.  Analysis  of treatment  retention  among  XRB vs. SLB will consist  of 
simple 2x2 tables for counts and proportions of weeks retained in treatment by [INVESTIGATOR_216]. We  are 
unlikely to extensively model and control for confounders or interaction  terms.  
6.4.2  Sample Size Considerations  
A total sample size of N=[ADDRESS_602525]-release  
(71% vs. 30% success favoring XRB; two -sided alpha of 0.05; 80+% power). The  proposed  
sample  size will not provide  a definitive  test of intervention  efficacy,  but is sized  for feasibility  
testing.  
6.4.3  Handling of Missing  Data  
Follow -up among individual participants at Bellevue Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_470140]'s  
monetary incentives and tracking protocols. Partic ipants in either arm  choosing 
buprenorphine  f/u at Bellevue  will be particularly  likely  to complete  follow -up. Administrative  
and program data covering community pharmacy fills of buprenorphine products  and 
community provider reporting will be used to supplement treatment retention outcomes  (Aim 
2). Missing opi[INVESTIGATOR_470141].

7 - Trial  Administration  
7.1 Ethical Considerations  
Federal Research among Prisoners . See section  5.3.2.  
Emotional Discomfo rt: There is a small chance that participants may become upset  when  
discussing their history of addiction problems, criminal justice involvement, family  conflict, 
prior trauma, or role failure, etc. We will discontinue administration of research  instrument s 
if a subject shows great discomfort or asks to terminate an interview. Such events have  not 
been observed in our preliminary  studies.  
7.[ADDRESS_602526] (IRB)  Review  
The protocol, informed consent form(s), recruitment materials, and all participant  materials 
will be submitted to the appropriate IRB and institutional research committees for review  and 
approval. Approval of both the protocol and the consent form must be obtained before  any 
participant is enrolled. Any amendment to the proto col will require review and approval  by 
[CONTACT_3484]. All changes to the consent  form 
will be IRB approved; a determination will be made regarding whether previously  consented 
participants need to be  re-consented.  
7.[ADDRESS_602527] Confidentiality  
Participants  will be asked  to provide  information  regarding  a number  of sensitive  behaviors  
(e.g.,  alcohol  and drug use, sexual  history,  criminal  history  and on-going  illicit activities).  
This type of personal  information  divulged  by [CONTACT_470178].  Therefore, in  addition  
to the safeguards put in place for the collection and storage of all data as described  above  
(section 11.0 Data Collection and Management), the study team obtained a  Federal  
Certificate  of Confidentiality  (COC  #DA-13-154) to encompass  protocol  activity  and further  
safeguard the possible risk of released confidential information. We will provide all  staff with 
training in their responsibilities for maintaining subject confidentiality; we will use  unique  
identifiers  to identify  subjects  in the database;  all data will be kept in locked  filing cabinets  or 
on our secure server to which only the investigators and project manager will have  access  
to. Study findings will utilize only aggregate data and no publication or presentation  will 
involve any use of individual  information.  
[LOCATION_001] City's  H+HC's  Human  Subject's  Research  Protections  Programs  Policies  and 
Procedures procedure #26.3  states:  
If a patient is taking part in a Research Project involving a drug, device, or  procedure  
(therapeutic  trial),  the patient's  participation  must  be clearly  noted  in the patient's  electronic  
medical record. Researchers should scan and upload Informed Consent forms into  the 
electronic  medical  record  when  and where  possible,  preferably  to a research  folder.  
Research Records related to an FDA application must be maintained in accordance  with 
FDA requirem ents.

Therefore, if you are randomized to XRB: Information about your participation in this  study 
will be entered into your Electronic Medical Record (EMR). Once placed in your EMR,  the 
information will be available to all of your providers who participate in the EMR system  at 
NYC Health + Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_470142] (HIM).  The 
purpose  of this entry  is to provide  research  information  that has the potential  to negatively  
impact your medical care. Bell evue HIM will scan and upload your informed consent to  your 
EMR, and are bound by [CONTACT_470179].  
7.4 Deviations/Unanticipated  Problems  
Protocol  Deviations:  A protocol  deviation  is any noncompliance  with the clinical  trial protocol,  
GCP, or Manual of Procedures (MOP) requirements. The noncompliance may be either  on 
the part of the participant, the investigator, or the study site staff. As a result of  deviations,  
corrective  actions  are to be developed  by [CONTACT_58717].  
These practices are consistent with ICH  E6: 
• 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and  4.5.3  
• 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, section  5.1.1  
• 5.20 Noncompliance, sections 5.20.1, and  5.20.2.  
It is the responsibility of the site PI/study staff to use continuous vigilance to identify  and 
report  deviations  within  [ADDRESS_602528]  be reported  to the local IRB per their guidelines.  The site PI/study  
staff is responsible for knowing and adhering to their IRB requirements. Further  details  
about  the handling  of protocol  deviations  will be included  in the MOP.  
Unanticipated  Problems:  Incidents  or events  that meet  the OHRP  criteria  for UPs require  the 
creation and completion of an UP report form. It is the site investigator's responsibility  to 
report UPs to their IRB and to the DCC/study sponsor. The UP report will include  the 
following  information:  
• Protocol  identifying  information:  protocol  title and number,  PI's name,  and the IRB 
project  number;  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or  outcome;  
• An explanation  of the basis  for determining  that the event,  incident,  experience,  or 
outcome represents an  UP; 
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that  have  
been taken or are proposed in response to the  UP. 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt report ing, UPs will be reported using the  following  
timeline:  
UPs that are SAEs will be reported to the IRB and to the DCC/study sponsor within 30  days  
of the investigator  becoming  aware  of the event.  Any other  UP will be reported  to the IRB 
Study Numbe r s18 -[ZIP_CODE]  December 11 , 2019 Version 10  
34   
 
and to the DCC/study sponsor within 30 days of the investigator becoming aware of  the 
problem.  All UPs should  be reported  to appropriate  institutional  officials  (as required  by [CONTACT_8706]'s written reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or designee),  and 
OHRP  within  30 days  of the IR's receipt  of the report  of the problem  from the investigator.  
7.5 Data Quality Assurance  
Study clinicians and research staff will undergo t he same baseline training at the  inception  
of the study. The Program/Project Manager and Data Management staff will ensure  the 
quality of the clinicians' and the research assistants' administration of study  assessments  
and instruments  and of integrity  of the data recorded  through  regular  reviews  and on-going  
data monitoring.  
7.5.1  Data  Collection  
Electronic case report forms (CRFs) will be used to manage the data for this study, and  the 
Project Manager will work with study personnel to ensure the completeness and integrity  of 
all study data. These electronic CRFs will be taken from the parent XOR U01 NIDA  study. 
All data will be checked in real time, stored in a centralized database, reviewed  and 
monitored for completeness and accuracy, and undergo  a final cleaning following the  last 
subject visit, following which the study database will be locked. REDCap will be the  data 
entry and database platform for this  study.  
Protected Health Information (PHI) will be collected and stored in the form of  each  
participant's original signed informed consent and locator form.  These written  documents  
will be filed as individual  charts  and locked  securely  in a private  Department  of Population  
Health  office  cabinet.  These  charts  will be accessed  to call and follow -up with patients  post- 
release and to maintain the ICF on file. Participants will be assigned sequentially  numbered  
unique study ID numbers at the time of consent (e.g. #001 -50). These ID numbers will  be 
the only identifier entered on Case Report Fo rms (CRF) and research assessments  to 
distinguish one participant from another. Secure laptops will be used for web -based  data 
entry, CRF variables will be input into a secure central database on an NYULMC  server.  
The laptops  themselves  will be password -protected,  but will not store  PHI, study  ID number  
information or any research assessment data and will be used for web -based data  entry  
only. To maintain a link between the study ID and PHI for purposes of follow -up and  record - 
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], individual participant charts and research assessment/CRF data there will be  a 
master participant ID key that will contain each participant's PHI (name, DOB) and  their 
corresponding unique study ID number. This master key identifier file (.xls) will  be 
maintained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_470143] a secure NYULMC desktop file  and 
accessible only to study  staff.  
At the end of a three -year period following study closure, written identifiable data will  be 
destroyed.  De-identified  study  data will remain  in digital  and written file storage  for a period  
of [ADDRESS_602529] NYU IRB  guidelines.  
The final de -identifiable digital dataset may be used by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_470144]- 
Investigator  for secondary  analysis,  in which  case  future  IRB-approval  would  be sought.

report on the trial's status, followed by a closed session under the direction of the  DSMB  
chairperson, during which time the investigators and research team may be present.  This  
will be followed by [CONTACT_74591]. Issues related  to 
subject safety, conflict of interest, confidentiality, and ongoing study review (including  AEs,  
SAEs, and regulatory issues) will be assessed. Following each DSM Board  meeting, 
recommendations will be made to [CONTACT_6321], and a final  report (edited by [CONTACT_224600]) 
will be prepared for reporting to NIDA, the DOHMH and NYU IRBs. The Data  Safety  
Monitoring Plan (DSMP) includes stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_470145]. 
In general, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_470146]: 1) there is  clear 
evidence of harm or harmful side -effects of the treatment; 2) there is not likelihood  of 
demonstrating treatment benefit; 3 ) there is overwhelming evidence of the benefit of  the 
treatment. However because we are comparing alternative paradigms involving a  study 
medication (XRB) or community treatment as usual (SLB) that are already FDA -approved  as

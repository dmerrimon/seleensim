Non-substantial Modification(s)
Amendment 8 15 June 2023 The driver for B7931028 Protocol Amendment 8
is to modify the key secondary endpoint of ‘time 
to first severe SLE flare’  
 
‘ Time to first severe SLE flare’ will remain 
as a secondary endpoint, just not the ‘key’ secondary endpoint and the data will besummarized as a secondary endpoint.   The estimands for the associated endpoints have been updated to reflect these changes.  E2, has beenupdated to align with the revised ‘Key’ secondary endpoint of ‘BICLA response at Week 52’ as was E7, the estimand for 'time to first severe SLE flare’.  
Section 1.[ADDRESS_1134639] the change of key secondary endpoint to ‘BICLA response at Week 52’. These changes have also been made throughout the OBJECTIVES, ESTIMANDS AND ENDPOINTS table in Section 3.  Language has been added to Section 4.[ADDRESS_1134640] severe flare with BICLA response at Week 52 in the statistical hierarchy.  The estimand for BICLA response at Week 52 is now described in Section [IP_ADDRESS], in place of the estimand which had previously described the analysis of time to first severe flare; the analysis of this endpoint will be performed in a manner which is entirely consistent with the primary analysis of the primary endpoint, SRI-4 response at Week 52.  Subsequently, the 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )CCI
PF-[ADDRESS_1134641] severe flare is 
now described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].
Rationale: The assumptions about thesevere SLE flare rate in this study population have not been observed and thus the time to first severe flare endpoint would be substantially underpowered.
Section 6.3.1 Allocation of Study Intervention has been updated to remove the following sentence, “Allocation to Study Intervention, In the event of aQuality Assurance audit, the auditor(s) will beallowed access to unblinded study intervention records at the site(s) to verify that randomization/dispensing has been done accurately”.  
Rationale: This sentence was removed because the study was not set-up to allow study sites to have unblinded study intervention records.  Therefore, the auditor would not have the ability to verify the accuracy of randomization and dispensing of study intervention as proposed in this sentence.
Additionally, changes have been made throughout to ensure consistency of the protocol with the SAP.  Typographical changes, and changes for grammar, have been made as they have been identified throughout the protocol and will not be summarized here.
Rationale: Additional clarity regarding planned sensitivity analyses is provided.
Section 9.1.2 Hypotheses and Decision Rules,Language has been added to indicate that any 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Document Version Date Summary of Changes and Rationale
future changes to the family-wise error control 
procedure would be detailed in the SAP.
Rationale: This language is used to indicate how any additional changes to the statistical hierarchy will be addressed.
Section 9.2 Sample Size Determination has been updated with power calculations for both the primary endpoint, SRI-4 response at Week 52, and the key secondary endpoint, BICLA response at Week 52 in a manner which is now consistent with the planned primary analyses of these endpoints.  
Rationale: Previously, the power calculations conducted and described in this section incorporated a 25% dropout rate even though these participants are counted as non-responders by [CONTACT_819350].  The calculations are now consistent with the estimand. This section is also updated to reflect the change in the key secondary endpoint.
Amendment 7 06 June 2022 The overall rationale for B7931028 Protocol 
Amendment 7 is to decrease the sample size for the study from 448 participants to 350 participants, and to allow eligibility of participants with latent TB (positive quantiferon gold tests) who agree to receiving treatment with INH and Vitamin B6.This amendment also includes the administrative changes made in Protocol Amendment 5 (requested during the EU Voluntary Harmonization Procedure (VHP) review of Amendment 4, countries submitting their initial clinical trial application with Amendment 5 (Italy and Argentina), and to any country requiring new protocol amendments to be submitted (Taiwan); and Protocol Amendment 6 (China only amendment) to be globally implemented. Furthermore, this change will allow specific safety 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )
PF-[ADDRESS_1134642] to allow 
participants with latent TB (not active TB) to be eligible for the study provided the protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria can be met.  
Section 1.1 Synopsis, Section 3.0 Objectives, 
estimands and ENDPOINTS and Section 9.5 Interim Analysis –The Interim Analysis was updated to now read, “An Interim analysis may be conducted when sufficient number of participants completes Week 52 visits and before the interim analysis is instigated, the details of the objectives, decision criteria, dissemination plan and method of maintaining the study blind per [COMPANY_007]’s SOPs will be documented and approved in the E-DMC charter. In addition, the analysis details must be documented and approved in an interim analysis plan (IAP).”
Rationale: Since the sample size was modified from 448 to 350, there are already more than 50% subjects of the subjects that have completed Week 24 therefore, including a ‘sufficient amount of participants’ allows for the participants that meet the interimanalysis requirements to all be included. In addition, the timepoint was updated from Week [ADDRESS_1134643] dataset.
Section 1.1 Synopsis, Section 9.2 Sample Size Calculation - The Sample size has been modifiedfrom approximately 448 to approximately 350.
Rationale: reduction of sample size to [ADDRESS_1134644] 80% power for the primary endpoint and will allow more timely completion of this study.
Section 1.3, Schedule of Activities, Section [IP_ADDRESS] Chest X-ray was added to the Week 56 visit, for subjects entering the study with latent TB. If a 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )
PF-[ADDRESS_1134645] X-ray will be conducted at the Week 24 visit. TheSchedule of Activities footnotes were reordered.
Rationale: The Schedule of Activities was updated to collect the specific items required at each visit and to reorder the footnotes in chronological order.
Section 2.2.2, Clinical Overview was updated to align the clinical trial data in this section with the latest version of IB. 
Section 2.2.2, Table [ADDRESS_1134646] version of the PF-06700841 IB to ensure absolute alignment between the 2 documents. 
Section 5.2, Exclusion Criterion #27, Zostavax
®
was added as an example of a live herpes zoster 
virus vaccination that is prohibited in the study.
Section 5.2, Exclusion Criterion #28, ‘serological’ 
was removed from the HIV criteria to broaden the HIV testing methodology. 
Section 5.2, Exclusion Criterion #32 and 
Section 8.2.6, Tuberculosis (TB) Screening and Monitoring: If a prospective participant is being treated for latent TB or is diagnosed during screening with latent TB and agrees to be treated –the requirements for a prospective participant to be eligible for the study were clarified.
Rationale: To allow participants who have been diagnosed with latent TB and are currently receiving latent TB treatment or who are were diagnosed during screening and initiated latent TB treatment to be eligible for 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

the previous versions of the protocol.
Section 5.2, Exclusion Criterion #35, If the total bilirubin is ≥1.[ADDRESS_1134647] a history of Gilbert’s syndrome and if their direct bilirubin was <U L N .
Rationale: Participants with known Gilbert’s syndrome have normal liver function despi[INVESTIGATOR_819310].
Sections 5.1, 5.3.1 and Appendix 10.4.1, Male participants are not required to use barrier contraception to minimize partner exposure to brepocitinib.
Rationale: Based on calculated exposures in semen, Brepocitinib concentrations are predicted to have a safety margin ≥100 in 
male participants, and therefore female partners are not at teratogenicity/fetotoxicity risk. This was updated in the IB (version 7.0, dated November 2021).
Section 6.1.1, Administration, Section 6.4, Study Intervention Compliance and Section 7.1.1, Temporary Discontinuation, the duration of study intervention interruption permitted was updated to14 days.  The updated text reads, “Participants interrupting study intervention for more than 14 days, should be discussed with the sponsor for possible withdrawal from the study.”
Rationale: To allow text alignment of study intervention interruptions. 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Section 6.4, Study Intervention Compliance, was 
updated to include the upper bounds of the compliance range (>120%). 
Rationale: Both the upper and lower bounds of the study intervention should be included in the protocol to provide the comprehensive compliance situation. If compliance is outside these limits, [COMPANY_007] clinical should be contact[CONTACT_819351]-compliance and if any additional safety assessments are needed.
Section 9.3, Populations for Analysis, the ‘full analysis set’ was updated to read, “All participants randomly assigned to study intervention and received at least one dose of study intervention . 
Participants will be analyzed according to the product they were randomized.” Previously the description was “All participants randomly assigned to study intervention regardless of 
whether they have taken study intervention” . 
Participants will be analyzed according to the product they were randomized.
Rationale: This change was made to accurately define the full analysis set population.
Appendix 10.13, List of Prohibited and Permitted Medications was updated to reflect accurate information on the following medications (updated text is bolded below):
!Anti-malarials: Provided pre-existing dose 
is stable for at least 12 weeks and 
treatment not started/or stopped within

PF-[ADDRESS_1134648] was updated to read, ‘direct Coombs’.
Rationale: This change was made to provide the accurate name [CONTACT_819411].
Minor typographical errors and omissions were corrected.
Amendment [ADDRESS_1134649] to allow participants with latent TB (not active TB) to be eligible for the B7931028 study provided the protocol criteria can be met.  China is having the biggest impact on enrolling participants into the study because of this eligibility criteria; however, once the next global protocol amendment is required, this language will be added as well.
Section 1.1. Synopsis, Overall Design; 
Intervention Groups and Duration Design; Section 1.2, Schema; Schedule of Activities, Footnote ‘g’; Section 4.1 Study Design (twice); Section 5.2, Exclusion Criteria #32; Section 8, Study Assessments and Procedures, Screening - the screening period was increased from 5 weeks or 35-days to 7 weeks or 49 days.  
Rationale: These additional requirements would take additional time; therefore 2 weeks were added to the screening period.  In addition, the following processes around TB testing and diagnosis of latent TB were added 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

to the protocol.  Subjects diagnosed with 
latent TB were not previous permitted into the study; however, other investigation products with similar mechanisms of action permit subject with latent TB to be entered into their studies, but they also have processes to follow to monitor participant safety.
Section 5.2, Exclusion Criteria #12: The following sentence was added to this exclusion criteria, “Prior Splenectomy is prohibited”.
Rationale: Splenectomy is associated with an increased risk of infection; therefore, it is prohibited from this study. 
Section 5.2, Exclusion Criteria #32 and Section 8.2.6,  Tuberculosis (TB) Screening and Monitoring: Latent TB – Requirements for a prospective participant to be eligible for the study if the subject is diagnosed with latent TB (ie, visit to the infectious disease/pulmonary specialist for further investigation and agreement the participant can enroll into the study, only medication to treat latent TB permitted in the study is INH and Vitamin B6 therapy) was added to the protocol as it was not permitted in previous protocol versions.
The main additions to Monitoring of TB on-study:
!Week 24, if participant tests TB positive or TB 
indeterminant, they must discontinue study medication immediately, be seen the pulmonary/infectious disease specialist, once active TB is ruled out, then if the subject start INH and B6 latent TB treatment, they must be on that treatment at least 2-weeks prior to re-starting study medication.

PF-[ADDRESS_1134650] as appropriate after the conclusion of 
the study. 
Rationale: To allow prospective participants in the study to have the possibility of being eligible for the study (by [CONTACT_819352], and the other protocol requirements completed by [CONTACT_2006] 1); whereas this was not permitted in the previous versions of the protocol.
 
 
 
  
 
 
Section 5.2, Exclusion Criteria #24 and Appendix 13, Prohibited and Permitted Medications: The following exclusion criteria was added to ensure subjects on any of the bonemarrow stimulants to improve cell counts is discontinued 12 weeks prior to Screening/Day 1.  
Rationale: In this study, a prospective participant was taking this medication.  The team felt this was not an appropriate medication to be taken while participating in an investigational study due to unknown potential safety concerns.  This exclusion criteria was added to avoid this situation in the future.
Section 2.3 Benefit/Risk Assessments and Appendix 13 Permitted and Prohibited Concomitant Medications-In Section 2.3, the phrase ‘inhibitors or’ was removed.

Page 601. PROTOCOL SUMMARY 
1.1. SynopsisRationale:
This is the first study of PF-06700841(brepocitinib) in participants with moderate to severe 
active, generalized Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) that have inadequate response to standard of care.  The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and efficacy of PF-[ADDRESS_1134685] active SLE (excluding active central nervous system [CNS] lupus or renal lupus with proteinuria (UPCr >3.0 mg/mg) and/or estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <50 mL/min/1.73 m
2) that usually require an increased level of immunosuppression.  Such 
participants with SLE are currently being managed with multiple medications, including antimalarial drugs, immunosuppressives and corticosteroids.  All these medications will be allowed as standard of care background treatment during the study.  As study intervention will be adjunct therapy to participant’s standard of care, no participants will receive placebo alone.

Overall Design:
This is a Phase 2b, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, parallel design, 
multicenter, dose ranging study to assess the efficacy and safety of PF-06700841 in participants with active, moderate to severe generalized SLE.  After an up to a 7-week screening period, eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:2:2:2 ratio such that participants will receive either 1 of three PF-06700841 once a day (QD) dose levels (15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg) or placebo every day for 52 weeks.  
Number of ParticipantsApproximately 350 randomized participants (100 participants per treatment group except 
50 participants for the PF-06700841 15 mg QD dose group) will participate in this study at approximately 185 investigative sites worldwide.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_819360]-dsDNA status.  The purpose of the stratified randomization is to achieve balanced treatment groups in these stratification factors.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Page 63Intervention Groups and Duration
For this study, the study intervention is PF-06700841.  Blinded PF-06700841 and its matched 
placebo will be provided as tablets for oral administration.  Participants will participate in this study for approximately 63 weeks.  This includes up to a 7-week screening period, the 52-week treatment period, and the 4-week follow-up period. 
Data Monitoring CommitteeThis study will use an independent external data monitoring committee (E-DMC).  The 
E-DMC will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the safety of participants in the study.This E-DMC will make recommendations with regard to continuing, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_819323] a Sponsor Management Committee throughout the study. If an interim analysis is performed, the interim analysis results will also be provided to the E-DMC for review.
Adjudication CommitteesThis study will also use separate blinded adjudication committees consisting of independent 
external experts who will be responsible for the ongoing review of the following ef ficacy and 
safety endpoints:
1. BILAG, SLEDAI-2K and associated data.  
2. Severe Flare.3. Cardiovascular and thromboembolic events.4. Malignancy.5. Opportunistic infections.
Statistical Methods:The primary estimand for the primary endpoint of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Responder 
Index (SRI-4) response at Week [ADDRESS_1134689] intercurrent events will be censored and any participant who experienced these intercurrent events will be considered as a non-responder at Week 52.  The population-level summary will be the differences in the proportions of SRI-4 responder at Week 52 between each treatment dose arm of 
PF-06700841 and the placebo arm. For the primary endpoint, a treatment policy estimand 
will also be included in the SAP as a secondary estimand to estimate the treatment difference in the SRI-4 response rate at Week 52 regardless of occurrence of any intercurrent events prior to Week 52.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Page 64Each of the three dose groups of PF-06700841 will be compared with the placebo group for 
both the primary endpoint of SRI-4 response at Week 52 and the key secondary endpoint of BICLA response at Week 52 in 6 hypotheses.  In order to control the overall family-wise type-I error rate, a sequentially rejective closed testing procedure is defined.
The primary endpoint is the proportion of SRI-4 responders at Week 52 and the primary 
analysis of this endpoint will be based on the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) approach adjusting for stratification factors.  The hypothesis testing of this endpoint will be based on the p-values for pairwise treatment comparisons between each dose group of PF-06700841 and the placebo group. Treatment difference in the proportion of responders for the active treatment compared to the placebo will be estimated based on the CMH approach. These estimates will be reported with 95% confidence intervals and one-sided p-values.
The key secondary endpoint is the proportion of BICLA responders at Week 52 and the 
primary analysis of this endpoint will be conducted in the manner described above for the primary endpoint using the CMH approach adjusting for stratification factors.  The hypothesis testing of this endpoint will be based on the p-values for pairwise treatment comparisons between each dose group of PF-06700841 and the placebo group.  Treatment difference in the proportion of responders for the active treatment compared to the placebo will be estimated based on the CMH approach.  These estimates will be reported with 95% confidence intervals and one-sided p-values.
An Interim analysis may be conducted when sufficient number of participants completes 
Week 52 visits and before the interim analysis is instigated, the details of the objectives, decision criteria, dissemination plan and method of maintaining the study blind per [COMPANY_007]’s SOPs will be documented and approved in the E-DMC charter.  In addition, the analysis details must be documented and approved in an interim analysis plan (IAP).
Further details of analyses in safety and efficacy will be specified in the statistical analysis 
plan. 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Page 742. INTRODUCTION
PF-06700841(brepocitinib) is a potent tyrosine kinase (TYK)2/Janus kinase (JAK)1 inhibitor 
that is highly selective over the other human kinases and is being developed for the treatment of participants with active Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).
PF-06700841 is an orally bioavailable small molecule with a good selectivity profile over the 
other human kinases including JAK2 and JAK3.  PF-06700841 inhibited the in vitroactivities of TYK2, JAK1, JAK2 and JAK3 with IC50 values of 22.7, 16.8 nM, 76.6 nM and 6490 nM, respectively.  PF-06700841 is capable of inhibiting the cytokines with signaling pathways mediated by [CONTACT_166527]1 and/or TYK2, incl uding type I IFNs, IL-6, IL-12, IL-15, IL-21, 
IL-22, IL-23, and IFN ∃.  Many of these cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of SLE. 
The inhibition of TYK2 and JAK1 will lead to modulation of multiple cytokines which play 
a critical role in the pathogenesis of SLE, including Type 1 interferons (IFN %,∀; 
JAK1/TYK2 dependent), IFN ∃(JAK1/JAK2 dependent), IL-6 (JAK1/JAK2/TYK2 
dependent), and IL-21(JAK1/JAK3 dependent).  In addition, IL-[ADDRESS_1134701] active SLE (excluding active central nervous system [CNS] lupus or renal lupus with proteinuria (UPCr >3.0 mg/mg) and/or estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <50 mL/min/1.73 m
2) that usually require an increased level of immunosuppression.  
Such participants with SLE are currently being managed with multiple medications, including anti-malarial drugs, immunosuppressives and corticosteroids.  All these medications will be allowed as standard of care background treatment during the study.  As study intervention will be adjunct therapy to participant’s standard of care, no participants will receive placebo alone.
2.2. Background
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown 
etiology, which can affect the skin, joints, kidneys, lungs, nervous system, serous membranes and/or other organs of the body.  Immunologic abnormalities, especially the production of 
 are a prominent feature of the disease.
2  The clinical course of 
SLE is variable and characterized by [CONTACT_519420].  Women, especially in their childbearing years, are affected more frequently than men.
3  SLE is more prevalent in 
certain racial and ethnic groups such as blacks (of African descent), Asians, and Hispanics.4  
The prevalence of lupus ranges from approximately 40 cases per 100,000 persons among Northern Europeans to more than 200 per 100,000 persons among blacks.

improvement depends on the availability of more effective and safer treatment modalities. 
The treatment of SLE can be individualized and depends on symptom manifestations, organ 
involvement, and disease severity.6,7  Antimalarials, low dose corticosteroids, and 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used in the treatment of mild symptoms such as arthralgias and cutaneous manifestations.  High dose corticosteroids and cytotoxic agents are used in more severe disease.  Immunosuppressive agents such as cyclophosphamide, tacrolimus and rituximab are used depending on the severity and various organ systems involved.  Development of novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_819324]. 
Prior to 2011, only 3 drugs were approved by [CONTACT_72563] (US FDA) for the treatment of S LE:  corticosteroi ds, hydroxychloroquine 
(Plaquenil) and low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248].  These therapi[INVESTIGATOR_819325].  In March 2011, the US FDA approved belimumab (Benlysta) for treatment of SLE, and several months later in July 2011, the European Commission granted marketing authorisation for Benlysta valid throughout the European Union.

B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages.  The hallmark of the disease is the production of 
 and the formation of immune complexes causing organ damage by 
[CONTACT_819363].  Pro-inflammatory cytokines play an important and diverse role in the pathogenesis of SLE, and their imbalance determines disease activity and severity.
Many key cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE are dependent on activation of 
Janus kinases (JAKs) for intracellular signaling.
10The JAK family of cytoplasmic protein 
tyrosine kinases mediates the signalling of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as type I (JAK1/TYK2) and type II (JAK1/JAK2) interferons, IL-6 (JAK1/JAK2/TYK2), and IL-12 and IL-23 (JAK2/TYK2). PF-06700841 is an orally administered selective and reversible inhibitor of JAK1 and TYK2.

2.2.1. Nonclinical overview
No adverse findings were observed in oral repeat-dose toxicity studies with PF-06700841 in 
rats and monkeys up to 6 and 9 months in duration, respectively.  PF-06700841-related, non-adverse, target organs identified include the immune and hematolymphopoietic systems (thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow), cardiovascular system (blood pressure, 
heart rate, corrected QT wave interval [QTc]), gastrointestinal tract (body weight and weight gain effects), and adrenal gland (vacuolation).  The findings in the thymus, spleen, lymph 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

max) of 8280 ng/mL and area under 
the curve at 24 hours (AUC 24) of 69,700 ng•h/mL) and 20 mg/kg/day in monkeys (unbound 
Cmaxof 2260 ng/mL and AUC 24of 10,700 ng•h/mL).  Adverse findings in the central nervous 
system (decreased activity, mortality, prostration, convulsions) were observed at high systemic exposures in pregnant, but not in non-pregnant rabbits. 
In oral embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, adverse PF-06700841-related 
developmental effects occurred (lower embryo-fetal viability and mean fetal body weights, fetal skeletal malformations, external malformations).  The developmental NOAEL in rabbits was 1 mg/kg/day (unbound C
maxof 174 ng/mL and AUC 24of 608 ng•h/mL). 
The developmental NOAEL in rats was not established and is <2 mg/kg/day (unbound C max
of 482 ng/mL and AUC 24of 2240 ng•h/mL), the lowest dose tested.  No effects on female 
reproductive organs, as assessed by [CONTACT_819364], were noted in either the rat or monkey repeat-dose toxicity studies.  PF -06700841 is not mutagenic in bacterial reverse 
mutation assays.  Although PF-06700841 was positive for micronuclei formation in vitro (through an aneugenic mechanism), it did not induce micronuclei in vivo in rats at 
55 mg/kg/day (unbound C
max= 7730 ng/mL and AUC 24= 88,300 ng•h/mL), the highest dose 
tested in the 1-month oral toxicity study. 
Further details of the nonclinical safety program are provided in the current PF-06700841

Page [IP_ADDRESS]. Safety Overview
Overall, PF-06700841 was generally safe and well tolerated in all clinical trials to date.  
There were no clinically meaningful findings in vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECG), suicidal behavior or ideation, or potential Hy’s Law cases reported during these studies. 
Refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for more details on the clinical safety 
information with PF-06700841.
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Phase 1 Studies (B7931001 and B7931009)
The most commonly reported all causality treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
across active healthy participants were serum creatinine increased (reported in 2 participants during the SAD period and 11 participants during the MAD period) without any changes in Cystatin C measured renal function.  Neutropenia was reported in four participants during the MAD period, most of them were mild in severity except one with moderate, and none of them reached <500/mm
3during the study.  The most frequently observed laboratory 
abnormalities in healthy participants were elevated low density lipoprotein (LDL) and serum creatinine.  There were no deaths or serious adverse events (SAEs) reported in the Phase 1 studies.  One psoriasis participant receiving 100 mg QD of Study intervention (IP) in B7931001 experienced an adverse event of herpes zoster during the follow up period, after completing 28-day treatment.

A total of [ADDRESS_1134712] 
1 dose of PF-06700841 during the study.  The proportion of participants with all-causality TEAEs was comparable across all treatment arms but numerically higher in the active treatment arms (64.0% to 76.7%) than the placebo group (56.5%).  The majority of participants in all treatment arms experienced mild or moderate all-causality TEAEs, and only 5.2% experienced severe all-causality TEAEs. 
Overall, there were no dose dependent increases in the all-causality TEAEs.  Most TEAEs in 
the Infection and Infestation class were mild to moderate except one participant who had two serious infections after taking a single dose of 60 mg PF-06700841 on Day 1.  One participant in the 30 mg QD to 100 mg once a week (QW) group had squamous cell carcinoma of skin reported on Day [ADDRESS_1134713] baseline level during 8-week maintenance phase.  Increases in serum creatinine from baseline were observed in all active treatment arms with no association of change in cystatin C based renal function measurement.  Other commonly reported laboratory abnormalities were elevation of low density lipid (LDL) with no clinical meaningful changes in LDL/HDL ratio.  There were no clinically meaningful changes from baseline observed in creatine kinase (CK) during the study.  CK levels >10 × upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed in two participants 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Other TEAEs were Gastrointestinal Disorders (23.4% in the IP vs 25.5% in the placebo).  Most of those TEAEs were mild.  There were two participants receiving PF-06700841 that experienced rhabdomyolysis after strenuously exercising during the study, which were not considered to be related to the IP by [CONTACT_3138].  Three participants experienced mild decreases in neutrophils, one participant had a mild reduction in platelets, and one participant a mild reduction in lymphocytes.

PF-06700841 was absorbed rapi[INVESTIGATOR_819328] (T
max) of 1 hour or less.  
Mean terminal half-life (t ½) ranged from 3.8 to 7.5 hours.  In general, both the area under the 
plasma concentration time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC inf) and maximum 
plasma concentration (C max) appeared to increase proportionally with dose from 1 mg to 
100 mg.  Increases from 100 mg to 200 mg appear more than dose proportional, especially for AUC
inf.
On Day 10 of multiple dose administration, PF-06700841 was absorbed rapi[INVESTIGATOR_377459] T
maxof 1 to 1.5 hours or less across the entire range of doses, from a total daily dose of 
10 mg up to 175 mg.  Following attainment of C max, the disposition of PF-06700841 was 
similar with that observed following single dose administration.  Mean terminal half-life (t ½) 
ranged from 4.9 to 10.7 hours.  Both area under the concentration time curve from time 0 to 
time&(AUC t) and C maxgenerally appeared to increase proportionally with dose from 10 mg 
to 100 mg QD, with a trend towards greater than proportional increase from 100 mg to 
175 mg QD.  Accumulations, following once daily dosing, ranged from 1.1 to 1.4 for AUC t
and 0.8 to 1.1 for C max.  The urinary recovery of unchanged (Ae &%) PF-06700841 on Day 10 
across all doses ranged from 8.9% to 15.5%.  Following multiple dose administration of PF-06700841 to participants with psoriasis for 28 days, the overall exposure observed was comparable to that in healthy participants at same dose level.

2.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment
PF-06700841, a TYK2/JAK1 inhibitor, is expected to offer therapeutic benefit in the 
treatment of SLE.  Indeed, compared with other JAK inhibitors, inhibition of IL-12 and IL-23 signaling mediated by [CONTACT_488043]2 inhibitory activity may provide a new and improved therapeutic benefit.  Study participants could benefit from the potential achievement of disease control, improvement of signs and symptoms, as well as improvements in quality of life.
Based on the current clinical and nonclinical experience with brepocitinib and other 
information from other approved oral JAK inhibitors (eg, Xeljanz
®(tofacitinib), Jakafi®
(ruxolitinib), Olumiant®(baricitinib), and Rinvoq®(upadacitinib), the potential risks for 
brepocitinib include: (1) viral reactivation; (2) serious infection and opportunistic infections; 
(3) malignancy and lymphoproliferative disorders; (4) hematological abnormalities and other alterations in laboratory parameters: decreased neutrophil counts, change in lymphocyte counts, decreased hemoglobin level, decreased platelet counts, and elevation of hepatic transaminases; (5) alterations in the lipid profile; (6) increases in serum creatinine; (7) increases in creatine phosphokinase; (8) QT prolongation, (9) bone changes for oral route of administration in the administration in the <12 years of age group; (10) vaccinations: and (11) thromboembolism.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

#6have more detailed information. 
Based on in vitro data, and the clinical DDI study of brepocitinib with itraconazole, moderate and strong cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inducers, strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, P-gp substrates and substrates of OCT2/MATE with a narrow therapeutic index, will be prohibited during oral PF-06700841 treatment periods in ongoing Phase 2 studies to minimize any potential significant drug interaction.  Detailed information about in vitro assessments on drug metabolism, enzyme phenotype and drug-drug interaction can be found in the investigator’s brochure.
In conclusion, the sponsor considers that the available information from the nonclinical and 
clinical studies completed to date with PF-06700841 provide a favorable benefit-risk profile and support its continued investigation as a potential treatment for SLE.  
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably 
expected adverse events (AEs) of PF-06700841 may be found in the current IB, which is the single reference safety document (SRSD) for this study.

4. STUDY DESIGN
4.1. Overall DesignThis is a Phase 2b, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, parallel design, 
multicenter, dose-ranging study to assess the efficacy and safety of PF-06700841 in participants with active, moderate to severe generalized SLE.  After a 7-week screening period, eligible participants will be randomly assigned to one of the four treatment groups (A-D in Table 2) in a 1:2:2:2 ratio such that participants will receive either 1 of three PF-06700841 QD dose levels (15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg) or placebo every day for [ADDRESS_1134731] to follow-up.
Approximately 350 randomized participants (100 participants per treatment group except 
50 participants for the PF-06700841 15 mg QD dose group) will participate in this study at approximately 185 investigative sites worldwide.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_819367] (SLEDAI-2K total adjudicated score) and anti-dsDNA status.  The purpose of the stratified randomization is to achieve balanced treatment groups in these stratification factors.  
Table2. Treatment Group
Treatment Group Treatment Group Description Participant Size
A PF-06700841 15 mg QD 50
B PF-06700841 30 mg QD 100
C PF-06700841 45 mg QD 100
D Placebo 100
For this study, the study intervention is PF-06700841.  Blinded PF-06700841 and its matched placebo will be provided as tablets for oral administration.  Participants will participate in this study for approximately up to 63 weeks.  This includes up to a 7-week screening period, a 52-week treatment period, and a 4-week follow-up period. 
4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design
The primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of participants achieving Systemic Lupus 
Erythematosus Responder Index (SRI)-4 at Week 52.  The SRI is a disease activity index developed for use in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) clinical trials in collaboration with the FDA.  It detects both improvement and worsening in the same and different organ systems, and it was validated in a long term clinical trial and is compatible with regulatory guidance from both the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and FDA.  The SRI is a composite score utilizing the SLEDAI to assess improvement, the BILAG to assess 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Page 100significant worsening or flares, and the physician global assessment (PhGA) to assess 
whether or not there has been any significant deterioration in the participant’s overall condition.  The 4-point improvement in the SRI has been shown to be a clinically meaningful change in large, randomized control studies.
12  Therefore, the SRI-4 was chosen for the 
primary efficacy assessment in this study.  Based on published data 52 weeks of treatment is appropriate to establish efficacy of a new compound in SLE. 
The key secondary endpoint of the study is the proportion of participants achieving BICLA 
response at Week 52.  BICLA is a composite endpoint requiring  that the following criteria are met: improvement in the BILAG-2004 score (improvement in all BILAG-2004 grade A scores at study entry to grades B, C, or D at follow-up; improvement in all BILAG-2004 grade B scores at study entry to grades C or D at follow-up); no worsening in the BILAG-2004 score (no new BILAG-2004 grade A scores; no more than 1 new BILAG-2004 grade B score); no increase compared to baseline in the SLEDAI-2K total score; no worsening compared to baseline (10-mm increase on a 100-mm visual analog scale) in the physician’s global assessment of disease activity; and no disallowed prohibited changes in concomitant medications (corticosteroids, immunomodulators or antimalarials). BICLA was developed as an alternative method to the SRI-[ADDRESS_1134732] demonstrated improvement. Additionally SRI considers  disease activity to be reduced based on normalization of serological markers ( ) while BICLA ( 
based on BILAG scoring) does not consider reduction in serologic markers as evidence of improvement. 
In prior versions of this protocol, time to severe flare had been proposed as a major 
secondary endpoint, however [COMPANY_007] considers that it is scientifically justified to change the key secondary endpoint to BICLA in this study for [ADDRESS_1134733], in prior versions of this protocol, the incidence of severe flare in a moderate to severe lupus population was considered to be 25% per year. This flare rate is an overestimation of what has been seen in 
multiple SLE studies conducted in patients with moderate to severe disease, where the severe 
flare rate generally approximates 5-10% annually. Based on this information, the major secondary endpoint of severe flare was estimated to be underpowered. Second, although there is fairly good concordance between SRI and BICLA, there is occasionally a difference in the reduction in disease activity assessed by [CONTACT_819368], as illustrated by [CONTACT_819369] 2 anifrolumab phase 2 studies. Elevating BICLA to a secondary endpoint recognizes the importance of looking for consistency between both outcome measures in the current trial. Finally, BICLA response, similar to SRI response, has been shown to correlated with general improvement in patient physical and mental health, demonstrating that BICLA response is clinically meaningful to both patients and health care providers.

PF-[ADDRESS_1134734] participants treated with corticosteroids (CS) on a dose as low as 
possible to minimize side effects/long term damage associated with administration of CS.  A low dose of CS has been associated with a lower risk of sustaining long-term damage, hence the specification that participants should be tapered to a dose ≤7.5 mg/day of prednisone (or 
equivalent).
Approximately 350 participants will be enrolled in the study with 100 participants per 
treatment group with the exception of the PF-06700841 15 mg QD dose group, which will enroll approximately 50 participants.  Based on evidence from other studies, the 15 mg dose does not inhibit inflammatory cytokine effects to the same extent as the proposed 30 mg and 45 mg doses and is likely to be a subtherapeutic dose.  Because SLE is a severe debilitating disease and participants with unabated disease activity may accrue end-organ damage over time, it is decided to reduce the number of participants for the 15 mg QD dose arm. 
It is estimated that 5 to 10% of study participants may be taking concomitant mycophenolate 
mofetil (MMF) at study entry.  Target trough levels for therapeutic effect and levels at which risk of adverse effects of MMF are more likely to occur have been characterized and therapeutic drug monitoring to ascertain exposures within the defined target ranges can be obtained easily at central laboratories.
[ADDRESS_1134735].  Therefore, as participants taper corticosteroids, the rate of MMF metabolism may decrease and MMF levels may rise by [CONTACT_45848] 30-35%.
16  Since participants in this study are required to taper 
corticosteroids (when appropriate), measurement of the active metabolite of MMF, mycophenolic acid (MPA), prior to and following corticosteroid tapering will be evaluated in this study. 
Trough levels of MMF will be measured at Day [ADDRESS_1134736] MMF dose.  Should participants develop adverse events suggestive of high MMF levels (decreases in cellular blood counts, serious infections) additional safety monitoring of MPA levels may be requested.

4.3. Justification for Doses
This Phase 2b, dose-ranging study will assess three PF-06700841 doses (15 mg, 30 mg and 
45 mg) administered once a day (QD) for 52 weeks in comparison to placebo. 
Doses selected for this Phase 2 study are based on the safety and efficacy observed to date 
with PF-06700841 in healthy participants (B7931001) and participants with active psoriasis (B7931001 and B7931004) and alopecia areata (B7931005).  The overall safety profile to date with PF-06700841 has been acceptable with doses up to 60 mg QD for 4 weeks and 30 mg QD for up to 20 weeks in completed studies.  Ongoing studies in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are assessing the [ADDRESS_1134737] a greater overall risk for severe infections due to underlying immune defects as well as to the common use of immunosuppressants, including corticosteroids.
Based on the preliminary population PK analysis with combined data from studies B7931001 
in healthy participants and B7931004 in participants with moderate to severe psoriasis, the expected median steady state exposures (AUC
24) following 15, 30 and 45 mg QD are 677, 
1360 and 2030 ng.h/mL, respectively in a patient population.  As a result, the exposure of PF-06700841 (AUC
24) at [ADDRESS_1134738] levels (NOAELs) observed in the 6-month rat (45 
mg/kg/day) and 9-month monkey (20 mg/kg/day) studies, respectively.  The pharmacological 
activity of PF-06700841 was assessed by [CONTACT_819371] C-reactive protein 
(hsCRP) in participants with moderate to severe psoriasis (B7931004).  In study B7931004, the median reduction (percent change from baseline) of hsCRP observed at week 4 were approximately 61% and 76% with PF-[ADDRESS_1134739] on hsCRP within approximately 2 weeks after start of treatment and remained constant throughout the 12-week treatment period.  Previous studies suggested that the baseline levels of hsCRP in participants with moderate to severe psoriasis and active SLE were comparable (median of ~2.9 mg/dL in both participant populations).  As a result, the median hsCRP reduction with PF-[ADDRESS_1134740] to be between 61% to 76% in participants with active SLE in the current study. 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )CCI

5.3. Lifestyle Considerations
5.3.1. ContraceptionParticipants must understand that they should avoid becoming pregnant during this study.  
The investigator or his or her designee, in consultation with the participant, will confirm that the participant has selected a protocol permitted method of contraception from the permitted list of contraception methods (see Appendix 4) and will confirm that the participant has been 
instructed in its consistent and correct use.  The method of contraception used by [CONTACT_819376]. At all visits, the investigator or designee will inform the participant of the need to use highly effective contraception consistently and correctly and document the conversation and the participant’s affirmation in the participant’s chart (participants need to affirm their consistent and correct use of at least 1 of the selected methods of contraception).  In addition, the investigator or designee will instruct the participant to call immediately if the selected contraception method is discontinued or if pregnancy is known or suspected in the participant or partner.
5.3.2. Surgery
During the study, no elective surgery should occur without first consulting with the sponsor.  
Preferably, elective surgery should occur before the study or be delayed until participation in the study is completed. 
The sponsor should be notified if a participant requires surgery (including dental surgery) 
during the study to determine whether the participant should discontinue from the study and/or discontinue the study intervention prior to the surgical procedure.  In general, planned surgical procedures should not be performed unless the study intervention has been discontinued for at least 2 days (unless otherwise advised by [CONTACT_456]).  In addition, the sponsor should be notified as soon as possible if a participant undergoes a surgical procedure without first informing the study staff.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )CCI

6.2.1. Preparation and Dispensing
The study intervention will be dispensed using an IRT drug management system at each visit 
from Visit 2 to Visit 16.  A qualified staff member will dispense the study intervention via unique container numbers in the blister cards provided, in quantities appropriate for the study visit schedule.  The participant/caregiver should be instructed to maintain the product in the blister cards provided throughout the course of dosing and return the blister cards to the site at the next study visit.
6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding
6.3.1. Allocation to Study InterventionAllocation of participants to treatment groups will proceed through the use of an interactive 
response technology (IRT) system (interactive web-based response [IWR]).  The site personnel (study coordinator or specified designee) will be required to enter or select information including but not limited to the user’s identification (ID) and password, the protocol number, and the participant number.  The site personnel will then be provided with a treatment assignment, randomization number, and dispensable unit (DU) or container number when study intervention is being supplied via the IRT system.  The IRT system will provide a confirmation report containing the participant number, randomization number, and DU or container number assigned.  The confirmation report must be stored in the site’s files. 
Study intervention will be dispensed at the study visits summarized in the Schedule of 
Activities . 
Returned study intervention must not be redispensed to the participants.The study-specific IRT reference manual and IP manual will provide the contact [CONTACT_22810].
Participants will be assigned to receive study intervention according to randomization

6.4. Study Intervention Compliance
Study intervention will be self-administered by [CONTACT_177146].  Participant compliance 
will be monitored by [CONTACT_819378]. 
Participants will be directed to bring blister cards with any remaining study intervention to 
study visits for review.  Compliance with expected consumption of dispensed study intervention will be assessed by [CONTACT_819379] (tablet count) during any given time period.  Compliance will be documented on the CRF and in the source records. 
If compliance is <80%, or >120%, the investigator or designee will counsel the participant 
and ensure steps are taken to improve compliance. If compliance is outside these limits,[COMPANY_007] clinical should be contact[CONTACT_819351]-compliance and if any additional safety assessments are needed. Participants interrupting study intervention for more than [ADDRESS_1134771] be rigorously maintained throughout the duration of the study until all study intervention has been 
accounted for and/or returned to the sponsor (or appointed agent).  Any discrepancies noted 
between drug dispensing records and drug inventory must be reported to the sponsor.
6.5. Concomitant Therapy
Prohibited drugs must be discontinued according to protocol guidelines; a list of prohibited 
drugs with specific discontinuation recommendations is listed in Appendix 13 .

Page 1226.5.1. Corticosteroids
[IP_ADDRESS]. Use of Corticosteroids and Tapering GuidelinesParticipants are allowed to receive a stable dose of oral corticosteroids at study entry as 
described in Section 4 and over the treatment period as described below.  A detailed history 
of corticosteroid use will be collected at screening.  
Participants may be given supplemental (ie, in addition to the stable dose) oral corticosteroids 
at baseline through Week [ADDRESS_1134772] be resumed.  
A single intramuscular IM dose of methylprednisolone (Depo-Medrol) 60 mg (or equivalent 
see Appendix 14 ) administered as [ADDRESS_1134773] not be modified in participants who receive IM corticosteroids. 
To minimize potential long term side effects (including infection risk), PIs are required to 
decrease corticosteroids to the lowest safely tolerated dose when appropriate.  The tapering goal for prednisone (or equivalent see Appendix 14 ) is 7.5 mg per day or less by [CONTACT_819380] (Week 12 and Week 40), however the corticosteroid tapering schedule is flexible and at the discretion of individual PIs based on participants’ clinical signs and symptoms.  Corticosteroid tapering is allowed only during Weeks 2-12 and Weeks 24-40. 
The decision to initiate or intensify corticosteroid therapy should be carefully considered by 
[CONTACT_093], and depends on various factors, including the severity of the participants’ symptoms and type of organ involvement.  However, an important outcome in this study will be whether or not PF-[ADDRESS_1134774] a difference in corticosteroid use across arms in this study, beginning at Week 2 and continuing through Week 12, and again during Weeks 24-40, steroid tapering to an oral corticosteroid (OCS) dose of ≤7.5 mg/day is required in all participants when appropriate. 
The following guidance must be adhered to for steroid tapering:
1. Do not need to taper steroids if the participant has new, worsening, still active SLE 
disease activity and meets any of the below criteria:
!SLEDAI-2K activity which is worsened compared to baseline in major organ 
systems (renal, CNS, cardiopulmonary, vasculitis, fever, thrombocytopenia, or 
haemolytic anaemia, or gastrointestinal activity).
!BILAG – any new BILAG A or B.
!Moderate to severe skin disease as reflected by a CLASI activity score of ≥10.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )
PF-[ADDRESS_1134775] be tapered if the participating meets the following criteria:
!The total SLEDAI score decreases by 4 points from baseline; AND
!There is no new BILAG A or B.
3. Participants that do not meet the criteria in one or two of the scenarios above, must 
attempt to taper at the investigator's discretion.
For participants who have tapered during Weeks 2-12 and Weeks 24-40, the dose may be 
increased once during each of the 2 taper windows to a maximum dose of 20 mg/day (prednisone equivalent see Appendix 14) for a maximum of [ADDRESS_1134776] be resumed.  
Between Weeks 12-24, steroid doses should remain as stable as possible.  No change in 
steroid dosing, either up or down, is allowed between Week 40-Week 52. In addition, any time prior to Week 28, if the dose of oral corticosteroids exceeds 30 mg/day, this should be discussed with the medical monitor and may result in discontinuation of study intervention.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Record of Corticosteroids 
Participants will be required to follow the corticosteroid dosing guidelines during the 
treatment period of the study.  The investigator/site staff will review the participants corticosteroid use at each study visit and record in the participant’s CRF.  It is recommended that corticosteroids be tapered as quickly as clinically feasible.  No change in steroid dosing is allowed between Weeks 12-[ADDRESS_1134777] bites or asthmatic exacerbations see Appendix 13 . 
In addition, the intake of oral corticosteroids taken by [CONTACT_819381] a separate CRF.  The CRF page will capture the name [CONTACT_819414], indication for use, total daily dose, route of administration, and start date and stop dates of administration.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Management of Severe Flare and/or Worsening of Disease 
During the treatment period, those participants who experience a severe flare requiring new 
or increased doses of immunosuppressants (including new or increased doses of corticosteroids beyond that outlined in Appendix 13: List of Prohibited and Permitted 
Concomitant Medications ) or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or worsening of disease requiring new or 
increased doses of immunosuppressants or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], will be discontinued from treatment, and will receive no further study intervention. 
In addition, those participants who require oral corticosteroid doses greater than 15 mg/day 
prednisone (or equivalent see Appendix 14 ) at or after the Week 28 visit will be discontinued

Page 125The early discontinuation visit applies only to participants who are randomized and then are 
prematurely withdrawn from the study.  The participant will be permanently discontinued both from the study intervention and from the study at that time.
If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any remaining 
samples, but data already generated from the samples will continue to be available, and may be used to protect the integrity of existing analyses.  The investigator must document any such requests in the site study records.
If the participant withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent (see below) for 
disclosure of future information, no further evaluations should be performed and no additional data should be collected.  The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent.
When a participant withdraws from the study because of an SAE, the SAE must be recorded 
on the CRF and reported on the Clinical Trial (CT) SAE Report.
Lack of completion of all or any of the withdrawal/early termination procedures will not be 
viewed as protocol deviations so long as the participant’s safety was preserved.
Withdrawal of Consent: Participants who request to discontinue receipt of study intervention will remain in the study 
throughout Week [ADDRESS_1134779] with him or her or persons previously authorized by [CONTACT_104140].  The withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by [CONTACT_093], as to whether the withdrawal is only from further receipt of study intervention or also from study procedures and/or posttreatment study follow-up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page.  In the event that vital status (whether the participant is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly available information should be used to determine vital status only as appropriately directed in accordance with local law.

Discontinuation of specific sites or of the study as a whole is handled as part of Appendix 1 .
8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
The investigator (or an appropriate delegate at the investigator site) must obtain a signed and 
dated ICD before performing any study-specific procedures.  
Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the Schedule of Activities. Protocol
waivers or exemptions are not allowed.Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study intervention.
Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the Schedule of 
Activities , is essential and required for study conduct.
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria.  The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable.
Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood 
count) and obtained before signing of the ICD may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedures met the protocol-specified criteria and were performed within the time frame defined in the Schedule of Activities.
Every effort should be made to ensure that protocol-required tests and procedures are completed as described.  However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may be circumstances outside the control of the investigator that may make it unfeasible to perform the test.  In these cases, the investigator must take all steps necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of the participant.  When a protocol-required test cannot be performed, the investigator will document the reason for the missed test and any corrective and preventive actions that he or she has taken to ensure that required processes are adhered to as soon as possible.  The study team must be informed of these incidents in a timely manner.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )
PF-[ADDRESS_1134780] information will be provided to the investigator site prior to initiation of the study.
The total blood sampling volume for individual participants during the treatment period is 
approximately 470 mL.  The actual collection times of blood sampling may change.  Additional blood samples may be taken for safety assessments at times specified by [CONTACT_4618], provided the total volume taken during the study does not exceed 550 mL during any period of 60 consecutive days.
Screening For screening procedures, see Schedule of Activities .
Participants will be screened within 49 days prior to administration of the initial dose of 
study intervention in order to confirm that they meet the participant eligibility criteria for the study.  The investigator (or appropriate delegate at the investigator site) will obtain informed consent from each participant in accordance with the procedures described in Appendix 1. 
Screening visits may occur over multiple visits to achieve all of the required testing.
Screening laboratory tests with abnormal results may be repeated once to confirm abnormal 
results.  The last value will be used to determine eligibility.  If results return to normal within the 7-week screening period, the participant may enter the study. 
Participants who do not meet the eligibility criteria (screen failure was determined) may be 
re-screened once at a later date (which must be at least ≥2 weeks after screen failure was 
determined to initiate any re-screening procedures).  Participants who are pregnant at the time of their initial screening visit may not be rescreened.  Any participant who is re-screened must be re-consented and receive a new participant number.  All activities required for the screening visit must be repeated. Participants are not permitted to rescreen if they have any of the following positive laboratory results: Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis B cDNA, Hepatitis C antibody, HIV screen or an IGRA.
Participant eligibility will be reviewed and confirmed by [CONTACT_23638]/or a consultant to 
the sponsor.  Sites will be required to submit appropriate documentation of participants deemed to be eligible to review and approve.  Participants cannot be randomized into the study until eligibility is confirmed.

participants in this study.  The minimum qualifications a rater must meet for each study rating assessment will be outlined in the Rater Assessment Manual provided to each participating site.  The level of experience with the target population (or equivalent), specific scale experience, and certification required (if applicable) will be listed and used to determine whether a rater is approved for a given assessment.  Proposed raters who do not meet specific criteria but who may be qualified based on unique circumstances may be individually reviewed by [CONTACT_22820] a waiver may be issued.  The rater must become certified to perform selected study assessments before he or she can participate in the conduct of the study.  For specifically defined assessments, rater training and standardization exercises may be conducted, and written and signed documentation will be provided by [CONTACT_22821]’s certification.  In return, each site will be provided written and signed documentation outlining each rater’s certification for specific study assessments.  Recertification may be required at periodic intervals during the study.  The raters who administer specific study assessments will be documented in a centralized location and all site staff who administer ratings will be verified in the site study documentation during the conduct of the study.

with at least one clinical criterion AND one immunologic criterion OR 2) Lupus nephritis as the sole clinical criterion in the presence of ANA or anti-dsDNA antibodies. 
8.1.4. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Responder Index (SRI)-4
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of three PF-06700841 QD dose 
levels (15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg) relative to placebo in participants with active SLE using the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Responder Index (SRI) at 52 weeks.  The primary endpoint of this study is the SRI-4 response rate at Week 52.  The components of this composite endpoint are the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index-2000 (SLEDAI-2K),
18the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) 2004,19and the 
Physician’s Global Assessment (PhGA). 
The endpoint is designed to assure that if improvements occur, they are not accompanied by 
[CONTACT_183552]-relevant worsening.  The SRI-[ADDRESS_1134783] also show no worsening of disease as measured by [CONTACT_819383] a responder.  If either tool shows worsening, the participant is not considered a responder, despi[INVESTIGATOR_819333]-2K.

specific organ system because it is responsive to worsening severity of disease manifestations 
as well as the onset of new disease manifestations in specific organ domains.  Only features attributable to SLE disease activity are recorded and not due to damage, infection, thrombosis (in absence of inflammatory process) or other conditions. 
The BILAG [ADDRESS_1134786] (as applicable) are then combined into 9 organ domains (constitutional, mucocutaneous, neuropsychiatric, musculoskeletal, cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_696], GI, ophthalmic, renal and hematological).  BILAG scoring is based on the “intention to treatment” paradigm.  Each organ domain is given a score from A to E depending on the SLE clinical manifestations.  An “A” score represents an increase in disease activity sufficient to normally require intensification of therapy with steroids or immunosuppressants.  A “B” score represents moderate, reversible manifestations requiring antimalarials, NSAIDs, or low dose steroids.  A “C” score reflects mild, stable disease.  A “D” score indicates no current disease activity in a previously affected organ system.  An “E” score indicates the organ system has never been involved. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Physician Global Assessment (PhGA)
The Physician Global Assessment (PhGA) is a measure of worsening in the participants 
general health status rather than the disease activity in a specific organ (see Appendix 18).  
The investigator will mark a visual analog scale answering the question “Evaluate the participants lupus activity since the last visit using the visual analog scale” indicating the participants overall disease activity at a particular visit.  The investigator’s response will be recorded using a visual analog scale (VAS) by [CONTACT_1299] a mark on the scale between 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), and 3 (severe). 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )CCI

The secondary objective is to assess the severe flare rate in PF-[ADDRESS_1134788] severe flare as measured by [CONTACT_819384]-SLEDAI SLE Flare Index (SFI);
20
(see Appendix 19 ).  This index categorizes SLE flares as either “mild or moderate” or 
“severe” based on 6 variables:  change in SLEDAI-2K score from most recent assessment to current, change in signs or symptoms of disease activity, change in prednisone (or equivalent see Appendix 14) dose, use of new medication for disease activity or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], change 
in PhGA score, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1086] r SLE activity (sev ere flar e only). 
The modified SELENA-SLEDAI Flare Index (mSSFI) requires that a participant who has a
SLEDAI score >[ADDRESS_1134789] one other component present.  This modification was made because participants entering the trial with high disease activity (ie, ≥11) could too easily trigger a severe flare by [CONTACT_819385]. 
Lupus flares will also be assessed using an experimental version of the modified 
SELENA-SLEDAI Flare Index (mSSFI), which eliminates medication criteria from the modified SELENA-SLEDAI SFI.

  All severe 
SLE flares will be reviewed by a blinded central adjudication committee as discussed in Section 9.5.2.

8.1.7. Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Damage Index for SLE
The Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC)/ACR Damage Index for 
SLE records damage occurring in participants with SLE regardless of the cause (see Appendix 10 ).  The damage index does not include hematologic items such as cytopenias, 
since these can be a waxing and waning phenomena; other manifestations need to have been present for at least 6 months.  It has been found to be well-defined and reliable for measuring organ damage.  The SLICC/ACR damage index is useful both as a descriptor for participants included in studies, as well as an outcome measure for therapeutic trials and prognosis.

8.1.8. Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI)
The Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI; see 
Appendix 20) was designed to convert subjective elements of disease severity into objective data by [CONTACT_3553] a scoring system.
24  This validated index has separate scores for activity 
and damage so that it is possible to monitor the course of the disease over time and in response to therapy.  The CLASI activity (CLASI-A) score is based upon degree of erythema, scale, mucous membrane lesions, and non-scarring alopecia.  Increased weight is assigned to the face and neck, relative to other less frequently involved parts of the body.
8.1.9. Photography
Photography will only be performed at sites in the [LOCATION_002] and is an optional procedure. 
For participants with a CLASI-A score ≥10 at baseline, clinical photographs of the area of 
active skin involvement should be obtained at baseline, Week 12, Week 24, Week 52, where

This questionnaire is only collected for participants enrolled after protocol amendment 4 or 5 has been approved.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Health Care Resource Use (HCRU)
Participants utilization of the health care system outside of the clinical trial will be assessed 
using the Health Care Resource Use (HCRU) questionnaire.  Questions will be asked to gauge any physician and specialist visits as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_819335].  The questionnaire is to be completed by [CONTACT_102].  A copy of the HCRU can be found in the PRO manual. 
8.2. Safety Assessments
Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the Schedule of Activities.  
Unscheduled clinical laboratory measurements may be obtained at any time during the study 
to assess any perceived safety concerns.
8.2.1. Assessments at Screening Only
[IP_ADDRESS]. Medical HistoryComplete medical history, SLE disease history (including disease duration, extent of disease, 
and prior treatments), cardiovascular disease history, venous thromboembolic event history and smoking history will be collected at Screening. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Chest X-Ray
Chest radiograph (posterior-anterior and lateral views are recommended, however, local 
guidelines should be followed) or other approved diagnostic test (ie, CT scan with or without contrast or MRI) with no evidence of current, active TB or previous inactive TB, general infections, heart failure, malignancy, or other clinically significant findings in the chest taken at screening or within [ADDRESS_1134795] or MRI shows any

A complete physical examination will include, at a minimum, head, ears, eyes, nose, mouth, 
skin, heart and lung examinations, lymph nodes, and gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and neurological systems. 
A brief physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of general appearance, 
heart, lungs, skin, musculoskeletal and any other patient and participant-reported symptoms. 
Physical examinations may be conducted by a physician, trained physician's assistant, or 
nurse practitioner as acceptable according to local regulation. 
Height and weight will also be measured and recorded as per the Schedule of Activities. For 
measuring weight, a scale with appropriate range and resolution is used and must be placed 
on a stable, flat surface.  Participants must remove shoes, bulky layers of clothing, and jackets so that only light clothing remains.  They must also remove the contents of their pockets and remain still during measurement of weight. 
8.2.3. Vital Signs
Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_110387]) will be measured after 
[ADDRESS_1134798] as indicated in the Schedule of Activities . 
Blood pressure (BP) will be measured using a standard calibrated blood pressure measuring device.  A BP device that uses multiple cuff sizes for the participant based on the arm circumference is required.  The arm circumference at the midpoint of the length of the upper arm should be measured to determine the appropriate cuff size in accordance with the specifications of the BP measuring device.  The properly sized and calibrated blood pressure cuff will be used to measure blood pressure each time.  The use of an automated device for measuring BP and pulse rate is acceptable, although, when done manually, pulse rate will be measured in the brachial/radial artery for at least 30 seconds. 
Participants should be seated in a chair, back supported, and arms bared (free of restrictions 
such as rolled-up sleeves, etc) and supported at the level of the heart.  Measurements should be taken on the same arm (preferably the non-dominant arm) at each visit throughout the study after [ADDRESS_1134799] mm Hg.  Participants should refrain from smoking (or use any tobacco products) or ingesting caffeine during the [ADDRESS_1134800].
Since all clinical assessments were validated using oral temperatures, it is important to 
ONLY take oral temperatures on study; oral thermometers will be supplied by [CONTACT_819361].090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )
PF-[ADDRESS_1134801] 10 minutes in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_819336]. 
A single ECG measurement will be collected at all scheduled visits except at baseline on 
Day 1 where ECG will be collected in triplicate approximately 2-4 minutes apart.  At Week 2 visit, an ECG will be collected approximately 3 hours after dosing at the study site.
  The 
Day 1 ECG values (average of the triplicate measures) will serve as each participant’sbaseline values. If Day 1 ECG is missing, then screening ECG will serve as baseline value.To ensure safety of the participants, a qualified individual (investigator or sub-investigator) at the investigator site will make comparisons to baseline measurements.  ECG data will be submitted to a central laboratory for measurement.  The final ECG report from the central laboratory should be maintained in the participant’s source documentation and be the final interpretation of the ECG recording.  Any clinically significant changes from the baseline Day 1 ECG may potentially be AEs ( Appendix 7 ) and should be evaluated further, as 
clinically warranted. 
In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead 
placement as contributing to the ECG abnormality.  It is important that leads be placed in the same positions each time in order to achieve precise ECG recordings.  If a machine-read QTc value is prolonged, as defined above, repeat measurements may not be necessary if a qualified medical provider’s interpretation determines that the QTc values are in the acceptable range.
ECG values of potential clinical concern are listed in Appendix 7 .
8.2.5. Hepatitis Screening and Monitoring
During the study screening period, all participants will be screened for hepatitis B surface 
antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis surface antibody (HBsAb) and hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb). 
!Participants who are HBsAg positive will be excluded.
!Participants who have negative HBsAg, positive HBcAb, and negative HBsAb will be excluded. 
!Participants who have negative HBsAg, negative HBcAb and positive HBsAb and provide a documentation of prior HBV vaccination are eligible for the study and will not require HBV DNA monitoring during the study.

!Participants will be excluded with detectable HBV DNA. 
In addition, all participants will be screened for hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV Ab) during the study screening period.  Participants who are positive for HCV Ab will be reflex-tested for hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) and, if HCV RNA is positive, they will be screen-failed.
If hepatitis B reactivation has been confirmed during the study based upon the above 
evaluations, the participant should not receive further doses of the study intervention.  Investigators should consider such as event as medically important and report the event as an SAE in accordance with the process described in Appendix 3 .
8.2.6. Tuberculosis (TB) Screening and Monitoring
[IP_ADDRESS]. Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) Tuberculin TestParticipants should be screened for TB using an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) and 
it is preferable that a QuantiFERON
®gold test be obtained and sent to the central laboratory, 
although it is acceptable for a locally approved IGRA to be used per local guidelines.  IGRA will be tested during screening or within 12 weeks prior to Day 1.  The following are acceptable IGRA assays:  T-SPOT
®TB test, QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube test 
(QFT-GIT), QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test (QFT-G) or QuantiFERON®-TB Gold Plus test 
(QFT-G Plus).  Site personnel should follow the processing and analyses steps based on the assay chosen.  Ensure incubation steps are followed as appropriate.  Documentation of IGRA product used and the test result must be in the participants source documentation.
A Mantoux skin test is not an acceptable test in this study and an IGRA test must be 
performed.  An initial IGRA should be performed at the central laboratory so that at least one set of results will be available in the [COMPANY_007] database.  If another test is required, it may be performed locally, and a T-SPOT
®TB test (if available) would be preferred than another 
QuantiFERON®test.
Procedure for Indeterminate or Positive interferon gamma releaseassay tests at screening
!Indeterminate interferon gammas release assay: Participants with indeterminate 
IGRA results should have a different IGRA test obtained (eg, T-SPOT

Infectious disease and/or pulmonary specialist consultation
1. If the pulmonary specialist diagnoses latent TB during the screening period, the 
pulmonary specialist will recommend a treatment for latent TB aligned with the participant’s best interest and local standard of care.  The local incidence of multidrug resistant TB should be considered in determining how the participant is treated. Once the infectious disease and/or pulmonary specialist report has been obtained, the following must occur:
!Report is translated into English and the local incidence rate of multi-drug 
resistant TB in the participant’s home area must be provided to the sponsor for review. 
!If INH and vitamin B6 therapy are considered by [CONTACT_819390]/or 
pulmonary specialist to be adequate treatment for latent TB for the prospective participant, the participant must agree to continue therapy during the study to complete the course of treatment for latent TB.  If the participant agrees with this plan and the site monitors for compliance with this regimen on study, the participant may be eligible for randomization if they meet all other inclusion requirements and none of the exclusion criteria.  The prospective participant agreement to take INH and B6 during the study and confirmation the site will track the subject’s compliance appropriately should also be provided to the Sponsor.
!Following review of specialist report, incidence of multidrug resistant TB and participants acceptance of required treatment for latent TB, the participant may be eligible for the study if all other eligibility criteria are met.  The only therapy acceptable for on-study treatment of latent TB is a 9-month course of INH plus vitamin B6.

!The consultant’s report is translated into English and the local incidence rate of 
multi-drug resistant TB in the participant’s home area must be provided to the sponsor for review. 
!If the participant has begun treatment for latent TB with therapy other than INH and B6, the consultant and participant must agree that changing to INH and B6 is in the participant’s best interest.  The only therapy acceptable for on-study treatment of latent TB is the equivalent of a 9-month course of INH plus vitamin B6. Adjustment of the treatment period or acceptance of treatments other than INH and B6 prior to screening should be discussed with [COMPANY_007] Clinical and may take into account the duration and type of therapy that has been documented prior to screening.
!If the participant agrees with this treatment plan and the site monitors for 
compliance with this regimen on study, the participant may be eligible for randomization if they meet all other inclusion requirements and none of the exclusion criteria.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Additional Measures for Tuberculosis (TB)Monitoring
In addition to the tuberculosis (TB) screening already in place, additional testing for TB has 
been added at the Week 24 visit and at the Week 56 visit/end of study visit (and if applicable, at participant withdrawal/early withdrawal visit) to monitor for new cases of TB during the course of the study.  The following measures have been included in this protocol to ensure the continued safety of participants and to further mitigate the risk of Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis infection:
!Participants should be carefully monitored throughout the study for signs and symptoms of TB, such as chest pain, difficulty breathing, wheezing, fever, cough, excessive sweating (especially at night), lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, new fatigue, anorexia or new unplanned weight loss.  Participants with these symptoms should be carefully evaluated to determine if these symptoms are due to SLE, TB, or other unrelated cause.

!Participants who have an IGRA test result at Week 24 or Week 56 that is indeterminate should be seen by [CONTACT_819375]/or pulmonary specialist who should determine whether the risk of TB infection is low (ie, it would be acceptable for the participant to remain in the study and continue immunosuppressant treatment without additional action).  A report from the infectious disease and/or pulmonary specialist should be available in the source document.  If the specialist determines that the risk of TB infection is low, the participant may remain in the study as per the Schedule of Activities.  If the 
consultant determines that the risk of TB infection is not low, the recommendations of the consultant to determine whether active or latent TB infection is present should be followed and the final determination of the participants status and results of any other diagnostic testing reported to the Sponsor.
!Positive interferon gamma release assay : At both Week [ADDRESS_1134804] (eg, T-SPOT

These participants should have study drug dosing interrupted immediately until details have been discussed with the sponsor and it has been determined whether the participanthas active or latent TB. Evaluations should include, and may not be limited to:
!Participant information to include at a minimum the following: 
!Close contact [CONTACT_819391] (home, work, school, etc).
!Work at a job that has an increased risk of acquiring TB (for example a 
healthcare or nursing home worker).
!Physical examination.
!Check for symptoms (fever, cough, weight loss).

In areas of high background TB prevalence, it is recommended that the evaluation be repeated following corticosteroid taper.
8.2.7. Monitoring for Infections
Participants will be monitored for development of any infection (viral, bacterial, and fungal).  
Infections will be classified as either treated or non-treated infections.  All treated infections occurring during the study require identification of the causative organism, if feasible, whether by [CONTACT_921], antigen assay, serology, etc. (as appropriate) and the results (eg, any identified organisms or absence of growth) recorded in the CRF.
Treated infections are infections that:
!Require antimicrobial therapy by [CONTACT_110454]; 
!Require any surgical intervention (eg, incision and drainage).
Treated infections will be further classified as serious or non-serious.  Serious infections are 
treated infections that:
!Require intravenous antimicrobial therapy or; 
!Required hospi[INVESTIGATOR_685175]; 
!Meet other criteria that require the infection to be classified as a SAE.
A participant who experiences a serious infection should be discontinued from treatment.  A serious infection should be reported as a SAE and should be listed as the reason for discontinuation in the CRF.  All serious infections occurring during the study should undergo appropriate laboratory investigations, including culture, and the results (eg, any identified organisms or absence of growth) be recorded in the CRF.
For participants who experience non-serious infections that require a temporary hold on 
dosing of the study intervention during the study see Section 6.1.1.  Consultation with the 
sponsor is available.

8.2.8. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments
See Appendix [ADDRESS_1134807] any 
clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the CRF.  Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_19448]'s condition.
All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during 
participation in the study or within [ADDRESS_1134808] dose of study intervention should be repeated at the central lab until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_10982].
If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable by 
[CONTACT_093], the etiology should be identified and the sponsor notified.
All protocol-required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix [ADDRESS_1134809] be conducted 
in accordance with the laboratory manual and the Schedule of Activities.
If laboratory values from non-protocol-specified laboratory assessments performed at the 
institution’s local laboratory require a change in participant management or are considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_093] (eg, SAE or AE or dose modification), then the results must be recorded in the CRF.
8.2.9. SerumCreatinine, SerumCystatin C and Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate 
(eGFR)
Serum creatinine will be measured as part of serum chemistry at times specified in the 
Schedule of Activities section of the protocol.  Creatinine elevations above the upper limit of 
normal (ULN) will be followed until resolution or return to baseline values.  Serum 
creatinine based eGFR will be calculated.  Serum cystatin C will be measured and cystatin C 
based eGFR will be calculated at corresponding times per Schedule of Activities . 
The eGFR will be calculated using the 2 sets of equations developed by [CONTACT_345276][INVESTIGATOR_10444] (CKD-EPI), which utilize serum creatinine (SCr) and serum cystatin C (S Cystatin C) respectively (see Appendix 22 ). 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Pregnancy tests will also be done whenever 1 menstrual cycle is missed during the active treatment period (or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected) and at the end of the study.  Pregnancy tests may also be repeated if requested by [CONTACT_110453] (IRBs)/ethics committees (ECs) or if required by [CONTACT_427].  If a urine test cannot be confirmed as negative (eg, an ambiguous result), a serum pregnancy test is required.  In such cases, the participant must be excluded if the serum pregnancy result is positive.
8.3. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
The definitions of an AE and an SAE can be found in Appendix 3 . 
AEs will be reported by [CONTACT_2299] (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or 
the participant's legally authorized representative).
The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible to pursue and obtain adequate information both to determine the outcome and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE or that caused the participant to discontinue the study (see Section 7 ).
In addition, the investigator may be requested by [CONTACT_22835]-up information in an expedited fashion.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

8.3.2. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information
The time period for actively eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection 
period”) for each participant begins from the time the participant provides informed consent, which is obtained before the participant’s participation in the study (ie, before undergoing any study-related procedure and/or receiving study intervention), through and including a minimum of [ADDRESS_1134812] SAE Report Form.
Follow-up by [CONTACT_74095] a level acceptable to the investigator.
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs after conclusion of the study 
participation.  However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, the investigator must promptly report the SAE to [COMPANY_007] using the CT SAE Report Form.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting SAEs to [COMPANY_007] Safety
All SAEs occurring in a participant during the active collection period are reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety on the CT SAE Report Form immediately and under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 3 .  The investigator will submit any updated SAE 
data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available.
SAEs occurring in a participant after the active collection period has ended are reported to 
[COMPANY_007] Safety if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the 
investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to study intervention must be reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

8.3.3. Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3 .
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs.  Open-ended and nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrences.
8.3.4. Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts.  For each event, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow-up (as defined in Section 7.3 ).
In general, follow-up information will include a description of the event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality.  Any information relevant to the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses, must be provided.  In the case of a participant death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to [COMPANY_007] Safety. 
Further information on follow-up procedures is given in Appendix 3 .
8.3.5. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs
Prompt notification by [CONTACT_364957].
The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation.  The sponsor will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements relating to safety 
reporting to the regulatory authority, institutional review boards (IRBs)/ethics committees 
(ECs), and investigators.
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse

specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the investigator’s brochure and will notify the IRB/EC, if appropriate according to local requirements.
8.3.6. Exposure During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and Occupational Exposure
Exposure to the study intervention under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding and 
occupational exposure are reportable to [COMPANY_007] Safety within 24 hours of investigator awareness.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Pregnancy
Details of all pregnancies in female participants and, if indicated, female partners of male 
participants will be collected after the start of study intervention and until [ADDRESS_1134814] dose.
If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform the sponsor within 24 hours of 
learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 4 .
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Breastfeeding
Scenarios of exposure during breastfeeding must be reported, irrespective of the presence of 
an associated SAE, to [COMPANY_007] Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form.  An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a [COMPANY_007] drug specifically approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in accord with authorized use.  However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with sucha drug’s administration, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_4693], which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an AE.
An occupational exposure is reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form, regardless of whether there is an associated SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a participant enrolled in the study, the 
information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy of the completed CT SAE Report 
Form is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.3.7. Cardiovascular and Death Events
Cardiovascular events will be reviewed as part of the regular safety review by [CONTACT_75342] (see 
Section 9.5.1 ).090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Not Applicable.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Lack of Efficacy
“Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se will not be reported 
as an AE or SAE.  Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as an AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE.
8.3.9. Medication Errors
Medication errors may result from the administration or consumption of the study 
intervention by [CONTACT_19995], or at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength. 
Exposures to the study intervention under study may occur in clinical trial settings, such as 
medication errors.
Safety Event Recorded on the CRF Reported on the CT SAE Report

associated with an AE)Only if associated with an SAE
Medication errors include:
!Medication errors involving participant exposure to the study intervention;
!Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do or do not involve the study participant.
Such medication errors occurring to a study participant are to be captured on the medication error page of the CRF, which is a specific version of the AE page.
In the event of a medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified immediately.Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by [CONTACT_1149], as determined by [CONTACT_1275], the medication error is recorded on the medication error page of the CRF and, if applicable, any associated AE(s), serious and nonserious, are recorded on an AE page of the CRF.

Page 1518.4. Treatment of Overdose
For this study, any dose of study intervention greater than that prescribed for the participant 
within a 24-hour time period will be considered an overdose.
Sponsor does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose.  In the event of an overdose, the investigator/treating physician should:
1. Contact [CONTACT_22840] 24 hours.2. Closely monitor the participant for any AEs/SAEs and laboratory abnormalities until 
study intervention can no longer be detected systemically (at least 10 days).
3. Obtain a blood sample for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis within [ADDRESS_1134817] dose of study intervention if requested by [CONTACT_7195] (determined 
on a case-by-case basis).
4. Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdose in 
the CRF.
5. Overdose is reportable to Safety only when associated with an SAE.
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by [CONTACT_340749].

9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study 
is outlined here and further detailed in a statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be maintained by [CONTACT_456].  The SAP may modify what is outlined in the protocol where appropriate; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definitions or their analyses will also be reflected in a protocol amendment.
9.1. Estimands and Statistical Hypotheses
9.1.1. EstimandsThe primary estimand for the primary endpoint of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Responder 
Index (SRI-4) response at Week 52 will be the population average treatment difference between PF-06700841 and placebo in the proportion of participants with active SLE who achieved the SRI-4 endpoint at Week 52 and did not discontinue study intervention prior to 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )CCI
CCI
PF-[ADDRESS_1134818] of participants with active SLE as defined by [CONTACT_156587]/exclusion criteria except those estimands for a subgroup of participants.  Intercurrent events for secondary binary and continuous endpoints are defined similar to those events for the primary endpoint. For each binary endpoint, the main estimand is similarly defined as a composite estimand and any participant who experienced the specified intercurrent events will be considered as a non--responder; for each continuous endpoint the main estimand will be a hypothetical estimand and only data collected prior to the occurrence of intercurrent events will be included for analyses. Treatment policy estimand may be defined in the SAP for selected secondary endpoints. 
Participants who had data missing due to COVID-[ADDRESS_1134819] at Week 52 
visit will be removed from analysis for that visit (eg, not included into numerator and denominator in the calculation of proportion of responders at the visit where the data are missing due to COVID-[ADDRESS_1134820]). 
9.1.2. Hypotheses and Decision Rules
Each of the 3 dose groups of the PF-06700841 will be compared with the placebo group for 
both the primary endpoint of SRI-4 response at Week 52 and the key secondary endpoint of the BICLA response at Week 52 in 6 hypotheses.  Two families (FA and FB) of hypotheses are formed from these 6 hypotheses (Table 4).  In order to control the overall family-wise type-I error rate, a sequentially rejective closed testing procedure is defined.  The family FA 
serves as the gatekeeper before testing hypotheses in the family FB.  The hypotheses in the 
family FB will not be formally tested unless all null hypotheses in the family FA are rejected.  Additional details, including any future changes regarding the multiplicity control of the primary and key secondary endpoints at the overall family-wise type-I error rate of one-sided 0.025, will be handled within the SAP.

Efficacy data will be listed, tabulated and summarized graphically, as appropriate.  Model assumptions will be tested using appropriate statistical or graphical techniques.   
If statistical hypothesis testing is performed, tests will be conducted at the % =0.025 
(one-sided) level.  Analysis results will include the estimated effect and 95% confidence 
intervals.  
The primary population of interest for efficacy analysis is the Full Analysis Set (FAS) which 
will include all randomized participants who have received at least 1 dose of study intervention.  Additional analysis populations may be defined in the SAP.
The final analyses will be performed when all participants complete Week 52.  Further details of analyses in efficacy will be specified in the statistical analysis plan. 9.4.2. Analysis of the Primary Endpoint
The primary endpoint is the proportion of SRI-4 responders at Week 52 and the primary 
analysis of this endpoint will be based on the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) approach 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )CCI

the p-values for pairwise treatment between each dose group of PF-06700841 and the placebo group.  Treatment difference in the proportion of responders for the active treatment groups compared to the placebo will be estimated based on the CMH approach.  These estimates will be reported with 95% confidence intervals and one-sided p-values. A supplementary analysis using a generalized linear marginal model for repeated measures (GLMMRM) will be performed for the longitudinal SRI-4 endpoint data. This model will include treatment, visit, treatment by [CONTACT_263847].  A common AR(1) variance-covariance matrix for all treatment groups will be used to model the variability among longitudinal observations within a participant.  If there are any concerns with model convergence, covariance structures of co mpound symmetry w ill be attempted. Unlike the 
non-responder imputation for missing data in the primary analysis, missing at random is assumed for missing data in the GLMMRM analysis. Details will be provided in the SAP.  
 
9.4.3. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
[IP_ADDRESS]. Analysis of Key Secondary EndpointThe key secondary endpoint is the proportion of BICLA responders at Week 52 and the 
primary analysis of this endpoint will be conducted in the manner described above for the primary endpoint using the CMH approach adjusting for stratification factors.  The hypothesis testing of this endpoint will be based on the p-values for pairwise treatment comparisons between each dose group of PF-06700841 and the placebo group.  Treatment difference in the proportion of responders for the active treatment compared to the placebo will be estimated based on the CMH approach.  These estimates will be reported with 95% confidence intervals and one-sided p-values.

[COMPANY_007] provides researchers secure access to participant-level data or full CSRs for the 
purposes of “bona-fide scientific research” that contribute to the scientific understanding of the disease, target, or compound class.  [COMPANY_007] will make available data from these trials [ADDRESS_1134831], including individuals requesting access for commercial/competitive or legal purposes.
10.1.6. Data Quality Assurance
All participant data relating to the study will be recorded on printed or electronic CRF unless 
transmitted to the sponsor or designee electronically (eg, laboratory data).  The investigator is responsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by [CONTACT_18027].090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )
PF-[ADDRESS_1134832] maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the 
information entered in the CRF.
The investigator must ensure that the CRFs are securely stored at the study site in [encrypted 
electronic and/or paper] form and are [password protected or secured in a locked room] to prevent access by [CONTACT_20011].
The investigator must permit study-related monitoring, audits, IRB/EC review, and 
regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents.  This verification may also occur after study completion.  It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.
Monitoring details describing strategy (eg, risk-based initiatives in operations and quality 
such as risk management and mitigation strategies and analytical risk-based monitoring), methods, responsibilities, and requirements, including handling of noncompliance issues and monitoring techniques (central, remote, or on-site monitoring), are provided in the [monitoring plan] [contracts].
The sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this study, including 
quality checking of the data.
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered 
into the CRF by [CONTACT_1191], complete, and verifiable from source documents; that the safety and rights of participants are being protected; and that the study is being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other study agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements.

agents with an opportunity to review and comment on responses to any such findings.
10.1.7. Source Documents
Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the participant and substantiate the 
integrity of the data collected.  Source documents are filed at the investigator site.
Data reported on the CRF or entered in the electronic CRF (eCRF) that are transcribed from 
source documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained.  The investigator may need to request previous medical records or transfer records, depending on the study.  Also, current medical records must be available.
Definition of what constitutes source data can be found in the study completion guidelines. 10.1.8. Study and Site Closure
The sponsor designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any 
time for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor. Study sites will be closed upon study completion.  A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected and a study-site closure visit has been performed.
The investigator may initiate study-site closure at any time upon notification to the contract 
research organization (CRO) if requested to do so by [CONTACT_22846]/EC or if such termination is required to protect the health of study participants.
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by [CONTACT_19711]:
!Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/EC or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines;
!Inadequate recruitment of participants by [CONTACT_093];
Discontinuation of further study intervention development. Study termination is also provided for in the clinical study agreement.  If there is any conflict between the contract and this protocol, the contract will control as to termination rights.
10.1.9. Publication Policy
The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings by [CONTACT_22847] 1 year after end of the study (or study termination), whichever comes first. 
The investigator agrees to refer to the primary publication in any subsequent publications 
such as secondary manuscripts, and submits all manuscripts or abstracts to the sponsor [ADDRESS_1134834], remove any previously undisclosed confidential information before disclosure, except for any study or [COMPANY_007] 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Page [ZIP_CODE].3. Appendix 3: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow-up, and Reporting
10.3.1. Definition of AE
AE Definition
!An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, 
temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention.
NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of study intervention.
Events Meetingthe AE Definition
!Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital sign measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (ie, not related to progression of underlying disease).
!Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
!New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study.
!Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction.
!Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention or a concomitant medication.  Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self-harming intent.  Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae.
!“Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE.  Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments.  However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as an AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Page 174Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition
!Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_19448]’s condition.
!The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s condition.
!Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that 
leads to the procedure is the AE.
!Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).
!Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.
10.3.2. Definition of SAE
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious 
conditions are met (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1080]/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to progression of disease).
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:
a. Results in death
b. Is life-threatening
The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.
c. Requires inpatienthospi[INVESTIGATOR_22770], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19949] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting.  Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084].  If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a preexisting condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Page 175d. Results in persistent disability/incapacity
!The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.
!This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
f. Other situations:
!Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22772].  These events should usually be considered serious.
!Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
10.3.3. Recording/Reporting and Follow-up of AEs and/or SAEs
AE and SAE Recording/Reporting
The table below summarizes the requirements for recording adverse events on the CRF and for reporting serious adverse events on the Clinical Trial (CT) Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form to [COMPANY_007] Safety.  These requirements are delineated for 3 types of events: (1) SAEs; (2) nonserious adverse events (AEs); and (3) exposure to the study intervention under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and occupational exposure. 
It should be noted that the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information is not 
the same as the AE page of the CRF.  When the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  AEs should be recorded using concise medical terminology and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

reports) related to the event.
!The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF.
!It isnotacceptable for the investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s

!The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information.  Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.
Assessment of Intensity
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the study and assign it to 1 of the following categories: 
!Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_2299], causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities.
!Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal everyday activities.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Page 177!Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities.  An AE that is assessed 
as severe should not be confused with an SAE.  Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.
!An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.
Assessment of Causality
!The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention and each occurrence of each AE/SAE.
!A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out.
!The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.
!Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention administration will be considered and investigated.
!The investigator will also consult the investigator’s brochure (IB) and/or product information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.
!For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she 
has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.
!There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to the sponsor.  However, it is 
very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to the sponsor.
!The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242]-up information and send an SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment.
!The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements.
!If the investigator does not know whether or not the study intervention caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to study intervention” for reporting purposes, as defined by [CONTACT_456].  In addition, if the investigator determines thatan SAE is associated with study procedures, the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, and report such an 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
!The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_22854]/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible.  This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other healthcare professionals.
!If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized 
follow-up period, the investigator will provide [COMPANY_007] Safety with a copy of any 
postmortem findings including histopathology.

SAE Reporting to [COMPANY_007] Safety via an Electronic Data Collection Tool
!The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to [COMPANY_007] Safety will be the electronic

10.4.1. Male ParticipantsNo contraception methods are required for male participants in this study, as the calculated 
safety margin is ≥ 100-fold between the estimated maternal exposure due to seminal transfer 
and the NOAEL for serious manifestations of developmental toxicity in nonclinical studies.
10.4.2. Female Participant Reproductive Inclusion Criteria
A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or breastfeeding, and at 
least 1 of the following conditions applies:
!Is not a WOCBP (see definitions below in Section 10.4.3).
OR
!Is a WOCBP and using a contraceptive method that is highly effective (with a failure 
rate of <1% per year), as described below during the intervention period and for at least [ADDRESS_1134842] dose of study intervention, which corresponds to the time needed to eliminate any study intervention(s).  The investigator should evaluate the effectiveness of the contraceptive method in relationship to the first dose of study intervention. 
The investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history, and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with an early undetected pregnancy. 
10.4.3. Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal 
unless permanently sterile (see below).
If fertility is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot 
be confirmed before the first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should be considered.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP:
1. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:

Note: Documentation for any of the above categories can come from the site personnel’s 
review of the participant’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  The method of documentation should be recorded in the participant’s medical record for the study.
2. Postmenopausal female:
!A postmenopausal state is defined as age 60 years or older or no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause.
!A high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormone replacement therapy (HRT). 
!Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the nonestrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.

This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.  The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy).
Follow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify [COMPANY_007] Safety of the outcome as a follow-up to the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should be assessed by [CONTACT_4692] (unless preprocedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a live-born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety as SAEs 
follows: 
!Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;
!Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_1134844] to causality, as SAEs.  In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly related to exposure to the study intervention. 
Additional information regarding the EDP may be requested by [CONTACT_456].  Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis (eg, follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays).  In the case of paternal exposure, the investigator will provide the participant with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to deliver to his partner.  The investigator must document in the source documents that the participant was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his partner.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury
Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury (as determined by [CONTACT_20023]) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury, but adapt are termed “adaptors.”  In some participants, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a more serious potential outcome.  These participants fail to adapt and therefore are "susceptible" to progressive and serious liver injury, commonly referred to as drug-induced liver injury (DILI).  Participants who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 times the upper limit of normal (
×ULN) should be monitored more frequently to determine if they are 
an “adaptor” or are “susceptible.”
In the majority of DILI cases, elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) precede total bilirubin (TBili) elevations (>2 ×ULN) by [CONTACT_74097].  The increase in TBili typi[INVESTIGATOR_161651]/ALT is/are still elevated above 3 
×ULN (ie, AST/ALT and TBili values will be elevated within the same laboratory 
sample).  In rare instances, by [CONTACT_22858], AST/ALT values might have decreased.  This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI.  Therefore, abnormal elevations in either AST OR ALT in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy’s law criteria) cases and should always be considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury have been excluded.
The threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the 
participant’s individual baseline values and underlying conditions.  Participants who present with the following laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases to definitively determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values:
!Participants with AST/ALT and TBili baseline values within the normal range who subsequently present with AST OR ALT values >3 
×ULN AND a TBili value 
>2 × ULN with no evidence of hemolysis and an alkaline phosphatase value <2
×ULN or not available.
!For participants with baseline AST OR ALT ORTBili values above the ULN, the 
following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline:
!Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT 
values >2 times the baseline values AND >3 
×ULN; or >8 ×ULN (whichever is 
smaller).
!Preexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from baseline value by [CONTACT_8895] 1 × ULN orif the value reaches 
>3 × ULN (whichever is smaller).090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )
PF-[ADDRESS_1134845]/ALT and TBili separated by [CONTACT_726] a few weeks should be assessed 
individually based on clinical judgment; any case where uncertainty remains as to whether it represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor.  
The participant should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferably within [ADDRESS_1134846] and ALT and TBili for suspected cases of 
Hy’s law, additional laboratory tests should include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), total bile acids, and alkaline phosphatase.  Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology.  A detailed history, including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (either by [CONTACT_20025] a coformulated product in prescription or over-the-counter medications), recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family history, sexual history, travel history, history of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, surgery, blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) and collection of serum sample for acetaminophen drug and/or protein adduct levels may be warranted. 
All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria of AST/ALT and 
TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases if no other reason for the liver function test (LFT) abnormalities has yet been found.  Such 
potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availability of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT abnormalities.
A potential DILI (Hy’s law) case becomes a confirmed case only after all results of 
reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternative etiology.090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

These guidelines for participant safety monitoring and discontinuation are to be applied to all 
participants in study B7931028.  Additional individual participant monitoring is at the discretion of the investigator and dependent on any perceived safety concerns.  Unscheduled clinical labs may be obtained at any time during the study to assess such concerns, and a participant may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator.  If it is not possible for a participant to return to a site for a repeat labs prior to the next scheduled visit, the investigator should note this in the source document. For participants who have a history of known intermittent out of range laboratory assessments, repeat assessments between scheduled visits may be waived by [CONTACT_819408].
10.17.1. Safety Monitoring
! The following laboratory abnormalities require re-testing within 1 week:
!Neutrophil counts <1000 neutrophils/mm
3;
!Lymphocyte counts <500 lymphocytes/mm3;
!Platelet counts <50,000 platelets/mm3;
!eGFR that is 40% or greater reduction from baseline,
!UPCR >3 mg/mg
!Any single AST and/or ALT elevation ≥3 times the upper limit of normal (repeat 
laboratory testing should include albumin, creatine kinase, total bilirubin, direct and 
indirect bilirubin, GGT, PT [prothrombin time] with INR [international normalized ratio], and alkaline phosphatase), regardless of the total bilirubin.  (Please note that [ADDRESS_1134891] need confirmation on separate blood draw before undertaking thorough evaluation for liver injury);
!Any single hemoglobin value <8.0 g/dL or one that drops 2 gm/dL below baseline;
!For women of child-bearing potential with any positive urine beta-human chorionic 
gonadotrophin ( ∀-hCG) test, the participant will have study drug interrupted and a 
serum sample submitted to the central laboratory for ∀-hCG testing.
10.17.2. Permanent Discontinuation of Study Intervention
The sponsor’s Clinical team should be consulted as soon as possible and participants may be 
discontinued from study intervention if any of the following occur during the study.  All participants who are randomized should be encouraged to remain in the study through to the end of the double-blind period for safety and efficacy assessments, whether or not they continue to receive study intervention for the full 52 week treatment period, to reduce 090177e1a05d6b35\A pproved\A pproved On: 22-A pr-2024 15:21 (GMT )

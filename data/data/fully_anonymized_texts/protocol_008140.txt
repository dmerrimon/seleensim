Treatment of babies with moderate to severe Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy  (HIE) with 
hypothermia results in normal outcomes in approximate ly 50% of the treated neonates  1-4. 
Cooling targ ets inflammatory and excitatory neurotransmitter -related cell injury and early death  
5-8. Animal studies indicate that  providing  human cord blood cells after hypoxic ischemic injury 
also reduce s the initial inflammatory response and enhance s production of neurotrophic 
compounds and facilitate s ongoing repair  9-12. 
Our phase I, single center, open label study of infusion of autologous cord blood cells in  infants  
treated with hypothermia for moderate to severe HIE has demonstrated that infusion of cells in 
the first [ADDRESS_286842] blood  cells as compared with placebo  in neonates with HIE 
undergoing hypothermia treatment. Efficacy will be measured by [CONTACT_237034] > 85.

for 72 hours; however, in the four whole -body hypothermia studies, 44 – 51% of infants died or 
survived with disabilities , 24 - 38% of babies with HIE and were cooled died, and 13 – 28% of 
the survivor s were later diagnosed with cerebral palsy.  While cooling is helpful, the results of 
these trials provide strong incentive for development of adjunct therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Investigators are now 
testing multiple interventions, including inhaled xenon  and erythropoieti n, in pre -clinical and 
phase I and now phase I II clinical trials  14. Cell-based interventions have also show n promise 15.   
5.1.   ANIMAL STUDIES  
The fir st study of  human cord blood cells infused in  a neonatal animal with a  hypoxic -ischemic  
brain  injury used the Rice-Vannuc ci model of unilateral carotid artery ligation followed by  
[CONTACT_237035]  16,17. Neonatal rats 
were infused intr aperitoneally with [ADDRESS_286844] blood nucleated cells 24 hours 
after injury.  Human cells  localized to the injured hemisphere, but did not proliferate in situ.  
Tissue injury was reduced in cell recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], and  spastic paresis was alleviated 9. Subsequently, 
another group infused cells and cells plus mannitol intraperitoneally 7 days after injury and 
found dendritic densities among cell recipi[INVESTIGATOR_237009] 75% of controls, and 80% of cont rols for 
those receiving cells plus mannitol  14 days after cell infusion . Dendritic densities for animals 
that received the vehicle solution or mannitol alone were approximately 50% of controls. These 
investigators also noted better neurobehavioral outcome s for cells and cells  plus mannitol 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], and higher brain tissue neurotrophic factor levels (BDNF, NGF, and GDNF). These 
results were obtained with a lower dose than that used in the first study (1.[ADDRESS_286845] blood nucl eated cells)  11.  
In collaboration with [CONTACT_237049] , a series of experiments in a rabbit model of intrauterine brain 
injury  were performed  18, 19, 24. In these studies , pregnant rabbits  had an intravascular catheter 
with balloon inserted  in the uterine artery at day [ADDRESS_286846] blood cells in one milliliter of 
saline, and the infusion was delivered over one minute. Animals born with a severe phenotype 
that received cells and survived the neonatal period demonstrated improvement in motor 
function, but m ortality was high er (although not statistically significantly higher)  among cell 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. In a subsequent replication study  using the same infusion volume but half the cell 
amount (2.5 x106), the mortality  was very similar  for cell recipi[INVESTIGATOR_237010] . Studies 
with MRI demonstrated very sparse presence of human cord blood cells in the days after

Our phase I  study  has enrolled 45 subjects . The initial intent  was to provide up to 4 infusions of 
2-5 x 107cells/kg each in the first [ADDRESS_286848] 48 postnatal hours ; FDA requested  the number of infusions  limited until 
there was  sufficient evidence to ensure reliable viability of unfrozen cells beyond [ADDRESS_286849] blood. If blood was collected, and the infant met cooling criteria, and the 
parents provided consent for enrollment in the phase I study, cells were volume and re d blood

were below 30 milliliters. For the majority of enrollees (after 2011), two infusions were provided

one year outcomes  25. Thirty -nine (39) infants have been cooled and received cells (16 since our 
initial report) and [ADDRESS_286851] been  cooled for HIE without receiving cells. For those receiving 
cells, median collection and infusion volumes were 33 mL and 5 mL.   None of the cell

There were no serious adverse event directly related to study therapy.  No significant infusion 
reactions were noted.  Heart rat e, mean arterial pressure, and oxygen saturation did not vary 
significantly before and after infusions for the first two infusions.  Mean oxygen saturation was 
lower after the third and fourth infusio n.  One infant, born at [ADDRESS_286853] blood ( UCB ) culture for E. coli , which was also present in the mother’s

The study population will include up to [ADDRESS_286856] blood collected and available for infusion(s) in the first  [ADDRESS_286857] Blood C ells for Hypoxic Ischemic 
Encephalopathy  (HIE)    IND [ZIP_CODE]  (BABY[CONTACT_237030])  
 
February 6, [ADDRESS_286858] meet all of the following criteria:  
 
1. Cord blood must be available for volume and red blood cell reduction before 45 hours of 
age.  Please follow local IRB rules regarding consent/assent for cord blood collection.   
2. The infant must be  able to receive at least one dose of autologous co rd blood before [ADDRESS_286859] signs of encephalopathy within 6 hours  of age utilizing the two step 
(A and B)  approach used in the Network’s Optimizing Hypothermia Study  20. 
The eligibility criteria:  
 
 Infants will be evaluated in two steps; evaluation by [CONTACT_237036] ( Step A , which is either A1 or A2, depending on available information and 
severity of blood gas abnormalities ), followed by a neurological exam ( Step B )  
 Once infant meets either A1 or A2, proceed to neuro logic examination. (See part 
B) 
 The presence of moderate/severe encephalopathy (a “2” or a “3”) defined as 
seizures OR presence of signs in 3 of 6 categories in the table below. For the 
categories with more than one item, such as PRIMITIVE REFLEXES, the item 
(SUCK, MORO) with the highest score determi nes the level of encephalopathy  
assigned for that category  
 The neurologi c examination will be performed by a physician exam iner 
 
Step s A1 and A2 . All infants will be evaluated for the following:  
1. Is the baby ≥ 36 weeks gestation ? 
2.         Is there a h istory of an acute perinatal event (abruptio placenta, cord prolapse, 
severe FHR abnormality: variable or late decelerations) ? 
3. Is the Apgar score <[ADDRESS_286860] 10 min utes? 
4. What is the c ord pH or first postnatal blood gas pH at <1 hour ? 
5. What is the b ase deficit on cord gas or first postnatal blood gas at <1 hour ?  
 
If infant meets criteria A1 or A2 and criteria B and does not meet exclusion criteria, the 
infant is  eligible and is therefore eligible for study en rollment if cells are available

7.1.2.  SCREENING AND ENROLL MENT   
Centers will screen for potential subjects among all deliveries of in fants > 35 6/7th  weeks who 
appear to be at risk for delivery of an infant with encephalopathy. From our single site 
experience, the obstetric team collected cord blood at 5 – [ADDRESS_286863] blood will be discarded  as medical waste at the study 
site (unless ar rangements are made by [CONTACT_237037]) .   
7.1.3.  RANDOMIZATION AND STRATIFICATION   
After informed consent is obtained, eligible infants will be randomized to  one of two  arms ( cells 
or placebo). Neonates randomized to receive cells  will receive up to two doses of cells (with a 
dose range of 2 -5 x 107 cells/kg per dose) , while those randomized to the placebo arm will 
receive  up to two doses of placebo .      
Randomization will be conducted using permuted block design and stratified by [CONTACT_237038]  (moderate or severe) . A central web based  randomization system available [ADDRESS_286864] Blood C ells for Hypoxic Ischemic 
Encephalopathy  (HIE)    IND [ZIP_CODE]  (BABY[CONTACT_237030])  
 
February 6, [ADDRESS_286865] follow 
local IRB rules regarding consent/assent for  cord blood collection  for autologous use . . The cord 
blood will be  collected into Pall Medical Sterile CB Collection Unit Code 791 -08 containing 35  
mL of citrate phosphate dextros e (CPD ) anticoagulant.  It is importan t to collect the maximum 
volume of cor d blood.   The cord blood unit ( CBU ) will be transported  to the processing 
laboratory where it will be red blood cell ( RBC ) and volume reduced and up to 2 study doses 
prepared.  The infusion volume will be ≤3.0 cc/kg  with an infusion time of 10-20 minutes.  A 
manual of p rocedures will be provided  for all sites  to assure consistency of processing.    
If randomized to treatment arm, c ell preparation will include volume - and RBC reduction after 
20-30 minute incubation with 6% Hespan (hetastarch, Ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_20116], Lake Forest, Illinois, [LOCATION_003] ) 
using the Sepax automated processing system (Biosafe, Geneva, Switzerland)  for units with  > 
30mL of umbilical cord blood ( UCB ).  A manual method will be used if the collected cord blood 
volume  is < 30mL using procedures in the manual of procedures . A sample of processed cord 
blood is used to determine the cell count and  decide if one or two doses are  aliquotted into 
individual dose syringes . A sample is also removed for the gram stain.  
A gram stain  from the study product and placebo will  be performed and resulted  prior to infusion  
of the study product  or placebo  to indicate sterility.  If the  gram stain is positive , then the cells  or 
placebo  will not be infused and the cord blood is discarded.    If sterility cultures, which will be 
performed on the collected cord blood  at Duke University Stem Cell Laboratory ( STCL ), 
subsequently become  positi ve, the study team will notify the clinical team of the nature of the 
positive culture and a follow up strategy  will be developed  by [CONTACT_237039] .  In 
general, babies with HIE are placed on empi[INVESTIGATOR_237016].  If the 
baby [CONTACT_237040] t he cord blood , the baby [INVESTIGATOR_53586] a course of therapy.  If, on the other 
hand, the baby [CONTACT_237041] a con taminant , a course of 
antibiotic therapy covering the organism isolated will be administered.  
8.2.  PLACEBO  
Placebo will be prepared from a small volume of unprocessed cord blood  diluted in saline .  This 
formulation will be described in a manual of procedures.  Placeb o will  have a similar appearance 
to the study product. A gram stain  from the CBU  must be performed and  resulted prior to release  
of placebo  (see section 8.1) . Only products with negative gram stain will be released for infusion.

soon as possible. Infants will be pretreated with hydrocortisone, 1 mg/kg IV [ADDRESS_286868] was not on hydrocortisone for cli nical purposes. The placebo 
group is receiving hydrocortisone to minimize the risk of infusion -related and/or allergic reaction 
to the placebo - the same risk minimization as for the active stem cell recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  Cells /placebo  
will be  infused over 10-20 min utes, followed by a saline flush  (≤ 5.0mL)  to clear the

10. OTHER TREATMENTS/TES TS/CONCURRENT MEDICA TIONS  
Anti-seizure medication and sedation ideally will not be administered prior to hypothermia or 
study  infusion s, unless clinically indicated. All medications  will be listed in concomitant  
medications in the case report forms.  
11. PRIMARY OUTCOME M EASURES  
11.1. BAYLEY SCALES OF IN FANT AND TODDLER DEV ELOPMENT - III 
The Bayley Scales of I nfant and Toddler Development -III (BSID)  [ADDRESS_286876] deviation of 15.  
All Bayley examiners for this study will be trained and certified to a criterion of 80% accuracy 
for administration and scoring. Certification will be completed via submission of  a DVD of 
administration of the Bayley -III Scales with a non -study child of the target age for the study. The 
DVD will be reviewed and the accuracy of administration and scoring will be determined by [CONTACT_237042] d examiner  within two weeks of submission of the DVD. Additional D VDs 
will be submitted by [CONTACT_237043] 80% accuracy is reached for both 
administration and scoring. Each examiner must be certified once per year. No study participants 
may be assessed by [CONTACT_237044].  
For c hildren with sensory impairments, an attempt should be made to administer Bayley items 
and a decision about validity of assessment will be made subsequently with consultation with the 
gold standard Bayley examiner. However, some children with sensory impai rment cannot be 
reliably assessed with the Bayley -III. This includes children who are: 1 ) legally  blind (< 20/200 
with glasses). 2)  Hearing impaired and have no amplification/hearing aids. If a child does have 
hearing aids, the Bayley must be completed wit h the hearing a ids in place.  If the child has 
profound hearing loss and is expected to undergo a cochlear implant, the child w ill not be able to 
be tested. 3)  Child is both vision and hearing impaired (Deaf/Blind). These children cannot be 
tested with the  Bayley. Infants not testable on BSID due to CP, blindness or deafness be assigned  
respective scores of  54, [ADDRESS_286877] Blood C ells for Hypoxic Ischemic 
Encephalopathy  (HIE)    IND [ZIP_CODE]  (BABY[CONTACT_237030])  
 
February 6, [ADDRESS_286878] be instructed to translate the 
Bayley instructions to the child verbatim and to not repeat instructions unless instructed to do so 
by [CONTACT_4921]. Language scores w ill not be derived for non -English language learners as the 
normative developmental progression of language milestones in other languages may not be 
accurately reflected on the Bayley Language Scales.  
11.2. MRI  
An MRI is routinely obtained on HIE infants between 7 – 28 postnatal days.  Ideally the MRI 
will be done optimally at 10 days of life (but with an acceptable window between 7 days and 21 
days of life as suggested by [CONTACT_941] 2014 revised guidelines for infants with HIE, to assess extent of 
injury ) 21.  Results from the standard of care MRI will recorded for the study.  
11.3. NICU DIS CHARGE    
Tracking information will be recorded at discharge, and will include phone numbers and home 
address.  All surviving infants will be followed  for one year  for the in -person assessment .  
An attempt will be made  at each site  to obtain an autopsy in c ase of death both prior to and 
following NICU discharge. Autopsy results, if available, will be included in the case report 
forms . 
11.4.  SHORT TERM/HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_237019] /STUDY ENDPOINT  
Short term outcomes will be considered secondary outcomes for the study. We will  compare 
adverse outcomes, including mortality, seizures, need for nitric oxide and need for ECMO , need 
for G -tube feeding at discharge, and discharge on anti -epi[INVESTIGATOR_72467] . This information 
will be collected in case report forms . 
11.5. LONG TERM OUTCOMES/PRIMARY OUT COME/STUDY ENDPOINT  
The Primary outcome of the study will be survival at one year with Bayley III scores in all three 
domains > 85.  
12. RISKS AND BENEFITS  
12.1. RISK AND BENEFITS OF  STU DY 
Infusion of a neonate ’s own cord blood  cells during rout ine cooling is hoped to improve survival 
and neurological outcome as compared to infants that are only cooled  and receive red blood 
cells.  Autol ogous cells should eliminate any risk of graft vs host reaction.  If cord blood  cells are 
collected and not inf used, cord  blood cells will  be cryopreserved for later autologous use for the 
subject .  Complications of cord blood infusion s could include infection, volume overload, 
hypertension, allergic or anaphylactic reactions, hyperviscosity or pulmonary edema and will be

may increase blood sugar, blood pressure and fluid retention .   
 
13. SAFETY AND ADVERSE E VENT REPORTING  
Adverse Events (AE)   Adverse events and serious adverse events parameters  are listed below. 
The parameters for events are derived from prior studies of thawed/washed cord blood cells used 
for allogeneic transplant, in combination with expected physiologic responses to therapeutic 
hypothermia, which by d efinition and inclusion criteria, will be concurrently underway when the 
study infusions are administered. The physiologic response to hypothermia leads to decreased 
heart rate during cooling (the mean Heart Rate during cooling in the NICHD NRN pi[INVESTIGATOR_237020] 109); therefore a lower level to define significant bradycardia is used (Shankaran 2005). 
Other AE/SAE definitions are taken from the NICHD Optimizing cooling trial, to account for the 
concurrent use of therapeutic hypothermia, and the AE/SAE catego ry definitions developed for 
the NICHD Pediatric Trials Network (Shankaran 2014 ;England 2016).  Definitions for each AE 
parameter are listed in MOP -01 Section 10.1. 
SAEs may include:  
 Acidosis  
 Allergic reaction/hypersensitivity  
 GI Pathology  
 Hemoglobinuria  
 Hyperglycemia  
 Hypoglycemia  
 Hypertension  
 Hypotension, and fever in the absence of neutropenia  
 Hypoxia  
 Infectious Disease  
 Polycythemia  
 Pulmonary Hypertension, within the first 24 hours  
 Sinus bradycardia  
 Sinus tachycardia  
 Dyspnea  
 Any other cardiac rhythm dist urbances,  
 Any other reported SAE, including death

13.1.1.  ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of the 
investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product.    
13.1.2.  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN TS (SAE)  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a 
life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_6929], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important 
medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6721], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes liste d in this definition.  
13.1.3.  GRADE/SEVERITY  
Grade/Severity will be performed per CTCAE guidelines.  
13.1.4.  SUSPECTED ADVERSE RE ACTION  
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the investigational product caused th e adverse event. ‘Reasonable 
possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
investigational product and the adverse event.  
13.1.5.  CA[LOCATION_003]LITY  
The Investigator will use the following question when assessing causality of an adverse 
event to the investigational product:  Is there a reasonable possibility  that the drug caused 
the event ?  An affirmative answer designates the event as a suspected adverse reaction.  
 
13.2. ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING  
All adverse events reported or observed during th e study beginning at the time of the autologous  
cord blood infusion must be recorded and maintained in the study participant’s paper files  or 
electronic case report forms . Information to be reported includes when the site became aware of 
the event, investi gator -specified assessment of severity and relationship to study therapy, 
whether there is an alternative etiology, seriousness, as well as any required treatment or 
evaluations, and outcome.  In general, investigators should report adverse events as disea ses or 
syndromes whenever possible, instead of reporting individual component symptoms, signs, 
laboratory abnormalities, and sequelae.

Severe adverse reactions (fatal  or life threatening)  that are unexpected and related  will be 
reported to the FDA by [CONTACT_237045], mail or fax , following FDA guidelines.  All non -life threatening serious , related,  
and unexpected adverse events will be reported to the FDA via a written report within 15 days of 
receipt of the information (21 CFR 312.32)  by [CONTACT_39644] .  If the principal investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_237021], then the event will not require expedited reporting 
but will be included in a summary report.   
Investigators are requested to notify the Principle Investigators at Duke University within [ADDRESS_286879] (IRB ). Copi[INVESTIGATOR_237022] -Investigators, governing authorities, ethics committees, and the 
sponsor must be submitted to Duke University for filin g. 
 
 
13.3.   UNBLINDING  
 
Safety or other clinical or legal considerations including requests from a child’s family may, on 
rare occasions, require unblinding of the infant with regard to the actual intervention received. If 
such events make it necessary , the lab staff, responsible for preparation of study product at each 
site will be able to unmask the study drug produc t given to an individual infant .  Before 
unblinding  the lab staff must contact [CONTACT_43466]’s Investigator and the overall study Principal 
Investigators prior to releasing this information, and a protocol violation form will be completed.  
 
 
13.4. INTERIM MONITORING F OR SAFETY OUTCOMES  
The intervention for this trial will be conducted during the first 48 hours of life for the study 
subjects, while th e primary outcome will be assessed at 12  (12 – 16) months of age. Thus, the 
primary focus of interim monitoring for this trial will be based on monitoring adverse events 
within [ADDRESS_286880] blood infusion. Adverse events monitored will include the foll owing, 
plus a composite (any of the listed events), on which statistical comparisons between the 
treatment groups will be based:  
 Acidosis  
 Allergic reaction/hypersensitivity  
 GI Pathology  
 Hemoglobinuria  
 Hyperglycemia

 Sinus bradycardia  
 Sinus tachycardia  
 Dyspnea  
 Any other cardiac rhythm disturbances,  
 Any other reported SAE, including death  
In ke epi[INVESTIGATOR_237023], we will use a Bayesian interim 
monitoring approach to determine whether systematic differences are emergent among the two 
treatment groups in the incidence of any of the adverse events listed above . Speci fically, after 
every [ADDRESS_286881] their final study  transfusion , we 
will calculate the posterior probability  that one group has higher incidence of any adverse events 
than another. In statistical terms, the treatment will be considered harmful (i.e., the DSMC may 
consider termination of the trial) if for a pre -specified threshold 
 , the post erior probability of 
treatment harm (in terms of the above adverse events) is greater than 
  ; in other words if the  
predictive probability
  X P |1 , where 
  denotes the relative risk favoring the trea tment 
group and X is the data available. In order to allow for a liberal safety monitoring regime to 
ensure patient safety, we propose to take
  = 80%. However, we will also present the 95% 
credible interval for
 , as well as the entire posterior distribution for 
  in a graphical fashion to 
the DSMC so that they have a full appreciation for the range of possible values of 
 . All interim 
analyses will adjust for baseline level of encephalopathy, the stratification variable for this trial, 
whenever computationally feasible.  
The choice of a prior distribution is essential and controversial in Bayesian analyses. Thus, we 
can compute the posterior probability of treatment harm and the posterior distribution of the 
associated relative risk under two sets of priors – (a) a non -informative prior that does not 
assume any substantive prior information about treatment differences in terms of the adverse 
events listed above, and (b) an inf ormative prior based on treatment differences for these adverse 
events observed in the Phase I trial. However, we realize that the standard Bayesian approach of 
running the analysis with different priors provides only a partial solution, as the results on 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_237024], especially when few data have accumulated. Instead of worrying 
about the selection of a single correct prior, we will also explore the use of a robust Bayesian 
approach which replaces a prior distribution with a class of pr iors and calculates the 
corresponding posterior probabilities for decision making26.

Encephalopathy  (HIE)    IND [ZIP_CODE]  (BABY[CONTACT_237030])  
 
February 6, [ADDRESS_286882] any 
adverse Type I error consequences that are normally the case for a conventionally designed (or, 
‘frequentist’) trial.  
 
We propose to conduct one formal i nterim analysis of the accruing primary outcome data, 
examining both efficacy and futility, at a third of primary outcome accrual for this trial, provided 
that recruitment and intervention have not been completed by [CONTACT_237046].  The analysis  for 
both efficacy and futility  will adjust for baseline level of encephalopathy, the stratification 
variable for this trial, if computationally feasible  
 
13.6.  INTERIM ESTIMATION OF  TREATMENT E FFICACY  
This interim efficacy analysis will first evaluate whether the int ervention is beneficial, 
equivalent, or harmful relative to usual care. A Bayesian logistic regression model will be fit to 
the data to obtain adjusted estimates of interim treatment efficacy, adjusting for the trial 
stratification variables.  
 
A prior dis tribution is chosen in Bayesian analyses to provide an estimate of initial beliefs 
concerning the size of the potential treatment benefit. Thus, if one hopes that the results from the 
trial will influence the treatment of future patients, the prior distrib ution should represent the 
level of skepticism that is expressed by [CONTACT_237047]. There are 
three principal types of prior we could use: (i) the uninformative, or reference prior, (ii) the 
skeptical prior and (iii) the enthu siastic prior. The uninformative prior represents a lack of 
clinical opi[INVESTIGATOR_237025], and in that sense contains no information 
about prior beliefs or other prior knowledge ( eg. a relative risk for treatment benefit set at 1.0 ). A 
skeptical prior would be that overall effect of cord blood is actually harmful in this setting (i.e., a 
relative risk set higher than 1). An enthusiastic prior would be that the treatment is beneficial, as 
in the Phase I trial (relative risk set lower  than 1).  
 
It is generally useful to present the results of Bayesian analyses under several alternative prior 
distributions, so that the impact of differing levels of prior belief on the observed data may be 
reviewed. The uninformative prior has the advant age of corresponding roughly to the classical 
frequentist approach, and so this together with the skeptical and enthusiastic priors gives a broad 
and useful overview of the implications of terminating a clinical trial27. Accordingly, we will use 
A Phase II Multi -site Stu dy of Autologous Cord Blood C ells for Hypoxic Ischemic 
Encephalopathy  (HIE)    IND [ZIP_CODE]  (BABY[CONTACT_237030])  
 
February 6, 2018                        Version 8.0  Page 26 of 31 all three prior distributions to present adjusted mean posterior relative risk (RR) estimates of 
treatment efficacy relative to survival free of cognitive impairment, along with corresponding 
95% credible intervals for the same. These priors will be set at RR = 1.1 (skeptical prior), 1.0 
(uninformative prior) and 0.625 (enthusiastic prior).  
 
The DSMC may consider proposing termination of the trial for benefit if the upper 95% credible 
limit for the mean posterior RR of treatment benefit, calculated using a skeptical prior, is less 
than 1.0. We propose to use a skeptical prior for this consideration to provide a more 
conservative basis for trial termination, and also to convince even those who strongly believed at 
the outset that the intervention will not succeed in im proving survival free of cognitive 
impairment. In addition, we note that early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_31081] a trial based on treatment benefit 
generally produces a biased and sometimes misleading estimate of the treatment effect  28, 29. 
 
13.7.  INTERIM ESTIMATION O F TREATMENT F UTILITY  
In addition to providing estimates of interim treatment efficacy, we will also conduct interim 
futility analyses for treatment efficacy. For this purpose, at each interim safety look, we will use 
the available data to calculate the posterior probabi lity of concluding that the probability of 
survival free of cognitive impairment in the cord blood group would be higher than in the 
placebo group (i.e., the mean posterior RR for treatment benefit is greater than 1.0), if the trial 
continued until [ADDRESS_286883] to prior assumptions, this probability will also be calculated and presented 
for the two other prior distributions (skeptical and uninformative).  
 
The DSMC may consider proposing termination of the trial for futility if this posterior 
probability of observing any treatment benefit, if the trial  continued to full primary outcome 
accrual, is less than 10%.  
 
14. DATA SAFETY MONITORI NG COMMITTEE  
A DSMC will be responsible for monitoring the safety o f the trial.  The DSMC will have a 
minimum of  three members including a biostatistician, a neonatologist, and an expert in cord 
blood stem cell transplant.  The DSMC members will be independent from any enrolling center 
and guided by a DSMC charter.

15.1. STUDY DESIGN  
This study  is a prospective Phase II prospective, randomized, double -blind, placebo controlled , multi -
center  trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of two infusions of autologous UCB cells or placebo 
in newborns born in distress.   
15.2. ESTIMATES  OF AVAILABLE A ND REQUIRED SAMPLE S IZE 
In our phase I study  to date, 16 of 25 ( 64%) cell recipi[INVESTIGATOR_237026] (Cognitive, Motor, and Language) > 85, and  25 of 
63 (40%) of the cooled -only infants  with known one year outcomes has  survived with all three 
Bayley III domain scores > 85. (13) We acknowledge the limitations of a one year Bayley score, 
but would note that our rate of survival with Bayley scores > 85 among cooled -only infants is 
consisten t with the previously reported Whole Body Hypothermia studies  rates of survival at 12– 
24 months without moderate or severe impairment  (1 -4).  
For the phase II study, rather basing the sample size on effect size, we would propose a Bayesian 
approach as us ed in the NRN Late Hypothermia study. Because this is phase I I where our aim is 
to detect a trend favoring cell recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], and to accumulate data that will  inform design and 
sample size calculations for  a phase III study of efficacy, we anticipate that tw o years of 
enrollment would provide approximately 120-160 infants, 60 -80 in each group.   
Control  Cell Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]  95% Confidence Interval  Power  
0.6 0.30 0.45 0.92 
0.6 0.35 0.48 0.81 
0.6 0.40 0.51 0.62 
0.6 0.45 0.54 0.38 
0.6 0.60 0.54 0.056 
 
The Bayesian analysis will permit calculation of a probability of treatment benefit. Within the 
range of an active group proportion of 0.3 to 0.45, the average 95% credible interval width 
ranges from 0.45 to 0.54 when the control group has a proportion having the primary outcome  
(death or Bayley III scores < 85)  of 0.6. If the decision rule for declaring a win is the posterior 
95% credible interval must exclude 1, then the design has power ranging from 0.92 to 0.38 with 
a Type 1 error of about 0.056.  
15.3. STAT ISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  
All statistical analyses, including interim monitoring, will be conducted using the intent to treat 
principle, unless explicitly specified otherwise for certain secondary and/or post -hoc analyses.   A 
Bayesian approach will be used for  conducting the primary analysis in this trial.  We propose to 
apply a log -binomial regression model and a neutral prior that will be centered at RR=1.[ADDRESS_286884] Blood C ells for Hypoxic Ischemic 
Encephalopathy  (HIE)    IND [ZIP_CODE]  (BABY[CONTACT_237030])  
 
February 6, [ADDRESS_286885] completed the study or the 
study is terminated early fo r efficacy, futility, or safety . In addition to using a neutral prior, final 
analyses on locked data and some interim analyses  will develop posterior distributions using 
skeptical (centered at RR = 1.1) priors and/or en thusiastic (centered at RR = 0.62 5) priors as 
well. In all analyses, MCMC methods will be used to sample from the Posterior distribution.  
All analyses will involve  estimating a Posterior distribution based on a log -binomial regression 
model with covariates and MCMC methods. In addition to estimating the treatment effect on the 
log relative risk scale, the log -binomial regression will adjust for level of encephalopat hy. For 
the intercept and the encephalopathy terms, Normal ( mean = 0, sd=100) priors will be used.  For 
the term representing the log relative risk, skeptical, neutral, and enthusiastic priors will be used 
to estimate posterior distributions for the relati ve risk . 
With respect to the primary efficacy endpoint, the estimated Posterior distribution of relative risk 
based on the data and the neutral prior will be used to determine posterior probabilities of >0, 
>10 and >20% decrease in death or moderate/severe  disability, as well as graphical displays of 
the Posterior distribution and appropriate 95% credible intervals for the relative risk.  In addition 
to adjusting for level of encephalopathy and center in the log -binomial model, the final analysis 
of efficac y will also perform sensitivity analyses concerning possible treatment effect 
confounders present at randomization.  All additional covariates added to the model will utilize 
Normal  (mean=0, sd=100) priors.  
The lack of preexisting data suggests that the ne utral prior distribution may be most appropriate 
for presentation of final results; however, generation of final results using the skeptical (RR of 
1.10) and enthusiastic priors (RR of 0.625) will also be produced to give a broad overview of the 
implicatio ns of the trial’s efficacy results.  
In addition to the analyses specified above, we will also conduct equivalent frequentist analyses 
using robust Poisson regression to obtain relative risk estimates of the treatment effect adjusted 
for level of encephalop athy at baseline. Moreover, we will also conduct secondary analyses 
stratified by [CONTACT_237048].

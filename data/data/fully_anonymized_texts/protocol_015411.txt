Synopsis: SARC024 
 
Primary Objective  
 Cohort A (liposarcoma):  To compare the progression- free survival (PFS) of eligible subjects 
treated with regorafenib or placebo according to modified RECIST version 1.1.  Cohort B (osteogenic sarcoma):  To compare the progression- free survival (PFS) of eligible 
subjects treated w ith regorafenib or placebo according to RECIST version 1.1. 
 Cohort C (Ewing /Ewing -like sarcoma) : To estimate the RECIST 1.1 PFS rate of eligible 
subjects treated with regorafenib at 8 and 16 weeks . 
 Cohort D (Rhabdomyosarcoma: Fusion -positive alveolar, Embryonal, Fusion-negative 
alveolar): To estimate the RECIST 1.1 PFS rate of eligible subjects treated with regorafenib at 8 and 16 weeks.  Cohort E ( Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma ): To estimate the RECIST 1.1 PFS rate of eligible 
subjects treated with regorafenib at 24 weeks.  
 
Secondary Objectives  
 
1. All cohorts: Calculate the incidence of reported CTCAE v 4.[ADDRESS_427036] results  
2. All cohorts: Estimate the overall response rate (ORR) per RECIST version 1.1, time to tumor progression (TTP), PFS at 8 and 16 weeks, overall survival (OS), disease–specific survival (DSS)   
3. Cohorts A &  B, after crossover: Assess PFS, RR, TTP, OS, and DSS following 
administration of regorafenib in the open label portion of the study.  
 
Exploratory endpoints 
 
1. Assess PFS and RR in these populations by [CONTACT_273898]  
2. Growth modulation index for treatment with regorafenib vs . prior line of therapy, defined 
as TTP
regorafenib /TTP prior. 
 
Hypothesis and Rationale 
 Inhibition of angiogenesis to slow or stop cancer growth is one mechanism under scrutiny as a therapeutic option for patients with metastatic cancers of all types. Some of the agents used to examine this issue in Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcomas ( STBS ) are multitargeted Small Molecule 
Confidential  Page xi   Final Version 6.1 02DEC 2019

 Oral Kinase Inhibitors (SMOKIs). Imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib have all been approved 
for use in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), one of the, if not the, most common form of sarcoma.  
 After failure of standard cytotoxic chemotherapy, pazopanib was approved for us e in patients 
with metastatic non -GIST metastatic soft tissue sarcomas other than liposarcoma by [CONTACT_57216] a 
phase III clinical trial in patients with metastatic soft tissue sarcoma
1. Conversely, t here are no 
randomized data to date regarding the activity of SMOKIs in bone sarcomas specifically, and although there are no randomized data regarding the activity of pazopanib in liposarcomas, there appears to be limited activity of SMOKIs based on the phase II study of pazopanib in soft tissue sarcomas
2. 
 Sorafenib, another multitargeted small molecule oral kinase inhibitor (SMOKI), demonstrated activity in a multi- arm phase II study, in which liposarcoma was also excluded. Small studies of 
sunitinib and anecdotes have shown at least minor activity in sarcomas
3-6. In a phase II clinical 
trial of sorafenib in [ADDRESS_427037] partial response (S. Attia, DO, personal communication).  
 Although regorafenib was approved for use in patients who had progressive GIST despi[INVESTIGATOR_344190]/or sunitinib on the basis of phase II and phase III data
8,9, it has not been examined 
in a systematic fashion in patients with oth er forms of sarcoma.  
 
Given the activity of sorafenib, sunitinib and pazopanib in soft tissue sarcomas, and evidence of 
activity of sorafenib in osteogenic sarcoma and possibly Ewing/Ewing -like sarcoma, there is 
precedent to examine SMOKIs such as regorafenib in sarcomas other than GIST. It is also 
recognized that SMOKIs such as regorafenib, sorafenib, pazopanib, and sunitinib have 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_344191]. While not equivalent, most of 
these SMOKIs block vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet derived growth factors 
receptors (VEGFRs and PDGFRs), speaking to a common mechanism of action of several of 
these agents10. 
 Since the protocol was developed, preclinical data from the laboratory of Raffaella Sordella at Cold Spring Harbor Laborator y indicate responsiveness to SMOKIs of mesenchymal 
chondrosarcoma primary tissue culture and of xenografted tumor to mice, with tumor shrinking seen of established tumors grown subcutaneously (unpublished results). As a result, this rare sarcoma subtype, t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_344192]1 -NCOA2  fusion, may be susceptible to imatinib, 
sorafenib, or regorafenib; studies with the agent are underway to confirm initial data are 
underway as of late 2019. 
 We therefore propose parallel randomized phase II studies of regorafenib in patients with liposarcoma and osteogenic sarcoma to determine if there is significant activity of these agents, as has been observed with pazopanib in soft tissue sarcomas. In addition, we seek to determine the activity of regorafenib in Ewi ng/Ewing -like sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma , and mesenchymal 
chondrosarcoma , given anecdotal data of activity (or of promising preclinical data) , planning to 
Confidential Page xii  Final Version 6.1 02DEC2019 
Copyright © SARC (Sarcoma Alliance for Research thr ough Collaboration) 
 examine individual cohorts of patients in a prospective phase II trial . We further note that since 
median time to progression with an active agent in advanced Ewing/Ewing -like sarcoma was 
only 1.[ADDRESS_427038] parallel clinical trials of regorafenib in five  different metastatic/local-
regionally recurrent STBS populations: (A) liposarcoma (pure well -differentiated liposarcoma is 
excluded); (B) osteogenic sarcoma; (C) Ewing/Ewing- like sarcoma; (D) fusion-positive alveolar 
rhabdomyosarcoma, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma and fusion negative alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma; and (E) mesenchymal chondrosarcoma.  For cohorts A and B, we will conduct parallel randomized phase II studies. Patients will be randomized 1:1 between regorafenib and placebo, and followed for disease progression. For those patients with progression of disease on placebo, crossover to active drug will be offered to patients if they remain eligible for the clinical trial in all other respects.   Patients will be further stratified by [CONTACT_344218] (1 vs 2 or more), as well as WHO performance status (0 -1 vs 2).  
 Since PFS with active therapy was very short in advanced Ewing/Ewing -like sarcoma using an 
IGF1R inhibitor, for example, a single cohort phase II clinical design will be used for cohort C to obtain initial clinical experience with this very aggressive sarcoma subtype.   For cohorts D & E , we will conduct single cohort phase II clinical design s to obtain initial 
clinical  experience with these sarcoma subtypes in patients at least 5 years of age. 
 Maximum Total Number of Subjects

 2. BACKGROUND 
 
2.1 Soft tissue and bone sarcomas (STBS)  Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcoma (STBS) are malignant tumors of mesenchymal origin. Approximately 14,000 cases are diagnosed annually in the US, accounting for less than 1% of malignancies diagnosed
12. Surgery, with or without adjuvant radiation therapy is the mainstay 
of treatment for early stage soft tissue sarcoma13; chemotherapy is routinely used in the 
adjuvant setting for osteosarcomas and Ewing/Ewing -like sarcomas of bone. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_344193], between 30-60% of patients develop recurrent and/or metastatic disease. Although preoperative chemotherapy may improve resectability of advanced STBS, the use of chemotherapy after resection of metastatic STBS has not been shown to improve overall 
survival
13. 
 Complete responses to chemotherapy for recurrent or metastatic sarcomas are rare and do not seem to translate into improved survival. Most tumors develop rapid drug resistance and patients develop progressive disease within months. The median survival time from diagnosis for patients with metastatic disease is [ADDRESS_427046] patients with advanced and/or metastatic sarcoma, palliation is the main objective of treatment.  Given the toxicity and lack of efficacy of chemotherapy, typi[INVESTIGATOR_344194], ifosfamide, dacarbazine and other agents such as gemcitabine (and combinations), patients with advanced and metastatic disease are appropriate candidates for investigational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 Other than cytotoxic agents, there are few options for treatm ent for patients with metastatic 
and-or local-regionally recurrent osteogenic sarcoma, liposarcoma, and Ewing/Ewing -like 
sarcoma. Trabectedin (ET743, Yondelis®) has been approved in Europe and the U.S. for treatment of metastatic sarcomas on the basis of a  randomized phase II study
14, as well as 
phase III trials data.    Mifamurtide (Mepact®) has also been approved in Europe, in this case for the adjuvant treatment of osteogenic sarcoma. Eribulin, with at least some activity in a phase II study in soft tissue sarcomas, is now approved by [CONTACT_57216] a phase III study vs dacarbazine in advanced liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma.    
Children with relapsed and refractory childhood rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) have a poor 
prognosis when treated with chemotherapy15, [ADDRESS_427047] relaps e or refractory RMS  conducted by [CONTACT_2005]’s Oncology Group 
selected the mTOR inhibitor for further investigation in newly diagnosed patients with 
intermediate risk RMS19. A randomized clinical trial of vincristine and irinotecan with or 
without temozolomide has been recently completed by [CONTACT_344219].

 Regorafenib is a small molecule inhibitor of multiple membrane -bound and intracellular 
kinases involved in normal cellular functions and in pathologic processes such as oncogenesis, 
tumor angiogenesis, and maintenance  of the tumor microenvironment.  In in vitro  biochemical 
or cellular assays, regorafenib or its major human active metabolites M -[ADDRESS_427049] xenografts as demonstrated by a reduction in microvessel area, reduced Ki -67 
staining, and reduced pERK1/2 staining in tissue sections from tumor xenografts, and dose -
dependent inhibition of tumor growth in multiple xenograft models (breast, colon, renal, NSCLC, melanoma, pancreatic, thyroid, ovarian)
20.  Immunohistochemical ex- vivo studies 
with a phospho –specific monoclonal anti -ERK 1/[ADDRESS_427050] five days after treatment with regorafenib in 2 of 3 tumor models examined 
(MDA -MB-231 and BxPC -3), but not in NSCLC (H460).  
 
In addition, all tested human tumor xenografts (MDA -MB-231, H460, BxPC -3 and Colo- 205) 
demonstrated a significant reduction in new blood vessels by [CONTACT_336444] a murine CD31 antibody20. These data suggest that regorafenib can 
target the tumor cell MAPK pathway (i.e., tumor cell survival) and tumor vasculature in some 
but not all tumors.  
 
2.3.1 Preclinical pediatric oncology data  
 
In vitro  effects on cell proliferation were determined in 33 pediatric solid tumor cell lines of 
the Innovative Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_320462] (ITCC) panel covering five malignancies21.  
Regorafenib inhibited cell  proliferation with  a mean half maximal growth inhibition of 12.5 
μmol/L (range 0.7 μmol/L to 28 μmol/L). In vivo , regorafenib was evaluated alone at 10 or 30 
mg/kg/d or in combination with radiation, irinotecan or the mitogen- activated protein kinase 
(MEK ) inhibitor refametinib against various tumor types, including patient -derived brain 
tumor models with an amplified platelet- derived growth factor receptor A (PDGFRA) gene.  
 Regorafenib moderately inhibited the proliferation of the tested pediatric tum or cell line panel 
and was not indicative for the selection of a certain tumor indication .  In vivo , regorafenib 
demonstrated significant tumor growth delay in all models tested across the various

 indications , which is consistent with the obse rvations from a broad and diverse panel of adult 
tumor models . No partial or complete remissions were observed as single agent, except for the 
IGRM57 medulloblastoma model, which is PDGFRA  amplified; i nhibition of the PDGFR 
signaling pathway in tumors with amplified PDGFRA  may be involved in its therapeutic 
efficacy .  Mechanistically the antitumor activity of regorafenib appears to be primarily 
mediated by [CONTACT_344220] , which is accompanied by a proapoptotic activity. 
Similar findings of tumor growth inhibition in culture and in a xenograft model using by 
[CONTACT_39707], sorafenib, and imatinib have been observed in testing of materials derived from a 
patient with mesenchym al chondrosarcoma (R. Sordella, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 
unpublished observations).   
     2.[ADDRESS_427051] (P atients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with regorafenib or placebo 
after failure of standard therapy) trial is an international, multicenter, randomized, double -
blind, placebo- controlled study that enrolled [ADDRESS_427052] supportive care (BSC) or placebo plus BS C. Treatment 
cycles consisted of 160 mg of regorafenib (or matching placebo) once daily for [ADDRESS_427053] ratio for  overall survival was 0.773 (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.635 to 0.941; 1- sided p = .0051). Patients treated with regorafenib had a 
median overall survival of 6.4 months, compared with 5.0 months for placebo — a 29% 
increase in survival. In addition to improved overall survival, progression- free survival was 
superior; median progression- free survival was 1.9 months (95% CI, 1.88 to 2.17) for 
regorafenib and 1.7 months (95% CI, 1.68 to 1.74) for placebo. The estimated hazard ratio for 
progression- free sur vival was 0.493 (95% CI, 0.42 to 0.58; 1- sided p<0.0001). There was a 
substantial difference in disease control rate in the regorafenib and placebo groups (44% vs. 
15%; p<0.0001).  Regorafenib demonstrated comparable efficacy benefits across patient subgroups analyzed including age, number of metastases, number of lines of prior therapy, 
and KRAS  status.  
 
The most frequent grade 3+ adverse events in the regorafenib group were hand–foot skin reaction (17%), fatigue (15%), diarrhea (8%), hyperbilirubinemia (8%), and hypertension (7%).  The efficacy and safety from the CORRECT study supported FDA approval in 
September 2012.

 The efficacy and safety of regorafenib were examined in the Phase III GRID trial in patients 
with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) who had exhausted all other treatment options. The study involved 199 patients with metastatic and/or unresectable GIST that had become resistant to imatinib and sunitinib
9. Patients were randomized 2:1 to regorafenib (160 mg 
orally once daily on a 3 weeks on, 1 week off cycle) or placebo, plus best supportive care.  
 
The results showed that treatment with regorafenib led to a statistically significant 3.9  month 
improvement in progression- free survival (PFS), compared with placebo (4.8 months vs. 0.9 
months; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.27; p <0.0001). Overall survival was statistically similar 
between groups as expected due to a trial design that allowed crossover to regorafenib for disease progression (85% for placebo and 31% for regorafenib randomized patients).  The 
median survival period without tumor growth among patients on regorafenib was 4.[ADDRESS_427055] 12 weeks was 53% with regorafenib compared with 9% in the control group. The most common grade ≥  3 
adverse events associated with regorafenib were hand -foot skin re action (56.1%), 
hypertension (48.5%), and diarrhea (40.9%).   The efficacy and safety of the GRID study data supported FDA approval February 2013.  
  
2.4.3 P ediatric tumors : phase I clinical trial and RP2D determination
 
 Regorafenib was evaluated as a single agent in a multicenter, open- label, non- randomized, 
phase I dose -escalating study designed to define the safety profile, MTD, RP2D, PK, 
pharmacodynamics, preliminary tumor response, and acceptability/palatability of the formulations (tablets and gra nulates) in pediatric subjects with solid malignant tumors which 
are recurrent or refractory to standard therapy. Data from this trial is described below (all information were taken from the study interim report, dated [ADDRESS_427056] 2016).  A total of [ADDRESS_427057] 1 dose of regorafenib were valid for the safety and PK analyses, 23 s ubjects 
were valid and included in the analysis of MTD, and 39 subjects were valid for the efficacy analysis. The median age of subjects was 13.0 years (range: 3 to 17 years of age).  
 Safety: Regorafenib was tolerable at doses up to 82 mg/m2 in pediatric patients, and safety was consistent with the known safety profile of regorafenib in the adult population. All [ADDRESS_427058] frequent TEAEs (≥ 10% of 41 treated subjects) were: vomiting (51.2%), pyrexia (48.8%), headac he (43.9%), AST increased, fatigue and nausea (41.5% each), ALT increased 
(39.0%), palmar -plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (HFSR) and blood bilirubin increased 
(31.7% each). (MedDRA preferred terms). The most common TEAEs of Grade 3 or above (Grades 3/ 4/5), irrespective of relationship to study drug, occurring in more than 5% of all 41 
treated subjects were death (12.2%), headache (9.8%), lymphopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, ALT increased, hydrocephalus, dyspnoea, and rash maculo-
papula r (7.3% each).

In total, 40 of all 41 treated subjects (97.6%) reported at least 1 regorafenib related TEAE and the majority were Grade 2 (22 subjects, 53.7%). Drug- related TEAEs occurring in ≥ 20% 
subjects in the safety analysis set were AST increased (3 4.1%), nausea, fatigue, ALT 
increased, blood bilirubin increased, and palmar -plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome 
(HFSR) (31.7% each), pyrexia (29.3%), decreased appetite (26.8%), neutropenia, and 
thrombocytopenia (24.4% each).  
 
Fifteen subjects (36.6%) e xperienced drug -related TEAEs of worst CTCAE severity Grade ≥ 
3, with 11 subjects (26.8% of 41) and 4 subjects (9.8%) having drug- related TEAEs of worst 
Grades 3 and 4, respectively. Drug- related TEAEs of CTCAE Grade 5 did not occur.  
Common drug- related T EAEs of CTCAE Grade 3 or above (Grades 3/4), occurring in ≥ 5% 
of all 41 treated subjects (by [CONTACT_6213]) were thrombocytopenia and rash maculo -papular (7.3% each).  
 Dose -limiting toxicities were thrombocytopenia at 60 mg/m2, rash maculopapular at 72 
mg/m2, fever at 82 mg/m2, and hypertension and erythroderma at 93 mg/m2. An increased incidence of Grades 3/4 hematological events was observed across dose levels ; it appeared 
that subjects with a history of myelosuppressive  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_344195] a higher risk for such events.  
 Overall, 27 out of 41 subjects (65.9%) had at least one dose modification, and the majority of 
dose modifications were due to AEs; 14 dose redu ctions (34.1%) were reported for the [ADDRESS_427059] had more than one dose reduction.  Three out of 6 subjects (50.0%), 10 out of 14 subjects (71.4%), 7 out of 14 subjects (50.0%), and 6 out of 7 subjects (85.7%) had AEs leading to dose interruptions in Dose Levels 1, 2, [ADDRESS_427060] commonly reported TEAEs (any grade) leading to interruption of study drug in at least 5% subjects of any dose level were pyrexia, platelet count decreased, and rash maculo- papular 
(7.3% of ea ch). The median duration of regorafenib treatment interruptions or delays 
(excluding the protocol defined [ADDRESS_427061] period) was 4 days (range: 1- 17 days).  
 Pharmacokinetics: Regorafenib exposure at all dose levels (60, 72, 82 and 93 mg/m2) was comparable to that observed in adults; including high inter -subject variability. The observed 
geometric mean exposure for the 82 mg/m2 dose group of 50.1 and 47.8 (mg*h/L), based on nominal and actual dosing, is in the same range as that observed (48.4 mg*h/L) in adults at the dose level of 160 mg q.d.  
 Tumor response: No clear relationship between dose level and best tumor response could be observed. None of the treated subjects achieved a CR and only [ADDRESS_427062] (alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma) had a transient PR. Fifteen subjects had stable disease and [ADDRESS_427063] with “CNS anaplastic ependymoma” completed 30 cycles of regorafenib treatment.  
 Based on the overall safety profile and drug exposure across dose levels observed in this phase 1 study, 82 mg/m2 q.d. in a 3- weeks -on/1- week -off schedule is the selected RP2D to be 
studied in subsequent clinical trials of regorafenib when used as monother apy in children and 
adolescents with solid tumors. The hematologic toxicity will continue to be followed closely

 in the proposed expansion cohort phase of this study. For subsequent studies in combination 
with other anticancer agents, a dose finding and/or  dose confirmation phase 1b study to 
determine the optimal dose of regorafenib when combined with chemotherapy is warranted.  
 2.5 Rationale  
 
Inhibition of angiogenesis to slow or stop cancer growth is one mechanism under scrutiny as a 
therapeutic option for patients with metastatic cancers of all types. Some of the agents used to 
examine this issue in STBS are multitargeted Small Molecule Oral Kinase Inhibitors (SMOKIs). Imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib have all been approved for use in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), which is perhaps the most common form of sarcoma.  
 
After failure of standard cytotoxic chemotherapy, pazopanib was approved for use in patients 
with metastatic soft tissue sarcomas other than liposarcoma by [CONTACT_57216] a phase III clinical trial in patients with metastatic soft tissue sarcoma
1. Conversely, there are no randomized data 
to date regarding the activity of SMOKIs in bone sarcomas specifically, and although t here 
are no randomized data regarding the activity of pazopanib in liposarcomas, there appears to be activity of SMOKIs based on the phase II study of pazopanib in soft tissue sarcomas
2. 
 Sorafenib, another multitarget ed small molecule oral kinase inhibitor (SMOKI), demonstrated 
activity in a multi- arm phase II study, in which liposarcoma was also excluded. In a phase II 
clinical trial of sorafenib in [ADDRESS_427064] partial response (S. Attia, MD, 
personal communication).   Although regorafenib was approved for use in patients who had progressive GIST despi[INVESTIGATOR_344190]/or sunitinib, it has not been examined in a systematic fashion in patients  with 
other forms of sarcoma.  
 
Given the activity of sorafenib and pazopanib in soft tissue sarcomas, and evidence of activity 
of sorafenib in osteogenic sarcoma and possibly Ewing/Ewing -like sarcoma, there is 
precedent to examine SMOKIs such as regorafeni b in sarcomas other than GIST. It is also 
recognized that SMOKIs such as regorafenib, sorafenib, pazopanib, and sunitinib have 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_344191]. While not equivalent, most of 
these SMOKIs block vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet derived growth factors 
receptors (VEGFRs and PDGFRs), speaking to a common mechanism of action of several of 
these agents
10. 
 
We propose parallel randomized phase II studies of regorafenib in patients with liposarcoma (excluding purely well differentiated liposarcoma) and osteogenic sarcoma to determine if there is significant activity of these agents, as has been observed with pazopanib in soft tissue sarcomas. In addition, we seek to determine the activity of regorafenib in Ewing/Ewing -like 
Confidential  Page 10  Final Version 6.1 02DEC 2019 
Copyright © SARC (Sarcoma Alliance for Research thr ough Collaboration)  
 sarcoma, given anecdotal data of activity, planning to examine a s ingle cohort of patients in a 
prospective phase II fashion.   
 As of amendment 5, the Ewing sarcoma cohort (C) completed accrual. As of amendment 6, only the rhabdomyosarcoma cohort is open to accrual; the  slow accrual to this arm of the 
study has led to opening another arm of the trial to obtain initial data with regorafenib in 
mesenchymal chondrosarcoma as a new cohort (E).  
 
In addition, given the completion of a pediatric phase I study of regorafenib, it is now possible to safely dose patients under age  18 with regorafenib. This allows both for including younger 
patients on study and investigating diagnoses that are far more common in children than 
adults. Osteogenic sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and Ewing sarcoma and its relatives all 
occur in the pediatri c population, and a substantial majority of embryonal and alveolar 
rhabdomyosarcoma patients fall into the pediatric age group. The limiting factor for treatment 
with regorafenib is weight, given available tablet sizes. A minimum weight and body surface area is specified  in the entry criteria to help e nsure patient safety.  
 Rhabdomyosarcoma has an incidence much greater in younger children, below the age of 10, compared to older children or adults. Patients with recurrence/metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma have a dismal prognosis and will die of disease, nearly universally within 24 months of diagnosis. Accordingly, one goal of this study is to e nsure that the appropriate populations of 
patients can be treated with a novel therapeutic that m ay extend their survival. Since 
rhabdomyosarcoma is more common between the ages of 0- 10 than in older children, it is 
reasonable to treat patients who can tolerate the therapy proposed in the protocol amendment, namely children ages 5 and older (as well as adults), to e nsure that an appropriate population 
of patients with metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma are being treated. lastly , given the pediatric 
phase I data noted in the protocol, a dose and schedule of regorafenib have already been determined in pediatric  patients, making the use of regorafenib more tenable for patients and 
families with this nearly uniformly fatal diagnosis.  
 
     2.[ADDRESS_427065] parallel clinical trials of regorafenib in five  different metastatic/local-
regionally recurrent STBS populations: (A) liposarcoma (excluding purely well -differentiated 
liposarcoma); (B) osteogenic sarcoma; (C) Ewing /Ewing -like sarcoma; ( D) 
rhabdomyosarcoma  (only embryonal or alveolar subtypes); (E)  mesenchymal 
chondrosarcoma .  
 For cohorts A and B , we will conduct parallel randomized phase II studies. Patients will be

 Since there are even fewer data regarding the small round blue cell tumor family characterized  
rhabdomyosarcoma , the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors , and mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, 
which are often more aggressive than either liposarcoma subtypes or osteogenic sarcoma, 
single  stage phase II clinical design s will be used to obtain initial clinical experience with 
these very aggressive sarcoma subtype s. Patients will be further stratified by [CONTACT_344221] (1 vs 2 or more) , as well as WHO performance status (0 -1 vs 2).

3.3 Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
 
Men, women, children (at least age 5 year s) and members of all ethnic and racial groups may 
be eligible for this trial.  
 
 
4. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES  
 
     4.[ADDRESS_427090] be performed by [CONTACT_344223] 9, Study Evaluations and Study Calendar, only data related to the primary and secondary endpoints, as well as safety data, will be captured in the eCRF s. 
 
     4.2 Registration Process  
 Prior to beginning patient registrat ion, the site clinical research associate should review all the 
eligibility criteria with the site Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_344201] -up requirements for 
the study to ensure that the patient to be enrolled meets all the eligibility requirements.  A patient failing to meet all the eligibility requirements should not  be registered  for the study 
and should not be enrolled in the study database .  Once the data has been entered into the 
study database for enrollment of the patient, a unique patient identification number will be assigned by [CONTACT_344224].   SARC024 uses a web based ele ctronic data capture system (EDC) for data submission.  All 
sites must complete training prior to using the web based EDC system.  Data managers and other authorized users will be provided with a unique user identification number and password to access the EDC system.

 All eligible subjects must be registered prior to the start of treatment.  All subject registrations 
and case report forms will be submitted electronically via the EDC system.  
 Any problems accessing the EDC system or questions regarding the registration process should be directed to the SARC Operations Office via phone ([PHONE_7155]) or via email, at [EMAIL_6668]
. 
   
4.3 Treatment assignment 
 
Eligible patients will be registered by [CONTACT_344225]. For patients on substudies requiring randomization, s ubjects 
will be  randomly assigned to receive either regorafenib 160 mg once daily or placebo (1:1), [ADDRESS_427091] who discontinues study participation prematurely for any reason is defined as a “dropout” and withdrawn from study participation.  Situations in which a subject is defined as a “dropout” include: if the subject has already been registered, randomized, assigned to 
treatment/run -in/wash -out or administered at least one  dose of study drug.  
 A subject who, for any reason (e.g. failure to satisfy the selection criteria), terminates the study before the time point used for the definition of “dropout” (see above) is regarded a “screening failure”.  
      4.5 Replacement  
 
No withdrawn subjects (i.e. dropouts) will be replaced.  
 5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1 Agent Administration  Cohorts A and B : patients with liposarcoma or osteosarcoma will be randomized 1:1 to 
receive regorafenib or placebo . Crossover of the placebo group is permitted if patients still 
meet all entry criteria to continue on treatment. (Accrual completed as of amendment 5)   
 Cohort C:  patients with Ewing sarcomas will all receive regorafenib from the start of the 
study. (Accr ual completed  as of amendment 5 ) 
 
Confidential  Page 19  Final Version 6.1 02DEC 2019 
Copyright © SARC (Sarcoma Alliance for Research thr ough Collaboration)  
 Cohort D:  patients with rhabdomyosarcoma (fusion- positive alveolar, embryonal, and fusion-
negative alveolar) will all receive regorafenib from the start of the study  
 
Cohort E : patients with mesenchymal chondrosarcoma will all receive regorafenib from the 
start of the study  
In all cases the length of one cycle of therapy is 28 days (3 weeks on, 1 week off). If a patient 
experiences toxicity and is not due to resume therapy until the 1 week of the cycle off 
treatment, the subsequent cycle of therapy may start after a minimum of 1 week off regorafenib.  
 
Example 1:  A patient experiences toxicity at the day 8 visit of a cycle and treatment is held 
until day 15. After resuming treatment from day 15 until day 22, the patient is off treatment 
from days 22- 28, and starts again on day 29, which is day 1 of the new cycle of therapy.  
 Example 2:  A patient experiences toxicity at day 17 and treatment is held through day 24, which is after the expected end of treatment that cycle on day 22. The patient may resume therapy with a new cyc le of therapy as early as day 25, or may stay off therapy through day 
28, resuming treatment cycle day 29/day [ADDRESS_427092] be stored in their  
original bottle s at a t emperature of 20- 25 °C (68 -77 °F); provisional temperature limits 
permitted to 15 -30 °C (59- 86 °F) . 
 The study drugs  must be exclusively used for the investigation specified in this protocol and 
they will only be accessible to authorized staff.  
 
     5.3 B linding and unblinding  
  5.3.1 Blinding  
 
In compliance with applicable regulations, in the event of a S[LOCATION_003]R, the patient’s treatment code will usually be unblinded before reporting to the health authorities, ethic committees and investigators if the S[LOCATION_003]R was related to the blinded treatment.

 5.3.[ADDRESS_427093] and state that the treatment 
assignment will not be unblinded at that time and treatment of the patient should proceed as if 
the blinded drug is regorafenib.  
      5.4 Study drug administration  
 
Regorafenib (or placebo) is administered as monotherapy during the study. For adults on the 
study, t he starting dose is 160 mg daily for 3 weeks on, 1 week off, taken in the morning with 
a low -fat meal each day.  
 The medication should be taken within 8 hours of the same time each day, otherwise should 
be marked as a missed dose. One cycle is 28 days.   
 For adults, f our 40 mg regorafenib or placebo  tablet s should be taken in the morning with 
approximately 8 fluid ou nces (240 mL) of water after a low -fat (< 30% fat) breakfast.  Some 
examples of low -fat breakfasts are:  
 
• Two slices of white toast with 1 tablespoon of low -fat margarine and 1 tablespoon of 
jelly and 8 ounces (240 mL) of skim milk (approximately 319 calorie s and 8.2 g of 
fat). 
 
• One cup of cereal, 8 ounces (240 mL) of skim milk, one pi[INVESTIGATOR_115082] (no butter or marmalade), apple juice, and one cup of coffee or tea (2 g fat, 17 g protein, 93 g of carbohydrate, 520 calories ). 
 The medication will be taken in a similar fashion in pediatric patients (< 18 years). … Pediatric patients on trial will receive tablets according to the dosing table below (Table 5.4). The starting dose is 82 mg/m
[ADDRESS_427094] permissible dose is 20 mg.  The  minimum body surface area 
to participate is 0.65m
2 and minimum weight is 15  Kg. (33 lbs.)

      5.[ADDRESS_427096]’s welfare, and which is not 
expected to interfere with the evaluation of the study treatment, may be given at the discretion of the investigator.  All medications taken within [ADDRESS_427097]’s source documentation, including start/stop dates, dose frequency, route of administration, and indication.  Specific caution should be taken when considering or administering a concomitant medication that is metabolized by [CONTACT_39705]2C8, CYP2B6 and CYP2C9.  Such concomitant medications should be avoided, if possible.  Co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampin) with a single 160 mg dose of 
regorafenib  decreased the mean exposure of regorafenib , increased the mean exposure of the 
active metabolite M -5, and resulted in no change in the mean exposure of the active 
metabolite M -2.  Avoid concomitant use of regorafenib  with strong CYP3A4. A listing of 
strong CYP3A4 inducers is provided in Appendix D . 
 Co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (ketoconazole) with a single 160 mg dose of 
regorafenib  increased the mean exposure of regorafenib and decreased the mean exposure of 
the active metabolites M -2 and M -5.  Avoid concomitant use of regorafeni b with strong 
inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity. A listing of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is provided in Appendix D . 
 Permitted concomitant therapy includes:  
 
• Standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_39674]  
• Supportive care for any underlying illness  
• Hematopoietic growth factors: subjects are permitted to take chronic erythropoietin. If 
a patient develops neutropenia, patients should have doses reduced, and not use growth factors such as filgrastim to artificially elevate the neutrophil count. Use of pegfilgrastim or related growth factors for an epi[INVESTIGATOR_344202]  
• Treatment with nonconventional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (such as acupuncture), and vitamin/mineral supplements are permitted provided that they do not interfere with the study endpoints, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]  
• Bisphosphonates  
Confidential  Page 22  Final Version 6.1 02DEC 2019 
Copyright © SARC (Sarcoma Alliance for Research thr ough Collaboration)  
 • Subjects who are therapeutically treated with an agent such as warfarin or heparin will 
be allowed to participate provided that their medication dose and INR/PTT are stable, as determined by [CONTACT_20603].   
    
The following are not  permitted while the patient is on study:  
 
• Other investigational treatment during or within 14 days (or 5 half -lives, whichever is 
longer) before starting study treatment  
• Radiation therapy: any need for radiation therapy will be defined as clinical (if not 
radiographic) worsening of disease, and represent a progression event  
• Systemic antitumor therapy, including cytotoxic therapy, signal transduction 
inhibitors, immunotherapy, and hormonal therapy  
• Bone marrow transplant or stem cell rescue  
• Subjects taking narrow therapeutic index medications  should be monitored 
proactively (e.g. warfarin, phenytoin, quinidine, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital, 
cyclosporin e, and digoxin ).  Warfarin is metabolized by [CONTACT_39706]2C 9 and warfarin levels may be especially affected by [CONTACT_39707]  
• Use of any her bal remedy (e.g. St. John's W ort [Hypericum perforatum ]). 
 
     5.6 Duration of Therapy  
Treatment may continue until one of the following criteria applies: 
 
• Disease progression as defined by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 
• Greater than [ADDRESS_427098] dose of study drug  
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study during the treatment phase of the study 
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study during the follow up phase after 
completion of treatment on the study 
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient unacceptable 
for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator .

Subjects must be withdrawn from the trial (treatment and procedures) for the following reasons:  
 
• Subject withdraws consent from study treatment and study procedures.  A subject must be removed from the trial at his/her own request or at the request of his/her legally acceptable representative.  At any time during the trial and without giving reasons, a subject may decline to participate further.  The subject will not suffer any disadvantage as a result  
• Pregnancy.  Pregnancy will be reported a s an SAE.  (Note: subjects who have been 
withdrawn from treatment with study drug because of pregnancy should not undergo 
CT scans [with contrast]/MRI or bone scans while pregnant.)  
• If, in the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuation of the trial would be harm ful to the 
subject's well -being  
• Subject is lost to follow -up 
• Death.  
 
Subjects  may be  withdrawn from the study for the following reasons:  
 
• The subject is non- compliant with study drug (regorafenib or placebo), trial 
procedures, or both; including the use of  anti-cancer therapy not prescribed by [CONTACT_60658]  
• Severe allergic reaction to regorafenib (such as exfoliative erythroderma or Grade 3 or 
4 hypersensitivity reaction)  
• Development of a second cancer  
• Development of an intercurrent illness or situation which would, in the judgment of the investigator, significantly affect assessments of clinical status and trial endpoints  
• Deterioration of WHO performance status to 4  
• Use of illicit drugs or other substances that may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_35272], 
have a reasonable chance of contributing to toxicity or otherwise skewing trial result.  
Any subject removed from the trial will remain under medical supervision until discharge or transfer is medically acceptable. In all cases, the reason for with drawal must be recorded in 
the e CRF and in the subject's medical records.  
 6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS   
6.1 Dose Reduction Levels  
 
In adults, t he starting dose of regorafenib is 160 mg once daily for Cohort s C, D and E .  
The starting dose for Cohorts A and B is 4 tablets of regorafenib or placebo daily.   For pediatric patients  (< 18 years of age) , the starting dose is 82 mg/m
2 (rounding to 
nearest 20 mg), with a maximum daily dose capped at 160 mg. Please refer to dosing 
table in Section 5.2. 
Confidential  Page 24  Final Version 6.1 02DEC 2019 
Copyright © SARC (Sarcoma Alliance for Research thr ough Collaboration)  
  
Study medication will be administered on a 3- weeks on, 1- week off schedule ( 3 weeks out of 
every 4 ). 
 Doses will be delayed or reduced for clinically significant hematologic and non- hematologic 
toxicities that are related to protocol therapy according to the guidelines shown in the Dose 
Delays/Dose Modifications table that follows.  In general , this will mean clinically 
meaningful G  3 or worse toxicity, although clinically significant G  2 toxicity may qualify, 
according to the  treating physician. Dose modifications will follow predefined dose levels. 
Dose adjustments for hematologic toxicity are based on the blood counts obtained in 
preparation for the day of treatment.  
 
     Table 6.1.1 Dose reduction levels  – adult patients  
The modifications of regorafenib  or placebo  dosing will follow the following 
predefined dose levels:  
Dose level 0 (standard 
starting dose)  160 mg oral daily  Four 40  mg tablets of regorafenib  or 
placebo  
Dose level - 1 120 mg oral daily  Three 40  mg tablets of regorafenib  or 
placebo  
Dose level - 2 80 mg oral daily  Two 40  mg tablets of regorafenib  or 
placebo  
  
     Table 6.1.2 Dose reduction levels  – pediatric patients  
The modifications of regorafenib or placebo dosing will follow the following 
predefined dose levels:  
Dose level 0 (standard 
starting dose)  82 mg /m2 oral daily , rounding to nearest 20 mg  
Dose level -1 72 mg/m2 oral daily , rounding to nearest 20 mg 
Dose level - 2 60 mg /m2 oral daily , rounding to nearest [ADDRESS_427101] causally related to study treatment.  
 
6.2 Management of toxicity ( other than hand- foot skin reaction , hypertension and LFT 
abnormalities)  
 The table below outlines dose adjustments for most hematologic and non -hematologic 
toxicities related to regorafenib  except hand -foot skin reaction ( HFSR ) and hypertension 
and LFT abnormalities . 
 In addition to these recommended dose modifications, subjects who develop diarrhea (see

 Section 6.6), mucositis, anorexia or other events predispos ing to fluid loss or inadequate fluid 
intake should be carefully monitored and rehydrated as clinically necessary.  This is in order 
to minimize the risk of postural hypotension and renal failure.

 Grading and dose alterations are noted in Tables 6.3 and 6.4 below.  
 
Recommended prevention/management strategies for skin toxicities consistent with HFSR are 
summarized below:  
 Control of calluses  
 
Before initiating treatment with regorafenib: 
• Check condition of hands and feet  
• Suggest a manicure/pedicure, when indicated  
• Recommend pumice stone use for callus or ‘rough spot’ removal . 
 
During regorafenib treatment:  
 
• Avoid pressure points  
• Avoid items that rub, pi[INVESTIGATOR_39670].  
 
Use of creams  
 Non-urea based creams may be applied liberally  
 
• Keratolytic cream s (e.g. urea -based creams, salicylic acid 6%) may be used sparingly 
and only to affected (hyperkeratotic) areas  
• Alpha hydroxyl acids (AHA) based creams may be applied liberally 2 times a day.  Approximately 5% to 8% provides gentle chemical exfoliation  
• Topi[INVESTIGATOR_39671] (e.g. lidocaine 2%) are to be considered for pain control  
• Topi[INVESTIGATOR_39672] 0.05% should be considered for subjects with G 2 or 3 HFSR.  Avoid systemic steroids. 
 Tender areas should be protected as follows:  
 
• Use so cks/gloves to cover moisturizing creams  
• Wear well -padded footwear  
• Use insole cushions or inserts (e.g. silicon, gel)  
• Foot soaks with tepid water and Epson salts .

6.5 Liver Function Abnormalities  
 
For patients with observed worsening of serum liver tests considered related to regorafenib 
(i.e. where no alternative cause is evident, such as post-hepatic cholestasis or disease 
progression), the dose modification and monitoring advice in Table 6.[ADDRESS_427107] (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia may occur in patients with Gilbert syndrome . Note in Table 6.6 that hyperbilirubinemia itself is not 
a reason for dose reduction. Patients with Gilbert syndrome who develop elevated transaminases should be managed as per the recommendations outlined for ALT/AST elevations.

Restart: If the potential benefit outweighs the risk of 
hepatotoxicity, re -initiate regorafenib  or placebo  
treatment, reduce dose by 40 mg (one tablet), and 
monitor liver function weekly for at least 4 weeks.  
Re-occurrence  Discontinue treatment with regorafenib  or placebo  
permanently.

Exception: patients with Gilbert syndrome who 
develop elevated transaminases should be managed as 
per the above outlined recommendations for the 
respective elevation of ALT and/or AST.  
6.6 Prevention/man agement strategies for diarrhea  
 
Diarrhea can be a common side effect of regorafenib.  T he preventive/management strategies 
for diarrhea should be consistent with local standards (e.g., anti -diarrheals and optimized 
hydration status). 
 Anti-diarrhea l medic ations may be introduced if symptoms occur.  Previous trials have shown 
that the diarrhea could be managed with loperamide.  The recommended dose of loperamide is [ADDRESS_427118] onset, followed by 2 mg every 2 to 4 hours until diarrhea -free for 12 hours.  
  7. ADVERSE EVENTS: LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
Confidential Page 34  Final Version 6.1 02DEC2019 
Copyright © SARC (Sarcoma Alliance for Research thr ough Collaboration) 
 Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The 
following list of AEs (Section 7.1) and the characteristics of an observed AE (Section 7.2) will determine whether the event requires expedited reporting in additio n to routine reporting.  
For routine reporting it is expected that all adverse events grade 3 or greater are recorded.  
 
     7.1 Adverse Event and Laboratory Abnormalities  
7.1.1 Clinical AEs   
 [IP_ADDRESS] Definition of Adverse Events  
Per the International Conference of Harmonisation (ICH), an AE is any 
untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment.  An  AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  Pre-existing conditions which worsen during a study are to be reported as AEs.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] CTCAE term (AE description) 
The descriptions found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_427119] access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.03.  A copy of the CTCAE version 4.03 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site ( http://ctep.cancer .gov
). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Intensity   
Intensity of all adverse events will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 4.03 (CTCAE) on a five-point scale (grades 1 to 5) and all grade 3 and above will be reported in 
detail on the e CRF.  Adverse events not listed on the CTCAE should be 
graded as follows:    
Table 7.1 CTC AE version 4.03 adverse event grading  
 
Confidential Page 35  Final Version 6.1 02DEC2019 
Copyright © SARC (Sarcoma Alliance for Research thr ough Collaboration) 
 CTC 
Grade  Equivalen t To:  Definition  
Grade [ADDRESS_427120] daily activity; 
no treatment or medical intervention is indicated 
although this could improve the overall well -being or 
symptoms of the patient 
Grade 3  Severe  Inability to work or perform normal daily activity; 
treatment or medical intervention is indicated in order 
to improve the overall well-being or symptoms; 
delaying the onset of treatment is not putting the 
survival of the patient at direct risk.  
Grade 4  Life 
threatening/ 
disabling An immediate threat to life or leading to a permanent 
mental or physical conditions that prevents work or 
performing normal daily activities; treatment or 
medical intervention is required in order to maintain 
survival. 
Grade 5  Death  AE resulting in death  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Drug- Adverse Event relationship  
 
The causality relationship of study drug to the adverse event will be assessed by [CONTACT_99352]:  
Yes or No  
 
If there is a reasonable suspected causal relationship to the study medication, i.e. there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, drug- event relationship should be assessed as Yes . In other studies, the terms  
that qualify for a “Yes” assignation include “Definite”, “Probable”, or “Possible”.  
 
The following criteria should be considered in order to assess the relationship 
as Yes:  
 – Reasonable temporal association with drug administration 
– Known response pattern to suspected drug  
– Disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose  
– Reappears on rechallenge . 
 
Confidential Page 36  Final Version 6.1 02DEC2019 
Copyright © SARC (Sarcoma Alliance for Research thr ough Collaboration) 
 The following criteria should be considered in order to assess the relationship 
as No; in other studies, the terms that qualify for a “No” assignation include 
“Unlikely”, or “Unrelated”: 
 
– It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration 
 of the drug 
– It may readily have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, 
 environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy admi nistered 
 to the subject  
– It does not follow a known pattern of response to the suspected drug  
– It does not reappear or worsen when the drug is re- administered.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
 
A serious adverse event is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, 
contraindication, side effect or precaution.  It is any Adverse Event that at 
any dose fulfils at least one of the following criteria:  - Is fatal; (results in death; NOTE: death is an outcome, not an event)  
- Is Life -Threatening (NOTE: the term "Life -Threatening" refers to an 
 event in which the patient was at immediate risk of death at the time 
 of the event; it does not refer to an event which could hypothetically  have caused a death had it been more severe)  
- Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_344204]  
- Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
- Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
- Is medically significant or requires intervention to prevent one or 
 other of the outcomes listed above.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Progression of Underlying Malignancy  
 
Progression of underlying malignancy is not reported as an adverse event if it is clearly consistent with the suspected progression of the underlying cancer as defined by [CONTACT_393] 1.1. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_344205] a serious adverse event.  Clinical symptoms of progression may be reported as adverse events if the symptom cannot be determined as exclusively due to the progression of the underlying malignancy, or does not fit the expected patter n of progression for the disease under study. 
 Symptomatic deterioration may occur in some patients.  In this situation, progression is evident in the patient’s clinical symptoms, but is not supported by [CONTACT_217976].  Or, the disease progression is so evident that the investigator may elect not to perform further disease assessments.  In such cases, the determination of clinical progression is based on 
Confidential Page 37  Final Version 6.1 02DEC2019 
Copyright © SARC (Sarcoma Alliance for Research thr ough Collaboration) 
 symptomatic deterioration. These determinations should be a rare exception 
as every effort should be made to document the objective progression of underlying malignancy.  If there is any uncertainty about an adverse event being due only to the disease under study, it should be reported as an AE or SAE. 
 
7.1.2 Treatment and Follow- up AEs   
 
After the discontinuation of therapy with regorafenib  continue to follow up AEs 
as follows:  
Related AEs:   Follow until one of the following occurs: 
- Resolved or improved to baseline 
- Relationship is reassessed as unrelated  
- Start of new anti -cancer regimen  
- Investigator confirms that no further improvement can be expected  
- Clinical or safety data will no longer be collected, or final database closure  
- Death.  
 
Unrelated severe or life threatening AEs:   Follow until one of the following 
occurs:  
- Resolved or improved to baseline 
- Severity improved to grade [ADDRESS_427121] be recorded on th e CRF.  
 
Unrelated Grade 1 or Grade 2 AEs:   Follow as clinically indicated  
 
7.1.[ADDRESS_427122] Abnormalities   
 
Any laboratory result abnormality fulfilling the criteria for a serious adverse event (SAE) should be reported as such.  Any treatment -emergent abnormal laboratory result that is clinically significant, 
i.e., meeting one or more of the following conditions, should be recorded on the adverse event eCRF:  
- Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659] 
- Leading to a change in study medication (e.g. dose modification, interruption or permanent discontinuation) 
- Requiring a change in concomitant therapy (e.g. addition of, interruption of, discontinuation of, or any other change in a concomitant medication, 
Confidential Page 38  Final Version 6.1 02DEC2019 
Copyright © SARC (Sarcoma Alliance for Research thr ough Collaboration) 
 therapy or treatment) . 
 
7.1.[ADDRESS_427123] should be repeated and followed until it has returned to the normal range, baseline value and/or an adequate explanation of the abnorm ality 
is found. If a clear explanation is established it should be recorded in the e CRF.  
 
     7.2 Handling of Safety Parameters 
 
7.2.1  Reporting of Adverse Events  
 
All adverse events (related and unrelated) Grade [ADDRESS_427124] be reported.  Reporting the specific time of onset of a given AE is only necessary when it occurs in relation to study drug administration.      
7.2.2  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events (immediately reportable)  
 
Any clinical adverse event or abnormal laboratory test value that is serious and 
which occurs during the course of the study (as defined in section 7.1 above), 
regardless of the treatment arm, must be reported to SARC within 24 hours  of 
the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_223305] (expedited reporting).  
SARC will then forward MedWatch data form(s) to the overall study PI [INVESTIGATOR_344206]. If only limited 
information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. The original 
SAE Form must be kept on file at the study site.  SAEs must be reported on the MedWatch Form 3500A along with the completed Fax Coversheet and faxed or sent electronically to SARC as listed . (See 
Appendix B ). 
 
Related  Serious Adverse Events MUST  be collected and reported regardless of 
the time elapsed from the last study drug administration, even if the study has been closed.  
 Unrelated Serious Ad verse Events must be collected and reported during the 
study and for up to [ADDRESS_427125] also

 be reported to the investigator.  The investigator should report all pregnancies 
within 24 hours to the sponsor.  The investigator should counsel the patient; discuss the risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus.  Monitoring of the patient should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy.  Pregnancy occurring in the partner of a male patient participating in the study should also be reported to the investigator and the sponsor. The partner should be counseled and followed as described above.

(7) For women of childbearing potential within [ADDRESS_427134] – Solid Tumors , with modifications for well differentiated -

For the purposes of this study, patients should be re- evaluated for response every [ADDRESS_427135] 32 weeks, then every 12 weeks thereafter. At the discretion of the treating physician, additional imaging should be obtained if the patient has symptom s consistent with potential 
progression of disease. If progression is confirmed, the treatment will be unblinded as outlined in section 5.3. Scans may be done up to ± 7 days of the scheduled dates.  Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the international criteria of the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [ Eur 
J CA  45:228-247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of 
the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in RECIST.  We will modify choice of target lesions on this study to focus on the most 
aggressive component of well- differentiated -dedifferentiated liposarcoma, i.e. the 
dedifferentiated components, since the well differentiated component often cannot be distinguished from normal fat.

below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)  
 
Evaluable Non- Target Disease Response.  Patients who have lesions present at 
baseline that ar e evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, 
have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re- evaluated 
will be considered evaluable for non- target disease.  The response assessment is 
based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.

centimeters).  
 
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or 
might not be considered measurable.  If the investigator thinks it appropriate to 
include them, the conditions under which such lesions should be considered must be defined in the protocol . 
 
Malignant lymph nodes.  To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be >[ADDRESS_427140] 
scan (CT scan slice thickness reco mmended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At 
baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 
Non-measurable disease.  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small 
lesions (longest diameter <  10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥  10 to < 15 
mm short axis), are considered non- measurable disease.  Bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non- measurable.  
 Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by [CONTACT_108], sim ple cysts.  
 ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non- cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred 
for selection as target lesions.  
 
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ 
and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be 
selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calcu lated and reported as the 
baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as

 reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in  the measurable 
dimension of the disease. 
 For patients with well- differentiated  dedifferentiated liposarcoma (WD- DDLS), 
the well differentiated component often does not change in size over a period of months to years, or if it does, it does not change in size quickly. For this reason, we will examine specifically in WD -DDLS patients the dedifferentiated components 
of the tumor. These can be identified as having a CT density of > [ADDRESS_427141] increased signal on T2- weighted images and/or less intense in T1-
weighted series than the fatty T1 -intense well -differentiated components of well -
differentiated liposarcoma. By [CONTACT_344231], any lesions that are deemed to be sarcoma but not the dedifferentiated component will be considered non- target 
lesions, and their evaluation will be as with other non- target lesions as describe 
immediately below. Significant worsening of the well differentiated component in a WD -DDLS patient will be considered non-target lesion progression.  
 
Non-target les ions.  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable 
lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non- target 
lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow-up.  
 
10.1.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging-based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 
Clinical lesio ns:  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they 
are superficial ( e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥  10 mm 
diameter as assessed using calipers ( e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray:  Lesions on chest x- ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when 
they are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI:  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on 
CT scan based on the as sumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_427142] 
Confidential Page 50  Final Version 6.1 02DEC2019 
Copyright © SARC (Sarcoma Alliance for Research thr ough Collaboration) 
 scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable 
lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations ( e.g. for body scans).   
 Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and 
temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used a t follow -up should be the same as was used at baseline and 
the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
PET- CT: At pr esent, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a 
combined PET-CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identical diag nostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV 
and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET-CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
 
Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not an accepted standard for the assessment of lesion 
size and should not be used as a method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessmen t to the 
next.  If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154].  If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances. 
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy:  The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence  following complete response (CR) or surgical resection 
is an endpoint. 
 
Tumor markers : Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If 
markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both 
Confidential Page 51  Final Version 6.1 02DEC2019 
Copyright © SARC (Sarcoma Alliance for Research thr ough Collaboration) 
 CA-125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent 
prostate cancer) have been published [ JNCI  96:487-488, 2004; J Clin Oncol  17, 
3461-3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol  26:1148-1159, 2008].  In addition, the Gynecologic 
Cancer Intergroup has developed CA-[ADDRESS_427143]- line trials in ovarian 
cancer [ JNCI  92:1534-1535, 2000]. This criterion is generally not germane for 
sarcoma patients, since there are no sarcoma -specific tumor markers in common 
use. 
 
Cytology, Histology: These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases ( e.g., residual lesions in 
tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can 
remain).  
 The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
FDG -PET:  FDG -PET will not be used for tumor evaluation on this study. If an 
FDG -PET scan is done as part of routine monitoring of the patient, then scans of 
metastatic sites should be done with diagnostic quality images  of those sites.  
 
10.1.4 Response Criteria  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any 
pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).

 Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR 
nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, 
taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis). 
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non- target 
lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions 
and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.  Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be repr esentative of overall 
disease status change, not a single lesion increase.     
 
Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_36408], and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator).

[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the 
treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of bot h measurement and confirmation criteria.

a If a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen at a subsequent time 
point, even disease meeting PR criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR). Best respon se would 
depend on whether minimum duration for SD was met. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the first time point. Under these 
circumstanc es, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR.

 10.1.5 Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) 
until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented 
(taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
 
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
 
10.1.6 Progression- Free Sur vival (PFS), Time to progression (TTP)  
 
PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first. TTP is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression, omitting death.

11.1 Data Reporting  
 
11.1.1 Method  Electronic case report forms (eCRFs) will be created by [CONTACT_214788], the overall Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_344210].  The database will be built within t he 
MEDIDATA RAVE system for data collection for this study.   The definition of serious adverse events (SAEs) is given in Section 7.1. Each serious adverse event must be followed up until resolution or stabilization, by [CONTACT_39718]. For purposes of this study, a laboratory abnormality that is assigned grade 3 or 4, according to CTCAE version 4.03 is reportable as an SAE.  CTC AE v 4.03 grade 3 or 4 baseline laboratory abnormalities that are part of 
the disease pr ofile should not be reported as an SAE, specifically when they are allowed 
or not excluded by [CONTACT_39719] / exclusion criteria.   
 When required, and according to local law and regulations, serious adverse events must be reported to the IRB and Regulatory Authorities.  
Confidential Page 56  Final Version 6.1 02DEC2019

Copyright © SARC (Sarcoma Alliance for Research thr ough Collaboration)  
 renal cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.  The primary objectives of this phase 2 
study are for Cohorts A & B to compare PFS of subjects treated with regorafenib or placebo and for Cohort C to estimate PFS at [ADDRESS_427155] identification number, which can only be linked to the patient at a given institution by [CONTACT_47806].  
 All documentation that contains personal health information that may include patient identifiable information will be maintained at the site to  preserve patient confidentiality.  
 
11.5 P remature termination of study  
 This study may be closed prematurely for any of the following reasons:  
 
• If risk -benefit ratio becomes unacceptable owing to, for example : 
o Safety  findings from this study (e.g. SAEs)  
o Results of any interim analysis  
o Results of parallel clinical studies  
o Results of parallel animal studies  (on e.g. toxicity, teratogenicity, carcinogenicity or reproduction toxicity).  
• If the study conduct (e.g. recruitment rate; drop- out rate; data quality; protocol 
compliance) does not suggest a proper completion of the trial within a reasonable time frame.  
The inves tigator has the right to close his/her center at any time.  
For any of the above closures, the following applies:  
• Closure s should occur only after consultation between involved parties.  
• All affected institutions (e.g. IEC(s)/IRB(s); competent authority(ies) ; study center; head 
of study center) must be informed as applicable according to local law.  
• In case of  a partial study closure, ongoing subjects, including those in post study follow -
up, must be taken care of in an ethical manner.

 12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
12.1 Efficacy and safety variables  
 
12.1.1 Efficacy variables  
 Efficacy variables to analyze include:  
• Progression free survival (PFS, as assessed by [CONTACT_393] 1.1), defined as time from 
randomization (or 1st day of treatment, cohort C , D and E ) to site determined 
radiographic tumor progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first).  For 
patients alive without progression, censoring occurs at the date of las t tumor 
assessment. In PFS analyses, if the exact progression date is unknown, the date of 
progression is taken to be the date the first time at which progression can be declared  
• Proportions of patients who are progression- free (and alive)  
• Proportions of patients without progression or death at landmark times ( in particular at 
8 and 16 weeks ) 
• Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization (or 1st day of treatment, cohort s C, D and E ) until death from any cause .  Censoring occurs at the dat e of last 
contact.  
• Disease- specific survival is defined as the time from randomization (or 1st day of 
treatmen t cohort s C, D and E ) until death from sarcoma  
• Time to progression (as assessed by [CONTACT_393] 1.1), defined as time from randomization (or 1st day of treatment, cohort C) to centrally- determined radiographic tumor 
progression, censoring for death without progression.  Progression is defined, according to R ECIST 1.1, as a 20% increase from nadir and a minimum of [ADDRESS_427156] time at which progression can be declared   
• Change in target lesion size.  Target lesion size will be measured by [CONTACT_344238].  Tumor size wi ll be measured as a unidimensional tumor measurement per RECIST 
1.1. 
• Overall response rate (ORR as assessed by [CONTACT_393] 1.1) defined as the portion of 
patients evaluable for response who achieved partial response or better and stable 
disease or better  
 12.1.2 Safety variables  
 
A treatment -associated adverse event (TAAE) is defined as an AE that was not present at 
baseline, or an exacerbation of a pre -existing AE.  For laboratory data, a treatment -
associated abnormal laboratory value (TAAV) represents an abn ormal value that was 
normal at baseline.  
Confidential  Page 62  Final Version 6.1 02DEC 2019 
Copyright © SARC (Sarcoma Alliance for Research thr ough Collaboration)  
  
Safety variables of analysis include the following:  
 
• Proportions of patients with any TAAEs  
• Proportions of patients with serious TAAEs  
• Proportions of patients with Grade 3 or greater TAAEs  
• Proportions of pa tients with severe TAAE  
• Proportions of patients with TAAEs leading to study drug discontinuation 
• Proportions of patients with TAAEs leading to dose modifications  
• Proportions of patients with drug- related TAAEs  
• Proportions of patients with TAAVs  
• Mean and median changes from baseline in vital signs  
• Mean and median changes from baseline in clinical laboratory measures  
• Mean and median changes from baseline in measures from electrocardiography. 
 It is noted that patients who cross over from placebo to receive open -label regorafenib will 
have treatment -related derivations from first dose of placebo during the double -blind 
period and treatment -related derivations from first dose of regorafenib during the open-
label portion of the study. 
 
12.2 S tudy Design/Endpoints  
 
Cohorts A and  B (liposarcoma and osteosarcoma)  
 Each of cohorts A and B will be studied using a randomized placebo controlled phase II design with a progression free survival endpoint. Outcomes will be determined on an intention to treat analysis.  
 Each cohort substudy will be powered to detect a difference of at least [ADDRESS_427157] ratio of 0.4 for treatment/control groups.   [ADDRESS_427158] a targeted difference with 90% power and 5% one -sided 
significance level. The final analysis of the prim ary PFS endpoint will be conducted when at 
least 42 patients had disease worsening. 48 eligible patients are expected to be randomized, to achieve the 42 expected events with an enrollment rate of 4 eligible patients per month per 
substudy. With the predic ted accrual rate and PFS parameters, the 42 events are expected to 
occur in 16 months.   We will limit to a maximum of 16 patients per substudy A & B with WHO performance status of 2. There is no such limitation for substudy C.     Survival will be estimated by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier method. The treatment groups will be 
compared with a one -sided str atified log rank test. All analyses will be done in the intention -
to-treat population.  
Confidential  Page 63  Final Version 6.1 02DEC 2019 
Copyright © SARC (Sarcoma Alliance for Research thr ough Collaboration)  
  
We will conduct a prognostic factor analysis for PFS using a univariate Cox model; significant factors subsequently will be included in a multivariable Cox regression m odel 
(cutoff p<0·05). For a predictive analysis of PFS, Cox models will be generated with the investigated factor, treatment, and their interaction, with a significance value of p<0·05. P -
values will not be adjusted for multiple comparisons. 
 
Cohort C (Ewi ng/Ewing -like sarcoma):  
 
Since progression free survival is so short in Ewing/Ewing -like sarcoma, even with an active 
agent such as an IGF1R inhibitor (1.3 months in one study), a single -stage design examining 
PFS at 8 and 16 weeks  will be employed for thi s cohort.   
   
We will take median PFS of 0.5 at 8 weeks as evidence of activity for this cohort, in comparison to an uninteresting median PFS (8 weeks) of 0.25. For this 30 patient cohort with these parameters, this yields a false positive rate of 0.05 (a lpha) and power (1- beta) of 0.91.  
 The response rate will be estimated and a confidence interval will be constructed.  A sample 
size of 30 patients and 50% PFS rate at 8 weeks yields  a 95% binomial confidence interval of 
(31%, 69%).   
 Cohort D  (Rhabdomyosarcoma: Fusion -positive alveolar, Embryonal, Fusion -negative 
alveolar) : 
 Since published estimates of progression free survival in rhabdomyosarcoma patients after more than one relapse are scarce, we will estimate the RECIST 1.1 Response rate (PR or better) at 8 weeks.  Cohort D will accrue separately to approximately 12 patients with either  of 
(1) fusion -positive alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and (2) embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma/fusion 
negative alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, and  will be analyzed as a combined cohort.  We will 
consider a disease control rate (CR+PR+stable disease at 8 weeks) of 30% to be evidence of activity, in comparison to a disease control rate of 10% as not useful to pursue further.   
 A total of ~ 12 patients will be accrued to Cohort D and ~ 12 to Cohort E, below. S ince 
funding is available for 24 patients in Cohort s D and E, the below are estimates of accruals, 
and the actual accrual will be used to define success vs failure for each cohort based on final 
accrual, maintaining similar disease control rates at 8 weeks (30% [active] vs 10% [not active]) for Cohort D, r egardless of final accrual total.  
 For a [ADDRESS_427159] disease controlled at 8 weeks, regorafenib will be 
considered worthy of further investigation in Cohort D.  A sample size of 12  patients will 
permit determination of disease control rate  of 30%  with 95% binomial confidence interval of 
(10%, 57%).

Copyright © SARC (Sarcoma Alliance for Research thr ough Collaboration)  
 Cohort E  (Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma ): 
 
Published estimates of progression free survival on chemotherapy for patients with metastatic 
mesenchymal chondrosarcoma patients  are also unavailable. However, existing data indicate 
the overall survival of patients with metastatic mesenchymal chondrosarcoma is  similar to 
those with unselected soft tissue sarcomas , in the 18 month range  (Amer et al. J Orthop Res 
2019, https://doi.org/10.1002/jor.[ZIP_CODE]) , so we will estimate the RECIST 1.1 r esponse rate 
(PR or better) at 24 weeks. Cohort E  will accrue to ~  12 patients with metastatic mesenchymal 
chondrosarcoma . We will consider a disease control rate (CR+PR+stable disease)  at 24 weeks 
of 50% to be evidence of activity,  as is the case with 1st line doxorubicin or gemcitabine in 
unselected STS (GEDDiS study)  in comparison to a disease control rate of 25% , as not useful 
to pursue further.   
 
A total of ~ 12 patients will be accrued to Cohort E,. Since funding is available for 24 patients 
in Cohorts D and E, the estimates of accruals, and the actual accrual will be used to define 
success vs failure for each cohort based on final accrual, maintaining similar disease control 
rates at 24 weeks ( 50% [active] vs 25% [not active]) for Cohort E , regardless of final accrual 
total.  
 The design is based on a Simon’s two- stage using only the first stage. A  12-patient cohort 
with a type I error  of 0.[ADDRESS_427160] disease controlled at 24 weeks, 
regorafenib will be considered a worthy of further  investigation  in Cohort E.  A sample size of 
12 patients will permit determination of 24- week disease control rate of 50 % with 95% 
binomial confidence interval of ( 21%, 79 %). 
 
12.3 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 
Enrollment in cohorts A & B is expected to be 4 patients per month per cohort, with a total of 48 patients per cohort e nrolled 1:1 between regorafenib: placebo. Enrollment is expected to be 
completed in 12 months  with a minimum follow -up period of 6 months.  
 
For cohort C, enrollment is expected to be 3 per month for a total enrollment of 30 patients 
over 10 months.  (Enrollment for this cohort is complete.)  
 
For cohort D , enrollment is expected to be 0.5 per month (1 each fusion positive, fusion 
negative types)  for a total enrollment of 12 patients over 24 months. 
 For cohort E, enrollment is expected to be 0.5 per month (1 each fusion positive, fusion 
negative types)  for a total enrollment of 12 patients over 24 months.

 12.4 Stratification Factors  
 
Patients will be stratified by [CONTACT_344239] ([0 or 1] vs 2) and by [CONTACT_344221] ( 1 vs 2 or more ). No more than 1/[ADDRESS_427161] will be used for 
analyses combining data across strata.  
 
Methodologies for time -to-event variables will include construction of 95% confidence 
intervals for each group separately and for the difference between groups.  For analysis, a log-rank test w ill be used.  Logistic regression and analysis of covariance methods on measured 
variables with baseline measures as covariables. Kaplan Meier curves will be displayed for time-to-event data.   
 
13. ETHICAL AND LEGAL CONDUCT OF THE STUDY  
 
The procedures se t out in this protocol, pertaining to the conduct, evaluation, and 
documentation of this study, are designed to ensure that the investigator abide by [CONTACT_23663] (GCP) guidelines and under the guiding principles detailed in the Declaration of Helsinki.  The study will also be carried out in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_39684](s) and regulation(s).  
 Documented approval from appropriate IRBs will be obtained for all participating centers before start of the study, according to GCP, local laws, regula tions and organizations.  When 
necessary, an extension, amendment or renewal of the IRB approval must be obtained and also forwarded to SARC.  Strict adherence to all specifications laid down in this protocol is required for all aspects of study conduct; t he investigator may not modify or alter the procedures described in this 
protocol.    Modifications to the study protocol will not be implemented by [CONTACT_344240], Bayer.  However, the investigator may

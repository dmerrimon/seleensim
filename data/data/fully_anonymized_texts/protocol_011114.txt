1) IRB Review History  
N/A 
2) Objectives  
 
Hypothesis : The introduction of nitric o xide (NO) directly into the cardiopulmona ry 
by[CONTACT_408638], during neonatal surgical repair of congenital heart lesions, will a ttenuate 
ischemia reperfusion injury that can complicate the surgical procedure and postoperative 
recovery.  
 
Specific Objectives:  During the Norwood procedure for hypopla stic left heart syndrome  
(HLHS)  or its variants, there is around 20 to 30 minute s of ischemia to the myocardium 
between cardioplegia doses, and 20 to 30 minutes of interruption of flow to the lower 
body during reconstruction of the aortic arch. The propose d study  will help to know if 
NO can decrease ischemia reperfusion injury to the myocardium, as well as to the lower 
body org ans (liver, kidney, gastro -intestinal tract) . 
 
Specific Aims :   
1) Evaluate whether NO delivered through the neonatal CPB circuit can d ecrease the 
clinical signs of ischemia/reperfusion injury and/or cardiac  dysfunc tion as 
reflected by [CONTACT_408639], inotropic support, diuretic requirement , length of 
ventilator support , length of ICU stay , and length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  
 
2) Evaluate whether N O delivered through the neonatal CPB circuit can decrease 
various biochemical ma rkers of ischemia/reperfusion injury and oxidative damage  
[cardiac troponin I, interleukens (IL), tumor necrosis factor  (TNF) , N-terminal 
prohormone for brain natriuretic pepti de (NT -proBNP),lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH), plasma anti -oxidant levels, plasma m alondialdehyde (MDA) levels ].  
 
3) Evaluate the safety of NO delivered through the neonatal CPB circuit as measured 
by [CONTACT_408640].  
 
3) Background  
 
Around 25,000 -30,000 cardiac surgical operations are performed on pediatric pat ients 
each year, and around 7500 of them are performed on neonates. These operations are 
made possible by [CONTACT_408641] (CPB), which allows for circulatory 
and pulmonary support while the heart is being repaired. Although life -saving, t he use of 
CPB is associated with a variety of adverse effects, such as systemic inflammatory 
responses, neurological insufficiencies, coagulopathies, and most importantly 
ische mia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Adverse heart -related events after surgically indu ced

Reperfusion Injury During Neonatal Cardiopulmonary By[CONTACT_408636] 3_6.3.16  
 
HRP -503 Template Protocol  Page 3 of 20 Revised: 11/08/13  I/R continues to be a major contributor to the morbidity and mortality after pediatric 
cardiac surgery. With the absence of pulsatile flow of the cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476], th e 
ischemia/reperfusion cellular injury is even more exaggerated in different vit al organs, 
like the heart, lung, liver, and kidneys. This is exaggerated by [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_408619]. This  is also more 
prominent in neonates because of the complexity of the heart defec ts requiring longer 
time on cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476], and because of the immaturity of neonatal organ 
systems. According to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons database, most of the  neonatal 
cardiac repairs belong to the Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Sur gery (RACHS ) 5 
and 6 complexity categories, with a national hospi[INVESTIGATOR_408620] 20% (1).  
 
The morbidity associated with inadequate cardiac protection suggests that new  strategies 
to enhance cardiac protection are needed. Recently, there has been m uch interest in the 
pharmacological conditioning of the heart to produce adequate protection during CPB -
associated surgically induced I/R.  More specifically, and at a cellular  level, recent 
laboratory data suggests that certain agents, such as nitric oxid e (NO), can protect cardiac 
cells against I/R injury by [CONTACT_408642]. The mitochondria are the 
energy producing apparatus in human cells. Thus, by [CONTACT_408643], one 
can protect the cardiac cell and minimize the effects  of surgically induced I/R injury 
during the repair of congenital heart defects.  
 
Ischemia/reperfusion injury and systemic inflammatory response syndrome are linked. 
After a p eriod of ischemia, reperfusion stimulate s the production of additional pro -
inflammatory mediators, in particular, reactive oxygen free radicals and cytokines by 
[CONTACT_408644], endothelial, platelet, and inflammatory cells, contributing to elevated serum 
levels of inflammatory mediators. Cell death results from coagulation necrosis and 
inflammatory mediator -induced apoptosis. Endothelial cell injury results in impairment 
of the NO -cyclic guanosine monophosphate signaling cascade and endothelial -dependent 
vasod ilatation (2). Alternations in NO generation appear to underpin the interrelatio nship 
of endothelial function and inflammation (3). NO might play several protective roles in 
reperfusion injury (4). NO is an important regulator of apoptosis, capable of both  
inducing and inhibiting apoptosis (5). NO has been shown to inhibit platelet ad hesion and 
aggregation (6) and is able to block monocyte adherence and migration (7). Furthermore, 
NO is an inhibitor of leukocyte activation, preventing neutrophil -endothelial  adhesion 
and the generation of oxygen free radicals (8).   
 
The use of inhaled NO as a pulmonary vasodilator agent in neonates is well established.  
In addition to its potent vasodilatory effects in the pulmonary vasculature, inhaled NO 
has also been show n to have significant peripheral anti -inflammatory effects. The safety 
of periop erative administration of NO via the CPB circuit has been described in animals 
and human beings (9,10,11). Inhaled NO during adult cardiac surgery patients has been 
reported to  reduce systemic inflammatory markers, attenuate endothelial dysfunction, and 
reduce ischemia/reperfusion injury (12,13,14). Administration of NO to adult patients 
undergoing cardiac surgery has been shown to blunt the release of markers of cardiac 
injury and decreases ventricular dysfunction during and immediately after CPB.

HRP -503 Template Protocol  Page 4 of 20 Revised: 11/08/13  A more  recent study in infants has also shown that the NO administration via the CPB 
circuit can reduce various markers of inflammation and reduce postoperative 
complications (15). T o date, there have been no such studies relating NO administration 
via the CPB c ircuit and ischemia reperfusion injury in neonates undergoing surgical 
repair of congenital heart lesions.

ischemia/reperfusion injury and oxidative dama ge. Markers to be analyzed wi ll 
include:  
o cardiac troponin I

Reperfusion Injury During Neonatal Cardiopulmonary By[CONTACT_408636] 3_6.3.16  
 
HRP -503 Template Protocol  Page 6 of 20 Revised: 11/08/[ADDRESS_515444] cli nical practice , and NO administration  will be adjusted 
accordingly , to keep  the methemoglobin level below 3 %.  
 
10) Procedures Involved  
 
Design  
The study will employ a double -blind placebo -controlled randomized  block  design . 
 
Sample  
Twenty -four neonates with HLHS or its variants requiring surgical repair in the first few 
days of life will be randomized into [ADDRESS_515445] Norwood procedure with a central systemic to 
pulmonary shunt or right ventricle to pulmonary ar tery shunt (Sano shunt). The only 
difference between groups will be the administration of NO via CPB.  
 
Standard Intra -operative protocol:  
After induction of general anesthesia using opi[INVESTIGATOR_858] (Fentanyl) and muscle relaxant, 
appropriate arterial line and cent ral venous line access will be obtained. Intra -operative 
monitoring of arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, systemic oxygen 
saturation, cerebral and somatic (kidney) near -infrared spectroscopy, will be done 
throug hout surgery.  
 
After adequate  positioning, a regular median sternotomy incision will be done. The 
thymus gland is resected for better exposure. Under full heparinization ( activated clotting 
time >300sec) , CPB is instituted using an arterial cannula inserted in the ascending aorta 
(or ductus arteriosus in patients with HLHS ), and a venous cannula inserted in the right 
atrium or 2 separate superior and inferior vena cava cannula s.  
 
Once on CPB, the patient’s temperature is cooled down to [ADDRESS_515446] will be aware of the randomization process and NO delivery.  
The surgeon will be blinded to group assignment . Group 1  (treatment gro up) will receive 
NO via the CPB for the duration of surgery. Once the patient is off CPB, NO 
administration via CPB will be discontinued and switched to endotracheal tube 
administration. Group 2 (control group) will be treated with a strategy identical to that in 
the treatment group, with the exception that they will not receive NO via CPB.

Reperfusion Injury During Neonatal Cardiopulmonary By[CONTACT_408636] 3_6.3.16  
 
HRP -503 Template Protocol  Page 7 of 20 Revised: 11/08/13    
For subjects in Group 1, NO will be  delivered using the Inovent Transport delivery 
device (Ikaria, Hampton, NJ) after calibrating the machine according to the 
manufac turer’s instruction. While setting up and priming the CPB circuit, the NO 
delivery tubing will be  incorporated into the oxygenator inlet gas tubing using special 
reducing connectors. NO sampling will be  performed by [CONTACT_1583] a luer lock connector to 
the inle t gas tubing proximal to the oxygenator and attaching the sampling line to it.  
 
Once CPB is initiated , NO delivery will be  started at 40ppm as measured by [CONTACT_408647], and maintained at 40ppm during the procedure unless the serum methemoglobin  
level  increases above 3%. Once the patient is off CPB, NO delivery will be  discontinued, 
and the subject will be  managed similar to control s. 
 
Post-surgical care  
After finishing surgery, all subjects  will recover in the Pediatric Surgical Heart Unit 
(PSHU) unde r the direct care of the pediatric cardiac intensivist and the surgical team. 
Neither physician nor nurse involved in the post -operative care will be aware of the 
subject’s randomization assignment . 
 
Data collection (see schedule  of events  below ) 
All patie nts will have the following pre -operative labs drawn before surgery  as part of our 
standard of care : complete blood count (CBC), complete metabolic panel, coagulation 
profile, and blood type and cross match.  
 
On the day of surgery, the following research related markers will be drawn in the 
operating room after the patient is under anesthesia and after insertion of arterial and 
central venous access  (Time 0) : cardiac troponin  I, NT p ro-BNP, p lasma (MDA) level,  
superoxide dismutase,  IL-6, IL -8, lactate dehy drogenase (LDH), procalcitonin,  TNF 
alpha , CRP and CPK -MB. These markers will be rechecked at the end of CPB  and before 
modified ultrafiltration (Time 1), after modified ultrafiltration (Time 2) , 12 hours  (+/- one 
hour)  after CPB  (Time 3)  and 24 hours  (+/- one hour)  after CPB (in the PSHU ) (Time 4) . 
The amount of blood needed for each research blood draw will be [ADDRESS_515447] radiography and the followi ng blood tests 
drawn in the PSHU  on a daily basis that includes: complete blood count (CBC), complete 
metabolic panel with kidney function and liver function tests, and coagulation profile.  
These tests are conducted as part of our standard of care.  
 
All s tandard of care lab oratory tests will be performed and billed in accordance with 
usual hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272079]. All research only labs will be shipped in batch to Immunetech  
labs and processed according to the appropriate procedures.  
 
Clinical data that will b e collected will include: CPB time and aortic cross clamp time, 
fluid requirement s, diuretic requirement inotropic support, ventilator hours , need to leave 
sternum open, ICU LOS  and total hospi[INVESTIGATOR_408621], transfusions, blood and coagulation

11) Data and Specimen Banking  
The data will be collected and  saved on a  password -protected  Excel data sheet  
which will be stored on the password -protected computer of princip al 
investigator.  
 
12) Data Management  
Sample Size Estimation  
Sample size estimation was calculated using PASS 12 ( 15) based on the 
number of subje cts needed to compare the difference in fluid balance as 
measured by [CONTACT_408648] 24 and 48 
hours for the two  group s. Power analysis was run based on published data 
that showed a difference 130 mL between similar grou p assignments . (14) 
A sample size of 12 achieves 83% power to detect a mean d ifference of [ADDRESS_515449] deviation of 60 mL  and with a significance 
level (alpha) of 0.[ADDRESS_515450] (EMR) p er 
routine hospi[INVESTIGATOR_408622] . Lab values of markers being collected for 
research only will be received in a report directly from the l abs. 
Investigators will extract study data from the EMR or lab results onto a 
source document for data collection and record into an electronic 
spreadsheet.  
Statistical Analysis Plan  
Data analysis will include measures of central tendency for all 
demograph ic and outco me variables. The primary endpoint of clinical 
indicators, including fluid balance, inotropic support, ventilator hours, and 
LOS  will be co mpared between groups using a Repeated Measures 
ANOVA with post hoc comparisons , Student’s t -test or chi -square as 
appropriate . A p -value less than, or equal to, 0.05 will be regarded 
statistically significant.  
Secondary outcomes to be compared between groups include the 
biochemical markers . Analysis will be done using Student’s t -test and a p -
value less than , or equal t o, 0.05 will be regarded statistically significant.

HRP -503 Template Protocol  Page 10 of 20 Revised: 11/08/13  The other indicators, n umber of adverse events (as determined by 
[CONTACT_408649]) will also be described  and reported as indicated in 
protocol Section 13.  Differences in adverse event rates wil l be evaluat ed 
using descriptive and inferential statistics as appropriate.  
Data Storage  
All information gathered during this study will be kept confidential. 
Subjects will be assigned case numbers and data collection forms that 
including the patient name [CONTACT_408667] [CONTACT_5051]. All data 
collection  forms will be placed in a confidential folder within the  principal  
investigator’s locked office. Tabulation of data will be stored in a 
password protected file within a password protected computer . The result s 
of this study may be published in scientific journals or be presented at 
professional meetings, but no individuals will be identified. The collection 
and handling of data will be in complete accordance with the HIPPA 
regulations. The research -related rec ords for this study may be inspected 
by a federal regulatory agency and the Institutional Review Board.  
Data collected for this study will be maintained for t hree years after the 
investigation is complete and the FDA is notified.  
13) Provisions to  Monitor the  Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects  
MONITORING PLAN  
The individuals responsible for data safety and monitoring will be [CONTACT_408669]  (PI). Quality control will include regular data verification and 
protocol compliance checks by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Elzein . 
COLL ECTION AND R EPORTING OF SAEs AND AEs  
Throughout the study, [CONTACT_408670] and the study research coordinator  will 
monitor study participants f or adverse events.  [CONTACT_408670]  will review all 
adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) individually and  in 
aggregat e on a biweekly basis.  [CONTACT_408670]  will report all AEs and SAEs to 
the Advocate Health Care IRB according to the AE reporting guidelines.  
For this study, the following standard AE definitions will be used:  
Adverse event:   Any unfavorable and u nintended si gn (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease, that did not exist at the 
time of the subject’s entry into the study and that is temporally associated 
with the use of the study medication, regardless of whether it is consider ed 
related t o the study medication.   
Suspected adverse reaction : A suspected adverse reaction means any 
adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused 
the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable  
possibility ’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between 
the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser 
degree of certainty about causality than an adverse reaction.  
PROTOCOL TITLE: Efficacy of Nitric Oxide Administration in Attenuating Ischemia / 
Reperfusion Injury During Neonatal Cardiopulmonary By[CONTACT_408636] 3_6.3.16  
 
HRP -503 Template Protocol  Page 11 of 20 Revised: 11/08/13  Adverse Reaction:  An adverse reaction  means any a dverse event caused by 
a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all suspected adverse reactions 
where there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event.  
Unexpected Adverse E vent:   An adverse event or suspected adverse 
reaction is con sidered “une xpected” if it is not consistent with the risk 
information described in this plan.    
The following list of medically important unexpected  events is intended to 
serve as a guideline for determining which condition may be considered 
reportable. The list is not intended to be exhaustive:  
• Renal failure  
• Delay of chest closure (i.e. > 7 days)  
• Surgical wound from study related surgery necessitating 
debridement  
• Sepsis (i.e. confirmed by [CONTACT_408650])  
• Delayed extubation (i.e. intubation period lasti ng > 3 weeks)  
 
Serious Adverse Event:   A significant hazard or side effect, regardless of 
the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_408623] .  SAEs will 
be recorded and reported using the INO Therapeutics/Ikaria SAE form  (see 
Attachment A) . A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence 
that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (defined in this case as an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event/reaction; it does 
not ref er to an eve nt/reaction which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe)  
• Requiring prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (i.e., > 4 weeks  
which is a typi[INVESTIGATOR_408624] ) 
• Results in persistent or signi ficant disab ility/incapacity  (e.g., stroke, 
seizure)  
• Required intervention to prevent permanent impairment/damage 
(e.g., re-intubation, ECMO, additional surgical intervention)  
AEs will be graded by [CONTACT_374982]:  
Mild :  An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities.  This includes 
transient laboratory test alterations.  
PROTOCOL TITLE: Efficacy of Nitric Oxide Administration in Attenuating Ischemia / 
Reperfusion Injury During Neonatal Cardiopulmonary By[CONTACT_408636] 3_6.3.16  
 
HRP -503 Template Protocol  Page 12 of 20 Revised: 11/08/13  Moderate:   An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with 
normal everyday  activities.  This includes laboratory test alterations 
indicating injury, but without long -term risk.  
Severe:   An event that prevents normal everyday activities. If 
prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_408625] 4 weeks, required for 
treatmen t it becomes  an SAE.  (An AE that is severe should not be 
confused with a SAE.  Severity is a category utilized for rating the 
intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as mild, 
moderate or severe.)  
However, relating the intensity of cli nical AEs to  functional daily life and 
everyday activities may not be assessable in children in the P SHU.  
Therefore, if not possible to assess, the intensity of clinical AEs will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_408651]/her best judgment.  
The study will  use the fol lowing AE attribution scale :  
Unrelated:   The AE is clearly related to other factors such as the 
subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs 
administered to the subject (i.e., another cause of the event is most 
plausible and/o r a clinically plausible temporal sequence is inconsistent 
with the onset of the event).   
Unlikely related:   The event was most likely produced by [CONTACT_374983]’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions or 
concomitant dru gs administe red to the subject, and does not follow a 
known response pattern to the study drug.  
Possibly related:   The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence 
from the time of drug administration and/or follows a known response 
pattern to the study dr ug; but it c ould have been produced by [CONTACT_374984]’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or

Probably related:   The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence 
from the time of dru g administra tion and follows a known response 
pattern to the study drug; and it cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_374984]’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or 
concomitant drugs administered to the subject.  
AEs will be m onitored thr oughout the time that a subject is in the trial  
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] ). AEs will be assessed through a review of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_408626] a weekly basis and with a physical examination of the subject, if 
indicated.   
REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS   
Events det ermined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_408627] 5 days per HRP 214. Adverse events that are determined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_408628]: Efficacy of Nitric Oxide Administration in Attenuating Ischemia /

be reported per IRB policy at the time of continuing review.   
 
An IND safety report will be reported to the FDA by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_408629], serious  and unexpected . All 
FDA reporting will be consistent with 21 CFR 312.32 (c). For each reportable event, 
the information to be recorded in the source document includes the nature, date, 
intensity, duration, attribution (rela tionship to study drug), action taken and outcome 
of the event.  
• Unexpected serious suspected adverse reactions will be reported to FDA as 
soon as possible but no later than within 15 calendar days following the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_408630].  
• Unexpe cted fatal o r life -threatening suspected adverse reactions will be 
reported to FDA as soon as possible but no later than [ADDRESS_515451] (DSMB) will perform a 
statistical review of the study data and will have access to fully unblinded* 
patient data if necessary, to ensure patient safety. The DSMB will be 
comprised of [ADDRESS_515452] will fu nction indep endently of the investigators.  AEs and SAEs  
will be monitored by [CONTACT_374986]* manner during the study 
after half of the subjects (N=12, 6 in each group) are enrolled . Subsequent 
safety reports will be completed after each set of 6  subjects.  
*A the randomization code will be kept strictly confidential.  It will be 
provided to the DSMB by [CONTACT_408652] s (Vincenzo Rizzo, Cindy Urbas)  to 
ensure patient safety.    
The i nterim analyses will be performed to evaluate differences in AE an d SAE 
rates between the two treatment groups, and to evaluate the primary endpoint 
(fluid balance, morbidity and mortality ). The DSMB will prepare a report 
after each review which will be given to the PI, and, in turn, this report will be 
submitted by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Elzein  to the IRB.  
The DSMB will be comprised of the following individuals:

14) Withdrawal of Subjects  
The FISH test to test for chromosomal abnormality is done routinely on all 
neonates with cardiac disease.  If the FISH test result is  abnormal after the 
Norwood procedure is performed, ind icating genetic syndromes, the subject  
will be withdrawn from the study.  
It may be possible that RV wall and endocardial fibroelastosis may not be 
evident on the pre-operativ e echo but that it would be identified during the 
operation. If this condition is identified during the operation, the subject will 
be withdrawn at that time, randomization will be unblended and the subject 
will be treated as if they are not in the study ( e.g. will not have extra study 
blood drawn).  
At any time, the attending physician can withdraw a patient from this study if 
they feel it is warranted based on clinical condition .  Parents will be notified 
by [CONTACT_30951]. The parents have the ri ght to withdraw their child  
from the study at any time.  If the parent decides to w ithdraw their child from 
the study, they will be asked if medical record collection can continue until 
the end of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Documentation of the conversation and their  
decision will be entered into the research chart and medical record.  
 
15) Risks to S ubjects  
We have been using inhaled  NO during and after surgery at our center for 
over [ADDRESS_515453]  practice, this  
level is checked with every arterial blood gas which is usually performed 
every 30 minutes while the patient is on cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476]. If the 
methemoglobi n level increases to 3%, NO administration will be decreased 
until methemoglobin  falls below this level . No other research -related risks are 
anticipated.   
After the surgery, subjects will be monitored for any adverse events 
throughout the course of their h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_408631] (Section 13 ). Approp riate medical care will be provided for any 
adverse events.

HRP -503 Template Protocol  Page 15 of 20 Revised: 11/08/13  16) Potential Benefits to Subjects  
There are no guaranteed benefits to any subjects in this study.  The results of 
this study will be used to enhance our understanding of the effectiveness of 
NO to p otentially decrease ischemia reperfusion injury that can complicate the 
surgical procedure and postoperative recovery and may benefit future patients.  
Potential benefits to t he subject  could include decreased ischemia/reperfusion 
injury and systemic inflam matory reaction that is commonly seen after 
neonatal cardiac surgery. This will be reflected by [CONTACT_408653] -operative 
myocardial function and preserved end organ function ( kidney, lung, liver), 
shorter intensive care unit and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_408632] m ortality and 
morbidity.  
 
17) Vulnerable Populations  
 
This research involves children as a vulnerable population.  Informed 
consent /parental permission  will be assured by [CONTACT_408654] g parents multiple opportunities 
to ask and have their questions answered about th e study before enrollment and 
throughout the study time period. Informed consent /parental permission  
documentation will be completed as discussed in Section 30. Subjects will  be too 
young to provide assent as they will all be neonates .  
 
18) Multi -Site Researc h 
The study will be performed exclusively at ACH -OL.

The Norwood procedure has been performed at our institution for over 20 
years. Our oper ative mortality varie s between 5 and 10 %; the national 
operative mortality for the Norwood procedure is around 16%. In the past, we  
perform ed between 20 and 30 Norwood procedure per year. During 2013, we 
performed around 15 proce dures with zero mortality. Our estimated period to 
recruit the 24 subjects  for the  study is 2 years (taking into consideration 
parents who decline participation ). 
[CONTACT_408671] and I (Chawki Elzein) are the surgeons who will be 
performing these surgeri es. Dr . Ilbawi ha s over [ADDRESS_515454]. 
Elzein  has approximately 10 years’ experience  with the Norwood procedure 
and the postoperative care of patients. The PSHU  is covered [ADDRESS_515455]. Andrew VanBergen, chief o f cardiac 
critical care, has approximately 7 years’ experience  with postoperative care of 
Norwood procedure patients. The perfusionists run the cardiopulmonary 
by[CONTACT_408656]. They have more than 10 
years experience with extrac orporeal circulation during complex pediatric 
cardiac operations.  There is  a back -up ECMO (extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation) team available in case of sudden postoperative  cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_408633].  In addition, Vivian Cui and Robert Metzger, Pe diatric Echo 
cardiographers will be performing the echocardiography on the subjects.

cost of NO use d in CPB during surgery, and th e cost of the serum 
ischemia/reperfusion and inflammatory markers , will be covered  by [CONTACT_408659].  
 
30) Consent Process  
Written  parental permission/informed consent will be obtained from each child’s 
parent or legal guardian prior to surgery  (See Attachment B - Parental Permission 
form and Attachment C – HIPPA Authorization Form) .  We will f ollow procedures 
outlined in  SOP HRP -090 to obtain informed consent/parental permission.  
The neonate remains in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_408634].  Parents  will be informed about the study by [CONTACT_408660] a clinical preoperative exam.  This exam 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_408635], and be fore the scheduled surgical procedure.   
The informed consent /parental permission  process will take place at the same 
time as obtaining consent for surgery. The consent for surgery is usually 
obtained 1 -2 days before surgery date. Only the study investigato rs (Chawki 
Elzein, Andrew VanBergen) will be involved in obtaining t he research 
consent .  Approximately [ADDRESS_515457] .  The person obtaining 
the research conse nt will clearly distinguish its difference from the surgical

ample time  to decide whether to enroll or not.   All questions will be answered 
prior to obtaining consent.   
Non-English Speaking Subjects  
There is a potential that a neonate  with Spanish speaking parents will be 
invited to participate in this study. In this case,  the Spanish short form will be 
used for consent with the English consent presented orally in Spanish with the 
assistance of an interpreter  (we have computer Skype based interpreters for 
over 10 languages are available at ACH -OL). In addition, one of the sub -
investigator s, Andrew VanBergen, MD , speaks fluent Spanish and may be 
available to present the study to any Spanish speaking patients. It is 
anticipated that this process may be used for  1-2 patients only.  
Subjects  who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers)  
All patients are neonate s with HLHS  or its variants. The Norwood procedure 
is usually perfo rmed at [ADDRESS_515459] one paren t before any study procedures are performed , though 
both parents will be encouraged to discuss the child’s participation . The 
mother will have to sign the consent form if the  parents are not married. If 
there are social issues and DCFS is involved in conse nting for the patient, the 
patient will not be enrolled.  
31) Process to Document Consent in Writing  
We will be following procedures outlined in SOP HRP -091. The consent for 
the research study will be documented together with the consent for surgery as 
a note i n the medical record of the patient.  
 
32) Drugs or Devices  
Inhaled  NO is a lready available and has been  used at ACH -OL for over [ADDRESS_515460] time that N O will be  administered via the

Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan  
Study Title: Examining an intervention to reduce underage DUI and riding with impaired drivers  
Clinical Trial registration: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]     
Funding: This study was funded by [CONTACT_211078] 
(NIAAA) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under award number R01AA025301  
Ethical Approval: Institutional Review Board at Penn State University, University Park, PA, US  
Document Date: June 8, [ADDRESS_252415] Traffic Safety 
Administration reported nearly 10,000 people died from alcohol -related crashes in the U.S. in 
2014 (National Center for Statistics and Analysis, 2015). This translates into over 1 DUI related 
death per hour every day of the year. The problem is further magnified when one considers that 
each year over 1.3 million drivers in the U.S. are arrested for driving under the influence (DUI) 
(Department of Justice, 2013). This results in over  3.5 thousand DUI arrests per day. As 
alarming as these statistics are they pale by [CONTACT_211079] 1 percent of the 121 million self -reported epi[INVESTIGATOR_211075] -impaired driving among 
U.S. drivers each year (Je wett et al., 2015). Drunk driving also does not only affect the driver. 
Almost 1 in 5 of all alcohol -related driving fatalities are passengers (NHTSA, 2011). Finally, 
youth under 21 are significantly over -represented in both alcohol -related driving and alc ohol-
related passenger fatalities relative to the proportion of all licensed drivers (NHTSA, 201 4; 
Shults et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2008). Together these statistics all underscore the need for 
immediate action to curb these alarming trends.  
 
There has bee n a wealth of research dedicated to identifying factors that influence DUI, riding 
with drinking drivers (RWDD), and under -age drinking to curb these alarming trends. Policies 
and regulatory actions that focus on maintaining the drinking age at 21, graduat ed licensing, 
sobriety check points, server training, and zero tolerance have all been shown to effectively 
reduce underage drinking and DUI (Hingson et al., 1994; Voas et al., 2000; Hingson et al., 
2004; Shults et al., 2001). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_120502], youth continue to engage in DUI, RWDD, and 
abuse alcohol before they are 21. This indicates a great need to effect change on their 
motivations and risky behavior through efficacious prevention efforts.  
 
The research proposes to move the field forward by [CONTACT_168486] a randomized controlled trial of 
MADD’s parent -based intervention’s (PBI) efficacy for all three categories of risky behavioral 
tendencies (underage drinking, DUI, and RWDD) on a nationally representative sample 
assessed at 3 -waves (baseline, 6 mo., an d 12 mo ). To the extent that the research is 
successful, it will provide an easy to implement and low cost alternative that can be widely 
disseminated to address this important public health problem.  
 
Objectives  
Three objectives for the research: 1) Evalua te the efficacy of the PBI (short and long term) ; 2) 
examine the mediators of the PBI that directly influence drinking, DUI, and RWDD behaviors; 
and 3) identify the moderators of intervention efficacy (the subgroups for whom the intervention 
is more vs les s effective).   
 
Study Design  
A randomized 3 -arm intervention (PBI, Surgeon General, Active Control) with 3 waves of  online  
survey data collection for parents (baseline, 6 -month, 12 -month), and 4 waves for teens 
(baseline, 1 -month, 6 -month, 12 -month).  
 
Recruitment Strategy  
The participants were recruited by [CONTACT_211080]. Parent -teen 
dyads who met inclu sion criteria were invited to participate in the study via email. Up to 7 email 
reminders were sent to participants who did not complete the survey initially.  
 
Study Population  
The eligibility inclusion criteria included: Parent – must have a teenager aged 15 -18 years old; 
Teen – must be [ADDRESS_252416] a parent/guardian agree to participate in the study. 
The exclusion criteria were: Parent – did not have a teenager aged 15 -18; Teen – was not [ADDRESS_252417] a parent/guardian agree to participate in the study.  
 
Participants were required to provide online consent to participate. Parent participants received 
a description of the research and Ipsos’ contact [CONTACT_211081]. Parents were presented a screen describing the research, their consent form, as 
well as a parental assent statement. Once parents provide consent, they were routed to the 
baseline survey; after parents provide assent for their teen, teens were a lso provided with an 
assent form, and then were routed to their baseline survey.  
 
Sample Size, Power, and Attrition  
Sample Size/Statistical Power: The sample sizes were chosen based on statistical analytic and 
theoretical considerations.  For example, for A im [ADDRESS_252418] final dyad sample Ns of 588 and 532 (and approximately equal n’s for our PBIs and control 
groups of 294 and 266) at the 6 and 12 month follow -ups, respectively. Using power estimation 
procedures describe d in Cohen  (Cohen & Cohen, 1983)  these sample sizes will yield power of 
greater than 0.[ADDRESS_252419] sizes (e.g., 5 -10%) in the MANCOVA -based analyses 
(omnibus tests, interactions, and planned comparisons). In our published papers with similar Ns 
comparing drinking for PBI and controls  (Turrisi et al., 2013; Doumas et al., 2013; Ichiyama  et 
al., 2009; Turrisi et al., 2009; Testa et al., 2010; Turrisi et al., 2001; Turris i et al., 2004)  we have 
detected effect sizes of .[ADDRESS_252420] sufficient power to ev aluate Aim 1.  
 
Attrition: We will first examine if the attrition is random by [CONTACT_12789] a dummy variable that 
indicates completion or drop -out at each assessment. The dummy variable will be correlated 
with key variables in the study (e.g., Group, drinking/DU I/RWDD outcomes). In the past, we 
have observed nonsignificant correlations suggesting that the attrition has been random and 
then used the most advanced multiple imputation techniques to impute missing data. We then 
analyze all cases with the imputed data  (Turrisi et al., 2009). Although we have not observed 
differential attrition by [CONTACT_211082], we recognize the potential. We will reduce 
this possibility by [CONTACT_211083] 12 -month assessment. Thus, all conditions will be identical except for the timing of 
intervention. However, if we should observe non -trivial correlations (e.g., > .2) between the 
dummy variable reflecting completers vs. drop -outs, we will include t he dummy coded variable 
as a covariate in subsequent analyses and attempt to interpret significant effects.  
 
Randomization  
Participants meeting the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to one of the three groups 
following eligibility screening .  
 
Intervention  
The study included two interventions (Turrisi’s PBI adapted for MADD; Surgeon General 
materials) and an active control (HPV materials). The PBI:  The first section provides an 
introduction to the problem of underage drinking, DUI, and RWDD. It pro vides parents with an 
overview of the problems, various basic facts, instructions on how to use the materials, and 
comments from parents about the consequences associated with underage drinking. It also 
helps motivate parents to talk with their teen by [CONTACT_211084] 
a difference in both improving their relationship and reducing their teen’s risk. The next two 
sections focus on developmental changes, relationship building, specific strategies that parents 
can use to improve com munication channels with their teen, and parenting types. The final 
section is an in -depth discussion of the risks of underage drinking, DUI, RWDD, and all of the 
major variables in the proposed theoretical network. Parental reluctance to engage in 
discuss ions is also considered. Discussion is provided of whom is most at risk, making 
agreements, specific strategies for talking so that teens listen, decision making, peer influences, 
and positive and negative reasons why some teens drink. This section also ad dresses the 
issues of alternatives to drinking, DUI, and RWDD, issues for discussion, and additional 
resources. Parents who were randomized to this group, received a link following the baseline 
assessment to access the materials. The Surgeon General: These  materials provided parents 
information on how to prevent and reduce underage drinking, with sections defining what a drink 
is, why underage drinking is a problem, the results of underage drinking, what families can do 
about underage alcohol use, etc. The Active Control (HPV materials)  provided information 
regarding the HPV vaccination.  
 
Measures  
Data were collected online at baseline, 6 -month, and 12 -month for both parents and teens. 
Teens also had a 1 -month follow -up. Ipsos provided demographic informati on on the parents 
based on panel demographics. Other measures included: DUI, riding with drinking drivers; 
alcohol use; intentions/willingness/attitudes/beliefs/norms to drink/DUI/RWDD; parental 
monitoring, permissiveness, modeling; intervention fidelity  (Chen et al., 2008; Hultgren et al., 
2015; Kann et al., 2014; Poulin et al., 2007; Abar et al., 2014; Mallett et al., 2011; Cartwright & 
Asbridge, 2011; Dhami et al., 2011; Collins et al., 1985; Dimeff et al., 1999; Marlatt et al., 1998; 
Turrisi & Jaccard, 1992; Grube & Voas, 1996; Beck & Treiman, 1996; Abar et al., 2009).   
 
Primary Outcome Measure  
The primary outcome measures were typi[INVESTIGATOR_211076], and declining to ride with 
impaired drivers.  
 
Secondary Outcome Measures  
The secondary outcome measure was willingness to ride in a car with an impaired driver.  
 
Intervention Variables  
Parents in the MADD and SG groups received a fidelity questionnaire to measure the useful, 
interesting, readable the sections of the intervention were.  
 
Statistical Analysis Plan  
Statistical analyses were performed using  IBM SPSS Statistics version 28. Each primary and 
secondary outcome w as examined using Tukey’s critical difference value to compare the means 
following Wilkinson et al., (1999) recommendations. This approach has been shown to have the 
most power and least Type I error rates with varying sample sizes to compare mean differen ces 
between conditions.  
 
Sample Characteristics  
Of those invited, 1,176 (28.5%) met the study eligibility criteria of being a parent or legal 
guardian to a 15 -18 year old adolescent teen and consented for both themselves and their teen 
to participate in the study. There were 562 (13.6%) participants who responded to the study 
invitation but did not meet the study eligibility criteria. Eligible dyads were randomly assigned to 
one of three c onditions: Active Control (AC; n=390, 33.1%), Surgeon General (SG; n=393, 
33.4%), or Mothers Against Drunk Drinking Parent -Based Intervention (MADD PBI; n=393, 
33.4%).  
At the T1 baseline survey, the average age of the teens was 16.33 (SD=1.09). About half of 
teens identified as female (49%) and most parents identified as female (54%). The majority of 
participants identified as White (78.2%), Black (8.7%), Asian (2.9%), Native Hawaiian or Pacific 
Islander (0.2%), American Indian or Alaska Native (1.2%), Mult iracial (4.1%), Other (4%), and 
Hispanic (26.9%).

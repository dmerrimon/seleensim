Study Design: 
This is an open label study to assess the safety and efficacy of CPX -[ADDRESS_805347] intensive 
therapy in elderly (age >60 years) patients with AML with companion cognitive function 
testing to determine whether this contributes to outcome in these patients. Patients may 
have received prior AML treatment with non -intensive regimens, e.g. hypomethylating 
agents, low -dose cytarabine, or lenolidomide, bu t may not have received intensive AML 
treatment with anthracyclines and/or infusional cy tarabine prior to enrollment on this trial.  
The cohort will include [ADDRESS_805348] and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment.  
 
Study enrollment is expected to be completed within approximately 2 years.

 1 General Information 
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted 
according to [LOCATION_002] and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 parts 11, 50, 54, 56, 312, International Conference on Harmonization and the Declaration of Helsinki), applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures.

2.2 CombiPlex
 Technology and CPX-[ADDRESS_805358] traditionally been designed empi[INVESTIGATOR_607755].  However, in vitro, where the ratio of drugs used in combination can be controlled, it has been demonstrated that drug combinations providing synergy at one ratio may be simply additive or even antagonistic at other ratios.
15  When individual free 
drugs are administered, each agent is handled differently by [CONTACT_10489], resulting in varying distribution of the individual drugs to tumor si tes which can result in drug ratios that are 
suboptimal or ineffective.  Jazz’s  technology is based on the findings that in vitro 
synergistic activity of antineoplastic drugs depends on specific drug ratios and that the in vivo activity of a combination depends on maintaining the synergistic ratio.  In this way, the development of a particular chemotherapeutic regimen can be based on the most efficacious ratio rather than empi[INVESTIGATOR_607756].  
The development of CPX-351 (cytarabine:daunorubicin) Liposome Injection was based on 
1) defining a synergistic ratio of the two active moieties, cytarabine and daunorubicin, using cell-based screening assays and 2) designing a liposomal drug carrier to maintain this ratio after intravenous administration.  This ratio was not based on the empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675]-derived, toxicity-guided regimens currently used for cytarabine and anthracyclines.  CPX-351 is a liposomal formulation of a fixed combination of the antineoplastic drugs 
cytarabine and daunorubicin. The two drugs are present inside the liposome in a 5:1 molar

 CPX-351 is provided as a sterile, pyrogen-free lyophilized formulation in 50 mL glass, single-use vials.  Each vial contains 100 units of CPX-351 where each unit contains 1.0 mg cytarabine and 0.44 mg daunorubicin base in liposomes.  The lyophilized cake is reconstituted with sterile water for injection to obtain a homogeneous dispersion at 5 units/mL.

available in the Investigator’s Brochure.  A brief summary of observations pertinent to treatment of AML patients, particularly those with co-morbidities and patients whose age tends of limit treatment to non-intensive regimens is discussed below.    The rationale for using CPX-351 to treat older patients thought to be unsuitable for 
treatment with intensive chemotherapy is roo ted in the characteristics of AML in older 
patients, the pharmacology and mechanism of CPX-351 action, and clinical observations 
 PROTOCOL #CEL11001 
CPX-351 (cytarabine:daunorubicin) Liposome Injection 25-JUN-2018, Version 5.[ADDRESS_805362] higher response rates, lower rates of primary refractory disease, and longer survival than patients over the age of 70.  This is associated with an age related rising risk of adverse cytogenetics and multidrug resistance phenotype.  CPX-351 packages cytarabine and daunorubicin within 
liposomes at a 5:[ADDRESS_805363] exclusively from patients considered fit for intensive chemotherapy and indicate a safety profile that is very similar to that of 7+3 chemotherapy except for more prolonged myelosuppression.  In the clinic the dose-toxicity/response curve appears to be shallow with most of the grade 3/[ADDRESS_805364] that treatment at the MTD (100 units/m
2/dose on day 
1, 3, and 5) is likely to be feasible, even in patients of advanced age and with some co-morbidities because the toxicities of treatment are mostly confined to myelosuppression and because supportive care with anti-infective prophylaxis is effective.  It is thought that 
full dose treatment is likely to maximize the probability of response and that response is 
possible even in patient populations enriched for adverse cytogenetics and multi-drug resistance phenotype.  The mode of action of CPX-[ADDRESS_805365] patients achieving complete response after one induction course of treatment with recovery from neutropenia usually within 5-7 weeks.   
 
Treating an AML patient population usually considered suitable for non-intensive regimens with CPX-351 is not without risk.  This patient population is expected to be older with some baseline comorbidities and cannot be expected to be as resilient as the fit older population treated in Phase II with CPX-351.  In that study induction mortality was assessed at Day 30 and 60 and a lower rate of early mortality was observed for CPX-351 treated patients (4/85, 4.7% vs. 6/41, 14.6% at 60 days, p=0.053).  This result is the best 
evidence that CPX-[ADDRESS_805366] in reducing the contribution of leukemia to the early death rate.  The greater myelosuppression and more prolonged neutropenia following CPX-351 treatment was associated with a higher frequency of febrile neutropenia (63.5% vs. 51.2%), 
grade 3 and 4 infections (e.g. bacteremia (42.4% vs. 22%)), and bleeding events (e.g.

The median overall survival for patients treated with CPX-351 in the study was 9.56 months compared to 5.95 months for patients receiving 7+3, representing a 3.[ADDRESS_805368] ratio (HR) was 0.69 (p=0.005) which represents a 31% reduction in the risk of death versus 7+3. The percentage of patients alive 12 months after randomization was 41.5% on the VYXEOS arm compared to 27.6% on 
the 7+3 arm. The percentage of patients alive 24 months after randomization was 31.1% 
on the CPX-351 arm compared to 12.3% on the 7+3 arm.   Event-free survival was also statistically significant in favor of CPX-351. The HR was 0.74 (p-value=0.021). The median event-free survival was 2.53 months in the CPX-351 arm compared to 1.31 months in the 7+3 arm.   
CPX-351 also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in induction response 
rate (CR+CRi of 47.7% versus 33.3%; p=0.016) and this significance was maintained for 
the analysis of CR alone (CR of 37.3% versus 25.6%, p=0.040).  
 
Thirty-four percent of CPX-351 treated patients received a stem cell transplant (SCT) 
compared to 25% of 7+[ADDRESS_805369]-transplant 
(HR was 0.46 (p-value=0.0046)). The median overall survival had not been reached in the 
CPX-351 treated patients compared to 10.25 months in the 7+3 treated patients. 
 
Thirty-day and sixty-day all-cause mortality favored CPX-351. Thirty-day mortality was 
5.9% compared to 10.6% and sixty-day mortality was 13.7% versus 21.2%. 
Grade 3-5 non-hematologic and hematologic adverse events were similar between the 
VYXEOS and 7+3 arms. 
 
On the basis of the phase 3 trial data, CPX 351 was approved by [CONTACT_607777] 60-75 with prior myeloid hematologic disease. 
 
 
2.5 Rationale for Assessment of Non-Hematologic Factors that Influence 
Outcome in Older AML Patients 
 
Treatment outcome of older AML patients is closely linked to the age of the patient.  
Data from the Swedish Acute Leukemia Registry confirms that patient outcome worsens 
with increasing age.  Presumably, the older th e age of the patient, the more complicated 
the disease: the biology of the disease is more severe in the elderly and patients have more

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 15 of 50  
 difficulty tolerating the consequences of chemotherapy treatment. Determining the fitness 
of an older patient for chemotherapy treatment can be quite challenging. The biologic age of an older person may differ significantly from the numeric age: there can tremendous variability in the fitness and function of older people at any given chronologic age after age 60. There is no scientific algorithm to assess the actual biologic age of an older adult. Adverse disease related prognostic factors are more easily measured. Older patients are much more likely to have adverse cytogenetics and unfavorable molecular mutations.  Older patients have a higher rate of multi-drug resistant phenotypes and antecedent hematologic disorders. The patient-specific prognostic factors such as severity of comorbid illness, fitness and social support are more difficult to quantify.  Many older patients have comorbid illnesses that may or may not be apparent at the time of leukemia diagnosis.  Drug metabolism is different in older patients and is influenced by [CONTACT_607778].  The 
elderly have deficits in immune function that make the tolerance of infections less robust. 
Patients often have diminished physical conditioning and endurance that may not be visible on routine physical examination.  In addition, numerous psychosocial factors influence the outcome of older adults with AML including cognitive decline, social isolation, and lack of a caretaker.  The patient-related prognostic factors are more difficult to measure and their significance may not emerge until after treatment for their leukemia has already been given.   
Through using the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) to evaluate elderly 
patients with AML, studies have shown that there appears to be a relationship between cognitive function and outcome in older patients treated for AML.  This study will explore this relationship further by [CONTACT_607779] 351. Klepin et al. conducted a study of 74 older AML patients 
treated with intensive daunorubicin/cytarabine induction and used the CGA to assess 
patients for chemotherapy fitness. This study demonstrated that impaired cognition (defined as <77 by [CONTACT_607780]-Mental State Exam) and impaired objective physical function (defined as an SPPB<9) predicted a w orse overall survival in older adults with 
AML.   Ritchie et al. (unpublished data) completed an analysis using the CGA to predict overall survival in patients aged [ADDRESS_805370] been sensitive 
enough to stratify the cognitive deficits in the population tested.  Alternatively, the level of 
family and social support given to these patients may be more important than cognitive function in the survival of older patients with AML.  Given that Klepin’s analysis of patients suggested that cognitive function is important to the survival of older patients with AML and that more sensitive testing may be needed to determine the level of cognitive impairment in this population, cognitive testing using both the Blessed and the MOCA will 
be used in this study to determine whether this is an important factor in the survival of older 
patients with AML.

CPX-351 (cytarabine:daunorubicin) Liposome Injection 25-JUN-2018, Version 5.[ADDRESS_805371] intensive therapy in elderly (age ≥60 
years) patients with AML based on safety and efficacy and to evaluate cognitive function in these patients and its relationship to outcome.  CPX-351 alone will be declared feasible if one or two induction courses (3 doses or 5 doses) can be delivered to patients with acceptable 30-day mortality. The primary efficacy endpoint will be overall survival (OS).  The primary safety endpoint will be early mortality defined as 30-day mortality.

elderly (age ≥60 years) patients with AML. Patients may have received prior AML 
treatment with non-intensive regimens, e.g. hypomethylating agents, low dose Ara C or lenolidomide, but may not have received in tensive AML treatment with anthracyclines 
and/or cytarabine prior to enrollment on this trial.  The outcome of elderly patients following intensive treatment with CPX-351 will be measured by [CONTACT_607781]/functional response.    
4.1 Patient Recruitment 
All patients will be screened for study suitability by a principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_11637]-
investigator prior to entry on the study.  An explanation of the study and discussion of the expected risks and benefits will be fully discussed with patients prior to the screening process in order for the patient to provide a voluntary written informed consent.  Only eligible and consenting patients will be entered into the study.

 4.2 Patient Sample Size 
Early mortality (30 day mortality) in newly diagnosed fit older (age > 60 years) patients 
with AML initially treated with standard induction therapy with daunorubicin and 
cytarabine is approximately 20%.  Older patients with AML who are less fit, particularly those initially treated with non-intensive regimens, are expected to have 60-day mortality of approximately 40%.  After [ADDRESS_805373] been treated and followed for 30 days or more, early mortality will be assessed.  If 30-day mortality exceeds 20% (>3 of the initial 
15 patients), all further accrual will stop .  Subsequent enrollment after the first 15 subjects 
should ideally resume after the safety analysis is complete, however recognizing the acute 
nature of AML, it might not be possible to deny treatment to subjects in screening for ethical reasons sufficiently long to evaluate safety or efficacy. In other words, if the 30-day mortality for the preceding patients is less than 20%, study accrual will continue during 
the DSMB’s safety analysis.  
  In the event that more than [ADDRESS_805374] induction: CPX-351 alone 
x CPX-351 at 100u/m2 will be administered on study days 1, 3 and 5  
 
4.4 Repeat of Induction 
Patients achieving aplasia/hypoplasia (<5% blast count) will not receive second inductions.  
Patients with reduced tumor burden and evidence of persistent leukemia who remain fit for 
additional intensive chemotherapy can be given second inductions up to 60 days (measured 
from day 1 of chemotherapy treatment) after the first induction treatment date.  
 Patients unable to achieve a response (CR, CRp, or CRi) after up to 2 inductions are discontinued from further treatment and followed for survival.  
Dosing for second induction: 
x CPX-351 at 100 u/m2 will be administered on days 1 and 3  
 
4.5 Consolidation Therapy 
 
Only patients with confirmed response (CR or CRp or CRi) and who remain fit for 
additional chemotherapy are eligible for chemotherapy consolidation.  Investigators may

4.6 Follow-up Phase 
Patients will be followed at monthly intervals or more frequently depending on clinical 
circumstances until start of the next salvage treatment, death or for 1 year from date of enrollment. Patients alive and in remission after 1 year will be followed annually or more frequently depending on clinical circumstances for up to 5 years from enrollment.  For EFS evaluation, events include: documentation of persistent AML after induction, relapse after achievement of CR/CRp/ CRi, or death.  Bone marrow assessments will be performed at any time during follow up when recurrent cytopenias raise the suspi[INVESTIGATOR_607758].  After documentation of persistent leukemia or relapse, follow-up for OS will continue. At the start of HSCT or non-protocol AML treatment of any sort or 30-days following the last 
dose, whichever occurs first, AE data collection will stop.   
 
4.7 Study Modification/Discontinuation 
Any modifications to the study will be documented in a revised protocol with a new 
assigned version.  The revised protocol will have an appendix which will detail the revisions to the document.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Drug Preparation 
The appropriate number of vials of CPX-351 (cytarabine:daunorubicin) Liposome 
Injection should be removed from the refrigerator prior to reconstitution.  Reconstitute with 19 mL of sterile water for injection using a 20 mL syringe. Do not heat CPX-351 (cytarabine:daunorubicin) Liposome Injection.  After reconstitution, invert vials gently 3-[ADDRESS_805399] for 15 minutes and repeat vial inversion prior to withdrawing drug for dilution.  The concentration of the reconstituted dispersion is 5 u/mL.  CPX-351 (cytarabine:daunorubicin) Liposome Injection should be diluted in approximately [ADDRESS_805400] be strictly observed throughout the handling of CPX-351 (cytarabine:daunorubicin) Liposome Injection since no bacteriostatic agent or preservative is present.  The infusion of CPX-351 (cytarabine:daunorubicin) Liposome Injection must be started within 4 hours of dilution.  Vials are for single use.  Unused material should be recorded as such and discarded according to institutional policies.  Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer drugs should be implemented. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Drug Administration 
The infusion of CPX-351 (cytarabine:daunorubicin) Liposome Injection will be performed 
through a central venous catheter, using an infusion pump to ensure that the drug is infused 
over the specified time period.  Non-DEHP containing administration sets should be used.  Do not use an in-line filter.   CPX-351 should never be given by [CONTACT_607783].  Administer CPX-351 over approximately 90 minutes via an infusion pump.  Flush the line to ensure administration of the full dose.  
The dosage (total units and u/m
2), start/stop time of the infusion, total volume infused, must 
be documented in the patient’s chart .

7.3 Dose Reductions and Delays 
It is the intention of the study to treat every patient at full dose.  Dose delays or 
modifications will be recommended at the disc retion of the treating physician and PI. Doses 
may be delayed due to toxicities (for example hypersensitivity reactions).  Any doses missed or delayed due to toxicity may be administered as soon as the patient has recovered from the toxicity. Toxicities will be graded using the CTCAE Version 4.0. See APPENDIX 4: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V4.0 (CTCAE)).  Toxicities for cytarabine and daunorubicin are relatively well known, and are outlined in the product information for each of these drugs. Furthermore, dose reductions or protocol closure will be considered:   
1) If >[ADDRESS_805402] 5 patients or >[ADDRESS_805403] 15 patients experience grade 4 toxicities, 
accrual will stop, the protocol reviewed, and dose modifications considered. If the incidence of grade 4 toxicity exceeds 20% of patients at any point after the first [ADDRESS_805404] been treated, accrual will stop, the protocol will be reviewed, and dose modifications considered. 
  
2)  If 30-day mortality exceeds 20% (>3 of the initial 15 patients), all further accrual 
will stop.  Subsequent enrollment after the first 15 subjects should ideally resume 
after the safety analysis is complete, however recognizing the acute nature of AML, 
it might not be possible to deny treatment to subjects in screening for ethical reasons sufficiently long to evaluate safety or efficacy. In other words, if the 30-day mortality for the preceding patients is less than 20%, study accrual will continue 
during the DSMB’s safety analysis.  
 
In the event that more than [ADDRESS_805405] 15 subjects dosed will be informative for determining need for dose reduction as outlined in section 4.2.

 7.4 Concomitant Therapy 
7.4.1 Premedication 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CPX-351 
Nausea and vomiting: 
Patients may be premedicated for nausea and vomiting according to institutional standards. 
 Hypersensitivity/Infusion-related reactions: 
Patients will not be routinely premedicated for hypersensitivity or infusion-related reactions initially during the first infusion of the first treatment course.  If the patient develops a hypersensitivity reaction then he/she should be pre-medicated at all subsequent infusions.  
Suggested guidelines for management of hypersensitivity reactions: 
 
Mild symptoms (e.g., mild flushing, rash, pruritus): 
Stop infusion and supervise at bedside with monitoring of vital signs 
Reinitiate infusion slowly (halving the rate of infusion) +/- premedication  
Moderate symptoms (e.g. moderate rash, flushing, mild dyspnea, chest discomfort): 
Stop infusion and give IV diphenhydramine, 20-25 mg (or equivalent) and IV 
dexamethasone 10 mg. Do not reinitiate infusion.  Premedicate on re-treatment.  Retreat at same dose and rate.  
Severe/life-threatening symptoms (e.g. hypotension requiring vasopressor therapy, 
angioedema, respi[INVESTIGATOR_402659], generalized 
urticaria): 
Stop infusion.  Administer IV diphenhydramine and dexamethasone as indicated above.  
Add epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (adrenaline) or bronchodilators if indicated.  Do not reinitiate infusion.  Do not retreat. Report as a serious adverse event.  If hypersensitivity or infusion-related reactions become a clinically relevant toxicity, then 
premedication for hypersensitivity reactions will be instituted with drugs, doses and 
schedule according to each investigator’s preference.  Additionally, a decision may be made to prolong the infusion time to two hours or more.   Permitted therapy 
Patients may receive ongoing supportive and palliative care (e.g. pain control) as clinically indicated throughout the study.  Infection Prophylaxis:  Prophylactic use of antibiotics, antifungals, and antiviral drugs is 
highly recommended during the period of profound neutropenia until ANC returns to 500/μL or greater. The choice of medications will be according to institutional protocol. 
Use of anti-infective agents as prophylaxis and treatment must be documented on the case 
report forms.

Growth Factor support: The use of growth factors will be according to institutional protocol 
and according to ASCO criteria.[ADDRESS_805406] be documented on the case 
report forms.  Transfusion support:  The use of transfusion support (RBCs and platelets) will be according 
to institutional protocol.  Use of transfusion support must be documented on the case report forms.  
7.4.2 Therapy that is not permitted 
Other anti-cancer treatment and other investigational therapy(ies) are not permitted during 
the Treatment Phase.  In the event of persistent disease or relapse the patient may receive 
other anti-leukemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_607764]. 
 
7.[ADDRESS_805407] not met the criteria for discontinuation 
of therapy (See Section 5.2).  Patients may receive up to [ADDRESS_805408] known to be alive. Patients will be followed for up to 5 years.     
8.3 Event-free Survival 
Event-free survival is defined as the time from study registration to the date of induction 
treatment failure (persistent disease), progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause, whichever comes first.  Patients alive and not known to have any of these events will be censored on the date of their last tumor assessment.

 8.4 Response Assessment Criteria 
During the Treatment Phase patients will be assessed for response according to the 
following criteria1: 
Complete remission (CR)
a Bone marrow blasts <5%; absence of blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; absolute neutrophil count 
>1.0 x 109/L (1000/ μL); platelet count > 100 x 109/L 
(100,000/ μL); independence from red cell transfusions  
CR with incomplete recovery (CRi)
b All CR criteria except for residual neutropenia (<1.0 x 10
9/L [1000/ μL]) or thrombocytopenia (<100 x 109/L 
[100,000/ μL]) 
Best Response See Section 8.4.1 
Treatment failure  
Persistent Disease (PD) 
 Failure to achieve CR or CRi; only includes patients 
surviving ≥7 days following completion of initial 
treatment, with evidence of persistent leukemia  (blasts in 
peripheral blood, extramedullary leukemia, or persistence in the bone marrow)  
Death in aplasia Deaths occurring ≥7 days following completion of initial 
treatment while cytopenic; with an aplastic or hypoplastic bone marrow obtained within 7 days of death, without evidence of persistent leukemia 
Death from 
indeterminate cause  Deaths occurring before completion of therapy, or <7 days 
following its completion; or deaths occurr ing ≥7 days 
following completion of initial therapy with no blasts in the blood, but no bone marrow examination available at 
recovery 
Relapsec Bone marrow blasts ≥5%; or reappearance of blasts in the 
blood after achievement of a CR or CRi; or development of extramedullary disease 
aBone marrow assessment REQUIRED to confirm CR. A ll criteria need to be fulfilled; marrow evaluation 
should be based on a count of 200 nucleated cells in an aspi[INVESTIGATOR_241771]; if ambiguous, consider repeat 
exam after 5 to 7 days; flow cytometric evaluation ma y help to distinguish between persistent leukemia and 
regenerating normal marrow; a marrow biopsy should be performed in cases of dry tap, or if no spi[INVESTIGATOR_170107]; no minimum duration of response required. 
bBone marrow assessment REQUIRED to confirm CRi. Some patients may not achieve complete 
hematologic recovery prior to initiatio n of consolidation.  CRi cannot be declared earlier than Day [ADDRESS_805409] percentages (5-10%), a repeat marrow should be performed to confirm relapse. 
Appearance of new dysplastic changes should be close ly monitored for emerging relapse. In a patient who 
has been recently treated, dysplasia or a transient incr ease in blasts may reflect a chemotherapy effect and 
recovery of hematopoiesis. 
 
A subject who is alive in a state of aplasia with no evidence of continued disease will be considered as having “no response.”  
 
The response of patients with no post-baseline bone marrow assessment will be entered as 
not done. 
 PROTOCOL #CEL11001 
CPX-351 (cytarabine:daunorubicin) Liposome Injection 25-JUN-2018, Version 5.[ADDRESS_805410] Response 
Patients who complete the induction(s) with a response of CRp or CRi may be upgraded to 
CR during or after consolidation if the patient’s peripheral blood counts meet the criteria for CR (ANC>1000/ μL and Platelets >100,000/ μL).  To upgrade a response to CR after 
peripheral blood count recovery, a new bone marrow assessment must be performed within

Only patients achieving CR or CRp or CRi are assessed for remission duration. Remission 
duration is measured from the date of achievement of a remission until the date of relapse or death from any cause; patients not known to have relapsed or died at last follow-up will 
be censored on the date of their last tumor assessment.

[ADDRESS_805412] a causal relationship with this trea tment. An adverse event can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. This includes worsening of a pre-existing condition or increase in frequency of a pre-existing condition. An adverse event is considered serious if it meets any of the serious criteria listed in Section 9.2.2.  To ensure no confusion or misunderstanding of the difference between the terms “serious” and 
“severe”, which are not synonymous, the following clarification is provided:  
 
 PROTOCOL #CEL11001 
CPX-351 (cytarabine:daunorubicin) Liposome Injection 25-JUN-2018, Version 5.0 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 31 of 50  
 The term “severe” is often used to des cribe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as 
in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infa rction); the event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as “serious”, which is ba sed on patient/event outcome or action criteria usually associated 
with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  Adverse events are to be recorded in the case report form from the start of the infusion on Day [ADDRESS_805413] dose, with the exception 
of serious adverse events. (See Section 9.2.2).  Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are all noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose that a causal relationship between the medicinal product and 
an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled 
out. An unexpected ADR is any adverse reaction not identified in nature or intensity in the 
current Investigator’s Brochure.  
 
9.2.2 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event that: 
 
Results in death (grade 5) Is life-threatening Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_607765] a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 
These events are to be reported as serious from the start of the infusion on Day [ADDRESS_805414] be kept with the case report forms at the study site.  Follow-up information should be sent to the Sponsor or its designee via the original Serious Adverse Event Form, re-stating the date of the original report.  Either a new Serious Adverse Event Form should be sent (stating that this is a follow-up), or the original one 
resent (with the new information highlighted and a new date provided).  The follow-up 
should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated,

irrespective of relatedness, causality, expectedness. The WCM research team will complete 
and submit the US-FDA Form 3500A (MedWatch form) to [EMAIL_6689]  
within 1 business day of the awareness of the SAE.  
  All AEs and SAEs will be reported to the WCM IRB per the policies outlined below:  All SAEs will be reported with an SAE cover sheet that documents relatedness, expectedness, and risk determination. SAE reports will be saved in the study’s regulatory binder. SAE reports will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_607766] (DSMB) periodic report.  The WCM IRB must be notified within 7 calendar days of investigator notification of an 
SAE when all of the following conditions are met, as determined by [CONTACT_9532]. These SAEs are considered “immediately reportable”:  
 
a. The event is unexpected – when its specificity and severity are not accurately 
reflected in the WCM consent document, Investigators Brochure, or package insert; AND 
b. The harm is “related” or “possibly related” –  where there is a reasonable possibility 
that the harm may have been caused by [CONTACT_607784](s), or interventions; AND 
c. The harm suggests that the research places WCM subjects at greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic or social harm) than was previously known or recognized. 
 
For events that are considered immediately reportable to the WCM IRB, the SAE report must be emailed to [EMAIL_11569].  AEs grade 3 or higher and all SAEs will be listed on the Adverse Event & IND Safety Reporting Cumulative Table and reported to  the WCM IRB at the time of continuing 
renewal.

 All AEs that are serious, unexpected and associated with the use of CPX-351 will be 
reported to the applicable regulatory authority (FDA in the US and to Health Canada in 
Canada).  The period we have to report the SAE to the FDA depends on the severity of the 
SAE, as follows:  
 
- Within 7 days of becoming aware of the SAE for fatal (Grade 5), life-threatening 
(Grade 4) events  
 
- Within 15 days  of becoming aware of all other qualifying SAEs (i.e.,

9.[ADDRESS_805417] (BOMC) 
This is a short six item test designed to evaluate older patients for early dementia.  The 
assessment is not affected by [CONTACT_607785].  The six-item Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration (BOMC) test was developed by [CONTACT_607786], Brown, Fuld, et al. (1983) from the longer (29-item) Blessed Information-Memory-Concentration (BIMC) test (Blessed, Tomlinson, and Roth, 1968). Katzman and colleagues (1983) selected 6 of the original 29 BIMC items based on a series of statistical analyses. The scores from each of the six items are multiplied as detailed below to yield a weighted score. Possible total scores on the BOMC range from 0 (all items answered correctly) to 28 (all items answered incorrectly). Weighted error scores greater than 10 are consistent with dementia, according 
to Katzman et al. (1983). 
10.2 Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) 
The MoCA test is a one-page 30-point test administered in approximately [ADDRESS_805418] is available in 35 languages or dialects. There are 3 alternate 
forms in English, designed for use in longitudinal settings.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 34 of 50  
 The MoCA assesses several cognitive domains. The short-term memory recall task (5 
points) involves two learning trials of five nouns and delayed recall after approximately 5 minutes. Visuospatial abilities are assessed using a clock-drawing task (3 points) and a three-dimensional cube copy (1 point). Multiple aspects of executive functions are assessed using an alternation task adapted from the trail-making B task (1 point), a phonemic fluency task (1 point), and a two-item verbal abstraction task (2 points). Attention, concentration and working memory are evaluated using a sustained attention task (target detection using tappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]; 1 point), a serial subtraction task (3 points), and digits forward and backward (1 point each). Language is assessed using a three-item confrontation naming task with low-familiarity animals (lion, camel, rhinoceros; 3 points), repetition of two syntactically complex sentences (2 points), and the aforementioned fluency task. Finally, orientation to time and place is evaluated (6 points).  
10.3 The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Leukemia (FACT-Leu) 
The FACT-Leu is a validated measurement of  quality of life parameters for patients 
undergoing treatment for acute leukemia. This questionnaire is standardly used in leukemia treatment protocols to measure quality of life parameters.  
10.4 Medical Resource Use 
Medical resource use (MRU) data will be collected for all study participants and analyzed 
by [CONTACT_607787] (overall survival and response (CR+CRp+CRi) for CPX-351. The MRU data collected in the trial will be used  to identify costs associated with planned 
induction and consolidation treatment and for unplanned medical interventions necessary for patient support. Specific MRU data collected will include but may not be limited to: 
x hospi[INVESTIGATOR_475377] (general ward and intensive care);  
x blood product support (PRBC, Platelets, other);  
x non-chemotherapy drugs (anti-infectives, growth factors, etc.); and  
x AML chemotherapy (induction vs. consolidation).  
 
11  Statistical Considerations 
The primary objective of this non-randomized open label study is to evaluate the safety 
and efficacy of CPX- 351 as a treatment for AML in elderly ( ≥ 60 years of age) patients. 
Dose reductions or protocol closure will be considered:   
1) If >[ADDRESS_805419] 5 patients or >[ADDRESS_805420] 15 patients experience grade 4 toxicities, 
accrual will stop, the protocol reviewed, and dose modifications considered. If the 
incidence of grade 4 toxicity exceeds 20% of patients at any point after the first [ADDRESS_805421] been treated, accrual will stop, the protocol will be reviewed, and dose modifications considered. 
  
2)  If 30-day mortality exceeds 20% (>3 of the initial 15 patients), all further accrual 
will stop.  Subsequent enrollment after the first 15 subjects should ideally resume 
after the safety analysis is complete, however recognizing the acute nature of AML, 
 PROTOCOL #CEL11001 
CPX-351 (cytarabine:daunorubicin) Liposome Injection 25-JUN-2018, Version 5.0 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 35 of 50  
 it might not be possible to deny treatment to subjects in screening for ethical reasons 
sufficiently long to evaluate safety or efficacy. In other words, if the 30-day mortality for the preceding patients is less than 20%, study accrual will continue during the DSMB’s safety analysis.  
 
In the event that more than [ADDRESS_805422] confidence intervals will be computed using the Clopper-Pearson method.  All analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.2 or higher.  Additional details regarding statistical analyses may be presented in a Statistical Analysis 
Plan (SAP). 
 
11.1 Primary and Secondary Endpoints 
11.1.1  Primary Endpoints 
In the CPX-351 cohort, the primary efficacy endpoint is overall survival (OS) as defined 
in Section 8.2; the primary safety endpoint is the 30-day mortality rate.     
11.1.2  Secondary Endpoints 
Secondary efficacy endpoints include complete response (CR, CRp, CRi, and 
CR+CRp+CRi), the relationship of cognitive f unction to treatment response and OS, event-
free survival and morphologic leukemia free state (as defined in Section 8).   Secondary safety endpoints include incidence of AEs and SAEs, laboratory measurements (hematology and biochemistry), vital signs and physical examinations.  
11.2 Sample Size and Power Justification for Primary Endpoint 
With 24 months for accrual, and a minimum of 36 months of follow-up, using a one-sided 
alpha-level of 0.05, a sample size of 30 patients has 80% power to detect a difference between the null hypothesis of 10 months median survival versus 16 months median survival in this patient population.  In regards to safety, with a sample size of 30 the maximum width of the one-sided 95% 
exact confidence interval for estimated 30-day or 60-day mortality rates is less than 19%.

Median survival and the associated 95% confidence interval will be computed using the 
Brookmeyer-Crowley method.  The estimated survival curve will be generated.  Estimates of 30- and 60-day mortality rates will be computed using Kaplan-Meier methods along with associated two-sided 95% co nfidence intervals computed using the 
Brookmeyer-Crowley method.    
11.5 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
 
Time dependent endpoints, such as remission duration (relapse-free survival) and event-free survival (EFS), will be evaluated using Kaplan-Meier methods; estimates of event rates will be computed and a survival curve generated.    
 
Binary Endpoints 
 
The response (CR, CRp, CRi, and CR+CRp+CRi) rate and best response (CR, CRp, CRi, and CR+CRp+CRi) rate will be calculated based on the responses achieved as defined in section 8.4. The number of patients who achieve response will be divided by [CONTACT_607788].  
 
Likewise, the morphologic leukemia-free rate will be calculated as the number of patients who achieve morphologic leukemia-free state, as defined in section 8.6, divided by [CONTACT_607789]-randomization bone marrow assessment.

20 APPENDIX 7: Anthracyclines Equivalents Guidelines 
According to the exclusion criteria patients  with a total lifetime anthracycline 
exposure exceeding the equivalent of 368 mg/m2 of daunorubicin (or equivalent) 
prior to start of study therapy [100 u/m2 of CPX-351 contains 44 mg/m2 of 
daunorubicin x 3 doses (1 induction) = 132 mg/m2 + 368 mg/m2 = 500 mg/m2 = 
maximum allowable limit of daunorubicin from all sources at the end of the 1st induction] are excluded from Protocol CLTR0310-301.   
  Conversion factor* 
Daunorubicin 1 
Doxorubicin 2 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962] 1 
Idarubicin 4 
Mitoxantrone 4.4 
 Multiply the number in the second column by [CONTACT_607801] a patient 
has received. 
 For example: 200mg/m
2 of mitoxantrone x 4.4(conversion factor) = 880mg/m2  
This means 200mg/m2 of mitoxantrone is equivalent to 880 mg/m2 of daunorubicin

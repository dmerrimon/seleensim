PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Title:  Utilization of Erector Spi[INVESTIGATOR_418687] a Multimodal 
Analgesic Pathway for Instrumentation and Fusion of 
Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis: A Feasibility Study  
Protocol Number:  2019_2131  
Protocol Date:  1/28/2022  
Sponsor:  Department of Anesthesiology  
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_418688] , MD  
Objective:  This study will investigate the feasibility and efficacy of utilizing 
preoperative erector spi[INVESTIGATOR_418689] (ESPB) to decrease 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_418690]/consumption and to decrease num eric rating scale 
(NRS) pain scores in pediatric patients undergoing spi[INVESTIGATOR_418691] (AIS).  
Study Design:  Prospect ive, randomized feasibility study  
Enrollment:  [ADDRESS_528151] Criteria:  
 1. Patients undergoing multilevel posterior spi[INVESTIGATOR_418692]  
2. Patients between the ages of 10 years old to 19 years old  
3. Undergoing  surgery for correction of AIS  
4. Patients under the care of participating surgeons: Drs 
Widmann and Blanco  
5. English Speakers  
Data Collection:  Sources: EPIC, Medical Records, and Patient Reported.  
Variables:  DOB, Race, ASA Class, Gender, Ethnicity, NRS pain 
scores at rest and with movement, Name, Cumulative opi[INVESTIGATOR_418693], ORSDS, Number of 
patients/parents agreeing to ESP B, Workflow issues in 
performing block: Time to perform, incidence of surgeon request 
to not perform, ability to perform bilateral blocks, Blinding 
assessment  (Bang’s Blinding Index), Cobb angle/spi[INVESTIGATOR_418694], length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], Patient/parent sat isfaction, 
Intraoperative variable: surgeon, anesthesiologist, surgical 
duration (time from incision -to-procedure end), anesthetic

• This is a feasibility study so power and sample size 
calculations are not appropriate. Classically feasibility 
studies use a sample size of approximately 12 subjects 
per group (Julious, 2005).  The primary outcome will be 
descriptive, and presented as number of patients/parents 
approached: number of patients/parents enrolling in the 
study . 
• Secondary outcomes for safety and efficacy comparison 
will be presented primarily in a descriptive way between 
[ADDRESS_528152] 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], incidence of opi[INVESTIGATOR_27277], and 
patient satisfaction. Continuou s outcome will be 
presented as mean +/ - standard deviation (opi[INVESTIGATOR_17023], time to first opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], NRS scores, 
patient/parent satisfaction). If results are skewed, data 
will be presented as medians (1st and 3rd quartiles). 
Normality of distribution will  be determined via Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152] -
Wilk testing, where significance of >0.05 indicates 
normally distributed data. Categorical variables 
(incidence of complications, incidence of opi[INVESTIGATOR_418695]) will be presented as counts and 
percentages. The balance of baseline patient 
characteristics will be compared between 2 groups using 
standardized difference.

Version Date: 1/28/ [ADDRESS_528153] common type of scoliosis (70% of all cases) with a 
prevalence of curves greater than 30 degrees to be approximately 0.2% to 0.3%. Surgical 
correction for idiopathic scoliosis is often indicated when the spi[INVESTIGATOR_418696] g reater than 
45-50 degrees as measured by [CONTACT_418718]'s method or if there is coexisting cardiopulmonary 
compromise. Curves necessitating surgical correction are particularly skewed toward 
females with a ratio of approximately 10:1.  
 Inherent to surgical correcti on is a significant amount of morbidity to pediatric 
patients including postoperative acute pain. Practitioners have utilized a number of 
analgesic techniques to treat acute postoperative pain including intravenous patient 
controlled analgesia (PCA), intra thecal opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], epi[INVESTIGATOR_44176], wound catheters, and 
multimodal analgesia. However, many of these techniques have either limited evidence, 
inconclusive results regarding their efficacy, or barriers to use (such as changes in 
neurological function) that  limit their utilization postoperatively. Nevertheless, any technique 
that utilizes opi[INVESTIGATOR_418697] (young, low BMI, females) population 
for further nausea/vomiting, which could delay recovery, prolong hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and 
decrease patient/parent satisfaction. To date, there only exists a single case report using 
ESPB for PSF in pediatric patients. Furthermore, the patients in this report were [ADDRESS_528154] (ERP) for complex spi[INVESTIGATOR_79477].

 The ESPB was first described as a regional anesthetic technique in 2016 (Foreo) as 
a mo dality to block both the ventral and dorsal rami of the thoracic spi[INVESTIGATOR_153315]. Since its 
initial account, there have been hundreds of case reports (Almeida 2019; Chin 2019), many 
case series (Melvin 2018; Singh 2018) and, some retrospective cohort studies  (Ueshima 
2019) in adult regional anesthesia that have highlighted its application to spi[INVESTIGATOR_79477]. 
Each concludes a significant opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -sparing capacity and improved NRS pain scores in 
patients who receive ESPB for a variety of spi[INVESTIGATOR_418701].  
 Within pediatric anesthesia, there have been significantly fewer reports using the 
ESPB for postoperative analgesia. Most reports suggest the utility of the ESPB for analgesia

of the anterior spi[INVESTIGATOR_418702], thoracic, and abdominal surgery (Wong 2 018, Patel 
2019, Hernandez 2018,) There exists only one recent case report of bilateral ESPB in two 
patients undergoing PSF for idiopathic scoliosis as a multimodal analgesic strategy for these 
patients. Given only this single case report, there is a deart h of evidence for utilization of this 
regional anesthetic technique in this patient population. Furthermore, this case is limited in 
suggesting the feasibility and efficacy of the technique given it was only reported on two 
patients.

2.0 OBJECTIVE (S) OF CLINICAL STUDY   
 The feasibility and efficacy of utilizing preoperative erector spi[INVESTIGATOR_418689] 
(ESPB) to decrease opi[INVESTIGATOR_418690]/consumption and to decrease numeric rating scale (NRS) 
pain scores in pediatric patients undergoing spi[INVESTIGATOR_418708] 
(AIS).  
 
1. What is the feasibility of performing bilateral US -guided ESPBs in this patient populatio n?  
2. What is the rate of recruitment to perform ESPB in this patient population?  
3. What is the rate of adherence to perform the ESPB in this patient population (i.e., number 
who receive the intervention and complete all assessments/ number who enroll)?   
4. Can patients be successfully randomized under the proposed study design?  
5. Can patients be successfully blinded to group allocation under the proposed study 
design?  
6. Are there factors that limit placing ESPBs after induction of anesthesia/prior t o surgical 
incision (including time to perform block, time to secure IV access and place arterial line(s), 
surgeon/anesthesiologist preference, and patient -related factors. These include OR work -
flow and timing issues, surgeon request to forego ESPB due to  OR delay, and the 
anesthesiologist's assessment of the ultrasound features that may preclude ESPB 
placement)?  
7. What is the incidence of complications for the ESPB in this patient population?  
8. What is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_58321] (in morphine equivalents) in the first 24 hours after surgery 
in patients who received ESPB compared to those who did not?  
9. What is the pain burden (in NRS, 0 -10) in the first 24 hours after surgery in patients who 
received ESPB compared to those who did not?  
By [CONTACT_418719], we hope to assess the feasibility of performing this block for this 
particular operation in this patient population. To date, there are a limited number of 
applications of regional anesthes ia for pediatric spi[INVESTIGATOR_418709] a comprehensive ERP. 
Further, the optimal block composition is unknown, and the study will help to define this.  
Utilization of this technique may demonstrate an opi[INVESTIGATOR_418710], which may have 
multiple benefits incl uding a decrease in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related side effects and increased patient 
satisfaction. If beneficial, the ESPB may become part of routine care for complex spi[INVESTIGATOR_418711].  
 Protocol Number: 2019 -2131  
Version Date: 1/28/ [ADDRESS_528163] of analgesic care for pediatric patients undergoing spi[INVESTIGATOR_418712] (AIS).  
2. Patients who receive ESPB will have lower opi[INVESTIGATOR_418713] [ADDRESS_528164] the block.  
4.0 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 Endpoints  
4.1.1  Primary Endpoint  
• The primary outcome will be the number of patients who receive bilateral, pre -
incision ESPB (i.e., the rate of adherence, as defin ed in Specific Aim 3, above 
and as number who receive the intervention and complete all assessments / 
number who enroll).  
 
4.1.2  Secondary Endpoints

screened),  measured after study end.  
o 2. Feasibility outcome: success of patient and Research Assistant 
blinding to  group allocation (based on Bang's Blinding Index, measured at 
24 hours after  surgery)  
o 3. Feasibility outcome: type and incidence factors preventing performance 
of block  (patient, su rgical, anesthetic, and/or work flow related barriers), 
assessed in realtime.  
o 4. Feasibility outcome: attrition (number of patients who enroll, but do not 
receive  the intervention and/or study assessments, and the reasons), 
measured and  reported in real time.  
o 5. Incidence of intra - and postoperative complications attributed to ESPB  
(interference with intraoperative neuromonitoring, infection, local 
anesthetic toxicity,  bleeding/hematoma, extremity weakness)  
o 6. NRS pain scores (after recovery from anesthes ia in PACU; and 8, 12, 
and [ADDRESS_528165] -surgery, and at discharge).  
o 7. Total opi[INVESTIGATOR_418714] 
(OME)  (over the first [ADDRESS_528166] -surgery).  
o 8. Time to first opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (oral, or via IV PCA).  
o 9. Incidence of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2495] d-related side effects (measured via the ORSDS in 
the first [ADDRESS_528167] -surgery).  
o 10. Patient/parent satisfaction with pain management (at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7954], via  Likert scale rating from [ADDRESS_528168] 
satisfaction)

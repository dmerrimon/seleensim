2.1 Objectives & 
Hypotheses  
 
 
 
 2.[ADDRESS_997951] the objectives .  
 
Outcome  measures  measured  in the two groups:  
 
Primary  outcome  
 
Time  to extubation  after end of procedure  
 West  Virginia  University  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_730642]  
(EMR)  to chart  the end of the procedure .  When the surgeon  states  
“We  are done” , always  at withdrawal  of the scope , extubation  
begins.   From  the time  we chart  end of procedure  to the time  of 
extubation  is the extubation  time .  The start  and end times  for 
extubation  will be recorded  in the EMR.  
 
The OR time  is billed  in [ADDRESS_997952]  a 5 min reduction  
in extubation  time  when  compared  to the combination  of 
neostigmine  and glycopyrrolate  (8, 11).  This translates  to a possible  
45.8 % reductio n (12, 13, 14).  
 
 
 Secondary  outcome s 
 
1. Subjective interpretation of optimal surgical condi tions as evaluated 
by [CONTACT_730647]  1 -10 ( [ADDRESS_997953]  surgical conditions)  
2. Hemodynamic parameters – intra -op and post -op. ∆  in BP, HR and 
CO2  from base –line and incidence /frequency of 20% change in BP 
from baseline vitals ( baseline= pre -induction vitals)  
3. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_108951] – intra op and post op  
4. Inhaled anesthetic concentration  intra -op 
5. Narcotics required intra op and post op   
6. Total OR time  
7. Time taken to meet ALDRE TE criteria in PACU  
8. Time to discharge from PACU  
9. Any adverse event and severe adverse events such as - hypotension, 
arrhythmia, hypoxia, stridor and re -intubation will be compared in 
both groups  
       2.1.[ADDRESS_997954] the clinical hypotheses .  
 
Hypothese s: 
 
Primary Hypothesis:  Use of Muscle relaxant and reversal with 
Sugammadex a t end of airway procedures will reduce the time to 
extubation after end of procedure  
 
 
Secondary  Hypotheses :            
 
➢ Surgeon will report optimal surgical conditions for ease of exposure  
➢ Have less hemodynamic changes in the OR  and PACU . ∆ in BP, HR and 
CO2  from base –line and incidence /frequency of 20% chan ge in BP 
from baseline vitals ( baseline= pre -induction vitals)  
➢ Decrease the amount  of inhaled anesthetics  
➢ Decreased narcotics needed intra -operatively  and post operatively  
➢ Decrease the total OR time  
➢ Subjects  will meet ALDRETE PACU discharge criteria quicker in the 
PACU  
➢ Subject will have less adverse event s and s evere adverse events su ch 
as - hypotension, arrhythmia, hypoxia, stridor and re -intubation.  
 
2.2 Background & 
Rationale , 
Significance of 
Selected Topic & 
Preliminary Data  
 Microlaryngoscopy and rigid bronchoscopy for vocal cord and tracheal 
procedures causes an intense sympathetic response during the procedure  
(1). Abrupt increases in heart rate, blood pressure can be seen in these 
procedures (1). Patients have to be extremely still for these highly stimulating 
procedures and hence have to be deeply anesthetized (2) (3). Ideal surgical 
exposure often depends on relaxation of muscles of mastication. Most of 
these procedures are done as outpatient procedures and many of these 
patients have significant co -morbidity.  
Deeply anesthetizing these patients can cause profound hypote nsion which 
can worsen the medical status of the patient and have longer PACU stay and 
can cause increased post -operative complications.  
Muscle relaxation with non -depolarizing muscle relaxants are rarely used in 
these procedures as the duration of action of the muscle relaxant is 
significantly longer than the actual procedure and time to  extubation from  
end of procedure is significantly longer than without using muscle relaxation 
or a Succinylcholine drip. (4)  
Muscle relaxants are synergistic with inhaled anesthetics, and narcotics. 
Hence, the total amount of anesthetics and narcotics used can be 
significantly reduced when combined with muscle relaxants if we are able to 
       fully  reverse the paralysis at the end of the procedure. (5)

following inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed. The subject must 
meet all inclusion criteria and no e xclusion criteria to qualify for  the 
treatment phase. The subject that does not qualify will not be included in 
this study . 
Inclusion Criteria:  
➢ Age 18 years  or older,   
➢ ASA physical  status  I-III 
➢ Ability  to give written  informed  consent.   
 
Exclusion  criteria:  
➢ Known  or suspected  neuromuscul ar disease/pre -existing  weakness,  
➢ Creatinine  clearance  less than  30 ml/min,   
➢ Bradycardia  of less than  40 beats/min,  
➢ Pregnancy,  breast  feeding  women,  
➢ Known  or suspected  allergy  to BRIDION®  (sugammadex),  neostigmine  
or rocuronium.  
➢ Patients  with  contraindicat ions towards  sugammadex,  neostigmine  
or rocuronium  
➢ Patients  included  in another  trial within  the last 30 days

Patients will be randomized, using a block randomization scheme, to one of 
the two anesthetic groups.  The block randomization scheme will use 
random block sizes varying from 2 to 6 patients per block.   Subjects will  
       receive a unique study id number (subject 1: i.e. 0001 -{3 initial i.e. A -B-C}).  
The randomization scheme will be developed by [CONTACT_30165]; the master 
list of study ids and reversal tr eatment allocations will be held by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_730643].  Strict adherence to the sequence of treatment 
allocations will be maintained.  
 
Group 1:  Inhaled anesthetics: sevoflurane at 1 MAC, remifentanil and 
intubation with rocuronium at 0.6 -1.2 mg/kg  (vitals maintained within 20% 
of baseline).  G roup 1 will receive reversal with neostigmine (0.04 mg/kg and 
glycopyrrolate (0.01 mg/kg)  
 
Group 2: Inhaled anesthetics : sevoflurane at 1 MAC , remifentanil and 
intubation with rocuronium at 0.6 -1.2 mg/kg  (vitals main tained within 20% 
of baseline) . Group 2 will receive reversal with sugammadex 4mg/kg  
 
Both groups will receive standard anti -nausea prophylaxis – Ondansetran 
and Decadran  intraoperative . 
 
After induction, the  amount of inhaled anes thetic and remifentanil used will 
be titrated based on hemodynamic parameters (maintained within 20% from 
baseline) and a BIS monitor.  
 
All subjects  will have TOF testing done every [ADDRESS_997956] (EMR) . 
 
At the end of the procedure patient wi ll be extubated when the subject  
meets the following criteria:  
 
Tidal volume : > 5 cc /Kg  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]: >8 /min  
O2sat > 95% ON 100% inspi[INVESTIGATOR_730644] 20% of baseline.   Extubation will begin when the surgeon 
states, “We are done”.  This usually coincides with the withdrawal of the 
scope.  The start and end times for extubation will be recorded in the  
Electronic Medical Record . 
 
 
The PACU nurses will evaluate ALDRETE dis charge criteria and make a note 
in the electronic medical records for the subject discharge time from PACU. 
The nurses in PACU will be the only evaluators of the subject who will be 
blinded to the two groups  
 
 
       Independent Data and Safety Committee Monitoring : 
Data and safety monitoring is a requirement of our institutional IRB (WVU 
IRB) and is standard for all clinical studies.  Independent Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee: Individuals not involved with the study will review 
the data and make re commendations to continue or stop  the study to the 
Principal Investigator.  
 
Following the WVU IRB Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Plan, a 
quality assurance audit will be performed  by [CONTACT_730648] C when 20% of the 
patients have been recruited (n= 17).  This audit will include, but not be 
limited to, the review of informed consent process, eligibility  confirmation, 
adherence to protocol procedures and treatment plans, pharmacy records 
and storage, and regulatory documentation.  Adverse events and severe 
adverse events such as - hypotension, arrhythmia, hypox ia, stridor and re -
intubation will be compared in both groups . 
 
No analysis related to or involving the primary outcome is required or will 
be performed at this time.   
 
ADVERSE EVENT ASSESSMENT : any unfa vorable and unintended medical 
occurrence, symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medical treatment of the subjects whether or not it is associated related to 
the medical treatment.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_730645] s. Adverse event s and severe adverse events such 
as - hypotension, arrhythmia, hypox ia, stridor and re -intubation will be 
compared in both groups . 
 
 
SINGLE BLIND: The  nurses in PACU will be the only evaluators of the subject 
who will be blinded to the two groups.  The PACU nurses will evaluate 
ALDRETE discharge criteria and make a note in the electronic medical 
records for the subject discharge time from PACU.

Subjects will receive a unique study id number (subject 1 : i.e. 0001 -{3 initial 
i.e. A -B-C}) if surgery is performed.  
 
Patients will be randomized , using a block randomization scheme,  to one of 
the two groups , as outlined in the Study Design  section .  Strict adherence to 
the sequence of treatment allocations will be maintained.   
 
Group 1: Inhaled anesthetics: sevoflurane at 1 MAC, remifentanil and 
intubation with rocuronium at 0.6 -1.2 mg/kg (vitals maintained within 20% 
of baseline).  Group 1  will receive reversal with neostigmine (0.04 mg/kg and 
glycopyrrolate (0.01 mg/kg)  
 
Group 2: Inhaled anesthetics: sevoflurane at 1 MAC, remifentanil and 
intubation with rocuronium at 0.6 -1.2 mg/kg (vitals maintained within 20% 
of baseline). Group 2 will receive reversal with sugammadex 4mg/kg

       resolution  or [ADDRESS_997958] treatment  by [CONTACT_730649] ( 16). 
 
A description of this clinical trial will be available on 
http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov , as required by U.S. Law.  This Web site will not 
include i nformation that can identify subjects .  At most, the Web site will 
include a summary of the results.  
 
 
Subject total : [ADDRESS_997959] enrollment is  12 months , publication and 
presentation of data will follow completion of data analysis . 
 
2.7 Statistical 
Analysis and 
Sample Size 
Justification  Power/Sample Size:  
 
All patients have a clearly defined time at which extubation begins  and end s 
(See Section 2.3, Study Design ).  There will be no patients with unobserved 
end points (e.g. no loss to follow -up, attrition, or right censoring).  
Additionally, the Data and Safety Monitoring does not require the analysis of 
the primary research question prior to the completion of the study (See 
Section 2.3, Study  Design , Data and Safety Monitoring subsection).   
 
Based on these considerations, powering for the primary outcome of 
extubation time used  the log -rank test , Schoenfeld’s method, and balanced 
allocation of patients to each group  (9-10).  With minimum power of 80%, an 
alpha -level of 0.05, and an effect size of 0.542, a total of [ADDRESS_997960] ratio.  An estimate of the  median extubation time for 
sugammadex is 6.4 minutes (8, 11) with a minimum differential of 5 .4 
minutes for the combination of neostigmine and glycopyrrolate ( i.e. 11.8  
min).   The 5.4 min differential is twice the differential between sugammadex 
and pyridostigmine (8), and is motivated by [CONTACT_730650]  (15).  
The anticipated minimal  differential has positive clinical and financial 
ramifications  (Section 2.1 Objective & Hypotheses).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Statistical  Analysis:  
 
       We will use univariate statistics (e.g. mean, median, standard deviation, 
interquartile range) to summarize  the collected data.  Balance  between the 
two groups for key patient variables (see Section 2.1 for examples)  will be 
assessed using a two -sided two -sample t -test using unequal variances and 
the Welch modification to the degrees of freedom.   For categorical variables, 
the Chi -square test will be used.  If non -parametric tests or exact methods 
are required, we will use the Mann -Whitney U test and the Fisher -Freeman -
Halton exact test respectively.  
 
The primary comparison of extubation time bet ween the two groups will be 
assessed using the Kaplan -Meier method and log -rank tes t.  Statistical 
significance will be assessed using a two -sided test  with an alpha -level of 
0.05. All statistical analysis will be  performed using the R software 
environment for statistical computing and graphics ( 7).

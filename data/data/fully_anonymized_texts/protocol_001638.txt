 1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Indication  
Pain and cognitive dysfunction remain common and distressing complications after surgery. 
For example, approximately 75% of patients report moderate/severe pain after surgery,[ADDRESS_127311] ic, reciprocating manner 
(Figure 1 ).4,10-[ADDRESS_127312], 75% of surgical patients report moderate -to-severe pain after surgery,1 
nearly 50% of patients report sleep disturbances perioperatively,13 and up to 70% of patients 
experience cognitive dysfuncti on after surgery .14,15 Acute postoperative pain and cognitive 
dysfunction are also as sociated with negative outcomes, such as increased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7947],16 persistent opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441],8 and prolonged cognitive decline.17,18 Opi[INVESTIGATOR_113843] a

UM HUM  # 00135919 
PROTOCOL VERSION #: 7.[ADDRESS_127313], recent systematic reviews found that caffeine provided 
significant analgesic benefit as part of a multimodal strategy in both surgical22 and non-
surgical settings.23 Caffeine also augments electroencephalographic (EEG) signs of 
arousal,[ADDRESS_127314] -dural  puncture /post -operative pain. A targeted literature review is provided 
below:  
 
Derry et al. , 2015 (Cochrane r eview) :[ADDRESS_127315] 50% maximum pain relief was 2.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.8- 2.5) to 2.4 (1.9- 3.1). Adverse event rates were similar between 
placebo and ibuprofen- caffeine groups, and no serious adverse events or withdrawals were 
reported due to the ibuprof en-caffeine combination.  
 
Basurto Ono et al., 2015 (Cochrane review) :[ADDRESS_127316] -
partum and non- obstetric surgery patients. No clinically significant adverse  events were 
reported related to caffeine.  
 
Derry et al., 2014 (Cochrane review) :23 The objective was to assess relative efficacy  of 
caffeine for acute pain, with surgical patients included as part of a diverse array of clinical settings  (i.e., surgical and non- surgical). Significant pain relief was appreciated at doses ≥  
100 mg, and no significant adverse events were reported related to caffeine.   
 
Steinbrook et al., 2013:27 The goal of this study was to determine if caffeine sodium 
benzoate (500 mg) reduced the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (primary outcome) . Caffeine was not found to reduce pos toperative nausea and vomiting. In fact, 
more patients randomize d to caffeine reported nausea in the PACU (26% vs. 10%,

 respectively, p=0.02), t hough there was no significant difference in vomiting, rescue 
antiemetics used, or nausea/vomiting over 24 hours. No other adverse events were reported.  
 
Zeger et al., 2012:28 prospective, double -blinded randomized  trial (N= 16, caffeine arm ) 
conducted in the emergency room for postdural puncture headache. I ntravenous caffeine 
(500- 1000 mg)  infused over 60 minutes/dose, 80% effective (95% CI 60- 100%) for treating 
headache pain.  No adverse events  were  repor ted. 
 
Yucel et al., 1999:29 prospective, double -blinded randomized  trial (N= 30, caffeine arm)  
conducted with orthopedic surgery patients . 500 mg caffeine -sodium benzoate (250 mg 
caffeine)  infused over [ADDRESS_127317] -spi[INVESTIGATOR_113845]. No 
adverse events  or side effects were reported.  
 
Weber et al. 1997 :30 this prospective, randomized, double -blinded trial examined caffeine  
efficacy in relation to postoperative headache and recovery time. Caffeine was found to 
significantly reduce postoperative headache compared to placebo (10%  vs. 23%, 
respectively, p<0.05) in patients at risk for withdrawal symptoms. 
 
Camann et al., 1990:31 prospective, double -blinded, randomized trial (N=20 , caffeine arm ) 
conducted with postpartum patients. Oral formulation of caffeine (300 mg). Significant  
improvement noted in spi[INVESTIGATOR_113846]. No significant side effects reported with caffeine therapy. 1/20 patients (5%) complained of mild/transient flushing and jitteriness after receiving caffeine, though this was the same proportion in the placebo group (5%).  
 
Jarvis et al., 1986:32 exploratory study, letter to the e ditor (N=18)  – 500 mg caffeine -sodium 
benzoate (250 mg caffeine) infused over 60 minutes, second dose if necessary. Significant relief in 14/18 (75%) of patients. No adverse events or significant side effects were reported.

2 STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
2.1 Objectives  
• A. Measure postoperative pain outcomes in surgical patients receiving caffeine 
compared to placebo . 
 
As described above, laboratory data from our research team demonstrate that 
preoperative caffeine administration blunted postoperative pain for up to six postoperative days.
[ADDRESS_127318] 
postoperative week, and validated pain meas ures (e.g., visual analog scale [VAS], 
behavioral pain scale [BPS] ), will be used to assess postoperative inpatient pain scores.  
• B. Compare the clinical effects of caffeine and placebo  on neurocognitive recovery 
from general anesthesia in surgical patients.  
Given that caffeine has been found t o accelerate anesthetic recovery in laboratory 
models,33 reduce low -frequency electroencephalographic (EEG) power,24,34,35 and 
improve cognitive performance across a variety of se ttings,25 we also hypothesize that 
caffeine administration will accelerate neurocognitive recovery following surgery and 
anesthesia. Our team will calculate anesthetic emergence time, characterize EEG 
patterns during em ergence and recovery, and perform cognitive function testing in the 
postanesthesia care unit (PACU). We will use the  validated  Trail Making Test (TMT), 
which provides information on psychomotor speed, visual scanning, mental flexibility, and executive func tion.
36 Such testing will be  suitable for the PACU setting. . 
• C. Compare the clinical effects of caffeine and placebo  on neuropsychological 
recovery after surgery.  
Depression has been identified as an independent risk factor for opi[INVESTIGATOR_113847], and caffeine is also associated with reduced risk  of depression.
37 Thus, 
we also hypothesize that caffeine will improve mood and reduce signs of depression 
postoperatively . Symptoms of depression will be assessed using the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_113848] (HADS),[ADDRESS_127319] Schedule (PANAS).39 To differentiate acute cognitive 
disorders (i.e., hypoactive delirium) from symptoms of depression, the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) will be used to assess f or delirium using our group’s 
previously described methods.
14,40   We will also administer the Quality of Recovery 
(QoR) Score in patients post -operatively. This strategy will provide a more 
comprehensive assessment of the effects of caffeine on postoperative 
neuropsychological recovery.

 3 STUDY DESIGN  
This will be a single -center, triple- blinded, randomized controlled trial at the University of 
Michigan Health System, and approval has been obtained  from the University Michigan 
Medical School IRB. The overall study flow is presented in the CONSORT41 Flow Diagram 
(Figure 2 ). As with our past studies, patients will be recruited at preoperative clinics, where 
informed consent will be obtained. Randomization methods will follow a  stratified 
randomization model to match patients based on age and gender.  Participants will be 
randomized with a 1:1 allocation ratio (placebo: caffeine) in a two- arm parallel design, and 
the randomization schedule and coding will be held by [CONTACT_113867][INVESTIGATOR_113849]. 
Prepared intravenous pi[INVESTIGATOR_113850] 5% dextr ose in water  or caffeine citrate  (200 
mg caffeine) will be directly delivered to the operating room prior to the surgery of enrolled 
participants. The dose of 200 mg was chosen for two  reasons:  (1) this dose is in -line with 
similar clinical neurophysiology studies involving caffeine34,35,42,43 and ( 2) this has been the 
intraoperative dose used for safel y preventing post -dural puncture/post -operative pain in 
surgical and obstetric patients.22,29,32 In these studies, no significant side effects or adverse 
events were reported in relation to caffeine. This study will fulfill CONSORT guidelines41 
for clinical trials as outlined in the following sections. Furthermore, this trial will be 
registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov  prior to trial initiation, and all study team members 
will be certified in Good Clinical Practice  as outlined by [CONTACT_18121] .

 Inclusion criteria: Adult (≥18 years old) patients undergoing non- cardiac, non -neurologic, 
non-major vascular surgery (i.e., below the diaphragm). 
 
Exclusion criteria: Emergency surgery, cognitive impairment precluding capacity for 
informed consent, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, seizure disorders, intolerance or all ergy 
to caffeine,  history of diabetes, preoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], pheochromocytoma, acute  liver 
failure,  enrolled in conflicting research study, pregnancy, breastfeeding, severe visual or 
auditory impairment (may hinder cognitive function testing), and patients unable to speak 
English. 
 
Perioperative and anesthetic procedures : Patients will be consented and enrolled at 
preoperative clinic location s, where  a medical and psychiatric history will be taken and  
baseline assessments will be administered  (described further below).  After enrollment, 
patients will also complete a caffeine intake survey to quantify baseline caffeine consumption. On the day of surgery,  baseline cognitive function testing (TMT) will take 
place in the preoperative holding area . Subsequently a 16 -channel wireless EEG system  
(Cognionics, Inc.)  will be applied to the scalp for continuous monitoring during surgery and 
the perioperat ive period. Once in the operating room, anesthetic induction and maintenance 
will proceed as deemed clinically appropriate by [CONTACT_108424]. At the beginning of surgical closure, the study drug will be given via intravenous infusion over 60 minutes (placebo  vs. caffeine, 2 00 mg) in a triple -blinded fashion: the anesthetic team, research staff, 
and patient will all be blinded to the intervention. Infusion of this dose over a 60- minute 
period has been safely described, without significant side effects or adverse events noted.

in place during the operation and emergence from anesthesia; they will then be removed shortly after PACU arrival. One hour after the caffeine infusion finishes , pain and cognitive 
function measures will be assessed.  
 
Pain and sleep assessments:  Inpatient opi[INVESTIGATOR_113851] (or discharge, whichever occurs sooner) (primary outcome) . Subacute opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556] (postoperative days 4 -7) will be calculated 
as an additional outcome. All opi[INVESTIGATOR_113852] (mg), and intraoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_113853] . Pain measures will include the 10 centimeter Visual Analog Scale (VAS )
44 and 
Behavioral Pain Scale (BPS )45 for subjective and objective pain assessment, respectively. 
Assessments will begin 1 hour after caffeine infusion has finished (once patient is in the 
PACU), and they will continue twice daily (mornin g and afternoon) for the first three  
postoperative days. Preoperatively, the Richards -Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ)46 
will be administered to determine self -reported sleep quality the previous evening. As an 
additional outcome, s elf-reported sleep disturbances will  also be assessed during these daily 
pain assessments  (i.e., from the PACU through postoperative day 3) .  
 
EEG data acquisition : Our research group  has extensive experience with EEG data 
acquisition and analysis in human volunteers47,[ADDRESS_127321]

 demonstrated feasibility with collecting w hole-scalp, 16- channel wireless EEG data 
(Cognionics, Inc.) in [ADDRESS_127322] and analyze 
data for the proposed study. Spectral power (decibels, DB) and connectivity (phase lag index, PLI) data will be collected and analyzed during anesthetic emergence and PACU arrival.  
Figure 3: Representative wireless EEG data from a surgical patient  
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Neurocognitive assessments : Time from surgical closure to anesthetic emergence will be 
calculated by [CONTACT_3476]. (minutes). The Trail Making Test  will be used to assess 
perioperative cognitive function. The TMT is a validated, reliable  test that assesses four 
cognitive domains  relevant to the perioperative setting : processing speed, attention, visual 
scanning, executive function, and working memory.36 The TMT is administered in a 
standardized fashion using paper and pencil  and takes approximately 5 minutes to complete. 
This is a feasible strategy in the perioperative setting to obtain comprehensive cognitive function data (e.g., attention, executive function)  in a relatively short period of time , and 
normalized population data are available for comparisons.
[ADDRESS_127323]  will be administered 
preoperatively  and one hour after the caffeine infusion has completed  in conjunction with 
pain assessments.  Changes (n) in standardized scores from ba seline will be calculated, and 
final standardized scores (n) will also be calculated and reported in the event that baseline scores are unable to be obtained (given the time -constraints present in the preoperative 
setting , it might not be possible to achie ve baseline cognitive function scores in all patients).  
 
Neuropsychological assessments : The Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS)[ADDRESS_127324] inpatient assessment on postoperative day 3. Scores ≥8 for the anxiety (HADS -A) and depression (HADS -D) 
subsc ales will be considered positive screens.

5.3 Drug Supplies  
5.3.1  Formulation, P reparation and Dispensing 
Parenteral drug products should and will be inspected visually for particulate matter prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Per manufacturer (Fresenius Kabi [LOCATION_003], LLC) package insert: Caffeine citrate injection is indicated for the short -term 
treatment of apnea of prematurity in infants between 28 and < 33 weeks gestational age . 
 Caffeine citrate injection, USP for intravenous administration is a clear, colorless, sterile, nonpyrogenic, preservative -free, aqueous solution adjusted to pH 4.7. Each mL contains 20 
mg caffeine citrate (equivalent to 10 mg of caffeine base) prepared in solution by [CONTACT_113869] 10 mg caffeine anhydrous to 5 mg citric acid monohydrate, 8.3 mg sodium citrate dihydrate and Water f or Injection. Caffeine, a central nervous system stimulant, is an 
odorless white crystalline powder or granule, with a bitter taste. It is sparingly soluble in water and ethanol at room temperature. The chemical name [CONTACT_113884] 3,7 -dihydro- 1,3,7-
trimethyl -1H-purine -2,6-dione. In the presence of citric acid it forms caffeine citrate salt in 
solution.  
 Caffeine citrate is supplied via vials that contain 3mL of solution at a concentration of 20 mg/mL caffeine citrate (60 mg/vial) equivalent to 10 mg/mL caffeine base (30 mg/vial).  
5.3.2  Drug Storage and Drug Accountability  
Caffeine citrate injection , USP (NDC [ZIP_CODE]- 407-03), is stored at 20- 25 degrees Celsius (68-
77 degrees Fahrenheit) in 3 mL single -dose vials. The drug will be stored in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_113855].

 5.4 Concomitant medications  
No other study drugs will be given. Participants will receive medications as clinically 
indicated by [CONTACT_113870].  
6 STUDY PROCEDURES  
6.1 Screening Visit   
For initial screening visits, patients will be seen  during preoperative clinic visits. The study 
coordinator will review the study details with potential participants, and informed consent will be obtained after confirming eligibility criteria are met. Depending on when a preoperative clinic visit is scheduled in relation to surgery, the timeframe from enrollment to drug administration may vary significantly (days -to-weeks).  The goal wi ll be to recruit 
patients whose surgeries are scheduled for the morning, so as to minimize the likelihood of administering caffeine late in the afternoon. See “Schedule of Activities” for full list of 
procedures that will occur at this visit  and all subsequent visits . Assessments, testing, and 
measures are described in detail in the above “Study Design” section . 
6.2 Treatment Study Period 
6.2.1  Visit 1 (Day 1)  
As outlined in the above protocol, visit 1 (day 1) will be the day of scheduled surgery. During this time,  a preoperative pregnancy test will first be drawn as clinically indicated. 
Vitals will be taken throughout the perioperative period per clinical guidelines and protocols. The RCSQ will be administered to assess sleep quality the prior evening. Baseline Trail Making Test (TMT) scores will be collected.  The wireless  EEG cap will  then  be placed 
preoperatively , and EEG monitoring will then commence perioperatively under supervision 
of the study team. A member of the study team will then receive the  study drug from the 
research pharmacy, which will prepare the drug per block randomization protocol. The study team will then administer this during (one -hour infusion) at the beginning of surgical 
closure. The EEG cap will be removed after postanesthesia  care unit  (PACU)  arrival, and 
one hour after the infusion has finished, the study team will perform  the designated research 
study assessments (i.e ., pain assessments , cognitive function testing , and Quality of 
Recovery (QoR) questionnaire ). Intraoperative  and PACU opi[INVESTIGATOR_113856].  
6.2.2  Visit s 2 – 4 (Postoperative Days 1-3 ) 
Morning and afternoon pain (VAS, BPS ), delirium,  sleep disturbance , and caffeine intake 
assessments will be taken . Opi[INVESTIGATOR_113857], and 
adverse events will also be recorded.  Vitals will be recorded per clinical protocol on each 
respective ward/ICU.  On postoperative day one, QoR will be collected. On postoperative 
day three, follow -up inpatient HADS and PANAS assessments will take place  to assess 
depression, anxiety, and affect.

 8 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
 
Adverse Event Definition  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject participating in an 
investigational study or protocol regardless of causality assessment.  An adverse event can be an unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, syndrome or disease associated with or occurring during the use of an investigational product whether or not considered related t o the investigational product. 
 These events may be:  
 a. Definitely related:  clearly associated with study drug/treatment  
b. Probably related:  likely associated with study drug/treatment 
c. Possibly related :  may be associated with study drug or other treatment  
d. Unlikely to be related , or 
e. Definitely not related  to the study drug/treatment  
 For reporting purposes, an AE should be regarded as definitely or probably related to the regimen if the investigator believes that at least one of following criteria are met:  
 a. There is a clinically plau sible time sequence between onset of the AE and the administration 
of the study drug or treatment. b. There is a biologically plausible mechanism for the study drug or treatment causing or 
contributing to the AE. c. The AE cannot be attributed solely to concurrent/underlying illness, other drugs, or 
procedures.  
d. A potential alternative cause does not exist. 
 Serious Adverse E vents (SAE):   An adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results 
in any of the following outcomes:  
 a. Death  
b. A life -threa tening adverse drug experience  
c. Inpatient h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
d. A persistent or significant disability &/or incapacity  
e. A congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. A serious adverse experience includes any experience that is fatal or immediately life threatening, results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, requires or prolongs in- patient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or is a congenital  anomaly, cancer, or overdose.  
Other important medical events that may not result in death, not be life -threatening, or not 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse experience when, based upon 
Phillip Vlisides, MD.  
UM HUM  # 00135919 
PROTOCOL VERSION #: 7.[ADDRESS_127329]/patient and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed previously. 
 
Expected  adverse events are those adverse events that are listed in the protocol, the  study drug 
labeling or in the study informed consent document. 
 
Unexpected adverse events are those that:  
 
a. are not described in the labeling  as far as the study drug is  concerned.  
b. are not anticipated in the study informed consent.  This includes adverse events for which 
the specificity or severity is not consistent with the descr iption in the informed consent.  
 
Unanticipated problem:  Per FDA Procedural Guidance for Cl inical Investigators, Sponsors, and 
IRBs ( January 2009) , A serious problem that has implications for the conduct of the study 
(requiring a significant and usually safety- related, change in the protocol such as revising 
inclusion/exclusion criteria or inclu ding a new monitoring requirement, informed consent or 
investigator’s brochure).  
 
Unanticipated problem Reporting:  Per 21 CFR 312.66, 312.53 (c)(1)(vii), and 56.108(b)(1) , 
should an Unanticipated problem occur during the investigation, the investigator wil l 
promptly report all unanticipated problems involving risks to human subjects or others to 
IRBMED /FDA.  
  
The severity or grade of an adverse event may be measured using the following definitions:  
 
Mild:   Noticeable to the subject,  but does not interfere with subject’s expected daily activities, 
usually does not require additional therapy or intervention, dose reduction, or discontinuation of the study. 
 
Moderate:   Interferes with the subject’s expected daily activities, may require some additional 
therapy or intervention but does not require discontinuation of the study. 
 
Severe:  Extremely limits the subject’s daily activ ities and may require discontinuation of study 
therapy, and/or additional treatment or intervention to resolve.  
 
Event reporting:   The study will comply with the IRB & FDA reporting requirements and 
guidelines.

 9 DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS  
9.[ADDRESS_127330] to CNS involvement in the pain processing summarized by [CONTACT_113871] (FM) . Acute opi[INVESTIGATOR_113860]1 varied between 0.7 and 6.5 (mean OME) with 
the standard deviation varying 3- 18, dependent on the tertile of the FM score. Based on 
these data we hypothesize that caffeine affecting the pain processing system can show a difference as large as 0.[ADDRESS_127331] deviations of 3 and 10, respectively. This will give us the power of 83% , with a sample size of 60, to detect the difference by a two -sided t -
test with unequal variances. We note that the opi[INVESTIGATOR_113861], while approximately normal are a rather crude summary of the difference in the OME distribution by [CONTACT_19313]. We therefore consider the above calculation conservative. The expected reserves of power a ttained through the use of 
the appropriate longitudinal model (see Analysis of Primary Endpoint ) will be used to lend 
more power to secondary regression and causal analyses involving explanatory variables and potential mediators.  We expect a ~10% drop -out rate, and will continue recruitment until the 
full [ADDRESS_127332] been recruited (after drop- out). 
9.2 Data  Analysi s 
9.2.1  Analysis Populations  
All analyses will come from the same surgical population (adults ≥ 18 years of age, presenting for major non -cardiac, no n-neurologic, non- vascular surgery).  
9.2.2  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques such as histograms, QQ -Plots, box- plots, 
scatterplots and basic descriptive (means, medians, IQR) will be used to assess the distribution of dependent measures. These will be used to identify the distribution of outcomes which in turn will be conductive to determining the appropriate analysis  strategies. 
In addition, these techniques will also be used to explore the most informative transformation s of the covariates, confounders and relevant predictors considered in the 
analysis. Extreme values will be determined and their removal from the analysis will be determined. Missing patterns and rates will be assessed.  However, missing data for the 
primar y outcome are unanticipated given the availability of inpatient medication 
administration records. If patterns and MAR and rates are <20%, complete case analysis will 
be considered. If rates are >20% multiple imputation techniques will be used to complete the data. All variables included in the analysis (outcome, covariates, predictors, confounders) as well as other auxiliary variables should be included in the imputation process. In addition, multicollinearity will be assessed using Pearson’s correlation c oefficient and Variance 
Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis. Predictors with VIF>10 will not be included in the multivariable models.

 Potential selection bias will be investigated comparing demographics, confounders and 
relevant predictors by [CONTACT_113872]. Unbalanced distributions of confounders and relevant predictors will be determined with standardized differences (SD). Measures with SD>0.1 will be included in the multivariable models.  
9.2.3  Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
A generalized linear mixed mode l will be the primary analytic tool with appropriate data -
driven choice of the link function. Linear regression will be used for assessing cumulative opi[INVESTIGATOR_113862]. A separate  analysis will entail  
longitudinal modeling with repeated  oral morphine equivalent ( OME ) measurements ( i.e., 
we will analyze multiple points of the OME curve simultaneously ). A Gaussian subject -
specific intercept term will be included to model between -subject differences and the 
associated correlati on structure. The Time variable (main effect, baseline, PACU, POD1 -3) 
will be used to model the pattern of the respective outcome variable (response) over time in the placebo group. The Group variable (an indicator of the caffeine group, main effect) is an  
indicator of whether the subject received the caffeine intervention . The Group by [CONTACT_113873]. placebo as far as the pattern of response over time is concerned. Final results will be assessed based on the  best model 
selected using Likelihood Ratio tests and Akaike Information Criteria (AIC).  In addition to 
the model specified above, a models will be constructed a) containing the above group and time specification with the addition of demographic variables and b) containing (a) with the 
addition of intraoperative factors.  
9.2.4  Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
For secondary endpoints, continuous data will be analyzed using Student’s t -test or Mann -
Whitney U test, as appropriate. Categorical data will be analyzed using chi -squared or 
Fisher’s Exact tests, as appropriate.  Modeling will be performed similar to the above 
primary endpoint description if appropriate.

Title of Study: A Phase 3, Multi -Center, Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo- Controlled, 
Study of Fostamatinib Disodium in the Treatment of Warm Antibody Autoimmune Hemolytic 
Anemia  
Objectives:  
• The primary objective of this study is to compare the proportion of  warm antibody 
autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA) subjects who achieve a durable hemoglobin response between the fostamatinib and pla cebo groups .  
• The secondary objective s of this study are:  
1. To compare the proportion of subjects with hemoglobin response on at least one visit between the fostamatinib and placebo groups. 
2. To compare the proportion of subjects who achieve a change from Base line in 
hemoglobin level of ≥  2 g/dL between the fostamatinib and placebo groups. 
3. To compare the change in hemoglobin value from Baseline to the End of Treatment between the fostamatinib and placebo groups .  
4. To compare the proportion of subjects who use permitted rescue medications after Week 4 between the fostamatinib and placebo groups.  
5. To compare the c hange from Baseline to Week 24 in Functional Assessment of 
Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue scale (FACIT -F). 
• The safety objective is to assess the safet y of fostamatinib in subjects with wAIHA.  
• Additional efficacy and pharmacoeconomic objectives will compare the fostamatinib 
and placebo groups for the endpoints noted in Section  4.5. 
Methodology:  
This is a Phase 3 multi -center, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, parallel group 
study to investigate the efficacy of 24  weeks of treatment with fostamatinib (R 935788) vs. 
placebo in achieving a durable hemoglobin response  in subjects with wAIHA who have failed 
at least one prior treatment regimen.  
After qualifying for the study, approximately 90 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 
of 2 treatment groups:  fostamatinib 100 mg by [CONTACT_1966] ( PO) twice daily ( bid), or matching 
placebo. Subjects will self -administer the study drug in the morning and evening throughout 
the 24- week treatment period. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_250205] (≥20 vs. <20 mg daily) and by [CONTACT_250206] (hemoglobin 
<9 vs. ≥9  g/dL).

Group  Number of 
Subjects  Study Drug  Regimen  
A 45 Placebo  bid (morning and evening)  
B 45 Fostamatinib  bid (morning and evening)  
• Starting at Week 4, the initial fostamatinib dose of [ADDRESS_304020] 
adequately tolerated the study drug in the investigator’s judgment.  
• The dose may be reduced at any time to a dose as low as fostamatinib 100 mg PO once 
daily ( qd) or matching placebo if dose -limiting adverse events are observed per the  dose 
adjustment  table  below .

150 mg PO bid 100 mg PO bid 150 mg PO qd 100 mg PO qd discontinue  
• Over the course of the study, subjects will be expected to visit the clinic approximately 
15 times.  Safety assessments and hemoglobin levels will be performed at each visit to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of study drug (fostamatinib or placebo), and to determine 
if a dose adjustment is required.  The end of the study will be when the last s ubject has  
complet ed either the Week [ADDRESS_304021] follow -up study visit , whichever is later . 
• Subjects who have completed this study will be encouraged to enroll into an open- label 
extension study with fostamatinib. Subjects and i nvestigators will remain blinded to the 
C-935788- 057 treatment assignment at the time of enrollment in the extension study.  
Details of the dosing strategy during the open- label extension will be specified in a 
separate protocol.  
• Allowed AIHA Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]:  
• Subjects may continue concurrent steroid therapy and other wAIHA therapy (maximum of 
2 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) as listed below throughout their participation in the study (note: throughout 
this document the term ‘steroid’ indicates corticosteroid drugs as well as glucocorticoids).  
If an allowed medication is discontinued during screening, the interval between last dose of medication and randomization is per the timelines listed in the table below: 
Medication  Number of weeks required 
to be at stable dose prior to 
randomization  Minimum required in terval 
between discontinuation 
and randomization  
Azathioprine  4 weeks  4 weeks  
Steroids, including dexamethasone  2 weeks  2 weeks  
Erythropoiesis -stimulating agents  4 weeks  4 weeks  
Mycophenolate Mofetil  4 weeks  4 weeks  
Dapsone  4 weeks  4 weeks  
Danazol  4 weeks  4 weeks  
 
Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol C -935788- 057 
Fostamatinib   Version 6.0, 04 February 2022 
Confidential   Page 11 of 90 • Doses and regimens of concurrent wAIHA therapi[INVESTIGATOR_250171] 24- week treatment period  except for temporary steroid dose increases instituted 
as rescue therapy or a steroid taper as allowed by [CONTACT_760] (see below).  
• If Promacta is being given as a concurrent medication, the dose must be stable for 4 weeks 
prior to randomization.  
• Other me dications when prescribed for wAIHA (e.g. rituximab or other anti -CD20 
monoclonal antibody, cyclosporine, ibrutinib or other BTK inhibitor, chemotherapy agents 
such as cyclophosphamide, vincristine, investigational agents for AIHA, etc.), are not allowed during study treatment (from Day [ADDRESS_304022] dose of study drug).  
• Subjects requiring any AIHA therapi[INVESTIGATOR_250172]. The Medical Monitor should be consulted in these instances.  
Rescue Protocol : 
Use of rescue medications including increases in steroid dose should be avoided for the duration of the study unless medically necessary.  Rescue may be given following a decrease 
in Hgb of >1.5 g/dL from baseline OR new or worsening symptoms of anemia, so long as 
urgent treatment is required in the judgment of the investigator.  In subjects meeting these 
criteria, the following rescue regimen s are permitted:  
1. Increase or initiate steroid  dose up to 80 mg/daily prednisone (or equivalent) for 
approximately 2 weeks or until clinically stable, then taper the dose by 10 to 20 mg prednisone (or equivalent) per week until return to baseline dose level ; 
2. IV methylprednisolone up to 1 g/day x 1 day up to 3 days;  
3. Oral dexamethasone up to 40 mg/day x up to 4 days;  
4. Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion;  
5. IVIg: up to 1g/kg x [ADDRESS_304023] discuss all instances of rescue therapy with the Sponsor’s Medical 
Monitor in advance of initiating the therapy whenever possible. The use of any rescue therapy regimen not noted above is not permitted. Only the rescue regimens above are allowed.  
Steroid Taper Protocol : 
For subjects who have reached We ek 12, achieved a durable response (see definition below 
for durable response), and have had at least 2 subsequent scheduled  visits with hemoglobin 
assessments showing continued response, a steroid taper may be considered . 
The steroid taper may be considered as follows:  
• If the dose is above 20 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent), decrease dose level by 
10 mg* (or equivalent) every other week, until the dose level is 20 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent). Then decrease the dose by 5 mg increments every other week until the dose is 10mg/day and maintain.  
• The taper may be suspended at any dose level to maintain the hemoglobin response and as needed for subject  safety (e.g., to avoid adrenal insufficiency).  
Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol C -935788- 057 
Fostamatinib   Version 6.0, 04 February 2022 
Confidential   Page 12 of 90 • If a decrease in hemoglobin of ≥0.5 g/dL is observed at any subsequent visit (as 
compared to either th e last hemoglobin obtained prior to initiating the taper OR the 
previous hemoglobin assessment), the current steroid dose level should be maintained 
and the hemoglobin repeated in 3 days to assure no recurrence of hemolysis. A sustained (at least 2 consecu tive hemoglobin results) decrease in hemoglobin of 
≥1.0 g/dL should prompt a re -escalation of prednisone (or equivalent) dose to the 
previous, higher dose level.  
• If the steroid dose is 10 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent) or below, no steroid 
tapering is a llowed in this study.  
* If the steroid dose is 25 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent, decrease the dose by 5 mg 
increments to 10 mg/day and maintain. For example,  if the dose is 35 mg/day of prednisone 
or equivalent (or higher dose that is a multiple of 5) , decrease the dose in 10 mg increments 
as described above to 25  mg/day for 2 weeks; then decrease in 5 mg increments to 
10 mg/day and maintain.   
Consideration of a steroid taper is to be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to initiating any changes.  
Endpoints:  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is achievement of durable hemoglobin r esponse (Yes/No ) 
defined as achieving a hemoglobin level ≥  10 g/dL with an increase from Baseline in 
hemoglobin level of ≥ 2 g/dL on 3 consecutive available visits during the 24- week treatment  
period, in which hemoglobin measurements eligible for this definition occurred outside a  
Rescue Treatment Visit Exclusion Period.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  
The secondary efficacy endpoints withi n the 24 weeks of treatment are:  
1. Hemoglobin response on at least one visit (Yes/No)  
2. Achievement of a change from Baseline in hemoglobin level of 2 g/dL or greater (Yes/No)  
3. Change in hemoglobin value from Baseline to End of  Treatment  (Week  14 to 
Week  24)

Duration of Treatment: 24 weeks (extended treatment available to eligible subjects under a separate protocol) . 
Statistical Methods:  
Determination of Sample Size:  
The sample size is based on the number of subjects necessary to demonstrate efficacy in the primary endpoint: achievement of durable hemoglobin response (Yes/No).  In a previous 
phase 2 study, approximately 27%  of subjects (7 out of 26) treated with fostamatini b achieved 
a durable response.  
No data are available on placebo response rates for this population. It is expected that  no more 
than approximately 5% of placebo subjects would achieve a  durable hemoglobin response. 
Under these assumptions, a sample size of 90 subjects (i.e., 45 subjects per treatment group)

sided significance level using Fisher’s exact test.   
Analysis of the Pri mary Efficacy Endpoint:  
Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed using Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel 
(CMH) test stratified by [CONTACT_250208] (≥ 20 vs. < 20  mg daily), and 
screening hemoglobin level (< 9 vs. ≥ 9 g/dL) . The odds ratio will be presented along with the 
95% CI. The study will be considered to meet its primary efficacy objective if the lower bound 
of the 95% CI of odds ratio of durable hemoglobin response between the Fostamatinib and Placebo treated subjects is g reater than 1.  
In addition, the exact Clopper -Pearson 95% CI for the proportions  and the Agresti -Min exact 
unconditional CI for the difference in proportions will be estimated.  
The difference in proportion of durable hemoglobin response between the two tre atment 
groups will be estimated and the 95% Miettinen -Nurminen score CIs will be computed taking 
into account the stratification factors.  
Sensi tivity analysis for p rimary endpoint will be  evaluated using s ubgroup prognostic , 
multiple imputation for missing data , and a was hout of 6 weeks  for rescu e treatment exclusion 
period.  
Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  
Analysis of binary secondary efficacy endpoints (hemoglobin response on at least one visit, achievement of a change from Baseline in hemoglobin level of 2 g/dL or greater, use of permitted rescue medications after Week 4) will be performed using the CMH test stratified by [CONTACT_250209] (≥ 20 vs. < 20  mg daily), and Screening hemoglobin level 
< 9 vs. ≥ 9 g/dL) . In addition, the exact Clopper -Pearson 95% CI for the overall proportions 
will be estimated by [CONTACT_1570].  In addition, t he Agresti -Min exact unconditional 95% CI  
for the d ifference in proportion s will be estimated as well as the 95% Miettinen- Nurminen 
score CIs taking into account the stratification factors.  
Change from Baseline to End of Treatment in hemoglobin levels will be analyzed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with multiple imputation s with concomitant steroid use 
at Baseline (≥ 20 vs. < 20 mg daily), screening hemoglobin level (< 9 vs. ≥ 9 g/dL) and treatment group as fixed effect in the model. The missing hemoglobin value s will be  imput ed. 
Least squares mean with the 95% CI for the mean will be constructed for each treatment group and for the differences between the treatment groups.   
Change from Baseline to Week [ADDRESS_304032] model for repeated measures implemented by [CONTACT_248294]. The model will use change from Baseline in FACIT -F as a response variable and include the fixed 
categorical effects of treatment group, weeks (12 and 24), interaction between treatment and weeks, concomitant steroid use at Baseline (≥ 20 vs. <  20 mg daily), Screening hemoglobin 
level (< 9  vs. ≥ 9 g/dL), and Baseline FACIT -F as a covariate.   
Safety Analysis  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_250210], TEAE s of interest, extent of exposure, and 
changes from Baseline  in laboratory values (e.g., selected hematology, chemistry) over time.

3.1 Background  
Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is an acquired disorder manifested by 
[CONTACT_250212]- mediated red blood cell (RBC) destruction. The estimated incidence is 0.8 -3 per 
100,000/year with a mortality rate of 11%.(1) AIHA is subclassified as either warm or cold, some 
80% of cases are warm AIHA, and can be either primary or secondary to an underlying disease 
such as autoimmune d isease, 20%, lymphoproliferative disorder, 20%, or infections and 
tumors. (1) 
The diagnosis of AIHA is typi[INVESTIGATOR_250176] a positive di rect 
antiglobulin test (DAT), indicating that RBC autoantibodies and/or complement proteins are 
bound to red cells. Additional abnormalities include a reduced serum haptoglobin level, an increased indirect bilirubin, and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH).
 (2, 3)  
The first- line treatment of AIHA generally consists of steroids. Up to 85% of patients will 
respond, however fewer than 20% of patients will be cured. Splenectomy has traditional ly been 
the second line therapy of choice for this disease, with 60- 70% of patients having a sustained 
response. Other therapeutic approaches that can be used, following the failure of front -line 
treatment, include rituximab, IVIg, cyclosporine, mycophenol ate mofetil, azathioprine, and 
cyclophosphamide. The availability of these alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_250177] -line treatment.
(1, 4-6)  
Fc receptor γ (FcRγ) signaling in monocytes and macrophages plays an important role in the initiation and propagation of autoimmune responses. The activating FcRγ is associated with a signaling subunit, referred to as the FcRγ chain, whose phosphorylation subsequent to receptor activation results in the recruitment and activation of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk). Syk is an important component of the signaling system of activated Fc receptors, as well as the B -cell 
receptor (BCR).  
Aggregation of the Fc receptors , induced by [CONTACT_30936]- antigen complexes, can activate a 
multitude of cellular functions (including degranulation, arachidonic acid metabolism, antibody 
dependent cellular cytotoxicity, phagocytosis and cytokine secretion) depending on the cell type, 
and le ads to tissue damage and the propagation of inflammatory responses. FcRγ have been 
implicated in immune destruction of RBCs.  Accelerated clearance of circulating IgG -coated 
RBCs via FcRγ -bearing macrophages in the spleen and liver is believed to be a patho genic 
mechanism in AIHA.
(2) Fostamatinib (R788) is the prodrug of R940406 (R406), a potent and 
relatively selective inhibitor of Syk and, consequently, of the FcR and BCR signaling pathways. 
R406 inhibits Syk and FcR signaling at concentrations generally achieved with fostamatinib doses of 100 -150 mg twice daily ( bid) and above, and nonclinical data have affirmed its activity 
in AIHA.

Podolanczuk et al. reported on preclinical studies of R788/R406 in murine models of immune 
thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and AIHA.(7) Mice injected with an antibody directed to RBCs 
(anti-Ly76) were anemic [ADDRESS_304035] injection. Mice treated with vehicle alone displayed no 
protection, while mice treated with either 25 or 40  mg/kg R788 were significantly protected from 
anemia.

Figure  1 shows data for CD1 mice that were pretreated with nothing (Nil) , vehicle, or R788 (at the dose indicated) 
on Day 1. Mice in the vehicle and R788 groups were injected again (8 hours apart) on Day 2. All mice except for the 
unmanipulated group were injected with anti -erythrocyte (TER119) antibody on Day 2 to induce anem ia. Mice were 
bled on Day 3 for RBC count.  All data are expressed as mean ±  SEM (n = 6 mice per group).  (8) 
3.3 Fostamatinib Pharmacokinetics, Efficacy and Safety  
3.3.1 Pharmacokinetics  
Fostamatinib (R788) is a prodrug rapi[INVESTIGATOR_250178] R406. R406 appears rapi[INVESTIGATOR_250179]. Peak plasma R406 concentration is usually achieved app roximately 1.[ADDRESS_304036] dose (t
max). Negligible levels of R788 are found in 
plasma. The terminal half -life of R406 is approximately 15 hours. In general, exposure of R406 
(AUC, C max) increases in a dose proportional manner up to 200 mg bid. Administratio n of 
fostamatinib with a high -calorie, high -fat meal modestly increases R406 AUC by 23% and C max 
by 15%, indicating fostamatinib can be given with and without food. In in vitro  studies, R406 is 
about 98.3% protein bound in human plasma. The red blood cell to plasma concentration ratio is 
approximately 2.6. The apparent volume of distribution at steady- state (V ss) and total clearance 
(CL) of R406 is approximately 256 L and 15.7 L/h, respectively; suggesting the drug is well distributed in the body and cleare d at a moderate rate.  
Population analyses of PK data from healthy subjects and in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura  (ITP) indicate fostamatinib pharmacokinetics 
(PK) is not altered by [CONTACT_654], sex, or race/ethnici ty. Body weight is found to be a covariate affecting 
the exposure of R406. Exposure decreases with increasing body weight, in alignment with 

Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol C -935788- 057 
Fostamatinib   Version 6.0, 04 February 2022 
Confidential   Page 23 of 90 allometric principles. Given a relatively high intrinsic variability in exposure among subjects due 
to known and unknown factors, dose adjustment by [CONTACT_250213]. 
Fostamatinib PK is not altered in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 30 to 
<50 mL/min), at end stage renal disease requiring dialysis or with hepatic impairment 
(Child -Pugh Class A, B and C).  
Fostamatinib has shown to be generally safe and well -tolerated over a wide range of doses up to 
600 mg. The effective concentration of R406 to inhibit Syk signaling was evaluated in a Phase  1 
study with healthy subjects and in Pha se 2 studies in RA patients. Results show that doses at or 
above 100 mg bid would generate effective concentrations to suppress inflammatory processes.  
3.3.2 Metabolism  
Fostamatinib is metabolized in the gut by [CONTACT_250214], R406. R406 is extensively metabolized, primarily through pathways of CYP450- mediated 
oxidation (by [CONTACT_097]3A4) and glucuronidation (by [CONTACT_250215] [UGT]1A9). R406 is the predominant moiety in the systemic circulation, and there was minimal exposure to any R406 metabolites.  
3.3.3 Drug -Drug Interactions 
No significant interactions were seen with concomitant use of fostamatinib with the following drugs: methotrexate (OAT1/3 transporters), midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate), M icrogynon 
(ethinyl estr adiol and levonorgestrel), warfarin, pi[INVESTIGATOR_051] (CYP2C8 substrate) and ranitidine 
(H2-antagonist that increases gastric pH).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Effect of Other Drugs on R406 Exposure 
• A strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole, produced approximately 102% increase in AUC and 37% in C
max to R406 exposure, while a moderate inhibitor, verapamil, caused 
approximately 39% increase in AUC and 6% in C max to R406 exposure.  
• A strong inducer of mul tiple CYP enzymes, rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], decreased exposure to R406 
AUC by 75% and C max by 59%. 
• Single doses of rosuvastatin and simvastatin did not have a clinically relevant effect on 
the PK of R406.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Effect of Fostamatinib on Exposure of Other Drugs  
Fostamatinib is an inhibitor of the human P -gp efflux transporter in vitro. R406 is a substrate of 
P-gp but not of other major transporters (OAT1/3, OCT2, OATP1B1/3, MRP2, and BCRP). 
R406 can inhibit CYP3A4 and BCRP and can induce CYP2C8 activity. R406 is an inhibitor of 
UGT1A1. Inhibition of UGT1A1 may result in increased unconjugated bilirubin in the absence of other LFT abnormalities.   
• CYP3A4 substrate: Concomitant use of simvastatin (single dose 40 mg) with 100 mg 
twice daily fostamatinib increased simvastatin AUC b y 64% and C
max by 113% and 
simvastatin acid AUC by 64% and C max by 83%. 
Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol C -935788- 057 
Fostamatinib   Version 6.0, 04 February 2022 
Confidential   Page 24 of 90 • BCRP substrate: Concomitant use of rosuvastatin (single dose 20 mg) with 100 mg twice 
daily fostamatinib increased rosuvastatin AUC by 95% and C max by 88%. 
• P-gp substrate: Concomitant use of digoxin (0.25 mg once daily) with 100 mg twice daily 
fostamatinib increased digoxin AUC by 37% and C max by 70%. 
3.4 Efficacy in wAIHA  
A Phase 2 multi -center, open -label, Simon two -stage study (C788- 053) in adults with AIHA who 
have failed at least one p rior treatment regimen was conducted at sites in the US and Canada.  
Patients were treated for [ADDRESS_304037] 4 patients achieved a hemoglobin response (defined as 
hemoglobin >10 g/dL and ≥ 2 g/dL higher than baseline) by [CONTACT_10585] 24, up to 20 additional 
patients were to be enrolled in Stage 2 for a total of up to 37 patients. The protocol allowed up to 
two thirds of patients with secondary AIHA.  
At the time of data cutoff for an interim analysis, a total of 19 patients with AIHA received 
fostamatinib in Stage 1, 17 of whom were evaluable for efficacy. Eight of the 17 patients (47%) 
achieved a hemoglobin response by [CONTACT_10585] 24, meeting the criteria for initiating Stage 2; a ninth 
subject achieved a hemoglobin response by [CONTACT_10585] 30. The extension study is ongoing. 
Enrollment in the Phase 2 study was halted in Aug 2018 after a decision was made to initiate a 
Phase 3 study in wAIHA. 
3.5 Efficacy in ITP  
The Phase 3 clinical program in patients with ITP was comprised of 2 completed double -blind, 
randomized, placebo -controlled studies (C788- 047 and C788- 048) and an open- label treatment 
extension (C788- 049) in patients with persistent/chronic ITP. Studies C788 -047 and C788- 048 
were id entically designed, as randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, parallel group 
efficacy and safety studies of 24 weeks of treatment with fostamatinib compared with placebo in 
patients with persistent/chronic primary ITP. Randomization was in a 2:1 rat io 
(fostamatinib:placebo) and was stratified by [CONTACT_250216] (<15 x 109/L or ≥15 x 109/L) 
and prior splenectomy (yes or no).  
The initial dose was 100 mg bid, which was increased to 150 mg bid on or after Week 4 if 
platelet count was <50 x 109/L (and depending on tolerability).  
Efficacy results from 2 Phase 3 studies and a long -term extension study demonstrate a rate of 
stable platelet response of 17.6% –22.7% in patients treated with fostamatinib.(8) The initial signal 
of a fostamatinib -associated increase in platelets was evident within [ADDRESS_304038] responders to continue on fostamatinib in the extension study. Details of the ITP studies can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.

Fostamatinib has been studied in nearly 4700 subjects/patients across various populations 
including healthy subjects, patients with ITP , patients with RA, oncology patients, and in 
patients with AIHA.  Details on safety information in these populations can be found in the 
Investigator ’s Brochure. Information on the most relevant populations, wAIHA and ITP, for this 
protocol are described b elow.  
3.6.1 Safety in wAIHA  
In Study C788- 053, as of the data cutoff date of an interim analysis (08 March 2018), all 
19 patients reported an AE: diarrhea was reported for 5 patients (26%); hypertension for 6 patients (32%); nausea, fatigue, insomnia and dizzine ss for 3 patients each (16%); ALT 
elevation, AST elevation, BP increased, decreased neutrophils, pyrexia, headache, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], hypokalemia, anemia, jaundice, ocular icterus, and increased weight for 2 patients each (11%); 63% of subjects had an AE considered treatment related.  The most 
common treatment- related AEs included diarrhea (21%), hypertension (16%), fatigue (16%), 
ALT/AST elevated (11%), blood pressure increased (11%), and neutrophils decreased (11%); all are consistent with  the safety profile described in the ITP and RA populations.  
The majority of events were mild to moderate in severity.  Events of Grade- 3 severity included 
decreased neutrophils, fatigue, skin necrosis, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, anemia, jaundice, contusion and prostate cancer. Of these severe events, only decreased neutrophils and fatigue 
were considered related to fostamatinib treatment.   
The incidence of increased blood pressure was generally similar to that reported in the 
fostamatinib safety databa se; for example, out of 19 total subjects there were four subjects with 
normal baseline BP who developed on- treatment values as high as Stage 1 (systolic between 
130–139 or diastolic between 80–89 mmHg). Regarding liver function tests, there were no cases of ALT or AST >[ADDRESS_304040]. The incidence of GI -related AEs was similar to that in the 
fostamatinib safety database (e.g., 26% incidence of diarrhea).  
Three subjects had serious adverse events (SAEs), all judged unrelated to study drug by [CONTACT_250218].  One subject had three SAEs of anemia, skin necrosis 
and fatal infection; the fatal event was a complication of the skin necrosis/possible calciphylaxis.  
The second subject had a fatal pneumonia considered related to underlying CLL  and chronic 
steroid therapy.  The third subject had a SAE of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone 
secretion (SIADH); fostamatinib was interrupted until resolution of the event.

fostamatinib exposure in these studies was 86 days (range 8 to 183 days).  
In the ITP double -blind  studies, serious adverse drug reactions were febrile neutropenia, 
diarrhea, pneumonia, and hypertensive crisis, which each occurred in 1% of patients receiving 
fostamatinib. In addition, severe adverse reactions observed in patients receiving fostamatinib  
included dyspnea and hypertension (both 2%); and neutropenia, arthralgia, chest pain, diarrhea, dizziness, nephrolithiasis, pain in extremity, toothache, syncope and hypoxia (all 1%). Table  1

modification.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Diarrhea  
Diarrhea occurred in 31% of ITP patients treated with fostamatinib; severe diarrhea occurred in 
1% of patients treated with fosta matinib.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Neutropenia  
In ITP clinical trials, neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L) was reported. There is no clear association 
between neutropenia and the risk of infection. Neutropenia occurred in 7% of patients treated with fostamatinib; febrile neutropenia occurred in 1% of patients.  
3.6.3 Safety Summary  
Nearly 4 ,700 subjects/patients have received fostamatinib as part of clinical studies in a variety 
of indications, including 163 patients with ITP, more than 3,400 RA patients at doses of 100 to 300 mg /day, and more than 160 oncology patients at doses of 200 to 500 mg/day ; a summary of 
the safety profile of fostamatinib in each of these indications is provided in the I nvestigator’s 
Brochure . Fostamatinib is generally well tolerated when administered at doses of [ADDRESS_304044] frequent adverse reactions reported from these populations.  
3.7 Potential Benefit -Risk Summary  
Nonclinical data support the potential benefit of fostamatinib, a SYK inhibitor, in wAIHA . SYK 
plays a central role in FcRγ -bearing macrophage clearance of circulating IgG -coated RBCs, 
which is believed to be a pathogenic mechanism in AIHA ( Section 3.1 ).
(2) Fostamatinib 
administration in an animal model of wAIHA showed protection  from anemia (Section 3.2).  
As described in  Section  3.4, an interim data cut  of the open label Phase [ADDRESS_304045] one prior therapy showed that 
8/17 subjects (47%) in the Efficacy Evaluable Population responded during the 24 -week 
evaluation period (lower bound of the exact 95% confidence interval is 23%); one additional subject met the response criteria in the extension period (after 24 weeks of dosing) for an overall response rate of 53% (9/17) on fostamatinib (lower bound of the exact 95% confidence interval is 31%). Thus preliminary data indicate that fostamatinib may benefit wAIHA patients who have failed at least one prior therapy.  
Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol C -935788- [ADDRESS_304046] been  character ized and consistent across programs  including, 
healthy subjects, and  patients with ITP, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), malignancies, IgA 
nephropathy and wAIHA (see Investigator’s Brochure). The AEs  most commonly related to 
fostamatinib include effects on blood pressure, hepatic transaminase elevations, gastrointestinal 
complaints (especially diarrhea) and neutrophil counts. These AEs are mostly mild to moderate in intensity. They are reversible and manageable with appropriate safety moni toring, medical 
intervention and at times fostamatinib dose reduction, interruption or discontinuation (details on Recommended Dose Modifications and Management of Specific Adverse Reactions in Appendix 2).  The safety results from the Phase 2 wAIHA interim datacut (described in 
Section  3.6.1) are consistent with those in the entire fostamatinib safety database.  SAEs in the

4.2 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is achievement of durable hemoglobin r esponse (Yes/No ) defined 
as achieving a hemoglobin level ≥  10 g/dL with an increase from Baseline in hemoglobin level 
of ≥ 2 g/dL on 3 consecutive available visits during the 24 -week treatment period, in which

Exclusion Period (see Section 10.3.6) . 
4.3 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The secondary efficacy endpoints within the 24 weeks of treatment are:  
1. Hemoglobin response on at least on e visit (Yes/No) 
2. Achievement of a change from Baseline in hemoglobin level of 2 g/dL or greater 
(Yes/No)  
3. Change in hemoglobin value from Baseline to End of  Treatmen t (Week 14 to Week 24)  
4.  Use of permitted rescue medications after Week 4 (Yes/No)  
5. Change from Baseline to Week 24 in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy -  
Fatigue scal e (FACIT -F) 
End of Treatment hemoglobin is defined as the mean of the hemoglobin values from the last 6 
available visits  between Week 1 4 and Week 24, inclusive, as long as those visits occurred 
outside a Rescue Treatment Visit Exclusion Period.  
The FACIT -F scale is a short, 13 -item, easy to administer tool that measures an individual’s 
level of fatigue during their usual daily activities over the past week. Each item is rated using a 
5-point Likert -type scale (0 = not at all; 1 = a little bit; 2 = somewhat; 3 = quite a bit; and 
4 = very much). Negatively stated items are reversed by [CONTACT_178989] “4”. After 
reversing proper items, all subscale items are summed to a total, which is the subscale score. All 
items contribute to the sum score with  equal weight. The scale range is [ADDRESS_304048] possible score indicating no fatigue (see FACIT

Confidential   Page 33 of 90 5.0 STUDY DESIGN 
5.1 Justi fication of Study Design  
This is a Phase 3 multicenter placebo -controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
fostamatinib in patients with wAIHA.  The rationale for the study comes from results from a 
preclinical AIHA model show ing that mice treated with fostamatinib were significantly protected 
from anemia (see Section 3.2) as well as results from a Phase II study showing that up to 47% of 
patients with wAIHA achieved a hemoglobin response after treatment with fostamatinib (see Section 3.4 ). The basis for a randomized controlled design is to be able to distinguish the safety 
and efficacy results of fostamatinib as compared to the control.  The choice of a placebo  for the 
control group is justified because there is no specific treatment approved for this condition. The initial hemoglobin response was observed in the Phase II  study as early as week 2 and as late as 
week 30. The intent of the 24 -week treatment and ob servation period is to capture the majority of 
responses.  
5.2 Summary of Study Description 
This is a Phase 3 multi -center, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, parallel group 
study to investigate the efficacy of 24 weeks of treatment with fostamatinib  (R788) vs. placebo 
in achieving a durable hemoglobin response in subjects with wAIHA ( Figure  2). Approximately

Confidential   Page 34 of 90 Subjects will be randomized (1:1, active:placebo) to receive fostamatinib (100  mg PO bid) or 
matching placebo for 24 weeks.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_250219] (≥20 vs. <20 mg daily) and by [CONTACT_250206] (hemoglobin 
<9 vs. ≥9  g/dL).

tolerated the study drug in the investigator’s judgment .  
The dose  may be  reduced at any time to a dose as low as fostamatinib 100 mg PO  qd or matching 
placebo if dose -limiting adverse events are observed (see Dose Adjustment  Table  5). 
Subjects who have completed this study will be encouraged to enroll into an open- label 
extension study with fostamatinib. Subjects and i nvestigators will remain blinded to the 
C-935788- [ADDRESS_304051] one prior treatment regimen.

____________________________   
Phase 2 and 3 studies of fostamatinib in RA studied multiple dose levels including 50 mg 
PO bid, 100 mg PO  bid and 150 mg PO  qd or bid. Doses ranging from 100  mg to 150 mg PO  bid 
were effective in ameliorating the signs and symptoms of RA, while 50 mg PO  bid was not 
effective.  All dose levels were generally well tolerated. The average daily R406 exposure at 
150 mg PO  bid ranged from 10,000 to 19,800 ng•h/mL. The average daily R406 exposure at 
100 mg  PO bid ranged from 8,800 to 14,000 ng•h/mL. These exposures are consistent with the 
levels needed to affect the Syk pathway, as defined in the biomarker assays described above, and support the 100 and 150 mg PO  bid doses for this study.  
In the Phase 3 IT P studies, subjects received 100 mg PO  bid for 4 weeks; if tolerated and the 
platelet count had not reached a prespecified level, i nvestigators were allowed to increase the 
dose to 150 mg PO bid. Both doses were effective in raising platelet counts; 76% of the patients had their fostamatinib dose increased to 150 mg PO  bid at Week 4.  
In this Phase 3 study, the starting dose will be similar to the Phase 3 ITP studies: the initial dose of fostamatinib will be 100 mg or matching placebo bid. Starting at Week 4, the initial dose will be increased to fostamatinib 150 mg PO  bid or matching placebo bid (i.e., the Phase 2 AIHA 
dose) if subjects have adequately tolerated the study drug. 
Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol C -935788- [ADDRESS_304052] adequately 
tolerated the study drug, in the investigator’s judgment.  
The dose may be reduced at any time to a dose as low as fostamatinib 100 mg PO  qd or matching

5.7 Treatment Blinding and Unblinding  
This is a double -blind study in which the subjects, the investigators, all other site personnel, and 
the Sponsor/Representative will be blinded until all subjects complete the 24 weeks of evaluation 
or discontinue from the study and the database is locked . At that point,  Sponsor/Representative 
personnel will be unblinded  to subject treatment assignments . Subjects, investigators, and all 
other site perso nnel will remain blinded to subject treatment assignment throughout the study. 
Randomization codes will be kept by [CONTACT_1034] .  
At the Screening visit, each subject will be assigned a unique subject number. At the Day [ADDRESS_304053] is covered in Sectio n 8.5.  
5.8 Duration of Treatment  
Over the course of the study, subjects will be expected to visit the clinic approximately 15 times.  
Safety assessments and hemoglobin levels will be performed at each visit to evaluate the safety 
and efficacy of study drug (fostamatinib or placebo), and to determine if a dose adjustme nt is 
required.

7.8.2 Dose Adjustments Due to Adverse Events 
Clinical testing to date has identified adve rse events that may require temporary interruption of 
the study drug and/or a reduction in study drug dose. Modification of study drug administration 
may be required under the following circumstances (see Appendix 2 for guidance regarding AE-related dose adjustments ): 
• Increases in ALT or AST ; 
• ANC <1000 /  mm
3; 
• Severe diarrhea;  
• Hypertension;  or 
• Severe or life- threatening adverse events considered to be related to study drug 
administration.  
Subjects who have their dose reduced may be considered for a re -escalation of the study drug 
dose following resolution of the AE the required the dose reduction, only after consultation with 
the Medical Monitor.  If a s ubject experiences additional dose- limiting AEs, the dose of study 
drug may be further reduced to a dose as low as 100 mg qd.  
Subjects whose dose reduction results in a once daily dose of fostamatinib will take the daily 
study drug dose in the morning. Table  5 details the strategy for dose adjustment in subjects who 
experience AEs requiring dose reduction. Appendix 2 provides the recommended dose modifications for specific adverse events.

Confidential   Page 47 of 90 7.9 Rescue Protocol  
Use of rescue medications including increases in steroid doses should be avoided for the duration 
of the study unless medically necessary.  Rescue may be given following a decrease in Hgb of 
>1.5 g/dL from baseline OR new or worsening symptoms of anemia, so long as urgent treatment 
is required in the judgment of the I nvestigator.  In subjects me eting these criteria, the following 
rescue regimens are permitted:  
1. Increase or initiate steroid dose up to 80 mg/ daily prednisone (or equivalent) for 
approximately 2 weeks or until clinically stable , then taper the dose by 10 to 20 mg 
prednisone (or equiva lent) per week until return to baseline dose level  (see Appendix 3 
for prednisone equivalents conversion table) ; 
2. IV methylprednisolone up to 1 g/day x 1 day up to 3 days;  
3. Oral dexamethasone up to 40 mg/day x up to 4 days;  
4. Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion;  
5. IVIg: up to 1g/kg x [ADDRESS_304071] discuss all instances of rescue therapy with the Sponsor’s Medical 
Monitor in advance of initiating the therapy whenever possible. The use of any rescue therapy regimen not noted above is not permi tted. Only the rescue regimens above are allowed .  
7.10 Steroid Taper Protocol:  
For subjects who have reached Week 12, achieved a durable response and have had at least 2 subsequent scheduled  visits with hemoglobin assessments showing continued response, a 
steroid taper may be considered as follows:  
• If the dose is above 20 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent), decrease dose level by 10 mg* 
(or equivalent) every other week, until the dose level is 20 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent). Then decrease the dose by 5 mg increments every other week until the dose 
is 10 mg/day and maintain. See Appendix 3 for prednisone equivalents conversion table.  
• The taper may be suspended at any dose level to maintain the hem oglobin response and 
as needed for subject safety (e.g., to avoid adrenal insufficiency).  
• If a decrease in  hemoglobin of ≥0.5 g/dL is observed at any subsequent visit (as 
compared to either the last hemoglobin obtained prior to initiating the taper OR the 
previous  hemoglobin ass essment), the current steroid dose level should be maintained 
and the  hemoglobin r epeated in 3 days to assure no recurrence of hemolysis. A sustained 
(at least 2 consecutive hemoglobin results ) decrease in hemoglobin of ≥1.0  g/dL  should 
prompt a re -escalation of prednisone (or equivalent) dose to the previous, higher dose 
level.  
Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol C -935788- 057 
Fostamatinib   Version 6.0, 04 February 2022 
Confidential   Page 48 of 90 • If the steroid dose is 10 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent) or below, no steroid tapering 
is allowed in this study.  
*If the steroid dose is 25 mg/day of p rednisone or equivalent, decrease the dose by 5 mg 
increments to 10 mg/day and maintain. For example , if the dose is 35 mg/day of prednisone or 
equivalent (or higher dose that is a multiple of 5), decrease the dose in 10 mg increments as 
described above to  25 mg/day for 2 weeks; then decrease in 5 mg increments to 10 mg/day and 
maintain.    
Consideration of a steroid taper is to be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to initiating any changes.  
7.11 Concomitant Erythropoietin Stimulating Agents  
In subjects me eting the above response criteria (durable response and 2 subsequent scheduled 
visits with hemoglobin showing continued response);  if the hemoglobin increases to above the 
upper limit of normal the ESA dose may be reduced by 50% every 4 weeks. 
7.12 Missed Doses/ Dose Interruptions  
Missed doses will be consider ed as a dose interruption if the prescribed doses have been missed 
for two or more consecutive days.  
Restarting study drug after interruption may require performance of procedures for safety that 
were missed during the interruption.  The Medical Monitor should be consulted when considering 
study drug restart after a prolonged interruption ( e.g., > 2 weeks).  
7.13 Definition of Study Procedures  
7.13.1 Medical History  
The following documentation will be collected at s creening and reviewed at baseline (Day 1):

Confidential   Page 49 of 90 schedule in Table  4. Prior to initiation of treatment, any new or worsened abnormalities should 
be recorded as medical history. Following the initiation of study treatment, any clinically 
significant new or wors ened abnormalities will be recorded as adverse events.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Karnofsky Performance Status Assessment  
The KPS (see Appendix 1) is a widely used method of ass essing the functional status of 
patients.(9) KPS score will be collected as part of the eligibility criteria. The KPS describes the 
patient's functional status using percentage value ranges from 100% (no evidence of disease) to 0% (death).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs  
Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, and temperature) will be assessed at all study visits.  All blood 
pressure determinations should be made with the subject seated and taken after the subject rests for 5  minutes.  
If the initial blood pressure at any visit other than screening is ≥130 mmHg systolic or ≥[ADDRESS_304072] 3  minutes apart. If the average of the 3 measurements is ≥130 mmHg 
systolic or diastolic is ≥80  mmHg, follow the guidelines in Appendix 2.  
7.13.2 Questionnaires  
The FACIT -F and EQ -5D-5L subjects’ reported outcomes (PRO) will be administered at 
Baseline, W eek 12 and W eek 24 (Early Termination).  The s ubject is to read questionnaire by 
[CONTACT_12552]/herself and write/mark answers directly onto the questionnaire.  Questionnaires should be 
checked for completeness only.  
7.13.[ADDRESS_304073] in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_250189]. The I nvestigator or designee will evaluate the ECG for abnormalities.  
7.13.4 Laboratory Tests  
Laboratory samples will be collected, processed,  shipped and managed according to the lab 
manual. Samples will be obtained at each study visit according to the schedule in Table  4. The 
total amount o f blood collected for the duration of the 24- week study and 28- day screening 
period study is approximately 200 mL. 
The following tests are to be collected and analyzed for the study:  
• DAT specific for anti -IgG. Eligibility may be based on a historical DAT obtained within 
12 months of the screening visit from a local laboratory, provided that specific IgG 
positivity is documented; otherwise, this assay will be done at screening by a central laboratory ;

gravity, pH, urobilinogen, and leukocytes . A microscopic urinalysis will be performed  if 
protein, leukocyte esterase, blood, or nitrite are abnormal.  
An abnormal la boratory value is clinically significant if it meets any of the following criteria, 
and as such should be documented on the AE page of the eCRF:  
• Test result is associated with accompanying symptom;  
• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention;  
• Test result leads to change in study drug dosing or discontinuation from the study, 
significant  additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy; or  
• Test result  is considered an AE by [CONTACT_9304]. 
Any laboratory result abnormality fulfilling the criteria for an SAE should be reported as such, in 
addition to being recorded as an AE. 
All subjects’ laboratory results with clinically significant abnormal values should be followed 
regularly until the values return to the normal range or until a more plausible alternative cause, 
other than drug- related AE(s), is identified.  
7.13.[ADDRESS_304074] at any time during the study will be discontinued from further study drug admin istration and will be followed for safety (see 
Section  9.4). 
Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol C -935788- [ADDRESS_304075] dose of study drug will be recorded. Subjects are not required to take study drug in the clinic the day the sample is collected.  Samples will be shipped to and stored at the central 
laboratory at - 70°C during the course of the study.  Samp les will then be transferred to and 
analyzed at the corresponding bioanalytical laboratory.  
After completion of the study, samples may be stored for an additional 5 years for further metabolite identification and/or evaluation of the bio -analytical method in relation to this study.  
Data from these analyses will be used by [CONTACT_250223].  All samples will be destroyed after analysis or

Section  7.13.4) should be captured as adverse events.  
AEs may include, but are not limited to : 
• Subjective or objective symptoms spontaneously offered by [CONTACT_3184]/or identified by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator or  study staff, including laboratory abnormalities of clinical 
significance;  
• AEs not  previously observed in the subject that emerge during the protocol -specified AE 
reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with the target disease that were not present before the AE reporting period; and  
• Complications that occur as a result of protocol- mandated interventions such as a 
venipuncture. 
The following are  generally  NOT considered an AE:  
• Pre-Existing Condition: A pre -existing condition (documented on the medical history 
eCRF) is not considered an AE unless the severity, frequency, or character of the event worsens during the study period; or  
• Diagnostic Testing and Procedures: Testing and procedures should not be reported as AEs or SAEs, but, rather, the cause for the test or procedure should be reported.  
Assessment of Severity : Refer to CTCAE criteria version 5.0 November 27, 2017 as guidance  
for grading of adverse events. If the event is not listed within CTCAE categories  or judged as 
CTCAE greater than Grade 3, then the intensity of an event should be evaluated as referred to 
below:  
• Grade 1 (Mild) – asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.  
• Grade 2 (Moderate) – m inimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated;  
• Grade 3 (Severe) – severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; age -appropriate, 
instrumental activities  of daily life are limited.

Fostamatinib   Version 6.0, 04 February 2022 
Confidential   Page 57 of 90 • Grade 4 – Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated; self -care 
activities of daily life are limited.  
• Grade 5 – Death related to AE.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  
Note: The terms “ severe ” and “serious” are not synonymous.  Severity (or intensity) refers to the 
grade of an AE (see below). “Serious” is a regulatory definition. 
A serious adverse event (experience) or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any 
dose:  
• Results in deat h; 
• Is life -threatening. (With regards to determining if an AE is serious, “life -threatening” is 
defined as an AE in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe. If either the investigator or the Sponsor believes that an AE meets the definition 
of life threatening, it will be considered life -threatening ); 
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324];  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (e.g., the AE results in substantial 
disruption of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions); or  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect ; 
• Is considered an important medical event (or medically significant) that may not result in any of the above outcomes but based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed   
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations, such as important medical events , should also be considered serious . Some  examples of such events 
are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood 
dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Given that the investigator’s perspective may be informed by [CONTACT_250224], if either Rigel or the investigator believes that the event is medically significant, the event will be considered as su ch 
or an important medical event  in the absence of other  seriousness  criteria . 
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_250192]:  
Pre-Planned Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_250193] a t herapeutic intervention. However, if during the pre -planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_250194], the event 
Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol C -935788- 057 
Fostamatinib   Version 6.0, 04 February 2022 
Confidential   Page 58 of 90 will be considered an SAE. Surgeries or interventions that were under consideration but not 
performed prior to initiation of treatment in the study will not be considered as SAEs if they are performed after initiation of treatment in the study for a condition that has not changed from its baseline level. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_250195],  due to long travel distances, 
or emergency room admissions  of less than 24 hours  are also not considered SAEs.  
Suspected Adverse Reaction:  
Any AE for which there is a “reasonable possibility” that the study drug caused the AE will be regarded as a Suspected Adverse Reaction by [CONTACT_250202].  
“Reasonable Possibility,” for the purposes of safety reporting, means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the AE. Examples of types of evidence that would sugges t a causal relationship between the study drug and the AE are:  
• A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with study drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, blood dyscrasias, rhabdomyolysis, hepatic injury, anaphylaxis, a nd Stevens -Johnson syndrome);  
• One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with study drug exposure but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the study drug (e.g., tendon rupture or heart valve lesions in young adults or  intussusception in healthy 
infants).  If the event occurs in association with other factors strongly suggesting 
causation (e.g., strong temporal association, event recurs on rechallenge), a single case may be sufficiently persuasive; but often, more than 1 occurrence (from 1 or multiple studies) would be needed before the Sponsor could make a determination of whether the study drug caused the event; or  
• An aggregate analysis of specific events that can be anticipated to occur in the study 
population independent of study drug exposure. Such events include known 
consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation (e.g., symptoms, 
disease progression) or events unlikely to be related to the underlying disease or condition under investigation but commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy (e.g., cardiovascular events in an elderly population). An aggregate analysis (across studies) will identify those events that occur more frequently in the study drug 
treatment group th an in a concurrent or historical control group. 
This definition of suspected adverse reaction and the application of the reasonable possibility 
causality standard are considered to be consistent with the concepts and discussion about 
causality in the Inter national Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E2A guidance.  
Unexpected:  An AE that is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure or is not listed at the 
specificity or severity that has been observed will be regarded as “unexpected”. For example, hepatic necro sis would be “unexpected” (by [CONTACT_14213]) if the Investigator’s 
Brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be “unexpected” (by [CONTACT_250225]) if the Investigator’s Brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. “ Unexpected ” 
Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol C -935788- 057 
Fostamatinib   Version 6.0, 04 February 2022 
Confidential   Page 59 of 90 also refers to AEs that are mentioned  in the Investigator’s Brochure  as occurring with a class of 
drugs or as  anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the study drug but are not 
specifically mentioned as occurring with the study  drug under investigation. 
Causality: The i nvestigator is to assess the causal relation (e.g., whether there is a reasonable 
possibility that the study drug caused the event) using the following definitions:  
• Definitely Related : A reaction that has reasonable evidence showing a direct causal 
relationship;  
• Probable : A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the investigational study drug or it s class of drugs; that follows a known or expected 
response pattern to the suspected investigational study drug; and that could not be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_250226]’s clinical state or the 
background rate for the event in the population being studied;  
• Possible : A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration; 
that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected investigational study drug; but that could readily have been produced b y a number of other factors;  
• Unlikely : A reaction that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration, or there is a reasonably compelling alternative explanation ; however, 
causation by [CONTACT_250227] ; and 
• Not Related : A reaction that does not have any reasonable suspected causal relationship. 
If the relationship of an adverse event to study drug is determined to be definitely related, probable, or possible, then the relationship assigned for the purposes of regulatory reporting will be "yes."  
If the relationship of an adverse event to study drug is determined to be unlikely or not related, then the relationship assigned for the purposes of regulatory reporting will be "no."  
9.2 Documenting and Reporting of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events by [CONTACT_250228] I nvestigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs (including SAEs) that are observed or 
reported during the study, as outlined in the prior sections, are recorded on the eCRF w ith the 
exception of screen failures. The I nvest igator is not required t o record s creen failure AE/SAEs 
on the eCRF.  Thes e are r ecorded on an SAE Form  and submitted to Drug Safety only per  the 
expedited reporting proces s for SAEs (see S ection 9.2.3) .  
9.2.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The AE reporting period begins with the signing of the initial informed consent form (or the first informed  consent form if more than one informed consent is signed due to rescreening) and ends 
with the final study (follow -up) visit.   
Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol C -935788- [ADDRESS_304078]'s last participation in the 
study, it should be followed until time of resolution or stabilized unless the subjects is lost to 
follow  up. Resolution means the subject has returned to baseline state of health or the 
investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the event.  
Any SAE occurring within [ADDRESS_304079]’s medical record and on the AE eCRF and, when applicable, on an SAE form.  
Each recorded AE or SAE will be described by [CONTACT_13662] (e.g., start and end dates), severity, regulatory seriousness criteria, if applicable, suspected relationship to the investigational product (see guidance above ), and any actions taken.  
All deaths should be reported with the primary cause of death as the AE term, as death is typi[INVESTIGATOR_36069], not the event itself. The primary cause of death on the autopsy report should be the term reported. Auto psy and postmortem reports must be forwarded 
to Rigel, or designee, as described below. 
If study drug is discontinued because of an SAE, this information must be included in the SAE 
report.  
9.2.3 Expedited Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events 
An investigator should report a SAE within 24 hours of his/her awareness of the event by 
[CONTACT_250229]’s authorized safety representative. 
Additionally, all fatal or life -threatening SAEs should be telephoned to the Medica l Monitor as 
soon as the investigator learns of the event.  
The SAE form should be sent to the following email or fax:  
Email: [EMAIL_4848]  
Fax: +[PHONE_5240] 
The site may contact [CONTACT_250230]/e- mail with questions regarding 
reporting of SAEs.  
Reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC or as per national 
regulatory requirements in participating count ries.

Confidential   Page 61 of 90 9.3 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events by [CONTACT_250231], IRBs/IECs, and Principal Investigators will be notified of SAEs in 
accordance with applicable requirements (e.g., GCPs, ICH guidelines, national regulations, and local requirements). The country- specific requirements, timelines, and processes for complying 
with these requirements are described in detail in the Study Operations Manual and/or Safety Plan.  
For the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting, only those SAEs that are as sessed as 
Suspected Adverse Reactions and unexpected per the Investigator’s Brochure will be unblinded by a Rigel Safety representative or designee. All other study personnel, including clinical sites and i nvestigators shall remain blinded to the unblinded subject’s treatment assignment.  
Rigel’s Safety Surveillance Committee will review and evaluate accumulating safety data from the entire clinical trial database for the study drug at appropriate intervals (e.g., quarterly) to identify new safety signals or  increased frequency of events.  This will include an aggregate 
review and comparison to the control group of SAEs that were deemed as “not suspected” as being associated with use of the study drug.

(i.e. Exposure in Utero Form – Part I or Exposure in Utero Follow -up Form – Part II). Partners 
that become pregnant by a male subject do not need to report pregnancy.  
Prior to screening, females of childbearing potential must agree in the ICF to take appropriate measures to avoid pregnancy at all times during the study, commencing from the time of consent to [ADDRESS_304081]’s participation in the study. The study participant must agree to follow -up by [CONTACT_250232]. Outcome is 
defined as elective termination of the pregnancy, miscarriage, or delivery of the fetus. For pregnancies with an outcome of live birth, the newborn infant will be followed by [CONTACT_250233] 30 days old. Any congenital anomaly/birth defect noted in the infant must 
be reported as an  SAE.  
The investigator will notify Rigel or its authorized representative of a pregnancy occurring in a female study participant within [ADDRESS_304082] becoming aware of such pregnancy using the 
pregnancy notification form. All follow -up information gath ered by [CONTACT_250234] 24 hours  of investigator’s first knowledge of such information 
using the pregnancy exposure form.

Other events that may or may not be associated with an AE/SAE or re garded as such are 
considered “Special Situation Events” and are reportable to Rigel Drug Safety within 24 hours of 
awareness. These are events of medication error, overdose, misuse, abuse, or inadvertent or accidental drug exposure.  
• Medication error: an unintentional error in the prescribing, dispensing, or administration 
of the study drug 
• Overdose: there is an AE associated with the overdose OR t he dose or dosage regimen 
administered significantly exceeds the weekly prescribed dose  in the judgm ent of the 
medical monitor.  
• Misuse: intentional and inappropriate use of study drug not in accordance with study drug administration instructions  
• Abuse: intentional and excessive use of study drug, either persistent or sporadic  
• Inadvertent or accidental e xposure: unintended exposure to study drug that may result in 
noxious and/or harmful consequences to the person who is exposed 
In addition, the Investigator should notify the Medical Monitor if a subject meets Hy’s Law criteria 1 and 2 to confirm whether a n event meets all three of the criteria for Hy’s Law , as 
shown below:   
1. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥3x upper limit of normal (ULN). 
2. Total bilirubin (total BL) >2x ULN and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) <2x ULN . 
3. No other r eason can be found to explain the combination of increased ALT and total BL, 
such as viral hepatitis A, B, or C; preexisting or acute liver disease; or another drug capable of causing the observed injury.   
Any confirmed cases of Hy’s law should be reported per the requirements in Section 9.2.3.

This section provides the key details of the statistical analyses to be performed using data 
captured according to this protocol. A complete statistical analysis plan (SAP) describing all 
planned analyses will be finalized prior to database lock.  
10.1 Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size is based on the number of subjects necessary to demonstrate efficacy in the 
primary endpoint:  achievement of durable hemoglobin response (Yes/No).  
Sample Size for Primary Endpoint: Achievement of durable hemoglobin response  
In a previous phase [ADDRESS_304083] one prior treatment regimen was evaluated. 
Approximately 27% (7 out of 26) of subjects treated with fostamatinib achieved a durable response, defined as a hemoglobin level  above 10  g/dL with at least 2  g/dL higher than the 
baseline hemoglobin, not attributable to RBC transfusion or other rescue treatments on at least 3 scheduled visits within 24 weeks of treatment . No data are available on placebo response rates 
for this po pulation. It is expected that no more than approximately 5% of placebo subjects would 
achieve a durable hemoglobin response. 
Under these assumptions, a sample size of 90 subjects (i.e., 45 subjects per treatment group) will yield at least 84% power to dete ct a difference between the 2 groups at the 0.05 two- sided 
significance level using Fisher’s exact test.   
10.2 Analysis Populations  
The following populations will be considered for analysis of various endpoints:  
• Intent- to-Treat Population (ITT) : Includes all randomized subjects according to the 
randomized treatment assignment.  
• Per-Protocol Population (PP) : Include all subjects in the ITT population without major 
protocol deviations which may affect the evaluation of the primary efficacy endpoints . For 
analysis purposes, subjects will be grouped according to the actual treatment received.  
• Safety  Analysis Population: Consists of all randomized subjects that received at least one 
dose of the assigned treatment according to the treatment received.  
Per protocol population is based on the actual deviations, the criteria for exclusion of subjects 
from the different data sets will be specified and updated, if necessary, prior to database lock.  
Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol C -935788- [ADDRESS_304084] deviation, median, 
minimum and maximum, 25 and 75 percentiles). Frequency distributions (counts and 
percentages) will be used to summarize categorical endpoints.  
Once all patients complete the study evaluation (i.e., nominal study Week 24 or 26) or prematurely discontinued and the final database is locked, the study will be unblinded and final analyses will be performed.  Analysis will be base d on nominal study visits (i.e., study Weeks 0 
to 26).  
The primary efficacy hypothesis tests will be performed using a 2 -sided 0.05 significance level. 
For secondary endpoints, adjustments for the overall type I error will be performed.  
It is anticipated that statistical summaries will be performed using SAS Version 9.4 (SAS 
Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]) or higher. Additional software may be used to produce graphics and for statistical methodology not available in SAS.  
10.3.[ADDRESS_304085] the completeness, accuracy, and/or the reliability of the study data or that might significantly affect a subject’s righ ts, safety and well -being. Examples of 
major protocol deviations are:  
• Subject enrolled who does not meet eligibility criteria  
• Subject who used non- permitted rescue medications 
• Improper collection of or failure to collect the initial study informed consent 
• Subject who received treatment that was contrary to their randomization assignment  
• Subject who developed withdrawal criteria during the study but was not withdrawn.  
Protocol deviations will be maintained in the trial master file and will be listed and disc ussed in 
the clinical study report.

Baseline and demographic characteristics such as age, weight (kg), height (cm), body mass index 
(kg/m2), ethnicity, race, sex, disease type (i.e., primary or secondary), duration of AIHA, Baseline corticosteroid use (Yes/No), number of unique prior AIHA therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], prior AIHA therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], splenectomy (Yes/No), rituximab (Yes/No), hemoglobin (g/dL), LDH (U/L), reticulocyte (10

For continuous variables, number of observations, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values, and [ADDRESS_304086] protocol treatment to the end of study (Week 24/26) will be 
documented. Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary.  Prior medications that are ongoing at the time of study enrollment will 
also be recorded. All concomitant medications will be listed and summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
10.3.6 Analysis of Primary Efficac y Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is achievement of durable hemoglobin response (Yes/No) defined as achieving a hemoglobin level ≥ 10  g/dL with an increase from Baseline in hemoglobin level 
of ≥ 2 g/dL on 3 consecutive available visits during the 24- week treatment period, in which 
hemoglobin measurements eligible for this definition occurred outside a Rescue Treatment Visit Exclusion Pe riod.  
Available visits are defined as any scheduled visit where a plasma sample was collected, and hemoglobin level analyzed using either central or local laboratory.  
For permitted rescue medications, a  Rescue Treatment Visit Exclusion Period begins with  the 
initiation of the rescue medication.  The end of a  Rescue Treatment Visit Exclusion Period is 
4 weeks (28 days) following the return of steroid use to Baseline level or the last administration 
of rescue medication, whichever event occurs the latest.  Any hemoglobin measurements made 
during this exclusion period are not eligible for any endpoint definition.

o: ϴ Fostamatnib ,Placebo  = 1 
 Ha: ϴ  Fostamatnib ,Placebo  ≠ 1, 
where ϴ  Fostamatnib ,Placebo is the odds ratio of durable hemoglobin response due to treatment.  
Analysis will be performed using Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by 
[CONTACT_250208] (≥ 20 vs. < 20 mg daily), and screening hemoglobin level (< 9 vs. ≥ 9 g/dL). The odds ratio will be presented along with the 95% CI.  The s tudy will be 
considered to meet its primary efficacy objective if the lower b ound of the 95% CI  of the odds 
ratio of durable hemoglobin response between the Fostamatinib and Placebo- treated subjects is 
greater than 1.  
In addition, the exact Clopper -Pearson  95% CI for the proportions  and the Agresti -Min exact 
unconditional CI for the difference in proportions will be estimated.  
The difference in proportion of durable hemoglobin response between the two treatment groups 
will be estimated and the 95% Miettinen- Nurminen score CIs
15) will be computed taking into 
account the stratification factors.  
A variety of sensitivity analyses of the primary analysis will be performed.  These sensitivity 
analyses will consider:  
• adjusting for prognostic variables for which an imbalance existed between the treatment 
groups at Baseline  
• durable hemoglobin response derived using the hemoglobin values imputed 
• changing the 4- week washout period in a Rescue Treatment Visit Exclusion Period to a 
6-week washout period

The secondary endpoints for this study are:  hemoglobin response on at least one vis it (Yes/No), 
achievement of change from Baseline in hemoglobin level ≥ 2 g/dL (Yes/No), change in 
hemoglobin values from Baseline to End of Treatment  (Week 14 to Week 24) , the use of 
permitted rescue medications after Week 4 (Yes/No), and change from Basel ine to Week 24 in 
Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy -  Fatigue scale (FACIT -F). 
Adjustment for multiple testing using the hierarchical  method as described in Section  10.4. 
The proportion of subjects who achieve hemoglobin response on at least one visit, proportion of subjects who achieve a change from Baseline in hemoglobin level ≥ 2 g/dL, and proportion of subjects using permitted rescue medications after Week 4 will be summarized.  All subjects 
randomized will be included in the analysis (ITT population).  Subjects with no assessment for 
hemoglobin response will be treated as non- responders. Subjects with no assessment for change 
from Baseline in hemoglobin level will be treated as failure to achieve a change from Baseline in hemoglobin level ≥ 2 g/dL.  
Analysis of hemoglobin response on at least one visit, change from baseline in hemoglobin level 
≥ 2 g/dL, an d use of res cue medications after Week [ADDRESS_304088] 
stratified by [CONTACT_250208] (≥ 20 vs. < 20  mg daily), and Screening 
hemoglobin level < 9 vs.  ≥ 9 g/dL). In addition, the exact Clopper -Pearson 95% CI for the 
overall proportions will be estimated by [CONTACT_1570].  In addition, the Agresti -Min exact 
unconditional 95% CI for t he difference in proportion s will be estimated  as well as the 95% 
Miettinen -Nurminen score CIs  
(12) taking into account the stratification factors.  
Change in hemoglobin value from Baseline to End of Treatment (Week 14 to Week 24) will be summarized using descriptive statistics, such as mean, standard  deviation, and 95% CI . For each 
of the 200 imputed datasets in each imputation setting, change from Baseline to End of Treatment in hemoglobin levels will be analyzed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with concomitant steroid use at Baseline (≥ 20 vs. < 20 mg daily), Screening hemoglobin level (< 9 vs. ≥ 9 g/dL) and treatment group as fixed effect in the model. Least squares mean with the 
95% CI for the mean will be constructed for each treatment group and for the differences between the treatmen t groups. Rubin’s rules
18 will be implemented to combine the results from 
all imputed datasets to provide the overall p -value, 95% CI, and difference between the treatment 
groups.  
The overall FACIT -F score ( defined in Section  4.3) prorated for missing items will be calculated, 
and the change from Baseline in overall score will be summarized for each treatment group at Baseline, Week 12, and Week 24. The number of observations, mean, median, standard 
deviation, and minimum and maximum values, 25th and 75th percentiles, and 95% CIs will be 
presented. In addition, box plots will be presented by [CONTACT_250236] [ADDRESS_304089] model for repeated measures implemented by

[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events and TEAE of Interest  
Treatment -emergent adverse events will be coded according to MedDRA. TEAEs are defined as 
events that first occurred or worsened following first dose of study trea tment administration.  All 
adverse events recorded as occurring before study treatment administration will be considered 
Baseline conditions.  Related TEAEs are events considered related to study treatment by [CONTACT_1275] (i.e., possibly related, probabl y related, or related).   
The number of events, the number of subjects, and the percentage of subjects who experienced at least one TEAE, incidence rate adjusting exposure will be presented.  In addition, TEAEs that are 
considered by [CONTACT_63033] r elated to a study drug; TEAEs that lead to early 
withdrawals; and serious TEAEs will be summarized in the same manner.  Frequent TEAEs, 
including preferred terms with an incidence rate of ≥  5% and TEAEs of interest will also be 
summarized. TEAEs of interest include hypertension, neutropenia, gastrointestinal complaints 
(nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, both overall and separately), infection, and 
liver function test elevation.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Extent of Exposure  
The number of doses of study drug dispensed will  be computed for each subject. Summaries will 
be computed by [CONTACT_250237]. Furthermore, the number and 
percent of subjects experiencing a dose reduction, interruption, or discontinuation of study drug will be presented by [CONTACT_1570]. In addition, a listing of all TEAEs that result in a reduction, interruption, or discontinuation of study drug will be presented. Finally, the reason for drug reduction, interruption, and discontinuation will be tabulated and presented by [CONTACT_2708].

25th and 75th percentiles, and/or spaghetti plots will be presented by [CONTACT_250238].  
Summary statistics (i.e., mean, median, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum, 25th and 75th percentiles) for the actual values, changes from Baseline, and maximum value observed post treatment will be tabulated by [CONTACT_250239]. In addition, shifts based on lab values classified per CTCAE criteria V 5.0 at Baseline (i.e., Study Week 0) , the maximum 
grade observed, and the grade observed for the last value post Baseline will be tabulated. New Grade 3 CTCAE on treatment in selected laboratory results will be listed.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths  
All deaths that occur during the study will be summarized  and lis ted. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Absolute Neutrophil Count  
Absolute neutrophil count is scheduled to be evaluated at Baseline (i.e., prior to administration of first dose of treatment), and every [ADDRESS_304091] randomization (Week 2 to Week 24).  Change 
from Baseline in ANC will be calculated for each subject and study visit. Missing values will be treated as missing.  
Summary statistics (i.e., mean, median, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum, 25th and 
75th percentiles) for the actual values,  changes from Baseline, and maximum value observed 
post treatment will be tabulated by [CONTACT_250239]. In addition, shifts based on 
the CTC grades for ANC at Baseline (i.e., Study Week 0), the maximum value observed, and the last value for the post Baseline will be tabulated.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Blood Pressure Over Time  
Blood pressure (i.e., systolic and diastolic blood pressure) is scheduled to be evaluated at 
Baseline (i.e., prior to administration of first dose of treatment), and every [ADDRESS_304092] 
randomiza tion (Week 2 to Week 24). Change from Baseline in systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure will be calculated for each subject and study visit. For subjects with multiple blood pressure measurements for the same visit, the mean value for the visit will be used as the raw value to calculate the change from Baseline.  Missing values will be treated as missing.  
Summary statistics (i.e., mean, median, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum, 25th and 75th percentiles) for the actual values, changes from Baseline, and maximum value observed post treatment will be tabulated for both systolic and diastolic blood pressure by [CONTACT_250239]. In addition, shifts based on the ACC/AHA guideline in blood pressure results from normal, elevated, Stage [ADDRESS_304093] age 2 at Baseline (i.e., Study Week 0) to normal, elevated,

the last dose of study drug will be recorded. Data will be summarized by [CONTACT_250211]. Descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, IQR) will be tabulated.  
10.4 Multiple Comparisons/Mult iplicity  
Analysis of secondary endpoints will be performed only if the primary efficacy analysis is significant at the 0.05 level using the gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_124502]. Secondary efficacy analyses and 
secondary outcomes will be used to assess the consistency of the primary efficacy analysis.  
Adjustment for multiple testing will be performed using the hierarchical approach  to control the 
overall Type I error for the study . If the primary efficacy endpoint is statistically significant, 
5 secondary endpoints will be tested sequentially in the order as listed in Section  4.3 with the 
corresponding p- values of p1, p2, p3, p4 and p5, respec tively.  Given α=0.05, at any time if 
pi > α, i=1,2,3,4,5, testing will be stopped with no statistically significant differences for the i
th 
and later secondary endpoints. If testing continues to p5 < α, all 5 endpoints will be considered 
statistically sign ificant.   
10.5 Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
An independent DMC will be formed and constituted according to appropriate regulatory agency 
guidelines. The independent DMC will review the safety data periodically and provide 
recommendations according to the charter. Detailed information regarding the composition of the

• Recheck  LFTs every  72 hours  until ALT/AST  are below  1.[ADDRESS_304117])  
and total BL remains  less than [ADDRESS_304118].  
• Consider  interruption  or dose reduction  of study drug  if ALT/AST and  
TBL remain  in this category  (AST/ALT is   
[ADDRESS_304119]; and  total BL remains  less than [ADDRESS_304120]).

• If interrupted,  resume study drug at  next lower  daily  dose (refer to  
Table  5) when  ALT/AST are  no longer  elevated  (below  1.[ADDRESS_304121]) 
and total BL remains  less than  
[ADDRESS_304122].  
• If AST/ALT persist  at [ADDRESS_304123]/ALT is [ADDRESS_304124] or higher 
and total BL >[ADDRESS_304125] • Check direct and indirect BL levels. If direct BL is >2x  ULN then 
discontinue study drug, if only indirect BL is >2x ULN then monitor as 
above.  
Elevated unconjugated (indirect) BL 
in absence of other LFT 
abnormalities • Continue study  drug since isolated increases in unconjugated (indirect) 
BL may be due to UGT1A1 inhibition or the underlying wAIHA disease . 
Diarrhea 
Diarrhea • Manage diarrhea using supportive measures  (e.g.,  dietary  changes, 
hydration  and/or  antidiarrheal  medication)  early  after the onset until 
symptom(s)  have resolved.  
• If symptom(s)  become severe (Grade 3  or above), temporarily interrupt 
study drug.  
• If diarrhea improves  to mild (Grade 1),  resume study drug at the next 
lower  daily  dose (refer to Table  5). 
Neutropenia 
Neutropenia • If absolute neutrophil count decreases  (ANC  less than  
1.0 x 109/L) and remains  low after 72 hours, temporarily  interrupt 
study drug until  resolved (ANC  greater  than  
1.5 x 109/L). 
• Resume study drug at  the next lower  daily  dose (refer to Table  5). 
ALT = alanine aminotransferase; AST = aspartate aminotransferase; BP = blood pressure; BL = bilirubin; 
ULN = upper limit of normal; LFT = liver function tests (AST, ALT, total Bi with fractionation if elevated, alkaline 
phos phatase); AST/ALT = AST or ALT

Screening:  
Sites should not screen subjects if the subject is unlikely or unable to follow the protocol as 
written.  
On Study Visits:  
If possible, study patients should continue on study without interruption of the dosing and visit schedule.   
If in-clinic visits are not possible, consideration can be given to continuing a subject on  study 
drug without clinic visits as outlined below:  
• Subjects should continue on study medication based on their safety and efficacy response to date (including an evaluation of all labs including ALT, AST, total and direct bilirubin (i.e., fractionated bi lirubin), WBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and ANC; and any adverse 
events) up to 6- 8 weeks without an in- person clinic visit.  This is to be managed on a 
patient per patient basis at the discretion of the Investigator and in collaboration with the Medical Moni tor.  
• Subjects  should have labs and blood pressure checked by [CONTACT_250251]/laboratory. 
Alternatives may include an at -home visit conducted by a study nurse. A s a last resort, 
blood pressure may be checked with a home monitoring system  and the site  should 
contact [CONTACT_250252] [ADDRESS_304127]. 
• If nece ssary, subjects may interrupt study drug and receive rescue treatment as needed for 
the underlying disease until restart of study drug,  once in- clinic visits are resumed.  
Subjects are encouraged to stay on the study. The Investigator can consider this as a dose interruption.  If an Investigator has concerns about a prolonged interruption, he/she should 
contact [CONTACT_1689].  
• Subject s reach ing Week 24 visit who are u nable to attend an in -clinic  visit , should be 
discus sed with the Medical Monitor . 
Each patient has individualized needs and may miss an unknown number of visits, in the event of questions the Medical Monitor should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].

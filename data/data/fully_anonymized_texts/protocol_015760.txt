1. PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  
1.1 Executive Synopsis 
Rationale for Proposed Clinical Study  
In December 2019 the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee identified an outbreak of viral 
pneumonia cases of unknown cause. Coronavirus ribonucleic acid (RNA) was quickly identified in some of these patients. As of July, 2020 there were 15.5 million confirmed cases (>4 million in the US) and over 600,000 deaths (~145,000 in the US). There are currently no FDA approved prophylactic  intervention s against SARS -CoV -2 while  social distancing and personal protective 
equipment constitute our only viable countermeasures to help reduce the incidence of community transmission . While vaccine candidates are being developed at unprecedented 
speeds, their efficacy is completely unknown and will not be known for many months. 
 
Therefore, there is an urgent public health need for rapid development of novel protective measures , as well as improved therapeutic interventions. The EmitBio ™ RD19 device emits 
visible blue light  to stimulate host defenses (as explained below) to  eliminate invading 
pathogens in the oropharynx and surrounding tissues. The RD19 device does this without additional photosensitizers or chemical reagents that are typi[INVESTIGATOR_499146] . Specifically, selected wavelengths o f light have been evaluated 
across the visible spectrum, and it was discovered that safe, visible  blue light emitted from 
non-coherent LED sources could perform both of the following functions : 
(1) upregulate the sustained production of nitric oxide in epi[INVESTIGATOR_499147]  (NOSs);  
 
 
(2) stimulate the instantaneous release of the body’s bound stores of nitric  oxide. 
 
Nitric oxide produced naturally in epi[INVESTIGATOR_499148], including natural killer (NK) cells, neutrophils and macrophages 
to phagocytize virus -infected cells at the site of primary infection.

CONFIDENTIAL   
1.1.1 Claims and  Indication:  
The EmitBio ™ RD19 device uses blue light to boost the body’s natural immune response, 
which when combined with social distancing and proper mask use as part of healthy living, may 
help to reduce the risk of infection by [CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_499149] -CoV -2. 
This first -in-man (FIM) phase I study will evaluate the acute safety, tolerability, device 
acceptability for use among 25 healthy volunteers between the age of 18 and 45. Based on the 
results of extensive in -house research , a single dose ( 9 Joules/cm2) and schedule (twice a day  for [ADDRESS_642249] 4 hours , ideally 8 to 12 hours apart ) will be evaluated.  
Safety and tolerability  (local reactogenicity ) will be assessed actively at study day screening 
(baseline set), 1, 7 and 14, and on non- clinic visit days by [CONTACT_499164] a memory aid (diary cards). Volunteers will be encouraged to contact 
[CONTACT_499165] a  medically -urgent nature  as soon as is practically 
possible and to seek immediate medical care, if needed.  
Metabolic,  liver and kidney safety laboratory evaluations, as well as urinalysis, will be performed 
at screening and at Day 14 or early termination (and potentially during unscheduled) clinic visits. 
Hematological safety assessments will be performed at all visits.

2. INTRODUCTION 
2.1 Background and Study  Rationale  
In December 2019 the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee identified an outbreak of viral 
pneumonia cases of unknown cause. Coronavirus RNA was quickly identified in some of these patients. This novel Coronavirus (nCoV) has been abbreviated as 2019- nCoV and is now named 
SARS -CoV -2 (due to its similarity to the Severe Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_23223] [SARS] 
Coronavirus [CoV; SARS -CoV] ). It has 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS -like- 
CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS -CoV (Chan JF et al., 2020). The disease caused 
by [CONTACT_7544] -CoV -2 is called Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19). As of July, 2020 there were  
15.5 million confirmed cases (>  4 million in the US) and over 600,000 deaths (~145,000 in 
the US). There are currently no FDA approved prophylactic interventions against SARS -CoV -

2.2 Risk/Benefit  Assessment  
2.2.1 Known Potential Risks  
The potential risks of participating in this trial are those associated with having blood drawn and 
unlikely, but possible, mild local reactions to the EmitBio ™ RD19, entirely unknown adverse 
events, and inadvertent breach of confidentiality. 
Drawing blood may cause transient discomfort and fainting. Fainting is usually transient and managed by [CONTACT_226295]/her legs. Bruising at the blood draw site may occur but can be prevented or lessened by [CONTACT_119911] a few minutes after the blood is taken. 
Extensive evaluation of the RD19 and similar energy- based devices  routinely used for oral and 
skin care purposes have resulted in the Sponsor, after careful consideration, making the determination  that RD19 as a “Not Significant Risk” (NSR) device per FDA guidelines. 
EmitBio ™ RD19 is expected to be without significant risk for acute adverse events when used 
as directed. If the RD19 device is not used as directed, for example is inserted into the oral cavity improperly it is possible the user could induce a gag reflex.  If the RD19 device is used 
for a period of time in excess of the time directed , it is possible the user could experience mild 
to moderate erythema, and under extreme over use conditions  the user could experience oral 
mucosal  thermal injury,  especially to the uvula.  
Eye exposure is to be avoided . Direct illumination of unprotected eyes can result in damage to 
the retina, and especially the macula. Other eye structures can also experience thermal injury. Study staff must ensure volunteers understand to never point the RD19 device toward their or anyone else's eyes.  
Risks to Privacy: Subjects will be asked to provide personal health information (PHI). All attempts will be made to keep this PHI confidential within the limits of the law. However, there is a chance that unauthorized persons will see the subject’s PHI. All study records will be kept in a locked file cabinet or maintained in a locked room at the participating cl inical trial site(s). 
Electronic files will be password protected. Only people who are involved in the conduct, oversight, monitoring, or auditing of this trial will be allowed access to the PHI that is collected. Any publications from this trial will not use information that will identify subjects by  [CONTACT_2300].  
Organizations that may inspect and/or copy research records maintained at the participating clinical trial site(s) for quality assurance (QA) and data analysis include groups such as the IRB and the FDA. 
A description of this clinical trial will be posted on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov.  This web 
site will not include information that can identify subjects.  
There may be other risks, discomforts or side effects that are entirely unknown at this time.

2.2.2 Known Potential Benefits  
 
There is no guaranteed benefit to study participants. There is the potential for benefit to society 
resulting from insights gained from participation in this study due to the widespread, and accelerating, threat of SARS -CoV -2 and COVID -19. Use of EmitBio ™ RD19 may or may not 
provide protection against SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_642263] -in-man (FIM) phase I study will evaluate the acute safety, tolerability, and device 
acceptability for use among 25 healthy volunteers between the age of 18 and 45. Based on the 
results of numerous preclinical studies, a single dose (9 joules/cm2) and schedule (twice a day, 
separated by [CONTACT_2669] 4 hours, preferably 8 to 12 hours apart ) will be evaluated.  
Safety and tolerability  (local reactogenicity ) will be assessed actively at the following study 
days: screening (baseline set), 1, 7 and 14, and on non-clinic visit days by [CONTACT_499166] a memory aid (diary cards). Volunteers will be 
encouraged to promptly contact  [CONTACT_499167]’s 
Emergency Response Team for AEs of a  medically  urgent nature. 
A Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, as well as CBC with differential, urinalysis, and pregnancy 
testing will be performed at screening and at Day 14 or early termination (and potentially during 
unscheduled) clinic visits. Hematological safety assessments  (evaluation of methemoglobinemia)  
will be performed at all visits.  
Study volunteers will be asked to immediately contact [CONTACT_499168]/or the PI [INVESTIGATOR_499154]. Volunteers will 
be instructed to report to the clinical trial unit for an unscheduled visit or to seek the appropriate level of medical care based on the nature of their AE/SAE. In all such instances, all relevant information pertaining to these signific ant medical events will be captured on the 
appropriate e -CRFs.  
Hematology safety laboratory evaluations will be performed at screening, as well during all scheduled clinic visits. Laboratory assessments may be part of the evaluation of medically attended AE evaluation and for all SAEs. 
 
Upon ratification of the CTA, t he site will begin pre -recruitment outreach efforts  of potential 
volunteers within M3- WRA’s database to ascertain “ interest in general ” in this study. Official 
recruitment which may  include fliers, letters, telephone calls, etc. and specific recruitment of 
potential subjects who have previously participated in other clinical studies conducted at the site will occur only after formal IRB approval. Other forms and/or mechanisms of recruitment 
may also be used. The IRB will approve the recruitment process and all materials prior to use.  
Schedule of assessments can be found in Section 1.2, Schedule of Activities (Table 3).

3.3 Scientific Rationale for Study  Design  
The EmitBio ™ RD19 device is designed to place a protective countermeasure  in the hands of at 
population- risk individuals in order to reduce the incidence of SARS -CoV -2 and COVID -19. At 
population- risk individuals are those living where community- transmission of SARS -CoV -2 is 
likely to occur and where community transmission is a ctively occurring. Through the identified 
mechanisms of virus killing and inhibition of virus replication, the RD19 device is expected to 
reduce SARS -CoV -2 viral load which in combination with oth er lifestyle measures, may help  
reduce the incidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection.  This type of active protection is urgently needed 
for high- risk individuals (e.g. individuals exposed to a known infected person and healthcare 
workers and eldercare facility staff exposed to SARS -CoV -2 infected / COVID -19 patients and 
residents, respectively). The RD19 device has been engineered with the in tent to help curb 
community transmission of SARS -CoV -2, thereby [CONTACT_499169] -19. The 
CDC estimates that 40% of secondary coronavirus transmission occurs before people feel ill, highlighting the need for a broadly distributed protective countermeasure.

of visible  blue  light ( absent of UV  light ) to stimulate host defense and eliminate invading

5.2 Study Device and  Use 
5.2.1 Device Description  
 
The EmitBio ™ RD19 Device has been designed for ease of assembly in mass production and is 
comprised of the following three primary building blocks: 
 
Aluminum Housing – The aluminum housing has been engineered for function and designed for 
ergonomics.  The housing contains the LED metal core printed circuit board, the electronic LED power management circuit, an on/off switch interlocked with a timer, a rechargeable battery, and a removable 
cap for battery access.  Dynamic modeling has been utilized to improve the dissipation of excess heat from the LED array by [CONTACT_499172]19 within safe operating temperature limits.  
Incorporating a right angle, the housing also provides an ergonomic transition from the light source to the 
light delivery assembly as well as for single -handed use.  
 
Light source - Located inside of the aluminum housing, the light source consists of an array of LEDs on 
a metal core circuit board, an electronic LED power management circuit, and a rechargeable battery.  
The quantity and characteristics (e.g. optical power and wavelength) of the individual LEDs in the LED 
array have been chosen to promote light-stimulated release and upregulation of nitric oxide.  The focused 
zoom assembly has been engineered to improve homogenization of the light emitted from the LED array, 
transmit the pre-shaped beam into the oral cavity to a position approximately [ADDRESS_642280] tissue. 
 
Mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959] – A comfort shield made of biomedical grade plastic is applied to the exterior of the optical 
element to enhance oral comfort during use and to improve light delivery.  The positioning guard 
provides for repeatable placement of the RD -[ADDRESS_642281] device

5.2.2 Selection of Study Dose  
In repeated experiments, including experiments conducted by [CONTACT_499173], it 
has been determined that the EmitBio ™ RD19 device provides for a powerful reduction in vir al 
infectivity of host cells after a single five ( 3) minute illumination at a modest energy level of 9 
Joules/cm2. SARS -CoV-2 virus infectivity  is inhibited by 99% (approximately 2 logs) at this dose. 
Viral replication is inhibited by 99.9% (3 logs). Dosing twice a day allows NO levels to be elevated to an extent and for a time period expected to result in a high level anti- viral effect.  
5.3 Use / Storage & Maintenance / Accountability  
5.3.1 Acquisition and Accountability  
The sponsor will provide 27 RD19 (25 volunteers with two reserves) devices packaged in appropriately labelled separate clear containers containing all components as well as instructions for use by [CONTACT_19288].  Each RD19 device will be stamped on its power unit with a serial number.  Study staff will ensure that each device’s serial number is assigned to a specific study subject and the link between device serial number and study subject study number will be maintained on an accountability log.  Subj ects will be requested to bring their device to the clinic 
for each scheduled visit and study staff will confirm serial number and subject number are in concordance.  Upon termination of a subject’s participation in the trial, all RD19 devices and components must be returned to the study site and then to the study sponsor. 
5.3.2 Device Appearance  
RD19 Handle: ~6in.; Optic: ~3in. 

Version  2.[ADDRESS_642283], devices should be stored in a dry climate -controlled environment in the original plastic container

o Acceptability Assessment : 
o All subjects will complete a brief survey of device 
tolerability and acceptability. This will be completed during the 60 minute follow-up period after device use in the clinic. 
6.2.1 Definition of Adverse Event  (AE)  
AE means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention 
in humans, whether or not considered intervention-related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)). An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal clinical laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of 
medicinal (investigational) product. 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject is screened will be 
considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the severity of any pre-existing medical condition increases, it should be recorded as an AE. 
AEs can be further divided into solicited AEs and unsolicited AEs. Solicited AEs are 
those for which the study team will specifically query the subject whether they occurred. Unsolicited AEs are those events that the subject report occurring without being queried about the specific event.  
All AEs will be assessed for severity and relationship to study intervention. Reporting of all AEs, solicited and unsolicited, will occur during the period from study device administration on Day [ADDRESS_642294] and alternate etiology (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis as the participating clinical  site PI [INVESTIGATOR_29353]-investigator), date of resolution, seriousness, and 
outcome. AEs occurring during the study-collection and reporting period will be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. 
AEs will be followed to resolution or stabilization.  
Version  2.[ADDRESS_642295] resolution information for any reactogenicity symptoms that are not resolved during the active study period. 
Solicited AEs (i.e., reactogenicity) will be collected using a diary card  and recorded on the 
appropriate e-CRF  from the during the entire course of the study.  
For this study, solicited AEs include : 
• Illumination  site Pain 
• Illumination  site Erythema  
• Illumination  site Edema/Induration 
• Headache  
• Difficulty swallowing  
• Nausea  
• Fever  
• Chills  
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_642296] and/or in response to an open question from 
study staff or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination or other diagnostic procedures 
must be recorded on the appropriate e-CRF . 
Unsolicited AEs of all severities will be reported from the time of study device 
administration through study termination. 
 
6.2.4 Adverse Event  Reporting  
 
Information on all AEs should be recorded on the appropriate e -CRF. All clearly related 
signs, symptoms and results of diagnostic procedures performed because of an AE should 
be grouped together and recorded as a single diagnosis. If the AE is a clinical l aboratory 
abnormality that is part of a clinical condition or syndrome, it should be recorded as the syndrome or diagnosis and be described in  terms of duration (start and stop date ). 
 
6.2.5 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE is defined in 21 CFR 312.32 as follows: “An AE is considered serious if, in the view of either the participating clinical site PI [INVESTIGATOR_29353] -investigator or the sponsor, it 
results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death,  
• A life -threatening AE,

• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions, 
• Or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, are not immediately  life-
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. An e xample of such a medical event  would be an allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home to prevent the development of one of the definitions above. 
“Life- threatening” refers to an AE that at occurrence represents an immediate risk of 
death to a subject. An event that may cause death if it occurs in a more severe form is not 
considered life -threatening. Similarly, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_499161]. 
All SAEs, as with any AE, will be assessed for severity and relationship to study 
intervention. All SAEs will be recorded on the appropriate SAE e- CRF . 
 
All SAEs will be followed through resolution or stabilization by a study clinician, 
licensed to make medical diagnoses and listed as the participating clinical  site PI [INVESTIGATOR_168702]-investigator.

Regulatory Reporting of Device -related SAEs  
Following notification from the participating clinical site PI [INVESTIGATOR_29353] -
investigator, EmitBio Inc., as the sponsor, will report to the FDA and will copy the 
clinical site investigators on all reports of potential serious risks from clinical studies of RD19 , as soon as possible. EmitBio Inc. will report to the FDA any unexpected fatal or 
life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible, but in no case later than 7 
calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. If the eve nt is not fatal 
or life -threatening, an SAE safety report will be submitted within [ADDRESS_642300] from FDA, EmitBio ™ will submit to the FDA any 
additional data or information that the agency deems necessary, as soon as possible, but in no case later than [ADDRESS_642301]. 
SAEs that are not considered related to RD19 will not be reported to the FDA. 
 
6.2.7 Classification of an Adverse Event  
The determination of seriousness, severity and causality will be made by [CONTACT_63689]- site 
investigator who is qualified (licensed) to diagnose AE information, provide a medical 
evaluation of AEs and classify AEs based upon medical judgment. This includes, but is not limited to, physicians, physician assistants and nurse practitioners. 
 
6.2.8 Severity of Adverse Events  
All AEs or SAEs will be assessed for severity, according to the toxicity grading scales provided at A ppendix 2. 
For AEs not included in the protocol-defined grading system, the following guidelines will 
be used to describe severity. 
 
• Mild (Grade 1) : Events that are usually transient and may require only minimal or no 
treatment or therapeutic intervention and generally do not interfere with the subject’s 
usual activities of daily  living. 
• Moderate (Grade 2) : Events that are usually alleviated with additional specific 
therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living,  causing 
discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research subject.  
• Severe (Grade  3): Events interrupt usual activities  of daily  living, or significantly  affects 
clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. Severe events are usually incapacitating.  
Version  2.[ADDRESS_642302] 
assess the relationship of the event to the study device using the following guidelines: 
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention, there is a reasonable 
possibility that the study intervention caused the AE, or there is a close temporal relationship between the study intervention and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study intervention and the AE. 
• Null Determination  – The direction and magnitude towards related and not related is 
null. The investigator is stating simply, “I cannot determine a relationship”.  
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
intervention caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study 
intervention and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established.  
 
6.2.10 Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and  Follow- Up 
For this study: 
• Solicited and Unsolicited AEs will be recorded by [CONTACT_499181] 7, 14 and any unscheduled clinical trial unit visits.  
 
6.2.11 Adverse Event  Reporting  to Study Subjects  
 
• All device -attributed AE s and SAEs will be reported to participants in the study to better 
inform them of the potential risks vs. benefits of participation. 
 
6.2.12 Pregnancy Reporting  
 
• All positive urine pregnancy tests will be reported during screening and at the end of the 
study. Women who screen positive for pregnancy will be encouraged to see their primary health care provider for a serological confirmatory test.

requirements of [ADDRESS_642308]’s participation in the trial, and alt ernative treatments 
and procedures that may be available to the subject. The explanation will be organized and presented in lay terminology and language that facilitates understanding why one might or might not want to participate.  
Version  2.[ADDRESS_642309] (e.g., the 
participating clinical  site PI  [INVESTIGATOR_75534] ) for answers to any questions relating to the 
research project. Information will also include the foreseeable circumstances and/or reasons under which the subject’s participation in the trial may be terminated. The subjects will be informed that participa tion is voluntary and that they are free to withdraw 
from the study for any reason at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled.  
Subjects will be informed that records identifying the subject will be kept confidential, 
and, to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_29695]/or regulations, will not be made publicly available. If the results of the trial are published, the subject’s identity will remain confidential. Subjects will be informed, even if identifiers are removed, that information collected from this research and/or specimens may be used for secondary research, including the sharing of deidentified data.  
Subjects will be informed that the monitor(s), auditors(s), IRB, and Sponsor will be granted direct access to the subject’s original medical records for verification of clinical trial procedures and/or data without violating the confidentiality of the subject, to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_4913], and that , by [CONTACT_2960] a written ICF, 
the subject is authorizing such access.  
ICFs will be IRB -approved, and subjects will be asked to read and review the consent 
form. Subjects must sign the ICF prior to starting any study procedures being done 
specifically for this trial. Once signed, a copy of the ICF will be given to the subject  for 
their records.  
New information will be communicated by [CONTACT_499184] [INVESTIGATOR_435636]. The informed 
consent document will be updated, and subjects will be re -consented per IRB 
requirements, if necessary.

staff, and the sponsor(s) and their agents. This confidentiality is extended to cover clinical information relating to subjects, test results of biological specmens and all other 
information generated during participation in the study. No identifiable information concerning subjects in the study will be released to any unauthorized third party. Subject 
confidentiality will be maintained when study results are published or discussed in 
conferences.  
The study monitor, other authorized representatives of the sponsor  and r epresentatives of 
the IRB may inspect all documents and records required to be maintained by [CONTACT_499185], including, but not limited to, screening, medical and 
laboratory results  for the subjects in this study. The participating clinical  site will permit 
access to such records.  
All source records, including electronic data, will be stored in secured systems in 
accordance with institutional policies and federal regulations. 
All study data and research specimens that leave the site (including any electronic 
transmission of data) will be identified only by a coded number that is linked to a subject through a code key maintained at the clinical site. Names or readily identifying information will not be released unless strictly required by [CONTACT_2371].  
 
8.1.3 Clinical Monitoring  
 
Monitoring for this study will be performed by [CONTACT_257959].’s Clinical Program Manager. Monitoring will be conducted at frequent time points during the conduct of the trial. and will include, but is not limited to, source document verification, review of regulatory files, device accountability records, e -CRFs , ICFs, medical and laboratory reports, training 
records, and protocol and GCP compliance. The monitor will have access to  all study related documents  and will meet with  appropriate clinical site staff to discuss any problems and outstanding issues. Vis it findings and discussions will be documented.  Some 
monitoring visits make be conducted remotely.  
 
8.1.4 Quality Control (QC) and Quality Assurance  (QA) 
To ensure the reliability of study data, the clinical sites must maintain  a Clinical Quality 
Management Plan (CQMP). The CQMP describes r outine internal quality control (QC) 
and quality assurance ( QA) activities  for the purposes of measuring, documenting and 
reporting study conduct, protocol adherence, human subjects’ protections, and reliability 
of the protocol -driven data collected independent of sponsor site  monitoring.Data

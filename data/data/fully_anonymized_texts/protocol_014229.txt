10 Précis  Among people living with HIV (PLWH), there is a 50% increased risk of acute  myocardial infection compared to the general population(1). Although the advent of  highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has had several benefits for PLWH, including increased life expectancy(2), the longer life span has also made this population apt to develop comorbidities seen in age-matched individuals  without HIV, including cardiovascular disease. In addition, HAART itself is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD)(3), and persistent inflammation and chronic immune activation caused by [CONTACT_790234] a proinflammatory state that also  increases the risk for cardiovascular disease(4).   Hepatitis C (HCV) is another chronic viral infection with significant morbidity and mortality. The development of directly acting antivirals (DAAs) has dramatically improved the cure rate of HCV treatment. However, besides the effects on the liver, chronic infection with HCV leads to numerous extrahepatic manifestations that are  associated with morbidity and mortality, including cardiovascular disease(5, 6).  Therefore, patients co-infected with HCV and HIV have a magnified cardiovascular risk  than that of the general population (7). If treatment of HCV can lower the risk of CVD  among HIV and HCV co-infected patients, then this would provide an indication for early  HCV treatment in this population.  As such, we propose a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], intervention, non-randomized, controlled prospective  study to treat HCV in mono-infected and HIV co-infected individuals and compare  cardiovascular risk outcomes to HIV mono-infected controls. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_790223].           
CHROME V 10 January 2,  2020  
11 1 Background Information and Scientific Rationale 1.1 Background Information  Rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) are over twice as high in HIV-infected individuals compared to matched uninfected controls, with rates anticipated to increase as this population ages(8).  Factors contributing to increased risk of CVD in HIV-infected patients remain unclear, but there is considerable evidence suggesting that concurrent viral disease, especially HCV, is an important contributing factor. With the advent of direct acting antivirals (DAA), HCV is now a factor that can be easily eliminated. Hepatitis C (HCV) co-infection occurs in approximately one-third of all patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the U.S(9). The early treatment of HCV in this population could be an important intervention to reduce the burden of liver disease; thus far, early treatment has been a controversial intervention in patients with no fibrosis given the cost of HCV treatment. Moreover, chronic HCV is an important model for understanding the role of chronic viruses in accelerating inflammation and organ dysfunction in multiple anatomic sites. While some studies have strongly suggested that hepatitis C (HCV) co-infection is associated with increased rates of CVD in HIV-infected patients, results in all studies have not been consistent. However, several of these larger cohort studies included predominantly Caucasian and male participants in the pre-antiretroviral therapy era(8).  Given that HIV, HCV, and atherosclerosis are all associated with chronic inflammation and immune activation, it can be challenging to understand relative disease pathogenesis when found concurrently in individual patients. Identifying predictors of CVD progression from overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_790224]. If HCV confers additional risk for CVD among HIV-infected patients, this would provide further impetus to treat HCV early and aggressively in this population.    Myocardial injury and vascular complications associated with HIV can be differentiated by [CONTACT_790235]. Cardiac MRI is an established modality for the evaluation of myocardial injury and cardiac function(10, 11). Infarcted regions in the myocardium, having undergone scar formation with collagen deposition, have a much slower washout rate of gadolinium-based contrast than healthy myocardium, leading to significantly increased signal intensity on T1-weighted imaging. Therefore, the presence and size of regional myocardial fibrosis due to ischemic heart disease can be accurately assessed with delayed contrast enhancement MRI (12). Unlike computed tomography, with which Hounsfield units can be used as a reference scale for attenuation, with conventional MRI techniques, signal intensity is expressed on an arbitrary scale that differs from one imaging examination to another and therefore is unsuitable for direct signal quantification. Theoretically, diffusely fibrotic myocardium would accumulate contrast in a similar fashion to regional scarring, but calculation of the T1 time is required for its quantification, and is a technique that we have expertise with at the NIH. Measurement of cardiac function is a well described prognostic tool to evaluate myocardial health, and is also an integral component of a complete cardiac MRI conducted at the NIH. This modality may be effective in distinguishing variable myocardial injury between HIV mono-infected and HIV/HCV co-infected individuals. In 
CHROME V [ADDRESS_1088861], a prior study of 18 patients demonstrated worse cardiac function and morphology in HIV/HCV patients who underwent cardiac MRI and spectroscopy for measures of cardiac function, myocardial fibrosis, and steatosis which compared to HIV mono-infected controls(13). However further studies are necessary to reinforce this finding, and elucidate underlying mechanisms of injury.  The objective of this study is to determine the impact of functional cure of HCV (sustained virologic response [SVR]) on cardiovascular risk and progression of CVD in a population of HCV mono-infected and HIV/HCV-coinfected patients compared to HIV mono-infected controls.  1.2 Institutional Overview  Overview of the DC PFAP Hepatitis Program   In 2008, the National Institutes of Health and the DC Department of Health collaborated to establish the DC Partnership for HIV/AIDS Progress (DC PFAP), a partnership for community-based clinical care and research whose aim is to reduce the incidence and prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the District of Columbia. A plan was developed to create a research program to build a sustainable model for urban areas working to reduce the HIV/AIDS crisis. A needs assessment within the area’s medical community demonstrated a significant deficit in hepatitis C virus care and treatment. This led to the development of a Hepatitis branch within DC PFAP, rooted in direct subspecialty medical services and clinical research addressing the limitations of standard of care therapy.   The Hepatitis program is currently based at the Institute of Human Virology and operates out of three campuses: (1) clinical partners within Washington DC, (2) National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD and (3) University of Maryland Institute of Human Virology, Baltimore, MD. The overarching goals of the programs are to:  • establish improved access to subspecialty care for underinsured patients with HIV  • develop access to HIV- and hepatitis-related research for residents of DC • expand integrated care for hepatitis C in the community HIV clinics  • provide national leadership in the development and delivery of effective, safe, convenient therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], initially focusing on HCV   The clinical aspects of the program are set within partner centers in Washington DC and Baltimore City. In the Unity clinic system in Washington DC, we have established relationships with the providers and access to a cohort of patients with HIV and Hepatitis C. In Baltimore City, the Center for Infectious Disease (CID) provides comprehensive care services for a range of infectious diseases, including HIV and hepatitis C. Patients are managed by [CONTACT_790236]. We also have an active clinic at the UMB Drug Treatment Center (DTC) treating patients for HCV. To date, over [ADDRESS_1088862] linkage to care, effective treatment, and continual outcome

Because insufficient data regarding dosing or adverse events (AEs) are available in adults to judge the potential risk in children, this study poses greater than minimal risk and does not meet the Department of Health and Human Services guideline 45 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 46, subpart D, governing the participation of children in research. 4.3.[ADDRESS_1088874] to be withdrawn; continued collection of data from incarcerated subjects would be on a case-by-case basis after consultation with the IRB.  5 INTERVENTIONS  5.1 Concomitant Medications and Procedures  All concomitant prescription and over the counter medications taken during study participation will be recorded.  For this protocol, a prescription medication is defined as a medication that can be prescribed only by a properly authorized/licensed clinician.   1.[ADDRESS_1088875] of care.   6 Study Schedule  Study visits, including screening, will occur at the Center for Infectious Diseases (CID) or Drug Treatment Center (DTC) at the University of Maryland, or a Unity Healthcare clinic, based upon scheduling availability to accommodate each treatment group. The research coordinators will also oversee research operations in the clinics. See Appendix B for a detailed Study Schedule.  All phlebotomy related to the study will be done by a phlebotomist working in the clinic or clinic staff. All laboratory studies related to standard of care will be performed as per the standard practice at the site. All blood samples for storage for research will be couriered to the IHV lab.  All Cardiac MRIs will be performed at the National Institues of Health (NIH).   Participants will be given a calendar of scheduled study visits and will be informed that any clinic visits outside of scheduled study visits may be either unscheduled visits or non-study visits. Subjects will receive this information when given the visit calendar.  Participants who are no-show for visits will be contact[CONTACT_790239]. 6.1 Screening /Enrollment Screening will occur at the collocated HCV clinics at the Unviersity of Maryland Insistutes of Human Virology, CID or DTC, and the Unity Healthcare Center. Subjects who meet inclusion criteria and who consent to the study will be enrolled. Outside labs performed within the last [ADDRESS_1088876] at screening visit.

See Appendix C for MRI procedure and specific inclusion and exclusion criteria.  6.[ADDRESS_1088877] of care guidelines. 6.4 Study procedures – HCV treatment  During HCV treatment and in the follow-up period, patients with HCV will undergo monitoring for treatment adherence and safety per Standard of Care. Laboratory parameters and imaging used as part of the study endpoints are listed below. See Appendix B Study Schedule.  Cholesterol measurements Patients’ total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol will be obtained at screening and week 72 for cardiac risk calculations.  Cardiac biomarker and systemic inflammation assessment For all participants, labs will be drawn at screening, week 24, and week 72: high sensitivity CRP (hSCRP), high sensitivity TRP (hsTRP), soluble markers of inflammation (IFN-ϒ, TNF-α, IL-6, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11) and activated and exhausted naïve and memory T cells (percent of CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells which are HLA-DR+, CD38+, Tim-3+, or PD-1+).    Cardiac MRI A subset of patients will undergo cardiac MRI; up to 12 patients will be recruited from each of the three groups to  undergo cardiac MRI at the NIH clinical center at Day -7 (interim visit) and week 72. Patients who are claustrophobic or cannot tolerate the MRI procedure will not be selected for this portion of the study. Cardiac MRI will be utilized to assess changes in myocardial injury, degree of post-contrast enhancement, T1 mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and the function of the myocardium. See Appendix C for more details.  6.4.1 Stored sample collection Blood samples for storage and research will be obtained at screening (total of 11 tsp), and at weeks 24 and 72 (a total of 9 ½ tsp). Samples collected will include:  • Serum storage (10 mL) SST/tiger top (2 teaspoons) • Plasma storage (6ml) EDTA (1 teaspoon) • DNA paxgene will be collected (8.5ml) one time at baseline (1 ½ teaspoon) • RNA paxgene will be collected (2.5ml) (1/2 teaspoon)

The results will be used to characterize each individual with regards to immune status and chronicity of disease. Studies on research samples may include the following: A] HCV genome sequencing may be performed on plasma using the protocol as described and compared for variability and relatedness of sequences.  B] We will screen sera from all patients for differential expression of protein using multiplex cytokine arrays, which has the capability of detecting several different cytokines and other biologically relevant proteins.  C] We will perform detailed phenotypic and functional evaluation of immune cell types in the periphery. This will help us in determining the nature of antiviral immune responses in patients who are chronically infected, achieve SVR and acquire new HCV and HIV infections. Determination of specific immune defects in these individuals are important milestones in deciding future therapeutics and protective immunity to reinfection. Exhaustion and activation markers on T, B and NK cells will be quantified. Specific immune responses against pooled HCV peptides will be performed using an ELISPOT assay and/or  flow cytometry.  Future use of the specimens will be based on the scientific merit of the investigation and would be decided by [CONTACT_079]. They would be related to the study of HCV and/or HIV. Other investigators may wish to study these samples and/or data.  In that case, IRB approval must be sought prior to any sharing of samples and/or data.  Any clinical information shared about the sample would similarly require prior IRB approval. If approved, and once a Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) has been established, the study team may send de-identified samples to the collaborators. Investigators will use stored samples only for research.  8.1 Intended Use:  Some blood samples may be stored for future analysis in this research study. These samples will be stored by [CONTACT_790241], the immune system and/or other related medical conditions. The blood will be used over time to gain a better understanding of the pathogenesis of HCV and HIV.  Genetic testing will be performed. Different analytical

The consent will include language for specimen storage. 8.2 Storage:   Samples will be kept in secure facilities with limited access. Samples and data will be stored using a unique identifier.  Only investigators and study staff will have access to the samples and data.  8.3 Tracking:   Extra blood samples will be stored using a unique identifier that only the study team can trace back to the participants. These stored samples as well as a linkage file will be maintained in a database that will be managed by [CONTACT_7183]/or Study Coordinators and will be maintained on the IHV server. This database will also be stored on the password-protected computer of the Lead-Investigator/Study Coordinator in an encrypted and/or password-coded file. 8.4 Disposition at the Completion of the Protocol:  At the completion of the protocol (termination), samples and data will either be destroyed, or after IRB approval, transferred to another existing protocol. Final disposition of any samples cannot be done without written permission from the PI. 8.5 Reporting the Loss or Destruction of Samples/Specimens/Data to the IRB:  • Any loss or unanticipated destruction of samples or data resulting in a violation that compromises the scientific integrity of the data collected for the study will be reported to the IRB.  • Participants may request at any point not to have their samples stored. In this case, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_790227]. This decision will not affect the subject’s participation in any other protocols.   Generally, the results from the research stored samples will not be given to the participant's primary care provider or appear in the medical record. This is because the test results, unlike routine medical testing, may be experimental or preliminary. The relevance of these tests to direct patient care may be unknown. At the participant's request, the results of any research tests will be discussed with the primary care physician by [CONTACT_32366].

Only those reportable Adverse Events (AEs) related to the research procedures will be reported or those not expected from cardic MRI (expected MRI AEs are Mild allergic reaction to contrast agents; Acute renal insufficiency related to iodine-based contrast agent; Subcutaneous injection of contrast agents). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_790228].  9.1 Recording/Documentation At each contact [CONTACT_10970], information regarding adverse or unexpected events related to research procedures will be elicited by [CONTACT_790242].  Source documents will include an electronic health record and laboratory reports. Source documents will be reviewed in a timely manner by [CONTACT_5051]. 9.2 Definitions Adverse Event: Any untoward medical occurrence in a human subject, including any abnormal sign, symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research.    Protocol Deviation: Any change, divergence, or departure from the IRB approved study procedures in a research protocol. Protocol deviations are designated as serious or non-serious and further characterized as: • Those that occur because a member of the research team deviates from the protocol. • Those that are identified before they occur, but cannot be prevented. • Those that are discovered after they occur. 9.[ADDRESS_1088883] of the protocol will not be reported to the IRB unless they occur at a rate greater than anticipated by [CONTACT_3476]. Expected adverse events will not be reported to the IRB unless they occur at a rate greater than that known to occur in those having phlebotomy procedures normally. If the rate of these events exceeds the rate expected by [CONTACT_3476], the events will be classified and reported. Deaths related to the natural history of hepatitis will be reported at the time of continuing review (see annual reporting to the IRB). If a death occurrs while the participant is at the NIH it would be reported to the Clinical Director of the Clinical Center, the Clinical Director of NHLBI, and the UMB PI [INVESTIGATOR_790229].

Based on a previous study, mean hsCRP before starting IFN-therapy in HCV-monoinfected patients was 0.97±0.11 mg/L compared to 0.07± 0.07 mg/L in healthy controls(23). Among SVR patients the median hsCRP at baseline was 0.64 mg/L and decreased to 0.25 mg/L after treatment. With a sample size of 30 patients in each group, we assume than 95% will achieve SVR with Zepatier (elbasvir/grazoprevir), resulting in a sample size of [ADDRESS_1088888] analysis (from baseline to 12-month post-treatment), with a=0.05, power of 90% (1-b), and standard deviation (σ) = 0.15, we will be able to detect a true difference in the mean hsCRP response of matched pairs of 0.1 mg/L in each group or 0.8 mg/L with 80% power. 13.2 Statistical Analysis  We will perform univariate analysis to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of the study population. Count with percentages will be calculated for categorical variables and mean + standard deviation or median (interquartile range) for continuous variables. The independent variable is the three groups of participants with HCV, HIV/HCV, and HIV. Separate analysis will be done for each study group for the change in the primary outcome of HsCRP, from baseline to [ADDRESS_1088889] or Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables and chi-square test of independence or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. A linear regression model will be used in adjusted analysis for continuous dependent variables, while logistic regression model will be used in adjusted analysis for binary dependent variables.

34 APPENDIX C: Cardiac MRI Introduction and MRI Procedure Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an excellent imaging modality capable of assessing cardiac anatomy, myocardial function, myocardial infarction/fibrosis, as well as many other types of myocardial diseases. Patients infected with the hepatitis C virus are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Cardiac MRI can be used to assess for epi[INVESTIGATOR_790232], sequela of epi[INVESTIGATOR_171435], such as myocardial infarction, as well as microvascular disease. Each patient participating in the MRI scan will receive an oral and written explanation of the purposes, procedures, and risks of this study in language appropriate for the individual’s level of understanding.  All cardiac MRI scans for this study will be performed on an FDA approved 3.0T or 1.5T scanner (Aera - Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, [LOCATION_013]). The radiofrequency power levels (SAR limits) will be kept within the FDA established limits. A body coil will be used during the exam. A body coil is a noninvasive device external to the body that acts as antennae to receive radiofrequency signals out of the body. The body coil used during the MRI exam will follow FDA parameters. For the cardiovascular MRI exam, patients will receive an intravenous injection of gadolinium chelate (Gadavist, 0.15 mmol/kg) via an MRI compatible power injector.  Inclusion Criteria for the Cardiovascular MRI 18 years of age or older Written informed consent  Exclusion Criteria for the Cardiovascular MRI Patients with the following devices are excluded from participating in the cardiovascular MRI study: • Central nervous system aneurysm clip • Implanted neural stimulator • Implanted cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator • Cochlear implant • Ocular foreign body (e.g. metal shavings) • Implanted insulin pump • Metal shrapnel or bullet The following groups of people are excluded: • Pregnant women • Lactating women unless they are willing to discard breast milk for 24 hours after receiving gadolinium • Patients with stable renal disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30ml/min/1.73 m2 body surface area). The eGFR must be within [ADDRESS_1088893] laboratories the same day as the MRI exam. 
CHROME V 10 January 2,  2020  
35 • Patients with acute renal disease.  Monitoring Patients during the Cardiovascular MRI scan The cardiovascular MRI exam is expected to last [ADDRESS_1088894] to withdraw from the MRI scan at any point.  Benefits/Risks of the Cardiovascular MRI The cardiovascular MRI exam with gadolinium contrast involves greater than minimal risk, however may be of direct benefit to the individual patients [45 CFR 46.102(i)]. A clinical report of the exam will be available for the patients’ physician.  MRI does not use ionizing radiation, and is extremely safe on a properly screened population. There is potential risk related to the magnetic field strength in patients with implanted metal devices (cochlear implants, etc), resulting in movement of these objects and subsequent harm to the patients. Patients will be screened for these objects (see exclusion criteria above) and excluded if they meet any of the exclusion criteria. Peripheral nerve stimulation is unlikely to occur with our imaging parameters. It occurs when the magnetic field gradient switch occurs so fast that it results in peripheral nerve depolarization. The patient may feel a twitch or possibly some pain. Patient education as well as audio feedback from the patient during the exam will be used for the issue of possible peripheral nerve stimulation. The scanner is operated within FDA guidelines for radiofrequency power levels. However, there is a small chance that a damaged or dysfunctional coil could cause some local warming in the body. Thus, for safety purposes, we ask all patients to report this sensation so we can modify scans and also verify the integrity of the hardware.  Gadolinium Administration for the Cardiovascular MRI exam Patients must have an IV placed for gadolinium administration. Potential risks of IV placement include discomfort, bruising/bleeding, and vasovagal reactions. The gadolinium agent used for the cardiovascular MRI exam, Gadavist, is commercially available and routinely used in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_790233]. Studies in large patient populations have shown that gadolinium is safe without side effects in the majority of patients. If side effects occur, they are often mild and include headache and nausea. Severe reaction such as shortness of breath, wheezing, and hypotension are rare. The US Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning that the administration of gadolinium (updated September 9, 2010) has been associated with development of a disease call nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). All cases to date have occurred in patients with severe renal disease, including patients on dialysis. NSF has been nearly eradicated by [CONTACT_790245] <30cc/min.4-[ADDRESS_1088895] agents. The effects (adverse or otherwise) of gadolinium deposition in patients with normal renal function remains unclear and the FDA investigation is ongoing. The gadolinium agent used for our cardiovascular MRI exams is Gadavist, which is a macrocyclic type of gadolinium contrast based agent. Macrocyclic agents are currently considered the safest type of gadolinum based contrast agent available.  References 1. Niendorf HP, Alhassan A, Geens VR, Clauss W.

2/Protocol CP40617 , Version 2PROTOCOL A MENDMENT, VERSION 2 :
RATIONA LE 
In addition to updates initiated in this Version 2, t his amendment contains updates m ade 
in aVersion 1 (VHP only) amendment approved on 27 November 2018 (applicable to 
countries under Voluntary Harmonization Procedure [ VHP]only). Protocol Version 2
super sedes Protocol Version 1 and Version 1 VHP.
Changes to the protocol are summarized below:
Thestudy sample size waschange from approximately 240 to approximately 36
6
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836145] .  This change 
wasbased upon a blinded review of the time to clinical improvement (TTCI )data 
from patients recruited during the northern hemisphere 2018/ 2019 flu season and the 
incorporation of a planned futility interim analysis (see Section 6 ).
The optional interim analysis was changed to a formal,pre-planned , unbl inded, 
non-binding futi lity analysis .  It will be conducted after approximately 65% of TTCI 
events and will be based on the TTCI and the Lan-DeMets Pocock beta spending 
function (Section 6.7.1).
The endpoint “ time to clinical response ” was moved from a nexploratory endpoint to 
an additional key secondary endpoint at the request of the FDA (Section 2) .
Thepalatability and acceptability endpoint was added to address arequest from the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) Pediatric Committee ( PDCO )to assess the 
acceptability of the baloxavir marboxil granules for oral suspension formulation
(Section 2, Section 4.5.15 , Section 6.4.5, and Appendix 5).
The number of sites to enroll patients was updated from approximately 215 global 
sites to 250 sites to allow for the increase in sample size(Section 3.1) .
Known hypersensitivity to baloxavir marboxil or the drug product excipi[INVESTIGATOR_836146] (Section 4.1.2) .
A section was added to summarize post -marketing safety data that identified 
hypersensitivity reactions (i.e., anaphylaxis /anaphylact icreaction s, angioedema, and 
urticaria) as adverse drug reactions during post -marketing use of baloxavir marboxil 
(Section 1.2.4).  In the event of a anaphylaxis or other form of hypersens itivity 
reaction ,advice that p
atients should be withdrawn from study treatment was included 
(Section 4.6.1) .
Other additions and clarifications :
Summary information was added for intravenous zanamivir (Dectova), which 
recently received a positive opi[INVESTIGATOR_836147] -threatening influenza A 
or B virus infection in adult and pediatric patients (Section 1.1).
A section was added to summarize results from a Phase III, double -blind , 
randomized, placebo -and active -controlled study investigating baloxavir marboxil in 
patients at high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_201663] -related complications (Section 1.2.3). 
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
3/Protocol CP40617 , Version 2Thetiming of the v ital signs and assessments for National Early W arning Score 2 
(NEW S2)was clarified ,as indicated in the clarification letters sent to sites ,to ensure 
all vital sign parameters and NE WS2 assessments are collected together and that 
assessment timepoints are spread throughout the study day to reflect the patient’s 
conditi on over the entire study day, where possible (Sections 4.5.4; Appendix 5 
footnotes).   
The vitals sign data to be utilized during screenin g to calculate the NE WS2 score 
was clarified, as indicated in the clarification letters sent to sites ,to ensure that all 
data collected closest to but before randomi zation should be used for the NE WS2 
score calculation and assessment of patient eligibility (Section 4.5.6 andAppendix 3) .
Clarification was added that the modified intent -to-treat infected (mITTI) population 
would be used in efficacy analyses. Clarification was also added that full details of 
analysis methods will be contained within the Statistical Analysis Plan (Section 6.4).
The following minor revisions were made for clarification or for consistency acr oss 
sections/Schedule of Activities :
–Study Treatment Preparation (Section [IP_ADDRESS]):  Text was aligned with 
Pharmacy Manual following protocol clarification letter. 
–Cautionary Therapy (Section 4.4.2):  Dairy products and calcium -fortified 
beverages was added to the list of cautionary therap ies. The word “oral” was 
added to laxatives and antacids for clarity . In addition, the phrase “where 
possible” was also added to match wording for this section (i.e., cautionary, not 
prohibited).
–Pharmacokinetic Analyses (Section 6.6):  The text was updated to describe how 
patients with 2 or 3 study treatment doses will be analyzed separately.  It was 
also stated that population PK model outcomes would be reported in a separate 
report.
–Schedule of Activities: The End o f Study (EOS) column was moved so it is 
included under the Follow -Up Period heading for clarity . 
–Schedule of Activities: The timing of Visit 8 was clarified in a footnote to ensure 
that Visit 8 did not occur on the same day as Visit 7.
–Other minor clarifications and corrections were made throughout the protocol for 
clarify, consistency, or to align text with clarification letters. These are indicated 
by [CONTACT_836211].
Updates in line with Xofluza®(baloxavir marboxil) approvals and documentation: Core 
Data Sheets ( CDS ), Investigator’s Brochure , Drug Safety Update Report ( DSUR).
Rationale for patient populat ion (Section 3.3.2): Text was updated to align with
approvals as well as current and potentially future Clinical Development Plan ( CDP ).
Safety plan update ( Section 5.1):  Text was updated to align with the Sponsor ’s
documentation and approvals .
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
4/Protocol CP40617 , Version 2The following updates were made to bring the protocol into alignment with recent 
updates to the company ’sprotocol model document:
Text has been modified to account for the fact that special situations (i.e., accidental 
overdoses and medication errors) are not required to be reported within 24 hours 
(Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and 5.4).  Note that serious adverse events associated with 
special situations are still required to be reported within 24 hours.
Language has been updated to indicate that therapeutic or elective abortions are not 
considered adverse events unless performed because of an underlying maternal or 
embryofetal toxicity.  In such c ases, the underlying toxicity should be reported as a 
serious adverse event.  Language has also been added to clarify that all abortions 
are to be reported on the paper Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
Language has been added for consistency with [COMPANY_002]'s current data retention policy 
and to accommodate more stringent local requirements (if applicable) (Section 7.5).
Language has been added to indicate that the study will comply with applicable local, 
regional, and national laws (Se ction 8.1).
Language has been revised to clarify that data posting will not be limited to clinical
trial registries and to clarify that redacted Clinical Study Reports are provided only if 
requirements of [COMPANY_002]'s global policy on data sharing have been met (Section 9.5).
The following updates were made in the Version 1 (VHP only) amendment per VHP 
request ,except where noted , and are being carried forward into this Version 2 
amendment :
Known hypersensitivity to baloxavir marboxil or the drug product excipi[INVESTIGATOR_836148] (Section 4.1.2).
The Medical Monitor has changed and updated contact [CONTACT_836212] (Section 5.4.1).
Language regarding written informed consent for adolescents unable to legally 
provide consent wasrevised to accommodate situations where a local regulatory or 
Independent Review Board/Ethics Committee policy requires written informed 
consent from both parents (Section 4.5.1).  Section 8.2 has been amended 
accordingly.
The type of pregnancy test at screening has been changed from a urine pregnancy 
test to a serum pregnancy test (Section 4.5.7 and Appendix 1).   In this Version 2 
amendment, the requirement at screening wasclarified as follows:  serum pregnancy 
tests for VHP sites and serum or urine pregnancy tests for sites in the rest of the 
world.
In order to correct an error in Version 1, t ext wasadded stating that patients who 
discontinue study treatment should continue in the study and complete all scheduled 
study asse ssments/visits per protocol, where possible (Section 4.6.1).
In order to correct an error in Version 1, t ext wasupdated to clarify that patients who 
discontinue from the study will be asked to complete a study discontinuation visit, at 
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
5/Protocol CP40617 , Version 2which time the asse ssments per the end of study visit should be conducted 
(Section 4.6.2). 
Text wasadded to clarify the censoring of patients who discontinue for any reason 
prior to achieving a clinical response event.  Text has been added stating that a 
sensitivity analys is for subjects who discontinue for any reason prior to achieving a 
clinical response event will be performed to investigate potential confounding factors 
and detailed in the SAP along with any further sensitivity analyses (Section 6.4.1).
The Schedule of Activities was updated to reflect updates made in the body of the text 
and to correct minor typographical errors.  
Substantive new information from both amendments (i.e., Version 2 and Version 1 [VHP 
only]) appears in italics.  This amendment represents cumulative changes to the original 
protocol.

Study Design
Description of Study
This is a Phase III, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multicenter study to assess 
the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of baloxavir marboxil in combination with a SOC NAI 
(i.e., oseltamivir, zanamivir, or peramivir), compared with a matching placebo in combination 
with a SOC NAI in approximately 366hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836154] (aged 
12years) with influenza.
Patients will be randomized as soon as possible after screening (ideally within 12 hours) ,
providing they are within 96 hours of sy mptom onset and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] (includes assessment in 
emergency  centers pending admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_111494]).  Patients will be assigned in a 
2:1ratio to receive baloxavir marboxil or matching placebo.  Study treatment must be given in 
combination with a SOC NAI according to investigator preference (i.e., oseltamivir, zanamivir, or 
peramivir).  Re -screening of patients who fai l to meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be 
permitted only once, providing the time from sy mptom onset to randomization is still within 96 
hours.
Baloxavir marboxil will be administered as a weight -based dose (40 mg for patients weighing 
40to 80 kg, 80 mg for patients weighing 80 kg) on Days 1 and 4, and also on Day 7 if clinical 
improvement has not occurred at Day 5, per protocol defined criteria.  Treatment with a SOC 
NAI (i.e., oseltamivir, zanamivir, or peramivir ) should be administered in accordance with local 
clinical practice.  To fully explore the utility of the combination with baloxavir marboxil, or

18/Protocol CP40617 , Version 2Investigational Medicinal Products
The investigational medicinal products (IMPs) for this study are baloxavir marboxil and its 
matching placebo as the comparator.
Test Product (Investigational Drug)
Baloxavir marboxil or its matching placebo will be administered orally according to body weight 
(40mg for patients weighing 40 to 80 kg; 80 mg for patients weighing 80 kg), either in tablet 
form or granules for oral suspension for patients unable to swallow or with a nasogastric tube in 
situ (e.g., i n intubated patients).  Dosing will occur on Day [ADDRESS_1161050] 1 of the following specific 
criteria at Day 5:ongoing mechanical ventilation, persistent fever, severely 
immunocompromised, pneumonia, or confirmed/suspected influenza- related complication.
Non-Investigational Medicinal Product
Standard- of-Care Neuraminidase Inhibitor
The protocol -defined SOC NAIs are oseltamivir, zanamivir, or peramivir.
An open -label SOC NAI should be administered according to local clinical practice (i.e., 
oseltamivir, peramivir, or zanamivir) to ensure anti -viral activity is maintained from Day 1 
through Day 5.  The SOC NAI treatment may  be extended to Day 10 or beyond at the discretion 
of the investigator and in accordance with local clinical practice.  Special attention is required for 
dosing in patients with renal impairment, as dose adjustment may  be needed.
Statistical Methods
Primary A nalysis
The primary  efficacy  objective for this study is to evaluate the efficacy of baloxavir marboxil plus 
a SOC NAI, compared with matching placebo plus SOC NAI on the basis of the following 
endpoint:
Time to clinical improvement (TTCI; defined as time to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836159] S2 
of [ADDRESS_1161051])
The median TTCI will be compared between the baloxavir marboxil plus SOC NAI and matching 
placebo plus SOC NAI arms using the stratified log -rank test within three regions (i.e., North 
America; Europe, Middle East, and Africa [ EMEA]; rest of world [ROW ]), NEWS2 (7, 7), and 
time from sy mptom onset to study treatment ( 48 hours, 48 hours) included as the 
stratification factors.  The Kaplan- Meier plot, median time to response, and their 95% CI, and a 
p-value will be presented.
The log -rank test requires the assumption of proportional hazards to be met.  The proportional 
hazards assumption will be tested gra phically using the log cumulative hazard plot by [CONTACT_6490].  The plots for each treatment group will be parallel if the proportional hazard assumption 
holds.  Using a Cox model ,the slope of a linear regression will also be tested and a plot of 
scale d Schoenfeld residuals against the Kaplan -Meier estimator will be investigated.  Should 
the proportional hazards assumption be violated ,the Gehan -Wilcoxon test will be used to 
analyze the data as the logrank test can be under powered in this situation. Al l investigations 
will be detailed in the statistical section of the CSR .  
The estimand is the median change in TTCI.  This absolute measure will be assessed over the 
duration of the study (35 days).  Intercurrent events are those that occur after treatmen t 
initiation and either preclude observation of the variable or affect its interpretation.  Intercurrent 
events will be accounted for through censoring rules.  Patients who are lost to follow -up, who do 
not have a clinical response event, who die or discon tinue for any reason prior to achieving a 
clinical response event will be censored at their last contact [CONTACT_836214], whichever is 
applicable.  No dose reductions or treatment cross -overs are anticipated.  
The primary  efficacy  analy sis populatio n will be characterized through the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and will be the modified intent -to-treat (influenza -)infected ( mITTI) population, which 
consists of all patients who were randomized to treatment, received a dose of study drug, and 
were RT -PCR positive for influenza (centrally assessed) at any timepoint .
A sensitivity analysis will be conducted where patients who are lost to follow -up or who do not 
have a clinical response event will be assumed to have had an event at 28 days.  A sensitivity
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
19/Protocol CP40617 , Version 2analysis for patients who discontinue for any reason prior to achieving a clinical response 
event will be performed to investigate potential confounding factors. Asensitivity analysis, 
considering death as a competitive event, using a competing risk mode l will be conducted if 
there are a sufficient number of deaths or an imbalance between groups in deaths and reason 
attributed.  These and any further sensitivity analyses will be fully detailed in the SAP. 
Missing data handling rules for the components of the NE WS2 score will be specified in the 
SAP.
Determination of Sample Size
Two new factors influenced the revised sample size:  1) the revised assumption for the placebo 
plus NAI control -arm TTCI following blinded data review and 2) the faster than antici pated 
enrollment rate.  Integration of these two factors informed a sample size readjustment to 
approximately 366 randomized patients .  Assuming that the RT -PCRpositive rate (tested in 
a central laboratory) will be 75% of the randomized population and a dropout rate of 4% the 
mITTI population will be 264 patients (i.e., 176 patients in the baloxavir marboxil group and 
88 in the placebo group).  
The total number of randomized patients may  change based on the percentage of patients who 
are RT- PCR positive d uring the study.
The total m ITTI sample size of 264patients provides at least 80% power using the Logrank 
Chi-Square test to detect a 31 -hour difference in TTCI between treatment groups under the 
following assumptions:  median TTCI in the placebo plus NAI group is 94 hours, 840 hours 
follow -up (35 days)using 5% alpha. The minimal detectable difference is expecte d to be 
around 23hours.  The alteration of the TTCI in the placebo plus NAI group to 94 hours was 
selected after consideration of the response rates observed in a blinded review of TTCI 
including data from 127 patients .
The increased sample size has the c onsequential benefit of a larger population for safety 
analysis of the combination and multiple dose regimen specifically tested in this study for the 
severely illhospi[INVESTIGATOR_836160].
The study power is calculated based on the primary endpoint incorporating a group sequential 
design (GSD) using a beta spending function with non -binding rule, to allow for one futility 
interim, without increasing the overall experiment -wise error rate.
Interim A nalyses
After approximately 65% of TTCI events, a formal unblinded non -binding futility interim 
analysis based on the TTCI will be performed.  The futility interim analysis will use a Lan -
DeMets Pocock beta spending function.  If the hazard ratio seen at the interim is below the 
calculated futility bound , the trial may be declared futile and recruitment will be stopped . 
The futility interim is non -binding on the Sponsor, and any deviation from the iDMC 
recommendation will be fully documented in the CSR.  If the study is stopped for futility, at 
that point the study results will be reported.  Full operating characteristics of the IA will be 
detailed in the SAP.
The interim analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_836215] (independent 
Data Coordinating Centre, iDCC) and reviewed by [CONTACT_836216](also unblinded), whilst the 
Sponsor will remain blinded until the end of study .  Interactions between the iDMC /iDCC and 
Sponsor will be carried out as specified in the iDMC Charter. 
The iDMC Charter will be updated to document this pre -planned interim analysis and
potential recommendations the iDMC can make to the Sponsor as a result of the analysis (e.g., 
stop the study for futility or continue the study ), and the iDMC Charter will also be made 
available to relevant health authorities.

1.[ADDRESS_1161053] after an incubation 
period of 1 to 4 days, characterized by [CONTACT_307163], cough, fatigue, 
headache, and myalgia.  Annual influenza epi[INVESTIGATOR_307145] 
3and 5 million cases of severe illness, and between 250,000 and 500,000 deaths every 
year around the wor ld (W HO 2017).
Although the condition is usually self -limiting in healthy adults , it can be associated with 
substantial morbidity and occasional mortality in children, the elderly, and the 
immunocompromised (Paules and Subbarao 2017).  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836161] (4% 8%), intensive care unit (ICU) admission 
(5%17%), and prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836162] 5 and 9 days.  During a pandemic 
season, the outcomes may be more serious, with up to 34% of patients requiring ICU 
care and a mortality rate as high as 15% (Lee and Ison 2012).
The influ enza viruses have a segmented, negative -sense, single- stranded, 
lipid-encapsulated RNA genome; they range between 80 and 100 nm in size.  Subtypes 
are defined according to glycoproteins present in the viral lipid coat.  The hemagglutinin 
complex (HA) is th e major surface protein of the virus.  The neuraminidase (NA) proteins 
are the second major surface proteins in the virion and play a role in enhancing virus 
penetration of the mucus layer around the target cell and in release of virus from the cell 
surfac e.  The matrix -2 (M2) protein triggers the disintegration of the virion during virus 
entry into the cell and may also be involved in protecting the HA prior to assembly of 
new virus particles.
The following anti -influenza virus drugs are currently availabl efor treatment of acute, 
uncomplicated influenza in different countries:  the M2 ion channel inhibit ors amantadine 
and rimantadine, the RNA polymerase inhibitor favipi[INVESTIGATOR_836024] r, and the NA inhibitors 
(i.e., oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir ).  Many cases of seasonal influenza infection 
are resistant to amantadine and rimantadine, hence their use in clinical practice is limited.  
NA inhibitor (NAI) oral formulations need to be administered for 5 days, potentially 
resulting in poor patient com pliance and convenience, while inhalation formulations can 
only be used in patients who are able to inhale the drug.  These factors cont ribute to an 
unmet medical need for new antiviral influenza drugs that can be easily and less 
frequently administered, particularly in patients who are severely ill and possibl y
intubated.
In February 2019, intravenous zanamivir (Dectova) received a positive opi[INVESTIGATOR_836163] -threatening influenza A or B virus 
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
23/Protocol CP40617 , Version 2infection sin adult and pediatric patients (aged 6 months).  Zanamivir is only 
indicated when the influenza virus is resistant to other antiviral drugs, or when other 
antiviral drugs are not suitable, and, therefore , have limited scope in treating influenza 
in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643].  Currently, there are no other licensed drugs specifically 
approved for the treatment of influenza in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831] , NAIs are 
widely used as the mainstay of treat ment for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643] , and evidence show s
a potential reduction in mortality in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836164], especially if 
initiated as early as possible (Muthuri et al. 2014
).
Influenza viruses are known to mutate during the course of replication and can mutate 
into a strain resistant to existing antiviral influenza drugs or a strain to which most people 
are not immune.  Certain strains of avian influenza have been found to be highly 
pathogenic with high rates of NAI-resistance ( Hu et al. 2013). New antiviral influenza 
treatments with novel mechanisms of action may provide alternative therapy options , 
particularly when used in combination wit h NAIs, to overcome such highly pathogenic 
organisms .
1.[ADDRESS_1161054] influenza.  
Baloxavir marboxil (also referred to as S -033188) is a pro -drug, which is converted to an 
active form baloxavir (also referred to BALOXAVIR ) through a meta bolic process called 
hydrolysis, in the blood, liver, and small intestine.
Baloxavir marboxil acts on cap- dependent endonuclease, an enzyme specific to 
influenza viruses, and inhibits viral cap -snatching, thereby [CONTACT_836217].
To date, one Phase II study in otherwise healthy adults and two Phase III stud iesin 
adults and adolescents (i.e., one in otherwise healthy patients and one in patients wit h 
high risk of influenza -related complications) have been completed and are s ummarized 
below. Currently, t he clinical development plan is designed to investigate additional
indications for post -exposure prophylaxis, the reduction of influenza transmission, and
otherwise healthy pediatrics ( 12 years of age). The studies for these additional
indications are not discussed in this protocol.
Baloxavir marboxil is approved for use in Japan (since February 2018) for the treatment 
of influenza A or B virus infection in all age groups ( 10 kg) and in the U nited States
(since October 2018), Hong Kong (since February 2019), and Thailand (since March 
2019) .  It is approved for the treatment of influenza in otherwise healthy patients aged 
12years and above who have been symptomatic for no more than [ADDRESS_1161055] been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours 
and are at high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_201663] -related complications. Regulatory filings

authorization for the use of baloxavir marboxil for the treatment of influenza.
Detailed profiles of baloxavir marboxil and its active form, baloxavir, derived from 
nonclinical and cli nical studies are provided in the Baloxavir Marboxil Investigator’s 
Brochure.  
1.2.1 Phase II Proof -of-Concept and Dose -Finding Study 
(Study 1518T0821)
In this Phase II ,double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled study, the efficacy and 
safety of baloxavir ma rboxil in otherwise healthy Japanese patients with influenza virus
infection was investigated.  A single dose of 10, 20, or 40 mg baloxavir marboxil or 
placebo was administered to 400 patients with influenza virus infection (100 per dose 
group).
The median times to alleviation of influenza symptoms in the [ADDRESS_1161056], the prespecified
secondary analysis, all three dose groups of baloxavir marboxil showed a significantly 
greater reduction in the time to alleviation of symptoms compared with the placebo 
group (2 -sided p-values:  p0.0085 for the 10 -mg group, p0.0182 for the 20 -mg gr oup, 
and p0.0046 for the 40 -mg group).
Compared with the placebo group, a ll of the baloxavir marboxil groups showed a greater 
reduction in the proportion of patients with positive influenza virus titer, change from 
baseline in influenza virus titer, an d change in amount of influenza virus on Days 2and3 
using the stratified W ilcoxon test .
Baloxavir marboxil was well tolerated in the study.  No deaths , serious adverse events ,
or treatment -emergent adverse events leading to study withdrawal were reported in any 
of the groups.  Adverse events were reported in 27 of 100 patients ( 27%, 34 events) in 
the 10 -mg group, 23 of 100 patients ( 23%, 29 events) in the 20- mg group, and 26 of 
100patients ( 26%, 29 events) in the 40- mg group compared with 29 of 100 patie nts 
(29%, 40 events) in the placebo group. No dose -dependent adverse events were 
observed. Most adverse events were of mild intensity and resolved .No severe 
treatment -emergent adverse events were reported in the study.
1.2.2 Phase III Double -Blind Study  in Otherwise Healthy Patients 
(Study 1601T0831 ,CAPSTONE 1)
In this Phase III, double -blind, double -randomized, placebo -and active 
(oseltamivir)controlled study, the efficacy and safety of baloxavir marboxil- was 
investigated in otherwise healthy Japanese and US adults and adolescents 
12to64years of age with influenza.  The doses studied were a single dose of 40 mg for 
patients weighing 40 to 80kg and a single dose of 80 mg for patients weighing 80 kg.  
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
25/Protocol CP40617 , Version 2Patients randomized to the active -control arm received 75 mg oseltamivir, twice daily 
(BID) for 5 days.  A total of 1432 patients received the study drug:  610 in the baloxavir 
marboxil group, 309 in the placebo group, and 513 in the oseltamivir group.
Thebaloxavir marboxil group showed a significantly greater reduction in the time to 
alleviation of symptoms (TTAS) compared with the placebo group (median difference 
26.5 hours [95% CI: - 35.8, -17.8]; p0.0001).  In the adult stratum of patients, the 
median TTAS was 53.5 hours in the baloxavir marboxil group compared with 53.8 hours 
in the oseltamivir group.  Of the secondary endpoints, significant decreases in both virus 
titer and the amount of virus RNA were observed in the baloxavir marboxil group 
comp ared with the placebo group.  
In addition, the median time to cessation of viral shedding, as determined by [CONTACT_836213], 
was significantly shorter (p 0.0001) in the baloxavir marboxil group (24 hours) than in 
the placebo group (96 hours) and in the oseltamivir group (72 hours).
Beneficial effects of baloxavir marboxil on fever were also demonstrated.  The proportion 
of patients who had fever was reduced more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_836165].  The median time to 
resolution of fever was shortened by 17.5 hours in the baloxavir marboxil group 
compared with the placebo group (p 0.0001).
Baloxavir marboxil was well tolerated in this study.  No deaths were reported in any 
group.  Two serious adverse events (i.e., aseptic meningitis and incarcerated inguinal 
hernia) were reported in 2 of 610 patients (0.3%) in the baloxavir marboxil group.  Both 
serious adverse events resolved and were considered not related to study drug by [CONTACT_836218].  Adverse events were reported in 126 of 610 patients (20.7%, 172 events) 
in the baloxavir marboxil group, 76 of 309 patients (24.6%, 118 events) in the placebo 
group, and 127 of 513 patients (24.8%, 179 events) in the oseltamivir group . 
The relatively common adverse events (incidence2% or greater) in any of the groups 
were bronchitis, sinusitis, diarrhea, and nausea; however, the incidence of each adverse 
event in the baloxavir marboxil group was lower than or equal to that in the placebo 
group.  In all groups, the majority of the adverse events were categorized as 
Grade 1or2 and resolved.
1.2.3 Phase III Double -Blind Study in Patients at High Risk of 
Developi[INVESTIGATOR_836149] -Related Complications 
(Study 1602 T0832, CAPSTONE II) 
In this global ,Phase III, double -blind, randomized placebo -, and active 
(oseltamivir )-controlled study, the efficacy and safety of baloxavir marboxil was 
investigated in adults and adolescents at high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_201663] -related 
complications. The patients had to have at least one high -risk factor for developi[INVESTIGATOR_836166] -related complications (adapted from the Centers for Disease Control and 
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
26/Protocol CP40617 , Version 2Prevention’s [CDC] criteria) . The doses studied were a single dose of 40 mg for 
patients weighing 40 to 80kg and a si ngle dose of 80 mg for patients weighing 
80kg. Patients randomized to the active -control arm received 75 mg oseltamivir, 
BID for 5 days.  A total of 2178 patients received the study drug: 730 in the baloxavir 
marboxil group, 727 in the placebo group, and 721 in the oseltamivir group.
The primary endpoint was the time to improvement of influenza symptoms (TTIS) in 
patients with influenza. Since high -risk individuals may have underlying chronic 
diseases that share some symptoms with those of influenza (e.g., cough in a patient with 
chronic lung disease), a modification of the TTAS was used to permit assessment of 
improvement of a symptom that may have been present before the onset of influenza but 
worsened by [CONTACT_14302], or maintenan ce of a preexisting symptom that had not been 
worsened by [CONTACT_836219]. 
The study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a clinically meaningful and 
statistically significant reduction in TTIS in the baloxavir marboxil group compared 
with the placebo group (median difference 29.1 [95% CI: 42.8, 14.6] hours, 
p0.0001). The difference in TTIS between the baloxavir marboxil group and the 
oseltamivir group was not statistically significant (median difference 7.7[95% CI: 
22.7, 7.9] hours, p 0.8347) .
The results for the secondary clinical efficacy and virologic endpoints were supportive 
of the results for the primary endpoint .There were clinically meaningful reductions in 
TTAS and time to resolution of fever in the baloxavir marboxil group compared to the 
placebo group, and no notable differences in the secondary clinical efficacy endpoints 
between the baloxavir marboxil and oseltamivir groups. The median time to cessation 
of viral shedding, as determined by [CONTACT_836213], show ed a clear reduction in the 
baloxavir marboxil group compared with the placebo group (median difference of 
48.0 hours, p 0.0001) and also when compared to the oseltamivir group (median 
difference of 48.0 hours, p 0.0001).
Baloxavir marboxil was well tolerated in patients at high risk of influenza -related 
complications.  Two deaths were reported in the study, one in the oseltamivir group due 
to a SAE of pneumonia unrelated to study treatment (0.1%) and one in the baloxavir 
marboxil group due to acute m yocardial infarction that developed on Day 1 prior to 
receiving study treatment (0.1%). SAEs (0.7% to 1.2%) and AEs leading to 
withdrawal from treatment (0.6% to 0.7%) were reported by [CONTACT_836220]. All SAEs in the baloxavir marboxil group were considered to be 
unrelated to treatment. Approximately 25% of patients experienced at least one AE in 
the baloxavir marboxil group compared with 30% and 28% of patients in the placebo 
and oseltamivir groups, respectively.  The relatively common AEs (incidence 2% or 
greater) in any of the groups were bronchitis, sinusitis, diarrhea, and nausea; however, 
the incidence of each AE in the baloxavir marboxil group was lower than or equal to 
that in the placebo and oseltamivir groups .

1.3 STUDY RA TIONA LE A ND BENEFIT –RISK A SSESSMENT
Influenza virus infection can lead to severe outcomes in patients with underlying medical 
comorbidities or inother vulnerable groups at risk of complications. For example, 
influenza predisposes individuals to secondary bacterial infection, which may progress in 
severity leading to poor prognosis (Rothberg and Haessler 2010) .  Other serious 
complications can also develop, including cardiac and neurological complications. 
There are no approved drugs licensed for the treatment of patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836167]; h owever ,treatment guidelines endorse the use of NAIs, such as oseltamivir ,
in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_203725] ( Harper et al. 2009; CDC 2018). Baloxavir marboxil 
appears to have significant virological efficacy, offering the potential to treat influenza in 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836168] .
Preclinical studies of baloxavir marboxil used in combination with NAIs have shown 
synergistic effects on inhibition of viral replication ( Kitano et al . 2017). Baloxavir 
marboxil in combination with aNAI is expected to produce agreater reduction in viral 
load than either baloxavir marboxil or a NAI alone.   
The results of the clinical studies outlined above have demon strated clinical efficacy and 
safety of baloxavir marboxil in the treatment of influenza virus infections in otherwise 
healthy adult and adolescent patients , and in adult and adolescent patients at high risk 
of developi[INVESTIGATOR_201663] -related complications supporting a positive benefit -risk 
assessment in both populations.  With demonstrated clinical efficacy and well tolerated 
safety profile ,a placebo- controlled study in combination with a standard -of-care (SOC) 
NAIto assess the efficacy and safety of balo xavir marboxil inhospi[INVESTIGATOR_836169] .

30/Protocol CP40617 , Version 23. STUDY DESIGN
3.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY
This is a Phase III, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled , multicenter study to 
assess the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of baloxavir marboxil in combination 
with a SOC NAI(i.e.,oseltamivir, zanamivir ,or peramivir) , compared with a matching 
placebo in combination with aSOC NAIin approximately 366hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836171] (aged 12years) with influenza.
Patients will be randomized as soon as possible after screening (ideally within 
12hours) ,providing they are within 96hours of symptom onset and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]
(includes assessment in emergency centers pending admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_111494] ).  
Patients will be assigned in a 2:1ratio to receive baloxavir marboxil or matching placebo . 
Study treatment must be given in combination with a SOC NAI according to investigator 
preference (i.e.,oseltamivir, zanamivir ,or peramivir ).  Re -screening of patients who fail 
to meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be permitted only once, providing the 
time from symptom onset to randomization is still within 96 hours.
Baloxavir marboxil will be administered as a weight -based dose (40 mg for patients 
weighing 40to80 kg, 80 mg for patients weighing 80 kg) on Days 1 and 4, and also 
on Day 7 if clinical improvement has not occurred at Day 5 ,per protocol defined criteria
(see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).   Treatment with a SOC NAI(i.e.,oseltamivir, zanamivir ,or 
peramivir) should be administered in accordance with local clinical practice. To fully 
explore the utility of the combination with baloxavir marboxil, or matching placebo ,the 
dosing regimen of the SOC NAI should aim to ensure that anti-viral activity is maintained 
from Day 1 to Day 5. The SOC NAI treatment may be extended to Day 1 0 or beyond at 
the discretion of the investigator and in accordance with local clinical practice.   
The study consists of two periods: a 10-day treatment period and a 25-day follow -up 
period.   Therefore, the maximum study duration for each patient will be 35 days.
The study assessments to be conducted include the following :  physical examination, 
vital signs, assessment of consciousness ,presence or absence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413] ,
adverse events, concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], clinical laboratory tests, nasopharyn geal swabs , 
and the palatability and acceptability questionnaire .  Please seeAppendix 1for details 
concerning the timing of these assessments.  
This study will be conducted at approximately 250 global sites in both Northern and 
Southern hemispheres.
An external independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) will evaluate safety 
according to policies and procedures detailed in an iDMC Charter.

aAll patients will receive at least two doses of baloxavir marboxil or its matching placebo
(i.e., Days 1 and 4).  A third dose may also be administered on Day 7 if clinical improvement is 
not observed atDay 5according to protocol defined criteria (Section4.3.2.1 ).
bA SOC NAI should be administered to cover a minimum of treatm ent exposure from Day  [ADDRESS_1161059] visit (LPLV) occurs 
or the date at which the last data point required for statistical analysis or safety follow -up 
is received from the last patient, whichever occurs later.  The LPLV is expected to occur 
[ADDRESS_1161060] been demonstrated in 

Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
32/Protocol CP40617 , Version 2previous studies using baloxavir marboxil tablets (10 mg and 20 mg) dosed at [ADDRESS_1161061] a nasogastric tube in situ as 
well as to patients who are unable to swallow tablets for other reasons.  
Baloxavir marboxil will be administered as a 40 -mg dose in patients weighing 
40to80kg or a n80-mg dose in patients weig hing 80 kg.  Dosing of baloxavir 
marboxil will be given , onDay1 and Day 4 for all patients, with an additional dose on
Day 7 in the absence of clinical improvement when assessed onDay 5 . Specific criteria 
for extended dosing to Day 7 include ongoing mechanical ventilation, persistence of 
fever ,severely immunocompromised, pneumonia, or confirmed /suspected
influenza- related complication.
Seriously ill patients who are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836172] (Lee et al.2009) .  
Therefore , the repeat -dose regimen is to ensure that plasma baloxavir concentrations 
remain above a target -threshold concentration for a longer duration in severely ill 
patients owing to the greater potential of a protracted influenza illness. 
Administration of up to three doses of baloxavir marboxil separated by 3 days is 
planned (i.e., Days 1, 4, and 7).  T he dosing interval of 3 days approximates terminal 
disposition half -life (~70 hours) of baloxavir , thus higher drug exposure on Day [ADDRESS_1161062] dose is expected, under the assumption of linear pharmacokinetics.  
Model -based simulation indicates that the population -median accumulation in terms of 
maximum plasma concentration (C max) and minimum plasma concentration (C trough) prior
to next dose on Day 7 (third consecutive dose) wou ld be approximately 1.[ADDRESS_1161063] -case 
arithmetic mean Bayesian estimate of 126 ng/mL f or C maxin Phase III (Asian 80kg), 
the highest peak plasma concentration after a third consecutive dose (Day 7) is not 
expected to exceed the peak drug levels observed in Japanese patients receiving 80 mg 
in the Thorough QT (TQT) study.  Likewise, total drug exposure simulated on Day 7 area 
under the plasma concentration time curve for a dosing interval (AUC tau) is not expected 
to exceed area under the concentration time curve from Time 0 to infinity (AUC inf) of the 
TQT, regardless of dose.  However, for certain individual Asian patients receiving 80 mg, 
total drug exposure on Day 7 (AUC tau) may approach similar overall exposures as seen 
inthe TQT.
3.3.2 Rationale for Patient Population
The safety and efficacy of baloxavir marboxil has been investigated in otherwise healthy 
adult and adolescent populations , and in adult and adolescent patients at high risk of 
influenza -related complications. Baloxavir marboxil has been approved in several 
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
33/Protocol CP40617 , Version 2countries, including Japan and the [LOCATION_002] .  Given the significant unmet need in 
patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_265844], this study is designed to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of baloxavir marboxil in this population.
Baloxavir marboxil has been well tolerated in a dults and adolescents in previous studies, 
witha pharmacokinetic (PK) profile supportive of the inclusion of these age groups in 
this study. There are a number of pediatric studies in progress that are designed to
confirm the safety and pharmaco kinetics of baloxavir marboxil in otherwise healthy 
children with influenza aged 12 years .Depending on the outcome of these additional
pediatric studies and this current study in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643], younger hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836173] a future protocol.
Morbidity and mortality are particular lyhigh for elderly patients and 
immunocompromised patients admitted to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836174]. This study will ,
therefore ,include both of these groups , with no upper age limit or restriction on the 
degree of immunocompromise .  Patients with severe renal or severe liver impairment will 
be excluded based on the current unknown PKprofile and tolerability of repeated doses 
of baloxavir marboxil.
3.3.3 Rationale for Control Group
It isnotethical to withhold active treatment from patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14286] ,
given the potential severity and poor outcomes in this patient group. NAIs are 
well-established and well -characterized antiviral agents used as the SOC in many
patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836175] (Harper et al. 2009 ;Fiore et al. 2011).  All patients in 
this study will receive a SOC NAI treatment (i.e.,oseltamivir, zanamivir ,or peramivir) .  
Inaddition, patients will be randomized in a 2:1ratio to receive baloxavir marboxil or its 
matching placebo.  Therefore, at a minimum, all patients will be treated with aSOC NAI 
for influenza.  
3.3.4 Rationale for Endpoints
There is no validated clinical end- point for assessing improvement in patients 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836176].  Consequently, three measures of clinical improvement are 
used in this study:  “ time to clinical improvement” as the primary endpoint , “response
rates of the 6 -point ordinal scale” and “time to clinical response” as key secondary 
endpoints. The primary and both key secondary endpoints will be tested in a 
hierarchical chain to control the experiment -wise error rate (alpha). 
The primary endpoint for this study will be the time to clinical improvement (TTCI),
defined as time to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836177] W arning Score 2 (NE WS2) 
of [ADDRESS_1161064]. This endpoint will provide
objective evidence of improvement in a patient’s condition ,which is likely to be a 
reasonable surrogate to overall clinical status improvement. 
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
34/Protocol CP40617 , Version 2The original NE WS was created in the [LOCATION_008] by [CONTACT_836221] 2012 to standardize the process of recording, scoring ,and responding to 
changes in routinely measured physiological parameters in a cutely ill patients. The 
score has been widely implemented across the National Health Service in the United 
Kingdom , and in other healthcare settings across the world. NEW S2 is a similar but 
updated sco re (Royal College of Physicians 2017) to incorporate an additional oxygen 
scale for patients at risk of hypercapnic respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] (target oxygen saturation of 
88%92%, rather than the standard target of 96%).
Six physiological parameters are routinely recorded: 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]
Oxygen saturation
Systolic blood pressure
Pulse rate
Level of consciousness and new confusion (ACVPU: Aalert, C new confusion, 
Vresponsive to voice, P responsive to pain, U unconscious)
Temperature
In addition, a weighting score of 2 is added for pa tients requiring supplemental oxygen to 
maintain their prescribed oxygen saturation range.
NEW S2 was developed for patients aged 16 years; however, children aged 
1216years have very similar physiological parameter ranges asadults .In this study, 
NEW S2 is not being used as an early warning system to identify patients who may need 
escalating levels of care; rather ,it is being used to standardize vital sign collection which 
will facilitate setting severity levelsfor inclusion and demonstrat ingresponse to 
treatment.  Most pediatric early warning scores are complex and designed to detect 
critical illness in younger children. For the purposes of this study, a patient achieving a 
NEW S2 of 2 is likely to represent a meaningful degree of c linical improvement
(i.e.,clinically stable and potentially eligible for discharge). Importantly as well , the 
method of statistical analysis and the selection of a clinically meaningful diffe rence 
between treatment groups are possible for an endpoint of this design. 
The first key secondary endpoint will be the proportion of patients per category in the 
6-point ordinal scale at Day 7.The categories within this scale (see Section 4.5.16)
reflect the clinical status of patients during their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  The clinical status should 
be assessed to reflect the most accurate condition of the patient from a med ical 
perspective, to minimize the effects of administrative or non -medical factors ( e.g., the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836178]).   This endpoint has received considerable interest for use in 
this patient population . There is as yet no definition of a minimum clinically relev ant
difference between treatment groups ;however ,the 6 -point ordinal scale will be used in 
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
35/Protocol CP40617 , Version 2this study to investigate the change in clinical state of patients as thekey secondary 
endpoint.
The second of the two key secondary endpoints will be “time to clinical response” .  This 
endpoint is defined by [CONTACT_836222][INVESTIGATOR_836179].  Vital sign stabilizati on is based on achieving a set temperature, combined 
with achieving a set oxygen saturation, plus two out of three other parameters related 
to respi[INVESTIGATOR_82219], blood pressure or heart rate (see Section 6.5).  
This endpoint was defined in a previous intravenous zanamivir or oral oseltamivir 
clinical study, the largest randomized, double -blind clinical trial of any NAI in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836180] (Marty et al. 2017).  In the study by 
[CONTACT_836223]., the “time to clinical response” (primary endpoint) was not met, and 
numerical non -significant differences were noted and warrant further investigation.

influenza within the prior 7 days and all other inclusion criteria are met
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
36/Protocol CP40617 , Version 2The time interval between the onset of symptoms and randomization is within
96hours
The onset of symptoms is defined as the tim e when the patient experiences at 
least one new general symptom ( e.g., headache, feverishness or chills, muscle 
or joint pain, fatigue), respi[INVESTIGATOR_20321] ( e.g., cough, sore throat, nasal 
congestion), or fever.
A score of 4based on the NE WS2 (see Appendix 3)
Patients will require objective criteria of seriousness defined by [CONTACT_836224]: 
−Requires ventila tion or supplemental oxygen to support respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]  
−Has a complication related to influenza that requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
(e.g.,pneumonia, CNS involvement, myositis, rhabdomyolysis, acute 
exacerbation of chronic kidney disease, asthma or chronic obstruct ive 
pulmonary disease [COPD], severe dehydration, myocarditis, pericarditis, 
exacerbation of ischemic heart disease)
For women of childbearing potential:  Agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from 
heterosexual intercourse) :
Women must remain abstinent or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate 
of 1%per year during the treatment period and for [ADDRESS_1161066] be supplemented by 
a barrier method.
A woman is considered to be of c hildbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal, 
has not reached a postmenopausal state ( 12continuous months of 
amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause ), and has not 
undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus).
Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of 1%per year include 
bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit 
ovulation , hormone -releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine 
devices.
The reliabil ity of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the 
duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation 
methods) and withdrawal ar e not acceptable methods of contraception.

4.2 METHOD OF TREA TMENT ASSIGNMENT A ND BLIND ING 
Following completion of screening and after all patient elig ibility requirements are 
confirmed ,patients will undergo randomization in a 2:1 ratio stratified by [CONTACT_836225] 
(i.e., North America; Europe, Middle East, and Africa [EMEA ];and rest of world [ROW ]), 
NEW S2 score ( 7, 7; see Appendix 3), and time from symptom onset to study 
treatment ( 48 hours, 48 hours). 
All patients will receive either baloxavir marboxil or its matching placebo .  
Apermuted -block randomization method will be u sed to obtain an approximate 2:1 ratio 
between the active treatment arm and the placebo arm within each stratum . The 
placebo and active kits are filled and packaged to look identical.
All study site personnel and patients will be blinded to the baloxavir marboxil versus 
placebo treatment assignment throughout the study ; the SOC NAI will be open label .  
The Sponsor and its agents will also be blinded to the baloxavir marboxil assignment, 
with the exception of individuals who require access to patient treatment assignments to 
fulfill their responsibilities during a clinical trial. These roles include the unblinding group 
responsible, clinical supply chain managers, sample handling staff, operational assay 
group personnel , IxRS service provider, and iDMC members .
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
38/Protocol CP40617 , Version 2While PK samples must be collected from patients assigned to the comparator placebo 
arm, PK assay results for these patients are not needed for the safe conduct or proper 
interpretation of this study.  Laboratories responsible for perfor ming study drug PK 
assays will be unblinded to patients' treatment assignments in order to identify 
appropriate samples to be analyzed.  PK samples from patients assigned to the placebo 
arm will not be analyzed for study drug PK concentration except by [CONTACT_836226] (e.g., to 
evaluate a possible error in dosing).  
If unblinding is necessary for a medical emergency (e.g., in the case of a serious 
adverse event for which patient management might be affected by [CONTACT_123514]), the investigator will be able to break the treatment code by 
[CONTACT_123517].  The investigator is not required to conta ct the Medical Monitor prior 
to breakin g the treatment code; however, the treatment code should not be broken

[IP_ADDRESS] Baloxavir Marboxil and Matching Placebo (Study treatment) 
Baloxavir marboxil or matching placebo will be administered orally according to body 
weight (40 mg for patients weighing 40to80 kg ;80 mg for patients weighing 80kg) 
either in tablet form (20-mg tablets) or granules for oral suspension for patients unable to 
swallow or with a nasogastric tube in situ (e .g.,in intubated patients).  
Dosing will occur on Day [ADDRESS_1161072] 1 of the following specific criteria at Day 5 :
Ongoing mechanical ventilation
Persistent fever
Severely immunocompromised
Pneumonia
Confirmed /suspected influenza -related complication
[IP_ADDRESS] Standard -of-Care Neuraminidase Inhibitor
In general, choice of dose, regimen, and any period of extended dosing or dose 
alterations for the SOC NAI (i.e., oseltamivir, zanamivir, or peramivir) should be made in 
accordance with local clinical practice.  However, due to the design of the trial, wherever 
possible, treatment with the chosen SOC NAI should be sufficient to ensur e exposure of 
active drug such that anti -viral activity is maint ained from Day 1 through Day 5.Table 2
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
40/Protocol CP40617 , Version 2provides guidance on the choice of dose and regimen to achieve this goal.  If required, 
the investigator may choose to follow local practice instead of these guidelines.  Special 
attention is required for dosing in patients with renal impairment, as dose adjustment 
may be needed.
The above recommendation is regardless of whether the patient has already received 
antiviral treatment within 48 hours prior to screening (i.e.,a minimum of 5 days 
administration of the NAI beginning at Day 1 is recommended ).

Data
Medical history, including clinically significant diseases, surgeries, cancer history 
(including prior cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26649]), reproductive status, smoking history,
home oxygen use ,and use of alcohol and drugs of abuse will be recorded at the 
baseline visit.  In addition, all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter 
drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplemen ts) used by [CONTACT_178825] 7 days prior to initiation of study treatment will be recorded.  At the time of 
each follow -up physical examination, an interval medical history should be obtained and 
any changes in medications and allergies should be recorded.
Recorded d emographic data will include age, sex, and self -reported race/ethnicity.
Race/ethnicity data is to be obtained only if allowed by [CONTACT_836233]. Race/ethnicity data, where collected ,will be used as a variable within the 
PK analysis. In the Phase III study (1601T0831) ,a difference was observed in the 
baloxavir plasma concentration 24 hours postdose ( C24)measurement when assessed 
according to reported race ( see Baloxavir Marboxil Inve stigator’s Brochure for details ).
Influenza vaccination history for the 12 months before screening will be recorded, 
including the type of vaccine (e.g., live, inactivated) and date administered, if known.
4.5.3 Physical Examinations
A complete physical examination should be conducted at screening and include an 
evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat, and the cardiovascular, 
dermatologic , musculoskeletal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and 
neurologic systems.  Any abnormality identified at the baseline visitshould be recorded 
on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF.   
Limited, symptom -directed physical examinations should be performed at specified 
postbaseline visits and as clinically indicated.  Changes from baseline abnormalities 
should be recorded in pati ent notes.  New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities 
should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.
Limited, symptom -directed physical examinations may be performed by [CONTACT_836234].
4.5.4 Vital Signs
Vital signs will include measurements of respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], pulse rate, peripheral oxygen 
saturation, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and body temperature.  Body 
temperature should be measured using the same methodology throughout the study.  
For patients requiring supplemental oxygen, the oxygen flow rate (L/min) and/or fraction 
of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1401] (FiO 2) should be recorded.
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
44/Protocol CP40617 , Version 2All of the vital sign parameters should be recorded together four times per day for the 
duration of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836184] (Day 1/Visit 1 to Day 10 ).  
It is recommended that the collection timepoints for vital signs and assessments 
(specific to NEWS2, Section 4.5.4) are spread throughout the study day to reflect the 
patient’s condition over the entire study day, where possible.  Following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836185] (Day 1 to Day 10) these parameters should be 
recorded once at each return visit to the clinic.   Patients who remain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836186] -up period (Day 11+) require daily collection of vital signs for the purpose of the
study.  During the follow -up period in patients who have been discharged , vital sign 
measurements and temperature are to be recorded at the investigators’ discretion 
(e.g., if symptoms and signs persist during follow -up).  Vital sign measurements may be 
performed by [CONTACT_836230].
4.5.5 Assessments Specific to National Early  Warning Score 2
In addition to the vital measurements, the patient’s consciousness level and the presence 
or absenc e of respi[INVESTIGATOR_249131]. The NE WS2 parameter for respi[INVESTIGATOR_836187] “oxygen” can include other forms of 
ventilation to maintain oxygen saturation (see Appendix 3). 
These should be recorded at the same tim e points as the vital sign measurements (see 
Section 4.5.4 and Appendix 1).
4.5.6 National Early  Warning Score 2
The NE WS2 should be calc ulated by [CONTACT_836235] W arning Score 2 (see Section 4.5.5 ) 
recorded during the patient assessment.   Should these assessments be conducted more 
than once during the screening period (per site patient care) ,all data collected closest to 
but before ran domi zation should be used for the NEWS2 score calculation and 
assessment of patient eligibility .  See Appendix 3for calculation instructions.   
After screening, the NEW S2 values do not need to be calculated by [CONTACT_779], but will be 
calculated electronically by [CONTACT_836236] S2-related assessments recorded by [CONTACT_9916] t he appropriate eCRF.
4.5.7 Laboratory and Other Biological Samples
Samples for the following laboratory tests will be sent to local laboratories for analysis:

Plasma samples for PK analysis (see Appendix 2)
Serum antibody titers for influenza A and B viruses 
Nasopharyngeal swabs for influenza virology tests (i.e., RT-PCR, 50% tissue culture 
infectious dose [ TCID 50], phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_836188] , drug susceptibility test ing) and non -influenza respi[INVESTIGATOR_836189] (only at the s creening visit)
Blood and urine sample collection may be performed by [CONTACT_836230].   For 
samp ling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the laboratory 
manual.
These samples will be destroyed when the final Clinical Study Report has been 
completed, with the following exception:
Plasma samples collected for PKanalysis may be needed for additional PK assay 
development and validation; therefore, these samples will be destroyed no later than 
5years after the final Clinical Study Report has been completed.
When a patient withdraws from the study, samples collected prior to th e date of 
withdrawal may still be analyzed, unless the patient specifically requests that the 
samples be destroyed or local laws require destruction of the samples.   However, if 
samples have been tested prior to withdrawal , results from those tests will re main as 
part of the overall research data.
Data arising from sample analysis will be subject to the confidentiality standards 
described in Section 8.4.
4.5.8 Liver Function Monitoring
Patients should be assessed for liver function prior to each dose of baloxavir marboxil or 
matching placebo.  
On Day 1 and Day 4, the assessment is mandatory.  On Day 1, the local laboratory full 
blood chemistry panel required as part of screening can be used for this assessment or 
prior blood results if tests conducted within 24 hours prior to screening.  On Day 4, the 
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
46/Protocol CP40617 , Version 2protocol -required local laboratory blood liver chemistry panel should be used for this 
assessment. 
On Day 7, the local laboratory blood liver chemistry panel and associated review of 
liver chemistry is only required if the patient will receive baloxavir marboxil or 
matching placebo on this study day.
Results must be reviewed by [CONTACT_249170].  Dosing will 
occur only if the clinical assessment and local laboratory liver chemistry panel values are 
acceptable (see Appendix 4).
4.5.9 Electrocardiograms
Single ECG recordings will be obtained at sp ecified timepoints, as outlined in the 
schedule of activities (see Appendix 1) and may be obtained at unscheduled timepoints.  
All ECG recordings must be performed using a standard high- quality, high -fidelity digital 
electrocardiograph machine equipped with computer -based interval measurements.  
Lead placement should be as consistent as possible.  ECG recordings must be 
performed after th e patient has been resting in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 10 minutes.  
All ECGs are to be obtained prior to other procedures scheduled at that same time 
(e.g., vital sign measurements, blood draws) and ,if possible ,should not be obtained 
within 3 hours after any meal.  Circumstances that may induce changes in heart rate, 
including environmental distractions (e.g., television, radio, conversation) should be 
avoided during the pre- ECG resting period and during ECG recording.
For safety monitoring purposes , the investigator must review, sign, and date all ECG

associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from study drug
Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those 
that occur prior to assignment of st udy treatment (e.g., screening invasive 
procedures such as biopsies)
5.2.2 Serious A dverse Events (Immediately  Reportable to the 
Sponsor)
A serious adverse event is any adverse event that meets any of the following criteria:
Is fatal (i.e., the adverse event ac tually causes or leads to death)
Is life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient at immediate risk of death)
This does not include any adverse event that ,had it occurred in a more severe 
form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death.
Prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836193] -elective re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] )
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event results 
in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life functions)
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
study drug
Is a significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above)
The terms "severe "and "serious "are notsynonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event ( e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [ NCI C TCAE] ; see 
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
52/Protocol CP40617 , Version 2Section 5.3.3 ); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as 
severe headache without any furth er findings).
Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event 
recorded on the eCRF.
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by [CONTACT_25741] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learn ing of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for 
reporting instructions).
5.2.[ADDRESS_1161087] (Immediately  Reportable to 
the Sponsor)
Adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by [CONTACT_43073] t he 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see 
Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions).  Adverse events of special interest for this study 
are as follows :
Cases of potential drug- induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in 
combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by [CONTACT_25742]'s 
Law (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] )
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by [CONTACT_5257], as defined as 
follows:
Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non -pathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.  A transmission of an infectious agent may be 
suspected from clinical s ymptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an infection in 
a patient exposed to a medicinal product.  This term applies only when a 
contamination of the study drug is suspected.
5.[ADDRESS_1161088] igator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1 for 
definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in 
accordance with instructions provided in this section and in Section 5.4, Section 5.5, and
Section 5.6.  The investigator is also responsible for reporting any occurrence of 
accidental overdose or medication error (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).   
For each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will make 
an assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.2.2 for seriousness criteria), severity (see 
Section 5.3.3 ), and causali ty (see Section 5.3.4 ).  
5.3.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period
Investigators will seek information on adverse events at each patient contac t.  All 
adverse events, whether reported by [CONTACT_25743], will be 
recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF.
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
53/Protocol CP40617 , Version 2After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug , only 
serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention (e.g., invasive 
procedures such as biopsies, discontinuation of medications) should be reported 
(see Section 5.4.2 for instructions for reporting serious adverse events).
After initiation of study drug, all adverse events will be reported until 28 days after the 
final dose of study drug.
Instructions for reporting adverse events that occur after the adverse event reporting 
period are provided in Section 5.6.
5.3.2 Eliciting Adverse Event Information
A consistent methodology of non -directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting 
adverse event information at all patient evaluation timepoints.  Examples of non -directive 
questions include the following:
"How have you felt s ince your last clinic visit?"
"Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here? "
5.3.3 Assessment of Severity  of A dverse Events
The adverse event severity grading scale for the NCI CTCAE (v5.0) will be used for 
assessing adverse event severity.  Table 3 will be used for assessing severity for 
adverse events that are not specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE.

reporting instructions), per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2 .
5.3.4 Assessment of Causality  of Adverse Events
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether an 
adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating "yes" or "no" 
accordingly.  The following guidance should be taken into consideration :
Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug
Course of the event, with special consideration of the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study drug, or reintroduction of study drug (as applicable)
Known association of the event with the study drug or with similar treatments
Known association of the event with the disease under study
Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications known to 
increase the occurrence of the event
Presence of non -treatment -related factors that ar e known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
55/Protocol CP40617 , Version 2For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol -mandated therapy.
5.3.[ADDRESS_1161090] medi cal terminology/concepts when recording adverse 
events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Diagnosis versus Signs and Sy mptoms
Adiagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than 
individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than 
jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs 
and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome 
at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported adverse ev ents 
based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced by [CONTACT_40877], with a starting date that corresponds to the starting 
date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events That A reSecondary  to Other Events
In general, adverse events that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or 
clinical sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252], with the exception of 
severe or serious secondary events.  A medically signific ant secondary adverse event 
that is separated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent 
event on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example:
If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF.
If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF.
If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be 
reported separately on the eC RF.
If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF.
If neutropenia is accompanied by a ninfection, both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF.
All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is 
unclear as to whether the events are associated.
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
56/Protocol CP40617 , Version [IP_ADDRESS] Persistent or Recurrent A dverse Events
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, bet ween 
patient evaluation timepoints.  Such events should only be recorded once on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be 
recorded at the time the event is first reported.  If a persistent adverse event become s 
more severe, the most extreme severity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  If the event becomes serious, it should be reported to the Sponsor immediately 
(i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; see 
Secti on5.4.2 for reporting instructions).  The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated 
by[CONTACT_25748] "non -serious" to "serious," providing the date that the event 
became serious, and completing all data fields related to serious adverse events.
A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs.  Each recurrence of an advers e event should be recorded as a 
separate event on the Adverse Event eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory Values
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A laboratory test result 
must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:
Is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]
Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)
Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy
Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings.  Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as an adverse event.
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., ALP and bilirubin 5 ULN associated with cholestasis), only the diagnosis 
(i.e., cholestasis) shoul d be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a 
descriptor indicating whether the test result is above or below the normal range 
(e.g., "elevated potassium, "as opposed to "abnormal potassium ").  If the laboratory 
abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the 
clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event.  For example, an elevated serum 
potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as "hyperkalemia. "
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
57/Protocol CP40617 , Version 2Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adve rse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Vital Sign Values
Not every vital s ign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must
be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:
Is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]
Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treat ment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)
Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy
Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality 
should be classified as an adverse event.
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pre ssure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on 
the Adverse Event eCRF.
Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abno
rmality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Liver Function Tests
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( 3ULN) in combination with either an elevated 
total bilirubin ( 2ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other 
causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury (as 
defined by [CONTACT_25742]'s Law ).  Therefore, i nvestigators must report as an adverse event the 
occurrence of either of the following:
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in combination with total bilirubin 
2ULN
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in combination with clinical jaundice
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of 
the event) either as a serious adverse event or a nadverse event of special interest (see 
Section 5.4.2 ).
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
58/Protocol CP40617 , Version 2In addition, liver function abnormalities meeting any of the following criteria need to be 
managed according to Appendix 4:
AST or ALT 5ULN
AST or ALT 3ULN and total bilirubin 2ULN or INR 1.5, if INR is measured
AST or ALT 3ULN with signs and symptoms compatible with hepatitis or 
hypersensitivity
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified adverse event reporting period (see 
Section 5.3.1 ), regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2 ).  This 
includes death attributed to progression of influenza .  
Death sh ould be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condition 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical 
concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be 
reported. If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of 
reporting, "unexplained death "should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the 
cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), "unexplained death "should 
be repl aced by [CONTACT_25749].   The term "sudden death" should not be 
used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g., "sudden cardiac death").
If the death is attributed to progression of influenza, "influenza progression "should be 
recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
Deaths that occur after the adverse event reporting period should be reported as 
described in Section 5.6.
[IP_ADDRESS] Preexisting Medical Conditions
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study.  
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline 
Conditions eCRF.
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the 
frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  W hen 
recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept 
that the preexi sting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] 
(e.g., "more frequent headaches ").
[IP_ADDRESS] Lack of Efficacy  or Worsening of Influenza
Medical occurrences or symptoms of deterioration that are anticipated as part of 
influenza, such as fluctuations in symptoms, should only be recorded as an adverse 
event if judged by [CONTACT_836238].  When recording an 
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
59/Protocol CP40617 , Version 2unanticipated worsening of influenza on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to 
convey the concept that the condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] 
(e.g., "accelerated worsening of influenza ").
[IP_ADDRESS] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836194] (i.e., in- patient 
admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ( i.e., after the current study 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) should be documented and reported as a serious adverse event (per the 
definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2 ), except as outlined below.
An event that leads to the prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836195] a serious adverse event:
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25678]
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre existing condition, provided that all of the following criteria 
are met:
–The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33403] .
The patient has not experienced an adverse event .
An event that leads to the prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836196] a serious adverse event, but should be reported 
as an adverse event instead:
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836197] c operating hours
Adverse event s that would otherw ise not require hospit alization
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Requirements for Cases of A ccidental Overdose or 
Medication Error
Accidental overdose and medication error (hereafter collectively referred to as "special 
situatio ns"), are defined as follows:
Accidental overdose:  accidental administration of a drug in a quantity that is higher 
than the assigned dose
Medication error:  accidental deviation in the administration of a drug 
In some cases, a medication error may be in tercepted prior to administration of 
the drug.
Special situations are not in themselves adverse events but may result in adverse 
events.  Each adverse event associated with a special situation should be recorded 
separately on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If th e associated adverse event fulfills 
seriousness criteria, the event should be reported to the Sponsor immediately 
(i.e., nomore than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ).  For baloxavir 
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
60/Protocol CP40617 , Version 2marboxil and matching placebo , adverse events associated with special situations 
should be recorded as described below for each situation:
Accidental overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  Check the "Accidental 
overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.
Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  
Check the "Medication error" box.
Medication error that qualifies as an overdose:  Ent er the adverse event term.  Check 
the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.
In addition, all special situations associated with baloxavir marboxil and matching 
placebo , regardless of whether they result in an adverse event, should be recorde d on
the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., nomore than 
24hours after learning of the event).  Special situations should be recorded as described 
below:
Accidental overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  Check the "Accide ntal 
overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.
Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the name [CONTACT_26865] a description of the error (e.g., wrong dose administered, wrong 
dosing schedule, incorrect route of administra tion, wrong drug, expi[INVESTIGATOR_26669]) as the event term.  Check the "Medication error" box.
Medication error that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "accidental 
overdose" as the event term.  Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication 
error" boxes.  Enter a description of the error in the additional case details.
Intercepted medication error:  Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "intercepted medication 
error" as the event term.  Check the "Medication error" box.  Enter a description of 
the er ror in the additional case details.
As an example, an accidental overdose that resulted in a headache would require the 
completion of two Adverse Event eCRF pages, one to report the accidental overdose 
and one to report the headache.  The "Accidental over dose" and "Medication error" 
boxes would need to be checked on both eCRF pages.
5.[ADDRESS_1161091] report

[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancies in Female Patients
Female patients of childbearing potential will be instructed to immediately inform the 
investigator if they become pregnant during the study or within [ADDRESS_1161097] 
dose of study drug.  A paper Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form should be 
completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 
24hours after learning of the pregnancy), either by [CONTACT_123565].  Pregnancy
should not be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  The investigator should 
discontinue study drug and counsel the patient, discussing the risks of the pregnancy 
and the possible effects on the fetus.  Monitoring of the patient should continue until 
conclusion of the pregnancy.  Any serious adverse events associated with the 
pregnancy (e.g., an event in the fetus, an event in the mother during or after the 
pregnancy, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the child) should be reported on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  In addition, the investigator will submit a Clinical Trial Pregnancy 
Reporting Form when updated information on the course and outcome of the pregnancy 
becomes available.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancies in Female Partners of Male Patients
Male patients will be instr ucted through the Informed Consent Form to immediately 
inform the investigator if their partner becomes pregnant during the study or within 
28days after the final dose of study drug.  A paper Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting 
Form should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately

and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of 
the event; see Section 5.4.2 ).  
If a therapeutic or elective abortion was performed because of an underlying maternal 
or embryofetal toxicity, the toxicity should be classified as a SAE , recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 
24hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2).   A therapeutic or elective 
abortion performed for reasons other than an underlying maternal or embryofetal 
toxicity is not considered an adverse event.
All abortions should be reported as pregnancy outcomes on the paper Clinical Trial 
Pregnancy Reporting Fo rm.
[IP_ADDRESS] Congenital A nomalies /Birth Defects
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female patient exposed to study

65/Protocol CP40617 , Version 26. STATISTICA L CONSIDERA TIONS AND ANAL YSIS PLA N
Efficacy analyses will be conducted for the modified intent -to-treat infected ( mITTI) 
population.  This is defined as all patients randomized who received at least one dose of 
study drug and were centrally assessed asRT-PCR positive for influenza at any 
timepoint , with patients grouped according to the treatment assigned at randomization .
Safety analyses will be conducted for the safety population.  This is defined as all 
patients who received at least one dose of study drug, with patients grouped according 
to the treatment received.
The analysis will occur at the end of the study (as defined in Section 3.2).
Detailed specifications of the statistical methods will be described in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP).
The global populat ion will include all patients enrolled during the global enrollment phase
(If patients from China are enrolled, aChina subpopulation will include all patients 
enrolled at National Medical Products Administration [NMPA] -recognized sites ).  
Separate analyses may be performed for the global population and the China 
subpopulation (see Section 6.8for information on the Chi na subpopulation analyses).
6.1 DETERMINA TION OF SA MPLE SIZE
Two new factors influenced the revised sample size :  1) the revised assumption for the 
placebo plus NAI control -arm TTCI following blinded data review (Section 6.1.1) and 
2)the faster than anticipated enrollment rate.  Integration of these two factors informed 
a sample size readjustment to approximately 366 randomized patients.  As suming that 
the RT -PCR positive rate (tested in a central laboratory) will be 75% of the randomized 
population and a dropout rate of 4%, the modified intent -to-treat (influenza) infected 
(mITTI) population will be 264 patients (i.e., 176 patients in the baloxavir marboxil 
group and 88 in the placebo group).  The total number of randomized patients may 
change based on the percentage of patients who are RT -PCR positive during the study.
The total mITTIsample size of [ADDRESS_1161103] 80% power using the 
Logrank Chi -Square test to detect a 31 -hour difference in TTC Ibetween treatment 
groups under the following assumptions: median TTCIin the placebo plus NAI group is 
94hours, 840 hours follow -up (35 days ) using 5% alpha .  The minimal detectable 
difference is expected to be around 23hours.  The alteration of  the TTCI in the placebo 
plus NAI group to 94 hours was selected after consideration of the response rates 
observed in a blinded review (see Section 6.1.1) of TTCI including data from 
127 patients. 
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
66/Protocol CP40617 , Version 2The increased sample size has the consequential benefit of a larger population for safety 
analysis of the combination and multiple dose regimen specifically tested in this study 
for the severely ill hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836160].
The study power is calculated based on the primary endpoint incorporating a group 
sequential design (GSD) using a beta spending function with non -binding rule, to 
allow for one futility interim, without increasing the overall experiment -wise error rate.
6.1.1 Blinded Sample Size Re -Assessme nt
The TTCI of 84 hours for the placebo plus NAI arm was selected in the initial study 
design ( i.e., protocol version 1) after consideration of response rates observed in prior 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836198] (Marty et al . 201 7; 
deJong et al.2014).
After the first northern hemisphere flu season recruitment, a blinded evaluation of the 
protocol defined TTCI for all available data was conducted to improve the accuracy of 
assumptions of the length of TTCI in the placebo plus NAI group. The pooled media n 
TTCI of this blinded review (94 hours) was selected as the revised assumption for the 
placebo plus NAI group, which resulted in the adjustment of the study sample size 
(Section 6.1).
Given the blinded nature of the evaluation, this has no impact on the overall alpha for 
the study.

influenza at any timepoint .
In addition to the analyses described in Section 6.4.1 and Section 6.4.2 , the following
analyses will be performed for the primary efficacy end point and the key secondary 
efficacy endpoint s,as appropriate . Details of these analyses will be described in the 
SAP:
Sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of results to the primary analysis
methods (e.g., handling of dropouts)
Descriptive subgroup analyses to evaluate the consistency of results across 
prespecified subgroups (e.g., based on age, sex, race/ethnicity, stratification factors , 
and patients taking anti -influenza drugs prior to enrollment )
Hypothesis tests will be two -sided at the 5% significance level , unless stated otherwise.
To manage the overall type I error, the endpoints will be tested sequentially. The order 
of testing will be as follows :
TTCI
Response rates of t he 6-point ordinal sc ale at Day 7
Time to Clinical Response
If the primary efficacy analysis hypothesis test result is not statistically significant
(i.e. p0.05), the hypothesis below that result in the hierarchical chain will be 
considered exploratory and no claims of statistical significance will be made. The same 
rules apply to the next endpoint in the chain.
6.4.1 Primary  Efficacy  Endpoint
The primary efficacy objec tive for this study is to evaluate the efficacy of baloxavir 
marboxil plus a SOC NAI, compared with matching placebo plus SOC NAI on the basis 
of the following endpoint:
TTCI (defined as time to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_836199] S2 of [ADDRESS_1161106])
The median TTCI will be compared between the baloxavir marboxil plus SOC NAI and 
matching placebo plus SOC NAI arms us ingthe stratified log -rank test within three
regions ( i.e., North America, EMEA, ROW ), NEW S2 (7, 7),and time from symptom 
onset to study treatment ( 48 hours, 48 hours) included as the stratification factors.  
The Kaplan- Meier plot, median time to response ,95% CI s, and p -value swill be 
presented
.
The log- rank test requires the assumption of pro portional hazards to be met.  The 
proportional hazards assumption will be tested graphically using the log cumulative 
hazard plot by [CONTACT_1570].  The plots for each treatment group will be parallel if the 
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
68/Protocol CP40617 , Version 2proportional hazard assumption holds. Using a Cox model ,the slope of a linear 
regression will also be tested and a plot of scaled Schoenfeld residuals against the 
Kaplan -Meier estimator investigated.
Should the proportional hazards assumption be violated ,the Gehan -Wilcoxon test will be 
used to analyze the data as the logrank test can be under powered in this situation. 
Allinvestigations will be detailed in the statistical section of the CSR.  
The estimand is the median change in TTCI .  This absolute measure will be assessed 
over the duration of t he study (35 days).  Intercurrent events are those that occur after 
treatment initiation and either preclude observation of the variable or affect its 
interpretation.  Intercurrent events will be account ed for through censoring rules.  
Patients who are los t to follow -up, who do not have a clinical response event ,who die or 
discontinue for any reason prior to achieving a clinical response event will be censored 
at their last contact [CONTACT_836214], whichever is applicable. No dose reductions 
or treatment cross -overs are anticipated.   
As specified in Section 6.4, the primary efficacy analysis population will be the 
modified- ITTI population, which consists of all patients who were randomized to 
treatment, received a dose of study drug, and were RT -PCR positive for influenza at any 
timepoint .
A sensitivity analysis will be conducted where patients who are lost to follow -up or who
do not have a clinical response event will be assumed to have had an event at 28 days.   
A sensitivity analysis for patients who discontinue for any reason prior to achieving a 
clinical response event will be performed to investigate potential confounding factors .
Asensitivity analysis, considering death as a competitive event, using a competing risk 
model will be conducted if there are a sufficient number of deaths or an imbalance 
between groups in deaths and reason attributed.  These and any further sen sitivity 
analyses will be fully detailed in the SAP.
Missing data handling rules for the components of the NE WS2 score will be specified in 
the SAP.

73/Protocol CP40617 , Version 26.[ADDRESS_1161110].  Excluded patients will be documented, 
together with the reason for exclusion.
For all patients, individual baloxavir concentration data will be listed by [CONTACT_836243].  Plasma levels of bal oxavir will be summarized (i.e., mean, standard 
deviation, coefficient of variation, median, minimum, and maximum) by [CONTACT_836244].  Individual and mean plasma baloxavir concentrations versus time 
data will be plotted ( i.e., a separate figure panel for each of the three doses).  In addition, 
for patients who provided sparse PK data, the distribution of plasma baloxavir 
concentrations will also be presented by [CONTACT_3553] a boxplot ( i.e., a separate figure for 
each dose, X -axis category time postdose).
Non-compartmental PK parameters (e.g., AUC, time to maximum concentration, C max, 
half-life) will only be derived for patients who underwent the non -sparse (sequential) PK 
sampling regimen ( Appendix 2) and who provided sufficient data to allow estimation of 
such parameters.   The following non -compartmental PK parameters will be derived for 
each individual after the first and second dos e:  AUC 0-72h, C max, C 24, and terminal 
half-life (as appropriate for data collected).  AUC infand clearance at steady state will be 
reported after the first dose ,only.  Drug accumulation will be assessed based on the 
AUC0 -72h ratio between the second and first baloxavir marboxil dose.  Estimates for 
these parameters will be tabulated and summarized (i.e., mean, standard deviation, 
coefficient of variation, median, minimum, and maximum).  Inter -patient variability 
will be evaluated based on the summary statistics of the individual PK parameter 
estimates .
All tables, listings, and figures derived from PK data (concentrations or parameters) 
obtained from patients who underwent the sequential PK sampling ( Appendix 2) will be 
presented separately ( i.e., not pooled with data from patients who underwent sparse PK
sampling ).
Non-linear mixed effect modelling will be used to characterize the population 
pharmacokinetics of baloxavir in the target population.  The population typi[INVESTIGATOR_836201] (e.g., apparent clearance [CL/F], apparent volume of distribution for 
the central compartment [Vc/F] ),and their covariates will be estimated.  Individual PK 
parameters may also calculated using post hoc Bayesian estimation for each patient, 
and plotted against significant covariates identified (e.g .,body weight, age). The derived 
PK parameters will be tabulated and summarized (i.e., by [CONTACT_8477], standard deviation, 
coefficient of variation, median, and minimum and maximum). PK exposure and 
Baloxavir Marboxil —F. Hoffmann- La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
74/Protocol CP40617 , Version 2response (e.g., virus titers) relationships will be explored.   The population PK mo del 
outcomes will be reported in a stand -alone report outside of the clinical report.
Additional PK analyses will be conducted as appropriate.
6.7 INTERIM A NALYSIS
6.7.1 Planned Interim A nalysis
After approximately 65% of TTCI events, a formal unblinded non-binding futility 
interim analysis based on the TTCI will be performed.  The futility interim analysis 
will use a Lan -DeMets Pocock beta spending function.  If the hazard ratio seen at the 
interim is below the calculated futility bound , the trial may be declared futile and 
recruitment will be stopped . 
The futility interim is non- binding on the Sponsor, and any deviation from the iDMC 
recommendation will be fully documented in the CSR.  If the study is stopped for 
futility, at that point the study resul ts will be reported.  Full operating characteristics 
of the interim analysis will be detailed in the SAP.
The interim analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_836215] 
(independent Data Coordinating Centre [iDCC]) and reviewed by [CONTACT_836216](also 
unblinded), whilst the Sponsor will remain blinded until the end of study.   Interactions 
between the iDMC /iDCC and Sponsor will be carried out as specified in the iDMC 
Charter. 
The iDMC Charter will be updated to document this pre -planned interim analysis and
potential recommendations the iDMC can make to the Sponsor as a result of the 
analysis (e.g., stop the study for futility or continue the study), and the iDMC Charter will 
also be made available to relevant health authorities.

At screening, the NE WS2 should be calculated based upon vital sign values recorded 
during the patient assessment. Should these vital signs assessments be recorded more 
than once duri ng the screening period (per site patient care) all data collected closest to 
but before randomization should be used for the NEWS2 score calculation and 
assessment of patient eligibility .
The oxygen saturation should be scored according to either the SpO 2Scale 1 or 2
presented in the table above . The SpO 2Scale 2 is for patients with a target oxygen 
saturation requirement of 88 %92% (e .
g.,in patients with hypercapnic respi[INVESTIGATOR_249149] ,such as chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease [COPD] ). This should only be used in patients confirmed to have hypercapnic 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_95244] a prior or their current hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15517].
The decision to use the SpO 2Scale 2 should be made by [CONTACT_836249]. In all other circumstances, the SpO 2Scale 1 should be 
used.

Liver Injury: Premarketing Clinical Evaluation, FDA: 2009 ; available from: 
https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Guidances/UCM174090.pdf ).
Abnormal Liver Chemistry  Criteria
The investigator or subinvestigator must review study patient laboratories to identify if
any levels meet the following criteria:
AST or ALT 5upper limit of normal (ULN)
AST or ALT 3ULN and total bilirubin (TBL) 2ULN or INR1.5, if INR is

AST or ALT 3ULN with signs or symptoms compatible with hepatitis or 
hypersensitivity (e.g., fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or 
tenderness, jaundice, fever, rash, eosinophilia [ 5%])
Action to be Taken by [CONTACT_836251], the investigator or subinvestigator must
do the following:
Patients must be instructed to discontinue study medication immediately.
Following the initial observed elevation, every effort should be made to have the
patient return to the clinic within 72 hours (if already discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) to 
repeat liver function chemistries and for further hepatic evaluation.
Every effort should be made to have the patients monitored 2 to 3 times per week
until liver function chemistries ( i.e., ALT, AST, ALP, TBL) resolve, stabilize per 
investigator judgement , orreturn to within the normal range or to baseline levels.
Consultation with a sp ecialist ,such as a hepatologist ,and liver imaging 
(i.e.,ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], co mputerized tomography) 
should be considered for worsening laboratory values or symptoms .

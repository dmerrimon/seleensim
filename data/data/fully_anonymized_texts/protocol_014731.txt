Study Title:  
 A single cent er pi[INVESTIGATOR_305464] e the effect of NATROX® Oxygen Wound Therapy on non-healing wounds  and 
the practical implication of introducing a remote monitoring and telehealth solution to manage th ese complex 
patients in the home care setting.  
Rationale:  There is a wealth of evidence to support the benefits of oxygen therapy on wound healing1-7. Oxygen is required for 
all major processes of wound healing and wound hypoxia is common. Skin wounds can receive oxygen from the 
blood stream via perfusion and from oxygen uptake through the skin. Yet, both wound perfusion and blood oxygen 
levels are frequently insufficient in patients with chronic wounds due to poor circulation, vascular disruptio n, and 
vasoconstriction, thereby [CONTACT_305468]’s capacity to heal.  
Diabetic ulcers, vascular ulcers (venous or arterial), and pressure injuries are all chronic wounds. The pathologies 
underlying chronic wounds can differ widely. However, common shared features include prolonged or excessive 
inflammation, persistent infections, and the inability to respond to reparative stimuli8,9. Adults with vascular disease 
and/or diabetes are at highest risk for chronic leg and foot wounds. The ischemic (reduc ed tissue perfusion) and/ or 
hypoxic lower limb conditions which result from these conditions reduces availability of both oxygen and nutrients, 
making these wounds especially hard to heal. These wounds last on average 12 to 13 months, but this varies wide ly; 
many will remain open for years or never heal8,9, and up to 30% of DFUs go onto amputation10. Even when they do 
heal, wounds recur in 60 -70% of patients, decrease quality of life, and are a significant cause of morbidity8,9. 
 
The need for telehealth and remote patient monitoring in the current climate is critical and reinforces the VA’s 
strategy to protect and care for Veterans, their families, heath care providers and staff in the face of this pandemic .  
The VA’s tactic to shift outpatient care to  a “telehealth” mode, with phone, video and/or electronic communication 
to meet the needs of the ambulatory patient is difficult to achieve in wound care as clinicians relies heavily on the 
visual appearance of the wound to direct their therapy decisions . Thus,  it is imperative to validate a remote 
monitoring tool that  offers  standard telehealth  care  as well as accurate, consistent,  and simple  wound 
measurement and  imagery . Having the ability to manage complex wounds  accurately should enable quick 
identification  of early warning signs that the wound is deteriorating thus facilitating appropriate triaging of patients 
that need urgent face to face medical review.

 Prior to recruitment participants should have clinical documentation of wound progression for a minimum of [ADDRESS_373801] as the point of reference. Participants will be 
commenced on NATROX® Oxygen Wound Therapy with an adhesive foam dressing as a  secondary dressing, 
frequency of  dressing changes  will be dictated by [CONTACT_305469].  The pa rticipant  will be given 
a specially configured iphone (eKare  patient  App and NATROX® Patient library)  along with any relevant  personalised  
instructions , this could include a  video of their dressing regime  to support self application . 
For the first [ADDRESS_373802] with  a face 
to face clinical review s ever y 2 weeks. Patients will be instructed to photograph the wound via the eKare app at 
each dressing change  (minimum of once weekly) which will be transmitted to the wound specialist . Following the 
initial [ADDRESS_373803] . Prior to the  weekly review , patient will be asked 5 qu estions (with yes or no 
answers only) to help identify early warning signs of wound problems along with any compliance issues with the 
chosen therapy. During the study if self application , compliance, or wound  issues are identified by [CONTACT_305470] t or highlighted through the eKare monitoring tools , participants can be triaged for additional clinical 
intervention or support as deemed appropriate.

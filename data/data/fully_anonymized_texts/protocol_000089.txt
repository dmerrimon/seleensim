Statistical Methods
For m ore specific inf ormation, please refer to Section 9of the protocol.  
The analysis populat ions for this protocol are the intent -to-treat (ITT) populat ion, the effi cacy 
evaluable (EE) populat ion,and the safet y popul ation.  
A sample size of approximately 100 subjects will be enrolled as follows:
-Cohort 1: approximately 20 subjects , but no l ess than 14 EE subj ects
-Cohort 2
: approximately 20 subjects
-Cohort 3: up to 60subjects 
A subject who meets all o f the inclusio n/exclusio n criteria will be considered “efficacy 
evaluable” upon receiving ≥ 3 cy cles of l uspatercept and rem ain in the study  for ≥ [ADDRESS_1072652] dose of luspatercept.  Subjects who attain H gb values > 13 g/dL in < 3 cy cles 
will also be considered efficacy evaluable.  Subjects not considered “efficacy evaluable” are in 
general those that receive < 3 cy cles of l uspatercept in which luspatercept is held or discontinued 
or who receive < 3 cyclesdue to a treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) or discontinued 
treatm ent for any  other reason (these subjects will be scored as a nonresponder).

Confident ial and Propri etary 11 ACE -536-MF-001 Amendment 4Final : 19 Feb 2020Subjects willbecome nonefficacy evaluable in certain cases (eg ,prohibited conco mitant 
medicat ion/s was/were used during the study ).  Subjects spec ifically  in Cohort 3 beco me 
nonefficacy  evaluable in certain cases (eg, the ruxolit inib dose was modified during the study ).  
The study  steering co mmittee willreview the allocation of all subjects to the EE populat ion. 
The Sponsor estimates that out of [ADDRESS_1072653] 14 will beco me 
efficacy  evaluable.  For Cohort 1, the probabilit y of observing no responses among 14 subjects is 
lessthan 0.05 if the response probabilit y is greater than 20%.  If no responses are observed in the 
first 14 eval uable subjects, the trial will be stopped because it can be concluded that the response 
rate for the primary endpo int is less than 20% in Cohort [ADDRESS_1072654] s (a total ofapproxim ately 46subjects ) in Cohort 3B. The sample size of 
Cohort 3A remains the same. A total of 46 subjects in Cohort 3B would provide for 80% power 
to detect a 15% increase in response rate for luspatercept over a null response rate of 17%. This 
assumes a o ne-sided ztest of a bino mial proportion (with a 5% significance level).
All efficacy analyses will be conducted primarily in the ITT populat ion.  Confirmat oryanalyses 
will be conducted in the EE populat ion. 
The primary  efficacy  endpoint i s the proporti on of subjects that achieved anemia response as 
defined below: 
Cohort s1 (anemia only) and 3A: 
Proporti on of  subjects achieving ≥1.5 g/dL hemoglo bin increase fro m baseline over any  
consecut ive 84 -day period wi thout an RBC transfusion fro m Day 1 up throug h and including 
Day 168.  Thi s 84- day period will  begin as soon as the ≥1.5 g/dL hemoglobin increase is 
detected.  There must be ≥ 3 determinat ions of ≥1.5 g/dL hemoglobin increase from baseline
in this interval wit h no value showing a < 1.5 g/dL hemoglobin increase from baseline andno 
2measurements are ≥ 42 days apart.
Cohort s2 (RBC -transfusion dependent) and 3B: 
Propor tion of  subjects who beco me RBC -transfusion freeover any consecutive 84 -day 
period from Day 1 up through and includi ng Day  168.  Thi s 84- day period will begin from  
the date of the prior RBC transfusion that is given for a Hgb value ≤9.5 g/dL.
Anemia response rate ,together with a 95% confidence interval ,will be calculated for each 
cohort. 
Secondary  efficacy endpo intanalyses will include:
Time to anemia response will be summarized only  for subjects who achieved anemia 
response. It is defined as t ime from first dose to first onset of anemia response, calculated 
from Day 1 through and including Day 168. 
Duration of anemia response will be summarized only for subjects who achieved anemia 
response. It is defined as maximum durat ion of modified anemia response, calculated from 
Day 1 through end of treatm ent.

Confident ial and Propri etary 20 ACE -536-MF-001 Amendment 4Final : [ADDRESS_1072665] asm (MPN )-associ ated myelo fibrosis is a clonal myelo id neoplasm 
characterized by  [CONTACT_780408] m arrow function, bone marrow fibrosis, extramedullary 
hematopoiesis, a propensit y fortransformation to blast phase, and an inflammatory  state.  Levels 
of hematopoi etic stem and progenitor cells in the blood are increased ,reflect ing abnormal 
homing of hematopoietic stem and progeni tor cells.  Hem atopoi esis in MPN -associ ated 
myelo fibrosis is clonal arising fro m a transformed multipotent hematopoiet ic progenitor cell.
The cause of MPN -associ ated myel ofibrosis is unknown and there are no known etiological 
factors.  About 50% of patients with MPN -associ ated myel ofibrosis have a mutation in the Janus 
kinase 2 ( JAK2) gene , about 33% of patients have a mutation in the calreticulin(CALR )gene,
and about 5% of patients have a mutation inthe thrombopoi etin receptor (MPL ) gene .  About 
25% of patients have no detectable mutation and are referred to as triple -negative .  Mutati ons in 
other genes such as TET2, ASXL1 and DMT3A are also sometimes found and can precede or 
follow development of the driver mutations.  
Myel oproliferative neopl asm (MPN )-associ ated myelo fibrosis can develop direct ly (primary 
myelo fibrosis [PMF] ) or evolve fro m other MPNs ,including po lycyt hemia vera (PV) and 
essent ial thrombocy themia (ET).  F or purposes of this study , MPN -associated myelo fibrosis is 
defined as PMF, post -polycyt hemia vera myelo fibrosis (post -PV MF), and post -essent ial 
thrombocy themia myel ofibrosis (post -ET MF).  
1.1.1. Signs and Symptoms 
Myel oproliferative neopl asm (MPN )
-associ ated myelo fibrosis is pre dominately a disease of the 
elderly  with a median age at onset in a range of 69 to 76 y ears ( Moul ard, 2013) .  Ery thropoiesis 
is qualitat ively and quant itatively abnormal result ing in anemia in about 30% of affected patients 
atdiagnosis .  However, eventually all affected p atients develop anemia .  Anemia is often 
confounded by [CONTACT_780409][INVESTIGATOR_780387] o lder populat ion like atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease and cerebrovascular disease.  Severe anemia unresponsive to thera py can be fatal .  
Myel opoiesis is also qualitat ively and quant itatively abnormal result ing in decreased or increased 
granulocy tes and/or pl atelets.  Infect ion risk is increased because of decreased numbers of and/or 
dysfunct ional granulo cytes.  Furtherm ore, there may  be bleeding from decreased numbers o f 
and/or dysfunct ional platel ets.  Extra medullary hematopoiesis ,typi[INVESTIGATOR_780388] -associ ated 
myelo fibrosis ,resul ts in spleen and liver enlargement (splenomegaly  and hepatom egaly , 
respectively ) in about 60% of affected patients at diagnosis result ing in early sat iety, wei ght loss, 
and const itutional symptom s.  
Myeloproliferat ive neoplasm ( MPN )-associated myelo fibrosis is a 
progressive disorder such that many o f the signs and symptom s discussed above will develop
with time even in patients in who m they are absent at di agnosis.  
1.1.2. Prognosis 
Median survival of patientswith MPN -associated myelo fibrosis is 5 to 6 years fro m diagnosis.  
Several prognostic scores are used that combine independent prognostic variables including age, 
gender, spleen and/or liver enlargement, hemoglobin (Hgb) level, red bl ood cell ( RBC)-
transfusio n dependence, numbers of leukocy tes and/or pl atelets, numbers of monocy tes or

2009; Dupri ez, 1996 ; Tefferi , 2007 ; Tefferi , 2009 ).  In a recent study  involving >1000 subjects ,
multivaria te analysis of parameters ob tained at di agnosis i dentified age > 65 years, constitutional 
symptoms, hemoglobin concentrati on < 10 g/dL, leukocy te levels >25
x 109/L and blood 
myelo blasts ≥ 1% as predictors of shortened survival.  Several o f these paramete rs are al so 
associ ated wi th an increased ri sk of transformat ion to bl ast phase.  In this study , the y early  
incidence rates for transformat ion to blast phase was 3.7% and deat hs due to transformat ion to 
blast phase within a 10 -year period was 18% ( Quintas -Cardama, 2013 ; updated by  [CONTACT_780410] 01 May  2017 ).  
Patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_780389] -associ ated myelo fibrosi s after PV or ET have the same prognosis to 
those wi th PMF.
Recent ly, associat ions are reported between prognosis and mutational landscape.  For example, 
patients with CALR mutations have the best prognosis whereas those with no detectable mutation 
(triple negative ) have the worst prognosis.  The conco mitant presence of non-driver mutations,
such as those in ASXL1 , TET2 and DNMT3A ,are also associated with a worse prognosis.
1.2. Treatment of MPN -associated Myelofibrosis 
Two types of  therapi [INVESTIGATOR_780390] -associated myelo fibrosi s: (1) targeting the cancer clone 
and (2) targeting signs and symptoms of the disease.  Current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_780391].  Commo nly used therap ies include drugs to reverse anemia (refer to below), drugs to 
decrease the size of t he neoplast ic clone ,and ant i-inflammatory  drugs , where s ometimes these 
targets overlap.  Splenectomy and/or spleen radiat ion are also sometimes done, whereas 
hematopoi etic cell transplants are rarely used because of advanced age and co -morbidities.
In 2011 and 2012, the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA )and European Medicines Agency 
(EMA) , respectively ,approved ruxolitinib, a Janus kinase ( JAK)inhibitor intended for therapy  of 
MPN -associ ated myel ofibrosis.  Currently, it is the standard of care for trea ting spleno megaly 
and const itutional symptom s, offering significant improvements in spleen shrinkage, symptom 
mitigation, and overall survival.  However, therapy -induced cytopenias like anemia may impair 
administration of optimal therapeut ic doses as they can occur transient ly.
Several other JAK or signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STAT )inhibitors are 
currently in development , and though they are not targeted , they are effect ive in reducing 
splenomegaly  and const itutional symptom s in patients with and wi thouttheJAK2 mutation.  
However, t here is controversy whether they improve survival. Several other drug classes are in 
development including telo merase inhibitors and ant i-fibrotic drugs ( eg, pentraxin).  
1.2.1. Treatment for Anemia 
Anemia is present at diagnosis in about 30% of p atients with MPN -associated myelo fibrosis and 
develops in almost all patients.  The eti ology of anemia in MPN- associated myel ofibrosis is 
complex, as several mechanisms may operate in an affected person ( Barosi , 2010).   Some drugs 
used to treat MPN -associated myelo fibrosis ,such as hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) and 
ruxolitinib, worsen anemia.  
Overall, a nemia and RBC- transfusio ndependence are strong, independent prognostic variables 
for survival and for risk of transformat ion to bl ast phase (Passamo nti, 2010; El ena, 2011 ).

pomalidomide and corticosteroids report contradictory  data ( Tefferi, 2017; Schlenk, 2016 ).
In summary, no therapy  has been proven safe and effect ive to treat anemia in p atientswith MPN -
associ ated myel ofibrosis .  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents 
Erythropoi esis stimulat ing agent s(ESAs) are widely used for the treatment of anemia associated 
with both lymphoid and myelo id neopl asms.  In general, serum ery thropoi etin (EPO) levels in 
patients with MPN -associated myel ofibrosis are elevated for the degree of anemia and 
exogenous use of ESAs are of limited value ( Barosi, 1993). 
Some patients with EPO l evels < 500 IU/L receive pharmacological doses of reco mbinant human 
EPO.  Response rates a re <20% and complete responses are unco mmo n, while m ost responses 
are transient.  Currently, t here are no randomized clinical trials o f recombinant human EPO in 
patients with MPN -associated myelo fibrosis who are RBC -transfusio n dependent.  Retrospective 
series in such pat ients treated with EPO or darbepoetin reported occasional response (Cervantes, 
2004; Cervantes, 2006 ; Rodri guez, 1998 ; Tsiara, 2007 ).  The data suggest ESAs have limited 
therapeuti c act ivity in RBC- transfusio n dependent patients with MPN -associated myelofibrosis 
and anemia regardless of serum EPO levels ( Huang, 2009 ).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Androgenic Steroids 
Andr ogenic steroi ds are sometimes used to treat anemia in patients with MPN -associ ated 
myelo fibrosis.  A retrospective analys is of case reports i dentified 5 of 27 (18%) subjects with 
MPN -associ ated myel ofibrosis and RBC -transfusion -dependence responding to tre atment
with 
danazol (Cervantes, 2015 ).  Complete responses are unco mmo n and often transient , whi ch are in 
line with earlier studies .  Additionally, a ndrogenic steroids are associated with risks of liver 
toxicity and liver and prostate cancers.  Based on these data ,use of androgenic steroids in this 
setting is not proven safe and effect ive in patients with MPN -associated myelo fibrosis who are 
RBC- transfusio ndependent ( Branda, 1977; Brubaker, 1982 ; Cervantes, 2005 ;Levy, 1996 ).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Corticosteroids 
Corti costeroi ds do not produce sustained improvement in hemoglo bin concentrations in patients 
with MPN -associated myelo fibrosis.  Corticosteroids are poorly -tolerated, especially in o lder
patients, and increase infect ion risk in patients with decreased norma l spleen funct ion and in 
patients who have been splenectomized (Odeni ke, 2005) .

active in modulat ing levels of inflammatory  cytokines and growth factors.  Data from 
experimental models and a Celgene -sponsored trial indicate pom alidomide increases
erythropoi esis in mice wit h sickle cell disease and humans with MPN -associated myelo fibrosis.  
A rando mized Phase 3 study  showed no benefit of low -dose pom alidomide over placebo in 
subjects with RBC -transfusio ndependence (Tefferi, 2017 ).  However, a Phase 2 study  of a 
higher dose of pomalido mide co mbined with prednisone reported activit y (Schlenk, 2016 ).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Sotatercept
Sotatercept (ACE -011) i s a novel so luble receptor fusio n protein (activin recepto r type IIA 
linked to Fc fragment of human immunogl obulin [ Ig]G1) that “traps” ligands that bind to the 
activin ty pe IIA receptor.  
Sotatercept is extensively studied in humans and is active in treating anemia in pat ients 
associ ated wi th β-thalassemia and myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ).  Like luspatercept, 
sotatercept targets mo lecules in the transforming growth factor -beta ( TGF -β)superfamily , but 
sotatercept contains the human activin t ype IIA receptor whereas luspatercept contains the 
activin ty pe IIB re ceptor.
Sotatercept is current ly being studied in subjects with MPN -associated myelo fibrosis and anemia 
receiving or not receiving ruxo litinib.  Preliminary results suggest sotatercept improves anemia 
and RBC -transfusio n dependence in pat ients with MPN -associated myel ofibrosis and i s well -
tolerated (Bose, 2016 ).
1.3. Luspatercept Backgroun d
Luspatercept (ACE -536) i s a recombinant fusio n protein consist ing of a modified form of the 
extracellular domain (ECD) of the human act ivin rec eptor ty pe IIB (ActRIIB) linked to the IgG1 
Fc domain ( Figure 1A). The ActRIIB receptor and its ligands are members of the transforming 
growth factor -β (TGF -β) superfamily, a group of proteins invo lved in the development, 
different iation, and/or maturation of various tissues.  No species differences have been described 
in the ligand- receptor interactions amo ng m embers of the TGF -β family  as the ligands and 
receptors are highly conserved across species ( Massague, 1998 ).  Thus, observat ions from  
pharmaco logy studi es of luspatercept or its murine ortholog RAP -536 in animal models provide 
significant insight into the potential o f luspatercept to treat human disease. 
Members of the TGF -β ligands ,through their binding to activin receptors, are invo lved in 
modulat ing the different iation of late -stage ery throcyte precursors (norm oblasts) in the bone 
marrow. In particular, luspatercept acts as a ligand trap for growth different iation factor 11 
(GDF11 )and other TGF -βfamily ligands to suppress Smad2/3 signaling. In nonclinical 
experiments, luspatercept has been shown to bind with high affinit y to some TGF -β ligands ( eg, 
GDF11, bone morphogenetic protein 6 [ BMP6 ]and activin B) but substant ially lessto others 
(eg, bone morph ogenet ic protein 9 [ BMP9 ]and activin A). The m echanism o f action of  
luspatercept is independent fro m that of erythropoietin ( EPO ) (Suragani, 2014). While EPO 
stimulates proliferat ion and different iation of early ery throid progeni tors, l uspatercept prom otes

During norm al erythropoi esis, GDF11 appears to inhibit different iation and m aintain the survival 
of immature ery throid progeni tors, but i ts expression is decreased as cells mature, and thus its 
effect is transient. In a mouse m odel of thalassemia, defects in ery throid differentiation led to an 
accumulat ion of GDF11 expressing cells that maintained their own survival ( Dussi ot, 2014 ). 
Recent studi es (Dussiot, 2014 ; Suragani, 2014) i dent

and showed that its inhibit ion in mouse m odels of anemia wit h ineffect ive erythropoiesis restores

Luspatercept is current ly in Phase 3 of clinical  devel opment in MDS and beta -thalassemia. 
Luspatercept is current ly being assessed in two Phase 2 studies in subjects with MDS .  In these 
studi es,the preliminary  Internati onal Working Group ( IWG ) hem atologic improvem ent –
erythroid (HI-
E)response for subjects treated wi th luspatercept dose levels o f ≥ 0.75 m g/kg in 
the base study  (A536 -03) and the extensio n study (A536 -05) respectively were seen in 1 8out of 
29 (62% ) and 19 out of 23 (83%) subjects with ring si deroblast s (RS+)with EPO levels < 200 
U/L, as well as 5 out of 11 (46%) and 7 out of 8 (88%)RS+ subjects with EPO levels 200 to 500
U/L. Subjects were al so evaluated on the bas is of whether they  achieved RBC -transfusio n
independence (RBC- TI)for ≥8 weeks. The RBC -TI response for subjects treated wi th 
luspatercept dose levels o f ≥0.75 m g/kg in the base stu dy and extensio n study  respect ively were 
seen in 13 out of 19 (68%)and 10 out of 14 (71%
)RS+ subjects with EPO l evels < 200 U/L, as 
well as 3 out of 9 (33%) and 3 out of 5 (60%) RS+ subjects with EPO l evels 200 to 500
U/L. Furthermore, in the extension study, 17 out of 28 (61%) subjects overall had achieved 
transfusio n independence, in which the longest duration of ery throid response was up to 22 
months (treatment ongoing) (Platzbecker, 20 16).
Preliminary data for RS -subjects is encouraging for both HI -E response and RBC -TI.
In a Phase 3 (MEDALIST) trial, luspatercept resulted in a significant ly reduced transfusio n 
burden compared with placebo in pat ients with anemia due to R evised Intern ational Prognosti c 
Scoring Sy stem  (IPSS-R ) very low- , low-, or intermediate -risk MDS with ring sideroblasts who 
requi re RBC transfusio ns, and overall , was generally  well tol erated. Data demonstrated that 58 
out of 153 (37.9%) subjects in the luspatercept arm achieved RBC transfusio n independence for 
≥ 8 weeks compared to 10 out of 76 (13.2%) subjects in the placebo arm ( Fenaux, 2018).
Luspatercept is current ly being assessed in two Phase 2 studies i n subjects with β -thalassemi a.  
In these studies, 25 out of 31 (81%) transfusio n-depende nt (TD) subjects treated with ≥ 
0.6mg/kg had a ≥20% reducti on and 17 out of 31 subjects (
55%) had a ≥50% reduction in 
transfusio n burden over any 12- week peri od during the 3 -month study  (A536-04). For 
nontransfusio n dependen t (NTD) subjects treated with ≥ 0.6 m g/kg, 7 out of 21 subjects (
33%)
achieved an increase in Hgb ≥1.5 g/dL sustained for ≥14 day s and 13 out of 21 subjects (62%
)
achieved a m ean increase in Hgb ≥ 1.0 g/dL sustained for ≥12 weeks in the 3 -month treatment 
study (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_99331], 2016 )
.
In a Phase 3 (BELIEVE) trial, luspatercept resulted in significant ly reduced transfusio n burden in 
adults wi th transfusi on-dependent β-thalassemia, and overall, was generally  well tolerated.  Data 
demonstrated that 48 out of 224 (21.4%) subjects in the luspatercept arm achieved a ≥ 33% 
reducti on from baseline in transfusio n burden during weeks 13 to 24 compared to 5 out of 112 
(4.5%) subjects in the placebo arm ( Cappellini, 2018 ).
Until now, no clinical trials invest igating the efficacy  of luspatercept in MPN -associated 
myelo fibrosis have been init iated/completed.  
Addit ional information regarding clinical experience with luspatercept is summarized in the 
current version of the luspatercept IB.

Increases in hematol ogic parameters ( ie, RBC, Hgb, hematocri t, reticul ocytes) are expected 
pharmacologic effects of luspatercept treatment.  Increases in systolic and diastolic blood 
pressures may  occur i n concert wi th increases in hemoglobin values.  Excessive or rapid 
increases in hemoglo bin or blood pressure may occur and will be mo nitored.  Dos e modificat ion 
rules for individual subjects, including dose delay and/or dose reduction, will be utilized to 
minimize risks associated with increased RBC parameters. 
Adverse events observed in the Phase [ADDRESS_1072668] ion site reactions (hemorrhage, pruritus, rash), skin rash, hyperesthesia, muscle spasms, 
myalgia, pruritus, and hyperkalemia.
As wi th all bi ologics, the re is the potential for ant idrug antibodies (ADA) that can be associated 
with increased drug clearance and hypersensit ivity reacti ons.  Antidrug antibody ( ADA )
formation against l uspatercept as well as human ActRIIB protein will be monitored in the init ial
clinical studies. 
Luspatercept has exhibited maternal and developmental toxicit y in reproductive toxicit y studi es 
in preclinical species and therefore luspatercept should not be administered to pregnant or

1.4. Rationale
1.4.1. Study Rationale and Purpose
Anemia and rel ated symptom s are important features of MPN -associated myelo fibrosis.  Patients 
with anemia and those receiving RBC transfusio ns have significantly worse survival and an 
increased risk of transformat ion to bl ast phase. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_780392], androgenic steroids ,
and corticosteroids are rarely  effect ivewith most responses transient ,while d ata regarding 
efficacy  of pomalido mide iscontroversial.  No drug is approved to treat an emia in patients with 
MPN -associ ated myel ofibrosis.  
Luspatercept is a novel recombinant fusio n protein consist ing of a modified form of the 
extracellular domain (ECD) of the human act ivin receptor ty pe IIB (ActRIIB).  Luspatercept 
stimulates the l ater, m aturati on phase of ery thropoiesis and improves anemia in patients with 
MDS and beta -thalassemia.  Sotatercept, active in patients with MPN -associated myelofibrosis 
and an emia, i s structurally  similar toluspatercept.

3.1. Study Design
The study  will be conducted in com pliance wi th the International Council forHarm onisati on 
(ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceut icals for Hum an Use/Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory  requi rements.
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open -label study to evaluate the efficacy  and safet y of luspatercept 
in subjects w ith MPN -associated myelofibrosis and anemia with and without RBC
-transfusion 
dependence.  The study  is divided into a Screening Period, a Treatment Period (consist ing of a 
Primary Phase, a Day  169 Disease Response Assessment, and an Extensi on Phase), fo llowed by  
a Posttreatm entFollow -u
p Peri od.  The overall study  design is described in Figure 2, wi th more 
detailed descript ions for each phase of the study  design found in Secti on6.
Subjects satisfying the eligibilit y criteria will be assigned to 1of the following cohorts (which 
are enrolling in parallel) based on their eligibilit y: 
Cohort 1: will contain up to 20 subjects with anemia only that are not currently 
receiving RBC transfusio ns (these subjects will be referred to as “anemia only” 
throughout the protocol , defined as 0 RBC uni ts/84 day s immediately  upto the C1D1
date)
Cohort 2: will contain up to 20 subjects that are RBC -transfusion dependent ( these 
subjects will be r eferred to as “RBC -transfusio n dependent” throughout the protocol, 
defined as an average RBC transfusio n frequency of 2 to 4 RBC units /[ADDRESS_1072672] the 84 days immediately up to the C1D1 date )
Cohort 3A : will contain ≥ 10 subjects who meet the eli gibilit y criteria for Cohort 1 
(anemia only) while being on a stable dose of ruxolit inib for at least 112 days
immediately  prior to the enrollment date
Cohort 3B : will contain approximately 46 subjects who meet the eligibilit y criteria 
for Cohort 2 (RBC -transfusio n dependent) while being on a stable dose of ruxo litinib 
for at least [ADDRESS_1072673] 280 days (40 
weeks )without interruptions exceeding [ADDRESS_1072674] 112 day s (16 weeks) immediately prior to the enrollment 
date.
Refer to the eligibilit ycriteria (Secti on4) for full cohort specifications.   
The subject must be enrolled at the latest 28 day s from  signing the informed conse nt form (ICF) , 
designated as the enro llment date .  The first dose of luspatercept (designated as Cycle 1 Day  1 
[C1D1 ]
) should be administered as soon as possible (at the latest 3 calendar days) following the 
enrollment date (but can occur on the same day a s the enrollment date) .
Subjects across each cohort will receive a starting dose level of luspatercept at 1.0 m g/kg 
subcutaneous inject ion every  3 weeks ( administered on Day  1 of each 21 -day treatm ent cy cle).

Confident ial and Propri etary 50 ACE -536-MF-001 Amendment 4Final : 19 Feb 2020cOn dosing days, local laboratory sample should be collected, with white blood count (WBC) and Hgb levels assessed prior to ea ch luspatercept administration to ensure dose 
modification rules are followed.  Blood myeloblasts sh ould also be assessed prior to luspatercept dosing.  In case a subject had an elevated blood myeloblast percentage at the 
previous treatment cycle ( ≥ 10%), the blood myeloblast percentage needs to be assessed within a week prior to the next treatm ent cycle .  In these circumstances, a split sample 
should also be collected and sent to the central laboratory for analysis.  Subjects must have blood pressure assessed prior t o each luspatercept administration.  Should a dose 
delay occur on the day of dosing, refe r to Section 7.3for more information .
dCentral assessments are not required when local test results confirming HIV, HepB, Hep C are available within 8 weeks immedia tely prior to the enrollment date. If bey ond this 
window, additional central laboratory testing will be requested.
eOnly serious adverse events (SAEs) related to luspatercept will be captured post the [ADDRESS_1072727] (including any at outside institutions in between study visits) prior to each dose of luspatercept
via use of a transfusion diary or other local procedure in place at the investigational site .  Subjects should record information relating to transfusions (eg, date of transfusion, 
pretransfusion Hgb levels, number of units transfused, volume of transfusion, etc.) they may have received outside the study site .  In addition to local procedures that may be in 
place at the site to capture this inf ormation, a transfusion diary will be provided to all subjects and will be reviewed by [CONTACT_535288]/if returned by [CONTACT_29320].

transformation to blast phase , posttreatment myelo fibrosis therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014]).  Procedures are described 
in detail below.
Safety laboratory  analyses and all laboratory  assessments will be performed centrally  (except 
otherwi se stated in this sect ion) during the Treatment Period.  
Local  laboratori es are only allowed in cases when timely  resul ts are needed ( eg, study  treatment 
dosing decisio ns, hematol ogy assessments between clinic visit s, adverse events).  In these 
circumstances, a split sample should st ill be co llected and sent to the central laboratory for 
analysis.  Local laboratory  data shoul d be collected in the electronic case report form ( eCRF)if 
relevant to dose administration, dose modification, an AE, or when no central laboratory  resul ts 
were obtained
.  
Refer to the e CRF co mpletion guidelines for addi tional informat ion related to data entry  
requi rements of lo cal laboratori es.  
Sample collect ion, processing, storage, and shipment procedures will be provided in the Study  
Laboratory  Manual.
6.1. Screening P eriod
Upon giving written informed consent, subjects enter the Screening Period to determine 
eligibilit y. Subject screening procedures (performed locally/centrally) aretotake place over a 
maximum o f [ADDRESS_1072730] dose of 
luspatercept (designated as the C1D1 date) should be administered as soon as pos sible (at the 
latest 3 calendar days) fo llowing the enrollment date . During the Screening Period, the subject 
will undergo safet y and other assessments to determine eligibilit y for the study .  Screening 
laboratory  values m ust dem onstrate subj ect eligibili ty but may be repea ted wi thin the screening 
window if clinically  justified.  Subjects that have met all eligibilit y criteria during the Screening 
Period will be eligible for enrollment.  
Review of historical bone marrow biopsy informatio n will be used to confirm MPN -associ ated 
myelo fibrosis diagnosis.  The report should co me from  the m ost recent local bone m arrow 
biopsy performed and shoul dcontain the mutational status of the disease ( eg, JAK2, MPL , and 
CALR ).

Luspatercept will be provided by [CONTACT_1034]. Luspatercept for injection is formulated as a 
sterile, preservat ive-free, ly ophilized cak e/powder.  Luspatercept for injection is available in [ADDRESS_1072762] ituted, each consists of 50 mg/mL luspatercept in a  mM 
citrate buffer -based so lution (  mM citrate, pH % sucrose, % polysorbate 80).  
The recommended storage condi tion for luspatercept for inject ion (25 m g/vial  and 75 m g/vial; 
lyophilized powder form ulation) is 2°Cto 8°C.  Reconst ituted luspatercept in its original 
container closure system may  be held for up to 10 hours at 2°C to 8°C, however it shoul d be 
administered at room temperature. It is recommended that the reconstituted luspatercept for

7.7. Investigational Product Accountability and Disposal 
Accountabilit y for luspatercept that is administered during the course of the study  is the 
responsibilit y of the Investigator or designee.  Investigat ional clinical supplies must be received 
by a designated person at the clinical site and kept in a secure and temperature -controlled 
location.  Th e invest igational site must maintain accurate records demonstrating dates and 
amounts of luspatercept received, to whom it was administered (subject -by-subject accounting), 
and accounts of any luspatercept accidentally or deliberately destroyed or returned .  Accurate 
recording of all luspatercept administration will be made in the appropriate section of the 
subject’s eCRF and source documents.  Unless otherwise notified, all vials of luspatercept , both 
used and unused, must be saved for drug accountabilit y.  The used vials may be discarded, per 
the inst itution’s standard practice, after drug accountabilit y has been completed by  [CONTACT_941] m onitor.  
The Investigator must return all unused vials of luspatercept to the Sponsor at the end of the 
study , or luspatercept may be destroy ed at the clinical site wit h the permissio n of the Sponsor.  
For ei ther scenario, the outcome must be documented on the drug accountabilit y log.  The 
Sponsor will provide direct ion for the outcome of all unused vials.

site versus Celgene (or designee).
7.8. Investigational Product Compliance
Luspatercept will be administered as a subcutaneous inject ion at the clinical site by [CONTACT_780426].  Monitoring for subject compliance with the treatment regimen is therefore unnecessary.
Accurate recording o f all luspatercept administration will be made in the appro priate secti on of

9.2. Study Population Definitions
Subjects will be enro lled to provide approximately 100ITTsubjects in this study , denoted by  [CONTACT_780427]:   
Cohort 1 (anemia only) :
Approximately  20subjects ,but no l ess than 14 efficacy  evaluable subjects ,with MPN -
associ ated myel ofibrosis who are RBC -transfusio n independent (no RBC transfusio ns wi thin 
at least 84 days immediately up to the C1D1 date) with anemia will be enro lled in Cohort 1 
and receive luspatercept at a starting dose levelof 1.0 m g/kg (subcutaneous inject ion on Day  
1 of a 21- day treatment cy cle) for up to 8 cy cles (or up through Day  168 in the event of dose 
delays).  Shoul d subjects meet the clinical benefit definit ion, they  may continue treatment for 
approximately 2 years or morefrom the C1D1 date following the Day  169 Disease Response 
Assessment.   
Cohort 2 (RBC -transfusion dependent ):
Approximately 20 subjects wi th MPN -associ ated myel ofibrosis and an average RBC-
transfusio n burden o f 2to 4RBC units /28 days (calculated from the 84 -day period 
immediately  up to the C1D1 date ) will be enro lled in Cohort 2 and receive luspatercept at a 
starting dose level of 1.0 m g/kg (subcutaneous injection on Day  1 of a 21 -day treatm ent 
cycle) for up to 8 cy cles (or up through Day  168 in the event of dose delays).  Shoul d 
subjects meet the clinical benefit definit ion, they  may cont inue treatment for approximately 2 
years or more, from the C1D1 date following the Day 169 Disease Response Assessment.   
Cohort 3 (subjects on ruxolitinib as part of their standard -of-care therapy):
Approximately 60subjects will be enro lled in Cohort [ADDRESS_1072777] 112 day s(16 weeks) immediately up to the enro llment date .Effective 
from Protocol  Amendment 3, theadditional subjects enrolled into Cohort 3Bmust also have 
a minimum prior treatment with ruxolit inib per their local standard -of-care for at l east 280 
days (40 weeks) without i nterrupti ons exceeding 2 consecut ive weeks leading up to the date 
of enro llment.   These subjects will receive luspatercept at a starting dose level of 1.0 m g/kg 
(subcutaneous injection on Day  1 of a 21 -day treatment cy cle) for up to 8 cycles (or up 
through Day  168 in the event of dose delays) *Note for Protocol Amendment 3 :Addit ional

Study  popul ations to be analyzed are defined as fo llows:
Intent -to-treat (ITT) Population: 
The intent -to-treat (ITT) populat ion will consist of all enrolled subjects regardless of whether or 
not the subject received luspatercept.  Efficacy analyses will be conducted primarily on the ITT 
popul ation.  
Efficacy E valuable (EE) Population :
A subject who meets all the inclusio n/exclusio n criteri a will be considered “efficacy evaluable” 
upon receiving ≥ 3 cycles of luspatercept and remain in the study  for ≥ [ADDRESS_1072778] dose of l uspatercept.  Subj ects who attain Hgb values > 13 g/dL in < 3 cycles will also be 
considered effi cacy evaluable.   Subjects not considered “efficacy evaluable” are in general those 
that receive < 3 cy cles of luspatercept in which luspatercept is held or discont inued or who 
receive < 3 cy cles due to a treatm ent-emergent adverse event (TEAE) or discont inued treatment 
for any  other reason.
Subjects will become nonefficacy evaluable in certain cases ( eg, prohibited conco mitant 
medicat ion/swas/were used during the study ).  Subjects specifically  in Cohort 3 beco me 
noneff icacy evaluable in certain cases (eg, the ruxolit inib dose was m odified during the study ).  
The study  steering co mmittee willreview the allocation of all subjects to the EE populat ion.  
Efficacy analyses will be conducted based on the ITT and EE populat ions.  
Safety Population : 
The Safet y Popul ation will consist of all subjects who were enrolled and received at least 1dose 
of luspatercept . 
Statistical methods to handle missing data will be described in the statist ical analysis plan (SAP).
The SAP will describe any  predefined rul es for including/excluding any subjects with data from 
any analyses ( eg, time windows, visit by  [CONTACT_292038], endpoint analysis, protocol vio lation).  
9.3. Sample Size and Power Considerations
The Sponsor estimates that out of [ADDRESS_1072779] 14 will beco me 
efficacy  evaluable.  
For Cohort 1, the probabilit y of observing no responses amo ng 14 subjects is less than 0.05 if the 
response probabilit y is greater than 20%. If no responses are o bserved in the first 14 evaluable 
subjects, the trial is stopped because it can be concluded that the response rate for the primary 
endpo int is less than 20% in Cohort 1.  
For Cohort 2, the probabilit y of observing no responses amo ng 14 subjects is less t han 0.05 if the 
response probabilit y is greater than 20%.  If no responses are observed in the first 14 evaluable 
subjects, enrollment in this cohort will be stopped because it can be concluded that the response 
rate for the primary endpo int is less than 2 0% in Cohort 2.

Response rate will be calculated using the number of responders divided by [CONTACT_780431] (responders plus nonresponders ).
Anemia response rate ,together with a 95% confidence interval ,will be calculated for each 
cohort. 
9.6.2. Secondary Efficacy Analys es 
Time to anemia response will be summarized only  for subjects who achieved anemia response.
It is defined as time fro m first dose to first onset of anemia response, calculated fro m Day [ADDRESS_1072780] per 28 days .It will be calculated from Day 1 through and including Day  168 and Day 1 
through end of treatm ent. 
Frequency of RBC -transfusion dependence will be assessed for Cohort 2 subjects and RBC
-
transfusio n dependent subjects in Cohort 3B. It is defined as the proporti on of  subjects who 
reduce thei r transfusio n burden by  ≥ 50% from baseline over any consecutive 84 -day period. It 
will be calculated from Day 1 through and including Day  168 and Day  1 through end of

The term  “severe” is often used to describe the intensit y of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial infarct ion); the event itself, however, may be of relat ively minor medical 
significanc e (such as severe headache).  This criterio n is notthe same as “serious” which is 
based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associ ated wi th events that pose a threat to a 
subject’s life or funct ioning.  
Seriousness, not severit y, serves as a gui de for defining regul atory  obligat ions.
10.2.3. Causality
The Investigator must determine the relat ionship between the administration o f luspatercept and 
the occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below:
Not suspected: a causal relat ionship of the adverse event to luspatercept
administration is unlikely or remote , or other m edicat ions, 
therapeuti c intervent ions, or underlying condit ions provide a 
sufficient explanat ion for the observed event.
Suspected: there is a reasonable possibility that the administration of 
luspatercept caused the adverse event.  ‘Reasonable possibilit y’ 
means there is evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship between 
the luspatercept and the adverse event.

If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a comparator, ancillary or addit ional 
luspatercept that has not bee n manufactured or provided by  [CONTACT_27718], pl ease provi de the name [CONTACT_198532].
10.2.4. Duration
For both AEs and SAEs, the Invest igator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the 
event.
10.2.5. Action Taken
The Investigator will report the action taken with luspatercept as a result of an AE or SAE, as 
applicable ( eg, discont inuat ion, interruption, or dose reduction of luspatercept , as appropriate) 
and report if conco mitant and/or addit ional treatm ents were given for the event. 
10.2.6. O utcome
The Investigator will report the outcome of the event for both AEs and SAEs.
All SAEs that have not resolved upon discont inuatio n of the subject’s participat ion in the study  
must be fo llowed until recovered (returned to baseline), recovered with seq uelae, or death (due to 
the SAE ).
10.3. Adverse Events of Special Interest
The occurrence of a new malignancy  or prem alignant lesio n will be monitored as an event of 
special interest and shoul d be included as part of the assessment of adverse events throughout t he 
course of the study . Invest igators are to report the development of any new malignancy or 
prem alignant l esion as a seri ous adverse event, regardless of causal relat ionship to IP, occurring 
at any  time for the duration of the study , from the time of sig ning the ICF up to and including at 
least [ADDRESS_1072791] dose of IP of the 
Posttreatm ent Follow -up Peri od, whi chever occurs later .
Events of new malignancy  and premalignant l esions(excluding benign tumo rs or benign 
neopl asia) are to be reported within [ADDRESS_1072792] igator’s knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_6791], 
or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form, and must be considered an “Important 
Medical Event” even if no other serious criteria ap ply; these events must also be documented in 
the appropriate page(s) of the eCRF and subject’s source documents. Documentation of the 
diagnosed m alignancy must be provided at the time of reporting as a serious adverse event ( eg, 
any confirmatory  histol ogy or cy tology resul ts, x-rays, computed tom ography  [CT]scans, etc.).
Malignancies or cancerous tumors are lesio nscapable of invading into adjacent tissues and may 
be capable of spreading to distant tissues.  A benign tumor has none of those properties.
Malignancy  or cancer is characterized by [CONTACT_292049], invasiveness, and metastasis.  For MPN -
associ ated myelo fibrosis studies, these also include transformat ion to bl ast phase , 
myeloproliferat ion (eg, clinically significant increase s in blasts), etc.

Confident ial and Propri etary 84 ACE -536-MF-001 Amendment 4Final : 19 Feb 2020Prem alignant or precancerous lesio ns refer to a state of disordered morpho logy of cells that i s 
associ ated wi th an increased ri sk of cancer.  If left untreated, these condit ions may lead to 
cancer.  Such condit ions are usually eit her dy splasia or benign neoplasia (and the dividing line 
between those is so metimes blurry).  Somet imes the term "precancer" is used to describe 
carcino ma in situ, whi ch is a noninvasive cancer that has not progressed to an aggressive, 
invasive stage.  Not all ca rcino ma in situ will  progress to invasive disease.
Prem alignant l esions are m orphol ogically at ypi[INVESTIGATOR_780402].
10.4. Abnormal Laboratory Values
An abnormal laboratory  value is considered to be an AE ifthe abnorm ality:
resul ts in discont inuat ion from the study;
requi res treatm ent, m odificat ion/ interruption of luspatercept dose, or any other 
therapeuti c intervent ion; or
is judged to be of significant clinical importance, eg, one that indicates a new disease 
process and/or organ toxicit y, or is an exacerbat ion or worsening of an exist ing 
condi tion.
Regardless of severit y grade, only  laboratory  abnorm alities that fulfill a seriousn ess cri terion 
need to be document ed as a serious adverse event.
If a laboratory  abnorm ality is one com ponent of a di agnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/screen of the eCRF .  If the abnormalit y was not 
a part of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the laboratory  abnorm ality should be recorded as the AE. 
If possible, the laboratory  abnorm ality should be recorded as a medical term and not simply  as an 
abnorm al laboratory  resul t (eg,record thrombocy topeni a rather than decreased platelets).
10.5. Pregnancy
All pregnancies or suspected pregnancies occurring in eit her a female subject of childbearing 
potenti al or partner of childbearing potential of a male subject are immediately reportable e vents .  
10.5.1. Females of Childbearing Potential:
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including elevated β-hCG or posi tive pregnancy test in a 
female subject of childbearing potential regardless of disease state) occurring while the subject is 
on luspatercept , or wi thin [ADDRESS_1072793] ’s last dose of luspatercept , are considered 
immediately  reportabl e events.  Luspatercept is to be discont inued immediately . The pregnancy , 
suspected pregnancy , or posi tive pregnancy  test must be reported to Celgene Drug Safet y 
immediately  by [CONTACT_6968] , phone or facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the Pregnancy  
Initial Report Form , or approved equivalent form.  
The female subject may be referred to an obstetrician- gyneco logist or another appropriate 
healt hcare prof essio nal for further evaluat ion.

Males will be advised to use a latex condo m during any  sexual  contact [CONTACT_780434] [ADDRESS_1072797] dose of luspatercept , even if he has undergone 
a successful vasectomy .
10.6. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Any AE that meets any criterion for an SAE requires the complet ion of an SAE Report Form in 
addition to being recorded on the AE page/screen of the eCRF .  All SAEs must be reported to 
Celgene Drug Safet y and Medical Monitor within [ADDRESS_1072798] igator’s knowledge of 
the event by  [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method ( eg, via email), using the SAE Report Form, 
or approved equivalent form.  This instruction pertains to init ial SAE reports as well as any  
follow-up reports.
The Investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms are accurate and consistent.   
This requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relat ionship to luspatercept ) that occur during 
the study  (from the time the subject signs informed consent until [ADDRESS_1072799] dose of 
luspatercept) or any  SAE m ade known to the Investigator at any time thereafter that are 
suspected of being related to luspatercept .  Seri ous adverse events occurring prior to treatment 
(after signing the ICF) will be captured.
The SAE report sho uld provide a detailed descript ion of the SAE and include a concise summary

15.1. Study Monitoring and Source Data Verification
Celgene ensures that appropriate monitoring procedures are performed before, during and after 
the study .  All aspects of the study  are reviewed with the Inves tigator and the staff at a study  
initiation visit and/or at an Invest igators’ Meeting.  Prior to enrolling subjects into the study, a 
Celgene representati ve will review the protocol, eCRF s, procedures for ob taining informed 
consent, record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and rep orting of AEs/SAEs with the Invest igator.  Monitoring will 
include on -site visi ts with the Investi gator and his/her staff as well as any  appropri ate 
communicat ions by [CONTACT_2319], email, fax, or telephone.  During mo nitoring visits, the facilit ies, 
investigat ional product storage area, eCRF s, subject’s source documents, and all other study  
docum entati on will be inspected/reviewed by  [CONTACT_348957] h the 
Study  Moni toring Pl an.
Accuracy  will be checked by [CONTACT_81706] i s a di rect com parison of 
the entries made onto the eCRF s against the appropriate source documentation.  Any  resul ting 
discrepancies will be reviewed with the Investigator and/or his/her staff.  Any necessary 
correcti ons will be made direct ly to t he eCRF s or via queries by [CONTACT_81707]/or his/her 
staff. Monitoring procedures require that informed consents, adherence to inclusio n/exclusion 
criteria and docum entati on of  SAEs and their proper recording be verified.  Addit ional 
monitoring act ivities may be outlined in a study -specific m onitoring pl an.
15.2. Audits and Inspections
In addit ion to the routine monitoring procedures, a Good Clinical Pract ice Qualit y Assurance 
unit exists wit hin Celgene.  Representatives of this unit will conduct audi ts of clinical research 
activit ies in accordance with Cel gene SOPs to evaluate compliance wit h Good Clinical Pract ice 
guidelines and regulations.
The Investigator is required to permit direct access to the facilit ies where the study  took place, 
source documents, eCRF s and applicable supporting records of study  subject parti cipat ion for 
audits and inspect ions by [CONTACT_1744]/ ECs, regul atory  authori ties (eg, FDA, EMA, Healt h Canada) and 
company authorized representatives.  The Invest igator shoul d make every  effort to be available 
for the audi ts and/or inspect ions.  If the Investigator is contact[CONTACT_414495], he/she shou ld contact [CONTACT_27740].

demonstrate clinical benefit while on study  treatmen t in the absence of any  significant safet y 
signals.  To enable long -term access to l uspatercept therapy  (provi ded subjects continue to 
demonstrate clinical benefit as assessed by  [CONTACT_780445] m eet any protocol  
treatm ent discont inuat ion criteria), the Extensio n Phase has been extended beyo nd 2years.
Significant changes included in this amendment are summarized below:
Prolongation of Extension Phase of the Treatment Period The primary purpose of 
this protocol  amendment is to amend the 2-year study  treatm ent limit for subjects in 
the Extensio n Phase of the Treatment Period to extend beyo nd 2years for those that
continue to receive benefit according to investigator assessment (eg, ≥ 50 % reducti on
of transfusio n burden from baseline) .Revised sections: Protocol Summary , Secti on
3.1, Secti on3.2, Section 6.2.2, Section 6.2.3 , and Secti on9.2The amendment also 
includes several other minor clarifications and corrections: Correction of 
Column Header and diagram text for Figure 2 in Section 3.1: w ording added to 
indicate Treatment Period may  extend past 2years fro m C1D1 date. Clarification 
made to Section 9.2 :text that ment ioned that subjects who are not efficacy evaluable 
will be scored as nonresponders wasremoved . Clarification made to Section 10: 
Removed and consolidated Section 10.6 “Other Malignancies/Premalignancies” with
Secti on 10.3 “Adverse Events of Special Interest” as these sect ions contained 
duplicate informat ionpertaining to “Other Malignancies/Premalignancies .”Added 
Sectio n 15.3 : provided contact [CONTACT_780446] y complaints for drug 
products m anufactured by  [CONTACT_780447] (ie, spelling, grammat ical error corrections, etc.) were also made throughout

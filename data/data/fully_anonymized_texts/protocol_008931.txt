Primary  Objective  
To evaluate the effect of OCA treatment on time to the first occurrence of the composite endpoint of all -cause death, 
liver transplant, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_610013] 2 data sources: Global PBC 
registry and Komodo Health c laims database . 
Exploratory  Objectives :  
To evaluate the effect of OCA treatment on time to the first occurrence of individual components of the composite 
endpoint  (outlined below) : 
• All-cause death  
• Liver transplant  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_610014]:  
o Variceal bleed  
o Ascites (including hepatic hydrothorax and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis)  
o Hepatic encephalopathy   
Methodology:  
These are  replicate , observational, retrospective cohort stud ies of patients with PBC who failed ursodeoxycholic 
acid ( UDCA ) treatment using 2 real-world data sources:   the Global PBC registry  (Study 747-404) and the Komodo 
Health [LOCATION_002] ( US) claims database  (Study 747-405).  All analyses will be con ducted separately by [CONTACT_610056] ( ie, not pooled).  The primary endpoint  is time to first occurrence of all -cause death, liver transplant, or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_610015] .  The anal ytic approach is a nested target trial emulation design .

Confidential and ProprietaryThe Komodo Health database contains administrative claims from >350 US payers ,including commercial (63%); 
Medicaid (23%); Medicare (10%); dual eligible (<1%); and other (2%). Data are tokenized to allow for patient 
tracking across payers. Komodo Health claims will be linked through Datavant tokenization to Quest Diagnostics
and LabCorp laboratory data, the US National Death Index (NDI), and the Organ Transplant Network (OPTN) 
transplant registry for additional information and outcome verification . The database contains >100,000 patients 
with a PBC diagnostic code. The Global PBC registry includes >5,000 patients with PBC recruited from 17 liver 
centers across 8 countries in Europe and North America. It utiliz esthe CASTOR trial platform forelectronic case 
report form ( eCRF ) collection of medical history, clinical events, andlaboratory and treatment data.
All patients who meet diagnostic criteria for PBC in each database between 01 Jun 2015 and 31 Dec 2021 and who 
meet alleligibility criteria will be considered for these studies. The OCA treatment evaluation period will be from 
01 Jun 2016 (based on first country approval by [CONTACT_610057] 27 May 2016). The Komodo 
Health database is US-specific and the Global PBC registry includes the US a ndmultiple other countries with later
approval dates. The Sponsor has applied the date of first global approval of [ADDRESS_808953] 
date of prescription of OCA after inadequate UDCA response ( ALP>upper limit of normal [ULN] and/or total 
bilirubin [TB]>ULN after >270 days of treatment) or UDCA intolerance (discontinued UDCA after <90 daysdespi[INVESTIGATOR_610016]>ULN and/or TB>ULN) will be defined as the index date for OCA- treated PBC patients. The dates of 
evidence of inadequate UDCA response or UDCA intolerance during which OCA is not utilized will be used as an
index date for the non –OCA -treated comparator group. 
Each time a patient meets the UDCA inadequate response/intolerance definition or the definition of OCA initiation,
in addition to all other eligibility criteria, they will contribute an index to the study . Therefore, patients may 
contribute multiple control indices, and may contribute control indices before OCA initiation , but can contribute 
only one OCA initiation index. The non –OCA-treated patient indices will be weighted to have the same baseline 
covariate distribution as the OCA-treated patients at the time of OCA initiation , thus allowing for the estimation of 
the effect of treatment in the treated patients. The pre-index period is defined as [ADDRESS_808954] occurrence of any component of the composite endpoint. Patients will be censored at 
dropout/disenrollment from the database, discontinuation of OCA (+90 days), initiation of fenofibrate or bezafibrate, 
initiation of OCA (for the non –OCA-treated patient -indices), unapproved OCA dose (>10 mg once daily [ QD]) for 
those treated with OCA , or the end of the study period (31 Dec 2021) ,whichever comes first.

Number of Patients (planned):
Komodo Health :  In the current Komodo Health database, there are 395 patients who meet all of the following
criteria for the OCA treatment group:
•Meet PBC claims diagnostic criteria (1 inpatient or 2 outpatient claims)
•Have evidence of UDCA failure
•Have i nitiate dOCA treatment

Protocol 747 -404/40 5 Version 1.0:  24Jan2022   
Page 7 
 
Confidential and Proprietary  There are 5916 patients who meet all of the following criteria for the control group (OCA -eligible  but not currently 
OCA -treated)  
• Meet PBC claims diagnostic criteria (1 inpatient or 2 outpatient claims)  
• Have at least 270 days of UDCA use before elevated ALP and/or TB inclusive of up to 4  instances of elevation 
(inadequate  response) o r <90 days UDCA use despi[INVESTIGATOR_610017]/or bilirubin (intolerant)  
• Have elevate d ALP >ULN and/or TB >ULN  
 
The Komodo Health database  has not yet been linked to LabCorp laboratory data base.  It is anticipated that the 
number of patients in each group will approximately double with the availability of LabCorp data.  
Global PBC registry :  The Global PBC registry data are currently being refreshed.  A previous analysis identified 
344 patients who had initiated OCA.  Among the >5000 patients not treated with OCA, it is anticipated that >2200 
will meet criteria for UDCA failure and for inclusion in the control group (Corpechot  2008 , Kumagi  2010 ). 
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion:  
The treatment group will be patients  with PBC  with a history of inadequate response or intoleran ce to UDCA  who 
initiated OCA in the study window.  The control group will be PBC patients with a history of inadequ ate response  or 
intolerance to  UDCA who were  eligible but not treated with OCA (or off -label fibrates) in the study window.

• Cirrhosis  
• Most recent Charlson Comorbidity Index Score  
• Insurance type at index date ( Komodo Health  only)  
Statistical Methods:  
Analysis Populations    
The statistical analysis of the HEROES  PBC  studies will follow a nested randomized trial emulation approach 
(Hernán  2008 , Danaei  2013 ) using a treatment decision design to identify index events ( Brookhart 2015 ).  Due to 
the lack of randomization, non -randomized observational stud ies will instead be conducted, with the goa l of 
mimicking the hypothetical randomized trial as closely as possible.   All patients will be evaluated over time  from the 
start of the study period to identify evidence of inadequate  treatment response to UDCA.  Each date of inadequate  
response identified in the data will be considered a treatment decision point, and that date will be considered an 
index date, with a corresponding record created in the analytic data for that patient  index.  Each patient can 
contribute multiple index dat es and thus patient  indices, corresponding to each date they have a treatment decision 
point, and therefore each patient may contribute person -time to multiple patient  index records.   
It is likely that OCA -treated and non –OCA -treated patient  indices will differ on confounding variables, ie,  variables 
that influence both treatment and outcome.  To address differences in the covariate distribution between treatment 
groups, the Sponsor  will first conduct descriptive analyses on all baseline varia bles (demographics, clinical 
characteristics, and treatment history) for the OCA -treated and non –OCA -treated group s at index.  Standardized 
mortality/morbidity ratio (SMR) weights then will be used to create a pseudo -population of non –OCA -treated 
indices w ith the same covariate distribution as the OCA -treated patients at the time of OCA initiation ( Sato 2003 ), 
and unweighted and weighted standardized mean differences will be computed.   
Primary Analysis:  
The objective of the primary  analysis is to estimate the as-treated effect of OCA treatment versus non –OCA -based 
treatment on the composite endpoint of all -cause death, liver transplant, or decompensation re quiring 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  The primary analysis outcome will be assessed with the hazard ratio comparing the hazard of the  
first event of the composite endpoint  among  the OCA -treated patients and standardized morbidity ratio -weighted 
Protocol 747 -404/40 5 Version 1.0:  24Jan2022   
Page 10 
 
Confidential and Proprietary  non–OCA -treated PBC patient  indices .  The hazard ratio will be estimated  using a Cox proportional hazards model.  
The nonparametric bootstrap will be used to estimate the standard error of the estimate , which will then be used to 
generate 95% CI for the hazard ratio and to perform a test of the hypothesis that the hazard ratio is equal to the null 
value of 1.  
Exploratory Analysis:  
The exploratory objectives are to estimate the effect of OCA treatment versus non -OCA treatment on each 
component of the composite endpoint (all -cause death, liver transplant, or hepatic decompensation).  The 
exploratory  analysis outcome s will be assessed with the subdistribution hazard ratio comparing the hazard of the  
first event of each element of the  composite endpoint , separately,  among  the OCA -treated patients and standardized 
morbidity ratio -weighted non –OCA -treated PBC patient  indices.  For the endpoint of liver transplant, d eath will be 
treated as a competing event.  For the endpoint of hepatic decompensation, death and liver transpl ant will  be treated 
as comp eting events.  The subdistribution hazard ratio will be estimated  using a Fine-Gray  proportional  
subdistri bution  hazards model.  The nonparametric bootstrap will be used to estimate the standard error of  the 
estimate s, which will  then be used to calculate 95% CI for the hazard ratio and perform a test of the hypo thesis that 
the haza rd ratio is equal to the null value of 1.  
Sample Size Justification:   
Using the  expected  sample size in the [ADDRESS_808958] treatment e ffects 
(relative hazards) of varying sizes, estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression.  Computations ar e based on 
the formulae of Schoenfeld  [ADDRESS_808959] to the control group (UDCA nonresponders).  In the Global PBC registry, the Sponsor 
expect s to have [ADDRESS_808960] one 
observation to the control group.  Power in both cohorts was computed for relative hazards ranging from 0.5 t o 0.9 
with an alpha level of 0.05.  The Sponsor  considered baseline e vent rates during follow -up from 5% to 15% a nd 
variance inflation corresponding to mild confounding (VIF=1.05), moderate confounding (VIF=1.5), and stron g 
confounding (VIF=2.0).  In each study, power was plotted under these assumptions against a reference line of 80% 
power under moderate confounding (VIF=1.5).  
Under mild confounding, both studies will be well -powered to detect a n HR of 0.5.  For moderate confounding, the 
Komodo Health study will be adequately powered to detect HR of 0.5 for event rates >6%.   The Global PBC 
registry will be adequately powered to detect event rates >8%.  Under strong confounding, the Komodo Health 
study will be adequately powered to detect HR of 0.5 for event rates >9%.  The Global PBC registry will be 
adequately powered to de tect event rates >11%.  Power decreases for more moderate HRs.  None of the studies 
under even the most favorable assumptions will be able to detect HRs of 0.9.  The Sponsor  notes that the 
assumptions made here are conservative; in particular, it is expect ed that  many more than one control observation 
and that the addition of lab data from LabCorp to will substantially increase the size of both treatment groups in the 
Komodo Health study.  
Subgroup Analyses:  
The entire  analysis will be repeated separately by [CONTACT_185934]  (Komodo Health  only), age (categorical), sex, region, 
presence/absence of cirrhosis, and pre-/post -COVID.   Because race is not completely captured in  either database , 
these analyses will only include th ose with non-missing values for race . 
 
Sensitivity Analyses:  
• An analysis will be conducted in the Komodo database to assess the performance of a claims-based PBC 
definition with AMA  test results as the gold standard.  
• Quantitative bias analysis  to quantify the sensitivity of the estimate to violations of the assumption of no 
unmeasured confounding.

Confidential and Proprietary  4. INTRODUCTION  
4.1. Overview of Disease State  and OCA  
Primary biliary cholangitis, (PBC) is a serious, life -threatening, cholestatic liver disease of 
unknown  etiology that, without treatment, frequently progresses to hepatic fibrosis and eventual 
cirrhosis  or hepatic decompensation and n ecessitates liver transplantation or results in deat h.  
PBC is a rare  disease with  a reported prevalence in the [LOCATION_002] (US) of 40/100 ,000 
(Kim 2000 ).  PBC  disproportionately affects women (with a female to male ratio of 
approximately 10:1 ) and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_610020]  40 to 60 years.  
The only approved drug therapy for PBC h as been the bile acid ursodeoxycholic  acid (UDC A), a 
physiological constituent of human bile ( Lindor  2009 ).  While UDCA therapy  had a marked 
effect on the treatment of PBC, up to 40% of patients showed a suboptimal  response or no 
response to UDCA  (Corpechot  2008 , Kumagi  2010 ).  Such patients were at significantly 
increased risk of a poor  clinical outcome due to PBC disease progression.   Obeticholic acid 
(OCA)  is a farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist and a modified bile acid that is derived  from the 
primary bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), the natural human FXR ligand .  OCA 
(Ocaliva) has received marketing authorization in the US, the European Union (EU) , and 
several other countries for the treatment of PBC in combination with UDCA in adults wit h an 
inadequate response to UDCA or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA.  In the US, 
Ocaliva  is contraindicated in patients  with decompensated cirrhosis (eg, Child -Pugh Class  B or 
C), a prior decompensation event, complete biliary obstruction , or compensated cirrhosis with 
evidence of portal hypertension.   Approval in the US and the EU was based on a surrogate 
endpoint (reduction in ALP) , and as part of re gulatory commitments in these regions, the 
following post marketing  studies were initiated:  Study 747-302, a Phase 3b/4 study designed to 
prospectively obtain evidence to confirm clinical benefit in PBC subjects , and Study 747-401, a 
Phase  4 study designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of OCA in PBC 
subjects with hepatic impairment .  Both 747-302 and 747 -401 terminated early , due to the 
challenges  of recruit ment  and long -term retention of patients with a rare disease  subsequent to 
Ocaliva regulatory  approval.  Changes to endpoints and statistical analysis plans to accommodate 
low recruitment, l ow event s rates , and early termination may necessitate the need for clinical trial 
data to be supplemented with real -world evidence , with the goal of  providing regulators with a 
more complete evidence package characterizing the efficacy and safety of OCA in patients with 
PBC.   
4.2. Mechanism of Action of OCA  
OCA is a 6α -ethyl derivative of the naturally occurring primary human bile acid CDCA, which is  
the endogenous ligand for FXR.  FXR is a ligand -dependent transcription factor that is part of  
the nuclear receptor superfamily.  FXR regulates a wide variety of target genes involved in the  
control of bile acid, lipid, and glucose homeostasis and in the regulation of immune responses.   
OCA’s potent FXR agonist effects are believed to account for th e predominant efficacy of the  
investigational product.  Some of the pharmacological properties of OCA and other FXR  
agonists that have been elucidated in animal models of chronic liver disease relevant to the  
treatment of PBC include the following:

• Prevention and reversal of hepatic fibrosis  
The key mechanisms of action of OCA, including its choleretic, anti -inflammatory, and  
anti-fibrotic properties, underlie its hepatoprotective effe cts and result in attenuation of injury 
and improved liver function in a cholestatic liver disease , such as PBC . 
4.3. Nonclinical Experience with OCA  
Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the Sponsor) has completed a standard battery of nonclinical  
safety pharmacology and toxicology studies.  No major nonclinical safety effects have been seen  
other than pharmacologic hepatic effects observed at high doses.  These pharmacologic hepatic  
effects are consistent with the detergent effects of a bile acid a t exceedingly high hepatocellular  
exposure.   
4.4. Clinical Experience with Obeticholic Acid  
As of [ADDRESS_808968] received ≥1 dose of OCA .  This 
estimation includes subjects from blinded ongoing studies.  Of these subjects, 978 wer e healthy 
volunteers, 610 subjects had PBC, 72 subjects had primary sclerosing cholangitis , 7 subjects had 
biliary atresia, 41  subjects had diabetes mellitus with non -alcoholic fatty liver disease, 
2697  subjects had nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH ), and  33 subjects had portal hypertension 
due to alcoholic cirrhosis.  
As of 03 May 2021, the clinical pharmacology of OCA ha d been evaluated in 19 completed 
Phase  1 studies.  Overall, the PK of OCA shows the profile expected of a natural bile acid.  
There is rapid absorption of unconjugated OCA (parent), followed by [CONTACT_610061] -OCA and tauro -OCA, respectively.  Glyco -OCA and 
tauro -OCA occur at significantly higher concentrations than the parent drug  does.  There are 
numerous peak and trough plasma concentrations observed , consistent with the expected 
extensive enterohepatic circulation of a bile acid.  Plasma concentrations dramatically increase 
shortly after food intake, consistent with  the gall bladder e mptying into the duodenum.  The 
glyco -OCA and tauro -OCA conjugates of OCA are known to be pharmacologically active, and 
due to enterohepatic recycling of OCA and its conjugates , their plasma PK profiles are most 
relevant .  
Data that supported approval of O caliva included 3  randomized, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled , multi -center, international studies in subjects with PBC:   
• Study 747 -201 was a Phase 2, 3 -month, international, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
parallel -group study in subjects with a prove n or likely diagnosis of PBC who se disease was  
sub-optimally controlled.  In this study, OCA doses of 10  mg and 50  mg were evaluated as 
monotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

Confidential and Proprietary  • Study 747 -301(POISE)  was the pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3, 12 -month, international, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled study in subjects with a proven or likely diagnosis of PBC who se disease 
was sub-optimally controlled.  In this study, OCA doses evaluated were 10 mg or a titration 
approach (ie, [ADDRESS_808970] did not meet the primary composite endpoint and had no tolerability issues).   
In the double -blind, Phase 2 Studies 747 -201 and 747 -202, treatment with OCA for 3 months in 
subje cts with PBC resulted in statistically and clinically significant reductions in ALP, a known 
surrogate for risk of long -term clinical outcomes in PBC, as well as markers of hepatic damage 
and inflammation.  Consistent efficacy results were observed irrespe ctive of whether OCA was 
administered as monotherapy or as an add-on to UDCA.  Within each study, OCA doses above 
10 mg did not show substantially better efficacy compared with OCA 10  mg, but the incidence 
and severity of pruritus were  increased, suggesting that 10  mg was the maximally efficacious 
dose and that evaluation of lower do ses in the Phase 3 program was warranted.   
The Phase 3 study met its primary endpoint.  Both OCA treatment groups (OCA titration and 
OCA 10 mg) were superior to placebo in achieving the primary endpoint at all timepoints across 
the 12 -month treatment peri od (p<0.0001 versus placebo).  
Each of these 3 studies included open -label, uncontrolled, long-term safety extension ( LTSE ) 
phases to evaluate the long -term effects of OCA treatment.  As of 03 May 2021, the LTSEs of 
Studies 747 -201, 747 -202, and 747 -301 are  completed.   
Study 747 -301 LTSE :  A total of 217 subjects were enrolled into the double -blind phase of the 
study; of the 198 subjects who completed the double -blind phase, 193 subjects (9 8%) enrolled 
into the LTSE phase.  Overall , there was good retention in the study:  146 (76%) subjects 
completed the protocol as specified after administrative termination/closure of the study, and 
47 (24%) subjects discontinued the LTSE prematurely.  The majority of subjects discontinued 
because of  study closure by [CONTACT_37925].  The efficacy associated with continued treatment with 
OCA up to 6 years was durable and consistent with the effects observed in the double -blind 
phase.   
An additional 8 -week, open -label study was also supportive of Ocaliva approval; however, 
efficacy data from this study were  not integrated with Studies 747 -201, 747 -202, and 747 -301 
because of  differences in study design and endpoints:  
• Study 747 -205 assess ed the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynami c (PD) effects of

4.5.2. Rationale for Dose 
The Ocaliva presc ribing info1matio n states that the approved dosing is 5 mg once daily (QD) 
with allowable up-titr·ation to a maximal dose of 10 mg QD. Patients prescribed OCA will be 
censored if they exceed the maximal allowab le daily dose . Down-titration (less than daily 
dosing) can be utilized in response to adverse events such as prnritus, and as such, patients dosed 
<5 mg QD will continue to be counted in the OCA -u-eated aim. 
4.5.3. Rationale for Control Group 
Using standai ·dized eligibi lity criteria across tr·eated and untr·eated patients and uti lizing a 
standai·dized morb idity ratio-weighted-OCA eligible but non-OCA -tr·eated compai·ato r group 
will provide the best scientific compai·at ive evidence of efficacy .

received ≥1 dose of OCA in completed (Studies  747-201 Double -Blind [DB], 747-201 LTSE, 
747-202 DB, 747 -202 LTSE, 747 -205 Primary Treatment Phase , 747 -301 DB , and 747-301
LTSE), ongoing unblinded (Study 747 -205 LTSE) , or blinded (Studies 747 -302 and 747 -401)
studies.
In the completed studies , the majority of subjects had at least 5 years of exposure to OCA , and a 
small subset were exposed for more than 7 years.  A total of 421 (97%) of these subjects who 
received OCA experienced  treatment -emergent adverse event s (TEAEs ) during the study , and 
379 (88%) subjects experienced investigational product –related TEAE s.  Although the rate of 
TEAEs was higher in OCA -treated subjects compared with placebo -treated subjects, the 
differences noted in these incidence rates may be at least partially due to cumulative exposure 
differences between OCA and placebo.  The most fre quently reported TEAEs by [CONTACT_610064] 
(84%), gastrointestinal disorders (62%), and infections and infestations (56%) .  The most 
frequently reported (≥20% of su bjects) individual TEAEs were pruritus (80%) and fatigue 
(26%).   
While studies were ongoing,  the data monitoring committee ( DMC ) convene d at least every 
[ADDRESS_808973] rate.  They also noted that it did not seem feasible to continue the study as 
designed.  On 18 Dec 2020, the DMC reviewed a planned in -depth analysis of unblinded safety 
data from Studies 747 -302 and 747 -401.  Enrollment and retention were particularly poor in 
Study 747 -302 in subjects with decompensated cirrhosis at baseline.  Poor retention was also 
observed in Study 747 -401, which is exclusively focused on subjects  with CP -B and CP-C 
cirrhosis at baseline.  The DMC noted  a high likelihood of futility and difficulty in differentiating 
the etiology of hepatic safety events (OCA -related or progression of underlying disease).  No 
safety concerns were raised by [CONTACT_610065].  T he DMC recommended stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_610023] 747 -302 and 747 -401 and discussing the unblinding of both studies 
with regulators .  On 17 Feb 2021, the DMC recommended that both studies  continue with 
modification.  Due to the high likelihood of futility, the DMC recommended no further 
enrollment in the studies.   On 09 Jun 2021, no additional modifications to the study were 
recommended.  The DMC’s previous recommendations remained unchang ed (ie, continue 
discussion with regulatory authorities regarding unblinding).  Following  the [LOCATION_002]

4.6.2.  Known and Potential Risks of OCA 
The risk profile of OCA use in PBC has been evaluated in clinical trials and observational 
studies, as well as from postmarketing experience  (estimated cumulative patient exposure from 
marketing experience is  20,554 patient -years ).  The key risk for OCA is pruritus.  Potential risks 
Protocol 747 -404/40 5 Version 1.0:  24Jan2022   
Page [ADDRESS_808975] of these current studies.  
Additional  information is available in the Investigator ’s Brochure.  
Pruritus :  In subjects with PBC, the most commonly reported TEAE across all treatment groups 
was pruritus, which is a frequent symptom experienced by [CONTACT_610066]. 
The in cidence of pruritus was higher in the OCA -treated subjects as compared with 
placebo -treated subjects.  In a small proportion of patients, pruritus can be severe and 
significantly interfere with sleep and patient functioning.  Patients with a history of pru ritus as 
part of the underlying disease have a higher probability of pruritus with OCA treatment.  
Otherwise, the occurrence and severity of pruritus in an individual patient treated with OCA 
cannot be reliably predicted or prevented, in part because pruri tus is a frequent clinical feature of 
the underlying disease.  Pruritus has also been seen in patients participating in clinical trials of 
investigational use of OCA, including NASH, where pruritus is not a common symptom of the 
disease state.  Pruritus is  generally clinically manageable.  Reducing OCA dose or transient  dose 
or transient treatment interruption helps alleviate , and in some cases , even resolves it.    
Liver Injury :  Liver injury is an important potential risk for OCA.  Risk factors for  drug -induced 
adverse hepatic effects are in general poorly understood in patients with chronic liver d isease.  
Pre-existing liver disease may not increase the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_21395] -induced l iver injury 
(Chalasani  2014 ).  In the US, OCA is contraindicated in adult patients with PBC with 
decompensated cirrhosis or a prior decompensation event and with compensated cirrh osis with 
clinical evidence of port al hypertension.  OCA is also contraindicated in adult pa tients with PBC 
with complete biliary obstruction.  
In two 3 -month, placebo -controlled studies in subjects with PBC, a dose -response was  observed 
for the occurrence of liver -related adverse reactions including jaundice, worsening ascit es, and 
PBC flare with dosages of OCA 10 mg to 50 mg once daily (up to [ADDRESS_808976]  
recommended dosage in PBC).  In a pooled analysis of 3 placebo -controlled stud ies in subjects 
with PBC, the exposure -adjusted inci dence rates for all serious and otherwise clini cally 
significant liver -related adverse reactions and isolated elevations in liver biochem ical tests, per 
100 patient years of exposure were:  5.2 in the OCA 10 mg group, 19.8 in the OC A 25 mg group, 
and 54.5 in the OCA 50 mg group compared to 2.4 in the placebo group.  
Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Events Secondary to Changes in Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] :  This risk has been 
recognized as an important potential risk since OCA is associated with lipid profile changes, 
regardless of background disease state.   Patients with PBC generally exhibit hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_610024] a significant elevation in total cholesterol.  A reduction in mean high -density 
lipoprotein and an increase in low -density lipoprotein with OCA treatment ha ve been observed 
in patients with PBC.  It is unknown whether these changes in lipi[INVESTIGATOR_610025] (CVD) and 
associated morbidity and mortality in PBC patients, whe n compared with the general population. 
The lipid abnormalities may be managed in PBC patients receiving OCA, by [CONTACT_610067].

of the composite endpoint  (outlined below) : 
•All-cause death
•Liver transplant
•Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_610027]:
−Variceal bleed
−Ascites (including hepatic hydrothorax and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis)
−Hepatic encephalopathy
6. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
6.1. Overall Design
These are replicate , observational, retrospective cohort studies of patients with PBC who failed 
UDCA treatment using 2 real-world data sources:  the Global PBC registry ( Study 747-404) and 
the Komodo Health US claims database ( Study 747-405).   All analyses will be conducted 
separately by [CONTACT_311469] (ie, not pooled).  The Komodo Health database will be linked for 
outcome verification and additional data collection through Datavant tokenization to Quest 
Diagnostics , LabCorp, the NDI, and the Organ Transplant Network  (OPTN ) registry.  
All patients who meet diagnostic criteria for PBC  in each database between 01 Jun 2015 and 
31 Dec 2021 and who meet the eligibility criteria (Section  7.2 and Section  7.3) will be 
considered for th ese studies .  See Figure  1 for the design schematic .  The OCA t reatment 
evaluation period will be from 01 Jun 2016 (based on first country approval by [CONTACT_3955] 
27 May 2016) .  The Komodo Health database is US -specific , while the Global PBC  registry  
includes multiple countries with a range of  approval dates .  The Sponsor has  applied the d ate of 
first approval of a participating country , and thus [ADDRESS_808977] date of prescription of OCA after failing UDCA treat ment will be defined as the index date 
for OCA -treated PBC patients.  The date of evidence of inadequate UDCA response or UDCA 
intolerance, as defined in Section  7.1, will be used as an index date for the non –OCA -treated 
comparator group.  Each time a patient meets the UDCA inadequate response/intolerance

contribute an index to the study. Therefore, patients may contribute multiple control indices, and 
may contribute control indices before OCA initiation, but can contribute only one OCA initiation 
index.  The non–OCA-treated patient indices will be weighted to have the same baseline 
covariate distribution as the OCA-treated patients at the time of OCA initiation, thus allowing for 
the estimation of the effect of treatment in the treated. Patients must have 12 months of data 
preceding the index date (ie, the pre-index period) to establish the medical history and OCA 
eligibility and for the standardized morbidity ratio-weighting . Follow-up of patients will be until 
the first occurrence of the composite endpoint. Patients will be censored at drop 
out/disenrollment from the database, discontinuation of OCA (+90 days), initiation of fenofibrate 
or bezafibrate, initiation of OCA (for the non–OCA-treated patient indices), unapproved OCA 
dose (>10 mg QD) for those treated with OCA, or the end of the study period (31 Dec 2021); 
whichever comes first.

7. SELECTION OF PATIENT S
7.1. Study  Population
All pa tients who meet diagnostic criteria in each database between 01 Jun 2015 and 31  Dec 2021 
and who meet the eligibility criteria will be considered for these studies .  
All diagnosis, treatment,  laboratory , and procedure codes used to identify patients a nd define 
study variables are listed in Appendix  A.  
The tr eatment group will be patients with PBC with a history of inadequate response o r 
intolerance to UDCA who initiated OCA in the study window .  The control group will be PBC 
patients with a history of inadequate response  or intolerance to  UDCA who were  eligible but  
were  not treated with OCA (or off -label fibrates) in the study window.  The decision to t reat a 
patient with OCA or U DCA is at the discretion of the treating physician and has been made 
independent from inclusion  in each of the databases.  
7.1.1.  Definition of UDCA Fa ilure  
UDCA failure includes both inadequate response to UDCA, and intolerance to UDCA. 
Inadequate UDCA response is defined as:  
Protocol 747 -404/40 5 Version 1.0:  24Jan2022   
Page 25 
Confidential and Proprietary  •At least 1 measure of ALP and/or TB >ULN ; and
•>270 days of UDCA treatment prior to ALP and/or TB elevation
UDCA intolerance is defined as:  
•A maximum of 90 days of UDCA use with ALP>ULN and/or TB >ULN .
The first date of prescription of OCA after inadequate UDCA response (ALP>upper limit of 
normal [ULN] and/or total bilirubin [TB]>ULN after >270 days of treatment) or UDCA 
intolerance (discontinued UDCA after <90 days despi[INVESTIGATOR_610016]>ULN and/or TB>ULN) will be 
defined as the index date for OCA -treated PBC patients.  The date s of evidence of inadequate 
UDCA response or UDCA intolerance during  which OCA  is not u tilized  will be used as index 
dates for the non –OCA -treated comparator group.   
7.2. Inclusion Criteria

Section  10.1.[ADDRESS_808982] being studied  is obeticholic acid, in tablet form , dosed at 5 mg to 10 mg  once daily 
oral administration. The study drug is not pr ovided nor administered by [CONTACT_610068].  The total duration of exposure will 
range from 1 to 67 months.  
7.6. Study Period  
The total study period is estimated to be a maximum of 6. 6 years based on a pre-index period of 
12 months prior to the index date and a maximum follow -up period of 5. 6 years after the index 
date.  The OCA treatment evaluation period will be from 01 Jun 2016 (based on FDA approval 
on 27 May 2016) to [ADDRESS_808983] date of prescription of OCA after failing UDCA 
treatment will be defined as the index date for OCA -treated PBC patients.  The date of evidence 
of inadequate UDCA response or UDCA intolerance, as defined below, will be used as the index 
date for the non –OCA -treated comparator group.  Each time a patient meets the UDCA 
inadequate response/intolerance definition or the definition of OCA initiation, as well as all other 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, they will contribute an index to the study.  Therefore, patient s may 
contribute multiple indices and may appear in both groups, though they may contribute at most 
one index to the OCA -treated group.  
8. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY
8.1. Primary Outcomes/Endpoints  
The selection of a composite primary endpoint was informed by [CONTACT_610069] 747-301 (POISE) and 747 -302 (COBALT) studies  (see Table  1).  For COBALT, 
the primary composite endpoint included all -cause death , liver transplant , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_610018] (bleeding varices and hepatic encephalopathy) , uncontrolled ascites , and 
Model for End -Stage Liver Disease  (MELD ) Score >15.  Of these endpoints, only MELD cannot 
be ade quately assessed in the current databases.   The MELD algorithm includes a measure of the 
international normalized ratio ( INR).  A review of the Komodo Health and the Global PBC  
registry  databases revealed that, unlike hepatic laboratory measures such as AL P and TB, INR is 
not ro utinely collected  in PBC patients .  Therefore, the Sponsor did not include MELD >[ADDRESS_808984] twice in a month.  In a study of the 
POISE LTSE  with external controls  (Perez  2021 ), the Sponsor  modified this endpoint to be 
consistent with other decompensating events , ie, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_610028] .  As the FDA 
Guidance on Rea l-world Data  (US Food and Drug Administration  2021 ) states, “…outpatient 
data sources that do not include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_610029] .”  To increase consistency in the measure s of

Confidential and Proprietary  hepatic decompensating events, the Sponsor has  included ascites (including hepatic hydrothorax 
and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) , along with variceal bleeding and hepatic encephalopathy , 
as part of the “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_610015]” endpoint.

will be assessed as date of first  filled prescription and quantified as days suppl y. Discontinuation 
will be assessed by a gap of >[ADDRESS_808986] physician reported

67 months.  
9. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY
The objective of these replicate  observational Real-world Data studies is to evaluate t he effective 
of OCA on hepatic outcomes in patients with  PBC .  All patients are de -identified  in the data 
sources.  These studies are  not designed to assess safety , and there are no pre -specified safety 
analyses.  Study outcome variables collected for the 2 cohorts will be presented for analyses as 
aggregate data groups.  The data sources will not be searched for indivi dual patient adverse 
events ; however, if an Investigator or Sponsor identifies adverse event s that meet postmarketing 
reporting requirements during the course of conducting these  studies, such events will be 
reported in accordance with applicable postmarketing reporting requirements.  
10. STATISTIC AL METHODS
10.1. Analysis Populations  and Blinding
10.1.1.  Analysis Populations
The statistical analysis of the HEROES  PBC  studies will follow a neste d randomized trial 
emulation approach ( Hernán  2008 , Danaei  2013 ) using a treatment decis ion design to identify 
index events ( Brookhart  2015 ).  The goal of the study design is to emul ate a sequence of 
hypothetical randomized trials.  In each hypothetical trial, patients meeting  the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria who are making the decision whether to initiate OC A-based treatment are 
Protocol 747 -404/40 5 Version 1.0:  24Jan2022   
Page [ADDRESS_808987] of the end of follow -up or 
the time of the study endpoint (death, liver transplant, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_610033]).  Standard survival analysis methods  (eg, a Kaplan -Meier estimator of the 
cumulative incidence function or a Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the hazard ratio ) 
will then be used to estimate the effect of OCA on the study endpo int. 
Due to the lack of randomization, non -randomized observational studies  will instead be 
conducted, with the goal of mimicking the hypothetical randomized trial as closely as possible.  
All p atients will be evaluated over time  from the start of the stud y period to identify evidence of 
inadequate  treatment response to UDCA.   Each date of inadequate  response identified in the data 
will be considered a treatment decision point, and that date will be considered an index date, with 
a corresponding record bein g created in the analytic data for that patient  index.   Each patien t can 
contribute multiple index dates , and thus patient  indices, corresponding to each date they have a  
treatment decision point, and therefore each patient may contribute person -time to mu ltiple 
patient  index records.  
At each treatment decision point, the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed  (see 
Section s 7.2 and 7.3).  For patient  indices meeting the study criteria, all baseline covariates and  
treatment variables will be determined .  Person -time corresponding to each patient  index wil l be 
computed relative to the date of the index event.  Notably, because prior treatment with OC A is 
an exclusion criterion, a patient may contribute at most one O CA-treated patient  index event, 
though they can contribute multiple non –OCA -treated patient  index events.  
After the index date, follow -up will continue until the first of the composite outcome event 
(all-cause death, liver transplant, or hepatic decompensa tion), censoring , treatment 
discontinuation  (for patient  indices initiating OCA on the index date), OCA initiation (for patient  
indices not initiating OCA  on the index date ), or the end of the study period.  
Because treatment will not be randomized, it is likely that OCA -treated and non –OCA -treated 
patient  indices will differ on confounding variables, ie, variables that influence both treatment 
and outcome.  Therefore, a simple comparison of outcomes among the OCA -treated versus non –
OCA -treated patient  indices is likely to yield a biased estimate of the effect of OCA on the st udy 
endpoint.  To address differences in the covariate distribution between groups, the Sponsor will 
first conduct  descriptive analyses on all baseline variables ( demo graphics, clinical 
characteristics, and treatment history ) for the OCA -treated and non –OCA -treated groups at 
index .  Means, standard deviations, medians, inter-quartile ranges , and minimum s and 
maximum s will be provided for continuous variables.  Counts an d percentages will be provi ded 
for categorical variables.  Appropriate tests comparing cohorts of interest in the primary and 
exploratory analyses (eg, t --test, chi -square d test) will be used based on the distribution of t he 
measure.  
Next, standardized mortality/morbidity ratio weights will be used to create a 
“pseudo -population ” of non –OCA -treated indices with the same covariate distribution as the 
OCA -treated patients at the time of OCA initiation ( Sato 2003 ), and unweighted and weighte d 
standardized mean differences (SMDs) will be computed .  SMR weights result in an average 
effect of treatment among the treated.  They often  make more efficient use of data in a situation 
with a small treatment group compared with inverse -probability of treatment weight s.  The SMR 
weights will be estimated as : 
Protocol 747 -404/40 5 Version 1.0:  24Jan2022   
Page 31 
Confidential and Proprietary  𝑤𝑖𝑡=𝜋̂𝑖(1)
𝜋̂𝑖(𝐴𝑖), where  𝑤𝑖𝑡 is the weight for patient  index 𝑖, 𝐴𝑖 is the observed level of treatment for
patient  index 𝑖 (𝐴=1 if the patient  index is OCA -treated, 0 otherwise), 𝑋𝑖 is the vector of
confounders measured at the index time for patient  index 𝑖, and 𝜋𝑖(𝑎)=Pr(𝐴=𝑎|𝑋𝑖) is the
probability that patient  index 𝑖 receives treatment level 𝑎 conditional on their covariates.  
As the probabilities used to construct the weights are not known, they will be estimated using a 
logistic regression model.   The model will be fit using observed treatment as the outcome and 
main effect terms for each of the covariates.  Covariates (assessed in the pre -index period ) will 
include:  
•Age at index date
•Sex
•Most recent liver biochemistry levels (TB, ALP, ALT, AST)
•Most recent platelet counts
•Time (in months) since UDCA failure
•Clinical evidence of  portal hypertension  (platelets <150 ,000 and/or non -bleeding
varices)
•Cirrhosis
−Komodo  Health :  cirrhosis diagnosis with liver imaging and/or biopsy within
6 months before d iagnosis
−Global PBC  registry :  biopsy stage 4 , transient elastography ≥16.9  kPa,
radiological evidence  (nodular liver or enlargement of portal vein with
splenomegaly) , clinical features of portal hypertension  defined as platelet count
<140 000/mm³ with  persistent decrease in serum albumin ; or, TB >2x ULN , or
prothrombin time/INR > ULN ( not due to antithrombotic use)
•Most recent Charlson Comorbidity Index Score ( Glasheen  2019 )
•Insurance type at the index date ( Komodo Health  only: commercial , Medicare ,
Medicaid , dual el igible, other)
All diagnosis, procedure and  laboratory  codes used to define the control variables are listed in 
Appendix  A.  
Once the weights are constructed, a table of weighted SMD s between the groups wi ll be 
constructed to assess balance.  An absolute SMD of greater than 0.1 will indicate potentially 
problematic residual imbalance for the particular covariate.  In the case that either the model -
fitting algorithm fails to converge, or residual imbalance e xists after weighting, the study team 
will attempt to reduce model complexity or reduce imbalances by [CONTACT_610072]:  
•Adding/removing interaction terms (1st order or higher)
•Using a spline for continuous variables
•Shrinking all coefficients in the model using a penalty

Page [ADDRESS_808988] the outcom e 
(Clean Room Committee [CRC] , see Section 10.11 ).  Each decision for a set of actions will be 
tracked in a study log along with the results presented to the analysis team to inform the action. 
The final weights will be used for the main an alysis.   Results for each stage of the developed 
weights will be documented and presented as supplementary material (and decisions will be 
recorded in the study log).  
Under the identification conditions of causal consistency ( Cole  2009 , VanderWeele  2009 , 
Pearl  2010 ), (partial) conditional exchangeability ( Greenland  1986 , Sarvet  2020 ), and positivity 
(Westreich  2010 , Petersen  2012 ), the pseudo -population resulting from weighting the 
person -indices will emulate the data (at baseline) of the aforementioned hypothetical randomized 
trial.   
10.1.2.  Blinding  
To ensure that knowledge of outcomes does not influence group creation, a ll persons involv ed in  
the stud ies will be kept blind to outcomes  (death, liver transplant, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_610034]) until after the analytic groups are created  and the SMR weights are finalized .  
The event file will be kept separate from the primary data containing patient demographic, 
medical history, treatment , and laboratory data  and will  not be accessible to study personnel .  
Once the OCA -treated and non –OCA -treated datasets are created and approv ed by [CONTACT_10186], the 
CRC  will notify non –study -affiliated designee s at each site  that the event data can now be 
accessed in order to perform the effect size analysis and statistical testing.  
10.2. Estimation of Effect Size  
The causal effect of OCA -containing treat ments versus non –OCA -containing treatments on the 
study endpoints will be quantified using a hazard ratio.  The hazard ratio will be estimated using 
a weighted version of the sequential Cox proportional hazards model ( Gran  2010 ).  This 
approach entails fitting a weighted Cox proportional hazards regression to the person -index 
dataset, with weights created as previously described, treatment in cluded as a non –time-varying 
indicator of baseline treatment, and the timescale being specified as time since the index event.  
In addition to adjusting for confounding  via SMR  weighting, baseline covariates for each 
person -index will also be included in t he regression model to address possible informative 
censoring by [CONTACT_49939].  To test for heterogeneity of effects across each of the nested 
‘trials’, an interaction term between treatment and an indicator representing each trial will be 
included i n the model.  A non -significant coefficient for the interaction variables will indicate 
heterogeneity.  
In randomized trials, a common approach to address imperfect treatment adherence is to censor 
patients when they deviate from their assigned treatment, a  so-called per -protocol analysis 
(Hernán  2017 ).  An analogous approach can be used for non -randomized observational studies.  
Here, a person -index is censored when they deviate from their initial treatment.  For instance, if a 
person -index received non -OCA treatment at baseline but OCA was initiated 6 months after the 
index date, that person -index would be censored at 6 months.  Similarly, if a person -index 
received OCA at baseline but  discontinue d OCA, that person -index would be censored once the 
definition of OCA discontinuation is met , with an extensio n of 3 months after that time to allow 
Protocol 747 -404/40 5 Version 1.0:  24Jan2022   
Page [ADDRESS_808989] occurrence of all-cause death, liver transplant, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_610035].  
Two-sided hypotheses are expressed in terms of:  
•The null hypotheses (H 0) that the [ADDRESS_808990] ratio (HR) equal to 1 ; that is, at every timepoint , the instantaneous event rates
are the same for the OCA and control populations.
•The alternative hypothesis (H 1) that the [ADDRESS_808991] rates  are not the same ( 𝐻𝑅≠1).
10.4. Determination of Sample Size 
Using the sample size in the 2 populations  (Section 6.2), the Sponsor  compute d power to detect 
treatment effects (relative hazards) of varying sizes , estimated using Cox proportional hazards 
regression.  Computations are based on the formulae of Schoenfeld  [ADDRESS_808992] to the control group (UDCA nonresponders) .  In 
the Global PBC registry , the Sponsor  expect s to have [ADDRESS_808993] one observation to the control group .  Power in 
both cohorts was computed for relative hazards ranging from  0.5 to 0.9 with an alpha level of 
0.05.   The Sponsor consider ed baseline event rates during follow -up from 5% to 15% and 
variance inflation corresponding to mild confounding (VIF=1.05) , moderate confounding 
(VIF=1.5) , and strong confounding (VIF=2.0).  In each study, power was plotted under these 
assumptions against a reference line of 80%  power under moderate confounding  (VIF =1.5)  
(Figure  2). 
Under mild confounding, both studies will be well -powered to detect a n HR of 0.5.  For 
moderate confounding, the Komodo Health study will be adequately powered to detect HR of 0.5 
for event rates >6%.  The Global PBC registry will be adequately powered to detect event rates  
>8%.  Under strong confounding, the Komodo Health study will be adequately powered to detect
Protocol 747 -404/40 5 Version 1.0:  24Jan2022   
Page 34 
Confidential and Proprietary  HR of 0.5 for event rates >9%.  The Global PBC registry will be adequately pow ered to detect 
event rates >11%.  Power decreases for more moderate HRs.  None of the studies under even the 
most favorable assumptions will be able to detect HRs of 0.9.  The Sponsor notes that the 
assumptions made here are conservative; in particular, it is expected that  many more than one 
control observation and that the addition of lab data from LabCorp (as noted in Section 6.2) will 
substantially increase the siz e of both groups in the Komodo Health study.

10.5. Primary Efficacy Analysis  
Standard error estimation will proceed using the nonparametric cluster bootstrap ( Davison  2013 ) 
as has been suggested for nested trial designs us ing Cox proportional hazards regression 
(Gran  2010 ).  The standard error will be used to calculate the 95% CI of the hazard ratio and to 
conduct statistical hypothesis testing.  A total of [ADDRESS_808994] error  (Cameron  2008 ).  The test statistic is defined  as  

Protocol 747 -404/40 5 Version 1.0:  24Jan2022   
Page 35 
Confidential and Proprietary  𝑤=𝛽̂
𝑠𝛽̂, where 𝛽̂ is the estimated coefficient of OCA treatment from the fitted Cox model  and 𝑠𝛽̂
is the bootstrap standard error of the estimated coefficient.  With  a sufficient sample size, 𝑤 will 
follow a standard normal distribution  and the p -value will be computed as the probability of a 
normal random variable being greater than  |𝑤| or less than −|𝑤|.  A p-value less than 0.05 will 
be considered statistically significant.  
10.6. Exploratory Analyses  
Each component of the study endpoint ( all-cause death, liver transplant, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_610018]) will be assessed separately.   For the outcome of death, the analysis will 
proceed using the same approach as  for the primary effect si ze estimation .  For the outcome of 
liver transplant, death will be treated as a competing event.  Here, follow -up will end at the 
earliest of the end of follow -up, liver transplant, death, or censoring.  The analysis will proceed 
as previously described, b ut instead of a Cox proportional hazards model, a Fine -Gray 
proportional sub distribution  hazards model will be used ( Fine 1999 ).  Similarly, for the outcome 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_610015], death and liver transplant will be treated as 
competing events.  
10.7. Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data  
Patients who disenroll from the covered health  plans in Komodo  Health  or from the Global PBC 
registry are right -censored  at time of disenrollment.   
Dropout / disenrollment  will be assumed to be uninformative conditional on the included 
baseline  covariates in the Cox  model  (see Section 10.2).  Missing  baseline  data will be assumed 
missing completely at random, and a complete case analysis (listwise deletion) will b e 
conducted .  During the conduct of the stud ies, the CRC  may recommend refining the missing 
data strategy to better address any observed pattern of missing data . 
10.8. Subgroup Analyses  
The entire analysis will be repeated separately by [CONTACT_185934] (Komodo Health  only) , age 
(categorical) , sex, region, absence/presence of cirrhosis , and pre-/post -COVID .  Because race is 
not completely captured  in Komodo  Health , these analyses will only in clude those with non -
missing values for race.  
10.9. Sensitivity Analys es 
A quantitative bias analysis will be used to assess the sensitivity of the estimates to violations of 
the assumption of no unmeasured confounding.  To conduct this analysis, it will be assu med that 
the hazard ratio is a reasonable approximation of the odds ratio, and then previously published 
formulas for the relation of unadjusted or partially adjusted to adjusted odds ratios will be used to 
estimate the effect , given inputs for the strengt h of the confounder treatment and confounder 
outcome relationships ( Lash  2021 ).  The analysis will be conducted across a range of values for 
the input parameters to assess how much the effect changes given different confounder 
relationships.  Specifically, given the (a djusted for known confounders) odds ratio for the 
association between the unmeasured confounder and the outcome ( 𝑂𝑅𝐷𝑍) and the prevalence of
the confounder among the OCA -treated  (𝑃𝑍1) and non -OCA -treated  (𝑃𝑍0) (each  assumed
Protocol 747 -404/40 5 Version 1.0:  24Jan2022   
Page 36 
Confidential and Proprietary  homogeneous across level s of known confounders), the relationship between the partially 
adjusted and fully adjusted odds ratios is 𝑂𝑅𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙
𝑂𝑅𝑓𝑢𝑙𝑙=𝑂𝑅𝐷𝑍𝑃𝑍1+1−𝑃𝑍1
𝑂𝑅𝐷𝑍𝑃𝑍0+1−𝑃𝑍0. 
10.10.  Assessment of Claims -based PBC Definition  
The Komodo Health  data are claims -based .  Per AASLD guidelines, PBC diagnosis is based on  
the presence of ≥2 of 3 diagnostic factors:  
•History of elevated ALP levels for at least 6 months
•Positive AMA titer
•Liver biopsy  finding  consistent with PBC
AMA is normally assessed once to diagnose PBC , and the test may have occurred years prio r to 
entry into the Komodo Health  claims databa se.  Indeed, a p reliminary analysis shows that ~10% 
of patients with  a PBC diagnostic code have a n AMA tes t result in the dat abase.  As AMA 
cannot be used in the definition of PBC , a claims -based a nalysis will be used  to identify PBC  
patients in claims data  requiring 2 outpatient claims or 1 inpa tient claim  based upon the work of 
Meyers (Meyers 2010 ). 
Using Canadian ambulatory care and inpatient records, M eyers found that a 2 -outpatient claim 
algorithm had 89% positive predictive value (PPV) when compa red to AMA -verified definite, 
probable , or suspected PBC .  A single inpatient claim ha d 81% PPV , with l imited incremental 
benefit of 2 claims (86% PPV).  
In these studies , in addition to the claims criteria, evide nce of UDCA use  is required , which the 
Sponsor believe s will further improve the PPV of the claims -based algorithm.  To validate this 
approach, the Sponsor will conduct sensitivity and specif icity analyses using AMA as the gold 
standard of PBC diagnosis  within  the Komodo Health  database .  The subpopulation of patients 
with AMA test  result s (positive vs negative) will be compare d to those with a positive and 
negative diagnosis by [CONTACT_610073] + UDCA definition .  The sensitivity of the non –AMA -based 
definition will be defined as the proportion of patients classified as having PBC with the gold 
standard definition who are also classified as having PBC with the non –AMA -based definition.  
The negative predictive value of the non –AMA -based definition will be defined as the 
proportion of patients not classified as having PBC with the non –AMA -based def inition who are 
also not classified as having PBC with the gold standard definition.  The specificity and PPV will 
be assumed to be equal to 1, as the non –AMA -based definition will capture a subset of those 
individuals classified as having PBC by [CONTACT_610074].   
10.11.  Clean Room Committee  
In studies of existing data, decisions about study design or analysis should not be informed by 
[CONTACT_610075].  The study team has attempted to 
pre-specify all statist ical analysis plans to a sufficient degree of detail that ambiguity about how 
the results will be obtained is minimized.  However, often data will need to be examined to 
inform key aspects of the study design or analysis , and in other cases, issues discove red during 
analysis might require certain deviations from the planned design and/or analysis.   
Protocol 747 -404/40 5 Version 1.0:  24Jan2022   
Page [ADDRESS_808995] of the se studies , including 
decisions about protocol deviations as well as the reporting and interpretation of results in 
reports.  Additionally, based on data supplied to them by [CONTACT_610076], the CRC  will make 
decisions  about changes in analytic approaches, model specification, group inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, and variable definitions.  The data supplied by [CONTACT_610077].  To accomplish this, 
preliminary results that contain outcome statistics summarized by [CONTACT_19313] (OCA -treated versus not 
OCA -treated) will not be presented to the Investigators.  If, for some reason, results need to be 
presented by [CONTACT_19313], the group will be masked by [CONTACT_610076].   All aspects of this process will be 
tracked, specifically:  
•All requests for interim data or results will be entered into the study log where they
can be viewed by [CONTACT_610078] .
•All protocol deviations will be logged along with  the rationale for the change.
Protocol changes will not be made unless all Investigators agree to the change.
•Minutes of meetings in which decisions about protocol changes are made will be
saved.
•The original protocol as well as all modified versions w ill be accessible to all
Investigators and analysts.
The original protocol and the study log will be made available as appendix material for all 
reports and publications.  
11. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS
The data in these studies are de -identified .  The Komodo  Health  data use agreements and the 
Global PBC registry  Institutional Review Board  (IRB) approval specify that these data may not 
be re -identified.   In addition, the Global PBC registry  site agreements do not allow for the 
transfer of data outside of the Global PBC  registry . 
The Clinical Research Organization ( CRO ) will ensure the Investigator's understanding of all 
applicable regulations and  standard operating procedures ( SOPs ) and will  ensure an 
understanding of the protocol and maintenance of all requisite documentation.  The CRO will 
have full access to the Komodo Health  data and analyses to be able to ensure these studies are  
conducted per protocol.  The CRO can also review data and programming on site with a member 
of the Global PBC Study Group. 
A Study Data Tabulation Model  (SDTM ) dataset will be provided to the FDA for the Komodo 
Health  dataset.  Should the FDA have questions or queries, a member of the Global PBC Study

Confidential and Proprietary  Group will make themselves available on  site at the FDA with a laptop computer containing the 
Global PBC registry  analytic dataset and can both review data and run queries as required by [CONTACT_1556] . 
12. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
In 2021, the FDA released 4 draft guidance  documents  defining  data quality, management , and 
analyses of real -world data , including guidance specific to claims data and disease registries .  
Given the extensive documentation requirements, separate  supplement al protocol s will be 
submitted, one for the Global PBC registry  and one for the Komodo Health  dataset.  
12.1. Data Collection and Transfer  
12.1.1.  Komodo  Health  
Komodo Health  merges administrative claims across >350 health plans  including commercial 
(63%); Medicaid (23%);  Medica re (10%) ; dual eligible  (<1%); and other (2%).   The dataset 
represents more than 325 million un ique patients in the US between June 2015 and July 2021. 
The datasets include all inpatien t, outpatient , and procedure claims, as well as service dates, 
associated ICD -9 and ICD -10 codes, a nd provider data.  
Data from each payer are tokenized, deidentified , and encrypted by [CONTACT_610079] (see 
Section 12.2.2 ).  Some examples of  file formats Komodo Health  intakes from sources include 
TXT, CSV, and DAT file types.  Komodo  Health  commonly receives data as (but not limited to) 
comma -delimited, pi[INVESTIGATOR_5836] -delimited, a nd tab -delimited files.  A transit token specific to the payer 
and Komodo Health  is used, and onc e received the data are de -encrypted, including a final 
patient token.  Thirty -six percent  of plans transfer their data through a Komodo Health  secure 
FTP site; 64% of plans provide a sec ure FTP site to Komodo Health  to retrieve the data.  
Komodo Health  receives and stor es data in AWS S3 buckets.  
Plans provide uncurated (raw) da ta.  Data cleaning, such as deduplication, will be specified in the 
supplemental submission.  Cleaned data are merged and linked via token, thus patients are able 
to be followed longitudinally across plans that contribute data.  After Komodo  Health  finishes 
processing the data, they are made available as a Snowflake database in the Sentinel cloud 
environment.   
12.1.2.  Global PBC Registry  
Data for the Global PBC registry is collected through the CASTOR trial platform.  The 
CASTOR System, which has been employed for regi strational trials, includes eCRFs, cloud -
based data collection, and download of data in SAS format for analysis.  The data are only 
transferred to the University Health Network system, with no additional data transfer, and are 
analyzed in the SAS environme nt.  The eCRF prevents the input of test values outside of 
medically plausible range and the input of duplicate data.  Source data cannot be modified.  The 
Global PBC registry protocol, eCRFs, and all data cleaning and transformations of variables 
included  in this analysis will be specified in the supplemental submission.  
Protocol 747 -404/40 5 Version 1.0:  24Jan2022   
Page [ADDRESS_808996] confirmed the validity of the NDI.   The NDI has pr eviously 
been linked to the Komodo Health  database (see Section  12.3) and the data file will be kept 
firewalled from analysts until the CRC  authorizes unblinding.  The NDI will be used to ascertain 
death as part of the composite endpoint.  
The Komodo Health data contains information on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7981] , includin g death at 
discharge .  Death  status , combined with a lack  of addition  claims >30 days after dea ths wil l be 
compared to the NDI database.  If a death  on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] (plus lack of additiona l claims) 
is observed in the Komodo database but not in the NDI database, it will be included a s a primary 
endpoint.  
12.1.4.  Quest Diagnostics  
Quest  Diagnostics has >2000 t esting facilities with specimens processed at 26 centr al 
laboratories in the US (excluding those devoted exclusively to clinical trials).  Spec imen 
collection and testing protocols are standardized nationally.  Date of test, laboratory  value  
results , normal range limits, and associated ICD -[ADDRESS_808997] , and platelets to propensity weight  treated and 
untreated patients at index, and to determine UDCA treatment failure.  AMA data will be use d to 
validate the ICD -10 PBC claims diagnostic criteria.  
12.1.5.  LabCorp  
LabCorp  has > 2100  testing facilities with specimens processed at 15 primary laboratories in the 
US (excluding specialty testing facilities such as oncology and genetic testing ).  Specimen 
collection and testing protocols are standardized nationally.  Date of test, lab value results, 
normal range limits, and associated ICD -[ADDRESS_808998] , and platelets to propensity weight  treated a nd 
untreated patients at index, and to determine UDCA treatment failure.  AMA data will be used to 
validate the ICD -10 PBC claims diagnostic criteria.  
12.1.6.  OPTN Transplant Registry  
OPTN  collects and reports data on every US organ donor, transplant candidate, re cipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] , and 
outcome.   Data are collected through a standardized eCRF using the online UNet database 
system .  Specifications on data storage, transfer , and cleaning will be included in a supplemental 
submission.  
Protocol 747 -404/40 5 Version 1.0:  24Jan2022   
Page 40 
Confidential and Proprietary  The OPTN registry will be the primary data s ource to ascertain liver transplant as part of the 
composite endpoint.   The Komodo Health  data contains information  on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614], 
including code s for liver transplant  (see Appendix  A).  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_610036] .  If a liver transplant is  recorded 
on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_610037] , it will be inc luded as a primary endpoint . 
12.2. Data De-identification  
12.2.1.  Global PBC  Registry  
The data collected at each site are de -identified  by [CONTACT_610080] (name, 
address, date of birth,  etc.) prior to being sent to the Central Coordina ting Site .  A unique Global 
PBC Study Group study number is assigned  to each site and each participant with in the site  and 
does not utilize identifying information in creating the patient numbe r.  Identifiers and their 
relation to the Global PBC Study Group number are maintained only at the study  site and not by 
[CONTACT_610081] . 
12.2.2.  Komodo  Health  
Datavant's  de-identification engine is designed for use on structured healthcare data.  The 
de-identification program  performs 2 functions: de -identification of the data set through  removal 
or modification  of identifying data , and the insertion of encrypted patient tokens.   
De-identification  includes the following:  
•Zip Code :  Reduced to the initial three characters to define a zip area.  Based on the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) rules, however, even
three -digit zip areas with a combined  population of less than 20,000 are either nulled
out or are combined again with additional zip zones to ensure that populations exceed
this minimum .
•Date of Service :  Dates of service (eg, admission dates, discharge dates, prescription
fill dates, and pro cedure dates) are typi[INVESTIGATOR_610038] a statistical
de-identification methodology .
•Date of Birth :  Converts all birth dates to birth year .  All dates of birth where the
individual aged  ≥[ADDRESS_808999] an age of 89 .
•Medical Records Numbers:  Removed where present
•Telephone Numbers:  Removed where present
•Email Address:  Removed where present
•Social Security Numbers:  Removed where present
•Beneficiary Numbers :  Removed where present
•Vehicle Information:  Removed where present
•Device Identifiers and Serial Numbers:  Removed where present
•URL Addresses:  Removed where present
Protocol 747 -404/40 5 Version 1.0:  24Jan2022   
Page 41 
Confidential and Proprietary  •IP Addresses:  Removed where present
•Biometric Values:  Removed where present in claims  data; retained in Quest
Diagnostics and LabCorp
•Image Fields:  Removed as defined by [CONTACT_610082]-identification  and tokenization itself  and does not have access to 
the user’s system or identifying information .  The de-identification  process is executed by [CONTACT_610083] , ie, D atavant’s technology is installed and run locally behind the 
users’ firewalls.  
12.3. Data Linkages  
Two sets of linkages are relevant for Komodo Health :  initial link of contributing adm inistrative 
claims databases; and linkage of laboratory data (LabCorp and Quest  Diagnostics ), death date 
(NDI), and transplant date ( OPTN  registry).  All data linkages will be done through Datavant 
tokenization.  
Across all datasets, as the Datavant program de -identifies a patient record, it also generates one 
or more tokens for that record.   Tokens are based on the personally identifying data in the record , 
but the token itself does not incorporate this information in the identifier.  The tokens are 
consistently created from any data set where the underlying identifying information is the same.  
Matching tokens are used to link a patient’s record in one data set with a record for the same 
patient in a different set, without exposing the identifying in formation of that patient.  Matching 
can be deterministic (eg, based on social security number) or probabilistic (eg, based on 
combination or name, sex, birthdate, 3 -digit zip code, etc).  
The tokens used to link records in de -identified data sets cannot be  reversed to reveal the 
patient’s identifying information.  The first step of the token creation process is the use of an 
irreversible hash function, which ensures that the patient’s personally identifying information 
used to create the token cannot be rec overed from the output value.  In the second step of the 
process, the hash value (ie, “Master Token”) is encrypted with a site -specific encryption key to 
generate the final encrypted patient token.  While the same patient information will always create 
the same Master Token, site -specific encryption means that a single patient will have a unique 
token (ie, a “site -specific token”) in each specific user’s data set.  Site-specific encryption 
ensures that a breach at one data site will never compromise the tok ens or protected health 
information at any other data site.  Datavant's QA testing protocols and results will be included 
in the supplementary submission.  
Across all datasets, Datavant will create 2 tokens based on:  
•Last name + first name + gender + date  of birth
•Last name (soundex) + first name (soundex) + gender + date  of birth
In the event this produces 2 patients with one token (called a “collision”) or one patient with 
2 tokens, Datavant will then match on social security number and/or address (when av ailable in 
the dataset).  In the overall Komodo  Health  claims database, in the match with the NDI, and in 
the match with Quest Diagnostics data, this has produced 99% exact match.  In the subset of 
Protocol 747 -404/40 5 Version 1.0:  24Jan2022   
Page [ADDRESS_809000] been removed 
from analysis.  The same process will be used with the OPTN transplant data.  
12.4. Data Harmonization  
The Global PBC registry collects data via a standardized eCRF.   As such, data harmonization 
across data sources is not required.  
The Komodo  Health  database merges administrative claims data from multiple insurers in the 
US.  Claims are then merged with NDI for date of death; LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics 
databases for laboratory tests and values;  and OPTN transplant registry for date of liver 
transplant.  Below are the data sources and variables for which data harmonization is required 
and performed.  
12.4.1.  Komodo  Health  and National Death Index  
The primary endpoint is a composite of all -cause death, liver transplant, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_610018].  The primary source for deat h will be the NDI.  The Komodo  Health  
claims database contains hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7981], including “death.”  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_610039].  Should a death be recorded on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_610040], and if the patient has no healthcare claims 30 days after the “death” discharge, the 
patient will be coded as a death using the h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_166159].  
12.4.2.  Komodo Health  and OPTN Liver Transpla nt 
The pri mary endpoint is a composite of all -cause death, liver transplant, and hospit alization for 
hepatic decompensation.  The primary source for liver transplant will be the OPTN transplant 
registry.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_610041]-10 codes (see Section 12.4.3  and Appendix  A).  Komodo Health  liver 
transplant claims will be compared to the OPTN database.  Should a liver tr ansplant be recorded 
for a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_610042], it will be included as a pr imary endpoint.  
12.4.3.  Komodo Health  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_610043] a composite of all -cause death, liver transplant, and hospit alization for 
hepatic decompensation.  The primary source for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_610044].   The definition will include inpatien t admission ICD-10 codes that 
appear in any position, and includes:  
•Variceal bleed :  ICD-10: I85.01, I85.11, I86.4 and ICD -9: 456.1, 456.21, 456.8
•Ascites :  ICD-10: K70.11, K70.31, K71.51, R18.0, R18.8, J94.8, K65.2 and ICD -9:

070.6, 070.71 ; or utilization of lactulose and/or rifaximin
As ICD-[ADDRESS_809001] across the US healthcare industry, there is no need for further 
harmonization across contributing health  plans.

12.4.5.  Cirrhosis  
In the Global PBC registry , cirrhosis is assessed as positive for one or more of the following 
criteria : 
•Biopsy Stage 4 ;
•Transient elastography ≥16.9  kPa;
•Radiological evidence  (nodular liver or enlargement of portal vein + splenomegal y);
•Clinical features of portal hypertension  defined as platelet count <140 000/mm³ wi th:
persistent decrease in serum albumin; or, TB >2x ULN; or prothrombin time/INR >
ULN (not due to antithromb otic use)
In the Komodo  Health  database, imaging data are not available and measures such as INR ar e 
not consistently collected.  The Sponsor  created and validated an algorithm for a claims -based 
cirrhosis  diagnosis , defined as:  cirrhosis ICD-10 (K74.5; K 74.60; K74.69)  with liver imaging 
and/or biopsy in 6 months preceding  diagnosis  (for imaging codes see Appendix  A).  Preva lence 
estimat es in patients with PBC based on these codes in the Health Core and Optum databas es, 
stratifie d by [CONTACT_610085],  were compared to data from the Global  
PBC registr y (Table  2).  As shown, t he concordance was high .  Additional analyses examin ing 
the association between these groups and clinical outcomes (death, liver transplant and hepatic 
decompensation) demonstrated  that the  expected relationships, with cirrhosis in the presence  of 
portal hypertension or decompensation significantly increasing risk of death , liver failure and

Confidential and Proprietary  12.5. Characterization of Missing Data  
Missing data will be assumed to be missing at random.  As per FDA draft real-world evidence 
(RWE ) guidelines , missing data are characterized by [CONTACT_68089] (see Appendix  B) and will undertake 
an analysis of secular trend to determine if missingness varies by [CONTACT_5586].   Should secular trends 
exist, the CRC  will determine the best approach to addressing bias , and that  approach will be 
included in a protocol revision.  
12.6. Data Management and Analysis SOPs 
The FDA draft guidance on RWE requires a  data management plan as well as  copi[INVESTIGATOR_610045] t data management and analysis SOPs .  These will be included in a supplem ental 
submission and def ined separately for the Global PBC study group and the CRO analyzing the  
Komodo data .   
12.7. Audits and Inspections  
The Investigators should understand that it may be necessary for the Sponsor, the 
IRB/ Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC), and/or regulatory agencies to conduct one or more 
site audits during or after the study and agree to allow access to all study -related documentation 
and information and be available for discussion about the study.  
12.8. Quality Control and Quality Assu rance  
Logic and consistency checks will be performed on all data in the database to ensure accuracy 
and completeness.   SOPs from the CRO analyzing the Komodo data and the Global PBC Study 
Group governing data management and analysis will be provided in a supplement al submission.  
Given the short length of the study conduct period  (approximately 6 months for analysis and 
clinical  study report ), the Sponsor will conduct a single monitoring visit at each site.  Study 
records will be reviewed to ensure  maintenance and  documentation of complete, accurate, 
legible, well -organized , and easily retrievable data .  The Sponsor  will ensure the Investigator's 
understanding of the protocol, reporting responsibilities , and the validity of the data.  This will 
include ensuring  that f ull and appropriate essential documentation is available.   To perform 
analytic file  and analysis verification , the Sponsor  must be  given access to the analytic file, SAS 
code  and code annotation.   The Sponsor will not alter data or pro gramming, nor will transport 
any data from the site.  
12.9. Data Retention and Archiving Study Documents  
The CRO analyzing the Komodo data  and the Global PBC  Study Group will retain the data and 
all study documents after delivery of the project for a maximum period as required  by [CONTACT_12926](s) or the Sponsor .  In the event that storage of data becomes a 
problem at any time during this period, the Sponsor should be consulted for assistance.   At the 
end of the minimum period, the CRO  and the Global PBC Study Group should obtain written 
authorization from the Sponsor before the destruction of any records .  The Sponsor will inform 
the CRO  and the Global PBC  Study Group should it become aware of any changes in storage 
requirements.

These studies  will be conducted in accordance with HIPAA regulations and US standards of 
privacy of individually identifiable health information.  
The Global PBC registry was approved by [CONTACT_610086] o (CAPCR ID: 19-5678 ). 
All data used in these studies  are anonymized , and analyses will be performed on de -identified 
patient -level datasets.  While  patient data will be anonymized and the studies are  observational 
and retrospective in nature  and thus woul d qualify for exemption under the Common Rule , these 
studies are  being  submitted to Western  IRB for full review .  
The data system will be maintained and secured as requested by [CONTACT_610087].  Processes assuring data security will be employed during data extraction, storage, 
and backup.  The data and all study documents will be kept until the Spon sor’s written 
notification that records may be des troyed.  
14. ADVERSE EVENT  REPORTING
As stated in Section 9 (Assessment of Safety), these studies are  not designed to assess safety.  
Study outcome variables collected for the 2 cohorts will be presented for analyses as aggregate 
data groups.  The data sources will  not be searched for individual patient adverse events .  
However, if an Investigator or the Sponsor identifies adverse events that meet postmarketing 
reporting requirements during the c ourse of conducting these studies , such events will be 
reported in acco rdance with applicab le postmarketing reporting requirements.  
15. PUBLICATION POLICY
The Sponsor intends to publish the results of all of the studies that it sponsors , regardless of 
outcome and  consistent with th e Declaration of Helsinki .  Consistent with the recommendations 
of the editors of several leading medical journals, the International Committee of Medical 
Journal Editors (ICMJE), authorship of publications resulting from Intercept -sponsored studies 
should fairly recognize the activities of those th at have made a significant contribution to the 
study  (http://www.icmje.org).   Thus, it is anticipated that authorship will reflect the contribution 
made by [CONTACT_610088], the Investigator s, and others involved, such as statisticians.   
In recent ye ars, issues about conflicts of interest and accuracy of study  data have been raised in 
the medical press.  Accordingly, the Sponsor  has developed publication guidelines for studie s 
that are appropriate for these studies .  Key issues include  the following : 
•Clinical Trial Registries (eg,  www. clinicaltrials.gov , www. clinicaltrials register.eu ):  A
description of these studies  and relevant design elements (eg,  basic design, objectives and
endpoints, sample size, study  population, and key inclusio n/exclusion criteria) and results
will be published online in a manner consistent with applicable regulatory guidelines.
•Overview:  Investigator s, reviewers , and editors will have the right to audit the data to
verify its accuracy.
Protocol 747 -404/40 5 Version 1.0:  24Jan2022   
Page 48 
Confidential and Proprietary  •Responsibility:  Each Investigator  is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all
data from her/his site.  The Sponsor  (or its representatives) is responsible for the accuracy
of the data entered into the study  databases and the analyses conducted.
•Authorship:  Intercept , in collaboration with the Investigator s, will establish the
appropriate authorship and responsibility for drafting study  documents in accordance
with the principles of the ICMJE.  All manuscripts will be reviewed and agreed upon
before submission for pub lication by [CONTACT_15064].
•Intercept Review of External Manuscripts:  Investigator s must submit any drafts of any
publications or presentations that may arise from these studies  to the Sponsor  for review
and approval and to ensure consistency with the poli cy in this protocol at least [ADDRESS_809012] facts and to represent its, or the Publication
Committee’s, opi[INVESTIGATOR_610046].
•Confidentiality:  Investigator s will conduct all interactions with the company and with
third parties consistent with the executed confidentiality agreements.  While publication,
by [CONTACT_7586], presents the critical scientific data in a public forum, some information
(such as future plans, results of preclinical studies , or chemical formulae) may still need
to remain confidential.
•Medical Journal Review:  Upon request, all pertinent study  data and information will be
made availa ble as supplemental information for journal editors and revie wers to evaluate
and audit ; eg, protocol and amendments  and data tabulations.  Arrangements will be
made to maintain the confidentiality of such supplemental information.  Arrangements
will also be made to maintain the confidentiality of the identity of journal reviewers.
Records will be maintained of which docum ents and datasets were reviewed.

INTRODUCTION  
1. Background  
Black men face a shorter life expectancy than white men because of higher prevalence and worse 
outcome from many diseases: most notably hypertension (HTN) and its cardiovascular 
complications but also chronic kidney disease, tobacco -related diseases, prostate and lung 
cancer, depressio n, and HIV/AIDS.[ADDRESS_242093] research is based. Black 
barbershops are uniquely positioned in the community for promoting health and health research 
among male patrons in a relaxed social setting.  
 
Engaging underrepresented  groups in clinical research is both a challenge and a p ublic health 
priority for reducing health disparities.2 Engaging non -Hispanic black individuals —particularly 
black men —in research has been especially challenging.  For example, the age -adjusted death 
rate from prostate cancer is 3 -times higher for black me n than white men  but black men comprise 
<4% of patients in National Cancer Institute prostate cancer trials.3 The HTN -related  death rate 
also is 3 times higher in black men than white men.4 However, in the Dallas Heart Study, which  
addressed this disparity , the in -home phlebotomy participation rate was 64% among black men 
vs. 72% among  black women and 82% and 86% among white men and women, respectively.[ADDRESS_242094] not been very productive. In Dallas County  
Community Oriented Primary Care Clinics, <20% of black clinic patients with HTN are men. In a 
recent trial that  recruited black patients from community pharmacies in Wisc onsin for an 
intervention trial to improve medication  refill rates, only 1/3 of the ~ 600 black patients enrolled 
were men.6 Together, all these data underscore the need to reach out to non -traditional 
community partners and develop health messages that re sonate with black men.  
 
Black barbershops are a unique social  setting  in which  black men to openly discuss important 
issues in their lives —including health —with barbers (trusted  community members with a loyal 
clientele) and other black men. Barbershop hea lth outreach is well -established but previously 
untested as a vehicle to engage black men as participants in research. A series of successful 
intervention trials in other cities serve as a model to evaluate the implementation of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_202876].  A key issue is distrust of doctors and fear exploitation by [CONTACT_33365] —a reaction to 
unequal medical treatment9 and prior scientific misconduct as in the Tuskegee Syphilis Study.10 
In the 1920s, indigent black men in Alabama were recruited by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Pu blic Health Service for 
this natural history study before penicillin was discovered as effective treatment for syphilis; 
however, participants were not informed of the study’s true purpose and they were not offered 
appropriate antibiotic treatment for [ADDRESS_242095]. BP measurement is non -invasive. The BP 
cuff is a familiar iconic symbol of healthcare and community screening programs. HTN is 
 
Protocol Version 2.0  Page 8 of 112 CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol Date: 02_2 5_2020  particularly devastating for black men and is the main reason why average life expectancy is still 
less than for white men.11 High BP medication reduces the risk of heart attack, stroke, heart failure, 
and premature death for all patient groups, including black men.12 HTN exemplifies the barriers 
to effective chronic disease management in general. High BP signifies multiple related health 
issues (such as dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], metabolic syndrome, diabetes, tobacco addiction) that also will 
come to medical attention.  
 
Prior  research trials in Dallas, [LOCATION_007]  and then Los Angeles, [LOCATION_004] , supported by [CONTACT_202928],  
showed that barbershops can support health services research and provide effective  HTN 
screening, referral, and follow up centers for black men. The  Los Angeles  study developed a 
network of [ADDRESS_242096] team approach to manage chronic diseases (starting 
with HTN) in barbershops. The barbershops enrolled 320 hypertensive black male patrons to 
participate in a 12 -month HTN trial with 97% cohort retention. A lso, the screening process 
generated a local registry of >2,[ADDRESS_242097] case for: A) recruiting regular patrons with uncontrolled HTN, B) conducting a 
research protocol and evaluating a HTN intervention; and C) creating a local registry of potential 
subjects as platform for enrolling black men in future research studies.  
 
There is no formal hypothesis testing regarding patient -level outcomes, however this study will 
evaluate : 
 
a) the ability of the barbershop -based research methodology to recruit and retain black men 
in a clinical trial;    
 
b) intervention fidelity by [CONTACT_202929], pharmacist, and hypertensive male participants;  and  
 
c) intervention effectiveness on the primary outcome of systolic BP and patient satisfaction.  
 
All screening participants will also be offered opportunity to participate in a separate research 
registry  (Patients’ Research Networking and Engagement Registry for Cardiovascular and Kidney 
Disease: PARTNER CKD; VUM C IRB# 191374) .  
 
3. Study Design and Overview  
Single arm, pre -test/post -test (Phase 2A) design, with no comparator group.  
 
4. Participant Selection and Withdrawal  
4.1 Barbers & Barbershops  
North Nashville has approximately 1.6 black barbershops per square mile, with only 3.4 miles 
being the maximum distance between shops. Thus, North  Nashville is well -suited to develop 
barbershops as hubs for much needed HTN health services research. Barbershops in this area 
will be prioriti zed, however other areas will be considered as needed to meet participation goals.  
 
 
Protocol Version 2.0  Page 9 of 112 CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol Date: 02_2 5_2020  A lead study  barber  or investigator  will identify and recruit [ADDRESS_242098], the activities and expectations and answer any questions or concerns. 
If the barber shop owner  agrees to parti cipate  as a location , they will sign a Letter of Collaboration 
(Appendix 6A). The target will be 8 barbershops . 
  
Barbershops will meet these general selection criteria: a) NH black owner; b) estimated >95% 
black male clientele  as reported by [CONTACT_136253] ; c) 1 0+ years in business; d) barbers’ commitment 
to the study; and e) large enough clientele to enroll >7 patrons with high BP.  
 
Once a barbershop has agreed to participate, each barber working within that shop will be 
approached  for participation in the study as a barber (secondary participant).  The only inclusion 
criteria are that the barber is fluent in English and willing to commit to training.  They will be 
approached in person to discuss the activities of participation. All b arber questions will be 
answered. If the barber agrees to participate,  he will sign the VUMC  IRB approved  barber  consent 
form. The barber will agree to participate in study training. If they do not complete study training,  
they will not participate. Barbers may withdraw from participation at any time by [CONTACT_202930].  
 
4.2 Participant Inclusion & Exclusion Criteria  for participants  
Inclusion criteria:  
a. Adults 35-79 years  old 
b. Self-identi fy as Non-Hispanic black male   
c. Patron of one of the participating barbershops  (> [ADDRESS_242099] 6 months)  
d. Systolic BP > [ADDRESS_242100] one day apart  
 
Exclusion criteria:  
a. Severe cognitive impairment   
b. Non-fluent in English  
c. Women  
d. Age < 35 years  or > 79 years  
e. Systolic BP < 140 mm  Hg at either screening  
f. Current ly receiving  chemotherapy  for cancer  
g. Organ transplant patient  
h. Currently receiving  dialysis  
i. Other conditions the physician investigators deem unsafe to participate  
j. Plans to move/relocate in next 12 -months and/or travel out -of-area for > 1 month   
 
4.2.1 Pre -screening and enrollment of participants  
Trained study personnel  will screen the black male clientele of the study  barbershops to identify 
and enroll r egular patrons 35 -79 years of age with systolic BP >[ADDRESS_242101] 
been met for each barbershop . Those with systolic BP >140 mm  Hg will be asked to return within 
3 week s to: (a) complete a 2nd set of BPs, (b) complete the visit screening questionnaires (see 
Appendi ces 6B.1-6B.2), and (c) bring their pi[INVESTIGATOR_202877] 2  so that medication data 
can be transcribed.  
 
Protocol Version 2.0  Page 10 of 112 CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol Date: 02_2 5_2020   
Eligible participants at screening visit 2 will be offered the opportunity to participate in the study. 
An informed discussion will occur with the study personnel during which  all questions may be 
answered. If the participant agrees, written informed consent will be obtained emphasizing this is 
a voluntary study and participation may be withdrawn at any time.  
 
The participant’s existing physician  (VUMC)  or Dr.  (or other study physician) , must sign 
the collaborative practice agreement (see Appendix 3) for the pharmacist to provide care and also 
to prescribe medications within this study protocol. All participants in this study will execute a visit 
with the study MD for an evaluation to est ablish care, supported by [CONTACT_202931] 
(e.g. NIH).  If the participant is seen by a VUMC physician, and that physician would prefer to 
serve as the supervising physician  of the pharmacist including all regulatory oversight this will be 
permitted.  These visits  will be performed after enrollment, but prior to any hypertension 
management.  
 
Interviewers will invite patrons who screen -fail to join a new separately VUMC IRB approved 
registry  (IRB# 191374)  by [CONTACT_202932] -contact[CONTACT_202933]. Those completing the [ADDRESS_242102]  or an 
investigator .  
 
Barbers will frequently check and transmit the BP readings  (See Section 5.4)  of their enrolled 
patrons  and motivate them to work with the clinical pharmacist, who will meet them in their 
barbershops  or other mutually agreed location  to optimize BP medication.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_242103] evaluation and counseling  
With the VUMC or study  physici ans’ permission and oversight, the pharmacist will promote patient 
activation, intensify drug therapy under a collaborative practice agreement as permitted by 
[CONTACT_202934], send progress notes to the  participants’  physicians  with their permission , 
and ensure appropriate safety monitoring after each medication change. The study clinical 
pharmacist will follow the trial’s medication algorithm, which is consistent and not different than 
standard of care . The pharmacist will  preferably be certified as a Clinical  Hypertension Specialist  
from the American Society of Hypertension .  
 
The pharmacist will meet each participant in his barbershop  or other mutually agreed location  
every week at first and then less often  (monthly)  once the target BP goal has been achieved . The  
pharmacist will send progress notes to the participants’ physicians after each encounter.  
Pharmacist will share treatment/BP reports with enrolled participants during their visits. These 
reports are generated by [CONTACT_202935] (UCLA) and shared with the study team. 
(Appendix 6 G). The pharmacist will work with the research assistant to schedule participant 

 
Protocol Version 2.0  Page 11 of 112 CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol Date: 02_2 5_2020  appointments with the pharmacist, make reminder calls, and obtain  or share  medical records from 
the participants’  physicians.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_242104] and  study team  
will interview the  participants and those who achieve BP control will be invited to become a study  
role model .  
 
If they agree , the research  assistant will take  a photograph of the role model, and (with the model’s 
approval) ha ve the poster gen erated at a copy shop and place it on the wall of the barbershop. 
Each poster models one of two desired behaviors (have the barber check the BP after every 
haircut or meet the pharmacist in the barbershop), and, in the model’s own words, briefly states 
one common barrier to the behavior change, one facilitating factor, and one positive outcome.  
 
5.4 Blood Pressure measurement and data transmission  
UCLA -CS will supply Nashville with Barbershop BP Carts. T hese nurses’ carts are modified with 
a highly -rated a utomated BP monitor that is programmed to take 5 readings, which upload 
immediately to a desktop computer that automatically transmits the readings by [CONTACT_202936], MD; the n de-identified  data are transmitted every even ing to the 
UCLA -CS CTSI  under the supervision of Dr. , or approved personnel at UCLA . Westat, 
Inc. is the data management company that collaborated with the LA Barbershop study and will 
offer ongoing support to this study, leveraging its already de veloped methodology.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_242105] or study physician will 
generate relev ant orders as needed & complete medical record documentation  
 
5.6 Monitoring the fidelity of the Intervention  
Treatment fidelity involves three components: 1) treatment delivery , 2) receipt , and 3) enactment . 
Treatment delivery  by [CONTACT_202937]  (BP checks)  will be assessed by [CONTACT_202938]. After observing a mock barber -patron in teraction, 
the assistant will complete detailed checklists to evaluate performance of the desired 
competencies and intervention delivery, followed by [CONTACT_202939].  
 
Treatment delivery by [CONTACT_202940] (Dr.  or other 
study designated physician ), who will review  with the pharmacists each week t heir progress notes 
to ensure adherence  to the study algorithm as well as perform quality performance review . 
Treatment receipt  will be assessed a) by [CONTACT_202941] d uring each in -person visit by [CONTACT_202942]; and b) by [CONTACT_202943] a [ADDRESS_242106] encounters, and model posters.  
 
6. Ascertainment of Outcomes  
6.1 Recruitment and retention of black men  
All people screened at each of the screening days will be tabulated and descriptive statistics 
performed. For those that enroll, their activities throughout the 6 -month study timeline will be 

 
Protocol Version 2.0  Page 13 of 112 CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol Date: 02_2 5_2020  7. Study Procedures and Visits  
7.[ADDRESS_242107] month of the study, all adult black men entering the study barbershop will be offered 
free BP screenings. This will be in person. Men with systolic BP >[ADDRESS_242108].  The research team member will call the potential participant to remind them of SV2 
appointment no more than 3 times in the eligibility i nterval.  All men completing this initial screening 
visit will receive a water bottle or other similar gift as a token of appreciation . The script and 
content of the screening visit are described in Appendix 6B.1  (Screening Visit 1 Survey). All data 
collect ed in this screening visit will be directly entered into the on -site study computer to a secure 
web portal specific to this study. This is managed by [CONTACT_202944], Inc.  
 
In addition, all men completing the first screening visit (regardless of  their eligibility to join the HTN 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] ), will be invited to join a registry by [CONTACT_202945] -contact[CONTACT_202946]. 
This is a separate IR B approved study with its own procedures and documents  (Patients’ 
Research Networking and Engagement Registry for Cardiovascular and Kidney Disease; 
PARTNER CKD; VUMC IRB# 191374).  
 
7.1.2 Second screening day  
Those invited to participate in the second scre ening visit will be asked to: (1) complete a 2nd set 
of BP measurements and health questionnaire  (Appendix 6B.2; Screening Visit 2 ) and (2) bring 
their pi[INVESTIGATOR_202878]. Subjects with 
systolic BP >140 mmHg on both days who meet all other inclusion criteria will be enrolled after 
informed written consent has been obtained by [CONTACT_102867] . 
 
7.1.3 Enrollment & Initial activities  
Informed consent will be obtained,  and the participant will provide written documentation.   
 
Visit questionnaires  for baseline  (Appendix 6B.2 ), 3-month telephone visit,  and 6 -month endpoint 
assessment visits will be completed by [CONTACT_202947] , or by [CONTACT_37261] . The data will include detailed demographic and 
identification information: marital status, phone number, add ress, and email address. Structured 
response items  will includ e barbershop patronage, hypertension/medication history, comorbid 
conditions/family history, medication adherence, quality of life, health care access and utilization, 
and satisfaction with medical care.  Five BP measurements will be taken and recorded at ba seline 
using the same cuff size as recorded at screening.  
 
7.1.[ADDRESS_242109] of medication -related problems, which 
is included in the Progress Note, at each encounter (see Appendix 6D & 6E ). A checklist of 
actions/interventions will also be completed. If an adverse event is reported, the pharmacist will 
 
Protocol Version 2.0  Page 14 of 112 CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol Date: 02_2 5_2020  complete an Adverse Event form. Pharmacist and/or physician will also record all necessary 
information in the VUMC electronic medical record.  
 
The research team will attempt to contact [CONTACT_202948] a haircut in [ADDRESS_242110] visits as well as 3-
month telephone and 6-month data collection.  
 
7.1.5 Study close visit (6 -months)  
The research assistant will perform a blood pressure assessment and questionnaires as in 
Appendix 6B.4.  
 
Data will be collected on performance and acceptability of the study protocol using open ended 
interview questions.  
 
7.1.6  Barber survey  
All participating barbers will be asked to complete a brief survey about their experiences in the 
study (Appendi x 6B.5). This data will be collected in R EDCap and by [CONTACT_202949].  
 
7.2 Client  compensation  
Participants will be offered $25 at the completion of the second  screening visit regardless of 
eligibility . Participants will be offered $[ADDRESS_242111] (up to 6 visits ; the participant may have additional visits if needed without 
additional compensation ), $15 for the telephone interview  and $100  at the completion of the final 
6-month visit.  Participants will also be offered a monthly $25 haircut voucher  in addition to the 
above . The total potential compensation if all study activities are completed is $440  (direct 
payment and haircut vouchers) . Participants may be asked to complete a W -[ADDRESS_242112] program and / or pre -
paid gift cards , or check .  
 
7.3 Barber and barbershop compensation  
Each barbershop will receive a flat fee of $1000.00 ($500.00 at the beginning of the study and 
$500.00 after study completion). Each barber will receive $10.[ADDRESS_242113]  approx imately  
7 participants, this would equate to $840.00 per shop (14 x 6 months = 84 BP measurements = 
$840.00 per shop). Barbers will also redeem submitted study hair cut vouchers ($25.00/each). 
Barbers and barbershops may be asked to complete a W9 form to r eceive payment. Payment will 
be by [CONTACT_9434], or prepaid gift card for activity over the prior month.  
 
8. Statistical Analysis Plan  
Primary analysis  (clinical outcomes) :  
Since this study has no comparison group, our initial analysis will focus on estimating the average 
change in systolic BP from baseline to 6 months and derive its 95% confidence interval, that is, 
our goal is to estimate 𝑑 = 𝐸[𝑆𝐵𝑃 6𝑚 – 𝑆𝐵𝑃 0], where  E stands for expectation, and 𝑆𝐵𝑃 0 and 
𝑆𝐵𝑃 6𝑚 denote baseline and 6 months systolic BP, respectively. Let 𝑑𝑖𝑗 be the systolic BP change 
score from baseline to 6 months on individual j in barbershop i. Define

the observed m ean change of systolic BP in barbershop i, where 𝑚𝑖 is the sample size for 
barbershop i. An estimate of 𝑑 can be derived using weighted average of 𝑑̅𝑖 over all the 
𝑛 barbershops ( 𝑛 = 8 in this study). The optimal weights are given by [CONTACT_202950] o f the variance 
of each cluster summary :22

Secondary Analyses:  
Three sets of secondary analyses will be conducted.  First, we will examine the impact of baseline 
covariates on the outcome. We will focus on the same covariates used in the LA Barbershop 
study: baseline systolic BP, high cholesterol (yes/no), and whether there is a doctor for routine 
medical care (yes/no) . Graphs for blood pressure trajectories and latent class growth analysis will 
be used to classify the participants into those who respond well to the intervention and those who 
do not respond well. Important covariates that predict participant’s response will be identified via 
logistic regression. Second, we will conduct longitudinal analysis of serial systolic BP obtained on 
each individual from baseline to [ADDRESS_242114] 
for the c ovariates identified above. We will examine the trend (trajectory) by [CONTACT_202951]. This will be done for each barbershop separately. Third, we will compare 
data from this study with the intervention arm of the LA Barbershop stu dy to see if there is a 
systematic difference. The comparison will be done for the change score of systolic BP at [ADDRESS_242115] missing BP data due to dropout and/or intermittent missing data at the individual level 
but not at the shop level, where dropout is ex pected at baseline when accrual targets are unmet; 
after baseline, missing data will be from individuals not shops. The following analyses will be 
 
Protocol Version 2.0  Page 16 of 112 CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol Date: 02_2 5_2020  conducted if the rate of missing data exceeds 10% at [ADDRESS_242116] 
missing data mechani sm beforehand, we will compare results of two sets of  analyses: (1) The 1st 
set is based on multiple imputations, i.e., missing BP data “filled in” by [CONTACT_202952]. Five 
imputed datasets are generated by [CONTACT_202953].24 Analysis wi ll be 
conducted within each imputed dataset using linear mixed effects models. Results of imputed 
datasets will be combined to produce final estimates. This approach assumes data are missing 
at random (MAR): the mechanism that gives rise to missing data re lies on observed data only. 
However, missing data from cohort attrition and intermittent missing data due to low treatment 
efficacy may be missing not at random (MNAR); the probability of missing data may be related to 
unobserved (and possibly high) BP. He re the multiple imputation method will produce biased 
efficacy estimates. (2) The 2nd approach relies on joint modeling of longitudinal BP data and 
missing data mechanisms for dropout and intermittent missing data MNAR.[ADDRESS_242117]/post -test design; thus, the identification of missing data 
models is not as  powerful as it would be in a longitudinal design.  
9. Adverse Events  
9.1 Potential Adverse Events from study interventions  
The likelihood of adverse events beyond those that may be expected as a result of hypertension 
medication management are minimal.  
 
Loss of confidentiality is a serious risk in any clinical research; however, is not likely given the 
safeguards we have esta blished to protect and maintain the research data collection, 
transmission, and storage.  
 
Anxiety is a rare and typi[INVESTIGATOR_202880]’s BP is elevated. Study personnel will undergo training  in all study procedures which will 
include appropriate interaction with subjects.  
 
Uncontrolled hypertension is associated with increased risks of known hypertensive 
complications including cardiovascular  events, stroke, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. 
These risks are not due to study procedures but are intrinsic to the condit ion of all subjects being 
enrolled. The purpose of our  study is to reduce these risks by [CONTACT_202954].   
 
During the data collection periods (baseline, 6 -month follow -up), all subjects will receive a form 
with their BP reading, an explanation of  the accepted cutoff values for normal and high BP, and 
suggestion for medical follow -up based on the degree of elevation as below:  (Appendix 6 C) 
▪ For normal BP range of below 120/[ADDRESS_242118] once a year to maintain good health.  
▪ For high normal range BP of 120/80  mm Hg -139/89  mm Hg , subjects are advised to see 
a doctor within 6 months.  
▪ For elevated BP range of 140/90  mm Hg -159/99  mm Hg , subjects are advised to see a 
doctor within the next 1 month.  
 
Protocol Version 2.0  Page 17 of 112 CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol Date: 02_2 5_2020  ▪ For very elevated BP range of 160/100  mm Hg -179/109  mm Hg , subjects are advised to 
see a doctor within the next 2 weeks . 
▪ For extremely elevated BP range of 180/110  mm Hg -199/119  mm Hg , subjects are 
advised to see a doctor in the next 3 days.  
▪ For alarmingly elevat ed BP of 200/[ADDRESS_242119] for personalized health 
management and to their barber for frequent BP monitoring and social support. The risks of 
uncontrolled HTN are not due to study procedures but are intrinsic to the condition of all subjects 
being enrolled.  
 
Adverse drug reactions :  
Although not common, there are potential serious adve rse drug reactions associated with BP 
medication, but the most common side -effects from blood pressure medication are not serious 
and resolve within three days after the medication has been stopped. In addition, excessive fall 
in blood pressure is a potent ial serious risk of any blood pressure medication.  
 
9.2 Monitoring for Adverse Events  
Adverse Events procedures and forms are included in the Appendix (Appendi ces 8-12). These 
forms include  description of the event, event onset and end date, disease -related complications, 
checklist of drug or non -drug related events, severity scale, whether or not the event was related 
to study procedures, event pattern, actions taken with study drug, whethe r or not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65586]/or medication(s) were required.  
 
To track potential adverse events from added medications, pharmacist will 1) provide details 
about potential adverse reactions to each drug prescribed, 2) instruct subjects to call the 
pharmacis t immediately if they suspect an adverse drug reaction, 3) reduce or stop medication if 
systolic BP falls below 110 mmHg or diastolic BP falls below 60 mmHg as recommended by [CONTACT_202955], 4) make an additional follow -up phone call one w eek after medication 
changes, 5) go through a complete check list of potential adverse events at each encounter (in 
person visit and via telephone) to assess the presence and severity of all reported reactions, 6) 
send a detailed Progress Note (Appendix 6D  & 6F ) to the subjects’ physicians after every in -
person and telephone encounter with the subjects. The Progress Note used for the in -person and 
telephone encounters will have a complete check list of potential adverse drug reactions to every 
class of bloo d pressure medication included in the signed treatment protocol. The adverse drug 
reaction check list includes  the following items:  
▪ Calcium channel blocker: lower extremity edema, bradycardia, hypotension, gingival 
hyperplasia  
▪ Angiotensin converting enzyme  inhibitor/angiotensin receptor: cough, hyperkalemia, 
acute renal failure, alopecia, angioedema  
▪ Thiazide/thiazide -like diuretic: erectile dysfunction, hyperglycemia, hyperuricemia, gout, 
hypokalemia, hyponatremia  
▪ Vasodilating beta -blocker: wheezing, erectile dysfunction, depression, heart block  
▪ Aldosterone antagonist: gynecomastia, hyperkalemia, acute renal failure, erectile 
dysfunction  
▪ Alpha blocker: dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, lower extremity edema, heart failure  
▪ Centrally acting s ympatholytic: rebound hypertension, dry mouth, somnolence  
▪ Direct Vasodilator: headache, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], shortness of breath, lupus (hydralazine), 
pericarditis (hydralazine)  
▪ Loop diuretic: acute renal failure, hypokalemia  
 
Protocol Version 2.0  Page 18 of 112 CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol Date: 02_2 5_2020   
In addition, the study physicians  will meet regularly with the pharmacist to review Progress Note 
and ensure protocol adherence. Subjects will receive detailed instructions from the pharmacist 
about potential adverse reactions to each drug prescribed and to call the pharmacist immediately 
if they suspect an adverse drug reaction.  This will occur locally at VUMC. In addition, the study 
physician at Cedars Sinai will review de -identified progress notes for adherence to the study 
hypertension algorithm and to offer any further oversight recommen dations.

11. Study Oversight  
This trial will be monitored by [CONTACT_202961] (R01 HL 117983), and it will utilize a similar  DSMB plan.  The DSMB  is responsible  
for safeguarding  the interests  of study  participants  by [CONTACT_202962], and  by [CONTACT_202963].  The 
DSMB  reviews  the following  types  of safety  data: 1) quarterly  reports from the UCLA DCC; 2) 
annual reports  from DSMB  meetings;  and 3) expedited reports from the PI [INVESTIGATOR_202885]/UPs 
or concerning trends  identified  by [CONTACT_202964]. After reviewing  pertinent reports, the 
DSMB  determines  whether  any trend  that may be identified  is related  to the trial. After each  DSMB  
meeting,  the study team will prepare a draft report for the  DSMB  Chair  to review and sign .  The 
VUMC PI [INVESTIGATOR_202886]. The report summarizes  the recommendations  of the 
DSMB  regarding  the safety  and continuance  of the study and  should  be sent to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_874]  [ADDRESS_242122]  current  and potential  
participants. The DSMB is chaired by  (licensed pharmacist and board -
certified pharmacotherapy specialist) who is experienced with DSMBs. Other DSMB members 
are  (Emeritus Professor of Biostatistics, Cornell University, Ithaca, New 
York) and  (Profe ssor of Medicine/Cardiology, Tulane University School of 
Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana).

Protocol Date: 02_2 5_2020   APPENDIX 7: DATA SAFETY MONITORING COMMITTEE PLAN/ SAE FORMS  
 
Preamble  
The monitoring  of SAE/U Ps is an important  process  for ensuring  the safety  of subjects  
participating  in clinical  research.  This document  establishes  a set of procedures  for collecting, 
evaluating, and  reporting SAE/UPs in  the study.  
  There will be two sources of safety data in this community -level intervention trial:  
(1) Research coordinators  will obtain patient -reported adverse events/unanticipated problems 
on emergency depart ment visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], death, and specific blood pressure 
medication sid e-effects at baseline, [ADDRESS_242177] data on interval changes in health.  
 
(2) The study’s Lead Clinical Pharmacist will obtain additional data on adverse events and 
unanticipated problems.  He/she will co llect data on patient -reported adverse events from 
monthly scheduled in -person or phone encounters plus additional follow up phone calls 
after every BP medication change. He/she also will collect safety data from Laboratory 
tests ordered when indicated dur ing the intervention period.        
Key Components of the Safety Monitoring Plan  
Definitions of Adverse Events and Unanticipated Problems are presented in Appendix 8. 
  
A flow diagram for expedited reporting of Serious Adverse Events/Serious Unanticipated 
Problems is presented in Appendix 9. A summary of the key components of the monitoring  
process  to be  undertaken  to detect and report SAE/UPs  for the study is  presented  below:  
1. The UCLA Data Coordinating Center (DCC):  The DCC  receives  submitted electronic 
reports  of AE/UPs  from research coordinators  and from the Lead Clinical Pharmacist . 
If AE/UP  is marked as serious on the electronic case report form and thus meets  the 
criteria  for expedited  reporting, an automatic e -mail notification is  sent immediately to 
both Physician Monitors and the PI; their roles are described later.   For non -serious 
AE/UPs, the  DCC will  provide blinded  quarterly safety  reports  to the DSMB,  and PI [INVESTIGATOR_202911] (Vanderbilt  University ). As the DCC only receives de -
identified information, th e local VUMC study team will link any collected data also in 
real time with the affected participant. This will be acted upon immediately as described 
here.  
 
2. Physician  Monitors:  The Physician  Monitors  serve  two major  roles  in the evaluation  of 
SAE/UPs  for the trial: 1) ongoing,  real-time reviews  of all individual  SAE/UP s from the 
research assistant or clinical pharmacist (VUMC) , review the medical records, make a 
rapid determination if the event indeed is serious and is related to research participation, 
and complete and forward to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_202912]/UPs shown in 
Appendix 12; and 2) monthly reviews  of cumul ative  SAE data to judge  whether there  are 
concerning  trends  in the occurrence  of event s. 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Protocol Version 2.0  Page 104 of 112 CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol Date: 02_2 5_2020   3. DSMB:  The DSMB  is responsible  for safeguarding  the interests  of study  participants  by 
[CONTACT_203015], and  by [CONTACT_203016].  The DSMB  reviews  the following  types  
of safety  data: 1) quarterly  reports from the UCLA DCC; 2) annual reports  from DSMB  
meetings;  and 3) expedited reports from the PI [INVESTIGATOR_202885]/UPs or concerning 
trends  identified  by [CONTACT_202964]. After reviewing  pertinent reports, the DSMB  
determines  whether  any trend  that may be identified  is related  to the trial. After each  
DSMB  meeting,  the study team will prepare a draft report for the DSMB Chair to review 
and sign. The VUMC PI [INVESTIGATOR_202913].  The report summarizes  the 
recommendations  of the DSMB  regarding  the safety  and continuance  of the study  and 
should be s ent to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] [ADDRESS_242178]  current  and potential  participants.  
 
4. PI: [INVESTIGATOR_202914]/UP, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_202915] 7 
days of its detection along with an appropriate plan to address it, if feasible. After 
each  scheduled  DSMB  meeting, the  PI [INVESTIGATOR_202916]  a summary report from the DSMB  
Chair  that summarizes  the DSMB  deliberations  and recommendations.  
 
Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) See also Appendix  8 
As defined  by [CONTACT_74379]  (http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/crg/glossary.php#serious ), serious  adverse  
events  (SAEs)  are considered  to be those  events  that result  in at least one  of the following  
outcomes:  
1. Death  
2. Life-threatening  
3. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_202917]  
4. Persistent or significant  disability/incapacity  
5. A congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
6. Other  events  that might jeopardize  the subject  and may require  medical or 
surgical  intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  above  
 
Definition of Unanticipated Problems See Also  Appendix 8 
As specified  by [CONTACT_203017] (http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/policies/adverse.htm ) an 
unanticipated  problem (UP) is considered  to be  any event  or problem that  is: 
 
1. unexpected;  and 
2. possibly,  probably,  or definitely related  to study  participation;  and 
3. suggests  greater risk of harm to study  participant(s) than  was previously  
known  or recognized.  
 
An unanticipated  problem is classified as serious if the event  results in an emergency department 
visit, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or death.  
 
 
 
 
 
  
Protocol Version 2.0  Page 105 of 112 CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol Date: 02_2 5_2020   Procedures for Reviewing and Reporting SAE/Ups  
The Study  personnel,  in previous  consultation  with NHLBI,  have  established  the following  
procedures  for reviewing  and reporting  SAE/UPs.  
1. Reporting of SAE/U PS by [CONTACT_079] (PI)  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_202918]/UPs,  as described  below.  
2. Submission of the Case Report Form for SAE/Ups ( see Appendices 10-12) 
Adverse events forms will be electronically entered into the study database by [CONTACT_203018]. Pharmacist documents will also be maintained in the VUMC REDCa p study 
database . 
Detection and Initial Processing of SAE/Ups  
1. The electronic database is updated every 24 hours and is programmed to automatically 
send immediate e -mail notification of any new SAE/UP to both Physician Monitors and 
the PI. The report  contai ns all information  on the SAE/UP  that was entered  into the 
database.  
 
2. The DCC  Database Manager sends  summary cumulative  reports  of SAE/UPs  to the 
Physician  Monitors  monthly . The Physician  Monitor who has been assigned to that 
quarter reviews  the summary report to determine  if any concerning  trends  are noted.  
 
3. If a serious  problem  or trend  is suspected, the Physician  Monitors  would  request that 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_202919].   
Physician Monitors  
 will serve  as Physician  Monitors  for this study.  If neither is 
available another study MD will be designated in their absence as needed.   as Cedars 
Sinai will also serve in this oversight role. The Physician  Monitors  are assigned  the responsibility  
of serving  as lead Physician  Monitor during  alternating  calendar quarters.  The Lead Physician 
Monitor completes the form but reviews it together with the other Physician Monitor. The 
Physician  Monitors  are given  limited  access  to the study  database  only to enter a Physician 
Monitor SAE/UP  Report Form  (see Appendix  12) for each  reported SAE/UP. The form serves  
as the monitor’s  evaluation  of each  reported  SAE/UP. A description  of the process  for Physician  
Monitor  evaluation  of UPs/SAEs  is presented  below.  
 
1. The Physician  Monitor  evaluates  each  SAE/UP  to determine  if it is unexpected  and 
possibly,  probably,  or definitely  related  to the study  intervention,  and completes  the 
Physician Monitor SAE/UP  Report Form  (Appendix  12) online  within  three  (3) business  
days  of receipt.   Physician  Monitors use the  Comments  section  of the form when  
needed  to clarify  the context  or assumptions  used  in answering  form questions.  
 
2. If the participant went to the emergency department, was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], or died,  the 
Physician  Monitor  will need to request and review the medical  records. The Study 
Coordinator  will facilitate this process by [CONTACT_19201] a signed HIPAA waiver and request 
for release of medical records from the participant or his designee.  
 
 
 

 
 
  
Protocol Version 2.0  Page 106 of 112 CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol Date: 02_2 5_2020   3. The DCC Database Manager  prepares  quarterly  SAE/UP  reports  that include:  1) all 
SAE/UPs; 2) all SAE/UPs  related  to study participation;  and 3) a summary  of the SAE 
monitoring  process.  The monthly report  is emailed  to both Physician  Monitors, who 
review  the SAE/UP  reports  for any concerning trends.  Should  any concerns  arise due 
to observed  trends, the lead Physician  Monitor for that quarter  sends  a written  
recommendation  to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_202920].  
 
Procedure for Expedited Reporting of SAE/Ups (see Appendix 9) 
1. Expedited  SAE/UP  reports  from the PI [INVESTIGATOR_202921]:  
▪ Study  title, grant  number,  PI [CONTACT_2300]  
▪ Description  and date of the event  or problem, including  why it merits  
expedited  reporting  
▪ When  it becomes  available,  date(s)  on which  the SAE/UP  was detected by 
[CONTACT_181106] e -mail alerts sent to the Physician Monitors and PI, and the 
date on which the PI [INVESTIGATOR_202922] , and applicable  
oversight  bodies  (relevant  IRBs, the DSMB,  Office  for Human  Research  
Protections).  
▪ Any corrective  action  planned  or taken  in response  to the SAE/UP  (e.g.,  
study  suspension,  consent or protocol  changes, additional training  or 
security  measures).   
▪ Signature  [CONTACT_136269] 
 
2. All communications  from the relevant  oversight bodies  regarding  any expedited  
UP/SAE  must  be reported  to NCATS . 
 
3. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_202923]/SAEs  to the 
DSMB,  as noted  above.  
 
Quarterly Reporting of SAE/Ups to the DSMB  
Each  quarter, the study  biostatistician  sends  cumulative  summary tables  of all SAEs,  all 
related  SAE/UPs to the DSMB.   
Interim Monitoring Plan  
There  will be no interim  analyses  for futility.  
SAE/UPs Reports  
Each  quarter , the UCLA DCC prepares  cumulative  SAE/UPs  reports  for review  by [CONTACT_203019].  Cumulative  SAE/UPs  reports  are transmitted  to the DSMB  for review  each  quarter,  
and cumulative  summary  reports  are prepared  for each  teleconference  or in-person  closed 
session  meeting  of the DSMB.  
 
SAE/UP tables  are included  in the monthly cumulative  reports from the DCC to the Physician  
Monitors:  
▪ Summary data on all SAE/UPs  
▪ Summary of SAE/UPs Related to the Research   
▪ Summary  of Serious  Adverse  Event  Monitoring  Process  
▪ Listing of individual SAE/UPs

Protocol Date: 02_2 5_2020   APPENDIX [ADDRESS_242179]  medical occurrence  associated  with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether  or not considered  drug related.  An adverse  event (also  referred  to as  an 
adverse  experience)  can also be any unfavorable  and unintended  sign (e.g.,  an abnormal  
laboratory  finding),  symptom,  or disease  temporally  associated  with the use of a drug, without  
any judgment  about  causality.  An adverse  event can arise  from any use of a drug (e.g.,  off label 
use, use in combination  with another  drug) and  from any route  of administration,  formulation  or 
dose,  including  overdose.  
 
Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE ) – An adverse  event  or suspected  adverse  reaction  is considered  
"serious" if, in the view of either the investigator  or sponsor, it results  in any of the following  
outcomes:  Death, a life-threatening  adverse  reaction,  inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_56901],  a persistent  or significant incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the 
ability  to conduct normal life  functions,  or a congenital anomaly/birth  defect.  Important medical 
events  that may not result  in death, be life-threatening,  or require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_202924], based  upon  appropriate  medical judgment,  they may jeopardize  the 
patient  or subject  and may require  medical or surgical intervention  to prevent  one of the 
outcomes  listed  above.  
 
Unanticipated  Problem  - any incident,  experience,  or outcome  that meets  all of the following  
criteria: 1) unexpected  2) related  or possibly  related  to participation  in the research;  and 3) 
suggests  that the research  places  subjects  or others  at a greater risk of harm than  was 
previously  known  or recognized.  
 
OHRP  considers  unanticipated  problems , in general,  to include  any incident,  experience,  or 
outcome  that meets  all of the following  criteria:  
(1) unexpected  (in terms  of nature,  severity,  or frequency)  given  (a) the research  procedures  
that are described  in the  protocol -related  documents,  such  as the IRB- approved  research  
protocol and  informed  consent  document; and  (b) the characteristics  of the subject 
population  being  studied;  
 
(2) related  or possibly  related  to participation  in the research  (in this guidance  document,  
possibly  related means  there  is a reasonable  possibility  that the incident,  experience,  or 
outcome  may have  been caused  by [CONTACT_157605]);  and 
 
(3) suggests  that the research  places  subjects  or others  at a greater risk of harm  (including  
physical,  psychological,  economic, or social harm) than  was previously  known  or recognized.
